China‚Äôs growing air transport market is benefiting from state subsidies, and should be considered a possible future partner in trade agreements covering commercial airline services. (4/4)
Gulf airlines have exploited government subsidized service and government-funded upgrades to their hubs to grow their market share for U.S.-India passenger travel from 8 percent in 2008 to 46 percent in 2016. (3/4)
Qatar Airlines is violating the spirit of the Open Skies supplemental agreements by purchasing the small Italian carrier Meridiana (rebranded as ‚ÄúAir Italy‚Äù), enlarging its fleet size by 500%, and establishing U.S. routes from third-country stopover destinations. (2/4)
$48 billion in total cash or in-kind subsidies by the Gulf states have allowed the Gulf airlines to achieve a ten-fold increase in daily passenger seats since 2001, capturing significant market share in international travel from U.S., European, and Australian airlines. (1/4)

Medical studies show strong empirical evidence that non-opioid alternatives are successfully treating chronic and acute pain, which can bring improved patient flow and discharge, quicker recovery, fewer readmissions to the hospital, and reduced hospital costs.
A new model of patient care should include targeted flexibility in pain management, incorporating patient involvement and discussion of vulnerabilities and risks, and a multi-modal treatment framework.
Significant structural and regulatory impediments block efforts to decrease medical opioid misuse, from physician training and federal billing codes to the insurance practice of bundling payments to hospitals and providers.
2011 marked a high point in medical opioid prescriptions and has decreased since then. Successful reform came through federal action, new health agency guidelines, congressional pressure, and proposed shifts in DEA production quotas for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Two major pathways for opioid misuse‚Äîthe illicit opioid black market and the unintended consequences of proper patient care‚Äîhave intersected in recent years, each feeding the other and increasing abuse.
Major findings include: 40% of opioid overdose deaths involved prescription opioids. Finding better interventions for treating chronic and acute pain is a new medical imperative.
Read our new report, "Beyond Opioids in Medical Treatment: Improving Patient Outcomes, Reducing Costs, and Serving Public Health with Comprehensive Pain Management.‚Äù With 42,000 opioid overdose deaths a year, the report addresses opioid over-prescription. https://t.co/xxhLpBJHlK

Transparency and legislation can only go a certain distance against CCP influence. Democracy is kept alive by democratic citizens and well-functioning institutions. Citizens of the US, other democracies need to personally invest in safeguarding their democratic traditions. 7/7
In the US, CCP operations are aimed at politicians, business people, academia, the media, and Chinese diaspora communities. The 2016 election showed continued vulnerability, and CCP-connected funding influences think tanks, academia, newspapers, and other media outlets. 6/7
The strategy is reaping dividends, writes @jonasPplesner. In New Zealand, a former Chinese army spy trainer now serves in the NZ Parliament, securing Chinese funding for his party. In Australia, the 2 main parties have been propped up by foreign money through CCP operatives. 5/7
With deep coffers and the help of Western enablers, the CCP uses money, rather than Communist ideology, as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence. 4/7
The Chinese Communist Party's goal is to quell dissenting voices at home and abroad, while influencing civil society and governments abroad. Their targets range from prominent politicians and business people to academics, students, and the American public. 3/7
