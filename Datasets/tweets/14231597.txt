“In Malawi: Children being taken out of school to weed the tobacco fields and harvest the leaves ... Some families in straw huts are paid nothing for 10 months until ... after the harvest. They live on a pail of maize a week”		https://t.co/sg9lGzhzYq
“We can no longer ignore our industry’s and our technologies’ harmful biases, large-scale breaches of trust, and lack of ethical safeguards. These are life and death stakes.”		https://t.co/GwOCjPvYcO
“The US was found to have imported similar [high-risk] goods worth $144bn ... making it by far the biggest global importer of products potentially made by slaves.”		https://t.co/nhQ5VcYCGp
“the Federal Trade Commission ... found consumers lost $542 million to cryptocurrency-related scams in the first two months of 2018.”		As a victim of identity fraud and wire fraud, consumer and business protections were nice. Crypto lacks this.		https://t.co/8jmFRSpPMf
“far more important than what you say is getting to the right person to say it.”		This was one of several reasons I didn’t like ‘Start with Why’.		https://t.co/pUyV0E0CZh
“The company [Cambridge Analytica’s parent company SCL] has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”		https://t.co/Vy9n6Wyc7u
“One reason [SAFEs] are popular is because the closing mechanics are as simple as signing a document and then transferring funds.”		https://t.co/t5aD52XkXV
“[T]he emperor Hadrian ... added an Egyptian-style temple and a miniature Nile to his famous villa, making him, perhaps, the spiritual father of theme parks and theme restaurants.”		https://t.co/7c6PT7f1U5
“Manufacturers can save up to 75 percent by making their clothes in North Korea”		This is not an advertisement. 		https://t.co/PY1Svd3GC6
A “State Department advisory ... provided the most detailed and comprehensive public listing to date of more than 40 countries and about a dozen industries where North Koreans were employed in 2017 and 2018”		State-sponsored #forcedlabor		https://t.co/8aIt5vg4wC
“7. 2x Liquidation on M&amp;A Outcome”		https://t.co/bb4CgyA7ZE
“In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like that.”		https://t.co/8ZYe8nq8p5
“Auditors can get much more money from bribery than they get from their ‘official’ employer”		This is partly a result of the commodification of audits themselves.		https://t.co/wwmPE5fEJf
“I wonder what private pain would drive a man to turn to the same procedure that ultimately led to the death of his mother.”		https://t.co/pGUKqIMiMx
“Racist invective, misogyny, rape and death threats all hurled at her constantly, unrelentingly, transforming what had been a Cinderella story — The Last Jedi was Tran’s first major film — into a modern-day nightmare.”		Yoda was green, but wasn’t a troll.		https://t.co/lEOruTxMA8

“are workers producing clothes for H&amp;M getting a higher salary, yes or no? And that’s the crux of the question. Everything else is relatively irrelevant fluff.”		https://t.co/EkPUrfe9LU
“There is no evidence that the grievance procedure improved labour conditions in the spinning mills and factory concerned.”		This is the most common complaint I hear about hotlines: they yield a pile of anecdotal data, making trend-analysis difficult. 		https://t.co/LZOHKicopt
“even misinformation and caricature have interesting pedigrees.”		https://t.co/7c6PT7f1U5
“Rip Curl blamed a rogue supplier for outsourcing to ‘an unauthorized subcontractor’”		Entirely plausible, given how much #unauthsubcon goes on, as well as #auditfraud.		https://t.co/yJvfeFiIuc
“Fandom has always been an us versus them proposition.”		https://t.co/lEOruTxMA8
@FubarInFL Exactly. Ideally + &gt;&gt; - by volume. I’ve been historically lazy about measuring both volume and character of feedback. And, consequently, lazy about asking the same measurements from other managers in my team. Solid resource: https://t.co/Vmo1ADOPoT
“The survey, compiled by worker campaign platform Organise, also found that workers felt considerably more anxious after joining Amazon.”		App idea: ‘Workers like you have left Amazon for these companies...’		https://t.co/KQIWJiHqtu
“Understanding a candidate’s desire or hesitation to receive feedback tells you a lot about the person’s expectations.”		Reminds me that I still don’t give enough feedback. #managerguilt		https://t.co/8uemndcHnt
“There is a double burden – the burden of child labour itself and the burden of working on a deadly product that ultimately affects the children themselves.”		I hear tobacco is a pretty nasty plant to deal with, even in the best of circumstances. 		https://t.co/sg9lGzhzYq
“West is shockingly ignorant. Chicago was ‘the murder capital of the world,’ West asserted, when in fact Chicago is not even the murder capital of America.”		Statistics matter.		https://t.co/pGUKqIMiMx
“a supplier was hiding children in industrial ovens during audits (fortunately not turned on)”		A fairly mild example of #auditfraud.		https://t.co/ef3TuZ7LCz
“repeat and overlap audits can be detrimental to their financial sustainability.”		Particularly when there’s so much #auditfraud.		https://t.co/8XBZqbrqDw
“the most prominent blockchain company, Ripple, doesn’t use blockchain in its product. You read that right: the company Ripple decided the best way to move money across international borders was to not use Ripples.”		Anyone at@Ripple to respond?		https://t.co/I2tMs1TNn8
“What if a third party found that 80% of fire doors at another factory were up to code? Is anything less than 100% acceptable?”		Worker-generated benchmarks matter. If workers say a factory is best-in-class, it means something, even if it’s not perfect.		https://t.co/92ugkTeVSa
More key questions for #ethical #blockchain projects: 	"• How is access defined, granted, and executed?	• How is ownership of data defined, granted, and executed?	• How is security set up and ensured?" [2 of 2] https://t.co/O3pDLCvSNt
Key questions for #ethical #blockchain projects: 	"• How is governance created and maintained?	• How is identity defined and established?	• How are inputs verified and transactions authenticated?	..." [1 of 2] https://t.co/HaQXESYdIz
“This is a form of civil, administrative confinement, which means people held in these prisons are not afforded the safeguards of the criminal justice system, such as legal counsel.”		https://t.co/bCVcj7rCPZ
“The companies say they monitor child labour and remove children from the fields to go to school, but experts have told the Guardian that the numbers are going up, not down”		Likely they’re ‘monitoring’ with social audits, rather than continuous feedback.		https://t.co/sg9lGzhzYq
@Unite4_change The short answer is: I’m not sure and I’m super interested in finding out. I have ideas to bring to this from our supply chain work.  Workers, Amazon, and ideally consumers should be able to make simple decisions from reliable worker-generated data.
“[Just as you] get a better grasp of imperial excess at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas than at the Forum in Rome, Grauman’s ... leave-no-surface-behind aesthetic may better conjure ancient-Egyptian esprit than do authentic, faded artifacts”		https://t.co/7c6PT7f1U5
“[T]eam leads must admit their own mistakes and failures and be willing to document these. By setting the example, they will help promote a culture of true growth.”		Should be obvious and ubiquitous, but isn’t.		https://t.co/6ZOHhVrGtt
3 of 5 stars to Start with Why by Simon Sinek https://t.co/vxMXRfhC8q
“There is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.”		Yikes.		https://t.co/IoCkD0Teqs
“three-quarters of fulfilment centre staff are afraid of using the toilet in case they miss their targets.”		Meanwhile, latrine and canteen issues are among the easiest to gather #workerfeedback on.		https://t.co/KQIWJiHqtu
“who can really stop a black god dying to be white?”		I’m Not Black, I’m Kanye	https://t.co/pGUKqIMiMx
“[3] individuals alleged they had been trafficked from Mali as child slaves and forced to work harvesting and/or cultivating cocoa beans on farms in Côte d’Ivoire.”		Post-lawsuit, these companies have to be thinking hard about prevention.		https://t.co/rFFypuQOIH
“no multinational brand or retailer currently claims to pay its garment workers a wage they can subsist on.”		One reason is that they have no continuous monitoring mechanism to verify such claims. Not that they don’t exist—they’re just not using them.		https://t.co/aYobs3yvKq
“CGF’s [2016] Priority Industry Principles on Forced Labour: every worker should have freedom of movement, no worker should pay for a job, [nor] indebted or coerced to work.”		Useful. Next: measure whether and how these principles are being practiced.		https://t.co/iCsNK4DI8f
“Google suggests asking specific questions like:		What went well?	What didn’t go well?	Where did we get lucky?	What can we do differently next time?”		The third one here would be new for our team. Useful. 		https://t.co/6ZOHhVrGtt
“Grievance mechanisms of ETI and SAI fail to benefit young women and girls in the South Indian textile industry”		Showing that there’s more to an effective grievance mechanism than a hotline or multistakeholder initiative. 		https://t.co/JPhlcjP1A9
“The question Americans need to ask themselves next is this: Why are we imprisoning immigrants or asylum seekers at all?”		Don’t stop with family separation. End the whole immigration prison system	https://t.co/bCVcj7rCPZ
“In the United States, responsibly invested assets have been on an upward march since the mid-2000s, climbing to $8.7 trillion in 2016 from $6.6 trillion in 2014, according to the latest Global Sustainable Investment Alliance Review.”		https://t.co/oy8wkk9Oxy

“Atwood ... gives the opening paragraph of the second chapter a menacing power: ‘There must have been a chandelier, once. They’ve removed anything you could tie a rope to.’”		Haunting.		https://t.co/UPBceC21YL
“ESG rankings are often measuring what is convenient, not what’s most meaningful, and they’re doing so based mainly on what companies willingly disclose”		Hence the need for independent, transparent monitoring and benchmarking, not black-box #ESG ratings.		https://t.co/dgJgt14Osz

“Textiles were North Korea’s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million”		This puts brands in a bind, as they need to ensure these don’t contribute state-sponsored #forcedlabor to their products. 		https://t.co/yJvfeFiIuc
“It’s as if getting through the deck is the goal itself, and will free them from the anxiety of getting through it.”		There’s no substitute to listening in effective sales. 		https://t.co/tmKe0RrqET
“A regular operational meeting needs to be crisp and therefore as short as possible.”		https://t.co/YrbmPkxAgN
“naming the specific factory doesn’t actually reveal anything to shoppers about whether it offers workers fair pay and safe conditions”		Since working conditions can change rapidly, a published certification is #ObsoleteByDesign, just like social audits.		https://t.co/92ugkTeVSa
“Each hand could comfortably lift an 8-year-old by the skull.”		Johnson does appear in the betting market odds for the 2020 elections.		https://t.co/E0RUOad1zm
“Factory audits in Asia increased 61% in 2013 from a year earlier”		Likely an artifact of the #RanaPlaza collapse.		https://t.co/8XBZqbrqDw
“Always optimize for getting money soonest (in other words, be greedy) .”		In the best of times, either fundraising is hard, or dangerous, or both.		https://t.co/t5aD52XkXV
“no multinational brand or retailer currently claims to pay its garment workers a wage they can subsist on.”		Seems like there could be a real marketing advantage to the first to make credible claims of a #livingwage.		https://t.co/aYobs3yvKq
3 of 5 stars to Wolves of the Calla by Stephen King https://t.co/btHgmIyMHh
“Teachers, for example, who make a median salary of $72,340 a year, could afford just 0.4 percent of homes in San Francisco”		Which also reflects the relative bargaining power of teachers. 		https://t.co/dZBV1Zv9Wz
“Two by two, they were paired off: Todd, the gun-group founder, and Carolyn, the survivor of the mall shooting.”		These powerful stories reflect what I hear from friends on the practical-gun-control front lines. 		https://t.co/lxGfX1C2l8

“It’s hard to hire your first employee, it’s hard to hire your 50th employee, and it’s still hard to hire your 500th employee.” And your 5th and 10th, in case that’s not obvious.		https://t.co/8uemndcHnt

@vr00n @LaborVoices do eeet 👍
@vr00n @LaborVoices Then, once you overcome the #GIGO (e.g., via @LaborVoices), from that point it's unclear to me what value #blockchain would add to this already-valuable conceptual use-case.
@vr00n @LaborVoices Understood. The example is an apt one, in that the record in question is one of *self-reported data*, and whether the employer was accurate or not in their self-reporting. #Blockchain adds no value here, because #GIGO . The real value-add would be actual independent reporting.
@vr00n @LaborVoices Not dumping on concept (we've been thinking along the same lines for a long time) but rather blockchain's value-add. Reminds me of this old saying... https://t.co/41xtR6mP15
@vr00n @LaborVoices Hm. Don't really see the value-add of blockchain in this case (see article) vs. a private database with a public API. AFAIK, we're the only ones who have unencumbered factory-specific worker-generated data to add, despite my best nudging of compeitors :) https://t.co/aVjkP6s5MC

@CriticTwit @impcapital @LaborVoices @Apple So we're talking about branding. You think abusing workers (or turning a blind eye) is on-brand for AAPL, and I think it's not. Is that accurate? My other issue is just that they end up spending way more to recover from these fiascoes. Smarter to prevent.
@CriticTwit @impcapital @LaborVoices @Apple could be avoiding brand damage, supply chain disruptions, and the obvious PR nightmare. Companies can and do choose intelligence over ignorance and save $Ms. The only way to get it right: Independent. Worker-sourced. Real-time.
