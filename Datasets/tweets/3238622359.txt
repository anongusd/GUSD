@cmclymer Possible,  but no one has ever said Mueller winks. Still inclined to OSC is saying,  'hey, we didn't leak, intentionally or not'. The implications are awful: if OSC did leak, what is left of Mueller's credibility?
@mrsduncan76 @eliehonig As Ken Dilanian just said on MSNBC, it's odd for OSC to say anything. OSC may be simply saying 'Hey, don't look at us, we didn't leak to Buzzfeed. Go look somewhere else'.  So, do we look back at court filings,  or toward a third possible source? ???
@mrsduncan76 @eliehonig Re-read the CNN report of the statement from Robert Mueller's office.  There's something odd about how it's written. The Buzzfeed story isn't said to be wrong, just that the Office of the Special Counsel is not the source of the story.

@Mimirocah1 @SenatorCollins From 1996 Sen Collins presented herself as a moderate Repub.

@themainepain @CNNPolitics I follow Sen King closely to see his reasoned consideration of the issues. And the same for Sen Collins.

@McMasterMclovin @jrpsaki @AmbassadorRice @SenatorHeitkamp @letamericavote Senator Collins passed up a race for Governor of Maine this year so she can run for re-election to the Senate in 2020.

@juliehdavis Trump is afraid of "...professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others." So, we must go back to the days of poster board and magic markers? And, Soros is a new bogeyman because he is a much better businessman than Trump and not a liar about his successes?

@JoyceWhiteVance Hatch is retiring in January, to be replaced (probably) by Mitt Romney, which is a good thought for the day. His dismissive attitude of women &amp; sexual assault is the arrogance of an insensitive senator has sat too long. Does he know or care to know no one who has been assaulted?
@robmsor @BeschlossDC @Lawrence What is striking about the confirmation vote for Mr. Justice Marshall are the 20 Senators who abstained. Why did they vote to abstain? Who were they? 11 Nays do not include all the Southern Senators. The 20 were profiles in cowardice - no courage of conviction to vote up or down.
@ClarkKe95563197 @Mimirocah1 Twitter will not permit me to use the language appropriate to your disgusting comment. Do you know how few law enforcement agencies across this country in the last 200+ years took sexual assault allegations seriously particularly if incest or marital rape? @Mimirocah1  help us.
@RepAdamSchiff The worst part was watching adult women in the audience smiling, laughing, and applauding his verbal assault on Dr. Blasey Ford. As though there are no assaults on women in Mississippi.

@RepSwalwell Sir: You are bad, Bad, BAD!!!
@DavidJollyFL In the age of #MeToo it is completely appropriate that the final make-or-break decision on BK's nomination lays on Senators Collins and Murkowski. If other undeclared Senators join them, the rejection of this nomination will be a thunderclap heard across the USA.
@matthewamiller @amyklobuchar Senators Klobuchar and Hirono are eloquent and forceful manner. Giants of the Senate.
@ZerlinaMaxwell Senator Graham's 'speech' was pure staged theater done to seize the cameras and change the narrative. Disgusting. And an example of why DC is so politically divided. Personal recommendation: Senator Graham needs a very large injection of Valium in his ass.
@chrislhayes She said her worst memory is the two boys laughing as they went down the stairs. Thankfully she was not in the chamber today when the GOP senators sat there together laughing.
@jdawsey1 And Senator Booker asked if BK considered Dr. Ford to be a political pawn of a conspiracy. BK did not answer the question.
@ZerlinaMaxwell I am too angry to respond except to say today was no better than the Anita Hill hearings.
@JoyceWhiteVance @Mimirocah1 @mitchellreports @11thHour 	My sincere thanks for your professional legal and personal women (not female) responses to Dr. Ford's testimony today. We could say, yes, you bent, but you did not break. Her testimony rang true for we who cared to hear.
@duffymyboy @YogaKaline @michaelbikales @woodruffbets I have often been yelled at in anger by friends who say "why do you freeze?" Because I cannot fight back - I am too weak. Nor can I flee - the punishment will be so much worse when they catch me. So, even today well older than Dr Ford, I freeze. I have no choice. Ever.
@washingtonpost Nunes is back? I thought he was still in Europe. None of his constituents has seen him in years. But once he grabs the microphone, he mangles the truth for the sole purpose of propping up a president who will be found to have colluded/conspired with Russia. Nunes is a hack.
@JillWineBanks @Mimirocah1 @NBCNews @davidgura As many of us, men and women, have said there is nothing like the MSNBC juggernaut of women lawyers. The best advantage besides their brilliance is that they are passionate prosecutors who believe in the rule of law under the Constitution @BarbMcQuade @JoyceWhiteVance @mayawiley
@NatashaBertrand Following Malcolm Nance, the Times story on Friday simply smelled wrong (my verb). Why would the Times attack the only person protecting Mueller from Trump by writing an article based solely on anonymous sources? Trump needed a diversion from BK. He got it.
@MalcolmNance If it turns out to be a setup of 'anonymous' sources, Trump scores twice: 1) the New York Times is once again tarred with the brush of 'fake news' and 2) if the story is true, Trump has a perfect reason to fire Rod Rosenstein. My bet: the venerable New York Times was outfoxed.Sad
@politico After Senator McCain's death, we watched Lindsey Graham lose his spine. Now we have seen him lose his brain and his sense of justice. My apologies to Dr Ford for facing such a man.
@thehill How many people are afraid to remember the girls who were in a "family way" and were sent to live with Aunt So-and-so? I went to a public high school of less than 500 students outside Washington DC in 60s and know of 5 girls who were suddenly missing. But the guys were real studs
@SenWhitehouse The Dead White Republican Men on the Senate Judiciary Comm. are not treating Dr Blasey Ford with the basic respect due any witness. She is under considerable stress preparing to relieve the most horrible event in her life. Not even a one-day delay? What will they do to her next?
@Mimirocah1 Thank you @Mimirocah1 for roaring back at Guiliani. He deserved your 'read my lips' comment. But our frustrations are only relieved until his own next fake news.
@JoyceWhiteVance @Mimirocah1 @mayawiley @JillWineBanks @BarbMcQuade If K withdraws, it is not for the sake of his family, but for the sake of his own skin. He will never be able to stay scrutiny in the glare of broad daylight. Nor, permit his sanctimonious ego to be scarred.
@roddreher Why do you see a difference between 'sexually humiliating' and 'not sex'? The threat can be more horrifying that the act for many people. You don't hold their actions against them? That means you are still bullied and have not begun to deal with the trauma. Boys are NOT boys.
@thehill Rather focus on Trump investigation than your own involvement with the OSU investigation? So, a Representative with a brush at a minimum with a sex scandal thinks it can be brushed off.  Oh, it doesn't really matter, everyone concerned was a guy.
@AriMelber What is remarkable is not just her intellectual prowess but her wonderful sense of humor which she maintains in the darkest moments. And, "Is this normal?"

@SenFeinstein Senator Feinstein, Would you or a Democratic colleague tell Mr Kavanaugh that the hearing is a job interview. YOU ask the questions, HE answers them. If his answers are incomplete or  predisposed to grant Pres Trump a get-out-of-jail-free card, then he doesn't get the job.
@SenKamalaHarris Senator Harris, Your question certainly hit below the belt. High ouch factor. From all of us thinking guys, thank you.
@PeterAlexander @frankthorp I'll bet Mr Kavanaugh squirmed physically at that question like men do when their bodies are threatened. Senator Harris nailed him!
@KamalaHarris Senator Harris, please keep doggedly pushing.
@Mimirocah1 @SenKamalaHarris Mr Kavanaugh dummies up for every question he possibly can, claiming no knowledge or memory he does not remember (vide Marc Kassowitz). And, this is the mind that has been nominated for the SCOTUS? Kudos to Senator Harris!
@SenFeinstein Can K be confirmed if there is any question that he is telling the truth? A judge who lies to get a job is eligible to judge the laws and people of this country in context of our Constitution? I think not.
@frankthorp @BenSasse As another reply said, caucus this once to oppose a SCOTUS nominee who was chosen solely because he believes that the president is above the law. In a sense Trump is trying to pack the Court for his own CYA. That is why Madison et al. created limits on the office of the POTUS.
@thehill Why would Senator Graham care about Roe v. Wade? He's single and wealthy. On Tuesday he was no more capable of speaking in full paragraphs than Trump, leading to disjointed thoughts about  everything especially Roe. Sad fall for a Senator who used to be thoughtful and articulate.
@SenFeinstein @fred_guttenberg At the least how could a nominee for the most august court rudely turn his back on a man who was invited to the hearing? Why did K. think he had the right to have Mr Guttenberg removed from the chamber? Arrogant attitude &amp; behavior by the friendly soccer dad K is portrayed to be.
@NatashaBertrand @CNN How does Kavanaugh have any authority to remove a guest of the committee from the hearing chamber? The soccer dad is an arrogant ... Military guns cannot be banned because they are in common use? K. showed his regard for a father's pain. Not a decent candidate for confirmation.
@UMsportstalk Everyone needs to remember that it is a four-quarter game. Playing catch-up all the time is a losing game plan.
@jamiegangel @joshscampbell Not only was there probably a bath yesterday so he would look beautiful for the other beach-goers, BUT there is a serious bath in his pre-dinnertime future to get the sand and salt out of his coat. Though we must say a wonderful day was had by all. Love all Pembroke Corgis.
@samstein Agree - @susancollins call for those documents. That's what any true Mainer would do. As a Republican Senator, you have the standing to force Senator McConnell and President Trump's hand.
@TheRickWilson I've lived in Virginia too long to give any credence to malicious comments by @KenCuccinelli . To suggest a reconsideration is far more polite than I could ever be after @MeghanMcCain eulogy.
@Mimirocah1 @BarbMcQuade Once more @BarbMcQuade and @Mimirocah1  have taken a law journal essay and made the topic not  only understandable by non-lawyers, but explained how Trump is destroying the rule of law. As always my thanks.
@NatashaBertrand Does Nunes understand that he is supposed to be running a re-election campaign and providing constituent services?  Check out @JanzforCongress .
@BetoORourke @graciela__villa Go Beto! Beat Ted.
@BrianKarem @evanvucci @realDonaldTrump The Rosemary Woods two-hands stretch with a half-over-the-shoulder blind block.
@tribelaw @neeratanden @tribelaw Professor Tribe, Thank you for your succinct, spot-on statement. Trump's name and actions will outlive our culture much as the names of shameful actors from previous cultures are remembered among the fallings of that society.
@joshscampbell @eliehonig 4/to relearn their responsibilities to our Democracy? This perhaps Second Reconstruction will take longer than the post-Civil War Reconstruction. It should be a profound lesson for our country to recognize how little non-physical violence it takes to nearly destroy ourselves.
@joshscampbell @eliehonig 3/that protect our foundation? Respect for institutions like the FBI, the Department of Justice, even the very workings of every part of our government which has been suborned? How long will it take for the House of Representatives and the Senate
@joshscampbell @eliehonig 2/for the elements of our secular, liberal democracy are under attacks which are broader based than the violence of the mob. How long will it take for respect for our foundation documents to return? And, how long will it take for respect for the institutions
@joshscampbell @eliehonig 1/With all possible respect, the responses to @NatashaBertrand article particularly @eliehonig important note based upon his trial experience, there is violence here, violence against our institutions. The loss of respect for the Constitution, its Amendments,
@cindymccain Senator John McCain is the gold standard of bravery, honesty, humor, collegiality, and common decency. He is the embodiment of an American.
@bryna_elder @BarbMcQuade @JoyceWhiteVance @JillWineBanks And @Mimirocah1 	Add in a couple of guys too - MSNBC is loaded with brilliant people on both sides of the desk.
@Mimirocah1 As always, you analysis  cuts straight to the point. Our hope lies with Robert Mueller. We may not be able to depend upon the Federal courts in light of Don McGahan's successful  oversight of the Republican court nominee process.
@TheBeatWithAri Ari? Always watch you. Bannon? Never watch him. Ever. Ari, I hope you are on at your regular time tonight so your producer and scheduler can Fall Back.
@EdKrassen @Comey @AmbassadorRice @JohnBrennan @GenMhayden @SallyQYates @petestrzok Finally, Trump joins Nixon with an enemies list. Though without Nixon's subtlety. Congratulations to those on the list. And patience to those not yet so honored - your time will come.
@KatyTurNBC No mistake about it - you earned every credit of it. Congratulations!
@Mimirocah1 By Omarosa? Are there no standards left? I thought MSNBC was above such behavior. I'm sorry you were bumped - your legal analysis is remarkable for non-lawyers like me.
@matthewamiller Enjoy your vacation wherever it is
@JoyceWhiteVance @pgh_law Sadly chazars are everywhere - check out Trump's cabinet. But, paskudnyik is reserved for the Big Kahuna.
@BarbMcQuade @maddow @MSNBC Always spot-on. Thank you. GO BLUE!
@JuliaEAinsley @jacobsoboroff Thank you @JuliaEAinsley and @jacobsoboroff . Without your reporting, how much longer would the suffering of these children gone on? And, who and how will we repay the cruelty done to the parents whom the children no longer recognize and are not comfortable with. Great reporting.
@AriMelber @maddow @nickakerman @JoyceWhiteVance @danielsgoldman @LawProfButler Looks like a plethora of attorneys! Great scheduling.
@Mimirocah1 @DeadlineWH @jheil Mimi, Prosecutor must above all else know people. Obviously, you do. Thank you, Jim	p.s. what kind of cake was it???
@JohnJHarwood Lies just like Dad.
@krassenstein Reminder to Trump per Chuck Rosenberg: When you arrive in Russia, you will be separated from your children who will be declared ineligible to be returned to their mothers. Enjoy the invitation.
@PhilipRucker And does the invitation include a nice home on the Black Sea as a gift to Trump for a job well-done?
@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP @EricSwalwell You've been sounding the alarms for months. The revelations are coming so fast it's hard to keep up. Yesterday's decision by a judge to let the emoluments case go forward together with Michael Cohen's cooperation should shake the Oval Office to its hollow core.
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Richard Nixon had an enemies list. People felt insulted if their names were not on it. Wish a simple, retired, life-long Democrat had a chance to get on a soon to be very long list. Oh, Putin is the editor-in-chief.
@capseyes_cappy @TahoeBoulder @PhilipRucker LOL
@JSCveritas @PhilipRucker @POTUS While he did nothing to teach these high school kids a single lesson in civics and civility. Disgusting.
Sign up for news of your district and your nearest swing district. I have family in NJ-05. Guess who I signed up for? Plus my own nearest VA-10. Everything helps esp knowing more about swing seats. https://t.co/InklvEQwY1
@BarbMcQuade @UMichLaw No finer place to be, any season, any year, every year. GO BLUE!
@mckaycoppins Is any one concerned with the basic premise that NO country has a right to interfere in our election process? The Trump v. Hillary contest should have been decided on it merits and not with focused ads placed in WI, MI, and PA and other states to swing the election for Trump.
.@MarkWarner Vote NO on Senator Barrasso‚Äôs Bill to eviscerate the Endangered Species Act! We must protect the ESA: it‚Äôs our best tool to save American animals. (via @SaveAnimals)
.@timkaine Vote NO on Senator Barrasso‚Äôs Bill to eviscerate the Endangered Species Act! We must protect the ESA: it‚Äôs our best tool to save American animals. (via @SaveAnimals)
@JubinvilleTim @JanzforCongress Why wouldn't he? The American teams see him for what he is, a bold-type racist. BUT, go Croatia. Did Devin slash his wrists.
@NatashaBertrand Are we surprised? Four Rep Senators go to Moscow on our most important holiday,  the 4th of July, to meet with Russian leaders, but not Putin. Given the revelations that the sanctions are working, it is revealing that now another Senator other than Rand Paul supports Putin.
@Mimirocah1  As so many others have said in the last day, your Friday indictment events are wonderful. Even better is your growing rapport and confidence with all your collaborators throughout the day. Thank you - SDNY's loss is @MSNBC and the American people's gain.
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Chuck Rosenberg explained the action of the former U.S. Attorneys General in clear and quiet terms.  We saw a man in great pain for the immigrant families and heard in his tightly spoken anger a man trying to deal with the cruelty of the president and his lackeys. Thank you  sir.
@SenKamalaHarris The Secretary of DHS does not know where the girls and infants + toddlers are? Ms. Nielsen, you are clueless about this situation. You are responsible morally if not legally for every incidence of physical abuse as well as mental. Firing you is too light a sentence.
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @GenMhayden showed graphically what the Texas detention centers are really all about. Now we have what the sounds were like at Auschwitz as families were broken up.
@NicolleDWallace This is sickening, but probably not a singular rape. Where are all the children? Who knows? Certainly not Secretary Nielsen who yesterday said she did not know. Her abdication of authority and responsibility. Trump: account for the children and not by an "audit".
@DeadlineWH @HeidiPrzybyla @NicolleDWallace ISIS took hostages including women and children. Though not under the guise of processing immigrants as illegals for return to their homelands. Trump and Sessions' zero-tolerance policy on immigration. Our autocrat-in-the-making has now gone beyond all measure of inhumanity.
@RobertAngelo @SenJohnMcCain @TopherSpiro The Senator has come back to Washington before to cast a significant vote. And, until he chooses to resign, the opening is there for more votes. Senator McCain is still a United States Senator, one of 100  You do not understand what he stands for.
@Nanbp @Mimirocah1 @chrislhayes @danielsgoldman @harrylitman It was an exciting panel. Three great brainy lawyers/prosecutors who know the law forward and back. The chemistry was great as was the sense of humor in the midst of watching a train wreck.
@MSNBCPR @Mimirocah1 @NBCNews @MSNBC @allinwithchris Glad to see that MSNBC has added another quiet, dead-on SDNY alumna. See you more often I hope.
@realDonaldTrump Senator Tester is a good and honorable man who represents the State of Montana well. Your diatribes against Senator Tester are unfounded as well as your threats to release 'things' you have on him. Your're mad: Senator Tester showed that your staff did not vet Dr. Jackson..
@DavidJollyFL  Mrs. Bush was grace, dignity, and humor enclosing a center of honesty and love of family. Sturdy like New England itself. I wish her well.
@BrendonMcNamara @KevinShkolnik @NateSilver538 Let's see... Mozart, Einstein, and thousands of men and women who started their innovative contributions to society before the artificial number of 18, an artificial high jump between non-sentient and sentient humans. Give them credit. These kids are fantastic, whether 16 or 18.
@didahous @AlexWitt @MSNBC Either Joy or Alex with another MSNBC anchor gives we viewers brilliant reporting and analysis.		My sincere thanks to every one at MSNBC!
@SteveKornacki  Hope your Wounded Paw is on the mend. You did a fantastic job on Tuesday night. Especially with paper in your mouth, pen on your paw (or was it a calculator or even a pizza - it was really big), and board wand in your good hand. Liked the photo nextday in hospital
@PhilipRucker @mattzap Thank you Mr. McCabe for learning from your friend  Mr. Comey: memorialize, copy, give to Mr. Mueller. Oh, how lucky are we to have intelligent men and women in the FBI, on Mr. Mueller's staff, and in the Real News. Thank you Mr. Rucker (and Ms. Parker too)!
@brady_dennis @PhilipRucker @eilperin If Pruitt is so compulsive about privacy and security, why doesn't he pay for it himself? The next dictator, er, director (unless a Republican) will have to tear it out in the interests of the paying public - us.
@TODAYshow @PeterAlexander @IvankaTrump Ivanka has a desk, an office, and a title (senior adviser to the president). We have every right to ask questions about her boss the president even if her boss is her father. No questions are off limits before, during, and after her father's campaign and election. Man Up lady!
@ErikWemple @CPAC Beyond despicable. Disgusting and paranoid.
@TheBeatWithAri @RepMikeQuigley @AriMelber Ari, What is Nunes FSB Badge number? He's more effective than it seemed possible for someone with a limited IQ. Nunes, yours is the face of a fellow-traveler. Impeach, Indict, Convict, Blindfold. Big decision: Shoot or Hang. Thank you @RepMikeQuigley
@MichelleRindels @GovSandoval First, Steve Wynn files for unemployment. Now, Trump feels the need to prove again that he is an insecure, third-world, tin-plated (fill in the blank). That mild shaking in your knees is not too much coffee. It's Nevadans leaving the state. Nevadans, you deserve much better
@TwitterMoments @Adaripp Maybe the super brave act as the first out gay American skater had something to do with it. For the judges in their isolated fur coated igloo, gay and fantastic equals third place. Just enough to give him a medal, just not the one he deserved. GO ADAM!
@dceiver @anamariecox My God, hit only once, molested only once, fell down the stair only once, once, once, once.	ONCE matters, ONCE is once too many.
@kdunnachie @anamariecox Where do these gorgeous puppies live, just in case they are interviewing four-foots for a change of zipcode. Oh, my zipcode is 20109.
Subtext: fine men like me, read as dead-white-men who being out-numbered by dark men who can never be fine men like we dead-insensitive-white men. https://t.co/57Owx7ps9G
@PhilipRucker What can Melania be thinking as she hears the dead-white-man excuse her husband says? Do we give Trump a pass for his documented disgusting behavior just as he has given his two former employees, er, wife beaters? Do you DT ever speak the truth? Women are real people., you aren't
@JoyAnnReid Absolutely horrendous! I wasn't looking at my TV when I heard Dr. King's voice. It was an ad using Dr. King's as a voice over. Money is not the question. A gross ethical misuse of Dr. King's words and voice are the issue. Dodge, I hope your sales for the RAM tank.
@spencerwoodman Thank you Mr. Perez for your brave service to your country. To Trump and ICE: get your hands off Mr. Perez. Forever.
@AriMelber What can be next? East Coast tsunami? Blizzard in Hawaii? The more I think about my question and what I know of Trump, everything and nothing can be next. Damn Nunes the Pet Puppy. Thank you Ari and all at MSNBC.
@247Wolverines The helmet? No way!
@RepSwalwell Thank you
@AlexJayBrady @goldengateblond @joanwalsh @MSNBC I've waited to let the dust settle to add my thoughts. MR LACK ARE YOU AN IDIOT? Twice over? Firing Joan Walsh who personified qualified journalism? You want to move MSNBC to the right? Afraid to stand up for liberal values? Who is next to be fired? Rachel (Emmys)? Joy (color)?
@joanwalsh @maddow The tributes don't mention your smile as you shoot holes at Trump. Your bosses want to move MSNBC to the political center. away from traditional Liberalism? Do your former bosses think the honorable path is to move to the Right when we need a Liberal voice? They are sadly wrong!
@VanityFair Well, now Fox News has a hate-mate: Vanity Fair. What has Hilary achieved?  More than the accumulated 'achievements' of the entire Vanity. She needs a new hobby because she lost the 2016 elections? You folks need a new hobby that does permit you to use any writing implements.
@JoyAnnReid re: @Joan Walsh. We were worried for Mueller's safety during the days Congress and Trump's staff were on (Merry)  Christmas Holiday! Who knew the the Christmas surprise would be a blindsided move by MSNBC management. Evil forces at work.
