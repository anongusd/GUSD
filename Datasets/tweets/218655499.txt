#COABE14 BDM:  We hope that once we have a national plan, we will know more about funding.
#COABE14 Will HPOG grants continue?   Over 20,000 students are receiving services.  OCTAE isn't sure about future $ but we've learned A LOT!
#COABE14 Use data with policymakers, in ebulletins, and with press and media.
#COABE14 Engagement sessions heard from Community Based programs as well.  They are on the ground and in the neighborhoods.
#COABE14 BDM asked participants how they are using the PIAAC data?
#COABE14 BDM:  Include the adult learners.  They have important feedback.
#COABE14 US Conference of Mayors are concerned with the quality of life in their communities.
#COABE14 BDM:  "Aren't we all about making sure we have strong communities"
#COABE14 BDM:  We need to include our local policymakers.  Be ready to challenge them -- use the PIAAC data to help make the case.
#COABE14 BDM:  Thanked @azsuitts for holding a roundtable in Tucson.
#COABE14 BDM:  Employers want to be engaged in meaningful ways.  They want to help.
#COABE14 BDM:  We have to draw attention to the # of low skilled adults.  We have to work with business and utilize technology.
#COABE14 BDM:  participants also appreciated the diversity of engagement session participants.  Networking was happening!
#COABE14 BDM:  At Regional Engagement Sessions, partnerships were emphasized.
#COABE14 BDM:  Go ahead and continue to provide feedback to OCTAE even though the March 14th deadline has passed.
#COABE14 BDM:  Engagement sessions were held all over the country -- despite weather and shut downs.
#COABE14 BDM: OCTAE made specific plans to solicit feedback from stateholders at engagement sessions, especially from students and teachers.
#COABE14 Look for volunteers everywhere.  Find students who need to do service learning.
#COABE14 Volunteer organizations should be embraced.  There are great models that help supplement classroom instruction.
#COABE14 How will workplace literacy be included?  Engage the employers.
#COABE14 Look to your College of Social Work or Faith based organizations for case management help.
#COABE14 Mental health issues are critical too.  OCTAE held a roundtable around this issue in February.
#COABE14 Wrap around services are critical in the success of students.  This is part of the career pathways model.
#COABE14 My Brother's Keeper initiative will include AE.
#COABE14 There will be research funds available for field research too.
#COABE14 President's budget includes research money.  OCTAE will make sure that students are front and center in that research.
#COABE14 AE Programs can make sure that foundational skills are included in trainings and that they are assessing skills correctly.
#COABE14 We need to make sure on the job training is effective.  Bring in Adult Educators to co-teach.
#COABE14 Questions:  Are we training adults in the right way if our literacy rates aren't going up?  We need more research to see what works
#COABE14  40% are getting some sort of training, but they want more of it.
#COABE14  Low skilled population is working, but not in living wage jobs.
#COABE14  Many low skilled adults rated their health as poor or fair.  It is an issue in the classroom.
#COABE14 2/3 of low skilled population are men.
#COABE14  1/3 of low skilled population where immigrants.  We need to do a better job of integrating them in U.S.
#COABE14	People from low economic levels continue to have issues. There is hope.
