@TxHistComm That's an amazing woman!
@rjhoward45 Correct!  While it's commonly called the "Duck Stamp", geese and swans count too 🙂 Each year five waterfowl species are chosen for the contest; this year it's wood duck, American wigeon, northern pintail, green-winged teal and lesser scaup. More info: https://t.co/O7fCBerTrZ
@C_killaman Depending on where you ordered it from, it can take up to six weeks. If you send me a message with the info, I'll try to help you out.
Happy New (#DuckStamp) Year! The 2018-19 Duck Stamps go on sale Friday, they're valid from from July 1 to next June 30. Beautiful artwork, and the sales go to protecting #wetlands--almost 6 million acres so far! https://t.co/qFjAiyg2k4 https://t.co/SzzMIf6PAb

Horseshoe crabs take about 10 years to reach sexual maturity (about 17 molts). Adults will gather on beaches to spawn, often under the full or new moon. Please if you can, take time to help these animals when you see them flipped or stranded. https://t.co/9EjcINu0rX

@Neaglereporter The range for how much an average black bear weighs is pretty large... ~200-600lbs. So we feel safe in saying this is an average size bear. :)
In addition to their travels in search of a mate, bear sightings in residential areas may also increase as bears search for food. Not to worry, they aren’t looking for humans! Black bears are attracted to backyards with bird feeders, pet food or garbage cans that are not secured. https://t.co/ivzDWtOrp3
Black bears are especially active this time of year, and for a couple primary reasons: food and breeding. Searching for mates means the bears are spending more time in open spaces during daylight hours - which is not how they are the rest of the year. https://t.co/MZEK81yk5r https://t.co/FlZeQaOoSQ

Fish need to move! To find food, find places to spawn and find places to hide or rest - fish need aquatic connections between all of these areas. There are over 6-million human-made barriers keeping fish from where they need to go to grow and survive? https://t.co/tzfsnnJTRT https://t.co/2Sg4pyynwU
Ravens have been recorded making over 20 different categories of vocalizations, which are used for social interactions, alarm calls, chase calls and fight calls. They are also skilled mimics. More on the remarkable raven: https://t.co/hILZkouHQf https://t.co/UPVmGjwUhr

Right now, lots of turtles are traveling to find food, mates and lay eggs. Tips if you see one in the road: https://t.co/W52uA26DWK https://t.co/6G2TBqJkFV
The leatherback seaturtle is our largest living species. Weighing up to 1,900lbs and reaching 244cm (~8ft). #WorldTurtleDay https://t.co/JUEdz84SMk
The bog turtle is one of the world's smallest turtle species. It's shell length is less than 12cm. #WorldTurtleDay https://t.co/8UxKVObVNQ
Different turtle lifestyles determine their shells. Land turtles have high-vaulted shells and water turtles have more streamlined ones. https://t.co/EAPR1mNZFn
@xaeromarine A turtle's shell is fused to its vertebra and ribs. So it's not removablez
All living turtles lack teeth, lay shelled eggs, mature slowly (been there!) and the adults can live a long time (sometimes over 150 yrs). https://t.co/HSgCoI5VpV
@sandlinjake Is it now? ;) 🐢🐢🐢🐢
The carapace and plastron is generally comprised of anywhere between 50-60 bones. #worldturtleday https://t.co/D4vt6fV9BQ

@marySAMSmith @NewYorker We're glad people are asking the questions they have. Here's a link to the photo:  https://t.co/RcoMYIhaXX
@marySAMSmith @NewYorker It is actually a California Mountain King Snake. We understand confusion but that's why we're here. To discuss and help with misinformation.
@GundelsheimDill @NewYorker The story is about a wildlife trafficker who was caught with king snakes, not about venomous snakes.
@marySAMSmith @NewYorker Please read the story. It's about trafficking king snakes (and getting busted for doing so).
Illegally keeping snakes in his closet did not end well for this reptile trafficker: https://t.co/iR1sVfxGF7 via @NewYorker (📷 by NPS) https://t.co/josNqC3hY7
