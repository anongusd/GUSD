“A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.” Michael Cohen		Wow.
“Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ‘greatest infomercial in political history.’ He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign – for him – was always a marketing opportunity.” Michael Cohen
It’s interesting, Cohen’s testimony includes language that all of the Republicans used against Trump when he got into the presidential race. https://t.co/eW4C7qbEui

RT @jonathanvswan: Must have been a different speech. https://t.co/m1LKxEHXlp
I think the most confounding and infuriating thing about the Trump speech is that there was no new information, nothing he hasn’t said at a rally, in a presser, or on Twitter. 		This was a complete waste of time for the sake of the president getting attention and having airtime.
A misleading set of statements.		Immigrants have a lower occurrence of criminal behavior than the average citizen.
Two Lies, One (long) Sentence:		1) Law enforcement never requested this wall or the money.		2) Democrats never requested the new steel wall.
Also, this “crisis” being a “humanitarian” issue is new for Trump. Mike Pence brought that one out this morning.
First sentence, first lie: “There is a growing humanitarian and security crisis.”		It’s not growing, it’s the lowest it’s been in over 40 years. And it’s steadily trended down since 2000.

@sharonwaxman @TheWrap Also, you imply that race is a diversity issue, not an equity issue. It is indeed both. Equity is about power-share and who has access to it.
@sharonwaxman @TheWrap This is a “whatabout” of a different topic for *you*, but this is an every-day topic for me and for all the people of color, including women, who are members of the press, almost always relegated to freelance contributing in this industry’s trades.
This is based on the masthead published on your website (as of 1:00 p.m.), listing your writers, editors, producers, &amp; execs. 		@sharonwaxman, anyone can read for themselves, on your website: https://t.co/BcFmJ5zBgT
3. I’m not sure what’s counterproductive about the question I asked. I didn’t blame OR shame, I observed, researched, and simply noted what is.		Also, it’s not “counterproductive” when we agree that #TimesUp, but when the critique of equity is through a racial lens it is? https://t.co/5nhe2HcCdA
2. Presumptions *would* be irresponsible, you’re right. 		That’s why I researched each person listed on your masthead. https://t.co/5nhe2HcCdA
1. As an advocate for journalists, I’m primarily focused on the team that is concerned w/ voice &amp; tone of stories being shared.		If my numbers and analysis are are wrong, please provide the correct data on your editorial and managing staff. Thank you. https://t.co/5nhe2HcCdA
For the record: @SharonWaxman and @TheWrap are “very proud of the diversity of [their] staff, and [their] critics.” According to their masthead, this is what their editorial staff and executive team look like.		A nearly 90% white staff.		“Diversity” to be “very proud” of? https://t.co/0wGNsRycHa
Trump’s apparently found his way to the Press Briefing Room podium... that’s new(s).

https://t.co/QvF8aBSRrY
17/I’ve got more smiles than I can hold onto to. 	I love you.	You’re never alone. 		Finally, whatever you do, please keep going. 		My very best wishes and may you have the happiest new year.		@ToriKelly’s Never Alone ft. @kirkfranklin:	https://t.co/XyzJusYzwZ
16/My mom has always said: “If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours.” My sister, Spirit, used to host a radio show she’d end every night with “if no one’s told you today, I want you to hear it from me that I love you.”
15/Finally, if you can’t relate to any of this and you’re still reading, someone in your life may need your shoulder, may benefit from the lending of your ear, or just a bit of your time to be reminded they have support.
14/You may have cried many rivers.	You’ve walked through more than enough of the pain.	Your world may have completely crumbled.	I know how it feels to carry that shame.	But even when you can’t hear that Voice calling you, you’re never alone.
13/“Everybody wants to be king //	We put all our hope inside material things //	In Your light I now understand 	That everything I have ain’t everything that I am.”
12/Trust me, I know each of them inside and out, forward and backward, up the front and down the back. 		But please, always know, that whether you believe in the All or think it’s all a sham, you’re never alone.
11/The holidays, the end of the year and the start of another can be hard. If you’re missing someone, something or  if you’re not where you want to be - physically, spiritually, financially, emotionally, mentally or otherwise.
10/Sometimes whatever you turn to, rely on, call out for feels distant, feels quiet, or not even available when you need it. Sometimes the pilot light feels like it’s gone out and your fire just won’t start.
9/@torikelly’s song I found today said:		“Cried many rivers //	Walked through some pain //	Seen my world crumble //	And I’ve carried the shame.		“I know somebody //	He calls me His own //	I can hear Heaven singing out //	Oooh, you’re never alone.”
8/ You may call him, her or it something(s) else. Or you may call it nothing at all.
7/But sometimes, sometimes there’s a peace and a faith to find inside, whether incited by a prayer, a meditation, a song, a poem, a think-piece whatever it is to remind me I’m still on the right path, to keep me going. I move between calling it God, The Universe, The All.
6/The support of friends, the backing of family, at times someone to cuddle with at night have all been something great to help in a dark time, but even those aren’t helpful or fulfilling in the darkest of times.
5/I’ve been alone, I’ve dated, I’ve been hurt, let down, felt broken, damaged and lonely.
4/I’ve spent so much time in quiet, pained by some and thoroughly enjoying other solitude, time with myself. I’ve hosted more people at my dinner table than every year prior combined - sometimes without money to figure out dinner the next day.
3/This year has had some high highs, but more low lows. I’ve had people come into and leave my life, I’ve seen babies born and people I love go. I’ve challenged things I’ve allowed and grown passed some of my own pain.
2/I started to reshare something I wrote a few days ago that seemed to resonate with many of you.		But then, literally an hour ago, I came across a song in a stumbled-upon playlist that said everything I’ve felt, experienced, needed this year.
1/I spent this whole morning wondering what kind of thing I could write to wish this year a farewell, to welcome the next, and try to encourage you even just a little bit. I couldn’t really find a first word to write, never able to even start whatever it’d be.

Kavanaugh's resistance to Mark Judge testifying and to Feinstein's question of an FBI investigation makes him look guilty dot com.
Also, to echo many: the resistance to FBI investigations by Kavanaugh, The White House and Senate Republicans definitely makes me lean toward believing Dr. Ford's accounts of events, considering she's been insistent that they check what she's said. https://t.co/rjFoshzkyi
I'll say this: If this whole thing never happened, Dr. Ford is lying, and Kavanaugh has been unfairly accused it's an awful thing to happen to a man's life. 		But, based on these two pieces of testimony alone, it's hard to discredit Dr. Ford's accounts, composure vs. his.

@kendisgibson Naw, it sounded great in here. 	Best thing all night.

That may be a part of why it feels so dead...? I’m really not sure.
For inside-the-room context at the #BETAwards:		There’s no music in the break, it’s silent in here for the audience.		There’s usually - at other live shows (though this is my first BET Awards) - an audience warmer, music playing, something... 		Jamie just came out, is talking.
@shiena_143 The crowd was pretty loud for her in here.
First: I’m a big Nicki fan.		That said: 	A: I still don’t get this Chun Li.		B:  Didn’t we just do that same performance of this song somewhere else, like... very recently?		C: I think what I want from Nicki at this point is for her to actually be saying something.		 #BETAwards

Now that he’s speaking about pain... it’s... not clear what the pain is about. The accusation, the death, the murders... 	#DidOJConfess
At no point in this interview has OJ even hinted at a sadness, a pain, even a longing for his dead wife that - according to him - some person came and slaughtered at her home. 	#DidOJConfess
The disassociation is scary.		OJ: It’s hard to understand that people could believe I was capable of murdering two people.		This after he just described how he murdered two people.		And how he did the same about being a batterer, after describing battering his wife. #DidOJConfess
@kyliejo AND because Darren’s role in him trying it on during the trial.
@kyliejo Because the glove ended up being such a moment, “if it doesn’t fit you must acquit.” People believed that, saw the glove being too small as proof it couldn’t have been OJ.
Interesting that he said, when asked about when he cut his finger he starts with “...and this is the truth.” Proceeding to tell of smashing a glass upon learning of Nicole’s death. 		A curious, unprompted, unnecessary assertion or distinction. #DidOJConfess
Laura(?): “Do you remember that?”		OJ: “Ummm, yes I do.”		That is NOT a hypothetical question, or a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical memory. 	#DidOJConfess
I can’t picture, imagine, concept in my mind an innocent man, wrongly accused, tried, acquitted, living w/ the cloud of doubt hovering over his life doing shit like this.		Doing an interview, describing what he’d hypothetically done, not trying to clear their name. #DidOJConfess
This glove conversation is... interesting... especially considering Christopher Darden is sitting there. And his involvement with the infamous glove, it’s significant moment in the trial. 		So... interesting. I can’t find the words. #DidOJConfess
THIS IS INSANE.	THIS IS INSANE.		“I remember grabbing the knife, I do remember that part...”		THIS IS INSANE.	THIS IS INSANE.	#DidOJConfess
OJ: “I must’ve dropped the glove because they found it at the scene...” 		“I blacked out... I don’t remember” what else happened. 		NOT hypothetical. 	#DidOJConfess
“I don’t think any two people could’ve been murdered the way they were” and everyone not been covered in blood. 		A) Comepletely disassociated.	B) NOT hypothetical. 	#DidOJConfess
“I do remember reaching for the knife...” #DidOJConfess 		That’s not hypothetical.
OJ: “if you read the book, you’ll see some thing that happened...”		NOT in the hypothetical. #DidOJConfess
I don’t even know what “this is hypothetical” means I’m this context, because none of these verbs are “I may have,” “I could have,” “I would have,” but “In the hypothetical, I put on a cap and gloves.”		She: “You looked through the window?”		He: “I don’t recall...”	#DidOJConfess
OJ: She was acting like she was in high school, dating younger guys... at some point it was inappropriate.		Also OJ: I started pursuing an 18-year-old girl, while I was still married, and 12 years older than her. #DidOJConfess
@MajorCastingLLC He didn’t deserve to be left out there looking like that.
I’ve decided not to address Chris Darden’s Trump-length necktie. Just not going to even bring it up. #DidOJConfess
OJ: When they’d asked if I’d ever been physical with her, she wasn’t going to lie [to say that I hadn’t been]. 		Also OJ (moments prior): I’d gotten physical with her, I probably shouldn’t have, but anyone who knows her knows she’s a physical person. #DidOJConfess
Y’all have to pay attention to these verbs/verb phrases OJ is using. This is a confession through and through. 		“I **remember reaching** for the knife...” #DidOJConfess
Interesting note: OJ seems to speak of Nicole in present tense, when at this time she’d been dead for years. “Anyone who knows her knows she’s a physical person.” #DidOJConfess
OJ: I casually swung a bat into the hood of a car, people made a whole thing about it. #DidOJConfess
@JasmynBeKnowing EXACTLY. Minus that whole crucifixion storyline part... lol
OMG. I went out and got snacks just to watch this OJ special on Fox. #DidOJConfess
See, I take it from the opposite perspective, @JasmynBeKnowing.

@AngieTh17868038 You do realize Black Panther is eligible for nomination until next year, right?
I'm enjoying the Best Song performances being extended into teases to break. Nice touch. #Oscars
Ladies &amp; gentlemen, please welcome Miguel, and his extensions. And this... vocal... #Oscars
@NathanHWilliams I can't stand you, LOL.		(IMPORTANT NOTE: I didn't say I disagreed with you.)

Ok.		Now seeing Lupita's dress... I'm into it. Not my favorite of the night, but it's gorgeous. #Oscars
I didn't even read this as lesbian-adjacent... oh the subliminal gay agenda! Somebody check on Mike Pence. #HereForIt https://t.co/HSdtXL1Kdp
Ok, while I honor that it was Walmart... that commercial was pretty damn cute. #Oscars
RT @deray: Black @ #VanityFair. #Oscars https://t.co/GeNhoW3ON1
This set design is pretty cool... #Oscars
Full stop.		Mary J. Blige looks incredible.		#Oscars
I know somewhere, someone just said: "OMG. Are Taraji and Mary related?" 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ #Oscars
So, if Black Panther isn't nominated for the Best Costume Design #Oscars next year I'm staging a revolution.
The #Oscars proscenium with color added is a bit more interesting... but I still can't tell if it's gaudy or opulent.
If Armie's a hammer, make me a nail. This tuxedo is amazing. #Oscars

RT @iDXR: Currently researching hot pink looks for this spring.
Like, seriously, this #Oscars set design looks like something out of Trump Tower. Yikes.
I AM liking the #Oscars graphics package this year.
@violadavis looks so youthful in this look at the #Oscars.
#Oscar stage/set design is... a lot this year.
@snarkylicious Heard. I'm mixed on the dress for Lupita, LOVE the hair with the gold. 		Danai's look I didn't love.
I mean, who did it better? 		Answer: NO ONE.	#Oscars https://t.co/lGzDEb3GVj
Red Carpet murderers:	Chadwick Boseman.	Nicole Kidman. 	Alison Janey.		All killed the carpet.	#Oscars

So:		-Putin/Russia attacks our election -Trump does nothing.		-Sp Coun brings indictments against dozen+ Russians for acts against USA - Trump: nada.		- Congress votes to impose sanctions on Russia - Trump: nathan. 		- Putin shows video of weapons attacking America - Trump: 0.
@julia_locklear Dragged out. By federal agents.
If this White House/administration has had this much turnover in just over a year, what will it look like come 2020 election time? What kind of campaign team could you bring on? Who will be left with a willingness to jump into the sinking ship?

So... would you watch #LadiesFirst or nah?
@bored_in_jersey Too soon. Barbara’s in there too.
@MELANIATRUMP: She’s left her husband, is a single mom, and has all the tea, in a mug from Russia. She hates Ivanka, she her (now) ex-stepsons, and she’s been schtupping a Secret Service since the campaign. 		She’s got some shit to say (and it’s not plagiarized). https://t.co/j6ZCGQwATB
BARBARA: Get ready, she’s the pistol you didn’t see coming. She’s a Republican who’s never been one for the bullshit. She doesn’t use Trump. She knows the tea. She piss and vinegar, been there, done that and will read for legacy filth. Barbara is our @BarbaraJWalters. https://t.co/TOQ5Vw7CAM
@HillaryClinton : Unleashed. U thought “What Happened” was candid, that’s Hillary Light. She’s free to say the things she never could. From reading Bill Clinton’s cheating ass, to always having to grin &amp; bear it, being a woman in politics, she’s a hoot, like Auntie @JoyVBehar. https://t.co/n2nDHaVUQy
3/ @laurawbush: Moderator (@meredithvieira style), serving you the stories, little bit of perspective, but mainly is the straight woman. Occasionally reading her husband for his drunk years and not having command over the English language. https://t.co/za3dYgGR41
2/ @MichelleObama: Coming with the real. She’s our @StarJonesEsq - a lawyer, badass Black woman, and unleashed to say WTF she wants - because she’s finally actually made the decision that she WILL NOT run for office. Can you imagine... her, live, for an hour, every day!? Come on. https://t.co/FQitvx4gSN
1/I had a fantastical idea the other morning...		I want to create/produce a panel-style talk show, in the style of @TheView. This is Ladies First.
Mo’Nique is not wrong.		She maybe overestimated the public’s investment in her cause (re: boycotting Netflix), which... is a whole other conversation - but she’s not really been wrong about much of anything in this conversation she started.
I feel so validated by this tweet. https://t.co/sxZBPaSq56
I’m so grateful to be Black.	I’m so grateful to be gay.	I’m so grateful to be both simultaneously.	I’m so grateful to live in this time.	I’m so grateful for the overwhelming kindness of strangers.	I’m so grateful for Faith.	I’m so grateful.
