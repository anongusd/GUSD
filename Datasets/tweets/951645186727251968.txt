@Mattielisbon @SenFeinstein Yeah as batteries get better we should see more and more of them, if we can couple it with a clean grid then we can be both energy independent and clean
@Mattielisbon @SenFeinstein Solar is a great option for the desert but the main energy issue we have is vehicles that are 99% fossil fuel powered and 83% of that power is imported
