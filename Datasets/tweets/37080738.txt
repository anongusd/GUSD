@Lesley_Downing It's the secret to my charm :)
@RuffusMD  I was just thinking about turning in myself.  Great minds think alike, and apparently so do weak ones.
@RuffusMD Right!  We could go on NPR's Fresh Air to promote it in out best, breathy, intellectual voices!
@RuffusMD I've read Rules for Radicals.  But it doesn't explain why, it explains how.  I've never read Marx.
@Lesley_Downing We produce the eye candy for the women of the world. I'm the Milk Dud.
@RuffusMD Seriously, I agree with you.  And A&amp;M could've made a pretty god case too.  Not sure ND was truly a top 5 team.
@BrentTeichman At what point does the other side go ahead and just declare it hates America?
@RuffusMD I have asked liberals for years for a good book on liberal philosophy, and nobody ever comes up with one to recommend.
@RuffusMD  Also, Bama's destruction of Notre Dame was worse than it's destruction of Mizzou, i.e., Mizzou was truly the second best team.
@RuffusMD Also beat Kentucky &amp; the worst Tennessee team in years.  IOW, Mizzou was so dominant, it was no shame to lose to them last year.
@RuffusMD And yes, we have a college football team.  Beat Central Florida last year. That ought to shut you up!
@RuffusMD LOL!!
@Lesley_Downing Yes. Jon Hamm, Brad Pitt, Tom Berrenger, and me, all Mizzou grads #oneofthesethingsisnotliketheother (I'm not an actor) :)
@RuffusMD Do they have a college in Florida?
@RuffusMD I know that many liberals know what they're doing &amp; are just crooked. But many really believe. I assume they're brainwashed.
@RuffusMD  But liberals befuddle me w/ double standards, &amp; citing any theory, no matter how absurd, which supports their position.
@RuffusMD It really seems like it. Obviously, there are times when I disagree with someone, but understand their point.

@BratFrye I'd rather discuss matters at this level than the antagonistic exchanges earlier.
@BratFrye I would add that the leap of faith serves to accept God's gift of grace which purifies us to enter His kingdom.
@BratFrye and I don't think my salvation is dependent on understanding God's reasoning or the fate of men in ancient times.
@BratFrye I certainly am not able to explain the rationale of God who is all knowing.
@BratFrye I am not familiar with the term or concept.
@BratFrye But if you truly love Jesus, you won't worship false prophets
@BratFrye I dispute that, yes.
@BratFrye if you believe I am wrong in my faith in Jesus, do you condemn me or pray for me to repent?
@BratFrye I didn't condemn you. I was warning you that you risk eternal damnation
@BratFrye Repent, or you may be baptized by the fires of hell! Better?
@BratFrye  Sorry. I guess I should have known that you were referring only to the actual phrase "burn in hell".
@BratFrye He accepted Christ as his savior at that moment.
@BratFrye Matt 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15 &amp;33; Mark 9:43,45,&amp;47; &amp; Luke 12:5. Still confused?
@BratFrye So when Jesus talked about it, that wouldn't have worked for you?
@BratFrye And good suggestion, as I need Him to give me compassion &amp; the words to recruit men for Christ.
@BratFrye No follower of Christ would refuse prayers. And you can't keep me from praying for you.
@BratFrye Which brings us back to @davidlimbaugh 's Q: how does it feel to be wrong so often?
@BratFrye  To Islam, I suppose, but "Allah" is not the Father, Jesus Christ &amp; Holy Spirit in one.
@BratFrye Then you will burn in hell unless you repent. I will pray for you.
@BratFrye @davidlimbaugh Anti-capitalist regulations cause drag on economy &amp; choke opportunity for personal achievement.
@BratFrye and, no I'm not a house pet. Have you accepted Jesus as your lord and savior?
@BratFrye @davidlimbaugh Because the administration is in charge of the Executive branch of the US govt.

@drginaloudon Thank you for standing on your principles.  You &amp; @johnloudon offered Christ. God bless you all.
@vsk_4 that isn't what I've said. But I'm giving up as its way too late. Goodnight!
@vsk_4 A law that only heterosexual men can marry a woman, and homosexual men cannot marry women, that would violate the 14th Am.
@vsk_4 because nobody is prevented from getting married to someone of the opposite sex, and gay marriage is denied to everyone.
@vsk_4 my IPhone is about to die. Nice chatting with you. Thanks for being respectful.
@vsk_4 Truth is my intent isn't to persuade you, but to get you to understand the argument the legal point I'm making.
@vsk_4 that a state that doesn't allow one person to marry another person of the same sex is not denying people equal protection under law
@vsk_4 Does any legal definition of marriage include a requirement of love?
@vsk_4 Nor do I think the Constitution prohibits gay marriage.
@vsk_4 I'm arguing the Constitution doesn't give anyone the right to marry someone of the same sex.
@vsk_4 it doesn't sound ridiculous at all. And I'm not arguing that there should or shouldn't be gay marriage.
@vsk_4 Um what? I was trying to have a logical discussion with you. I made a factual statement, not a personal judgment about gays.
@vsk_4 marriage is defined as a union between man and woman, not union between people who are in love. Love isn't a legal requirement.
@vsk_4 A homosexual can get married, but it must be to someone of the opposite sex
@vsk_4 Yes. And if same sex marriages are not legal, then nobody can marry someone of the same sex, including heterosexuals.
@vsk_4 Yes. But to the extent that a marriage has legal consequences, the govt's definition of marriage is what will count.
@vsk_4 but where does the C prevent the govt from doing it?
@vsk_4 But it isn't used to keep the govt from interfering with religion, which was your point, at least that's how I read it.
@vsk_4 The point is the Establishment Clause has been misinterpreted to mean that govt can't promote faith
@vsk_4 more than a commitment under the law. But I'm a Christian.
@vsk_4 it isn't under the law, as many are married in a civil ceremony before a judge. But I believe marriage is a commitment before God...
@vsk_4 No. It has been misinterpreted to prevent anyone associated w/ govt or quasi-govt entity from acknowledging the existence of God
@DavidLimbaugh My pastor's point is a ruling affirming 9th will embolden left to demonize Churches and foment hate of parishioners.
@DavidLimbaugh many will call that argument insensitive, but many well reasoned legal arguments are.
@DavidLimbaugh in that all are allowed to marry, it just must be someone of opposite sex, &amp; all are forbidden to enter into gay marriage?
@DavidLimbaugh Have you noticed that there's little effort to argue that "protection" under 14th is actually equal? Con't. . .
@DavidLimbaugh and will that ridicule dissuade people from church attendance &amp;, more importantly, accepting Christ?
@DavidLimbaugh my pastor today said he's concerned that affirming 9th cir will encourage more ridicule of Bible, church &amp; Christians.
‚Äú@DavidLimbaugh: @vsk_4 that phrase is grossly abused and misunderstood IMHO‚Äù and not in the constitution anyway.

Ironic that said RINO is spending his time criticizing conservatives, rather than focusing his wrath on BHO.
The RINO thinks conservatives should leave the GOP leadership in DC alone and focus energy on BHO.

@CourtneyScott93 @mizthom FWIW, it isn't part loyalty. It's to get rid of Claire who will do a lot more damage than Akin could try to do
@MizThom We (GOP) need a better bench in Mo. Amazing we own gen ass. but can't win statewide races
MT ‚Äú@drginaloudon: Not voting for @ToddAkin?  Are you KIDDING me? http://t.co/HzhbvFzI @johnloudon"
@MizThom Ilike to think Romney's coat tails will help GOP in races with no incumbent or low name recognition
@MizThom I'm afraid you're right about the state races, except maybe Treasurer and Sec of State
@MizThom Done. My 1st house after law school was right behind the SAE house. Good guys!
@MizThom and how do you feel abou tomorrow? What about the statewide races?
@MizThom what house?
@MizThom That's a deal!
@MizThom in fact, a lot of liberals are in the 53%, especially in the 1%
@MizThom He did, although nowhere near all of that 47% wants more govt
@MizThom while his heroics as a POW were amazing, I didn't like McCain. I prefer all the other nominees
@MizThom the law school, yes
@MizThom still better than having Claire as the incumbent again
@MizThom But I also am concerned about electoral shenanigans &amp; bogus court challenges
@MizThom So if I had to bet, I'd bet on Romney
@MizThom I think this feels more like 04 &amp; maybe 2000 than 2008
@MizThom As for the prez race, I can only compare what is being said with past experiences
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 My last point on this: vote for him, and then work harder than ever to beat him in the primary the next time
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 but it would be a vote to keep Claire out, not a vote for her.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 but I vowed to suck it up and vote for her if she'd been nomniated
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 Ihad a very personal problem with another candidate in the senate race
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 I'm feeling much better this year than I did in 08 on election eve.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 voting for a 3 rd party rewards Claire and the Dems for their crap
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 Claire supporters took GOP ballots to vote for Akin.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 The only cheating that went on was that of Claire supporters
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 I supported Brunner too. But Akin didn't steal anything. C'mon!
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 But the future of this country is too important to  hold a grudge.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 I'm still mad he didn't b/c  of the disagreements we are having right now.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 FYI, I told Todd to his face that I was mad he didn't step aside
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 Not every vote is filibustered. You're rationalizing.
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 Wow!
@MizThom @courtneyscott93 Thom, do you really think the balance of the senate means little?

@CourtneyScott93 @mizthom If Claire wins, and she will if GOP protests by voting 3rd party you will regret
@CourtneyScott93 @mizthom Hey guys! A vote for anyone but Akin is a vote against fiscal sanity

@FloridaJayhawk Thanks for the debate.
@FloridaJayhawk Conservatives? No. The moderates who voted for Claire in 2006? Yes, although last friday they were still a "no" on Claire.
@FloridaJayhawk Only ones who aren't asking him to leave  are those who are close to him, or who have hitched their wagon to him publicly.
@FloridaJayhawk I agree.  And believe me, they're trying.  My phone started ringing first thing Monday morning with "what'll we do?" calls.
@FloridaJayhawk And now it's too late to circle them effectively without taking resources away from others.
@FloridaJayhawk And maybe they should have circled the wagons, but they didn't for Akin.
@FloridaJayhawk Different circumstances.  Claire is incredibly vulnerable. If Akin is replaced, we can be back to where we were a week ago.
@FloridaJayhawk They were going to spend a little.  But just a little.  Because the dems weren't going to spend much.  They'd given up.
@FloridaJayhawk I'm not giving up. But unless he steps aside, it will be a lot harder. And it doesn't have to be.
@FloridaJayhawk If Akin gets out, virtually anyone of the people ID'd as likely replacements would clobber Claire &amp; DNC may pull back out.
@FloridaJayhawk Now GOP is going to have to take resources that could be better used in true swing states like FL and OH to spend in MO.
@FloridaJayhawk Don't worry.  I won't surrender.  But the DEMS HAD surrendered Missouri. DNC was putting no money here.

Hey Juan Williams! Money that's invested elsewhere not only doesn't create more American jobs, it also isn't taxed for the Treasury.
Hey Juan Williams! If for no other reason, lower taxes encourage domestic investment; higher taxes encourage foreign investment.
Hey Juan Williams!  Generally speaking, since WWII, federal tax cuts have caused revenue collected to rise.
Hey Juan Williams!  Under current circumstances, the best way to raise government revenues is to cut taxes to spur private investment.
Hey Juan Williams!  A tax cut is not an expenditure. The government can't spend what it never has. Get a clue!

Many said they wouldn't vote 4 McCain, and ended up eating their words.  Their earlier declarations didn't help him v. #BHOWPE
Good chance that Ur current GOP candidate won't get the nod. Don't declare U won't vote 4 someone when it may come 2 Someone v #BHOWPE
The candidate who presents the biggest risk to the GOP isn't a Republican.  It's #BHOWPE
I'm less likely to vote for your candidate if you make fun of another candidate.
If the other candidates aren't right on issues, or aren't ethical, point it out but back it up with facts.
Telling me the other R candidate can't win, candidate isn't smart, or isn't popular makes you, and in turn, your candidate, look bad.
Vetting is 1 thing. But I don't understand the hatred people on our side r showing for our team. ANY of them can still get the nomination.
