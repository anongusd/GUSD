@ryanchittum Anyway as somebody has been doing a lot of work helping precarious journalists organize over the past year, I can tell you that just framing the issue as ‚Äúthis means payroll will go from X to Y‚Äù is missing a lot of what these unions can and are doing.
@ryanchittum The reality is that Bustle still sees value in Mic as an entity that is attractive to a particular demographic, which is leverage.
@ryanchittum Which means they can use the threat of a ULP at the NLRB to extract greater severances, among other things. And that‚Äôs only the legal picture ‚Äî even laid off workers who are organized can continue to agitate with new ownership to hire some of them back or make other concessions
@ryanchittum I‚Äôm not sure you see the full field, here. It‚Äôs not like the union was some kind of financial drag imperiling the company ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt even have a contract! ‚Äî but the company has legal obligations to bargain with them over layoffs which it probably violated and may be actionable

Anyway my goal of free healthcare for myself went unrealized this time around but there's always next time!!!!
Would we be willing for more healthy people to pay slightly higher premiums so that the out-of-pocket maximums would be less burdensome for coworkers with health problems? Hell yeah, our bargaining committee said. The strong protect the less strong.
The bargaining process wasn't perfect (no bargaining process ever is!) but we stopped the company from doing a bunch of stuff we didn't like, like hiking out-of-pocket maximums to put more of the cost burden on our few coworkers who need healthcare the most.
Healthcare enrollment is this week, which is normally not noteworthy, except we just unionized and this is the first time we get to pick policies we negotiated for ourselves. They're also the same policies being offered to all the non-union workers in the rest of the company.

McInnes: "In closing, in an attempt to please the courts, I hereby dissociate myself from this club, this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing."

also I don't know if this was ever put out there, but McInnes includes a clip of his appearance at the Manhattan Metropolitan Republican Club, where he's doing a racist Japanese impersonation as part of a gag involving the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma https://t.co/pQOWxdh6lA https://t.co/s1ZkZj9vu9
McInnes: "by the way, I'm pretty well connected with law enforcement"
FYI later in the video McInnes refers to his own " 'stepping down gesture,' in quotation marks," and he is fundraising for legal defense for the Proud Boys arrested in New York, so it's probably safe to treat the quitting thing as bullshit until proven otherwise. https://t.co/7HGjmPKztR

Like, we're two years past 2016 now, and so there's no reason to be especially mystified why Bernie Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez activate constituencies that are unfamiliar to our usual partisan frameworks.
