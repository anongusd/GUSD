@BenMakesTV @patkiernan @fromedome @NYCSpeakerCoJo @RoryLancman That's reasonable, but it's one of the main reasons you used to have community journalism, and so there's a consequence to pulling it -- and the obv answer is to push it into the present and online

@cehoskinson @DanielBShapiro @tgmckinney @noonanjo I think the symbolic 2018 politics of memorials aren't being fought at that level of detail or by actual devotees of the old confederacy. (I think this is the actual, reasonable, disagreement here)
@cehoskinson @DanielBShapiro @tgmckinney @noonanjo The context here isn't a high school history class. It's a political rally in a year in which statues of Lee have become a political issue.
@cehoskinson @tgmckinney @noonanjo I'm not sure Trump is quite this schooled in history? I think it's possible he thinks more about the politics of 2018, in fact.
@cehoskinson @tgmckinney @noonanjo Not disagreeing! And he also went out of his way to say nice things about a symbol of slavery whose legacy has been at the center of the news and his image since Charlottesville. Both these things can be true no?
@noonanjo I mean, it can both be a fair point and a noteworthy thing for the president to say.
@noonanjo I think if he'd been praising Putin in a context like and there were questions about his real views, it would be news. (Crimea example is better - I don't mean to invoke Godwin's law.) it would be notable, Kremlin would be pleased. This isn't first lost cause rodeo
