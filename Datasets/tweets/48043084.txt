The union provision was not a part of this short term FAA extension, that was in a house bill for long term funding, yet to be resolved
FAA standoff appears resolved: Reid announces compromise, the Sen will pass the House bill & DOT will  then waive the cuts to rural airports
Panetta briefs at DOD:  he says if the "trigger" goes into effect from debt deal, "very dangerous cuts" to defense that would do real damage
