@sewest82 @SenDuckworth The problem is at the VA level and it's being addressed thank you. Duckworth doesn't need to do a thing. It's being handled by the top officials in the Veterans Affairs
@ManleyPeg @SenDuckworth @SpyNavy3910 Actually ma'am, we're doing much better than ever before thanks to president Trump.
@queeng20111 @SenDuckworth @realDonaldTrump We're being taken care of far better now than ever before. Thanks to president Trump.
@queeng20111 @SenDuckworth @realDonaldTrump Don't forget to blame Trump for the earthquake in Alaska too. The VA is having issues with it's system and it has nothing to do with Trump. They're working to correct it now.
@blaine_delancey @SenDuckworth @willowsender What are you talking about? The VA has a problem in their system and they're trying to fix it.
@landis_lain @SenDuckworth @mharvey816 She's not going to anything but talk. The VA has already identified the problem and is working to correct it. But she'll try to take credit for it.
@BroMark13 @SenDuckworth @Trth2Pwer68 If anyone joins the military just for the collage benefits, they're joining for the wrong reason.
@SenDuckworth @SenDuckworth should have said the Veterans affairs is the one failing not the Trump administration. She knows that's where the problem is and she knows it's being corrected. Funny how she words things to be deceitful.

@SharonKyle00 @ColorOfChange This isn't about race. America takes in over a million new immigrants each year not counting the refugees. This is about people taking advantage of our system. They abuse it and that's not how it was first intended. I know you're smart enough to understand this

@SharonKyle00 @ColorOfChange @UnionCountyNC I just read the rest of the story, she put herself and her childs life in danger by going around road barackades and drove into flood waters. Sounds guilty to me. She's responsible for her child's death.
@SharonKyle00 Are you referring to immigrants here lawfully or unlawfully? Because that's the only part that matters to America
@SharonKyle00 Bad choice. Felons loose that right. Good given rights can't be taken away, man given rights can be.

@scottyhancock82 @realDonaldTrump That sounds like an education issue but can still be salved by getting someone to help fill it out

@scottyhancock82 @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure I understand the problem completely. Would they not be able to get a state ID card like anyone else? Many people that don't drive get these for Identification instead of a driver's license and it's valid for anything.
@scottyhancock82 @realDonaldTrump It's not that hard to fill out. Just follow the instructions. If you need help someone will show you how to do it correctly.
@scottyhancock82 @realDonaldTrump So it wasn't targeting anyone group, it just needs to be filled out correctly. Ok so you do it over again and make sure it's correct before sending it in. Problem salved. That's with many applications. Try getting SSD. Most people have to do the forms over 3-4 times.
@pr0udsnowflake @realDonaldTrump That's just common sense
@pr0udsnowflake @realDonaldTrump If you have to show ID to get cigarettes, don't you think voting for our leaders is way more important?

You need it for just about everything else in life so how's this any different? We should want only Americans voting and not leave an opportunity for anyone else.
@scottyhancock82 @realDonaldTrump Why were the registrations tossed out? We're they only Dems?

@realDonaldTrump Are you guys suggesting that only republican minorities can get the proper ID to vote but Democrat minorities can't? How stupid does that sound?
@HelloMrWilson @realDonaldTrump When Libs go to the Dr, is it patient suppression if asked to show their insurance card, or driver suppression when a cop asks to see their drivers license? What about at the bank? Public assistance? To purchase cigarettes and alcohol? You need ID to pick up your kids at school.
@HelloMrWilson @realDonaldTrump Why do Dems think minority American citizens don't possess some form of positive ID? If it's required for other things in life why not be the same for voting? I'm sure if anyone wants to vote they can get the proper ID before hand and find out where and what time to vote.

@jmgraceland @curticemang I keep hearing about how the Dems are going to impeach Kavanaugh if given the opportunity. Does this mean they plan on creating more faults accusations against him? Because what they have so far wasn't enough to stop him from being confirmed.

@MCunninghamAJC @boykeller @brithume @JohnJHarwood Before he opened his mouth, a lot of people were starting think that same thing about the Clinton's, the resistance, the remarks made by the Democrat party, all doing anything they can to stop Kavanaugh/Trump.

@smaqcksaidso @bjordandee @revgvc @LindseyGrahamSC Thanks for the put down. I do try to stay informed. I thought you were insinuating HE came up with the not investigating the president thing. The opinion like most all of his opinions was based on settled law.

@kuhn_marty @trueamerica1st @realDonaldTrump Obama didn't do anything that created jobs. Not one thing he signed, created, past, or put together gave us jobs. Instead he drove out our jobs to other countries like China and Mexico

@rebeccaballhaus Vote him in.
@rebeccaballhaus Kavanaugh did a great job defending his self under the barrage of character assaults from the Dems, he responded like anyone in his position would do, and as others in the past like Clarence Thomas has done. No one wants to be fautsly accused. He had every right to be angry
@rebeccaballhaus It would be impossible to say her testimony was credible when not one person she claims was at the party could say this party ever took place muchless place Kavanaugh there with her. Nothing she said could be verified, so how's that make her "credible"?
#KavanaughHearings Great job @BrettKavanaugh 	They both looked believable, but all her witnesses could not substanuat her story, she had zero proof, conflicting stories, and on the other side he has a calendar of events, a ton of character witnesses, over all a stronger case.

@jaketapper Are you guys forgetting that it was the 8 years of crisis that got Trump elected. The American dream is back
@oufenix @jaketapper He's faced many many crisis once he took office. Each one he handled like a true leader. It's been a long time since we've had anyone that remotely resembled a leader.
@oufenix @jaketapper $36.5B was sent to Puerto Rico. How is that for consideration? Someone likes to stir up trouble that doesn't exist.

@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews The news (true or not) about what's going on in South Africa came from South Africa not something Trump fabricated. In his tweet he was asking for someone "Secretary of State" to look into this story about these farmers. We need the facts. How is that so hard to understand?
@thapelok @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Read his statement, he wants the matter looked into. As you can see there's mixed stories about what's going on down there. If we're to do anything, we first need to know the truth and the complete facts. So there's nothing wrong with what he's asking.
@thapelok @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews The wall is not to keep Mexicans out, it's to keep our Mexican Immigrates legal. Big difference.
