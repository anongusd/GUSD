@joe_klaatu @KamalaHarris Education has to be a collaboration between teachers, parents, and students and some local and state teachers' unions lost sight of that. It's no wonder parents want other options and obstinate unions stand in the way of hiring better teachers and paying them what they deserve.
@joe_klaatu @KamalaHarris Public schools. I had some of the best teachers and I get that it was a result of living in a wealthy community but when I look at the some teacher's unions, I see corruption. Rules that protect incompetent teachers and adminstrators and kids who can't read or do basic math.
@jbendery Yeah, like the @HuffPost is going to cover tax policy fairly. 1. 11 million is a small portion of taxpayers (and definitely including those with less-than-zero tax liability) 2. Returns have only started coming in. We never knew how the TCJA would impact taxes owed.

@HeathMayo Part of the problem is "conservativism." Most people think of social conservativism, pious religiosity, anti-gay marriage and abortion. The working class doesn't necessarily disagree and they resent progressives for encroaching on their culture with trans-rights and pop culture..
@DiricoLB @MollyJongFast @BulwarkOnline Every abortion is a tragedy. So are the circumstances that lead to it. Every single abortion can be an adoption. Humanity isn't defined by circumstances.

@CJohnpherson @nytopinion @tomfriedman Well, at least you clued in on my biggest issue. Our failure to live up to our highest ideals is not an indictment of the ideals, it's an indictment of us. You cannot address inequities in the social heiarchy by creating a new one. Social justice is a farce.

@MacFinn44 I haven't kept up with the figures. I was following one reporter who was very invested and DHS was making progress months ago but then I lost track and so did most of the media.
@MacFinn44 Because that article was in response to MY tweet about executive amnesty and the national emergency, which is irrelevant. You diverted my thread, not the other way around.
@MacFinn44 That's awful.
@MacFinn44 That should be a "but" after tolerance, not an "and."
@MacFinn44 I'm not a Christian and I said nothing about the two tragedies you now cite, not sure if the article did, I didn't read it. I said it's irrelevant because it has nothing to do with executive amnesty or President Trump's national emergency stance. I hate to be diverted.
@MacFinn44 I hate to be diverted but I don't consider it wrongdoing. I considered it a harsh but necessary approach mandated by a misguided court order. I support zero tolerance and the separation of family units was unfortunate, trauma-inducing pain. That can't be forgiven or forgotten.
@MsEnergyHealer @VP It isn't prosecutorial discretion. It's a wide berth of conferred temporary legal status outside of the parameters of the National Immigration Authorization Act.

@kaylatausche She's earned it.
@NancyRHM @KamalaHarris It just does. Voting is a right but only the informed should vote. Only people willing to put in enough time to understand the issues and learn about the candidates should vote. If you're willing to do that, what's a little inconvenience to cast a ballot?
@hipEchik @AGBecerra .22 cents is quite a big deal, though. We think there could be as much as a .69 cent trigger in the cap and trade bill.

@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel Poverty is a lasting vestige of slavery. We don't disagree on that. We just disagree on how to address it. It seems obvious to me that neither side is going to have all the answers so we have to work together to eradicate poverty.

@JulianNotaro1 @blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel Says a proto-fascist.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel Yes, I read your tweet wrong.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel I read this wrong the first time. I'm going to have to disagree. The march was clearly about freedom from segregation. The speech was specifically about that, the movement was defined by that. I'm sure there is a fascinating story about the economic justice part of it though.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be born into poverty and remain in poverty than white Americans. Since independence and jobs are clearly linked, jobs leads to independence, and jobs come from free markets. The policies are colorblind, the impact is not.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel And of course JOBS was the name of the march. The greatest impediment to jobs was segregation. Independence and jobs will always be linked.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel It was part of it, not all of it. It's an important part of the story and considering the weight of poverty on black America, especially, it is still an important part of the struggle. My view is that my principles will better address it than so-called progressive ones.

.@KamalaHarris is the latest Democratic candidate to signal that they'd like to pretend Donald Trump doesn't exist. I suppose that could be smart, since he is going to get plenty of attention all by himself. https://t.co/MQI9IK907a
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel I don't. No one does. All I can do is listen and learn, and when I feel something is worth fighting for, taking those lessons to heart and leading by example. If I'm wrong, so be it.
@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel Maybe I am and maybe the agitators for social and economic justice should ignore me, or maybe they should keep trying to persuade me. After all, poverty is not just an economic issue. Every issue is a human issue and I don't see why we can't work together.
@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel Oh, King and I would vote differently, no doubt. We wouldn't be allies but we would no more be enemies than I am with Barack Obama and Kamala Harris Politics doesn't have to be divisive. It doesn't have to be a culture war. Contest doesn't have to be conquest.
@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel I can. While I think Colin Kaepernick was not sincere, I can understand how taking that side or the conservative or patriotic side was as blocking progress for black Americans. I said so at the time and I considered it over as soon as he took a more respectful knee.
@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel You may see it that way but the record still stands that while he saw the white moderate as an impediment, he led with persuasion. He valued compromise. He valued our founding principles and called on us to live up to them, not to forsake them.
@finalflower @blaireinfeldt @SethAMandel And yet he conducted himself as a leader, not merely an agitator. He compromised. He championed those compromises. He embodied the idea of taking half a loaf and coming back for more, through persuasion, through a march, through protest and storytelling. Justice is not revenge.
@blaireinfeldt @finalflower @SethAMandel We had laws in place that said black people couldn't even breathe the same air as white people. Any moderate in that environment was in the wrong. You cannot equate the cause of economic justice to the civil rights movement, no matter how much you may want to.
I also like how @KamalaHarris announcement video is a tacit admission that people today (esp. millennials) are more easily motivated by bold colors and buzz words than uplifting rhetoric, patriotic flare and music. Political ads sure have come a long way from "Morning in America"
@finalflower @SethAMandel I don't see it that way. Dr. King was calling out those who said he shouldn't be agitating at all, that peaceful protest itself was unnecessary. He still conducted himself and called on his supporters to practice non-violence and work toward persuasion. Still the course today.
@KamalaHarris What the hell color palette is this!? I thought it was an ad for McDonald's. Why have you offended my eyes as much as your policies offend my brain?

@WDGX4 @ReaganBattalion What am I missing?
@WDGX4 @ReaganBattalion Enlighten me.
@ReaganBattalion Also, no matter how high the top marginal tax rate has been, the historical average for tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 18%. It's 18% now. It was 18% in 1980. It can drop, thanks to a tax cut, but it does not rise above 20%. This is a law of economics, not politics.
@jordanmoore0929 @ReaganBattalion @AOC And that is historically how elites have operated in socialist countries. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
@jordanmoore0929 @ReaganBattalion @AOC No, worse, they want to take everything and give it to THEMSELVES
What I find most fascinating about modern progressivism is that it's not a call for redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. Rather, with ideas like 'a green new deal," universal Pre-K, and tuition-free college, it's a call for redistribution from the rich to...the rich!
@WDGX4 @ReaganBattalion Try not to be offended by common sense.
@jordanmoore0929 @ReaganBattalion The "Green new deal" is a perfect example. @AOC is not proposing a top marginal tax rate of 70% to redistribute wealth to the less fortunate. She is proposing a redistribution of wealth AMONG the rich, facilitated by the government simply picking the winners.
Just remember: socialism is NOT the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. It's the redistribution of EVERYTHING from the people to the government. @aoc @60Minutes @BernieSanders

@FlashReport @GavinNewsom What I find most fascinating about modern progressivism is that it's not a call for redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. Rather, with ideas like 'a green new deal," universal Pre-K, and tuition-free college, it's a call for redistribution from the rich to...the rich!

And we need to have an orderly conditional #amnesty so that unauthorized residents can get right with the law and get on with their lives.
We need to reform #ICE so that it focuses on criminal aliens and making sure migrants come to their hearings. We need to end the unconstitutional farce of "sanctuary" from our immigration laws.
We need an American immigration system that puts a premium on integration, civics, and English. We need a secure southern border to stop the flow of unauthorized migration. We need a better immigration court system that can handle asylum, deportations, and hearings required.
@Zigmanfreud Problems evolve. Since 1986, the U.S. has all but given up on assimilation and lost the capacity to cooperate with Mexico. Unauthorized migration is out of control, the courts are backed up, the I-9 system is weak, and cities and states now openly flout immigration law, in JAILS!

@xan_desanctis @DavidAFrench I remain curious, however, from a legal perspective, if the idea of "justified homicide" may suit our purposes. After all, acknowledging abortion is killing is not acknowledging it is murder, and killing is allowed in every state, but states define "justifiable." 1/2

@gak001 @jbouie No problem. It sounds different when I say this in person, with the proper sarcastic inflection.
@gak001 @jbouie I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that it was in there. It's not. My point is that Republicans use the tax code to hide welfare for middle and upper income earners. I contend that they "figured it out" and I'm thankful the Democrats hadn't or something like that would exist.

@IsaacWood @jbouie To me, I see it as the federal government is no longer taxing the money I need for bills. I'm very happy with taking a standard deduction that is even larger than my parent's state and local tax deduction.
@nicetrysuckers @IsaacWood Correct. Most of the new tax law, and almost all of the changes to the individual tax code, will be implemented in 2019. There was relatively no change in 2018. Nearly 88% of Americans should be getting a tax cut next year.
@jbouie @Fyodor32768 No, fuck that. The government should only help those that cannot help themselves or have earned benefits like veterans. The poor, the sick, and the less affluent elderly. Everyone else should be on our own and programs should be fully geared to self-sufficiency.
@jbouie What is your case against the mortgage-interest tax deduction? IMO the government helps middle and upper-income earners at the expense of helping those who truly need it. The welfare state as currently constructed is an absolute failure but reform alone might not be enough.
@jbouie I've always said that I'm thankful the Republicans figured out how to hide welfare for the middle class in the tax code before the Democrats slipped in an abortion subsidy and called it the "family planning tax credit."

@libertylatina Well, I know that Doral in Miami has the largest share of the Venezuelan population. When we have an accurate map of the results by precinct, we'll know for sure but the two largest precincts in Doral went 69% &amp; 74% for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Skews heavily Democrat.
@libertylatina I don't see that particular question in the exit polls. I would assume they could be extrapolating from the vote count, looking at areas with a large Venezuelan population and matching it to Gillum's share of the vote. OR it's a meme, and they made it up.

You'd be surprised how many "South Park Republicans" there are enjoying the satire of tearing into sacred cows, including our own. But it is a cartoon, so that might have something to do with it. But SNL is a comedy show so it should be o.k.
@habesla1 @crowfethrs @smith_valence @4for4_John @ConstProg @ConnieMintz @nytdavidbrooks I try to be. I like to think democracy is a cause worth the struggle

@ConnieMintz @smith_valence @crowfethrs @habesla1 @4for4_John @ConstProg @nytdavidbrooks I understand your point but addressing this requires changing people's minds with an ever-expanding list of groups to accommodate.

@AssemblyRoomUSA @HawleyMO @braun4indiana @MarthaMcSally DeSantis, Scott, and McSally come to mind. They have been behind and I predict will come up short.

@AssemblyRoomUSA @HawleyMO @braun4indiana @MarthaMcSally AZ is starting to look like NV. Older Republican coalition is aging while younger Dem coalition is growing. If candidates are actually boxed in by Trump approval, that is something that will concern Republicans in 2020.
@AssemblyRoomUSA What if @HawleyMO and @braun4indiana win? I think the Republicans will come away realizing the Trump voters, including independents, can carry some candidates to victory but where there aren't enough, they will come up short. Unless @MarthaMcSally pulls through.

@MsEnergyHealer I tweeted that I have the Democrats at 216. If #CA10 is as perilous as it looks for the GOP, make that 217, with 5 or 6 true toss-ups in play in #CA39, #CA45, #CA48, #NM2, #FL26, and #IL06. Reps need to hold all 6 to hold the House. I don't like their odds.
@I_inthesky @libertylatina @jaketapper @danbalz No, I see people on both sides increasingly acting is if there are two Americas and I know that the most important unit in a republic is that of a citizen. I will respect both sides' arguments and choose where I land on any issue based on my own principles and experiences.

@HarryMayUltd @Lynnyulpers @ohioisnttoobad @KamalaHarris I love when progressives reveal how little they understand about their own priorities. Don't hide behind local priorities paid for by local taxes. Own the fact the vast majority of spending goes to seniors, the military, and paying off the debt.
@ThatGayUser @KamalaHarris But tax policy isn't some moralistic endeavor. It isn't about fairness and inequality. It's about how we can siphon off 18% of GDP in a way that doesn't ask too much of anyone. 47% of taxpayers are not net taxpayers so a tax cut does nothing for them, hence the need for credits.
@KamalaHarris $500 a month though? What if we maintain current tax rates and scale back the credit? We can pay for a scaled back credit by phasing out deductions popular among middle and upper-income earners, no?
@ThatGayUser @AnnieLowrey @KamalaHarris They have their reasons for voting for it, some openly cynical if not corrupt. I have mine. That is all.

@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh I'll just leave this here https://t.co/oxj3mVvaJq
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh Still, Trump drag or not, this is politics today. If the GOP voters hadn't nominated Sharon Angle and Christine O'Donnell in 2010, they would have won the majority. Such is politics, Don
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh Yes, I can imagine that given 2014, red state Democrats would be in more trouble if it weren't for anti-Trump animus fueling their volunteers and donors. Joe Donnelly would be headed the way of Mark Pryor and Claire McCaskill, would probably be making calls to Blanche Lincoln.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh But what if they had gone for a Rubio? With the wings dominant, would the progressive activists stand down? Would the moderates feel the GOP represents their voice? Would disengaged voters accept a Rubio-sponsored comprehensive immigration package. Would House members?
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh So why would a different president make a difference? I am not disagreeing. I just think we may want to consider that things wouldn't be that different if our candidate had won. The wings are dominant and a combination of disengaged voters and cultural conservatives gave us Trump
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh I can't imagine the policies would be any different under a President Rubio so it stands to reason "the resistance" would find something to bitch about, unless you think there wouldn't be as much resistance under President Rubio. In that case, I agree. But we'll never know...
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh Let me expound a bit. We're Rubio fans so maybe we think he would break the mold and unite the factions but politics has turned into a cultural contest for a reason. The wings have turned compromise into a dirty word and made allegiance the main currency in politics.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh I don't really think there is a drag in the Senate races. Anti-Trump animus is driving some Democratic enthusiasm but in this case, and others, the cultural contest is driving enthusiasm on both sides. Hawley's is slightly more driven than McCaskill's.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh Sure Trump has made every race about him. Politics has turned fully cultural, a contest of where one stands and who they stand with. I bet it would be the same under a Clinton or Rubio presidency to be honest. There's a reason politics has turned into a cultural contest.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh I don't believe any Republican would lead McCaskill by 10+ points and I didn't say "all Missourians." I said most and I'll even update that to the majority of Missourian Republicans because they are driving Hawley. I didn't miss your point, I contest it.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh And this piece is spot-on. In Missouri, most people saw "a good man, a family man, a God-fearing Christian conservative" dragged through the mud. They have responded by rallying around Hawley. He's the luckiest candidate this cycle.
@AssemblyRoomUSA @HotlineJosh Nah. This race is way more competitive than it looks. McCaskill is a survivor but Hawley is a disciplined warrior.

@Las4Liberty @waconia3 @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion 6.2% is not much. The TCJA will add $1.8T over ten years. New spending will add $9T. Spending is the problem. Again, I would have preferred a revenue-neutral tax reform package, but TCJA isn't a budget buster.

@mattersofmind This study: https://t.co/q6SaWuMNsZ
@mattersofmind According to this study, I'm a moderate in the "exhausted middle" just tired of the fringes leading the conversation and constantly looking to score points on one another. I'll fight progressive activists every damn day, but I'm not devoted to "owning the libs."
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion I have no idea what I'll do under a Speaker or Majority Leader McCarthy or Scalise. My policy-oriented politics do not fit into the tribal politics of the cult vs. the mob.
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion But what I decide is important, what I want to Congress to focus on, probably won't be the same. Peace out!
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion Your research is welcome. I will also seek out the other side's perspective.
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion Interesting.
@Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @jodikyman @ReaganBattalion This is fantastic. Thank you!
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion And the economy is roaring in large part due to the policies pursued by this administration and Congress - rescinding regulations through Congressional Review Act repeals the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. That I will champion. Conservative policies work, and Trump deserves credit.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion No one should give a flying you-know-what about the UN. He changed course because of public pressure, that is true, and the aforementioned court cases. They're working on reuniting children with deported parents or finding suitable homes for adoption.
@Las4Liberty @jodikyman @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion Funding PP is o.k. with me, I'm against trade wars but I found a lot to like in #USMCA, against bailouts of any kind, cut the spending, big supporter of #TaxCuts, I don't know anything about a shadow VA, hate the attacks on the IC, it depends on the EO, and indifferent to press.
@Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @jodikyman @ReaganBattalion Do you have links to these reports? I'd like to read them.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion And conservative Republicans.
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion I do, and I was talking about myself.
@kkhbro @ReaganBattalion Or choosing indifference. I have.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion 4. The trauma is real. The purpose is real (deterring family units from crossing the border outside of established points of entry). The rollout was botched. The courts have intervened. All is not well, but all is not monstrous. I am not holding this against President Trump.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion 3. President Trump signed an executive order stopping the routine separation of family units, detaining them together, and tasked DOJ with arguing for federal judges to overturn the consent agreement. I watched the court cases very carefully, down to the number of children taken.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion 2. But coupled with separating family units (out of a healthy suspicion of drug and sex trafficking), that would result in more trauma. Family unit separation was also required under the Flores consent agreement (children could only be detained for a certain amount of time)
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion 1. From what I can tell, the administration knew "zero tolerance" would result in separating family units. One key mistake was the the Office of Refugee Resettlement did not object because of the trauma it would cause children. DHS also expedited deportations, the right move.
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion That is better. I certainly agree. I wonder where a Paul Ryan Republican will go under the new Republican Party...
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion I'm plenty educated on this subject. I haven't made a value judgement on it and I haven't let my bias affect my position on it. I'm not defending it. I'm just saying that separating migrant families is not analogous to the horrors of John Wayne Gacy.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion Placing children in shelters is not killing them. This is not a reasonable analogy. It's not even an analogy.
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion You can support the policies you have always supported even if he's involved. Opposing a bill, or a nominee, that you would have otherwise supported because Trump is signing it into law or the president is the one nominating them is the most unprincipled thing imaginable.
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion I don't reflexively support Trump and I don't reflexively oppose him either. That is the principled approach.
@HotlineJosh It's a fascinating study. I wish the media hadn't jumped all over this statistic in a way proving the authors' point - fringe activists are driving the conversation and eager to score points on the opposite fringe but the "exhausted middle" just want them both to listen.
@mattersofmind @jodikyman @Las4Liberty @ReaganBattalion Donald Trump is not a serial killer. This is not an analogy at all.
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion I disagree and I refuse to accept that changes the past, that we were never truly "Never Trump," or that we have to accept the likes Jen Rubin and Max Boot as principled. On the contrary, the most principled approach is to refuse to allow Trump to influence our positions.
.@Nate_Cohn is that really a 34-33 Dem-GOP sample in #NVSen?
@jodikyman @Las4Liberty @mattersofmind @ReaganBattalion I don't see how "I'll never vote for Trump" turns into being completely unwilling to give him any credit when he does what I want.

@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 But see you have your most enthusiastic voters showing you their intensity. You have no idea what the low-information, low-propensity voters are going to do.

@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 @YoungKimCD39 Yep. Sure she can. She just doesn't want to play the stupid game the media wants to. "How are you not like Trump?" "What has he done that you oppose?" "How will you buck your party's leadership?" Young is a certified expert on foreign policy and longtime Hill and district staff.
@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 In a low ebb as opposed to a blue wave, only #CA49 will flip but I'm not betting on anything. There's a ways to go.

@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 @YoungKimCD39 Young Kim is damn impressive and Gil Cisneros is a dick. He even comes across as a dick in TV ads. Republicans in the Anaheim Hills/Diamond Bar area are fired up &amp; you're right, Democrats don't turn out in primaries. Funny thing is they haven't turned out on election day either.
@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 Here's a map with 11 Dem pickups so far and 12 toss-up districts that reflect what I have seen from primaries, Real Clear Politics, Cook Political, independent pollsters, and the Upshot polling from the New York Times. 		https://t.co/oksjEKvl0b
@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 I'm taking triage into account. #IA01 #KS04 #CA49 have all been triaged but the two competitive races in Florida #FL26 and #FL27 were supposed to be snoozers and it looks like the only snoozing is coming from the Democratic candidates. #WA08 is the only tossup in Washington.
@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 More Republicans voted in each of those districts in a primary with hardly any competition (except for #CA48) and if there is no "blue wave," the Republicans will eke out victories. This is the story nationwide. After all, the districts are drawn so that they can win 1% races.
@MsEnergyHealer @CA_120 I don't put much weight in the LAT numbers. Denham is safe in #CA10, Valadao in #CA21 too. Rohrabacher, Knight, and Walters are in a tough spot but I bet they pull it out and @YoungKimCD39 is the most impressive Republican candidate this cycle. The primary was a leading indicator
@CA_120 I think they have flipped 12 seats already with about 14 districts in play. They could be limited to one pickup in CA though and that should be enough to induce widespread panic.

@womensmarch @SenatorCollins Thread. https://t.co/VM618KzTEC
@SenatorCollins 7. BUT she also reiterated,"In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy."
6. To quote @SenatorCollins, "Every person‚Äîman or woman--who makes a charge of sexual harassment and abuse deserves to be heard and treated with respect.  The #MeToo movement is real.  It matters.  It is needed.  And it is long overdue."
5. Take heart in that. Take faith in that. Fight for that, and if it's consistent with the principles of fairness and respectful dialog, I will fight with you. We will get justice and we will change the culture, modernize the culture, together.
4. Do not submit your cause to politics - the talismans of flawed and self-interested parties and personnel can never be a conduit for a cultural reckoning. Politics is downstream from culture, and a lagging indicator of trends. Change will take place outside politics.
3. THAT you must fight. Those voices cannot win. This reckoning needs to happen. If you want to be successful in business, politics, or entertainment, you must treat the people around you with respect. Harassment is NEVER o.k. Abuse is never excusable.
2. There is a much more damning response than confirming Judge #Kavanaugh, a supremely qualified #SCOTUS nominee. The response from #Trump and an older generation of men is that women should accept harassment. "Sit there and take it" or, more pejoratively, "lie back and take it."
1. Everyone asking what do we tell sexual assault survivors, the answer is KEEP COMING FORWARD. Don't let the bastards win. This has nothing to do with Brett #Kavanaugh, no matter what your so-called leaders say.
Who knew #Spartacus was such a windbag? It took @CoryBooker  25 minutes to make a single point.
