@LogueRecruitmen: and how are you coping so far ? ................Totally agree with Julia. Thanks to you Ray, I have made it this far.
@Tanya_Maidment  when you retweet a message that someone else posts to twitter it is available for all your followers to view
@Tanya_Maidment  so if you do a search on #perimg now you will see all these messages show up because they all have the tag in them
@Tanya_Maidment   then everyone else does a search on #perimg to get everyones messages
@Tanya_Maidment people use #perimg to send messgaes to everyone else in the group
@Tanya_Maidment you don't have to retweet anything that has a message like "gee its hot today" #perimg
@Tanya_Maidment  then you retweet anything that anyone else has tweeted about a service or business
@Tanya_Maidment  then you do a search on #perimg and all the messages from everyone in the group will come up
@Tanya_Maidment ok......when you do a tweet......... in your tweet you wil have    (URL) (Message) (#tag)
