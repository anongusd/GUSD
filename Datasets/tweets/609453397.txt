@SenateGOP How about the government stays out of my money, my guns, my life and elected officials do what is good for our country and all it’s citizens.
@SenateDems I can’t see any reason to raise taxes for climate change until climate change is clearly defined.
@xbarx1 @HouseGOP Ok I’m confused. Must be that Common Core Logic.
@SenFeinstein The Green New Deal is nothing more than a tactic to destroy the civilized countries of the world through an over taxing of its citizens. It is the latest tactic by the Progressive and Liberal politicians  and their associated organizations to usher in The New World Order. BEWARE!
@KamalaHarris That depends on what exactly the definition of Climate Change is. Currently it is as vague as “Net Neutrality”.  It’s time to stop supporting coined phrases and start defining clear problems.
Our intelligence community must shed its political agendas before @POTUS or the American People can ever trust them. As for now they are as believable as the MSM: @cnn @cbs @abc @washingtonpost  @nytimes @foxnews @MSNBC https://t.co/SHhLkwEKKy

Our politicians forget they are in office to represent all citizens and they forget all but their projects. Our elected officials must have the ability to be career politicians stripped from them. Elected positions are acts of patriotism to our country not careers.

@sunrisemvmt @USRepKCastor Until the day that solar, wind and other renewable energy solutions are affordable, sustainable and manufacturable at similar prices to oil, gas and coal renewable energy is not a solution. Solar panels don’t produce enough energy to be feasible and TCO is too high.

@AlexJackiw @realDonaldTrump I’m complaining too! MSM telling lies. Elected officials on vacation when our country doesn’t have a budget. Immigration laws are not being enforced. Our borders are not secure. There are homeless military veterans who need medical care.  There are American citizens who need help
@Turner1870 @realDonaldTrump The family who did everything in their power to destroy the USA and the re-write history. The family who lied about Benghazi. The family who stole billions and gave it to our country’s enemies? Yeah that’s them.
@TassajaraRd @realDonaldTrump No we didn’t kill a child on Christmas Day that was in @DHSgov custody. The child died from neglect of his parents and family who were not with him.
@GeorgeTakei It’s for sure @POTUS is all alone trying to help our country while 435 other irresponsible elected officials thought it was a good idea to take time off; After working less than 150 days this year.
@JacksonLeeTX18 And you would rather blame @DHSgov and border patrol instead of the careless parents, right?
@GeorgeTakei They could start by hiring teachers that teach their subjects instead of pushing political agendas. Colleges should not be indoctrination camps for politics!
@AustinKious @McCormickProf @benshapiro It’s simple! Establish a bar similar to the lawyers bar. It’s purpose would be to monitor the ethics of journalists. Ensure that what they publish is fully verifiable and in context with the entire story not an “agendized” point of view.
@AustinKious @McCormickProf @benshapiro Accountability without consequences achieves nothing. Freedom of press is not a license to lie, even if the lying is by omission.
@elyse4design @Yair_Rosenberg @realDonaldTrump With the exception of insinuation and ambiguousness you or anybody else cannot find @realDonaldTrump in any violation of any law that will hold up in court. FACT: If he had broken the law he would already be impeached and imprisoned. $50M in wasted tax $ proves that!
@McCormickProf @benshapiro Where I draw the line is when those so called journalists lie and take things out of context in order to promote their agendas. There has to be a way to hold all media accountable for all of their untruths. Accountability means fully verifiable publication.
@Yair_Rosenberg @realDonaldTrump has never in any of his actions met the criteria of the dictionary definition of xenophobia. There is a difference between criminals and foreigners.
@MiaBLove @washingtonpost Just another example of another politician dividing and separating citizens of our country making us weaker in our country and in the world. Only when they realize that all citizens are equally worth representing will the citizens have a government to be proud of.

@davidhogg111 More importantly you will disregard the Constitution of the United States of America. What a tragedy.

@wilburinla @CNN Make renewable energy reasonably priced for even the poor and I will think climate change is a worthwhile project.
@wilburinla @CNN I’m not the one who is paranoid. Can we do better at reducing pollution? Yes! Is the end of the world here now, because of Pollution? No! Should we have unreasonable and unsustainable renewable energy solutions forced upon us when fossil fuel is still available? No!
@wilburinla @CNN Idiots at NASA funded by Liberal and Democrat agendas intended to brainwash the common man so they can get rich off of the common citizen. It’s kinda like Barrack Obama telling me I could keep my doctor and plan with ACA.
@wilburinla @CNN Any idiot can make a report say what they want with proper language and limiting the picture. Let’s see the whole picture and then talk about Climate Change. #pollutionisbadliesareworse
@wilburinla @CNN You are mixing 2 different subjects temperature and CO2. For CO2 levels you need to look back further in time. Try looking at the CO2 levels going back 1 million years based on historical evidence and you will see there is no big change over time.
@wilburinla @CNN Yeah I’ve been trying to find that proof of the world warming and none of those studies pan out when you look at the big picture. When I see that proof then I’ll believe we’re in trouble with the world. Try looking at the proof of the temperatures over the last 1000 years.
@wilburinla @CNN Yeah kinda like comparing apples and oranges. Just goes to show that there are smart people in other countries that see through the smoke and mirrors of climate change.
@GeorgeTakei @GeorgeTakei too bad you are not saying the same thing about:	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters-just to name a few. Must be that liberal double standard at work huh? #NOONEISABOVETHELAW

@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton There is a difference between prevention and punishment. I don’t hate those people. I just don’t want to allow them to break our laws.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I don’t see any hate or ill will I see the force required to prevent our laws from being broken. I suppose you would rather they get in and be jailed for breaking our laws. I would rather prevent the crime.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton American citizens are held accountable for their actions. Why shouldn’t immigrants be?
@SenMarkey @RonWyden @SenBlumenthal I could never support #netneutrality until it’s definition has been clearly defined.
@RepMcNerney Why is it the governments responsibility to find a solution to climate change? I would suggest that a solution be found by those who want the solution. Government solutions tend to be narrow minded and inflexible. Something proven to be useless in today’s world.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Not just documented. Accountable for their actions.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Absolutely it does if they attempted to enter our country outside the bounds of our laws, rules and regulations.

@jimgeraghty Of course the number of illegal immigrants is decreasing. We finally are beginning to enforce our immigration laws. Now the Democrats and Liberals have more power that will increase again. Our country can’t afford it.
@wft_kevin @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Legal immigrants are definitely good for our country. In order to make immigration fair for all our immigration laws must be fully enforced.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton ?
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton We do have the right to defend the sovereignty of our country. Any person who attempts to enter our country in violation of our laws should be prevented from doing so. This makes them criminals if they cant abide by our laws.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I'm not making stuff up, by entering our country illegally they are bypassing our immigration laws and processes.
@janforney1 @HillaryClinton I didnt say I wouldnt donate to the welfare of Children. I said I wouldnt donate to a charity recommended by @HillaryClinton. I want my money to go to the children not to HRC.
@wakingupcoffee @MalcolmFarley @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton The only person who never sinned was Jesus. Remember we were told: Love the sinner and hate the sin.
@gmh8899 @ClunekKathryn @MalcolmFarley @benaxor @HillaryClinton My point is we cant just let them in without inerview.  They need to be vetted.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton So you believe that those who enter our country illegally have more of a right to immigrate here than those who follow our laws rules and regulations?
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton And if the Colleges and Universities were truly worried about education the cost of higher education would be reasonable.  You cant force companies to pay higher wages for less work, companies will seek out less expensive ways to get the job done, like automation.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Lets Start here:	https://t.co/P0VMEQ1o1H
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Wow really? I worked at Mcdonalds.  It was a fun Job.  I knew when I was 16 it wasnt a career it was a stepping stone.  I worked the Tobacco Fields too I never felt any job beneath me, I just wanted better so I made it happen.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton I dont know why you keep trying to label me a Republican.  I'm not.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I believe they once were places of higher education. Now they are boiling pots of liberalism and chaos theory that have lost sight of their purpose. High school kids in China have better educations than the college educated in America.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Leviticus 19:33-34 and 24:22 Israel is commanded: Be holy, live righteously, love your neighbor, and keep the commandments--The Lord reveals and reaffirms sundry laws and commandments--Enchantments, wizardry, prostitution, and all evil practices are forbidden.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Genesis 47 1-6 The Israelites settle in Goshen--Jacob blesses Pharaoh--Joseph sells grain to the Egyptians--Pharaoh receives the Egyptians’ cattle and lands--Jacob desires to be buried with his fathers in Canaan.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Genesis 46 1-7 The Lord sends Jacob and his family of seventy souls to Egypt--The descendants of Jacob are named--Joseph meets Jacob.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Genesis 23 Sarah dies and is buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham buys from Ephron the Hittite.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Genesis 12:10 talks about famine in the land when Abram went to Egypt.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton Not me. The dishonest politicians in the swamp in Washington DC. Don’t pool me with them. If I had my way they would all be out of a job because they are getting rich off of the citizens. It’s time to find true patriots to run our country and represent all citizens all the time.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton The banks and the colleges and the universities. Some coincidence huh?
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Funny how it’s the left perusing that theory and there is plenty of evidence of that.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton That sh*t is caused by all the regulations put on companies making it near impossible for them to invest in truly entry level positions. Working at McDonald’s was never supposed to be a job with benefits.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton What does theft have to do with entering another country.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton Yeah I’ve seen similar loan companies do that to the young on car loans. Legalized theft if you ask me.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton And the liberals running those companies steal from those who want to be educated “legally”.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton It’s not entry level if it requires 3 years experience, no matter what they call it.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Just goes to show you the difference between someone who sees through the smoke and mirrors of the Democrats and Liberals. I don’t need to be handed knowledge I seek it for myself. You are proof you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Wow educate me. I never knew they were entering the promised land illegally. Show me.
@ClunekKathryn @MalcolmFarley @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I did actually mis-speak when I said they must apply for asylum before they get here. I should have said they could apply for asylum at any American Embassy as it is sovereign ground of our country. By doing it the way they are they are abusing the system as it was intended.
@ClunekKathryn @MalcolmFarley @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Amazing how you jump on that band wagon, like it’s something new. FYI it’s been going on long before 2016
@gmh8899 @BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @HillaryClinton You would think those people involved in education loans wouldn’t want to make a profit, they just take advantage of people for their benefit instead of the good of society.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton It’s for sure you will doom yourself to failure if you set your sites too high. It’s kind of like walking and running. You must walk before you run or you will fall down.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Why thank you!
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Of course I also believe college degrees are pretty worthless to. In my career field we call them magazine engineers because they know how things are supposed to work rather than how they really work.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Obviously the value of education is over-rated. It’s another one of those ear-marks created by the liberals and Democrats to try to make you rely on the government for your needs. I have never relied on the government for anything.
@DCBANG1 @DahilMVega Awww life isn’t fair is it? I hate that concept too. I just don’t dwell on unfairness. Playing politics at work is a losing situation for all involved.
@darcelldavis815 @HillaryClinton I never said I liked Republicans, I just like Democrats and Liberals a lot less. There is no such thing as an  honest politician or lawyer.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I worked 80 hr weeks for the first 15 years of my career and still went to school too.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I’ve heard of this. Frankly I couldn’t tell you. I’m not rich. I chalk it up to life is not fair.
@DCBANG1 @DahilMVega Skin color has nothing to do with a persons ability to earn their way in life. That's nothing more than an excuse made up by Democrats and Liberals.  There are people of all colors in America and China who understand this. The difference is China does not tolerate ridiculousness.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton The Hebrews were not entering another country illegally
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton You obviously have never read the NWO Playbook.  Here is a start:  https://t.co/WPpbWI75Fu
@tomholmes2016 @BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I really hate $50 words. Failure must be an option for those not willing to earn their keep.  Dont feed the bears because they will forget how to feed themselves.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Amazing how the I want it now generations think.  Its just more proof that our Junior High Schools and High Schools need to bring back classes that teach how to live within their means.  VOTEC in high school should be brought back too because that teaches even more independence.
@BoxOfficeBuz @tomholmes2016 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I see so you believe our colleges and universities are places for people to throw their money away, not actual places to get a higher education.
@tomholmes2016 @BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Since 98% of Americas higher education institutions are administered by Liberals, Professors have become little more than high school teachers with papers.  This makes the degrees worth little since they in fact teach the test.
@DahilMVega @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton If you are saying I believe our Country's laws should be 100% enforced, then I must admit I am a "Trumpeter". Funny how the Democrats and Liberals think our laws are only guidelines which should only be followed out of convenience.
@DahilMVega Actually China is a very nice country.  Just no welfare.  A place where failure is an option if you don't work.  Wow, imagine that, just like America was 100 years ago before the Democrats and Liberals decided to win elections by giving away what should be earned.
@getRadJad @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Here we go... I'm waiting to hear about all the work that Americans wont do.  Oh wait I forgot.  Its work they wont do under the table, below minimum wage, and without benefits.  Yeah so all the Democrats and Liberals can have their servants, or is that slaves?
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I had to come back to this: When exactly did @POTUS, @HouseGOP @SenateGOP or myself ever say we wanted to stop LEGAL Immigration?
@Natali52475190 @HillaryClinton The cold hard truth: Lack of planning on their part doesn't constitute a crisis on the country's part. I've been to California and their wildlife and forest conservation techniques are severely lacking.  BTW did you see all the Fire departments that went to help?
@Natali52475190 @HillaryClinton Only in your dreams
@LohnesMary @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton In September, Congress appropriated $209 billion for the VA in fiscal year 2019, which began Oct. 1. The budget was another in a series of increases during the last decade for the agency, which had a spending plan of $90 billion in 2009.
@lrademaker2 Actually an asylum request is intended to be made at an American Embassy, which is sovereign ground of the USA
@gmh8899 @benaxor @HillaryClinton I never said ASYLUM requests are Illegal
@Diane_Y @HillaryClinton I really hope your question is sarcasm.
@LohnesMary @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Umm This article talked about cutting budget not benefits. The article even acknowleged that 2019 will be the largest budget the VA has ever had and has grown from $90B in 2009 to $209B in 2019. Thats quite an expansion if you ask me.
@LohnesMary @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton https://t.co/WXquulyIUv
@LohnesMary @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I didnt see anything about cuts in your suggested article. With record low unemployment, and a much larger job force in America I see record numbers of Veterans improving themselves.
@LohnesMary @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Where is your proof of more cuts? I’m a vet and haven’t been affected.
@ksatnews @GM @GM want to increase your revenue? Bring back the Trailblazer. Mine is getting old and I don’t want a Suburban or Tahoe. If you don’t this 22?year Chevy man will be buying a Jeep
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton It is intended that asylum seekers apply for asylum at an embassy. In case you didn’t know an embassy is sovereign ground for the country it represents.
@wakingupcoffee @MalcolmFarley @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton You bet I do and you bet I am
@BraunHjordis @HillaryClinton It’s a shame you put the needs of your country behind people who have admitted they have no intention of following our laws or assimilating into our country as citizens
@tomholmes2016 @BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Post secondary education should be earned, not given. If you cheapen the education system by giving it away the degrees of colleges and universities will be as worthless as most certifications are today.
@tomholmes2016 @BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton And I still oppose them if they are ran by the government it will never work
@HarryKaufer @MDunalewicz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton No I don’t pick and choose which parts of the Bible to live by. I understand the intended meaning of the Bible.
@HarryKaufer @MDunalewicz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I have no problem treating them as equals. I also believe our government and its citizens should know decisively who we are letting into our country. I’m not asking for anything new. Just that the laws, rules and regulations we have right now be enforced without exception.
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton And the criminals would soon control the world because there would be no control of them either. Country must be sovereign, including its borders. All I’m asking is to know who are the people coming to my country. The ones who can’t be vetted, turned away.
@HarryKaufer @MDunalewicz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
@MalcolmFarley @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Never said it was. But they must do it before they get here.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Must be your table. Helping Americans first has been on my table for over 40 years
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton He cut programs that were being abused and used in ways beyond their intentions.
@Greg98255052 @benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Legal immigrants contribute to our country the most.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton The agenda of the Democrats and liberals is right out of the play book for the NWO. The end result is no more country governments. You really should ask HRC she is very familiar with the NWO. Alternatively you could brush up on history and see its failures.
@janforney1 @HillaryClinton I give my time to children every week #martialarts
@Drusila73 @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton So where is your outrage against the governments of the countries treating those people so badly?
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Because I follow the word of God?
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Priorities come to mind. I have absolutely no problem helping immigrants once every single American Citizen has the help they need.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton It means every American citizen has a place to live and food on their table and medical and dental benefits
@benaxor @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I have no problem with immigrants who enter our country within the bounds of our law.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton There is a difference between compassion and supporting criminal activity. If even one of those people enter our country against our laws then our country’s sovereignty has been violated. Those people should be held accountable.
@BoxOfficeBuz @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I support America even less when our government puts non-citizens before citizens. Maybe it’s just the idea that American Citizens get help before anyone else.
@MDunalewicz @HarryKaufer @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I can’t say I’m a republican, but I can say I am a Christian without a doubt.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I’ve never heard our president speak disrespectfully about immigrants or refugees. I’ve heard him say that people who come to our country and break our laws will be stopped, and held accountable for their actions.
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton You obviously are a supporter of NWO. Tell me how do you expect all the other countries of the world to just give up their sovereignty? A one world government will never work without war. How many millions are you ready to let die for the NWO?
@Shinybronze @gmh8899 @HillaryClinton The atrocities happening at our border have been produced by George Soros and our President is ensuring our laws are enforced. I truly hope that the worst thing used is tear gas, if more powerful force is needed to ensure our laws are enforced, so be it.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I don’t see cruelty when preventing people from breaking our laws, rules and regulations.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Obviously no responsibility should be placed on the adults in the caravan for placing those children in such a dangerous situation. Only our president is the bad guy. Point taken, as ridiculous as it is. It’s the parents of those children who are the problem not our president.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton Our President doesn’t hate refugees or immigrants. He expects them to enter our country according to our laws, rules and regulations. If they can’t do that they are nothing more than criminals and should be treated accordingly.
@gmh8899 @HillaryClinton I could never support an organization that doesn’t put our citizens and especially veterans first. When the welfare of our citizens is the first priority then we can take care of immigrants
@HillaryClinton I would never give to any charity you recommended because I would feel terrible if even 1 penny of my donation ended up in a bank account associate to you.
@davidhogg111 Imagine where we would be if we invested in the welfare of every American Citizen and ensured that every citizen had a home to live in and food on their table and a school to go to.
@davidhogg111 Just what laws will make the criminals behave? Until then I'll keep my guns and only shoot bad guys.

If being stripped of your Constitutional right to defend yourself makes you more "safe" according to the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If you pay your mortgage faithfully, while your neighbor buys iPhones, time shares, a wall-plasma screen TV and new cars, and the government forgives his debt when he defaults on his mortgage — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If work and success are met with higher taxes and more government regulation while not working is rewarded with Food Stamps, WIC checks, Medicaid benefits, subsidized housing, and free cell phones — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If a seven-year-old boy can be thrown out of school for saying his teacher is "cute" but hosting a sexual exploration or diversity class in grade school is perfectly acceptable — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If an 80-year-old who is in a wheelchair or a 3-year-old can be strip-searched by the TSA at the airport, but a woman in a burka or a hijab is only subject to having her neck and head searched — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If, in the nation's largest city, you can buy two 16-ounce sodas, but not one 24-ounce soda, because 24-ounces of a sugary drink might make you fat — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If the government wants to prevent stable, law-abiding citizens from owning gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds, but gives twenty F-16 fighter jets to the crazy new leaders in Egypt — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If you MUST show your identification to board an airplane, cash a check, buy liquor, or check out a library book and rent a video, but not to vote for who runs the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If you have to get your parents' permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
If plastic water bottles are okay, but plastic bags are banned, — you might live in a nation (state) that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
@davidhogg111 No more early out for good behavior. No more trying to understand why someone broke the law. No more exceptions to the law. Punishment appropriate to the crime. No more rehabilitation, prison is a punishment.
@davidhogg111 You are absolutely right, and the day our justice system abandons the idea that our laws don’t need to be enforced and begins handing out punishments severe enough that people won’t want to break the law is the day we won’t need those guards anymore
@davidhogg111 Just remember it’s much easier to destroy than it is to create.

@Specs1962 be very careful about buying gifts at Specs. Had them help me buy a gift there 2 days ago and they wouldn’t take it back because they couldn’t find me at the register on their security cams. I thought I got 5% discount because I paid cash but I declined the receipt.
@gina21764 @610_731 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump It’s about maintaining the sovereignty of our country and enforcing our laws. If it takes military reenforcement of our border to make sure that people enter our country legally then so be it.
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump Opinions vary. None of the vets I know including active duty ranging from E1 to O7 see it that way. They see it as a step that should have been done years ago.
@NewEagleLife @theonjax @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Oh no! Welfare should belong to the  citizens and the churches, not the government. The governments responsibility is safety and sovereignty.
@tornadoredcabby @theonjax @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Either way, Citizens first
@tornadoredcabby @theonjax @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Obviously not or we would have no homeless citizens.
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump My father, my brother, and my son, as well as myself are all vets. When we joined the military we swore to follow all lawful orders. Uphold the constitution of this country. And defend this country from all enemies foreign and domestic. Illegal entry = enemy.
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump This has absolutely nothing to do with politics, and everything to do with our country’s laws and it’s constitutional requirement of sovereignty. Our country is first and foremost bound by its laws and secondly to its responsibility to its citizens.
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump Obviously whatever help it was it wasn’t enough.
@gina21764 @610_731 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump If those in the caravan that arrive at our border follow our laws rules and regulations pertaining to entering our country there will not be any problems. Those who have already entered our country in violation of our laws should be punished Severely, no matter the reason.
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump The really interesting thing is the fact that Mexico is not helping these poor souls. They must not want the burdens they bring with them because they are busy taking care of their citizens. Novel concept, huh?
@gina21764 @drdocdoctorson @kurtrosenwinkel @realDonaldTrump In which case those that are left will not pose a threat, and not one shot will be fired; assuming the ones that are left are willing to enter our country in accordance with our laws and regulations.
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Even the countries they are fleeing have laws about entering their respective countries. Along with those laws are penalties... The USA has American Citizens that deserve our help before even one of those people walking so far deserve our help.

@davidhogg111 100% agree! Our elected officials first thee duties should be 1. Enforcing our country’s constitution completely. 2. Seeing to it that 100% of our citizens are taken care of - housing - food - jobs. 3. Ensuring the sovereignty of our country from all threats.

@davidhogg111 My question to you is do you understand all your responsibilities as a citizen? Voting is only the beginning. What will you do for society?
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ The responsibilities of being a citizen belong to everyone no matter their beliefs, age, color, sex, religion. Nobody has the right to turn their head the other way just because they don’t want to get involved. A safe society requires everyone to be involved.
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ Most importantly the value of life needs to be taught in our society, in our schools, in our homes, in our workplaces. Instead of penalizing those who have done no wrong, punish those who have. That includes all the people who see something wrong and do nothing.
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ I’ve had guns in my life since I was 8 years old. I’m over 50 now. Never once have I shot a person. Never once have I considered shooting a person unless myself or my family were going to be harmed.
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ The answer is society needs to punish wrong doers for doing wrong and the punishment must be severe enough that it’s not worth committing the crime. Objects don’t kill people. People kill people.
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ I have no problem with reasonable regulation:	Vetting to ensure that the wrong people are restricted from buying or owning fire arms of any kind.	Buying age = 21	TRUTH: No law, rule or regulation will stop a criminal from committing a crime; even murder.
@byst @eva_hoskins @JanisCJMSCJ No matter how much you try to validate an object it’s the actions of a person using the object that cause the damage. Whether a gun, a knife, a screwdriver or a car will never hurt a person unless a person causes it.
@eva_hoskins @byst @JanisCJMSCJ The only way this will stop is if our society, our government, our police and our justice system learn to hold criminals accountable for their actions and make the punishment not worth the crime. You can’t blame objects of any kind for the actions of bad people.

@NormOrnstein An AR-15 is not an assault rifle: The AR in “AR-15” rifle stands for ArmaLite rifle, after the company that developed it in the 1950s. These rifles may cosmetically look like military rifles, they do not function the same way.

@JCali1967 @SenFeinstein @KevinDarryl @POTUS All the countries in the world with unbalanced tariffs against the USA will find that trade with USA will be balanced or they will face equally high tariffs with USA. The playing field will be leveled.
@JCali1967 @SenFeinstein @KevinDarryl @POTUS No need. @POTUS will take care of it as always by putting #AmericaFirst and keeping #AmericanCitizens first. #BuildTheWall #EndVisaLottery #EndChainMigration #MAGA

@KamalaHarris Why complicate what is not complicated?
@JCali1967 @SenFeinstein @KevinDarryl @POTUS I wasn’t talking about produce. Mexico has tariffs against USA for goods like cars and electronics built in America for starters that are +70%
@JCali1967 @SenFeinstein @KevinDarryl Mexico will pay for the wall. @POTUS also promised that trade between Mexico and USA will be evened. So the only way Mexico won’t pay for the wall is if Mexico removes their trade Tariffs with USA. Mexico can’t afford to do that.

@RepMarkMeadows There should not be a law enforcement agency or a member of a law enforcement agency that is above the laws of our land. Those same agencies and members of those agencies should be held to the highest standards of the laws of our land.
@QuidProPanda @cheaptrickone @BuddyMay6 @bobaloo_1 @fubaglady @ljbruton @trishwakeford @RepMarkMeadows The Nuremberg defense: Lawful orders ("an order is an order"), is a plea in a court of law that a person; whether a military, law enforcement, a firefighting force, or civilian population; not be held guilty for actions which were ordered by a superior officer or an official.

@MoniquePressley Until laws are passed to fix the underhanded billing practices of the hospitals, doctors and medical facilities there will never be affordable health care. Step 1 is to protect them from frivolous law suits. Step 2 is protect the patients from ambiguous billing.

If everyone treated their families and their bodies as sacred and with respect then they would all be better off.

@SneakersNSaxes @DRAGH31 @KamalaHarris @MoniquePressley 1/2 You overlook the fact that a persons color is only skin deep we are all red on the inside. The Liberals and Democrats are the ones who have spent the last 100 years dividing, separating and segregating the citizens of this country.

It’s not that the care doesn’t exist. It’s that the care is overwhelmed due to an ultimate lack of moral and family values, along with an overall lack of respect for health. More often than not health problems could be avoided if people would take care of themselves. https://t.co/ZTAKhrHilg
@DRAGH31 @KamalaHarris @MoniquePressley Yet no one will talk about the obvious reasons that the loss of morals in all walks of life are the real reason for the devastating health problems we are seeing today. Only a return to the days of healthy living and healthy families will fix this ailment.

@KamalaHarris Maybe it's time that the California government examined it's careless spending habits. If they don't do that I bet California will soon have 6.1 million less citizens.

@kerrie_pruitt @katiecannon2 @KamalaHarris The Republicans havent held true power in our government since before 1960. The Democrats have held the true keys to the kingdom since then. Go take a look at the powers of The House, The Senate, The Supreme Court and the DOJ and you will see the Democratic Strangle hold.
@realOvi3 @timelyrepairs @BeeboBaggins01 @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats I was quoting the United States Declaration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
@realOvi3 @timelyrepairs @BeeboBaggins01 @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Obviously the current system doesnt do that. If the system was so simple that there were no loopholes or exceptions then the playing field would be leveled. It's called a flat rate tax with no exceptions.
@magilla63 @nytimesworld I take the time to investigate for myself. I dont believe anything anybody says unless I can verify it for myself. In this case the fact those talented girls were denied visas to the USA was irrelevant to the story and only served NYT's Political Agenda.

@4amdg @SenateDems @SenBennetCO The funny thing is those social safety nets were not there when my family needed them. All those benefits were being given to the liars, cheaters and thieves. It’s a good thing I was prepared not to rely on the government to help me.
@4amdg @SenateDems @SenBennetCO I know people like that too. I was one of them. Then I realized if I was going to have the life I wanted that I could either improve my value to society or work myself to death. I chose the first option. People must learn to be independent before they can be codependent.
@4amdg @SenateDems @SenBennetCO I don’t believe that families should leave the disabled behind. I do however, believe that the disabled are the responsibility of their families not the responsibility to the government to be taken care of. This is why individuals, families and communities must be strong.

@bigassholetrump @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Oh sorry for using the wrong term. The house and senate are still not doing their job.

@Auroraknite @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs And obviously not educated enough to know your responsibility as a citizen either.
@Auroraknite @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs My claims are based on fact. Don't know what or where Ridgy is.
@SecularSpicoli @Auroraknite @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs So why aren't you POTUS? Seems you are perfect
@Auroraknite @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Congress didnt provide a bill that could pass the vote
@scott_vfr @rarmenta_ @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @POTUS cant pass legislation. Congress and Senate do that
@sricha6516 @SecularSpicoli @Knightyknight30 @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs I respect Donald Trump as the President Of The United States. He is not God. He does not know everything
@IngrahamAngle You cant win a war with politics. Either unleash the military or get out
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Fortunately we dont live in a dictatorship where one person makes the laws rules &amp; regulations 436 People must do their jobs!
@Knightyknight30 @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Bring back patriotism to The United States of America!
@SecularSpicoli @melissacevans33 @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Nope. All political partys should be disbanded!
@DawninCO1 @rarmenta_ @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Thx!
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Trump has done more in his 1st 100 Days than Obama did in 8 years! #SuperSuccess
@glennbeck No government shutdown. No pay and no benefits for Congress and Senate if they cant negotiate a spending bill
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs We are 100+ days into 2017 - Congress &amp; Senate have been in session less than 50
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs He cant negotiate if they are not there.
@scott_vfr @rarmenta_ @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs We are 100+ days into 2017 and Congress &amp; Senate have been in session for less than 50
@melissacevans33 @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Much better than the Liberal, Democrat, Socialist Koolaid of the last 50+ years
@Knightyknight30 @SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs We are in a hell hole right now because of the Liberal, Democrat, Socialist policies of the last 50+ years that are destroying our country.
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Who said Republican Congress &amp; Senate are doing their jobs? Not me. We are 100+ days into 2017 &amp; Congress &amp; Sentate worked maybe 50
@SecularSpicoli @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs That's before it was discovered that congress and senate don't do their jobs
@Fairy_Gmother @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs Since R's &amp; D's won't do their job it's the only way to get anything done!
@BernadineGillet @rarmenta_ @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs The R's &amp; D's are too busy with their agendas to actually vote on legislation
@rarmenta_ @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs At least he doesn't abuse them like Obama did for so many years!
