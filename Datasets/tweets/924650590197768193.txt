@chrisdelia have you ever heard of the phrase, ‚Äúwell tickle my belly!‚Äù ? My dog just said it to me and i don‚Äôt know what she means. Pls help.
@1a A very dear family friend lost their teenage son two years ago. When watching the mother‚Äôs sorrow something clicked for me. Heaven has to exist for parents who lose their children too soon. It‚Äôs the hope of seeing loved ones again that keep the idea of heaven going.

@JoCarolPierce @JohnCornyn I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and i want an investigation, but the way this has been handled makes it really seem like it is a political ploy. Which makes me very upset that the topic of sexual assault would be used that way.
@JoCarolPierce @JohnCornyn Honest question.... couldn‚Äôt she maintain her confidentiality and also ask for an investigation? The FBI investigate things in confidence all the time. They could have been done with the investigation at this point.
@kprclc @SenFeinstein The fact that you can‚Äôt understand that taking a life isn‚Äôt a question of life says so much more. And way to just misdirect instead of answering the question. No conceiving doesn‚Äôt take away her rights, it‚Äôs just that there is another life (with rights) to consider.
@kprclc @SenFeinstein What rights are stolen from her?
@SenFeinstein How about the personal liberty of all the innocent lives taken by abortion? When does their personal liberty matter? The most basic right of all... the right to life should ALWAYS be protected. So yeah let‚Äôs talk about rights.

The biggest lie we have told women is that they need to kill their children to fulfill their dreams. This is not women empowerment, this is anti-feminism. https://t.co/UCMgRDIHmv

Abortion is not family planning. 45 Years and 59 million lives lost... enough is enough. #standupforlife #endtheviolence #endroevwade https://t.co/CGoqfUnuyG
@NancyPelosi You mean: 59 million lives ended after #RoevWade. Affordable family planning is one thing, but violent ends to innocent life should not be okay or celebrated. #riseupforlife
@mxrgee In addition i would be curious to see how many kids up for adoption or in foster care would say their life is a waste or not worth ever having. The very assumption that kids would rather be dead than have a chance at life is, in my opinion, incredibly insulting.
@mxrgee I think this is a misconception, many support charities that help with these issues. Also i came from a very prolife community that had many families that adopted or fostered kids.
