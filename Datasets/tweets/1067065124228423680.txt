@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 You're not focused, you're pivoting and equivocating and trying to get me down a path of argument that I am not interested in going down. You've already proven my point over and over again.		I wouldn't consider myself knowledgeable on the subject. Somewhat informed.
@ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 This is the point I'm trying to get across, I'm really glad you made it. The Muslim community have been depicted with a dehumanizing light for so long that people don't think of a young girl gleefully saying that phrase as a reflex like we'd say "Thank god!".
@nypost i think we need a journalism revolution, articles like this are so worthless and they target morons who don't even read them.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Yes, these things have happened. And they are bad. Do they account for the entire religion? No. It's extremists. Same as the white men who commit school shootings. 		That's my point. You are afraid of almost 1/3 of the global population because of some extremists.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 I gave you my central argument and now you're trying to do a dance to change the subject.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Also the US military, majoritively men, which has carried out more death &amp; destruction in the world in the 21st century than any other force...they're all terrorists that foreign countries should be concerned about and afraid of allowing entry.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Okay then. A tiny percentage of white males who perpetrate the overwhelming majority of mass shootings in the US have now made the entire group terrorists.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 my central argument is that you are an islamophobe for being afraid of a religion of 1.8 billion people and a region of the world where they are the majority. 		you don't want muslim people to drive your cabs because instead of being normal people they might be terrorists.
@marklevinshow your schtick is so tired, Mark. you had some fire in your belly when i used to listen to you a decade ago. Now you're just out here making a fool of yourself.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Saudi Arabia is where Bin Laden came from and 17 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. Why did we not invade Saudi Arabia - but instead Afghanistan, then Pakistan, then Iraq? 		Because our media hypnotized us into Islamophobia, and our military then destabilized the region.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Again. You literally are proving that you are an islamophobe. A tiny percentage of people are terrorists or terrorist sympathizers (and why, by the way, do they have the US so much? maybe because the US is terorrizing them?) and therefore you want to discount the entire group.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 This is a very stupid line of defense. It IS a religion if 1.8 billion, just like Christianity is a religion of 2.19 billion with different sects. So you proved nothing with that. 		Second, wahabbism is the biggest problem for radical muslims. 1/2
@Rosiecvec @tomwatson I'm observing a pattern. I think it's funny how out of touch the neoliberals are. Guys like Tom are why Trump won the presidency. Their establishment candidate lost the Electoral college. All they had to do was not trip over themselves to lose, and they couldn't even do that.
@RulesElsa @ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 What do you think that proves? It proves our media has made the west terrified of muslim people. Again: it's a religion of 1.8 billion people. The overwhelming majority of those people are peaceful, average humans. Being afraid of them &amp; their language is what Islamophobia is.
@HowardSchultz to the staffer reading this: ask for a raise, drain this idiot's bank account as much as you possibly can
@ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 It's an extremely convenient propaganda tactic to equate people saying "God is Good" or "God Bless America/God Save the Queen" as extremists. 		Islam is a religion of 1.8 billion people. Demonizing a phrase that they all use is preposterous and the definition of Islamophobic.
@ShireenQudosi @KillerFlamingo1 Okay so what about our far right evangelical christian Republican politicians, unchallenged by Dems, saying "God Bless America" constantly and carrying out 7 wars in Muslim-majority countries? Is the US military a terrorist organization as well?
@tomwatson You've been tweeting on a daily basis in a negative way about Bernie since before he even announced his candidacy. Why would anyone who isn't already in your bubble listen to your opinion? It's not an objective one, and it's not coming from a place of good faith.
@CNNPolitics oh yeah make sure you get Castro and Delaney, two people who are not even memorable to their own immediate family &amp; friends, in there over Bernie. 		great job CNN you guys are always so on the pulse
@AlanDersh why'd you take that plane so many times, Alan?
@thehill it's hilarious that republicans are so desperate for legitimate, popular guests that they went for this guy. Bob from Bob's Discount Furniture turn you guys down?
@amjoyshow @nayyeroar Joe Biden is 		a. the author of the Crime Bill which is responsible for the worst aspect of the War on Drugs and set the precedent for the PATRIOT Act, which effectively voids the 4th ammendment		b. extremely handsy with women, which creeps everyone out
@KillerFlamingo1 @ShireenQudosi No she doesn't believe in sharia law for the US. Most Muslims are similar to most Christians or Jews in that they do not take their religious text literally and don't strictly adhere to every aspect of it's culture. 		In short: it was a coincidence. Nothing to do with 9/11.
@KillerFlamingo1 @ShireenQudosi it means "god is great". It's an extremely common phrase among muslim people. Westerners are so terrified of Islam that they believe people saying "God is great" are somehow signaling terrorism or something. It's because of the propaganda campaign post 9/11. https://t.co/c0D2oxdRnW
@JohnAnzo we don't respect the voice of pundits who have cheerleaded for neoliberals. she represents the base of the party, not the people who have grifted for decades while the US gets worse.
@rolandscahill I'm more inclined to believe he's a coke or meth guy. He's not sloppy enough to be a drunk, and he's got no impulse control so if he was a drinker I bet he'd be drunk all the time. There's been rumors about adderall and diet pills with amphetamines in them, and I can see it.
@HowardSchultz shhhhhhh
@thebobbynelson @KlasicalLiberal @dpakman lmfao okay buddy trump not releasing his grades after publicly demanding that president obama needed to is a totally irrelevant fact
@bigmoneysucks @KarinDianeRyan @MSNBC @BernieSanders @ZerlinaMaxwell Fox goes without saying. From it's inception, it was apparent that they're just a propaganda outlet. Roger Ailes proposed the idea as "GOP TV" to Nixon, and when the Fairness Doctrine was repealed under Reagan he got his wish.
@KlasicalLiberal @dpakman remember trump's public campaign to get Obama's grades made public? Then they were, and he didn't still believe them?
@Thomasurlatoile @GeoffMiami isn't sally albright a shareblue pundit? makes a whole lot of sense.
@HowardSchultz it's hilarious that a staff member has to read these replies and find a way to spin it into a positive. 		(reading overwhelmingly negative comments like "shut up, coffee bitch") "well mr. schultz, the response was ...um, well you certainly are stirring up conversation!"
RT @mitchellvii: Lol, Ted Cruz said Democrats have gone "bat-crap crazy."		Sometimes you just gotta say sh*t Ted. :-)
@MattWalshBlog the left was galvanized before Trump - we didn't like Clinton and felt we got snubbed. we've got a LOT we want to get done when we get a real leftist in office. Trump is irrelevant to us other than being a key example of how low the right will stoop and how unprincipled they are.

I can keep going. We do not need Howard Schultz to be the president.
@terrywelty @PatCunnane @HowardSchultz ...student loan debt, which is non-dischargeable, is an insurmountable bubble even though employment seems to demand more and more education just to get a decent job	...credit card debt, seen as a supplemental way to survive between paychecks, has a similarly massive bubble.
@terrywelty @PatCunnane @HowardSchultz and as a result, the rich have all gotten richer...		...housing costs have skyrocketed,	...households that used to function with one income now need both parents to work, and often more than one job	...climate change has exacerbated, with no meaningful solutions
@terrywelty @PatCunnane @HowardSchultz Tax cuts to the rich "encourages investment and economic growth", that's the entire basis of the Trickle Down Economics that we were sold in the 80s.

All of the rich people who oppose Trump oppose his vocal racism, but like his "fiscal policy". Schultz started running because AOC said she was going to increase his taxes.

@mydogleonard @adoredeb @SallyAlbright Again, I'm fine with that being implemented as a standard. As far as I know, it's not the standard. So you can't retroactively impose it. I agree he should release his taxes, as do his supporters. If you wanna start a conversation to get him to do it, I'm here having it with you.
@Sferr @SallyAlbright she's the only one who ever has during the primary season, and that's because she knew she was going to get the nomination.
@mydogleonard @SallyAlbright Not everyone who likes Bernie is a "democratic socialist". I like Bernie because he's been fighting for the issues that I believe in since I got interested in politics in the early 00s. He's been vocal about things that I care about at times where no one else was.
@DCMorgan1972 @SallyAlbright That is a false number. Jill Stein got 1.06%. Bernie voters did not vote for Trump. It's a myth that was made up by insiders who were shocked that Hillary, their obvious winner, lost...and not by the popular vote, but by the electoral college.
@adoredeb @SallyAlbright Okay I agree with you, and I see no problem with this. But is this the precedent, or are you just making up metrics that you find to be good ideas?
@Sferr @SallyAlbright When have primary candidates ever released their tax returns? Did we see Ted Cruz's tax returns before Trump was the official nominee?
@DCMorgan1972 @SallyAlbright Who did? Hillary won the primary and the popular vote (because we reluctantly voted for her) and lost the establishment fixture failsafe that also elected Bush 43. The insider of all insiders lost the insider race. 		It's not our fault. It's yours.
@SallyAlbright So you're going to rebuke the base? AOC is a protege of Bernie. You're gonna leave her, too?
@SallyAlbright no we're not. we know that precedent means a presidential candidate releases their taxes, and are in agreement that Trump should have. 		please don't make things up, it's divisive in a party that you guys repeatedly claim you're trying to unify.

@CNNPolitics it's hilarious that you went with schultz &amp; klobuchar before sanders. at least kamala's the moneyed interest favorite who'd have a decent turnout. cnn has no idea wtf they're doing.
@GOP the GOP is blatantly misusing their own megadonors' think tank's study. the Mercatus study showed that the current system would cost $34T, meaning we'd save $2T with the implementation of M4A. 		It's unsurprising how low the GOP has stooped ever since the Kochs took over.

@markos isn't it sad that a man who once stood for the left now takes pride in owning/operating an echo chamber?
@YouKeepUsingTW @KlasicalLiberal @AOC @nypl NYC is a thriving economy. They're the richest city in the USA. They don't need to give $3B to a company that won't pay any taxes and will displace its own residents. 		There's never zero net new jobs in NYC.

@TheRickWilson if bernie ran against trump, he'd have won. klobuchar, harris, gillibrand, booker, and biden all would lose to Trump. 		the establishment wing of the democratic party is a gangrenous appendage that has outlived its usefulness. time to amputate. go start a centrist party.

@Odaat08 @prageru @AOC I don't, actually. I don't like waiting for things. Also, using Amazon doesn't mean they're not an unethical company. Regardless of both of those points, NY is a city that operates by and for the rich. Gentrification, which is already a problem, would've gotten far worse.
@GlennKesslerWP @thedailybeast it backfired if you're in the DC bubble, I guess. on Twitter it seemed to resonate and everyone who defended Abrams got ratio'd, just like this thread.
@ShellbackGolden @prageru @AOC NY is literally the most capitalist city in America. It's the most financially dominant, outrageously expensive city in the US. Socialism and NYC are so far removed that they might as well be on opposite sides of the galaxy.
@prageru @AOC This is a win for @AOC and for NY. Not a win for the elite and oligarchs. Amazon would skyrocket rent prices and enrich land owners and real estate developers.
@Variety damn kenan's career is legendary
@yesthatCarlo the tides are turning. populism is a tsunami, and the levees the rich have drained the world's wealth &amp; resources to build aren't going to hold.
@rennyzucker @weepinggold @whothewu @El_Binario @MattLibman @jdavidgoodman @lachlan that's not what anybody's position is. it's more than likely that money will be allocated to another rich person/group with their hand in the cookie jar. NYC is ruled by the elite, which is why Amazon was going to move there in the first place.
@rennyzucker @El_Binario @MattLibman @jdavidgoodman @lachlan When did giving billions to the richest company in the world, which would displace the entire surrounding community due to skyrocketing rent costs? 		Have you ever been to NYC? Gentrification is one of the biggest problems there. This would make it exponentially worse.
@kylegriffin1 @walegates well...this is a great thing, but i'm honestly baffled it took til 2019 to get a law like this in place.
@As_d3_3spadas @prageru @AOC @amazon oh yeah, the financial capital of America is definitely going to go bankrupt now that Amazon isn't getting $3B in public funds to build their tax-exempt corporate HQ
@prageru @AOC @amazon when i make my billions i'm gonna strut on into the richest city in the country and say "give me 3 billion dollars so that I can ""create jobs"" (and enrich real estate developers in the area, and displace the entire surrounding community)"

@michaeljknowles @IlhanMN my favorite thing about the young batch of propagandists on the right is that they select specific responses to pay attention to. that's usually because they're getting constantly dunked on over and over again.		that's what you do for a living. get dunked on &amp; pretend otherwise.

@LaddieLone @benshapiro I know that. Bernie polled much higher than Trump in a head to head. Both were populists, which is what America wanted. Clinton was a miscalculation and she thought it was in the bag, but the whole system missed the populism swelling in the USA.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro okay dude. I'm out. This is going in circles. God bless you, keep on fighting for what you believe in.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro Gerrymandering is the strongest in the Southeast. Take a minute to look at the shapes that their districts make. 		The EC was put in place because it was impossible to count all of the votes and relay that to DC in time. It has proven itself to be an inept, outdated 'failsafe'.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro Yeah. You're right about that last sentence. The left wanted Bernie, not Hillary. But she still won the popular vote, meaning the people actually would have preferred her to Trump. The system chose Trump. Hooray.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro What are you doing? What are you trying to prove by reciting these facts to me? Why is county your metric of success? You and I are both aware of gerrymandering. Clinton won the popular vote but electoral college, an unaccountable group of insiders, chose Bush43 &amp; Trump.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro It's a swing state because it swings from right  to left. There are a lot of evangelicals, racists, and old retired right wingers in Florida. When someone who they want runs, they show up to the polls. When someone they don't want runs, they don't.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro Saying "try again" doesn't make you right. Trump won Florida and Bush won Florida. It's a right wing state full of retirees from the East coast.
@LaddieLone @Roberth56356296 @benshapiro No they didn't. The facts don't back that up. The right wing evangelicals voted for Trump and the racists voted for Trump. Some centrists certainly voted for him, but most of them went for Clinton. The polling and facts support this conclusion, unlike your made-up assessment.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro That's an inaccurate assessment. Just because you say things doesn't mean I'm going to blindly accept them.
@LaddieLone @Roberth56356296 @benshapiro I know. I know all of this. That's why the left doesn't actually like her. Centrists like her, MSNBC/CNN viewers who are in their 50s like her. The real base of the left thinks she's a crook and a fraud.
@AJB27881834 @benshapiro i don't care about your opinion on bernie. i am explaining what the actual left focuses on. you, just like the rest of the right and the entire establishment, are afraid of bernie. he wouldn't be coming after you though, my friend. just the robber barons.
@AJB27881834 @benshapiro Bernie won the primary in a ton of states. Why would you ask me a question that you could easily google? Clinton won because the system preferred her and was terrified that Bernie would end the billionaire fun-time extravaganza where everyone can buy politicians and rig the rules
@Roberth56356296 @LaddieLone @benshapiro i said the left. not the centrists. she did win the popular vote, btw.
@AJB27881834 @benshapiro okay. that's a right wing opinion. i'm explaining to you the spectrum of thought. the real leftists want bernie. clinton was a gift to the right because she'd have done enough of the elite's bidding that she alienated the left wing base of the party.
@AJB27881834 @benshapiro most people who vote democrat are center-left. the left wingers wanted bernie. they voted for her because she was the mainstream media &amp; wall street's selected candidate who won the primary. in their mind, she was better than trump.
@LaddieLone @benshapiro the left didn't want hillary. the centrists accepted her and the right-wing corporate/political establishment wanted her and put an incredible amount of money behind her.
@AJB27881834 @benshapiro she represents the corporate elite. so did her husband. Third Way Democrats were a compromise with the right, as they were pushing the Overton Window further right during the 90s.

@is_aoc @MarkDice To suggest that this guy's job should include memorizing why public figures have been banned so that, when asked, he can give a succinct and accurate answer is naive or disingenuous. It proves that you either don't know how corporations work, or that your audience doesn't.
@is_aoc @MarkDice You have presented two extremes: A CEO who knows literally every detail about everything, and a CEO who knows nothing about nothing.		The guy runs a publicly traded multi-billion dollar company with many important, varied subsidiaries. He's the big picture operator.
@is_aoc @MarkDice (or are you replying to someone who blocked me? i cant tell)
@is_aoc @MarkDice No that's not what I'm saying at all, and I have no idea how you concluded that based on what I said. I don't know why Jones got banned either, but I doubt it was because of hate speech.
@is_aoc @MarkDice No, you're missing the point. The point is that Jack is the CEO, who isn't responsible for minutia. The algorithm is responsible for banning people, so he'd have had to review the algorithm's report logs and remembered those specific details. To expect that is preposterous.
@is_aoc @MarkDice An algorithm is what is responsible for banning accounts, not a human. If Dice gets banned it's because he was reported and upon automatic, algorithmic review, was proven to have violated TOS repeatedly. That's why Jones got banned, which is what Dorsey said on JRE.
@is_aoc @MarkDice You have a responsibility to your shareholders to maximize profits. That's the only thing he has to do. There will not be a public outcry that effects his stock price because he didn't remember why Jones got banned.		Nobody but us cares about Mark Dice's opinion about Jack.
@mitchellvii you're such a petty, sad man
@is_aoc @MarkDice That doesn't answer my question. Should the CEO know all the details about a specific person getting banned? Thousands of people, 'celebrities' or otherwise, have been banned from Twitter. Is he supposed to memorize the reason for each in case someone asks him?
@MarkDice You know he's the CEO of the company, right? Not the hall monitor? Why should the guy at the very top know the details of everyone who gets banned?

@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Unfilled jobs for LOWER WAGES. Most of those jobs are part time. Our economy is not doing better by any measure other than Wall Street.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks In effect, you do not care about any local economy, or any actual free market, because you want the people with unlimited access to resources and power to be even less inhibited by our already-purchased government so they can buy EVERY community, and employ them for less wages.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks If they can offer cheap products because they have virtual slave labor in 3rd world countries, everyone in the world loses except for the peoplegoing to the store to buy some cheap, disposable products they'll have to buy again in a few years and the masters.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks You get cheaper goods and you lose the ability to sell your skillset to your local community or to expand your business to compete with regional or national businesses. 		Deregulation doesn't help the little guy, it helps the big guy crush the little guy uninhibited.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Also disenfranchising consumers from interacting with the global economy as anything other than a consumer. If Walmart comes to your town, it will devastate the local market and put tons of people out of work. When they can't work, or they have to work at Walmart, they lose.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Okay. Cool. But that's not how the world economy has worked in centuries. There is a system in place and it sustains itself on all of our money. The people telling you being pro-deregulation is good directly benefit off of the implementation of that idea. You don't, though.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Reading information hand-crafted by people as an investment to propagandize the population and the government as a way of shifting the discussion to favor implementation of policy that enriches them and their buddies. 		Yeah. You lick boots.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Free trade doesn't exist. We will never live in a world with no government, and every nation's government is negotiating in their own self-interest. The more power a nation has, the more power they have in shaping the world economy's rules.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks One situation is how it could be, and one situation is how it is. How is it false?
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks It saves the American consumer money in the short term but it also devastated our workforce and made it so all of us are totally alienated from how goods are created. Now very few small businesses can compete with multinational behemoths. All because of 'conservatism'.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Globalization happened because the rich got richer and saw a way to get EVEN richer: invest in government corruption, slash your labor &amp; product costs, and get yourself some propagandists to make the stupid masses believe your trickery is just the way it is.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks That's not why. It's because globalization wasn't as pronounced as it is now. When everyone got  their taxes cut in the 80s by Reagan, they bought all their own stocks to raise their prices and started monopolizing &amp; exporting labor to the 3rd world.
@Mediaite waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i'm oppressed waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah - former nixon (the guy who started the war on drugs) aide
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks That's one perspective, sure. If you really think that the country was negatively impacted by being rescued from the Great Depression by pro-human policymaking, you again, are a bootlicker. Believe whatever the master says, and never go on strike. 		Labor got you the weekend.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks To what extent is cutting taxes conservative? If you cut taxes on a manufacturing magnate, who invests those dividends in buying off a government official to deregulate his industry, allowing him to pollute your local river, is that conservative?
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Yes it does. If they build the institutions from the ground up and hire all of the people who work in them, they're doing so as an investment. Not a virtuous good. They work backwards from the conclusion the donor wants, which the donor uses to prove their points.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks He also changed his position on killing civilians in Iraq despite them not attacking us since then. Because everyone nowadays realizes how reprehensible it is.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks That's because the discourse has changed and he got new marching orders.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks What would you rather have? An educated, healthy, well-fed population who all work in the country for slightly less rich billionaires? Or would you rather have rising income inequality and stagnant wages while CEO pay is at an all-time high while invading 7 countries?
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks how much have we spent on expensive foreign wars that don't benefit us in the slightest? How much have we spent on allowing the billionaires to dodge taxes in foreign countries and export their labor to the 3rd world?
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks You've been tricked, my friend. The greatest years of economic prosperity in America were from the 30s to the 70s. After the great depression, during the New Deal where Social Security and Medicare were created at the interest of the people.  Since then, we've been declining.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks It's not actually conservative. It's corporatist. These people will continue to get richer and richer and eventually all public services will be privatized and monopolized under their wealth.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Yes he did. 	https://t.co/rs4VGGyUZY
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Heritage Foundation wrote the Affordable Care Act, which was then demonized by republicans despite their donors' thinktank writing it as a response to the traditional leftist goal of single-payer healthcare. 		All of it serves to exacerbate the wealth gap and enrich the barons.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Koch own the Heritage foundation, Cato Institute, Mercatus Center, and Americans for Prosperity. They fund the entire Freedom Caucus in congress/the senate. 		Since the 80s they have controlled the entire political/economic conversation from a policy and a punditry standpoint.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks ...is proof that you're a bootlicker. You're willing to accept anything that a guy like Ben, whose motives are obviously to please his bosses rather than to use his platform to advocate for his audience's best interests.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks The truth in the information age is subjective and partisan. Both of us, from opposite sides of the aisle, recognize that. For you to tell me that the words coming out of a family whose wealth has grown by 1000% since the 1980s due to investment in politicians/propagandists...
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks I'm not paid enough to counter-argue Ben Shapiro in a professional sense. If I were, I would have my own fake newspaper where a bunch of my flunky friends all get inflated paychecks to spout exactly what our donors want to hear.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Wilks and Koch invest in these propagandists because they want their viewpoint that tax cuts for the wealthy are beneficial to the economy, that religion should be taught in schools, that "big government" is inherently evil, and that climate change isn't manmade.
@thehill TRY IT.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Therefore, when Ben is seen as an investment and not some gritty rough&amp;tumble entrepreneur, all of his publications can be seen as propaganda that serve a purpose rather than spontaneous philosophizing just for the sake of logic &amp; reason. Thus, this book is propaganda.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks It's called "right wing welfare". Tomi Lahren does it, Charlie Kirk does it, Stephen Crowder, Dave Rubin, etc. All of them got their start by getting the attention of conservative billionaires (who want their taxes lowered &amp; agenda passed) and then receiving funding from them.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Ben Shapiro's "The Daily Wire", which he is the Editor-in-Chief of, is a money-losing subsidiary of "Forward Publishing LLC", the two owners of which are Dan and Farris Wilks. The Wilks brothers are fracking billionaires who want their agenda codified. Ben is their investment.
@IsaakMercado1 @CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Ben Shapiro's entire career has been funded by the same people who donate to politician's campaigns. Those donors want their agenda &amp; policy out there for the gullible masses on the right, and therefore they buy ppl like Ben newspaper outlets which always lose $. For propaganda.
@CarlosLozadaWP @benshapiro @broadsidebooks Oh good another propaganda book from propagandist Ben Shapiro

@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill But not the oligarchs. They're moral and are simply profiteering because of market law, and not for personal gain at the expense of the people.		In a world where you can invest in a private prison, which generates revenue from slave labor, government and regulation are necessary.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill Your head is in the sand, then, my friend. Enjoy the bliss of ignorance. God bless you, good luck in your business. I sincerely hope when the economy crashes in the next few years it survives. Seeya out there in the twitterverse.
@johniadarola "We can't afford healthcare for our citizens", said the comfortable narcissistic billionaire with numerous homes, luxury vehicles, and the ability to dodge taxes
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill Your opinion doesn't matter. The system is set so our economy takes precedent over our government. Government and regulation are demonized, all as a ploy to lower the wealthy's taxes and set the rules in their favor. 		After Citizens United, bribery in the US is legal.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill And also your competition, many of whom work together to set rates/prices in favor of the administration and not the workers. 		It's really clear what I'm saying. Labor collectively has been getting screwed for decades. You're just dismissing that outright even though it's clear.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill What if you force the government because you used your earnings to create a think tank and use a lobbying firm to bribe politicians to usher your think tank's hand-crafted policy into law? Then, you lobby them to cut your taxes which you invest in more politicians? Is that okay?
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill Okay, and if the wage to be competitive in the job is $7.25/hr in a major city and you/your board all have multiple homes &amp; luxury vehicles, there is no magical invisible hand that's going to bridge the gap. Inequality will continue to rise until your head is in a guillotine.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill But the huge corporations set the precedent that the rest of the economy must react to and compete with.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill Demand sets wages in theory, but our economy is completely intertwined with the stock market. Mega-corporations can bribe politicians to deregulate their industry and cut their taxes so they can re-invest their wealth into monopolization. 		We don't live in a free market.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill You can talk about concepts all day long, but we live in a world where people have yachts with smaller yachts inside of them while the vast majority of humanity are starving, and most of the ones who are not are in varying levels of financial dismay. All while CEO pay rises.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill There's no market law that determines wages. The people who determine the wages are the boards of directors of companies. If you're in charge of the money, you can decide you get to keep a disproportionate amount of it. Labor don't get to negotiate, which is why they get screwed.
@thehill IF I WANT TO BUY MYSELF A PRESIDENCY I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK
@johncardillo and then what? you guys get a third justice and we all get decades of pro-corporate reactionary policy? pass. nice try.
@InsiderFood https://t.co/4MowY0pYHw
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill No they won't. The reason wages are low is because our economy is a syndicate of individuals whose only overarching goal is to profit and retain/expand their power. CEO &amp; board of director pay is at an all time high. They're never going to vote to decrease their cut of the pie.
@johnniestephen @thehill @GOP they never were. that was a marketing campaign and a political strategy.
@thehill yeah. we know. trump's policy advisers are either crooks looking to personally profit off of their office, or they're evil ideologues trying to implement a nazi-like agenda.
@deezaintmypants @vexwerewolf @thehill yeah. a spending problem on our war machine. tax breaks to the rich, but everyone else's stagnant wages are pilfered to pay for rich men's resource pillaging wars.

I know you've got faith in your ideology, and I find it commendable. I'm just sad that you've been led astray of your true faith by liars &amp; frauds.
@x9driver @mitchellvii Your base is a lot smaller than you think. The evangelical christian right is the loudest voice in politics but its numbers are dwindling. That's why Bill is so nervous. That's why Trump goes on Twitter every day saying "WITCH HUNT!" because he's afraid. I find it funny.

@RoyBatt40866883 @DwyerEllen @SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules Native American or Indigenous. He's not from India and neither are his ancestors. 		His drum beating was a political statement because he was at the Indigenous People's Rally in DC. For a political protest.
@imilex @CassandraRules Do me research? I do indeed.
@DwyerEllen @RoyBatt40866883 @SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules I'm convinced
@CassandraRules They went to the Lincoln Memorial where the Indigenous People's Rally was going on.
@RoyBatt40866883 @SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules They instigated it by showing up to a rally that his people were putting on. They went to the Indigenous People's rally and harassed them and chanted "build the wall", even though indigenous people aren't latin american. It was a racist mob of kids riled up by a racist president.
@RoyBatt40866883 @SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules Just so we're clear: 		Indigenous People have a protest, which is swarmed by teenagers who intimidate and harass those people, and since you saw one angle of footage that made it look like they were there first, somehow they're correct in harassing this elderly Vietnam vet.
@realistxleft @CassandraRules it was an Indigenous People rally. he was protesting, and they showed up to harass him &amp; his people and chant "build the wall" which is about latin americans, not natives.
@RoyBatt40866883 @SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules He was drumming. Peaceful protest. AT A RALLY FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.
@SunIn0urEyes @CassandraRules At the Indigenous People's Rally? He got in their face at his own people's rally? They didn't swarm his rally and get in his face then chant "build the wall?" 		Cmon man. Do better. Do a LITTLE research. 	https://t.co/n7wkUVRedG

@Headlines_From @Mediaite I'm not saying their lives should be ruined, but that isn't even the conversation being had. They're likely going to face no consequences at all and we're expecting the people that bussed them in for the March for Life rally to hold them accountable.

@cmoog57 @ClintonGuajardo @AnnCoulter This is a movement that will take another century to correct, and the way we do it is the same as our forefathers did it. I'm proclaiming myself on the right side of history by denouncing Ann's views and arguing with her followers about it. If they're still fighting, so will we.
@cmoog57 @ClintonGuajardo @AnnCoulter Trump isn't the problem, he's a symptom. Same with Ann. I'm on the side of the people who fought against segregation and won. The same raucous group of people who loudly jump to Ann's defense descended from those who opposed having people of color in their schools.

@ClintonGuajardo @cmoog57 @AnnCoulter They're coming to America in search of the American dream. Is the American dream not valid to them?		That's not the point, though.

She says she doesn't want illegal immigrants on TV but nobody asks her about her stance on changing the rules for seeking asylum.
@ClintonGuajardo @cmoog57 @AnnCoulter I don't care about your tired opinion about socialism. The system we have is capitalism, and under that system our government has obliterated and pillaged the third world and now we're mad when their refugees come here looking for an opportunity and can't wait a decade in line.

@Chinchillazllla he responded to me then blocked me a minute later idk what he said https://t.co/itx9XhWAoY
@ClintonGuajardo @cmoog57 @AnnCoulter If we didn't want illegal immigrants coming into America, our CIA shouldn't have destabilized their nation's economies fighting "communism" for the last 100 years. 		The problem are oligarchs who own the media and propagandize us to do what they want. Ann is their employee.
@ewsdisit big man using MGTOW terminology has logged on
@ClintonGuajardo @cmoog57 @AnnCoulter Saying your beliefs are synonymous with the truth is a very easy thing to do. It's harder to live in a virtuous way and support people who embody "Christian" principles.		All you're doing is repeating what pundits are telling you. The immigrants aren't the problem. Oligarchs are.
@ClintonGuajardo @cmoog57 @AnnCoulter pretty sure they were talking about me
@cmoog57 @ClintonGuajardo @AnnCoulter in the first world, Christians are not persecuted. the fact that you're afraid of christians being targeted is proof that you wouldn't want to be marginalized in society...yet you support a woman who marginalizes latin americans and poor african americans on a daily basis.
@ClintonGuajardo @AnnCoulter Her stance, absolutely, is consistent. She is a vocal racist who is supported by the entire media structure. You bringing up one of her positions, which just so happens to go against a group comprised entirely of people of color, doesn't override her decades of racist babble.
@AnnCoulter Don't act like you want legal immigrants here either, Ann. You just don't want brown people coming to America. Of all people who shouldn't have a platform, you're in the top 10.

@beachshack101 @CassandraRules @AOC I was talking about a woman trespassing on an elected official's property and trying to illegally enter their home and it being recorded and livestreamed to the world, and her walking away without being arrested. Because she's privileged and pretending to be persecuted.
@LizardRumsfeld @thetomzone master race right here
@Headlines_From @washingtonpost Well, I agree in part. What I disagree with is that leaders even matter for protests. I don't give a damn about the leader of an organized protests's opinions about a public figure. They're protesting because they're mad about the way our country is going. No leaders. No masters.
@gidgetbardot1 @CassandraRules @AOC They don't get away with trespassing on elected officials' properties. If they tried that, they would be imprisoned or murdered. 		Loomer climbed over a wall to prove that we need walls to prevent invaders. Kinda contradictory, don't ya think?
@beachshack101 @CassandraRules @AOC Name a single time that an illegal immigrant trespassed on an elected official's property and tried to enter their home unlawfully. 		I understand her demonstration, except she proved that walls don't work by climbing over one. So it was just a stupid waste of time.

@GaleChristina @eshaLegal You wouldn't have rallied behind Bernie, though, would you? Even if the base was more with him than with her?

@Mark_t_lassiter @leprechano @BuckSexton It was a "witch hunt" which Trump also participated in, not to expose Obama as a non-American but to cast a shadow of a doubt on the legitimacy of his presidency. Fox News did that for 9 years straight,		Now that their president is target, its "fake news".
@Mark_t_lassiter @leprechano @BuckSexton Joe Arpaio, a corrupt and racist sheriff from AZ, is not a reliable source. He's some guy who regularly went on Fox News, saw the manufactured scandal about Obama not being American, and took right wing billionaire donations to head a fake investigation.

@ID7Dee @FellaMom62 @prageru @TheDemocrats Hey moron. Read the link I gave you. The original video is misrepresenting the study to get idiots like you to blindly agree with them while they get more tax cuts and you get nothing and your family die from preventable ailments.
@ID7Dee @FellaMom62 @prageru @TheDemocrats It saves 2 trillion dollars from the bloated system.

Even if we're making slight headway, the rug is pulled out from under us and all of the work we've done is carefully dismantled by the other side.
@sheanabana @Justin56618066 @doctor_eon @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson First off, Bush and Trump both lost the popular vote their first election and were elected through the electoral college. We always capitulate and vote for your weak candidates. Gore would've been a fine president, far superior to Bush, but I wasn't old enough to vote.
@sheanabana @Justin56618066 @doctor_eon @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson And yet it's getting much worse every year.

@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson You're wrong. It's not a cult of personality, it's a base who will be active in politics during more than just the election cycle. We like Bernie because we've heard his ideas and we want them to be put in motion, we couldn't care less about his personality.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson He lies a lot? ???  Bro, Clinton started the war in Libya to sell guns. Obama was the second best president in history for the defense contractors. If Bernie is disqualified for being connected to them, so is everyone. 		He voted with the NRA because VT is a rural state.

@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson I disagree with that vote and I think it's a blight on his record. That being said, he's still the politician with the best outlook on Wall St corruption. At least he isn't wholly owned by them like everyone else is.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Trump came in and destroyed the ACA almost immediately. So...great. One president does tremendous damage, the next president comes in and tries to plug a couple of holes on a sinking ship and when he's gone, the looting continues.		What's there to be excited about on the left?
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson I agree. And yet, the rich consistently got richer and wages for the rest of us stayed the same. Clinton expanded Reagan &amp; Nixon's drug war. Student loan debt and credit card debt ballooned because neither of  them regulated wall street because both were funded by them.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson ACA was a Heritage Foundation proposal. It's a right wing policy. Millions more got insured on a system run by private insurance companies who work with hospitals to artificially raise prices to make every entity profitable. 		Who loses? The consumer. 	It wasn't enough.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Incrementalism is feckless and weak. There's nothing incremental about what the right has been doing,  so we wouldn't even counteract their destructive actions.		You guys had your time. Bill Clinton and Obama were incrementalists. You all blew it. Now it's time for actual change.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Every other industrialized nation has government healthcare. Nobody in those countries goes into debt when they get sick or break a leg. 		In America, most people can't afford an ambulance to get to the hospital. Your solution is to yawn at the base for trying to fix that.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Let's just be incrementalists while the economy is funneling money upward, wages are stagnating, and 79 million Americans are in medical debt even though every other industrialized nation has nationalized healthcare. 		Sounds great. Beto 2020.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Medicare for All isn't a slogan. It's a policy.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson It'll pass when Democrats are in power again. ACA was a Heritage foundation plan. We're done playing pattycakes with the right wing while they shift the overton window further and further right.
@doctor_eon @Justin56618066 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson He got Amazon to raise their minimum wage  to $15 after introducing the "Stop Bezos" Act. It's not revolutionary, but it's a step in the right direction. https://t.co/youSXmRgsV
political discourse is fun and rewarding
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Okay so you link me to an article from a guy who is on the wrong team but is funding a progressive outlet whose goal is to uncorrupt the system. And that's a bad thing?
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson "The relationship between the conservative Louisiana politician and the founder of the progressive media outlet stemmed from both making the removal of money’s influence on politics their signature issues. "
@angiestweeting @tomwatson He joined for the money? Hilarious. He became a Democrat because it was the most viable way  for a progressive, left wing person to get into office and enact the change he's been fighting for for decades.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson The base didn't reject Bernie. The establishment did. 		When we get Trump 2020 because we run Beto (who LOST to Ted Cruz) or Biden (who wrote the first draft of the PATRIOT Act), it's not going to be on us. It's going to be on you guys.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson It was founded by their owner and Kyle Kulinski from Secular Talk as a codification of Bernie's policy proposals. 		Funded by Republicans? Lmao. You're making stuff up.
@D16_twitt3r @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Okay but he ran as a Democrat and is on the left. What's the problem? Because he won't wear the team's uniform he's not a good candidate?
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson We're already galvanized. 		Both sides ARE taking advantage of our people, and the base is not willing to play the same game we played in 08 where everyone got excited for a guy who gave us a right wing healthcare plan and the biggest drone warfare campaign in history.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson It's not more detailed and thorough. It's empty. It's a bunch of words that were written by a think tank and given to her as her campaign. 		https://t.co/3YdgiylLOY		There. That's the policy we want. As you can see they don't just say "issue is bad", they give a solution.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Your idea: keep running bad milquetoast candidates and ignore the base of the party, which is galvanized because our economy sucks and we've been taken advantage of by both parties for 30 years. 		Cool. That's what it comes down to, and your side will lose.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson It's untrue that the Clinton foundation used donor money to buy a gold mine in Haiti? 		On one hand we have a political insider who somehow lost an election against Trump because she was a bad candidate with a bad past. On the other hand we have 4 decades of social work.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson https://t.co/us1ABQPm52		None of this is policy. They're ideas that she wanted to address but proposed no actual solutions.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson I see your "Bernie is corrupt because he profiteered off of something bad" and raise you a "Clinton owns a gold mine in Haiti" 	https://t.co/0CEI9HbELi
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson She talked about "More Good Jobs". That's not a policy proposal, it's flowery rhetoric.
@TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson @justicedems Fun chat, god bless, keep fighting for what you think is right. I'll seeya out there.
@TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson @justicedems You're a brick wall. We've reached an impasse. I can provide any amount evidence (debates being scheduled on weekends instead of primetime, Brazile leaking questions to Clinton before debates, etc) to prove my claim and you will flippantly dismiss it.		The base is with us.
@CarrieSweet2017 @TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson What an empty critique. You'd be happy with Kamala Harris whose "walk" and "talk" are scripted for her by donors, but Bernie, the guy who has been fighting for human rights and a functional economy for the working class for 4 decades, isn't sincere.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Yes it is borne out of evidence. Listen to a Clinton speech verses a Bernie speech from the campaign. Bernie's entire political history is POLICY based and not personality-driven like Clinton/Beto/Obama/Biden/Harris/Booker.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Jesus christ man. What policies did Clinton run on? She ran on "stronger together" and "I'm with Her" and didn't propose anything interesting for the entire campaign. 		Just because you say things doesn't make them true.

@PhoenixEamon @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson This doesn't seem like the DNC rigging the system against him to you?
@TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson @justicedems Do you pay attention to the news, or did you just wake up today and begin reciting centrist talking points? https://t.co/8DPkTTimfL
@TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson That's your interepretation. To me it looked like the guy went on a tour with the head of the DNC at their request and discussed policy like he always does. 		It seems very clear to me that no matter what Bernie does or says, y'all will hate him.
@TheZMage @CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Alright, I'll concede that point to you. Now I have a question: do you honestly believe that the most policy-centric political group in the entire country was convinced to vote for Bernie by memes from Russia? Do you think it made even the SLIGHTEST impact on us?
@CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson Is your position that Bernie is a covert operative for the Kremlin? Are you out of your mind?
@CarrieSweet2017 @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson He didn't tell his followers that  there was a "active Russian disinfo supporting him" because he didn't know about it.  		He voted no on the sanctions because it also included Iranian sanctions, which he thought would ruin the Iran deal. https://t.co/B2FkyspPzk
@TheZMage @HoarseWisperer @tomwatson He...didn't put too much effort into traveling the country with Tom Perez and giving speeches about unity? What?
@HoarseWisperer @tomwatson When? When he ran as a Democrat? When he campaigned with @JusticeDems? 		Or did he just actively work against the DNC, who were proved to actively work against him?
@nathanTbernard i think i did a really excellent job editing this image https://t.co/gtdjHo0bmO
@tomwatson He didn't face active opposition last time? From within his own party? From the DNC? Are you serious?
@HoarseWisperer @tomwatson He did a unity tour with the head of the DNC, and has been attacked constantly by every center-left hack pundit as well as the entire right wing. 		You're attacking him right now, and will absolutely dismiss your own campaign against the Bernie people as justified.

@HelenELais @armandodkos Bernie also has more credibility because of his VOTING RECORD which is why we like him. 		You gave me a 10 tweet cookie-cutter platitude rant that nobody fits better than Bernie.
@HelenELais @armandodkos I'm not wrong. You are saying he's self-centered but base that on nothing. He is a populist who has the following of a huge swath of the base.		Clinton wasn't self-centered using the "I'm with Her" slogan? What evidence do you have that any other candidate isn't self-centered?
@HelenELais @armandodkos I do not understand your "Empathy: Not Bernie" thing at all and everything else I agree with and I think Bernie fits excellently.
@seanhannity Unbiased opinion from Trump's #1 fanboy and confidant
@hipsterhotel @eclecticbrotha Why do you believe you're in the position to frame this conversation? You've dodged everything I've said. 		I'm a progressive. I caucus with Democratic candidates, representatives, and senators on most things. I study policy and each person's voting record. That's why Bernie's #1
@hipsterhotel @eclecticbrotha You're doing nothing to disprove anything I say, and you're siding with the powerful and comfortable over the desperate pleas of the party's base. You and the publications/pundits you consume are feckless and are the reason our party continues to lose.
@hipsterhotel @eclecticbrotha As for the ACA, it at the very least provided some people with basic insurence. Still, 79 million Americans have medical debt. 		You can be smug all you want but you are doing nothing for the discourse.	https://t.co/Rvrr0xPdb8
@hipsterhotel @eclecticbrotha We got nothing to prevent the financial industry for collapsing the economy. Wages never recovered. Interest rates on savings accounts collapsed. Inflation increased, but everything else stagnated and wealth continued being redistributed upward.
@Tzipshmil @eclecticbrotha Okay so when you initially dismissed my claim that Obama was similar to Bush in foreign policy, was I wrong? Or are you just going to keep confidently dismissing what I say and providing no refutation? 		My "mediocre saint"'s policy record beats anyone you'd present.
@logan48227 @setislady @eclecticbrotha https://t.co/8DPkTTimfL
@hipsterhotel @eclecticbrotha What financial industry reform?		Also the ACA was written by the Heritage foundation and still allowed the private healthcare companies to control the market and keep health costs high. I agree it's a step in the right direction, but was it enough?
@conservmillen It's really easy to dismiss the opinions of the majority of your age-bracket when you're getting that Fox News money.

@setislady @eclecticbrotha Beto lost to Ted Cruz.		Hillary lost to Donald Trump. 		Biden is only popular because of him &amp; Obama's bromance but has been on the wrong side of nearly every issue.		Who else? Harris, Booker and Klobuchar are all donor-employed. 		Who's left? Bernie, whose record &amp; policy shine.

@rook429 @HelenELais @armandodkos Okay so how do you then? Run Claire McCaskill types who stand for nothing and will vote with Wall St and Oil companies most of the time?

@tribelaw How bout you guys stop attacking Bernie and proposing milquetoast neoliberals? Clinton lost to Trump. 		We were forced to vote for Clinton because pundits demonized him for the entire campaign AND SHE LOST! Why would we run Harris, Beto or Klobuchar? Bad records. Weak candidates.

@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey I don't like Israel lobbying, or any other country lobbying in America. 		She didn't declare herself as an agent because it was an active covert operation carried out by Putin to get Trump elected because he didn't want Clinton in office. Prinze acted covertly for the same reason
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey That lobbying is not lobbying, it is collusion. I don't care what title you'd give the agent. It's yet another individual who as acting at the behest of the president to collude to get their agenda across in exchange for helping him get elected. 		It's plain as day, man.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey My stance on lobbyists is that they're among the most useless leeches on society and actively participate in the malignant cancer that is crony capitalism. 		Regardless, it's not the same thing as lobbyists if it's one president reaching out to a candidate trying to be president.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey Again, you're nuance-trolling and outright dismissing evidence because you already have a conclusion in your mind. I have provided arguments, you have tried to dispute them and failed.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey Trump's son met with a lawyer to get information re: Hillary in the building that Trump lived in. 		Can you really not see that this is explicit evidence of collusion being attempted from both sides? Prinze goes to Seychelles to reach out for Trump. Butina comes here for Putin.

@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey No, I am just an active consumer of political news and an active participant in political discourse. She was openly working for Russian GOVERNMENT interests with the intention of getting the PRESIDENT to act in accordance with the wishes of their PRESIDENT. That's espionage.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey It's yet another attempt at setting up a back-channel with the express intent of shaping Trump's policy. It's very clear that Russia attempted to do this numerous times, and that many people close to Trump were receptive to these endeavors.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey There are multiple smoking guns. Here's another one. 	https://t.co/z3SLDuSkGT		I understand that "Russiagate" is an overblown scandal the media hypes up. What I don't get is why when y'all see multiple pieces of evidence pointing to a conclusion, you ignore it.
@Gregory_Pecked @mtracey USA's stance on her employers is that they were actively trying to undermine the political process and install someone who would inevitably do what they wanted with the executive office. 		You and OP are being pedantic just as a way to nuance-troll away their actions &amp; intentions
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt You people are so out of touch it's a disgrace. If there was an actual free market, you would never have survived as a legitimate broadcast network.		Seriously. We're drowning in debt in a stagnating economy, CEOs of failing companies get 9 figure raises, and you give us this BS.

@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski Regardless, you do have a point that we need to differentiate ourselves from the centrists with a term. Your term could work, and a few terms I said also could. Good point either way.
@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski Yeah you're right, and that kind of lends to my first point of "leftist" being a good label. At this point we've taken flack from these people using their framing tactics since the 60s. Fuck 'em, right? Why not just stand up and say "yeah I'm what you say I am, and we will win".
@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski Why not "Democratic socialist"? That's the most recent phrase that's been used and it's taken its' fair amount of flack from the right wing and won't be embraced by the centrist liberals...but it persists and is growing in popularity. Context isn't great, but it is a true label.
@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski Well I do agree with you on that for sure. In this day and age, though, they'd find a way to latch on to the grass roots movement and steal our labels anyway. Actual progressives know who is and isn't on board with the message and we all point it out to one another.
@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski Eh. I get it, and I'd be on board if it gained some traction. I think Progressive works fine, though.
@grumpybirdieS @KyleKulinski I don't really like the connotations that the prefix "Neo-" has. Neocons are terrible. Neoliberalism is terrible. I think we should just own Progressive or scrap any label and adamantly own "Leftist".

@Tampke @doanfilm Til then, God bless. Fun conversation, and helpful for political discourse as a whole. See ya out there.
@Tampke @doanfilm We'll see. Stay tuned, like I said. This is going nowhere because you're splitting hairs and ignoring the overwhelming evidence that Trump is implicated in felonies. 		It's clear we both have a bias. When the trial occurs, I'll reach back out to you and see if it's any clearer.
@Tampke @doanfilm Okay so if I murder someone and nobody rules that I'm guilty because the trial hasn't happened yet but there is evidence that I did it that is publicly available, does that mean I didn't murder someone?
@Tampke @doanfilm It IS illegal. I underlined the part that says that this time. https://t.co/7xcmwKtJbM
@Tampke @doanfilm Buddy. I showed you where Cohen broke the law. The trial hasn't happened yet because the memo was released less than a month ago. They are on recording discussing the payment. It violates campaign finance laws and Trump is directly implicated. You're talking out of your ass.
@Tampke @doanfilm His personal lawyer took money for his campaign to pay a person he had an affair with to be quiet. How did that have nothing to do with him? What are you talking about?
@Tampke @doanfilm Not yet. Stay tuned, though.
@prageru There certainly is:	https://t.co/5RPm34aggI https://t.co/mzjuYZyjbb
@Tampke @doanfilm Initially you said Cohen's arrest had nothing to do with Trump. When I disproved that, you moved the goal post. 		You're afraid that he's actually guilty, and it's clear that you'll argue from any point to reach that end. I find that pathetic. I wouldn't do the same for Hillary.
@Tampke @doanfilm Cohen, his personal lawyer, did the crimes at his behest. Clearly he is also implicated in this. You're quibbling over little nuances to try to cast a shadow of a doubt, but you've done nothing to disprove my argument.
@Trice0610 @conservmillen And like I have said, abortion will still occur for those who can afford it and do not want to raise a child. The only people who will be punished by these laws are people who are already in dire situations. Y'all's solution is "don't have sex lol" or "idk raise the kid, lol bye"
@Trice0610 @conservmillen I'm in the same boat as you. But your side, like Allie here, want to ban abortion because they consider an unborn fetus to be a human and therefore terminating a pregnancy is murder. They're much less empathetic when the children are born and flippantly give platitudes as advice.
@Trice0610 @conservmillen In an ideal world, sure. But you're saying that once a 18 year old girl living in poverty finds out that she's pregnant 2 months later due to condom failure, the 'pragmatic' solution is "You shouldn't have had sex, don't have a kid if you can't afford it  ‾\_(ツ)_/‾".
@Tampke @doanfilm It's not illegal to lie about it, but it's illegal to do it at all. Once again, since you are hard-headed: https://t.co/dZ1tFINUDm
@Tampke @doanfilm like, it's all here man. https://t.co/ywV7Vl27Xe
@Tampke @doanfilm from the Snopes article I posted earlier. https://t.co/3jQKm8JhYx
@Tampke @doanfilm It's not a basic screw up for Trump. He intentionally used his own campaign money to pay off the porn star because he knew that it would likely interfere with his election if the story went public. Now that it has, after he lied about it, now he confesses.
@Tampke @doanfilm You don't wanna hear this stuff though because even if you didn't vote for him, he's clearly on your side. You don't want to admit that the guy your side chose is a pathological liar and a crook, so it's easier to just deflect and cover your eyes and ears.
@Tampke @doanfilm And again: this is the weakest line that the Dems have to impeach the guy. He's clearly done so many other impeachable things like violating the Emoluments clause. 		https://t.co/fBFDC0fHOt
@Tampke @doanfilm What's more serious: failing to report your filings and then providing them and paying a fine, or specifically taking money raised for a purpose with laws that apply specifically to that money and instead using it to pay off a porn star and lie to the public about it for 2 years?
@Tampke @doanfilm It's more likely the guy goes down because of his history of laundering money for other country's oligarchs. That's a far more serious crime because if it's true (and it seems very likely that it is), he might put their interests above ours.	https://t.co/EniqlKquPM
@Tampke @doanfilm Paying someone to be quiet using campaign finances is illegal. 	https://t.co/f9o7dD4oOB		Obama failed to report his campaign finances correctly. He didn't use them to pay anyone off, much less his mistress. 	Personally I don't care that he did it, but it IS illegal &amp; impeachable.
@Tampke @doanfilm When did Obama pay hush money to a porn star he had an affair with? When did he direct his lawyer to use campaign funds to do so?		You think that Cohen, Trumps lawyer, using Trump's election campaign to pay a women Trump lied to America about banging to be quiet, acted alone?
@Tampke @doanfilm Not chief of staff, I misspoke. Campaign manager. Regardless, it's very clear that the house of cards is falling down. The people who all decided to take what he said at face value (even though he's acting mighty guilty) are doing so because it feels better to believe him.
@Tampke @doanfilm So his former chief of staff and personal lawyer are facing lengthy prison sentences. Flynn is not facing any prison time because he cooperated. In the Cohen memo, Mueller says that Cohen uses campaign funds to pay off Stormy Daniels. That's a felony at Trump's behest.
@Tampke @doanfilm You haven't seen any because you're either not paying attention or you're purposefully averting your eyes. The Mueller investigation certainly has been tight-lipped about their case, but it seems very clear that every pundit on the right is scared of what might happen.
@Dallas4Bernie @scapelliti @commondreams There's always money for war and whatever else the xenophobic Fox viewers can be convinced of. When it's time to talk about financing, blame Democrats.
@Tampke @doanfilm Yeah actually that is pretty normal. Bosses bang their secretaries all the time. 		That's not the point. They seized a moment to go against a sitting Democratic president because they're powerhungry. Now that there's a legit case against one of yours, I see a lot of equivocating.
lmfao what https://t.co/3u1AvkjysG
@DCasseli @doanfilm It isn't "eye for an eye". It's "The Republicans get to do whatever they want with or without power, and when Democrats retaliate we all pretend we want bipartisanship". 		We're not playing their game anymore. Bush gave us the Iraq War, 08 crash, &amp; PATRIOT Act. Catastrophic.
@DCasseli @doanfilm Republicans filibustered Obama a staggering amount of times. When Trump got elected, they removed the filibuster from the Senate all-together. 		Republicans held up the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice for 14 months then rammed in 2 in less than 2 years.
@causalities_tie @doanfilm Trump hasn't lied constantly since he got into office? What if he's found guilty for these crimes they're investigating him for and it turns out he lied about it for 2 straight years?
@doanfilm Remember when you guys impeached Bill Clinton over an affair?
@charliekirk11 Obama removed sanctions on Iran, he didn't give them money. You're so uninformed about basic stuff that the only possible conclusion is that your donors pay you to mislead your stupid audience.
@Trice0610 @conservmillen You're reiterating my "There Are Consequences For yOur Actions" point, which proves that you don't actually care about what happens to these children after they're born.
oil barons spend their dividends on floundering media properties like @crtv because they lobbied the government to allow them to not have to pay taxes. then @crtv gets acquired by another unprofitable company and everyone pretends they're not just propaganda outlets.

@bendynaa @AnaseSkyrider @dogmaticscorpio @conservmillen I concur. Our current method of harvesting meat is not respectful, however. Factory farming is a horrifying issue if you accept that a soul or conscious mind exists in animals aside from humans.
@bendynaa @AnaseSkyrider @dogmaticscorpio @conservmillen We certainly have no way of gauging a fetus's viability or, more abstractly, when they develop what many faithful (myself included) consider a "soul" and most consider a "mind". It is not at conception, and we debate the trimesters. Do we know? No, we don't.

@twolvesfanbuck @AnaseSkyrider @kelmeckiis @conservmillen You have a position and you stand on your moral high ground shouting down to everyone who disagrees with you that they're wrong and evil for their beliefs, then you feign concern for those suffering but provide nothing of substance as a meaningful solution.
@bendynaa @AnaseSkyrider @dogmaticscorpio @conservmillen What are you babbling about? You're baselessly insinuating Anase is a pedophile now? Really? Is this what the conversation has devolved to?
@charliekirk11 Yo Charlie's Twitter account manager: Are you paid enough to deal with this stuff?
@twolvesfanbuck @AnaseSkyrider @kelmeckiis @conservmillen If you have sex and find out you're pregnant 2 months later and you're 18 and in poverty, the solution is "maybe you shouldn't have had sex" and "get a well paying job" from the Evangelical right. You care about their lives theoretically but not in practice.

@PHenryMartin1 @conservmillen No, that is not my position. I'm talking about the macro-picture. If abortion is banned, the population will explode. As you see with the state of jobs in America, we're already not doing well. How will society look when the population swells but the wages stagnate?
@DigitalSalesGuy And what happens when the population booms but wages continue to stagnate? If you're concerned with unborn children being murdered, are you also concerned about the middle eastern &amp; african civilians we're murdering? It just seems convenient to be pro-life but also pro-war.
conservatives care a whole lot about unborn lives but aren't that concerned with the living ones
@PHenryMartin1 @conservmillen That's not what I'm arguing, either. 	I get all of your positions on the issue. Many of you have made that clear. I'm saying that it WILL continue to happen regardless of all of your moral outrage over it. 		When the kids are born poor &amp; doomed, the caring tapers off.
@conservmillen I get your side, and I respect your view. Since you're so interested in protecting human life, surely you're also interested in ending our 7 offensive wars with countries that didn't attack us? It'd certainly prevent a lot of tax-payer funded unnecessary death.
@PunkleJones @conservmillen You just reiterated my "There Are Consequences For yOur Actions" point.
@conservmillen Sure. Your side cuts welfare, demonizes its recipients, and then runs on defunding planned parenthood. What is the logical result of that? Impoverished people with no access to birth control being forced to have children they cannot afford. 		What happens next? What's the result?
@ProlifeJ @conservmillen Well one thing I'm doing is not supporting policy which forces poor people who can't leave the country (btw no other country will ban abortion so you're not stopping rich people from getting them by flying to Canada) to have a child they can't afford.
@CNNRGLDN legend wait for it dary
@RichieBenzler67 @charliekirk11 Wikipedia is more legitimate than any source you'd show me to disprove the party realignment.
@RichieBenzler67 @charliekirk11 That's an incredibly convenient narrative for you. It means that current Republican voters' ancestors didn't own slaves or carry out Jim Crow. It's an easy way to paint all Democrats and their 'history' as the root of all evil.		Too bad it's not actually true.
@conservmillen You care about the children right up until they're born. After that, it's "bootstraps" and "There Are Consequences For yOur Actions" when the families can't afford to raise their children. 	Rich people will still be able to get abortions, but the poor won't. And you don't care.

@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra https://t.co/eyLRr7i9eH		This says it better than I could. I'd love to hear you call the Economist "fake news" or some other asinine ploy to dismiss the facts of reality.
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra At least I'm not a sycophant. I criticized my side with more scrutiny than you could, because I know the actual problems with the Democratic party. You just know whatever your media shovels into your half-coherent mind. You're not even particularly talented at reciting it back.
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra You say those things, but provide no proof. 		The voter roll purges and gerrymandering that have occurred under Republican administrations have restricted the voting rights of millions. 		Trump says "3 million illegal immigrants voted", provides NO PROOF, and you believe it.
@MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra Every doctor/hospital that I've ever been to for my entire life? You can show your insurance card, which doesn't have a photo and wouldn't be valid for voting. You don't need a photo ID to get an insurance card, either.
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra You need to verify your identity by providing information that proves it's you like your SSN. 		You are making things up and providing no evidence for them. Your hypotheticals serve no function in this conversation. Where's your proof voter fraud actually occurs?
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra 1. I never said they were too stupid. I said it wasn't necessary. Stop mischaracterizing my words. 	2. What do you actually need photo ID to do besides buy alcohol, travel, and drive? You don't need it to live your day-to-day life in a city. I live in a city.
@MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra I've never needed an ID at a doctor's office. I've only needed it to travel and to drive.		I'm not saying that they're 'stupid' for not having IDs, I'm saying that the life people live in dense urban areas almost never requires having photo ID. Especially for young people. 		2/2
@MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra First off, I said "young people" for a reason. 	Where would you get an ID other than the DMV besides a passport? You get a non-driver ID at the DMV, too. So if you have no reason to ever go to the DMV, you wouldn't ever get either. 		What items at stores? Alcohol?	1/
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra A good way to ensure that people who will vote against you don't get to vote is to arbitrarily require everyone in a major city to now need photo ID. If this isn't made clear  to those people, they'll show up to vote but find out they can't. That's why they're doing it.		3/3
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra The ENTIRE point that I am making is that people who rig the system to work in their favor do not want people who tend to  vote Democratic to vote, so they do whatever they can to ensure their voter rights are interfered with. See: the recent Georgia election. 		2/
@ClintLongwell @MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra You don't need photo ID if you don't have a car. Therefore, unless you specifically saw this law that said that you need voter ID (this is a new initiative, therefore you could have voted your whole life without ever needing ID), you would have no reason to go get one. 		1/
RT @NathanJRobinson: It's Noam Chomsky's 90th birthday! Here are some lessons I've learned from his work over the years... https://t.co/Cpq…
@SteveBa77916947 @RealSaavedra I am speaking about the way that it actually is, why it's like this, who made it that way, who it benefits, and who is being targeted not to vote. 		You are giving me hypothetical solutions and theoretical answers to this unjust and disproportionate voting system.
@SteveBa77916947 @RealSaavedra Yeah, you can. Will you? Is it guaranteed? No. It's very likely that people who aren't politically engaged don't even know about photo ID being newly necessary for voting. 		Also where? Which Photo ID would be valid to vote that isn't affiliated with the DMV?
@SteveBa77916947 @RealSaavedra If you don't have any reason to go to the DMV to get a license, it's unlikely you'll just randomly wind up having one. If you don't have a car, you don't need a license to live.		The people who gerrymander districts and invest millions in elections know this. They bank on it.
@MendesVlademir @RealSaavedra No, and you believing that is a ridiculous and disingenuous proposition. If you live in a major city and don't own a car, you have no reason to go and get a driver's license. Therefore, many young people who live in poorer urban areas (not just POCs) are less likely to have ID.
Hillary's sycophants are better at writing than Trump's. Still unbearable though. #personalitycult https://t.co/Igl4d3aQdK
@RealSaavedra How many actual cases of voter fraud have been recorded? 	It's a red herring. Black &amp; latino voters in major cities (who tend to vote Democratic) are less likely to have a photo ID than people in rural/suburban areas. Voter ID laws are made to limit the amount of people who vote.
@KurtSchlichter You have no soul.

@passtotheleft1 @jordanbpeterson They historically have been under-represented in the fields, but now that women are more likely to be in college, the ratio is decreasing. The historic imbalance is still legitimate, and it's only being remedied because men for some reason are less likely to get educated.
@mnorian4306 That's an op ed. That's not news, and it doesn't reflect the base. It's some centrist's attempt to co-opt the word "progressive" from the base.
@mnorian4306 We're not here to talk about which candidate's physical attributes make them viable for 2020. If we do that, Trump and his ravenous base will win again. We have to work against the corrupt system and unify under a candidate whose message and policy positions work for us. 5/5
@mnorian4306 and that bias is impinging on your view of the actual ISSUES. You have said nothing about what you stand for other than things like inclusivity (which Bernie supports - again, he campaigned with a number of WOC for the midterms), yet you are arguing from this smug lofty place. 4/
@mnorian4306 The point that I'm trying to make is that your feelings about a certain man, which are definitely colored by your bias against the patriarchy (which I also have, btw, it's not like I'm a huge fan of white male politicians either given their history) 3/
@mnorian4306 and you talk to WOC who say they hate Bernie, those two anecdotes negate each other. Therefore, neither of us is any less right than we initially were. 		The issue is that the objective evidence and Bernie's voting record are more significant than how some people you met feel. 2/
@mnorian4306 Okay. But you don't provide any of that evidence to me and so...I'm supposed to just go "okay no you're right actually all my beliefs are wrong". You realize your experience is just as limited as mine, right? So if I campaign for AOC and WOC tell me they love Bernie... 1/
@jordanbpeterson There are also more women in college than men in general. So? What are you even arguing against here? Do you just talk for retweets?
@mnorian4306 He does. You have provided no evidence that  he doesn't fight for everyone. All you've said is that white men = bad. That's not a good enough reason to vote for or against people. The youth, and the base, are interested in POLICY, not identity.
@mnorian4306 You're doing an excellent job at diplomacy with all the subtle insults. You said "the future of the party lies with electing women" which of course is something Bernie agrees with which is why he campaigned with AOC and Ilhan Omar. That's all you've said. No substance.
@mnorian4306 I'm reading everything you're saying. Carefully. You have provided nothing to refute him as the best candidate other than the fact that he's a white man. That's preposterous. He fights for the rights of everyone and has his whole life.
@mnorian4306 Bernie Sanders is a white man, and that's why you're against him? Even if he's right on all of the issues and has an almost perfect voting record for progressive issues? 		That's silly. I'd gladly vote for Tulsi Gabbard in place of him, but it's unlikely we'll ever see her run.
@CeeJayT07381069 @Kokomothegreat Constructive. Taking a page out of Trump's handbook with that alliterated nickname, I see. Really well done. Great contribution.
@mnorian4306 You're not saying what you stand for, you're just throwing shade at Bernie with no sources to back up anything you're saying. You're not really saying anything at all, whereas I'm here trying to have a discussion about the future of the party we both vote for.
@manneb2015 @Kokomothegreat Yeah, I agree. Why can't people accept Bernie, the most popular senator in America, but then want to force people like Corey Booker on us? Just because they say the right thing and have the Hillary Clinton seal of approval doesn't mean they'll actually fight for us.
@mnorian4306 All you're doing is dividing the party. The moderate #resistance who accepts corrupt politicians but then demonizes the ones whose policy &amp; voting record are as pro-human rights &amp; anti-racist as possible. 		You won't win without us, and we'll have 4 more yrs of Trump with Beto.
@mnorian4306 Yup. We certainly are going to have unity in the party when one smugly dismisses the most viable candidate then disparages the guy engaging her in political discourse about the future of our party.		The energy of the party is with me, and not you. Good day. God bless.
@mnorian4306 @Kokomothegreat Obviously my experience is anecdotal - but he is quite inclusive. There are pictures of him handcuffed to a woman of color during the civil rights era in solidarity during a protest. This guy has been on the right side of history since then.
@mnorian4306 @Kokomothegreat You are talking out of your behind, miss. Firsthand. I spend my free time attending rallies and protests and going door-to-door to campaign for progressives here in NY. Everyone I talk to who is informed about his policies likes him.
@mnorian4306 @Kokomothegreat Yes he does have support of the base. I know plenty of POC &amp; WOC who support his message and caucus progressive instead of moderate. The real toxin of our party are the people who accept donations from oil/gas companies and military contractors then pretend they're progressive.
@katalin_pota @nytimes What a fucking surprise. Let's all prepare ourselves for the deafening silence of moderates and the smearing of the deceased from the right. 		Goddamn shame. The guy was doing everything right and still gets murdered by the people we pay to "protect and serve" us.
@Kokomothegreat If Biden's gonna run, Bernie should run. They're the same age and Bernie's got the support of the base whereas Biden will just be our version of Mitt Romney. We've gotta get the people who don't normally vote out, and Bernie did that during his primary.
@NomikiKonst this is what I'm talking about. The M line makes no sense but is relied on by many. Queens and Brooklyn are relegated to the bus system (which is fine, albeit confusing and unreliable). The wealth of NYC has been concentrated in the hands of a group whose interests oppose ours. https://t.co/9kQPLAeuQE
@NomikiKonst They built a new Q stop in the upper-east side but won't close the M loop so that people who take the M from Queens to Brooklyn don't have to spend an hour going through Manhattan for no reason.		The MTA hates the working class of NYC. We're like cattle to them.
@KurtSchlichter This is true on both sides of the American political aisle, although one side has a history of attempting to right the wrongs caused by the elites and the other side has a history of being their political operatives. Both are corrupt but since Citizens United, they're now owned.
@BillOReilly They've got a "neutrality" bias which favors the entrenched powers. When Fox became entrenched, they started playing pattycakes with them instead of taking their obviously dangerous rhetoric to task. The result? The Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Wars, the Patriot Act, and the 08 crash.
@MichaelChauvin @PrisonPlanet Israel is currently carrying out a genocide. My position is pro-human rights - I want the issues to stop entirely with a two-state solution. Obviously I do not want an Israeli genocide - nobody actually does except for extremists who are responding to the IDF killing their people
@ccbandit4resist @NancyPelosi @PramilaJayapal Pelosi voted for the Iraq war and for the Patriot act. She might be better than most for the position, but let's not pretend she's a champion for the base of the American left.
@RatatouilleA @MichaelChauvin @PrisonPlanet Y'all are on the side of the people who intentionally destabilized the region under the guise of 'spreading democracy' and 'fighting terrorism'.

@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza They also donate to Charlie Kirk's "Turning Point USA" and Steven Crowder's "Louder with Crowder".		The grass roots that y'all are looking at is all astroturf funded by one man. He's the Soros of the right. Both are bastards attempting to propagandize the USA for political gain.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza It's not credible. 		If it's funded by the same Billionaires that own the Republican party, it's state-propaganda.

@AnthonyPiseno @MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza No, I didn't delete it. It's in there somewhere. I don't delete tweets or block people, not in my nature.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza Or it's a paid off person who reverse-engineered their study to work back from the conclusion that her donors would want. If she succeeds at PragerU, she might be able to get some Fox correspondent checks. 		It's standard Republican methodology.
@twguardrail @DineshDSouza Again, PragerU is funded by the Koch &amp; Wilkes brothers to galvanize the right with false information. It is not a legitimate source. The people they hire create presentations based on the conclusions that the donors want, not based on empirical research.

@AnthonyPiseno @MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza They voted Democrat and were part of the Confederacy. Now they vote Republican, since the parties switched in the 60s due to the Civil Rights Act being ratified. 		Obviously this has been my point all along. Everyone arguing with me in the thread is trying obfuscate that fact.
@AnthonyPiseno @MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza No they haven't. The founding fathers all owned slaves and the Confederacy under the guises of "states rights" fought the Civil War to uphold their economic institution of slavery. The confederates' ancestors, who still fly confederate flags for "heritage", vote Republican.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza Dinesh Dsouza lied about the parties switching and blamed modern-day democrats for the confederacy's slavery. 		Obviously if he is making such bold, factually inaccurate claims, it calls the entire outlet and their motives into question.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza If I provided a source that you found illegitimate, I'd go find one that was more serious. PragerU is funded by the Koch &amp; Wilkes brothers as a propaganda outlet Dennis Prager (a political pundit - not an expert in anything) can bring his buddies on to make clickbait videos.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza Deny it all you want. Mississippi's senator made a public lynching joke like, last week. 	https://t.co/AK7Sv45eXx		It's plainly obvious and in your face. Nobody wants to admit they're a racist or admit racism never went away and that people resisted civil rights the whole way.
@AnthonyPiseno @MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza Who opposed it? The racist white south that didn't want black people to have rights. DUH! OBVIOUSLY!
@AnthonyPiseno @STC198907 @DineshDSouza It's not a logical fallacy. Alabama had slaves, had a huge segregation/lynching problem, and now handily votes Republican and its' white evangelical christians fly the Confederate flag. The logical track is "racists who always had voting power voting in their own interests".
@MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza The parties switched. It's so obvious. You have done nothing to prove your case and all you're doing is going "lol I don't believe it (but I will not provide evidence to refute it)". You don't come off as a serious person, so I'm off. God bless, later on.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza PragerU is a propaganda outlet.
@MonsterManGrips @AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza Bro you're corroborating my view. It didn't happen over night - he's a racist from Alabama. It doesn't matter which party they identify with - before it was Democrat, and now it is Republican. Look at the population breakdown of Alabama. https://t.co/wFDbZOaDuv
@MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza The  white American south was racist during slave times, racist during Jim Crow, and racist during/after the Civil Rights era. Racism did not end when the government gave black people voting protections and forced places to de-segregate. Those racists voted D before &amp; vote R now.
@AnthonyPiseno @MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza I provide evidence, not just babble on about my own experience and expect people to take what I say at face value and accept me as correct.

That's why MLK JR protested and lead the Selma, Alabama march in 65. Tell me who, again, were the aggressors in Selma, Alabama? Who lives there now - Democrats or Republicans?
@STC198907 @DineshDSouza Who owned the plantations? The confederates. Who are their ancestors? The people who opposed the civil rights act. Who are their ancestors? The bible belt's Evangelical Christian bloc. Who do they vote for? Who does Alabama vote for?
@STC198907 @DineshDSouza It's hilarious that you'd infer I'm rich or white. My account is literally anonymous for the purpose of people making hilarious inferences like that.
@MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza Oh well since some guy on the Internet's telling me that I guess all of the research I've done must be incorrect. Anecdotes from anonymous people which confirm their bias and can't be corroborated doesn't hold any actual water.
@AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza I cited Wikipedia but obviously Wikipedia lists its' sources. You dismissing it but not providing anything in response is a strike against you, not me.
@AnthonyPiseno @DineshDSouza Yes they did. Show me the proof it has been debunked from an unbiased source. You don't get to just say things and not cite sources. Why would I believe you? Are either of us authorities in this matter? No. So let's both provide our actual evidence instead of just hearsay.
@MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza (that's because they're racist. Which side defended slavery - the Confederacy or the Union? Which side does the south vote for nowadays? How did they vote before the 1960s?)
@xUrSoLosTx @DineshDSouza You have not done a good job arguing your side. I provided my evidence and my facts and you provided nothing but being an argumentative pest without the skillset for it.
@STC198907 @DineshDSouza The parties DID switch. It's been recorded in history by sources in &amp; outside of America. Your intepretation is woefully inadequate and cites "authorities" (propagandists) like Dinesh D'souza whose financial security is based on selling his movies to stupid people.
@RedStateRaider @DineshDSouza It's not just the "conservative" Democrats, it's also the same people who believed "States Rights" could be used to segregate people, whose ancestors used "States Rights" to argue for the continuation of slavery. 		The white American south was "Democrat" and now are "Republican"
@MonsterManGrips @DineshDSouza The south started voting Republican in the 1960s. See: Alabama, which pushed for segregation before the Civil Rights Act, which turned Red in response to Lyndon B. Johnson pushing for it. His quote was "We've just lost the South for a generation".
@xUrSoLosTx @DineshDSouza It's not 'excuses'. He has made a film career off of deliberately ignoring the most basic American history so that he can frame Democrats for segregation even though the USA's southeast, which is entirely Republican now, is the furthest right segment of the US population.
@DineshDSouza The parties switched in the 1960s. Everything that you accuse Democrats of doing actually is things that your party did before they became Republicans. 	https://t.co/V6hTtzfVPn		Your movie is revisionist history, rooted in idealistic fiction to say "evil = left; good = right". https://t.co/5prrv7lNmX

@keithknutter @charliekirk11 Okay. Guess you win. I gave you my stance and you gave me a bunch of nothing. When historians unearth the archives of our times, I wonder if your side will come on top? Or will you be seen as just another afterthought; another opposition to justice? We shall see.
@Cernovich she's a grifter who lost her platform. wah wah. womp womp.
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 I explained my position. Pick it apart if you want. I laid it out for you. This is better than one person attempting relentlessly to frame the conversation and preventing intellectual discourse from actually occurring.
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 The point is, our government has been used for evil and the "evil" that libertarian right proposes is a phantom. We've never been communist. Never even close. The things you are all afraid of never actually existed other than the regulations we propose to the rich right.		6/6
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 If our government is going to do anything, it should help people. I don't agree with the scope of government, but the private sector proved itself to be a vampire when it destabilized the American economy in 2008 with the housing market fraud crisis. 		Bush did that. 		5/
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 The government is seen as an evil force because many on the authoritarian right puppet people on the libertarian right with heavily funded organizations which propagate "libertarian" versions of authoritarianism such as supporting gov't use of force overseas or at the border.		4/
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 Government's purpose is to be a flexible, locally-based, structure which serves as the administration of municipalities and the local services. State government should deal with the industries in their states, and federal government should deal with the issues of the nation. 		3/
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 Our taxpayer money has been used for evil acts since the Vietnam war, as well as the CIA's destabilization of the Middle East and South America under the guise of "fighting communism".		2/
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 We do not accept the military interventions overseas as legitimate, and we see the authoritarian right's use of the government's funding to give tax cuts and subsidies to military contractors and the oil billionaires they do business with. 		1/
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 Your philosophy of individualism is echoed on the libertarian left. If you read any of the sources I posted, you come off like a dunce who refuses to take a test because a political adversary proposed he take it. If you don't wanna educate yourself, that's on you bud.
@keithknutter @charliekirk11 We are anti-authoritarian, obviously. Anti-Stalin, Anti-Hitler, Anti-Trump, etc. We abide by many of the same free-trade, non-aggression principles of the libertarian right. We similarly do not want the government involved in our lives.

@memoryisourhome @RubinReport Those are the facts. The facts are that since 2000, Palestinians have been killed at a 9 to 1 ratio to Israelis. That means that despite your claim that the real terrorists and war criminals are the Palestinians, the fact is that both participate in war crimes, but one does more.

@memoryisourhome @RubinReport The IDF indiscriminately kills Palestinians all the time. They build illegal settlements on Palestinian land all the time. Supporting BDS doesn't make you anti-Semitic or pro-Hamas, it makes you a humanitarian who doesn't support war crimes on either side.

@cicknolaianni @benshapiro The context is obvious, man. You trying to pretend Trump isn't a racist and the reason that he sent troops to the border isn't because he doesn't want Mexicans in the country. 		You're ignoring the clear trend that he's followed since his campaign. It's anti-Mexican.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro Take him out of context? The context is that he has a history of discriminating in business against people of color. He and his father refused to give housing to poor black people. Then he says Mexico's "not sending their best - they're rapists, they're criminals" on national TV.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro They're not charging the border. They're trying to walk through the border to come to a place that everyone told them would accept them and allow them to live a better life than they did at home. Like my ancestors did, and like yours probably did as well.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro Language matters. "Charge" is a term that you're using to frame the issue and paint one side a specific way. You're using language to suggest that these people are invaders and that they have ill-intent when they come here. That framing comes from demagogues.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro Cool. Play it off like you don't know what's going on. It's not like Trump isn't recorded using anti-Mexican rhetoric.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro And if you think a couple of canisters being fired at people is acceptable because the people are people you don't like and your media figures told you all about how evil they are for decades, you're an authoritarian and a bastard.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro I don't know dude. I'll go down there and ask them. I'm sure everyone fleeing violence has all of their documents handy and a proper rule-following plan to get in and can wait as long as it takes (even if it takes years).
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro US govt: *Changes asylum laws to make it harder for people to come in legally*	*Targets "chain migration" and begins to register legal immigrants related to illegal immigrants* 	*Sends troops to the border and begins attacking people*		Conservatives: cool 😎 it's "non lethal" :)
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro C'mon son. We're not gassing white people. We wouldn't have sent the military to the Canadian border. Don't act like you don't know what the implied reason Trump sent troops down there is for.
@charliekirk11 Framing the issue in a way that dehumanizes people and erases all nuance. Classic Charlie.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro GAS EM! DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE ARE KIDS OR NOT! DON'T LET THOSE BROWN PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY!
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro Hint: if you have to specify that the tear gas being deployed on the powerless is "non-lethal" you're arguing on the side of authoritarianism and human rights violations.
@cicknolaianni @benshapiro I know it happened. I'm not for stepping on the powerless and gassing them. They're scared and coming from war-torn countries only to find that there is no way in and being handled aggressively by a militarized police force. 		You're fine with atrocities. I'm not. That's the end

@cicknolaianni @benshapiro "Did we gas children? Or did we shoot...gas...in the proximity of children?" You realize how stupid that sounds, right? 		Again: blame the victims, right? Authorities are always right, even when they are inhumane. That's not a position worth defending in my mind.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Fair enough. I respect your opinion and I'm glad I got to discuss this with you. Gotta be off. Good luck down there, try to be safe. God bless.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Some of Mexico is indeed all of those things, but a lot of it is run by the drug cartels and corrupt police forces. I am sure some asylum seekers stay in Mexico or perhaps stay further south on their way up. To them, the American dream is real. That's why they want to come here.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro It's not. You have no idea. It makes you incapable of breathing. It stays in your eyes for hours. It stays in your lungs for days. I got brutalized by a cop for nothing. It's easy to say that the authorities are always right until you're there seeing them acting evil.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro The economic state of most of Latin America can be traced back to America destabilizing the region in the first half of the 20th century. Ever since, we have installed military dictators in attempts to fight against communism/socialism. The result? Brutality. So they come here.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro So you're out there preventing them from coming in, then? You're out there fighting for your views? Or are you just wanking around online like I am?
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro They don't need to be there. They're there as a display of power because Trump is a child who thinks that having three government agencies fixated on the border somehow will prevent people from crossing it. 		A wall won't do it and neither will the military.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro That's where we disagree. Hopefully we'll all get to remain in our comfortable first-world lives and we never become refugees ourselves. It's a hell of a lot easier for us than it is for them. I have a humane sensibility and you have an inhumane one. There's the difference.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Clearly you've never been pepper sprayed. It's debilitating and traumatizing.		I bet you've got a lovely perspective on the Gaza strip issue. Always pro-authority, even if the practices are inhumane. The "real victims" are the soldiers carrying out atrocities.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro It was never the troops' job to sit at the Mexican border and...what? Kill anyone attempting to cross? 		Why do we have Customs &amp; Border Patrol? Why did Bush 43 create ICE? What do we need our military there for other than a big expensive dick-waving gesture?
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Gassing people is brutality.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Yeah. Fuck the victims. The police are always right. 		Gotcha. God bless, seeya out there.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro They brought troops to the border right before the midterms because the "caravan" was a big news story to galvanize Trump's base. Now they're making sure that they're extra brutal so Trump can make it look like it's actually working instead of just a waste of money.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Our core difference is that I am against my tax money going toward assaulting people. I don't like police brutality or ICE brutality or border patrol brutality. Demonizing them and calling them criminals is just a way to justify the violence the aggressors carry out.
@JayRandall84 @KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro The legal process has been rolled back by Sessions' justice department so that it's much more difficult to come in. That is why more people are coming in seeking asylum and why they are now finding they have no other options.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro I don't think they're right for entering the border that way or for throwing rocks. I think it's far worse to assault them.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro That doesn't look anything like 'storming the border'. It looks like some people walking and then climbing, trying to get in because there's nothing for them where they're are or where they're from. 		It's probably why your ancestors came to the USA. It's why mine did.
@Cernovich Bullshit. You know he's not a left wing plant. You're just good at pitching certain ideas and hoping they stick and you see that he's not good for the branding you want for your side.
@DineshDSouza Dinesh D'Souza: Convicted Felon whose entire political career hinges on dismissing the southern strategy &amp; political realignment of America in the early 20th century. 		Paragon of virtue. Thank God Trump used the power of his pardoning to pardon you of all people.
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery God bless.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Also it isn't border patrol. It's three separate government agencies needlessly sent there by an alarmist president who has an extremely racist history against Mexicans. 		It's just clear to me which side of history you're on.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro They're coming here seeking asylum. Process them and either let them in or send them back in a timely fashion. Not putting them in camps. Not gassing them. 		We're fucking America, dude. You're defending barbaric practices that brutal dictatorships use.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Who broke a hole there? Why is it that every possible word you use frames the issue in the side of the militarized police rather than the destitute people?		"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
@ahtsoccer @KazuyaShinogoto @benshapiro The aggressors are the police force in riot gear dispensing gas cans on poor people trying to come into this country fleeing their home country's violence. 		Fuck off. One of us is fine with mass brutality as long as it's not happening to you or anyone you know. The other is me.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Again. Are they breaking through the wall or are they attempting to cross through it seeking asylum and being attacked?
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery Nobody stormed the border. Trump sent the military to the  border to be aggressive toward people who try to come in seeking asylum or otherwise and now look what happens. Kids are getting gassed and put in camps. 		The fact that you think that is acceptable says a lot about you.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro Show me proof the people were throwing rocks instead of the militarized police force just saying that. 		Even if they were throwing rocks, what does that do to people in riot gear? Nothing. 		It's the fault of any individual assaulting a child. I don't care how you dress it up.
@Cernovich You know what his politics are, Mike. Still, good to see you're on the right side of this issue. But c'mon. You know he was at the Unite the Right rally. Obfuscation is your bread &amp; butter though so I guess I get it.
@KazuyaShinogoto @ahtsoccer @benshapiro "Invaders" =/= asylum seekers		We've never done this before.		That doesn't make it okay to brutalize people. 		You, and everyone who supports these actions, is fully okay with the government dehumanizing and brutalizing people as long as they're who you don't like. That's fucked.
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery Okay so when you say you're fine with a specific group being gassed at the border that doesn't show "discrimination or prejudice against another race"? 		Would you be fine with gassing people coming through the border in Canada? https://t.co/1X2Jr3jjgJ
@ahtsoccer @benshapiro 1. The government's agents saw children and said "Yup. Still going to gas those people even though there are children"	2. They are being brutalized. If you have ever been gassed, you realize how traumatic and awful it is. 		But again: defend the aggressors. Gotcha.
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery He didn't do it. But hey, facts clearly don't matter to you. Again, you're just in your own world where you make up the definitions and history is whatever you say it is without providing any evidence.
@benshapiro What's worse - gassing children or being mad about gassing children? I've never heard of a superpower framing an issue as "invaders throwing rocks" as a way to brutalize people. 		Those who defend evil actions are themselves evil. But hey, as long as your base agrees, right Ben?
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery Amused at children of one specific race being gassed using our tax payer money. 		Yeah. That's racist.
@SebGorka @BarackObama Are you kidding me? Bush didn't subsidize GM? The partisan hackery is stunningly obvious. 		https://t.co/HVEhghSlDw https://t.co/BQYSTkVnT3
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery You also don't care about the definitions of words, apparently. You can live in your own tiny little world where you get to decide what words mean, but the rest of us are going to call you out when you do racist things. Clearly you're upset about that, and so is Mr. Woolery.
@Rudydog293 @chuckwoolery I get that you guys don't like the word 'racist'. But hey, maybe if you don't want to be called a racist don't uphold racist beliefs in the public square and back racist policies.
@chuckwoolery You have no problem with the militarized police force gassing children. You characterize asylum seekers as invaders. 		Seems like dehumanizing language and behavior to me. What would you call that if it's directed at only one race?
@chuckwoolery You're defending using tear gas on children.
@BigWendy01 @gatewaypundit It's not going to be me because I'm not affiliated with far-right organizers and white supremacists.

@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 I've never been in that situation, but my house has always had a rifle and hunting knife for the same purpose. I concur that no law-abiding citizen who for their whole life has lived with guns and practiced proper gun safety should be punished.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 Fair point. I wouldn't want storm troopers coming in raiding homes. However, if maybe there was some incentive to join &amp; register, like a small tax credit or something for each weapon, I wouldn't mind that. 		Point is we gotta do something about it.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 If they drove a car without registering, they would be arrested and the car would be impounded. Same logic. Gun licenses &amp; gun registration is a completely reasonable concept but for some reason every time it's brought up the NRA-affiliated lobbyists see to its' demise.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 We're not disarming anyone. You need a driver's license, right? You need to follow the rules of the road so that we don't all die because of someone's reckless choices, right? You need a car registration, right, so we can track who has which car?
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 Therefore the solution is make it harder for everyone to get a gun so that if a person truly feels like they need a gun, it must be registered to them with some kind of smart-lock to ensure it isn't misused by a school shooter or a criminal. 		But instead, y'alls solution is: ...
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 It takes guns to commit the crimes in the first place. The easiest reservoir in the entire world for legal and illegal guns is the USA. The states that have the freest gun laws, like Texas, are the biggest source of guns in organized crime.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 They ARE! FROM SURROUNDING STATES! That's the point I'm making!
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 So your solution is just...let it happen. Charlie Kirk &amp; others regularly complain about Chicago but never give an actual solution. My solution is actually fucking do something about it. 		Great. Good chat, god bless. Seeya out there.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 The guns come from LEGAL STATES dude. Why waste money on importing them from overseas if you can just go 2 hours down the road and get them from someone? The drugs can come from Mexico or through any port via the highway system. It's not like I'm here defending the drug trade.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 Lax gun laws contribute to many forms of unnecessary death in those states, too, but Chicago is where a lot of them wind up. 		That's it. Sorry to spam such a long answer. The solution obviously is make it more difficult for guns to freely transfer within people. 5/5
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 due to the proximity it has to other states with lax gun laws. If you look at a map of Chicago you can see all of the major highways which lead into the city. You can traffic anything, legal or illegal, through those places, and sell them to whoever wants them. 4/
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 guns from legal owners in surrounding states. This obvious and easy method of obtaining guns, and the major drug hub status of Chicago, lead to all-out-war in the streets. Gun crime exists in all major cities due to their drug underworld, but it's worst in Chicago... 3/
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 If Chicago's legitimate industry, which sees massive out-of-state influx on a constant basis, is an example of it's hub status, surely you can understand their underworld. 		If  you're  a criminal in a major city, it would be very easy to coordinate a system of obtaining... 2/
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 Chicago is a major hub of industry and population. Obviously there is a massive criminal underbelly, just as there is in most major cities. This one is a more pronounced example due to it being a major hub at the top of the Interstate running down to Texas. 1/
@aidachavez jeez he looks like he hates himself
@EWErickson Erick Erickson:  (endless babble)	everyone: https://t.co/B4KvzIGond
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 Which is why we need to make it more difficult for the guns to be in circulation. The vast majority of the guns in Chicago were legally obtained outside of it and sold illegally. 		You're not arguing for actually preventing these issues, you're just trying to be right.
@BFT_Podcast Insufferable person; biggest attention-seeker I've ever seen in my life. She made shirts when Twitter took away her check mark and thought anybody would buy them. 		Delusions of grandeur all the way to the top, then back to the bottom.
@EWErickson You're really just firing those tweets off indiscriminately without even taking how each of them goes in any context. It's hilarious. Must be painful for you to see how you're being received.
@cicknolaianni @charliekirk11 So I couldn't buy a gun in Indiana and just...give it to someone for a profit who lives in Chicago? The states that surround Illinois have far more lax gun regulations with administrations uninterested in carrying out the current ones. 		Rules &amp; practice don't always align.
@CNNRGLDN everyone: https://t.co/uj0ZKLksKH
@SecPompeo That doesn't cut it. We've got a huge arms deal with Saudi Arabia, who are the ones carrying out the Yemeni genocide. 		It's like putting a bandaid on a 3rd degree burn.
@itzame4JC @charliekirk11 That's a very stupid assessment. The right wing exhibits far more attributes of fascism in it's current form than either political party has ever had. I'm sure you're gonna say "Nazi = National SOCIALIST" therefore Democrats = Nazis. It's a discredited claim.
@blackroberev @AdamBaldwin @drawandstrike @jack @Twitter Oh well since the bible says it I guess we can just throw every other piece of literature out and just base everything on that forever. Really productive contribution which surely will gain traction in this modern climate.
@AdamBaldwin @jack @Twitter Why not just not be an asshole? Why is it so important for people with anti-trans views to try and force the rest of the world to accept their pedantic "it's not BIOLOGY so I get to call you what you don't want to be called and you have to accept that"? 		It's what a bully does.
@krassenstein @wikileaks @washingtonpost He's done a lot of good for the world. Just because he acted against the entrenched Democratic party in America doesn't mean Wikileaks isn't an incredibly important aspect of modern political history.
@charliekirk11 So unexpected of you, a standard right winger pundit using an old playbook, to bring up Chicago.  		It doesn't actually support your claim that gun control = bad, though. It's easy to buy guns in nearby states and bring them in. Controls/regulations would prevent a lot of that.
@MatthewJshow @charliekirk11 Chicago is an island within gun country. It's very easy to buy guns in every surrounding state and take them into Chicago. It has nothing to do with political parties. State funding in schools &amp; mental health facilities was decimated under Reagan, which destabilized the city.
@pattymo what have I become? my sweetest friend? https://t.co/o54d4kbUhm
@The_Trump_Train very VERY clear case of projection. blame the other side for what you know you're guilty of.
@realDonaldTrump looks like that economic boom you bragged about's running out of steam
Cool looks like Twitter's gonna restrict my account every single day forever until I get a phone and I'll submit a slightly different unlock request every time.		sounds good, thanks guys. great system 👍
@NatiSchnati74 @RubinReport @mmfa Richard Spencer is not on the left at all. Don't push your bad actors on us just because you believe left = bad.
@gatewaypundit She's such an attention-seeking narcissist. She's adept at seizing every possible opportunity to shoehorn herself into the conversation and make herself seem persecuted.
@RubinReport Horseshoe theory is widely discredited.
eyyy account got unlocked
