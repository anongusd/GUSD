@Educ8tusAll If Kavanaugh assaulted Ms. Ford then I don’t want him on the bench. If Franco assaulted women then I wouldn’t care to support his art. The standard should be not assaulting women.  Doesn’t matter where it is.  But there does need to be proof.
@tornadoredcabby Surely the Supreme Court is more important. It’s the logic that makes no sense.  Someone accuses a judge of an assault 30 years ago and has no proof.  This is the 6th woman to complain about Franco with dates, times, etc. in some cases with social media posts but it’s ok because?
@Educ8tusAll I agree case by case. This is the 6th woman to accuse James Franco of sexual assault/exploitation including an underage girl. There are names, dates,locations much more then w/Kavanaugh. It’s hypocritical to say he should stay on the show while Kava stays off the bench.

@tlecaque @subareader Let’s just say we disagree a bit?  Have a good night.
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud Agreed.  But I️ think the thing that started this whole thing was that the ambassador’s comments were foolish.  My grandfather was @ Pearl Harbor on 12/7/41 and insinuating that we caused WW2 was tacky.  Oil embargo was a direct cause but wasn’t a mistake.
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud The Zimmerman cable was the very thing Wilson was looking for to enter the war on idealistic grounds.  While originally he sought to keep us out of the war and ran on that very issue, by his second term he was looking for an excuse to go it and that provided it.  Much like FDR
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud And don’t kid yourself about the shipping. We didn’t go so war after the Lusitania or other ships were sunk. We went in after the Germans were caught trying to encourage Mexico to start a conflict with the US in exchange for Germany supporting their cause over US supplying allies
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud 1/2 So that devolved quickly.  Thanks for stooping to name calling.  You’re a professor? How wonderful.  Your students must be so proud.   I’m aware of Wilson’s darker side but Thanks.  Not really relevant to his foreign policy.
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud You mean the oil embargo put in place because Japan was raping China and the Far East?   Not a mistake, sound foreign policy.    Perhaps Wilson had high expectations, we tend to have them on this side of the Atlantic.  Not a bad thing. Sorry Europe didn’t live up to them
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud And btw your “late to the game” comments show your ignorance of events.  We had no real stake in WWI.  We became engaged to fight for ideals not territory or land.
@tlecaque @subareader @GerardAraud The point is that the actions of the US did little to bring about WW2 unlike the European powers who sought vengeance Post WWI.  The US worked hard Post WWI to seek a treaty which would bring a lasting peace (Wilson’s 14 pts). Your late to the game some time shows your ignorance.
@GerardAraud Let’s not forget that it was the US who in 1919 pushed for a fair treaty with the Central Powers, quite the opposite of France.  The treaty which ended WWI in fact led to the rise of fascism in Germany in the 20’s and 30’s. How’s that for a fact?
