@stabmarine A remand usually means there wasn't enough evidence to overturn the lower decision.
@stabmarine It's averaging 124 days, so no, it's not "just as bad." Not even close. The very oldest appeals were invited to opt into new system in Dec 2017. Then Jan 2018. And from April 2018 to last week, every pending appeal was allowed to move over. Some did. Some didn't.
@PoliticalBeth Hi Beth, all claims not marked "total &amp; permanent" can and will be re-evaluated. The original claim decision letter will note an RFE: routine future examination. If his condition has stayed, or worsened, he can submit evidence to refute the proposal.
@eagleone200 No. That's not it at all. It is only closed to new appeals. Those remaining are still being worked under the laws governing that process. We even hired more judges and attorneys last year to help.
@stabmarine @DAVHQ @DeptVetAffairs @JimMarszalek We sent millions of emails and hundreds of thousands of letters alerting appellants in the old process that they could opt into the new process. Some did. Some did not.

@eagleone200 Appellants who did not opt into the new process will remain in the old process. Their appeals will be processed under those old rules. When we say old process is closed, we mean no brand new appeals will go into that process. Nothing is getting tossed out. Still being worked...
@eagleone200 2/2 Additionally, BVA hired more judges and attorneys last year, and processed more appeals last year than ever before. They're continuing to process those appeals under the old and now-closed process. As of last week, all new appeals go into new process.
@eagleone200 Those who wished to remain in the old process remain under the old laws governing that process. We've sent millions of letters and emails over the past 15.5 months encouraging them to opt into new system. Some did. Some did not. No appeals are "wiped out." 1/2

@eagleone200 That "legacy" system will be closing to new appeals. That process is governed by laws that were written 80+ years ago. It's no wonder it doesn't work well in today's modern world.
@eagleone200 On Twitter, some Vets have tweeted us reporting as quick as three weeks, and as much as 200 days. But remember, the third BVA lane in the new process has a goal of 365 days; the other two lanes have a goal of 125 days.
@eagleone200 A remand isn't a decision. In fact, it usually means that BVA couldn't overturn the lower decision, and is sent back down to the RO for more development. Opting into RAMP by the end of today will allow you to work with VA, and get a decision quicker.
@eagleone200 Correct. Opting into RAMP by the end of today puts you into the new process that is currently averaging 124 days. If you don't opt into the new process today, you will remain in the old process.
@eagleone200 We've been very upfront that the legacy process is broken, and that it averages 3-7 years. We've sent dozens of emails, social media messages, and multiple USPS mail to eligible appellants to inform them of the chance to opt into the modernized system. The choice is theirs.
@eagleone200 There is no distinction or prioritization of service era. The new process is for anyone who disagrees with the decision VA makes on their compensation claim.
@eagleone200 RAMP, as a name, is going away. The process behind the name is becoming the new standard. Next week, no new appeals will go into the legacy process.
@michaelcapik Usually 7-10 days. VA will send you a letter via USPS.

@RobertD49184418 Has nothing to do with anyone taking their time. There's 300,000 in the queue, and the laws in that process are 80+ years old. It's a broken process. What're you to do? Opt into RAMP before tomorrow, if eligible.
@pete0726 The hospitals and clinics have nothing to do with VBA's compensation claim and appeal process. If you need assistance, please let us know, or work with a VSO who can help you.
Currently, decisions in the legacy process are averaging three to seven years, and a goal of 125 days in the new process.
A Veteran whose appeal is currently in the legacy process is encouraged to opt in to RAMP before Feb. 15 to take full advantage of the benefits of the new process.

@KentEiler VA can't force Veterans to take its benefits. Others, still, aren't aware of what's available, or what they're entitled to. It's why we have mandate for outreach--to inform, to assist, to bring in.
The Cheyenne regional office has now also closed, due to inclement weather; St. Paul regional office will be closing early, at 1130am CST. (2/7/19)

@Kaitro16 So, if your husband disagrees with the proposed lowering, the first thing he needs to do is disagree with the decision and submit evidence from doctor showing that it has stayed the same, or worsened.
@Kaitro16 Yes, the traditional "legacy" appeals process is extremely slow (3-7 years average), but it will also be replaced this month by new system that debuted in December 2017 via Appeals Modernization Act: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS These cases are averaging 124 days.
@Kaitro16 If his rating is dropped, he has two options: he can file a new claim for an increase, and he would need evidence from his doctor showing condition is same, or worsened. Secondly, he could appeal the lowering. Two options here....
@Kaitro16 This means that, generally speaking, most injuries heal. VA is required by law to verify status, usually after a few years. However, if your husband's condition has not improved, but has, in fact, worsened, then he should file evidence from his doctor showing how it has worsened.
@Kaitro16 Lots here to package. Multiple tweets coming... 1. VA healthcare questions can be addressed by our friends at @VeteransHealth. 2. All compensation ratings not marked "total &amp; permanent" can be re-evaluated by VA. His original claim decision letter should have "RFE" date on it.

In fact, yearly correspondence spelled out what--and for whom--was included in monthly payment. As we mentioned last week, + seen in this composite image, according to federal law, if you're being paid for dependents, VA needs to know if there is a change in dependent status.

@patrick0994 We do not have access to records, cannot intervene. Best we can do is provide information, explain the process and its benefits. The process is based on federal law, and we administer benefits based on what those laws say.
@ErikaHicks1921 That's the best way, actually.
@patrick0994 Your current place in the legacy line will take longer than opting into RAMP. There is literally no benefit. VA will make the same decision in RAMP in a few weeks as it would in years in the legacy process.
@JeremyH10588071 The answer comes in the mail when the claim is complete. There is no answer before then. The status tracker tool just shows you the steps along the way.

@JeremyH10588071 Yes, the status updates change frequently. They often go forward and backward. This is normal, and not a cause for concern.
@JeremyH10588071 That is a normal part of the process. The RO always requests federal records after submission.
@JeremyH10588071 We complete about 100,000 claims per month, and over 1.4 million last year. We receive daily reports, and publish the info every Monday since 2004, here: https://t.co/XG7adIBABv
@JeremyH10588071 You can file a claim online in eBenefits, with a VSO, or by fax. You can mail a paper claim, but then it gets routed to a scanning facility, then uploaded into VBMS.
@JeremyH10588071 The information the call centers have is taken directly from the same information posted online in eBenefits.
@JeremyH10588071 You can check the status of your claim online in eBenefits.
@JeremyH10588071 All claims submitted online are FDC. But if you submit evidence after filing the claim, it will get knocked out of the FDC process.

@JeremyH10588071 One of the first things we do in the process is obtaining federal records from partners at DoD/Archives. This can take months, depending on how quickly they return our requests.
@JeremyH10588071 By definition, an average means that many are below and above the average. If VA needs something from you, it will send you a request via USPS mail.

@RickyLy71988740 It's not a guarantee, it's a guaranty. VA backs the loan, so that the lender is protected against loss if the Vet or a later owner fail to repay the loan.

@VeteransHealth @JeremyH10588071 Hi Jeremy, are you referring to a GI Bill claim, a pension claim, a DIC claim, a disability compensation claim, or an appeal to any of these?
@1sloSS It cannot automate step-children, college-aged children, dependent parents, previously married spouses. Still, do NOT upload any documents on a dependent claim. If VA needs birth or divorce or marriage cert, it will request from you via mail.
@1sloSS I'm encouraging you to do it this way. The automated system is called "Rules-Based Processing System." More than 60 percent of those who apply this way get their dependents added within hours to a couple days.
@1sloSS When you add a dependent online in eBenefits, do NOT add any supporting documents. This kicks the application out of the automation process and forces VA to manually check it. If it's still pending, you can do this right now--just DON'T delete the pending one.
@Tooterbelle It's a surprisingly common issue that employees at our regional offices see every day. And on social media, we encounter people who say, "But I didn't know," or "no one told me." It's actually in the decision letters, but we're being proactive about getting the info out there.
While there are life situations when calling VA isn't your first train of thought, allowing several years to lapse will result in a costly overpayment. 		You can add and remove dependents online in eBenefits. https://t.co/Io5gkoSVW4
Despite the fact that VA mails automated letters to verify Vets' dependents every eight years, and also that a Veteran has to apply to add a dependent to her award, some Veterans are caught by surprise when they fail to notify VA of a change in their dependent status.

@SickGulfWarVet Your decision will have come with instructions on what to do if you disagree with the determination. You can submit evidence from doctor suggesting that condition has gotten worse, not better. A VSO can also assist you with this.

This Veteran lost five years of additional payments for a dependent. https://t.co/VV3e0yOX7H
For VA compensation purposes, the proper way to add or remove a dependent is via eBenefits, submitting a 21-686c to VA, or by calling VA at 800-827-1000.
In this photo, we see a common misunderstanding: DEERS is not VA. Updating your dependents in DEERS is not the same as updating them with VA. https://t.co/bB5pOKLo61
It is the Veteran's responsibility to add a dependent or update a dependent status change (divorce, remarry, child is attending college, death, etc) with VA.

For Gulf War Veterans, these presumptive diseases include: medically unexplained illnesses ("Gulf War Syndrome"), certain infectious diseases, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosed in all Vets who had 90 days or more continuous active military service
Certain illnesses and diseases are "presumed" by VA to be related to your military service in designated areas of Southwest Asia, and these may entitle you to VA disability compensation benefits.
VA benefits include disability compensation, pension, education and training, health care, home loans, insurance, vocational rehabilitation and employment, and burial.

@mamanikkig @Codeforezap Hi, RAMP has been a tremendous success--especially considering the alternative that it replaces is averaging 3-7 years. Every claim is different, but the wait depends on how many medical conditions claimed, evidence submitted, and RO workload, among many others.
@kaeseme Yo, @shopmyexchange, are you who can answer this question?
@Codeforezap To opt in. You said, "as soon as I received the notice." 		The notice to opt into RAMP explains the two lanes, as does the link at the very top of this thread.
@hwil8115 You can call 800-827-1000, but it has little more than what's available on eBenefits. It's still averaging about 115 days--compared to the 3-7 years in the old, legacy process.

@NotoriousPUMP Though the nat'l avg is around 100 days, that yours isn't complete doesn't mean that it hasn't been worked, or that yours is ignored. Your own screenshots show that much has already been worked, as some recently. But those claims with 8+ medical conditions may need more time.

@saigonpaul You need A/B/C evidence to be granted under old appeals process; you still need the exact same A/B/C with RAMP--the rating criteria hasn't changed. But the new RAMP law made getting there quicker, more efficient.
@saigonpaul No, it's a direct transfer (opting into RAMP closes the appeal, but that's a formality. Everything is preserved in RAMP--incl. backpay). And, with one lane, you can review that evidence with VA. The other lane allows you to introduce more evidence that VA doesn't have.

@saigonpaul That, too, is also not true. In fact, it's conceivable that you'd even move up as more people in front of you opt out of legacy + into RAMP. You'd continue to move up as we're processing more legacy appeals than ever before--thanks to hiring more attorneys and more judges.
@eagleone200 Patrick, remand usually means that BVA couldn't determine a decision, so they send it back to RO for more development. Yes, under the legacy process, you can appeal your appealed appeal's appeal indefinitely. With RAMP, you can supply new evidence and receive a decision quickly.
@saigonpaul Hi again, Paul. The "legacy" appeals process is going away. Since we're not politicians, we don't write laws, and can't change laws, we can't change that old system. But in late 2017, Congress and POTUS signed a new law creating RAMP: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS

@saigonpaul @DeptVetAffairs @VeteransHealth @realDonaldTrump NODs are a part of the old system. They're not streamlined. They lead to legacy appeals system. The legacy appeals system is inefficient, and we've previously called it broken.
@saigonpaul Hi Paul, we don't really have many "old claims." A majority of pending inventory is newer than 125 days. That kind of goes for NODs, too, since you can only file a NOD if you recently rec'd a claim decision that you disagree with. Furthermore, all of these are worked digitally.
@saigonpaul @DeptVetAffairs @VeteransHealth @VAResearch Hi Paul, once again: anyone "stuck in the OLD antiquated... system" can immediately opt into RAMP. More info, here: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@saigonpaul No, actually, it means that a NOD in the legacy system will continue to be processed under that system's antiquated laws and timelines while disagreements in RAMP will be processed under modern, streamlined laws/timelines.

@NotoriousPUMP So, thus, the C&amp;P exams don't simply validate injuries/med conditions, but rather when and how the present injuries/med conditions were caused. Is it related to service? GENERALLY speaking, after exams, a decision is close.
@NotoriousPUMP ... 3. Nexus letter from doctor linking the former to the latter. 		This is the normal process. It differs slightly for you since you filed a BDD prior to leaving service, and it differs slightly for those filing claims for presumptive conditions.
@NotoriousPUMP So, what's needed to be granted? 1. Current medical diagnosis, 2. Evidence in military records of event/injury/medical condition (sick call, profile, TMC paper, hospital records, SIGACT, AAR, awards summaries, medals, witness statements, photos...), and...
@NotoriousPUMP ...were incurred or aggravated by active military service and also those which affect the Vet's post-service wages/quality of life. The process doesn't "validate injuries" but rather that the injuries/medical conditions claimed were caused/aggravated by serving. More...
@NotoriousPUMP But this is good time to describe what's legally needed. Yes, one can present injury/medical condition and ask for compensation, but that's not the point of compensation. VA doesn't pay for injuries/medical conditions; it compensations Vets for injuries/medical conditions that...
@NotoriousPUMP C&amp;P exams are only ordered if the rating team needs medical clarification or other information. Usually, it's a medical opinion in place of a "nexus." Not all claimants require exams, however.
@NotoriousPUMP We, the VBA, own disability compensation, along with home loan, life insurance, GI Bill, VR&amp;E, and dozens more. It's not another "division." Under the VA umbrella, we are one of three administrations, the other two being @VeteransHealth and @VANatCemeteries.
@NotoriousPUMP Hi again Ronald. Your picture shows that VA has been developing and working on your claim since at least June. Generally speaking, exams aren't ordered until close to the end of the process. If no one had even looked at your claim, you wouldn't have been sent to exams.
@moeflip @saigonpaul Good morning, Maureen. 125 days is a program goal. As we continue to process claims and RAMP cases in under that timeframe, it means that Veterans are not "subjected to years of wait."
@saigonpaul Claims are averaging about 100 days. NOD/Appeal are averaging 3-7 years. Ramp, in place of NOD/appeal, is averaging 115 days. The NOD/appeal option will be formally replaced by RAMP in February 2019. Appellants already in can stay in, but new disagreements then will go into RAMP.
@saigonpaul Now I see the confusion. You're combining multiple different processes, which have different laws, into one. There is a claim for compensation. If you disagree w/decision, you have two other processes to use to formally disagree: NOD/appeal, and RAMP. All three are different.
@NotoriousPUMP This photo does, in fact, show that VA has continued to develop + work on your claim. Among dozens of factors that determine how long one waits for decision, the biggest indicator is no. of medical conditions. You can learn more about BDD claims, here: https://t.co/skvB6ihMmK
@NotoriousPUMP Good morning, Ronald. While FDC avg about 100 days--and even fewer for BDD claims--certain "complex" claims w/more than 8 medical condition can take longer. The dates listed in eBenefits are estimations, and they move fwd/back often.
@saigonpaul While we processed more than 1.3 million claims in FY '18, and more than 50,000 RAMP cases, we also completed more pending legacy appeals than ever. We publish that data every Monday since 2004, here: https://t.co/XG7adITc05
@saigonpaul We process about 100,000 compensation claims per month. As for RAMP, it does the exact opposite of what you imply. While the legacy appeals process averages 3-7 years, RAMP can provide the same decision in under 125 days.
@saigonpaul You're lumping claims + NODs into same process. They're not the same. And, VA cannot automatically move anyone into RAMP; however, come February '19, all new "appeals" will be in RAMP. There is no incentive to be purposely slow--we receive more than million new claims each year.
@fbi1930 @StyxCT You lose no rights by opting into RAMP. If you'd like to submit new or additional evidence, you should select the supplemental lane; if you have no new evidence and would like to speak with VA, the HLR is the correct lane.
@fbi1930 What does the decision say?
@saigonpaul RAMP is the new way to "appeal," or disagree, with a VA compensation claim decision. There are three lanes. If you don't like the second decision, move it to another lane. If you don't like the third decision, move it into the BVA lane.
@saigonpaul Sure thing. We publish that info every Monday: https://t.co/XG7adITc05		Claims are averaging about 100 days. NODs? That process is old and broken. The new RAMP is averaging about 115 days.
@NotoriousPUMP Most claims are averaging under 100 days; pre-discharge is actually quicker than FDC; unfortunately, claims w/more than eight medical conditions are considered complex, and will take longer to process. Also, submitting add'l evidence after claim submission restarts claim.
@NotoriousPUMP How many medical conditions were on your claim? Did you use a VSO? Was it a pre-discharge claim, or an FDC? Was it filed online, or mailed? Which RO is working it?
@NotoriousPUMP The social media team doesn't have access to records. But if the rating team at your RO has your exam results, then they will continue to develop and process your claim.
The newest updates to the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) includes hematologic and lymphatic system, which addresses conditions related to the blood: https://t.co/dEgKjmBmC0
@NotoriousPUMP So, the examiner DID send the exam results that VA requested? Did the examiner tell you why they waited so long?
@NotoriousPUMP Your C&amp;P examiner didn't send the exam results to your RO? Why?
@NotoriousPUMP The C&amp;P examiner is not going to send you the results, they submit the results of your exam to the rating team at the regional office who ordered the exam.
@NotoriousPUMP When you submit additional evidence after submitting a Fully-Developed Claim, it gets knocked out of the FDC process. "Fully Developed" means submitting all of your evidence with the claim, not later. It effectively starts over each time you submit something new.
@NotoriousPUMP Have you submitted additional evidence to VA after you initially submitted the claim?

@CSeligmanIII 1-888-442-4551 is the GI Bill hotline.
@RRalph1951 The housing allowance's intent is that it allows the student to focus on school, not also a full-time job, etc.
@RRalph1951 In addition to tuition, the Post-9/11 and Forever GI Bill pay a monthly housing allowance that people often just call BAH, though our rate is based on BAH.
@MBearof4 If you have medical records that VA hasn't seen and hasn't considered, then that isn't a CUE. You should submit all relevant and material records with the claim.
@armyroh4 No one came out to say that VA wasn't going to pay back benefits. The NBC story was wrong. The statement in the tweet at top is in response to that wrong story.
@eagleone200 No, that's not what we're saying. RAMP has no effect on the pending legacy appeals--aside from those who opt into RAMP from legacy means that the legacy line is decreasing.
@eagleone200 Who said we aren't? I mean, we processed more this year than any other year. And with more judges and attorneys, we anticipate processing even more in 2019, too.
@bigskinny369 Generally speaking, "not service connected" means VA couldn't find evidence of an event/injury/medical condition in your military service records.

@OMAR57844531 @JHStY Omar, you may be a god candidate for RAMP: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS
@JHStY 2/2 Don't know if this is what happened to you. Again, we don't have access to records. And we're not asking for PII. But claim decision letter explains the legal reasoning for why VA made the decision(s) it made, and w/o that, we can't help determine/explain.
@JHStY Sometimes VA makes a decision based on the evidence submitted. For example--20%. Then, on appeal, a Vet submits additional evidence. Percentage increased. This doesn't mean the first decision was wrong, just that it was based only on what was given. More... 1/2
@JHStY You said you were denied for 39 years, then you were granted but "fighting" for 100. Now, you say you've been at 100 for 28 years, but that you met w/law judge six years ago? Why? What were the laws + reasons stated on the decision letters? We DON'T have access to records.
@JHStY So, what did the claim or appeal decision letter state was the reason why you were denied? Each decision letter gives the legal reasoning and codes based for why VA made the decision it made.
@JHStY "Old evidence" only matters when appealing a claim (denial or grant) or applying for an increase to a SC condition. You would need to show "relevant &amp; material" evidence that VA doesn't already have.
@JHStY Actually, we don't. I'm trying to understand how we can help. First you said you were denied for 39 years, then you said you were granted, but that you've been trying to increase your rating to 100 percent. Your claim decision letter(s) will help us to determine why.
@James_Thieman Hi. We administer VA's non-health benefits, like home loan, life insurance, GI Bill, and more. If you have questions about VA healthcare, @VeteransHealth can assist you.
@JHStY So, you weren't denied for 39 years, you just disagreed with the rating VA gave you? What did the claim decision letter(s) state was the reason why you weren't rated higher?
@JHStY Hi. You have 39 years of denials? What do all those claim decision letter state is the reason for those denials?

VA regulations govern which organizations can help Veterans + survivors w/ benefit claims. This used to be limited to federal/state/local organizations. But in March 2017, Tribal orgs were allowed to help Native American Vets + survivors in their communities with claims.

What is a NADL? VA provides direct home loans to eligible Native American Veterans to finance the purchase, construction, or improvement of homes on Federal Trust Land, or to refinance a prior NADL to reduce the interest rate. https://t.co/SUUFYSvGiH
The Native American Veteran Direct Loan (NADL) program provides eligible Native American Veterans and their spouses the opportunity to use their VA home loan guaranty benefit on Federal trust land: https://t.co/wfG8I9IEEK
@derek_maak The averages I gave refer to a claim decision. You're referring to legacy appeals process, which is old way of formally disagreeing w/VA's decision. That process averages 3-7 years. The new RAMP process, which will replace old legacy process, is averaging about 115 days.
@TrumpFa40086759 Are you referring to DAV, the Disabled American Veterans? They are not VA/VBA/VHA. DAV is a Veterans Service Organization.
@AlPinner1 @derek_maak Al, we administer dozens of VA non-health benefits. Some are instant, others a couple weeks. You can track our progress on just one benefit--disability compensation--for every week back to 2004, here: https://t.co/XG7adITc05
@TrumpFa40086759 DVA = The Department of Veterans Affairs (@DeptVetAffairs). Your DVA is made up of three distinct administrations: us, @VeteransHealth, and @VANatCemeteries. We are all DVA. @VALongBeach falls under VHA.
@SlagerKyle Hi Kyle. Did you have a question or need assistance with something?
@Jrodallred27 @PopMech Same. I was a fister. Have you used your education benefits? ^jd
@derek_maak The FDC is averaging about 100 days to complete. The DRC is averaging just over three weeks.
@pete0726 You know that denying claims just because doesn't clear a backlog, but that it would increase it? If you would like to see the number of Vets receiving compensation + how much we pay them, check the yearly archive of our ABR: https://t.co/jz4gUbnwxT

@Cic3r01 This was addressed last week, and we continue to work finishing those remaining. But, MHA, which is a living stipend, isn't related to enrollment. More details here: https://t.co/JhRIVaeESH
@CSM79RV7 The legacy appeals process is like a horse-drawn carriage. It doesn't work in today's society. RAMP is the modern automobile for today's transportation needs. The legacy process will slowly go away.
@CSM79RV7 Its function are built into the new https://t.co/1n5ntY7uJK
@TrueElijahAsher @Cloudy361 First, "disability compensation" is one of the dozens of benefits we administer. Second, upon exiting the military, there are many benefits one can claim that do not affect severance pay. Lastly, repaying severance when claiming comp is federal law. Prevents "double dipping."
@eguidry604 The social media team doesn't have access to records.
@SophieYu721 It doesn't work like that. We don't create lines and then serve only one group first. New claims get routed to the first available regardless of age.

@pete0726 You know that denying all the claims doesn't mean they go away? Or that it would make things worse, create longer lines? The allegation simply isn't true. We paid $84 Billion in compensation money to millions of Vets in FY18, up from $80B in FY17, up from $64B in FY16.

@eagleone200 2/2 In that theoretical scenario, that would be three decisions in RAMP before even one decision in the legacy process.
@eagleone200 In RAMP, there are three lanes. The goal for each is 125 days. You could get decision in first lane, be happy, and that's that. I'm merely saying that, if you weren't happy w/decision in first lane, or second lane, you could then go to third lane. 1/2

@Soldier4life00 Not sure what you're referring to. Did you have a benefits question we can address?
@eagleone200 We never stopped. First, new legislation late last year finally allowed us to create a modern appeals system, called RAMP. Secondly, we've continued to hired more judges and attorneys at BVA, and FY18 saw BVA process more than its yearly goal.
@CurtisParish Or, maybe there's not enough info, or that it's pending an exam upload, file upload, or some other piece of the puzzle. Has nothing to do with "deciding to push it out" just because.

@KSWildman Once you get appt, bring all your private medical records, and get statements from family and friends who have witnessed your symptoms.

@buckiirons @VeteransHealth Not sure what you're referring to. Did you have a question about your care?
VA continues to take steps to fully operate digitally and to modernize the way it processes compensation and pension claims ‚Äì moving from a paper-heavy process to an efficient, electronic process ‚Äì resulting in a faster, more accurate, and transparent claims process.
Less than 16 months after the start of File Bank Extraction, VA removed more than 1.7 million paper claims files from its regional offices.
In 2013, VA began removing paper records from its regional offices and, in 2016, the agency launched the File Bank Extraction initiative to reduce claims processing time by establishing more electronic records. https://t.co/bWfHCFFoUa

@eguidry604 We're completing several hundred per day. Have completed about 50,000 and paid almost a $100 million in retro pay since January. I know it's not comforting to hear, but yes.
@eguidry604 The "legacy" appeals process is averaging 3-7 YEARS. RAMP is averaging a couple months, sometimes just a few weeks. That's not just quick by comparison, that IS quick.
@aaron_magro Sorry Aaron. I'm sure you know this, but it doesn't mean the doctor isn't doing their job, but that, along with everything else a doctor does (treating Vets), the workload hasn't yet allowed it.  :/		@vacareers is still hiring tens of thousands for @VeteransHealth.
@eguidry604 An average is simply the middle number of a given range. It means that some are done quicker, and some are completed longer. The middle range isn't a given. The goal remains 125.
@eguidry604 Doesn't work like that. No claim or appeal is ever the same, and no exact promise of completion-by-date can be accurately given. That's why there's estimation. Wait factors include workload on station, along w/how many conditions on your RAMP, and which evidence you've included.
@aaron_magro Procedurally speaking, the date will be extended.

Want to read some success stories from Vets who used Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E)? https://t.co/YFdNRV8ojg
@JBiladeau The old system was averaging 3-7 years. It makes perfect sense to replace the broken with something new, efficient, and modern, with new laws.
@JBiladeau Unchanged.
@JBiladeau Why new system? Because "legacy" was broken and burdened by bureaucratic laws. VA doesn't write federal law, your lawmakers do. They created new law, POTUS signed it summer '17, allowing us to modernize new process: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS		Soon, RAMP will replace "legacy."
@JBiladeau This is false. You do NOT lose right to appeal higher. In fact, if you don't like RAMP decision in lane 1, you can appeal to lane 2. If you don't like that decision, you can appeal it to lane 3 at the BVA. All three of those decisions will come quicker than waiting in "legacy."
@JBiladeau You just said you submitted a NOD after your claim was denied. Sending a NOD is not a claim--it's the beginning of an appeal (of your completed claim) in the legacy process. Again, you may be eligible for a quicker decision, in RAMP: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@JBiladeau This, also, is not true. They give up no rights, and retain every option they had previously in the legacy process.
@JBiladeau If you'd like a quicker decision on your appeal, RAMP may be for you. Here's how: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@JBiladeau If your claim was decided, then it was processed. You disagreed with that decision, sent in a NOD, formally disagreeing with it. Which means you no longer have a claim, but an active appeal of the claim decision.
@JBiladeau VA uses C&amp;P exams for additional medical opinion, especially when no nexus evidence is present with claim evidence, or to clarify a nexus when more information is needed. Again, if you're in the "legacy" appeals process, the FDC claims timelines doesn't apply to your appeal.
@JBiladeau Those opting into RAMP from the legacy appeals process are averaging 112 days, with a stated goal of 125 days. More info on how and why, here: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@JBiladeau We don't have any claims that old. Are you referring to an appeal of an already completed claim? Under "legacy" appeals process, those are averaging 3-7 years. And yes, it's unacceptable. Which is why new legislation allowed us to create new RAMP process: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS

@Dylan21430106 It's currently averaging 112. Length of time depends on workload, place in line, evidence, and number of issues on the RAMP claim. This determines why some take a few weeks and others a bit more than 125--though 125 is the goal for all.

@mummytotwoboys1 @mamanikkig Nothing simple about appeals. Complex, legal process. The legacy appeals process is averaging 3-7 years. With RAMP, the September average was around 100 days. 125 days is the goal.

@Aerve3 @Cloudy361 That was February, and for RAMP. The current average (in September) was about 100 days.
@GallopingAngels DRC is averaging under 30 days; FDC is averaging about 100 days; RAMP's goal is 125, and my last update in September said it was around 100 days.

@TrueElijahAsher @Tyrianpimp From the DRC page: "Accredited VSOs are fully trained on the DRC Program." https://t.co/P2qxQy9tRx
@TrueElijahAsher @StyxCT It's right there, on our website, in bright red, at bottom of the fact sheet: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@TrueElijahAsher @Tyrianpimp ONLY a VSO can submit a Decision-Ready Claim. More info, here: https://t.co/P2qxQy9tRx
@TrueElijahAsher @Tyrianpimp BVA doesn't process claims. They process appeals of already completed claims. That process is old and inefficient. It's why new legislation in 2017 allowed us to create RAMP: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS

@freeman1224 You can talk to representatives in person. When you get there, ask for the "Public Contact": https://t.co/Uikl9Y1k89
@TrueElijahAsher @Tyrianpimp That is an option if the Vet chooses it, but it's usually slower and costlier.
@TrueElijahAsher @Tyrianpimp Certified VSOs have access to VBMS, and many of them are specifically trained by VA. The CFR is in digital format.
@TrueElijahAsher @StyxCT The question is wrong. The answer is No. If you don't agree with or like the decision on a RAMP claim, then yes, you can move it into the other RAMP lane for another review. If you disagree with that third decision, then you can move it into the BVA lane.
@arrogantivy If you or someone else has pictures, letters, prescriptions, awards, or anything else you can think of to corroborate the event, that will also help. 2/2
@arrogantivy Kaleb, we're Vets, too. We've been there. But VA doesn't write federal law, we administer benefits based on the laws your elected reps write. The evidence requirements are law. In this case, you should get commander/buddy/witness statements to back up your injury claim. 1/2

@patriotmckenzie Just another former Army sergeant, artillery (13F). #airassault
@patriotmckenzie C&amp;P is an exam to form a medical opinion, and does not lead to a DBQ. But sometimes a DBQ works in lieu of a C&amp;P. Not every claimant will receive a C&amp;P. A C&amp;P can be ordered by rater if more info or clarification is needed. Your doctor can provide a nexus, or a DBQ.
@patriotmckenzie VA health records only aren't enough. See my last reply--you need current diagnosis, evidence in your service records, and then a nexus. A VBA DBQ can often suffice for nexus: https://t.co/JLdxZ9lajU
@patriotmckenzie You need three things to be granted disability compensation: a current medical diagnosis (VA or civilian), evidence of an injury/event/medical condition IN your military service records, and a nexus from a doctor linking former to latter.
@VeteransHealth @Araujo_Rich There has been a COLA increase for 13 of the past 15 years, which is determined by SSA. Aside from COLA, the benefit rates are controlled by Congress. For the most part, the compensation rates are a supplement to, not a substitution for, post-service civilian wages.
@patriotmckenzie It's a lot like how DoD has separate branches. You wouldn't join the army to serve on a submarine. If you have questions about VA healthcare, you want @VeteransHealth. If you're asking about GI Bill, home loan, life insurance, compensation, etc., then that's us.
@patriotmckenzie There are three sub-administrations in VA. When you say "going to the VA," it sounds like you're referring to a @VeteransHealth Medical Center. VHA administers VA healthcare, @VANatCemeteries is mortuary affairs, and we--the VBA--administer non-health benefits.
@patriotmckenzie NOD is part of the legacy process. More RAMP info, here: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd
@arrogantivy If your medic or PA documented it in your STRs, then yes. Did you get a Purple Heart, or have an awards summary noting the blast/event/injury? Can you battle buddies write a witness statement for you? Do you have a current medical diagnosis?
@patriotmckenzie You're confusing the legacy appeals process with RAMP. The latter isn't even a year old yet, and it has, in its 10 months, processed tens of thousands and paid out more than $50 million in retro payments.

@mendeziglesias1 I'm not sure what you're asking. Not all claimants or appellants require a C&amp;P for a decision.
@quilts4veterans @DeptVetAffairs Our friends at @VeteransHealth are who administer VA healthcare. They are who can address this question.
@RichRichcharley C&amp;P examiners (contractors) do not decide claims or appeals, they merely provide professional opinion of whether your injury/medical condition was caused by your service.

@wtchdg231 This is Twitter. We cannot take your personal information here, nor can we look into records. IRIS is the only secure way to message VA. Yes, it will be directed to the appropriate department that can directly help you.
@unsunghero4life VA is paying close to $100 billion a year in compensation to millions of Vets who have met this evidence criteria. If you need assistance, a certified VSO is trained to help. A Doctor need only give professional opinion based on assessment whether current diagnosis caused by svc.
@Soldier4life00 @VeteransHealth Dwayne, did you have a question for VHA, or for us?
@Tyrianpimp You should seek assistance from a certified VSO. You're going to need a current medical diagnosis, evidence in your military records, and then a nexus from a doctor saying that your current hearing issues were caused by military and not something else.

3/3 if you claim an injury or medical condition that occurred/happened to you during active service, then you need to give VA evidence of the injury or medical condition that occurred/happened during the time you were in active service, hence the term "service" connected.
2/3 if you want to claim an injury or medical condition, it must have happened to you during the time you were active (including Reserves/Guard activated, Reserves/Guard drill and/or annual training);

@ceadodson MHA is based on DoD's BAH rates. It's federal law, no different than when in the military. You got paid in arrears, for the work you completed the previous month.

@aaron_magro Are you still serving (reserves)? If so, are you aware of the reserves-pay offset with VA compensation?
@aaron_magro It would be a CUE if VA made a mistake based on what evidence VA had. Also, a claim decision is final once 365 days have passed from decision date.
@krisforaz6 Page two of link in previous reply has the opt-in instructions.
@krisforaz6 The appeals process is not quick. And there's a long line. RAMP is the new, modern process averaging under 125 days. It has two lanes, including one that allows for you to submit new evidence: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd		VBA can schedule a C&amp;P exam in both lanes.
@krisforaz6 So, you were scheduled for an exam? The decision on your claim is not final until after 365 days. If you disagree with the decision, you can send in the NOD, or opt into the RAMP program for another review. Both options would likely lead to another C&amp;P, if needed.
@krisforaz6 If the rating team needs a C&amp;P exam for your claim, they will schedule it for you.
@krisforaz6 We are VBA, VA's Benefits Administration. The @DeptVetAffairs is made up of three administrations: us, @VeteransHealth (VHA), and @VANatCemeteries (NCA). 		The (VBA, compensation) rating team will schedule a C&amp;P exam for you if it is needed. Not every claimant needs one.
@krisforaz6 If you're seeking treatment, you need to contact @VeteransHealth, who can put you in touch with your local VAMC. If you mean a VBA C&amp;P exam for a disability compensation claim, VBA will request one if it needs one.
@aaron_magro DoD doesn't send records/STRs unless VA requests them. VA won't request them unless you submit a claim w/o evidence. If you have your records/STRs, you're supposed to include them w/your claim. A VSO can assist you with this.
@krisforaz6 Who are you trying to get an appointment with?
@aaron_magro The C-file is just a collection of what you have already sent to VA, as well as other VA notes. Your reserve unit has no direct access to VA. If the comp process is too much for you, we recommend getting a VSO to assist you: https://t.co/I8TSFVHxAM
@bellakristela Have you reached out to @VeteransHealth? They are who administer VA healthcare. We, the VBA, administer VA's non-health benefits.
@bigsarge68 Is it an FDC, or in RAMP? They're two different things.
@leviusmcavera @DeptVetAffairs 3-7 years is the old, legacy appeals average. The improvement is RAMP, the new process that will take less than 125 days.
@campupr2000 @DeptVetAffairs RAMP just turned one, not three. Click the link to read more. You may be a great candidate to opt into it and get a quicker decision.
@John___Sheehan You'll need to call GIB for more details: https://t.co/Q5kEQypL0x
@CraigErskine3 RAMP is unrelated to backlog. This link shows backlog at a near historic low.
@TimSWink77 Disability compensation is not taxable income. Is it possible you've had an overpayment, like from dropping a class or a change in your dependent status?
@gavineanthony Social media team doesn't have access to records. Usually when pay is lower, it's because of a debt, like school overpayment or change in dependent status. You can call Debt Management Center, here: https://t.co/E2TJerldio		Or, start at 800-827-1000
@Newoldguard @DeptVetAffairs This is the improvement, and it's more efficient. In time, it will actually replace an older system, and one that isn't efficient.

@Camay71Si The last piece (3/3) is that the doctor must provide a nexus linking current diagnosis to being caused or aggravated by service.
@Camay71Si If you have an injury/medical condition, you can see your @VeteransHealth care practitioner; they can get you a medical diagnosis. As it relates VBA + disability comp, you must have evidence in your mil. records of event/injury/med condition. That's 2/3 of needed evidence.

@TrumpFa40086759 @VeteransHealth Love @VALongBeach! Had great care there when I lived in SoCal. My grandparents (WWII Vets) loved it, too. As for AO, it's a chemical, not a medical condition. Reach out to VHA and LB in these tags for assistance--they're very responsive. ^jd
@CornerInsanity Jerred, a C&amp;P exam isn't treatment. You'll have to reach out to your @VeteransHealth care provider for treatment, if that's what you need.
@stweets17 If you appealed (formally disagreed with) a completed compensation claim, then you can submit an opt-in to RAMP, with info from here: https://t.co/lS1wBW7vGd		This would take you out of the legacy appeals process and into RAMP.
@stweets17 FDC are being completed in an average of about 100 days; DRC in under 30 days; these RAMP are those who opted in from the legacy appeals process. The goal is 125 days.
@ShooterTT Essentially, on RAMP. Where will be announced soon.

Today, more than 40,000 Veterans have opted into the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), and more than $45 million in retroactive benefits have been paid out.
This has transformed the previous archaic, frustrating process into a simple, timely and transparent system that works for Veterans.
For years, Veterans have been asking VA to ‚Äúdo something about appeals.‚Äù It‚Äôs now been a year since The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Appeals Modernization Act) was signed by the President: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS https://t.co/GzPTm5BdJT

3. Streamlined VBA organizational structure with software improvements to place greater emphasis on fiscal stewardship, including using analytics-based oversight to identify potential Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, and reduce improper payments.
2. Established the office of Transition and Economic Development to improve transition outcomes; bring greater focus to programs fostering economic success; help transitioning Servicemembers + older Vets who may need help enhancing or refining their skills.
1. Expanded collaboration with VSOs ‚Äúto discuss new ways we can work together to take care of our Veterans.‚Äù

@Scott32688515 Opting into RAMP does close an appeal. It's just procedural. You don't lose anything, and it remains open in RAMP.
@DebAnnMorris Appeals at the board are averaging 3-7 years to complete, and every time you submit new evidence, it gets moved further back. RAMP takes less than 125 days, and is more flexible on new evidence. You'll receive the same decision, but with different wait.

@NavyGunner0989 Only Veterans + dependents of Vets are eligible for VA benefits. Furthermore, no one can force a Vet to use her benefits. Lastly--just speculation--but they may not need most of what we administer, such as GIB, VR&amp;E, life insurance, pension, etc.

@cajulines It does get better. Late last summer, POTUS and Congress passed new legislation that allowed us to create a new system, called RAMP. Currently, it's averaging 78 days to complete appeals. You have to opt into this system from the old, legacy system.

@WyattTerry7 You can track RAMP in eBenefits.
@allen_adams3 @RogueVBA @Newoldguard @DeptVetAffairs NODs are not claims. If you have a NOD, it means you received a decision on your claim, and that you formally disagreed with it. You thus appealed that decision by filing a NOD. This leads into the old, outdated appeals process (3-7 years avg). Or you can opt into RAMP.

@aaron_magro @VeteransHealth "Requested documents" in your eBenefits folder's tab is unrelated to the FOIA/c-file. This is a request that VBA sends, usually to DoD, VA Medical Center, C&amp;P examiner, etc., for more information in the claim development process.
Did you know that we have a Youtube channel? We have dozens of short and long videos with tons of useful information on a variety of VA benefits: https://t.co/NAgCwSGxmr
@aaron_magro @VeteransHealth A c-file request is literally a FOIA. 		Not sure what you mean "past due." Are you talking about the section in eBenefits where VA lists that it's waiting on documents from others? This is normal.
@aaron_magro A c-file is just a collection of everything you've already given to VBA. @VeteransHealth administers VA healthcare. VBA's VSRs/RVSRs rate compensation claims based on federal law in CFR 38.
@aaron_magro You don't need to request your C-file, to then send back to VA as evidence for part of your claim. It's not needed.
@aaron_magro If you didn't submit your records with your claim, it can take DoD up to two months to find and then submit them to VA. When received, they are re-routed to scanning facility, then uploaded into VBMS to be worked electronically. Always submit ALL of your evidence with claim.

@MacMcCann8 Seriously, though. RAMP letter said ineligible, but not why? Keep us informed what VSO learns.
@MacMcCann8 Appeals at BVA that have been "activated" for a decision are ineligible. Could this be likely for you? https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS
@CarmenDaniels17 @campupr2000 @VA_PTSD_Info You should include a current medical diagnosis with your evidence when submitting a claim. In fact, it's one of the three pieces of evidence needed to be granted.
@TrueElijahAsher Veterans who disagree with their RAMP decision have one year from the date of their notification to file a request for review which can include an appeal with the Board of Veterans‚Äô Appeals: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS
@TrueElijahAsher "Appeal"/disagreement/"review" is semantics. RAMP is for appellants voluntarily opting into new review process. If it helps to think of appeals as disagreements, then that's fine. Both offer a review of the Vet's disagreement with VA's decision.
@TrueElijahAsher RAMP is not part of the BVA. Later this fall, BVA hopes to unveil its own new process. This means there will be multiple lanes to select how you want a claim decision to be re-evaluated.
@TrueElijahAsher This is both correct and incorrect. You're right that they cannot return to the legacy process that will be going away. But you're wrong in saying they are done. If they disagree with a RAMP decision, they can elect a different review lane. And not just once.
@thedorkiestdad @DeptVetAffairs Not if they're not in your service records.   :/
@TrueElijahAsher We ARE "VA itself." When you opt into RAMP, you are withdrawing from the legacy appeals process. You don't lose your retro date. As for staffing, Congress controls the size of your federal workforce. We request more each year; sometimes we get some, sometimes we don't.
@thedorkiestdad @DeptVetAffairs Okay, let's re-think this. Your evidence to support the claim can include pictures, medals, awards summaries, news clippings, prescriptions, hospital records, sick call slips, profiles, and buddy/commander/witness/spouse + lay statements. Can you gather one or more of these?
@thedorkiestdad @DeptVetAffairs No. A 0% is an SC, which means you've done all the hard work. Now, if your medical condition ever worsens, you only need submit new evidence to "file for an increase." This is a common practice.
RT @CaMaSk: @VAVetBenefits @studentvets The #GIBill was very important for the beginning of what is now a 42 year career. I encourage all v‚Ä¶
@thedorkiestdad @DeptVetAffairs "Not service-connected" means VA couldn't find evidence of the injury/event/medical condition in your service records. And if that was the case, you wouldn't have gotten a 0%. A 0% IS a service connection.
@thedorkiestdad @DeptVetAffairs What does the claim decision letter state? 0-percent is a service connection.

@MsConcerned We don't have any claims that old. It sounds like you're referring to an appeal, which is a formal disagreement with a completed claim decision? If so, yes, RAMP is completing disagreement re-evaluations in an average of 60 days.
@campupr2000 @VA_PTSD_Info Their goal is to perform an evaluation and form a medical opinion--where and when VBA needs it. Not all claimants need a C&amp;P exam.
@TrueElijahAsher This, too, is false. A Veteran can technically keep an appeal alive, indefinitely. Over decades, can receive many decisions--including a granting--and keep appealing. With RAMP, a Vet can elect a different review lane if disagree with decision.
@TrueElijahAsher This is false. Please stop spreading misinformation.

@str8smak @Dmobb_ND An appeal in the legacy process can last as long as a Vet wants to continue it. Most appeals that old, and more, have received several decisions, including grants, but they continue to appeal, indefinitely.

@blb3917 @don2569603 @DeptVetAffairs RAMP is for those who disagree with the decision on their completed disability compensation claims. If your claim hasn't been completed, you can't yet disagree with the decision. A C&amp;P examination has nothing to do with it. 1/2

@v_martin639 As the video link and website links I've provided mention, RAMP is the result of new legislation: the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. Your elected representatives wrote and passed this new law creating a new and more efficient process; we implement it.
@v_martin639 I've answered this three times now. RAMP has nothing to do with--and does not have any affect on--claims. RAMP is for those in the legacy appeals process who want a quicker decision on their disagreements. RAMP's completion goal is 125 days; it's currently averaging 60 days.
@SeybertBruce Not sure what you're asking here, but yes, if you owe any debt to VA, the DMC can explain.

@v_martin639 But again, this is the opposite of "delays the process." RAMP exists for those who've waited and don't want to wait any longer.
@v_martin639 Our FB Live last week explains it: https://t.co/u6Y4K1Y2tc		The gist is that the Senate + House passed it, and POTUS signed it into law. "Appeals Modernization" has been a topic for a long time: https://t.co/4OKRTWYYZy
@v_martin639 RAMP is unrelated to, and has no impact on claims. RAMP is an alternative to the legacy appeals process.

@privateer3 You can check claim and appeal status on both eBenefits and https://t.co/kBIRuvFqPf. Appeals at BVA are averaging 3-7 years. Remember, with an average, that necessarily means some will be under, and some will be over, and there's no guarantee that one will be at middle/"average."
@Shea_McCuen RAMP has already processed thousands and awarded over $16 million in backpay. Those numbers are going up everyday. The average wait is about 60 days, and more than half are granted.
@jaye_cortez Most are, but there are situations where effective dates are different, based on diagnoses, evidence, etc. RAMP is for people who are tired of waiting on appeals. The old appeals process is broken, averaging 3-7 years.
@campupr2000 What does the decision letter say is the reasoning for deduction?
@privateer3 Not sure where you're getting your numbers, but appeals at BVA are averaging 3-7 years. There are thousands and thousands similarly in hardship status. RAMP is not part of BVA's legacy process. If you'd like a quicker decision, you may be a good candidate for RAMP.

@sgtrone Backlog refers to those whose claims are 125 days old and who haven't received a decision. A definition of word "appeal" is disagreement. One can't disagree if they haven't had decision, can't appeal if not received decision on claim. "Backlog" refers to claims, not appeals.
@sgtrone Appeals Modernization is the broader topic. Under that, AMO controls the new RAMP. In October, BVA will be unveiling its portion of a modernized appeal process. Together, they will be four different lanes.
@sgtrone AMO and BVA are different. BVA handles appeals, AMO handles RAMP. "Backlog" refers to claims that are older than 125 days, not appeals of already completed claim decisions. Later this year, BVA will have its own modernized appeals process.

@Shea_McCuen Yes, it's a long line, and the process is based on laws that were written 80+ years ago. It's why a new law passed last year allowing us to create a new appeals process, called RAMP, which is averaging 60 days: https://t.co/4d6IRsdOj2
@jaye_cortez Reconsideration can pay back to the date of the claim, but not all claims have an effective date from filing. Since we don't have records access, best thing we can say in your case is to consult your claim decision letter, and to speak with an accredited VSO for guidance.

@MeShellaBella72 @mikesprague824 @waterspryt Nothing is "jeopardized." You don't lose anything by opting into RAMP. It's just a new process, different name, different laws, same rating criteria.
@dakurrupt1 @waterspryt Opting into RAMP withdraws the appeal from the legacy system. You don't lose anything, including effective date.
@mikesprague824 @waterspryt This is false. There is no reset, and it doesn't affect backpay.

@MickeydMark Depends on the dependent situation. If adopted, step, or college-aged, she cannot be automated, will need to be manually verified. Also, do NOT upload any documents for a dependent claim.

@JamesDandy8 What does your claim decision letter say is the reason for denial?
@JamesDandy8 We administer dozens of benefits. Are you talking about the evidence requirements for disability compensation? If so, those are federal law. You MUST have evidence of an injury or medical condition in your service records, as well as current diagnosis and nexus linking them.
@Glenn_C_B RAMP is working fine. Opting into it means that you have withdrawn from the old (slow) appeals process. Now, your disagreement with the decision VA made on your previous claim will be seen by the RO instead of the BVA.
@Glenn_C_B It's just a different name for a different and newer and quicker program. Nothing has been lost. All of your info and dates have been preserved.

@mikesprague824 The people that have been waiting longest were the first to be invited to opt-in. Now, everyone can opt in. But--the rating criteria hasn't changed. You will get same decision in weeks with RAMP as you would in years with current, legacy system.

@PoisonedMarine @DeptVetAffairs The "system" is based on federal law. The evidence requirements are a taxpayer protection.

@msgtnmiller @PoisonedMarine @DeptVetAffairs Do you have records of going to sick call, getting a profile, hospital visits, medications, pictures, accident report, etc. from your active service? If so, these can help corroborate your injury, to establish the connection to your service.

@RogerChrista Program is too new to know or estimate, but perhaps you can share your experience when that time (hopefully soon) comes?
@RogerChrista See previous response a minute ago...  :)
@RogerChrista Sorry took so long for answer. Yes, board reviews will be available in the near future.
@RogerChrista You can find the opt-in form and instructions, here: https://t.co/4OKRTWYYZy		Also, March numbers showed 53 days, on average.
@RogerChrista RAMP (appellants who opted into RAMP from the legacy process), for the Dec-Feb timeframe. I don't have an update for March, and with gates opening up, 37 is not a promise for the future--just a point in time. It's working well.
@RogerChrista The rating criteria is unchanged. You will receive the same decision with RAMP as you would under the legacy appeals process. Last data I had, from February, showed decisions averaging 37 days and almost a 60-percent grant rate.
@RogerChrista Claims and appeals are not in the same bag. They are different processes with different lanes and different laws. Next, one does not file a NOD/appeal for an increase. That would be a claim. One can ONLY submit a NOD/appeal after disagreeing with a completed claim decision. 1/2

@talleynet You can't file a Form 9 if VA didn't look at your claim. You can only file an appeal if a decision has been made on a claim.  An appeal means you disagree with the decision VA made. Please speak to a VSO (they're free) for assistance: https://t.co/I8TSFVHxAM
@talleynet They are not the federal VA; they are your state's Veterans Services/Department. Are they acting as your VSO? Filing a "Form 9" is an appeal, meaning you have received and disagreed with a decision on a claim for disability compensation.
@weshardeniv We're a team of two, and we don't have records access. Your claim status is an estimation. It will move forward and backward multiple times. This is common.
@laniep34 Fake.

@ramoore422 The rating criteria hasn't changed, and average wait for legacy system is 5+ years. Under RAMP, so far, it's been 37 days (goal is 125). Same requirements will lead to same decision, either way. That's not a lie, not taking away benefits. Please let us know if you have Qs.

@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA The combat Veterans running this account won't forget. Be well, Fred.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA Agreed. We're not fond of this, either. Very frustrating. It's why RAMP appears so promising.
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 Doesn't have to be an appeal. You can include these on a claim, too.
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 All of these are things a VBA public contact or service rep, or VSO can assist you with.
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 But that only satisfies 1/3 of reqs; the current medical diagnosis (VA or private) is the second piece of evidence that should be included WITH the claim; a VA or private doctor should write the nexus linking service condition to current condition (nexus).
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 In my previous tweet w/three evidence things, it's the active service records that contain deployment + health records, such as orders, awards, profiles, sick call slips, hospital receipts, prescriptions, etc. Copy of these should be WITH your claim. More...
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 One must show that they have an injury/med condition that affects them RIGHT NOW because of something that happened to them in service. VA doesn't award compensation for things that happened in service, but for things that affect them NOW as result of service. More...
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 Fred, let us know when you receive a physical copy of the decision letter from VA, and what that says. It sounds like there may be a misunderstanding somewhere with all the he said/she said and phone tag.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA Medical evidence alone isn't enough to be granted disability compensation. See previous tweet on three things needed.
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 Michelle, each claim must show three things: a current medical diagnosis; evidence of an injury/medical condition in the Vet's active military service records; a nexus from doctor linking the former to the latter. That's it.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA Thanks for the tip, but hundreds of thousands of Vets self-file their claims each year and are granted compensation benefits; for those who don't feel they can do it, or who need assistance, there are VA resources and VSOs who will do it for free.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA It's a Vet's choice to seek legal representation. However, we always recommend a certified Veterans Service Organization to assist Vets in filing. They're free, knowledgeable, trained, and have no incentive for large backpay. There are additional VA resources, too.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA SSA has different laws and evidence requirements. We administer VA benefits, such as disability compensation, based on laws your elected representatives write. These laws specify certain evidence reqs as a taxpayer protection.
@1MaidenUSA @ArmyVeteran11 Many reasons. First that the laws governing appeals were written 80+ years ago. Antiquated + inefficient. Second, a huge line. Third, process doesn't technically have an end. Vets can + do appeal indefinitely. Lastly, Vets don't only appeal denials--they appeal grants, too.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA RAMP is just a new process. The rating criteria hasn't changed. Your date for retro, if granted, doesn't change. Seven years for one or more decisions is a long time. It's why we have this new process. In January, RAMP decisions averaged 37 days.
@ArmyVeteran11 @1MaidenUSA Fred, you are spreading misinformation. RAMP does not reduce or get rid of backpay. Please learn more about this House, Senate, and POTUS-signed law, here: https://t.co/4d6IRsdOj2
@1MaidenUSA The quoted tweet is factually inaccurate and dangerously misleading. One does not lose backpay with RAMP. Why are we doing this? So Veterans don't wait 5+ years waiting on appeals. In January, RAMP averaged 37 days to complete. More details on, here: https://t.co/4d6IRsdOj2

@gamongold @InfamousBlanchy Again, VA administers federal benefits and services based on what your elected representatives write into law.

@sgtrone @ThunderUp405OKC I'm confused. Are you talking about a C&amp;P, or about BVA adjudication process? They're completely different.
@jcincoski Not sure what you're referring to, but a 0-percent rating is a service-connected condition. And if the medical condition worsens, then you can submit a DRC "claim for an increase" with new evidence to have it decided in 30 days: https://t.co/P2qxQy9tRx

@brent_kellogg You didn't send a copy of your military service records attached to your claim???
@realteetoo We actually grant close to 70 percent of the 1.3m claims we receive each year. And if you need help preparing a claim, you can ask us, talk to the Public Contact at the RO, or talk to the VSO you tagged in your tweet. They are free, knowledgable, and trained.
@realteetoo That's not how it works. Please let us know if you need assistance, and we'll do our best to link you up.
@Tylardurdan7 We have nothing at all to do with this.
@MA_Deb64 @VaBenefits Ugh. Not indoor, I meant "in your."

@ThunderUp405OKC What is your question?
@powelljohnny24 @VeteransHealth You can file a "DRC" for an increase with a VSO, and get a decision in 30 days. You just need evidence from a doctor that your SC-condition has worsened. More here: https://t.co/P2qxQy9tRx
@powelljohnny24 @VeteransHealth Are you talking about a formal appeal of your completed disability compensation claim? Compensation is one of the dozens of benefits we administer. Who you think wants you to die, and why? Have you reported this to VA Police, or OIG?

@TactlessOpinion Still not sure what you mean by "system," but our friends at @VeteransHealth can address your VA healthcare issues.

@TactlessOpinion Not sure what you're referring to. Is there something we can help with?

@pamnyco An initial batch of RAMP participants had their appeals decided in an average of 37 days. Soft rollout with the oldest pending appeals, but results are promising. More notifications going out each month.
@pamnyco So, actually, this is the first big appeals change in 80+ years. You said "nothing will change," but this is the change. House, Senate, and POTUS signed new law allowing this change.
@Miser592 OK, so you have heard something. That's good. But the point of the DAV tweet re: RAMP is our new process that will fix the wait with appeals.
@jhwilliams685 @AmericanLegion The rating criteria and evidence requirements have not changed.

@DragonHunt68 New legislation is what was needed, and that was passed late last year. RAMP will ask all 490,000 appellants if they want to opt in, receive decision in 125 days. The legacy system's wait is related to number in line, inefficient process. RAMP addresses this.
@DragonHunt68 Not in service file means no record of the injury or medical condition in the service records, which is one of three things needed to be granted. But with AO, that's not needed, only that one meets the presumption criteria.
@DragonHunt68 We also often recommend filing a "reconsideration" instead of appealing. And for third-party info or recommendation, there are VSOs who can assist, too.
@DragonHunt68 Each claim decision letter outlines the legal reasoning for the decision based on the submitted/available evidence. Here, and on FB, we discuss what's needed. We provide info, links, videos, tutorials, and offer general tips and advice.
@DragonHunt68 We grant close to 70 percent of the 1.3m claims we receive each year. In FY15, we paid $64 BILLION in compensation to MILLIONS of Vets; that jumped to $80 BILLION in FY16. Average rating--50%--now higher than ever, for more medical conditions than ever: https://t.co/0OvUS2rrOh

@Jumbojones8 What help do you need?
@ChrisPe22615615 VA doesn't own or operate the commissary.
@DragonHunt68 It is the separate appeals process that is taking years. This is the process where Vets can formally disagree with a completed claim decision, seeking to have a second decision. The laws governing this process are 80+ years old, bureaucratic and inefficient.
@DragonHunt68 Your understanding of the terminology and processes is incorrect. Claims for disability compensation are averaging under 100 days. Of 326,000 pending claims, just 80,000 of them are older than 125 days ("backlog"): https://t.co/ud4nb7kGP8

@DragonHunt68 VHA's doctors are not VBA's raters. Doctors examine and treat patients. A medical condition is just one of three necessary pieces of evidence to be granted service-connection, and our rating staff follows federal law in adjudicating claims.
@DragonHunt68 If you have questions about the claims process or a claim decision, a VBA RO Public Contact can assist you, as can a VSO.
@DragonHunt68 A "person" doesn't reject a claim. A team of raters adjudicate claims. FDC adtc rates are under 100 days. If our raters talked to the claimants filing 1.3m claims every year, they'd never get anything done. That said, some raters do call Vets. 1/2

@cj5414 @DeptVetAffairs If you file it online, it can't get lost. You're directly uploading it into eBenefits. But if you're having issues, you should speak with a VSO for assistance.
@LulababeKy "Not service connected" means there wasn't evidence in mil records of injury to rotator cuff. Not saying condition doesn't exist, just saying that condition wasn't caused by service. The dislocation was, so, again, adding tear as secondary to dislocation is best bet.
@LulababeKy Best bet is to see a VSO to file a new claim for a secondary condition.
@LulababeKy This is what we refer to as a "secondary condition," something that happened as a result of a service connection. If the dislocation is SC, and if the evidence shows that the tear was caused by the SC, then could file a claim to have the tear added as a secondary condition. 1/2
@BeachWein Jessica, we administer VA benefits to military Veterans and their dependents. The Anti-Lobbying Act prohibits us, and other branches of the federal government, from participating in political discourse.

@LulababeKy I'm not sure what you're asking. Surgery is a medical procedure, not a medical condition or diagnosis. Are you asking about disability compensation? Or VA healthcare?
Want to see what upcoming events we're participating in (that YOU can attend)? https://t.co/80LJfqfKzl
@Cloudy361 We can't answer for you. That said, severance repayment comes out of the monthly compensation amount. So, one wouldn't receive the monthly amount until the severance has been repaid. How long is determined by the amount owed / monthly rate.
@Cloudy361 Compensation cannot be paid to the Veteran until the DoD severance, if there was one, has been repaid.
@Cloudy361 Again, a Vet should include all her evidence with a claim. And again, VA treatment records alone aren't enough to be granted. Yes, VA will look at available VA records if the Vet fails to submit all her evidence.
@Cloudy361 A Vet should include these with her claim. These three things are also necessary with an appeal of a completed claim. Again, the rating criteria hasn't changed with RAMP.
@Cloudy361 This is a misunderstanding of the requirements and process. To be granted disability compensation, a claimant needs three things: current medical diagnosis (VA or civ), evidence of injury/medical condition in military service records, and nexus. 1/2
@Cloudy361 We track whether decisions are correct/justified based on available submitted evidence. Under legacy process, overturn rates were low. Those that were overturned were done so because of new or additional evidence that wasn't included in initial claim.
@Cloudy361 Unless they comment on social media, we wouldn't know. But thing to remember is that rating criteria doesn't change: you get the same decision in 125 days with RAMP as you would with 5 years under legacy.
@Cloudy361 It's been functional for those who've opted in since December. It becomes mandatory for new appeals beginning in Feb '19.

@Camay71Si CFR is the law. It's the Code of Federal Regulations, which is written by your elected representatives. But yes, consistency is key. It's why all claims are seen by at least three people before completion, and why we continue to hold mandatory training for all raters.
Are you (OR do you know) a Veteran who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless? Contact us for help: https://t.co/CivUj29wjY

@MouseMan_USMC That would be Compensation Service, in central office. Your best bet is to speak to your local RO's Public Contact.
@Outkum What is your issue?
@Camay71Si More than half of our raters are actually Veterans themselves, and most of the rest are dependents of Vets. They process according to what's written in law. Claimants should have a medical diagnosis prior to filing claim, but that's only 1/3rd of necessary evidence.

@honeywell0947 Right now, the average days to complete an appeal under RAMP is 37 days. This will likely change as more opt in, but yes, it looks to me like it is working.
@honeywell0947 Do Vets know about RAMP? It's brand new, and that's why we're talking about it and getting the word out. In the future, claims decision letters will reflect the change.
@banksma48 Yes, VR&amp;E payments delayed for approx. 11,000 Vets. Estimated posting is February 6.
@honeywell0947 Dennis, RAMP is brand new. Law signed in August, letters sent out to oldest appellates in November, program began in January. Eventually, all appellates will be notified of chance to opt in. Currently, only the oldest have been contacted. Not sure what you mean by "target."
@honeywell0947 In 2019, all NEW appeals will go into RAMP. Until then, all current pending appellates will be allowed to opt into the new RAMP from the old legacy appeals process. Since RAMP literally just began, I don't see how it can be "not on target."
@lingg_lingg Check for what? Life insurance? Pension? Education/GIBill? GI Bill MHA? Disability compensation? Something else?
@CPontisso531 Today is the first day of the new month. MHA can take couple days to process, but you can inquire at GI Bill hotline: https://t.co/Q5kEQyHlS5
@itcanbeseen Sounds like you need to speak with the USMC about retirement. All government emails end in .gov or, for the military, in .mil.
@CruzzinOki Here's the thing: the rating criteria hasn't changed. You will get the same decision in 125 days with new RAMP as you would in five years under old system. The rest, afterwards, is what you should discuss with a VSO.
@toriel_imani @The_Zila Today is the first day of the new month.

@sgtrone @RogerChrista "1506" is not exactly "boosting" or flattering. And the definition of average inherently means that some are older and some are newer. Again, not very good numbers. It's why we've developed a new process...
@TheGoat3074 @whitecarrot16 Even better, Brad: the claim decision letter spells it out, with legal justification, and one can always talk to a VSO for assistance, too.   :)
@gonemad4now We're Vets, too.
@krismarief Did you know that one can appeal an appealed appeal's appeal, indefinitely? That, even after multiple decisions (including granting), a Vet can just keep appealing?
@sgtrone @RogerChrista Legislation was signed in August, letter sent out in November. Which means that first recipients had until December 31 to respond, and that it began shortly afterward.
@CruzzinOki You can speak to a VSO to decide what's best for you.

@RogerChrista Claims are awaiting a decision. Appeals are disagreements with a claim decision. One can appeal and appealed appeal's appeal, indefinitely. So, while claims are waiting on one decision, an appeal could've already had five decisions. Laws and timelines not the same.
@RogerChrista We don't have access to records, no way for us to know. Historically speaking, "backlog" for VA purposes is defined as a claim older than 125 days. Since there is no definition for appeals, the term doesn't apply in the same way. Why is this so? 1/2
@RogerChrista Appeals are not part of the "backlog." Those with appeals will be contacted by VA to see if they want to be moved into the quicker process.
@yaaasbetch Jameel, your friend will have to apply to upgrade his discharge through the Department of Defense.
@RogerChrista VA "appeals reform" has been a thing for many years. Late last year, it finally happened. House, Senate, and POTUS passed new law allowing us to create new appeals process. We call is RAMP: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS
@RogerChrista If that was the case, then there wouldn't be a wait... but yes, something was contributing: It's that the laws governing the appeals process were written 80+ years ago. Slow, inefficient, not workable for modern situation. Needed legislative solution. 1/2

@RogerChrista That wouldn't actually solve anything--not for the Vet and not for VA. In fact, that just doubles the work...
@pamnyco @rl_klein FDC completion rates avg'ing under 100 days: https://t.co/ud4nb7kGP8		Our appeals personnel are highest-rating, experienced on staff; takes years to gain that knowledge/experience. Biggest impediment to appeals was inefficient, 80+ year-old laws.
@rl_klein 2/2: As for appeals, the House/Senate/POTUS signed into law new legislation allowing us to create a new appeals system: https://t.co/wIf0BA2BRS
@rl_klein If you have a NOD, reducing the backlog of claims wouldn't affect you. The "backlog" tracks claims. You're talking about the appeal (disagreement) of an already completed claim decision. Appeals are not claims. 1/2
@mdkissick DRC requires the use of a VSO. An FDC can be self started and completed online in eBenefits.

@ProSe0007 Have you appealed your claim decision by sending in a NOD? Your claim decision letter outlines the reasoning for the decision. It includes a Notice of Disagreement. Sending that in is what begins the appeals process. An SOC comes much later in the appeals process.

@egopanthers @allen_ggirl If your son is having an issue with the VSO, he should seek out a new VSO, or try one of the other methods to file.
@egopanthers @allen_ggirl We've received 1.2 - 1.3 million claims each year for the past five years. We're paying billions of dollars in compensation to millions of Veterans. It doesn't take long to file, and the time it takes to process the claim has been drastically reduced.
@egopanthers @allen_ggirl Here is how to do it all online in eBenefits: https://t.co/jEV0draQ3V
@egopanthers @allen_ggirl Again, here is how to apply: https://t.co/hiQsoMdTsT		The simplest, easiest way is to file the claim online in eBenefits. To do that, you have to scan your evidence and upload it with the claim. If that's not an option to him, the VSO can file it online for him.
@egopanthers @allen_ggirl FDC completions are averaging under 100 days: https://t.co/ud4nb7kGP8
@egopanthers @allen_ggirl Evidence must be submitted with the claim, not after the claim. Submitting evidence after a claim will knock it out of the FDC process. Yes, that will significantly delay the processing. By definition, FDC = fully developed, meaning everything is ready and included when submitted
@allen_ggirl @egopanthers Has the claim actually been submitted or just started but not submitted?
