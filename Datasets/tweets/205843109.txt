.@MariaShriver: 3 things you can do as part of the #WipeOutAlz campaign:
"If we can put a man on the moon, we can put a woman on the brain." ~Maria Shriver: https://t.co/vx1scTWufQ #wipeoutalz
.@MariaShriver: And more often than not, the issue you should write about or get involved in is right in front of you.
.@MariaShriver: : I think an interesting to note here is that people say is I don‚Äôt know what to write about, I don‚Äôt know what to focus on.
.@LisaGenova: The process of writing the book for me is doing very informed fiction. Research, interview with doctors, patients‚Ä¶
Q&amp;A with audience of the conversation now.
.@MariaShriver: So the idea that there‚Äôs nothing you can do is false. @LisaGenova: Yes, right. #WipeOutAlz http://t.co/FXhtpUR7jb
Chronic stress is the worst thing for your memory‚Ä¶
.@MariaShriver: Because we know it is the only thing that can calm the mind. #WipeOutAlz Do you believe that? @LisaGenova:  I absolutely do
.@MariaShriver: Someone told me, can we get it out there that mediation is the socially conscious thing to do.
.@MariaShriver: One of the other things that people ask me a lot is what is the effect of meditation?  #WipeOutAlz
.@LisaGenova: You can‚Äôt do something about the genes you‚Äôve inherited, but you can do something about al those things‚Ä¶
.@LisaGenova: Do you have chronic stress? Cholesterol? Type 2 diabetes? Can u avoid concussions by wearing seats belts/helmets? #WipeOutAlz
.@LisaGenova: For 98% of people with Alzheimer‚Äôs, you can have bad genes, and your scale can still balance out, you still don‚Äôt have Alz
.@LisaGenova: When you pile the risk on one side and it hits the floor, you‚Äôre going to get dementia.
.@LisaGenova: Think of the risk of alzheimer‚Äôs as a seasaw scale...
.@LisaGenova: In terms of the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs, there‚Äôs such a myth that there‚Äôs no cure, so we can‚Äôt do anything.
.@MariaShriver: What should you do, what can you do, to prevent Alzheimer's?
.@LisaGenova: Because if you live long enough, it is going to happen to you or someone you love. #wipeoutalz
.@LisaGenova: Because if you live long enough, it is going to happen to you or someone you love.
.@MariaShriver: Why should the women here care about Alzheimer's? #wipeoutalz
A photo of the conversation: https://t.co/KLMJvbAEaa
.@LisaGenova: If people think of Alzheimer‚Äôs as people in nursing homes &amp; if Alzheimer‚Äôs looks like Julianne Moore, that‚Äôs a different story
.@LisaGenova:  When it comes to Alzheimer‚Äôs and finding a cure and reasing money for research, telling the story matters.
.@LisaGenova: Then, as I found so many younger people with early onset alzheimers, I tried to do justice to their stories‚Ä¶.
.@LisaGenova: Well first it stared as a way to understand my nana and to pay tribute to her.
.@MariaShriver: Was your goal to reach people with Alzheimer‚Äôs and their families? #WipeOutAlz
.@LisaGenova: ok, I thought this was how it‚Äôs going to happen. But there must be a different way.
.@LisaGenova: yeah. And when I was doing it, it wasn‚Äôt in an aggressive way. Every time I got a ‚Äúno,‚Äù I was like ‚Äúhuh..."
.@MariaShriver: What‚Äôs interesting to me is that, first you sat down and wrote. And then you didn‚Äôt take no for an answer.
.@MariaShriver: Everyone I meet seems to have a book in them, but so many reason they can't do.
.@LisaGenova: I was trying to generate enough buzz to get a literary agent. It was a period of guerrilla marketing.
.@LisaGenova: So in 2007, I self-published it and started selling it from the trunk of my car, asking people to write reviews on Amazon...
.@LisaGenova: It was either Alzheimer's is too scary, or I should write a nonfiction book as a neuroscientist. And I had a novel.
.@LisaGenova: After writing the book, I sent out 100 query letters. All came back in some form of a rejection.
.@MariaShriver: So that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really interesting to me. You asked yourself the question. And then you sat down and wrote the book.
.@LisaGenova: In 2004 I had gotten a divorce &amp; stayed at home w my daughter &amp; I wondered, what would I do if I could do anything I wanted?
.@MariaShriver: How did you decide to write the book?
.@LisaGenova: And I told a colleague one day I want to write a book about someone whose been diagnosed with Alzheimer's from an early age
.@LisaGenova: and I had this intuitive understanding that literature is the palce where you can explore empathy.
.@LisaGenova: I had this idea in 1998, I was working as a scientist not a writer...
.@LisaGenova: And I thought, what is it like to have it, not from the outside looking in, but from the perspective from of my nana.
.@LisaGenova: And I did a lot of research about it and found that everything that had been written was by a clinician and scientist.
.@LisaGenova: I'm there, not one of the caregivers because I was one of the youngest grandkids, but im there to to witness her story.
.@LisaGenova: My grandmother has 9 children. They all rallied, 5 daughters and 4 sons. And it was the daughters who became the caregivers.
.@LisaGenova: My background is in neuroscience. I was doing scientific research. My interest in alzheimer‚Äôs start with my nana
.@MariaShriver: The story of this book is really quite amazing. Lisa, tell everybody how you came to write this book.
.@MariaShriver: The goal is to leave everybody with 3 things they didn‚Äôt know before they came in and 3 actions we can take away.
.@MariaShriver: I thought @LisaGenova would be really interesting to listen to. I know everyone has a book in them or an idea in them.
We'll be live-tweeting a Mind-Powered Conversation between @MariaShriver &amp; @LisaGenova in around 15 minutes. Stay tuned right here!
