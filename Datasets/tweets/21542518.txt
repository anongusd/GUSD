RT @ZcohenCNN: Glad to hear Schultz asked about the VA during this #CNNTownHall.		Pledges to fix the VA and be held personally accountable‚Ä¶
Schultz goes on to say that fixing the VA is about government bureaucracy (ya think?), ‚Äúleadership‚Äù and ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù. Says, ‚ÄúI PROMISE YOU! I WILL FIX THE VA!!!‚Äù All generalities and ZERO specifics. Weak and arrogant answer. He‚Äôs got lots of homework to do on that one.
Right after I posted this, great question from an Army vet asking Schultz what he‚Äôll do about the @DeptVetAffairs.  Schultz talking lots about his vet-focused foundation. Cites size of VA budget‚Äîas the problem. Sorta. Says, ‚ÄúI will fix the VA!‚Äù Yeah, we never heard that before. https://t.co/jgoAEjq2xb

Good question. I have no idea. That‚Äôs a problem with most of these big vet hiring announcements. Companies always get great press for announcing. But they rarely report back publicly on results.

Worth noting, Amazon made a flashy commitment a few years ago to hire 25,000 vets: https://t.co/kySDTO8cHP I‚Äôd be interested to hear from them (and @NYCMayor &amp; @NYGovCuomo) how many vets could be employed in the NYC Amazon deal. Same in Virginia. cc @errollouis @LeoShane
Amazon‚Äôs handled it terribly. Cuomo‚Äôs handled it terribly. So much arrogance all around. It‚Äôs now become a case study in how to turn something potentially fantastic into a total political mess. A stunning lack of vision, planing and most of all, leadership.

This annual survey takes a MASSIVE amount of hard and precise work. Our deepest thanks‚Äîmost of all‚Äîto our incredible members worldwide who took it. And especially to the author, our brilliant colleague and @IAVA Research Director, @StephMuls! https://t.co/cmlYgNjijh
Who are they? @iava members have served in combat extensively. And are young, mostly male and increasingly independent politically. https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK https://t.co/Cw9iBoQ8jx
Cannabis is a very hot topic nationwide right now. And @IAVA vets continue to have strong opinions about it. https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK #cannabisforvets https://t.co/5UWa02hJQA
And of course @IAVA again focused a ton this year on @DeptVetAffairs. Wanna cut through the spin and see how V.A. is really doing with post-9/11 vets? This is some very important data. https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK https://t.co/LvIDNSkA2Y
Iraq and Afghanistan are out of the news headlines. But they are often on the minds of @IAVA members. We asked the tough question. Do you think our engagement there was worth it? https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK https://t.co/FHB5wpuU0V
And @IAVA goes even deeper. These numbers are very important. And the recent #shutdown could make them much worse. https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK https://t.co/kcD0QSxd7T
There‚Äôs some good news in here too. This is a promising employment number that continues a solid trend. @IAVA surveyed over 4500 vets. When @USDOL produces their number they often ask MUCH less. Sometimes less than a quarter of that.  https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK https://t.co/9eKlpOl4gf
Congress and @realDonaldTrump have LOTS of room for improvement. https://t.co/qhV2dF3YLK @IAVA https://t.co/QDceR2OGDa

@denosral @danvon1 @kenbonesbrain Every player on the Giants made the NFL last year and they were an abomination. Not a good metric to compare teams‚Äîor any kind. Especially teams with dozens of players who have to play together with precision.
Ok. Let‚Äôs do this. If Alabama played the NY Jets, could they pull out a win?
@JstupidT https://t.co/Aw6doW6XkF
@BioPatAtty And 20 point underdogs occasionally win.
@MobotyRoboty @kenbonesbrain True. Like the 9ers and Jets.
@denosral @kenbonesbrain It‚Äôs really not. Great, tight, experienced, well-coached teams can beat divided, badly coached, egotistical teams. And importance of coaching can not be underestimated.
One of the things Alabama does better than any other team is block. At every position. And especially downfield. They always say football is all about blocking and tackling. Both these teams are exceptionally good at both. Also a true testament to their excellent coaching.
@BioPatAtty Any given Sunday. To know the game is to know anything can happen. Especially with good coaching.
You apparently haven‚Äôt watched teams like the Jets play lately. https://t.co/94DjK03QPC
@kenbonesbrain Short-sighted, man. It‚Äôs not only about the quality of players. It‚Äôs about how they play together. Bama is that good.
Clemson‚Äôs talented &amp; deep. But Alabama is a machine. They play as a team like none other. And could probably beat a few NFL teams. Hard to pick against em. Esp against a freshman QB‚Äîas amazing as he is and will be. Should be a fun one. &amp; a demonstration of why we love this game.

What is our moral, financial and national security responsibility when we send millions to war? Demand for vets support is up and the supply of financial support is down. It‚Äôs long past time to reevaluate and change how America thinks about the true costs of war.
@FPWellman @HomeDepot For sure. It‚Äôs amazing. And they‚Äôre a true leader. But you know as well as anyone, we need more than hundreds of millions. We likely need billions. And the private sector can‚Äôt meet the massive demand alone.
A real discussion needs to happen in this country about what supporting vets really means. Why doesn‚Äôt the government do this? Why do philanthropy &amp; non-profits have to do so much so often? And the truth is, we can‚Äôt keep up. Supporting the troops has to mean more in America.
