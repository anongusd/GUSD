@J_Dot_J You didn't have it for breakfast? Impressive.
@JohnEOla1 @BrennanCenter @MrWalterShapiro Well put. Could care less about the funding. It's the bankrupt ideas that annoy me.
@MichaelCorleyNY The sad truth is that Jesus himself as potus couldn't get congressmen &amp; senators from rural areas to support funding required to fix big city schools &amp; housing. They don't even want to fund transit.  Not from these places, cant relate, and fear/loathe brown folks that live here
@MichaelCorleyNY with trying to work with fools and disingenuous bigots who happen to be in power. They will do nothing but phot ops, as the black clergy has seen with the current admin.  But otherwise I say you have to engage and work within to effectuate actual policies. Agitation has its place
@MichaelCorleyNY Black concerns suddenly look like everyones concerns because who (besides conservatives) don't want better schools, healthcare, &amp; housing.  These are not radical ideas in of themselves.  I think single payer will be the clear choice in our lifetime after seeing all others fail
@MichaelCorleyNY At the presidential level they have to represent everyone.  They need congressional support for whatever agenda they have. The practical effect is that they have to represent everyone.  So, education, housing, healthcare are obvious areas where most can work together.
@MichaelCorleyNY I get that, but I see Bernie's journey as being purely symbolic.  Support causes that have no chance of winning - you get credit for being "woke" but accomplish nothing.  The other route would be to form alliances and get what you can from those in power.  I do draw the line &gt;
@MichaelCorleyNY Bernie has been in congress for decades but accomplished absolutely nothing. Its great to put progressive ideas into the public discourse, but at some point you need to have something to show for it as a leader.  What has he implemented? Its easy to be a contrarian.
@MichaelCorleyNY There has to be more of a point to this than expecting every black politician to have been a housing rights activist all their life.  Obama, Kamala, Booker, all have done some remarkable things in their careers.  The question is what do most black people want from leadership?
@MichaelCorleyNY Obama was a community organizer. The folks who "played it up" did so in the hopes that it would hurt him. He was also a civil rights lawyer, but they didn't play that up because it highlights that he has some formal qualifications.  Corey rode with Newark cops virtually nightly.
@nycsouthpaw The man needs to return to the rock he's been under his entire life.  Zero patience for this type of sheer ignorance.  Infuriating that he gets prime media access to spew this head in the sand garbage.
@MichaelCorleyNY I don't put a lot of stock in that stuff but I know it may have a subconscious impact on me thinking the person is at some level "cool enough" to make them feel like a better choice.  The absurdity of it is that Kamala &amp; Corey wont be "black enough" but Bernie will? mad metric
@MichaelCorleyNY Every politician ever always looks for an angle to "connect."  Some are conveniently real (recounting something they did long ago but now secretly abhor), or entirely contrived. Sadly they do it because it works. People are intellectually lazy that way.  "I'd have a beer w him"

@MichaelCorleyNY If Farrakhan were potus do people think he'd accomplish a black nationalist agenda? Do they think presidents make laws &amp; authorize spending without Congress? The black Messiah those folks want needs to be at the local levels of government. Presidents usually have to be centrists
@MichaelCorleyNY As for Obama, most African Americans I know hold him in high regard. Clearly not all do but I'd bet a poll would show in excess of 80%. He never ran as a black nationalist, or even a progressive. Ran and governed as a centrist, mostly.
@MichaelCorleyNY She should be vetted as all candidates should, based on answers to a host of questions on a multitude of issues. She'll sink or swim. No need for the odd argument that's she's not African American. Clarence Thomas is African American.
@MichaelCorleyNY She probably knows it's going to go viral and give life to a whole movement of needless division.
@MichaelCorleyNY Honestly I don't get it.  She was born here. What other life does she know? She's American, and her father is of African heritage. What more do you guys want from her? Would an African American grandparent enough? Great grand? Great-great grand?
