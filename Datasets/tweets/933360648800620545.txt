@BiGB900 I thought I saw something in Canada where they have tried this...in the end people will do what they want. Prohibition never works. It only kills people because there's no way to know if product is pure or an entirely different substance.
@BiGB900 Yes please don't play with unknown drugs no matter how much you trust your dealer. In the end they don't give a shit about you. They just want your money...this is one reas9n I would like to see heroin dispensed at pharmacy with a script. This would cut down on tainted heroin.
@BiGB900 @DanceSafe Because of this long half life it would take at least 3 to 5 days to not have it In your system or longer. It's good it lasts longer but means withdrawals are 3x stronger than other "stuff"
@BiGB900 @DanceSafe I would be careful of using subs and other opiates..the sub raises your threshold. It's how people overdose.  Because the effects dont happen someone makes the mistake to up the dose. My advice? Stay off the heroin . Also suboxone has a 36 to 48 hour half life.
