Florida is going after pain patients but ignoring gun owners of military grade weaponry and ammunitions caches. What's wrong with you FLORIDA??? Have you gone crazy? My pain is entire spinal cord trauma, every muscle and organ affected for God's sake!
TV reported Florida legislators passing rule requiring doctors write initial pain scripts for a max of 3 days only, and setting up mandatory computer database of doctors and pain patients tracking like we're criminals. DEA  enforcing 40 percent reduction by pharmacies. HELP US!

@hisey_mike @realDonaldTrump President Trump. Where were you? They are America's children. You're a father.
@santo_aol Now if Trump'll just declare his election a hoax, we can get back to living again as Americans in the best country, like it used to be.
@marcorubio Senator Rubio, come back to Christ. Rejoin the side of brotherly love. Know that we are like lilies in the field. God will take care of us with blessings in abundance. Don't rely on the NRA, their fruit is death and pain.
@EricBoehlert Hey GOP! If Rick Scott is your GREAT WHITE HOPE, you've already lost. He's a criminal, a thief of our tax dollars for poorer Americans needing Medicaid. He stole our MEDICAID DOLLARS! So NO WAY are we willing to accept Rick Scott.
@marcorubio @washingtonpost I like you Rubio, but you are wrong about this gun issue. Ask Jesus Christ if you don't believe me. It's hard after accepting over $3+ mil, but remember the prodigal son. Everybody wants you to be the courageous hero here, so maybe try it.

@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @HillaryClinton @JohnKerry @BarackObama Trump's election campaign drew FBI due to his hiring as well as Russian money laundering  via real estate in Florida.

@JoeMayer3 @Cruellaisdevine @BravenakBlog So save you money and keep watching the NRA control gun laws. It's a choice we all get to make. Still, it's an effective method to achieve gun law changes in a relatively short time.
@Plantflowes It not the chat rooms. It's their purpose (ie. propaganda, harassment and lies planning by Trump's Russian hackers). The FBI isn't bringing us together by this  move, we're more divided, knowing what we saw in 2016 online. I was followed by these DT trolls all over the internet.
@WhiteHouse You Trump and the Republicans are pure evil. Stealing not just our tax dollars, not just money the disabled, elderly, sick, homeless, and hungry, you know steal our FICA money, our funds for retirement, disability, and healthcare. You've no right to that money, Hitler
@WhiteHouse You and the GOP take $$$$ from the NRA, keeping military grade automatic rifles legal for purchase with unlimited ammunition. If you cared like you pretend, change laws to restrict/monitor gun/ammo access and purchase. If you cared this never would've happened, right?
As an independent for 2016 election I received tons of online Trump propaganda. I never saw one piece of propaganda that wasn't in favor of Trump, Republicans and negativve lies against Clinton. I know others who experienced it. Trump's propaganda machine had a private chat room.
@NBCNews Please stop showing this horror again and again to America. It's become ridiculous the way you are hurting people with bombardment of the public. Once or twice is sufficient. We are intelligent.
@GOP @FoxNews  You are liars. You're telling yourselves that you're lying for national security. It isn't true. The divisiveness in our nation is occurring because of Trump and Republicans lying and buddying up to Russia and Putin. The interference WAS NOT BIPARTISAN, you liars.
@TheDailyEdge Stop slamming the FBI just for the benefit of the Republican Party. Rick Scott and local police knew and did nothing. They and Republicans are simply differing blame, drawing attention away from more GOP shenanigans in Congress. They abdicated their duty giving Trump more power.
@SenFeinstein Yeah! Thank you Senator Feinstein. Americans everywhere support this bill. There is NO REASON at ALL it shouldn't immediately be voted through Congress unanimously. Way to go!
@CBSNews We love our military and law enforcement, but it begs an answer FBI....why haven't you investigated Trump for money laundering w/Russian "Oligarchs'", his excessively close relationship with Putin, rapes reported by many women including a 13 yr old?
America, if you're serious about changing gun laws, immediately go and join the NRA. Then without disclosing your views, run for office internally. NRA has an important voice. YOU change the NRA from being a no compromise organization to one of compromise. Join NRA, see change.!!
@JoeMayer3 @Cruellaisdevine @BravenakBlog I'm talking about how to make a huge difference in gun laws in a short period of time. It's no different than flipping blue. You join, you vote, it's simple. Just because you join the NRA doesn't mean you carry the old agenda, you bring in new life, blood, and thinking. Join NRA!

@stateinnovation @Guttmacher Congress is like a crazed pack of wolves devouring us, Christian ones are the worst of all! You're killing Americans and don't care. At least wolves don't kill for ego or sport, only to keep from starving. It means they are better than the lying garbage in Congress.

@thehill @1984Mikae Stop calling our guaranteed FICA funds an entitlement. It was a financially sound system until Republicans stole money out of it twice. FICA isn't taxes, it's a guaranteed Social Security Retirement, Medicare, Medicaid, Disability program. Replace the money, don't build wall.

I had great hope for Trump but am so disappointed him/GOP
@4realDJsdream @wikileaks @ChristiChat @realDonaldTrump Is this uranium a danger or is it a form of uranium used for non war purposes? Radioactive materials have all kinds of applications in science and medicine, and aren't dangerous if handled properly.
Thank you Resistance. You're a light in the empty darkness of space. You may call yourselves a bluewave, but you're a supernova in my eyes. https://t.co/WQwGanXNHF
I almost died at age of 27 yrs from pain, it flat out kills. Medicine simply cannot fix everything. Stop killing us - Mr President. DEA. It could be you or your son one day!	Kelly deputy named drug czar https://t.co/WTGsk0PiU8
Just in case there's an American "out there" who missed it. America WAKE UP! The United States has a Russian Supremacist in their Whitehouse, and because of him the world and UN, women, disabled, children, sick, elderly, nonwhites are suffering. The world doesn't respect us now.
Instead of following back, can we march on the Whitehouse and Congress? Maybe have DT walk the gauntlet? https://t.co/HRCHiklGHk
Did it work for you in 2016?
You're trusting in rules, laws and conventions. But the Russian in the Whitehouse and the GOP don't honor such things. They lie, hire hacking propagandists, hack media, hack voter rolls, are thugs playing cards like fear, sexism, bigotry, prejudice, lawlessness, breaking ethics.
@EdanClay @Rowdygirlinmt ASK her. ASK HER WHY? For God's sake everybody who is decent and honorable is resigning in Washington. Next is MARTIAL LAW if someone doesn't stand up, stay put, and take our beautiful country back America! There's an election stealing squatter Russian in Whitehouse. Run to it!
IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP NOW! It's for your children and grandchildren GOP! It's for every veteran, it's for everybody that saved the world in WWII, it's for the American Constitution, it's for you and me, it's for God.
@GOP What are YOU waiting for? Declaration of Martial Law? What GOP? You could walk in on Donald Trump in the Oval Office being had bent over the desk, by Putin ftom the Russian Kremlin. You'd still dismiss it, say it didn't mean anything and call it foreign relations.
IMPEACH TRUMP NOW!!!
@SenMikeHuckabee @FoxNews FACEBOOK and TWITTER reported thousands of HACKING accounts traced to Russia spewing propaganda in favor of Donald Trump prior to election. 21+ States confirmed voter rolls hacked into. Kremlin and Trump have long financial deals. YOU LIE!
I lost my ability to cry at age 12 yrs. After my father drugged me and put me in a kiddie porn flick. He watched his best friend rape next, then took me to a mining strip pit flooded into the lake. After being tortured by biodad, so I'd never never speak. Donald Trump is worse.
@TeamUSA @GOP As long as the GOP allows a sexual predator to remain in the Whitehouse, you cannot morally claim to be for our beloved Team USA . GOP Clean your house of the predator who is also a Kremlin Traitor. Impeach him now please.
@GOP With all of Trump's incompentcy, Russian Kremlin dealings, financial money laundering for rich Oligarchs via Real Estate, his gross obsession Obamas, Hillary, etc, his sexual crimes against women and children, why aren't you leading impeachment proceedings like Republicans??
@GOP I'm with team FBI, CIA, and NSA. Go team Mueller! Hoorah!

@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @SharonLNYT @shearm Steele dossier ordered up and paid for by Donald Trump. What he saw there (he and Russia) he didn't want and dropped the dossier. Clinton campaign (along with everybody else) heard about it and took it up, bought the dossier. Yes, donnie shot his own foot, again.
@davidfrum No, it isn't. It insanity or treason. Let him out with an insanity plea. Just get him out NOW, before WWIII please. That's your jobs Congressional Republicans and Democrats. Try working together for five minutes to remove him from office. Do you love the USA or not?
@CBSNews Deterrence is easy for you? No problems in making it sound reasonable? But human beings lives being ripped apart and tragically dismissed from basic human rights, this decency you can't manage??? Make ALL DACAs legal citizens NOW for love of God.
@JuddLegum It always is. Don't fall for the worn out Obama card anymore please. If you pay no attention to this, it'll go away quickly. Leave it alone and watch.
@cFidd This is a symptom of the insane man in our Whitehouse. It will not get better until he's removed from office. Only then will Americans put their country ahead of party. We have a Russian in the Whitehouse, an instable one for goodness sakes. Congress do something please!
@TeamCavuto @FoxBusiness It isn't good enough. The man in our Whitehouse is insane. He believes he's our dictator and fails to read or follow the Constitution. Now key leaders in this country are following him. He's insane and must be removed based on mental instability. Period. Now.

He can't handle current issues so he wants a parade in his honor, just like any other little boy staring at the "big red button". Move on it Republicans and Democrats!
@TrueFactsStated He doesn't plan on reading it. I suggest the Democrats get out ahead of this. Remove him from office, quickly, quietly, with a straight jacket and three of your best patriotic doctors, and patriotic lawyers.
@thehill He is not a sane person.
@RWPUSA We all know he doesn't qualify as a decent person. He doesn't even pretend he's decent. The parade isn't about appearing decent, it's about appearing powerful, as in "I have your military backing me up, so screw you America."
@SpeakerRyan  Remember Ryan, this man has to plead and beg for a military parade in order to feel good about himself. You be better than that Ryan. While I disagree with you on many political issues, I recognize intelligence where it exists and where it doesn't. Focus on people.

@KarrieK817 I can live with that, but Trump still must go.
@sbsane @cspan Clean out your ears maybe? Or your mind? Nancy is taking a stand for Democracy and FREEDOM wherever it exists. That means for me and you!
@irishgilly I can't believe John Kelly would do this to our country. It's the same thing as Trump's threatening everyone with our country's military. If he does this you realize we can't count on 2018 elections to change things. Traitors: Hang'em high.
Trump's boldness and recklessness had to be born from the knowledge that he had our top Generals in his pocket from the beginning. The military fights foreign enemies and while they do march in parade formation, it's in support of our country and constitution. Bad. :-(
@Plantflowes I kid you not, presidents don't order up military parades on a whim. He is attempting to make a show of power in the faces of the American people. This isn't a parade celebrating a national holiday, but is purely to glorify Czar Donald Trump. Greatly disturbing.
@MSNBC @NBCNews The military shouldn't perform to elevate or glorify a president. Why? Because the military is a part of our defense system combined with law enforcement and our courts. Not a part of the presidential branch of government, it'd appear to be corrupted.
@PhilipRucker @GregJaffe This is sooooooo sick and grotesque. We need an all out campaign against this military parade. You may think it's harmless my friend, but I guarantee it is a very dangerous psychological devious ploy that will glorify Trump and elevate him to more power. Heads up people!
@joys_alexandra Trump was counting on our military to side with him when the Russian Coup began. It's making a lot more sense, how the military has stayed quiet in this War of minds.
@elonmusk Way to go! So inspiring and exciting, thanks guys! :-)
@Amy_Siskind Straight out of the Fascist Regime Propaganda Handbook. Hitler loved ranting, rousing speeches followed by military parades. So does NK's Kim Jong Un (?) Oh Geez, how low can he go? This rabbit hole is actually a huge primordial black hole.
@LCNM99 Opiates in general don't kill unless it's suicide or patient negligence. Fentanyl is dangerous. Trump and Ryan are just killing off sick and disabled people who live in severe pain, they die in cruel inexcusable agony. This is brutal murder by Hitler wannabes.

@gayleasher1 Yes. That's the next move for a fascist dictator that feels the controlling illusions slipping away. The law of the political jungle requires a trumped up excuse, like terrorism  (Hitler's reason), then martial law is quickly declared and backed by Congress. Ask any dictator.
@Sonya Thank you for our discussion. I confirmed your point that Hitler rose to power in a Parliamentary Democracy government through the Socialist Party. Once elected, he quickly declared martial law, making Germany a Fascist Dictatorship. https://t.co/KCi9GLW6uQ
@SonyaSone7 @duman8332 @dabeard I'm not a Democrat, I am independent and conservative when it comes to our Federal government.

@SonyaSone7 @duman8332 @dabeard Hi Sonya, I appreciate the documentation. I rely on the "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" as my Hitler "go to bible."

@daniellampke @paulkrugman It may not fall into the category of "probative". If it did we wouldn't be having an investigation, right? But the direct correlations and other intelligence warrants a thorough and complete investigation into every bit of outside election interference. This is a Democracy.
@daniellampke @paulkrugman Election interference by Russia has already been found, according to reports in the news, on Facebook and Twitter. So the question remains and must be answered, considering one candidate's close financial and other ties to Russia, who caused this interference and why?
@daniellampke @paulkrugman That is what the investigation will show. It's also why Trump throws up blockades to impede it's progress. Like the oh so secret memo, and calling for a 4th investigation into Hillary. Take an unbiased look and follow the money.

@realDonaldTrump @GOP I believed. If you want media and people everywhere to show your presidency respect, you'll need to show them a man who respects others. Being president won't get you respect. Respect democracy and the nation you serve will respect you.

There's a coup in Washington, engineered by a foreign country executed unaware by Republican Party. There won't be anything left to recoup by November. They'll call martial law before investigation headed by Mueller sees completion. Is the border wall to keep them out or us in?
@ArvanGannon @marklevinshow MAGA Amy: Please share your source of information with us. I'm sure others will want to know this stuff too.
I've been looking to Mr Mueller with hope and faith that he'll find the Truth on behalf of our country. After reading the news today it dawned on me the magnitude of the job he's tasked with executing. I find myself in awe so with deep respect I want to say "Thank you" Mr Mueller
Missing texts might have FBI referring to Trump as an "idiot" or "loathsome human being". Concern exists from somebody somewhere on planet earth that they're prejudiced against Trump (or they're not visually impaired).

@GOP @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse STOP THE LIES!
@FaceTheNation Ryan and Face the Nation:  The American people demand the right to address DACA and CHIP separetely from border wall and security funding. It's immoral to blackmail your fellow Americans with human beings' lives. Address issues separately, otherwise it's immoral.

@vvega1008 The majority of Americans voted for Hillary Clinton to be our president, in case you Republicans forgot it.
@funder It's the fault of Republicans for "dancing with the devil". They failed to clean house and instead rode the money wagon from Russia with Trump. They've abdicated from all human and American decency.

@ID_Resistance @maddow @GOP @realDonaldTrump The thing is they know. They just don't care.  America was raped by the GOP, Trump, and Putin., while stealing our tax dollars. The most horrible part is what Trump did to our children right before Christmas. Paul Ryan wants them to die.
@realDonaldTrump No matter how many times or how many ways you say it, that boat just don't float anymore Trump. You're the worst trash that ever blew into Washington and the Whitehouse. You will answer to the American Majority of people for your crimes.
@AHamiltonSpirit Revelation wasn't fulfilled with Hitler and World War II. Bible Christians recognized the sign of the times. What the Republicans did was a version of Cheney's economic policy failure, but much worse. Our economy WILL COLLAPSE again, your gold and silver worthless like YOU.
@sarahkendzior If the red line isn't drawn dramatically, emphatically and with absolute certainty, our Democracy will from henceforth be a Fascist Oligarchy. You know, just like Russia.
The GRINCH is Orange!
The news said a little boy called 911 reporting the Grinch stole Christmas. So police had the boy "arrest and lock him up." But the Grinch is innocent! It was Republican Whores and Sugar Daddy Trump who stole Christmas. Pssst...he grabbed Mrs. Claus by her "private parts" too.:-(
@SpeakerRyan  The only welfare problem America has is CORPORATE WELFARE that you just increased beyond belief. If you're referring to Americans' Social  Security as "entitlements", you aren't just lying you're a thief. Give me back my money you've stolen for 40 yrs with interest.
@tiffinjames Yes, it's been the general plan for the last 60 - 70 years. But it's different this time, it's about the very fabric of our Democracy Republic. Make no mistake about it, this is war. A war waged in the hearts and minds. Are we willing to become a Fascist Dictatorship?
@NBCNews @SavannahGuthrie @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP Maybe all Republicans should be required to take and pass Micro and Macro Economics before being allowed to run for office. No. I need to face it, they know they're stealing from the poor to give to the rich.

Stop surrounding yourselves with "yes" men, and seek people that will tell you the truth. Your gone! Bye.....
@kylegriffin1 State level is our hope, but make no mistake, Trump has begun building his own policing and "homeland" security forces. First thing CBS said after announcing tax bill passed, before Ryan came on peeing in his pants excited.
On CBS News they said now the tax bill is passed, Trump was moving fast and hard into security and police building. He's thrown out all the petitions. What does this sound like to you???
Senator Paul Ryan appears to worship Satan =&gt; Trump.
