@hottnotthemama @dianakander People my age and younger than my age - when I talk to them about the future - fill me with hope. We just aren't about to settle for the idea that the current course is acceptable.
@HerreraATX @dianakander We have to make sure we do more than involve young people in campaigns. We have to keep them involved once the campaign is over. Local government is in an ideal position to engage young people. For instance, what Mayor @AndyBerke has done in Chattanooga is impressive.
@hallierobinson0 @dianakander Here ya go: A threat to democracy anywhere in America is a threat to democracy everywhere in America.

@SanaaZakariya @dianakander You can still knock on doors! You can register classmates who are old enough! And you can make sure that every voting age person you know gets out this November.
@BarryAycock @dianakander @michelleaycock Go to bed, Barry. Hi, Michelle.
@momjeansboxwine @joshsands @dianakander Right on.
@colinmanning76 @dianakander First, we talked about whether he is going to be so good at math he can figure out how to move the family to Jupiter. I said sure, but what will we do there? He said you could be mayor of jupiter i'll definitely vote for you and I think mommy probably will too.
@KenleyC2319 @dianakander My go-to bbq order. I like them chopped and drowned in delicious sauce. Bread is optional.
@kenkincc @dianakander I'm not. I'm a hopeful romantic.
@momjeansboxwine @dianakander Knock on the peoples' doors. Let's focus on what we can do, not what we need to overcome. With all the noise voters are hearing and seeing, that conversation you have with them on their door step is the most likely thing to break through and be remembered come election day.
@okaytrip @dianakander She hurt her shoulder a bit and I'm trying to convince her to ease up on the handstands. It's a daily debate.
@NKrone @dianakander Thanks for the heads up. I generally avoid those signs because I figure they're meant for people who are selling something more than good government. Also, I was in the northland just this morning!
@_ablebakercindy @dianakander It sits on the counter. Who has time for these sorts of things?
@Whatever22302 @dianakander So whether it's public or just making all forms of private transportation more accessible and convenient, the goal is to make sure folks can get to work and get home in a timely and affordable manner.
@Whatever22302 @dianakander Make sure we're utilizing roads, bridges, buses, the streetcar, bikes, sidewalks, newer forms of transportation like scooters, and anything else that can make our city more navigable. Connectivity is the key. It's an equity issue.
@BrianKeppy @dianakander Most important is to engage the public from the start, listen, make a decision, and then lay out the reasoning behind it. As long as you're honest all the way through, you're doing it right.
@pdubinkc @dianakander Huge project for the city that will have an impact for decades. We need to do everything possible to ensure it gets done right and KCians are treated fairly during the process. Gotta make sure workers are paid a fair wage and folks across the city are included in the project.
@evil_dallas @dianakander I see bridging the digital divide as a priority. Doing it right is going to mean involving everyone. KC has been a leader in Smart City technology, and we need to keep the pedal down. It helps with accessibility, convenience, and safety.
@jtwd77 @dianakander I've already knocked in the near vicinity some - and I'm sure I'll be back. Have to make sure to hit every part of the city.

@blahzayskippy @dianakander Pitch - it was a network drama that imagined what it will be like for the first female major league pitcher.
@Tannerhesso @dianakander Young people in Kansas City are already getting seriously engaged. It's exciting. They want our town to be a place where the next generation can find success without necessarily having to move. And they believe in equity and justice. It's about including them in a purposeful way.

If we can fix that, our city will be safer for it. 6/6
It‚Äôs important for everyone in public office to remember that crime doesn‚Äôt just start out of nowhere. In many cases, challenged schools and a difficult job market in high-poverty areas at an early age are what make individuals turn to crime later in life. 5/x
More lighting and cameras in high-crime areas should be deployed ‚Äì some of which can be done in conjunction with the already planned expansion of the Smart City program. 4/x
Gun violence obviously is a problem that needs to be addressed, and while the state and federal government keep making it harder, we need to look for solutions locally. We can start by increasing ShotSpotter technology in more neighborhoods across the city. 3/x
Police officers should have an even greater opportunity to know the communities they are protecting just like those communities should know who is protecting them. Building that trust will go a long way in making our city safer. 2/x
While murder rates across the country are going down, we haven‚Äôt seen as much consistent progress in Kansas City. We should further enhance our focus on community policing. 1/x https://t.co/oUmIpBlktw

Around 43% of KC residents live in a rental property and we have about 65k rental units. Everyone that lives in one deserves a safe and healthy place to live. I believe this proposal is a good start to get there. (end)
As a first next step, the council needs to ensure that no fees related to inspections are passed on to tenants, especially if they‚Äôre lumped in with a security deposit, because that could price people out of housing.
The city needs to be pushed on the issue, so I‚Äôm glad it made it to the ballot. We need to focus on the rights of tenants just as much as we have landlords. This will be a good first step that should force more action.

20. But it won‚Äôt leave you cynical because these are my stories and they haven‚Äôt left me cynical. They‚Äôve left me hopeful and optimistic - and I believe ‚ÄúOutside The Wire‚Äù will do the same for you.
17. The real star of the book is my wife Diana. Her wisdom is detailed throughout.		18. Ex-lax, exit polls and why all failure is now public failure. 		19. A raw, real, and candid take on a life in public service - warts and all.
15.The ugly, behind the scenes truth about gerrymandering and ‚ÄúThe Party of Green Dots.‚Äù		16. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sanitize a single word of what you wrote about coming home from Afghanistan. It‚Äôs important for people to hear that.‚Äù (What a fellow soldier told me after reading my final draft.)
12. My take on yellow ribbon ‚Äúsupport our troops‚Äù car magnets and the politicians who personify them.		13. ‚ÄúShalom Y‚Äôall.‚Äù		14. A Patrick Swayze movie about a Missouri country western bar as allegory for the time I called out Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a racist.
10. My argument that ‚Äúprofessional politics‚Äù is about defending decisions, not about making decisions. 		11. The tale of two lobbyists representing the far religious right: the one who stopped speaking to me and the one who worked alongside me.
8. Thorough analysis of the ‚Äúhurrumph‚Äù scene from Blazing Saddles.		9. A trade mission to China that ended with the Governor of Missouri saying, ‚ÄúJason, you look like a hobo.‚Äù
6. My run in with a superior officer and why it prompted the Director of Intelligence for US forces in Afghanistan to change my name to, ‚ÄúEnsign Chinstrap Kandahar III‚Äù		7. The two times I stole something and how it taught me the secret to adulthood.
4. The ‚ÄúTaco Bell Rewards System.‚Äù		5. That time the Afghan Attorney General said to me, ‚ÄúThis man sitting next to me has been directly involved in several plots to kill me, but thankfully he is totally incompetent.‚Äù
3. The scariest politician I‚Äôve ever met. (‚Äú... if Zahir was unhappy with this conversation, we were going to find ourselves dead. Or kidnapped, then dead.‚Äù)
2. The snake, the power outage in the state Capitol, and what both taught me about pushing out the noise.
20 anecdotes/passages/rants from ‚ÄúOutside The Wire‚Äù that‚Äôll make it unlike any political book you‚Äôve ever read:		1. The heckler who changed my mind.

We‚Äôre a grassroots team that relies on small donations so we can keep working to stop vote suppressors. If you think this nonsense in New Hampshire should be stopped, pitch in a few bucks to @LetAmericaVote. https://t.co/53yC4H0MPx
I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to let Republicans blatantly suppress the vote in New Hampshire or anywhere else in the country. @LetAmericaVote is on the ground RIGHT NOW talking to voters so we can hold NH politicians accountable this fall.
But these despicable actions tell us a lot about voter suppression today: Republicans will go to absurd, shameless lengths to limit the right to vote. When the electorate doesn‚Äôt like their policies, Republicans‚Äô instinct is to change the electorate, not the policies.
This is all far from over, and the NH Supreme Court will review whether the voter database should be provided to the @NHDems and the League of Women Voters in their challenge to SB 3.
Are you shocked that New Hampshire Republicans would rig the system just so they can win this lawsuit and continue suppressing voters? I‚Äôm not.
That pretty much says it all. Rather than defending SB 3 on its merits, NH Republicans are rewriting the rules to make it and other voter suppression laws harder to challenge.
BUT, NH‚Äôs Attorney General has refused to comply with that simple and fair request ‚Äî and actually helped Republicans in the legislature draft a bill blocking the state from disclosing info from the voter database in response to a subpoena or discovery request.
To make their case, @NHDems and the LWV are seeking access to the state‚Äôs voter registration database. Information in the database, they believe, could be analyzed to show who is actually hurt by the law.
But wait, there‚Äôs more: After SB 3 passed last year, @NHDems &amp; the League of Women Voters sued, calling the law unconstitutional and demanding it be invalidated. That lawsuit is ongoing.
Republicans say NH needs SB 3 to fight voter fraud, but an exhaustive investigation by the attorney general‚Äôs office found no widespread fraud in the state. Given that data, it‚Äôs clear this law only serves to keep some eligible Granite Staters from voting.
Why does the GOP want to make it harder for people to vote? Because in 2016, they lost a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire by about 1,000 votes &amp; Trump lost the state in the presidential race. Suppressing voters gives Republicans a better chance at winning statewide elections.
SB 3 requires new documentation for people who register within 30 days of an election -- documentation that can often be difficult for students, low-income folks and new residents to get their hands on.
Where it started: NH Republicans passed SB 3 last year, an overly bureaucratic and unnecessary law aimed solely at making it harder for eligible voters to cast a ballot.
Let me tell you a story about the great lengths Republicans will go to in order to block access to the ballot box. All of this is unfolding right now in New Hampshire. #NHpolitics
