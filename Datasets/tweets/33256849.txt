But the photo uncovered must not be ignored. It is hurtful and inexcusable. While we do not believe that this is the man that Ralph Northam is today, this racist photo from his past has gravely shaken the faith that so many Virginians have placed in him.
“As governor, Ralph fully committed his administration to addressing Virginia’s gun violence epidemic — including the day-to-day shootings in communities most directly impacted by gun violence. We appreciate the work he has done to bring this issue into the mainstream in Virginia
We can say with confidence that throughout our years working with Ralph as state senator, lieutenant governor, &amp; governor, we have never witnessed him express any racist or bigoted views. But that does not excuse the photo that we all saw late yesterday.		https://t.co/7WBi8ZqeUb

On this #InternationalDisabilityDay, our thoughts are with the millions of Americans living with the physical and emotional wounds of #gunviolence. 		You are not forgotten
You have not repudiated Mr. LaPierre's unwarranted attack. Therefore, I resign as a Life Member of @NRA., said resignation to be effective upon your receipt of this letter. Please remove my name from your membership list. 		Sincerely, 	#GeorgeHerbertWalkerBush 		#Remembering41
It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.		#Remembering41
However, your broadside against Federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor; and it offends my concept of service to country.		#remebering41
I am a gun owner and an avid hunter. Over the years I have agreed with most of N.R.A.'s objectives, particularly your educational and training efforts, and your fundamental stance in favor of owning guns.		#Remembering41
They both now serve in the current administration. They both have badges. Neither of them would ever give the government's "go ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder law abiding citizens." (Your words)		#Remembering41
The same is true for the F.B.I.'s able Director Louis Freeh. I appointed Mr. Freeh to the Federal Bench. His integrity and honor are beyond question.		Both John Magaw and Judge Freeh were in office when I was President.  		#Remembering41
John Magaw, who used to head the U.S.S.S. and now heads A.T.F., is one of the most principled, decent men I have ever known. He would be the last to condone the kind of illegal behavior your ugly letter charges. 		#Remembering41
In 1993, I attended the wake for A.T.F. agent Steve Willis, another dedicated officer who did his duty. I can assure you that this honorable man, killed by weird cultists, was no Nazi.		#Remembering41
Al Whicher, who served on my [ United States Secret Service ] detail when I was Vice President and President, was killed in Oklahoma City. He was no Nazi. He was a kind man, a loving parent, a man dedicated to serving his country -- and serve it well he did.		#Remembering41
To attack Secret Service agents or A.T.F. people or any government law enforcement people as "wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms" wanting to "attack law abiding citizens" is a vicious slander on good people.		#Remembering41
May 3, 1995		Dear Mr. Washington,		I was outraged when, even in the wake of the Oklahoma City tragedy, Mr. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of N.R.A., defended his attack on federal agents as "jack-booted thugs." 		#Remembering41

So as we remember this mournful day we also reflect on the greatness America. 		An America that doesn't allow it's children to be massacred by #gunviolence. 		An America that doesn't put children in cages. 		An America that can overcome anything...even during it's darkest days.
We stand by the communities...from the largest city in the nation to it's capital to a small rural hamlet in Pennsylvania. 		It wasn't blue America or red America that was attacked. It wasn't rural or urban. It wasn't coastal elites or the heartland. It was all of America.
Our hearts are with all those families directly affected in the attacks on New York, Washington, and in Pennsylvania. 		We give our greatest thanks to first responders who risked their lives and have lived for years with health effects from that heroism.
17 years ago, the nation bonded together on its darkest day. We came together as one America -- a nation standing together against evil. 		Today, our greatest threat is internal. We are divided -- in our politics, our cultures, even in our definition of the truth.
