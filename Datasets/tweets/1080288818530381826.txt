I don't like thrusting right away...I'll rub my lead under your hood for a while...I like the friction...the heat.
I want your passionflower.
Then I'm going to keep kissing you...down...down...down...your body
I'm going to bite your neck. It'll be soft and sharp. My lips will slide over your skin while you feel my canines dig in.
I just want to see those eyes roll back.
Want a dick pic?
My spear never misses.
Come on lightning.
I want to smell and feel you so bad.
God damn it all.
Why am I starting to get hard from this?
I'm going to wreck you.
Fuck you
You're an idiot.
I hate you
Don't you know I love you?
Stop being a bitch and come be a bitch.
