Where is 3rd party oversight of elections, process and best practices?  Why cant the republican party hire e.g. (KPMG) or one of the big four accounting firms to perform security audits?  Republicans will continue to lose in close races until this problem is rectified
Why offer a check box requiring US Citizenship on voter registration, if  we cannot verify actual citizenship or legal residency of the  individual submitting a mail in ballot?  Don't non residents rent apartments and receive mail?

7) If Hand marking ballots to make up the difference takes too much time, since they are printed in real time&gt; you could print a completed ballot!  Hey its just software..
5a) Even if the machines were linked by cell modem, printing "on the fly" is problematic. 		The Actual ballot without a signature-only on the envelope (despite validation of signature) is problematic
6) Delay in counting would allow fraud to enter the system..  The US Government Election Officials need a careful review of the irregularities in Maricopa County.		KFYI i@JamesTHarris&gt;One batch of 20,00 ballots pro Sinema (Flipped Race) were inconsistent with voting trends. What?
5) All you would need is a rogue voting machine connected to a batch printer, if the election official was correct about the machines being stand alone. Regardless printing ballots in real time.. is a problem.
4) My contention, It would be relatively easy to print duplicates, throw out the originals and hand mark new ballots, then match with signature on the envelope.. since there is no way to write on the ballot itself (signature should be matching, one with envelope-one on ballot)
3) For the Mail In Ballot (Green Envelope)  A signature of the voter is required (On the outside of the envelope) the ballot itself has no place for a valid signature (possible fraud?) While the ballot has the name of the voter (Duplicates could be Possible!)
Some ballot facts in Arizona 	1) The machines are not actively networked at polls (Per Official) however they have a database which matches ID with the voter/ verify address (Scan Drivers License)	2) Each Ballot is printed in real time. ( you have to wait) inefficient!
