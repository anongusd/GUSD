@GizaDog @DavidWohl You don’t have to worry about 18 U.S. Code § 2381 as it would  only apply to you if you owe allegiance to the United States of America.		It would not apply to Russian bots as I imagine your allegiance lies with 🇷🇺.
@AOC You, all the WOMEN serving in congress (except the ones inclined to commit treason), and all of those unwilling to stand by as TRUMP follows PUTIN’s directives and destroys us from within, are THE BEST!
@samstein I am a Virginian voter and I’d much rather wait till their terms end than have another TREASONOUS REPUBLICAN take over.
@DavidWohl 18 U.S. Code § 2381		“Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of TREASON and shall suffer DEATH...”		TREASON could also be a capital offense!
@GrassrootsSpeak Impeaching someone because they lied about getting head in the White House is plain silly.		Impeaching someone because there is evidence of Treason should not be considered political.

@SJBambasRN @realDonaldTrump I agree with you @SJBambasRN.

@catz16F @VOLSfan3683 @krassenstein @hendrivanwyk13 @PrisonPlanet I wouldn’t approve of someone’s decision to terminate a healthy pregnancy after beginning of the 2nd trimester		Anyone doing something like that is as much a monster as Trump &amp; his supporters who approve of tearing children away from their parents’ arms &amp; locking them in cages
@marcorubio Si el pueblo americano té ofreciera una exención a ti y a otros traidores del partido republicano como tu @marcorubio, lo aceptarías?
@VOLSfan3683 @krassenstein @hendrivanwyk13 @PrisonPlanet Actually no - I just want to point out that there is nothing righteous in making another human being suffer such a horrible death simply because you wanted to “save your soul”.
@marcorubio What part of separation of “church and state” do you not understand? You are such a moron.

@Nick_wolfpack @dbongino THEY WERE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS whose parents’ whereabouts where unknown. The children were kept there until they found their parents!

@jguaido Ten cuidado con Marco Rubio es un traidor que ha vendido a su gente y se mantiene en su puesto gracias a fraudes electorales masivos y mintiéndotele al pueblo. Si lo investigas un poco, no es muy diferente a Maduro. Su apoyo hacia ti va a costarte después si no le tienes cuidado.

There is LITTLE to NO DOUBT that @realdonaldtrump is a domestic enemy. PROCEED ACCORDINGLY or be ready to change titles from SENATOR to TRAITOR! 😡 https://t.co/T02sXnP4dg
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh I find it so peculiar that all of Epstein’s faithful (&amp; former) friends, clients &amp; business associates support Trump. 		It’s almost as if something about EPSTEIN has created this weird BOND amongst them that makes Trump’s survival a matter of life &amp; death for all of them? 🤔🤔🤔

@JJHunt84 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump We call undocumented  immigrants “illegal” because they broke a law that if prosecuted, would get them a misdemeanor conviction.		Can we call @JacobAWohl ‘illegal’ too? Wait... maybe we should call him “CRIMINAL” because he will likely end up in JAIL convicted of a FELONY 😆😆😆
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Why do you call people who cross the border w/o inspection ‘illegals’. Is it because crossing the border w/o inspection is against the law? So why don’t we call TAX CHEATS &amp; TRAITORS like Donald Trump “illegal”? Isn’t cheating on your your taxes &amp; treason AGAINST THE LAW as well?
@realDonaldTrump THEN RESIGN AND TAKE PENCE WITH YOU!!!
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump He can’t resign unless Putin authorizes it. I’m sure he would have quit a long time ago, but there’s still damage trump needs to inflict upon us on behalf of Putin.
@JacobAWohl I wonder if you’ll consider your ‘stunning good looks’ an ASSet or a liability in PRISON? 😆
@AOC Don’t give up @AOC! We are counting on you 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

@bryanbehar @DianneP17192193 Did you know declaration of a national emergency allows the president to bypass the requirement for competitive bidding? 		Trump will use his declaration of a “national emergency “ to syphon funds out of the U.S. treasury and into one of his shell companies or his associates. 😡
@walterowensgrpa @AOC Grandpa - please tell me you aren’t allowed to make important decisions without supervision.
@DianneP17192193 @realDonaldTrump @AOC Or maybe one of Putin’s companies will be awarded projects while on state of emergency. That’s probably how Trump plans to settle whatever debt he owes Putin.
@realDonaldTrump State of emergency allows you to bypass the competitive bidding process so a gov’t project can be awarded without first checking if other vendors/companies can do the same work for less		Mr. President, which of your companies do you plan to hire to build your expensive wall? @AOC

@PornoMarco @AOC @RepJayapal Oh, I’m not naive. I’m sure it’s an arduous process; especially if you have republicans protecting - not their constituents’ best interests- but their bottom line 😡
@libcrusher999 @AOC Not sure what your point is, but okay🙄
@AOC @RepJayapal We must make massive changes.
@AOC I’m inspired! I want to see more lawmakers who look like you ladies. 😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Increasing the budget so 100% of entities designated as “Corporate Giants” are audited by the IRS would generate BILLIONS of dollars worth of revenues without increasing tax rates. @AOC @RashidaTlaib
