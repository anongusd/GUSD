@RBReich Quoting others, who quoted others who quoted anonymous sources.
@realDonaldTrump That's why I listen direct T.
@RealJamesWoods @GOP There he is! I was wondering where u been.
@DietzandWatson This commercial could be viewed as VERY offensive...which is why I had to try #DietzNuts...and I'm in Love.
@AC360 @MaxBoot So what. You agree with everything ur boss tells you? Doubt it. Are you out here talking trash...no...in fact your bitching about everything but that.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson They are getting desperate too T but I see support shrinking. Some of these 2020 contenders are averaging 400-500 comments per Tweet, with @KamalaHarris and @SenGillibrand on the low end 2-300s. @SenBooker and @ewarren are in the 600s and Krazy @SenSanders is in the 800s.
@ambernoelle Roses are red	Violets are blue	Trump won in 2016	And he'll win in 2020 too.		Where do you see me in 10 years?
@TitaniaMcGrath I think you need Chapstick...or did...in ur profile pic.
@sunny @ananavarro Alright Alright....I don't agree with you EVER...but congrats!
@TracyJan @shearm @jeligon @maggieNYT You forgot GROWING GROUP. #blexit #blexitboston #BlexitStreetTEAM #DintheO
@teamtrace Meh...
@gatewaypundit @AnnCoulter @AOC Meh
@JaneMayerNYer @KatyTurNBC A story that gets killed 1 day before the election is suspect anyway. Also who really cares. He paid off a whore. He doesn't pretend to be anything other than what we see everyday. Good enough for me phony.
@chasestrangio @AOC @IlhanMN Awe.
@DiamondandSilk Guuuuurl. You know its true. Not to mention they are searching for a crime. I think I overstated my charitable donations by $100 one year. That's Tax Fraud...and probably 100 other violations...TECHNICALLY right?
@AdamSchiff I cant believe I'm commenting on this paid promotion tweet but when you say "we" you mean YOU. Don't make your problem our problem. Act like this is Russian Collusion. Get it passed.
@ShannonBream Weekend at Nancy's
@SenatorCardin @AprilDRyan Omg what's wrong with you people. You got the list, which means you have the amounts. Distribute those amounts + $250 according to their payroll. Let that shake out. Please lets move on.
@DineshDSouza He shopped her out for sure. She didn't land this.
@BernieSanders You should have added this as a big push to the finish in 2016 but the Princess didn't like to skip turns.
@RepHartzler @RollingStone Last time I saw @RollingStone in the news they had Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover. Props to @AyannaPressley for turning this one down. @TeamMR8.
@JackPosobiec @DineshDSouza My teenaged son is driving me crazy. What are my options. Willing to travel.
@Timodc I agree but first it needs to be proven.
@GlennThrush Love this album. Politics leading up to 2016 were like the hairbands of the 80s....When Trump won he brought us Nirvana.
@SMPAGWU @AprilDRyan Sounds more like a job to me.
@MaddowBlog @chrislhayes The #madcows are a tough crowd. You really have to talk impeachment or they will pee their pants on the spot.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @JesseBWatters @FoxNews @WattersWorld Ill live with out you Laura for one night but please tell me @ShannonBream is still doing her show because Im a #breamer!
@RepThompson Already forgot.
@washingtonpost If Kraft wasn't there this wouldn't be a story.
@melissarfleming @jaketapper Weasel @jaketapper RTs this but pushes there is no emergency. BAD.SICK.PEOPLE
@mkraju @OutFrontCNN That's a no.
@KatrinaNation @jaketapper @jdforward She is gone soon. This is what happens when they push an identity....maybe next time it should be the right person for the job.
@mkraju Poor Mueller. He probably feels like he was set up to fail at this point.
@dcexaminer If they thought they had a chance of winning they wouldn't do this. They know 2020 is over for them. They are the dinos and we are the meteor.
@CarlosLozadaWP Doesn't seem like anyone cares.
@SebGorka Will never happen. R's are spineless.
@ThePlumLineGS @JaneMayerNYer You forgot to add "according to an anonymous source"
@ErinBurnett @Acosta @RepJerryNadler I feel bad you have to keep pushing this nonsense. Oh well. You had ur run. Swipe
@washingtonpost You tell us! Which teams are you talking about.
@guypbenson @benshapiro I can personally say that's cow shit.
@JFNYC1 @SebGorka @Comey Term Limits~!
@SebGorka @TheJuanWilliams I swear Juan did this so I would follow him....it worked...but he is loco with this whackness.
@brianstelter Please...this tweet is the most he is going to do. IF IF IF IF IF
@pkcapitol @StuPolitics Or term limits.
@PhilipRucker @cbrennansports @DavidNakamura Also maybe if women are bothered by this let them speak. They don't need a man to speak for them.
@PhilipRucker @cbrennansports @DavidNakamura Which teams?
@SenatorHassan Well if you guys had the border worked out already he wouldn't need to.
@brandondarby @SebGorka I usually like Juan but he is loco. How can someone have an army of supporters and still lose.
@ChrisVanHollen IF IF IF. All you got is IF
@DebbieLesko @POTUS I like Debbie! She goes hard on what she believes vs going hard on what's popular or sound good messaging.
@SenatorDurbin Oh well....only need 50
@keithboykin They had the blue dress tho.
@samstein @brianstelter Of the 4 scandals...2 are proven.....the blackface guys. Lets start there.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @KatrinaPierson If he can get a virtual army on Twitter its prob pretty safe to say he wont lose.
@SenGillibrand You won on those things?....did you follow through? Are we out of Iraq? Is there M4A in that district.....SWAMP
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED That's funny. Thank you for speaking for me. Why don't you give me some stats?
@keithboykin Eventually? You must really think people are stupid. Good luck at Easter finding the #collusionegg
@RealCandaceO You and @therealroseanne are in my top 5 favorite women....my wife is number 1 of course and you &amp; Rosie are in a 4 way tie with @DiamondandSilk! #blexit #blexitboston #BlexitStreetTEAM #DintheO
@gtconway3d @NicolleDWallace If you think things like this...or a check to a whore....or the Emergency at Border puts him at a disadvantage with his bosses (us) you are waaaay off lovey.
@brianstelter Since when do u guys need evidence???
@RepHarley U will never see a Democrat with one ounce of the success we are seeing here. That’s what u mean. You can’t beat him so what do u do....u try to take him out like a bitch.
@RepSwalwell Because #swallowell won’t sleep until every child has food water and shelter.
@keithboykin He still has my vote simply based on what he says, not u, Fox or anyone.
@RashidaTlaib Everyone before him sucked too. Imagine how dumb u guys sound. Ur pushing he is a Russian asset that colluded with Russia, won the Whitehouse on his first try while running his business and giving us the greatest economy ever and yet after 2 years...nothing. Sick sick People!
@Iamdevinnsmart I love Candace. She is making big moves! #blexit #blexitboston  #BlexitStreetTEAM #DintheO
@Iamdevinnsmart @realDonaldTrump I second this request. Devinn in the Oval Office! #DintheO
@RepSwalwell U really are sick. I thought when trump said that about u guys it was a little much but u actually look at this as a win.
@dbongino He is a #snorebore
@dbongino And tons of makeup...
@benshapiro One of the best episodes too
@SebGorka @SpeakerPelosi Nancy can’t do anything or she will cry discrimination so everyone has to suffer
@SarahPalinUSA She’s that woman in the office u can’t say anything to or she will cry discrimination so everyone has to suffer thru it.
@DiamondandSilk I’m ready to subpoena u guys cuz I love u!!
@brianstelter Now you just need to figure out how to blame trump.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They are under the #TDSspell big time
@RealJamesWoods Yawn yawn
@kylegriffin1 Yawn. Desperate. Done.
@SebGorka #TDSspell is strong with some of these nuts
@RepMikeQuigley @MorningEdition @HouseIntel 2 year old news.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @MarkWarner Can they prove it
@RealJamesWoods He sounds more intelligent too...with the sound off.
@Iamdevinnsmart We got u D! Open arms!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If
@RepPressley @Ilhan Yada yada yada
@RepAdamSchiff Enjoy wasting ur time and our money
@RashidaTlaib Are u telling us that?
@washingtonpost @hankstuever Unlikely
@dcexaminer @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Its called being VERY desperate.
@rebeccaballhaus @dnvolz When there is no collusion....LOL What a bunch of dummies.
@Iamdevinnsmart @PamKeithFL Devinn, I was accused of being a Russian bot a while back when I didn't have a real name and pic and I immediately put my real pic and added my real name. This #notbot is cheering you on.
@kathygriffin Do u go to a university?
@SebGorka She is whacked
@keithboykin She said impeach
@AOC U have nice skin
@shearm @realDonaldTrump We love it too!
@RealCandaceO @AOC Get em O! #blexit
@WalshFreedom Yes use those sources to “prove it” where are the memos? Fail
@dave_lapointe @hgtv Nothing at all
@Weinsteinlaw @realDonaldTrump Yes...are u related to Harvey?
@RGavinF @dave_lapointe 6 doesn't sound so bad right now.
@SenJeffMerkley Do you guys get a fortune cookie with these sayings on them each morning?
@RGavinF @dave_lapointe We would have an additional finger sewn on for #11. WE would be begging NO MORE!
@kyledcheney Yes its called #fakeoldnews
@AOC Training makes perfect.
@dave_lapointe We would have 10 rings today.
@RealCandaceO @RalphNortham can we get #blexitboston on the books?
@dave_lapointe 2 to go
@RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiff Did you have to #swallowell to get him to agree to add ur name?
@Pittdawg12 @RGavinF @KenJennings https://t.co/agKnTKLmVr.Oooo I love u!
@BrookeBCNN @RandiFurmanCNN I listened and heard for myself. Why do I need to get ur take on it. I think for myself.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Where are the CYA memos?
@ChrisMurphyCT Did you even read it?
@RepAdamSchiff I read that too except there is no memo from Kelly attached and it seems like "4 people briefed on the matter" are the sources...not to mention this is #oldfakenews
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Where is the memo? Who are the 4 people briefed on the matter?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Apparently? Oh you read the same article I did where there is no memo attached and the best source I can find is "4 people briefed on the matter"? Did I read the wrong one?
@KamalaHarris Staged AF
@kylegriffin1 I have always said you guys are desperate when you start talking about Jared and Ivanka. There is no memo attached. All I see is "4 people briefed on the matter".		#oldfakenews
@yashar @chrislhayes @HuntsmanAbby 4 people briefed on the matter? Where are the memos?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It’s not offensive to anyone I kno
@RepBarbaraLee @RashidaTlaib Between you and @SpeakerPelosi you guys prob have a combined total of 100 years working in DC....who should we blame for millions of children living in poverty in the richest nation on earth?
@PattyMurray @EPA #onlyneed50
@KatrinaPierson @keithboykin @AprilDRyan any thoughts?
@AOC @RashidaTlaib I bet neither of u bothered reaching out to the "prop" as you call it....to get her thoughts or feelings about the matter....everyone just spoke for her....what's that called?
@CharlesMBlow Just need to prove it first.
@McFaul @keithboykin Maybe that’s why it was a one sided deal
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump My support time on Twitter is costing me my marriage (lol jk). Just let him know that! #Trump2020.
@DiamondandSilk @RepCummings I gotta go with my girls on this one bro. I gave u mad love earlier too...damn.
@tedlieu A plug is a hell of a way to say thank you.
@JamilSmith @keithboykin After all that...I think about the "prop"....as you call it....and I wonder why no one is asking her what she thinks or feels. Everyone is speaking for her. #BLEXIT
@GOPLeader Tomorrow is #cohenwho? All the bullshit they push and here is a real opportunity in the making they are missing.
@CharlesMBlow Can you prove it wasn't payment for losing a poker game?
@CharlesMBlow Now hang on a cotton pickin minute. Was this before or after the blackface/abortion scandal?
@kaitlancollins This is a good thing. Ill be honest. I love Trump but understand the haters as well. I think the haters saw today as being #desperateAF. Millennial's want to get along str8 up open arms but it was all about the negative shit you all covered 9-5 that was just too overboard.
@KatrinaPierson But they will say he came back with nothing.
@tedlieu @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes he did....but can you prove it wasn't over a game or poker?
@foxnewsalert @BretBaier Finally some real news.
@eorden @Acosta Now that the collusion crap is crap.
@shaunking @RashidaTlaib @AOC @AyannaPressley And they are the front runners for the 3 stooges reboot! Women of color representing.
@brianstelter @vermontgmg I love how you quote some nobody so you don't have to go on record pushing horseshit.
@ananavarro @GOP So its kind of like the democratic leaders in VA.
@AOC Yes can you please read someone else's questions from now on?
@TVietor08 @RashidaTlaib @MarkMeadows Why don't you ask the woman you are talking about. You think you should be speaking for anyone, let alone everyone?
@RepStephenLynch @ChrisCuomo That's old news. We are on to N. Korea.
@jimsciutto How much skin do you have tucked in behind ur neck?
@AbeGreenwald @benshapiro Is this the walking dead?
@SenBlumenthal @RegionalPlan da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal	da nang dick blumenthal
@IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Who is the Asian @SpeakerPelosi behind Trump?
@washingtonpost Which is the trans? The bald guy or the giant woman?
@jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker Even the wonderful Jerry lies.
@DonaldJTrumpJr #TrumpJR you don't need to tell us anything. We have been with u since day 1.
@SebGorka @seanhannity @FoxNews @foxnewsalert @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewspolitics @FoxNewsResearch @foxnewsvideo Whose the Asian @SpeakerPelosi behind Trump?
@swingleft @AyannaPressley Did she come to the wrong hearing?
@mor10 @AOC AKA @SpeakerPelosi wrote her script.
@eilperin @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 Tell them they are not in Kansas anymore.
@AriMelber Alleged means he has no proof right?
@MattWalshBlog @benshapiro Oh ask her about the woman she fired for being sexually assaulted.
@brianstelter Yea for one night only.
@TVNewsHQ @BretBaier Damn with the exception of Madcow fox has it on lockdown.
@BrettschneiderC @washingtonpost If we have to click on it then its not worth reading.
@DavidCornDC I imagine its sore from kicking so much ass since 2016.
@jimsciutto Why would it?
@TWPundit The Botox on the lower lip went foul.
@SebGorka @SalemMediaGrp I ratted someone out in high school....never did that again.
@ErikWemple @damianpaletta Who effing cares. Is this news?
@PattyMurray Its free to keep ur legs closed last time I checked.
@seungminkim @HawleyMO Mo...Rao...SO?
@AOC If college, heath care and a wage was a given would you have still been a bartender or a battery? #iChooseTheHustle
@SenJeffMerkley Great! When is the vote?
@dbongino I don't think Cohen had evidence of anything.
@LaraLeaTrump @IvankaTrump @aoc doesn't realize its waiting tables and struggling that gave her the drive to pull herself up and beat an established democrat for her seat in congress. Why would she ever want to take that feeling away from someone else. #TheHustleIsReal. #workhardplayhard
RT @SenRickScott: Today is National Term Limits Day! In my short time in DC so far, it’s become even clearer that #termlimits are what we n…
@gtconway3d @NicolleDWallace And its highly unlikely anyone cares.
@AdamSchiff What about all the Russians!!!
@DavidLauter @chrislhayes @AOC That's what happens when @SpeakerPelosi grounds you.
@pkcapitol @AOC That's what happens when @SpeakerPelosi tells her to pump her brakes.
@AliVelshi @NicolleDWallace Oh good....maybe take a peek at @RepSwalwell 	(aka #swallowell) and @tedlieu's tweets too.
@RepSwalwell @KatyTurNBC Are you one of the people in congress who had to pay off someone from the slush fund? When do we get to see that list?
@redsteeze @benshapiro Even he knows the race card is permanently expired after @JussieSmollett
@robbystarbuck @benshapiro @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib Maybe the woman should be allowed to speak for herself. Maybe people should be allowed to think for themselves too. We shouldn't need someone to tell us what's racist.
@JakeSherman Imagine that. They can think on their own.
@SenBlumenthal Like lying about being a war hero?
@esglaude @RepCummings He did a great job!
@RepCummings I think you were very fair today and held a respectable hearing. You give me faith my kids wont be treated as racists based on the color of their skin. Thank you.
@jsolomonReports I heard he once lifted a bus with his bare hands to save a bunch of children.
@EricHolder And now your doing it by implying she was an exhibit. Instead of speaking for her and everyone why don't you ask the "black woman" how she feels about it. Maybe you should try being race blind for a day.
@aseitzwald @benshapiro I thought he already was running? Who cares either way.
@SusanPage @kasie Now all you need is the proof. #Trump2020LandSlide
@RashidaTlaib I voted for him in 2016 and I am voting for him in 2020. No Russians were involved in the making of this individual thought process.
@PRINZESKIM @BBCNewsnight #FirstStepAct?
@RashidaTlaib @OversightDems It hit me....still #Trump2020LandSlide
@keithboykin Sure, stop using us for hoaxes. We even?
@SenFeinstein Prove all?
@SenBlumenthal Oh yea....prove it happened that way.
@CharlesMBlow Its gonna be 40% or more in #2020. #BLEXIT
@keithboykin How would he know?
@RashidaTlaib I see a 3 stooges remake in the works! You cant complain either because its diverse women of color playing the lead roles #girlpower #3stooges
@RashidaTlaib You can thank @JussieSmollett for putting the final nail in the race card.. That ish has expired. Nice try.
@kaitlancollins You were dying to leave out that last part I bet.
@keithboykin That's prob the only truth he told.
@RealJamesWoods Jimmy you Rock. I hope someday you get to reprise ur role as the great @RudyGiuliani!
@RealCandaceO @prageru @jonvoight @therealroseanne Awesome!
@PattyMurray How awesome is it we only need 50.
@SenBlumenthal Da Nang Dick Blumenthal using that terrible event to push his agenda.
@IlhanMN I'm sure the 3 geniuses will take it back to Kindergarten...@AOC @AyannaPressley @RepJayapal
@MichaelAvenatti He didn't need to hide it. I still would have voted for him. He can shoot me on 5th ave and I will STILL VOTE #Trump2020
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump I hope the dems have more evidence than this....paying off a whore to keep quiet is it??
@Jim_Jordan Jim you are killing it. I'm defending the hell out of you on Twitter right now against these crazies under the #TDSspell
@PattyMurray As much as I don't believe this same old tired Hillary line...at least you are committed to it.
@keithboykin Then Jordan reads a list of top FBI assholes fired. Which is lower?
@gtconway3d @Lawrence Please tell me this isn't the only proof out there? A whore was paid off....who cares.
@Peter_Wehner @NicolleDWallace I can handle the truth...a whore was paid off to keep quiet...don't care.
@BrookeBCNN Race blind....not color blind.
@keithboykin How many are stupid.
@AprilDRyan @MichaelCohen212 What were you saying about him om 2015/2016?
@keithboykin How do you know they don't?
@KamalaHarris Would you declare a national emergency?
@keithboykin He fooled everyone it looks like.
@realDonaldTrump Amazing Job T. We are with you all the way.
@keithboykin Lets say they are both guilty. Trump will win in 2020....@JussieSmollett might not ever win again.
@keithboykin Now we just need to decide if he is lying or not.
@keithboykin When do we ignore him and when do we listen....with his history being what it is?
@tedlieu I think he testified prior....and is going to jail for lying? No?
@DonaldJTrumpJr We see thru this guy. Keep doing what ur doing and ignore this nonsense. #MAGA
@SenBlumenthal I’m surprised u didn’t go to Vietnam to relive the heroic days.
@PattyMurray Was it Liz Warren
@SenWarren @federalreserve @SunTrust @BBT @RGavinF is this ur merger.
@SenFeinstein @AGBecerra Great! How long have they been there? Years right.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 @MichaelCohen212 I bet u can request a cell with @JussieSmollett. He’s looking for a new friend.
Best.Tweet.Ever https://t.co/XFLzt32WKm
@SenatorDurbin So you want to use a photo op to say a photo op is not a tangible result?
@PattyMurray Only need 50 and OH NO!!!! Its was 51 Yea's
@SymoneDSanders @USCPolFuture @BobShrum Makin a livin off Trump isn't so bad is it?
@GOPChairwoman @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don’t know if he is right or wrong. What I do kno is this should have already been done. It’s like finding out ur city or town doesn’t have a police department. Somethings should be a given.
@RashidaTlaib @sarakitty2372 @_mharb On top of their asks and me impeached? Are u having a stroke?
@RepSwalwell @NRA @GabbyGiffords @SpeakerPelosi I hope u have this woman’s permission to speak on her behalf because this happened to her how many years ago? And now u wanna fix the problem????
@keithboykin Think we are all waiting for more details on this one
@davidhogg111 David go knock on 1600. He will hear u out. Trust me.
@davidhogg111 Welcome to the real world.
@IlhanMN Meh. You guys peaked week 2.
@AOC U held a class on tweeting??? You get a sentence...maybe 2. Not a double decker.
@benshapiro She made their principal look good. What joke. #TermLimits
@RealCandaceO @MarioLopezExtra AC SLAYER!
@PhilipRucker Your the reporter...you tell us...did Trumps language cause this? Shouldn't you get more details from this guy who was gonna do this crazy shit. You know what runs through his head?
@HillaryClinton I'm done paying for abortions babe.
@SenGillibrand I was hypnotized by an X-Rated hypnotist on a stage just like that with a bigger crowd.
@RashidaTlaib @ATT @CWAUnion Ok. Lets get this resolved. I like you are working ur D.
@ShannonBream Get all the abortions you want....don't make me pay for it.
@AOC @GirlsWhoCode See this is the @aoc I love.
@TheOfficerTatum @realDonaldTrump My man! Which inner city? Boston here. Let end this shit once and for all.
@KMCRadio @KamalaHarris @JussieSmollett @am970TheAnswer This cant be real. Can it?
@TWPundit Look, who cares. Different people, different cultures, different religions. She prob looks at us and says "gross u didn't marry ur brother. Lets move on.
I think the #GreenNewDeal is dogshit but to let these poor kids down....DRAIN THE SWAMP https://t.co/SXuffWFEEo
@TVietor08 Oh my God @SenFeinstein. Term limits babe.
@RandPaul No...This man does not represent all sides. Lets call it what it is. This was a hateful man with an agenda and a target. Its ok to say it we just need to reassure everyone that this dummy does not represent anyone we want to associate with.
@DiamondandSilk Ladies....we should also ask her why Mass isn't on the list of states involved in the lawsuit against T.
@LoyolaLawSchool @tedlieu @LevinsonJessica Sounds like a terrible gig. I hope that's str8 Vodka in that carafe.
@VanJones68 @hassanminhaj @RepJoeKennedy @CNN That's like 1/4th a black man between the 2 of them. U aint representing....u aint keepin it real.
@nytimes @CharlesMBlow I hope he testifies on Wednesday so I can say Mike.mike.mike.mike.mike.mike.mike….what day is it.
@MadMom22 @Ezyliving1971 @CharlesMBlow Yup. My wife says this all the time when I try to explain myself.
@MadMom22 @CharlesMBlow Its not that I disagree with what he said. I agree more than u think. But to sign it "Sincerely Black People" made me wonder who is this guy. Its clear he has a solid group of supporters...but all "black people" I don't know.
@StevenDTyson @CharlesMBlow I'm not speaking for anyone. Nor should I.
@Ezyliving1971 @MadMom22 @CharlesMBlow I couldn't agree more. I only asked because he signed the tweet...."sincerely, black people"
@E_Joyce @CharlesMBlow I was only asking because the tweet I was referring to he seemed to sign "Sincerely, Black People".
@SprottThom @CharlesMBlow I was blocked for 12 hours using the "R" word. That's "R"
@y_incognito @TM_305 @GNCordova @CharlesMBlow I simply asked because he put up a tweet and signed it "Sincerely, Black People". That's a lot of people...some I know....most I don't. I don't know this man and was just more curious than anything. Never in my life have I been racist.
@ari2020 @CharlesMBlow This is my fav tweet ever. Its genuine.
@misterbasic @AOC How many has he deleted?
@nicmaaaains @misterbasic @AOC Fair enough....As long as she never calls anyone else out for doing the same.
@MichaelAvenatti Thank u mike!
@keithboykin Maybe he is waiting for the facts? Do u kno everything?
@BrookeBCNN @sarasidnerCNN Good! Got away with it for way too long. Lives ruined. Now it’s his turn to be the girl.
@charliekirk11 Yup all they got is beach friends.
@dcexaminer Add me to the lawsuit cuz I don’t want her here either.
@MarkWarner Don’t u find it embarrassing ur still pushing this?
@CharlesMBlow Noooooooooo. 😫
@chuckwoolery Chuck, you wanna shut her down quick fast ask why MA isn't one of the 16 states involved in the lawsuit.
@PattyMurray He never said when tho. So in 6 years if they haven't paid for it then RT this.
@SenGillibrand I don't like that you are paying for me to see this.
@whyrntulaughing @CharlesMBlow NOOOOOOOO lol
@y_incognito @TM_305 @GNCordova @CharlesMBlow I can barely stand up for myself. I was just wondering.
@ari2020 @CharlesMBlow Alright! Truth!! I was just asking but I know exactly what u mean.
@whyrntulaughing @CharlesMBlow I guess I don't know for sure.
@harriet48252998 @CharlesMBlow Fair enough.
@bowmanlee7777 @CharlesMBlow That's very true but..."All Black People"?
@misterbasic @AOC Exactly
@davidwebbshow @BernieSanders Who the hell wants to own a boat like that anyway.
@LeciaMichelle11 @jmaclove1111 @CharlesMBlow HAHA. I thought that initially.
@rocodeedee @CharlesMBlow That's true. I just asked.
@LeciaMichelle11 @jmaclove1111 @CharlesMBlow Chad?
@IndieRay02 @CharlesMBlow Lol. I get it. I prob should. Been drinking boxed red wine.
@edillades @CharlesMBlow Look how handsome I am. My dimples don't show as much as they used to.
@smokeydalibra @TPDatBLT @CharlesMBlow LOL. I agree but in my defense I only really started using it like 6 months ago.
@jack_smolokoff @CharlesMBlow I used the quotes because it appears he signed the tweet with:		Sincerely	Black People
@Armageddon1906 @CharlesMBlow Never! I hope it didn't come across that way.
@ptpower @CharlesMBlow God no. Although I agree there are a lot out there. It was just a question. I guess I'm trying to have that conversation I hear so much about.
@holybullies @CharlesMBlow I want those teeth.
@jmaclove1111 @LeciaMichelle11 @CharlesMBlow I'm cute tho.
@rocodeedee @CharlesMBlow I don't wanna speak on behalf of anyone.
@AbrahmLPhD @CharlesMBlow I guess it depends on the answer.
@MadMom22 @CharlesMBlow I'm just curious. I wasn't trolling.
@N0_Diggity @CharlesMBlow I loved her in White Chicks
@GNCordova @CharlesMBlow I thought it was a legit question
@neal_katyal Use it wisely.
@CharlesMBlow Do you really believe you have what it takes to speak for all "Black People"?
@davidwebbshow @charliekirk11 @KamalaHarris I was just commenting on another post to have that prick try that in Boston and think he can just walk away without a care.
@memetwalker I'm not just some guy. I have amazing ideas that I mail to myself and never open so if someone tries to steal my ideas I have it time stamped by the post office AKA the feds.
@AOC I thought the plan was to make sure the details are solid BEFORE you tweet???
@memetwalker When you do come back please don't instablock me or file a restraining order.
@memetwalker @memetwalker, Im not gonna make it until March 10th. We can Tweet all we want. We just have to go to the gym too. I think about us sometimes on the treadmill high fiving each other. I'm gonna keep checking in lovey.
@GMA @AyannaPressley I supported the glasses DAYS before everyone. You need to see her with her hair down.
@MattWalshBlog @benshapiro @AOC BOOOOOOM
@AOC I do notice a lot more bots lately. @tedlieu @AyannaPressley @IlhanMN &amp; @RepJayapal are a few I can name off the top of my head.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They walk out like they just smoked a fatty.
@jamieleecurtis I feel betrayed. I shouldn't be assumed as a racist because of the color of my skin or hat.
@MrAndyNgo @greggutfeld Greg just ignores me.
@jaketapper I'm sure there is a story here but ur botching the fuck out of it.
@RepPressley Are those lyrics from a Whitney Houston song?
@SenBlumenthal Its like saving a life in Vietnam.
@thehill Does he have an earring?
@SenWhitehouse @senatemajldr There are people here today who are literally shitting on the streets. The world has already ended for them.
@ananavarro @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome Did he tell you to add the freshman 15 to ur profile pic?
@ewarren @TheKingCenter @BerniceKing Did she ask you why MA isn't on the list of 16 states suing Trump?
@bradleydevlin In other words no one should ever "think differently" at Berkeley.
@charlesspires @SHODesusAndMero @Showtime @AOC @JussieSmollett These guys are jacked just like the guys he hired. Only difference is their isn't a pic with their shirts off so I had to ask.
@matthewjdowd @BrianKarem Can you break down the 50 &amp; 21000 into how many were "reported" and how many were "proven"
@CharlesMBlow What "Black people" are you talking to? People aren't that weak...no matter what color. Now...if you are really sending a message to ur peers in reporting please don't use everyday people. Trust me....no one is looking up to u guys or the politicians.
@KamalaHarris In other words this means working at the RMV with a daycare established by the lowest bidder while you encourage paid family leave so people have more kids than they can afford so they quit the DMV job and collect a guv'mnt check so the next poor sap can enter the cycle.
@AsteadWesley @PhilipRucker @KamalaHarris looks like their probation officer. You aint a sistah.
@thedailybeast @maggieNYT @samstein @JFKucinich @scottbix Show me what stolen data looks like and then explain why you haven't reported it.
@dcexaminer @TheDemocrats You already posted this and I commented. Someone needs to be replaced in marketing.
@CharlesMBlow You must be drinking boxed red wine like I am cuz you sound batshit crazy with that nonsense.
@JaySekulow I have said this before. There is a whole herd of 70something+ hardcore Catholics out there who will vote for Trump based on these crazy abortion laws alone. My mom is one of them. She loves LIFE more than she dislikes @realDonaldTrump.
@IngrahamAngle @davidmackau When you are almost a dinosaur you do what you gotta do to stay relevant.
@bennyjohnson @bradleydevlin Let that prick come to Boston and try knocking someone out and think he can just walk away.
@Fahrenthold @NicolleDWallace @realDonaldTrump So is he making money or losing money as @potus. You have to pick one.
So @JussieSmollett is finished. What he did was just so over the top. With that said I hope at the very least someone is making sure he is safe bc this IS the "sign".
@RealJamesWoods I know I read a tweet of urs where u said he could cause self harm and I have actually been saying it for a couple days now. Even tho he is a POS for this someone should watch him so he stays safe. He is unravelling.
@yashar @maggieNYT This is going to move into a very bad place. Someone should watch him and make sure he is safe.
@PattyMurray Patty if u had a brain you would just let it go and then when a dem is president you can ban guns &amp; burgers. Or do you not really care about those things?
@Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer Check out the threads. They have better clothes than my kids. I'm illegally entering Mexico for a better life.
@McAllisterDen We have to give him credit. He sure can #swallowell.
@dcexaminer @JussieSmollet We miss u @therealroseanne. Not fair.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Is @HowardKurtz a #breamer? That's what I wanna know.	#breamers!!
@HobackSara @SenBlumenthal I think they are 2 very different but equally wrong lies....the point is Trump isn't pretending to be something he is not.
@dcexaminer Is that an Antipasto salad?
@Casey_Clemmons @SenGillibrand Until she throws a stapler at ur head.
@RepThompson @JoaquinCastrotx Yea good luck with being on the wrong side of history.
@bradleydevlin @benshapiro We are with you Hayden! I don't even know what you were trying to promote or if I would even agree with it but that prick needs a reality check.
@MartinHeinrich What are you doing to help? You have an electric car? Refill the same water bottle?
@RealJamesWoods @KatrinaPierson He saw his passion and moral clarity after 2 min but cant find Collusion between @realDonaldTrump and those pesky Russians after 2 years.
@RealOmarNavarro I remember commenting on that. I knew something was up when she didn't go bat shit crazy about it.
@chrislhayes If this dummy did what he did because of what someone said on TV he has bigger problems. Trump won. Ur fake news...time to move on.
@RealCandaceO @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris People of color, white in this case, should not be made to feel racist because of the color of their skin or hat.
@KamalaHarris Its nice to know you would immediately find a person of my color guilty right away.
@tedlieu @McCreadyForNC @GOP @MarkHarrisNC9 And @JussieSmollett shouldn't be allowed back on TV.
@KamalaHarris I bet waaaay more than 1/2 cant come up with $100k to bail themselves out of jail after staging a hate crime.
@AOC Ive been bashing you (where appropriate) and im not getting a dime. WTF Mitch!
@keithboykin Agreed....Its like if ur an actor and stage a hate crime you shouldn't be allowed on television anymore.
@BrookeBCNN His twin should file a lawsuit against him.
@SenBlumenthal You should have called ur Nam buddies. I'm sure with the lives you saved they would be willing to contribute.
@dcexaminer @TheDemocrats Wow they speak on behalf of black people? This is how Merry Christmas got canned...someone decided they knew how other people felt.
@ewarren So why isn't MA on the list suing?
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan just needs to stop speaking.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump LOL Brian....You are afraid that race card is permanently gone brah.
@VanJones68 Its a set back for people that like to USE race, homophobia.
@CharlesMBlow I actually agree.
@PattyMurray We didn't miss it. You keep saying it. Who set the dangerous precedent???? Trump or @JussieSmollett
@BritniDWrites I agree. They are wasting their time on this pathetic individual.
@Mzhy_99 @CharlesMBlow Yes...I sound crazy.
RT @Invest420: Seaport Global Rolls Out Cannabis Coverage and Sees Global Market at $630 Billion https://t.co/DuDDqWiRvt #cannabis $CGC $WE…
@washingtonpost Yes we want to see in bold print....THERE WAS NO COLLUSION!!!
@marty_walsh Your the man Marty!
@washingtonpost And what we have always known...No Collusion.
@politico @KellyannePolls Its the only thing she said that I liked.
@amber_athey He walked up hill both ways too im sure.
@BernieSanders Get financial aid, get a job with insurance and pick up after yourself....problem solved.
@PattyMurray WOW hundreds....how many were paid.
@keithboykin Lets hope...		If you were his friend maybe you should have listened more. You probably went on and on and ON about the expired race card all the time and he probably thought this was a slam dunk of an idea.
@CharlesMBlow 1) Trump was asked about it.	2) The "presidential candidates" jumped on the expired race card on their own.	3) Maybe Trump knew it was a hoax....look at his answer.
@keithboykin You talked more about other crap. Waist of a click.
@CharlesMBlow Oh please. Your mad cuz the race card has expired.
@CharlesMBlow HAHAHA. You are dumb.
Senator @TedCruz has an idea on how to fund President @realDonaldTrump's proposed border wall... Make El Chapo pay for it! Join the fight --&gt; https://t.co/6cKwRpIlzg
@RobElgasABC7 @benshapiro What a dummy. He used a check so he could still write it off somehow. Loser.
@chuckwoolery He realizes there was no collusion.
@chuckwoolery This is why I tell my son not to let anyone ever tell him he is racist just because of the color of his skin.
@SebGorka @JussieSmollett Its sad when I have to tell my kids they are NOT racist based on the color of their skin.
@ewarren @BrianKarem Hey Liz, why isn't Mass on the list of states suing Trump for the emergency he declared?
@kylegriffin1 Buzzfeed???
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The race card has expired for good. That's why.
@NewDay @SenBlumenthal Maybe Barr will address the identity theft this guy committed claiming he was a Vietnam Hero!!
@ananavarro Who cares. Was this guy offended? Is he a baby. Suck it up.
@PattyMurray I think you keep posting the same thing over and over and over.
@dcexaminer Because Hillary lost...that's why.
@KamalaHarris Lets find out if @JussieSmollett is gonna be one of those people who has $ to pay his way out of this. I bet he does.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson While I still don't really like u @MichaelAvenatti you have shown a teeny tiny genuine side of urself I respect so maybe @TuckerCarlson saw that too and will at least agree to drop the previous nickname (CPL) he gave u and have a genuine debate.
@JohnCornyn When I walk into a movie theater I feel like I should see promo sized posters of @SenFeinstein and @LeaderHoyer with thick black text reading across the bottom #TermLimits
@vermontgmg U need a hobby bro. And that's without me reading it.
@KamalaHarris Thanks for telling us what we need.
@brianschatz Take a look at the bigger picture. They have 16 states in a lawsuit but Mass isn't one of them? Why @ewarren
@PattyMurray Breakdown:		1) Information that we hear all day.	2) Ignore the sentence with "I"	3) Describe "we will fight back"		Until then what exactly are you trying to say?
@ShannonBream @goodreads Only one with a standing recording on the DVR. 	#breamers
@brianstelter If anyone on that network had balls...real balls, not trans balls.....they would set u and Boink (@keithboykin) up for 15min live cuz @ErinBurnett bitched out. Maybe ur bitching out right now with ur statement. Lets talk brass tacks kid.
@RGavinF I have been telling Katie how u said her name. She is not on here cuz she hates social media....so we can talk shit about her.
@RGavinF I do have bad breath some nights Rob. I know once I asked for gum at darts.
@ChaseHughesNBCS Only if he paid that much attention to the country.
@MaddowBlog @chrislhayes Madcow easing the "blow" (not) for her fierce followers.
@peterwallsten @maggieNYT @WaPoSean Look how he is struggling to ride up that escalator.
@washingtonpost Its all about the ending.
@RepSwalwell @SebGorka That is Crazy. Did you swallow.....that's the real question #swallowell?
@SebGorka He is just looking for something he can #swallowell.
@CuomoPrimeTime @tedlieu Chris when you get a call from  "Ed from Boston" don't rush me off the phone.
@dave_lapointe @RGavinF On a side note dave….Does Wayfair check out twitter etc when people apply for a job?
@RGavinF @dave_lapointe Dave, just so u know Rob ordered a pizza "to go" "for here" last night. How many dolphins have to die Rob? How many?
@maggieNYT Does it matter?
@keithboykin Bullshit. Also @ErinBurnett was a total cold fish of a reporter. Both of u are a joke.
@ewarren #antisoundgood
@DeadlineDominic @brianstelter Not in Trumps America....you are guilty immediately....isn't that how it goes now?
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Where is the outrage.
@AyannaPressley @LaurenUnderwood @RashidaTlaib @AOC I love the hair down and glasses!
@Comey @NicolleDWallace OMG GO AWAY
@brianstelter @AC360 Watching u guys squirm having to report this.
@dave_lapointe Need more like u Dave. Lead by example.
@nowthisnews @AOC @davidhogg111 do you consume?
@allahpundit @benshapiro Time for #blexit! No more.
@SymoneDSanders Yes except this time lets call it #BlexitHistoryMonth. What do you think @RealCandaceO?

@kylegriffin1 Kyle loves Buzzfeed.
@MartinHeinrich Ok whats ur first step? You gonna sacrifice something?
@jaketapper @GovHowardDean @jrpsaki @KSoltisAnderson @chavezlinda @TheLeadCNN Hopefully he has the balls this time around.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro @AdamSchiff Yea Schitt? @RepAdamSchiff
@marty_walsh @CityOfBoston @BostonPWD We love you Marty! Keep up the good work.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What can I do to assist!
@SHODesusAndMero @Showtime @AOC Are those the 2 guys @JussieSmollett hired?
@ambiej @chrislhayes Was about to click then saw buzzfeed.
@SenatorHassan Who the F drinks tap water?
@TomFitton And thank you @w_terrence for not claiming the driver was a white dude wearing a #MAGA hat.
@DonaldJTrumpJr #TDSspell is in full effect.
@RealJamesWoods She just was reelected here and now running for prez. That shouldn't be allowed.
@maggieNYT @HullatHome @ClydeHaberman Way to NOT answer his question.
@wolfblitzer @CNN @realDonaldTrump Wolf is worrying about is ratings.
@jaketapper What a shocker.
@PattyMurray Why now? Why not in 1992 when you got elected? #TermLimits
@SebGorka @AOC A0C
@realDonaldTrump Thank you!!!
@RealJamesWoods @AprilDRyan started this dance a couple months ago.
@ananavarro Insert "any article" here
@RepAdamSchiff Now what do you do?
@RepJoeKennedy No one was murdered slowly in a car by drowning so that's pretty good.
@keithboykin I don't recall him saying Mexicans???
@RealJamesWoods @FOXTV Yup that appears to be the case Jimmy.
@RashidaTlaib Makes no sense.
@DanaPerino @dailybriefing @KarlRove Dana, can u pass along to Catherine Herridge that I think she is a true example of a professional journalist and she will outlast everyone.
@GracieAgraz @cairGLA @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @AOC I was very generous considering...
@jaketapper @maggieNYT @TheLeadCNN If true imagine that. He inquired about something with the AG. So wrong!
@brianstelter @CNNBusiness I genuinely feel sorry for u.
@SenBlumenthal Glad we have a Vietnam hero fighting for us.
@PattyMurray Yaaaaaaaaaaawn
@jaketapper @PamelaBrownCNN @TheLeadCNN Why isn’t MA on the list mr reporter?
@ewarren @AyannaPressley and @ewarren why isn’t mass on the list suing @realDonaldTrump?
@BrianKarem @RandyRainbow Yea no.
@PattyMurray Can we RT that if we believe that should have been a reality in 1992.
@PattyMurray U are an 80s hair band and it’s 1989. U follow?
@tedlieu Meh. Recycled
@PattyMurray Yea we are shocked and appalled!!!
@AOC U gotta pay ur dues. That’s the American way
@PattyMurray Wow 100
@kylegriffin1 I wonder why Mass isn't on the list.
@dbongino Whos blowing her nose in the background.
@SebGorka @AOC Think what you would be doing if you knew the world was gonna end in 12 years.
@SenFeinstein So pay people/orgs to push climate change? Shouldn't we just let them live their last 12 years without school?
@LindseyGrahamSC I'm still waiting for them to change "Wall Street" to "Drone Street"
@KamalaHarris Yea I think Whitney wrote a song about it in the 80s.
@ananavarro Whos hating?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump I'm glad u said this because next time he tells a female reporter to sit down and CNN goes bat shit crazy saying he targets women Im gonna remind them.
@AprilDRyan @JussieSmollett This is an awful story that makes me furious either way...but now I'm at least hoping someone is watching him because if he was this desperate for what ever reason who knows what he could do next...possibly to himself.
@keithboykin It sure does...they are full of shit.
@keithboykin Has any one validated?
@tedlieu @nytimes @MattWhitaker46 @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump Looks like u are gonna need the sources of the story to validate.
@KamalaHarris Yet CA has a border.
@RepHarley @OversightDems Isn't this a weird tweet. "Your Report" reveals this but u need to investigate?
@ananavarro Just saw u on CNN. Think its time to up date ur profile pic.
@chelseahandler I never thought I would find something trump did that I didn't like...until this very moment.
@KamalaHarris It is! Look at @JussieSmollett. Will he get a pass bc he has $.
@brianstelter Well Fox stayed consistent. The rest did it because of the shitstorm of FAKE NEWS they got busted for pushing in the weeks leading up to this.
@redsteeze SO much makeup.
@keithboykin MY 3 BFFS are:		@GovernorVA 	@JussieSmollett 	@MarkHerringVA 		Hoping to add @LGJustinFairfax soon.		What does that do for me?
@KatrinaPierson When you grow up with second place awards and side bar birthday parties ur whole life this is what you do when u don't get ur way anymore.
@PattyMurray Elected in 1992 and in 2019 this is a need??? Do u see why its called draining the swamp. #TermLimits
@brianstelter Good we want to see this brought to justice.
@dave_lapointe @Pittdawg12 @RGavinF Dave together we can bring back the @BlackBerry.
@CharlieDeMar @maggieNYT @cbschicago Did they confiscate their #MAGA hats?
@GovMLG @MartinHeinrich See...this is why we have #batshitcrazies in congress right now because it’s 2019 and we are only now investing in NM’s children!!!!???
@CentristRally18 @RepMaxineWaters @JussieSmollett Maxine? U leaving me hanging?
@celesteharrell @VanJones68 #BlexitHistoryMonth is what that’s called.
@SebGorka @KamalaHarris Cmon guuuurl. I’m talking to the KHarris I heard in that radio interview. At this point even you have to be thinking he is one of her #beachfriends.
@EricTrump @davidwebbshow @Acosta Juggalos agree!
@RepPressley @RepEscobar You have a builder in the White House begging for a challenge from u guys but u just can’t get out from under the #TDSspell. I bet u could get some places built in areas to help. #knockknock1600. He will work with anyone. Trust me.
@RepMaxineWaters I still believe @JussieSmollett and it’s racist ur not standing up more for him. 😴
@BiasedGirl We kno one of her #beachfriends is @JussieSmollett
@karli_bonne @SebGorka I said all along he was one of her #beachfriends.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight @esaagar @zachfriend55 @TomBevanRCP My mom voted for trump because she disliked and didn’t trust @HillaryClinton and then questioned her decision for a while but after the abortion talk and all the batshit crazies coming out she already said she is @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020!
@AC360 @andersoncooper Yea I loved when she said there was no barrier at the border and a couple min later said she has seen CBP agents climbing over her FENCES!!!! #fail360
@BetoORourke I think you were supposed to make them feel really hopeful for the future....
@CoryBooker Cory, the moment of truth is now...if you become prez will u declare a national emergency on guns?
@TheBeatWithAri @SenBlumenthal This guy lied about being in Vietnam. Not just lied but tried to make himself out to be a hero. How the hell do you take him serious.
@IamSteveVander @AOC @NYGovCuomo is mad at her. She just cost him 25000 possible late term abortions.
@IamSteveVander @AOC Steve she just created 25000 jobs...just not in NY.
@IamSteveVander @AOC Steve, I would love to assist anyway I can.
@IamSteveVander @AOC Shes got the good stuff cuz u have to be high to take the #GreenNewDeal seriously.
@IamSteveVander @SenFeinstein &amp; @LeaderHoyer are proof of that. They prob come in everyday and their first order of business is to decide where they are ordering lunch and constantly say things like "well we have never done it that way before"
@IngrahamAngle @ShannonBream #1 #breamer right here!
@RJMills @SebGorka @mschlapp @senatemajldr needs to go.
In a weird way he probably wishes @HillaryClinton won.
@DarrickHamilton @VanJones68 You mean Steel Slat Street.
@WillieNelson @BetoORourke Did you guys smoke weed?
@jakobandresen @Acosta A pain in the ass.
@Pittdawg12 @RGavinF @dave_lapointe Google collects data. I only use Ask Jeeves.
@RGavinF @Pittdawg12 @dave_lapointe "who gives a care" Who says it like that???
@memetwalker I know you see me. I hope we can get thru this social media addiction together. Just reply. Its ok....just put the cursor in the comment field.
@Pittdawg12 @RGavinF @dave_lapointe Whats the difference between commenting and retweeting and how come sometimes my comments link and other times they don't.
@RGavinF @dave_lapointe @Pittdawg12 Is Jen with you?
@dave_lapointe But you are on the east coast.
@marty_walsh Can I wear a MAGA hat?
@RepPressley Scrolling around and legit said to myself "Love the hair down" Then read ur tweet. Happy Friday!
@maggieNYT Was he one of them? Or did they find 2 chalk white men in MAGA hats carrying bleach at 2 am in the cold?
@kylegriffin1 Trump is the Steve Jobs of America. You are deeply under the #TDSspell.
@davidwbrown @tedlieu Bigger picture tho. Why are we even caught up in the middle of this nonsense. How isn't there already some sort of system in place. Its like realizing one day the city/town you live in doesn't have a fire department because the decision is held up in congress.
Hey @RealCandaceO since most of these fools aren't even talking about #BlackHistoryMonth maybe you could talk a little bit about it and where we are today...#BlexitHistoryMonth? 	#Blexit #BlexitBoston.
@RohdeD @peterbakernyt @sbg1 Yup...and here we come and in the end you get a whole new congress of republicans. Think of a republican @AOC. Is it as easy as u make it look being an editor?
@SebGorka Ann d'un lost her mind....she's acting like a millennial. #Triggered
@notwokieleaks @benshapiro @AOC HAHA Yup!
@PattyMurray I thought u were @SenSchumer's wall for a while...I thought u were security because I remember u sitting there every time he spoke with an expression on ur face that reminded me of my sister in law.
@KamalaHarris Wait?? '''Does not compute'''…..are you giving props right now?
@cairGLA @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN I think you (@IlhanMN) are gonna be bigger than @AOC. That's my VDAY present to you. 02/14/2019
@cairGLA @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Yes MN is really getting their votes worth by her coming to CA.
@ewarren Its killing me to comment on a post you paid for me to see but can u do ur real job and get Amazon to come to Boston….
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ill call Bullshit.		1) Still have 300k illegal crossing (WE KNOW OF)	2) When technology is updated at legal ports the cartel isn't going back to school. They are going right the left into the US.	3) 10%-20% is a good return on an investment not a decline in crime. We want 100%
@RepDLesko That's because you are not part of the swamp. Stay true and if you get voted out its better than becoming the next @SenFeinstein
@neeratanden Ted had to photo bomb that shit.
@JRubinBlogger Which one? The DACA party or the Wall Party?
@BillKristol DACA?
@jonathanvswan @maggieNYT Boston is happy to add 25000 jobs, employees spend and state gets sales tax. Then already established businesses have more sales. Uber Drivers make more $. I can go on and on. What a loss to NY.
@LeaderHoyer @POTUS I was at the airport last week and I can attest there is no crisis or emergency and suggest we stop screening people who are travelling.
@TeraceGarnier It is odd hearing a pet cough lol but I only asked if you had cats because just like cats get hairballs dogs will get hairballs FROM cat hair. Glad you figured out what was causing it!!
@STEPHMHAMILL @trish_regan @FoxBusiness My wife just heard me say "look at those legs" under my breath.
@davidwbrown @tedlieu I would have agreed with u if he didn't exhaust all efforts first. He now has MANY democrats who introduced the fence act back in the day as well as credible CBP agents on record. He tried working with congress but many are under the #TDSspell so that's reason enough for me.
@dcexaminer @TheDemocrats If congress didn't move on gun control after @GabbyGiffords or @SteveScalise you must be high to think they will now.
@TeraceGarnier Hairball...Do you have cats?
@dcexaminer Yea he was outspoken about Vietnam Too
@VanJones68 U think Jussie should get time if reports are true?
@memetwalker When you come back will u tell me?
@memetwalker Its not fair I only just found you and ur on a break.
@memetwalker M, I just started a new program. I joined the gym and for every hour I go to the gym I get an hour of tweeting! Win Win.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He's got the teeth to knock out Mike Tyson.
@IngrahamAngle And in the End....hes just a....#beachfriend
@MrAndyNgo @benshapiro Well we now know who one of Dr Fords Beach Friends is.
@APWestRegion @AP That chick is a dude?
@washingtonpost Possible #beachfriends? Who know what to believe anymore.
@AnandWrites Yes they dodged that job and can keep suckin off the system.
RT @GOPChairwoman: Disgraced Democrat Ralph Northam is STILL holding onto power – and it’s not helping Virginia heal.	 	There have been bip…
@TwitchyTeam @KatrinaPierson This is what happens when you give out second place trophy's and have princess parties for the first 18 years of ur life.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro @AOC What a POS.
@BradThor @KatrinaPierson @JussieSmollett He should go to jail.
@benshapiro Yup &amp; now we know who one of the #beachfriends are.
@KatrinaPierson #officialbeachfriend.
@dandrezner @Acosta Now its congress that's unable to negotiate.
@DiamondandSilk What a good #beachfriend he is.
@KatrinaPierson BEEEEEEEACH FRIEND!
@SenGillibrand You guys really think we look up to you. That's funny.
@TomiLahren #racecardexpired #beachfriend both come to mind.
@IngrahamAngle BEEEEEEEACH FRIEND!!!!
@SaraCarterDC Which one?		Russia? Virginia? Jesse S?
@ElishaKrauss @KatrinaPierson @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Yup. The #racecardexpired.
@benshapiro Fuckin Right! #racecardexpired
@RashidaTlaib That is cute.
@RepGraceMeng @realDonaldTrump Maybe if you were more involved with ur district you wouldn't have just lost 25000 jobs.
@greggutfeld #LocoBeachFriend
@dbongino The lost 25000 potential late term abortions.
@SenMarkey Especially since we only have 12 years left on this rock.
@RobinRoberts @benshapiro @GMA @JussieSmollett How'd that work out.
@RepJoeKennedy I would flee to the nearest country.
@AdamSchiff What did it say about DACA?
@burgessev @BretBaier I guess he could have just walked away from it like every other politician.
@KatrinaPierson LOOOOOOOOOOOOSER!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GMA He should go to jail for this if true.
@marty_walsh Yes we love our legal immigrants.
@PattyMurray I believe he did listen to the people across the country???
@RealJamesWoods Like I said...one of Dr Fords Beach friends.
@AOC So now you have $0 for those 4 things AND are out 25000 jobs.
@SenBlumenthal What are common sense gun laws?
@chrislhayes They will be paying for it now.
@RealJamesWoods Yup!
@KamalaHarris Why don't u add that to ur campaign? You will declare a nat emergency on guns and opioids if you are elected.
@chuckwoolery If they all just focused on their districts and stop working about the next election things would be amazing.
@tedlieu Betty ur husband drives me crazy most days but I'm sure he is a good guy. Happy V Day.
@RealJamesWoods That's possibly 25k late term abortions they lost too. Queermo is gonna be pissed.
@AOC Hope they come to Boston! We would love 25000 new jobs here.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Maybe humans need to act.
@SenGillibrand Oh well. All we need is fifty
@keithboykin Something is just very off about this whole thing. No media outrage, no political outrage and no celebrity outrage.
@clairecmc The end results will speak for itself.
@KamalaHarris Trump could get this done. Have u discussed it with him?
@AyannaPressley HVD!
@AndreaEEvans7 @VanJones68 @CNN I don't even need to read what my man wrote. He loved the #firststepact more than he disliked @realDonaldTrump and that's rare these days.
@PattyMurray I'm still trying to figure you out and so far all I got is you are like that aunt who makes the home made sugar cookies at xmas.
@PattyMurray How did you end up going from sitting behind Chucky stoned faced to full tweeting overnight...
@SenGillibrand I've listened to many black/brown people who want the Wall. They aren't stupid like you hoped.
@fivefifths Being colorblind is insulting...Race blind is more acceptable.
@kimguilfoyle Look at that face....those eyes...that hair!!! Kim looks good too.
@seungminkim @StevenTDennis You just earned ur right to be on Earth!!!
@NolanDMcCaskill @abbydphillip @BetoORourke @SenSchumer Yes BETO demands a 2nd place trophy.
@dcexaminer #ratboytapper is not worth the hour.
@dcexaminer @russell_nm I think its great. Come and get some equal rights.
@CallieCrossley @AyannaPressley Men who ID as women who ID as men are disgusted!
@SethAbramson Eric also has written a piece on how to #swallowell
@MarkWarner Because you are the same old tired politician...Don't need to listen.
@DavidRutz @jaketapper @IlhanMN #ratboytapper likes to hide the cheese.
@JesseBWatters She sounds hot!
@Phil_Mattingly @abbydphillip You left out "proudly" Deployed...
@brianstelter @jaketapper Well played #ratboytapper
@joshscampbell @jaketapper Another #ratboytapper special.
@KateNocera Who?
@DonaldJTrumpJr #ratboytapper at it again....
@RepAdamSchiff Maybe you shouldn't have Fed contractors.
@kylegriffin1 Who is responsible for the first 20?
RT @Invest420: 3 cheers for this #cannabis hero, finally getting important issues into discussion. Nice job @RepPerlmutter https://t.co/b9q…
@justinbaragona @jaketapper He is a RAT! #ratboytapper
@Surabees People who aren't under the #TDSspell realize more than you think.
@marty_walsh Its nice to know we have a day where REAL WOMEN can celebrate.
@RepMaxineWaters Only someone with a Low IQ would tweet the same thing as the headline....or just lazy.
@justicedems @AOC @sunrisemvmt WOW. 80 of them think its to legalize marijuana so they can self medicate from this shit show.
@marklevinshow #ratboytapper is a F'ing weasel.
@JohnLeFevre If I quit drinking I wouldn't be here right now telling you its a terrible idea.
@washingtonpost @byHeatherLong As a small business owner my refund went up by almost 2K.
@thehill BAD BAD BAD. See Color! Its beautiful....but be race blind.
@NRDems @RepJoeNeguse @RepDianaDeGette @RepRaulGrijalva What do you mean? We have 12 years?
@CNNSitRoom @RepSwalwell If it was enough he would be out of office.
@LaraLeaTrump @IvankaTrump Awe! I love you guys!!!
@dcexaminer @GayleKing @RalphNortham That looks like low IQ @RepMaxineWaters from the year 1955.
@PattyMurray Did you guys all copy/paste the same tweet?
@AyannaPressley @MsLiHughes I'm still trying to figure women out.
@dbongino I know some people who were dug in hard to Russia collusion about a year ago....they feel stupid today.
@thehill @KatrinaPierson HAHAHA. She thought the job just required her to hide behind tweets.
@DineshDSouza I think he is one of her Beach Friends!!!
@MedvedSHOW @benshapiro Its so funny how these guys peaked so fast. First we had @RepJayapal who was old news after @aoc pushed her out of the limelight only to be bumped by @IlhanMN for her nonsense. Why....because they haven't done SHIT for the people who elected them.
@DebbieLesko The #GreenNewDeal better legalize marijuana cuz you have to be high to vote yes on that garbage.
@realDonaldTrump Love you T! Thank you for everything.
@TwitchyTeam @KatrinaPierson That's why we call him #ratboytapper.
@KatrinaPierson Dumb &amp; Dumber 3?
@jaketapper That's why we call you  #ratboytapper.
@ChuckLane1 @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump I grew up in Boston. I have many friends/fam who are brown people (as CNN calls them) and they are the biggest Trump supporters. They are not stupid. They know their jobs/wages depend on the wall.
@chuckwoolery @AOC got our attention and then followed up with sidewalk chalk. Now we got @IlhanMN front an center and she is giving us play-doh. At least when @realDonaldTrump got our attention he had some real substance that made sense.
@seanhannity No. Maybe its because I have a brain in my head but Trump doesn't want to use these type of measures (ie executive order/emergency) for something that these guys should have had under control since day 1. He wants to get it right with both parties involved. I just don't get it.
@ChrisRBarron @KatrinaPierson In all fairness she was probably pre-approving tweets by @AOC @IlhanMN @tedlieu @AyannaPressley and the other one who is not important enough to remember. Its a full time job being #mamapelosi.
@kylegriffin1 Lets see how he does without mentioning his wife.
@jaketapper #ratboytapper
@RepJoeNeguse Didn't Obama have a supermajority at one time?
@realDonaldTrump Never doubted you T. Would make me very happy if you come to MA before you leave office in 2024.
@SenateGOP @AOC That's too bad. The FAQ made more sense than anything else.
@SebGorka @jaketapper @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump #ratboytapper has nothing going for him otherwise.
@chevive91 @AOC @AyannaPressley Yet back home in Boston there are legit plenty of people that could use some help from Miss Pressley but that's a politician for you.
@NatashaBertrand Or if someone is mugged or murdered we could just blame the last person seen with the victim. Okay I get it!!!
@mic @angela_rye @kendricklamar @sza @djkhaled @JColeNC You forgot being here illegally.
@itsgabrielleu Love that movie.
@SenStabenow @SenWhitehouse You can apply now. I think its 68
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr @jaketapper #ratboytapper is really a weasel.
@SenGillibrand ...and a wall
@SebGorka @jaketapper Disgrace is inappropriate. He is a weasel. More like a Rat. #ratboytapper
@TitaniaMcGrath We belong together.
@RealJamesWoods Are you there?
@SpeakerPelosi Hard to believe you with the blackface sandwich you have going on in Virginia.
@trish_regan @POTUS If she wasn't f'ing up so bad u wouldn't know she exists cuz she hasn't done $hit for her district.
@BorisEP @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @CNN @Ilhan @RepRashida Jake Tapper is a weasel.
@RealJamesWoods Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
@RepSwalwell @SenatorBurr I feel so cheated. Somehow I was tricked by Russians and the Russian asset himself to vote for him because of Hillary Emails and Facebook ads. I have no brain and no brownie.
@RepHarley Tear DOWN the walls! Maybe Opioids and Guns will pour into Mexico?? Looks like the #GreenNewDeal will pass the senate soon! See that! I just got you re-elected.
@LeaderHoyer The one YOU broke after decades in office. How do you and others like @SenFeinstein wake up everyday and point blame at others for the current state of things. The only good you have done is you brought us @realDonaldTrump! #TermLimitsNow
@kaitlancollins @mkraju okay???
@keithboykin @VP The #racecardexpired Boink. Thank you Virginia Dems. Who knew that's all it would take.
@ananavarro Since the black face sandwich happened in Virginia I notice more tweets like this where you realize the #racecardexpired
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well with the mess in Virginia i'm glad you realize the #racecardexpired.
@keithboykin Keith, this game is over. VIRGINIA!!! You cant use this type of messaging anymore. Hay...you still got the #GreenNewDeal you can push.
@ZerlinaMaxwell Race blind not color blind
@RealOmarNavarro Drain the swamp baby!
@JohnBrennan So they are wasting time and money?
@GovMikeHuckabee Has done ZERO for her district
@davidhogg111 @MichelleObama Why? Because she sounds presidential?
@keithboykin U can't use the race card anymore. The current Reps in VA stamped the expiration date on the race card.
@RepSwalwell Good news!
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Did #mamapelosi approve this?
@AOC What was the result of the investigation?
@SenBlumenthal @RepSwalwell What about impersonating a Vietnam vet?
@KamalaHarris I tell my son all the time he's not racist because of the color of his skin.
@ananavarro What's the law say should happen to the T org?
@KatrinaPierson Her response might be in #mamapelosi's inbox waiting to be approved.
Go B’s! Find out how #NHLBruins legend Patrice Bergeron had to #LiveMutual to get to where he is today: https://t.co/dbffs3rIVZ @MassMutual @PlayersTribune
@RashidaTlaib What are u talking about?
@IlhanMN @MaxRose4NY A #mamapelosi pre approved tweet.
@keithboykin Ur just mad u can't use the #racecard anymore.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I tht u said no $
@OfficeOfMike @SebGorka Slow
@Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer They walked into the wrong rally. They tht it was Beto
@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Our tax dollars at work
@MaddowBlog @maddow Hahahah. What about Bernie.
We can build the wall AND have El Chapo pay for it... @tedcruz's #ELCHAPOAct is how. Stand with Ted Cruz and add your name as a citizen cosponsor: https://t.co/6cKwRpIlzg #TXSen
@LeaderHoyer Whose there 2 years and who's been there 75 years.
@ananavarro Are u signing her yearbook? Can't she just do her job for the district she reps?
@KamalaHarris So do it. I tell my wife all the time "if u stopped talking about it so much and just do it then it would be done"
@RealJamesWoods Didn't bothering watching.
@LeaderHoyer Only because u guys F'd it all up by not getting this done before.
@SymoneDSanders Can't take u guys serious after VA.
@AOC @washingtonpost Weak comeback
@anitakumar01 @POTUS Nope
RT @cbdcakes: Aurora Cannabis Makes First Commercial Export to the United Kingdom https://t.co/efEE2TYnxW #cannabis via @invest420

RT @Invest420: Aurora Cannabis Net Revenue Grows 363% in 2nd Quarter https://t.co/IPtm8NMhSQ #cannabis $ACB $ACB.TO
@washingtonpost Zero work done for her district.
@dcexaminer The issue is she had nothing to back it up. Trump says controversial things and then follows up with very common sense ideas. She FAILED.
@SarahPalinUSA They are burning the race card. It no longer applies...not that it ever did...but now its gone.
@SenatorDurbin Thank you Dick. Can you let us know a couple names of people in government we can talk to about this?
@KamalaHarris What changes have u made personally to support the Green New Deal?
@IlhanMN I, Me, My
@SenBlumenthal Someone who lied about being in Vietnam is a bad actor.
@seungminkim Amazing reporting. Just award winning
@AprilDRyan Boooo. I liked it.
@PattyMurray @CDCgov @HHSGov Ill be watching for their reply.
@benshapiro #mamapelosi spanked 1of them...2 more to go.
@SebGorka All you need in VA is a vacuum and some shoe polish.
@davidhogg111 @USATODAY What about @RollingStone? Or are you not allowed to call them out because they endorsed Hillary? https://t.co/cDd9ifbFO4
@TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump A dumb story from a dumb network RT'd by a dumb Coalition and liked by a dummy.
@dcexaminer @amyklobuchar Maybe she has a weak staff. Imagine crying over an email?
@chuckwoolery With his shoe polish and vacuum.
@LeaderHoyer Ok now where is the letter to the Virginia trio?
@chuckwoolery #klobalwarming
@RepHarley Here is an example of what you are supposed to be doing @IlhanMN @AOC @AyannaPressley @tedlieu @RepJayapal
@SenGillibrand This sounds so presidential. Lets see u take this advice and deal with VA.
@LouDobbs She probably had to or she wouldn't have voted #mamapelosi as speaker.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Teddy u should be careful. Mama Pelosi has the ruler out today and she isn't afraid to use it. #mamapelosi
@washingtonpost Millennials don't apologize.
@foxnewsradio @BretBaier So much photo shopping in this pic Bret. Ur a good looking guy, you don't need it. Change the pic. Doesn't look like you.
@marklevinshow What real work has she done so far?
@Acosta Yup...she thought the job just involved tweeting and now lets see if she is qualified for the actual job.
@RealJamesWoods I have a vacuum and shoe polish. I'm running against him next time!
@SpeakerPelosi HAHAHAAH @IlhanMN got busted by mama Pelosi. Hopefully you reminded her she has a district she should be working for.
@mcbyrne @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Maybe she should just work for the people who elected her. Chelsea Clinton doesn't help anything anyway.
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr Has she done anything for the district she is representing?
@RepHarley YES! Everyone seems to forget that and then we hate them. Need more like you.

@SteveDeaceShow Haha my son would kill me. Happy Bday little dude.
@RepSherrill If everyone just focused on their town, district, state or whatever things would be so much better...but everyone seems to have all the worlds answers when they get elected. Glad to see some real work being done.

@keithboykin YES! @Joy_Villa is making the #Grammys great again!
@GOPLeader Whos the democratic leader? Cant seem to find them???
@donlemon I feel like this is something you would tweet any night of the week after that bottle of Red. Since its the Crappies tonight I assume she is singing.
@ananavarro Shes having #Trump2020
@dcexaminer There is a 50/50 chance his mouth is open...

@RepDLesko @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Love this woman. Wants to get to work like she promised she would. Imagine if everyone elected did that!
@KatrinaPierson The green new deal better legalize Marijuana cuz u have to be high to get through the first page.
@RealJamesWoods Identity theft at least
@RealCandaceO Oh damn! Getting closer to #blexitboston
@ananavarro @realDonaldTrump @amyklobuchar Klobal warming.
@realDonaldTrump I thought that was Susan Collins at first but it was just @amyklobuchar shivering.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They are here bread and butter.
@RashidaTlaib Yes the Russians were able to convince us he wasn't racist and to vote for him using Facebook ads. Boy are we stupid.
@Pittdawg12 I can stop anytime I want
@CHSommers Ok this is gross. Shave that mutha already
@JoeBiden Slow Biden
@dave_lapointe In Brockton?
@AOC @mvmtschool meh. Ur followers are failing
@RashidaTlaib Wow haven't heard shit about green new  deal since the rollout. Fail
@realDonaldTrump I hope she is the nominee
@LeaderHoyer Lol ur visiting the border today but came to a conclusion already???
@clairecmc The time was when u were in office... u failed
@KamalaHarris But when everyone gets a govt job we won't see this type of thinking anymore.
@ananavarro I voted for trump because of the Facebook ads the Russians made. Im such a fool
@LeaderHoyer @RepDebHaaland @RepEscobar @RepTorresSmall @RepMGS How long have u been in office?
@RealCandaceO #BLEXIT2020 #blexitboston
@SymoneDSanders U are a complete disgrace of a woman. Don't bring ur safe race card anywhere near us regular folks. Racist.... Please...
@a_clown_prince @NARAL @PattyMurray Oh ok.
@ProudResister @RealCandaceO had a real message
@AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib @AOC @IlhanMN Looks like ur there for the 6 people that came to see u
@KatrinaPierson They are being used.
@dcexaminer How many sexes are we up to now?
@SenWarren @IlhanMN @WellsFargo This is Eli Warren at her best. Not pres tho.
@MichaelAvenatti I plan to vote for anyone who ISNT establishment.
@BetoORourke Let's see u take them down then. Do u have balls? Or just #twitterballs
@RealCandaceO @ChelseaClinton Shameless as always
@HashtagGriswold @benshapiro This is what equal rights looks like
@NARAL @PattyMurray Who pays?
@RealCandaceO Can't wait! #blexitboston
@tedlieu Yes now on to the other 2
@SenBlumenthal Vietnam
@RVAwonk Didn't she fire a woman who was assaulted.
@BillKristol He still has my vote
@dcexaminer Yikes I hope the CBP guy/girl is OK
@RepJoeNeguse Wasn't the whole thing uncertain? Couldn't any president do this? Why no fight to ever make it law?
@RepDLesko @TheJusticeDept You made more sense than anyone. Nothing new today. Bunch of crap. I used to get mad but now its just sad....everyday.
@SenBlumenthal Trust but Verify....Vietnam
@donlemon Stick to the lemon law. Save ur comments for ur show.
@davidhogg111 I believe its the zero tolerance policy...stick to gun stuff.
@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump You and @tedlieu choked. All talk. #twitterballs is all you guys have.
@Pappiness Hopefully he got his balls back in exchange. He choked. All he has is #twitterballs just like #swallowell @RepSwalwell
@RepDLesko thank u for what you said today. Would love to know what it cost us for this circus of a hearing that took place. Grandstanding &amp; the same old crap which is why we HATE most of these people. All we want is for you all to get shit done &amp; it sounds like u want the same.
@SenBlumenthal Just tell them u were in Vietnam and the FDA will listen...then verify.
@funder @RepSwalwell Me either....so he can get spanked like the rest of them.
@matthewamiller He's spankin these guys tho.
@KamalaHarris Does the green new deal legalize marijuana cuz you have to be high to take this seriously....
@SenBlumenthal Vietnam?
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Real change
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump But u said there isn't going to be a wall.
@clairecmc Weren't you in office? Wouldn't that have been the time to fix that?
@RealJamesWoods My grandmother does that
@SenFeinstein Yada Yada Yada
@kaitlancollins I hope he is just picking up his last paycheck. He was awful
@keithboykin Is that really racist? It looks dumb if anything.
@RepMikeQuigley Wow it just came out too.
@RealCandaceO Is there a third place trophy? She messed up the second place trophy.
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP What was the outcome?
@keithboykin Where is the collusion Boink?
@SenFeinstein He's in.
@IlhanMN I tht he was gay.
@NitaLowey I agree but I don't want to pay for it.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ur that inside audit that's annoying and comes around every couple years.
@RaymondArroyo @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews I bet AOC taught her that.
@washingtonpost Yes please tell me what she has going for her.
@maggieNYT @katierogers Talk about throwing u a bone.
@dbongino @IngrahamAngle Can you talk about the blackface predator sandwich of a crisis happening in VA right now and until that's resolved these D's have no credibility.
@JakeSherman @dougmillsnyt Wow...he must have really caught the moment. I could have taken the same photo with my blackberry.
@DonaldJTrumpJr #fakenews could result in the following:	ACDC - Back in Dark	Fleetwood Mac - Dark Magic Woman	Dark Eyed Pea's - lets get it started.
@RealSaavedra @BretBaier This is what happens when you are under the #TDSspell
@KatrinaPierson I wouldn't be high fiving with the crisis in VA.
@AOC Yawn AOC. The only crisis I see is in VA. You will not pass as genuine until that is resolved miss thang.
@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Ted as long as what u believe is the same as why u were voted in you should keep going as u are.
@kathygriffin Yes u know how all us white racist guys look alike. Never saw 2 Ginger kids that looked the same tho. You must feel so alone.
I'm a man who recently started shaving with @Gillette razors and I now realize @maziehirono @mazieforhawaii that its time I shut up and step up and do the right thing therefore I believe Vanessa Tyson. #BelieveVTnotVA
@realDailyWire Look at @AOC really chanting USA.
@amyfiscus @MarkLandler I could write this same article in 1 tweet which would take me 12 min tops to really formulate. I could write 3 of these per hour. What makes this great?
@TeamPelosi If only success was determined by a well written group of words.
@democracynow @popdemoc @AOC Wow the woman who confronted fake ass flake @JeffFlake is now an expert on global warming AND border security. I believe that's called a hat trick.
@NBCPolitics @BretBaier @mikememoli He already did.
@NateSilver538 So unity only depends on what's popular?
@EamonJavers Wow...Trump went easy on him.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @DavidMDrucker Its down to...do they want to lose...or get their asses handed to them.
@keithboykin Look at Boink tryna RT something so it could also serve as his own thoughts when it suits him.
@jaketapper What about the Beach Friends?
@keithboykin Who knows what u really stand for....Crisis in Va???
@ryanobles @maggieNYT If that's the case than its official #racismisdead
@SenatorTester @bjlamb406 Its hard not to like u sometimes.
@RealOmarNavarro I'm with him cuz he's with me.
@TPM I would rather original ideas get someone voted out than fake ass sound good shit like the crisis in VA.
@SaraCarterDC @AOC Yet she was clapping and chanting "USA USA"
@RepTedLieu @tedlieu @HouseJudiciary What about VA? What silence is worse?
@asmith83 @AOC That 4 min and 30 seconds more than I can stand.
@MaryMcDonnell10 @AOC Yes I love how @aoc used her to push climate change. That should make her feel better.
@washingtonpost Wow...very inspiring words.
@RepSwalwell Yes because #swallowell couldn't get it done without u.
@KamalaHarris Yes the diversity is strong with the blackface predator sandwich in VA. Don't think any other state is so diverse.
@dcexaminer @nytimes @eScarry @SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker TERM LIMITS poster children. The country was here before u and will be here long after.
@IngrahamAngle Exactly why we need term limits. This is her LIFE and not the job that it really is. She is that employee that really believes the company will go under without her.
@MarcACaputo @benshapiro https://t.co/IgWbuZlVxc
@PattyMurray I remember when u used to sit behind @SenSchumer with #Bface. U remind me of my sister-in-law with that look. That was ur peak.
@RepFredUpton I don't see any diversity in this photo....lets see that yearbook. #gimmethatyearbook
@washingtonpost What else does this guy have to do?
@SenBobCasey Yet you do nothing about the crisis in VA.
@chuckwoolery Good Gawd look at that arm.
@dcexaminer That's what u call a blackface predator sandwich. #blackfacepredatorsandwich
@MariannaNBCNews @kasie Yea the diff is MJ was no a rapper.
@benshapiro Ben, my 18yo seems to always have you on youtube or whatever digital platform is popular these days and because of this post I am happy to see him listening to someone who is fair.
@MichaelSkolnik Why?
@TeamPelosi We don't take ur word on anything since the crisis in VA.
@RepPressley But what about the crisis in VA?
@Liz_Wheeler @kayleighmcenany Post it to her @SenWarren account. She has 2.
@jtLOL @benshapiro The library and the post office. Only 2 of the most popular places we love to visit.
@marty_walsh @IBA_Boston @BHA_Boston Keep up the good work Marty. Need more like you in office.
@merica @jaketapper Well done Dan. What we would do without this award winning reporting.
@marcorubio English please...
@RepJasonCrow Since u know these 800K people so well what do they think of the crisis in VA?
@SenWhitehouse What a VA? Is it time for them to wake up?
@RepCarbajal @RepLindaSanchez @NRDems The only "HOT" topic that is front and center is the crisis in VA.
@kylegriffin1 And im sure with that college degree in journalism u didn't even think to ask..."how can u be sure"
@greggutfeld Trans?
@ZackFord @IlhanMN Sure go for it. Don't cry when u lose.
@CommonCause @AOC This makes non sense. She is talking about congress and the pres.
@LeaderHoyer @USRepMikeDoyle What about the predator blackface sandwich in VA?
@jaketapper @Phil_Mattingly @TheLeadCNN If ur a dem running for pres ur first obligation should be to show us how u deal with the crisis in VA.
@UncleChaps My wife is normal 1 week a month...can we identify a way to single out that week.
@BrookeBCNN @SenWarren @rebeccanagle That's like saying an identity thief just needs to apologize.
@dbongino @SenWarren &amp; @SenBlumenthal should be charged with identity theft.
@brithume He is the poster child for abortion and blackface. Hes got no where else to go.
@ABCPolitics Maybe just come back to Boston and see if u can fix our subway system. This pres thing isn't gonna work out.
@STEPHMHAMILL @SenWarren She was a fraud all along. She is real when she goes after banks etc...the rest is crap....
@HillaryClinton @georgetownsfs @GUPolitics Cant wait to hear ur thoughts on the crisis in VA.
@JulieCareyNBC @maggieNYT @nbcwashington This photo illustrates someone who doesn't know how to keep pushing fake racism. #blexit #blexitboston
@LeaderHoyer @EnergyCommerce When u guys show the sacrifice ur gonna make maybe ill believe it. Don't say one thing and do another.
@LeaderHoyer @OversightDems But does nothing for the crisis in VA.
@RoyBlunt I believe we call that the swamp.
@SaraCarterDC @AdamSchiff He is a loser swamp rat.
@RepMikeQuigley @RepRaulGrijalva First time in a decade? Why??? So that's why the world is gonna end in 12 years.
@TitaniaMcGrath Do you have a boyfriend? Can we go out for dinner?
@BetoORourke Add more ports of entry with barriers in between. You want to be pres? You have to actually think.
@jaketapper @ryanobles @abbydphillip @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN So funny CNN has all the opinions in the world but when it comes to VA they ask US? HAHA
@SenGaryPeters She should tell u guys to F off and not use her to sound good until u take care of the crisis in VA.
@BrookeBCNN @VanJones68 Joe Biden is like a Pizza....when its bad its still pretty good and "pretty good" is all you got at this point.
@SenMarkey Yea cuz when they realize they cant get it thru the ports of entry they will just go home and look on Indeed for a new career.
@BetoORourke So its looks like the wall should have been built a long time ago.
@SenFeinstein Does it protect Nipton CA?
@AaronBlake @maggieNYT As long as its consistent its ok.
@BrianKarem @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump He said move along people nothing to see here? What's the actual quote and whats ur actual nonsense?
@jaketapper @ScottJenningsKY @finneyk @abbydphillip @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN For what reason?
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump This doesn't make any sense. Your aide F'd this up.
@LeaderHoyer @VP @POTUS But they wont hold the losers in VA accountable? How does this work again? I'm trying to keep up.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TheAtlantic Well they cant call him that anymore because of VA. Unravelling!!
@mkraju @BrianKarem He wasn't wrong.
@davidhogg111 I like when you call out the NRA. Its genuine.
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED How can we take u seriously with the current state of things in VA.? FAKE
@AOC You left out his answer. Also was it this pres or any pres?
@LeaderHoyer You mean they didn't "understand" it already? Aren't they going around saying its the end of the world?
@AprilDRyan That's it? "Lawd"?
@KamalaHarris Starting with VA...
@BradSherman Was @SenBlumenthal there to talk about old times with them?
@jaketapper @BillWeirCNN @TheLeadCNN How have so many people supported it an not even know what it is yet?
@SenFeinstein Would love to know the equipment they used to take the temp.
@chuckwoolery So it's clear now it's the Gov and Lt Gov in the picture and the AG prob took the picture.
@DennisDMZ I think she peaked already.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I love how Nancy acts like she created this group. She is going where the votes are....phony
@kayleighmcenany All I keep picturing is a meatball fail with all white.
@GovHowardDean Because she sounded good? U clowns really think we look up to any of u? Just get shit done.
@GTSFarmer @RealCandaceO I kept saying the same thing...until I found out she was engaged. Nicely done!
@GOPChairwoman America - the only country where u lose but still get a second place trophy.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Dems scrambling to say "ur racist if u never wore blackface" That's all they got left.
@HillaryClinton @staceyabrams Agree but it's weakened by VA.
@GovMikeHuckabee She hates men. Just not the ones in VA.
@RepDebDingell Hope all is well.
@dbongino U forgot @SenBlumenthal. Identity Theft = Vietnam war hero.
@DineshDSouza @KevinMKruse How the tides have changed.
@RealCandaceO They need to #ownVA
@keithboykin At least he isn't phony. #ownVA
@LeaderHoyer @realDonaldTrump That's ur prob. U don't realize his base is everyone.
@KatrinaPierson They are squirming like hell.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Right...and we picked trump.
@keithboykin I'm not criticizing the VA dems at all. I'm just watching u squirm because ur "everything is racist" talk isn't working anymore. Was never believable but now ur struggling to believe it.
@keithboykin Boink is losing it.
@IlhanMN Wall Street should be Open Street
@KamalaHarris Are u using a social media site to post this stuff?
@KamalaHarris What do u mean the figured it out. It's all u guys talk about.
@keithboykin This makes no sense
@HamillHimself I thought that was Steve Bannon at first.
@WaPoSean @WaPoVanessa Where she will collect her 2nd place trophy...
@WhoopiGoldberg @DavidTennantPod Did you talk about @TedDanson in blackface? https://t.co/ZRdrb0QBGX
@PattyMurray Im sure that made people feel better about flying.
@SenBlumenthal Its like being stunningly unable to prove u were in Vietnam.
@SenKamalaHarris Make sure this gets to VA.
@SaraCarterDC This whole thing is bizarre.
@KamalaHarris Shouldn't we listen to ALL Women when that say that?
@SenFeinstein U have been in office for 90 years. How is this still an issue?
@tedlieu @POTUS Virginia is all I have to say.
@keithboykin Who are u going with Boink?
@ChrisLu44 I don't think anything happened in the Obama Whitehouse.
@jaketapper @edlavaCNN @TheLeadCNN Are we sure they were their "parents" ?
@eScarry @dcexaminer It's a hell of a second place trophy

@VarshPrakash @SenMarkey Can someone explain what the green new deal is?
@BrookeBCNN @TIME Wow Time us on top of their game.
@washingtonpost I have called Vegans the biggest pains in the ass when it comes to people.
@KatrinaPierson Kathy Griffin looks like a turtle on a log stretching and turning her head for sun.
@RealJamesWoods I remember when Jim Carrey was a genius. I remember when Alyssa was a poster on my wall.
@KamalaHarris What do you mean know the truth? I thought he was a Racist Russian Asset and he colluded with Russia and cast some spell on me to vote for him. What else is there?
@charliekirk11 @KamalaHarris Va is not doing too well these days.
@PattyMurray AS long as they get the job on their own and its not given to them for any other reason than they are the right person for the job.
@NicolleDWallace Again? Didn't we go thru this already? Way to spend our tax dollars...
@DennisDMZ Yea u kno there gonna do something stupid.
@alroker Yes its hard to realize u have a group of wannabes demokkkrats on ur hands.
@greggutfeld Do u have a radio show?
@GlennThrush Have u met our coach?
@DanaPerino Not after tonight.
@neal_katyal @NicolleDWallace My first question would be why isn't there collusion yet?
@dcexaminer @CoryBooker Imagine his first big meeting with another world leader...he would send a letter in advance saying "you are not gonna like the mean things I say about u"
@jeremycorbyn @AOC In other words u think she is bat shit crazy as well.
Damn New York style!
@SenGillibrand And even tho u know its prob cuz a majority of those kids were used to get thru by "parents" that weren't their parents...u still push this shit.
@DennisDMZ 1/2 time only because i'm already watching. F the Oscars.
@seanspicer @Patriots Bam!
@greggutfeld @BaldBryan Lets see ur yearbooks and then make the list.

@MSNBC So he working. That makes sense. Visionaries dont stop.
@IlhanMN Is it me or is it weird u are asking us to do ur job? Should we then find out u did call the authorities and then expect praise for something u should be doing anyway. It's like thanking a dad who provides for his kids?????
@PattyMurray @FBI Shit.shit.shit.shit.shit.shit.crap
@SenBlumenthal Great to see so many positive things happening. Can we do a bill that punishes people for claiming to be war hero's as identity theft?

@jaketapper Ralph Northam (R) was #fakenews and u knew it.
@SebGorka Whats the over/under on #swallowell @RepSwalwell giving in? He hasn't yet but if he wants to continue to call everything racist to avoid coming up with real ideas he is gonna have to fall on his sword. I say by Wed.
@SenSanders I'm enjoying the child tax credit increase.
@jeneps @AprilDRyan @margbrennan 63% don't want to think about racial issues...maybe that's the real data. But they are and u are seeing what's happening now.

@CoryBooker @RepJoeNeguse Hey genius. Ur posting this on Twitter. We want answers too. Isnt this when ur job kicks in?
@PlanetTyrus @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow Can u tell greg to unblock me or whatever so I can send him jokes/ideas for the show?
@SenSchumer Oh good because we thought u and @aoc thought twitter was in charge. I know ur used to tweeting things that sound good but this is actually work u need to do.
@jmartNYT @maggieNYT They are pissed because now they cant call everyone racist...I think he should stay.
@WattersWorld @JesseBWatters @chadgoesdeep Jesse, can you unblock me or whatever so I can PM u jokes for ur show.

@dcexaminer That's so nice of her. Im bet she has been dying to thank him.
@greggutfeld How come I cant send u Messages? I want to write some jokes for u to use on ur show.

@adamslily @SymoneDSanders @KamalaHarris Does she realize this isn't a beauty pageant.
@ryanobles @jaketapper So they want the best of both worlds. The truth is they HAVE TO do this if they want to push the bullshit racist card on others because without it they got shit to offer.

@AyannaPressley Not a word on the fire in Roxbury today. Remember them?
@RichardGrenell I wonder if she is speaking from personal experience. How can someone not born gay say they don't believe people are born gay.
@CharlesMBlow I had a Michael Birthday Party in 1984. I had the jacket, the glove and the cake....no black face.
@AudraEqualityMc For all u kno they found out after the fact it wasn't their parent and no one knows. Imagine that being a possibility???
@motokorich @maggieNYT Well we are in the US sooooo…..
@SebGorka I think that's her response to everything and the problem is here is a situation where it applies but she cried wolf too many times to make her self look and feel better.
@USA_Principles @SebGorka I cant speak for anyone but myself but its the entitlement they have and the way they hold their nose up at people to make them look bad and then a pic comes out like that. Its bullshit.
@CalebJHull @SebGorka No wonder why they call him a Racist Russian Agent...because that's the only thing that could possibly be worse than the phony dems.
@MichaelAvenatti And they go around acting like they are the moral compass of society....Please.
@SenSchumer I love how u and @aoc are demanding this end on Twitter...aren't u guys NY representatives?

@charliekirk11 I believed they also filibusters legislation to end lynching back in the day.
@KatrinaPierson Plus she likes all the attention on her.
@donlemon @CNNTonight That's only so he can continue to call everything else racist.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @pattonoswalt Patton would rather we pump the kids full of Adderall and register them to vote.
@ananavarro Not to worry ana. After trump is done in 6 years @NikkiHaley will be ready to continue to disappoint u while representing us! Of course by then u will be lucky if ur dancing at the Bada Bing.
@PattyMurray U guys have bigger probs right now.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Looks sophisticated and took time. Build wall with sensors. Prob solved
@RealCandaceO @RalphNortham I love these dems calling him out just so they can continue to call others racist for bullshit reasons. #blexit #bostonblexit
@AOC Yes we love LEGAL immigration. How many of the almost 60% are suffering from #TDS
@seanspicer @CNN @GovernorVA @RalphNortham @FoxNews They are the biggest weasels.
@BillKristol Yup they do and once trump finishes his second term @NikkiHaley will be next.
@HARRISFAULKNER @dougmckelway Glad to see Ana and Erin on the list. They are weasels.
@SymoneDSanders Weasel response including trump
@jaketapper @CoryBooker That's why I'm race blind not color blind
@CoryBooker For me it pisses me off that he had the balls to put on some second rate performace for years when all it along it was bullshit. There are many more...he just got caught.

@TomiLahren What he is saying sounds good....doesn't it? What a joke. He could care less about them. #antisoundgood.
@CoryBooker I'm writing an article and would like to know ur position on Gov Northam. You can pers msg me if you want.
@MichaelAvenatti Ill be honest...I'm a trump supporter but after the rollout of nonsense in the new house and the nonsense running for prez...you are my fav. I cant handle people thinking sounding good is a guarantee. #antisoundgood
@AP What does working to heal damage mean? #antisoundgood
@KatrinaPierson @megynkelly A phony man and his phony apology.
@RubinReport @benshapiro But she is a Muslim woman and that makes her qualified.
@allahpundit @benshapiro He will come out with some "sound good" message that he prob wont even write. #antisoundgood
@NicolleDWallace @HeidiNBC I feel bad for u guys.
@NicolleDWallace @mattapuzzo I call it a joke.
@KellyannePolls @GovernorVA "It will take time to heal the damage" is right out of the Bullshit playbook. #Antisoundgood
@KatiePavlich @benshapiro But Trump is the Racist Russia Agent.
@BrianKarem Next time hide inside a snowman and jump out before he boards.
@SenBlumenthal I hope we get to see it. Transparency is good. Like if someone said they were in Vietnam and lied about it we would want to see it.
@RepSwalwell @cameron_kasky Why couldn't u get it done?
@RealJamesWoods WTF
@Robert_Aderholt @USDA Ain't no body go'ne take away my Obama phone!
@Robert_Aderholt @USDA Fuckin right!
@RGavinF @KamalaHarris Pizza for president 2020
@KamalaHarris They are not "our" children...I want the tools to give my children the future they deserve.
@RepWexton Yes lets fund the ports of entry and just hope they don't try anywhere else.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Put me in coach!
@ddale8 @NicolleDWallace Well thank god for this update. Before this I thought we had a real problem.
@GovMikeHuckabee I'm a ninja.
@DanielDiMartino @trish_regan @FoxBusiness He looks like David Buznick all grown up.
@KellyannePolls A hallmark card that has about 12 pages.
@DonnaCassata @seungminkim Stick to sports.
@keithboykin I see 10 declared democratic candidates.
@RealJamesWoods Unless she gets up there and says she is switching parties it's gonna be the same old draaaaaaag of a speech. Ginger Kennedy did it last year and all I remember is the white crap that formed in the corner of his mouth.
@SXMProgress @RashidaTlaib @RepMaxineWaters @LeaderHoyer @RepMarkTakano @DeeTwoCents Sounds like a blast on super bowl Sunday
@SenGillibrand Someone should tell her we think for ourselves and don't look at any of u guys as moral leaders. Just get shit done.
@DonaldJTrumpJr They want to turn us into the matrix.
@thebunkershouse Lets rip down the wall that's there!
@RepMikeQuigley @HUDgov What about doing what is needed to not need shelters at all?
@RealJamesWoods All that's missing is a red carpet.
@w_terrence This was a huge flop and I hope the FBI is looking into this.
@WattersWorld @JesseBWatters @DiamondandSilk This used to work. Now they have to really produce results and they don't know how.
@LeaderHoyer @NRDems @RepRaulGrijalva Im freezing right now.
@LeaderHoyer yawn
@RealJamesWoods HAHA. They are awful people.
@kathygriffin What does the thing on ur head flip into?
@tedlieu Yes and once the technology at the checkpoints is updated what do you think is going to happen?
@SenBlumenthal I would listen to this guy. He is a Vietnam Vet.
@AprilDRyan You would this this racist Russian agent would cause the numbers to spike way up.
@HillaryClinton Maybe they should be force feeding the homeless.
@CoryBooker Fluff Fluff Fluff. I don't pay for Fluff.
@maddow They have madcow derangement syndrome.
@ElloEllenOh Race-Blind is a fair stance to take.
@Lawrence I am disappointed. He should fire the staffer and put the tweet back up.
@GOPChairwoman When it doesn't get them votes anymore.
@SenFeinstein Elections have consequences. Only these nominees will be around way after ur freshmen dems are out.
@Lawrence You sound like a shocked and appalled trigger liberal. He doesn't have to explain shit.
@IlhanMN I would be happy to meet and share notes about MN. Remember them?
@tracyelmore @2ndThinkClever @ShanBarnsley @chrisjohnson82 @RepJoeKennedy Well played.
@Atrios @dcb1995 Phonies....call them out every chance u get.
@RealJamesWoods I would love if real people ran for office vs weasel politician wannabes.
@IlhanMN Ill be honest. I don't get caught up in these things but something tells me the people who elected u didn't do it so you could talk about Israel.
@mkraju @maddow Hes got Shifft on this.
@tracyelmore @2ndThinkClever @ShanBarnsley @chrisjohnson82 @RepJoeKennedy Click click boom. Love u trigger liberals. Bet u use the phrase "shocked and appalled" a dozen times a day.
@ShannonBream @KellyannePolls @FoxNews @foxnewsnight My 2 fav ladies! Making my Breams come true. #breamers #breamteam
@dbongino Never heard of her. Nice job tonight!
@KamalaHarris Pay for free shit.
@deemun48 @keithboykin How you doing so far with my named opportunities?
@KatrinaPierson I believe dems filibustered lynching back in the day...prob for votes.
@SenatorTester @USATODAY Starting to like Tester. Was very upset when he destroyed that doctor but he was re-elected and we have to respect that. Take the re-election plus willingness to get it done and maybe I start to come around.
@RepAdamSchiff YEA! And wait until we get to the bottom of those blocked calls. THEN we will "get" him!
@TheBeatWithAri @nickakerman Yea it had nothing to do with them having broke ass security.
@AshaRangappa_ R U guys really together?
@TomiLahren I would like her so much more if she just said "oh willie? yea I F'd him"
@juliehdavis Yet ur such a weasel under the #TDSspell that you cant even call it what it is. This is probably the best example of what the "enemy of the people" really is.
@Redpainter1 @Acosta I loved when he went to the border where there WAS a wall and called out the prez saying there is no crisis. He has balls alright.
@SenGillibrand You got my attention when you said u believe voting rights should be for American citizens. Ill keep listening but if you start sounding batshit crazy like ur colleagues I'm out.
@frankdpi This is more confusing than the Rubik's cube.
@dabeard @tedlieu @RepDonBeyer @businessinsider @CREWcrew OOOOOOHHHHHH Desperadoooo
@adamgoldmanNYT @FBI It was rejected and approved by the supervisors.
@APCentralRegion @AP What was he doing during the hours leading up to the attack?
@BrookeBCNN @GirlsWhoCode I thought u could get kicked off of twitter for saying learn to code.
@RepKatieHill There is literally not one example of how ur changing the game in that joke of an article.
@jaketapper @PamelaBrownCNN @mkraju @TheLeadCNN Typical weasel Jake Trapper is at it again. His tweet doesn't include the details.
@tedlieu @RepDonBeyer @VanJones68 is it time?
@NicolleDWallace @RonaldKlain Yea and he was terrible with assisting with the #FirstStepAct
@NicolleDWallace @costareports If they think after trump finishes his second term we are gonna instantly keep supporting them they are fucked.
@IngrahamAngle @WilliamJBennett When are u having reg people on again?
@seungminkim Good cuz im pretty sure I have been running a train on ur nonsense.
@dbongino If they all move to Cali maybe it will finally slip off into the ocean.
@SebGorka Today?
@kylegriffin1 That's like saying the 9/11 hijackers went thru TSA checkpoints so we don't need 2 forms of ID to board a plane. U prob paid a fortune for whatever piece of paper MSNBC required but I could do ur job on a cup and a half of coffee. STUPID
@MikeDelMoro Isnt this #oldfakenews
@seungminkim Too bad they have walls.
@thehill This again. #oldfakenews
@lisamurkowski You would think we would hear about this on the news.
@aaronjmate @RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiff Swallow that #swallowell then #schiff it out.
@DLind Too bad they don't realize they are being used for campaign contributions.
@juliehdavis So we should wait until something really bad happens and then it will be ok to put up a barrier.
@ElishaKrauss @benshapiro Exactly! It ruins the dads life. Erryone knows that.
@CNNSitRoom @SenBlumenthal I trust a Vietnam Vet. Keep up the good work Dick.
@ThePlumLineGS I think he should run. I'm voting for anyone who isn't part of the swamped establishment. They all suck
@vermontgmg You must be the acting journalist.
@APCentralRegion @AP Why hasn't Hollywood gone all in on this?
@sdonnan @maggieNYT Good, congress is basically a glorified tabloid.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @KatrinaPierson They are under the #TDSspell
@ananavarro #TDSspell is strong with this one.
@KenCalvert In other words get ur heads out of ur ass and build the wall.
@Jim_Jordan @KatrinaPierson Those under the #TDSspell don't see it this way.
@AaronBlake @NicolleDWallace You are under the #TDSspell bigtime. Ur a senior reporter and that's what you report? Ur the guy who waits for 9/11 to happen before suggesting airport security isn't doing enough. Anytime u wanna vaca ill gladly fill in.
@chrislhayes I love this Russia crap. You guys really think people are stupid.
@BFriedmanDC @IlhanMN @RepLeeZeldin @Ilhan Oh c'mon. Explain this thought process? I'm trying to see where he is saying that.
@RepWexton If you had done it before the shutdown it would be something to be proud of. Now ur just using it as a headline.
@BetoORourke I don't know. This seems weird. I have a 2 step identification process I have to go thru to reset my Uber password. Figure it out.
@ananavarro My head hurts listing to this. You are under the #TDSspell. What do you think these cartels are gonna do now...Is it possible they will try another method of getting it thru? Like maybe where there isn't a checkpoint.
@SenTomCotton @benshapiro Its actually pretty messed up no one is taking this seriously.
@JordanUhl @AOC What were the end results?
@KamalaHarris Today? Why didn't you stand with them 4 years ago.	#antisoundgood
@tedlieu @hardball @HardballChris #lieudog when is ur tell all book coming out. Its been a month...
@IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley Let us know what they say.
@AOC You all are posting crap like this. When you have results lemme kno.
@RepMaxineWaters Its hard for me to care or agree since i'm about to enjoy my extra child tax credits this year. Not to mention my small business is better than ever since more people have jobs and shop so @realDonaldTrump can lie away!!!!
@ianbremmer 100% legal voters?
@APWestRegion @AP What if its a transgender person of color wearing it?
@deemun48 @keithboykin Well I have a small business and because more people have jobs more people are shopping. My 401k is way up. I'm getting more back in my tax return because of the increased child tax credit. Gas prices are way down. My sons diabetes medications are lower. Home value is up.
@RepHarley @CBP @realDonaldTrump Q&amp;A...Your trying to get into a house...The front door is locked but the side window is wide open. You try to get thru the door but u cant. Do you:		A) just turn around and go home?	B) go thru the window?	C) realize you have a severe case of #TDS and walk into oncoming traffic?
@DiamondandSilk I believe he is one of Dr. Fords beach friends and they got a better chance of finding the white man who @StormyDaniels claims threatened her. https://t.co/O6vqvconjk
@keithboykin As a supporter I don't care if he cares for me or not. Just bring me the opportunities that make my life easier.
@BrianKarem Nancy sitting behind him is gonna be funny.
@KamalaHarris Why not introduce a bill to ban opioids
@KatrinaPierson I think he is really one of Dr Fords beach friends.
@RepSwalwell #Swallowell and #Lieudog need to get a room.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Brian are u in the bushes again?
@KamalaHarris I think u want them to be scared.
@IlhanMN What about MN? Is it required you guys comment on EVERYTHING?
@tedlieu U and Swallowell need to get a room.
@KamalaHarris It's 2019. We don't need to be told this is wrong via a bill. Ur taking us back to a time I'm glad I wasn't here for. MLK thankfully changed the world before I was born. We don't look up to u guys like u think. Get shit done.
@igorvolsky Seems like this happens in FL more.
@WalshFreedom I think somewhere in the middle of all that it became ok to have an abortion while giving birth.
@Scaramucci @AOC @HowardSchultz I like her too mooch. I just think they are gonna use her or try to get rid of her if she doesn't give in. Her first vote was a lie. Now Nancy owes her and that's the game. Too bad.
@KatrinaPierson Is he the one caked in head makeup with all the reliable sources?
@RAM_0629 @tedlieu #Lieudog
@KatrinaPierson They are hoping to turn those microbes into dem votes.
@cericconnor @TGowdySC MFs act like they forgot about Trey.
@MarcNH @AshKSkeet @RepChrisPappas @RepJoeKennedy @HRC Now what do u call the person who doesn't like to be called he/she and u have to be pulled aside and reminded/told that in advance before meeting this person?
@ShanBarnsley @chrisjohnson82 @RepJoeKennedy Ah. I didn't catch that.
@benshapiro They should have worked in a deal that allowed them to vote first.
@Cirincione @SenMarkey @tedlieu U have to be effing kidding me. With all the vacation time u guys take?  Not to mention u can't get a friggin pothole filled.
@amayajsmith @AOC Impossible the world is gonna end in 12 years. How can she be in 3019?
@BostonNeighbor @marty_walsh @CityOfBoston @HUDNewEngland @BostonsWayHome If more politicians were like Marty Walsh they would be getting shit done! @AyannaPressley take note.
@DonaldJTrumpJr She should have been dying her hair instead.
@Kokomothegreat @RepSwalwell @tedlieu Yes I laugh at (not with) them everyday. Lieu Dog and Swallowell
@CalebJHull If the dems were smart they would push a bill that lowers the voting age to 8 months after conception and then allow the abortion at 9 months.
@repdelgado Makes sense to me
@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS If it weren't for walls I'd be asking @VP to sign my maga hat right now.
@MarshallCohen @Acosta And in the end no one cares.
@kylegriffin1 I had to read that like ten times. The hip bones connected to the....cmon man. Really?
@RepTedLieu @RepLindaSanchez @RepAnnaEshoo @RepCicilline @RepRubenGallego U guys would propose a bill like that thinking if it passes we immediately trust u guys.
@AprilDRyan @TMZ What did they look like? U know how all us white people look alike and are racist.
@RealCandaceO I was gonna say "Democrat"
@mschlapp @TomFitton My teenaged son is driving me fucking crazy. What are my options under this new abortion bill?
@TheOfficerTatum @DineshDSouza I bet it was the same guy who @StormyDaniels described as intimidating her.
@TheOfficerTatum @DineshDSouza I can tell just based on the lack of dems losing their mind.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump How are all those homeless people doing in CA?
@dbongino Whatever gets us voted in again
@KamalaHarris I tht Obamacare was access?
@dbongino In 10 year's from now they will flip and blame the times.
@TheBeatWithAri @maggieNYT @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH How many on both sides have ever even been to the border. Why aren't these guys telling us what's best. Seems weird to use polls for common sense.
@LeaderHoyer @HouseGOP Does this type of back end crap still work?
@KamalaHarris So we have to pay to get all that free crap.
@JoyAnnReid More proof she will do anything for votes.
@RepWexton No one is watching you guy waiting our money.
@ComplexMusic @benshapiro Maybe it was the same guy who threatened @StormyDaniels
@RepSpeier @JFKLibrary What about her Beach Friends?
@PhilippeReines Maybe it's because he's not a bullshit full of shit politician.
@RealJamesWoods But if it can get votes for the dems...
@AprilDRyan @AURNOnline @BennettCollege @WhiteHouse Do u see how little comments u get when u say something with substance vs anti trump. U changed recently. I liked it.
@charliekirk11 @BLEXIT Can't wait for @blexitboston #blexitboston
@SenSanders Contract workers is just a way to avkid paying benefits.
@IanCalderon @HowardSchultz I'm either voting for Trump or someone like Schultz. The rest of u guys are a F'ing joke. Term limits. Drain the swamp. No more politicians. Get to work.
@KenDilanianNBC Good. We need more people in guvmn't with balls and if they don't get reelected that's fine...but if they do...
@TitaniaMcGrath I love all the positive feedback on amazon from people who haven't read it yet.
@RepAdamSchiff So blame trump and just ignore there are idiots out there just waiting to do this shit.
@KamalaHarris Well now u are talking a little more realistically. Are we done with all this free crap?
@JaySekulow How come the 9th circuit cancels everything the prez does?
@RepChrisPappas @RepJoeKennedy @HRC What's the difference between transgender, gender fluid and just being gay?
@chrisjohnson82 @RepJoeKennedy She? Prob cries over everything. She is a woman now.
@benshapiro Not to mention by the time they "work" their way up they would be swamp rats.
@charliekirk11 So they are real refugees.
@davidhogg111 Exactly. I'm with u on anything common sense related.
@JoyAnnReid @NBCNews Wow that's a lot of people to poll.
@kaitlancollins Prob cuz of all the free shit they prob have to give away.
@TitaniaMcGrath @KevinAllred I would read it but he is a white man and u said they were evil and to ignore no matter what u say
@ShannonBream @KamalaHarris @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Love
@ShannonBream @KamalaHarris @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Live the bream team. #breamteam #breamers
@KamalaHarris I feel like I'm reading a daily calendar quote.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Imagine going for a physical and it's the same waiting room u see at the RMV. What else do ya need to kno.
@allinwithchris @chrislhayes @MarkWarner @RepJeffries @NatashaBertrand @nedprice @Isikoff @JoaquinCastrotx @michelleinbklyn @_waleedshahid Never watched but I think radio and twitter are better identifiers.
@jdavidgoodman @maggieNYT @AOC Very interesting to see the weird shit now coming out of NY shortly after amazon picks their H2.
@RepMaxineWaters I feel like someone hacked ur twitter. Why aren't you going bat shit crazy on these culprits.
@MWPalmer @CornellWBrooks @AprilDRyan @cnnbrk @TMZ @VibeMagazine @reghud @AP @nytimes @thecrimson @EmpireFOX @VICE @GetJETmag I love the real America and these 2 guys are not part of it.
@CornellWBrooks @AprilDRyan @cnnbrk @TMZ @VibeMagazine @reghud @AP @nytimes @thecrimson @EmpireFOX @VICE @GetJETmag If ur gonna use him to push ur agenda at least have the balls to say his name. Not cool.
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Who are these dirt bags.
@tedlieu Aren't u kinda getting into security and shit? Don't u have a district. Politics are so wrong.
@Ilhan @AOC Tax the shit out anyone u want but don't try to give me free shit. I work for my mo-fo money.
@RepMarkGreen @HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedOT My doc said he is heading for retirement if this crap happens.
@StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti He didn't dump her. He just lost and cost her. Not his fault she fell for it.
@RyanAFournier @SebGorka Luke 9/11 I will never forget cuz it was gross.
@KFILE @jaketapper Wow. That quick.
@SpeakerPelosi @AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump The only Spanish I kno is from Dora. Hopefully he talks about backpacks.
@SethAMandel @benshapiro Neither are funny.
@ppolitics @chrislhayes @JeremyLittau @emilybell @jimwaterson @Indira_L Maybe u should have written it before the layoffs.
@seungminkim @OConnellPostbiz @eliseviebeck @TracyJan Let's see who follows
@ChrisMurphyCT @chrislhayes And what does congress think? Do u actually have any real ideas? Worry about ur district kid.
@politico @maggieNYT Finally. Now we know. Talk about a cliffhanger.
@LeaderHoyer @HASCDemocrats Aren't u using them as a political tool by claiming he is using them as a political tool?
@thehill @tedlieu liked this? Confused
@JohnLegere I almost want to follow u so I stop getting this stupid promotion
@MichaelEMann @SenMarkey @SenWhitehouse @EdMarkey @BenCardinforMD @SenStabenow @brianschatz White privilege?
@wpjenna @maggieNYT @ZoeannMurphy @chriscmooney Yea it's fucking freezing.
@WilkowMajority @SebGorka Very interesting point.
@ananavarro So u agree with Trump?
@RepHarley I'm skipping past all the tweets that start with "10 year's ago today"
@NicolleDWallace @GovChristie Can u at least admit u were wrong about Marijuana
@JoyAnnReid @yashar I guarantee some trigger liberal finds this racist.
@AprilDRyan @PressSec What was her answer and what do u gave Roger stone as a link?
@CongressmanRuiz Does that's include statues etc?
@SenFeinstein @ASM_Irwin @laurafriedman43 @AsmShirleyWeber @Ash_Kalra @AsmMoniqueLimon @AsmEdChau @Rendon63rd Not diverse enough Diane.
@UNEnvironment @davidhogg111 As long as ur ideas are their ideas.
@RepMikeQuigley U were supposed to say "especially women of color" and that there is "still a lot of work to do" Try to keep up
@DiamondandSilk I tht that state was supposed to slide into the ocean.
@LouDobbs @FredFleitz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is weird we publicly announce this crap
@brithume Well we are paying our debts off first.
@SenWarren I feel like I have seen the same exact tweet like 3 times in a row
@jeremymbarr @Lawrence Meh. Let's see how they compare in April
@RepJoeKennedy Did u eat clam chowder before u gave the post sotu speech last year?
@keithboykin Couldn't spot either until I red the article.
@wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump Imagine how confused the enemy must be. Well done.
@DanielStrauss4 @maggieNYT @AlxThomp All she has to do is say something anti Trump and she's back in the game. That's the bar.
@MichaelAvenatti @FBI That's why we need u in 2020
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams I remember ginger Kennedy doing it last year with white crap in the corner of his mouth.
@SarahPalinUSA Technically second place. They get a trophy too.
@AprilDRyan I'm hung on possible too. Also curious why I haven't seen it on TV.
@Jim_Jordan Don't these kids have enough on their plate. Let them figure it out on their own.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Second place again...
@djrothkopf @tedlieu Ted is gonna endorse everyone.
@VelshiRuhle @tedlieu @AliVelshi @SRuhle @RepTedLieu This guy is everywhere but at his desk working.
@JoyAnnReid Susan Collins should do what she feels and if she doesn't get elected again that's a good thing. Sick of these guys changing who they are for votes.
@KamalaHarris Why are the unemployment numbers so good.
@trish_regan @jguaido So basically it's like me wearing a maga hat.
@tedlieu Ok I'll give you that one. Very original lol
@dbongino Either Trump is a genius or there are a lot of stupid people out there.
@sunrisemvmt I've heard so much about #GreenNewDeal except what the #GreenNewDeal is.
@KamalaHarris U didn't mention they want smaller class rooms. Prob cuz we take everyone in.
@kaitlancollins Strategy?
@RepThompson @fred_guttenberg I loved him in police academy.
@nytopinion @ABlinken Then how come he is so successful?
@dharmadude So when do they deliver?
@errollouis @maggieNYT Well maybe we should worry about our jobs in govmn't and the people here and now vs where ur next vote is coming from.
@markos @chrislhayes @Civiqs Any women or qualified women?
@mattyglesias It was either this or President...he took the win.
@jeremymbarr How many are second place winners?
@JoyAnnReid @staceyabrams @NBCNews @SenSchumer 2nd place trophy.
@RepMikeQuigley #QuigleyQs How many called for the wall
@JohnBrennan @BrianKarem Hopefully that collusion is in one of these cereal boxes
@RealJamesWoods https://t.co/3wCL84ElbB
@RepJoeKennedy Why no diversity? All white people???
@brianstelter @AndrewGillum @CNN U guys take all the losers. Guess it's a 2nd place trophy.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I had so much hope that he would run and make @MichaelAvenatti his VP. Oh well.
@RealJamesWoods I'm all for identity politics if it means identifying and voting the right PERSON for the job.
@MohanadElshieky My question is don't u think u should check yoself before posting incorrect trash.
@RealJamesWoods Wasn't there a whole push to "learn to code" for girls? It was OK then?
@mcevasco @tedlieu @SenMarkey Haha haha I wouldn't trust u guys with my umbrella.
@RealJamesWoods @GOP Especially Paul Ryan. He thinks if he retires for a few years he can come back when Trump finishes his second term and go back to the same old lilly pad in the swamp...nope.
@AyannaPressley @LaFabricaCentra @Patriots Damn girl. I tht u were in ur 20s. Lookin good.
@RealJamesWoods Wtf
@keithboykin @CNBC Need more like him. No more establishment dummies.
@alanhe @CBSThisMorning Oh that's too bad.
@RealCandaceO Can't wait for #blexitboston
@VanJones68 This is awful but there are conflicting stories out. Not gonna jump to conclusions again.
@keithboykin Need more info. This is terrible but are there additional details?
@politico Who the hell drinks tap water.
@realDonaldTrump Shame. Tell that story at the next rally.
@KamalaHarris How's about ALL u guys stop telling us who we are.
@SenMarkey What if that means a wall.
@RealCandaceO @HuffPost Thank God. Thought I was doomed. #blexitboston
@MikeBloomberg In other words u can't win
@AyannaPressley @jellsmoor I didn't think "barriers" were effective.
@kylegriffin1 Now they can pick and choose what they show viewers
@AyannaPressley @wutrain @MattOMalley @VoteRussell Meaning they call to get solar panels and the company says no?
@IlhanMN Sometimes u have to say no to the majority of people if it's in the best interest of all.
@keithboykin It's terrible no matters what color these people are. Hope he gets executed for this.
@IlhanMN U have barley done anything for the US. Too many cook's in this kitchen.
@GeoffRBennett @JoyAnnReid @KamalaHarris The below quote was genuine. The second part was bullshit. By now u have to realize we don't look up to u guys for ur moral ways. Just get shit done.		"If I have the honor of being your president, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect"
@ShannonBream I wish it was possible for all of us to feel this way about all loss of life everyday.
@RealCandaceO let's get a sick Playlist together for #blexitboston 	Check out Where I'm From by Digable Planets on Amazon Music	https://t.co/i5tpczjKzY
@IlhanMN Where did these ideals come from?
@KamalaHarris Hopefully u have ideas that don't involve  1) abortion 	2) guns	3) racism	4) climate 	5) taxes		Otherwise ur a broken record of the same crap I've heard for 42 years....and I'm 42.
@tedlieu Yet u claim everyday how racist trump supporters are.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well we gotta @IlhanMN on record saying it's a humanitarian crisis at the Border so let's listen to the pros and u guys get it fixed. Wall or not
@dbongino It's a joke because he is still looking for collusion that never existed. If it was that's easy to win it would have been done already.
@KamalaHarris Same same same
@AOC Demonization of "certain" immigrants AOC.
@SpeakerPelosi We should never forget but have to remember we aren't the same people today as people were back then.
@ewarren Whole life? What's been accomplished and why havent u succeeded yet
@robthorp3 @TitaniaMcGrath Yes we have a long distance relationship.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump It is kinda crazy we have these issues tho.
@greta I hope more guys like this get up and run. Politicians (not all) are awful human beings in a very important job.
RT @realDonaldTrump: BUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL! https://t.co/yDdCG5DCxn
@dbongino He's not swallowing very well today. #swallowell
@maggieNYT Seriously Maggie? Smh
@charliekirk11 I think he should bring the Indian with him.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Sad sad man. Can't "win" on his own without cheating.
@RepAdamSchiff Did u really leak on DJ like they are saying?
@kasie I don't understand ur thinking here.
@TitaniaMcGrath Im a str8 white male in love with Tatiana
@dave_lapointe That's the best part of breweries.
@dbongino U spelled his name wrong. It's Swallowell.
@RepAdamSchiff He is still prez. Why then if all this is true.
@davidhogg111 What happened leading up to that?
@RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano Finally some real truth! Keep slaying it O.
@keithboykin It is kinda funny. It's been over 2 years.
@Iddybud @AyannaPressley I get the difference but just curious why it wouldn't get full support.
@KamalaHarris What are the inequalities?
@Iddybud @AyannaPressley Any reason why it wouldn't be supported?
@AnaCabrera @VanJones68 Ya know I wont disagree but out of this whole Illegal immigration thing I have learned a lot and I cant believe it hasn't been taken more seriously. So many people did reporting on actual numbers and they are still really bad.
@maggieNYT I get the point about Trump exaggerating but those numbers are still really bad. I'm just surprised no one has looked at this seriously before.
@KamalaHarris So what is the best way to get a full and accurate count?
@IlhanMN She might be up there with Tom Brady.
@tedlieu @CongressmanRaja @RepCummings @OversightDems Now I know why CNN wants u on all the time.
@DiamondandSilk When my gurls coming to Boston?
@TitaniaMcGrath NO one messes with my girl!
@MikeMarti24 @AyannaPressley @RepPressley What was the outcome of the meeting? What type of assistance did they walk away with?
@KamalaHarris What do u suggest?
@TitaniaMcGrath I think anyone would retaliate.
@keithboykin I hate seeing these stories. What's wrong with this world.
@Weinsteinlaw Should "supporters" on either side be making the decisions on security? Shouldn't u guys be telling us what's best based on the details from the people on the front line?
@DMVBlackLives @davidhogg111 Yet Marijuana is as illegal as heroine and LSD.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @dccc The border isn't something the "voters" should be caught up in. It should be something u guys have completely under control as a given.
@ShannonBream @Macys You always have a great show....Sweet Breams.
@peterwallsten @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 @seungminkim Then he ran for the hills with his lame excuse. He will emerge when trump maxes out his time and try to be this kennedyesque savior that will fail miserably.
@PhilipRucker I think a lot of us blamed him. Who didn't want to whack him off side the head every time he annoyingly took a sip of water at press conferences. He is the poster child of the swamp./
@CNNTonight @RepSwalwell @donlemon I know u will prob just ignore this but I didn't need facebook to tell me who to vote for. Just go back and listen to Trump during the campaign.
@tedlieu Do u have any thoughts of ur own on this matter?
@TheBeatWithAri @BillKristol Only on MSNBC can u "assert as a matter of probability" to make news.
@kylegriffin1 Yet we all are paying for this nonsense.
@mkraju Its not incentive they need....its common sense.
@DavidCornDC Well it shouldn't come to that. Everyone works together and just gets shit done.
@jules_su 6 out of 7 of these channels waited for the news to come to them.
@SenMikeLee Yes! They are so blinded by the #TDSspell they don't realize how much they could get done if they worked with him.
@JRubinBlogger @VanJones68 is this how u would characterize Jared after working with him on the #FirstStepAct
@mmcauliff @maggieNYT So that's the route she us taking. Imagine if they worked together. Too bad
@dave_lapointe @AndyRichter Dave I love the new Italian place in 18.
@nerdgirldv @johnnysgrrl @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch I deleted the "white confrontationalist" because if u guys thought that I don't like it.
@AOC I don't think they went non-stop like CNN does with Trump buy I don't like when they pick on either of u cuz they can't understand why u guys got elected. Work together!!
@AnnCoulter Ann-imal we have to compromise
@AOC @SpeakerPelosi She has my full attention now. Mad love and respect for Pelos' BUT getting my attention doesn't mean I want her to just go against Trump. Now I wanna see her get shit done WITH @realDonaldTrump
@AOC And she's running for prez
@LeaderHoyer I hope the last 13 years has taught the dems its time for immigration reform.
@trish_regan @POTUS Like a millennial thru a crosswalk. These are the delays of our lives.
@Pittdawg12 @dave_lapointe @undisputed @Visa @DeionSanders @jeff_farnham @RGavinF I'm talking about how u won the coin toss at TT and picked beer pong. At my new fav place
@alanap98 @LeaderHoyer Exactly. So they will add more
@undisputed @Visa @DeionSanders I agree. I had a similar incident happen at the Triple Threat Tourney in 2017. @jeff_farnham @Pittdawg12 @RGavinF @dave_lapointe
@alanap98 @LeaderHoyer If u think this doesn't end with barriers in places ur out of ur mind.
@AprilDRyan @SpeakerPelosi Whats going to happen when the evidence based facts show barriers are needed?
@LeaderHoyer Hopefully u guys will listen to the CBP agents.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Now the real work begins.
@keithboykin And u say u don't like him.
@RealJamesWoods He also just handed them the blame for all future illegal immigration issues.
@ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump I would hope they work together and listen to the CBP agents.
@johnnysgrrl @nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch God no. Its more of a play on words. Im not racist at all but since everything is about race now I added it.
@RealJamesWoods Doesnt planned parenthood cover all that crap
@thistallawkgirl That's gay? All men look at trump like that.
@mj_lee @greta They were probably camped out there 24/7 because they wait for the news to come to them these days.
@Acosta Is @BrianKarem covered in white paint leaning up against the pillar?
@StevenLHall1 Steve. U cant say stuff like that. It was all TRUMP.
@keithboykin Maybe cuz they are gonna show him the money
@KamalaHarris Still need it tho
@davidhogg111 He is a hell of a writer but not a politician.
@johnnysgrrl @nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch I used to have a "name" &amp; "profile" until someone called me a bot.
@ChrisMurphyCT From what I have seen (just a citizen) I don't feel like the men &amp; women working the border are doing it for the paycheck.
@tedlieu Are u gonna give a reason why this wasn't pursued 7 months ago?
@TheOfficerTatum The media tells me I should not befriend this man but what if I agree with what he is saying?
@nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch Well here is a question for ya...has he done what he said he would?
@WCKitchen @davidhogg111 @mattadler81 @chefjoseandres How the hell did u manage to keep ur tie on? I had a tee on when I did ketchup initials as a lunch volunteer for the kids.
@nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch I voted for him because I didn't think he was full of shit.
@gtconway3d @chrislhayes Geo, U wanna be taken seriously? Post a real pic. Someone challenged me to prove I am a real person. Now u have my name and un-photoshopped pic.
@WaPoSean @pkcapitol What.A.Drag of a story. What sides did they have with their steaks after?
@DavidRutz @benshapiro The real racism is no one is talking about the Black Israelites (as ive heard them called), to me I'd say the dudes with the poster board.
@nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch What did I fall for?
@marklevinshow Those kids just became unintentionally typecast so fast they don't ever need to make another movie again.
@SaraCarterDC I feel like mitch made some weird deal with trump some time back that he now has to honor. Weirdness. #dts
@marklevinshow She kinda looks hot in that red dress.
@nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch So tell me why I voted for him?
@RoKhanna @AOC Maybe the first rule should be u explain what the "Green New Deal" is...I've seen these millennials taking their time thru crosswalks and they expect we click through their BS quick fast. Buyer Beware
@nerdgirldv @RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch Think about that. How did the boss of a crime fam get elected potus. Im actually interested in ur response.
@marklevinshow This is the weirdest part about all of this is if u have a brain in ur head and ur not under the #TDSspell u would completely agree with calling it a crisis. IN fact @IlhanMN called it a "Humanitarian Crisis" just this past week I believe on FNF
@trish_regan She has nothing to lose. I give her props for rolling the dice but its turning into the one who opens guvmnt first is the mos pop.
@SaraCarterDC Kind of a streeeeeetch.
@mtracey @greggutfeld I best never see @greggutfeld try to own this #
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight We should be able to identify (ballpark) how many of these polls aren't accounting for the #TDSspell
@realDonaldTrump I'm more of a 9-5 kinda guy and don't like a lot of the crazy but always make time for my ladies @marthamaccallum &amp; @ShannonBream. Always consistent and fair!
@AyannaPressley @CNN @OutFrontCNN Shufflin @digableplanets right now. Unplug and regroup.
@TheOnion Shaun I got ur back maaaaaaaate.
@JoyAnnReid What ur saying our most important peeps cant survive a month. I hope to see u promoting them when this is over.
@JStein_WaPo @chrislhayes @ewarren Boston here...we call that the "shocked and appalled" look which means its not keeping her up at night.
@MSNBC @chrislhayes Why is it "taxes" are such a fluctuating matter? Seems too convenient???
@washingtonpost Cuz hes not the number one person to lose.
@SaraCarterDC Shes a hip old granny who can hip-hop, be-bop, dance 'til you drop, and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.
@chrislhayes Whats ur pay per click fee on this?
@GideonResnick @KatyTurNBC I hope someone somewhere is looking at the money being spent on this project.
@RepDonBeyer @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepRaskin @PeterWelch OMG u guys still don't get it.
@justinbaragona @Acosta Would u like me to verify?
@Dan_F_Jacobson @chrislhayes So a WH lawyer also handles security? Please provide more info.
@NateSilver538 @chrislhayes Ur name, pic and person who RT this is a red flag to just keep scrolling.
@sparksjls @JoyAnnReid We are not so dumb to believe 47 second clips. Ever wonder why soooo many journalists got let go today?
@tedlieu @TheJusticeDept @DHSgov @DeptofDefense @USDOT @USArmy @usairforce @USNavy @USMarineCorps @USCG @FBI When I was like 26 I had an overdraft fee in my checking account and I emailed the bank and cc'd the board of directors to get my $15 fee back. This is ur peak...remember that.
@AOC And the rest stay and embed themselves with this idea that a "name" is a guarantee… today that doesn't work. The people evolved faster. Trump is proof of that.
@Susan_Hennessey @JoyAnnReid Bad for who? the 2 guys who kicked it to their supervisors or the 2 supervisors.
@askjoshdotcom @TitaniaMcGrath U mean she isn't real?
@realDonaldTrump If u re-watch the final episode of the Sopranos u get the closest look of what it was like for FBI Lovers Page and Strzok.
@AOC I will admit one thing. When I hear people say "they do the work we don't want to" I think that is real racism.
@IlhanMN I have childcare costs. I'm not a gov employee and I'm not "feeling" the shutdown prob cuz I'm already broke but u seem like ur looking to help people so...where do we go from here.
@pkcapitol @mviser As a Trump supporter I would go for @KamalaHarris over Joe. I didn't like the KHarris I saw during the Kav hearings but I don't see Joe ever going that hard for anything. I'm still voting Trump btw but that's my feedback.
@RepDanCrenshaw @marcorubio I believe u are genuine. That says a lot coming from me...but what do u say to the peeps who are HERE struggling. Nothing wrong with a pause and regroup is all I'm saying.
RT @Invest420: If you are a cannabis company looking for someone doing it right on the p.r. front, make sure you talk to @RosieMattio
@KamalaHarris I may not agree with u on (most) everything but if you come to Boston I will hear what u have to say.
@tedlieu I would say look back about a year (give or take) &amp; u will find this whole Jared conspiracy already happened. U cant miss it. It was asked dozens of times over and over during the briefings. I always say its desperate times when u go after the fam or when u talk about collusion.
@TheLeadCNN @KamalaHarris @jaketapper IDK. She doesn't answer my questions on Twitter so why would I think she would answer them on TV.
@maggieNYT So u toss the headline out there but ignore the fact it went through 2 levels of clearance. U should clarify. Think of the first 2 guys as ur junior editors.
@Peter_Wehner @PhilipRucker @washingtonpost Do u consider this a contribution to the @nytimes
@DafnaLinzer @PhilipRucker Are u so under the #DTSspell u don't see that u punt a decision like this to ur supervisors who are getting paid to make these calls. #notstupid
@TulsiGabbard @VanJones68 Please....enough of this crap. Lets talk brass tacs. We don't want to hear how ur gonna feed all of our babies. We wanna hear what opportunities u can give us so that we can do it.
@tedlieu @VanJones68 can give u one reason why.
@jdawsey1 Well if Josh says it then it must be true.
@joshtpm How do u know they wouldn't?
@JakeSherman @realDonaldTrump Why didn't it pass?
@TVietor08 @SenatorBennet @SenTedCruz Only if that's what we paid them for.
@TitaniaMcGrath Im gonna regret this in the morning but u sound more reasonable than the idiots in charge.
@davidhogg111 @chefjoseandres Gees what if he belonged to the NRA? Would you still thank him?
@AyannaPressley @CNN @OutFrontCNN In other words we should hold back the billions we are sending elsewhere. I know some peeps in Boston who could use some of that $. That's America First.
@kasie If they were so good at their job they WOULD be the supervisors.
@VanJones68 @REFORM @MeekMill 3. Blexit!
@KamalaHarris If ur working 2 or more jobs u aren't working at the right first job. What happened to the grind. Builds character.
@SenGaryPeters What about the 5 or more Border Patrol Agents that expressed the danger at the border? Typical politician.
@clairecmc Maybe u guys have no idea how grocery stores or any business works because u are in a bubble. We take care of our own. Try it sometime.
@ShannonBream The 40% is under the #TDSspell.
@keithboykin HAHAHAHA so funny. So why don't u try it boink.
@PhilipRucker Thank you for this contribution Phil. Well said.
@chrislhayes It is now.
@SenatorCarper U voted...great.
@charliekirk11 What they don't understand is even the peeps here legally or illegally (why would I ask) also want a wall because they realize someone will do their job for $2 less. Speaking from personal convos.
@LeaderHoyer @RepJoseSerrano @RepDarrenSoto @RepAOC U should have the mayor of El Paso swing thru sometime and tweet what he discussed with u.
@KamalaHarris Times have changed H. We understand the mathematics. Need 60.
@AOC I'm all for states getting to choose.
@IlhanMN You called it a "humanitarian crisis at the border" on TV just within the last couple weeks???
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Where has the FBI wanted to interview Trump?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Swallowell has "put them away" but doesn't have the vision or balls to do what's needed to prevent them from being here in the first place.
@keithboykin Do we know all 800k of these people are ok with u speaking for them only to forget about them when this is over?
@IlhanMN Ok there lovey. Slow down a little. U don't have to comment on everything.
@SpeakerPelosi Oh are we one now?
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I agreed with u and then I thought the % of hijacked airplanes is way down since 2001 and if that line works for border crossings I figure it works for this too.
@kaitlancollins 1/2 would be reasonable
@AprilDRyan No other options...
@KamalaHarris How would background checks stop the guns from coming over the border? In fact wouldn't it make illegal guns worth more $?
@seungminkim @SenTomCotton Seems logical to me.
@jpaceDC @maggieNYT What's wrong with that? Isnt Mexico safe?
@sarahkliff @maggieNYT Real journalism! Did the work to get the story with a good outcome. Didn't use "TRUMP" to get the spotlight. Kudos Sarah.
@markfollman @RepSwalwell A dolt? That's not even funny. I call him "Swallowell" That's funny.
@SenMarkey Racist wall? Then rip down what u guys already put up.
@SenFeinstein Why don't u suggest what we should do about it? And don't say donate money to some cause...we shouldn't have to pay for something u guys should be figuring out.
@LeaderHoyer @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Tomorrow on the floor can u explain why the border wasn't already secure and it took this to get u guys to act.
@LindseyGrahamSC YES! With DHS priorities. No one is listening to them.
@kaitlancollins I hope they do so we can move on to the hysteria.
@keithboykin Shouldn't the border have already been secured tho?
RT @Invest420: Cannabis Operator Vertical Bets Big on Hemp with Plans to Spin Out a Wellness Company https://t.co/quW6FG0vpt #cannabis
@lisamurkowski Now is NOT the time...The time was waaay in the past...U didn't listen so we brought u Trump.
@LeaderHoyer @POTUS Imagine it had to come to this for u guys to negotiate something this important. Something tells me u guys have just looked the other way all these years while the border was a cash-cow for some.
@GovMikeHuckabee How can we trust them? Are they REALLY laying off 250 people?
@CoryBooker He is thinking without feelings or emotion.
@JoyAnnReid If this hangup was actually over something that impacted everyone day to day I could understand it but how the hell doesn't a "wall" aka whatever u want to call it, not already exist. Also why hasn't anyone listened to the CBP agents?
@kaitlancollins In the past each side would come out with some bullshit line about "we'll get em next time" and make it elections promises which never get kept...until now.
@charliekirk11 I hate seeing people used. Especially young adults.
@keithboykin The Katrina part was too much for me. Racist or not.
@kaitlancollins What a joke.
@stevenportnoy @maggieNYT But they control the Senate. How do they lose?
@RepSwalwell The US Capitol is a structure. That makes no sense. Sounds like you are saying we need a dome then.
@dave_lapointe Lets go see it together.
@SenFeinstein What if the answer to prevent it in the future is a barrier?

@Refinery29 @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley They defied all odds, got elected with grassroots movements then became the same tired old dems. What does "getting" the pres do for Boston Ayanna?
@DailyCaller Steady Joe!
@RepJeffries @VanJones68 Van Jones is a good guy. The only one so far I have seen give credit to the prez, kush and others because he believed in this more than he disliked them.

@keithboykin I'm not a fearful white person. Build the wall and throw this MFer over it.
@MaddowBlog @maddow I did it. The answer to the first question is "im looking in the mirror" The answer to the next question is "responding to the first question"
@AyannaPressley Now were talking! :)
@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi Is that so bad? Apparently all they are doing is voting on the same bill like 11 times or something.
@SarahPalinUSA She looked down on so many people/thought she was better. BOOOOOOO
@chrislhayes In Boston its all about the brim
I think @SenBlumenthal should interview Nathan Phillips about what its NOT like to be in Vietnam.
@ezraklein I fell in love with Kellyanne when I heard her on CH115 Sirius Radio so watch it.
@JebBush Awe Jeb! You guys still care about each other.
@KatieMLeach Sounds like Bastas Weymouth
@davidhogg111 Yes! Anyone who "sends their thoughts and prayers" is full of shit. Ill give u that.
@charliekirk11 Apples and Oranges. Paul Ryan got disgusting labeling anyway.
@TeamPelosi How much did that cost for no reason.
@davidfrum 31% is about the same % of peeps who want border security "wall". So you and @tedlieu agree that commends more attention as well?
@SebGorka I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a MAGA hat but at the same time I wish I could wear one.
@anniekarni @PhilipRucker Finally some real reporting.
@kathrynw5 @BretBaier I learned not to jump to comment.
@IlhanMN I think realistically T is doing this because no one ever keeps their campaign promises and he looks at his election as everyone of u should. Don't you want the opp to fulfill the promises u made?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I just got a new grater and a block of parm from the Italian store.
@kaitlancollins Over a "wall" AKA Border Security. Something we all shouldn't be caught in the middle of. I was more surprised there wasn't already a "wall". The real collusion is they are getting campaign contributions to the likes of which no one has ever seen before.
@AnnCoulter Do you really talk to the president? I've heard it a few times now and I always wonder why no one has gotten to the bottom of it.
@nowthisnews @AOC I thought it made a lot of sense but calling it out isn't getting the issue resolved so what's next?
@RepAdamSchiff The prob with u guys is you flip flop on the decisions we shouldn't be caught in the middle of so u can use them for elections. The extremes on both sides is the biggest slap in the face and u don't see it.
@abbydphillip @AprilDRyan Imagine that. We actually care about the real news.
@OutFrontCNN @AprilDRyan @ErinBurnett Interesting because u guys have been saying this spec about T so its just another day but for Pelos'...
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I believe he is. CBP
@maggieNYT Maybe but I don't see it picking up steam.
@clairecmc You say it but is anyone gonna be surprised.

@dbongino I wish I could. I'm terrified to.
@AprilDRyan Ok fair enough. If he was allowed to walk thru we wouldn't be taking about it. What about the incidents that occurred beforehand? How do u ignore the kids being called "school shooters" "faggots" "incest babies" "N-word" ? I can't figure u out April and I have been trying.
@KatrinaPierson After buzzfeed and the maga teens. Nope no trust.
@JamieOGrady @DLoesch @tedlieu Do u have more details on this? Ted will like anything if it works for him.
@lisasharper I love how u are giving them a pass. "Fixture on street corners" "offensive language as they usually do" Maybe but to high school kids.

@maggieNYT Like Maggie didn't know in advance. White house corro for NYT and an analyst for CNN.
@pig_too @zachbussey @Twitch @AOC Nope.
@MarkMazzettiNYT According to Buzzfeed.
@CharriseLane @AnnCoulter This is what Brave looks like.
@zachbussey @Twitch @AOC AOC is awesome. Only if she went knocking on the WH door and made a deal with Trump. They both seem like the type who just want to get shit done?
@JohnCornyn @CBP @DHSgov @rgv3307 No they haven't. That's the messed up part. Why?
@maryhimes @davidhogg111 @CAGVNews So they are committing suicide because they have guns in the house?
@MaggieMae10514 @AprilDRyan Understood and fair enough.
@AnaCabrera @tedlieu @RepTedLieu Yet Ted spends all day trolling Trump and hasn't mentioned these kids until now. I bet he hasn't asked 1 of them what they think of the offer.
@davidhogg111 The world is what we make of it I thought.
@jaketapper @sarasidnerCNN Really Jake? "the video we all saw Saturday" You cant even describe it? WHY? Because more people will watch. Weasel.
@dave_lapointe @NFL I would agree with u if I didn't just win some $ on that game.
@MaggieMae10514 @AprilDRyan I think she should spend a few minutes talking about the incident this past weekend involving those teens and set some of the record straight. Maybe they don't deserve a full pass but they deserve a little clarification.
@djrothkopf Ask @SpeakerPelosi. When has Trump budged?
@SebGorka @secupp I am now proud of these kids for not stooping to the level of the adults that were there. Yes it was uncomfortable to watch the 30 seconds of that kid with the MAGA hat on but after watching that entire video they deserve some kudos.
@AOC @Mermaids_Gender I feel like if I said Queer Community I would get bottled
@GovMikeHuckabee I just called 911 because my favorite person @PressSec just said "Go Chiefs" After 2 years we finally disagree. GO @Patriots
@tedlieu @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP Are u a rams fan Ted?
@SenFeinstein Are you sharing all stories or just the ones that make things look good for u.
@jaketapper Jake, I don't know who but someone needs to step in and break this whole thing down. Real journalism can make this right.
@SarahHuckabee @PatrickMahomes5 @Chiefs SARAH! After 2 years I finally disagree with u! GO @Patriots
@johncardillo @DonaldJTrumpJr I was ready to strangle them and I am a trump supporter. Then I watched the 1.5 hour vid and after seeing the kids called all kinds of names I realized how mature they were because not once did they anything in retaliation.
@PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 Its still not over.
@JamilSmith Then I watched the full vid.
@Surabees @SebGorka Its true. Wish I didn't jump to judgement.
@ScottAdamsSays @SebGorka @donlemon @splcenter Watch the whole vid
@DailyMail @SebGorka Watch the whole video.
@Heminator @TomFitton I wanted to strangle this MF'in kid when I saw the clips. Now I want to strangle everyone that was there after watching the whole 1.5 hour video.
@AprilDRyan @RealDLHughley I agreed 100% but after watching the full video its hard to ignore everything else. I still don't like it. Would be curious to hear ur thoughts on the whole vid vs the clips.
@CassandraRules @AnnCoulter @PressSec @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS I don't kno what to think anymore. I just watched the hour plus video and feel bad I called them out. I still don't like it but its hard to ignore all the facts.
@McCormickProf @jaketapper @amconmag I just watched the whole video too and I jumped the gun as well.
@AyannaPressley Did you watch the whole video?
@tedlieu @MeetThePress @RudyGiuliani @DonaldJTrumpJr How do u kno? Is that senate hearing public?
@keithboykin How
@KG_NYK @AOC True Dat
@SebGorka @POTUS Boston!
@RepEscobar What do the CBP agents say?
@keithboykin He would forgive.
@jweinhagen @IlhanMN Did anyone see what they thought of the offer?
@BuckSexton @DonaldJTrumpJr I thought that anyway
RT @Invest420: #cannabis business news not noise		https://t.co/LB3oHpFP9I
@SebGorka Right! Teddy literally says the same thing everyday. If he didn't have Trump to criticize I don't think he would have anything else to do.
@clairecmc @jaketapper @Chiefs Pats v saints
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump It's been 2 years. Is anything better?
@JournalistReal @TravisAllen02 @CovCathColonels Never said it wasn't.
@mviser @maggieNYT These kids are dumb at best. Minds still forming. Make them pay with something they hate like admitting they were wrong and apologizing.
@mkraju @maggieNYT U spoke to all the dems in this short amount of time
@DeanObeidallah What is "the right" exactly
@CalebJHull @dbongino She is entitled to her opinion. If she didn't love it here she wouldn't be here.
@Sen_JoeManchin Steady Joe Manchin. Imagine if both sides were like this guy. Good man.
@keithboykin How much does a vote cost taxpayers?
@allahpundit Isn't that the game?
@PatCunnane I see trump and want to put on a hat and then give those kids a beatin
@MyDaughtersArmy @LeMeTellUSumtin The kids need a beatin'. Glad he didn't blame anyone else like the rest of them are.
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr She is draining her own swamp
@HARRISFAULKNER @NikkiHaley U would think before they said anything they might talk to a dreamer or people that might benefit.
@CrisAlexJimenez @AyannaPressley I didn't hear that. I love trump but if I see mass deportations of people who don't deserve it I'm going to protest.
@RepJoeKennedy The issue is he can do it. Why aren't all of these things laws one way or another.  What's the point if someone can change it every 4-8 years.
@IlhanMN I agree. It could be 5 women and it matters just as much as 5 million.
@IlhanMN They need a punishment thats appropriate. A beatin' would do. I don't believe it's individual 1s fault tho.
@greggutfeld Yes that's exactly what they need. Punks.
@JournalistReal @keithboykin Not me. Never in my life.
@keithboykin I'm gonna do a shot everytime u say the word racist.
@keithboykin She stuck to her guns. Did what she thought was right. That's the best way to fail in my mind.
@CNNSotu @jaketapper @RepMiaLove @RickSantorum @JenGranholm @RepBarragan The Buzz of the Union with Jake Trapper
@DavidRutz @ChrisCuomo Notice how he says he did the president "one". Completely forgetting about the rest of us. Maybe it was good for us Chris.
@pkhoury_nyt @maggieNYT This guy is with the Buzzing New York Times. How can we believe u?
@CaliforniaPanda @DonaldJTrumpJr I might not be prez but when u have a vision u don't stop working guy
@davidmweissman @IlhanMN @DonaldJTrumpJr What does that even mean. I'm in and around Boston everyday and literally nothing has changed from what I can see. It's been 2 years. Ur under the TDSspell.
@NBCNews @maggieNYT Nice Friday night plant
@AOC Some of us. I got one foot in the door tho.
@peterbakernyt Well of he knew about all the other stories he wouldn't have time to do his job. Barr is coming.
@colerenfrow32 @DonaldJTrumpJr No shit. Much rather mingle wit a bigmac in my hand. Where dem drinks at
@anildash @AOC This is the AOC I love
@RealSaavedra @SebGorka We let the bees out.
@greggutfeld B'ZNN has a ring to it
New Poll is out! Millions of people no longer under the Trump Derangement Syndrome Spell. Thanks @BuzzFeed #TDSspell
@allahpundit @greggutfeld They do a hell of a job comparing pizza.
@SebGorka @BuzzFeed @realDonaldTrump We have to look on the brightside. How many people were just freed from the #TDSspell.
@Ola_Salem @AOC The lasagna part seems genuine.
@RealSaavedra That's what it looks like when the #TDSspell is lifted...
@jaketapper Really...
@mtracey @greggutfeld Woke from the #TDSspell
@chrislhayes Call it what u want. Credibility outtie kid
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @IlhanMN called it a "Humanitarian Crisis at the Border" this week on TV. So dems agree!!!
@NBCNews @maggieNYT Yea cuz I'm sure they learned about all this when that show came out.
@gtconway3d @jaketapper So u are calling it inaccurate media reports too? 🤺
@SenatorCantwell Buzzcare?
@SarahPalinUSA Love my Latina friends in Boston. Genuine peeps
@PoliticalShort @DonaldJTrumpJr @RepAdamSchiff I think he is still on the bus
@DavidMDrucker @maggieNYT Liars squirm.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @wikileaks I genuinely feel bad for @jaketapper. He forgot to leave emotion and judgement at the door. He left his brain and balls instead.
@SebGorka @RealCandaceO Love this one. O is the shit. I have more hope in her to end the "everything is racist" crap than anyone in the game.
@allinwithchris @chrislhayes Dude has a Northface on! Can't be that bad khed.
@allinwithchris @chrislhayes This is what @chrishayes comes up with 28 minutes after he realizes games over. Can any off these 800k people believe anything u clowns say after ur faking news today! Damn son?
@realDonaldTrump Don't we have drones for that
@ScottJenningsKY @jaketapper @CNN @JohnBerman @NewDay @BuzzFeed Do u commend them for running it all day too?
@RepSwalwell Was that before or after u told her u are with buzzfeed
@seungminkim Which we all support. I donated
@voxdotcom Vox? Buzzfeed? Is it this easy?
@AP I hear @BuzzFeed is hiring.
@realDonaldTrump Yup.
@IlhanMN @WomensMarchMN Very cute. I hope u guys have a nice weekend. Enjoy
@seungminkim Did you get this from @BuzzFeed buzzfeed?
@jaketapper @StJoMo PATS GOT THIS!
@IngrahamAngle @davidwebbshow Which one is David Webb? There is a black guy, a white guy, a white girl and a white gender fluid individual?
@realDonaldTrump With u since day one T.
#hatetrumpmedia Cuomo is either corrupt or has a severe case of #TDS with his quote - "Mueller didn't do the media any favors tonight and he did do the President one" - What about us? Maybe he did US the favor.
@BrianKarem Brian, you need to up ur game...we only listen to @buzzfeed and Rachel Madcow these days.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Unless @maddow or @BuzzFeed says it I don't believe it.
@IngrahamAngle I only believe what I hear from Rachel Madcow and @buzzfeed.
@lizcgoodwin Ted is using the skills he learned in Twitter class. Go back and like everything u can to deflect ur #TDS
@jaketapper Jake u cant get off that easy. 2 people with #TDS don't equal one normal person.
Where are the freshman demz tonight? @AOC @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley??? Didn't u see the buzzfeed story today?
@greggutfeld Not on my watch. These guys are awful awful people/
According to @BuzzFeed none of us need to pay taxes ever AGAIN!!!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Teddy u need to double ur dosage....#TDS
@greggutfeld Greg is way too self absorbed to suck up to anyone.
@KatrinaPierson Imagine how many doctors are taking house calls tonight.
@michaeldweiss @jaketapper And Buzzfeed.
@jaketapper Can we believe anything this guy has to say @DonaldJTrumpJr? Jake needs to fill his script. #TDS is in full effect.
@ChrisCuomo Chris u just showed ur #TDS by saying "Mueller didn't do the media any favors tonight and he did do the President one" What about us? Might u be part of the swamp?
@RudyGiuliani Rudy u are the man by the way.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yet they played it all day. Desperate as hell.
@seungminkim Im with her. Onward together. LOL
@maggieNYT Ur redirection isn't working. I don't think @AOC could bail u out of this one.
RT @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/wjqVvTqeky
@realDonaldTrump Listen up! This is ur prez speaking.
@AOC @WhipClyburn I hope you taught them to delete a tweet when their #TDS flares up and they invest their soul in Buzzfeed.
@thehill Squirrely Ted Lieu likes this idea all of a sudden.
@ShannonBream I HEART BREAM!
@RealSaavedra @dbongino The story on its face was a joke. A clients LAWYER LIED because he told him to.
@RandPaul @RepRoKhanna Rand, as an individual with a brain in his head I knew this years ago. Shit or get off the pot. In the end of these endless wars all we end up with is dead Americans.
@seungminkim But Trump is a liar? Right? Are you saying we should listen to him now? I cant tell which one of us has TDS?
@EricHolder Look at all these likes and RTs from 20 hours ago...HAHAHA
@jaketapper Don't deflect Jake. TDS is an illness. You wouldn't apologize if u were a diabetic. Right?
@JfTennessee @clairecmc Now Now...we have to be nice to Claire. She has TDS.
@MarkMazzettiNYT Maybe Buzzfeed can answer this one. Also if Mark was half the investigative correspondent he claims he would clarify Trump license his name. Doesn't build.
@clairecmc But what about the Buzzfeed story?
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Today is Friday which means:		Ted is a Sucker	Ted has TDS	Ted is a Chuck n Nancy puppet		Did I miss anything?
@clairecmc NO WAY! PATRIOTS!!!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump HAHAHA Ted going back to his old crap, cuz the new crap was squashed.
@JohnBerman u and ur buddy need to just quit at this point. Give us a new day that doesn't include BUZZFEED
@MSNBC @chrislhayes Yea we will pass. U guys are literally stupid.
#TDS - Stupid, emotional, over-wrought.

@realDonaldTrump He would be proud of you T.
@AOC AOC What is ur drink of choice? I'm on my 3rd merlot.
@ShannonBream @drmoore I'm Italian...don't kno if I can follow this thought process.
@keithboykin @StephenMoore @joanwalsh Dems will so whatever gets them elected. Could care about u one day...the next all depends.
@wolfblitzer I've never seen u move ur head
@AOC I don't think he is stripping it away. Looks like he is just saying I don't have to pay for it anymore.
@keithboykin In his office. U can't see him or get in? Oh there are walls that don't work blocking u.
@stevenportnoy @PhilipRucker Asked news organizations not to report their trip?
@anniekarni @maggieNYT @peterbakernyt He is the prez.
@RealCandaceO @AnnCoulter Im here on the east coast and I have plenty of Hispanic-American friends and family and they do not want someone taking their job for $1 less an hour.
@SenFeinstein @SFGMC Did u forget the Q?
@SenatorCantwell Yet u ignore the border agents.
@keithboykin But what about all the hungry homeless Christmas present-less families here as a result of the shutdown?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump How awesome is that.
@IlhanMN @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump You just said it was a manufactured crisis but then said we should deal with the humanitarian crisis at the border. Which is it?
@AprilDRyan Idiots
@TheOnion @AOC I hope she isn't some sort of "Dr Ford" planted into the govmint with reliable beach friends.
@davidhogg111 Yes it is. Easier said than done. I know I do my part.
@Acosta Its like that time u were at the wall....
@keithboykin Are you asking or telling?
@keithboykin @KellyannePolls colluded? IM confused.
@SenatorCantwell I count 22 pictures with a generous "multiplied by 4" meaning 88 people impacted by the loss of a couple weeks pay compared to "X" number of people impacted by illegal immigration/drugs. If X is &gt; 88 then shutdown is warranted. The other 799812 people are for it.
@PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan But rather than research it u think u are doing ur job by passing it along? If so can I have an application?
@keithboykin Tweeting other peoples thoughts?
@ChelseaClinton @davidhogg111 If I wasn't following @davidhogg111 I don't think I would even kno @ChelseaClinton existed.
@SenGillibrand Do I have to add my name and info for my "no" vote to count. Seems like ur taking a census. Why do u need this personal data?
@marcorubio Are u really committed to this daily psalm tweet?
@RandPaul Here we have a smart guy. Banking less on the pop "anti-trump" culture and sticking to his roots and getting what he wanted done.
@DrPhilRoe U referred to urself 3 times in this tweet.
@pkcapitol @AOC @eliseviebeck She is still answering to the man. Anyone under 60 doesn't care about nudes anymore.
@mkraju @maggieNYT Meaning the bots will follow. @ChrisCoons &amp; @CoryBooker . I can buy @chriscoons bullshit but @CoryBooker was looking for a fight &amp; when the trigger phrases &amp; going over time didn't get the desired outcome he folded quick fast. With an immediate follow-up via tweet. Not impressed
@bryanbehar Maybe an individual who has the ability to get Russia to do what he or she wants is exactly who we should want in the Whitehouse
@Rene_MarshCNN @kaitlancollins @TSA Rene, can u put me in touch with someone in Boston that can tell me what a volunteer can do to help? The shutdown is worth the hassle to me and since no one else is offering solutions I am just going to throw myself out there.
@LeaderHoyer @AACountyGovt Can u report back with the data on the resources. Cost, Quantity, number of individuals offered/use specs?
@RepAngieCraig Tell them a 20 second video gets about 3 seconds on avg.
@BetoORourke Straight out of the BS book for beginners.
@chrislhayes Too bad there aren't anymore credible journalists left to look into it.
@bennyjohnson @dbongino @SecNielsen Yes we don't listen to Homeland security or border agents anymore because we have Trump Derangement Syndrome. #TDS
@loisromano Its because @MikePenceVP watched the damn @Gillette commercial and realized he couldn't tell her what to do anymore.
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS All over securing the country...
@SenatorCarper Why is an  11 year old worried about that?
@davidaxelrod @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Trump could shoot me in broad daylight on 5th avenue and I would still vote for him.
@RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump They are gonna let Max Waters try to use her as a plug to the swamp. She doesn't need anyone. Just as Trump doesn't need anyone. The voters have their backs.
@KatrinaPierson Yes when its the vote. U are on the finance committee? AKA Max Waters either wants to use u or tame u. Drain the swamp.
@stabenow Why is he lifting the sanctions?
@TitaniaMcGrath Remember I said I would save u.
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Then why are u listing all his positive traits.
@IlhanMN It would be funny if it wasn't true.
@dave_lapointe I wouldn't know.
@party_ole @SecPompeo @VP @StateDept Prob because its a waist of money and we don't need them.
@SecPompeo @VP @StateDept U rock Mike!
@policyjunkie @AOC Govt norms is what got u here.
@AOC @LaurenUnderwood Good to see u guys in the office today. Keep going.
@ApothemMedia Mike was going to tell her not to take the job but then he watched the Gillette commercial.
@gelles @Acosta What can I do to assist. The shutdown is worth it. Ill offer my time or anything else they need. Don't want any $
@seanspicer @NBCNews She has her own swamp to drain. Trump and AOC are my 2 favs.
@SenMarkey I'm in MA and I will gladly volunteer without pay because this is all for a good reason.
@seanspicer @RedSox @WhiteHouse @BostonGlobe Boston Representing!
@SenatorBraun @SenateGOP Need more like u.
@ryanstruyk @jaketapper @CNNSotu Interesting u guys E-Verify and require:		Note to International Students: All international students will be required to provide documentation of proper visa paperwork prior to your arrival if accepted to the program.
@AOC @aoc can u use ur platform to share the amber alert issued regarding the 4yo who was abducted today.
@kylegriffin1 This is old news.
@ScottPresler @AnnCoulter Where is this information? I have to call u all out equally.
@TitaniaMcGrath I would save u and be burnt to a crisp and come out genderless and need vegan feeding thru a tube the rest of my life. Would you love me then? All I do is compliment u!
@WalshFreedom It will still go on. Trump can do it anywhere and we will watch.
@kaitlancollins I wonder who is right
@CoryBooker Looks the cameras have gotten better. You don't have to be 10ft away from the glacier anymore to get a clear pic.
@seanspicer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS @LeaderHoyer @realDonaldTrump He wants it cancelled because he cant stay up that late.
@AyannaPressley I know plenty of people in our district, who are immigrants, who WANT THE WALL TOO.
@seanspicer @PressSec @POTUS They wait for news to come to them now.
@jaketapper @SunlenSerfaty @TheLeadCNN Great! Because so many people would have become racist if they didn't. As if anyone really looks up to these gov idiots.
@NewsHour @SenBooker @CoryBooker Something we can all agree on.
@mayawiley Secret meetings? Was he supposed to disclose them in 2016?
@downwithtyranny @AOC @tedlieu Ted needs it. AOC not so much. Ted wants to be like AOC but realizes its not working.
@AnnCoulter What is that money for?
@brhodes @chrislhayes I didn't know trump was in govt in 2009
@Heminator @AnnCoulter HA I think I just heard a toilette flush.
@donwinslow @jaketapper Come on Don. We only go back on tweets to destroy people.
@tedstew @IlhanMN What is the situation
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls Sounds like my kinda party.
@AnnCoulter Im never shaving again.
@CoryBooker What do you need to feel comfortable? He seemed genuine.
@jaketapper Do they do it for the paycheck tho?
@IlhanMN This is the politician trap. They say one thing and do another and flip back. I hope u don't fall into the trap.
@IlhanMN What if u wanted to talk about it without opening the gov? Could you?
@keithboykin Boys can be boys without turning into a monster.
@VP @HowieCarrShow @POTUS Good Job Guys! Keep it up.
@tedcruz Please make this happen.
@RealJamesWoods @Gillette Im thinking we dump them in the Boston Harbor.
@RealJamesWoods Keep us posted if u find any. Ill keep a lookout on the east coast.
@clairecmc Beautiful. I looked forward to teaching my son to shave one day...
@RealJamesWoods We will shave again!
@RealJamesWoods All balls itch.
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @TheJusticeDept Ted is looking for his Spartacus moment.
@TitaniaMcGrath Can we change it to razors since Gillett and Harrys are gonna have overstock.
@tcberenson I believe Giuliani said they have a counter-report.
@TitaniaMcGrath Im always telling u how right u are.
@ArevaMartin &amp; @Acosta should start their own news channel. https://t.co/BMGqZzC3Hb
@SenCoryGardner I have a Spartacus moment for you (not being funny). Light one up on Twitter.
@RealJamesWoods Its so easy too.
@RealJamesWoods Swallowell at it again.
@NoahHurowitz @chrislhayes Not surprised.
@RealJamesWoods @harrys They don't want us to shave for some reason. I love Harrys. Have been recommending them to everyone. Not anymore. I don't even care what they believe. I just wanna shave without thinking about this crap.
@RepMikeQuigley Good. Why wasn't it done sooner.
@SecPompeo Mike you are doing a great job! Have a good day.
@IlhanMN @senatemajldr Is that why none of u guys want to go to lunch at the WH?
@SpeakerPelosi What does blocking the lunch invite do?
@CoryBooker I liked u today. Didn't think I would. Good questions.
@RepJoeKennedy The Tuesday talking points must have arrived from Chuck and Nancy.
@PeterAlexander @BrianKarem So dumb. What a missed opportunity to stand out and get shit done.
@scottwongDC @jaketapper @SpeakerPelosi SO dumb. I would have gone. I would work with anyone to benefit my bosses (voters)
@lisamurkowski Another recess? U guys are unreal
@davidmweissman Not wanting to hear someone's bullshit does not make them a coward.
@keithboykin Barr is solid.
@AprilDRyan I give u shit girl. Happy Anniversary. Maybe ill call into ur radio show
@trish_regan Whatever it takes to get those votes.
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter @Gillette Talk about marketing that works.
@JoeSmithSDK @RoKhanna @BernieSanders No doubt. Im just surprised there is a poll. Who the hell wouldn't want lower costs on scripts.
@JoeSmithSDK @RoKhanna @BernieSanders Its like taking a poll on who wants to be stabbed in the eye.
@SopanDeb You cant say that until u try.
@BresPolitico @maggieNYT @SteveKingIA @sarahnferris "Boston sucks"? Whats that all about kid.
@RoKhanna @BernieSanders Did any want them raised. Are you kidding me with this poll.
@BretBaier @realDonaldTrump I keep asking u to be on the show.
@LeaderHoyer Yet u haven't offered one suggestion to remedy the situation.
@hunterw @maggieNYT The more I see this the more it makes me think I should be a WH correspondent. Seems like the news comes to u and u just repost.
@anniekarni @maggieNYT @nytimes Are there any illegal young transgender people of color up for the job? If not she is screwed. Anything less is going to be racist/sexist/homophopic/etc/etc/etc
@sahilkapur @IlhanMN Who belongs in those halls?
@trtworld @IlhanMN I bet a friend of mine who said the same thing $100 he wouldn't be impeached. Wanna go $200?
@IlhanMN @SteveKingIA Are you allowed to comment on Ed Buck?
@Jasmyne Very cool!
@sahilkapur @QuinnipiacPoll So we blame 92% of congress for putting us in the middle of this crap.
@SenSchumer @Mets @Yankees I can always tell when u speak genuinely. This is one of those moments.
@makejdm @PressClubDC @NABJ @MDDCPress @BrianKarem @SPJDC @MdSPJ @annamccachren @spj_tweets @UMNewsie Is that Pat from SNL on the left?
@jbendery Let the people speak and censor him out of office. Can't trust politicians to do anything that doesn't benefit them.
@WaPoExpress @AOC Happens to the best of them. Once they get there its all about staying at whatever cost.
@IlhanMN @senatemajldr 41% believe it is necessary. Do we ignore?
@JuddLegum Its doesn't look like you did either.
@dbongino She wouldn't oppose anything that gets her elected.
@BrianKarem I think the majority of us eat fast food because we cant afford the finer things in life.
@SteveScalise @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump I bet if the wall guaranteed their re-election they would sign quick fast.
@BernieSanders -Why	-Why	-Why	Shouldn't we figure out why?
@kerrywashington @CBSNews Maybe we should ask for a list of applicants.
@NBCNightlyNews @KellyO Another investigation that went no where.
@SenSanders Describe American?
@GOPChairwoman @LaraLeaTrump Even R Kelly had supporters while he was standing trial. Today those same supporters are ashamed I bet. They cared more about a racial win than they did about the girls being victimized.
@SenMarkey As your employer (tax paying citizen) I agree just don't make me pay for it.
@RealJamesWoods @Gillette Crap will be crap. Its a marketing play. Watch how much they push this when we start injecting our kids with crap that prevents facial hair.
@AyannaPressley SMH. What was he thinking. Or not thinking.
@SenFeinstein Is it our emissions or the worlds?
@kaitlancollins That's ur job. Right?
@TitaniaMcGrath Think u need god to help u with this one.
@ewarren @BHCCBoston Effing Nachos and Cheese
@AP Who pays for that?
@WesleyLowery @keithboykin Can we get a list of applicants?
@SenFeinstein So once you guys beef up the ports with the new technology you have been talking about what are these guys do? Just call it a day?
@AOC Miss this AOC. Now she sounds like the rest of them with Russia and Racism.
@KimKardashian He doesn't owe anyone shit. Especially an explanation.
@AOC They want more pay and smaller classrooms. Wonder why the classrooms are jammed up.
@ezralevin @AOC Is this another @Acosta moment? Senators are getting bombarded with calls to build the wall?
@keithboykin How is it no one clubbed that guy after.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are you sure you trust a Russian asset with this task.
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump I 100% blame Trump and 100% stand behind him.
@mkraju Literally straight to the trash when I get them.
@RandyRainbow Never heard of the guy
@BrianKarem All over the world? How do you know? Didn't think we were allowed to ask.
@keithboykin 99% of Americans wouldn't even know a wall was there.
@HerestheFuture LOL. ISIS is trashing our national parks because of the shut down.
@BobsBlitz @Columbia1938 When no one is monitoring the Nat Parks ISIS is trashing them. "We don't know whats happening in the parks when no one is there....whats happening"
@PRWeekUS @Columbia1938 SMH. He just did an interview on CNBC and thinks the gov shut down is allowing ISIS to get into the parks because they aren't being monitored.
@katierogers Whites without college degrees. Thanks for putting me in my place.
@ddale8 @maggieNYT Couldn't u research and report? Or do you just wait for the news to come to u?
@JohnBrennan Then ask why are we asking this now when this happened last year.
@LeaderHoyer @senatemajldr Another CR to avoid the issue.
@Lawrence Didn't someone ask trump tho?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump What caused them to ask the question?
@sahilkapur @AOC Does any of it involve actually doing any work for behalf of their districts?
@RepMaxineWaters Yes, who were the applicants and what was the hiring process.
@RepDianaDeGette @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump If I had ur job I would 1) Request a list of all federal employees in my district. 2) Request it be updated and delivered the 1st of the month. 3) Identify the individuals and begin a campaign to reach out to evaluate assistance needs. 4) Implement plan for future shutdowns.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump So you said it in 2016 and you didn't know if it was true?
@PreetBharara The question is stupid because u are all hanging ur hat on a story that should have been out already and now u look desperate.
@NatashaBertrand I completely agree with Trump the whole thing is a hoax and part of it is for reasons like this Natasha. Im sitting here (with a brain in my head) thinking how come none of these idiots (not u now) haven't brought this up before. It look desperate all coming out now.
@JonLemire Well how many times does he need to answer the same stupid question over and over.
@jaketapper The real hero's. Very sad.
@RepRalphNorman @Jim_Jordan @dcexaminer I hate we get stuck in the middle of all this. This shouldn't even be an issue at this point in our lives. Should have been done forever ago.
@BillKristol @Lawrence Now u guys are using Bezos to attack T.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Swalowell has spoken.
@NHFCR @GovernorSununu @UNHCRs @SNHUCR @SaintAnselmCR @KSCRepublicans @PSURepublicans @EddieEdwardsNH @Negron4Congress @GovChrisSununu @GraniteGrok Biden is a front runner because he has a "long political list of IOUs"...Exactly what is wrong and why we voted trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Haha. He's right
@keithboykin Is that me?
@RepMaxineWaters Looks like Chuck and Nancy let u start tweeting
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump How many people polled?
@RealCandaceO @SenWarren @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer We have been called names too when we choose to think for ourselves. Glad this is finally happening.
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Please reopen it so I dont have to hear Ted whine anymore and we can see what he is gonna do for us instead of safe tweeting.
@RepMaxineWaters Maybe the real issue is these gov employees are 1 paycheck away from a homeless shoeless existence.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You lost me a congress gets to decide.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Well we could pay for it buy shaving some $ we use for a bunch bullshit all over the world.
@RealCandaceO This guy known what the vast majority of the country is thinking? That's amazing.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump But they still want the wall??
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Playing it safe as usual teddy.
@AOC If "everything" wasn't racist this would stand out more.
@jeffzeleny @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump U mean the 900 or so people polled?
@briahsdad @CarlHeastie @KarinesReyes87 @CnDelarosa @rubendiazjr @AOC @galeabrewer @Fernandez4NY @nynurses @BronxZoo @BronxDAClark I don't recall her running around talking about impeaching the pres and jumping on the dem bandwagon when she was running. She doesn't need to use the Russia thing to be relevant like most do. She's got the goods without it. I was drinking last night. Hope this helps.
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Texting and driving is reckless. King is fucking stupid.
@keithboykin Like it. Need more of it.
@mkraju @maggieNYT She voted for it and plenty of cbp agents have spoken on record this week. Can't see how he loses this if it goes to court.
@soledadobrien @trish_regan U ripped off @aoc. She called this out hours ago.
@briahsdad @CarlHeastie @KarinesReyes87 @CnDelarosa @rubendiazjr @AOC @galeabrewer @Fernandez4NY @nynurses @BronxZoo @BronxDAClark I'm talking about before she was elected. "Didn't get where she is" meant getting elected.
@wolfblitzer @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump We are looking ahead 2 years...not 2 years back. Yes he lied technically. Is that what u need to hear. I didn't care. I kinda knew it was a trigger quote that apparently still works today on u guys.
@SenGaryPeters Yawn...what else u got
@TulsiGabbard Here is why u lose and how a lot more of u will lose down the road. U are running for office yet u havent responded to any question and if u look at the comments there are a lot.
@APCentralRegion @AP Call it what it is and let him fight it. Still better than bitching out behind a security concern.
@peterbakernyt @sfcpoll @danbalz And that's what we people with a brain call a reverse compliment sandwich of a tweet.
@RealJamesWoods Gender X Generation
@BetoORourke Bait and switch. 15 seconds without commentary and we are supposed to know what's really going on. Why no thoughts of ur own? Stop making this our problem. We pay u guys for it to u be ur problem.
@TulsiGabbard @VanJones68 U should be president because u said the same thing everyone else has. I'm dumb so u got my vote. Cmon. What else u got.
@AOC @aoc don't think outside the box think around it. U can accomplish anything u want. What is ur vision?
@trish_regan @aoc and @realDonaldTrump lets get them back.
@AOC Next steps? Last action 1/10 and what is the diff between sponsor and co-sponsor?
@tracy_walder @BrianKarem What do u recommend? U got my attention with rank but please tell me u have more thoughts than rejecting "having an acting Sec of Def. with NO military experience and a no US envoy to the coalition against ISIS"
@MsPackyetti @AOC I know what it means to me. What does it mean to u?
@WajahatAli @RashidaTlaib @AOC In other words this guy is a no one without name drops.
@jmeacham @peterbakernyt As they puff on their Corn Cob pipes...
@LouDobbs Swamp thing 1 and swamp thing 2. Overstayed their welcome. @AOC and @realDonaldTrump got our backs.
@AOC NO! I'm just getting used to AOC. Stay true to u. Remember the person u were/are in between knocking on doors. U got this.
@trekonomics @AOC Same here. I love AOC but don't like when she follows suit with her superiors.
@anniekarni Imagine that. Not wanting credit for doing what he is supposed to be doing. Its like me wanting credit for making my kids dinner tonight.
@sashaperigo @AOC Great. Can we get her schedule for next week. Actually all the schedules of the people working for us with our tax $.
@APEntertainment @AP @Lifetime We should deport this trash of a man to the darkest corners of the earth.
@kathygriffin @AOC They are draining the swamp. @realDonaldTrump and @aoc are the best elected officials that every happened to the disgrace we call our government.
@VeraMBergen @maggieNYT That looks more like the line at the airport. Where is the line of the workers at the food pantry?
@maggieNYT Why should we care? Why wasn't this important last summer. Makes no sense.
@maggieNYT What did he say?
@JohnBoardCT @MiaBLove @VanJones68 @VanJones68 are u still looking for people to "video" in their commentary?
@Mediaite @JesseBWatters I think he is and if you noticed @AprilDRyan has had a change in her tone recently. In this political landscape real reporters remember why they got into this biz.
@citizen6379 @clairecmc No one. U wanna book me?
@GeoffRBennett @maggieNYT @PressSec @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump I might take this serious if these questions were asked last summer. Ill call BS bringing it up now.
@AOC I don't understand anything about American politics but I know one thing im not gonna listen to any politician try to tell me "what's its like"
@KFILE Thank god only politicians and important people are judged based on what they thought in 2000s
@CNNSitRoom @tomfriedman Just so inspirational...Love the "through a looking glass" part. Its so real. Sometimes I cant handle how real it is.
"Brings hope to" Can u explain in more detail?
@Sifill_LDF @keithboykin How is he able to do this then? "Dangerous &amp; Frightening abuse of power" Why are we allowing this?
@stevenleemyers @maggieNYT Over the past 2 years? As A NYT reporting this is just news now?
@clairecmc I bet I would be a better commentator.
@AOC In my opinion I think the "brown lady says a curse word" got the attention it did because it was the first thing she was really known for in a viral sort of way. The work and difference she makes is what we should be judging all of guys one.
@WhooDat4 @Wakeupsheep2 @IlhanMN I know. Glad u called out that nonsense.
@McFaul @keithboykin Excellent. Can u fwd me all ur notes on these meetings or direct me to where I can find them?
@AOC @CBSNews How were they chosen? Was there an application process? Did they hire from within first? Im with u @AOC but before I sink my paws in I have to have more info.
@ryanstruyk @maggieNYT Why is "then pivots to comey" in ()
@PhilipRucker Declines? Can u be more specific
@keithboykin Then they should all be removed from office. Actually maybe they should.
@keithboykin Boink, just because u said (sarcastically/not denying charge) doesn't mean anything. If u are gonna report just report what's being said. Save the gossip shit for the breakroom.
@keithboykin @existentialfish LOL. Ill give it to you here Boink.
@WhooDat4 @Wakeupsheep2 @IlhanMN LOL. I have to agree with u @WhooDat4. Was being serious with my question to @IlhanMN. Much love to her getting to where she is but its what she is gonna do to stay and make a difference is what im looking for.
@briahsdad @CarlHeastie @KarinesReyes87 @CnDelarosa @rubendiazjr @AOC @galeabrewer @Fernandez4NY @nynurses @BronxZoo @BronxDAClark She joined in on the whole Russia thing in another tweet at the same time all the establishment dems are doing it. Just wanted her to stay true to her roots. She didn't get where she is pushing Russian Collusion.
@TheOnion Finally some news we can all relate to. Nothing beats this scenario.
@Santucci @maggieNYT As the senior editorial producer of ABC News this is what u are thinking about. Why don't u get ur ass to the border and talk to some CBP agents or find some collusion. Must be nice just waiting for the news to come to u. Ur a hair band...im Nirvana.
@jaketapper You lost me at "If they are right about his identity" People can read Jake. Cmon guy
@washingtonpost An analyst from the fix! You know that news outlet.
@brianklaas So if the debate happened today she would win?
@JCBua I would be happy to volunteer @PressSec @realDonaldTrump
@maggieNYT Is it a talking point redux because u say it is? U are in a very important position as a WH correspondent with a very large amount of followers. Shouldn't u just present the facts and let us make our own choices.
@maggieNYT As a WH correspondent do you think u should be pushing ur assumptions?
@maggieNYT @JudgeJeanine @MichaelCohen212 What does that mean working over @MichaelCohen212 ?
@maggieNYT What is shouting to u? What is speeding to u? What is too bright to u? Why should we listen to u?
@maggieNYT Which prosecutors? Any in the world? If u can name them ill buy it.
@maggieNYT U didn't tag him. @GeorgeWBush can you answer Maggies Tweet so it doesn't unanswered.
@maggieNYT What's the ??? mean?
@kaitlancollins Speaking of scheduled meetings. What are these guys doing next week. U must have a schedule set up weeks in advance as do I. I'm not a reporter but u are so can u find out what each of these house/senate individuals have going on next week. I can call if its easier.
@SenJackReed Why do you think he isn't doing that?
@IlhanMN What are ur accomplishments in this first week. What are ur goals for next week and where do you u see urself in 2 years.
@AnnCoulter Ann. Calling it a wall is like calling a flight attendant a stewardess. Lets evolve and move on.
@keithboykin If this is true the FBI is the biggest waist of $ in the history of this country. If its not true then u are the biggest waist of time I have ever spent in the history of reading tweets.
@RealOmarNavarro I love snoop but I could care less what he thinks of me.
@CarlHeastie @KarinesReyes87 @CnDelarosa @rubendiazjr @AOC @galeabrewer @Fernandez4NY @nynurses @BronxZoo @BronxDAClark Cant take @aoc seriously anymore. She joined the swamp.
@LouisaS59 @VanJones68 @TulsiGabbard Why would you vote for her. Gimme 3 reasons quick/fast.
@AOC Remember trump hasn't changed his message since getting elected to "please" the establishment...you just did. I am very disappointed.
@AOC @Aoc you just officially became part of the swamp. How did this happen. Did you think you would be talking about this when u were knocking on doors or did u just do what they all do. LIE
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted can u provide me with ur schedule for next week? I would like to see what my tax $ is paying u to do? I think you all should provide this info. Its standard in any business to provide these details when asked.
@votevets Good luck evicting anyone. Its takes forever. What else u got.
@AsteadWesley @maggieNYT Why is she ur first choice?
@perlmutations @BrianKarem Would you be in Newsweek if you didn't mention Trump? NO! SOA was like 10 years ago. What else you got.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Russian Asset is the word of the week per the establishment. Ted has no brain of his own. I hope @AOC doesn't follow the swamp.
@dave_lapointe Dave I listened to you on that KC Colts game and lost. How can I trust you on anything you say.
@keithboykin @senatemajldr Maybe he should run for prez boink.
@AOC Drain the swamp AOC. Join Trump. F these idiots.
@RepJayapal you are welcome to ur own opinion but when you refer to my nieces and nephews as "folks of color" I personally am offended by that. You need to check urself before u lump my family into ur craziness. The wall is for them too. Damn girl. https://t.co/Ua2KVq3tsM
@TitaniaMcGrath Looks like the waze directions to my house.
@BrianKarem Wow Brian. How do you do it. Just amazing reporting. Where can I dump a bunch of $ to get the degree you have?
@keithboykin Wow he really bent over backwards boink.
@dave_lapointe Same here. We have a lot in common now.
@JohnAvlon @RepSwalwell @politico That is interesting. What did it say?
@PostRoz @PhilipRucker @gregpmiller Its so easy to predict the next talking point. Do you think anyone paying attention doesn't see it. We all used twitter way before u tried to weaponize it.
@TitaniaMcGrath He is White. How can we trust him.
@thenation AOC you are better than this. Who is "the nation"
@markberman @PhilipRucker That no one will care about come Monday.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Please show me evidence he is swallowell.
@SenJackReed and thing could go one the same way you like it...easy.
@ARobTwit @AOC She could stick it to the man without being in congress. She also has to produce.
@jonfavs She directed her cursing towards an individual and it was her first public statement (maybe not intended public). That's the best I can offer.
@RepAnthonyBrown What are you working to do?
@MiaFarrow This must be Mia's "app for that"
@JillWineBanks @Lawrence @merce2me @MalcolmNance @LawProfButler @maddow @HechtCs @vegasbanks @robreiner For what?
@dave_lapointe Can u take back my $50 too.
@dbongino I could care less about the MF comment just as I could care less about trumps comments. Its the follow thru and followup I look at.
@ryanstruyk @jaketapper I agree but what about the people who voted for him.
@DavidLimbaugh @AnnCoulter She forgot makeup.
@VanJones68 @TulsiGabbard @CNN I didn't know you had a show.
@GottaLaff @tedlieu Give 3 reasons why that benefit you and me directly...
@susavestheworld @tedlieu At least he is at his desk.
@JDiamond1 @maggieNYT I always know times are desperate when u guys start talking about Russia.
@RepAdamSchiff Until?...so that means u get it back!
@RepLBR @SenatorCarper @ChrisCoons Blunt &amp; Joint caught my attention. Didnt read this tho.
@TitaniaMcGrath My temperature is up.
@IlhanMN How is it every single dem is saying the same thing. U didn't need Chuckles and Nan to get here. Add water for instant swamp.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Doubtful Ted. Anyone with a brain not drenched in swampshit would see. Most voted for it in past. CBP agents have spoken. I know Chuckles and Nan are handing out the talking points but u should try thinking for urself.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI Yes a Russian asset became prez in the biggest hoax of the century thru Facebook ads.
@keithboykin A police officer, a communications graduate, a 2x marathon runner/personal trainer...likely wont come back to life when the government reopens.
Couldn't help it https://t.co/A0l9YVjuTn
@TheRightMelissa @AnnCoulter Atta girl!
@LeaderHoyer @HouseSBCDems @NydiaVelazquez They cant keep employees either because of the wage minimums going up.
@KamalaHarris @keithboykin Kamala you sound very Presidential.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I agree...Lets shave a bil off the $ we are sending to all these other countries.
@RealJamesWoods Jim is at best a youtube wannabee. All he has to do is post pics of himself rolling around on the floor with kittens. It works for everyone else.
@JordtheGiant @realDonaldTrump Really? What is the murderers name?
@maggieNYT The CBP agents have been pretty consistent...no fact check...no acknowledgement.
@PhilipRucker @DavidNakamura Its about time. They have been on record all week and you guys are just ignoring them.
@ByronTau @maggieNYT The CBP agents on Tuesday : WE need a wall.	The CBP agents on Thursday: WE need a wall.		SILENCE...
@SenGaryPeters Not one person has denied what the CBP agents have all said live on TV a bunch of times this past couple weeks. Why?
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @KUSINews And they omit what the CBP says.
@AprilDRyan Never heard of her.
@IlhanMN Because it congress who should be making the laws. That's you! I haven't heard one idea from u or u listen to one cbp agent.
@keithboykin Which helps the people boink
@VP No reporters are interviewing or fact checking the CBP agents. Why?
@RepKClark @OMBPress I hope you are doing more than just a tweet...if this is true. Also she can go to NYC...FREE EVERYTHING!! WEEEEEEEEEEE
@kaitlancollins Its true. He shouldn't have to in this case. If he was trying to deport people that don't deserve it that would be an abuse of power and I personally wouldn't allow that but lets use our heads with the border.
@kaitlancollins They shouldn't have left. They are all a joke.
@BrookeBCNN I'm with you on that.
@SenFeinstein What would?
@SenFeinstein So same ole tale. Do the safe easy stuff and delay the tough decisions, which is why we are here in the first place.
@cmclymer @AOC AOC is awesome! She should work with Trump and come up with some good ideas.
@SusannahLuthi Good. Now we can hear direct rather than ur "spin"
@LEBassett @AOC I'm a conservative man and I think she is awesome.
@LeaderHoyer What about shaving a bit off the billions we are sending to other lands.
@lisamurkowski Maybe u guys shouldn't be getting paid to do nothing.
@gracenapolitano Ur right. We should cut the aid to other countries
@ewarren I'm with u on this Liz! That's it so far.
@GovMikeHuckabee Cuz they are all garbage
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Ur trying to clean up after Jim
@SebGorka Those immoral racists!
@Jim_Jordan @RepKatieHill Finally someone not entrenched in swamp weeds.
@keithboykin F'ing white people.
@BrianKarem Why won't u interview the cbp agents?
@kaitlancollins Kaitlan how come none of u guys interview the cbp agents?
@dave_lapointe @Pittdawg12 I was devastated. It was great last year.
@TheRevAl @AOC What is it?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted why aren't you challenging the border agents who have spoken out the last week or so?
@Dean_the_human @SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump You would have thought a news channel would have known that. Thanks for info. Interesting but makes sense.
@keithboykin How many planes crashed?
@Acosta @PressSec Jim we didn't see that on video.
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump No, he talked to the border agents instead. Do you know what they said?
The fake news wont fact check these border agents for some reason. https://t.co/mpXWpum8h5
@CNNSitRoom @Acosta What did the border agents say? Its like you guys are ignoring them for some reason.
@WhiteHouse Its interesting no one is fact checking these agents. Wonder why?
@abc13houston @SenTedCruz @jaketapper @BrookeBCNN @brikeilarcnn @DanaPerino @Acosta can u guys fact check this for us?
@jaketapper @kaitlancollins @TheLeadCNN I'm not a judge but if a majority of congress approved the fence act in the past coupled with what the border patrol agents have communicated recently what is the defense? TDS?
@jaketapper @jrpsaki @KSoltisAnderson @JamalSimmons @KevinMaddenDC @TheLeadCNN Jake how come you guys never "fact check" any of the several Border Patrol Agents who have spoken out these last couple weeks?
@RepGraceMeng @realDonaldTrump I would say he has a strong case. Most of congress has voted for this in the past &amp; not to mention the border agents are on record saying they are for it, which everyone is ignoring for some reason.
@AyannaPressley I can live with the R word. I may have said "don't be R"...but the important thing as a Trump supporter is I don't want to deport anyone unless its deserved.
@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump I heard a TSA agent on CNN today say they are not happy but they are showing up and doing their job just the same???? WHO DO I BELIEVE!!!
@BreitbartTexas @AnnCoulter I don't believe anything until Rachel Madcow reports it.
@RadioBoston @RepJoeKennedy @joekennedy Yes we heard him say the same thing like a million times.
@fubarnator @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz I just called out @jaketapper @DanaPerino &amp; @brikeilarcnn for omitting that part from their "news". Talk about sick people.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump AHHHH Teddy! The border talk isn't working anymore. God you guys are so easy.
@jaketapper @DanaPerino @brikeilarcnn how come you didn't air the CBP agent briefing the viewers on who they apprehended the last couple of days? Sneaky
#GOJIMGO https://t.co/7W3KLlAY2j
@ElizLanders @IlhanMN So how does open borders help us? Maybe we should pause for a minute n' a half and regroup things here.
@kaitlancollins @PhilipRucker Uh-oh. Big shift in the news coming out of you guys. CPB just squashed u all.
@BrookeBCNN @brikeilarcnn Darn, guess I have to go easy on you today. Feel better.
@SparkEquity @AyannaPressley Grew up in Meffa MA. Go to any job site or landscaping crew or Mexican restaurant (my fav) in and around the city and you will hear from the "workers" they want the wall simply because they don't want someone coming and doing their job for a buck fifty less.
@CNNnewsroom @CNN @Acosta How is it no one is interviewing the CPB agents while you are down there. Are they lying too?
@gracenapolitano Maybe the CBP who just spoke is in on it too. I'm very confused. Is this real or not.
Thank you @Acosta. You are earning that paycheck finally. https://t.co/zgDmr0SxCk
@LindseyGrahamSC @Acosta GOJIMGO!!!
@jaketapper Jake, in all this time you guys haven't been down to the border to interview the CBP agents? WHY?
@keithboykin Now we like this guy?
@seanhannity Oh boy. Here comes the insanity.
@IlhanMN How come u guys don't listen to the border security folks at the border. Do you think they are lying?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Kim Jung Un is prob easier to deal with.
@SenWarren @IHSgov @SenateGOP What are ur plans for the border if u are elected in 2020
@JohnCornyn @HARRISFAULKNER Good. I think this along with term limits will make a big difference.
@kylieatwood @maggieNYT @SecPompeo Well if u don't kno...the bad guys don't kno either. See what I'm getting at?
@IvankaTrump Happy bday J
@keithboykin I don't even know what a white supremacist is boink.
@tedlieu Well then Bob M should be putting the cuffs on soon.
@IlhanMN I will if you lay out ur plan for border security and immigration ideas.
RT @realDonaldTrump: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@AOC The media is awful.
@SpeakerPelosi I wish @SpeakerRyan had worked as hard as u do.
@AC360 @jaketapper @MarkWarner Inappropriateness is a crime too. Notify CNN immediately.
@msdaisycat @AOC Reminds me of Roslindale MA 2003. Love it
@maggieNYT Why u believe everything else.
@allinwithchris @chrislhayes @RepJerryNadler Walls?
@eliseviebeck @jaketapper Did u ask how?
@billmaher Finally u said something that makes sense.
@chrislhayes But u guys said his campaign was a joke and he would never win.
@SenRonJohnson Triple decker tweets are like a thousand knives in my eyes.
@ewarren Haha good luck with that
Why I hate politicians https://t.co/jvjkuxF9ee
@keithboykin Who pays?
@AOC U have a boyfriend!! Heartbroken :(
@JerryDunleavy @jaketapper In my "family" ur only as good as ur last envelope. Screw this pos if he did this.
@NutmegRadio @AOC I'm a middle aged white male and I think her biggest challenges are going to come from within her own party.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @cspan What was in the bill?
@FixPuertoRicoUS @KatrinaPierson @AOC That would be too much work. It's easier to resist Trump to get noticed.
@RepMikeQuigley @NWSNHC So u are saying we should build a dome?
@RealJamesWoods @KatrinaPierson Imagine that. A politician doing what they said they would do.
@chrislhayes Do u really care? It's a story u dug deep to break.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Dont they have their own presidents?
@SenFeinstein How did the camp fire start?
@keithboykin @kroger @mrsgilliam11 Finally boink. Good call reposting this.
@TitaniaMcGrath I can't do it because eventually I would stop following my soul mate...you.
@universityofky @AprilDRyan No wonder why she has cleaned up her act lately.
@SenBlumenthal I trust what a Vietnam hero says.
@SenFeinstein Triple decker tweets are often ignored.
@jaketapper He prob cant stand for more than 15 min.
@jaketapper Its so funny to see these guys say this. You either know or you don't. She is waiting on further instructions from Chuck and Nancy is the real answer. She is NO AOC.
@KamalaHarris Past performance is no indicator for future results.
@douglasemhoff @jaketapper I may not agree with a lot of her politics but its nice to see this. We should all get to have a moment like this!
@RealJamesWoods Of course he wont run. Would be too hard and he wouldn't make it past first base.
@daveweigel @jaketapper @AOC AOC has her own swamp to drain.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump People are not bargaining chips. Regardless of where they come from.
@davidhogg111 @AOC @maddow I didn't. What did he say was racist?
@RobertMaguire_ When newer equipment is installed to catch these guys bringing it in thru the ports what do u think they will do?
@amber_athey @CNN @jimsciutto They don't like when we learn how this works.
@soukieg @keithboykin Reality checker....didnt have the super majority in Senate. We are learning....which means ur all in big trouble now.
@AOC I think it's a shame and I voted for Trump.
@racdp @AOC I like you AOC and I voted for trump. What am I? A hybrid racist? I cant find what category I belong in. Please help.
@IlhanMN What happened in 2016 that made that line trend down so fast?
@chrislhayes It has to be true if you said it Chris.
I hope once this is over these Fed employees get a raise because its terrible if they are all 1 paycheck away from homelessness, bankruptcy, hunger, no xmas presents etc. Its the least you can do for using them the last 2 weeks. https://t.co/JZ7wWSuFBo
@BrookeBCNN Thanks for fact checking trump on 90% of the heroine coming through the southern border. You said he was wrong because its coming through the legal ports of entry.
@keithboykin Haha. U can't call him a liar there.
@AOC What does it mean that he won?
@bkcrabtree I try.
@BrianKarem @ABC Not a clicker. Gimme the bullet points.
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump "end a crisis he created" wherer have I heard this one before?
@NoahShachtman @maggieNYT Which Union?
@SenGaryPeters Mom is that u? Oh sorry Gary...i assume its my mom when I see a triple decker tweet.
@SenTedCruz Whats the update with el chapos $. Lets put that $ to work.
@BrianKarem @KellyannePolls Bri, ur TDS is acting up kid
@IlhanMN I will sign if you tell me what ur idea is to resolve the issue.
@BrianKarem @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Maybe? I expect more from someone in ur position. Maybe????
@blockbuster Because I joined less than a month ago.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Is chuck wearing contacts.
@AyannaPressley I may not be in congress but I'm from Mass Mr Trump and I still got ur back.
@LeaderHoyer @realDonaldTrump Sorry we kept you awake only for you to repeat urself over and over and over....
@votevets @tedlieu @RepTedLieu I felt bad because you only had 3 comments. Thats why im here.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You guys nailed it!!! Please run for President.
@MSNBC @AOC She is absolutely right! So what is her IDEA!!!
@greggutfeld I called that one out too! Its like groundhog day...their tweets are the same as yesterday. Guess they don't get the daily talking point memos when the guv shuts down.
@tedlieu You got any new facts? I feel like I just watched the same Jeopardy episode 7 days in a row?
@JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes Very good Joy. Thank you for getting into the trenches for us each and every day.
@RepGraceMeng @realDonaldTrump Well said Grace. Are you guys hiring? Seems like a no brainier to send the same tweet everyday.
@BradSherman You and my mom are the only ones with a triple decker tweet on my screen brah
To ALL communities in MA!!! Full disclosure i'm a white dude. Does it still sound good. https://t.co/2xhjLp7Tuf
@RepJoeKennedy @RepJoeKennedy , this is the appropriate use of the word "lied"...but in everyday life you should avoid using it if you want to be taken seriously.
@keithboykin Thought u were fact checking?
@keithboykin Best fact checking tweet of what was said tonight goes to u so far.
@tedlieu That's a waist of forward thinking. Time to POGO bro.
@tedlieu @VP @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS U sound like a broken record at this point. Haven't they handed out the new talking points yet!! Its Tuesday!....oh prob not cuz the gov is shut down.
@RepSwalwell What are ur original ideas? Are you flexible? Can you compromise/work with ur peers for a reasonable and beneficial outcome. I am applying for jobs at the moment in the Boston area and most jobs require these basic skills. What makes ur job different. Asking as ur 1/1024th boss.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Ill take "What does @BrianKarem look like when he is reaching" for $1000 Alex. Hoping for dummy double........
@Redpainter1 @KellyannePolls @Acosta They are prob BFF on the inside. Did he Tweet this?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump HAHA Thats it?? You got burnt tonight and thats all you care about.
@IlhanMN Something tells me at one time in ur life you would have considered 56 a gross and unacceptable number...you would have insisted on zero and done whatever it took to get there...now?
@Acosta I genuinely feel bad for you.
@EricSchultz They want those ratings. Without ratings they do not exist. Without trump they have no ratings.
@adamcbest Didn't watch but how many times did Geraldo say "we have tomatoes dying on the vine"
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump U said this over xmas but I'm learning this week would be the first missed paycheck. Which is it?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Are we back to this again?
@SarahKSilverman Whats the truth then?
@CarolineBehr The message is "we want the ratings"
@RepJoeKennedy There is a red flag that goes up anytime a Kennedy uses "lied" 4 times in one tweet.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump I donated!
@RobertMaguire_ If I had a brain in my head....and I do...I would sit back read what u wrote and think about this..what will the people bringing in drugs/people/whatever do when we upgrade ports of entry? Ill give you 3 chances to come up with the correct answer.
@kimguilfoyle It shouldn't be a "want". It shouldn't be a discussion. It SHOULD have been taken care of already way before you and I were born.
@SenFeinstein If you look up TDS in the dictionary ur tweet would be a perfect description. Its like ur saying "HA GOTCHA DONALD its only 300,000 unauthorized crossings"
@AnnCoulter BAD ANN! They get a pass BUT NOT THEIR ENTIRE BLOODLINE.
@jaketapper I hope she lives forever. I cant take anymore end of the world talk if she steps down.
@IlhanMN A bit extreme. I heard the children come alone in a lot of cases. What do you recommend we do? I hear your opposition but the job you took requires solutions too.
@BrookeBCNN @AprilDRyan As far as we know though has anyone missed a check yet or would this week be the first week?
@Acosta @AOC &amp; crew...you have ur own swamp to drain right here.
@keithboykin I agree but I would also agree if you took out the colors in ur tweet.
@RepAdamSchiff Because it was u and all the other clowns job to say it.
@AOC Not a monument at all. Just common sense. Its not like people are going to see it everyday on the way to work.
@SenFeinstein Why are we trapped in the middle of this. How is it you guys haven't fixed the whole system years ago. This is why we have Trump. No one ever listened.
@maggieNYT Covering urself
@TimRunsHisMouth @SebGorka Damn whoop! Bout time.
@ggreenwald @DineshDSouza Just like their sophisticated election interference...i.e.facebook ads.
@snarkasonne @KenDilanianNBC Says who. I think that is equally important. I offered  to move my office into the local high-school and train for emergency situations in the case of an active shooter.
@NolanDMcCaskill @AOC One thing I learned from all this is fed workers make shit since every one of them is living paycheck to paycheck apparently.
@NateSilver538 @keithboykin What else did she say that was newsworthy?
@ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @foxnewsnight I like ur show because u have a way of delivering information that isn't sided one way or another. Classy and professional.
@juliehdavis They love it.
@PhilipRucker @PaulSonne I'm sure there is plenty of fat to trim.
@KenDilanianNBC Lol u are handing trump what he wants. 6 is a crisis. 1 is a crisis and that's what we know of. Bravo!
@Rambobiggs @RealOmarNavarro Amen
@LarrySabato Great! He was all for border security
RT @GOP: Want the FACTS on border security? 		Get the TRUTH here ⬇️	https://t.co/Uz1xWo5PPL
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump So we shouldn't be afraid of 6? What about the ones that weren't caught?
@jeffmason1 @Acosta @RussVought45 But CNN said they wouldn't. Who do I believe?
@seanhannity He's realizing he is becoming obsolete since a new class of whacko's were elected.
@SecNielsen @JohnCornyn @DHSgov I didn't think people fleeing from gang violence and unimaginable conditions had travel patterns.
@keithboykin When the gov reopens maybe they should give all these workers more money. Surprised no one ever cared about them before.
@keithboykin We don't need them. Let everyone thru
@IlhanMN What will work?
@MillerKimball1 @APCentralRegion @AP In otherwords they are both idiots in the first place. The color of their skin did not factor into my original analysis.
@clairecmc Isn't the real issue the ones we don't know about? What number works for you that will justify beefing things up....how many terrorists???
@PhilipRucker I would say those 2 kids dying on the way here is a crisis. What do u call it?
@AOC @PolitiFact Yes it would be nice to see how all these news outlets decide for us on a daily basis.
@AOC I'm curious what ur thoughts are on border security and how u would handle security.
@RealCandaceO Get em O! Love u
@TitaniaMcGrath If I do it and they still let me on the plane will u pick me up at the airport and go have coffee with me?
@IlhanMN I like that u aren't swearing to get attention.
@keithboykin She did what I hope any 16 yo would do in that situation.
@APCentralRegion @AP They both should have been shot based on the information in this article.
@LMegaparsec @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Sorry. I'm a bit off u could say. I just emerged from a bunker because I thought the world was gonna burn to the ground when we pulled out of the Paris agreement. Now I'm going back in because planes are going to start falling from the sky.
@keithboykin @NFL I'll do karaoke. Problem solved.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Not since my honeymoon in 2010.		https://t.co/mlSB7RH9GR

@AyannaPressley Still waiting on what ideas you are going to bring. So far twitter talk.
@maggieNYT Yes because we want it and he listens.
@SpeakerPelosi Yes from Congress not the border.
@BryanDeanWright Does she have any ideas? Aside from video what is her message. What does she want to accomplish. So far sounds like she won based on identity and being anti trump. Too bad.
@kimguilfoyle Should be hundreds of thousands. This is what the American Dream looks like when it backfires because of stupid people and their policies.
@TitaniaMcGrath I'm here eating bark off a tree planted in organic soil to show my level of commitment. How many McDonald's do I need to burn to the ground before u can overlook my shortcomings?
@IlhanMN As long as they can back it up with fresh ideas and results that benefit the people - Ed Croce
@VanJones68 Van u are a good person! Able to put what's good over ur dislike for T. Wish there were more good people like u.
@SarahPalinUSA Sarah I can't wait to see u back in the game in 2020!
@KatrinaPierson This is what u get with identity politics. No real substance or ideas.
@SenKamalaHarris @AprilDRyan Do people still buy this sound/good feel good statements that used to get votes?
@Reporterroblang @AprilDRyan I call collusion! She got Nancy's ear after they were walking away. Next she is called on by Trump with a great question. They are taking the temp down. Dems kno the wall is coming so Trump is working with them to soften the blow.
@TitaniaMcGrath I love u and I love Trump. Where do we go from here?
@realDailyWire @tedcruz Please make it happen.
@realDailyWire @tedcruz Please make it happen.
@keithboykin He did it before being elected big difference.
@RobertMaguire_ Why don't u post what he did say and let us decided for ourselves. Made sense to me.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump At least he said it BEFORE he was elected.
@AURNOnline @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS April is back! No more gotcha questions or angry tones. Welcome back to journalism!!

@jeffleins As long as the tantrums and lies are in line I can live with it. I can't stomach anymore "I won't sleep until there are no more hungry babies" garbage these guys recycle. I guess I'm anti establishment.
@Viscous_cree @julieturkewitz @maggieNYT @MitchKSmith @SenWarren No true. I mostly admonish home grown white trash and try to use common sense thinking when it comes to LEGAL immigration. U got me on the military issues but I try not to comment on those issues. The example u used was me loving on Sarah.
@jeffleins I would rather he lose on substance than change his message for votes.

@ConnieSchultz @Lawrence Yes treat her as the unlikable candidate that she is.
@TheOnion I hope it never does. Maybe give them a broken compass that sends them back into Mexico is a haply medium.
@chrislhayes No one will be talking about her by the end of the week
@BernieSanders B, we effed up by bringing cupcakes into school every day for an entire month for our kids bdays. This will end much worse.
@TitaniaMcGrath Damn girl. U might be on to something.
@TitaniaMcGrath If I could delete 1 tweet.....
@AsteadWesley What's O gonna grab on?
@TitaniaMcGrath What's the last one mean?
@kanyewest U got my vote
@BernieSanders There is also no struggle if everything is free.
@TitaniaMcGrath @louisck Well he wasn't at the airport. I'm pretty sure the people that attended wanted to.
@KatMcKinley @dbongino @NikkiHaley Rules are rules. Even tho they didn't follow them.
@TitaniaMcGrath Good lord I think I just fell in love with u.
@AprilDRyan I thought he only attacked African America women? Per ur past comments dear.
@BrianKarem @RealJamesWoods He is in plain site covered in white paint leaning up against the Whitehouse. I can see his eyeballs.
@TitaniaMcGrath I bet when u were a kid someone had to have a side birthday party for u every time it was someone else's birthday party.
@BrianKarem Let me guess..."I touch myself" by the Divinyls dedicated to @realDonaldTrump from outside the oval office.
@SharylAttkisson @dbongino This must make @HillaryClinton feel even worse.
@AnnCoulter Take out the identity keywords (Muslim/Jewish) and they still deserve to be fired.
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter That's retarded. What other ideas u got?
@BrianKarem Dude u need a vacation.
@BrookeBCNN Even u live in the land of opportunity. Plenty of jobs out there. Why keep doing it?
@RealJamesWoods He gonna get #metoo'd if he keeps it up.
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter U have my attention. What are u getting at.
@ewarren Data mining at it's best.
@GovMikeHuckabee As I was reading I was thinking how awesome it would be to freeze and send a supporter some of that goodness and then u mention freezing some. Is that a sign???
@brianstelter Yes ur show hasn't aired yet.
@JATetro @donlemon @BrookeBCNN Yes... a power outage.
@BrookeBCNN It was interesting when u alluded to talking politics goes with the "gig u signed up for"...confirming to me u have always been full of shit. Keep drinking...
@DavidCornDC Haha it has been in all the papers.
Here u go @BrianKarem. Now u have something to spin, dissect, re-write and call urself a journalist. https://t.co/cq5iVYacr7
@realDonaldTrump They are paying for it now by not having a wall.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Ur like one more stalking tweet away from getting #metoo'd. We got ur back T!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Then they will try to say it broke a campaign finance law.
@maggieNYT Yes we do....Trump2020
@seanspicer I missed the Spiceman!
@davesavesyou Nothing much. There is a guy I like named Dave and when I saw the "dave app" I loved it! I also like the app too.
LOL good answer https://t.co/VhP4G6No8H
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Im adding "from the beach" to the end of your statements and tweets.
@campbrobert @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump You don't need a reporter to tell you that! See what I mean.
@SebGorka @MichaelAvenatti Now Now...this is no way to be talking about the former presidential front runner (about 5 min) of the 2020 dem party.
@SebGorka @tedlieu Ted realizes he would literally have nothing to tweet about if it didnt include a dig at our prez.
@RealCandaceO @w_terrence You continue to make me wish I was black! Love it!
@IlhanMN @ewarren I checked out her site. Same snooze of talking points that have been used for years. I'm glad I checked it though before rushing to that judgement. Most wont.

@keithboykin It should be a crime to push market conditions without a series 7.

@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump You are starting to appear more like a stalking boyfriend.
@BrianKarem Who cares. We hear direct from T. Dont need the spin.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Why. He is talking directly to us.
@APCentralRegion @AP Unless u can tie it to trump it won't make news.
@SenatorCantwell I was wondering where the shift would be going now. Is there handbook u guys follow?
@dbongino @ChrisCuomo It's all about the legacy for these guys. That's all they know.
@IlhanMN This idiot does not represent what I stand for even if our political views are different. The voters have made their choice and it should be respected. Congratulations on a solid win!
@dcexaminer I literally just woke up my wife laughing so loud when I saw the date this happened.
@IlhanMN Well if a former Russian intelligence officer said it then it must be true.
@NormEisen @BrianKarem This the same "mounting evidence" that has been mounting for years now. I think Trumper said it best...Absolutely nothing.
@KamalaHarris In other words the gov hires a company who outsources the job. The company will get paid but the actual workers are not gov employees. Think uber for janitors. Uber drivers are not employed by uber.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Hey Liz...remember us in Mass?
@TezlynFigaro @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC Harris isn't banking on her skin color like some of these guys. Talent First. Its my dream to be #olg someday! Keep it going Harris!!

@VanJones68 @cut_50 The next step is for @AprilDRyan to give props to the TEAM who made this possible.
@keithboykin The real tragedy is millions of low paid working Americans have these issues and they ARE receiving a paycheck. I think that slain officer and his fam might be having a worse day. I think this is the 2nd wicked desperate tweet for you today Boinkin.
@SarahPalinUSA Did she win?
@LisaDNews @JeffFlake So 2 weeks after he's toast.
@AOC Awesome! I like it! AOC!!!
@notlarrysabato Did she win?
@RepKClark I'm a non govt employee who is getting paid and I still get advice like this from the banks that have my mortgage car loan and credit cards. Can u be outraged for me too?
@JoyAnnReid @NancyPelosi Did she win
@CQnow @SenatorTester @pennstatetom Didn't like tester because he ruined the good doctor but the voters have spoken and that's what is most important. I wish more people were like me!
@BasilofBakerSt2 @BernieSanders No. Unless u want to. But only if it personally apples.
@charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle Because that will win u a sexist homophobic racist lawsuit. Are u crazy!
@BasilofBakerSt2 @BernieSanders Go on...?
@JimCarrey Do u sell these?
@BernieSanders So if they succeeded why do u guys "use" those issues still for votes.
@MaraGay @Ocasio2018 I like seeing @Ocasio2018 in power but not @NancyPelosi because she wants power so bad.
@SenatorCantwell I'm with u on pre-existing conditions but I don't want to be confused when I go to the doctor and think I'm at the DMV. I'll find insurance to avoid that instead of waiting for it to come to me.
@seanhannity He should be. Let M bring his report.
@SenSanders Where's the chase? The drive!!! Give me free cable or something. Not free everything.
@C_Sommerfeldt @realDonaldTrump @NYDailyNews Another "may have" of "possible crimes"  I may have shit my pants. Care to verify?

@RudyGiuliani @dbongino They all are vacationing with pay. Other govt workers working without. Should be all or none.
@keithboykin 2 red flags "may have" "possible crimes"
@realDonaldTrump It's the fault of the whole govt. This issue should have been figured out years ago vs laying it on us.
@RealCandaceO @SenWarren @Ocasio2018 @BetoORourke Beto has better chance of claiming he is @GaryDelabate's son.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Brian when real issues come up that do not involve trump how are people going to see u as credible journalist.
@Ocasio2018 No no no u were doing so well without bashing trump.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ted I get why every tweet includes Trump but u have a lot of real substance on ur house of reps page that is worth sharing too. Take trump out of the equation and what do u have left?
@maggieNYT @jaketapper Well there are hundreds of thousands of tweets blaming him. At least he showed a little respect by waiting.
@Ocasio2018 and @realDonaldTrump please drain the swamp and let's find a way to make this world a better place for all!
@Ocasio2018 I called into Potus radio today and I said ur name and it didn't sound genuine when I said it. What do ur friends and fam call u?
@Ocasio2018 Don't let them take this away from u. Stay true to what u believe.
@Ocasio2018 Ally I kno zip about politics. I have been consuming about 10-12 hours a day since the escalator ride and I believe in u and @realDonaldTrump. Real progress can be made when both side share a vision. Doesn't have to be the same vision just a vision.
@Ocasio2018 Ally don't fall for this trap. Do ur thing.
@senrobportman @SenBobCorker The only slavery I see is u saying illegal or legal immigrants do the work we dont want to do. Maybe it's the work u don't want to do.
@AprilDRyan So will the #FirstStepAct but u wouldn't kno.
@Ocasio2018 If u and trump ain't a big FU to these guys I don't know what is.
@AprilDRyan Is that all u care about? Did things get better for the people? #FirstStepAct
@Ocasio2018 Dont be fooled by the rocks that she doesn't got. She's still ally from the block.
@AprilDRyan @donlemon There must not be anything in here about the #FirstStepAct otherwise apz wouldnt be retweeting.
@Ocasio2018 Doesnt matter where she grew up. She has a vision which most people wont understand until much later in life
@NikkiSchwab @Acosta @JeffFlake One day u will look back and see how wrong u were
@Ocasio2018 OK guuurl. I am a trump fan because he wasn't part of the stupid establishment. I  don't kno what the difference is between a Republican and a Democrat. All I want to kno is what do ur friends call u? Alex? AC? U are both visionaries and thats the party I want to belong to.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter I never thought Mexico was gonna pay for it just like I never thought there would be a mass deportation of DACA.
@AprilDRyan @kylegriffin1 @msholmes2U @Scaramucci U forgot the #FirstStepAct April.
@tedlieu @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump I heard on the radio one idiot aka congressman was on the house floor but only to bash trump. It has to be u.
@IngrahamAngle McConnell is just as bad. These dummies. What a waist.
@marklevinshow Congress could be working but they are not and still getting paid. The portion of govt that is shut down are working and not getting paid. Common Sense thinking tells me the swamp is more like a sewer.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Or maybe it's what he wanted all along
@LouDobbs @BrianKolfage I thought that was Rachel Maddcow for a second.
@seanhannity Hillary ruined him. He would have won too.
@RyanAFournier @AnnCoulter This must mean he colluded with Russia
@davecatanese @Ocasio2018 I don't care if she cut the cheese. If the idiots in charge (not trump) don't listen we will vote for her just liked we did with @realDonaldTrump. Drain the swamp
@AP @EricTalmadge And why does America care?
@DrDeplorable23 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Not cool and I love trump. Not cool.
@penelope7usa @AnnCoulter Flake is gone so he can't vote for it.
@johngizzi @Acosta @randikayeCNN Why don't u guys try having real people on.
@CNN @AprilDRyan The big blue wave?
@tedlieu Wow over a thousand responses.
@sam_vinograd @CNN Someone give this woman an award!
@Porter_Anderson @AprilDRyan @Acosta @CNNSitRoom @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump They have so much dirt that @AprilDRyan refuses to give props to the #FirstStepAct or she might be colluding. Pathetic girl.
@SenatorCarper @uscoastguard @realDonaldTrump They signed up for the paycheck. Not the honor of the position.
@JessieJaneDuff @SebGorka @ElderGunner @williamelewis46 @casey_cronan @PJayHall2 @s402river @4bustersmom @CNN @MSNBC When hell has no more room the dumb will walk the earth.
@pjsstrong67 I'm more of a @ShannonBream kinda guy but Trish is still a solid hottie.
@BrianKarem U must be stoned cuz u forgot the anti-trump part of the tweet.
@Ocasio2018 @Costa4NY Hopefully only Trump supporting Americans were hurt in this disaster.
@Uncle_Jimbo @SebGorka @washingtonpost @FDRLST U are racist...I don't kno how but I know people with TDS will agree with me.
@OfficeOfMike @SebGorka Yes CNN and crew have a habit of using anyone and anything to attack T-Bone
@cvpayne @SebGorka Much respect for this man! Just read up on him. A true Rockstar
@MaddowBlog @chrislhayes If it's coming from the maddcow camp it has to be true.
@marcorubio Marco it's time to stop playing it safe. What's the impact on AMERICA kid?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted what do u actually have to offer? Do u have any real ideas of ur own or are u simply preying on those who have Trump Derangement Syndrome? At some point u have to actually do some work bro.
@PardesSeleh @TomFitton I'll call bullshit. If it were real they would be screwed for denying u for that reason....Desperate!
@dave_lapointe Yup. Game over
@realDonaldTrump I hate it being an issue for votes. Don't give in! Keep it shut down!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Wow Ted, I didnt realize you guys had already taken a vote.
@IngrahamAngle @CNN They are talking to an immigrant who was released from boarder custody after paying a $10k bond that he had to mortgage his house back in Nicaragua to get? I thought these guys were fleeing awful conditions?
@realDonaldTrump @CNN just exploded. (I know its old)
Sad Sad Sad https://t.co/yinHOxqaAt
@realDonaldTrump Congress is a joke. They want this issue to run on. No common sense. We love you T!!! Keep us safe!
@SenWarren I cant even keep up with the scope of my own life here with my family. I have to believe you don't think we can keep up with all the worlds problems.
@realDonaldTrump I think so because @CNN just had the mayor of El Paso echo a lot of what DHS has been saying but they didnt call him a liar for some reason.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump The mayor of El paso just said a lot of the same on CNN? So is he lying too?
@derekahunter @AnnCoulter @Alyssa_Milano I live in mass. If I could get my family out of harms way in RI why would I travel to California? For warmer winters?
@ananavarro @marcorubio @ScottforFlorida U are right u are not being realistic
@BennettJohnT Real front page news
@jeneps @barbarastarrcnn Amazing report. Edge of our seat stuff.
@ComedySchoolTV1 @Porter_Anderson @AprilDRyan @Acosta @CNNSitRoom @realDonaldTrump I wont pretend to know it all but something tells me the "first step" act is just the first step. I used all my smarts on that one. Time for bed...Exhausted.
@HISTOCHIK @Porter_Anderson @AprilDRyan @Acosta @CNNSitRoom @realDonaldTrump I do care what she has to say but when she goes on and on and ON about racism all the time and then zips it when a bill is signed by @realDonaldTrump that (rightfully so) gives a second chance to predominantly African Americans its hard to ignore lovey.
@Acosta Presumption is the mother of all F'ups.
@Porter_Anderson @AprilDRyan @Acosta @CNNSitRoom @realDonaldTrump Does anyone care what @AprilDRyan has to say anymore? I don't because she hates @realDonaldTrump more than she loves the #FirstStepAct and that shows her true colors.
@marklevinshow When they get like this its a sign of desperation and weakness. They have become so lazy waiting for the (fake) news to come to them they forgot the chase and drive they once had to be reporters.
@AliABCNews @jaketapper At face value this doesnt make sense but im not one to click click click to get to the point. Ill just assume since @jaketapper re-tweeted its a dig at Trump...well done.
@BFinchEsq @BenMathisLilley @chrislhayes @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren Maybe not tho...what do you recommend? Matt Shitaker? Lets help him.
@barbarastarrcnn Who's Bob Hope? I care more about 2064 vs 1964.
@scootrdud @BenMathisLilley @chrislhayes @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren Yes I love Sarah. I look at all her tweets....whats ur excuse for looking at mine?
@scootrdud @BenMathisLilley @chrislhayes @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren I was'nt kidding. I'm ready to call them all out.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump This makes no sense....if the govt was working for us it wouldn't be shut down right now.
@KDORR_USA @SebGorka @NBCNews Then you got @Alyssa_Milano and @Montel_Williams literally coping &amp; pasting without any thoughts of their own.
@BenMathisLilley @chrislhayes I guess this puts him up there with @SenBlumenthal for phony claims of Vietnam and @SenWarren for her Indian heritage.
@Acosta @tamarakeithNPR Meh...kinda desperate Jim. This is something @tedlieu would tweet.
@PressSec Sarah I asked Santa for you to like one of my tweets before 2018 is over...time is running out!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindz only you and my mom's messages go on and on. Stay on point bro. I still love you for the Kav fight but if you kno so much about ISIS why arent they gone yet?
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @POTUS Can u ask/find out what the Ethics Committee said about Rosenstein appointing Mueller after @realDonaldTrump fired @JamesComey45 and the conflict it could have seeing their close relationships in the past???
Love you Sarah! You guys are kickin butt! Keep it up! https://t.co/BMg41QFGyC
@WhipHoyer Yes please include the background too...where they started the journey...why the were coming here...who helped them, costs, who they were with, why they didnt stay in Mexico and anything else that happened before they got here.
@NancyPelosi Yes please include the background too...where they started the journey...why the were coming here...who helped them, costs, who they were with, why they didnt stay in Mexico and anything else that happened before they got here.
@RepAdamSchiff Yes please include the background too...where they started the journey...why the were coming here...who helped them, costs, who they were with, why they didnt stay in Mexico and anything else that happened before they got here.
@JohnCornyn C'mon John you know that wouldnt help their goal to "get" Trump!
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS We are with you all the way T!!
@PoliticalShort @SebGorka She must have had her Pink P Hat down over her eyes.
@SebGorka @Montel_Williams Montel/Milano 2020!!! @Alyssa_Milano you guys got this!
@SebGorka She is the poster child for Trump Derangement Syndrome.
@Alyssa_Milano She cant even delete it because she will look Dumb and Dumber
@seanhannity Turn me into a battery for the matrix.
@BradSherman Solid move! Lets see if the swamp follows.
@BrianKarem Second one. Build wall, make asylum easier for those who NEED it. You can't say that tho cuz it doesn't "get" trump.
RT @Invest420: For those trading #cannabis stocks, today is Boxing Day in Canada, so the market is not open there. $CGC $ACB $APHA
@OfficeOfMike @SebGorka I'm still in a bunker from hearing the world was gonna end when we pulled out of the Paris agreement.
@realDonaldTrump It's 5:30 on Christmas eve and T is at his desk while working while the swamp is out pushing themselves or fake news stories. #T2020
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump So one company actually (over) bills the govt for services and then hires and (under) pays the employee to scrub floors and that's not the real issue here?
@ananavarro @AprilDRyan U must be playing dumb with that tweet
@SenatorCarper No one ever complained about being under budget and maybe with more money he can get a better deal. Ever buy in bulk???
@Invest420 I actually just bought this brand at a local smokeshop to try CBD for the first time and I like it. None if the stores have CW yet.
@WhipHoyer @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Why do we need them? Everyone here loves America and anyone coming in would never do anything wrong...
@greggutfeld U have to be kidding
@ShannonBream Looks like u already drank the first batch.
@SenMarkey @RepTedLieu @POTUS Cmon. U guys would turn it into a political battle while we get nuked.
@realDonaldTrump I'll come visit and tell u the real difference u are making for real everyday people!
@KimKardashian Post a couple closeups and leave the rest for imagination.
@AP Unless u can pin this on trump it's not going to make news.

@IgnatiusPost @barbarastarrcnn What does it mean for us??
@Porter_Anderson @AprilDRyan @FWhitfield @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 @donnaborak The optics??? What does that even mean?
@WhipHoyer @POTUS So u are saying they are gonna accomplish this?
@CNN @AprilDRyan Yes let's hang our hats on bob corker
@Ocasio2018 You are creating the energy trump did and they will try to take it away from u too. Call him and work together. Visionaries don't need experience.
@Jim_Jordan Yup
@AprilDRyan Is that new or effective? No
@SenatorCantwell How much $?
@ValerieJarrett @AprilDRyan The real question is what would u say if they said yes?
@VanJones68 Van I have to say I'm very confused why u keep getting crap for this. TDS is really I guess.
@SenBobCorker @jaketapper @CNNSotu So weird u guys all have time for TV spots but can't get this wall done.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump I tht that's why we put him in office?
@realDonaldTrump We are with u T! Merry Christmas
RT @VanJones68: "This bill is going to help a lot of people, but it's the FIRST STEP Act. I think you're going to see a lot of bills at the…
@SymoneDSanders @AprilDRyan They cut his hair because he is black?
@Ocasio2018 Agree 100%
@WhipHoyer @realDonaldTrump I bet you have been asleep for hours and some assistant posted this.
@clairecmc Oh boy...the one that wouldnt go away.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump House passed it! If republicans control the senate and all republicans vote for the bill how come it wouldn't pass?
@SebGorka Now we know who the "unnnamed source" "a source on the hill" "a source close to the Whitehouse" "source familiar with the situation" really is!
Happy #TrumpShutdown! Proud to support the man who supports us!
@MrStNick @DCJeniffer @VanJones68 @cut_50 Van is only one Man. You sound passionate about this issue so go get it like he did.
@FDRLST @KatrinaPierson Is that a madcow martini?
@CNNTonight @VanJones68 Please guys followup on this...no need to chase the drama...this is real.
@VanJones68 Sometime things have a way of working out.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight You are my fav fox news anchor!
@MrStNick @DCJeniffer @VanJones68 @cut_50 Nick I think you should tackle the Foster Care system like Van did with prison reform.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @KFILE That was back when he was hanging on every word you say...
@jasonelevation @KatrinaPierson So in the US abortion should be legal at any term but someone illegally crossing the border 2 days pregnant is considered to be carrying an unborn baby worthy of life???
@DCJeniffer @VanJones68 @cut_50 I see it! I see passion in someone else that I wont mention (maga) but I am inspired by Van...and to ignore it and disregard that chase and drive he has about this subject just because we may not agree on other things, would be real unfortunate. #govango
@DanRather Then people will ask why u or any one is surprised considering he said he was gonna do this almost a year ago...you got sucked into chasing a collusion story while the goods were out there for anyone with half a brain.
@kylegriffin1 So that also means most are his top arrivals? Did I just collapse ur real message?
@ShannonBream @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight @FoxNews Love you Shannon....just you...I mad at Lindz
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What did Nancy say again?
@RepAdamSchiff The Not President of the United States Adam Shiff (we kno his real last name) shouldn't be pumping "multiple unnamed sources....or did he not read the article that are a couple clicks to get to.
@VanJones68 @cut_50 Van, I'm in MA. What can I do to help?
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @TheJusticeDept After a couple clicks u get to the article he is talking about...written by 2 CNN individuals who are citing the famous "multiple sources familiar with the matter", which could be anyone reading this &amp; we get a politician from CA who hangs his hat on it. Is this real life?
@TomFitton Anyone referencing the wall, a shutdown or border security should begin their tweet with "Dear Jim &amp; Liz Steinle"...and if you cant you have no purpose commenting. I think its a good fit here!

@BarakRavid @jaketapper So foreign sources? Ok I see how this works,
@LauraAJarrett @jaketapper I replace "source(s)" with Russians. Wow that was easy...no wonder why you guys push that shit so much.
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Former Defense secretaries arent a one man show either...but u make him out to be one. Bold claim either way....did you press him on why he feels this way or was it easier to just leave it out there.
@canadian_cousin @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ok this is the second stupid comment on what I was getting at. Ted has accomplished what he set out to do by feeding on the uneducated.

Would love to see u follow-up with stories of the great things that come out of this bill. We disagree on alot but its the passion u have for this that got me!

@joshrogin @BrianKarem @AP I think we should all start assuming "un-named sources" are those pesky Russians. If these "sources" were so concerned and confident in their assessment you would think they would want to be named.
@MICK1219 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I dont think anyone should touch their money based on a politicians view especially when they probably aren't impacted by volatility because they pay handsomely for someone to manage their money.
@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump Why don't you begin tweets like this with "Jim &amp; Liz Steinle" Read it back and see if you still wanna post it.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump This is the second stock market reference I have seen you tie to Trump. I have a financial background and it is terrible to see you guys use this topic to "get him". Think of the one person you reach that might redeem their investments out of fear and lock in any losses.
@CNNPolitics @AprilDRyan And that's why he is gone...
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump And how do you feel about it. You are a big advocate for stuff like this usually.
@jaketapper Yes lets hold a private citizen accountable, who at the time had no intel aside from what was reported. Also we don't what the strategy is because it would be foolish to say. You are a pawn in this and you probably dont even know it.
@SenateGOP @SenFeinstein The pocket she resides in at the moment.
@CLewandowski_ @KatrinaPierson Already compromised! Their turn.
@Lawrence Fraud. In once sense he is leaving because he can't find a place in today's politics. Credit tho for recognizing it. He will try to weasle back in with some " no starving babies" speech in 2024 but he will be irrelevant.
@seanhannity Trump was McCain'd on Obamacare. Sand thrown in his face by Dr. Fords beach friends. Mitch owes trump a nuclear option IF he can't get 60 votes.
@kevincorke @BretBaier Luckily I don't need congress to lock my door at night.
@tedlieu Good tweet Ted. I may not agree with other things u stand for but we should all agree on this.
@marcorubio How the hell was this not fixed before trump.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We own it!
@Acosta 10 days ago Pelosi said he didn't have the votes in the house.
@realDonaldTrump He is one of those old office workers who say "we have never done it this way before". "I hit buttons every day because that's what I'm used to, don't know what the buttons do"
@joncoopertweets They are paying for it now and prob want the wall more than us.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I knew we had troops there but learning how they got there was interesting...get them outta there.
@SteveDaines Why wouldn't u guys do this? Shit is complicated enough. Get it done!
@realDonaldTrump @SteveDaines I'm a newbie to politics. What the he'll are we waiting for. This existed already.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump I have not seen any change in day to day life here in Boston. Just reporting facts on the ground. No sources either. No spin. Desperate adding that little girl into ur tweet.
@dutchiegirlie @TTaffey @BrianKarem And what would represent the best of Americans right now?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump If this president can do it with the military then the next president could have them tear it down...which I think you dems would love because its something to run on because you have no real ideas. Maybe focus on the people who were just killed in ur state and stop showboating.
@clairecmc Said this outgoing Senator.
@NancyPelosi Which people tho?
@marklevinshow He McCain'd him on Obamacare too. Its too bad because this is exactly why we need term limits. These guys are all about the legacy and name after years and years and YEARS and forget this is just a job. No one is looking up to any of these clowns.
@JeffFortenberry @SpeakerRyan Yes imagine how much he would have gotten done if Marco won. Sarcastic. C'mon man. Lets get real.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo How can you be fair and balanced when your Dad is running in 2020.
@MicahadairMicah @SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Mic someone told me I wasnt real because I hid behind a name and the next second I put my real pic and name up...your turn...
@SenatorCantwell Bla bla bla..."make no mistake"....What year is this?
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @KennedyNation @FoxBusiness @FoxBizAlert Trump just got everyone to jump to their talking points, none of which included anything positive about the troops coming home, and we all saw it...SHAME
@VanJones68 Van, would you ever tweet Trump directly in front of us all and give him a nod. I just went all over twitter promoting the consequences of an election and that the republicans lost the house. We can all meet half way.
@Jim_Jordan I have to be honest the @freedomcaucus sounds very establishmenty
@seanspicer @dbongino @seanhannity @FoxNews Can I call in?
@CraigCaplan @BretBaier One year from tomorrow hemp will be a Agricultural Commodity.
@trish_regan @gen_jackkeane Trish, I feel like Trump just showed everyone elections have consequences. The divide just shifted. We all, including myself at times, followed the "headline" over there while this happened over here. When 80s gave us too many hair bands we gave them Nirvana.
@LindseyGrahamSC If you have to tell us we dont care Lindz I think your getting to close to the drain. I dont want to see you go but the Kavanaugh hearing is old news. C'mon Karate Kid. Show us a new move.
@KatrinaPierson @TeamTrump @POTUS Finally! This is the first thank you I have seen. Watch the swamp drain...this is gonna be fun. Stay strong T.
@clairecmc I believe we are witnessing a draining of the swamp right here. #MAGA2020
@IngrahamAngle Elections have consequences. Republicans lost the house. Trump said all along he gives credit to the democrats for sticking together. We are gonna see the swamp drain when he's getting things done with the real majority...the people. The wall will come naturally like morning dew.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Kudos to trump for listening to the people. The republicans lost the house and now everyone is confused about whats going on. That is real leadership. He will work with anyone for the benefit of the people.

@JudicialWatch Look at that presidential pose....good enough for some....Crazy
@abgutman @VanJones68 @cut_50 HAHA. Its funny because you have a quarter divide now between dems and repubs. Fools....They hang their hats on bringing down Trump with some gotcha immoral, talking point no baby will starve...because they have no real ideas.
@LindseyGrahamSC What about a win for the families of the troops?
@BretBaier @RyanZinke I continue to say have me on the show but you never respond.
@VanJones68 @CNNTonight @cut_50 So it took a Whitelash to get this passed.
@jaketapper @SchneiderCNN @TheLeadCNN Who signed it on the Russia side?
@jaketapper @amandacarpenter @JenniceFuentes @KSoltisAnderson @PaulBegala @TheLeadCNN I agree.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Its time for a vacation....What did we gain? Is that a real question? How's about the US troops...I have to question your mental state.
@jaketapper And you didnt ask any followup questions. Talk about letting the news come to you.
@jimsciutto Wow you are in a bubble. Do you have a son or daughter there? Probably not because you would already know the answer to the stupidest question I have ever seen.
@jaketapper Don't apologize. Its a sign of weakness. Remember the (probably) one person who called you out is the same kind of person who made saying "Merry Christmas" an issue. Delete and re-post but finish with "if you dont like it pound sand and fry ice"

@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Mo, Larry and Curly asked for a bill.....
@JacksonDiehl @jaketapper If I were a smart guy....and I am. Why would you announce ur move months in advance? If you not busy this weekend we can play chess for $
@barstoolsports @LightsCameraPod Looking good McC
@nikkihaley That was me last week. Enjoy the deserved break. Wish more would follow ur lead to step aside, regroup and come back when you are ready....we will be waiting! Merry Christmas!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Meanwhile Mexico is paying for it without the wall. i.e. Tijuana
@JeffreyToobin @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump In other words the foundation crap ur pushing is just that.
@CoryBooker @IvankaTrump Good thing this one wasn't McCain'd
@marklevinshow Paul Ryan was useless.
@BrianKarem Sounds like u guys need the wall
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVosED @arneduncan U forgot to call him racist
@gatewaypundit @AnnCoulter @RealJamesWoods How crazy would it be if they built the wall with it because the way I see it they are paying for it by not having a wall...Tijuana
@CNNSitRoom @Acosta My 5yo just asked if u are Santa. I said yes Santa is taking to the grinch.
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Less or more legal than DACA?
@princeeditor @AprilDRyan Is she still there?
@RealCandaceO #getemO
@BrianKarem U love it!
@BrianKarem I bet if u guys looked hard enough, or not hard at all u can find others guilty of the same.
@MarshallCohen @jaketapper Wouldn't u guys do the same?
@BrianKarem Potus caller him a rat tho. If he didn't call Flynn a rat then u have ur answer.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Maybe that's what Flynn wanted.
@Acosta @PressSec Yes but maybe she is talking about funds already appropriated. I kno they like to spend.
@evanperez @Acosta Yes now update the reporting.
@jaketapper That was a very interesting development. Realistically he assumed Flynn was doing this WHILE in the WH. How they hell do you mess that up. Although I was ready to join him....glad it wasn't true. Now this is a real shit show.
@jaketapper Maybe she will get the message after the second loss.
@GovMikeHuckabee Like a millennial through a cross-walk....these are the days of our lives.
@TheLeadCNN @dansimoncnn Back story? So much detail left out. Was she here? Did she leave? Why? No details. Its a terrible story and I hope the waiver is given...but something tells me you wont report it if it is because that would collapse the real story you want to push.
@KimKardashian I think you guys may have switched dresses accidentally.
@ChrisCuomo @TuckerCarlson @andersoncooper @ShannonBream @seanhannity @donlemon @BrookeBCNN @HARRISFAULKNER @IngrahamAngle @foxandfriends @CNN News anchor challenge. Between now and Christmas you need to call the other station and wish your competitor a Happy Holiday LIVE on TV.
@jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Not once I have I heard u warn people to be careful of what they see on social media sites. Why is that?
@AndrewCMcCarthy Thanks for the tip real life Butt-head all grown up.
RT @JaniceDean: This sweet baby is hearing mama for the first time with a new hearing aid. ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/FqC5OzJFm4
@AprilDRyan Good
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Chuckles u dems are like a group of people writing a curriculum for a computer science class which is obsolete before the bell rings.
@RealCandaceO @jaketapper I could'nt believe it when I heard this nonsense earlier. Keep callin em out Candace.
@brianstelter Do u just assume she is interested?
@Alyssa_Milano There is no need for a thank u.
@amber_athey @jaketapper doesnt care about this girl or issue. It's a headline to use against the admin.
@Fahrenthold @jaketapper @NickMiroff @BobMooreNews Yet no resolution offered
@AprilDRyan Don't mess with my girls
@SenSchumer Can u go into more detail for us #regularfolk and not just be a #republicrat about it.
@RepRoybalAllard @NancyPelosi She is part of the #republicrats because we should listen to her because she is prim and proper and has an American flag behind her and that's what we all want in our leaders.
@SenSchumer Typical response from the #republicrats
@SenWarren This happened without a wall Liz. End the party of #republicrats
@SenWarren Liz, we can't have a health care system in place that can be canceled and reinstated with every administration. U guys need to stop being #republicrats and stop using us and get this shit figured out. Do u think people with pre-existing conditions give a shit about a win or losz.
@dbongino Tell me something I don't kno...like what color underwear u have on.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats I would have sent a meeting request to both sides to start the process of getting this resolved instead of this tweet. #redublicrats
@SenSchumer Maybe the #redublicrats can fix it. A big maybe.
What are #redublicrats ? Politicians who use misinformation tactics to take advantage of the #regularfolk who have about 5 minutes a day to see what these guys are doing with our tax dollars.
@NancyPelosi @SecretaryZinke I wish there was more information on this tweet. Its a big accusation that alot of u Redublicrats use as a headliner. Who are you talking to? Colleges? Media? Definitely not me.
@clairecmc @HawleyMO Too bad 2 groups of people can't fix it
@kanyewest @ArianaGrande Wosrt part is she prob doesn't mean it. Just sounds good
@kanyewest Stay strong buddy. We love u
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Or come up with a new one
@SenSchumer Can't u guys just repeal/replace?
@CNN @jaketapper She could have been used to get as far as they did and left her.
@seanmdav @SebGorka Prob only had to do with #dildosnshit
@AshaRangappa_ @dbongino Daniel I believe u just got #fdintheA
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Brian I have to give u all the love on the planet but imagine the #regularfolk who catch about five minutes of what's going on with our #Guvmnt
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP So it's 60 for the hard stuff but majority for the look good/feel good stuff.
@greggutfeld U still use a little photo shopping in and around the face/neck area. Embrace it like I have. Personality is what we have...not a perfect jaw line.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @carolelee @kwelkernbc @NicolleDWallace We love those multiple sources
@mkraju @Acosta Hopefully he just goes away after
@dbongino Just a waste of time this guy turned out to be.
@BrianKarem All it takes is one
@GovMikeHuckabee His tongue is all over that mic.
@SenWarren @RepRichmond @RepGwenMoore @RepBarbaraLee @RepCummings Let's not pretend anyone is getting in that high-rise for free.
@AprilDRyan @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I thought u gave this public rsvp that no one cares about already???
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I thought the jobs report said otherwise?
@ShimonPro @Acosta Whoa! Is right. Who cares
@BretBaier Bret I have a question. Jeff Sessions recused himself partly or wholly based on the ethics committee suggestion but what did the same committee say about appointing Mueller?
@RealJamesWoods Maybe she needs to watch #BorderLive
@DrDebraSoh @greggutfeld @FoxNews @foxnation Greg needs a new pic or undo the photo shopping.
@BrianKarem @ChrisCuomo @jeffmason1 @steveholland1 I was surprised they didnt want it public, yelled STOP at reporters at one point and only took questions related to the subject at hand. MORE SURPRISED not one reporter challenged them.
@SenSchumer It looks more like they are already paying because there isnt a wall.
@jaketapper @thelauracoates @ScottJenningsKY @niaCNN @SymoneDSanders @TheLeadCNN A take out menu from Uhvat could be "Russia Related" Info. Fake news in the making.
@jaketapper @thelauracoates @ScottJenningsKY @niaCNN @SymoneDSanders @TheLeadCNN What is a GOP Operative?
@elizabethforma Whats going on in MA?
@NancyPelosi Glad this went through...
@SenSchumer This one was a good one!
@marklevinshow Term Limits are needed.
@SenSchumer Did they have a choice?
@BuckSexton @AnnCoulter I hope her beach friends at least made the inside cover.
@bluladyredstate @Jim_Jordan If the laws were solid there wouldn't room to make up crap. Get rid of white nationalist for sure and I don't lie.
@samstein @jaketapper Or couldn't
@Toadsanime @Acosta I agree but u can't just go looking in everyone's trunk. The point is if Trump didn't win in 2016 would he be guilty of the stuff unrelated to trump?
@GovMikeHuckabee No one will remember this tool come Jan 1.
@Acosta I agree he is guilty and the sentence is appropriate. What I don't like is if u pop open enough trunks u are bound to find a dead body.
@Jim_Jordan As someone who never followed politics until 2016 I am just beside myself the immigration system is what it is. I assumed everyone was screened and legit. How stupid.
@EamonJavers @BrianKarem A	Amazing reporting sir but we all have TVs
@marklevinshow My grandma would disagree with u. (I agree)
@SenWarren Go get that free Healthcare I'm paying for!
@EverlyJoseph @cmferraro @jejordan67 @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump Every race.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer So they should do it behind closed doors and come out with different outcomes the press can spin?
@SenSchumer What are they? #regularfolk would like to know.
@BrianKarem Lets see what the outcome is
@AprilDRyan @NancyPelosi How many lives being saved from a wall would it take for it to be worth it? I say one.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump If it saves even one life...totally worth it.
@realDonaldTrump He turned out to be an ok guy
@marcorubio Can you explain in more detail?
@Jim_Jordan They had the perfect opportunity to sell their 2 options they talked about to the regular people paying their salary....something about 6 bills which makes no sense to #regularfolk
@EverlyJoseph @cmferraro @jejordan67 @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump Never liked any options.
@EverlyJoseph @cmferraro @jejordan67 @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump Last time I checked he said Midwest would be a GOOD START. Should we end there or have a little variety?
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @washingtonpost @NancyPelosi You are becoming irrelevant. We all saw it. Maybe you could find a job in typing court transcripts.
@cmferraro @jejordan67 @BretBaier He literally has not listened. Mmmmm Maybe we need to start our own panel. #regularfolk
@HearClearUS @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi  You guys should have picked one of these up a long time ago.
@JPaulKirby @jaketapper @David_Bossie I'm real!
@ChrisCuomo @BrianKarem If these 44 former senators did more and listened to the people we would'nt have Trump...Why would we listen now?
@OutnumberedFNC @jasoninthehouse @HARRISFAULKNER can I please come on the show and be #OLG. I think it would be good to have a regular dude for a change instead of the same ole people saying the same stuff from show to show.
@cmferraro @jejordan67 @BretBaier I will do it. I am 42 in Mass. Never voted before 2016. Didnt know what a democrat was, although I still dont know what they are. I voted, and continue to support, @realDonaldTrump based on his own words.
@KatiePavlich @BretBaier And why does the press listen when they say STOP and only answer certain questions.
@marklevinshow How come they get to only answer the questions they want??
@mkraju @BrianKarem Proud of TRUMP! Good Meeting
@SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris She couldn't have won anyway
@AprilDRyan I agree but "race" should mean all people of all colors. These "sound good, feel good" one liners don't work anymore.
@MarshallCohen @jaketapper One thing is correct...Cohen is a liar...Marshal that is.
@ReagorKristi @realDonaldTrump We can leave her on the other side of the wall...even better
@jaketapper @David_Bossie If I'm close to the Whitehouse (distance wise) and I tell u something (anything) I could technically be a "source close to the Whitehouse. Fake News!
@BretBaier Enough with big names. Regular real people
@jaketapper At least he isn't calling on government agencies to do it from the inside this time.
@jwgop False
@SenWarren @DHSgov Meanwhile back in mass...
@AprilDRyan Thank u for the public rsvp
@NancyPelosi The wall protects them too???
@SenWarren @WellsFargo I love u when u go after the banks! Work with Trump. Make great things happen for MA. No caravans!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino His full name is Eric Swallowell
@dbongino Eric Swallowell is a better one
@Bencjacobs @gtconway3d Geo ur wife is hot! I love her! Stop making things complicated
@DonaldJTrumpJr Eric Farewell is more fitting
@maddow Madcow gets old cuz damn
@ananavarro @AprilDRyan Are u speaking on behalf of CNN
@dbongino He is a tool
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Can u tell us what the options are chuckles?
@dave_lapointe @FelgerAndMazz Dave u will be married in less than 24 hours. It's time to focus! Unless ur sending last minute invitations get off facebook
@BrianKarem Are u speaking on behalf of CNN or is this ur own personal feelings
@politico Another tool, like @Comey , that feels like he has to save us and he alone knows the way.
@marklevinshow It took me a while to get over the fact that he looks like a giant DOUCHEBAG.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump One more month and the baby will be gone. BYE BYE SEE YA NEXT TIME
@GeoffEarle @Acosta Source close to the WH?
@BrianKarem What are the business ties?
@jaketapper @CNN Is it uninsured American Children or Uninsured Children in America?
@dbongino He should just flip to be a Dem
@marklevinshow This guy just needs to go away. 1 more month.
@AnnCoulter A “wrong way” sign would be progress at this point. Lock it up @realDonaldTrump
@19fredlynn @RedSox I have his card
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump How come I never see women and children and if they are there how do they have the energy after living in poverty for so long to get to the boarder and then throw rocks?
@PreetBharara Legal tho right?
@neiltyson Legally?
@AnnCoulter @AnnCoulter would u like to go out for dinner sometime? I literally would leave my family for u.
@realDonaldTrump This is why I voted for u
@DrShaena @SymoneDSanders Yes now if she only had the balls to stand up for Bernie when Clinton took his win away.
@SymoneDSanders @AprilDRyan Well it’s about time
@RealJamesWoods Who does care...I don’t go around asking people to guess what gender I am because I’m a gross hairy guy. There are 2 genders. End of discussion.
@dbongino It’s so funny to hear about this every other week or so after the constant press (hoping for the big leak) of collusion. I feel bad for people hanging on this one and feel even worse for the desperation of the media when they still think it’s a real story.
@RealJamesWoods I think it’s been a learning experience that’s good for us all. We want Roseanne Connor even if @therealroseanne is in the dog house. I don’t believe her tweet was hate related even if it was hurtful.
@kimguilfoyle @DailyCaller Thank u @realDonaldTrump
@AprilDRyan And it’s just as stupid as her set last time
@BarackObama The world as it “should be” according to who?
@jaketapper I’ll sign it. Maybe a person with common sense should be appointed.
@TheStevenWeber Best piece u did all year
@RandPaul Maybe we should help these guys instead of the asylum wannabes
@marklevinshow He kinda needs to go away but stay at the same time
@VinceMcMahon Nancy is killing it! Thank her for me!
@KatrinaPierson Close it anyway. Let’s take care of the people here first.
@RepTedDeutch @Acosta @CNN @CNNSitRoom Stop traffic! We cant wait! Remember this is the moment u peaked in life.
@maryannemarsh @DanaPerino Should have left them alone. Turtles can freeze and live.
@dave_lapointe @JoeyMurr I’m agreeing with everything u say between now and next Sunday
@dbongino I assumed he would love to be front and center again
@AprilDRyan He deserves way for credit. He is beating himself up.
@Michael_Nutter @realDonaldTrump Keep asking the same old tired questions and then claim we are all racists...
@WrestleCast985 @tdgarden @OldWrestlingPic @90sWWE I was there @dave_lapointe
@LindseyGrahamSC When are we gonna vote on term limits. Solve so many problems.
@RealJamesWoods They come in and order a beer with a jack F'ing back! (Watching Straw Dogs)
@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump I promised I wouldn’t “say” trumps name today. https://t.co/C3Cslevmd9
@SenWarren Well finally I like u
@EricTrump Agree! Never https://t.co/KhX1RcwOFW
@SarahPalinUSA And she should be. Now I hear it’s because of her race, gender and age. I think it’s because she’s stupid, stupid and stupid.
@marcorubio Marco. I liked that u genuinely had feelings about the FL election. Everything before and after that is crap. Get on our side would ya.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Since u are the front runner of the dem party for potus 2020 I will believe everything u have to say until otherwise
@K_JeanPierre @Acosta We won’t kno because all he is doing is copying and pasting.
@DanRather At least he gave it a shot. U just coast by reporting the when and where but u never talk about the how...fake news
@GenMhayden @jaketapper I think that’s the actual spelling of his name. If not that’s what he is called
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Hahhaahahahha lil A Schitt!
@CNN @AprilDRyan @jaketapper @staceyabrams I love how she ran for office in the same state she is suing for not winning.
@Acosta Glad u got ur pass back otherwise we might not get to hear this breaking news
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Maybe the real reporters should go out and figure it out rather than sharing ur thoughts about the potus. Prove him wrong!?
@AprilDRyan I thought reporting meant u investigate it and report back to us. Either u can vote or u can’t. I don’t get it.
@BrianKarem Free speech is one thing. Forcing people to listen to ur free speech is another.
@mkraju Maybe u should “report” on the caravan then? Isn’t that ur job?
@Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mooch, it’s was warranted.
@jaketapper Actually we the people were hellbent on troops going. We just nominated Trump to make it happen. Get it Jake?
@AprilDRyan Now let’s see if u guys can control urselves.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump The Whitehouse isn’t trying to “get” you tho. That’s the difference.
@BrianKarem @Acosta Yes reporters be wary that u can’t yell out and interrupt others while trying to do a side show of ur own.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump It’s almost like u want to be bullied?!? If u are then u make it in to “Fake Headline News” #FHN
@marthamaccallum Love u Martha but it’s time for a Botox touchup above the right eye.
@jaketapper This is news?
@JeffFlake Time to fade away
@ForlornCorn @JohnCornyn So the guy in the white hair is JC?
@henryrodgersdc @AnnCoulter @kyrstensinema @DailyCaller Now only if @SenWarren would knock on the front door of the WH and talk Mass.
@JoeConchaTV @BretBaier Never forget! He was the front runner for 2020 from the dem party for like 48 full hours.
@kanyewest So easy to get lost in that song.
@SenatorTester I called you out for what happened with the doctor. I respect the voters of MT and wanted to say congrats. They know you better than what we hear on TV, true or not.
@JohnCornyn I think I actually like you but not for this. Apologies dont get the coverage anymore its why I didnt demand one thats taking storm. Ya didnt need to pick this fight,
@jaketapper @RepTomMacArthur @AndyKimNJ Great News! Republicans obvi cant get it together without some dems. Glad we overshot on everything so negotiations should get us right about where we wanted them anyway.
@ByronTau @Acosta Jim needs a couple weeks off. Obviously very passionate about his job. Not what he did "this" time that got him in trouble its what was possibly gonna happen "next" time if unchecked. Life went on before and life will go on after @Acosta
@halltoons @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @co_rapunzel4 @reddroostermann @MaggieJordanACN @laloalcaraz Its so-so. The artistic skills can be found in any grade school in America. The "use" (i call being used) of these women is what really got the "share" lovey.
@ChrisCuomo I dont get either side on this issue. Seems like you guys stick together, which is honorable, so why dont you tell "US" why he "NEEDS" to be reinstated vs why he "should be" reinstated?
@SenWarren Liz can someone tell @JeffBezos we arent gonna cry like babies if they come to Boston???
@Peter_Wehner @davidaxelrod It worked well for beto
@SenSchumer Or maybe we just count legal votes
@RebeccaAguilar @ReliableSources @CNN Acosta isn’t reporting he is showboating. F him
@rebeccaballhaus @jaketapper Or just a fine...real news
@mkraju @jaketapper Yes take a bow by using that woman to win seats
@thehill @AprilDRyan How about u stop dickin us around and get it done
@jaketapper @CNN Tell it to the judge and how do u kno? Did u interrupt the recount to get this buzz
@PeterAlexander So is what he said correct just because u don’t like trump?
@nickgillespie @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @reason Like the gotcha comment. How is that reporting
@marklutchman @SebGorka I’m with him!
@DavidNakamura Why don’t we just do what ur job entails?
@BrianKarem Well now he said it. So let’s move on like the rest of us.
@DiamondandSilk Are one or both of u guys single cuz damn😍😍
@RealJamesWoods Thank u for using ur voice to help people. Too bad the retweets and comments aren’t in the 100s like usual because it has nothing to do with trump. People don’t really care
@AnnCoulter will u be my date to @dave_lapointe wedding next month?
@AnnCoulter Marry me!
@JeffFlake 12/31...
@CNNTonight @AprilDRyan Seriously? U belt out questions like u are entitled or something. I don’t see race or gender in this observation just ignorance on ur part.
@RealSaavedra Why is she still employed
@brianstelter @Acosta I think he should move on. He is a good reporter but he went too far. He forgot what his job was. Let him take Don Lemons job.
@ananavarro @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @abbydphillip They all work for CNN?
@yashar @AprilDRyan @abbydphillip It was a fabulous question the first time it was asked like ages ago. Raise the bar would ya
@CNN @BrianKarem Looks like a joint. Calling it a cigar is fake news
@mattyhoyeCNN @Acosta @realDonaldTrump Solid reporting...A “source” “familiar” with trumps discussions....DESPERATE!
@AprilDRyan @HuffPost What does it make me if I supported black female reporters before trump supposedly did this?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I think you guys are gonna fall in love and do amazing things for us!
@AprilDRyan @HuffPost Lead by example @AprilDRyan! Black, White or Brown people are all the same to me. You and @Acosta could do great things and tackle some real issues with the all this fierce energy and motivation you guys have instead of spinning these safe bets of racism, sexism, etc-ism.
@trish_regan @POTUS Its because you said "white men" and those 2 words together are racist and today's main stream reporters need to crowbar in race, sex, religion....Real issues come last Trish!
@SarahPalinUSA I think they should all run. They have no clue what they are doing but they sound presidential and that's enough for some people.
@keithboykin @AprilDRyan Seriously??? Attacked? C'mon guy.
@AprilDRyan Not the word I would use to describe you but you gotta chill guuuurl. Ur job isnt to come up with the news its to report it.
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Do all the damage u can before 12/31. Remember this as the time u peaked in ur life.
@SethMacFarlane U worry about running family guy. Trump will worry about running the country
@RealJamesWoods His actions cost-a-guy his job
@melissakchan @Acosta You talk more about urself in this tweet.
@johnrobertsFox @WhiteHouse John, you are very respectable and handle urself very professionally. Need more like u
@BrianKarem @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @BrianKarem this was his Spartacosta moment
@EWErickson Lets recount so she can lose twice
@PhilipRucker @Acosta @PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan How can you guys be good reporters and loathe trump at the same time? Answer is you cant and it was evident today. It really does come across as desperate when you report news and then talk about how much you disagree with everything said.
@FoxNews Three losers (for potus) what else ya got.
@NancyPelosi Congrats @NancyPelosi and to all the new house members. I am a giant @realDonaldTrump fan but the people have spoken and the outcome should be respected so take a bow!
@AprilDRyan Yawn. @AprilDRyan you can't act the way you did and then play the victim.
@LindseyGrahamSC Agree! No one ever asks about the endless possibilities we could have with a good mix of government like we have now. Its all about gotcha and controversially worded questions.
@JeffFlake Is it 12/31 yet?
@dave_lapointe Amen to that!
@RealSaavedra The art of fake news
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight Shannon I love all the other guys in the lineup but I look forward to 11 to watch u!
