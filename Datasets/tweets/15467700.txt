@mkink @JimmyVielkind @Uber I'm asking because I worry when there's kind of a "congestion pricing first, worry about corporate power later" mentality. the later can be a killer.
@mkink @JimmyVielkind @Uber I mean my inclination is to think real congestion pricing puts a stronger limit on ALL for hail cars, and require licensing, and ensure competition-- a version of the medallion model. The technology can work within the yellows and greens.

3) Excessive competition because of the number of taxicabs... results in peril and injury to the  public and higher insurance rates; periodic flooding of the streets with unnecessary taxicabs and needless replacements of adequate equipment...
2) To permit this industry to exist without regulation and limitation of the number of taxicabs would be to continue certain present evils and public hazards, among which are: undue and needless traffic congestion; long hours and inadequate income for taxicab drivers.

A good congestion pricing model serves several aims: reducing traffic, funding the MTA, ensuring safe, regulated rides, ensuring fair compensation, protecting against corruption. Remember that Uber hasn't been on the right side of any of these.
We have to look hard under the hood of the current congestion pricing models--especially when they are backed by Uber--and make sure they aren't ways to push out regulated, affordable, safe cabs entirely and give the game to Uber's gigopoly.
Uber clearly does not want to address congestion. Maybe we should increase the cap on ride-hails.  The original Haas Act of 1937, capping cab #s, was designed to (1) stop congestion and (2) make sure drivers were fairly compensated. Not what Uber wants.

Amazon treats its workers like WalMart treats its workers, and sellers like Monsanto treats farmers. It goes for federal government contracts like Halliburton. And, as @AOC points out, it treats politicians like FoxConn. https://t.co/F6cWCah8OA

Also, that's not an acceptable answer. The Governor has to be clear about his posture towards the PACB, and there is no excuse for the NYS economic development director for not having a public, clear position on something so basic.

I don't think leadership is in bad faith here at all. I just believe that when grassroots talk about closing LLC loophole, it has been about the whole thing, and I believe the votes are there to close it, and its better to close now. Half measures can make full measures harder.
Some people are saying "all reforms great," "moving right direction," but I am worried that they will announce success! and not deal with this real issue and ban all corp. donations. WIll be thrilled to be proven wrong, but we need to keep up heat!
@nwmalinowski C'mon Nick, I think we need UNIVERSAL VOTING like they have in Maine and VT and several countries. Why ask for less! :)
My understanding of NY bill purporting to "close the LLC loophole" is: it reclassifies LLCS as corporations, subjecting them to 5K limit. Good. 		But corp. subsidiaries still treated separately: so if someone controls many LLCs, they can contribute 5K times all subsidiaries. Bad.
My understanding of the NY voting rights bill today is that it is awesome. Thank you #LetNYVote coalition--the long term impact will be felt for decades.

@LizKrueger Why not ban corp. contributions altogether now? Who opposes that?
@LEPCreature @kaiowut99 Yes that seems right and good. It *looks* like it stops the multiplication problem but I'd like a deep dive. Still begs the question: why not a total ban?
@KlasfeldReports @harrysiegel @kaiowut99 i also see no good reason (and lots of bad reasons) not to just do what the federal campaign system does on this: no LLC contributions. zero. $5000 from real estate LLC is $5000 more than you're allowed to give to any congressional candidate.
@KlasfeldReports @harrysiegel @kaiowut99 i wish i could go deeper but have to focus on book--that sounds right to me, which is a good reform, just not closing the loophole. i trust reporters will figure it out before it passes.
@JimmyVielkind update us all if this changes!
Okay, so before I go back to my book, here is what I got:		- Leadership in Albany plans to pass a bill next week that does not close the LLC loophole, despite press releases. 		- State Senator @JenMetzgerNY has a bill that actually closes the LLC loophole https://t.co/ftXQKMQcOJ
@SchwaJohn @JenMetzgerNY Thanks! This is VERY helpful.
@SchwaJohn Thanks John! What is the status of this bill? This is great. Is this the bill that leadership says will pass?
I have yet to see any legislation that closes the LLC loophole. If anyone sees it, let us all know!
New Yorkers: we can and must close the LLC loophole in New York. If lawmakers say they are closing the loophole, but limited liability companies (think: real estate) can still make contributions, they are not telling the truth. They are adjusting the loophole. That's not closing.
@kaiowut99 @BrianKavanaghNY can you clear this up?
@kaiowut99 So on quick glance  it is not an LLC ban. There is a $5000 cap. A real estate co. could still create 100 LLCs to give $5000 apiece to a candidate, so the unlimited option is still there. Am I misreading?
Question as I've not been following closely, on book leave: Has anyone seen the LLC loophole bill that is supposed to pass in NY Monday? Want to make sure its a real LLC total ban, for next year, not a cap, not delayed.

I've never understood what #TuesdayThoughts were for. But that's my stab at the fortune cookie statements that come out on Tuesday.
The hint of applause that attaches itself to 'pragmatism' is, unfortunately, and wrongly, more likely to follow old school 90s machine politicians. Pragmatism does not mean conventional, either.
Pragmatism is a word with meaning. It does not mean centrism or cynicism, though I've heard it used as a synonym for both recently. One can be pragmatic and radical. Dewey, for instance, one of the founders of American pragmatism, sought to upend education.  #TuesdayThoughts

@blakeleymusic @Recode Yes! The deal is not done. The Senate and Assembly (now Democratic) hold substantial power. Leadership (Heastie, Cousins) each essentially have a veto, through representation on a board called PACB that HAS to approve the state grants. So don't accept the inevitability story!

All of this is also relevant to the Amazon fight--Amazon's power extends to the Senate, to Congress, to publishers, etc. Amazon, Google, and Facebook are each different, but each have outsized political power, and have shown no hesitation to use it.
For the story on the New America experience, read here: https://t.co/sTG6JebDA8		The fact that tech giants are willing to use their political power to quiet critics should worry us all. It is an essential part of the monopoly threat.

My concerns about Amazon are not just about economics, but about power and politics, and the democratic dangers that accompany dependency on a company with so many tentacles. Cf Brandeis, @superwuster's new book on concentrated power &amp; democracy.
Upstate New Yorkers should also hate this deal btw--hundreds of millions in economic development $$$ going nowhere near upstate. PACB, here we come!	https://t.co/7xSAawzZ9p
Among other things, it makes it mandatory that New York pass public financing. If New York is BEHIND the national dems, who have to wrangle from every corner of the country, that's embarrassing. And yes, corrupting to stick with big money funded campaigns.
In 2012 i testified in front of Pelosi, arguing against this old transparency-only model (the testimony also burned in my memory because I learned afterwards I had pen ink all over my cheek!). Dems being willing to change their own fundraising model is a huge deal.
This week, the Congressional Dems did something big--they announced that the first bill passed, a democracy package led by @RepSarbanes will include publicly financed elections. 		This is a major shift--6 years ago leadership was pushing transparency, not real financing change.

Maybe Joe Percoco or Alan Kalyeros can help explain how Amazon got $1.5 billion in promises from @GovAndrewCuomo. I am not saying that laws were broken, but that the history of econ development cash in New York is so bad that the highest levels of scrutiny are required.
The history of New York State spending $$$ for job promises is a history of political corruption and failure. Eg: $15 million in subsidies for two jobs in Utica. With this track record, $1.5 billion for Amazon is outrageous.  	https://t.co/XxW5zc7JUV

$1.5 Billion is totally unacceptable. What about zero. Zero works for New York. $1.5 Billion works for education. The subway. Green energy. Not for Alexander the Great 2.0. https://t.co/zaLsTeYK0u
So, starting today, take that energy you brought to electing Dems and start calling your State Assemblymembers and Senators to find out where they are on the hard issues, not the easy ones: on public financing, LLC loophole, CFE, climate, subway funding, millionaires tax, rent.
I heard a credible rumor that Cuomo is working w Senate/Assembly leadership in NY to get to a "unified" agenda for the upcoming session. With rock solid Democratic majority, "unity" may be shorthand for "lowest common denominator that doesn't upset real estate." Why risk that?

You will hear false choices--"we cant do campaign finance reform AND the LLC loophole." Why not? The iron is hot. WE can and must strike now, before April 1 2019.
@Bobby4Brooklyn Yes! tx for your leadership
The pressure on Dems from some bosses and real estate will be substantial and subtle. "Dont rush!" "Unity is more important!""Dont embarrass others.." but New York must lead and become the first big state to wholly reject private/corp financed campaigns &amp; embrace matching funds.
This morning someone pointed out, correctly, that the NY Senate wins are not just for this year--we're never going back to Republican control. The implications are enormous. Dems alone can pass or block campaign finance reform. Every Dem needs to speak out in favor. No excuses.

Four weeks three days! 		Elect a Dem State Senate NY so we can be the living counterexample to Trump &amp; Kavanaugh's America! In my area that means Karen Smythe, Jen Metzger, James Skoufis for Senate...  along w Delgado &amp; Brindisi for Congress. Yep, these swings are clustered!
The pursuit of justice got a whole lot harder this hour. We will have to work harder and with new strategies. States will matter more. Remember this moment when Kavanaugh upholds extreme partisan gerrymandering. 		That was a horrible speech to watch. Thank you to all who fought.

@reddit4bernie I strongly support both.
He has a tendency to lie to himself and others, about things large and small, and the law that springs from falsehoods and avoidance of the truth will impact the lives of millions for decades if he is confirmed.
Calling it a job interview, while helpfully clarifying that this is not a trial, understates the seriousness of the choice. A job assumes an ongoing boss to https://t.co/hgVZ4KKiRF is accountable. Instead, Kavanaugh seeks to govern, without democratic constraint, for decades.

Let's talk about that green economy. About fully funded schools, with art and science and music for all kids. Let's explain that our imaginations are too cramped and scared when it comes to work, to dental care, to mental health care.
When I was a kid I used to ski jump. You go down the ramp crouched and tight, but in the last minute, you have to leap forward, whole body sprung open, to fly.
What if, in these last 5 weeks before the elections, Democratic leadership in the Senate and House went big and bold and beautiful, taking righteous anger and soldering it to hope, to Medicare for All, to ending mass incarceration, to union power, to gloriously revived antitrust.

Of course, if there were any closeness with Molinaro, that would have a major impact. But at this point there is not.
In the next few weeks I hope he reopens the Moreland Commission, commits to sexual harassment hearings, takes responsibility for the false Nixon fliers. These are concrete actions he can take to show leadership and respond to concerns.
As you know, I unequivocally support Tish James for AG. Governor is harder. Obviously not Molinaro. 4 years ago I cast my first and only protest vote, writing in Hugh Carey. I haven't decided who I will vote for this year, but my concerns with Andrew Cuomo go beyond policy.

Then imagine him making decisions based on his understanding of the truth about race. About power. About money in politics. Who, after watching him over the last few months, thinks he is capable of facing truths about race, gender, power or privilege, when he can't face himself?
Take even the most uncontroversially obvious of his lies: If you will lie about drinking habits in high school to preserve yourself, you have already shown a dangerous weakness, a willingness to sacrifice truth easily.
A man who avoids uncomfortable truths is a dangerous Justice.		Kavanaugh's tendency to dishonesty, to self-preserving lies, has huge implications for the Supreme Court. Justices uphold or strike down world-changing laws based on beliefs about reality, the way the world works.

Emoluments Lawsuit Moves A Step Closer To Trump https://t.co/Vmrm2vMftq
The right response to Percoco's verdict would be for Cuomo to re-open the Moreland Commission. 		The abject corruption, legal and illegal, of New York government is an embarrassment, a disease, a force of inequality, especially unacceptable w/ our entire democracy under threat.
RT @KlasfeldReports: BREAKING: Six years for Percoco, with 3 years supervised release.
Investigate = Ford allegations. Lying allegations. Documents that haven't been reviewed. Unexplained debt payoff. Full investigation.
Also, the stories of sexual assault, misconduct, coverup &amp; retaliation in NY government are ongoing, disturbing &amp; deeply concerning. Your failure to call sexual harassment hearings as demanded by victims &amp; whistleblowers is disrespectful &amp; harmful. #sexualharassmentworkinggroup https://t.co/2P5kQB9P5Y
Kavanaugh if confirmed would likely remain in power for at least 9855 days, exercising control over hundreds of millions of people, deciding our voting rights, our civil rights, our speech rights, who can be treated how. Failure to investigate = 10,000 illegitimate days of power.
And universal voting. Everyone invluding incarcerated people should have the right to vote, as they do in two states--don't take away the franchise with a conviction. The vote/felony connection comes from the black codes.
End cash bail. 		Break up corporate monopolies.		Stop taking corporate money.		Investigate Trump's businesses.		Stop luxury developers from abusing power.		Sue big pharma.		Investigate Albany corruption. 		Our goals don't change with election results. Just the way we get there.

The Attorney General of New York 	may be the most important office in the country for resisting Trump, investigating his businesses, regulating Wall Street &amp; the environment when lobbyists own the EPA and CFPB &amp; keeping the flame of law alive. 		I'm ready. Vote September 13th.

As AG, I will investigate any violations of use of taxpayer money for campaign purposes. I have been outspoken about the need to follow up on the Percoco trial revelations that he made hundreds of calls to the campaign from a government phone. My opponents' silence is deafening.
We need to get to the bottom of  the timing of the Bridge opening and whether engineers were shut out of discussions for political reasons. Andrew Cuomo has to take responsibility, and I hope my opponents join me in calling for an investigation.
Andrew Cuomo has to stop passing the buck and take full responsibility for the gross and false mailer about Cynthia Nixon. And all my opponents must join me in condemning him for failing to take responsibility.

Imagine a New York State Attorney General who isn't part of the party machine, and isn't dependent on the same big corporate donors.		97% of my donors give less than $200. As Attorney General, I will serve only the people, my conscience, and the law. Not party bosses or donors.
This morning I'm going to be in Albany. 		We need a truly independent Attorney General who will investigate corruption in New York government and break up the destructive, cynical back-room politics that has dominated New York for too long. No more.
The cost of the back room old boys club in Albany is women who are assaulted and harassed and then treated with dismissiveness and retaliated against for coming forward. That's totally unacceptable.
We desperately need change and openness in Albany. That means holding sexual harassment hearings and truly hearing the stories of victims. That means holding institutional enablers of sexual misconduct accountable. 	https://t.co/NjowS2kOrO

My opponent Maloney voted with Republicans to repeal Section 716. It was one of those moments that didn't make huge headlines, but has huge impacts. 716 was "if not Dodd-Frank’s heart and soul, than at least one of its vital organs."		https://t.co/L7Ft09uw1F
Wall Street regulation is an area of real difference between myself and my opponents. 		I worked extensively on Section 716 of Dodd-Frank, the swaps push out rule designed to ensure taxpayers would not have to bail out risky bank behaviour. It was a huge and hard fought victory.
10 years ago this month, financial markets crashed. People lost homes, savings, security, good paying jobs. I co-founded a national group organizing for antitrust and putting more financial criminals in jail.		I know Wall Street. I am ready to be the next Sheriff. Vote Sept 13th.

New York must resist in two ways: total rejection of Kavanaugh and electing an Attorney General who is ready to use new tools, state laws and courts, innovative legal strategies, to protect and expand our rights. We need to push the boundaries. This is wartime for our democracy.
The Supreme Court governs us when it decides what laws can and cannot be passed. 		When we chose a Supreme Court Justice to replace Kennedy, we choose someone with the power to define all our rights.		The future of our country is at stake with Kavanaugh's nomination.
So excited to have the support of the @NYStateBATs, especially with school starting soon. Teachers tell teachers tell teachers and .... victory! https://t.co/MY38pYBXF5
To me, that means going beyond resistance to taking on mass incarceration, cash bail, etc (tools of arbitrary power), taking on corporate malfeasance (where big corporations have gotten too big to prosecute). We have to go deep and hack at root inequality under the law.
The Attorney General of New York plays a critical role in resisting Trump but also resisting Trump-ism, and keeping the flame of law alive, protecting the promise of neutral rules, and working hard to ensure that we reject arbitrary power here in NY.
I am less interested in his psychology and more interested in how critical it is that we resist this fundamental assault. This isn't just about the particulars, it is about the promise of neutral rules that apply to all equally vs. total arbitrary power.
As I said on Chris Hayes' podcast the other week, Donald Trump does not understand the idea of law. His attack is not that of someone who comprehends and wants to dismantle, but of someone for whom the promise of law is incoherent--a more insidious attack. https://t.co/R0Kxc7CX5A

Among other things, I'd like to see more Democrats more vocally supporting teacher's unions, recognizing the value they bring, and calling out the anti-union rhetoric in privatization of schools.
We can't kid ourselves about how difficult and frankly terrifying this moment is for workers and unions. So today we celebrate the extraordinary things that unions have brought us, and also recommit to speaking more loudly, using law, organizing, electing, to fight back.
I joined a union when I was 17, and have been standing with labor and for labor rights ever since. The use of the First Amendment to gut labor rights turned logic and history on their heads, and the all-out assault on labor by Republicans in State Houses and DC must be stopped.

100,000 missing pages on Kavanaugh will define him for decades if he assumes power--and being a Supreme Court Justice is a governing role in a country with judicial supremacy. 100,000 question marks and the stain of being nominated by a President under investigation. #BlockBrett

Clock stopping. Cohen admits in court that he broke key anticorruption laws at the direction of the President. 		Lot's of responses, but one should be obvious: Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination must be immediately halted. The President can't be picking who might be his judge.
New York's double jeopardy law should be amended to make sure that ANY crime pardoned in a self-serving pardon can be prosecuted at the state level. But even without that amendment, prosecution of crimes that are not based on the same acts covered by a pardon are not barred.
If Donald Trump pardons Manafort, the federal pardon would not cover state crimes. As AG of New York, I will investigate and pursue any state law violations to be ready for Trump trying to protect himself with a pardon. We have to be totally clear that no one is above the law.

Predatory landlords go to extreme lengths to push out tenants and increase rent prices. People's homes, health, and lives are at risk. The practices disproportionately affect low income communities, communities of color, the elderly, and the disabled.
Pres. Trump tried to rush through a repeal of a rule that protects our rivers and streams. The New York Attorney General led 11 states in suing to stop it, and today, a federal court found against the Trump administration. This is a huge victory for water and for the rule of law.

I’m the only candidate who’s ready to be the Sheriff of Wall Street because I’ve actually fought for consumers, and I’m not accepting money from corporate PACs or using the LLC loophole to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars from rich real estate developers.
You can't be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you just helped Donald Trump deregulate the financial services industry by voting with the administration 34% of the time. It’s fundamentally disqualifying.
You can’t be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you just handed big banks a massive, early Christmas bonus. And you can’t protect New Yorkers from consumer fraud, predatory lenders, or housing discrimination or if you’re awash in corporate cash.
He was one of only two New York Democrats to do so. Maloney is also raising vast sums of money from real estate and Wall Street interests. The Durst Organization contributed $150,000 to Maloney, or more than a fifth of his entire filing, through a series of eight different LLCs.
He has even been running digital ads, but his record says otherwise. Donald Trump made deregulating Wall Street a priority and in Congress, Maloney voted 34% of the time with Trump, including to rollback consumer financial protections of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Ever since Tish James declared in a New York Times interview that “It’s really critically important that I not be known as the ‘Sheriff on Wall Street,” Sean Patrick Maloney has been touting himself as the next Sheriff of Wall Street.

For me, you know the industries that concern me: pharma, health insurance, fossil fuel, real estate, wall street, big tech. They all put big money into politics. Its a central reason I don't take corporate money, unlike my opponents.
When you are used to comparing candidates for Congress, it takes a big shift to think about an AG race. For AG, you want to know about law, strategy, untapped litigation possibilities, general industry concerns and underused powers. Independence and expertise are key.
The job of Attorney General is fundamentally different than legislative jobs. As I tell supporters all the time, I support Single Payer, eg, but legislation is different than litigation, what you want to know is how I'll sue big pharma. The job is legal strategy and leadership.

Trump is here in Utica today to fundraise for Claudia Tenney. I brought him a copy of my book on corruption, with an inscription. As the next Attorney General of NY, I will sue to stop his emoluments violations and force divestment as the Constitution requires. https://t.co/gmDkWQRWkD
Donald Trump is coming to Utica, not far from Rome, where ICE agents conducted a terrifying raid earlier this year. As AG, I will be a fierce advocate for New York immigrants and for a sanctuary state, and do everything to protect against ICE and the abuses of agents. #abolishice

Wrong Rochester venue in the earlier tweet--we are holding our town hall meeting at Abundance Co-op at 2!
The emoluments legal strategy that I've pushed for 20 months along with Norm Eisen, Larry Tribe and others had a recent huge victory in court. 		I bring deep expertise and experience in constitutional and anticorruption law to the job of AG, skills required in this Trump crisis.
The serious point is this: corruption is a disease that spreads, and we are in the middle of an epidemic right now. We need to use every tool available to combat the threat posed by corruption in Trump's administration and allies.

And how does anyone in NY government expect staffers to come forward when the process for reporting is broken and JCOPE fails accusers? We need hearings on sexual harassment in Albany starting now, before the end of August.
How does CBS expect employees to come forward if Moonves is still the boss, accused of retaliation? We need a real investigation, not #MeToo window dressing. And that requires suspension.		As Attorney General I’ll put victims before powerful companies; no one is above the law.
These powerful men were suspended pending investigation:	 	Leonard Lopate (WNYC) 	Jonathan Schwartz (WNYC) 	Tom Ashbrook (NPR) 	Charlie Rose (CBS News)	Jason Mojica (Vice) 	Charles Payne (Fox) 	Eric Bolling (Fox)		But CBS' Moonves is not suspended during HIS investigation.

There is no good reason not to hold #metoo hearings in Albany about sexual harassment in New York government. NOW. 		There are lots of bad reasons, including fear of what we might learn, and a desire to protect powerful men.
He is Cuomo's former lawyer and none of the other Attorney General candidates agree with me. Leecia and Tish have both been asked and will not call for his resignation. Maloney has been silent. We have a corruption crisis and an ethics body that is failing: Agata is accountable.
The Executive Director of JCOPE, an agency that is supposed to be NY's ethics and sexual misconduct watchdog is Seth Agata. In the last year, Agata has demeaned complainants, rationalized Lhota taking outside income and failed to act swiftly on serious complaints. He must resign.
Barbara Underwood is a powerhouse. As I've said before, she is not running for Attorney General in the fall, but I would absolutely ask her to stay: she's a brilliant force for good and the rule of law, protecting New Yorkers. https://t.co/lA3CtVcNfI

Ugh. Agreed. Not Agree. But I'd still rather mis-type than skip debates.
By the way, I remember four years ago when Cuomo refused to debate me and said debates might be a "disservice to democracy." That didn't work well for him or voters. I am very disappointed that he hasn't agree to multiple debates with @CynthiaNixon yet. Voters deserve it.
Climate... so many more. These are hard, critical legal strategic questions, and voters want to know HOW we think, not just what we think, how we approach being the regulator of last resort when we can't trust the federal government.
One debate can't cover:		--&gt; Different approaches to Trump	--&gt; Different approaches to Cuomo &amp; Albany corruption	--&gt; Different approaches to Real Estate	--&gt; Different approaches to sexual misconduct	--&gt; Different approaches to corp $$		Pharma, ed tech, antitrust, wall street....
With 6.5 weeks before the AG election, Tish James and Sean Patrick Maloney have only agreed to a single broadcast debate. 		Leecia Eve &amp; I disagree on many things, but agree that for a vital legal job in a moment of crisis, one debate is trivial.  Let's do six. What's the holdup?
Four years ago today I was in Poughkeepsie with a group of 25 activists, demanding that the Governor ban fracking. One of thousands such events by fracktivists around New York over 4 years. The ban was a total grassroots victory. A reminder that it all matters.

Can you guess what the limit is for individual donations to a statewide candidate, primary and general, in New York? At the federal level it is $5,400.

New York has a weak anti-SLAPP law, and should adopt legislation modeled on California’s anti-SLAPP statute, so that victims can’t be buried under litigation designed to exhaust and ultimately censor them. I called for this today at CBS.
To protect against this use of expensive litigation to quiet public accusation, several states have anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) legislation. SLAPP lawsuits are suits brought to retaliate against those who exercise their First Amendment rights.
These can be strategies to burden people who might speak out with expensive litigation and deter future accusations. According to the New Yorker article, Moonves may have used language that hinted at a similar strategy, warning accusers about his “reputation.”
Powerful men use threats and intimidation--including the threat of litigation--to ensure that accusations are never heard. For instance, Bruce Ratner brought a defamation lawsuit against Melanie Kohler immediately after she went public with her accusations.

By the way--welcome to our 100 new volunteers this week! We now have over 1,000 volunteers working around the state, amazing dedicated New Yorkers, and we THANK YOU for helping build a grassroots campaign to take on corporate money.
This the first federal case defining emoluments. It could define the future of Trump's Presidency, because it could force him to divest his business interests. https://t.co/TTJTHRagnw
What questions would you want answered at a New York State Attorney General broadcast candidate debate?
Some questions for my opponents in debates:		- Why haven't you joined victims and called for hearings on sexual harassment in Albany?	- Why haven't you asked the IDC to return illegal campaign funds?	- Why haven't you called on the head of JCOPE to resign?
With only seven weeks to go before the election, Tish James and Sean Patrick Maloney have not yet agreed to debates. We need multiple broadcast debates so voters can really learn our different legal approaches. Leecia Eve has agreed. In 2010, there were many substantive debates.
While local news declined by 10% in just three years, FB and Google made records profits off of digital advertising--FB makes 40% profit margin. Money is being made off of content, but not by the content producers, but by digital ad tech.
There are only 7 weeks to go before September 13th primary election for the New York Attorney General! When you can't trust the federal government, the NYSAG is the most important legal job in the country to protect our civil rights, air &amp; water, workers rights, the rule of law.

@jeffjarvis This is deadly serious--both the NYT and WSJ heads have said the same (see our recent OMI event on FB Google and the News).  This is not just me, and the ad-tech tax is common parlance. There are particular pathologies here, but also the larger picture is very real.
A week after Trump was elected, in November 2016, @NormEisen called me to talk about emoluments. Norm was the driving force behind pulling together the litigation in the SDNY &amp; all the emoluments litigation. With today's big victory, I am grateful for his powerful leadership.
@LandisWeaver Yes
I have been arguing for 9 years that there is an anti-corruption principle embedded in the Constitution. Today, Judge Peter J. Messitte adopted that principle writing "As Professor Teachout has noted, 'corruption, in the American tradition, does not just include blatant bribes.."
This opinion in the Emoluments Clause case is a watershed moment. From the moment Trump took office he was in violation of the Constitution, and while DC &amp; MD are leading the way, NY should be part of this fight. It's where most of his businesses are. When I am AG, we will be.

The costs of corruption include low wages, stagnant economic development, poverty, anger, difficulty paying medical bills.		I will use the Attorney General's office to investigate and prosecute high level corruption because it causes too much suffering and inequality. https://t.co/KIN2X2YkgW
As AG, my priority will be high level crimes and coverups. No covering up prosecutorial misconduct. No covering up sexual misconduct by polticians and staff. No covering up corruption. Investigate and prosecute abuse at the pinnacles of power.
When prosecutors protect their own instead of justice, it profoundly undermines trust in law. New York has one of the highest rates of exoneration due to prosecutorial misconduct. Every prosecutor should welcome oversight &amp; accountability as a way to strengthen the justice system
The Kings County DA's office should be held accountable for what happened to Gregory Ellis. As AG, I will be unafraid to call out and fight against prosecutorial misconduct. Law enforcement should never excuse high level lawlessness.  https://t.co/a6EzlKLchp

@ravngsofamadman I hear your argument: my own view is that law requires justice or it isn't law, but I understand the other view, that law is just force, however used. Regardless the current state of what we call law needs to be returned to the people, mass incarceration is out of control.
ICE uses people with badges to enforce it's opposite, bigotry &amp; arbitrary power. $$$ in politics creates law-like imposters that are all about special rules for the wealthy and well-connected. We've never achieved the radical ideal, but I'm never going to stop fighting for it.
Law is a radical ideal. The promise that every person is treated equally under neutral rules regardless of wealth or connection or race. The promise of process before guilt is determined. Trump doesn't understand law. Ny corruption makes a joke of it. Cash bail tears it apart.

We still don't know who killed Saheed Vassell. It took 4 years to begin a disciplinary process for Eric Garner. Democrats and Republicans alike have failed to deliver justice, instead choosing to pass the blame. We must demand transparency. We must demand accountability.
The fight to create a truly just system requires us to hold our law enforcement accountable, to end cash bail, to provide speedy trials, to create discovery reform, and to provide robust re-entry programs. We must lead that fight from New York. I will do that as AG.
(To be clear, I had been calling for the referral for two weeks, and Barbara Underwood's leadership in her brilliant lawsuit against the Foundation must be recognized--that lawsuit is what opened the door to the criminal options. Don't underestimate Underwood.)
Monday I called for a criminal investigation of Kushner Cos, and a few hours later Cuomo announced he would do it. 		Wednesday I called for a criminal referral of the Trump Foundation case, and a few hours later Cuomo announced he would do it. 		So on the Moreland Commission...

Donald Trump has been operating in New York finance and big real estate for over 20 years. The next AG of NY needs to come with no ties to either, taking no corporate or LLC money, ready to doggedly investigate wrong-doing not just by this Trump, but the next Trump. https://t.co/v44trJq2PC
With Trump, we have lies. The opposite of lying isn't not-lying, but truth-telling. Not-lying is much easier than truth-telling; the former can be lazy &amp; cynical, the latter takes courage. To combat lying, not-lying isn't enough. We need a radical commitment to truth-telling.
@CTLizB The cynicism around politics inside politics, where it assumed that the quotes aren't coming from the people but rather just given for sign-off, it may seem small but its part of a slow total disconnect from life, from truth not as the opposite of lies but as something more.

Now Trump CAN be criminally investigated n NY for Foundation-related crimes.  I noticed a number of you pushing for calls to the governor's office to ensure he gave the criminal referral. Yesterday's victory belongs to everyone in this grassroots effort!
@kthalps @RoKhanna Exactly!!!!
Thank you to @DavidCayJ!  Yesterday we stood in front of Trump Tower for the second time in this campaign, not calling on Trump but calling on Cuomo to act on this after repeated requests. This is a big victory for justice--no one can be above the law. https://t.co/viUx5omiJK

This doesn't require a referral from the governor, beefing up the criminal unit at the AGs office, taking on discovery reform, challenging drug prices, going deep in the weeds on fraud in condo conversions. It takes a total of less than 10 hours of candidates on camera, talking.

Two weeks ago, the Rhode Island Attorney General brought a groundbreaking lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, demanding they pay the state for the costs of climate change.		That's the kind of lawsuit I will bring as your AG, protecting NY air and water from dirty energy.
The heart of the assault of Trump's Presidency is arbitrary unconstrained power. The answer to arbitrary power is the rule of law. That means treating all, regardless of wealth or status, the same. That means prosecuting corruption and taking on corporate monopolies in NY.
NY can be the living counterexample to Trump"s America. We can protect people from ICE, reform our justice system, prosecute powerful insiders who break the law, protect women's rights, protect air &amp; water from fossil fuels, reject big real estate cash. We are not impotent.
There may be a reason, but I would be interested in hearing it articulated, because as it stands it is just baffling.
States must keep the flame of law alive when the federal government abuses it. And the NY AG has a central, unique, and vital role to play. Who do we imagine will pursue the criminal investigation over this foundation based in NY if not Underwood?
I simply cannot understand any hesitation on the part of Governor Cuomo to grant Barbara Underwood a referral to criminally investigate the Trump Foundation. I cannot understand why my opponents in the Attorney General's race are quiet. This is urgent. @DavidCayJ

You may not realize it, but the New York State Attorney General can sue under federal law to stop mergers like Sprint and T-Mobile.		We can enter a new era of trustbusting, led by New York! #MondayMotivation
The constitutional violation is blatant, ongoing, destabilizing. Trump's defenses are not persuasive. I'm confident these suits will lead to a court order requiring divestment of businesses. It's essential that NY be involved because of our unique relationship to his businesses.
I know this issue deeply, and was one of the lawyers on the Emoluments suit by competitors which we brought three days after he took office. I've stepped away from an appeal in that case while I am running for AG, but am confident our arguments will prevail in the 2nd Circuit.
The Attorneys General from MD and DC are pursuing their lawsuits, but NY should be leading: it is where the central tool of the Constitutional violation, the Trump Organization, is based.
There is a terrible conflict at the heart of Trump's presidency: he takes foreign government money while making trade and military decisions. This is a serious Constitutional violation. As NY Attorney General, I will sue to make him divest. #Emoluments

I did hear regularly about calls from Percoco "from the Second Floor" (where the Governor's office is) to people who had the temerity to support me. It now sounds like they campaign calls literally from the Second Floor, not from the campaign office. That's against the law.
(The him here being Cuomo, who I ran against in 2014. Presumably Percoco's calls related to that race.)
In this particular case I would have to recuse myself and create a wall, because the 2014 campaign calls were related to my primary challenge against him. But it certainly underlines the crying need for a totally independent AG.
This is a huge story. Allegations of corruption at the heart of the Cuomo admin in the middle of a tornado of corruption cases--Kaloyeros, Percoco, Silver, Pigeon, Crystal Run, the pinnacles of power, all implicated. 		We must face the facts and fix this. NY is better than this. https://t.co/sxMLfS8EMN
Agata and JCOPE have also betrayed victims of sexual misconduct by failing to speedily &amp; respectfully investigate and resolve serious claims. They have given Lhota permission to be MTA chair and make outside money. The watchdog looks totally compromised &amp; Agata, must resign.
Using State resources for a campaign is illegal, and exactly the kind of behavior that JCOPE, the ethics and sexual misconduct watchdog, is supposed to investigate. But Agata, current JCOPE head and Cuomo's lawyer while Percoco was breaking law, hasn't investigated.
The head of JCOPE, Seth Agata, who was present for this illegal behavior, must resign. JCOPE is supposed to be an ethics watchdog. I disagree with my opponents for AG who have not called for his resignation when asked. New Yorkers deserve independence in their watchdogs and AGs. https://t.co/sxMLfS8EMN

Failing to call out Agata is a strong signal of a lack of independence. His tenure has been a total embarrassment -- his recent decision covering Lhota just another example.
My opponents may agree with me that we should reform or end JCOPE. I have been outspoken about that. But too often, the call for "later reform" or "reform JCOPE" means that the people in charge NOW, responsible NOW, don't take responsibility, and the misconduct continues.
Sexual misconduct from harassment to rape to forced kissing have been rampant in Albany.  Not for a few minutes, but for decades. I can promise you that I'll be independent AG who will make sure that #MeToo becomes #TimesUp in Albany. No more impunity and sweeping under the rug.
The disaster of JCOPE is a walking wound for the women who have been harassed, lost jobs, whose complaints have been shut out by Albany insiders. None of my AG opponents in this race have joined me in calling for Agata to resign. He is too deeply politically connected.
Want to talk about Congressman Jim Jordan? In New York State, powerful insiders have been covering up sexual misconduct for years, enabled by an ethics agency (JCOPE) that protects instead of investigates power. Last month I called for the head of JCOPE, Seth Agata, to resign.

@joelmsiegel Great work.
While I do not expect Cuomo to agree with every word spoken by every campaign donor, Trump occupies a uniquely dangerous position right now, and the size of his campaign contribution to Cuomo is significant. So the money should be returned.
Andrew Cuomo should return the campaign contributions from Donald Trump. Trust in government is so fragile &amp; should not be taken for granted. Trump is openly bigoted, sexist, and dismissive of law and the press. His administration is corrupt &amp; his words are hateful &amp;dangerous.
Since so many of you have asked and may have missed my earlier answer: AG Barbara Underwood is a brilliant powerhouse, she is not running in the fall, and I would absolutely ask her if she would be the SG after the election. I'd be honored &amp; NY would benefit if she said yes.
Highly recommend the quesadillas and conversation at Blacc Vanilla in Newburgh! @Kevindaryan. https://t.co/a5rjjRwJoI
This, for example, is what the Attorney General of New York can do. 	https://t.co/cV7iYgsdhA
RT @ZephyrTeachout: Today in Newburgh @JumaaneWilliams, @Kevindaryan and I stood at the people's park, standing for environmental justice,…
Environmental justice requires starting with truth-telling: When big polluters are not held accountable, it is too often communities of color and low income communities that bear the brunt. We can't change that trend without getting off fossil fuel $$ and corporate cash.
Thank you to @JumaaneWilliams and @Kevindaryan for your outspoken leadership. Newburgh will get justice. New York will get justice. Polluters will pay, not half-way-pay, but fully pay, for the damage they cause. And we've got green, healthy energy in our future!
whether in Newburgh or Hoosick Falls or the Rockaways. 		I am proud to have stood with the protesters in Hoosick Falls and the fracktivists: we in NY CAN be the national leader in health and clean air and water, but it will take an AG who is not tied into corporate campaign cash.
I am not taking fossil fuel money. Pruitt may represent extreme corruption, but there is plenty of soft but very dangerous corruption, fossil fuel companies using campaign contributions as a way to get prosecutors to turn away. I am not turning away from public health disasters,
(5) Ask, as I did today, for the DEC to refer cases to the AG so we can investigate. In Newburgh, the big polluter is the DOD--the AG needs a referral from the DEC to take action (6) Investigate corruption in big power plant projects like CPV.
As AG I will: (1) Sue oil and gas companies for their role in climate change (2) Intervene when FERC rubber-stamps pipeline approvals without fair process (3) Continue the AG’s lawsuits against the EPA and ExxonMobil (4) Demand transparency in our PFOS crises...
So much injustice is perpetrated by large corporations who put profits over the health of people.  I do not accept -- not as a citizen, lawyer, expectant mother, or the next AG -- that we fear for kids to drink water, play in our streams, or sleep in a lead contaminated rooms.
The effects of natural disasters and the acts of major polluters are felt disproportionately by already disadvantaged communities. We see it in Newburgh, and in NYCHA housing, where water is contaminated and lead poisoning is unacceptably high. We see this after Sandy and Irene.
I view the AG’s role as a steward of the environment broadly: it involves community health, air and water pollution, climate change, the energy sector, our natural resources and parks, and waste disposal, to name several areas. Every single person deserves clean water and air.
When you can’t trust the Federal Government to protect our land, our water, our air, and our health, the role of the New York State Attorney General becomes crucial. No matter who runs the EPA, its current mission is not Environmental Protection.
1/ Scott Pruitt has resigned, but the basic facts remain: 		The EPA, that is supposed to protect our land, air, water, and health, the EPA, has been corrupted from within. It is run by dirty energy insiders and lobbyists.
Today in Newburgh @JumaaneWilliams, @Kevindaryan and I stood at the people's park, standing for environmental justice, and how each of us--as AG, as LG, and as a County Legislator--can fight for the people who can't write big checks, but are the most hurt by big polluters. https://t.co/brNabhZBh9

When you can’t trust the federal government to initiate a criminal investigation, it is important that NY, where crimes may have occurred, take the lead. Cuomo should act to make it possible. Trump is threatening the Rule of Law: we need to be clear no one is above the law in NY.
The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Underwood shows how Donald Trump has flagrantly abused his charity, using it as a piggy bank to make personal purchases and settle personal lawsuits.
The Attorney General does not have the freestanding authority to initiate criminal investigations in this case, but could easily gain that authority through a criminal referral issued by Governor Cuomo, the New York State Police, or the State Department of Taxation and Finance.
Today we asked Governor Cuomo to make a criminal referral that would allow Attorney General Barbara Underwood to pursue criminal investigations of the activities related to the Trump Foundation. AG Underwood recently filed a civil lawsuit against the Foundation.

Beautiful. Thank you. https://t.co/w6eHgDlgno
In our history as a country, we've had extraordinary times of bravery and democracy, and extraordinary times of cruelty and inhumanity. We must remember both, use the 4th as a time to draw on the strength that comes from both honest reckoning and honest celebration.
Take care of yourself on this hot holiday. Call your friends. Put an icecube on your neck. If you're in the country, watch the fireflies. In the city, watch the fireworks. And remember how hard it is to achieve real independence from tyranny, and that we must always work for it.
@philipmarsh Yes. Exactly.
We need to bring law back to the hands of the people, and out of the hands of tyrants and big corporations.

Police transparency and governmental transparency are deep in everything I have done, from being a death penalty lawyer to being the national director of the Sunlight Foundation. If I am honored to be your AG, I will be unabashed in demanding transparency.
One thing we all need to do: Demand that Gov. Cuomo come out in support of repealing 50-a and requiring a 48-hour rule. To learn more go here: https://t.co/Bkf7S4R65d
Four things you can do:		1. Demand De Blasio release the names and unedited footage	2. Support the repeal of 50-a	3. Support a 48-hour rule for all police shootings	4. Follow @Justice4Saheed
New York is one of only three states that gives specific protection to police officers’ records. NY's anti-transparency law, CRL 50-a, has been so abused that one committee concluded that police misconduct in New York is more secretive than in any other state in the nation.
Follow @Justice4Saheed De Blasio should #ReleaseTheNames, footage and the basic information on cops who killed Saheed. Cuomo and De Blasio should both publicly commit to a 48 hour rule so we do not have this same situation again. Unaccountable law enforcement is not acceptable.
A basic protection against tyranny is transparency. But in New York, the government uses the law to protect the government, instead of the people. In Las Vegas, officer names are released within 48 hours of a police shooting, and details within 72. Why are we so behind Las Vegas?
It has been three months since Saheed Vassell was killed in Brooklyn, and his family still does not know who shot him. This is totally unacceptable. The names of the officers involved should be released immediately along with any un-edited video.

Now history will be the judge of Justice Kennedy and his legacy, but today, it is the job of the Senate to make sure no appointee gets a vote until the investigation into Trump is complete.
Historically Supreme Court justices have had the good sense not to step down while there are questions about a president’s legitimacy. In fact, some justices have remained on the court despite health challenges, likely in order to avoid a crisis just like the one we face today.
In the past Supreme Court justices have had the good sense not to step down while there are questions about a president’s legitimacy. Justices have remained on the court despite significant health challenges, likely in order to avoid a crisis just like the one we face today.
The next justice will likely be asked to rule on questions related to Donald Trump’s businesses, his corruption, his pardons and perhaps the basic legitimacy of his administration. We do not know what Robert Mueller and his team have uncovered already or might uncover soon.
Any appointment before the investigation is concluded will call the legitimacy of the Supreme Court into question. We are already in the midst of a Constitutional crisis, and this would only worsen the situation.
It would be an unprecedented move to pick a deciding vote of our nation’s highest court during an investigation into the legitimacy of the presidency. It has never happened before — not with Bill Clinton, not with Richard Nixon, and not with Andrew Johnson.
When a president is under investigation, they should not be allowed to make an appointment to the Supreme Court. Period.

The same people who can't afford cash bail certainly can't afford to be heard by AG candidates, but Pfizer, and Goldman Sachs, and big real estate can: that leads to the upside down world we live in now.
I believe it is particularly important for an Attorney General to make that commitment: corporations face litigation and prosecution. Corporations are obviously giving money to influence law enforcement. And that's not okay, and hurts people.
Real estate interests in particular abuse the LLC loophole to give vast sums of money to New York politicians. It means that corporate interests get a loud voice, and people get their voices shut out.
I was the only Attorney General candidate to make that commitment. The LLC loophole not only allows for corporate donations, it also allows a single individual to set up multiple LLCs which have a higher contribution limit, circumventing the much lower limits 4individuals.
On Saturday at a forum hosted by Indivisible Brooklyn, all the candidates for Attorney General were present. We were asked, yes or no, if we would commit to rejecting LLC money; corporate money that a loophole in New York laws allow candidates to accept.

@JayDevvvv Both are important! As is NY corruption. As is mass incarceration and police accountability. I was talking about drug prices earlier, and Wall Street. All roles are key. I do take the Trump threat very seriously, however, and the importance of the role in this moment.
The current New York AG, the first woman, Barbara Underwood, is brilliant, and in her first months has shown extraordinary leadership. For those who aren't clear, she is not running in the fall. I would certainly ask her to stay as SG if she wanted to. I admire her profoundly.
When you can't trust the federal government, the NY Attorney General's office becomes the most essential enforcer of the rule of law. We have the resources to investigate, sue and prosecute. We have jurisdiction because Trump's businesses are here, so many violations happen here.

One of my top priorities as the next Attorney General is investigating out-of-control drug prices. Big pharma is ripping off poor and working class New Yorkers. The scam has to stop. https://t.co/kFqUP44yRD
It may seem like these are disconnected, but they are not: you can't protect people from getting ripped off by big drug companies if your big donors are drug companies, and you can't fully investigate corruption, including Trump's, if there are any doors you don't want to open.
I'm the only candidate to refuse corporate money. The only candidate to call for resignation of Cuomo's ally Seth Agata (running an ethics agency that protects power). The only candidate demanding the IDC return illegal money. I'm not scared of the truth. I am ready to fight.
We are in a humanitarian, constitutional, and democratic crisis of epic proportions. The AG must be totally independent of corporate money. She must be totally committed to protecting the people of this state, not the political or power establishment. And clear abt hard truths.
After Mueller, the New York State Attorney General's office is the most important law enforcement office in the country right now, with the power and independence to investigate Trump's businesses and prosecute associates, to defend against the flood of illegal federal actions.

The legal resistance against Trump  requires tenacious, path-breaking litigation against his administration's  illegal behavior and investigating/stopping the illegal use of his businesses. But it also requires cleaning house in Albany so we can fight back and protect w strength.
Some of that money was illegal, as a Court ruled: big donors and polticians schemed to use the Independence Party to avoid the law. This is the kind of kind of illegality an independent Attorney General can protect New Yorkers from. Public corruption hurts the most vulnerable.
NY corruption gets in the way of our ability to protect people. As the federal government goes after immigrants, NY should be the living counter-example, but we have no Dream Act even, because real estate and hedge fund donors gave $ to IDC which gave Rs power in a blue state.

I hope all candidates for Attorney General join me in calling for the return of illegal money. I have closely read the lawsuit finding that this money was illegal. It is not a close case: in effect, the IDC relied on a stretch First Amendment argument from Citizens United. https://t.co/1A3lNxPISE
IMHO the epic wins of @Ocasio2018 &amp; @dana_balter &amp; @liuba4congress are totally connected to other NY news this week: another sexual harassment scandal, whitewashing Lhota's conflicts. Why accept broken politics when amazing women are leading on Medicare for All, etc?
Three weeks ago a court ruled--unsurprisingly--that the IDC had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars of illegal money. They should pay it back now. 		NY's corruption problems go so deep that every elected official should be crystal clear on this: Return it. 		 #IDCDirtyMoney

This is the same ethics board that has not been able to do anything on the sexual misconduct allegations regarding Jeff Klein.

And ALL of us must demand a Justice who understands what our Constitution truly stands for--the people, not the powerful.
States, and State Attorneys General, must step up to protect the full scope of state and federal Constitutional rights. As your AG with a long career as a Constitutional lawyer, I will leave no argument unturned to protect our rights.
The Equal Protection Clause. Due process. The Establishment Clause. The right of women to choose an abortion. Justice Kennedy's retirement is devastating news, giving the power of these clauses to Trump and a Republican Congress.

It is not an accident that Trump can use ICE and CBP as tools of unconstitutional illegal behavior: it is part of the structural flaw of the agencies themselves.
In addition to the current atrocities, there is a documented history of illegal activity. According to documents from DHS’s OIG, which reviews complaints against ICE and Border Patrol, there were 1,124 allegations of sexual abuse and assault from 2010 to 2017.
Immigration policy should not be conducted by agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, where there is the least review, the least transparency, and the most executive power. ICE is a fairly recent government agency. It was formed post 9/11 by George W. Bush.
ICE and CBP are rife with substantiated abuse incidents. ICE is so politicized that it’s not credible as a law enforcement, and so deeply riddled with illegal behavior it is not credible as a self-governing agency. ICE is stunningly cruel and unaccountable &amp; must be abolished.

It may only be a coincidence, but it is demoralizing for competing companies, taxpayers and residents to learn that ... LP Ciminelli ... [was] awarded major developer status for two ‘Buffalo Billion’ projects following sizable contributions to Andrew Cuomo’s 2014 campaign.
Winners must include local companies and small businesses that truly need the assistance to grow – whether or not they are “politically connected.”
1/ I went to opening arguments in Buffalo Billion trial today. It is a scandal, and one that didn't need to happen. In September 2014, I wrote this in the Buffalo News: 		“The Buffalo Billion must be allocated without favoritism, and the selection process should be transparent.

@Nerdzilla76 Thank you for your work. But that's a disgrace.
@Nerdzilla76 Exactly--and when we spend millions but for donors, not economic development projects based on merit--the human cost is huge.
Congratulations Katelyn!!! I never broke 5:03, so I know how unbelievably fast this is. You are an inspiration!
All of this is enabled by a culture of silence in Albany. Anyone who says this is about bad apples is either wilfully or naively ignorant of the depth of the problem. Or part of the problem.
WOW! Katelyn Tuohy breaks girls U.S. high school record in mile. I remember that record because I was a miler in high school in the 80s--this is amazing!  https://t.co/BKo2Z9sczZ via @lohud
Voters are hurt, upstate New York communities in desperate need of economic support are hurt, taxpayers hurt, and the back room deals go on. As Attorney General, I'm ready to root out corruption in government and economic development, even when big donors are the malefactors.
We have an ongoing corruption emergency in New York: this trial is about public money for economic development going to campaign donors through bid rigging. It hurts our economy and our democracy, and the honest but not-well connected business owners suffer. https://t.co/TZSqHKfR3a

March, call, write letters, and flood his phone lines. Fear and money and racism will not succeed if we draw on all our resources.
They use money to elect people who will be silent in the face of immorality; we come together as a grassroots force.		My Congressman, John Faso, a Republican in the Hudson Valley, claims family values but is silent in the face of children being ripped away. @RepJohnFaso
They are using children as a gross tactic; we will draw on our love for ALL	children as our inspiration.		They use race to divide us; we will use truth, humanity, and	persistence to touch every uncertain heart.		They use scarcity to scare people; we bring a politics of abundance.
It is not the joyous fathers day that it should be, because in America,	in our name, children are being torn from their families and forced to	sit, without their parents, in a cage.		So every father and child who celebrates that extraordinary relationship also sees that horror.
The moral fury of our country, grounded in humanity, will not let these outrageous family separations continue. We will overcome their politics of fear and scarcity and calculation with a politics of love and righteous anger and justice.

True, in a few rare instances a Presidential pardon would also preclude state prosecutions: where all illegality is encompassed in a few crimes. So we need to both pass a narrow DJ exception to protect the rule of law AND be clear that justice does not depend on it.
No one is above the law. And Donald Trump must know that if he uses his pardon power to protect himself, New York will not hesitate to act where there is illegal behavior.
I want to reiterate a very important point: yes, New York leg. should pass legislation to exempt a narrow class of pardons from the state double jeopardy law, but existing state laws mean that in MOST cases of a self-serving Presidential pardon, New York can still prosecute.

I saw what Arpaio did. I read the grotesque stories of how he treated people. But I believed we were succeeding in pushing it back. Clearly it takes more. None of us can be silent when Arpaio's policies become national policies.
I walked side by side with men and women who made me weep with their bravery, Dreamers who dared show sit in McCain's office. I heard Arpaio spit bile. And yet I did not believe we would rip children from their parents and put them in cages.
After SB 1070 was passed in Arizona, I spent the summer of 2010 in Phoenix, living on a couch and working overtime to resist Arpaio &amp; the gross racism &amp; cruelty of growing anti-immigrant politics. We marched, filed lawsuits, got past security to protest Arpaio at his own rallies.
I think the biggest takeaway is that Underwood has brains and guts, and New York has a problem when it allowed Trump to blatantly abuse charities laws for decades until Underwood became AG. https://t.co/vBDTEriqUj

I want to take today to thank Underwood for stepping up. But as I've said before, the last AG did too little in addressing Trump's business interests--and that includes his Foundation. We need to fight corruption more aggressively at every level.
Let me be clear: the lawsuit Underwood filed today was critically important. But it is outrageous that the Trump Foundation was able operate as an openly illegal operation for 20 years. Real estate, money, and poltical power are way too cozy in New York.

@ToddAldinger @sarbetter @TishJames (106)
@ToddAldinger @sarbetter @TishJames The point, which is technical, is Executive Order 16--Cuomo thinks he controls it but the order creates a referral that hasn't been countermanded.
That's right. Cuomo referred corruption investigations to the AG's office in Executive Order 106, and the absence of a countermanding executive order leaves the original Executive Order legally alive. https://t.co/FWjD5rjDS9

I am so thrilled that Barbara Underwood--who has been in the office less than a month--brought this critical lawsuit against Trump Foundation's openly illegal behavior. THIS is what we need!  Aggressive, clear, unafraid litigation against illegal, self-serving, corrupt abuses.
The conduct alleged is blatantly illegal-- using a tax-sheltered charity as a personal piggy bank.

It's important to be clear about who and what is responsible. Because if we simply hope for a day where we change the structure, we are left with a current ethics problem of epic proportions.
It is totally clear that Agata must resign immediately. We have an ethics emergency in Albany and need a leadership change ASAP in this toothless watchdog. https://t.co/X788yVgN1j
Yes we need a Moreland Commission. Corruption in Albany is enfeebling all of New York State and hurting New Yorkers.
The Executive Order 106 creating the Moreland Commission was never formally rescinded. That means that the AG's power &amp; responsibility to investigate New York corruption persists. As I made clear earlier this week, I will use those powers to take on corruption in NYS government. https://t.co/Cjk08LqlwP

There is enormous hunger for independent enforcement agencies in Albany--just from the people in Albany, not those in power.
