@JessicaGottlieb lol I think you have a higher 'reach' than I do!
@JessicaGottlieb The other scores are also relative to everyone else in the system.  (+ or - the average, compared to others like you)
@JessicaGottlieb lol - #601 out of #19,977 in the system.  I could be more clear about that, couldn't I?
@JessicaGottlieb sure - any part in particular? You have high scores overall, and a healthy # of fairly high profile followers.

@EdwardMoore Thanks, Edward, you too!
@atlasdoc2 how often does twinfluence update? tricky question - but every other week for top 50s, on demand for others (it's not a spider)
@markhawker re: protection of twinfluence algorithm; Nope! I would rather be transparent and use academically recognized algorithms.

@dunstan I'm not sure how that can happen - the twitter API is set up to only tweet to the user who provided their own password and login!
@ZappoMan not necessarily.  You could have low-profile followers only, then centralization and social capital would both be low!
@MyPreciousKid is it a mystery? you have 2300 followers and have grown quickly! that's not insignificant!
@valdiskrebs LOL how many tweets does that convert to?
@valdiskrebs As I read that, it made me think it would be easy to apply group-to-group ratios (another sociomatrix!) - aggregation
I'm finding tweetlater's daily digest of @ replies very useful... i'm not always where I can monitor my tweetstream
@JayOatway Actually spidering 2nd order network not possible in "real time" (obama=656,000 API page calls!).  See twinfluence "about" page
@JayOatway I've spoken about this elsewhere - but twinfluence must estimate reach based on twitter API listing of follower's follower counts
@JayOatway Correct observation - it's a limitation of the estimation method twinfluence must use.  Why I started collecting sna data too!
@KariRippetoe the host server twinfluences uses is giving declining service.  I'm in the process of migrating!

@krmaxwell I want to respect the privacy of twinfluence users, and the twitter API - even though I suppose you could mine that info manually
@krmaxwell I will make the data available eventually for academic research, and maybe general research if I can anonomize it sufficiently!
As of right now, Twinfluence now stores twitterer&lt;-follower linkage data for future social network analysis.
@nocky100 I agree - @sigepjedi and I were just comparing to what is polite IRL versus in online social networks

Twitter *is* a part of "tellafriend" (http://tellafriend.socialtwist.com/ - thx @kazooed) and sharethis (thx @daNanner) - work well together
@daNanner Sharethis is new to me, it seems promising. It's been a while since I looked at social bookmarking - some great new options now!

@ScottAllen It would require exponentially more API calls - I don't think any ideas we've kicked around so far are terribly feasible
@ScottAllen sadly, neither "replies" nor "friends" of followers are easily available via the Twitter API.
@timoreilly From former secretary of labor Robert Reich's blog : http://is.gd/4wUz
@valdiskrebs nice example!  I keep thinking about how much more of this stuff I could do if I built an actual twitter spider.
LOL I was thinking about starting a friendfeed influence app, but I think I'll work on twinfluence social capital instead
@abnerg I used to have an "efficiency" metric built into twinfluence, but dropped it - no way to measure actual reading behavior!
@macartisan close to what I was thinking, but considering normalizing it to zero-to-100% score too.  Will see if logarithm is necessary.
or maybe the social capital index should be rethunk - to devalue followers who follow thousands as not real "capital".  Hmmmm!
@macartisan socap bottom limit - there are charts on the "about" page; maybe I could do a regression or other stats for a cutoff
@ScottAllen What does everyone think - should I put a higher bottom limit (follower size) for the social capital top fifty?
@ScottAllen You make a good point on social capital, it shows in the chart trends (see the "about" page).

@DougMeacham I have you at a reach of 1.2million - if you got lower, stay tuned for the fixes in version 2, by tomorrow
@DougMeacham that score is obviously wrong!  Perhaps there was an API lockout as I switched some code yesterday.  Your reach is much higher.

@barcamptampa Bernie Borges speaketh the truth about business adoption / understanding of web2.0 / marketing2.0 / social media
maybe collaborate with http://tweepletwak.com sigepjedi, we seem to have some overlapping ideas.

Got some good suggestions at the Tampa Barcamp today for twinfluence.com.  browse profiles, more analytics, more rankings

@donbart that's a great SM ROI haiku.  Yours?
@BradMays how did your twitter presentation go?  Am curious about it.
It just occurred to me how much the "What are you doing" Twitter prompt prob. shapes the content of most tweets- emphasizes personal minutia
@gilliatt buy a copy of their track Flowers Become Screens.  If you like that, you'll like much of the rest.
@gilliatt not bad, but now I have to listen to talking heads.  Have you listened to Delerium?
@gilliatt ah, another talking heads fan!  They're good for my writing productivity too.
@chrisbrogan experimenting with combining twitter with yahoo pipes - but I would have missed your tweet on AideRSS!
@chrisbrogan thanks for the AideRSS link, I wasn't aware of it but I'm big on trying to reduce the noise level I try to deal with

@jowyang which is better - become active on a hot social network site (twitter), or become a leader on a rising one (tumblr)?

@vdimauro what I fear about twitter is that it has no "noise to signal" controls.  I can filter and organize my emails, RSS feeds
