Final note to Carlson: free speech extends to sponsors and advertisers. And having your own tv show is not among the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. Thank you, @pacificlife, for starting the ball rolling on finally holding Carlson accountable.
And like with Dobbs, Carlson and his apologizers are screaming ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù. This is not about the 1st amendment. Dobbs/Carlson have every right to say all the hateful things they want. They do not, though, have the right to be free from criticism, challenge, or condemnation.
Same thing needs to happen with Carlson. What‚Äôs different from 2008 is that many more realize that his talk of immigration is just a dog whistle of racism and demagoguery. This is about stoking fear &amp; resentment, not honest reporting.
What is happening now mirrors what happened exactly 10 years ago with @LouDobbs on @CNN. We confronted him with the facts of his racism on his own show. And we and our partners ended Dobbs‚Äô platform of hate on CNN.
15 advertisers and counting have pulled ads from @TuckerCarlson‚Äôs show and deservedly so. His relentless immigrant bashing is steeped in ugly bigotry and lies, not to mention White nationalism. Yet, he has doubled down on his immigrants make America ‚Äúdirtier‚Äù rant.

Bottom line: @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs empty, political, and bigoted demagoguery is standing in the way of solving the immigration issue and harms our country.
A real solution means working with the nations of Central America to address complex root causes and recognizing that insults and threats do not constitute an effective foreign policy.
Trying to paint unarmed families including young children as an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù is needless hype and a craven and false scare tactic.¬†A POTUS should be focused on real solutions, this POTUS can only provide demagoguery. Sad!
The caravan of Honduran migrants is fleeing horrific violence. They are traveling together for safety and to seek refuge.¬†They are not guaranteed refuge in this country but they have every right to ask for it.
As usual, @realdonaldtrump is using a complicated situation to confuse, lie, and demonize. And as usual, he is making a tragic situation worse.

This is a scandal of historic proportions. Republicans, who control both the House and Senate, should be outraged by the admin‚Äôs dereliction of duty to millions of US citizens. Yet we have heard nothing from Repub leaders. 3,000 Americans DIED. What are you going to do? 6/7

This administration has not only failed our #DREAMers, but the 90% of Americans who stand with them. The Republican leadership's refusal to accept a bipartisan deal is reprehensible and their actions will not go unanswered. #DreamActNow https://t.co/rU5njtcF66
We get such rare chances to see R‚Äôs and D‚Äôs work together &amp; come to agreement. The bipartisan #DREAM amendments in the Senate reflect painful concessions but they move the process forward &amp; finally would give #DREAMers relief from fear of deportation. https://t.co/HyApyetgE1
The #Trumpbudget signals the priorities &amp; values of this administration. Not only does it take safety net programs away from families, it includes a harmful anti-immigrant agenda &amp; inadequate infrastructure plan. See the @WeareUnidosUS break-down here: https://t.co/qoPwIgtSWZ
Adelante! ‚úäüèº https://t.co/iEOfgGShI1
Extremely disappointing to see that Congress has chosen to keep millions of #DREAMers in limbo.  While access to healthcare is being addressed and #PuertoRico will receive much-needed funding, this outcome could and should have been a win for all.
Congress has the ability to address the communities hit by disasters, ensure children have the care they need AND heed the nearly 90% of Americans who want relief for #DREAMers now. It should not be an either-or situation. #ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow
While it is encouraging to see a bipartisan budget deal that would finally fund health care access and disaster relief, it still leaves our #DREAMers without protection and that is unacceptable.

Appalled but not surprised. Presented w/ a bipartisan proposal, @realdonaldtrump has angry, racist response. We have said from day one that Trump's immigration views are not about the rule of law or policy, they are pure, overt bigotry.
We ended 2017 without relief for our #DREAMers, meaning every day 122 people lose their chance to work, further their education, own a home, or simply provide for their family. We can't wait anymore. #DreamActNow https://t.co/JrHUtQX5sb

Este ataque innecesario al bienestar y el futuro de nuestros ni√±os no s√≥lo est√° mal, pero tambi√©n es de poca visi√≥n. Estos ni√±os ser√°n la espina dorsal de la fuerza laboral en la pr√≥xima d√©cada, as√≠ que algo que los perjudica a ellos va a perjudicar a todos los estadounidenses.
El liderazgo Republicano en el Congreso y la administraci√≥n est√°n deleitando a los ricos con un buffet de 'todo lo que puedan comer' y han dejado a nuestras familias y nuestros ni√±os con la cuenta a deber. #GOPTaxScam
y los recortes peque√±os y temporales para la gran mayor√≠a de las familias trabajadoras y de clase media estadounidenses, hacen de este proyecto de ley no solo uno desmesurado, sino tambi√©n obsceno. #GOPTaxScam

The Republican Congressional leadership and the Administration are treating the very rich to a high-end 'all you can eat' buffet and sticking our families and our kids with the check. #GOPTaxScam
Plain and simple, this is a historically bad piece of legislation. With its massive and permanent tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest of Americans and tiny and temporary cuts for the vast majority of American families, this bill is not only unconscionable, it is obscene.

Wow! Great day. Great decision. Time to get back to helping all Americans get the health care they need and deserve.
Just on #mitchellreports, voiced disappointment with remaining "papers please" provision of SB 1070 and with Romney response.
Our first line of self-defense against #SB1070 &amp; copycats is at the voting booth. Register to vote! http://t.co/GPx08CJg #Mobilize2Vote
Today, #SCOTUS failed to decisively remove the bull's eye from the back's of Arizona's Latinos, leaving it to future lawsuits to address.
We're glad that most of #SB1070 was struck down, but upholding "papers please" legitimizes racial profiling &amp; keeps AZ's Latinos in peril.
I applaud Mr. Obama's bold move to end the fear that dominates a DREAMers life--the threat of deportation through no fault of their own.
I'm so honored to be receiving the @civilrightsorg Hubert H. Humphrey Award tonight! #HHH2012

The goal of the Escalera Program is to design a replicable program model for serving Latino youth that others can implement. #summerjobs+
NCLR's Escalera Program has been highly successful in engaging low-income Latino youth in developmental employment experiences. #summerjobs+
NCLR's Affiliates are a home base for many youth in our communities & are essential parts of an effective summer jobs strategy. #summerjobs+
The U.S. pop. over age 65 will grow from 13% in 2010 to 20% in 2050. Latino youth will play an important role. #summerjobs+
500,000 youth will turn 18 every year, adding millions of new workers to the population and contributing to future economic growth.
Today‚Äôs Hispanic children are tomorrow‚Äôs American workers; it is estimated that by 2050, 30% of the workforce will be #Latino.

Also on the press call today, .@splcenter & .@hicatweets. Both groups are doing courageous work in #Alabama to fight #HB56. #immigration
I was proud today to have two powerful #education leaders, .@rweingarten & .@NEAPresident, on a press call denouncing the #HB56 decision.
#HB56 is brutal &unconstitutional. It negates so much of the hard work that #Alabama has done to overcome its dark history w/civil rights.
