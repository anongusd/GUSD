"You can't just be a climate denier." Thanks, @JohnKasich for setting up our week with this #ecoright battle call https://t.co/h3SanTik2H
@BenOquist Very glad for John‚Äôs leadership here.
I like this version of the future that our https://t.co/E3z00W1X85 spokesman, John Sweeney, lays out here: "America plays catch up to lead the world to take strong collective action to combat climate change." https://t.co/5QqHSF0K0Q
This piece reflects the agreement of scientists--Jennifer Francis, the witness called by the Ds and @JoeMajkut, the witness called by the Rs https://t.co/nzB8QF9JsG
And, yes, at https://t.co/E3z00W1X85 we'd join those who "point to recent House Science and Energy and Commerce committee hearings as a sign that Republicans are increasingly sincere about their concern over climate change."

RT @republicEn: Our latest #ecoright rockstar @RepRooney is new co-chair of #climate solutions caucus and we can't clap loud enough! https:‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre right, Jim. A carbon tax by itself is regressive (hurts poor people). But, if you pair a carbon tax with a cut in payroll taxes or dividend the carbon tax revenue back to citizens, then poor people actually come out better than they‚Äôre doing now.
@JimPressOffice ‚Äúsaid he opposes any form of carbon pricing because it would ‚Äòdisproportionately hurt poor people.‚Äô"
How‚Äôd we Republicans do in 2018 in districts most affected by climate change? If we want the majority back, we need those districts back. Are you thinking that a climate change disputer can win in, say, Miami or Charleston, SC?
And @JimPressOffice said ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt win the House back if the Republican position is Green Revolution-light.‚Äù
.@JimPressOffice said ‚ÄúI am interested in selling the American people that market-based solutions work rather than all kinds of bureaucratic taxes or regulations that haven't worked in Europe, wouldn't work here, and would be extremely unpopular with voters,‚Äù
What could be more free market, Jim, than internalizing negative externalities (attaching all costs) though a price on carbon dioxide? As Milton Friedman said in this 2-minute clip, it‚Äôs more effective to tax pollution than to regulate it: https://t.co/h9MxmtGL48
.@JimPressOffice ‚Äúsaid he wants to bring a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù perspective to the committee, emphasizing innovation and opposing government policies such as carbon pricing that climate experts favor to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.‚Äù
The consensus, Jim, is that climate change will significantly harm the people that we love and the places that we love. See the Trump Administration‚Äôs "Fourth National Climate Assessment." https://t.co/2h47AuMrXX
.@JimPressOffice said "People might call me a climate change denier ‚Äî my position on climate change is yes, I do believe there is human impact on climate change, but there is no consensus whatsoever on how much impact there is.'

". . . The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
Lincoln in his First Inaugural: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. . .
The people who were standing in line with me would enter the conversation if they weren't to be treated as the vanquished, if their values were to be affirmed, if their worth were to be affirmed. Please, Ds, reach out. Serve. Bring along. Leave triumphalism aside.
We in the climate effort need to live out Abraham Lincoln's words. Standing in line to vote yesterday in my very red precinct in South Carolina, I wish I could have set up a table with donuts and coffee and said, "Let's talk about what it would take to get you in on climate."
"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in. . . ." Abraham Lincoln. 2nd Inaugural Address.

@scottpalmer1776 @frequentbuyer1 @postandcourier @republicEn A $25 per ton carbon tax would make the price of gasoline go up by 21 cents/ gallon, and the average home would have an $11 per month increase in their electricity bill. Remember, too, all of the carbon tax revenue would be returned to taxpayers as a dividend or in other tax cuts
@scottpalmer1776 @frequentbuyer1 @postandcourier @republicEn You'd be right, Scott, if there were no border adjustment. But as Lisa knows, the idea is to collect the same tax on imports. China challenges and loses in the World Trade Organization. 24 hours later they'd have the same carbon tax, and industries don't move for energy reasons

Good words here from @RepCurbelo about his Market Choice Act. Then some words about turning on the lights so that we can see that there's no monster under the bed in the form of a scary carbon tax. Rather,  it's a powerful and useful tax swap. https://t.co/AVPHWNtWR5
@annajanejoyner @NPR @republicEn @RepCurbelo Yes, Anna Jane, times they are a changin'. Thanks for spreading the word!
@MogensenPeter Agreed. But there was a Great Recession that sapped out confidence. And there were some folks who exploited that vulnerability in those dark days. Now that we're stronger, let's prove that we can innovate--that we can fix climate change.
And the further good news for us at https://t.co/E3z00W1X85 and for our allies on the #ecoRight : "Political disagreement was substantially smaller when it came to Republican-backed policies [that address climate change]."

RT @republicEn: VIDEO: The #MarketChoiceAct by @RepCurbelo is the first GOP-led #climate legislation in nearly a decade. What's in the bill‚Ä¶
And reports: "A new independent study, led by Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, found that Curbelo‚Äôs legislation would cause little damage to the overall economy, while dramatically reducing planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions."
Includes key quote: ‚ÄúThe fervency of opponents‚Äô responses demonstrates that these ideas could have real traction and can happen more quickly than most people think," said Joseph Majkut, a climate scientist at Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank supporting a carbon tax."
Reports that, "Others say Curbelo's action shows Republicans representing states already feeling the impacts of climate change, such as Florida and its rising sea levels, are interested in finding solutions."
Very balanced coverage here by @SiegelScribe. Quotes proponents and opponents. Points out that "Many economists say a carbon emissions tax is the most cost-effective way to fight climate change, and thus could appeal to GOP skeptics." https://t.co/EgIkXkU7F1
This report by @SiegelScribe is worth reading. @RepCurbelo has come up with a creative answer that would provide for infrastructure, address tax equity and spark innovation that could solve climate change. https://t.co/EgIkXkU7F1

Right now, we're understandably focused on opposing. I want to win the majority & get to proposing. Some Rs will find it hard to transition
So if we take the majority, we'd better have some folks who have plans and who can warmly sell those plans by capturing hearts and minds.
While in the minority it's largely about opposing the D agenda. If we take  the majority, the job changes to proposing rather than opposing.

We've got to be bold! We've got to say "NO!" to $150 million recreational lakes. And we've got to be ready to explain entitlement reform.
Solutions or scapegoats? You get to choose today. We can STOP THE SPENDING with a bold plan like Paul Ryan's Roadmap for America's future.
Read all about pork, earmarks, the Union lake and fishing for votes:  http://wurl.ws/y6OQ
Little Pigs. Little pork. Little earmark for a recreational lake. No go with one lady: "When you get to your credit limit STOP THE SPENDING!
Just left Little Pigs' new location in Greer. Union Lake was main topic. Folks were fired up--ready to STOP THE SPENDING.
Also heard encouragement as to my voting record and discernment that we don't want to throw out those who have worked to balance the budget.
Great door-to-door in Augusta Circle area just now. Found enthusiastic response and got out lots of signs. "Stop the spending!" is the word!
Everyone: Stop the spending!
Really great door-to-door conversations in Greer just now. James: grow the jobs. Mark: find solutions. Bill: secure the border.
Very encouraging that people seem to be deciding to keep in office those who are prepared to stop the spending & a voting record to prove it
Just finishing door-to-door in Botany Woods in Greenville. Rain delayed the action for awhile, but then some very encouraging conversations
Originally from Ghana and living in NYC, he joined the Marines after 9/11. Became US citizen after second deployment. Wow, what an American!
As always happens at these events, I wish that he had spoken an I had listened. He was deployed 4 times to Iraq. Lost his right eye in 4th.
Spoke at two great Memorial Day events today. After the event at Greenville County Square a former Marine thanked me for speaking.
Mr. Joe Hudson died 3 years ago. "We were very close," Mrs. Hudson told me. "He went through a lot." On Memorial Day remember Joe Hudson.
Came home. No hospital beds. Had to wait. Recovered somewhat. Worked @ Steele Heddle for a time. Never quite well. Married 64 years.
Joe Hudson went in @ Normandy. Made it into countryside before being shot in chest and legs. Six ribs gone, medics covered heart with skin.
Just heard an inspiring account of love and devotion as I was going door-to-door off Parkins Mill Road in Greenville from Mrs. Joe Hudson.
Sadly, the other R and the D acknowledged that inaction takes us to Greece. We deserve better. We deserve a Congress ready to lead.
I asked if they (the other R and the D) were ready to cast votes and lead to solutions. "Heck no!" came the answer, "We'd lose our seats."
Amazed by what another R & a D told me in conversation on Floor. All agreed that people are mad. All agreed that big decisions must be made.
It's going to take more than 1200 to secure the border. We should get on with it. That's the first step in restoring the rule of law.
Glad that Pres. Obama will send 1200 troops to border. We can thank Arizona for re-starting a push that should never have stopped.
To see some beautiful girls (they got their Mom's looks and abilities) on a TV commercial, take a look at this: http://wurl.ws/tA0P
Health care reform should start with tort reform. If you're not clear about that, you shouldn't represent this district in Washington.
Meanwhile, I've voted for caps & support an even more sweeping proposal that I learned from SRHS on my 75-stop/9 month health care tour.
Ya think that lawyer cash might keep Gowdy from answering the Medical Society's question about tort reform? Got the garbled answer on tape!
Gowdy has raised $75,000 from lawyers (19% of his campaign cash). See  http://www.opensecrets.org/races/sectors.php?cycle=2010&id=SC04
Ironic that just next door is "The Lawyers Building" which houses some trial lawyers. Lo and behold there's a "Gowdy" sign out front!
Just met (in front of Greenville County Medical Society) with physicians who heard Trey Gowdy's non-answer on tort reform last Tuesday night
And the chances of me being for a $150 million earmark for a recreational lake? Zero.
Not my style to build false hope. Better to be straight up and tell folks the truth: Union lake can only be built with an earmark.
I admit to not fitting in w/ Washington-style politics: Build false hope in a "competitive grant" process for a "public private partnership"
No, I researched the proposed Lake w/ the Corps of Engineers and they told me bluntly: we will build the lake only if forced by an earmark
If it were simply a public/private partnership seeking a competitive grant for a 5,700 acre recreational lake, why would I have opposed it?
It's time to take a look at all that trial lawyer money Trey's gotten. It's time to ask why those trial lawyers are investing so heavily.
Gowdy didn't get away with the non-answer on tort reform tonight. The doctors were onto him. They heard a non-answer & talked to me about it
Amazing that Trey just had another chance to turn his tort reform lecture into a position, but he didn't.
Unlike Trey Gowdy (who gets substantial financial support from trial lawyers) I am free to aggressively support tort reform.
I favor caps on non-economic damages and medical panel determinations (negative panel leads to loser pays in court).
@ Medical/Dental Society candidate forum. Trey Gowdy just dodged, again, the question of malpractice reform. Gave lecture. Took no position
Great door to door off Reidville Road in Spartanburg. "Bring the country together." "Stop the spending." "Stop the bickering."
Trey Gowdy told the people of Union he's for the lake-the mother of all earmarks. Borrow $150 million for a recreational lake? Conservative?
Just @ Lake Bowen (1,534 acres; 79,000 customers) to explain my "no" to a $150 million earmark for Union lake (5,700 acres; 27,000 customers
At a neutral location we can discuss Gowdy's voting history & my voting record. Trey understandably has no voting record, but has a history.
I can understand why Trey Gowdy might not have wanted to come to Let's Talk. His supporters were there, though. So let's get together . . .
By email just now I invited Trey Gowdy to propose a time and place for us to get together to discuss his voting history & my voting record.
Quote: "I've got a friend in Jim DeMint and a friend in Lindsey Graham. Unlike Trey Gowdy I don't abandon friends to advance politically."
Helpful suggestion from Trey Gowdy supporter @ Let's Talk: Tweet the quote that didn't make it into G News story on Hollings contribution.
Come on out to lunch today at noon at Yanni's in Spartanburg. Must admit never to thinking of giving to D and having my dad cover me on R!
New development to discuss with Trey Gowdy. Said in Friday G News he gave $1000 to Hollings and then got his Dad to cover him on GOP side.
Really want to talk Hollings/Graham/McCain voting history with Trey and compare that to my voting record & voting history. Yanni's @ noon.
Disappointed that Trey Gowdy didn't join us for breakfast Let's Talk in Simpsonville. But maybe he will join us for lunch @ noon @ Yawns
Trey couldn't take the pressure? Just can't say no? Or is it that Trey just isn't loyal to conservative principles? $1,000 to Sen. Hollings?
So it was a sense of loyalty to his Democratic employers that drove Trey Gowdy to give $1,000 to Senator Fritz Rollings. G News today.
Southwest Airlines is a great airline. They have fun flying, a customer-centered culture and low fares. Oh, that gov't could be Southwest!
Just spoke to Karen Lewis, VP of Gov't Affairs for Southwest Airlines. They are coming to GSP! Wow is that exciting!
So what's the Gowdy/Thomas/Lee/Jeffries argument again? Inglis not 100% ACU? 92-93% is good; perfection will take a little longer.
Glad to have just been declared an "ACU Conservative" by the American Conservative Union. Score for '09: 92%. Lifetime ACU score: 93%.
Impressive results at Langston Charter Middle too. I'm told they are the only middle school in Greenville County making AYP last 4 years.
Great to be at Langston Charter Middle School tonight for a 4th District candidate forum. Impressive students and impressive parents.

Diverse opinions at the doors this afternoon, but everyone looking for solutions. Common theme: find what works consistent with our values.
Door-to-door on Spring Valley Drive in Spartanburg. Congressional Art Competition at 6:00 at Hub-Bub then Spring Fling.
In election season and out of election season, I've found door-to-door to be the best way to find out what folks are thinking. Come join me!
In DC now but looking forward to door-to-door this weekend. Want to join me? Click here for details: http://wurl.ws/kZNm
Chamber of Commerce Award today. NRA endorsement yesterday. This week is off to a very good start.
Very glad to have received the Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise Award today. Here's the link: http://wurl.ws/tvfP
NRA endorsement on their site: http://wurl.ws/uHgQ . It's a big deal to have the support of constitutional guardians like the NRA.
Very excited that the NRA announced its endorsement today. You can read about it here: http://wurl.ws/DNKU
Can't wait to tell Mary Anne that Mrs. Collins & her home health nurse say that I look younger than they thought (& that I have nice ears).
Door to door on Elizabeth Drive (off of Lee Rd) in Greenville. Good feedback. Folks like conservative voting record.
Good that new cap & trade has nuclear and off-shore drilling. Needs to cut FICA tax and shift tax to pollution. Cut & shift, not cap & trade
The new cap and trade bill has the same main problem as the old one: it's a tax increase. The solution must be and can be revenue-neutral.
This Navy Seal (Julio Huertas) was offered a reprimand but wanted the opportunity to clear his name in military trial. HIS NAME WAS CLEARED!
Case arose from murder of 4 US contractors whose bodies were burned, dragged through streets and hung (2 of them) from bridge in 2004.
Very glad one of the Navy Seals was cleared today of wrongdoing in the beating of an Iraqi prisoner suspected of murdering US contractors.
Said to me at Greenville Let's Talk today (my 128th since 2004): "I had no idea how conservative you were until the signs started going up."
Just leaving GE Aviation's announcement of 100 jobs being added to the 140 now at The Matrix in G'ville. GE really is imagination at work!
On my way to our 127th Let's Talk. Paul Ryan's Roadmap is the topic @ 7:30 @ Denny's, Reidville Rd., SPA; noon @ Golden Corral, Cherrydale
Also glad to be one of the 12 cosponsors of THE most aggressive plan to balance the budget--Paul Ryan's Roadmap for America's Future.
Real anger on the streets today about the spending. Folks want it stopped. Glad to have voted for THE most conservative budgets possible.
We need to be accountable and pass a real budget--one that shows how we will close the $1.4 trillion deficit and pay off $13 trillion debt.
Disturbing that D leadership may not bring a budget to the Floor. They are talking of "deem passing" a "budget" in an appropriations bill.
So if you're a politician desperate to move up and you're frustrated by the incumbent's votes fitting the district, just invent a record!
Hard to brand me as a Washington politician when I sleep in the office, come home every weekend, drive used cars and vote like I vote.
Trey Gowdy is  frustrated because my voting record doesn't  fit in with Washington, but it does fit in with the people of SC-4.
Here it comes! Gowdy going negative on TV tomorrow. Knew it would happen. Just surprised that he's making stuff up. Must be desperate.
Just talked with a 37-year educator about innovating our way to better national security, more jobs & cleaner air. Carolina Ave. in G'ville
Grateful for Reid and Barb Lehman hosting a BBQ for us tonight at their house.
Door to door on Fernwood Road in Simpsonville. Kitty just talked to me about keeping estate taxes low. Agreed!
We're leading Asheville so far! Add your vote for Google to bring Google fiber to Greenville. Vote at  http://www.googlefiber.com/
Rained out on door-to-door in Lyman. Knocking on doors in the rain opens you up to "You don't have enough sense to come in out of the rain?
Earlier today at Spartan High and Furman I used pizzas to illustrate the deficit/debt challenge and asked students to spread the word.
Just finishing up door to door on Blue Ridge Lane in Greer. Real concern about deficit/debt. Talked with folks about pizza debt discussions.
Health care was the main topic, of course. Some fireworks. Wish we had in Congress one of Michelin's key values: respect for the facts.
Driving home after "Washington Night in Columbia"--annual State Chamber program featuring panel discussion among SC congressional delegation
All of those things were raised in good questions tonight at Wofford. We should repeal, replace or reform until we get a good solution.
Wofford's health care series tonight showed that health care is about medicine,  ethics, economics, science, history, politics/public policy
At the doors in Converse Heights today deficit/debt, jobs, state budget cuts, energy policy and Saturday mail delivery were the issues.
Celebrating Duke's victory, praying for the West Virginia player with the knee injury, amazed by Butler. Going to be watching Monday night!
At the doors today many folks were talking about the cost of the Democrats' health care package. There's every reason to be concerned.
Reflecting on helpful door-to-door conversations in the McDaniel Avenue area of Greenville today. Stopping the spending is the message.
Folks in Bethel Greene aren't buying D prescription for health care, but they are asking for solutions.
Door to door in Bethel Greene in Mauldin. Consistent message from voters: give us solutions, not scapegoats.
Going door to door on Palmetto Street in Spartanburg. What a beautiful day!
Impressive tour at Michelin's Spartanburg truck tire plant. Wish that Congress had one of Michelin's key values: "Respect for the facts."
Great visits with Haynesworth Sinkler Boyd and Jacobs Engineering. Capable people looking for solutions in free enterprise.
That last questioner at TR forum? The one whom some booed down? He's a Marine who lost the use of his left hand while serving us.
Lively exchange @ Travelers Rest candidate forum this morning. Wish those who booed down the last questioner had known who he was.
Lots of repealing to be done!
Between and after votes tonight been working w/team on breaking parts of health care bill into "repeal," "replace" and "reform" categories
As usual Mike Smith, Spartanburg Herald Journal nails it http://wurl.ws/im5c More to be revealed on embarrassing details of health care bill
At meeting in Capitol with TechNet--a group of tech companies. Microsoft guy is saying right now that America's corporate tax is punishing.
That means that there's nothing written by one Congress (a health care bill) that can't be re-written by the next Congress.
Focusing on the good news--that no Congress can bind a future Congress.
There's no bill passed by one Congress that can't be repealed by another.
What do you do when Congress passes a bad bill? You get a new Congress to repeal it!
Ah, but Dan Lipinski (D-IL) comes through again--standing firm for life, staying consistent on the Stupak language even if Stupak can't.
Stupak disappoints greatly in what he just said on the Floor, arguing against his own language. Loss of credibility.
My friend Dan Lipinski, a pro-life Democrat from Chicago, stands strong for life and votes "no" on the Ds health care bill.
Glad to report that not all of the Stupak Ds are voting for the health care bill.
Astounding that the folks who want this bill can't agree to an outright exclusion of abortion coverage. Why insurance for a $300 procedure?
Sadly, Stupak folks have agreed that an executive order is enough to preserve the Hyde prohibition on abortion funding. That gives Ds 220.
Health care bill costs $1.2 trillion between 2010 to 2020. Taxes start immediately; benefits don't even start flowing until 2014. Watch out!
Federal government will run up a $1.5 trillion deficit this year‚Äî11 times the ten-year "savings" Democrats claim are in the health care bill
The health care bill includes $569.2 billion in job-killing tax hikes during the worst recession in a generation http://bit.ly/bOtfdx
In 1965, Congress said Medicare would cost $9 billion by 1990. In reality it cost $67 billion‚Äîseven times more than the prediction.
The CBO says that if $208 billion is added back in for the doc fix, the bill will create a $59 billion deficit http://bit.ly/8Yiwhq
See a 2 minute video on cram down and the 3,000 letters opposing cram down that I delivered to Speaker Pelosi: www.inglisforcongress.com
Hearing that the Ds are 4 or 5 votes short of 216 needed for health care cram down.
Just left a top secret briefing on Sudan. Briefings in-country are so much more candid and raw than the scrubbed briefings we get in DC.
@ House-Senate GOP conference trying to figure a way to stop health care cram down. Stinks to be in minority, but the people + us = majority
Hearing all kinds of stories about whether or not the D leadership has the votes to cram down health care. Latest was CBO cost trouble.
On Floor now getting ready to deliver 3,000 letters from SC-4 to Speaker Pelosi opposing the health care bill.
If they get the steam roller cranked up by wiring the votes, they plan on driving it through the House on Sat. Some Ds aren't plugging in.
Scott Brown got the keys out of the steam roller of D health care. Now Pelosi, Reid and Obama are trying to hot wire the steam roller.
Glad to talk w/ Bart Stupak just now and to offer a SC pro life encouragement. Bart is a profile in courage for us pro lifers-pray for him
Joining the Wofford pep rally from the Floor of the House. Fun to do a "one minute" congratulating the Terriers on SoCon title & NCAA birth
People in SC-4 are talking to me, though, about ideas to bring down the cost of health care--like tort reform and stopping the free rides.
Let's Talk times today prove that we in SC-4 are not on the Pelosi planet. Don't know where she finds support for health care cram down.
Door to door on Wellington Dr in Moore. Hoping for sunshine between storm clouds. Will be @ Denny's 2306 Reidville Rd from 5-6:00. Join us
Read about Union Lake earmark here:	http://wurl.ws/9pvz Exciting that we got GOP conference to agree to earmark ban today.
Trial lawyers Gowdy & Thomas think they can tell Union "jury" they're for lake earmark & then tell G-SPA "jury" they're fiscal conservatives
Struck by Trey Gowdy & David Thomas' wholehearted support for the mother of all earmarks: $150 million for a recreational lake in Union Co.
Used my time @ conference mic to say "When tax receipts are going to cover only entitlement spending, you stop spending--even on good things
Republican Conference has just voted to ban earmarks for this year. Exciting to get this victory. The people are rising up and being heard.
Amazing that Speaker Pelosi said yesterday @ National Association of Counties, "We need to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it."
Here in House Rep. Conference for session with Sen. McConnell. Coordination with Senate GOP is crucial to stopping cram down of health care.
Key question is "Who does what?" Getting that answer right will get the federal government back in constitutional bounds.
Continuing work on a "Plan of Reorganization" for the federal government. It starts with cutting spending and growing jobs.
Nearly 40 doors and no one for the cram down of health care reform! Going into debate at Fountain Inn Civic Center now.
Going door to door on Banbury Circle in Simpsonville. Let's see how many folks think a cram down of health care reform is OK!
Incredible how folks like Joe Merrit serve our communities. First as a Marine in Desert Storm now as a fireman, Joe is serving and inspiring
I met Joe Merrit through Wounded Warrior Project. Off duty on July 5, Joe witnessed an auto accident and rescued occupants from burning car
At Spartanburg Fire Chief's Assoc. Awards Gala at Summit Place.  Exciting to watch my friend Joe Merrit win the Meritorious Action Award.
Lois on Holmes Drive: "Take your time on health care and get it right." Sounds like good advice to me. Step by step. No cram down.
Going door to door Holmes Drive in Greenville. Linda just told me we've reached tipping point in deficit/debt awareness; folks ready to act.
Don't know where the Ds get the idea they can ram health care through. They're not for it on Honeybee Lane in Taylors, SC!
Going door to door on Honeybee Lane in Taylors (Pebble Creek). A little chilly in the shade and in the wind!
Worked today on a petition that Upstate folks can sign telling Speaker to scrap current bill. Looking forward to  delivering petitions.
Continue to be astounded at the talk of ramming health care through on reconciliation. Amazing that the D leadership would attempt it.
The determination of the American people may give courage to the Washington politicians who live in fear of substantial budget cuts.
As I said at Budget Cmte today, the general interest of the many (paying down the debt) may be overtaking the special interest of the few.
Great to be able to testify at Budget Committee today in favor of Paul Ryan's "Roadmap for America's Future." This may be our time.
I'm calling on Charlie Rangel to step down from Ways & Means chairmanship. There may be a vote this week to take away his gavel.
We've got exciting volunteer opportunities in the Inglis campaign. Connect with us on Facebook or sign up here! 	http://tinyurl.com/y9n7hco
Other than the extreme liberals, I don't know any Ds who are comfortable with a cram-down strategy on health care. D leadership must stop!
Astounding that D leadership would think of using reconciliation to cram health care through. They'd better check with their rank-and-file!
Sgt. Wittman volunteered, aware of the risk. He went to Iraq and then Afghanistan to protect us. Today, a grateful community said thank you
Very affected by funeral today for US Army Sgt. Jeremiah Wittman at Buck Creek Baptist Church near Chesnee. Honor. Duty. Country. Sacrifice.
If we could start over, we could agree on 50-state competition among PRIVATE ins. companies, tort reform & deductability for self-employed.
Wishing that this week's health care summit had cleared the air. There's a way forward to reform. It starts with scrapping the existing bill
It overwhelms me to speak of the sacrifice of America's best and the sacrifice of their families. That they are all volunteers is amazing.
Got to speak on the House Floor tonight honoring US Army Sgt. Jeremy Wittman who was killed by an IED in Afghanistan on 2/13/10.
Terrorists shouldn't be given Miranda rights & shouldn't be tried in US courts. Need to amend Intelligence Authorization to make that clear
Working on amendment to Intelligence Authorization bill that would make it clear that terrorists are to be tried in military tribunals.
Looking forward to our roundtable discussion from 5 to 6 today--just before Spartanburg Chamber Annual Dinner. Join us ! http://wurl.ws/F9UC
Helpful "community connections" lunch with Spartanburg business owners followed by tour of the amazing JM Smith business, Integral Solutions
Headed to Upstate Young Republican meeting at the Bowater Building in downtown Greenville. Come join us for their 7:00 meeting!
Just finished door-to-door on Alpine Way in Greenville. When you begin to get people answering their doors in bathrobes, stop for the night!
Finishing up door-to-door on Alberta Avenue in Boiling Springs. Headed to The Clock for a Neighborhood discussion.
Honored to talk to a fallen hero's wife tonight. Karyn Wittman and daughter Miah (3) have our prayers & her Chesnee family to uphold them.
Really good day in Union today: community leaders lunch, Quick Jobs tour, plant tour at Parts & Machinery, door-to-door, County GOP meeting.
Working on summary of Afghanistan and Pakistan trip. Following news from Marja closely. Having just been near there makes it all very real
Great news that Taliban's top military commander (an Afghan) has been captured in Pakistan. As I saw in Pakistan, our guys get their targets
Pray for America's best on the ground in Marja right now. Pray for them so America is at war and not just America's armed forces at war.
So the attack is underway in Marja, Afghanistan. Our sons and daughters in harm's way. Every one of them is a volunteer. America's best.
Praying Psalm 20 for America's best as they prepare for battle in southern Afghanistan. They are an amazing all-volunteer force.
Reading about impending offensive against Taliban in Marja, Afghanistan. Having just been nearby in Spin Buldak makes it all very real.
We need leaders with the common sense of a tele-town hall meeting caller on Monday night who said "Gotta wait for it; can't borrow for it."
Reflecting on telephone town hall meeting last night. Debt & deficit were uppermost in people's minds. Good Qs about how to get to balance.
Getting ready for telephone town hall meeting. I've got 5 poll questions for participants again tonight. Will be interesting to see results
Tour at Siroflex showed the impact of regulations. They need to stay below 50 employees so as to avoid intrusive federal regulations.
Just toured one of Mitsubishi's lines in Greer. Impressive people, technology and capital investment. Grateful for those jobs!
Tonight's telephone town hall meeting will feature some poll questions. Folks will be able to express their views instantly.
Getting ready for telephone town hall meeting. It's exciting to be able to use technology to keep in touch.
But there's great news in the Upstate: Proterra, CU-ICAR, 1300 jobs! The road to energy independence running through SC is paved with jobs!
Sadly, the majority raised the debt ceiling again today. We're going to fight on to a budget that will get this government back in bounds.
Proterra proves that the road to energy independence runs through SC. And there are jobs on that road! It's about national security AND jobs
Tremendously excited about the announcement expected from Proterra tomorrow. CU-ICAR adds even more jobs & a new set of capabilities!
Hoping to speak tonight on the House floor about the trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Will probably be speaking around 7:30 or 8:00.
Just landed at Andrews Air Force base, returning from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Amazing to see America's best in operation in those places.
We need to go much further than freezing non-defense discretionary. Commission to recommend changes to entitlements makes sense.
Congress has recessed for the day pending the State of the Union tonight. Glad the Pres. is suggesting a freeze on non-defense discretionary
Looking forward to event next month focused on Spartanburg entrepreneurs discussing "Spartanburg's Future & Its Connection to Washington"
Excited to have just gotten the endorsement of Mayor Knox White & Co. Council Chm. Butch Kirven at an event focused on Greenville's future.
Awed by the sacrifice of PFC Geoff Whitsitt. Reflecting on the beautiful celebration of his life at North Hills Community Church today.
Astonished by the number of S. Carolinians standing in honor of Geoff along the route from church to cemetery. So touching for the Whitsitts
In our R majority we never had the magic 60 votes in the Senate, making progress hard. The Ds have had the 60 & they were running the tables
Things feel quite different in DC tonight. Scott Brown isn't a SC conservative but his vote is a steam roller-stopping 41, holding Ds to 59
Constitutional republics need citizens to own them (as in MASS), servants to lead them & soldiers to defend them--like Pvt. Geoff Whitsitt
It was a great honor to speak of Pvt. Geoff Whitsitt last night on the House Floor. To hear about an American hero: http://wurl.ws/M8dS
Wow! Scott Brown wins Mass. The people have been heard over the special interests! Our fabulous constitutional republic corrects its course!
Getting ready to speak on House Floor in remembrance of Pvt Geoff Whitsitt of Travelers Rest, who was killed in Afghanistan on January 13.
Health care steam roller (the one that's been hot wired by Pelosi, Reid & Obama) may short out in Mass--even if Scott Brown just gets close.
Take away from Let's Talk: Tea parties show that Americans are ready to fight debt/growth of gov't.  Hard choices but solutions are at hand
Headed to Let's Talk Greenville at the Ham House. Looking forward to rallying commitment to deal with the debt. Ready to stop the spending?
Glad so many South Carolinians are rallying for life here in Columbia. The years since Roe v. Wade can't dim the hope of righting the wrong
Headed to Columbia for March for Life. Excited about seeing hundreds of others standing up for the sanctity of life.
Especially excited about hearing my energy piece co-author, Art Laffer (Pres. Reagan's economics advisor), here at conservative retreat.
Here @ conservative retreat in Charlottesville, VA where buzz is about MA Senate race. An R just getting close is a huge victory. Gives hope
So aware of the need to pray for America's best. Losing Geoff Whitsitt (from Travelers Rest) in Afghanistan surely brings the war close.
So aware of our dependence on grace when the earth shakes and perhaps 100,000 are killed. Inspired by those moving to help in Haiti.
Praying for the people of Haiti and for all those in motion to help as this disaster brings us closer to our neighbor.
So sad to be missing funeral of our dear friend Constance Antonsen today @ Church of the Advent @ 3:00. Mary Anne will be there-wish I could
Just leaving classified briefing on Christmas day bomber. Crucial that we act quickly and smartly on intelligence obtained.
South Carolina's research universities give us a claim on the future of energy, proving that the road to energy independence runs through SC
Exciting to see new fuel cell labs under construction in Columbia today. USC's Energy Group has impressive capabilities.
Just spoke to Spartanburg Civil Air Patrol. Great group involved in air safety. Appreciate service of cadets who often go into Air Force
Excited to be @ SC TAC this morning. The addition of taxi way at Donaldson will help us draw new industrial recruits. Glad to be part of it
On way to speak to Social Media Club of Greenville. Impressive how information can fly around this big world.
Scouting looked strong this morning @ Upcountry History Museum. Involved leaders and parents + committed Scouts = future leaders for America
Wonderful celebration of the Boy Scouts' 86 years in the Upstate and 100 years in America. Presented flag flown over Capitol this a.m.
So very easy to criticize someone else. Quite another thing to think up solutions. The solution thing is going to be hard for my opponents.
Very excited about the response to my debate challenge. Folks are telling me that they are, in fact, looking for solutions, not scapegoats.
SC engineers can lead a nuclear renaissance. The four plants being considered for SC could provide 12,400 permanent jobs, many high paying.
Great to spend an hour this morning with a room full of engineers at CH2MHill (Lockwood Greene) in Spartanburg. Key topic: nuclear power.
Incumbents typically run from debates. I run to them! Debates are crucial for vetting candidates and ideas. Ready or not, let's debate!
Sending out press release now challenging my opponents to debate. I want to hear their solutions.  It's easy to oppose; harder to propose.
At swearing-in of Mayor and Council of Spartanburg. Looking forward to good things in Spartanburg and grateful for Bill Barnet's service.
Important to note that every Senate Republican has tried to stop health care reform rush. Oh, that we had just a few more Rs in the Senate.
So very disappointed in the Senate. Had hoped they could stop wrong-headed health reform. Now we see how important it is to have 41 votes.
So very disappointed in the Senate. Had hoped they could stop wrong-headed health reform. Now we see how important it is to have 41 votes.
Next vote on House Floor will be "Son of Stimulus" bill that diverts TARP repayments to new spending. Surreal to spend in face of such debt.
On House floor now for debate on debt ceiling increase. Ds will increase debt limit and then move on to pass a bill spending more.
Here's why I was opposed to the bill: http://wurl.ws/CI20	Rep. motion to recommit was same as the amendment I asked for in Rules Committee
Sadly the Democratic majority just passed the "Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" by a vote of 223 to 202.
Poppy trade corrupts, Amb. Eikenberry explained. Getting rid of that illegality is important to developing effective civil governance.
Counting on our military to get control of Afghan territory/stand up credible Afghan security forces so as to eradicate poppy trade.
Also got to ask Amb. Eikenberry about eradication of poppy trade. Absent enforcement, per acre profit drives farmers to poppies, not wheat.
Gen. McChrystal: Manage time line for transfer so as tell Taliban to give it up--trained and sustained Afghan security forces will beat you.
Just asked Gen. McChrystal: 30,000 troops sufficient? He said yes. Asked him if time line for transfer to Afghan forces undermines effort.
My amendment would also require the Treasury to apply all TARP principal and interest payments straight to deficit reduction.
In Rules Committee now asking to amend the Barney Frank "Consumer Protection Act." My amendment would turn off TARP's revolving charge card
In order for science to correct science, data must be transparent and must be open to replication. That's how we advance our understanding.
Just spoke on House Floor against manipulation of climate data. Mentioned signing onto letter calling for investigation by Science Committee
Dick Wilkerson talked about being right-and-approachable as opposed to being right-and-martyr-like. The first gets results.
Had a great campaign event this morning with Dick Wilkerson, CEO, Michelin North America, hosting a breakfast for us. Dick is impressive.
Carlos Gutierrez says "sustainabilty" means making a profit. He's so right. If you can make a profit, it's sustainable. If not, it's not.
At Science Committee hearing on wave & tidal energy. I mentioned Spartanburg entrepreneur Carlos Gutierrez's definition of sustainability.
At Foreign Affairs Committee now listening to Sec. Clinton, Sec. Gates and Adm. Mullen describe Afghanistan policy.
In 7 telephone town hall meetings 65% have said we can create jobs in new fuels. Let's go for it--with young innovators leading the way.
This morning 100% of an AP class @ JL Mann said new car and electricity fuels can create jobs. Last week 90% said so @ Mauldin & Hillcrest
Clemson's win on wind proves that the road to energy independence runs through SC. Our research universities are spawning new-energy jobs.
Very excited about Clemson winning $45 million competitive grant for wind energy test facility to be located at fmr Charleston Naval Base.
Join us @ Bailey's tonight for happy hour @ 6:00 ($50/couple)/ dinner @ 7:00 ($201/couple). See Bragging Rites. Visit with CU/USC stars.
Tonight at Bailey's in Greenville we'll give away a football signed by Coach Steve Spurrier and a football signed by Dabo Swinney.
Those are our special guests for Bragging Rites. Join us tomorrow @ Bailey's for happy hour @ 6:00 ($50/couple); dinner @ 7:00 ($201/couple)
Billy Wingo, Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame Member; George Bennett, Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame Member; Tracey Evans, USC Long Snapper
Join us this Friday night for Braggin' Rites, a documentary about the Clemson-Carolina rivalry. Details at http://wurl.ws/V9wu
Just toured Michelin's US1 plant in Greenville. Saw an incredible commitment to quality and to people. Am I glad that Michelin is in SC!
On way to Let's Talk. . . Jobs at Denny's on Reidville Road in Spartanburg. Noon lunch at Ham House. Join us for breakfast or lunch.
Driving rain cancelled the parade but not the Veterans Day program in Union. Impressive what Union does to celebrate our heroes.
Rain didn't diminish a great Veterans Day celebration in Union. Always inspiring to hear the stories of our heroes.
Headed to Union now for Veterans Day celebration. Thank a veteran today for freedom,  and thank God for sustaining them and us.
With Greer Chamber for breakfast. Talked about Upstate leading recovery, esp. through new energy jobs. Then met with some WWII veterans.
Ironic that Pelosi health care bill may drive up premium costs (by self selection due to guaranteed issue) and cause more to be uninsured.
Lack of collaboration means this glaring flaw of mandate in Pelosi bill wasn't fixed. Bad process = bad result.
Feldstein points out that people will go bare, pay fine, get diagnosed, get "guaranteed issue," driving up premium cost & no. of uninsured
Martin Feldstein, Reagan economist, made this point in Post yesterday. Fine for breaking coverage mandate is less than cost of premium.
Just spoke on House Floor in opposition to Pelosi Health Care bill. Said people will pay mandate fine, go bare and buy insurance when sick
Very concerned about D's strong vote on Rule for Pelosi Health Care. Not good sign. But one D tells me they don't yet have votes for P. bill
Ds seem to be having trouble rounding up the votes for Pelosi bill. We hope to peel off pro-life Ds and public option opponents.
Beginning to hear more and more that the vote on the Pelosi Health Care Bill may be next week, not tomorrow.
Impressive rally on the Capitol steps. Americans expressing themselves and being heard on health care. Hopefully speaker Pelosi hears.
Getting ready to go to rally on Capitol steps against Pelosi health care bill. It's great that there are two busses here from SC-4.
Here's a link to my Floor speech yesterday, listing key problems with Pelosi Health Care Bill. http://wurl.ws/TERg
Latest word: House will vote on Pelosi Health Care bill on Saturday at 6:00 p.m. Just spoke on House floor about abortion problem in bill.
Working on an amendment that would subject members of Congress to public option. It's going to be hard to sell, but I'm giving it a go.
Pelosi health care bill is hardly the answer. Seems that in the 1,990-page bill we could subject members of Congress to the public option.
Last night's telephone town hall meeting showed the need for action on health care--a uninsured cancer patient, a son with a spinal injury
Getting ready for a telephone town hall meeting--just after tonight's votes on House Floor. This one focused on Boiling Springs and Inman.
My Halloween treat was talking today to Mark O'Rourke M.D. He says it's a "privilege" and a "pleasure" to make another campaign contribution
Reading the 1,990 page Pelosi health care bill. If trick or treaters come to our door, I'd better hide the scary 10-pound stack of paper!
Carrying home the 1,990 page Pelosi health care bill. I hope US Air won't count it as a 3rd carry on! Lots of reading ahead of me.
Pelosi health care plan is the wrong prescription. It can't be tweaked; it must be thrown out. We need the prescription pad in other hands.
Co-mingles taxpayer funds for abortion, collects new taxes, cuts Medicare Advantage, doesn't honestly pay for physician reimbursement fix
Pelosi health care bill has a public option to which members of Congress are not subject, voids state-enacted malpractice limits (more)
The Pelosi health care bill is here and it's 1990 pages--even longer than the 1200 pages of HR 3200. The Pelosi prescription is poisonous.
Proterra is one of 3 electric vehicle companies looking at the Upstate. I'm excited about the hundreds of jobs any one of them could bring.
Got to ride on a Proterra bus earlier today. It's here in Washington to show capacities of electric vehicles. Great mpg, great performance.
Last week Ollie North & his cameraman were with the helicopter units that crashed yesterday in Afghanistan. Made the footage very meaningful
Listening to Ollie North tell about his most recent embed with American forces in Afghanistan. He's just shown footage not shown on FOX.
Kemet proves that the road to recovery and the road to energy independence are one and the same. And that road runs through SC!
Reflecting on Kemet's announcement today of 113 new energy jobs. Exciting to see that new production line coming to pass.
I'm looking for movement conservatives bold enough to propose. I'll leave the simple opposing to my primary opponents.
Moderate Republicans look to tweak Dem. proposals. Obstructionists oppose. Movement conservatives aggressively propose the better solutions.
Glad to have a witness from South Carolina teaching us here at Science Committee.
Jobs in SC's forests, jobs in engineering, jobs in manufacturing. That's what can come out of adding wood to coal. New energy works!
Joseph James of Agri-tech (Columbia) working with Kusters Zima (Spartanburg) to dry & grind wood into pellets which are co-fired with coal.
In Science Committee hearing now. South Carolinian telling us about using wood to augment coal-fired electricity production.
"Doc fix" should be honestly accounted for in any plan. Without fix, docs face completely unworkable 21% Medicare cut starting in January.
Senate Dem leaders cooking health care books. Plan to take cost of "doc fix" out of combined Senate bill so as to spend more on other things
Forums like this help us define the tone and texture of the GOP. I'm excited about presenting solutions that will drive economic recovery.
Looking forward to 4th District Candidate Forum tonight @ BMW at 6:30 sponsored by Greenville Chamber PULSE/Spartanburg Young Professionals
Futuristic firms are looking for places and people that "Get it." Showing them that we "get it" could land hundreds of jobs.
Wonder how my primary opponents would talk to the 3 electric vehicle firms thinking of bringing hundreds of jobs to the Upstate.
"Let's go!" or "Let's go back!" Future or retro? That's the choice for SC-4 in primary of 2010.
Hate crimes bill (which I oppose) should never be attached to a Defense bill. Process stinks. Ds diabolical in doing this. I'm voting no.
In GOP Conference now where we're discussing the Dem. majority's decision to attach hate crimes bill to a "must pass" Defense authorization.

Of course, we'll happily receive checks as well! Inglis for Congress Committee, P. O. Box 210, Travelers Rest, SC 29690

Working on a press release advancing 72-hour lay over before bills can be passed. Ramming huge bills though without time to read must stop.
Risk that Blue Dogs will cave. Speaker wants public option reimbursement rate set @ 5% above Medicare. Perpetuates cost shift to pvt payers.
Watch out, that snake's not dead! Congress Daily reports Speaker is working over the CBO numbers, trying to get Blue Dogs on public option.
Topic today at Let's Talk: A right to health care?
Headed to Papa Sam's for Let's Talk Spartanburg at 7:30. Let's Talk Greenville is at noon at Fuddruckers. Join us!
Joe Wilson analogy: I speed, lose control of my car and hit your car. Part 1: I fix your car. Part 2: I pay my speeding ticket. Case closed.
Part 1: Joe Wilson apologized to President. Part 2: He should apologize to House for rule violation. That would end the matter.
Just said to GOP Conference meeting what I said privately to Joe Wilson: apologize to House for rule violation.
Just spoke with Fox Carolina and WYFF with reactions to President's speech.
Pres. should agree to specifically exclude abortion services. Can't pay for plan only by stopping waste, fraud and abuse.
Impressive speech. At least a mention of tort reform. Bold commitment to not increase deficit. Oh that it were provable!
Full House here for President Obama's speech on health care.
Lots of tension in advance of tonight's speech. Joint sessions are always logistical and security feats. This one seems especially charged.
Just visited with WWII veterans from Upstate. Honor Flight brought them to DC to see the memorial of their amazing service.

Even if Chm. Waxman gets health bill through committee, vote on the House Floor won't occur until after August recess.
3  "progressives" (liberals) on Energy & Commerce are balking at concessions to Blue Dog Ds on public option. Chm.Waxman may not have votes.
House Energy & Commerce Committee resuming mark up of health care bill. Blue Dog Democrats may have caved and accepted public option.
If Ds would drop "public option" (gov't owned health insurance plan) and seek consensus, agreeable reform could pass before year's end.
Still unclear as to whether there will be a vote on Democratic health care bill this week. Some talk of delaying August recess.
The Obama Admin. may be learning that really big things (like health care reform) must be bipartisan and are too important to ram through.
We can improve the way we pay for health care while keeping quality & choice of provider. Getting it right is better than getting it quickly

Just spoke with Spartanburg Young Professionals. The economy, selling S'burg, energy and health care were the topics they wanted to discuss.
All taxpayers chipped in to keep banks from collapsing. All taxpayers should benefit from repayment of principal and from interest earned.
Diverting TARP repayment (interest and/or principal) to any other than ALL taxpayers is redistribution of wealth.
Working on getting TARP money repaid to the taxpayers. Pres. Obama and Chm. Barney Frank have hatched  plan to divert interest earned.
Obama and Frank want to give the earned interest to struggling home owners. But it's supposed to come back to all taxpayers, not just some.
On first reading I thought that I must have died and that this was my eulogy in the G News. But I checked and I still have a pulse!

Against this cap-and-trade; for a revenue neutral tax swap. "No" to tax increase, to Wall Street trading scheme to burdening manufacturing.
"Yes" to cutting FICA taxes followed by equal shift to taxing carbon. Apply to imported and domestically produced goods. American solution.
Not one of us is capable of fully living the truths we proclaim. Each of us is dependent on grace. I‚Äôm praying Psalm 51 for Mark Sanford.

Six primary opponents say we need to go back--to scaring people, to saying we're more righteous than everyone else, to dividing not uniting.
I'm for a new way--new jobs, new energy. Solutions rather than scapegoats. Smiles rather than snarls. Reaching out rather than drawing back

Suggestion for Pres. Obama: Go visit the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Invite world media in for tour. Then announce that we're keeping it open.

My answers: Advance conservatism in a hopeful, optimistic voice. It's a winsome philosophy that works and that most Americans can embrace.
Question 1 of 3: Conservatism: Is it about love for country or dislike of our opponents?
Question 2 of 3: Conservatism: Solutions that we know will work or wedges devised to drive votes?
Question 3 of 3: Conservatism: The ideology of a small and angry sect or the governing philosophy of a majority of Americans?

At Heritage Foundation's Conservative House members retreat in Baltimore. Interesting conversations on bus on the way here.

Just landed in DC. Reflecting on a very productive discussion this morning on social media. Exciting new world.
At Greenville County Exec. Committee meeting. Some Republican excitement after being at a great reception for visiting Canadians.
Just discussed revenue neutral carbon tax with Energy Sec Chu. Eliminating the payroll tax and then putting equal tax on carbon makes sense.
Working on emails, phone calls & letters at my favorite office--the little one (12' X 14' with 7 1/2' ceiling) at home. Yeah high speed net!
Taking the kids to school. Being the school bus gives me extra time to be with our kids when I'm home in South Carolina.
Listening to Marcus Lutrell's book Lone Survivor as I drive along. This is going to be a good book about awesome Americans.
Driving home from GOP House retreat in Virginia. Rented car in Roanoke. Airfare too high. Spend campaign money slowly (retreats=campaign $)!
Col. North telling our heroes' inspiring stories. Makes me glad to have written the narrative of my first trip to Iraq: www.house.gov/inglis
Oliver North speaking now. Has the priviledge, he says, of covering hereos: people who put themselves at risk for the benefit of others.
At breakfast listening to Bill Kristol tell House GOP retreat to offer proposals before Ds offer. That way, we're not always responding.
MN Gov Pawlenty--an R from a D family speaking with passion about reaching working Americans and finding solutions on energy and health care
Just asked social networking panel about expectations of electronic relationships with politicians. Fast moving field. Much to learn.
2008 exit polling: most Americans right of center; saw GOP and McCain slightly right of them; Ds as left of them; Obama as left of Ds.
Colson just responded to my question on sentencing discrepency between crack and powder. Says it "makes no sense." Wants sentencing reform
Colson so right to say morality supports financial stability which supports political freedom. Very concerned about utilitarianism.
Colson overproving case on world view of "pragmatism." Surely we should all want to be pragmatic. Using the word doesn't mean you're demonic
Colson: if we don't regulate ourselves, we will be regulated. Cites recent Fed reg requiring proof that borrower can repay. Ya think!
Chuck Colson telling us that the financial house of cards had to collapse because of the moral failure of borrowing without responsibility.
Gov. Daniels just told us that he's never had a consultant. He's written every word of every ad. Present yourself he says.  Sounds familiar.
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana is telling us at breakfast here at retreat never to speak of the "base." Represent all the people, he says.
Newt: Don't gear toward mobilizing the base. Represent everyone in your district. They want jobs, take home pay and savings. We're with them
Newt predicting that stimulus package will soon be seen negatively by a majority of Americans.
Newt reflecting on way Republicans started to win majority in 1994. Things different now? Obama different than Clinton? Post partisan now?
Boehner speaking at opening dinner of retreat: Use new technology to welcome America into a discussion of better solutions.
In economic policy discussion at retreat. Important to let data more than ideology inform diagnosis and treatment.
On bus from DC to House Republican Retreat in Virginia. Hearing from a speech coach now. Says authenticity, preparation and stories are key.

Reflecting on conversation today with a House colleague who says climate change is a hoax designed to keep the world's poor from advancing.
Pres Obama has what it takes to transform through collaboration, drawing strengths from both parties. Ruts in road don't run that way though
Closing comment from Pres. Obama: He'd rather be a one-termer who addressed real issues than a two-termer who didn't. That went over well.
Good question about small % of infrastructure spending in his stimulus package. He says they've got infrastructure that's shovel ready.
Hardest questions for Pres: only 7% of stimulus will be spent in Fiscal Year 2009 and borrowing unsustainable. He acknowledges both problems
There's real desire in this room to figure a way back to prosperity. Pres. and Republicans here expressing deep concern about unemployment.
Good tone and spirit here so far. President Obama is asking for ideas that could improve his stimulus package. Operationally difficult to do
Tough sell here at GOP Conf. for for the President on the stimulus package.  His sincerity is helping him, though. An impressive fellow.
In Republican Conference. President Obama has just arrived.

Tom Friedman is right: America is the country young enough and brash enough to believe that every problem has a solution. Looking young!
Seeing this crowd reminds me of what a Brazillian journalist told me:  electing Barak Obama as President reestablishes the daring of America
My friend Greg Cordell just texted me. Suggests that we all take an oath of new citizenship. Let's do it.
On risers above Inaugural platform now (to the podium left). The crowd on the Mall is beyond belief. A sea of American good will.
On House Floor, getting ready to go out to the risers above the Inaugral platform. Buzz befitting a celebration of a constitutional republic

Chris "disagrees" and Peter is "insulted" by my saying Dems "focus on fairness." Counsel harder line in "Keep Right/No Shoulder" piece.

America, a center-right country, looks first to faith, family and free	enterprise for solutions. We drive on the right-hand side	of the road
Legislate liberty. Mr.Jefferson was onto something when he said in 1782 if it" neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg" there is no injury
Thought: We want collaboration, not compromise. Collaboration draws the best from both parties where compromise is a zero sum game.
Another thought from working on this upcoming campaign piece: Leaders should define us by what we love, not by what we hate.
Working on a piece that says: America's looking for solutions, not wedges. Partisans use wedges to divide. Citizens look for solutions.
