Epilogue: He then went off to Alaska (where he helped w/ the transfer of the land from Russia to the US) &amp; then Louisiana, died in 1869, and is interred in Arlington.		(10/end)
There was a special election to fill the seat, and Rousseau was re-elected to fill the vacancy caused by.... HIS OWN RESIGNATION!		He served through March of 1867!		(9/)
He was formally censured on July 21, 1866, and resigned in protest the same day.		BUT WAIT HERE'S THE TWIST YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR		(8/)
Grinnell was bruised on his head and face, but somehow escaped further injury.		A special committee then investigated both of them, but only Rousseau was punished. Instead of voting to expel him, the House voted to censure him.		(7/)
On the East Front House portico, Rousseau retaliates against Grinnell's remarks by taking his IRON-TIPPED CANE and hitting Grinnell until his cane broke!!		Newspapers at the time reported the Rousseau had armed supporters surrounding him while he attacked Grinnell.		(6/) https://t.co/1dFE551dio
Here's the link to the page in the Congressional Globe if you want to read more of them bickering:  https://t.co/Vu5ll6tegJ		This was June 11. 		Three days pass. We can only assume Rousseau spent three days stewing over the remarks and fuming.		Brings us to June 14. 		(5/)
Grinnell continued w/ insults until the Speaker basically said, "three strikes until you're out, dude."		Another member was censured in the 1860s just for calling a statement "a base lie." Decorum was serious stuff.		SIDE NOTE: There are a lot of good 1860s censure stories		(4/) https://t.co/tFBDLR0F1S
In 1864, Rousseau was elected to the House as an "Unconditional Unionist." 		~time passes, bills are debated, etc etc~		But in 1866, Grinnell of Iowa kept insulting him on the House floor, questioning Rousseau's accomplishments as a Civil War general.		Spoiler: Bad idea.		(3/)
This is Lovell Harrison Rousseau.		A guy with a big name and a bigger life story!		Prior to Congress he:	-was a practicing lawyer 	-served in the Ind. state House of Reps &amp; KY Senate	-fought in the Mexican &amp; Civil War		A busy dude, but we're not even close to the drama yet.		(2/)

@ktullymcmanus I LOVE IT
@JoeKristol how did i live in boston and never become aware of a building named "wigglesworth"
but amelia, don't you keep your name when elected???		sorry, i don't make the rules, i only make the terrible memes
Your name if you were a member of congress is [the river closest to where you grew up] +"[your favorite cocktail]"+ [your freshman dorm in college]		My name is Delaware "Dark n' Stormy" Houston, and you should support my bill.
Despite having his prop taken from him, Celler's point was made. The regulations of Prohibition were confusing and weird!		And that's the story of a little bottle of "tonic" that tried to make its way on to the House floor.		10/end https://t.co/7yzm6MwGxb
(Oops, I forgot to label 3 and labeled 8 as 7 again. ~I am bad at threads~)		For Celler to keep talking, he had to get rid of the bottle, which to the amusement of many, did not leave the chamber at all.		9/ https://t.co/FJKrYrpui5
After much additional puffery form both sides, the Chair rules in favor of Green, because of House rules that would only allow the bottle to be presented if there was no objection.		Here's the procedural gobbledygook for those who are interested: 		7/ https://t.co/KgSXCvAA6Q
The La Gaurdia then both insults the state of Florida and says Celler to that, "If he	does not watch his exhibits they will get into the hands of the drys and he will lose them."		7/ https://t.co/IDWTmZwPs0
Then La Gaurdia steps in (yes the famous politician with an airport named after him) and offers two rebuttals, both of which I particularly enjoy:		1. If you're offended by the display of bottles, you might as well yell about maps		2. LOTS of stuff has alcohol in it		6/ https://t.co/80IhCY7kuQ
Luckily for us, the readers, Celler is FULL OF SASS and lets Green knows if he wants to try some, it tastes like fortified wine.		This Does. Not. Go. Over. Well. with Green.		(insert more procedural motions and goose sounds)		5/ https://t.co/3YWC0086Al
But Mr. Green was having NONE OF THIS alcohol-based foolishness. 		A bunch of parliamentary squabbling (it helps if you imagine goose sounds being made as well) commences.		4/ https://t.co/TA26xe4Kr3
This story also includes my beloved congressional floor props.		So, Mr. Celler (later the longest-serving House member from NY) comes to the floor with a bottle of "tonic" that's supposedly legal under a permit.		(Side note, let's bring back, "What a farce! What a joke!") https://t.co/4SOYLJoa1x
It's vaguely similar to what went down in The Great Beer Hunt of 1918.		*pushes you towards my last Roll Call piece* (https://t.co/gnd8cnILZP)		BUT, now it's 10+ years later. Prohibition had been in place for nine years.		2/
Who's ready for more of my favorite thing?		My favorite thing being PROHIBITION-ERA CONGRESSIONAL DRAMA!		1/

TLDR; who needs cameras when you have microform (end of thread!)
The caption seems to have been cut off when it was converted into microform, but now, "THE GREAT PAPER DELUGE - THE ARTIFICIAL SEA IN THE PLAY OF "MONEY" IN THE NATIONAL THEATER" and "if only you would stop these porpoises from agitating this greenback sea" make a lot more sense!
And thankfully, it was from the edition of the magazine published the same week as it was exhibited on the floor.		Here it is! https://t.co/wynzXT9oL1
(this is already longer than anticipated, so I'll cut to the chase)		It seems to be hard to find paper copies of the magazine, but it IS available on microfilm at the Library of Congress. Which is something I've never dabbled in before... until today!
Most things exhibited on the floor were only listed as [Exhibiting papers] or something similar, so you can't really track down the exact version.		So, I really wanted to figure out what this political cartoon looked liked, because I actually had some solid details about it.
I found this one from February of 1874 about a week ago.		But Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper despite running across many decades and its popularity (apparently)... is not easy view for free online.		https://t.co/DUwiNB9L8c
~a very short LUNCH BREAK ADVENTURE thread~		So, as you may/or may not be aware, my ongoing personal quest is to find out what things were exhibited on the floors of Congress before there were tv cameras.		And today I found one!
