Here's some nostalgia for 90's gamers	https://t.co/lNF1ZDD7Os
Watching Mr. Nightmare.  He has such a nice listening voice, tone, and speed.  He truly knows how to use his vocal toolbox. listen to his true stories, if you're brave enough.  I think the stories of yenaldooshi are the creepiest.
If anybody feels like they are going commit to harm people. Then tell somebody how you feel. My old highschool counselor helped me.. My girlfriend killed herself and I lost my mind.. Talking to somebody now and preventing a catastrophe, makes a huge difference now more than ever.
Who cares how you look? Only thing that matters is how you act.

Respect your elders Dangit all.  You may think you know so much, and you may.  But just listen.  Put your concerns aside, it's called being human.  Make 2019 better than the caltrop of 2018.
Want to listen to real talent and not fake majin?https://t.co/PrugVGklL0 I mean fake Minaj.  But they both work and you know it
Happy New Year everybody.  Let us make a difference this year.  Try to donate once a month, more if you're able, especially in weather like this.
Anyone else bothered by LG?  Tech doesn't make life good, is all I mean.
Is anybody out there. Still donating?  It doesn't have to be a holiday to give.	https://t.co/1jgslFg95q

I hope everybody is having a good day, spend time with your family and don't pout.  It's a day to make memorable with loved ones. That is why I wasn't going to get on today, but i had to say that we have to cherish our families and others.

Okay peeps, I don't like twitter but I love people so.. here I am.  I would love for people to go out and buy one scarf and donate it.  Give the less fortunate a Christmas before Christmas.  Just something, think about it while you're sitting cozy by the fireplace drinking coco.
