To make a long story short, @Ilhan has a lot of support here at home in CD5. We know her and trust her. As you get to know her, I know many more people will too.
I know that when they and others in our community here in CD5 reach out to Congresswoman Omar, she listens. And I appreciate national leaders like @ChelseaClinton and @MaxRose4NY working with our Congresswoman in a critical, supportive, collaborative way.
I know and I know that @Ilhan knows that antisemitism is on the rise. It is a serious threat, and one we all need to take seriously with extreme vigilance. I am not Jewish, but I trust and listen to leaders in our local community including @RavMABAY and @mrotzie.
My congresswoman has been subject to vicious attacks. She has had too many death threats to count. And yet she is willing to serve. The people of CD5 know Ilhan. We don't expect her to speak perfectly or be perfect, we know and support her being exactly who she is.
I also know Ilhan as a fierce and unapologetic voice for people who need support. She speaks her mind, and folks aren't always used to elected officials who say what they mean, unsanitized and unpolled. I also know Ilhan as someone who truly, genuinely listens.
My congresswoman and friend @Ilhan has gotten a lot of national attention this week. I first knew @IlhanMN as a city hall policy aid who made sure my blazer was free of breast milk and baby food before council meetings, one of many ways she supported this young mom in politics. https://t.co/HwHgNBLG13

On this long car ride, the 7 year old also told the following joke: ‚Äúwhy did the city council member cross the road?‚Äù Why? ‚ÄúTo get to ward 9.‚Äù
5 year old: mommy I‚Äôm so glad I chose you to be my mommy	Me: you are!?	5 year old: yes because you know which fruits are good and which are bad 	Me: oh	7 year old: shouldn‚Äôt you like her for her policies?
@ajm6792 This is factually true but in his defense I don‚Äôt think he realized it cried + the other 3 members of our family got a whole hour to read while she took care of her various animals and babies with the new items :)
@ajm6792 She tricked my husband. ‚ÄúDaddy I just want something to remember grand maraias.‚Äù Seriously dude?
So true. https://t.co/rfziKywJl5
@ajm6792 I so rarely have nightmares and then I‚Äôm stumbling around at 4am trying to figure out what is happening and if the girls are ok and I‚Äôm like omg it is the plastic milk bottle from Ben Franklin that cries! Why would someone make this terrible thing! üòÇ
I had a dream last night I died in childbirth and then woke up to the real sound of one of my 5 year old‚Äôs toys crying like a baby and so basically I‚Äôm never sleeping again.

More diversity in general in the press - like in public office - will help build trust and faith in these important institutions &amp; bring more depth of perspective to public discourse.
Agree!

@sarabronin So yes we need to implement the plan through many mechanisms: zoning, budget, infrastructure, stand-alone ordinances, etc - but the land use piece is legally required and legally binding under state law.
@sarabronin To clarify- I know laws differ around the country, our plan is required by state law, the land use map is legally binding, and our zoning code is required to be consistent. We also included for the first time a "development intensity map" which is kind of a hybrid land use/zoning
Great in depth detail on @mpls2040 and how it fits into a national conversation. We are proud of our work in Mpls and also constantly talking to and learning from electeds &amp; others in other cities. We are facing the same issues &amp; support each other‚Äôs leadership. @LocalProgress https://t.co/ZjZpu16a79
@sarabronin @Slate @esquire @CityMinneapolis @gabriellebruney @henrygrabar @Jacob_Frey @CityLab @kristoncapps My colleagues and I are part of many national conversations about this and are so lucky to learn from the experiences of other cities looking at racial inequity generally and in housing specifically -- along with rising rents and displacement. There is a lot of work to do!
@sarabronin @Slate @esquire @CityMinneapolis @gabriellebruney @henrygrabar @Jacob_Frey @CityLab @kristoncapps Thank you! It was the result of years of work and yes we need to update our zoning code (are required to by state law), which will happen incrementally starting next year. In the meantime property owners could use ADUs or apply for rezoning to add units. https://t.co/ZyzDquZdwS
Good in-depth look at the importance of community engagement led by CPED and NCR for Minneapolis 2040. We also approved the engagement plan as a city council &amp; then approved 14 goals ‚Äî bringing items through incrementally was important to build consensus. https://t.co/kS5FJCUZHA

@janneformpls @sharethecities @Jacob_Frey Thank you. It is so hard for people to recognize the leadership of women! I see it when people have my back, and appreciate it so much.
And the new City Council is just getting started -- it is an honor to serve with this incredible group of leaders and to serve as the Council President during this incredibly busy and productive first year. My colleagues are amazing!

@WedgeLIVE Aw, thank you!
@byjessielee @CallaghanPeter Staff in CPED is working on financial tools expected to be in place next year for the permanent ordinance which would apply to all projects and give a choice between 10% of units at 60% AMI with no subsidy or 20% of units at 50% AMI with city funding to help subsidize rents.
@byjessielee @CallaghanPeter Starting in Jan projects will be required to do 10% of units at 60% AMI if they meet a common threshold a bit in the weeds: a 60% increase in allowed floor area ratio. This will apply to many projects outside of downtown (which was upzoned long ago with no affordability req).
@RobinGarwood @webster @StarTribune It matters when me men call it out. When women do the press just further mocks us.
Our work follows the lead of community members and leaders who give voice to community priorities. Our city is facing many challenges, growing under a federal administration that is attacking cities and our communities. We are so grateful to all of the folks who get involved.
I am honored to be in a position to provide leadership to this City Council which is filled with thoughtful, bold leaders. The accomplishments of my colleagues this year are many. Each was achieved through deliberate and respectful collaboration. And we are just getting started.
Today, the City Council unanimously forwarded the @mpls2040 and an amended 2019 budget (nearly unanimously) to the final City Council meeting of the year coming up on Friday. Both make historic commitments to race equity, affordable housing and fighting climate change.
Great summary of the high level changes the council made during budget markup last week. Our final public hearing and budget amendments are tomorrow (Wednesday) night starting at 6:05pm. All are welcome, or you can always contact your CM with feedback or questions. https://t.co/lA4Obe2d7s
@karalynum (And if you agree with what your CM is doing, it is always great to note support!) :)
@karalynum Yes! I know I was happy to support this amendment to the mayor's proposed budget brought by CMs Fletcher and Cunningham when we amended the budget and I fully expect it to pass in the final budget. Notes about priorities are always great to get from constituents and stakeholders!

Such a great and busy week! @byjessielee wrote a smart and detailed summary of the markup of our @Mpls2040 plan earlier this week. It was no small feat, but most of the amendments including the ones to our maps were unanimous. https://t.co/f6W3fwdPWv
This is one part of work supported by many CMs in coordination with the organizations leading to support and advocate for low income renters in Minneapolis: @IX_Unidxs @HOME_Line @MakeHomesHappen doing incredible work to give voice to more than 50% of people who rent homes.
Passed 2 renter support budget changes with CM @jeremiah4north 1) $500k more for legal representation for low income renters facing eviction and 2) $2 mil in a revolving fund used for bringing Tenant Remedy Actions on behalf of renters against problem landlords who shirk repairs.
Yesterday was a marathon 15 hours at city hall but so worth it ‚Äî thank you again to everyone who came to the budget hearing, which even ended in a beautiful song! Today: inclusionary zoning this morning at 10. Tomorrow: budget markup same time same place. Getting it all done!
Right now, I'm also leading the effort to build consensus in the council for our very good @Mpls2040 plan, passing an inclusionary zoning ordinance and working with my colleagues to amend and adopt our city's budget, so I'm going to get back to those things now.
Guys, we shovel our sidewalk! I've been leading an effort along with a bunch of other CMs to more aggressively enforce clearance because we need our city to be accessibly year-round to people on foot or wheelchair and that should apply to me too, as it did one time last winter.
@mattdelong @dbrauer I know you didn‚Äôt set one up but it is still a real thing, ya know?
@mattdelong @dbrauer I know you guys are kidding but it‚Äôs a little scary to suggest monitoring my home where two children live. I receive threats, not as frequently as others, but still a reality of my job.
We are about halfway through our hearing on the mayor‚Äôs budget hearing. It is an honor to chair the hearing and welcome so many thoughtful people here to testify on the city‚Äôs budget. We will make 1st amendments on Friday.
More great news from today: my inclusionary zoning ordinance to require affordable housing in all development passed the housing committee unanimously! If it passes council it will phase in starting in January next year.
Huge news! This will provide needed transit service along the 35W corridor. Thank you @MetroTransitMN for all of the work that goes into planning &amp; finding funds for these investments. https://t.co/QuKf0O3R3E
The staff who have worked in my office over the past five years have all touched this work and I so deeply appreciate them, their support and all of their hard work!
So many people got engaged and the feedback made a huge difference -- and will continue to affect policy as we go about implementing the plan. Thank you to everyone who got involved! All materials will be available here: https://t.co/ukVvZIRvYv
Our staff at CPED, the City Clerk's office and across the enterprise have gone above and beyond in so many ways, they did truly amazing work to develop a draft @Mpls2040 and support the City Council in bringing the plan through our process for approval.
Most of the amendments today, including an amendment I brought to the land use and built form maps, passed unanimously. I appreciate how much effort my colleagues put in to working together collaboratively and to ensuring that local context didn't impact our citywide goals.
Today the Minneapolis City Council forwarded an amended comprehensive plan for final adoption that is centered in ending racial disparities, supporting housing and transportation options in all neighborhoods and that makes strong local commitment to fight climate change.
@EthanFawley It's almost like we are voting on the comprehensive plan tomorrow.

@nickmagrino @mpls_mikeh @WedgeLIVE It is still better than than interior 2 or 3 on these corridors.
This grew out of conversations in specific wards, but I am working with colleagues and staff to look for a proposal that makes sense from a citywide standpoint. I stand by the plan's overall goals &amp; am working very hard to set us up well for implementation.
One change I‚Äôve shared about recently - and happy to answer questions about it - is creating a new corridor designation ‚Äúcorridor 3‚Äù https://t.co/GaJ8tXpqMW
And, I am working on a series of amendments to the built form map that attempt to take feedback we have heard from around the city into one amendment that maintains the plan's overall direction and goals. I am still working on finalizing this proposed amendment.
I have an amendment that will come under the housing goal that will strengthen language about emphasizing transportation investments in growing neighborhoods which I've worked on in coordination with CM Fletcher.
I have one more change to propose to the implementation chapter, simply adding the words "with an emphasis on improving building design" into language about how we will approach zoning code updates. This is so important to so many of our constituents.
The other two were amendments to the implementation chapter to strengthen commitments to race equity, authored with CVP Jenkins. We will also direct staff to prioritize and report back regularly to the Race Equity committee on tracking progress.
Today, I brought 4 amendments that passed forward. Two were items that the Planning Commission had recommended that were very specific -- I moved to remove them and rely on other language that is already in the draft plan. One was related to bldg setbacks and the other to solar.
After today's @Mpls2040 meeting, we made it through amendments proposed by the Planning Commission and amendments related to 3 of 14 goals. We added another special COW meeting this Wednesday morning from 9:30am-12:30pm to hopefully finish discussing Council Member amendments.
You can watch it here: https://t.co/bhUNwXIlUX
We are in the special Committee of the Whole meeting about the @Mpls2040 plan, first reviewing and voting on amendments passed by the City Planning Commission on October 29. Then, CMs will offer amendments to the plan that staff has organized by goal for purposes of discussion.
@mpls_mikeh @WedgeLIVE @Mpls2040 Yes. I believe some CMs are bringing a larger volume of more like text edits. Most CMs are focused on a few substantive changes.
@mpls_mikeh @WedgeLIVE Staff has organized all that they had by COB on Tuesday, working on Wednesday and then some working over the thanksgiving holiday unfortunately, to categorize by goal and send back to CMs to use for their own communications.
@mpls_mikeh @WedgeLIVE Markup is tomorrow. The whole record will be posted online. Amendments that pass will be forwarded to COW on Dec 5 for our regular meeting. I think most CMs tried to stick to a handful of meaningful amendments at this point but it sounds like there will be a large number.

I am also so grateful for all of the work of housing advocates and folks who are fighting for renters facing unsafe housing and displacement. @IX_Unidxs @Homes4AllMN -- I am hopeful that our inclusionary zoning and renters bill of rights policies will both pass soon.
One thing I won't forget: I am 40 years old and it was striking to me that at the City Council's public hearing nearly every person younger than me spoke strongly about climate change. We hear you: we know we have your support, your mandate, your demand to do everything we can.
I am grateful to all the people who took the time to attend the 100+ community meetings about this plan, submit the 1000s of comments and who came to hours of public testimony. We are doing our best to strike a balance but not compromise on the overall goals of the plan.
Our city is growing. We have the country's worst racial disparities. While folks differ on the details, I know that people in all Minneapolis neighborhoods support a vision for our city that is more equitable and that fights climate change. I am confident our plan will help.
Spent all day working with my colleagues and staff on final ideas for @Mpls2040 before Monday's meeting to consider proposed changes, the culmination of years of work. I love my job. I am so honored to work with smart and dedicated colleagues and staff who go above and beyond.
@happifydesign I am sorry this happened, it is my #1 goal this term to create supportive and open spaces for everyone to participate in community meetings without this kind of interaction, and I appreciate you showing up always -- including all of your volunteer time on the PAC! It matters.

The next step for the plan is a committee of the whole meeting on Monday, November 26 at 10am when council members will be able to offer and discuss amendments. This will not include a public hearing to give time for this important work and discussion.
Thank you to everyone who came to tonight‚Äôs public hearing about @Mpls2040 during five hours of testimony. Though we did not hear from every ward, staff and my colleagues have done extensive engagement and we are working together to approve a plan that meets all of our goals.
Congratulations, Mayor! Best of luck in the home stretch this afternoon. https://t.co/ylBtmvDIm4
@Volantene @JoeySenkyr @Mpls2040 Agree
@Volantene @JoeySenkyr @Mpls2040 Open to feedback but we are getting comments from folks around the city about this - any that are narrower or with less frequent transit service.
This is how new leaders and incumbent leaders with institutional knowledge and expertise can work together. Excited to see the partnerships emerging in this new Congress! https://t.co/RZZVzeGe7a
@JoeySenkyr @Mpls2040 Staff is working on this and all of these details would be worked out in zoning guidance but I think it would be a bit more flexible than interior 3.
6- working with CM @KevinReich4NE to support our colleagues bringing amendments about community engagement, supporting seniors, supporting wealth-building and job creation in communities of color, creating new cultural districts and more.
5- supporting colleagues in making minor adjustments to land use &amp; development intensity proposals with a lens toward supporting the overall direction of the plan citywide and maintaining our overall goals of race equity, housing options and environmental sustainability.
4- making sure my inclusionary zoning ordinance passes to better leverage private investment to provide affordable housing units, with lots of work and support from CM @jeremyschroeder.
3- with CVP Jenkins (@annapoetic) &amp; others, strengthening race equity commitments in the action steps and implementation chapter, including a staff direction to report on implementation priorities and measuring progress to her Race Equity Subcommittee.
2- with @FletcherMpls, strengthening changes the CPC made that will focus infrastructure investments like transit &amp; access to transit in dense and growing nhoods. If we continue to grow near transit, we need to invest in safe and accessible transportation options.
For any of my constituents coming to speak tonight at @mpls2040, here is what I am working on, and I welcome your feedback!	1- re-examining Corridor 4 &amp; considering a new development intensity category ("Corridor 3") that could be used for narrower transit streets like Bryant
The City Council passed two significant new protections for renters and an expansion of funding incentives for landlords to keep rents low, learn more in our Ward 10 newsletter: https://t.co/8DlMYi9TaW
Wonderful news: the City Planning Commission has recommended our inclusionary zoning ordinance to the City Council -- it will come through for approval along with our @Mpls2040 comprehensive plan as one way to make sure new growth contributes to keeping Minneapolis affordable.
@katebrickman @pavethewhales @Mpls2040 Gee I love it when my friends follow me on twitter. ;)
Thank you to the @MakeHomesHappen coalition representatives who stayed through a long City Planning Commission meeting to speak in support of my inclusionary zoning policy. We have been talking about this for years, analyzing the numbers, and now it is time to take action.

My grandfather &amp; my dad are both veterans, two of so many who have served in war since the declaration of armistice &amp; peace 100 years ago. Serving in war is a tremendous sacrifice for our veterans and their families and I am hopeful that future generations build and choose peace.

I almost forgot: inclusionary zoning that will require affordable housing in all new housing development
cc reporters who report reality ;) @AndrewMannix @jaymboller @DthomasJournals @byjessielee
The big moves I think we need to make are:	-better design for all new buildings 	- prioritized investment in transit/walking/biking in dense &amp; growing nhoods	- strong commitments to race equity and environmental justice
If anyone wants to see how beautifully these small multifamily buildings blend in, there are examples all over the city.
@mpls2040 is far from a radical departure from what we have been doing. It is an incremental change that would slowly allow more small multi-family duplexes and triplexes around the city and will continue to support growth near transit.
PSA: we already ‚Äúeliminated single family zoning‚Äù four years ago when the city council legalized Accessory Dwelling Units in owner-occupied homes citywide. So, in majority owner occupied nhoods, almost all lots can have 2 units. In 4 yrs, there have been about 100 citywide.

Speakers from #reclaimtheblock ask us to "dream bigger" and "be the ancestor that someone can be proud of." I really have not captured the eloquence of the speakers and their stories, you should listen for yourself.
Two speakers have voiced support for the mayor's proposed Stable Homes, Stable Schools initiative -- I am excited about this potential partnership between the City and Minneapolis Public Schools and look forward to learning more details.
Speaker pointing out racial disparities in home ownership in Minneapolis -- asking for intentional and deliberate action to invest in building wealth in the black community and particularly to support closing the racial equity gaps in home ownership.
Request from our Transgender Equity Council for continued funding for the staff person who supports their work.
Thanks to @HOME_Line for all you do in the community. Speaker came to support proposed investments in increasing rental housing inspectors and increased legal protections for low-income renters.
Speakers from #reclaimtheblock asking for City Council to move ongoing funding to renter protections, preservation of affordable housing and community investments using a 5% reduction in MPD budget. You can watch the comments this morning here: https://t.co/bhUNwXIlUX
Speaker from @JCA_MN makes the connection between these issues: pass renter protections, create sustainable funding for affordable housing as a priority over funding more police.
Speaker from @CityofLakesCLT shares that a lack of local match has been a barrier to leveraging state funds for long-term affordable housing in the land trust.
Great turnout at this morning‚Äôs budget hearing. Two main themes: 1) invest in long term sustainable funding for affordable housing, including preserving older buildings that are affordable today. 2) #reclaimtheblock and invest in communities, not more policing. https://t.co/7wZFbQX1qK

Many evictions are filed because of nonpayment of small amounts of rent, yet Hennepin County has millions of dollars in emergency rental assistance unspent each year. We hope to bring policy changes early next year that will reduce eviction filings &amp; increase access to the funds.
Renters who even having an eviction *filing* on their record ‚Äî otherwise known as an unlawful detainer or ‚ÄúUD‚Äù ‚Äî even if they are not evicted, find it almost impossible to access housing. Expungement proceedings filed now will not be heard until November + months more to clear.
This afternoon @jeremiah4north and I went to observe Hennepin County housing court, where the majority of landlords have legal representation and the majority of tenants do not. This is one of the structural inequities in rental housing we hope to work with partners to correct.

@zacharywefel There is no new draft, most CMs haven‚Äôt met with staff yet.
I am also talking with my colleagues from wards like mine that under the new plan will likely continue to see most of the growth to make sure the city is adequately planning for transportation and other infrastructure needs in already dense and growing parts of the city.
I, for example, am working with a number of CMs and staff to support needed affordable housing. Council Vice President @annapoetic and I working to ensure comments from a strategic planning session focused on race equity are incorporated, something many CMs will likely lead on.
Most of those meetings haven‚Äôt taken place yet and those council members‚Äô perspectives are important. I‚Äôm glad that most of my colleagues are working together collaboratively to build consensus for a plan that meets our goals and the needs of each ward.
There is no new draft of the Minneapolis 2040 plan. CPED planning staff divided up at 10,000 comments in addition to those received at all the public meetings. Over the next week, they will meet with all council members and the mayor to incorporate feedback from each of us.

@GettingGophery @flanaganagain_ @fishmanpet @alexschief there is a lot of detail from the economists from Grounded Solutions Network, who work on affordable housing policy, in the presentation they gave to us yesterday: https://t.co/9q21HHuvgn
@fishmanpet @alexschief It is just how this kind of policy works, which is to require a certain % of units within new market-rate buildings to be affordable. Doesn't work in a 1-unit building. However, this is one of many strategies including need for a dedicated source of funds for affordable housing.
@jeremyschroeder Your support &amp; leadership on this is critical, thank you Council Member @jeremyschroeder!
@alexschief But an inclusionary zoning policy would not apply to single family homes.
@alexschief There is no planned impact fee. Whether or not to have a cutoff for building unit size or not is one of the many details that needs to be worked out for a final policy,.
@alexschief or should say, that fit within the goal of not stopping housing from being built because that would 1) worsen our supply problem and 2) not get us affordable units because IZ relies on housing to be built. I was clear yesterday this is one of many strategies needed overall.
@alexschief assessment of what the market can provide. however, we are trying to structure any financial incentive in a way that we could support deeper affordability with public funds if the council chose to do that.
Very thankful for the support of Housing Policy and Development committee Chair CM Cam Gordon and Vice Chair CM Jeremiah Ellison for this work!
Together with CMs Fletcher and Schroeder, I brought the following staff direction to bring us two policies in November: an interim ordinance that would apply after the comp plan is adopted and a framework for a final policy that probably requires more time on details next year. https://t.co/IQwTC7oMEL

Our Housing committee had a report yesterday on my inclusionary zoning, or "mixed income" housing, ordinance. My goals are:	1) use this as one tool to support affordable housing in all nhoods	2) not exacerbate our city's very low (2%) rental vacancy rate	3) be consistent and fair

CM @jeremiah4north included a staff direction to engage with organizations of color to find ways to target this program to help expand community- based ownership particularly among organizations and residents of color. A great addition to the program.
A new loan program to preserve affordable housing in small &amp; medium properties where we h ave the majority of "naturally occurring" affordable units in Mpls &amp; which represent the area of highest opportunity to preserve units &amp; reduce tenant displacement.

The next step for this is a charter commission meeting next Wednesday, August 8 where they will decide if they want to forward back to the city council for final approval for the 2018 ballot. If not we could work to get it on the ballot in 2020.
The kind of institutional and cultural change we need in our police department doesn‚Äôt come easily. We need more transparency and public participation in these decisions. That is why I support this change.
We have an ordinance that says MPD can‚Äôt ask about immigration status or participate in deportations. But it‚Äôs not clear we can set rules about use of force, training, how to handle rape investigation or domestic violence calls, to name a few. A charter change would clarify this.
The Mpls City Council forwarded language by CMs Gordon and Fletcher to the charter commission to ask mpls voters if they want to give authority to the city council to set rules and regulations for MPD. We aren‚Äôt confused. Our city attny says the current charter is unclear. https://t.co/fEeP08MMon

So, in the end a majority of council members voted to move this forward to the full council on Friday, when we will vote whether or not send the language to the charter commission for review.
A number of CMs voiced the position that we already have policy authority over the police department so there was a staff direction to ask the city attorney to clarify that. The verbal answer had so much ambiguity that I don‚Äôt think it justifies stopping this conversation.
There was opposition from some who wanted to leave the charter as it is which gives full authority to the mayor. There were a number of reasons for this including a lack of trust in the council. Fair enough - this would be what folks would be able to vote on through the ballot.
I will likely miss some themes from the testimony but a few highlights: there were comments that would wish us to go farther in giving more direct citizen oversight over police. I am open to many ways to consider doing this. I don't think this charter question precludes it.
This is the amendment that CM Fletcher brought that we approved earlier in the meeting after significant public testimony. https://t.co/TCkwKk1nAJ
The council is having a joint meeting of two of our committees to consider a proposal to put on the ballot a question to the voters: whether or not to give policy authority to the city council. If the council voted yes on this proposal it would next go to the charter commission.
@penguinest @MetroTransitMN @FletcherMpls Oh I know. I asked about this many times. I was told not possible now but desired for future dedicated transit lane

@dwofthepeople @dbrauer To be clear, there will almost certainly be changes to the draft land use map, but we also need to be ready for an interim period when the land use map takes effect and when zoning would be updated. Also Met Council will need to review and approve our plan.
@dwofthepeople @dbrauer I am meeting with staff soon about my ward, I will ask how they currently envision corridor 4 translating into zoning. In this kind of example, the existing zoning would apply but there could be rezoning applications. I am working on making sure we are ready for all of that.
@dwofthepeople @dbrauer Ah yes, I took David‚Äôs original question to be about the areas that are currently R1
Life in the United States of America, 2018 https://t.co/cr5pEFFvZQ
@dwofthepeople @dbrauer The existing zoning code would stay in place until it is updated. Anyone who wants to make changes under the land use changes would to comply with the current zoning rules.
@dbrauer @dwofthepeople I agree we need to do a much better job communicating about all of this. I also have to focus on my own ward where there are significant changes proposed, but happy to dig in more to how land use would translate to zoning in the 60% of the city that only allows single family now.
@dbrauer @dwofthepeople There are actually a lot of nonconforming duplexes and triplexes in Minneapolis. Some have been legalized through accessory dwelling units. Otherwise you need to apply for a rezoning to make the unit legal.
@dbrauer @dwofthepeople No. Here is an example. In today's Z&amp;P meeting, we approved a rezoning for a triplex in a part of town zoned for duplexes. After the new land use map is adopted, this would still need a rezoning. However we could change it in the future so it doesn't need to go through a rezoning
@dwofthepeople @dbrauer There would need to be zoning code changes to allow for what I understand as the intention of the draft proposed land use changes: to allow more units in buildings of the same size that are allowed to be built today. Right now you can do this through an "accessory dwelling unit"
@dwofthepeople @dbrauer This is a good question -- first I want to say that any land use map, including the current one, guides but doesn't control zoning. So for any changes adopted in the land use map we need to have a short and long term plan for how that will translate to zoning.
@dbrauer We probably should also take a design-focused look at the 1-4 regulations and see how they work for very small multifamily buildings since they were written focused on single family home design, just to make sure the points really make sense for both.
@dbrauer I wouldn‚Äôt support changes to 1-3 unit sizes, I think we need better zoning standards for 4 unit bldgs. I made a small change last year to make it harder to build tall skinny 4 unit bldgs which we have in my ward, we need to start with design and make sure our zoning aligns.
@dbrauer I could go on an on about this. We just adjusted regulations for 1-4 unit bldgs in 2014. That was in response to all the tear downs in ward 13. https://t.co/4Lcj8oWncR
@dbrauer No
@flanaganagain_ We are working on a bunch of stuff - more info coming very soon!
If anyone tries to tell you renters ruin a neighborhood show them this ward 10 awesomeness https://t.co/WSPSztHpXm
Here's the agenda with details: https://t.co/KmzRkYSHcg
Today's HPD committee has two renter support items: 1) update on the funds we provide for legal support for low-income renters to get repairs made and 2) a new pilot program for emergency housing for renters facing eviction because of licence revocation or condemnation
Such a thoughtful article from @MinnPost on the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan with more context on the plan's grounding in our city's history of racial exclusion in housing and how we might evolve from that history. https://t.co/mPqkuCvl6u
All companies that enter our market will be given the same chance to comply with the rules. We don‚Äôt want to confiscate scooters, we want a collaborative relationship with the companies.
We passed an ordinance on Friday with basic rules for operation including a required license with the city. That liscence is going to our TPW committee tomorrow at 10am and then should be approved by council this cycle.
I am getting a lot of emails from bird scooter customers about our proposed license which would include a cap on the initial number allowed. This is included because there are other companies entering our market. Other cities have had problems with big numbers rolling out at once https://t.co/CrWzPnrmVb
@alexcecchini What I‚Äôve gleaned from emails to my office is concern that the SW Minneapolis schools will become more overcrowded if more people with children are able to move in.
Alternative method observed today: gently saying ‚Äúwe are passing by on the left, great job!!‚Äù
@mdgrffn Shoot me an email with your block and I will take a look! A lot of the comments I am getting are opposed to allowing another unit in the new McMansions. I‚Äôm not saying that is what you are saying - this is why it is very helpful to be specific!
@mdgrffn If you live in ward 10 the land use allows at least duplexes everywhere now
@Earthlamb @janetbomar What would you propose instead? That is a sincere question from a CM who is hearing people say ‚Äúput all the stuff we don‚Äôt want into your ward.‚Äù
@mdgrffn We are going to have a land use map. It can be the one we have, which requires no affordable housing and allows dev in very few places, or a new one. Specific thoughts are most helpful
@mdgrffn Detailed comments about ward 10 are welcomed by email to Lisa.bender@minneapolismn.gov or on the website. I am mostly hearing from folks who live in single family nhoods outside my ward who want all development to go into mine and the few others where the status quo allows for it
@mdgrffn I would actually say 100% of the ward 13 residents who came to the ward 10 meeting are opposed to welcoming the housing types that are common in ward 10.
@mdgrffn The ones proposed for ward 13?
@Julietilsen I‚Äôm going to need the comments to be more specific about exactly what is so terrible about my community.
While housing has captured most of the attention around the plan, it has policies that impact economic development, small business access, industrial land and jobs, environmental policies, transportation and a lot more. It's all important for our city's future.
I am also working on a package of protections from renters who are facing eviction and rising housing costs, and I hope these will be supported, too. There is and will be opposition to both of these ordinances.
I think we need to require more from new development and do more to create mixed income communities. I have been working on an ordinance that would require affordable units in new buildings like the ones along the greenway and I hope there will finally be support for this.
These images are from the discussions about single family teardowns in 2014, which resulted in more restrictions on the size of 1-4 unit housing. No one has proposed changing those size restrictions. https://t.co/sDlnmyfaZL
The reality is that a lot of teardowns are happening now in single-family neighborhoods to make way for larger single family homes. We had a lot of discussion about this as we moved to make these new homes smaller a few years ago.
My ward is 80% renter by population and is filled with duplexes, triplexes and smaller multifamily buildings. Narratives about renters ruining neighborhoods by living in buildings of the same size and scale as single family homes don't resonate with this experience.
In a growing city within a growing region, we need to figure out where people are going to live. The status quo is not working: it is resulting in rising rents and displacement of our lowest income &amp; most vulnerable residents. More people live alone now and they need housing.
I look forward to similarly working with my colleagues to build support for a final plan that makes meaningful progress on race equity and climate change and that supports housing and transportation options and community health in every Minneapolis neighborhood.
Last term, CM Reich and I worked with our colleagues to unanimously pass 14 goals to guide this plan. I stand by these goals, particularly the strong commitment to race equity and environmental sustainability. https://t.co/mM8Lu0OjXb
I think the level of engagement has given some the impression that folks at the city think this plan will solve all of the city's problems. No one thinks that. We did, however, see this as one tool to address race inequity, climate change and health.
Today is the last day to comment on the city's draft https://t.co/Gh8N0yOxRG map. We've probably done more engagement on this than anything the city has done in it's history. (I am happy to be corrected, it's 150+ community meetings). If you haven't you should comment!
@GuledKnowmad @mukhtaryare I‚Äôve been trying to pass an inclusionary zoning ordinance for several years. Thank you for the support! Happy to have a council now much more willing to support this approach than last term.

@j_w_84 I tried to explain the council's process a number of times. I generally support my colleagues in proposing new ideas. I have voted no on final policies, or worked to change them based on my constituents feedback and engagement.
And even if they did, as CM Ellison said, the question about governance shouldn't apply to this mayor, chief and council. It is a question of how we create systemic change that gives the people of Minneapolis, particularly those most affected by police violence, more voice.
I'm disappointed by any frame that makes this about Council vs Mayor -- this is about giving the *people of Minneapolis* more voice. I don't really think my constituents would feel that me having beepy card access to the mayor's office creates more transparency on policing policy
Many Mpls CMs want to give you the right to vote on more policy authority over policing - giving our constituents more voice in a transparent process of policy-making that every other city department has.

Transit riders should get involved in elections that matter: County Commissioner (control the half cent sales tax for transit) and Governor (appoint the metropolitan council chair and commissioners who oversee transit) and legislature (major source / lack of funding for transit).
I'm grateful for all @MetroTransitMN is doing to plan for these kinds of improvements, now they need the capital and operating funds to implement improvements!
It is past time for better investment in local bus service. These routes should have more amenities, pre-paid boarding, higher capacity buses and prioritization like signal timing and dedicated lanes. https://t.co/pNtBVVEEWm

This would most likely be a charter amendment put on the ballot for Minneapolis voters to decide. I think this is a reasonable discussion to have given our constituents expectations that CMs do more. I also know there will be pros and cons and many perspectives. I welcome that.
Currently the MPD and civil right departments in minneapolis report to the mayor, limiting direct council control over policy. CM Gordon floated an idea today, discussed in the past as well, to move these departments under the council in alignment with other city departments.
I am so grateful to the people who came to speak today and to the community members who have the wherewithal to keep coming back to demand change year after year. We need to do more, faster.

So frustrating to see smart investments in our transportation system left behind because of party politics. Businesses support transit investments because they know they are critical to the success of our region and state's economy. https://t.co/P5TSqKvisZ

CMs Andrew Johnson and Kevin Reich brought a staff direction asking for more specific recommendations by September, which will give us time to make sure we have any needed resources in the budget on immediate changes and then come back in the spring with longer term next steps.
For sidewalk clearance, we rely on property owners to clear sidewalks within 24 hours. If the city tried to take this on it would likely take days to clear them. Staff is likely to bring us recs for inspections on the priority pedestrian network, instead of relying on complaints.
For the bikeway network, we have the equipment we need and a manageable number of street miles -- staff thinks we can adopt an update priority plowing network and improve plowing next winter, potentially with some additional resources needed.
Lots of discussion today in our transportation committee about clearing sidewalks and bikeways in the winter. We all hear so many complaints about this in the winter and the council is making it clear we strongly support better snow clearance.

Truth. https://t.co/lcxtO9FTTg
The federal min wage for tipped workers is $2.13. Seven states have one fair min wage (no lower wage for tipped workers) and those states have both higher rates of tipping and half the rates of sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, based on ROC research.
Nationally there is increased focus on tipped workers‚Äô wages as the #metoo movement builds momentum. More cities and states are interested in moving to one fair wage without exemptions for tipped workers.

@mspbjHalter @dbrauer Yep we were all briefed generally by CPED staff - I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the details, how the land uses are described, etc
@dbrauer I literally have not seen a draft
7) Correcting centuries of exclusion and discrimination is no easy task. I'm proud of our city for working to tackle this head on. There will be many opinions and many important discussions in the months ahead. I hope people will keep the minds (and hearts) open to the goals.
6) Many Minneapolis neighborhoods (including mine) have historically had a mix of housing types and sizes. We also know our city has a history of explicit exclusion in housing based on race. You can find out more here: https://t.co/m42Jf7lFxU
5) I strongly support adding more housing options in Minneapolis neighborhoods. We have a housing shortage, with a very low rental vacancy rate. Over 50% of residents are renters. Over 40% of people live alone.
4) any proposal, including one to allow more diversity in housing types in all neighborhoods, would still be subject to zoning controls. So, a comp plan that allows for 2 unit or 4 unit buildings, for example, would still have zoning that controls how large buildings can be.
3) The comprehensive plan is an important document and is the legal guidance for land use in the city. It is not a zoning code -- that is separate -- and would need to be updated after the comp plan is adopted for changes to take effect.
2) staff's draft will be based on a couple of years worth of community engagement including over 50 community meetings and thousands of comments. You can find out details about what has happened so far, how to get involved or you can leave more comments at https://t.co/Gh8N0yOxRG
Some important details: 1) the draft plan will be released on March 22 and open for public comment for three months before staff submits a final draft plan for the "official" approval process, which will include at least one public hearing at the Planning Commission
Welp, one of my colleagues called the news before any of us have even seen a draft of our comp plan! But, I am thrilled that our staff are taking seriously our clear directive --all unanimously approved - to be bold in undoing racial exclusion in housing.		https://t.co/CqvgsV7kta

I could go on and on but my point is these policies are complicated and inter-related. It‚Äôs never going to be as simple as ‚Äúdo what NYC and Edina did‚Äù or ‚ÄúPortland‚Äôs policy vs Denver‚Äôs‚Äù
I favor stronger renter protections that make it harder to displace renters as part of the solution, and would probably support property tax or other incentives to keep units at their current prices. We‚Äôre exploring using an existing state program as a pilot.
I haven‚Äôt been a big fan of only relying on the trust fund to build new units particularly when they flipped to market rent after 15 years.
If we care more about stopping displacement and getting more units, Denver‚Äôs strategy of charging a fee and buying / preserving existing buildings makes sense.
If we want to make it overall pretty easy to develop housing, which is the direction we‚Äôve been going, and want to prioritize getting affordable units in strong market nhoods, Portland‚Äôs approach makes sense.
For a lot of reasons, I don‚Äôt think that makes sense for mpls: volume of projects, concern about supply, politics of development.
Like sometimes people will say ‚Äúcheck out Edina‚Äôs inclusionary zoning policy,‚Äù which I have, of course. That approach makes it basically impossible to develop new housing w/o special permission and a negotiation w the city.
Might sound obvious / too slow / govt whatever but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve even really defined or agreed on our goals. Comp plan should be a tool for this.
@misfireInside We‚Äôve been considering this for as long as I‚Äôve been on the council - probably time to just add our bike blvds to the snow emergency route network

I'm proud to be your DFL endorsed candidate for the second time, and I look forward to another term representing you on the city council!
I believe housing is a human right. I believe racial justice should be centered in everything we do.I believe everyone deserves to feel safe
I love the fact that there are so many differences of opinion in our ward!
It's been an honor to serve you all for the past 4 years to make meaningful and impactful change in people's lives.
There's a lot of chatter about my fundraising. To be clear: 76% of the money I raise comes from contributions of $100 or less üíØ‚úÖ
We need to all come together to protect our most vulnerable residents! I'm working to make sure any one who wants to live here can afford to
The 10th Ward is 80% renter. I have been an advocate for our renters, especially the ones that are at the highest risk of displacement.
I am pushing for a new Housing Stability staffer who's sole job is to find these creative solutions. It is currently in the mayor's budget.
...which has started the work of finding creative and innovative solutions to our housing affordability issues.
A few months ago, I hosted a city Housing Stability study session which resulted in unanimous support for a housing staff direction...
Naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) is a relatively new program in our city and something I have championed.
Grassroots community engagement is needed, and we need to develop new models to center racial equity at our neighborhood level.
As a former LHENA board member, I know firsthand the needs of our neighborhood organizations.We need to work hard at diversifying membership
I've supported de-escalation procedures, body cams, group violence intervention, mental health co-responders &amp; domestic violence prevention.
I'm proud of the work I have done to bring more balance and compassion to public safety. I've stood up to Kroll, who endorsed David Schorn.
Our community is changing. Some people will continue to drive of course, but people are increasingly choosing other options, and thats okay!
If we are planning for cars alone, we are failing.
If we are to meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals, we need to reduce driving by 40%, meaning we need to design our streets for the future
We need to improve our streets for all users, especially the most vulnerable, which is why I authored our city's Complete Streets policy.
My number one priority when I think about our streets is safety. Number two is increasing transit options for everyone.
It is a dangerous proposition to suggest that we stop development &amp; immediately implement rent control. That is not working in other cities.
The development we are seeing is actually helping to offset property tax increases. I am happy to provide evidence of that fact.
I have made it easier to build smaller scale sized buildings that my constituents have asked for. I've also legalized granny flats.
Words and actions matter: calling the north side an urban plantation, marching with nazi signs..this stuff has NO PLACE in our community.
We passed a $800 million investment in our parks and streets and made sure to center racial equity in that work.
I've been a leader on racial equity on this city council. I've stood up to Kroll and the police federation to demand police accountability.
And let me say this: I am not afraid to stand up to special interests. They know that I am standing up for my constituents first.
I have governed with transparency, openness and fairness. I have built strong coalitions to get things done for 10th ward and mpls residents
I authored the paid sick time ordinance, the minimum wage ordinance, led on housing, led on police reform and community safety.
I'm so excited to be the first council member from the 10th ward to be re-elected in the last 20 years!
Hey everyone! couple minutes until the #10thWardForum begins!
I hope to find additional funds this year for Next Step hospital based violence intervention and for domestic violence prevention.
Proposed budget has funding for Group Violence Prevention that has helped 45 individuals leave gang or group violence -- I strongly support.
In this context new spending for mental health coresponders and community liaisons is important to support balanced approach.
We've added 25 officers so far this term plus many community service officers classes. Proposed budget has new spending for 3 officers.
Chief is making the case for mental health responders and other investments that serve needs &amp; allow beat officers to focus on their jobs
Chief is responding to question about adding more police.: says only adding more officers alone doesn't reduce crime.
I've appreciated Mayor Hodges' balanced approach in resourcing the department for mental health calls, adding diversity, training, body cams
MPD presenting their budget. I've pushed for investment in reform, violence prevention and safety beyond policing. https://t.co/bhUNwXIlUX

@WedgeLIVE I'm sorry I didn't make it! More stuff to prep for tomorrow.
Thanks to everyone who came to the make homes happen debate tonight! Apparently the real debate happened at my house and the children won. https://t.co/R83PZNrjl4
I represent folks who agree with me, and disagree with me. You are all my constituents, and I am committed to listening and taking feedback.
I know there are folks out there who don't support me, but I ask that we find ways to continue to work together when I am re-elected in Nov.
Currently, we do not have the political support on the city council to pass such a policy but that won't stop me from working to get it done
On inclusionary zoning:I fully support a mandatory, phased in over time inclusionary zoning policy which would require more affordable units
That vision takes real, collaborative leadership. And as your tenth ward council member, I've done that.
But I've done it, and I agree, we shouldn't concentrate all of our growth to just one or two places in our city.
There is a lot of coded language about renters, and about growth, and its hard sometimes to convince my colleagues to commit to growth.
I successfully downzoned part of our ward because it was what the neighborhood asked for.
As your council member, i have worked very hard to listen and be responsive to your concerns on historic preservation and housing.
On parking: structured parking is expensive.Requiring parking results in bigger, bulkier buildings with less options for 10th ward residents
What my opponents are saying is categorically false.
As a council member, the number of new units that have been improved in my ward is around 600. Previous council member? 1400.
When you remove rental licenses from property owners, its important to remember that the tenants are the ones who lose their homes.
I have worked hard to increase more "gentle density" like allowing for ADUs, and reforming restrictive parking requirements.
City council members are policy makers that set the vision of our city according to our constituents.
In order to replace any loss in federal funding, we need to find creative solutions from regional partners to fill in the void.
BTW, the vast majority of my donations are under $100, which are people who support raising wages and paid sick time. They have my ear.
And I support increasing those funds.
In my first year, I worked to restore funds that were cut that provided for resources for increasing POC homeownership.
We have the worst disparities in the country and it is embarrassing. We must all commit to centering racial equity in everything we do.
...current tenants, and 3) maintain habitability.
To preserve existing affordable housing stock, we must 1) give advanced notice of property sales, 2) offer the sale of the property to the..
And I recognize the fact that our undocumented neighbors are at increased risk for displacement. We need to protect them too!
...which makes it harder to for them to find housing.
We need to make it harder to evict people in our city. Half of all renters on the northside have an eviction charge on their record...
When I took office in 2013, I've been a leader for renters. Ward 10 is 80% renter, and our city is majority renter.
I recognize this is a complex issue, which is why I was a leader in our city's paid sick time law and minimum wage increase.
We cannot turn a blind eye towards our housing needs. It is irresponsible for any city official to ignore this issue.
I'm excited to run for reelection because we need more champions on the council to continue the progress we've made this far.
Yes pretty full house

Do you think no one notices when you beat up on female elected officials in breathtakingly differential treatment from male colleagues?

Do you know the difference between the planning commission, the zoning and planning committee and the city council?
Do you know we have land use laws, guided by a comprehensive plan with legal authority and a zoning code with detailed regulations?
Isn't it part of your job to provide an accurate context of a city that is growing and facing a housing shortage?
Where do you propose people live? Is it accurate to treat every new housing building as some kind of corrupt quid pro quo with no evidence?
Rents are rising in our city in part because we do not have enough homes for the people who want to live here. 52% of our city rents homes.
Dear Minneapolis press corps: our city has a 2% rental vacancy rate and our population is projected to grow from 419,952 to 459,000 by 2040

@jessesomething @paulthissen @ScottDibble The city has a climate action plan: https://t.co/eDHYw7QcAq
Mercado Central installed new efficient lighting equivalent of reducing carbon emissions from 121,503 passenger miles in a year
Taqueria La Hacienda installed a demand-controlled ventilation system equivalent of planting 500 trees
Allied Parking installed new lighting equivalent to saving almost 10,000 gallons of gasoline in terms of carbon emissions every year
Longfellow Market is reducing 63,000 lbs of carbon every year with the energy efficiency upgrades they made last year
Prospect Foundry changed to LED lighting and added automation to shut off lights when not in use. Energy use reduction was over 900,000 kWh.
This year, Elite Cleaners and Dinsmore Cleaners switched from PERC dry cleaning. We have only one remaining dry cleaner in mpls using PERC.
The city's Green Business cost share program provides matching funds to businesses to reduce pollution and energy use. https://t.co/YbEbUbroLQ

@lisadubbels Bumpouts are much more expensive, though the city has started doing some of the temporary ones with bollards.
@lisadubbels I completely agree. We have about $1mil total for protected bikeways each year. Blaisdell isn't happening this year, but will soon.
@lisadubbels in the short term these projects are planned for painted stripes and plastic bollards similar to the existing lanes on these streets.
@DthomasJournals @brsomogyi Ah got it. And yes this is true. Also any greater context of housing affordability, rental vacancy rates, mode share, climate change, etc.
@DthomasJournals @brsomogyi Not aiming at a story, no.

@dbrauer @natepentz @MayorHodges @JohnQuincyMPLS yes, true
@dbrauer @natepentz @MayorHodges @JohnQuincyMPLS yes our staff has been able to do that each year for levy proposals. They might have it now
@dbrauer @natepentz @MayorHodges @JohnQuincyMPLS otherwise depends on what is happening with property values in each part of the city
@dbrauer @natepentz @MayorHodges @JohnQuincyMPLS if the base keeps increasing thru new development it will help relieve existing prop owners

Don't put batteries in your recycling because it can cause a fire.
Don't put plastic bags, hoses, fabric in your recycling because it wraps around the sorters.

I had a great trip with two Salt Lake City CMs to the midtown farmers market via @lyft to swap ideas. http://t.co/tTPucb4FqT
@Dr_Eric I believe the oldest millennials are in their early 30s.
@Dr_Eric the mayor of SLC was asked what they did to encourage transit supportive zoning and he highlighted accessory dwelling units.
.@MerplesMN is a skyway apologist!! Something about touching other peoples elbows.
@laflaneuse @lwollsch "there is no bad weather only bad gear" keep repeating. Keep repeating.

Should we tear down our skyways? @StreetsMN debate at #railvolution. @Jacob_Frey no big deal right?

More talk of attracting millennials this morning at #railvolution. Not too many in the room, wonder how many young ppl are speaking.
@HyattConcierge @katielynroth we all locked our bikes to the fence railing.
@owenam obviously you're all going to grow older and start driving everywhere. ;)
@Dr_Eric @Move_MN there's not even enough gas tax money to repair the road system, which is hitting a massive 50 year maintenance backlog.
Salt Lake mayor highlights ADUs zoning change to support transit. Opponents watered down his policy. Working hard to build support for ours.
LA, Dallas, Salt Lake -- common theme is regional or local sales tax for transit. We're next. @Move_MN #railvolution
So much hand wringing about how to figure out what millennials want whenever electeds get together. I say just ask them! Waddya say kids?
What can govt do to support TOD? Stop making TOD illegal, stop requiring suburban development next to transit stations. #railvolution
Salt Lake City - 140 miles of rail in 15 years. Still building, now streetcar extensions.
How did Glendale, Arizona build put such a successful transit system? A regional sales tax! @Move_MN @RailVolution

#5: Give people a place to sit down! (2nd and Marquette gets a vote from me. Where else?)
#4: give people a safe, pleasant place to walk. (Great cities draw you in and invite people to wander).
#3: give people something to do. Like a bread oven!

@YPM_Minnesota thank you for your endorsement today! So excited to keep engaging young progressives in this election and beyond.
About 70% of ward 10's population is renters. Hope to better engage all residents in decisions like this.
The meeting ended up as a discussion mostly about concerns about density in general, not proposed change. 1 condo owner spoke. No renters.
CM tuthill expressed concern about lack of guest parking in for home care nurses and other guests. Mtg has lost track of proposed change.
Lots of single family home owners have expressed concern about adding more people to neighborhoods and parking impacts.
Currently a sample building could have 50 two bedroom units but not 100 one bedroom units.
The change does not reduce minimum sq ft of units, building height or bulk, setbacks or parking requirements.
