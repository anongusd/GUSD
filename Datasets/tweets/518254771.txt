Everybody wants to play this as a two sides speaking passed each other. The ones who control the purse strings said no. Trump said, ‘come on.’ They said no. And he closed down the government. That's what happened. He can reopen it tomorrow... It’s all on him, isn’t it?” https://t.co/6GLbX5KSwh
“[Trump] ran in the midterms, &amp; campaigned for people... on ‘you have to vote for GOP because the Dems aren't going to give us a wall.’ Dems ran in the midterm elections saying, ‘we're not giving him a wall.’ They won 40 seats plus in the House and they're not giving him a wall..

That's one thing. This news today is very different. This news is about how Trump directed his attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about Russia, and whatever else one may think about lying to the public or whatever...
CNN: @neal_katyal: “There’s two different things that we are talking about here. One is that video tape you just played with trump — that's about trump can continue his businesses in Russia and lie to the public before the election saying I have no dealings in Russia when he did. https://t.co/xiX2gScGHd
We’ll have to wait and see what that is &amp; if it implicates the president even more than this report.”
What will be key here is to try to bring the receipts — the article talks about text messages or e-mails, what are those? Is that Michael Cohen saying, ‘hey the boss told me to do X, Y, and Z,’ a lot of that will be hearsay.
CNN: @joshscampbell: “This is a crime, if this reporting pans out to be the case. I have no reason to doubt this. This is from @JasonLeopold, who is one of the best  in the business when it comes to this beat. If you are directing someone to lie to Congress, that’s a crime. https://t.co/BumeBqLYNm

@KirstenPowers @KSoltisAnderson Thank you! Posting correcting version
Right now, neither side is feeling *political* pain. There's pain by the federal workers who aren't getting paid... by people who need federal assistance in some way, but aren't getting it, b/c of the shutdown. But political pain? Fed workers are not a pressure point for [Trump]”
It doesn't matter what's in the actual bill. Democrats will say they didn't give him wall money; Trump will say he did get wall money. That's how this ends. The question is how fast do we get to that point? We'll get to that point when one side feels some sort of political pain..
CNN: @KSoltisAnderson: “Spoiler alert here—this is how it ends: something gets passed at some point. Pelosi &amp; Schumer come out, give a press conference that says, ‘we have reopened the government &amp; haven't given him his wall’... then Trump signs it &amp; says, ‘they gave me my wall!’ https://t.co/LisUaELJqt
