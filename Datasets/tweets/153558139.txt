It's time to address our nation's high Black maternal mortality rate, which is perpetuated by centuries-old systems of oppression. We are thankful for our partners whose mission it is to advance maternal health and justice. #WomensHistoryMonth
It's time to reject policies and rhetoric that pushes #abortion care out of reach. Because abortion care is health care. 		We stand with women of color who have worked for #reprojustice since the movement began so all people can access the care we need. #WomensHistoryMonth
It's time to build on the work of women who have come before us so that every worker can access #paidleave and #paidsickdays, and work free from violence and harassment. It's time to make the #wagegap history to achieve #fairpay for all. #WomensHistoryMonth
And we also know that the changemakers of today are pushing our movements forward. From health care and reproductive rights to fair pay and family friendly policies, we know when women do better, families do better and our nation prospers. #WomensHistoryMonth

R8: Es obvio que los votantes apoyan compartir el costo entre empleadores y empleados, algo que es m√°s popular entre los republicanos que entre los dem√≥cratas e independientes. *As√≠ es como el #FAMILYAct financiar√≠a un plan nacional.* #WellnessWed https://t.co/lTnEO5B5AK
R8: Tampoco se trata de pol√≠tica. La mayor√≠a de los votantes de ambos partidos opinan que los trabajadores merecen #paidleave para cuidar a sus hijos, recuperarse de una enfermedad/lesi√≥n, cuidar de alguien y por responsabilidades derivadas con las fuerzas armadas. #WellnessWed https://t.co/OZj3mio9xt
R8: La gente *quiere* #paidleave. Quieren que los legisladores hagan el cambio, pero no quieren cualquier plan. Solo 3% de los votantes apoyan financiar los permisos pagados a trav√©s de fondos provenientes del Seguro Social.  #WellnessWed https://t.co/60YGzXbdrK
R8: El #FAMILYAct beneficiar√≠a quienes califican para SSDI, incluyendo trabajadores a medio tiempo y de bajos recursos, incluso si el tama√±o de la empresa o su relaci√≥n con su empleador actual hacen que no califiquen para las protecciones de FMLA. #WellnessWed
El #FamilyAct crear√≠a un fondo de #paidleave asequible y autosuficiente que proveer√° a los trabajadores parte de su salario hasta por 60 d√≠as o 12 semanas laborales al a√±o. #WellnessWed https://t.co/mDTRn1dSTR https://t.co/yeNEztl1jm
A8: Voters clearly support sharing the cost of #paidleave between employers and employees, which is even more popular among Republicans than Democrats and Independents. *This is exactly how the #FAMILYAct would fund a national plan.* #WellnessWed https://t.co/IBVV7QVzbu
A8: It‚Äôs not a partisan thing, either. Voters across party lines overwhelmingly believe workers deserve #paidleave to care for new children, recover from illness or injury, address #caregiving responsibilities and for reasons related to military service. #WellnessWed https://t.co/GJDlFBRX1J
A8: And people *want* #paidleave. They're looking to lawmakers for a change, and not just any plan will do. A mere 3% of voters support funding paid leave by allowing leave-takers to draw from Social Security. #WellnessWed https://t.co/aORePRaaHV
A8: #FAMILYAct benefits would be available to everyone who qualifies for SSDI, including part-time and lower-wage workers, even if their employer‚Äôs size or their attachment to their current employer makes them ineligible for the protections offered through the FMLA. #WellnessWed
The #FAMILYAct would create an affordable and self-sustaining national #paidleave fund to provide workers with a portion of their wages for up to 60 workdays, or 12 weeks in a year. #WellnessWed https://t.co/mDTRn1dSTR https://t.co/XBihzMkzAB

A2: We don‚Äôt live single issue lives, so our health and job needs can‚Äôt be separated. The United States lacks a paid family and medical leave policy, which means women, who bear the brunt of caregiving responsibilities, are often pushed out of the workforce. #WellnessWed https://t.co/bgGAjEf7vq

#BadMedicine laws are part of a dangerous trend of state lawmakers prioritizing politics over women‚Äôs health care and create significant burdens on women‚Äôs access to #abortion care ‚Äî and are the most harmful for low-income women, women of color, rural women and young people.
These restrictions punish women ‚Äî particularly women of color and women with low incomes who face multiple disparities and structural barriers that increase their likelihood of experiencing the harm caused by obstacles to #abortion care. #BadMedicine
And Oklahoma is a key offender of #BadMedicine laws, w/ #abortion restrictions that bear no relationship to medical standards, impede health care providers' efforts to provide high quality, patient-centered care, and take decision-making away from women. https://t.co/Ru8jQT70pP

When women decide to grow their families, they may face a number of barriers that threaten financial stability during and after pregnancy, like no paid sick days, no paid leave, unaffordable health care, no pregnancy accommodations and the #wagegap. #ProtectOurCare
These are just a few examples of how women of color are impacted:	üß±Abortion coverage bans that expand on the Hyde Amendment	üß±Racial discrimination in the health care system	üß±The #wagegap	üß±A lack of #paidsickdays
In many cases, harmful U.S. policies, or the lack of supportive ones, related to pregnancy and parenting disproportionately harm women of color. There are multiple reasons for this, including our nation‚Äôs long history of racism.
Restrictive federal and state laws make it difficult or impossible for a person to access #abortion care. These are just a few of the types of restrictions:	üõëBans on insurance coverage for abortion	üõëTRAP laws	üõëMandatory delays	üõëUltrasound requirements	#BeBOLDEndHyde
For many of us, this means financial security, health, happiness, respect, equality and access to opportunities to improve our lives. But right now, current policies, or a lack thereof, actually make it harder to achieve these goals.

6. Everyone should have access to affordable, comprehensive insurance coverage and health care. #ProtectOurCare. Expand #Medicaid. Remove the barriers to health coverage that immigrants face. #BeBoldEndHyde now. Prohibit #STLDI plans. Ensure access to copay-free birth control.
5. Every woman should have the tools to decide whether and when to become a parent or grow her family, free from shame or stigma. Policymakers must ensure #abortion coverage for women enrolled in #Medicaid, combat abortion restrictions, ensure access to contraception and more. https://t.co/H3zPTc488c
4. Our nation‚Äôs caregivers should have support to meet their responsibilities at work and at home. And women should not face discrimination or be financially penalized for being family caregivers.
3. All working people should be able to take paid time away from their jobs to care for themselves and their families. #Paidleave and #paidsickdays are essential for millions of workers and caregivers. https://t.co/GgDJeVCUV3
2. People should be able to work free from wage and employment discrimination.

1. All women and families should be able to live in a safe and healthy environment. Lawmakers must address policies that disproportionately criminalize people of color, support strong environmental regulations, end gender-based violence, enact gun safety legislation and more.
When policies put women and families first, we take steps toward a stronger future for all of us. We set 7 goals to address the significant challenges women face that undermine their financial stability, equality, dignity and agency.

If the wage gap were closed, a Native woman would have enough money for: üè°24 months of rent. 	üíñ20 years of birth control. 	‚öïÔ∏è18 months of health insurance premiums.	üçé170 weeks of food. #NativeWomensEqualPay
Reality check: The wage gap cannot be explained away by choices and is especially harmful to women of color. Closing the wage gap is integral to improving the health, well-being and economic security of women and families. #NativeWomensEqualPay #DemandMore https://t.co/ArcVWNSElP
These things do not cause the wage gap: industry, education level, job choice. 		These things do: discrimination and bias. #NativeWomensEqualPay https://t.co/ArcVWNSElP
So much is at stake if we don't #StopKavanaugh. There must be an FBI investigation and the committee should not move forward with a vote tomorrow. https://t.co/WrkYvD9Dju https://t.co/40WgvESNSa
If the wage gap closed, a Native woman would have enough money for approximately more than 1.5 years of tuition and fees for a four-year public university or the full cost of tuition for a two-year community college. #NativeWomensEqualPay #DemandMore https://t.co/vTxu7Bdxes
Without fair pay, it‚Äôs harder for a Native woman to access reproductive health care when deciding if/when/how to start a family and keep herself healthy. #NativeWomensEqualPay #DemandMore

Today is #NativeWomensEqualPay Day. That means a Native woman has to work nearly 22 months to get paid as much as a white man was paid in 12. 22 MONTHS.		IT'S 2018, PEOPLE.

A9. Simply, he would be appointed to the Supreme Court for life. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/WlZNDGaLub
A8. Health care for over 130 million people with pre-existing conditions is at risk, incuding 67 million women and girls. Kavanaugh would gut protections so insurance companies could deny care and charge working families more. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/RiO8HQ7egW
A7. Per his record, Kavanaugh has ruled against birth control coverage for employees, workers battling employment discrimination and workers‚Äô rights to join a union, to name a few. We can expect more of the same. #StopKavanaugh. https://t.co/y13OJWF73T
A6. All we need to do is look at his record. Kavanaugh has sided AGAINST:	‚û°Ô∏è birth control coverage for employees	‚û°Ô∏è workers battling employment discrimination	‚û°Ô∏è working people‚Äôs rights to join a union		Fighting for working women &amp; families means fighting to #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/V8W0qQSFOh
