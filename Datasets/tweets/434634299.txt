@EdwardHBOh I didn't see the piece you're referring to. I pulled this from a State Dept doc. The way I have come to view the summits is that Trump views them as necessary to keep the conversation going. But they are a concession. Seems like he is growing impatient w/ the results though.
So this repeated complaint that the US team was poorly prepared going into this because they didn't have expectations dialed correctly isn't really accurate. They knew going into this there was an impossible gap between the two countries.
A sr State Dept official says the North Koreans first surfaced the request of billions of $ worth of sanctions relief "during the working-level negotiations in the week leading up to the summit, and we evaluated it closely and explained to them that that wouldn’t work."

@ianmcc95 @ajmount @seanmdav Whispers: I do know that

I'm fine with an outcome of nothing. Relieved, even. Better than the US lowering objectives or relieving sanctions. Kim has total control over what his country does and if he's willing to take steps towards dismantlement he could do it. He has not and shows no signs he will.
People across the globe are not all motivated by the same things and they do not "share values"; the reason we have hostilities w/ some countries is not due to "misunderstandings" that can be solved by getting to know each other a little better.
@smarmyEOD Did you see my fox segment just a bit ago?
@ben_woods15 I'm leaning toward really think there will be nothing but a generic commitment again. As I said previously: A bad deal w/ DPRK could have catastrophic consequences
No deal is better than a bad deal. And the guy willing to walk is the guy w/ a much stronger negotiating position. 		These are things Trump has said. We'll see this tested to the max here.
@smarmyEOD That's the risk. Trump conceded this- and it IS a concession- for Kim to give something back. No testing is fine but deeeefinitely not enough. Q is-- when Trump realizes Kim is angling to have his nuclear program accepted, what will he do? It's been hinted to me it won't be good.
There is enormous pressure on Trump to get something. Too much. It is MUCH better to walk away if Kim is playing games. I'd take another generic commitment to "denuclearize" over giving NK sanctions relief for partial and reversible dismantlement of a some facility.

@luke_j_obrien And everyone doing their part doesn't mean drafted. This is why, as a huge advocate of women being provided equal opportunity and looking for ways to better amplify women's voices, I do not consider myself a modern feminist. Because it leads us to silly things like this.

@luke_j_obrien Not combat. That's insane. And no sane parent will stand for it. A country as large as ours has many strong, able men for war. If women WANT to join, that's great. But women in their prime--- child bearing prime--- should never be compelled to war.

@ChiSportsHomer If you take your argument to its logical conclusion, you're arguing that all countries should be permitted to have nukes and that it wld be more stable if we do. It is horrifically dangerous and the odds of nuclear employment go way up.
@ChiSportsHomer And what I'm saying is- for the countries that do not have them, and for the nascent nuclear powers- it's still in our interests and in our power (if we're smart) to prevent proliferation.
@ChiSportsHomer Id say the lesson for those not wanting to get bombed by the US is to not invade other nations and not be brutal regime that threatens the US and our allies while pursuing WMDs.

@ChiSportsHomer I'm 100% not arguing for a coup. Im still arguing for a real pressure campaign, maintaining the requirement that DPRK dismantle its program, and keeping diplomatic channels open in the meantime if we can.
Nuclear weapons are used even when they're not delivered. This is why the argument "but they won't be stupid enough to launch a nuke at the US" doesn't fly w/ the DPRK scenerio. Simply by having a credible nuclear ICBM, the Kim regime can (and does) coerce and blackmail the US.

@noonanjo And the biggest advocates for arms control will be the ones to amplify his nonsense.
Russia isn't interested in complying w/ INF. It has been testing missiles that violate the treaty for years and is now deploying them. If the US stays in the treaty we are the only ones constrained. Treaties have to be enforced or they are worse than meaningless, they're harmful.
@horsevtnek @noonanjo @RadioFreeTom @emptywheel @EliLake @joshtpm @sbplama That point has been muted because of the Obama admin making the cheating public (albeit a bit late in the game IMO), the Trump admin repeatedly calling on them to comply and initiating bilateral meetings to try to resolve the issues in good faith, and the NATO position/statement.
This isn't true, thankfully. But it's what Russia wish had happened. The US consulted regularly w/ our allies and maintained NATO unity. Something both parties should appreciate. https://t.co/hJHoX7aILq

@RadioFreeTom @noonanjo @EliLake @joshtpm @sbplama Of course China wouldn't. That's *my* point. Why should we remain party to a treaty that has the effect of only constraining us while our adversaries build and deploy them? Are you arguing we stay constrained by it while the Russians cheat? For how long?

Oped on Sen Sanders' page. "These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, #Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger." 		https://t.co/wrMNCc0yTM

It's so silly. Of course walls work which is precisely *why* those who object to a wall are so emotional about it. It's why the entire immigration debate pivots on the wall issue even though it's only one component of border security.
@GrayConnolly What do you make of it?
As far as foreign policy positions go, supporting Maduro or at least remaining agnostic about it would be pretty low-hanging fruit if Trump wanted to help Russia. The fact that Trump hasn't should be more meaningful for the "Trump is a Russian-agent" conspiracy theorists.
If Trump was truly worried about not upsetting Putin wouldn't he support Maduro?
Nearly 3 million Venezuelans have fled since 2014. It's a massive forced displacement. Nearly 300,000 have settled in the US, which as a proportion of those fleeing isn't huge. But we've just gotten started as Venezuela continues its downward spiral.

Socialism is edgy and cool in the same way soldiers guarding bakeries to prevent ppl from murdering their neighbors to get bread to feed their children is edgy and cool
Do not cede a single inch to US officials when they insist that what has happened to Venezuela was not caused by socialism. Venezuela is a cautionary tale. Be wary of those who do not recognize it as such.
Venezuela went from rich to Venezuelans-are-picking-through-the-garbage-for-food in less than two decades.

It is not "directed toward" Russia. It is an alliance of independent nation states with shared commitments to the principle of national sovereignty. It is a political and military alliance. If Russia wasn't a revanchist power it wld have no beef w/ NATO. https://t.co/sNlSiukQCN

If Donald Trump is an agent for the Russians, the Russians should go ahead and show us what they've got on him, because it isn't working.
@DavidAFrench Also, recall Trump was caught bragging about wiping out the Assad-backed Russian fighters who wouldn't stand down. Trump's advisors warned him not to discuss it publicly. Mattis had a great line when pressed about how we "annihilated them." Trump had no beef w/ that admission.
@DavidAFrench I'm less worried about Syria because of Russia and more worried about it because of Iran, because ISIS still exists there, and the vulnerability of the Kurds vs Turks. The real danger of Russia exists in Eastern/Central Europe and Trump's been *much* better in that regard.
@DavidAFrench We have a national defense strategy that orients us toward deterring and if need be, defeating, Russia (and China). I agree w/ you that precipitous withdrawal from Syria is a mistake. But that doesn't mean we still aren't much better off now re Russia than during previous admin.

@HotlineJosh https://t.co/iPH8u3M4G3
@HotlineJosh Like I said, it's a bad decision. 	It's just not "isolationist."
@HotlineJosh And as I said- Paul is influential on Syria, no doubt. But overall, the Rand Paul crowd would not have bombed Assad after CWs or be withdrawing from treaties and agreements. The Paul/isolationist crowd supported keeping the Iran deal, remember.
@HotlineJosh I think the most useful thing our 2,000 troops should be doing is finishing off ISIS and ensuring our partners there are protected before leaving. It would've taken a lot more troops to push Russia and Iran out. (Which is why Mattis insisted on refusing that mission creep)
@HotlineJosh Against* being dependent on arms control, that is
@HotlineJosh I think Trump's impulses are more Bolton (i.e. against "democracy promotion" and dependent on arms control, happy to use force when necessary and leave, etc) and less Rand Paul. But I also agree w/ Rogin's reporting that Paul has been influential on draining patience re Syria.
@HotlineJosh Suddenly withdrawing is a mistake that will lead to varying degrees of disaster depending on which country we're talking about. I just don't think the desire and attempt to set up a "as good as we can get it, let's go" situation is "isolationist"
@HotlineJosh No. Not non interventionist either. He seems happy to bomb ISIS and Assad in response to CW use, for example. It's the staying long term and doing the stability operations part that he and frankly most Americans have a problem with.
@HotlineJosh I don't think it's really fair to call wanting to disentangle from the ME necessarily "isolationist"

@jac5264 @amanda_m_macias We do not have something to defend against this.

If we want our allies and partners to carry more of the burden, and to be good allies, we have to be a trust-worthy ally, too. (Good interview w/ @PeteHegseth on @foxandfriends this morning on the decision to immediately withdraw from #Syria) @HudsonInstitute https://t.co/OUcLfAXmVB
@kickstart0225 I don't want to be there forever or even for much longer. But I do want to make sure we set up our allies/partners to do the best possible and that we don't betray our partners who will be left to contend with these monsters once we leave.
@CrackaJackin I respect the Senator but we still have tens of thousands of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria.
@EdMill66 I don't think we need a US ground invasion in Syria. I'm with you on that. We have 2,000 there now providing support and our partners are doing far more of the fighting. We are training, advising, and leading coalition airstrikes.
@oKentucky Also think it's wise for the president to seek an authorization from Congress.
@RichardCrahal I understand what youre saying. But we are playing a supporting role in Syria and partners are doing the bulk of the fighting and bleeding. ISIS is our shared enemy and it's better to kill those guys there before they travel here.
@west_prime Very much agree we can't stay there forever. But we can make sure we don't leave in such a way that invites a collapse of gains and a betrayal of allies. Allies and partners should be in the loop and know what happening and when.

The president is right that he has given more resources to his military and has given them greater authority to do what is necessary to kill ISIS abroad. But ISIS isn't defeated; it's degraded. He is taking on significant risk if he no longer wants to take the fight to them.
I think there's room for a drawdown in Afghanistan. I do not think there's room to drawdown a single troop in Syria yet.

@EdwardHBOh I think most Americans have no idea who the Kurds are or what we're doing in Syria because neither the last nor current president made a case before the American ppl about what we're even doing in Syria.
Americans should care about the fate of the Kurds, who stepped up to work w/ us, trusted us, courageously fought ISIS, and who we're supposedly hoping will continue the fight. That's not globalist, internationalist, squish, necon, warmonger, whatever. It's right and it's smart.

The name calling (neocons and warmongers) on this issue is really a shame. Many of us share the same desire to get out as soon as we can. But ppl like me want to do it responsibly. Allowing the Kurds to be wiped out wld be an unbelievable tragedy and strategic failure. https://t.co/ub5zVH8Cdx
@tome708 Only POTUS can decide to be weak and allies and adversaries will know the difference.
Right, but we should be honest about the risks the president just accepted when opting for withdrawal. My boiled down take is there are major risks to the US and our allies. But the American ppl never bought into the mission in Syria. POTUS either needed to make his case or leave https://t.co/1VQIDnL0Tt
@JJCarafano @GrecianFormula of course I agree it was never the mission and it's unrealistic. Seems to me what IS realistic and what IS part of the stated objective of the US is to push back Iranian militarization through Syria as it seeks to establish land bridge to carry out attacks
In other words, North Korea is playing the same game it's always played. https://t.co/nux1ZrplMR
@DavidLarter Youre giving him too much credit
Russia consistently violates arms control treaties. 	Russian officials threaten to attack US defensive systems in ally counties.	Russia attacks a US ally at sea. 	Russia's doctrine of escalate to deescalate in a purely conventional conflict increases likelihood of nuclear use. https://t.co/J4EirFZxQx
@wtjahn @JordanSchachtel Typically neocons are thought to want to force democracy onto countries and are eager for regime change where there is already a stable if illiberal govt. I'm not advocating for either.

@KurtSchlichter @JordanSchachtel Right answer.
Abandoning the Kurds now is unthinkable. The president has been right to highlight the need for allies and partners to act like it-- the Kurds have; we're about to show what that buys you.
@DavidLarter There's a better argument for withdrawing from there than there is Syria in its current state, imo
@seitzpf We should be realistic about what we can provide the Kurds. There's a difference between being a good ally and providing them their own state at the cost of American blood and treasure.
Important. But let's see what the actual mission looks like once the Pentagon has advised the president and he makes the final call. Might be a revised version of current ops. https://t.co/C4dX46PW0t
What I appreciate about this is it grapples w/ the reality of Trump's promise and the will of the American ppl to get out asap while also not being intentionally head-in-sand about what will happen if we don't deal w/ Iran. https://t.co/hhERsXTXW7
Yep https://t.co/kI2EmaZueJ
Trump should've gotten an AUMF- and set out a clear, limited objective in Syria. The Pentagon knew it couldn't get it, which is why it avoided it. Reupping my @thehill piece on that from last year. https://t.co/RWNVyKz16I
@CliffordDMay But we need a plan or our gains will be *immediately* lost.
@CliffordDMay Basically anything written by anyone who studies the region. As you say, I don't see how we go from the current situation to a better one if we withdraw now. I'm anxious to draw down in the ME, and to see stable even if illiberal regimes in place instead of chaos and bloodbath.
We cannot stay in Syria permanently- and the sooner we leave the better. But if you think that means immediate withdrawal w/out concern for the strategic implications in Syria and the larger region, humbly suggest you read more on the subject before commenting.

@joelmmathis Mark's point, and my point as well, is that it isn't as "this is terrible let's stop backing the Saudis." If we don't help the Saudis, and Iran gains a proxy state in Yemen- what will that impact? It will be bad. Very bad.

@enlightnup What do you mean?
Must be maddening to be part of the comms team over there because all we're talking about is Cohen and the like. It's a shame.
The USG is working to stop China from predatory lending, IP theft, provocative behavior in international waters, illicit trade that enables rogue actors, and to close gaps in our military capabilities that China has been exploiting for years. Owed to Trump and his natsec team.
Our nuclear posture made serious and positive corrections to take deterrence vs great powers much more seriously. Funding it will be near impossible now w/ Dems at the helm in the House, but it asserted strong US leadership. Trump, as POTUS, enabled this. Did this get attention?
The POTUS shld get credit for bringing NATO together to issue a strong statement against Russia for its ongoing violations of a major Cold War treaty. Obama couldn't do it. Trump did. Who even knows about it save a group of wonks and the Poles and Romanians, etc who care a LOT?

@conservmillen @MarkGrote @benshapiro @johnmacarthur Anyone who believes their faith is True, objectively, is necessarily saying those who disagree are wrong. That's not an attack, even if folks choose to be offended.
@jaynordlinger America played a gigantic role in that, including by dropping the bomb- twice. It's one of those things that was necessary but it took unfortunate means (of which the Japanese are to blame) to get there
Judgment, clear thinking, the ability to remain cool under pressure, to speak and act in a way that moves the ball down the field, etc. We do our best to look at bios to deduce if a person will be good at those things but they're only tools.

@MTMehan @davereaboi @MZHemingway Put more simply- justice is the goal. We should reject the binary choice of realism or moralism. That's not what a more restrained, just American foreign policy demands.
@MTMehan @davereaboi @MZHemingway It's all about national sovereignty; the ability of the US to act in the world on its own terms rather than reacting and being coerced by our enemies. Sometimes we can exact a win for democracy, generally. It's just that it should never come at the expense of American justice.

Allowing Iran to enrich was a green light to nations considering going for it. Because why not? The message was: wear the US down just enough and we'll not only let you keep your nuclear program, we'll even send you cash you can use to fund terrorism https://t.co/SkNAjIBjQL

That decision directly affected the stability of the entire region. It enriched Iran so that it could fund Assad's bloodbath in Syria, destabilize the nascent Iraqi govt of which Americans died for, and allowed it to fund the Yemen war, which threatens the global energy market
I find it very interesting that many of the president's critics re Saudi Arabia thought it was wise policy to lift sanctions on the world's leading sponsor of terrorism while it still kept a budding nuclear program in place (and deceived us about how mature the program was/is) https://t.co/MBTamKhLQb

@GayPatriot I am in favor of very public shaming as part of "pressure campaigns" or whatever the USG wants to call them. And we should be as specific as we can be down to the names of political prisoners/victims. (i.e. Magnitsky)
@GayPatriot Fair enough. But they do take offense to being called out for abuses. And the US really hasn't done so- at least that I can recall- in any real high profile way in recent years. I certainly don't recall Obama or Bush highlighting China's horrendous abuses. Happy to be corrected.
But it's not going to lecture countries publicly when it's trying to work with them. Privately? I hear this it does so constantly. But not publicly.
Careful observers will note that the Trump admin calls out human rights violations when it's trying to exact an outcome in FP. The president did it in the SOTU vs DPRK at the height of "fire and fury". It does so re Iran, too. It should vs China and Russia. https://t.co/soS0sRTtCM

@AlexWardVox @NarangVipin I know the admin is trying hard to get a diplomatic solution with DPRK. And no, I don't think the president is primarily or even mostly motivated out of a desire to avoid looking weak.
@AlexWardVox @NarangVipin Presidents being unwilling to confirm intel while they pursue diplomacy is not unusual.
@AlexWardVox @NarangVipin You editorialized. You said it was so he "didn't look weak." And the president has said the NYT piece was wrong in that the North has been deceiving us. Our Intel is better than what's been reported and the USG is well aware of what they're doing.
@AlexWardVox @NarangVipin It's obviously written as such. And you've pitched the piece as "scary" for that reason.
@AlexWardVox @NarangVipin And the last paragraph is of course totally unfair. Another reason presidents--- all of them--- often do not acknowledge/confirm reporting is to keep their options open. It's not "so they don't look weak."

@DavidSantoro1 I'm saying exactly what you're saying. Except I'm saying it's what is *supposed* to be the case. It's bad when what are supposed to be non political analysts DO push their policy preferences by leaking to the media

@DavidLarter I agree that ppl shouldn't be lying. Whether it's the gov or the media. But we have to sort it out civilly. Acosta seems to me to be contributing to the problem, not helping it

@DavidLarter If the president asked me what he should do, I'd recommend he give Acosta one more chance to abide by the established rules. The POTUS gets to call on reporters. If Acosta won't abide by the rules, he's gone. CNN can replace him w/ someone else
@DavidLarter And I don't think it's helpful to make Acosta a press martyr, either. But the guy is cleeeeeeearly abusing his privilege. The press pass is a privilege. And he's not doing other reporters any favors by filibustering and acting the way he does

@JerryDunleavy Now that I'm on this kick... I like to let ppl know that they're welcome to volunteer their time at their local refugee assistance center if they want to help. We are so generous and have so many here, and private charities are often running the assistance/ assimilation programs
@JerryDunleavy I know. Annoying. This issue irritates me. Ppl often have no idea what they're talking about when they complain about US refugees policy
@JerryDunleavy For all the flak the Trump admin received for not allowing in Syrian refugees- it's worth noting the US is the world’s leading donor of humanitarian assistance for the Syria crisis; has given nearly $7.7 billion in aid throughout the region since 2011. https://t.co/YrLbcKPoxU
@DavidSantoro1 And the "globalism" the Trump populists decry really has in many ways hamstrung US options for responding to a Chinese regime w/ zero qualms going it alone for its gain and at the expense of everyone else.
@DavidSantoro1 It's also going to manifest itself differently depending on the nature of the government we're talking about. Russian nationalism is a whole lot different than American nationalism
Except there's evidence of voter fraud and pointing that out is defending, not attacking, the electoral process. The drumbeat from the anti-Trump ppl has been that *his* election is illegitimate due to Russian interference, Russia "collusion", he lost the popular vote, etc https://t.co/ucrLBgMQS6
If the Kim regime doesn't willingly dismantle its nuclear missile program, it isn't Trump's fault. It's also not Obama's fault. Or Bush's fault, or Clinton's etc-- not ultimately. Ultimately, it's the fault of the Kim regime. And the blame shld go squarely there, w/ consequence.
Because we really need to chew on this concept of nationalism, here's another bite at it. Macron was wrong. He's either unable or unwilling to understand what the Trump admin is saying. OR he knows perfectly well but thinks it's in France's interests to argue against the concept. https://t.co/JbNqdAXPXR

@JoshNBCNews No. Because we are implementing sanctions again- back to pre JCPOA levels. The argument was/is- we can make a deal that doesn't flush the regime w/ cash to continue funding all of its destabilizing activity. And so far the Trump team is proving that to be true

Reasonable ppl disagree on what are wise programs and policies to resource within the defense budget. Nevertheless, the above statement is simply true.
Republicans, in general, tend to be more supportive of higher defense budgets and agree with the president's NDS and NPR. Dems, in general, do not, and have not been shy about disagreeing. If Dems win the majority in the House the admin will have a hard time resourcing its agenda

@LauraTripp57 @FoxNews @foxandfriends Not what I said. As far as the amount and kind of spending goes, Republicans as a party are willing to spend more on nat defense. The Dems prioritize domestic spending. It's why the GOP-controlled Senate has to attach domestic spending to defense Approps to get the votes.
@PoCarterr @FoxNews @foxandfriends It doesn't. National defense and other discretionary spending is being crowded out by mandatory spending; mainly, SS and healthcare and interest on the debt.

@Woolaf @bpmckeon64 @JBWolfsthal @steven_pifer @ElbridgeColby What I mean is (and twitter isn't great for this kind of convo!) we won't have a mil requirement that is met by a prohibited weapon system. It doesn't mean we couldn't really use it especially considering how much more affordable it is vs alternatives
@JBWolfsthal @bpmckeon64 @steven_pifer @ElbridgeColby Admiral Harris's 2017 testimony plainly stated we are outmatched and unable to close the gap due to INF. I think there has long been heartburn over the the treaty combined w/ Russia's noncompliance. Confluence of those two things made patience evaporate
@bpmckeon64 @JBWolfsthal @steven_pifer @ElbridgeColby I've asked and have been told- we do not do mil requirements for illegal weapon systems. (I've been poking around on this for a while!) Maybe what we can do by way of R&amp;D and notional planning is good enough. I don't know.

@JBWolfsthal @steven_pifer @ElbridgeColby Withdrawing from the treaty, one that Russia was cheating on and had no interest in complying, and doing it sooner rather than later, gives this admin a little elbow room to make some decisions
@JBWolfsthal @steven_pifer @ElbridgeColby And, if this is wrong I'm happy to be corrected, but my understanding is we can't actually go through the process of coming up with mil requirements for weapon systems that are illegal. Sure, we can explore possible notional capabilities. But that's not the same thing.

Arms control can only contribute positively to security if it is enforced. Period. The Russians have been violating the INF Treaty for years while it continues to tie the United State's hands. Meanwhile ~95% of China's missiles would violate INF if China was a signatory. https://t.co/pxxW3rzkmV
Thanks for watching! https://t.co/rEbdFsG1Gh
The Obama admin first publicly announced Russia's INF violations in 2014 and since then Russia has been violating it more aggressively even as the US has tried to compel it to comply. The blame for the US withdrawal of the treaty rests squarely w/ Russia. 100%.

@RadioFreeTom @GrayConnolly @RussCanRead @nytimes It's not a narrative, it's true. The Post in particular is painting this picture like it was [name your favorite sweetheart US reporter] who was dismembered alive and ppl are getting whipped into an irrational frenzy over it.
@RadioFreeTom @GrayConnolly @RussCanRead @nytimes I think we should condemn the murder. So there's no disagreement there.
@RadioFreeTom @GrayConnolly @RussCanRead @nytimes There's nothing moral about facilitating a gigantic bloodbath that spans the entire Arab world.
@RadioFreeTom @GrayConnolly @RussCanRead @nytimes Whataboutism is defending something that is wrong by saying it's ok because someone else did it too. I'm not doing that. I'm saying I have always thought the position that we should pressure the Saudis privately for reforms while continuing our strategic partnership has been wise
@GrayConnolly @RadioFreeTom @RussCanRead @nytimes This is exactly right. I cannot stress enough how right this is.
@RadioFreeTom @RussCanRead @nytimes And I raised that list in several of my meetings. I could go on and on about all the ways I've personally pushed them when I was in a position to do so. I also understand the strategic implications of shifting US strategy away from KSA.
@RadioFreeTom @RussCanRead @nytimes I'm not whatabouting. Obama was right about this. I have been a long time critic of the Saudi govt. It is why I went to Saudi more than a decade ago-- to raise all kinds of concerns in light of the massive FMS of the Bush admin. I carried around a list of political prisoners
@RadioFreeTom @RussCanRead @nytimes I'd like our major media outlets to do better than parrot Turkish propaganda. That would be a helpful start.
@RadioFreeTom @RussCanRead @nytimes Obama defended the Saudi relationship. This isn't a Trump thing. Not everything is about Trump.
@RadioFreeTom Alright. Then you should agree with me: Wear shoes, use your brain.
@RussCanRead @RadioFreeTom @nytimes I do not think it's "acceptable" either. I don't know why ppl can be more nuanced here. Very frustrating. I think our response needs to make sense and be rational and we shouldn't whitewash what's happening here
@RussCanRead @RadioFreeTom @nytimes Totally agree. And this is the piece I point ppl to when I say there should be more like this. This only skims the surface
@RadioFreeTom Not what I said. The media is driving this based on unsubstantiated Turkish reporting and lionizing Khashoggi as a "liberal reformer." It's just not true. And they're whipping up an emotional response when there shld be a calm, measured one.
What a disaster https://t.co/dsxnwkC5sF
@RadioFreeTom I think it matters very much that the media is parroting Turkish reporting and characterizing Khashoggi as a Post journalist who wrote about liberal reforms, yes. Ppl are getting whipped into an emotional frenzy and that's no way to make policy or develop strategy
@RadioFreeTom Why do you think it's not being covered if it doesn't have a different impact on how ppl are responding to this
@RadioFreeTom He was an Islamist Muslim Brotherhood apologist, Tom. It doesn't excuse his murder. But it's part of the story that is getting very little coverage.
@EWErickson Sorry, Erick*
@EWErickson Nice piece, Erik. I'd add that KSA's interests DO align w/ US strategy in the ME, which is also what makes it necessary to cooperate in a variety of ways. We can do more to pressure changes w/in KSA, but probably prudent to work on those privately

@EllemanIISS He 100% didn't deserve murder and his murderers shld be held to account. But he wasn't an advocate of democracy, in principle, as his Post colleagues continue to write. More accurately, he was an advocate of political Islam, generally, and the Muslim Brotherhood, specifically.

@EllemanIISS I guess I don't see what's new here. KSA is going to be hard for as far as I can imagine into the future. The question is- is KSA a threat to the US or can it be in our corner on the issues we've prioritized? And is it moving in the right/wrong direction re internal reforms

@NarangVipin Ha, well. That was supposed to be funny. (Grimacing civilly). Happy to discuss in another forum.
@NarangVipin I'm grimacing. But doing so civilly.
@NarangVipin Twitter has lost its usefulness here. My parting thought- GMD is better than you think. And the strategy for BMD vs DPRK wld look very different than the strategy towards those other states we accepted as nuclear powers
@NarangVipin That's not all we should do, either, IMV. I'd also start ramping up BMD in the region and at home in a pretty serious way. Another popular idea among the arms control crowd. ;)
@NarangVipin Each one is different of course and so i don't think we can fairly put them in the same basket. But I'm also not arguing for war. What I'm willing to say at this point is that I think there are benefits to "pushing on that door" by keeping (getting back?) a tough sanctions regime
@NarangVipin I don't think he's willing to disarm at all. Unilaterally or otherwise. I think offering incentives for disarmament up front is the worst possible move. And I think accepting DPRK as a nuclear state will be a monumental disaster for several reasons including for nonpro efforts
@yashar They at least have to be confirmed by US intelligence. Nothing will be settled merely on the word of anonymous Turkish officials
@NarangVipin We'll see. This thing isn't finished. The admin clearly hasn't moved on towards "making peace" w/ a purely containment/deterrent strategy and is still aiming for dismantlement. At some point the clock is simply going to run out and the reaction is TBD

So they found a guy who hates Lee and claims to be a descendent of Lee to "disavow" the president's praise of Lee's military prowess (which everyone who knows about Lee agrees is commendable) as part of Trump's lead up to his praise of GRANT. Ok.

@NarangVipin That was the admin's strategy and there IS truth to it. I don't know why ppl wld dismiss it out of hand. I recognize other reasons that had to have gone into DPRK's calculation but I don't know why we'd expect the NSA to advertise those either

@EdwardHBOh I've been arguing *for years* that we ought to squeeze these countries privately for reforms as one criteria for FMS. I even went to KSA because of this issue and carried a list of names of political prisoners in KSA that I took out and read to officials from time to time.

@DavidSantoro1 @crispinrovere Oh I'm 100% with you there. But that takes some smoothing out and the Trump admin has been a bit inconsistent in application. Defending US sovereignty and working within (true) alliances should take into account our principles.

@crispinrovere @DavidSantoro1 BUT I also have a hard time condemning it too hard because I also recognize the problems the president is trying to address. "Free trade" w/ countries like China hasn't really resulted in the kinds of things we'd like to see from a natsec perspective. (And it's not really free)
@crispinrovere @DavidSantoro1 That's pretty good. I wld just say it's really the last one more than anything and it takes prudence to know how to defend it. Like @DavidSantoro1 I am wary of tariffs because I'm having a hard time seeing how the consumer isn't the one who just gets whacked.

@DavidSantoro1 I don't know about the US being respected for "America First" since that's kind of a hard thing to define here at home let alone abroad. But I have found decisiveness, clarity, resolve qualities that are respected and those have been improved (tho still room for improvement)
