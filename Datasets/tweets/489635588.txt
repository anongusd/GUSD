@brill_leah There is so much hate and division in America right now. I hate to see people suffer and be in pain. But I just want to get the facts about what happened to this poor guy before premature conclusions are made.
@brill_leah I understand there has been horrific injustices against especially black males by police. I was horrified when I saw the policeman shoot a black man in the back. There are some bad cops out there &amp; things have to change.
@brill_leah Living in the South, we have been integrated for years. We live around, work, go to school, church and have many friends of other races. We don’t have all of this racial tension &amp; we get along. We have learned to respect each other &amp; our police treat races here pretty fairly.
@brill_leah I was broken hearted when that sweet little 7 year old girl was shot in Texas and there was a manhunt for 2 white men and there was all this racial anger on social media, and it turned out to be 2 black men that shot into this car.
@thehill I respect that. Anytime I see someone wearing one anywhere, I immediately think they are an idiot &amp; I don’t want to be anywhere around them. If I was seated next to a group wearing these at a restaurant, I would leave &amp; eat somewhere else. To me a MAGA hat shows racism/bullying.
@TrinityResists @Boba_Tea_Catan Lindsey Graham lost his moral compass with the death of John McCain.
@thehill @VP If you want to make a difference on the border than our ports of entry need to be highly regulated &amp; all vehicles thoroughly investigated. This is where illegal drugs are coming into the US. This is what the Democrats have been fighting for.
@thehill @VP I can’t wait to see how you are going to build a wall on the Texas border when you are going to try to take away the homeowners &amp; ranchers land. Trump is already trying to force an American church to be placed on the opposite side of the wall giving this land to Mexico.

@SenGillibrand I hate to say this because it sounds ridiculous, but it is true. And it is why many of them voted for Trump over voting for Clinton in the White House, &amp; I believe it is one reason that Trump won. I would hope this was not the case, but it is rampant here in the South.
@SenGillibrand I like you. What I hear is that we have to get a candidate that can beat Trump. The South is not progressive like the east &amp; west. There are many people here who will vote Dem instead of voting Trump. But I will tell you one thing, these backward men will not vote for a woman.
@RepJoeKennedy I thought this would only benefit Republicans, because all Democrats are on government assistance &amp; don’t work.... lol
@Jim_Jordan Democrats have tried &amp; tried to fund better port of entry surveillance, detection &amp; security. This is the Democrats first priority to strengthen our ports of entry. Stop deflecting about a stupid wall. They can tunnel, use ladders, use equipment to destroy it... etc.
RT @RepSwalwell: Ok. You’re not getting a wall. https://t.co/49xhd3qpy1
@brill_leah And yes I have been a victim, but Americans tend to jump to conclusions before the facts are in. Whoever did this will get caught and they will be punished severely.
@brill_leah I hate those MAGA hates and I am not a Trump supporter.
@brill_leah No. I don’t think he faked the attack. But nothing has been said about the perpetrators being white that I know of. What happened to him is horrific, but I think we need to wait until the facts come out before a bunch of speculations are made that might be false.
@brill_leah I am tired of people jumping to conclusions until the facts are in. For all we know these are 2 people he knew that had some personal vendetta against him. It is hard for me to believe this was random &amp; they were just hanging out at 2am in 31 below degree weather for him.
@brill_leah They are not even sure those are the two men that attacked him. They can’t find any other footage on hundreds of hours of videos from businesses near the alleged scene.
@brill_leah I think there is more to this story. I believe he was attacked, but I am not convinced about the motives. All faces are covered in Chicago right now. They have record breaking low temperatures &amp; walking outside without face protection can cause people’s lungs to freeze &amp; death
@Kathyk74672849 @GreenLantern4 @SpeakerPelosi Obamacare are has been very successful. What you don’t understand is that insurance companies are for profit. They jack up rates &amp; then blame it on Obamacare because they want it gone, while their CEOs make millions &amp; they are making record profits.
@Kathyk74672849 @GreenLantern4 @SpeakerPelosi Obamacare did not screw up healthcare. It saved hundreds of rural hospitals across this nation from closing. It took away pre-existing conditions &amp; allowed kids to be on their parent’s plan until the age of 26z it has been very successful &amp; has insured millions.
@Kathyk74672849 @GreenLantern4 @SpeakerPelosi As a medical professional, I actually know what I am talking about. Medicare has NOTHING to do with Obamacare whatsoever. That is a program funded by a person’s taxes that have been paid in their lifetime. Obamacare is a totally different funded program.

@SpeakerPelosi The worst thing that has happened to Medicare was allowing some of it to be privatized to private HMOs for profit. They lie to the elderly about their plans &amp; then deny care. I think this is elderly abuse and the government should no longer sublet this out to private companies

@GreenLantern4 @SpeakerPelosi Obamacare has nothing to do with Medicare. Get educated before you tweet responses.

@brill_leah I would like to see more proof before this is spun. This does not sound like a random attack by 2 guys walking around with “bleach” &amp; a noose at 2 am in freezing temps in Chicago. I just think there is much more to this story. If this happened, it sounds like he was targeted.
@brill_leah Hours and Hours of videos were watched with no proof of these 2 men. They did uncover one today with 2 possible suspects. He said it was a substance. I think he would have stated it was bleach initially if this was the case due to the smell.
@mijttocs @donewithorange @Stephan99161282 @Franklin_Graham I guess you didn’t get to read Trump’s contract with these porn stars &amp; his escapades. This is the proof. It specifically addresses children being produced by his affairs. Dr. Trump states he was for abortion until he ran on the Republican ticket and had to lie to get votes.
@donewithorange @Stephan99161282 @Franklin_Graham I agree... the Republicans act like Democrats love abortion. We hate it. But it is legal because a woman has the right to choose per our law and almost half of Republicans are for it being legal.
@MaryMattson7 @Franklin_Graham Of course. The GOP did nothing. Actions speak louder than words. You glorify the Republican Party because they say they are against abortion, but they do nothing when they are in power. Actions speak louder than words.
@MaryMattson7 @Franklin_Graham No one likes abortion. In fact almost 1/2 of the Republican Party is for abortion being legal, and there are many Democrats against as well. The GOP had the power and the votes the past two years to severely limit it to less than 12 weeks, cutting out over 75% of all abortions.
@brill_leah I would really like to see a video of these 2 guys that did this to him. There are video cameras everywhere &amp; none of them have captured these 2 attackers. They just show this guy alone. Before big conclusions are drawn, I want to see some evidence other than his accusations.
@funder Sometimes this tactic is taken with high profile people so they do not have the opportunity to commit suicide. It actually is protective for them. He was arrested for lying &amp; destroying evidence. They did not want him to have another opportunity to discard anything. No Big Deal
@RepAdamSchiff They were probably wearing MAGA hats. The bullying is now trickling to our environment.
@brucestoll2 @RepAdamSchiff This is what happens with smaller government &amp; lack of regulation. Trump’s deregulation is what enables to rich to get richer by doing things that hurt our environment and American workers. And don’t forget the mass shooting victims. Bump Stocks &amp; AR-15s are still legal.
@Warrior_1 @RepAdamSchiff @MorganMontague This comment proves that larger government &amp; regulation is what Americans need. What most people don’t understand is that there are thousands &amp; thousands of unstable, mentally ill &amp; immoral people in America. Thus the need for more oversight &amp; protections for earth/people in US
@NicolleDWallace @SteveSchmidtSES Just what we don’t need - another grossly rich narcissist who made money off the backs of the American people. A cup of Starbucks coffee costs more than what most Americans can afford on a daily basis, but he was successful in getting them hooked on it.
@Franklin_Graham Abortion is legal. Why are there not lawsuits being initiated &amp; funded by the GOP to have this reconsidered in the Supreme Court? Why is legislation not being done to limit it? The GOP has been in control for two years - they are all talk &amp; no action.
@Franklin_Graham Why stop funding to an agency that provides free birth control????? How stupid. If you want to stop $$$ for the small aspect of abortions they perform (which is usually medication induced), so be it. But don’t contribute to more unwanted pregnancies by denying birth control.
@Franklin_Graham On top of that, Planned Parenthood is an agency that provides Pap smears, mammograms &amp; Birth Control. Less than 10% is abortion related. It takes wks to get in &amp; then there is a waiting period. By limiting abortions to 12 wks or less would disqualify it in the majority of cases.
@Franklin_Graham On top of that, polling shows that only 22% of Americans are against abortion being illegal and almost half of the Republicans think it should be legal. This platform the GOP supposedly stands behind is all talk &amp; no action. I am tired of them platforming on this - all talk.
@Franklin_Graham Why let the GOP brainwash you into thinking they are Pro-Life. They do nothing to restrict it when they are in power. This is their platform just so they can get your votes. Actions speak words. Trump limited it to 20 weeks. This was already the law in 47 states - why not 12 wks?
@Franklin_Graham No one likes abortion - No one. The Supreme Court declared it legal, because it was rampant &amp; multiple people were dying &amp; others profiting. Why did the GOP not limit it to 12 weeks or less nationwide when they had the power? Thus would have stopped over 75% of them being done?
@Franklin_Graham I also get tired of comments about killing “babies”. I hate abortion but Christ cares about the soul not the flesh. These babies don’t have to come to this corrupt world - their soul goes to heaven. One day of neglect/abuse for an unwanted child is torture. Christ will judge them
@Franklin_Graham Your Republican followers sound like a bunch of Pharisees. Your tweet just was a forum for people to say Democrats are godless. The Dems care more about the people on this earth &amp; their basic needs - healthcare, programs that help the poor &amp; the widows &amp; the oppressed.....
@stylemeinPINK @RoverGrover @Franklin_Graham Haha...... while there have been millions spent a week on protecting Trump Tower, flying the President and his kids separately for vacations, and flying his kids all over the world to make Trump’s business dealings. Don Jr’s recent trip cost Americans $900,000.00
@Dmacs2000Mc @Franklin_Graham Worst tweet of the week. Be careful about building your house on a faulty foundation because as a Democrat mine is built on rock. Our agenda is about helping the American people, not suppressing them so the ridiculous rich get even richer at workers expense.
@donewithorange @Stephan99161282 @Franklin_Graham I agree. These anti-abortion advocates only care about the flesh, not the soul as the Bible teaches us. One day of abuse or neglect in the life of an unwanted child is devastating. These unwanted “babies” get to bypass this corrupt world &amp; go straight to heaven. What a blessing.

@MaryMattson7 @Franklin_Graham Really. Don’t speak for me or my Christian Democrat friends. You don’t have a clue. Trump has shown us that he has no Christian ethics, morals or values &amp; he doesn’t even care how corrupt he is. His greed permeates pure evil. I am part of a party that loves Christ &amp; Americans.
@HeyHeyoldman @senatemajldr Haha.... you have been brainwashed by Fox News
@senatemajldr This is a blatant projection statement. This is what the GOP has done for years. It has been more difficult for a Democrat to win due to the GOP trying to control this process. I will be so happy when you are out of the Senate. When I see you speak, you permeate pure evil.
@HeyHeyoldman @senatemajldr If you want your vote to count, please vote straight Democrat. I used to be a Republican. I am now a proud Democrat - a party who actually cares about people &amp; the environment. The independent vote just splits the Democrat votes &amp; enables the Republicans to win.

@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Not BH threatening to pull out &amp; treating our allies poorly, while he treats Putin &amp; Kim Jong-un with maximal respect. Our allies don’t trust Trump. They are considering forming their own alliances without us involved. Putin wants NATO dissolved &amp; Trump is trying to do that.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I know specifically about Paula Jones if that is what you are referring to.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Clinton was impeached and he lost his law license. His Presidency has forever been tarnished. I think he has been held accountable and had suffered immensely for his indiscretions.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Apparantly there is something about having to change your W2 in regards to your taxes thus past year.

@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Please get off Clinton. They are no longer a political issue. At this point you are just deflecting what is currently going on with Trump.

@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You know what. Clinton is no longer an issue. She lost. She is out of the spotlight. It is time to stop deflecting what Trump is doing by bringing up Hillary all the time. That chapter is over &amp; she is no longer present in today’s political arena.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You should look up Yemen &amp; the Humanitarian crisis. The US has played a major role &amp; thousands of people have died of starvation. Trump had us helping in a war without Congressional approval. The Senate just voted against it- he can no longer allow our planes to refuel the Saudis
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump One of them had the IRS office help her in filing her return.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So not true. Lies made up by Fox News. Hillary wasn’t trying to commit a crime. She was planning on running for President. Using a private server was wrong. I blame the people responsible in this department for allowing her to do this. They should have done their job.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You just think it was a poor investigation because she was found not to be guilty? The FBI doesn’t function that way to exonerate the guilty. Trump asked Russia to find the missing emails &amp; was explicitly involved in the DNC hacks. He used this info to see their strategic agenda
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They gave her permission to delete her private emails. There was no confidential information that was allegedly hacked. There were 3 emails that were later placed as classified after they were reviewed, but they weren’t classified when she received them.
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Haha... and who is making sure your civil rights aren’t violated?

@PHXGTR @FuturamaKing @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Your vote may never count. You vote for the party that best holds your values. There are many young Dems just voted into the House because they are tired of the current political situation and they want to make positive changes for the future.
@PHXGTR @FuturamaKing @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou The Democratic Party is diverse &amp; that is a fact. The Republicans want to take away many rights - abortion, healthcare, LGBT, Planned Parenthood which provides birth control to thousands, making Congress part of the Executive Branch, not allowing Obama to appoint as SC Justice...
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why do you think Kavanaugh was chosen? He wasn’t on the short list. He was added at the last minute because he had made statements that he did not believe a President should be investigated while in office. No one is above the law.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It was obvious. Men get angry and belligerent when they are guilty. His behavior as well as his political statements made him unfit. These judges are not supposed to let a political agenda enter into their thinking &amp; decision making process. There were much better candidates.
@drugdealin4life @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou No one said anything about an overbearing government. The DEA makes sure we are not sold dangerous drugs, the USDA makes sure we are not being sold tainted meat, the FBI/CIA/Police makes sure dangerous criminals are taken off the streets.... Cutting important agencies is not it.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Hillary has no indictments.... she was extensively investigated by the FBI. Even though they said her private server was unwise, there was no crime committed. The FBI does not give passes on crimes, no matter what you believe.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Huh? .... HaHa.... the Republicans are the ones that deregulated the oversight &amp; restrictions on banks allowing them to make loans with variable APRs. When Bush caused our economy to tank, these people’s loan payments doubled.... thus the housing crisis.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He was a little busy handling our crashing economy.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Tariffs do nothing but hurt both countries, especially in regards to equal trade. These inflated prices trickle right down to the consumer purchasing these goods.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump .... and we did not foot the entire bill for NATO. The other nations contributed, just not what they had promised. As I stated before, this was an easy fix.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The US has been involved in multiple missions with our allies. The French built our Statute of Liberty. We have paid more than our allies, but this was an easy fix by holding them accountable, not by pulling out of NATO. Where do you think a lot of our bases are overseas?
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are he one that said Hillary backed him. She thought she was doing the right thing at the time and I believe that she truly loves him. I am sure she knew about some of the others &amp; she made a choice to remain married to him.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Feinstein should have never kept her letter confidential. She should have reported this to the WH so he would have never been considered. There were many other great candidates. There was no problem with the previous appointment. This guy was an issue - even McConnell disagreed.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You need to be careful about saying that. Her testimony was very credible &amp; she had reported this many years earlier to her Psychiatrist, her husband &amp; her friends.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I know several of his mistresses personally &amp; they were not trailer trash. What do you think the jolted wife is going to say? Trump was playing around with porn stars. Monica was all about it at the time. She even stated that she loved him. What he did &amp; lying about it was wrong.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He did not rape anyone. This person was paid by the GOP to say this, just like what they just tried to do to Mueller. Clinton &amp; Trump are both cheaters but the sex was consensual. The GOP even paid Paula Jones as well as funding her face lift to appear more credible on tv.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They have made millions in speaking engagements &amp; their book deals. The bombing of that plant was wrong &amp; based on wrong intel. He also bombed Afghanistan the same day trying to take out Bin Laden. If he had been successful then 9/11 may have been avoided.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Colin Powell was told to lie to the UN by President Bush. Powell admits this is the biggest mistake he ever made in his life. It wasn’t the UN that put us in Iraq. It was Bush/Chaney. It was a diversion. They knew there were no WeaponsOfMD &amp; that Bin Laden was in Afghanistan.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I know one thing. Texas is a very wealthy state. If they thought they needed a wall on all of their borders, they would have already done it.... even if they had to use prison labor. Many communities cross back &amp; forth to shop, visit, eat... etc. it has been their way of life.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The wall was supposed to be built on the Mexico side &amp; Mexico was going to pay for it. Remember? Now there are huge legistical issues in regards to this, including taking people’s land.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This caused them to go into hiding and stop reporting to the immigration offices as they had done for years. Parking tickets are not crimes.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No immigrants should be here illegally. Obama had a plan if they registered as illegal immigrants that he would try to provide a pathway to citizenship. Trump instead used this list to deport them - people that had been here for decades with spouses, children &amp; businesses.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The issue is the temper tantrum, the lying about the immigrants and the inability for Trump to negotiate. He just wants his way only. The Dems will give him some wall funding I think if he will compromise on immigration policies for refugees &amp; The Dreamers.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The Democrats will not provide wall funding unless there are protections in place for DACA/The Dreamers. The Dems already gave him funding for sins of the wall and he rejected it. He didn’t even spend the money he was given last year for this.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There are areas where a wall would be beneficial. Democrats have promoted this through the years. Most of the wall has not been built. Trump lied saying this is being done. The only thing that is being done is done repairs of the existing wall.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I think all of this will come out in time. The previous indiscretions Trump committed in regards to his business tactics &amp; bankruptcies are public knowledge &amp; factual.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What about Fox News? When I watch it, all they do is spill hate and lies and scare tactics- not facts. The MSM are biased. That is obvious, but Trump has given them the ammunition due to his unstable behavior &amp; continuous lying to the American people.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How do you know that they are not reporting facts? Many of these leaks are coming from the White House by his own staff who are unsettled by what is occurring there. Rex Tillerson reported that he had to tell Trump daily that he could not do certain things he thought he could do.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There have been many indictments and they all have to do with Trump &amp; the campaign &amp; lying to the FBI &amp; Congress.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The Steele Dossier was initially started by a Republican running against Trump in the race for the Republican ticket. When Trump won the candidacy, then the Dems picked this up to have this completed. It was not with a Russian adversary. It was by a British Intelligence agent.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I have a lot of friends and family that live in rural areas. Many times I don’t even get cell phone service when I visit them. This can be a bigger issue than many people understand.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That was Paul Ryan’s gift to President Trump when he resigned. He added this to the farm bill to try to let Trump keep fueling the Saudi planes with fuel in this human humanitarian crisis where thousands have starved to death &amp; more are as we speak.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They both owe this year. P.S.....A tweet only allows a small amount of info. The point is is that they both made the same amount this past year as the year before. Instead of getting a tax refund like they got last year, they both owe.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump ... and what was that? She had permission to delete her private emails before turning over the ones that were government related. The GOP spun this like she did this without authorization. Wikileaks was hacking of the DNC - this is like Watergate - Just electronic theft.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Just because a lot of rural people can’t stay informed many times because of inability to get internet or cable service is not their fault. Choosing to watch Fox News if they do is a problem. Many of them work very hard as Farmers..etc. That have bigger fish to fry than politics.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I have been a political junkie for decades &amp; I pride myself on staying informed. This is why I USED to be a Staunch Republican &amp; now I am a Proud Yellow Dog Democrat. The Republican Party used to be about freedom. Now it is about control; they are bullies with their own agenda.
@Jakeatview @EricEGraf2 @realDonaldTrump One that was inherited and has been trending up since early in the Obama Administration by Obama’s economic policies.
@life_as_a_beach @KericAllen @realDonaldTrump Haha... You are kidding me right. Why don’t you take a break from watching Fox News.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump also gives them plenty of garbage for them to cover, &amp; a lot of this is pure deflection so that they will not cover the fact that he colluded with Russia, our foreign adversary - against the law. He has been corrupt for decades. He is used to getting his way - $$$/Power
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He used social media to get free coverage during his campaign. He said &amp; did outrageous things so that they would keep covering him. Then he berated them at his rallies, even encouraging violence against them. The MSM are not going to give him a break. They do not respect him.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump God Bless You Too
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are right. I do not like him. This stems from my connections with how he bankrupted the Jersey Shore &amp; how he did not compensate multiple workers there. Many people that live in New Jersey &amp; New York knew he was scum &amp; knew was brainwashing his base by his lies about himself
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He is corrupt &amp; he has committed multiple crimes. The racism he expressed on the campaign trail was sickening. His agenda is only about himself &amp; for the ability for he &amp; his family to make money now &amp; in the future. Thus his connections with Russia &amp; Saudi Arabia.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Haha... who are you kidding? It is projected to cost 100 billion. There are 2000 miles total &amp; the 5 billion was going to cover less than 200 miles. You are also not accounting for the lawsuits due to eminent domain with the landowners &amp; other logistics like the terrain.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Bush only invaded Iraq to act after 9/11. It never had anything to do with weapons of mass destruction &amp; they were never found. Seventy percent of Americans believe we invaded Iraq due to Osama Bin Laden &amp; Bush knew he was not there but lead Americans to believe this.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The Clintons were well educated &amp; excellent in the political arena, mainly due to their experience &amp; their ethics having to do with what was best for the American people. Bill also kept us out of war. I did not vote for Bill, but he is not trash. This is plain GOP propaganda.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The Clintons did some wonderful things including the stabilization of our economy. Bill did not rape anyone - ridiculous comment. How can you talk about Bill’s indiscretions when Trump has done the same &amp; probably worse? Hillary stood by him, so is Melania at this point.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why did we need a trade war with Canada? Unnecessary. I agree with better trade agreements, but not with Tariffs that end up hurting Americans. They don’t just sell products to us. We sell to them, so inflated tariffs go both ways &amp; now we have to bailout the farmers.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Not true. Where have you been? Watching Fox? Our alliance with NATO has successfully kept us out of a world war &amp; we have worked together for the greater good since. Negotiating with China so Ivanka can make large profits is about the Trump family. It is not about America
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It started with Obama &amp; has continued due to his economic plan. Trump doesn’t get credit for inheriting one of the best economic stability ever when he became President. Obama inherited the worst &amp; he fixed it. The stock market is not stable at present.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The farm bill happened because of his tariffs. Now we are having to pay farmers for the money they are losing. Soybean prices are in toilet. They also didn’t get these checks when the government was shut down. The farm bill also had tort saying the House could not debate Yemen.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are so wrong. Gas &amp; milk were $4.00 a gallon, multiple houses were being foreclosed on due to GOP deregulation of banks, multiple factories closed... etc. if it wasn’t for the bailouts from Obama the economy would have crashed. Bush put us in financial demise d/t Iraq War
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are clueless. One of them was left by her cheating husband &amp; the other is young &amp; does not make much money but works full time. Neither one of them can afford to purchase things they want. They are working hard &amp; getting by the best they can. People like you are out of touch.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Watch the elections. Urban areas tend to be blue - FACT. If you just watch Fox, you are uniformed. Did you not see the coverage from the White House about garage sales, loans, getting groceries on store credit, inability to understand how people live paycheck to paycheck... ???
@JudgeJeanine This is a Projection statement .... Everything Trump does is for his base. Pelosi is just our Democratic representative speaking for the Dems &amp; we don’t want a 100 billion dollar wall that will take 16 years to build &amp; only after multiple lawsuits with landowners.
@realDonaldTrump I want to thank you for reopening the government yesterday. It was the right thing to do. This may be the 1st thing you have done that I agree with. Please don’t do it again. The Dems will not fund your wall. If you want to negotiate, protect the Dreamers. That is compromise.

@yupei1004 @realDonaldTrump You just made yourself look like an idiot.
@EricEGraf2 @realDonaldTrump What would be best for our nation would be if Trump resigns. We need a real President, who actually cares about Americans. A wall does not show this that he cares. He is trying to fulfill a campaign promise that he could not get funded when the GOP had the power. He ❤️s Russia.

@KunickiJoe @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou You don’t have a clue.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump When Clinton was President we had a balanced budget &amp; no national debt. Bush placed us billions of dollars in debt with his BS war &amp; Trump has now put us trillion dollars in debt due to tax cuts for the rich. Now he wants a 100 billion dollar wall. This debt will catch up with us
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You think things are good when Trump has put us at odds with all of our allies while he embraces 2 evil dictators? This puts us at risk and people all over the world hate Trump &amp; want to know what is wrong with Americans that they would vote in such a corrupt narcissist.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Obama started this &amp; it has been trending up since. Trump cannot take the credit for this. Why am I not happy??? The stock market has now been unstable &amp; multiple farmers are going bankrupt &amp; multiple factories are closing. He is placing us in trade wars which are hurting us.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I know 2 people who work very hard &amp; live paycheck to paycheck. Both of them got a nice tax refund last year. Both of them just did their taxes &amp; they owe a considerable amount of money &amp; their income has not changed. I think Americans are going to get a rude awakening this year.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Obama saved America. He inherited the worst economy imaginable &amp; turned it around. Now Trump takes the credit for an economy that has been growing ever since Obama initiated the programs in place. Large tax cuts for the rich just make them richer. They are not doing trickle down.
@Theoldman4810 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Haha...like the rich men now in power that think we can go to the grocery store and get groceries on credit or just go get a loan easily. Most of the Trumpsters in my state are rural &amp; poor. Most educated people that live in urban areas are Democrats as they stay better informed.
@FuturamaKing @PHXGTR @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Being an Independent is a cop out. I used to be a Republican.

We are all equal.
@FuturamaKing @PHXGTR @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou You got to pick a side. Being an Independent just enables the GOP to win. Every Republican I know has the platform for small government.

@FuturamaKing @PHXGTR @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Unfortunately the ability for oversight &amp; our protection requires a larger number of employees &amp; a larger government. Trump still has not replaced multiple key positions which he has not filled. There are multiple areas without oversight with qualified people. This puts us @ risk
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou What about the civil rights of kids being able to go to school &amp; not having to worry about a mass shooting? Nothing happening there in regards to our constitution to protect the most vulnerable. Taking away Bump Stocks is not taking away guns. We can’t even stop the sell of these
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Do you not understand that government programs have been put in place to protect Americans and our environment? The first department Trump tried to get rid of was the Ethics Committee? And why do you think he wanted them gone?
@connie_delaney @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Correct. Planned Parenthood provided birth control to try to avoid these unwanted pregnancies in the first place.
@PHXGTR @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou I feel that way about you. You can state the Constitution all you want, but a larger government that regulates to keep Americans safe and protect or civil rights is what is needed since the rich just want to get richer at all costs &amp; at American’s expense.
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Haha... the current situation is not following our constitution : the Senate acting by orders of the Executive Branch, Trump hiring his relatives &amp; running his businesses, colluding with a foreign government, a President saying his way only....

@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Trump wants to privatize our highways. The corporations who own then will charge tolls to maintain them. America not being the Land if the Free is a symbolistic statement. It means you won’t be able to travel freely without fees. It was not a literal comment.
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou You are wrong. Putin got rid of hundreds of government officials &amp; now there are 3. He has all the power &amp; no oversight. Of course they want to have all the power, but they do this by eliminating a large government &amp; being the sole leader.
@PHXGTR @MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Our civil rights are being violated by deregulating and allowing companies to not have to adhere to any regulated worker’s rights. The GOP is all about suppressing Americans who are not white men, and trying to take away LGBT rights, abortion freedoms... etc.
@PHXGTR @FuturamaKing @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou I know exactly what it means. The Constitution was written before OSHA, FHA, USPS, DEA, USDA, Medicare... unfortunately due to certain Americans taking advantage of others by selling bad food/drugs, polluting our waters... etc - it is now imperative that we have more regulation.
@AnnCoulter I would like to know who you &amp; Rush Limbaugh think you are? You are in control of nothing. I am glad both of you got humbled today. Trump actually finally did the right thing. I don’t know how you sleep at night. There are people leaving the GOP party in droves. You are to thank.

@MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou Pretty soon he will try to privatize everything. America will not longer be the land of the free. Trump wants corporations to manage highways &amp; then toll booths will be placed frequently all over our highways. Millionaires who were born into privilege cannot advocate for us.
@MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou When Trump cut all these positions, he started to deregulate everything so corporations could make more money. This was done &amp; protections for our environment, workers rights, oversight...etc - are now all in jeopardy. These rich people don’t care about anything but profit.
@MinoWarrior @oliesorphan @peormntt @peterdaou A dictators goal is to cut government so that they have more control with no oversight.

@funder Trump never wanted a wall. His campaign advisors wanted him to build something as one of his political platforms since he built things. They came up with this wall, &amp; Trump has had to promote it by Fake News &amp; scare tactics to rally his base. The Trumpsters bought right into it.
Why would anyone support the GOP when their biggest agendas have been tax cuts for the rich, taking away healthcare, easing laws so the mentally ill can purchase guns, not restricting bump stocks, placing us trillions in debt, building an unnecessary wall, bullying others....etc https://t.co/AVLJjAOGNQ

@funder @realDonaldTrump I think Trump thinks he is increasing his base, but I do believe that it will be his demise for re-election.

@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I am not judging. I am stating a fact that he does not attend church. The Bible talks of the importance of church in our lives. The Bible also talks about the quality of our leaders and that they should be our religious mentors.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP They resigned because they could not longer ethically defend Trump.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP You don’t know what God does. When bad things happen, it is because he allowed it and did not intervene. God is capable of punishment like in the time of Noah. Some people might consider destroying all humanity except for Noah &amp; his family is “bad”. He has a plan

@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Those are not names. They are facts.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I live in the South. The path to heaven is narrow. How do you know this child will ever even be exposed to Christianity? Atheism is rampant. Trump doesn’t even attend church - the only President I know who does not. The Bible places a great emphasis on church &amp; the community.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I hate abortion, but it is legal. Only the Supreme Court can change that. Trump had the ability to place strict regulations on abortions when he had the power the past 2 years and he did not. Research has shown that most Americans are actually for it being legal.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP God only cares about souls, so why are you hung up on the flesh??? Given the chance there are many people who would have preferred to go straight to heaven than to ever come here and suffer - illness, being unwanted, trauma.... etc
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I think people know that already. You can’t speak to God’s purpose. God allowed that baby to be conceived &amp; he allowed that baby to be aborted. He could have intervened and stopped it because he can, but he didn’t. You don’t know his plan.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP He is a puppet
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Neither am I, but it was worldwide news. It was documented later by a movie. The details were reported for weeks when it was exposed. I just mentioned the movie, because it actually pulls it all together for people that know nothing about it.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The Bible talks about not calling people names - like a fool.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I have not called anyone a name. A narcissist by the way is a medical term. Saying someone is unethical, immoral and racist are all facts and since he has been televised doing all of these things, it can’t be disputed.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP And most of these children probably won’t be saved. They are lucky they don’t have to come to this corrupt ”world” as an unwanted child. People with near death experiences don’t want to come back here after experiencing heaven. God does not care about the flesh - just the soul
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I think your money could have been used better, but that is your business. He also asked for campaign money before &amp; after his speech in the WH. These speeches should be to unify - not divide. He is so unethical - no other President would have done this.

You should never call people names -.very childish
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I am a Christian, and so are my Democratic friends. We believe all people are equal in God’s eyes and he will be the judge. You will find the Democrats are no longer going to tolerate Trump and elections have consequences.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP What do you think Bump Stocks do ????? Just because you suffer from mental illness does not mean you are disabled. A teenager who has had the police at their house repeatedly for violence &amp; who has had multiple psych stays should not be able to purchase a gun.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The GOP only said they were for preexisting conditions due to the mid-term elections. They lied. The lawsuit is Texas proves it. It is the Democratic platform and they were scared on losing their seat, and a lot of them did.

@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The Trumps using this shutdown to get funding for his political campaign by asking people to buy fake bricks &amp; placing sick humor on this government shutdown is deplorable.

@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP So you are saying Democrats don’t work? .... What you are saying is ridiculous. It sounds like you get your facts from the lying false news station - FOX
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Investigative Journalists are essential in holding people accountable &amp; finding out the truth -The Constitution specifically addresses this. These type of Journalists are the ones that exposed the child molestations by thousands of Catholic Priests, as well as the cover-up.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Carr did not say the article was completely wrong, which he would have said if it was.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP What a wonderful Christian thing to say - worse than calling someone a fool. I bet your wife is so proud to be married to a man that uses that kind of language to women. The problem with extremists on the right is that they can’t handle the truth - now you are bullying like Trump
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The 1st bill passed when Trump was President was easing the ability for the mentally ill to purchase guns. Certain guns, such as military style with the capacity to shoot 200 bullets a minute, are not needed for hunting or home protection. No one is trying to take away all guns.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Obamacare protects preexisting conditions &amp; the ability to keep kids on plan until age 26. The Insurance Companies are making substantial profits with inflated CEO salaries. They have used the ACA as an excuse to raise premiums to try to end it - Trump’s plan when Congress failed
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP 90% of planned Parenthood was providing Education, Mammograms, Pap Smears &amp; Birth Control to women who could not afford it. So what happens when it is defunded &amp; these woman can’t afford birth control?
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP And you don’t think the GOP is? They are also funded by Russia through the NRA. He did not self fund his campaign. He actively took funds. He is doing it now. He sent emails out before &amp; after his speech to “fund the wall” &amp; at the bottom it showed it was for his campaign - shady
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Haha.... I know more about that than you think.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Carr did not come out and say that it was absolutely false. MSNBC commentators said that if this is true, then impeachment is on the table. Don Jr. already lied to Congress. I wonder who advised him on that.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I don’t call names-just state facts. Trump is so corrupt that no one would do business with him, not even the banks. The Russians would not either until he decided to run. He only did this to try to get a raise from NBC when he found out they were paying a woman more on The Voice
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The Democrats have a platform that advocates for the middle status. We care about healthcare, gun regulation, programs that help the sick &amp; the poor, gas prices, maintaining good relationships with our allies, staying out of war..... &amp; the equal rights of the American people.
@rusty_parker @MitziRuth72 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Thank you. I am not a far lefter. I am actually more of a conservative.

As rich as Texas is, they would have already built a wall in areas it was needed. Many there like the open borders as they travel to communities back &amp; forth.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The wall hasn’t been done for decades due to geographic, financial, political, logistics...etc. It would take 16 yrs to build &amp; after yrs of court battles with ranchers who would not allow it to be built on their property. Remember, Mexico was going to pay &amp; put it on their side.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Illegals should not be here without permission / VISA. Everyone agrees with that. There are some situations like The Dreamers that do need pathways to citizenship. The debate is the best way to secure the border, not “my way or the highway”, which is the current Trump agenda.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I don’t think you can speak for them. You have to watch people’s actions. There are good people in both parties. The support for a man who turns his back on the American people, and who only looks out for things that benefit his financial situation, is mind boggling.
@HellBoundReaper He did. He was advised against it, but there was someone he went to meet with on his own accord.
@GodInAllThings @timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP You actually believe that?...,Haha....that Trump was appointed by God? I guess Hitler was too. The bible also talks about our leaders &amp; how they have standards -not evil. Have you read Revelation? Believe me, there is a lot of us praying about this current administration.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I am definitely not affiliated with either one of these parties.
@timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Being born in a dangerous impoverished nation is not reaping what you sew. It is the circumstances of their life. The refugees should not be punished for that. We have compassion for the ones in need and provide assistance to them.
@timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Holding someone accountable for immoral unethical acts is not judging. It is the same thing as holding your child accountable for an action speaking to them about it &amp; providing discipline. Stating a fact about a man who makes prejudicial comments &amp; separates women &amp; kids - fact
@HellBoundReaper He wasn’t sent. He was traveling to his other embassies and decided to add this last minute.
@Nana17immer @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Most all of the Congressman traveled over the holidays. Jared and Invanka are in Florida right now using a military plane. Trump went to Iraq during this shutdown. The buck lies with Trump &amp; McConnell. They are the the ones acting poorly.
@Nana17immer @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Puerto Rico is not a luxurious vacation. right now. This was a Democratic forum that had been planned for months, so they could formulate their agendas &amp; upcoming plans. It had been planned for months. It would have been hard for the people in Puerto Rico economically to back out
@cantmakeitup77 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP My point exactly. The GOP wants to use the anti-abortion platform, but a large majority of them are actually for abortion being legal. Their lack of strict regulations prove that.
@cantmakeitup77 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP It is legal, but the GOP could put strict regulations on it &amp; they don’t. Most people don’t know their pregnant &amp; can’t get an abortion done until after 12 weeks. If they limited it to women less than 12 weeks pregnanct, it would stop over 75% of all abortions. Why haven’t they?
@DebbieClarke @cantmakeitup77 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Sounds about right.
@LoyalAmerican17 @MikeHol62372156 @realDonaldTrump These people aren’t breaking the law. They are coming to our border offices &amp; asking for refugee status &amp; then they are being detained &amp; separated from their children. It is legal to ask for refugee status. Trump has closed multiple border offices, now causing a pile-up.
@LoyalAmerican17 @MikeHol62372156 @realDonaldTrump Obamacare has not been a failure - a GOP lie &amp; scare tactic. It is has been very successful and it protects the middle class with insurance companies holding them accountable to protection of pre-existing conditions &amp; allowing people to keep their kids on their insurance until 26
@LoyalAmerican17 @MikeHol62372156 @realDonaldTrump This is a no longer a state issue. It requires federal regulation. The decision makers in the Flint crisis were ALL Republican. The Democrats in the House are now starting inquiries into this atrocity.
@LoyalAmerican17 @MikeHol62372156 @realDonaldTrump Nothing is getting accomplished, except for the deregulation of everything so companies can make more money - polluting our environment, loss of employee rights, the salary disparities causing failing of the middle class to obtain the American dream, increasing the deficit...etc
@LoyalAmerican17 @MikeHol62372156 @realDonaldTrump What would Jesus do?
@dneedham560 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Then you probably should be scared of the GOP and their support for Russia and their oligarchs. The GOP voted to release the sanctions and it all has to do with money. This will make them more powerful and suppress more nations with their power.
@SSalvucci @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Very mean thing to say - kinda like calling someone a fool. Turning your backs on refugees, defunding programs to help the poor and sick and repeatedly trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act are the platform of the GOP. Christians should hold the leaders accountable.
@timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Yes, everyone is the same at the foot of the cross; no one is elevated. That is not even the issue in this conversation. The issue is the GOP and their support for a President that is unethical and immoral with no accountability.... So the Jews should have embraced Hitler... ????
@timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Christians have to hold people accountable for atrocious acts. It is not judging. Do you know who Paul is? Do you know why John the Baptist was beheaded? ..... because he pointed out the sins of Herod and his immoral acts with his half-brother’s wife?
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP ... and fight for the right to look after the homeless, poor, starving, sick.... I don’t know how the GOP can turn their back on refugees. They did not even provide help to the immigrants who are here on this earth - no humanitarian support - not even water.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP These babies get to enter through the narrow gate. Jesus will judge these mothers. Abortion is the law of the land. We have no decision making power on this. The GOP could have placed strict limitations on this. They did not. The GOP is not anti-abortion. Actions speak louder.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Jesus cares about souls, not the flesh. He is the one who will judge, not you. One day of abuse to an unwanted child is horrific. I hate abortion, but I know these babies get to go to heaven, and not have to come here, and suffer for being unwanted. Heaven is a blessing.
@Ruben37889962 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP The GOP does support abortion. They say they are against it, but they do nothing about it when they are in power. They use it as a platform so they can push their agendas, and they have nothing about it but talk. They are supported and rule according to the money from Lobbyists.
@timetalks2 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP Have you heard of The Great Commission? Do you understand that we might be the way that leads another to Christ, so they can be saved?
@HellBoundReaper We need to get rid of Lobbyists and that would stop some of this corruption.
@HellBoundReaper @aandasharkey He was paid
@HellBoundReaper Usually not on tv
@HellBoundReaper I see that a a lot. Men do it too.
@HellBoundReaper I think a lot of people liked his Apprentice show and his model wife and he is charismatic as well. But these things don’t necessarily qualify you as the President.
@HellBoundReaper Not true. That embassy was closed.
@HellBoundReaper It still exists where I live.
@HellBoundReaper There is no draft. He signed up. Fortunately the VA has programs for this to help these vets.
@HellBoundReaper It is protection from people who care more about profit then quality. Do you really want people to be able contaminate our clean water with fertilizer and animal waste, or to sell medications that are toxic over time, or to sell tainted Romaine Lettuce - all things regulated
@HellBoundReaper @aandasharkey So not true.... Lies from Fox News
@HellBoundReaper Men crying. I don’t see fabrication there. I know no men that would cry on national news, because the media wants him to.
@HellBoundReaper They probably don’t get paid as much and no one wants to hire someone for a week to whatever with no idea when this shutdown will end.
@HellBoundReaper A lie from Fox News
@HellBoundReaper You watch too much Fox News.... A lot of what the MSM say is true and factual, but Fox spins it like he is a victim and everything is false. But at this point everything is coming out that validates the reporting. He has leakers in the WH trying to hold him accountable.
@HellBoundReaper Mine was not. Manipulation by a woman is a way to get their way and make the man think it was his idea.... lol
@HellBoundReaper It is difficult to fathom how people could flock to this man who was immoral, unethical, narcissistic, racist and a bully. She should have never said that. I think her statement stemmed more from the fact that if someone could embrace this hateful behavior then they condone it.
@HellBoundReaper The Diplomat was wrong to be there. He did not have permission to be there.
@HellBoundReaper That is because they are meticulous and care about each other. They aren’t sending their food across the country for profit.
@HellBoundReaper Because our military protects Americans - Trump Just needs to go - voted out, impeached, resigns...... He puts our country at risk. He has placed his connection with Russia over our relationship with our allies. We have lost their respect.
@HellBoundReaper They don’t want to be Socialists. These programs were started under both parties. We do need regulatory agencies to protect Americans. There are many good caring people that work for these organizations. History has shown that Americans are at risk with less government oversight.
@HellBoundReaper @aandasharkey It is wrong to steal emails from the DNC and expose them. It is no different from Watergate - it was just done via internet. He was paid by Russia to send those emails, not because he wanted to expose anyone. It sounds to me that you rely on Fox News for your facts.
@HellBoundReaper The shutdown is wrong. Unfortunately most people live paycheck to paycheck. It is illegal for most federal workers to strike so they are supposed to go to work, not knowing when they will get paid. If you watch the news, you see desperate people with kids crying in despair.
@HellBoundReaper The media don’t like him, but he did everything for their ratings. It was a big mistake for him to go after the media on the campaign trail. He used them for publicity and then he berated them and put them at risk at his rallies.
@HellBoundReaper I agree. Living in the South in a red state, it was one of the main reasons men would not vote for her - because she was a woman. It turned men off. It does take a village to raise kids - that is true. A lot of parents are not good parents. She should not have said “deplorables”
@HellBoundReaper That Embassy was closed due to the instability in that region. That Diplomat was not supposed to be there, and he came &amp; showed himself in public &amp; placed everyone at risk. The private contractors volunteered to help - not their job. There was no support close to provide help.
@HellBoundReaper If the USDA was not an entity, many Americans would die from improper food handling and management. I have learned one thing. Alot of Americans don’t care &amp; would put other Americans at risk without strict regulation.
@HellBoundReaper @aandasharkey Hillary did care, but she didn’t present herself well. No Special Council was appointed for Hillary because there was no criminal behavior. There is a reason Mueller was appointed.
@HellBoundReaper A shotgun or a 45 mm with hollow point bullets are both excellent protection. The only time an AR-15 would be needed is if you are in the Grizzly Maze.... lol
@HellBoundReaper It is all Socialistic &amp; Regulated by the US government &amp; it needs to be - TSA, Air Traffic Controllers, FBI, CIA, Police, Firefighters, FDA, DEA, USDA.... etc - Most Americans cannot protect themselves and privatization leads to corruption.
@HellBoundReaper @aandasharkey Hillary has already been cleared of everything. It was all trumped up crap from the GOP to get people to think she was corrupt. Trump projects on everything. It is was narcissists do. He was the one doing corrupt illegal things on his campaign trail &amp; deflecting from himself.
@HellBoundReaper The Democrats aren’t fighting. They voted to reopen the government. The GOP is refusing to vote on it. Trump could end this now, and he won’t. He is the one that is behind all of this &amp; acting like a want to be Dictator - very dangerous.
@HellBoundReaper I don’t see the Democrats using scare tactics. This is the foundation of the GOP &amp; Fox News, especially when they say that the Democrats wang to cut Medicare (total lie) and they scare these elderly people into thinking they care &amp; that Medicare is at risk - not true.
@HellBoundReaper I know Hillary personally. She is actually a really smart &amp; she would have been an excellent President. She did many wonderful things when she was in Arkansas as the Governor’s wife. I don’t think she presented herself well when campaigning &amp; I don’t think many men were willing
@HellBoundReaper If you watched 13 hours (the true story from the guys on the ground there), you would have seen that Benghazi was not her fault. I don’t like how she handled it at our base w the families. Russia is not our ally. It is run by the KGB.  They want to take over as much as possible.
@HellBoundReaper Lol.... Funny.... Trump has been a bully all of his life... the demeaning comments he made on the campaign trail about different races, the disabled, the people running against him.... etc.... Big Bully..... I have no idea why he won the nomination. He is not Presidential.
@HellBoundReaper The Constitution was written when the US had no formal type military or police protection. No one wants to take away guns, just the military style guns. I live in the South. We don’t go out in the woods without a gun usually. Must of us hunt &amp; have them for safety in the home.
@HellBoundReaper True, and some of us are caught up in situations where we need help and it needs to be there when that happens. The GOP is for getting rid of all programs including regulations that protect us. What would happen if the US stopped regulating the TSA, the post office, the police..
@HellBoundReaper Not true, the Democrats want the shut down to end. They just won’t budge on his temper tantrum, especially since his budget only asked for 1.6 million and this is what they gave him and then when the Democrats took power in the house, he changed his mind and started this conflict
@HellBoundReaper His campaign promise was Mexico would pay for the wall. He didn’t even want it. His campaign advisors came up with it as his campaign issue, since he built things, and they wanted him to campaign on building something. He trumped up the crisis as a scare tactic.
@HellBoundReaper Military type weapons with Bump Stocks that can shoot 200 bullets a minute are not needed for hunting or home protection. These have been used in mass shootings of people. The 1st bill sent to the floor when Trump became POTUS was making it easier for the mentally ill to purchase
@HellBoundReaper Trump is the one dividing the people. A national address is about unity, not division. It was a campaign speech &amp; he sent emails to his voters asking for money to be donated for the wall, except at the bottom of the email it said it was for the Trump Pence Campaign. Very Shafty.
@HellBoundReaper He has been voted the most liked man in America like the past 7 years. If he had let the banks crash, then it would have destroyed the economy in America. Wars costs money. Bush is the one that put us trillions of dollars in debt because of Iraq.
@HellBoundReaper Exactly, it is not the kids fault. And you should care that they are sending them back to their countries when they are adults &amp; they don’t know the language &amp; they are targeted. They rip them from their spouses &amp; children. They need a pathway to citizenship. Trump took this away
@HellBoundReaper We just care about all people &amp; humanity. Jesus does not feel any of us are better than anyone else. He loves us all the same. He came &amp; preached to take care of the helpless, the widows, the sick, the poor....we should have given humanitarian relief to these families in Mexico.
@HellBoundReaper I am sorry that happened to you.
@HellBoundReaper If the Democrats give in to his temper tantrum so he can get his way, then he will do this every 3 months for something else and keep the government shut down again. It is a bad precedent to start. Elections have consequences. This is one of them.
@HellBoundReaper You really think the Democrats are going to fund his campaign promise when he could not do it. Democrats gave him some funding. Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall. It was supposed to be built on their land, not ours. Many ranchers won’t allow their property to be taken.
@HellBoundReaper If you care about Americans and their freedoms and rights, then you should be a Democrat.
@HellBoundReaper Are you kidding? There was no debt with Clinton. Bush started it with his Iraq War &amp; the economy was crashing. Obama inherited the worst crisis &amp; he brought us out of it. He saved this country at a time that Bush had let gas &amp; milk get to $4.00 a gallon &amp; the banks were crashing.
@HellBoundReaper Exactly. What Trump is deflecting? The Democrats won’t budge unless he finally compromises for DACA and The Dreamers. Sending adults back to their countries when they have been here since small children is cruel. There needs to be a pathway to citizenship.
@HellBoundReaper Lol. Most Democrats I know are not rich. But they are educated, follow politics and what is actually going on and they tend to live in urban areas. The Affordable Care Act is taking care of the strapped middle class and the poor. They care about people’s rights.
@HellBoundReaper It is the bill to reopen and fund the government. The House has approved it and McConnell won’t send it to the Senate floor for a vote.
@HellBoundReaper You don’t take breastfeeding babies from their mothers and not even record any names or where each is sent. They have no idea what the name of the mother is or where they are at. These people had a right to ask for refugee status. Trump closed most of these border offices.
@HellBoundReaper Trump took the blame &amp; he said he was proud to do it. You can’t demand your way like this &amp; think people will negotiate. No one if for illegals. They are for following the law. They are allowed to ask for refugee status. Most are deported, but at least they weren’t stacking up.
@HellBoundReaper Mitch McConnell is the Problem. He is not doing his job. He is acting like the Senate is part of the Executive Branch, by not bringing the House bill to the floor for a vote. It is wrong wrong wrong. Enough GOP will vote for it, because they are running for re-election in 2020.
@HellBoundReaper ICE needs oversight. What they have been doing separating children from their parents and not even documenting information for tracking is incomprehensible.
@HellBoundReaper The government needs oversight. It is important that the Democrats won the House. It is important that no party has complete control. Trump is just throwing a fit, because he wants to be a Dictator. Now we have trillion dollars in debt due to the GOP tax bill for the rich.
@HellBoundReaper Voter Fraud as you say was a scare tactic by Trump. It was investigated and found to be erroneous. Voter Suppression, in regards to Democratic voters, is an issue. The GOP is notorious for manipulating this. I used to be a Republican. I am now proud to be a Democrat.
@HellBoundReaper They can climb a wall, tunnel under it, destroy areas of it, knock it down...etc. A wall should be negotiated through the states. There are many areas separated by rivers and cliffs. It has not be sustainable. Many of these communities on each side are fluent with each other.
@HellBoundReaper Nancy has to be a Bully to stand up to Trump, who is a life long Bully. He is also an immoral, unethical, prejudicial, lying, demeaning, unpresidential, dangerous and unstable man. And the Democrats are not about fulfilling his ridiculous campaign promises.
@HellBoundReaper Remember “Mexico will pay for the wall”. Trump said he would shutdown the government if he did not get his way even though he initially only requested  the 1.6 million Democrat’s voted for, then he changed his mind because he did not want to appear weak by Rush Limbaugh.
@HellBoundReaper Considering the American people actually voted for Hillary over Trump by 3 million votes, it is not what the majority of the American people wanted. The electoral college has been manipulated by the GOP winning states they did not earn by pure votes.
@HellBoundReaper The GOP had control for 2 years and they did not have the support in their party to pass the wall funding. The wall would cost over 75 billion, take over 16 years to build and the Texas landowners will tie up any wall being built on their property for years.

@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @VP I agree. I do believe you need to consider changing your political party away from the GOP. They are apathetic to the needs of the helpless, poor, widows, sick.... the people that Jesus told us to take care of. They only care about money &amp; deregulating everything to get richer.

@thehill You had 2 years to get votes for the funding of this wall. The GOP didn’t want it, so don’t blame the Dems. Stop the government shut-down. Don’t ask the Dems to fund a wall to fulfill Trump’s campaign promises when we are over a trillion dollars in debt now due to your tax bill.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I never said that. There should be due process.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein How are you supposed to identify these “dangerous” people ??? Even if a Psychiatrist is treating them for a severe mental health issue, there is no regulation in place for mandatory reporting to keep them from purchasing any type of gun or bullets?
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein You don’t know who is dangerous most of the time. The Sandy Hook killer was under Psychiatric care, but I don’t think the Las Vegas shooter was.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein They are proposing a bill right now on Bump Stocks and I think it has a great possibility of passing with bi-partisan support.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein My feelings of disgust for you is your lack of empathy for the victims and families of the mass shootings by the obviously mentally ill. A stable person would not kill like this. Restrictions will not get them voted out, but re-elected. Many people are sick of gun violence.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I have no desire to own an AR-15 or own a Bump Stock- not necessary or needed. I am good with restricting the purchase by others for the greater good. Since you can’t restrict the mentally ill by your interpretation of the 5th amendment from purchasing these, then laws necessary.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Congress will probably decide it will not be anyone’s right to purchase a Bump Stock. You can thank the Las Vegas shooter for that, not be pissed at me.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I am not sacrificing my right to own a firearm. We have to ask all patients that enter my hospital if there is a gun in the house. There is a reason for this &amp; guns are easy access to harm. I have no ability to take any perceived rights away from others. That is up to Congress.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I don’t hate any amnendments. You need to understand that a Mental Health facility usually only keeps someone inpatient for 72 hours due to insurance/space &amp; then they get ongoing outpatient treatment. Their issues are not resolved at discharge, and many are still at risk.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein It is just a sacrifice needed to be in place, so these malicious people do not have access &amp; cannot do what happened in Las Vegas. Like I stated before, it is not something needed for self protection or hunting. It’s purpose is to shoot/kill as many people as possible quickly.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein A mandatory reporting system by Medical Doctors treating patients known to be at risk should be implemented. Especially in cases where violence towards others has been documented. The Sandy Hook killer was under long term Psychiatric care.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Who are you protecting yourself from? A 45 mm handgun with a hollow point bullet pretty much forwards you the protection you need.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Your right to own a Bump Stock is not more important than another person’s right to live. Even though you would not use this for harm, others would. This was used in Las Vegas to kill 58 people and injure 500 more - many of these were head shots with lifelong disability.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I don’t know where you live, but here our police actually do protect us.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein So you think allowing Mentally Ill people to buy guns and bullets is O.K. ??????
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein That’s a ridiculous thing to say. No one wants to take away handguns or hunting rifles. It is our constitutional right to own these. Being willing to regulate gun ownership in order to protect Americans is warranted and past due. Think of Sandy Hook, Parkland, Las Vegas...
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Yes, they are the problem, when the mentally ill can obtain firearms &amp; felons can still buy bullets to place in stolen guns. Guns should be owned by lawful citizens &amp; Bump Stocks should be illegal. I am sure you are very responsible, but there are many people that are not.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein The population has increased &amp; mental illness is rampant. Back in the 1890s, there was not a U.S. military like we have now to protect us &amp; people lived many times unprotected miles apart from their neighbors without policing. Times have changed and the laws need to reflect this.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I never said people should not be able to purchase a gun, but there needs to be tighter regulations in place.
@Jamisen @cook333p @SenFeinstein Lol... I live in the South... thus I know many hunters. They don’t use an AR-15 with large magazines. They aren’t trying to annihilate all wildlife. Guns are important here when in the woods for safety - something people in concrete world’s don’t understand.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein 100 people are killed daily by guns.	135 children/teenagers are shot weekly. 135,000 students have survived a mass school shooting. 	1.8 million guns were stolen in the past decade. I believe in guns for protection/hunting. Some regulation has to be done due to the irresponsible.
@Jamisen @cook333p @SenFeinstein Haha.... Not for the hard core hunters I know in the South - not necessary. They actually hunt for meat, not for sport.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein I can have an opinion and so can you. I praise Congress for initiating legislation on this. The 1st legislation initiated when Trump became President was to loosen the restrictions on the mentally ill being able to buy a firearm. Do you actually think this was a good decision?
@cook333p @SenFeinstein Really.... Because my friends &amp; the local farmers I know use hunting rifles and are able to put down feral hogs easily, but they can shoot accurately.
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Military type assault rifles with Bump Stocks are definitely not needed for personal protection or for hunting, unless you are in the Grizzly Maze or wanting to be David Koresh. Americans have proven that they allow others access, including their children &amp; the mentally ill.
@ChuckVipperman @Jamisen @SenFeinstein I differentiate between assault type rifles for our military equipped with Bump Stocks and the type of guns used for hunting and personal protection that should be legal per our constitution. You may say I am “brainless”, but I consider you heartless.
@DoctorDrMrMD @SenFeinstein Projection
@Jamisen @SenFeinstein Tell that to the families of the Las Vegas shooting and why are Bump Stocks still legal for the American citizen to purchase. This should only be available for our military. Period.

@lovethemangels @Mizzo07R @DellabellaRis @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Yes, things have to be done in order.
