@AprilDRyan @HillaryClinton To Pander is defined as to provide gratification for others' desires. To call @realDonaldTrump a racist and Hillary Clinton a friend of black people is just as outlandish as it is false.

@rolandsmartin Roland, whats your email? id like to send you an interview request
@SAKimFoxx @CookCountySAO It is also your job to be neutral and fair in your pursuit, any thing else is prosecutorial misconduct in its greatest form.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump You have a lot of nerve to talk "facts" when you dont talk facts yourself, Roland.
@rolandsmartin @1future @rkelly And you know that because you are psychic or because you were there and witnessed the alleged incidents?
@rolandsmartin @1future @rkelly He is absolutely correct. A multitude of accusations is not indicative of guilt. He has the right to due process  just like anyone else. Roland aint as pro black and pro right and wrong as he pretends. Its not cool to be a bandwagon rider.

@heatherhhayes @thatboy19 @stacyfrancis and we both just shared our opinions.
@0to100t @stacyfrancis in Speaking about Ms. Francis I stand by the previous comment.
@heatherhhayes @stacyfrancis @IAmChanteMoore both ladies have lives in the public eye. Not every conversation is known to everyone.
@heatherhhayes @thatboy19 @stacyfrancis I think she was extremely positive ! And ratings were good so apparently viewers did as well!
@heatherhhayes @stacyfrancis I didn't hear it so It would be premature for me to speak on it specifically
@0to100t @stacyfrancis with all due respect, how do you explain why she is on the show and like me you are watching at home?
@heatherhhayes @stacyfrancis if you heard her speak about a topic it was because she was involved in a mutually engaged conversation.
@thatboy19 @stacyfrancis @heatherhhayes everyone is free to their opinions. However Ms. Francis rightfully earned her spot on that show.
why are "the cards" so stacked against @IAmChanteMoore on this show. What the hell is wrong! I just don't get it. #RBDivasLA
@heatherhhayes @stacyfrancis opinions about what was seen on the show are based off of what the production team edited and chose to show
RT @stacyfrancis: Special shout out to @tvonetv The President Brad and all the staff! I love you all!! Thank you!! #RBDivasLA
@heatherhhayes @stacyfrancis the opinions of a few people can in no way be a fair representation of Ms. Francis' talent and true character.
