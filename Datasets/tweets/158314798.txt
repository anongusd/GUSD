I'm supporting the incredible work of the @AlbertKennedyTr with #lgbt youth. Bid on my unique @adidas  #samba trainers from the 3rd of July. Go to https://t.co/vUvgA5ceWG https://t.co/6CMnPdYpju
Encouraging people to feel part of communities bigger than just themselves.	Everybody deserves to have pride in who they are and what they do, at all times! Thats why I wanted my design to be portable, so you can express yourself anywhere at any time!
I designed these trainers to replicate a portable recording studio. For me music is such an important form of expression, not only does it encourage us artists to celebrate our individuality and diversity, it’s also a great way to send out a message of love and support https://t.co/TA5oJ7fAId
Cheryl and I are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make. We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.
Just thoughts 💭.... when I auditioned for X factor 10 years ago I had a hole in my George Asda shoes, borrowed Armandi jeans from a friend just a 14 year old boy with big dreams ... crazy what ten years can do... thank you 🙏🏼

@tv3elaine Women have amazing almost superhuman powers at this the way they connect with a child is incredible. I just had to find things that helped me benefit and become a part of this beautiful relationship and I think a lot of dads find their feet the same way.

@AndySamuels I feel amazing
I'm just here to make people smile  I kinda consider it my job role
I'm sorry to those I offended really I am but there's no need for some of the things I'm being called
Lol this is so insane the more I read I'm like wtf have u ever said something in the wrong way I'm sure every person here has lol
Crap end to a good day
And all some people want to concentrate on was a throw away statement about a song that I love
So annoying trying your hardest to make people happy in a show and you think about all the notes u tried to hit higher or a little sweeter
I am in no way shape or form homophobic that's a ridicules thing to say and I'm not here to offend people so take it as you will
lol think some people take things to literal these days not gunna comment on it anymore you guys know what I meant it was meant in general

One time id like to be able to see New York without being followed chased and cornered like an animal until other people get what they want
Just because u don't feel like taking a picture because there's paparazzi chasing you and you want to get your family and friends home safe
Why is it that in New York people think it's ok to swear and shout horrible things at you in the street...

Hi everyone go see our songwriter Jamie Scott's 1st live show in the 23rd of March tickets and info here https://t.co/0cH2inrFWx
Pick ur balls up off the floor and get on with it instead of taking advantage of every word said and twisting it for your own gain
Can't wait for the call tomorrow where I get told of for cussing had to be said like I said before much worse has happened In the world
Sick of all this bull il be back again when the freedom of speech law is back and people don't believe to much into the bulls#!t they read
All those tweets are aimed at journalists and bloggers not fans
@chlxealison I'm talking journalists
@tyleroakley that changes everything you obviously wernt a fan I said nothing I liked a show that was on my tv nothing about you or whatever
I just watched a show and I liked it as most people do stop sitting in my twitter and do your research #lazyjournos
Look at this shit I never said any if that write about something real for once there's plenty of issues In the world http://t.co/FDsqtyr5Ht
And write about things that actually matter not what im gunna have for dinner tomorrow or who I'm a fan if real stories
And I know I'm playing into your hands writing these tweets but I'm sick of stupid stories it's time you all grow up
I can't do anything without being judged u try that and write about it
What I gotta do to please you bastards I'm a 20 year old just living life as you did when u where twenty but in extraordinary circumstances
Oh my god can someone literally not be a fan if a show without bring labeled WTf I bought dinner the other day it made a news story
Im off ! Love you all :)
@STYLATORARMY it never is thats why i sit here and reply to as many of you as possible :)
@1DSlovakia_ yesss love harry potter , goblet of fire is the best one :)
@sheloveshazza never forget your friends are there for you, even if you only have 2 like i did , youll be ok as long as you have them  :)
@LOHANTHONY not right when on a date but damn good with a spag bol
@DavidLevitz also i was severely bullied all through school , i would never wish that feeling on anyone
@DavidLevitz again i just like the show and i love when families stick together, i havent said i agree with all that theyve ever said

@redvelvet cheesecake yes! Loveeee it
@hsmharry i do when im being called something im not , people can love who they want , its none of my business
@UnitedUnderZayn always assuming , makes twitter no fun and no point
Being a fan of someones show and the way they still hold a family together doesnt mean i am ok with all they say.
@williebosshog huge love to you/your family huge respect for your business prosperities and the family values you still all behold. big fan
Worse things have happened, I'm sure we'll be fine ;)
It was a stupid and irresponsible thing to do. I am sorry, and do not endorse any fans trying to repeat this, as it is extremely dangerous.
You may have seen a photo of me today taken on top of a building. I regret being there and having a photo taken.
Sorry if I've been rude to anyone but I've come to realise if I take one picture more people keep coming everyday xxx hope everyone's good
I'd just like to be able to walk outside as everyone does and enjoy time with my friends, not feel bad for not wanting to take a picture
I know my friends have tweeted a lot of pictures of my house the past few days but can people please stop coming and waiting outside
Happy birthday @Laurastanway have a good one

We couldn't give a fuck what any documentary says there dramatised for entertainment and full of bullshit anyway we all know...
Just so all of you know we love you guys and we know how dedicated you are and tbh we can't believe it that you gus spend all you time on us
Hearing some horrible things... Really hope this isn't true
