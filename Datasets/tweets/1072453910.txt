#farmbill:  Next steps for me:  work the Senate side to put in more $$ for SNAP.  Our country is too great to allow children to go hungry.
#farmbill: Long day. Votes on farm bill are bipartisan.  D's &amp; R's on each side. Final vote: 36 ayes, 10 nays. We have a farm bill.
#farmbill: Learned a lot abt a lot of things 2nite. State's rights. California fights. Trees. Fish. Fowl. Eggs. Organic. Olive oil. SNAP.
#farmbill: Current topic: Catfish. USDA vs FDA. Vietnamese catfish allegedly have tested positive for 38 chemicals. Red snapper vs tilapia?
#farmbill: remember the tie vote? A mbr back on the dais forges a compromise. Liability ins raised to $1.25mil. Congrats 2 @RepMikeMcIntyre!
#farmbill: amendment raising farm liability limit from $1mil to $1.5mil @ no cost 2 govt failed on tie vote. 22-22. Only tie vote so far.
#Farmbill: "Organic" amendment adopted w/ bipartisan 29 yeas to 17 yeas. Congrats to @RepSchrader on his excellent presentation &amp; success.
#farmbill: Still here. Great bipartisan conversation abt "organic"- defining it as a commodity.  D's &amp; R's on both sides.
RT @TexansVsHunger: .@RepPeteGallego: "Kids should never be a casualty" of a conversation on SNAP cuts. #farmbill
#farmbill: Spirited back &amp; forth as cmte talks abt SNAP. 1st really touchy issue. Religion, saving $$, kids, vets. All part of conversation.
#farmbill: The day's biggest challenge. $20.5 billion cut 2 SNAP program. Proud 2 join @RepMcGovern &amp; @RepFilemonVela in effort 2 save SNAP.
#farmbill: Amendment to address issue of food deserts just adopted by 2 votes.  Access 2 healthy food is vital. Congrats to @RepMarciaFudge!
#farmbill: Dairy issue settled. 20 D's voted w/ Chair &amp; ranking mbr 2  implement new way 2 stabilize milk prices. 4 years of work 4 them.
Farm bill: 2nd amendment is a fight abt dairy. Not a partisan fight-chair &amp; ranking mbr on same side. Seems to be more of an industry fight.
Farm bill:1st amendment, a bloc amndmnt w/ both D &amp; R ideas, adopted unanimously.  Bipartisan effort of chair,the ranking mbr &amp; the cmte.
