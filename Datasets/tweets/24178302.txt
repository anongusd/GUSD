NAMI is proud to stand with partners in filing a lawsuit to invalidate the administration’s short-term, limited-duration insurance rule. @latimes https://t.co/dHivFZA6nA
We've joined this suit b/c we oppose rolling back of the clock to a time when life-saving mental health treatment was limited/unavailable. Our nation's health includes mental health. It is imperative to retain mental health parity and access to essential mental health benefits.
For the past 20 years, NAMI has fought for parity—the fundamental tenant that mental health care is just as important as physical health care. We have steadily made progress on this issue in both the hearts and minds of the country and its policies.
In addition, these plans are likely to attract younger and healthier individuals, many of whom will be left without the coverage they need in a mental health crisis or if they develop a mental health condition.
The federal STLD rule deals a blow to mental health parity, as plans are permitted to:	- Deny coverage for any pre-existing condition like mental illness	- Charge higher premiums for people w/ history of mental illness	- Not cover mental health &amp; substance use disorder treatment
NAMI joins a lawsuit to overturn the Administration’s recently-issued rule that allows for the expansion of short-term, limited-duration insurance plans. These plans are are not required to cover pre-existing conditions nor mental health services. https://t.co/RnMxYHGzRn

A5. Want to eliminate disparity? 	• Follow national standards	• Train staff to be culturally competent 	• Develop culture-specific education tools	• Establish and engage community partners	• Continue conversations and research	#SaludTues
A5. Asian American/Pacific Islander communities rarely acknowledge mental illness because of:	• the model minority myth – expectation to be prosperous, well-educated and successful	• lack of validation from older generations who know "real hardship"	#SaludTues
A5. Stigma and rejection can impact whether or not these communities seek care. Latinos view mental illness as potentially very socially damaging; African Americans consider mental illness as private family business that shouldn’t be dealt with publicly. #CureStigma #SaludTues
A5. For example, Latino and Asian American patients are likely to express psychological distress in the form of physical complaints, like dizziness and tiredness. The health provider needs to probe the patient to truly understand the patient’s emotional state. #SaludTues
A5. In multicultural communities, patients are more likely to describe non-biomedical interpretations of mental illness symptoms—meaning they focus more on spirituality, moral character and social explanations for mental illness. #SaludTues

A4. 🚨 Be sure to save this helpful cheat sheet so you’re prepared to look for a culturally competent provider for yourself or a loved one 🚨 ➡️ (https://t.co/sQra6xWtJc)	#SaludTues
A4. Can't find a culturally competent provider?	• Learn about your condition and how it affects people from your culture or community. 	• Look around the provider’s office for signs of inclusion. Who works there? Does the waiting room have info for your community?	#SaludTues
A4. There are other things you can do if you can’t find a culturally competent provider:  	• Tell the provider about traditions, values and beliefs that are important to you.	• Tell the provider what role you want your family to play in your treatment. 	#SaludTues
A4. Additional questions to ask providers:	• "Are you or members of your staff bilingual?"	• "How would you include aspects of my cultural identity, such as	age, faith, gender identity or sexual orientation, in my care?"	#SaludTues
A4. More questions to ask providers when seeking #MinorityMentalHealth care:	• "Do you have experience treating people from my background?"	• "Have you had cultural competence training?"	#SaludTues
A4. Questions to ask providers: 	• "Are you familiar with my community’s beliefs, values and attitudes toward mental health?"	• "If not, are you willing to learn about my cultural background and respect my perspective?"	#SaludTues
A4. How to research providers:	• Contact providers/agencies who serve your cultural background	• Ask trusted friends and family for recommendations	• Ask for referrals from cultural organizations in your community	• Check with your health insurance for providers	#SaludTues
A4. A culturally competent provider includes cultural beliefs, values, practices and attitudes in your care to meet your unique needs. Read further for some tips for finding a culturally competent provider... #SaludTues
A4. Finding culturally competent providers is important because they understand the essential role that culture plays in life and health, and are equipped to work effectively with different cultural groups. #SaludTues

A3: For the Hispanic and Latino communities in particular, the strong sense of masculine pride, also known as "machismo," can prevent individuals from these communities from asking for help. #SaludTues
A3: Such adversities are experienced across many cultures within diverse communities. This can include anti-LGBT sentiment, racism, oppression, discrimination and the need to flee home countries in search of refuge or asylum. #SaludTues
A3: These are all in addition to the usual road blocks. Many cultures also view #mentalhealth treatment as a luxury, considering symptoms a “phase” that will eventually pass. These perceptions of mental illness can further isolate individuals who desperately need help. #SaludTues
A3: When trying to accesses treatment, diverse communities typically contend with:	• language barriers	• a culturally insensitive system	• racism, bias and discrimination in treatment settings	• lower quality care	• lower chance of health care coverage	• stigma	#SaludTues
A3: There are many factors and misconceptions that impact mental health within diverse communities. Culture, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation can make access to mental health treatment much more difficult. #SaludTues (https://t.co/r9f81VxWBg) (SEE THREAD) https://t.co/zm7QKR7XnG

A6: There is also a responsible way to report on mass shootings. The media should NOT report that mental illness caused a shooting; rather, most people with a mental health condition are non-violent. #SOSChat | Here’s more info: https://t.co/oGfns4IQA7
A6: It’s time for journalists to address how they cover mental illness. The @AP created reporting guidelines on #mentalhealth five years ago. However, many journalists don’t know such guidelines exist. #SOSChat | Guidelines here: https://t.co/Na2EoS7dmr
A6: The media can be used to reduce mental illness stigma by being a voice in helping to break down stereotypes and barriers. This can be done by educating people on what it's like to live with mental illness and encourage all to seek help if they are struggling. #SOSChat
A6: The media is responsible for showing all faces of mental illness, including positive stories of people with mental illness. Such stories can include stories of recovery, support and education. They should spread awareness and spark helpful conversation. #SOSChat https://t.co/xCWTLSZBSS

RT @Howdy_Doughty: A5. The media shows us what mental conditions "look" like. Unfortunately, these representations are usually so off-base…
A5: For example, irresponsible reporting can perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes. There’s a misconception that all people with mental illness are violent. However, people with mental health conditions are more likely to be victims of violence. #SOSChat
A5: Also, there’s a correlation between what people think about mental illness and what they read about mental illness. If the media only covers stories or events from a negative perspective, then the public will only see it in a negative light. #SOSChat
A5: The media is influential &amp; essential in what we think about everything; they help shape public perceptions and opinions of things. If the media portrays #mentalillness in a stigmatizing way, it will perpetuate the stigma. #SOSChat https://t.co/rXIjckFRKN

A4: You can read personal stories, or share your own, to connect with others and understand that you are not alone. https://t.co/Qmhu0EVy2Q #SOSChat
A4: Whether you are a friend, family member, caregiver or medical professional, getting to know a person and treating them with kindness and empathy means far more than just knowing what they are going through. #SOSChat
A4: Second, it’s important to see the person, not the condition. 1 in 5 Americans live with a mental health condition and each of them has their own story, path and journey that says more about them than their diagnosis does. #SOSChat
A4: Understanding mental health isn't only about being able to identify symptoms and having a name for conditions, but dispelling false ideas about mental health conditions as well. #SOSChat
A4: Mental health conditions, or mental illnesses, are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character nor poor upbringing. Be sure to check out “In This Section” to learn more about these conditions and their symptoms 	https://t.co/8yMkGCcCc4 	#SOSChat
A4: The first step is to educate yourself &amp; others. Everyone knows a little about #mentalhealth conditions, but knowing the facts can help you educate others &amp; reject stigmatizing stereotypes. #SOSChat https://t.co/U47Yd1QGH9
@mdimuria @StampStigma This is a great idea! Have you planned events that you've found to be successful? We'd love to hear more. 		Also, have you heard about https://t.co/BVOPv2p2hi? We invite all to join a NAMIWalk near them. 		#SOSChat
@AskDrEarl Absolutely! We need to see the person, not the condition. #SOSChat
@EPICLongIsland @StampStigma Precisely! Our choice of words can make a huge difference. #SOSChat
This is so true. Thank you for highlighting this. Many people don't know  what the symptoms are. It's important to learn them so that you can  keep an eye out for yourself and those you care about. Here's a great way to start: https://t.co/r49LBekJ6i		#SOSChat https://t.co/BbEDV2lR2q
A3: Remember:	•When you hear someone using stigmatizing language, correct them.	•If you see someone using misleading stereotypes, educate them. 	•Never forget to see people for who they are, not for how they act during their darkest days.	https://t.co/F5YQ5NeMjl 	#SOSChat
A3: Every day brings new hope. Every day, we have an opportunity to help create broader understanding of #mentalhealth, overcome stereotypes &amp; break down barriers. We can all do a little bit more each day to eliminate stigma &amp; replace it with help &amp; hope. #SOSChat
A3: Instead, when you are referring to someone w/ a #mentalillness, use these:	•She has #bipolar disorder	•Person with #schizophrenia	•Person with bipolar disorder	•People with a mental illness/mental health condition	•Died by suicide	#SOSChat
A3: Do not use the following nor similar phrases: 	•She’s bipolar	•Schizophrenic	•Manic depressive	•The mentally ill	•Committed suicide 	#SOSChat
A3: Avoid labels, such as: 	•Challenged	•Crazy	•Demented	•Lunatic	•Normal/not normal	•Psycho/psychopath	•Schizo	•Special  	•Sufferer/victim	•Wacko	#SOSChat
A3: Everyone can play a role! Here are some helpful tips: 	• Use respectful language to talk about #mentalhealth conditions	• Challenge misconceptions when you see or hear them	• See the person, not the condition	• Offer support if you think someone is having trouble	#SOSChat
A3: Once you’ve taken the pledge, consider all the ways you can live #StigmaFree in your daily life:	• Be aware of the language you use	• Choose to be open	• Learn more about mental illness		#SOSChat
A3: There are ways to change this harmful status quo. One is by taking the #StigmaFree pledge: https://t.co/tUTKAvhsJk 		#SOSChat
A3: Their conditions worsen because they aren’t receiving the support &amp; care they need to recover. And too often people take their own lives because they aren’t told by anyone that they are not alone, they can recover &amp; there is hope. #SOSChat
A3: Individuals living with #mentalillness often internalize the stigma that exists in our culture, damaging hopes for recovery. Some don’t seek treatment from a mental health professional. #SOSChat https://t.co/24p1oUrzdO

A2: Perhaps one of the most alarming effects of stigma:		•Suicide is the second leading cause of death of youth ages 15-24 and the tenth leading cause of death for all Americans.		#SOSChat
A2: More of stigma’s effects:		•Though most people can be successfully treated, less than 1/2 of the adults in the U.S. who need services &amp; treatment get the help they need.	•The average delay between the onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years.		#SOSChat

"When I went to college, I felt like I had a pretty good handle on things, but you face different pressures in college. It’s very socially driven, there’s test anxiety. It’s a whole new beast, so I had to reevaluate how I cope.” - @corinnefoxx
"I’d get so anxious that I didn’t even want to enter the classroom... I told my parents that I wanted to talk to someone... A lot of people ignore it for a long time and suffer in silence because they think that they’re weird or that no one else feels that way.” - @corinnefoxx

A4 Involving the whole family can help treatments be briefer and have a longer effect on the child. The treatment team should include the health care provider, the child and the family for the best chances of long-term success. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Once this is done, a competent #mentalhealth provider can evaluate the child. Parents and other primary caregivers must be in charge of the treatment decisions. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Research has also identified effective treatment strategies for children and adolescents, but parents and other primary caregivers play a crucial role. For these interventions to happen, caregivers must first recognize the symptoms.	#ElevateTheConvo
A4 Research shows that early identification and intervention can minimize long-term disabilities associated w/ #mentalhealth conditions. It allows youth to:	•Succeed in school	•Develop socially	•Fully experience the developmental opportunities of childhood	#ElevateTheConvo
A4 Children &amp; adolescents w/ a mental health condition must be identified early &amp; connected with appropriate, effective services &amp; support to avoid losing critical opportunities to affect their brain development. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Other examples of symptom reduction include: 	•Prevention of the child’s need for intensive, more restrictive (often inpatient) services	•Fewer hospital admissions	•Less institutional care &amp; other types of out-of-home placement	#ElevateTheConvo
A4 Positive outcomes for treatment include symptom reduction, such as:	•Better school attendance &amp; performance	•Better family &amp; peer relationships	•Less involvement w/ law enforcement	•Less substance use &amp; abuse	•Less self-harm &amp; suicide-related behaviors	#ElevateTheConvo
A4 EBPs are treatments that have been shown through clinical research to produce positive outcomes, or good results. To be considered an EBP, the treatment must be shown to be effective in repeated studies. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 When making decisions about the best treatment options, one of the first questions to ask should be whether or not the treatment being considered is an evidence-based practice, or EBP. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 This is the process of developing the treatment plan that we mentioned earlier. A treatment plan is a written plan you develop as a team with the treatment team—the people who will be providing the services—and with your child as much as possible. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Your #mentalhealth provider will recommend the level and type of treatment that they believe is best. It’s up to you, and ideally your child as well, to decide what you believe will help the most. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 The person you find may not have an appointment available for weeks or months. Time is critical so have a backup plan:	· Ask them for a recommendation of who to see while you wait 	· Make an appointment w/ the provider, but also see your primary care physician #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Talk to other parents who you may know who have experienced similar situations. You should never rely on the yellow pages, TV commercials or other marketing materials you may see in your community. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 First, talk to people familiar w/ #mentalhealth services in your area. This could be your doctor, religious leader, the counselor at your child’s school, local or state NAMI office (https://t.co/jYvdg5NJyf), or the psychiatric association in your state. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 We know that with mental health conditions, the sooner the symptoms are recognized and treated, the better the prognosis, or outcome, is for our child’s long-term health. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Because of stigma, we’re less likely to request a consultation w/ a psychiatrist. But if we want to give our children the best chance for recovery, we have to get past the stigma. We should accept the referral or ask one if they don’t automatically offer it. #ElevateTheConvo
A4 Pediatricians and other primary care physicians are wonderful, caring and skillful people. But if your child was having a heart problem, or a lung problem, you wouldn’t hesitate to ask for a consultation with a heart or lung specialist (see thread). #ElevateTheConvo https://t.co/PrYdXdJsND

· Everyone in the family needs a “safe place” they can go to when they’re overwhelmed. Everyone doesn’t need to know where each other’s safe place is, but parents should make sure the children know it’s important that they have one. #ElevateTheConvo
· Take time to maintain your relationship w/ other adult caregivers as parents &amp; companions, even when you’re very stressed	· Update your child’s treatment provider (psychiatrist, therapist, etc.) on any difficulties the family is having	#ElevateTheConvo
· Explain that angry feelings are natural	· Use people’s individual strengths. Often, a child’s sibling can have a greater influence on them than any adult caregiver can.	· Have regular family meetings, when things are going well or you’re experiencing challenges	#ElevateTheConvo
· Avoid having secrets	· Love the child, hate the condition	· Help all the children in the family be aware of &amp; express their feelings about their situation	· Make time to pay attention to &amp; spend time w/ your other children	#ElevateTheConvo
A3 Here are several ways family therapists have suggested you can help manage how your child’s condition affects your entire family...	#ElevateTheConvo
A3 For example, we offer to bring their kids home from school, run other errands or cook them a meal. We want to support them &amp; show them we care. Simple gestures like this help them focus on getting better. They feel the support &amp; compassion of their community. #ElevateTheConvo
A3 Communities don’t react to brain conditions the way they react to other physical illnesses. If someone in our community has surgery, or some other medical crisis, we support them &amp; their family however we can (see thread). #ElevateTheConvo https://t.co/EpdKkjYUnL

A2 The limbic system begins developing during childhood &amp; is almost completely developed by adolescence. This powerful emotional processing center is involved in many of the most common #mentalhealth conditions. #ElevateTheConvo
A2 The limbic system is a complex group of structures located on both sides of the thalamus, under the cerebrum. It’s not a separate system from the rest of the brain, but b/c of the functions the limbic system controls, it is often called “the emotional brain.” #ElevateTheConvo
A2 One focus for researchers is investigating the biology of the brains of young people and how they’re similar or different from adults with the same conditions, what other parts of the brain are involved, and more. #ElevateTheConvo
A2 We're still learning about biological brain abnormalities associated w/ mental health conditions. Current research on children &amp; adolescents lays the groundwork for investigation of the causes &amp; treatments of mental health conditions in youth. #ElevateTheConvo
A2. Also:	· The earlier you intervene in a mental health condition, the better chance the child has at improving their mental health	· The entire family must be involved in recognizing symptoms, getting an accurate diagnosis, &amp; finding the right treatment	#ElevateTheConvo
A2 We believe that:	· Mental health conditions are biological	· Diagnoses in children and youth tend to change over time	· Children’s brains are still growing and changing	· There is no x-ray or blood test for diagnosing mental health conditions #ElevateTheConvo (see thread) https://t.co/PUiReO3ip4

A1 Research shows that our brain continues to develop &amp; “rewire” itself. Scientists now believe that the brain is not actually “finished” until we are in our early 20’s—if even then! #ElevateTheConvo
A1 The process of growth &amp; adjustment doesn’t stop when the child is born. The brain is the only organ that’s not completely formed at birth. #ElevateTheConvo
A1 Biology and the environment interact together to influence how a child grows and develops. #ElevateTheConvo
A1 Social environment means all outside things that might influence a child. Including their home, school, neighborhood, parents, siblings &amp; other family members—it’s the world in which they live. #ElevateTheConvo
A1 Biology refers to the physical characteristics, including in the brain that the child was born with. #ElevateTheConvo
A1 Child development happens in predictable sequences. All children typically move through the same sequences, but not always at the same pace. Many factors can influence the pace at which a child develops. The two main factors are biology and social environment. #ElevateTheConvo
A1 Theories of development share general concepts. 	· People develop in stages over their lifetime,	· There’s such a thing as successfully completing each stage, and	· It’s only after successfully completing a stage that people can move on to the next one.	#ElevateTheConvo
A1 All children develop in typical, predictable ways. When you have an idea about what should be happening at various developmental stages, it’s easier to identify when difficulties begin to appear (see thread). #ElevateTheConvo https://t.co/AhuK11h2Px

Of the many symptoms of mental health conditions, self-harm is one of the least understood and least sympathized. It’s also one of the few physically visible symptoms. Therefore, it’s often responded to in a way that’s derogatory and potentially harmful. https://t.co/JBgL90qQDR
Self-harm is usually a sign that a person is struggling emotionally and isn’t sure how to cope. It’s a sign that a person needs support, understanding and professional help. Most importantly, it’s a sign that shouldn’t be ignored or judged. Learn more: https://t.co/JBgL90qQDR https://t.co/88BA08TYsN

A3. If the steps you’ve taken aren’t working, it may be time to share with a mental health professional https://t.co/zkkE2bVSPh #StopSuicide
- Talk to someone. Get support from friends, family, a counselor or a support group. Talking can help.
- Get creative. Some people use art as their release. Try out a class for writing, painting, dance, music or improv!
- Set aside time for yourself. Do something that makes you feel good, like reading, going to the movies or getting a massage.
- Manage your time. Make a schedule so you don’t feel overwhelmed by everyday tasks and deadlines.
A3. Try different coping strategies to find the best one that fits for your #mentalhealth. Here’s a thread with some ideas… 		#StopSuicide
- Practice relaxation exercises. Deep breathing, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation are easy, quick ways to reduce stress.
- Avoid alcohol and drugs. They don’t actually reduce stress and often worsen it.
- Get enough sleep. Adults generally need between 7-9 hours of sleep. Avoid using computers, TV and smartphones before bed.
- Eat well. Eating foods like whole grains, vegetables &amp; fresh fruit is key to a healthy body &amp; helps stabilize your energy levels and mood.
- Exercise daily. Take the stairs whenever possible, walk up escalators, and run and bike rather than drive.
A3. Improving your physical wellbeing is one of the best ways you can support your #mentalhealth. Here’s a thread with tips… #StopSuicide
A3. Everyone experiences stress. Finding effective ways to manage stress is important. https://t.co/Qi4RINNnv9 		#StopSuicide

- Get help from organizations specializing in crisis intervention and suicide prevention, like @800273TALK, @CrisisTextLine &amp; @afspnational
- Don’t be sworn to secrecy. Seek support if you feel that you are not adequately able to provide the help they need and deserve.
- If necessary, take action by removing means such as weapons or stockpiled pills.
- Get involved and become available. Show interest and support them through what they are going through.
- Be supportive. Minimizing their problems or giving advice may create distance between you.
- Be non-judgmental. Don’t debate with them whether suicide is right or wrong or whether their feelings are good or bad.
- Be willing to listen and allow them to express their feelings. Accept that their feelings are valid.
- Be direct. Talk openly and honestly about suicide. Don’t be afraid to ask directly if they are thinking about suicide.
