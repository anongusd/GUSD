According to @owhnews Editorial Board: Tariffs threaten U.S. industry on three main considerations for business to function properly. https://t.co/vklpxZ0uwg
Tariffs on aluminum and steel “certainly is an affront to sound economic thinking and to the well-being of many U.S. businesses and workers.” @owhnews https://t.co/vklpxZ0uwg
Under @POTUS’s leadership economic growth &amp; job creation are flourishing. Tariffs, however, have the opposite effect. We urge him to use G7 meeting as an opportunity to rescind these damaging policies. https://t.co/DcjfTY1SWW
Our criminal justice system is broken. “It’s a moral crime and fiscal disaster” with:	- 2.3 MILLION behind bars in U.S.	- Costing taxpayers $80 BILLION	- Over 90% will be released	- 2/3 will be rearrested in 3 years	https://t.co/7d4omwcuiq

We urge these lawmakers who have championed prison reform in the past to size this opportunity to pass meaningful reform through the FIRST STEP Act. https://t.co/92QZ6ZMlJe #CJReform
We can end this self-destructive tariff cycle by dropping these tariffs now, not later; Continuing negotiations with China; and commencing talks with other trading partners.
Lawmakers who have championed prison reforms that better prepare individuals for reentry should continue their good work by passing the FIRST STEP Act. https://t.co/92QZ6ZMlJe #CJReform
With growing trade strife with China as frustrating as it was avoidable, there is a better path before U.S. leaders if they will only take it. https://t.co/QlIypM9qeo
Robust &amp; open trade is essential to a vibrant economy. Recent tariffs threaten U.S. economic well-being and stand to harm American consumers and manufacturers. https://t.co/gP45hbNh9C
To respect American taxpayers by putting the nation on a fiscally responsible path forward, Congress should re-asses all government programs. This farm bill should not be an exception. https://t.co/6UBfvMJc7F
During the Trump administration’s first 15 months we’ve seen employee hourly earnings rise roughly 3.3%, the economy gain more than 2.7 million jobs, and the unemployment rate drop 0.9% points. #JobsReport https://t.co/1UKwiSDQUw
American consumers, businesses, manufacturers, and farmers all stand to lose under tariffs. https://t.co/gP45hbNh9C
In April, unemployment was at 3.9%. Even more encouraging, the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct is continuing to spur job creation, make businesses more competitive, and improve the lives of millions of Americans. https://t.co/1UKwiSDQUw
The American dream isn’t about becoming rich and famous, it’s about working from the bottom to the middle. Here’s how programs in prison can help former inmates return as more productive members of society: https://t.co/DSrv4hMrAm

While this farm bill includes some positive reforms to the SNAP program, it still is rife with corporate welfare that primarily benefits wealthy owners of large farm businesses. https://t.co/6UBfvMJc7F
TPA is a crucial element in accomplishing lower trade barriers. Congress should not block its renewal. https://t.co/FdsooTA7n3
As the administration extends delay of steel &amp; aluminum tariffs on Canada, the EU &amp; Mexico, we urge them to make these exemptions permanent &amp; initiate a productive dialogue with China to address concerns. https://t.co/5U8FeiTfZA

Export-Import Bank spends taxpayer money to aid huge corporations undermining competition, job creation &amp; a level playing field. We will continue to aggressively oppose efforts to support or expand this agency. https://t.co/qoCCXqB11n
The Export-Import Bank is a prime example of corporate welfare. Congress should abolish this agency and instead improve U.S. competitiveness by rooting out unnecessary federal spending. https://t.co/qoCCXqB11n

U.S. businesses deserve the most competitive tax rate possible — not the global average hovering around 22% - https://t.co/DFPuNNnRUb #TaxReform @GOPSenate @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse https://t.co/go8avMmNCB
The global average corporate tax rate is 22.5%. The closer we are to average the more average we will be. Both the Senate and House bills include a 20% rate &amp; Congress should stick to it. https://t.co/3edzLEZcMx #TaxReform @SenateGOP @HouseGOP https://t.co/4zehBBFK0z
In Washington, bad ideas don’t die that easily. See how the House’s 20% consumer tax in their #TaxReform plan acts much like the BAT. https://t.co/v9Omo34YAX

JCT has a history underestimating positive economic responses to #TaxReform--now they’re underestimating the @SenateGOP tax plan. https://t.co/osOA278vAf
In the final #TaxReform bill, Congress should follow-through on their promise of a competitive business tax rate, reject harmful new tax burdens &amp; eliminate corporate welfare. https://t.co/3edzLEZcMx
Why should you be skeptical of the JCT #TaxReform estimates? Here are 5 reasons: https://t.co/osOA278vAf @SenateGOP
Lawmakers should focus on fixing our rigged tax system. Every dollar that goes towards padding profits of well-connected special interests isn’t easing the burden for ordinary taxpayers. https://t.co/jZYobhTyJM #TaxReform
Here's what it looks like when lawmakers work to un-rig the economy &amp; take away loopholes from special interests: panic. https://t.co/PZyZ3diCQ2
Congress should focus on simplicity, efficiency, fairness, predictability &amp; no new burdens for American taxpayers in the final #TaxReform bill. https://t.co/3edzLEZcMx
Nancy Pelosi says its "the end of the world." We say it’s a first step in returning our tax code rigged for special interests back to the people #TaxReform https://t.co/PZyZ3diCQ2
Whether it’s handouts to green energy companies or special tax breaks for nuclear energy &amp; coal, Congress should hold firm against all corporate welfare. https://t.co/jZYobhTyJM #TaxReform
