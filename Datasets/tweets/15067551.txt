I truly believe that Puerto Rico will recover, will rebuild, will leapfrog its development beyond anything that could have be done piecemeal and will become an example for the world. üáµüá∑ ‚ù§Ô∏è
From my own disaster recovery experience, now 14 years ago in #JacksonTN, I know how vital it is to have a vision to rally around ‚Äì public sector, private sector, community leaders, and citizens
Gov @ricardorossello's recovery plan combines many of the good ideas already in progress with lessons learned from other communities that have recovered from natural disasters  https://t.co/uqFZaW5lYG
Even when it comes to data, Puerto Rico is frequently omitted from statistics for U.S. states and similarly, left out of many nation-level measures. https://t.co/AdXIdVmlky
I have to be honest that before these post-Maria interactions, I didn‚Äôt know much about Puerto Rico and I did not understand oppressive ambiguity that "the status question" brings to every endeavor
A growing tech and startup community led by dynamic entrepreneurs like @engine4cws @piloto121 @parallel18 @eshipnetwork and so many more

Like: A vision of a cutting-edge digital strategy for a modern government, as proposed by former CIO @giangonz see: https://t.co/sgkJ7c7raO
If you want to know about resilience, talk to someone from Puerto Rico üáµüá∑; but then also talk about hope and vision ‚Äì because one thing I saw everywhere in post-Maria PR was space being made for good ideas already in progress
The first responders who, time and time again put others before their own families; the electric service personnel who went weeks without pay
And the heroism of regular folks like those at PRPCAN, who braved roads that were not really passable just to get fresh insulin to patients who needed it https://t.co/QId11FlyDF
The stories from the teachers are heart-wrenching ‚Äì  like pulling together a buffet of tuna and crackers and whatever anyone could find for kids who came to school because they didn‚Äôt know where else to go
There are also some amazing stories ‚Äì like the kid who found out he was really good as basketball once video games were not an option because the power was out, and teachers reporting a lot more sports and bike-riding
The stories of survival, and of loss, are inspiring and heart-wrenching. I know one very strong, very professional badass woman who still gets tears in her eyes every time she talks about it. (I see you @eileenfigueroa1‚ù§Ô∏è )

@CaseyBurgat @danielschuman In past decade $60+ b in ad revenue moved from supporting local journalism (local races &amp; electeds, city council and school board meetings, how national politics affects us, etc.) to feeding the social media machine... a lot of our adult-focused civics infrastructure went with it
@CaseyBurgat @danielschuman (ugh, "send" too soon)	1) Continued/increased focus on civic in schools	2) Nation-wide PSA/ongoing awareness campaigns of basic stuff	3) Support of civic tech to improve UX of interacting with gov &amp; availability of info	4) MASSIVE, sustained investments in local journalism

@danielschuman @mls1776 Right. I would think House GC would be the one to challenge any DoJ assertion against Congress/staff.

(and maybe just overzealous reporting)
Perhaps to try to get a court to allow DoJ to look into the Legislative Branch, which would be verboten under most any other circumstances? Dunno... it's just really, really weird.
Only way I can make sense of it is Rosenstein trying to get it on the record that serious allegations of misconduct were raised and House was either unwilling or unable to investigate those charges https://t.co/EVu0wh9HEV

@heysarah @metaviv @noUpside @travismoore @congressfdn One more thing: Big part of job of member of Congress is to meet with constituents and explain what's going on in Washington and how things work.

@heysarah @metaviv @noUpside @travismoore @congressfdn Seems like Nunes was referring to 2013-2015 in the interview, when there were fewer resources explaining actual legislative process. I think we've had some maturity there, but still have GOP &amp; Dem bases with unrealistic expectations about what their side can actually do.
@heysarah @metaviv @noUpside @travismoore @congressfdn I have (anecdotally) heard the opposite this year from staffers.

@dangillmor @nwatzman @jgphilpin @jcstearns @cspan Many tech founders and companies are providing this support already as one-off donations, investments, private foundations, projects, etc. but scale is the challenge
@dangillmor @nwatzman @jgphilpin @jcstearns @cspan Same as argument that way to avoid regulation is to proactively address problems... in absence of public (tax) support for public good tech, civic ed, and public/local media, tech cos can step up and create the funding stream themselves.

All to say, "bless your heart" probably doesn't advance the narrative much, but it sure sounds nicer than some other protest chants ;-)

SO NOT COOL. Senate makes it technically impossible for public to watch all senate nominations hearings live. https://t.co/GMSVOGiq9X
@danielschuman Nicely put. :-)
@danielschuman all of that to agree (I think?) that not possible to just say one party broke the senate. &amp; big question is: where to now?
@danielschuman yes but even after Bork, etc. new norms &amp; equilibria settled in, then came the ratchet of R obstructionism, D rule change...
@ddmcd I think there were deeper senate dynamics at play than that &amp; senators personal interpretation of fairness &amp; equivalence a factor
@danielschuman Oh I get that.. but I think personal experiences of the then-sitting senators carried more weight this time around.
But that's why I doubt McC would allow rule change to remove filibuster for SCOTUS. The Garland move was arguably proportional to Dem move.
Again, only conjecture, but imagine Dem filibuster change made it easier for uber-intitutionalist McConnell to justify delay on Garland.
Never seen it said publicly but imagine that when that happened, Mitch McConnell, author of "Long Game," thought "oh they will pay for this"
Not entirely fair to discuss changing senate norms w/o noting that Dems struck first w/ removal of filibuster for other nominees in 2013 https://t.co/8c4g4HkTd9

@ScovilleLaw I actually dig it. Will be interesting to see if it grows. Especially with policy-by-tweet becoming more common ;-)

@ScovilleLaw oooo I've seen some tweets I would be very comfortable pressing an "I don't like" button for!
@ScovilleLaw hmmm. Yes on mobile. And seems to be only available on certain accounts. (Guess it's a test).

@ddmcd Gets them on the record for what they do or don‚Äôt find acceptable, what they would or would not do &amp; sets terms for future oversight.
@ddmcd The nominees are real people, asking them pointed questions about their outlook &amp; how they would govern is really important.
@ddmcd Nomination hearings are not the place to play gotcha with other senators for future election. (They have long terms for a reason)
@ddmcd All the more reason for the public to pay attention. Their senators have final say &amp; knowing constituents watching makes difference.
@ddmcd 3/ Given only 51 votes needed to confirm, only Dem leverage is questions they can ask at the hearings to set tone for coming yrs. 3/
@ddmcd There is always an incentive for minority party in Senate to delay b/c that fills the calendar &amp; bumps action on other things. 2/

@joelmsiegel @mmcauliff Days in session + # of bills passed also a very superficial way to judge Congressional productivity.
@joelmsiegel @mmcauliff Are you counting the Omni as one bill? Seems a little elementary for a Senior Congressional Reporter.
@mmcauliff  	1) huh?	2) Don't think that GovTrack data says what you think it says.	3) Where'd you get "6 days work since mid july"?
@putorti Well, this one can't ding Trump for fake news. "six days work since mid-July" that's not even counting in session days right.

@danielschuman Agree completely! (But that's surely where the NatJos of the world come in!)
(I legit have no idea what the "Commemorative Coin Act" refers to)
Side rant: could we please make it a requirement for any serious publication covering Congress to ALWAYS include a bill number?
10/ This is a great example of how difficult it is to *really* understand what happens -- even when data is public.
9/ Here. Updated the chart. (&amp; may have missed a few) https://t.co/Pcj1kuwMUn
8/ Plenty of problems in #Congress to be addressed; but that can't happen w/o accurate, accessible coverage.
7/ This is not to pick on NatJo (which I love &amp; almost daily lament their paywall) but if even they feel this pressure to pursue clicks...
6/ What was the point of sharing a graphic like this without context? To inform? To give context? Or just to get clicks?
5/ Respected nonpartisan publication with staff of journalists covering Congress (like @nationaljournal) should fill that role.
4/ Long-understood challenge w/ #opendata is that can be misinterpreted; is why we frequently need experts/intermediators to give context.
3/ So, data cited from ‚ÄúCongress‚Äù is *correct* (re: bill status) but not *right* (re: actual bill outcome)
2/ Over half of bills listed have become law but are incorrectly marked here (b/c either included in other bills or House version passed)

13/ Finally, who would have guessed we would've come so far in 5-10 yrs? #GovTech, #OpenGov, #CivicTech friends, these are exciting times!
12/ growing #govtech sector doesn't take anything away from #civictech. It helps. (But is also a different animal altogether.)
11/ good #govtech can mean more #opendata which helps #civictech and certainly helps citizens. (&amp; makes gov work better.)
10/ all of that to say, it's exciting to see companies like @OpenGov get funding or @Granicus make acquisitions.
9/ for us at @POPVOX, that is #advocacy tools (&amp; maybe some #govtech in the future.)
8/ most successful for-profit #CivicTech cos I know don't make money on the "civic", they use another model to fund the civic mission.
7/ the"biz model" for #CivicTech is still evolving. Who pays? Is it foundation or donation dependent? Or are there other sustainable models?
6/ Most #CivicTech relies heavily on #OpenGov / #OpenData to interface with Gov in meaningful way.
#CivicTech is relatively new, not something govs have tradition of paying for... It doesn't fit a traditional model.
4/ #OpenGov isn't always easy or intuitive for govs to do on their own; they might purchase new #GovTech tools to implement (which is cool)
3/ #OpenGov as a concept &amp; movement was new 10 yrs ago but quickly mainstreaming (yay! victory for awesome #opengov advocates &amp; pioneers!)
2/ but #GovTech as concept is not new -- govs generally have budget &amp; pay for it (makes sense it would get $$ like traditional company.)
1/ in that #GovTech (tech used by govs) has been around a while. In many places it's getting an upgrade (&amp; hopefully new procurement rules)
@anildash @nancyscola think it's appropriate to differentiate civic tech from gov tech.
