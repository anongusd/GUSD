Being in the middle at times does not resolve the problem facing millions of Americans. Which is poverty and low wages, high medical costs. High education costs and no savings. The Political middle is the status quo. That codifies it. That's all.
Clergy who support Trump are doing it for their own political expendency. They know his moral compass turns with his own survival. The true spirituality is one when you lead from your heart not a corrupted Political leader who says one thing but acts in a different way.

Rhetoric does not win elections. Meeting people who vote and ask them what is on their minds. No matter their socio-economic status or education level is either. Do not dismiss anybody. A stern warning to the eventual Democratic candidate for President. 90,000 votes mattered.
Prayers for all the Homeless across the country who are outside in these unbearable temperatures with little or no hope. Stop and think how lucky you actually may be.
It has become a revolving door on the MSM recently e Hack Politicians trying to remain relevant, Consultants strutting their stuff and those from previous administrations looking for work. Read a reputable newspaper instead at times.
Centrist Candidates for President want only to keep the status quo. You have heard already this week from those Candidates. If we did not have Progressives leading the charge historically we would not have Medicare and Social security to begin with along with Union protections.

When anyone faces jail time as a senior thoughts have to go through your mind on how I can get out of this predicament. Ego aside, life is not finite and jail can be a very unpleasant experience as many have found out. Who knew. We will see.

Whether you agree or disagree with Hillary Clinton running for President she will be a major if she decides to run. That does not necessarily mean she could win the nomination but she can not be readily dismissed.

Be careful of Republicans urging Independent candidates for President. It may be a setup for supporters of Trump and friends.
I believe with likes of Steven King in Congress as a Republican along with Trump loyalists, the Democrats may be in a position to create a Super Majority in the House of Representatives. There are another 30 seats in play. Picking the right ones is the key.

It is a long road to the Whitehouse. It is grueling. Bumps and bruises. Ups and downs. Good days and bad days. No matter which candidate you pick, stay the course. Don't give up. Stay loyal. And above all, have some fun.
I am sure illegal drugs are making their way into the United States other than the Mexican boarder. It may be coming from countries you would never think it could come from. Boarder security is important. Smart security is even better.
History of candidates positions matter. Wavering gives room for pause. They needed to be vetted properly. We all need to do our due diligence. Especially for President of the United States. We need not always have to romantize our candidates. Issues matter.
Just a thought. I believe that the Democratic nominee for President needs to have some Foreign Affairs experience. We are living in volitile times. We need to repair broken alliances.

Face it. Barr is an entrenched political insider. Part of the permanent government who has made money on all his inside political connections. He will not rock the boat too far because he likes those connections. An occtupus with long tenicles.
Barr is an old middle age white guy who has spent too many years as a political insider. It shows.

Hello @PepsiCo your new subsidery @HealthWarrior is a mess in conjunction with @amazon Twice I was sent the wrong health bar. I spent over an hour with @Amazon trying to resolve it. Went to @HealthWarrior to keep a courtesy replacement. No luck. Very unprofessional. Thumbs down.
@AmazonHelp Forget it. I spent almost 2 hours already on this crap. @HealthWarrior and @amazon made me the victim and wasted my valuable time by sending me the wrong product and now @HealthWarrior wants me to repeat the same thing with them. For a 15.00 order. Both of you have no shame.
Do not buy @HealthWarrior through @Amazon They sent me the wrong product twice and now @HealthWarrior wants me to document everything. All for a 15.00 product. Choose a different health bar. Save yourself undue lost time and effort.
