Yet she claimed to ‚Äúhooked up all day‚Äù.  So I think she lied to make money on this. So far, the facts show that. No corroboration but she has $1million GoFundMe

@Vesus @jimsciutto I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. You can‚Äôt say that about voting for #CrookedHillary Americans were so sick of her they opted for an Orange Clown. This is largely your fault! But ignore that. @realDonaldTrump will win 42 states in 2020. R‚Äôs pick up 4 Senate seats and retain the House
@dick_nixon You would have kicked Lee Iacocca‚Äôs ass
@jimsciutto Simple. Democrats used it as a partisan weapon to overturn the election.  Democrats ignored #CrookedHillary role with Russia. Americans have every reason to be suspect. I don‚Äôt believe the Russians swayed any Wisconsin and Pennsylvania steelworkers.

@jamesscott1911 @oleanjanine @DLoesch @FBI She said there were only two questions asked both similar. But she was hooked up ‚Äúall day‚Äù!  Such a charge-36 years late- demands full light of day
@oleanjanine @DLoesch @FBI I agree-BUT the Democrats made the fact ‚Äúshe took a lie detector test!‚Äù their rallying cry and proof positive she has to be telling the truth. This will expose that nonsense
@JohnCornyn She has forfeited her right to comment on the @FBI investigation
@JulianSvendsen @LadyLizDarcy It should be disbanded

@APoetsDreams Must have struck a nerve with Dowd because he blocked me. Yes, she did discuss her regret of a high school time spent drinking and partying. No big deal. Normal stuff. I did put it a bit harshly. Peer pressure is a bitch for teenager girls especially
@APoetsDreams @EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench If you really are an attorney then you know how dishonest all this is. Spare me the good citizen act
@EmmettMiche11em @APoetsDreams @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench I have four sisters and seven granddaughters so yes I get it. I also have six grandsons who wouldn‚Äôt deserve to be put through this just so you can feel good about the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù.

@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench @FBI I trust six FBI background checks and the staffs of 10 determined opponents on the committee to have found all that‚Äôs there to be found and that further delays to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù plays into dishonest intentions
@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench @FBI No one in either party on the committee will change their vote. Dems have been a unified no from the onset.  Spartacus?
@APoetsDreams @EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench Ramirez herself couldn‚Äôt say it was Kavanaugh and called around to see if anyone could help her and her own friends couldn‚Äôt. Swearing to something that happened 35 years ago and unprovable either way is no perjury risk
@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench So if it happened there should be at least one of the multiple victims there to verify these parties occurred whether Kavanaugh was present or not.  A lot of suspicious speculation after a long nomination process and six @FBI background checks doesn‚Äôt warrant considering
@caseycodorniz @hrtablaze @LindseyGrahamSC He actually expressed how he feels about Cosby. He said ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt rape and abuse once or twice and quit, but like #HarveyWeinstein they make a career out of it‚Äù. He should have included Cosby and @BillClinton
I would have voted for the Taliban before voting for #CrookedHillary   If the choice was Hillary or Hitler I would have flipped a coin. If it came up Hillary I would have gone two out of three. So, what was your question again about @realDonaldTrump ?

@1776Stonewall Good sex?
@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench Ford is the only one deserving a second look. Unfortunately all four of the people she named denied or didn‚Äôt recall. As for Ramirez, she AND the NYTimes discounted it so no, and please tell me you don‚Äôt believe Swetnick‚Äôs BS. Went to 10 rape parties and stayed silent 35 years?
@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench Of course not. But 30 years after Anita Hill would hope the doyenne of the Democratic Party wouldn‚Äôt pull an Earnest Byner. What comfort can women have if their ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù betray trust for political ends?
@EmmettMiche11em @aggie_prof @DavidAFrench Hard to imagine smart accomplished women like Ford had no better way to confront such a dangerous person than let him sit on the DC court for 12 years then let Feinstein shipwreck her narrative. A credible accusation would have stopped him before a hearing. Discrediting
@robbystarbuck @SusanSt08942260 After the third party you‚Äôd have to say she liked the sex.
@realDonaldTrump Next time a nominee comes before the judiciary committee they should announce a deadline for accusations that once passed would allow a nominee to shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without consequence

@kesayers @JohnCornyn Your ignorance is appalling
@avengingmomgel @JohnCornyn One more inconvenient truth: None of Bork‚Äôs appeals court opinions were overturned by the Supreme Court. Pretty mainstream by definition
@avengingmomgel @JohnCornyn Educate yourself. Ruckelshaus and Richardson implored Bork to stop what would be a department emptying series of resignations as all were prepared to follow. Bork fell on the sword knowing it would trigger Nixon‚Äôs demise which it did. He was an unsung hero.
@waspuppet @Tryagain5555 @JohnCornyn That‚Äôs because you fundamentally misunderstood what happened. The two guys in front of him that resigned rather than fire Cox begged Bork to stay, fire Cox, and save the justice department

@MarilynWeaver13 @B52Malmet Good thread by Ed Wheelan (sp?)
@MarilynWeaver13 @B52Malmet ...matters. Honestly matters. Kennedy killed a woman then demonized and lied about Robert Bork. Americans resented it and have been indifferent to the anything-to-win game they both now play.
@MarilynWeaver13 @B52Malmet ...Feinstein not throw this in Kavanaugh‚Äôs face in their private meeting?  She had a duty to get Grassley on board immediately. The Dems destroyed Anita Hill for what? Thomas sits in the court and deals revenge every fall. We have to have good people willing to serve- so fairness
@MarilynWeaver13 @B52Malmet FBI cannot confirm something if she is unable to recall the time and place and witnesses. It‚Äôs 36+years ago. The FBI vetted him six times. The Dems owe ALL OF US a fair process and have denigrated it with rank partisanship. They sat on it. If it was that serious why did ...
@MarilynWeaver13 @B52Malmet I don‚Äôt doubt a prep school of privileged boys had such a culture but so did the girls school. The real test is the complete ABSENCE of improper behavior since and her inability to recall critical details (year, place, how she got there, how she got home, who she told (etc)
@charliekirk11 @Richard99060426 Tamir Rice. Justify that one please or forever shut the fuck up

@JohnCornyn check this out https://t.co/1HPCfjziip
@B52Malmet Because people lie and after 36 years if you can‚Äôt recall when it was, where it was, how you got there, how you got home and who you were with might tend to diminish your claim. What if Kavanaugh was your son?  Would you accept it at face value?
@allahpundit That‚Äôs the most Nazi like statement I‚Äôve heard
@ifshesaidso @matthewjdowd If he actually attempted to rape her she would‚Äôve said something. It‚Äôs strange credulity you think she would hold it for 36 years until the very last second
@PhilipRucker It‚Äôs about the culture of Yale not just his fraternity and the culture of all colleges at that time. It isn‚Äôt like boys and girls had completely different understandings of the dating/mating ritual. Mores evolve. Stop with the hindsight judgments
@ValerieJarrett She‚Äôs trying to destroy a decent man and deserves every opprobrium she received. If she was attacked like that she would have told someone. It‚Äôs bullshit
@teedeerose @matthewjdowd No, not like that.  You contribute to an ever poorer quality of applicants as good people will refuse to serve. If he did something like that she should have spoken up long before now. This was a political hit job. She may have been assaulted a second time by the Dems
@matthewjdowd Compassion is not a substitute for common decency. Even if he did exactly what she claims, he‚Äôs led a good life by any measure and HIS FAMILY was undeserving of having it raised after 36 years. It betrays a dishonest motive. She and the Democrats deserve only scorn.
@tribelaw I guess you think it would be healthier for this country if we just go ahead and take her 36-year old alcohol clouded word for it. Do you have any sons that you would let be subjected to this?  How about your granddaughters?
@matthewjdowd Do you have any sons that you care about that could be ruined by a 36-year vague recollection? Want your granddaughters exposed to this?  She‚Äôs not a credible witness and she admitted being a teen drunk who partied too much

@HoarseWisperer @BeSeriousUSA She can‚Äôt remember where she was, how she got there, how she got home. Sounds like a drunken slut with a guilty conscience
@snarkysnowqueen @InfamousK48 @AriFleischer Yes. Limited by the 36-year faded memory of an admitted drunken slut who has a political bias
@matthewjdowd @DavidAFrench It‚Äôs not that they believe him it‚Äôs that her claims can‚Äôt be validated and were raised at a suspicious time.
Nothing to gain but a defeated court nominee! She admitted being a drunken slut as a teen https://t.co/BtnYjSMt8j
@mitchellreports @jmpalmieri It‚Äôs still not. Time to get over it
@trusgift @tribelaw Oh, I‚Äôm a lot more comfortable hanging him on that accusation knowing someone of your eminent qualifications has vetted him. Never mind, Brett.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump In truth, that should be standard practice. The people have a right to know what their employees are doing. Let the chips fall...
@tribelaw Hard to imagine anyone ever considered you qualified for the Supreme Court. Letting an unsubstantiated and unprovable 36-year old accusation destroy someone‚Äôs life is what I would expect from a Venezuelan or North Korean judge.
@666k9s @MSNBC No she wanted to avoid scrutiny

@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar $15-$50/month. That‚Äôs affordable
@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar It‚Äôs covered in 99% of plans. It is affordable
@SecretaryPerry Plus we know you are not that articulate
@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar But we won‚Äôt be able to have those freedoms until we can define what they are. Yes it‚Äôs private, complicated, personal, and gut-wrenching. I don‚Äôt judge any woman for it.  But the disproportionate number of black babies aborted tells you it‚Äôs used frequently for birth control
@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar I agree with most of that. It seems that there‚Äôs a point where we are talking about two people with competing interests. But for all the fervent beliefs in abortion no one seems to be willing to say when that is. If its the moment of delivery why so hard to say it?
@mmehenriquez Kavanaugh has nothing to say about anything that doesn‚Äôt first become a law that is then subsequently challenged in courts, and that eventually reach the SC. I‚Äôd be worried about the ones you get to vote for so we keep current law
@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar That‚Äôs why I asked you for help!  So your answer is the40th week?  The moment of delivery?  Seems like you have great fear admitting that.
@girlinseattle @mmehenriquez @atrupar Help me understand: Where in the 36 week gestation process do YOU BELIEVE the fetus gains a right to life?
@PauThang5 @AmberFischerMT @KamalaHarris Here‚Äôs another question: can a woman carrying a child as a surrogate abort the baby as it nears term?
@lfisher314 @KamalaHarris This is not men versus women. This is about protecting life. Unless you are a bot, you have some opinion on when a baby should be protected. If that‚Äôs never, be honest enough to say so
@JulieSczesny @KamalaHarris My only question: Do you believe that woman‚Äôs control is absolute through the moment of delivery?
@KurtSchlichter Beats the pussy hats
@cher Can I get some of those drugs you‚Äôre on?
@KamalaHarris It‚Äôs not the female‚Äôs body the government makes decisions about it‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs body inside the female, also a US citizen with rights to be protected. If that‚Äôs not true then abortion should have no restrictions. If true it should. What do you think?

@PiperPerabo ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ sobbing?
@TheTobster111 @DavidCornDC My passion for defending a man who gave so much from revisionist history does lead me to be a little rude, sorry, but RUDE is a good way to describe Bork‚Äôs treatment. Read OCAW v American Cyanamid and tell me how that regulates women to back alley abortions (per Ted Kennedy)
@TheTobster111 @DavidCornDC Didn‚Äôt vote for Trump or #CrookedHillary   Don‚Äôt blame Obama either. Bork never had ONE SINGLE OPINION overturned by a higher court. Sounds pretty mainstream to me. You should read more. Less TV
@iprefer_pi @DavidCornDC Bork was well aware his actions would be easily distorted but his sense of duty and loyalty gave him the courage to do the right thing. He was ok with the fact that fools like you would simply believe what you are told
@iprefer_pi @DavidCornDC No secret. Bork himself said it. So did families of Ruckelshaus. You‚Äôre why the process will get done in spite of protest because the country had to get past the fools
@SenBooker @LunaLuvgood2017 You‚Äôve had 10,000 pages related to his work with Ken Starr for a month. Did you find any issues there that would be cause for alarm?  Of what has been released...any red flags? Time to speak up
@fyreprincess @GrammaGaz @KamalaHarris And maybe sometimes voting with Republicans is doing just that.
@JasonRylander @DavidCornDC What he deserved
@iprefer_pi @DavidCornDC That is a colossally stupid statement. Ruckelshaus and Richardson ASKED Bork not to resign (as they did) to keep the entire Justice Department from emptying out. They all knew the Cox firing would be the end of Nixon and they were right. Bork was a patriot betrayed
@TheTobster111 @DavidCornDC Simple: Dems dishonest distortion of Bork‚Äôs record and forthrightness in testifying killed any future hearings being comprised of substance. Need more proof than who followed?
@Thedude67111 @DavidCornDC @GOP Everyone involved with the Saturday Night Massacre knows that Robert Bork acted as a patriot to prevent the entire Justice Department from resigning. He knew his actions (firing Cox) would trigger Nixon‚Äôs demise, which of course it did. Know your history
@turbsuspension @DavidCornDC Noting your ‚Äòevidence based‚Äô banner, go back and read a few of Bork‚Äôs opinions and see how badly Kennedy and Biden et al outright lied about Bork.
@JasonRylander @DavidCornDC It was anything but fair. When Ted Kennedy is your moral judge you know it was rigged. Abusive distortion of Bork‚Äôs record set the path we‚Äôve been on these 30 years. Arlen Specter was a rank opportunist so spare me the bipartisan BS
@skuytercliffe @DavidCornDC Clarence Thomas was revenge for Bork. This one covers the interest.

@PineLake18 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy And there‚Äôs much about him to despise. Same for her. Too bad this is the best we can do after 240 years
@PineLake18 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy And he‚Äôs not my hero. I blame Trump win on Dems for forcing the most corrupt candidate in history on the voters. Millions of Obama voters stayed home or voted Trump. That‚Äôs on a corrupt Democratic Party
@PineLake18 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump
@KNT_of_Reason @Anneredmond13 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy The character of the person you voted for is precisely the topic. We had Trump v Hillary because as a nation we have low standards
@Anneredmond13 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump and found both odious choices
@PineLake18 @detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy And I would have voted for the Taliban before voting for #CrookedHillary
@detrompez @RightlyNews @realDonaldTrump @USNavy Then why did you vote for #CrookedHillary ?

@Ocasio2018 The seemingly irreversible trend of income inequality is largely the result of government degradation of dollar‚Äôs purchasing power. When Fed created $5 trillion overnight in 2008 who got it?  The 1% of the 1%. Hard assets further out of reach of middle class

@samdobrow @CeciliaSchulte @zasjeda @NathanLerner Again your own article proves my point. 50% mobility is still huge and greater than any other nation. The 90% rate of the 1940‚Äôs was when everyone was poor and a good job was enough to do it.
@samdobrow @CeciliaSchulte @zasjeda @NathanLerner I don‚Äôt argue that mobility has fallen in the last generation. It‚Äôs a first cousin to income inequality. Both are fueled by government relentless erosion of $ purchasing power. Middle class can‚Äôt acquire wealth. Dodd-Frank was a job killer
@CeciliaSchulte @samdobrow @zasjeda @NathanLerner I was one. So were you unless you were born rich. The majority of those in the lower 20% move up over life. Some at the very top move down. It‚Äôs an inconvenient truth for your ‚Äòwoe is me‚Äô America.
@samdobrow @zasjeda @NathanLerner Your own facts prove my point. Claiming 23% of American kids live in poverty is Fake News. It ranks Slovakia‚Äôs children as better cared for. You really think families there living on less than $800/mo there do better than ours living on $2400/mo here?
@samdobrow @zasjeda @NathanLerner That‚Äôs ridiculous. Travel more. Ours live better than many in the middle classes of other industrialized countries. Much larger share of our bottom 20% rise to upper half than anywhere else in the world
@samdobrow @zasjeda @NathanLerner Living beyond your means when we know economies are cyclical is reckless. 2008 was a failure of government AND the market. Too many rich people who took outsized risks were saved while bottom 80% paid the price
@zasjeda @NathanLerner Our poorest 20% live very well in relation to the world, and any historical comparison. The world is on a phone. Medicine is miraculous. Freedom unprecedented. Income inequality is a separate issue-caused by government inflating dollar to benefit of 1%
@RepTedDeutch If that is the depth of your understanding you should resign and let someone honest hold the seat
@funder Do they have donuts in your world?
@realDonaldTrump This is why you were elected and we are depending on you to see this through. What she did was treason.
@NathanLerner Ironically, the more you bleat this while the economy is soaring and unemployment reaches historic lows- not to mention the greatest optimism on the N Korean matter- the more you render it meaningless. Thankee.
