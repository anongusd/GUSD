If I had put the same level of resources into a software startup that I have for this work I have no doubt I would already have at least thousands of paying customers.
I have persisted because if any of my four inventions' function, and I'm as certain as I am that I exist that all four do, then my technology is the only way to save the world from climate change, and has a permanent cost based monopoly on the world's largest market by revenue.
Hardware startups are difficult for early investors to understand, because unlike software which doesn't require money to build a product for demonstration, all that can be provided for complex hardware prior to funding are technical schematics very few seem able to even read.
Hardware startups requiring patents are the most difficult to start, rate of progress is inherently inhibited by money, first research and development, second patenting before prototyping (absolute novelty standard), third production (components, materials, 3d printing, CNC).
Software startups not requiring patents are the easiest to start (Airbnb, Stripe, etc.)
I worked on electrical engineering projects for a couple years before I started programming at 8. I transitioned to programming partly because every engineering project project had component and material costs, while programming required the one time expense of a computer.

Nuclear fusion has the same cost structure as nuclear fission, and that's after it's been optimized for decades, will still calculate to around 10x as expensive as output from my inventions, and solves nothing but the toxicity part of nuclear fission, as explained in my book.
11/11 Reason to limit VC allocation (pensions outflows require similar consideration): "diversification allowed us to deliver those returns in a stable fashion, which is incredibly important to... Yale that requires a steady flow of funds to finance its operations"
10/11 Reason not to allocate to VC (referencing '97-'02): "dollar weighted returns were less than the time weighted returns, 72% of money invested in VC funds was lost, and because of... capital gains distributions... [also] a tax bill for 24% of the money put in."
9/11 On selecting VCs: "high integrity... people of unimpeachable character... that are smart, incredibly hard working, maniacally focused on beating the markets"
8/11 Reason to allocate to VC: "the difference between the first and third quartile... bond market 0.5%, hedge fund 7.3%, real estate 9.3, LBO 13.7%, venture capital 43.2%"
7/11 "...by extending your time horizon... it opens up a whole host of investment opportunities... its not a big deal to buy something, have it go down... as long as your investment thesis proves out and your ultimately able to exit the position at a profit."
6/11 "..take away is to avoid market timing... buying after somethings gone up... instead of stepping up when something appears attractive and overweighting."

4/11 Among the interesting limited partners were Harvard for its large staff of ~110 with specialized roles, and Yale for superior performance. I found this video of the Yale endowment head explaining his investment philosophy, including venture allocation and selection criteria.
3/11 Among limited partners, I wondered why they generally don't seem to think much of venture investors, referring to them impersonally as an asset class requiring limited exposure.
2/11 Among venture investors, I'm shocked by lack of first principles assessments and aggressive outreach, instead seeking third party validation and referrals to know what to think, which is counterproductive to achieving superior returns and against limited partners interests.
1/11 I've spent quite some time over the last 6+ months researching every significant venture investor and their significant limited partners which decide whether or not to fund them every two years.

Fun is not part of fundraising.
In conjunction with StartEngine, I completed a now public available securities offering filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for Bannon Maher Corp and launched an equity sale.
Equity crowdfunding as a concept is an important component of reducing wealth inequality by expanding economic opportunity.
StartEngine successfully exhaustively vetted both me and the company -- background, banking, corporate, patent, financial, regulator, and documentation checks -- over many months, with a lawyer and accountant, ensuring comprehensive disclosure of risks and full legal compliance.
After launch, multiple individuals, who provided absolutely no indication they had reviewed my work specifically, or demonstrated any relevant expertise, wrote in that the general concept related to my work is simply not possible.
StartEngine then responded that it didn't have the capacity or willingness to adequately make a judgement of the submitted comments as required by crowdfunding regulation, and in less than a day closed the offering.
It's unfortunate @startenginela @howardmarks @ronstartengine allowed lies and ignorance to prevail over honesty and innovation.
Thank you to the six investors, who in less than a day, on the offered terms, contributed significant money that is unaccessible to me -- I don't know who you are, but I appreciate your acknowledgement of the validity of my inventions, my business, and your immediate support.
My work is incredibly important to the world, I never forget people who support me, and your support for me and my work is support for all of us.
I had intended to also, and may shortly, launch an independent Reg D 506(c) offering, after having successfully completed that exhaustive due diligence process, utilizing the vetted offering documents.
