In the end, the only way to stop this nightmare is to expose it. The producers of #GosnellMovie did their part. Now it's up to us. On October 12, go see the movie that the abortion industry doesn't want you to see!
No one should be surprised at Planned Parenthood's pathetic attempt to shut the @GosnellMovie down. They're probably afraid more Americans will make the connection between Gosnell's barbarism and their support for procedures just like it.
In Austin, the local Planned Parenthood is so afraid of people learning the truth about their industry that they bullied the local Hyatt into canceling a screening of the @GosnellMovie. Why? Because it coincided w/ PP's $400-a-plate fundraising gala. https://t.co/KUT3fRvrUc
