@Blue_Wave_Dogs üá∫üá∏ All Dem candidates must get a fair chance to debate &amp; adjust the Party platform. No anointed candidate. No thumb on the scale. No pouting. No splitting the Party. Democracy, economy &amp; environment are at stake. Failure is not an option. Let's pick the winner for 2020.  üá∫üá∏
@h8Wankmaggot45 With the talented field of candidates the Dems have to choose from in 2020 all ideas &amp; debates will strengthen the Party. We defeated ourselves in 2016. Just get to the polls &amp; vote for the Dem nominee. No dirty tricks &amp; no pouting. And for f*cksake don't talk to any Russians!
@dalecooper_ @leeleeb50 I think Bernie is a patriotic American &amp; if the election is "fair &amp; square" he will back the Dem who is officially nominated. The purpose of a robust Primary is to adjust the Party platform while arriving at the candidate who can WIN. Then we ALL bury our G.D. hatchets &amp; vote.

@giershift43 I don't think we're talking about the same thing. When not-so-rich people die &amp; leave a farm, let's say $3.5M, that's been in the family for 40 years &amp; the land value has appreciated by a lot, the kids often have to sell off half the fields to hold onto the farm. Not fair, imho.
@giershift43 Agreed. "Death tax" is a lousy name for estate tax &amp; there should be a cap on the amount so "trust fund babies" aren't the ones using it. But kids inheriting a family farm should be able to keep working it if they want to. Not everybody wants an office job in the city.
@giershift43 "Estate tax" then. I still think you're very wrong. There are thousands of these farms in every state except CA &amp; NV, I think. Parents die &amp; kids lose the farm they grew up on to taxes. Then developers put up hundreds of houses on the land. It stinks.	#SaveFamilyFarms

@DearAuntCrabby He had to recuse himself.  Otherwise impeaching Kavanaugh would be seen as political vengeance instead of justice.  We'll get him out anyway as long the evidence is actually gathered and looked at.
If Sid Miller (TX GOP candidate) looked at this cartoon and his mind leapt to anybody's daughter in particular, he is a dirty old man!
I'd say the GOP went too far, not the sign.  (How can I get one?)

The Dems should not put all their Kavanaugh eggs in this sexual assault basket. What if this woman is a lousy witness? (Or Heaven forbid, a GOP plant?) The hearings will end with the Dems looking foolish, and the "confidential" docs and questions will go unanswered ... forever.
@tedlieu @JeffFlake Please don't let this "me too" issue push all the other Kavanaugh problems aside. Sure, it's a sexy story, but a Judge lying under oath is more outrageous and certainly should preclude confirmation to the SCOTUS.  I hope the Dems don't blink on this one.
@mrbenwexler True now, but it wasn't like that in 1982. I fear this particular "me too" moment might brush aside the "lying under oath" issue and all the Kavanaugh docs that Congress still doesn't have.  What is more damning for a Judge than lying under oath?

@mbierm @MichaelAvenatti And we're still going to get Kavanaugh for the rest of our days if the Dems don't do something drastic, like start calling for massive protests in the streets to stop this nomination. Civil Disobedience now!
@NatCookResists @MichaelAvenatti And it's going to be too late if they keep playing by Trump's rules (or lack of rules) If the Dems don't do something outrageous and BIG pretty damn fast, we are going to have Supremes that will ruin our kids' lives!  Don't you get it yet?  Trump lies, the House swears to it ...
