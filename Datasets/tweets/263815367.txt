Klinger:explain why killer of 9 in Charleston was arrested without getting shot or why a terrorist was only shot in leg but our men killed
Donald Trump. You make the United States "look bad"!
And 13 year old Tyree King too. When will it stop? Stop using deadly force against individuals who you have no reason to shoot anyway
Police shoot a suspected terrorist in the leg but shoots an unarmed Black man not threatening only seeking help dead! Justice please!
T.i. is standing up to 'All Lives Matter' in powerful new video https://t.co/JboikvkufV # via @blackvoices
Good to know, however late, Police can stop suspects with a non-lethal shot to leg. Senseless killing of Black men could have been prevented

I think Speaker Boehner has it backwards. If 2-part, then most critical to lift debt ceiling first, then deal with deficit reduction
