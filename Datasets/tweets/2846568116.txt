not alone. Talk with a trusted friend, you may be surprised to find they're a survivor too.		Most importantly, it's not your fault.		...and don't hide in humiliation &amp; shame for 40 some odd years then go on a sarcastic ranting rage tweet!		#catharsis		7/7
you don't have to be alone or helpless afterwards.		You'll be shocked how many women have been sexually accosted by a rapist, family, a friend or all.		My personal experience in knowing fellow survivors, ratios are more than 1 out of every 2 women, so you're

6. Immediately call police, all your friends, neighbors, social media contacts and describe, in detail, the humiliating &amp; horrific events that took place while you were being raped.	7. Ask each of the previously listed people to record, on a calendar, every detail		3/7
3. If you recorded time with phone try getting some selfies of you &amp; your rapist.	4. Ask your rapist for his/her full name, age &amp; address.	5. Afterwards mark the date, time, place, details, etc. on a physical calendar &amp; save that calendar for future use.		2/7
Watched Kavanaughs lawyer on MSNBC earlier. For future reference ladies &amp; men, if you're in the middle of being raped remember to jot these things down... 	1. The place you're being raped at, an address is best.	2. Be sure to look at your watch or phone for time, during.		1/7
