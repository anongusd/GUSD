POLL RESULTS: Voters want a public option for Rx drugs!

Warren's ideas are resonating! #FITN #NHpolitics #Warren2020 https://t.co/w0ZdBlSNh4
NEW POLL: Voters support @AOC's tax proposal! @BoldProgressive polling of Dem primary voters found that 71% would favor a candidate who leverages @AOC's tax plan to fund healthcare &amp; education opportunities.

(She also called for protecting Robert Mueller, fitting that into her larger promise to tackle corruption.) Voters left feeling that Warren wants government to be on their side.
- Instead of a boring checklist of issues, Warren outlined a worldview that tied everything back to corruption. She connected the dots between corporate lobbyists, rigged laws that hurt workers, and the real-world impact that creates in people‚Äôs lives.
...and the relationship she has with her Republican veteran brothers. One voter told AP, ‚ÄúShe is real.‚Äù One conservative voter publicly endorsed her, saying she has always fought for the middle class.
Then, she gave barn burner speeches inside, took lots of questions, and stayed after for selfies with every voter who wanted one. 	- She was relatable ‚Äì tying important issues back to her life experience growing up poor in Oklahoma, the struggles her parents faced...
Warren was proposing big systemic changes that challenge corruption of our democracy and our economy at its core. Iowans love Warren‚Äôs populist message!
Many voters told reporters &amp; me that they were undecided and just getting a feel for Warren including some former Trump voters. Then she spoke. The energy was electric as they heard Warren‚Äôs message of challenging the influence of powerful interests that hurt working families.
Here‚Äôs what he saw that signaled to me that Warren is well positioned to defeat Trump: 	- Warren took the rare step of holding her first events in the more rural, conservative part of the state that elected right-winger Steve King to Congress.

Bloomberg News reported that ‚Äú[the] phrase debt-free college was hardly present in the national political lexicon until the PCCC launched a campaign in January to push Democrats to support the idea.‚Äù By 2016, over 100 members supported the resolutions.
Via our lobbying arm, The P Street Project, we led an effort to build congressional support for both a House and Senate resolution calling for access to #DebtFreeCollege.
The GI Bill had a 7-to-1 return on investment for America‚Äôs economy, federal investment to states and students in order to achieve debt-free college will be a similar investment in our economic future. The PCCC has worked tirelessly to make #debtfreecollege a reality.
