@AzTrump2020 Prices are down and that makes it tough on farmers. I wouldn't put it passed Congress to limit the bailout to farms big enough to afford DC lobbyists but I don't know for sure. President Trump is making a long overdue correction in our trade imbalances and it's hard for some.

Teams also should expect to make more than 50% of their 2-point conversions. With that said the Giants are garbage outside of Barkley and Beckham. https://t.co/8o2d2NY3yC
I can explain why it makes sense to go for 2 after a touchdown late and you're down 8. A 2 point raises your teams odds of winning more than missing increases your chance of losing. If you miss you can still get to overtime with a 2-pointer on the 2nd touchdown #NYGvATL #MNF
