@HeyTammyBruce Do you still need aspirin?
@sweetbaboo1979 I have never heard of a dog doing THAT!! Sometime in the face if they get too close, but not on the butt
@HeyTammyBruce Yes, I agree, but you are right, it's cuz its Boxer. I don't really like her, but it's her right to ask for use of 'Senator'
@HeyTammyBruce Right, her right to be asked to be addressed as Senator, Gen was just following protocol w/ma'm not insulting her
@lgoddard It's just the excitement of being 22 is all.  That was not a 'senior' moment.
@BraveLad That the founders agreed on them and started from that platform. They were wise enough to know rest of pop would prob argue abt it

@dmiller23 How do you handle a budget shortfall for yourself? Borrow more money to pay off your debt?
@dmiller23 horrific mismanagement by who in CAL? Tax, borrow and spend, is the prob. LA has largest homeless population in America
@dmiller23 and it would cost about 3million to implement. Private dog rescue is better and more cost effective than public animal shelter
@dmiller23 Govt program cost at least 30% more to implement. Ashton Kutcher raised over $100,000 for malaria nets in 3 days, govt take 3 yrs

@BeaconOfLight It's cuz you are riding a motorcycle, think you'll be interested.  Sexist I know...
@dmiller23 If you reduce taxes and let ppl invest in US themselves, then yes, I agree. You expand tax base and encourage entrepreneurship

@MissMegRae I agree not industry standard, and I think she would too, but she is small enough to ensure her situation & that is what I read
@MissMegRae make that exceptions, and I do mean that as out of the ordinary
@MissMegRae Personally I think ranchers are great, but w/everything there are SOME expections. I think we can all improve on anything we do
@MissMegRae and I don't think she disagreed w/ you, just that there are other instances of that standard of care not being taken
@endangeredowner No she was saying that knifes get dull and can continue to be used which is not humane
@MissMegRae bad information can be a matter of opinion, her opinion is different than yours, you might want to re-read what she wrote
@MissMegRae I don't think U meant 2 but U came across as attacking her &	all she was saying is that her animals will be taken humanely
@MissMegRae I agree, but as in any aspect of life there are some bad apples, take Chino facility w/downer cows that wasn't rt for cow or ppl
@MissMegRae actually animal rights is getting to point that we can't even eat plants let alone steak or chicken!
@MissMegRae no, they don't even believe in eating animals at all, she was just saying humane way, not no to eating meat
@MissMegRae From what I read you didn't hear what @rosemont_farms was saying to U. U are on same page, slightly diff perspective
@MissMegRae U can't educate if your tone shuts people down @rosemont_farm is IN your industry, you shut her down How U reach Rad Ani Rights?

Referring to someone's "idea" as a "notion" has always seemed to me to be inferring it's a dumb idea. Or in oldster slang, a real put down.
