And her prosecutorial experience is legit-- violent felonies, murders, sex crimes-- she's like all the Law &amp; Order shows wrapped into one https://t.co/naKBdnLvsU
And if you didn't already know, her tagline "@KamalaHarris For the People" comes from her time as a prosecutor- the phrase is what prosecutors say when they are before a judge
But I have to say the book was pretty good- at first I thought it was a little thesisy -- lots of facts and figures.. but in the end I realzed @KamalaHarris was "showing me the math"
At first, I wasn't sure I was going to get into it.. I had just finished Becoming @MichelleObama -- and come on, what book can follow that?
walking thru the hospital, she saw other patients alone "I left that experience convinced that no one should have to face a hospital stay without support-- and that many do."
‚Äúthe hard truth of life is that every one of us will go thru an experience like this sooner or later, whether it is coming to terms with a loved one‚Äôs mortal illness or experiencing our own.‚Äù
When she talked about her mother's battle with colon cancer @KamalaHarris shared the pain, worry, depression, fear families face when they find out a loved one is sick
For each candidate, I am also looking for personal experiences that connect them to #paidfamilyleave
‚ÄúWhen you show people the math, you give them the tools to decide whether they agree with the solution. And even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything, they may find that the agree with you most of the way.‚Äù
Her book aligns with her "showing the math" approach and does a good job describing how she thinks

INCYMI: @SenateFinance reshuffled their subcommittees - https://t.co/UUl3TTwi86
"It should provide the slightest comfort to an innocent child suffering from cancer to know their loved one is by their side, holding their hand, approaching the battle together."
"A national paid family leave policy must go beyond parental leave to caregiving leave for all members of a family including one‚Äôs self in a time of need."
"Without access to paid leave, significant life events such as the birth of a child, sickness or death of a loved one and one‚Äôs own health become intense mental and physical struggles between responsibility and necessity."
"Only 16 percent of private-sector workers have access to any paid family leave (only 60 percent have access to any unpaid leave), leaving 84 percent to make impossible choices between financial security and caregiving responsibilities."

"framing work-family conflict as a problem of imbalance is merely an individualized way to justify a nation of mothers engulfed in stress. It fails to recognize how institutions contribute to this anxiety."
"The highest-income earners in the United States are 3.5 times as likely to have access to paid family leave as those at the bottom of the pay scale."
