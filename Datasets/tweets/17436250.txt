Some context on how Trump‚Äôs view of investigation has changed: In March 2017, when Russia investigation was less of political issue and Mueller hadn‚Äôt been appointed, Trump was more comfortable with FBI looking at associates‚Äô ties to Russia, according to Comey memo at the time. https://t.co/y4151xppXf

In the Yates meeting with McGahn, McGahn asked Yates if there were problems with Flynn interview and she refused to answer. McGahn asked Yates whether Flynn should be fired and she said it was not her place. Based on what DOJ knew that day, they charged Flynn today.
Dox released raise BIG?s about Yates meeting with McGahn. Based on dox, DOJ had enough on day of that meeting to charge Flynn. But Yates never told McGahn that, according to her Cong testimony. If she had, WH would have been forced to fire him bc fed offense violated clearance.

sources tell me sepp blatter is not among the fifa officials who are being arrested
concierge is getting bombarded with phone calls here in the lobby. sounds like press calling. his english isn't great.
Swiss agent just walked out of hotel with two bags of evidence

(2 of 2) but that doesnt make much sense. my guess is that majority of agents and officers came on after 9/11 and ss went into dhs
(1 of 2) some discussion among reps about how morale was hurt when secret service left treasury and is still bad, in part, because of it
clancy says he would ideally like a similar structure to the wh at ss training facility so his agents, officers and dogs can train on it
lots of interest still in @SecretService jobs. clancy says that 45,000 people applied for most recent openings. only 72 were hired, tho.
chaffetz says ss has major morale problem. doesnt cite his metrics, tho.
chaffetz says that secret service has mislead public on purpose
in reality, jumper got much farther and had small knife on him
ss initially said that jumper got inside north door and search of body turned up no weapons
chaffetz is going after statement that secret service put out on the day of the fence jumper
chaffetz, the new house oversight committee chairman, takes the mic ..
rep cohen with huge joke: "this guy further into the white house than many of my republican colleagues have gotten."
"would a moat, water, six feet around, be attractive and effective?" rep cohen asked clancy. clancy says maybe. #househumor
uniformed division officers arent supposed to climb over the fence with the fence jumper, clancy says
on 1st week on job, interim ss director walked white house grounds and inside to see security set up for himself
when julia pierson testified before the house she had many agents and officers sitting behind her. clancy has less than a handful today.
clancy says that because of staffing shortages field offices send agents to support presidential protections
"when we're not properly trained we fail," clancy said.
rep bobby scott questioning clancy about budget cuts. clancy says that uniformed division is understaffed and diffcult to train them.
(2 of 2) apparently @RepGoodlatte didn't see video. jumper stopped and was easily taken down. reforms had anything little to do with it.

two of the secret service dogs that attacked the fence jumper were injured and are on their way to the vet.
