@charlie_whiting you're welcome and thank you sir, Look forward to your hilarious tweets coming up soon. #F12013 Melbourne, in only 10 days
@charlie_whiting sometimes, that is true. Too often actually. We are not far apart here.
@charlie_whiting Let the people involved determine whats best, if fans hate it, they'll leave or not watch and the sport will adapt or fail
@charlie_whiting I don't like reactionary attitudes though, and that's why I started at you.Kinda like all the impromptu rules the FIA does
@charlie_whiting Sometimes, when an event becomes political or brings attn to a cause, it's a good thing.Sometimes. We'll see if this is one
@charlie_whiting yes, but that's kind of unfair because they are not against ANY changes. But, that gets into the minutia of it.
@charlie_whiting Sure. Like how Bahrain became about the situation in Bahrain and not about the snoozer of races that we've had there
@charlie_whiting We can have a right vs wrong issue outside of the race track,but if a group who means no harm or ill towards others buys in
@charlie_whiting Or, any other cause that worked out a deal w/ a motorsport group and their cause was not offense towards humanity.
@charlie_whiting Yes
@charlie_whiting No, I accept that politics are in everything and I support some of them. I also support the free market.
@charlie_whiting That's what the #NRA does. I like that and so do the majority of #NASCAR fans, of which I am absolutely NOT one.I hate it.
@charlie_whiting It's different when the specific politics involved have fundamental human rights at their core and are supportive of them
@charlie_whiting I spoke up about the Bahrain bs, #F1 should not have been there. Politics hurt the sport and the sport hurt the people.
@charlie_whiting quit w/ the insults man, it's unnecessary and counter productive. And, politics is everywhere and in everything,even sports
@charlie_whiting By supporting said Right, they are protecting the basic human right of self defense.They are also #1 educator in gun safety
@charlie_whiting Understood, this is not like the F1/Bahrain situation at all. The #NRA is simply a group which supports our 2ndAmendment
@charlie_whiting the right to defend yourself is not "crap". If they had such a right in Bahrain,&amp; other Human Rights, life would be better

@tbg2000 I caution you, once you watch #bbc or #skyf1 , you won't be able to stand #Speed or whatever it is that #nbc is going to try.
@tbg2000 Though it means a delay, I get the practices, qualy, races and postrace in HD, by using p2p. #skyf1 is epic good stuff, man.
@tbg2000 I torrent most of them, or use live streaming services such as Justin.tv, ustream, vipbox.tv, etc. but torrenting is my preference
@tbg2000 if you've never watched a race commented on by the Euro-based broadcasters,then you're really missing out.I can't go back to #Speed
@tbg2000 no thanks, I'll watch the real gear heads broadcast it and other races on channels like SkyF1, EuroSport, and ITV.
@tbg2000 maybe the alphabet channels should show the #nba and #nfl seasons that way, wouldn't that be great?
