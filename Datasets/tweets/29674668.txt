discussions in North America about massacres and enslavement tend to start after 1789.  This omission of colonial transgressions between 1493 and 1776 distorts honesty about everyone from those periods.		Hope this brief thread strengthens my links to them warlike Caribs.
Blacks are being decimated for pronouncing the letters P A L E S T I N E.  	The same evil that profited from their enslavement now carries on as though a few generations ago, Blacks were not enslaved by Jewish Massas and MeyFraus.	And this seems to work because
And as if that needed boosting, people of these regions, who are of darker hues and or no outwardly connection to some European, are now permitted to associate with Jewish religion.   The gatekeepers twist themselves to ensure 'that is rasta,  right?' 	And now in North America
Africans as others, the references are being presented as people who fled seeking refuge.  	Meanwhile,  the propaganda of dehumanizing Aboriginal Americans who fought as savage, war-like cannibals continues like the first hallowed gospel from an ancient prayer book.
Regarding the Caribbean, islands and mainland, there's amended tales being slowly slid forward as HIStory.	Instead of admitting that Ladinos, European Jews passing as Catholic, and Jews outright were as prominent in the massacre and enslavement of Aboriginals and Imported
just like the old thing about Blacks being children of Ham.  		(lest we forget how many Massas and MeyFraus were Jewish)		I know.  I know.  It may have just been because Xtians needed to rent slaves to work Sundays. https://t.co/CpnkKEht7p
