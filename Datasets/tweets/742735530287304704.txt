Americans know, the world knows, Kim Jong-un knows, and most importantly, the Warmbier family knows that Otto suffered a cruel death inflicted by a brutal regime serving Kim Jong-un. Perhaps they will change course, but until they can clearly treat people differently, "No deal".
Otto Warmbier didn't die from working too hard. He died because he was mistreated by North Korea's leaders. Improving our relationship begins with N. Korea improving how they treat others. The President's reaction today shows where we are in the negotiation process. No deal.
@BillKristol Why did the @weeklystandard cease advocating FOR conservative principles and focus almost exclusively on a #NeverTrump brand? TDS? @BillKristol TDS? Sure, there are things that differentiate conservatives and the Administration (or Congress for that matter), but what happened?
@chemsmith Scholarships are also common. I'll skip the insult.
Employers could grow faster, but consistently say they face worker shortages for skilled trades and significant skills gaps. Meanwhile, #OH08 has great career technical+STEM education and abundant apprenticeships. I spoke with one who was only 20 y/o making $24/hr - with $0 debt.
It juices current consumption of education, but crowds out future consumption. Burdened with debt by graduation, these students are delaying consumption that has historically driven our economy. Cars, marriage, homes, kids... Lastly, the artifical demand has skewed the workforce.
Combine easy money, low consumer education on risk of default, no price discovery, and artificial demand for 4-year degrees and you get massive tuition inflation. This not only hurts consumers, it is also a massive wealth transfer from the rest of the economy to education.
Consequently, a student can go just as deeply into debt regardless of major, job prospects, risk of default (expected ability to repay), at the same interest rate. Private lenders refinance the high-credit, employed graduates at lower rates because their risk of default is lower.
Business loans work better b/c the government is not the dominate player with artificial rates. An interest rate consists of two parts: time value of money and default risk. Federal student loans are at fixed rates, with no price discovery on rate, and limited borrower education.
Student debt is a real problem, but more FREE stuff is not the solution. I have met people with millions of dollars in business loans. That is crazy! "Small businesses create jobs, so we have got to make business loans free with no expectation of repayment" - said no one EVER. https://t.co/QzKE59E4y4

HR 372 - Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017 passed on 3/22/2017. By a vote of 416 - 7, the House passed a bill to end the antitrust exemptions health insurance companies exploit. As yourself, why won't the Senate vote? Then ask your Senator.  	https://t.co/MUoa4IDVTW
America's healthcare costs are high because of the absence of market forces, not their presence. Price controls, subsidies, antitrust exemptions, regulatory barriers... drive out competition &amp; drive up costs. To solve these problems, Congress needs a focused healthcare committee.
America's healthcare economy is broken. Single-payer is not the solution, but neither is single-provider. Both abandon market forces. That's why the House passed HR372 last March - to end the antitrust exemptions health insurers exploit. The Senate needs to pass this bill!!! https://t.co/QdfCRTboqt

We must compassionately fix our broken immigration system &amp; secure the border. The failed policies of previous administrations have catered to open border radicals and left Americans less free, less safe, and more burdened by debt.
While our immigration system may be broken, America is not. We are the world’s land of opportunity and will always welcome the free flow of goods, services, people, ideas, and capital in a way like no other country does. However, border security is national security.
Border security is national security. Enforcement is not optional. Open border radicals will #resist any such policy. The status quo is broken and they consistently show their only objective is no border enforcement.

...focused on the FISA program.  Since the program itself is essential, it is vital that the American people know its purpose is pure, those who operate it remain above reproach, and the structure provides adequate accountability to Constitutionally sustain America’s confidence.
The FBI and others may be able to save some face by helping to hold individual bad actors accountable. If instead they close ranks and refuse, given the divisions in Congress and among the American people, Attorney General Sessions may need to appoint a separate special counsel.

@2tonetony50 However, we have waited since 10/1/2017 to #FundAmerica and it is truly hurting our national security to delay implementation of funding that is broadly agreed upon as necessary.
@2tonetony50 Actually, I prefer that the Senate restore the fillibuster. Current rule is 3/5ths of members eligible (60 votes). Prior to 1975 the rule was 2/3 of members present. This kept them on the floor and made them work on the issue without being able to shift to a different topic.
#Amen The real deadline was 10/1/2017. These delays have kept our national security weaker. Funding levels for Defense passed House and Senate by wide margins, yet these delays in implementation (over DACA amnesty) have caused extension after extension. Now #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/Ye5meFh5Z9
#SchumerShutdown Just to be clear, the bill before the Senate is only an extension of funding until February. The actual deadline was 10/1/2017. Extension after extension, now a shutdown, just to appease them. Their tactics were already harming America... #FundAmerica https://t.co/CIYGiZ64AP
#NoAmnesty Democrats know that amnesty will not pass on merit, so they have resorted to these tactics. Meanwhile, Defense funding delayed since 10/1/2017.
