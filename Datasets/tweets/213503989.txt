@rscspokenword MN has also been starting games a lot better this year. Even with a strong team overall last year, they always had slow starts. The mix of players - even in the same system- can really swing things.
@rscspokenword Agreed. Definitely not a fan of the long ball. I‚Äôve just gotten more used to processing these feelings as the Big Ten schedule grinds games down a bit toward the end of the year.
@rscspokenword Right. But sometimes players aren‚Äôt patient for the whole game :) 		INSERT PREVIOUS TWEET
@rscspokenword The funny thing is Mn has had several games this year where they possess and pass super well for 70-80 minutes throughout the game and still lose even after dominating play. Others where it‚Äôs scrappy and no rhythm but they find a way to pull it off.
@rscspokenword My limited sense is that even teams like MN that typically possess well drift into the direct long ball when long stretches of the game either don‚Äôt result in goals OR the other team is so compact that they feel like it‚Äôs only way to break the defense‚Äôs shape.

@JoeDeMay Sorry for all the back and forth. I‚Äôll try to make it down for a game this fall where we can talk in person and tone/meaning don‚Äôt have as much gray area!
https://t.co/eER7aLaZqn
@JoeDeMay At this point, I'm honestly sorry I tweeted it. To be honest, this has easily been the most draining interaction I've had since writing about women's soccer and I'm glad it's not like this when interacting with literally anyone else. https://t.co/3MTr6hH5in
To clarify, this tweet was meant to demonstrate how absurdly little investment there is in women's soccer compared to the men's side. It was not meant to belittle the women's game. https://t.co/2In7TccuUM
@JoeDeMay Joe. At a certain point facts are facts. Compared to property running MLS club, it IS really cheap to property run an NWSL club. That is a fact. It's not a matter of opinion.
@JoeDeMay I write about, elevate, and spread the word about women's soccer for free because I passionately believe in the quality of play we already have in MN and the support/attention these players deserve. Just because I don't do it in the exact way you wish I did, doesn't make it wrong
@JoeDeMay It is matter of fact that the scales of investment in mens and women's soccer are incredibly disproportionate. I called that out to show out far we have to go in support players in the women's game compared to the money we throw around at mens players who are "worth it".
@JoeDeMay Joe, it‚Äôs fine. But I‚Äôm not sure what else ‚Äúfeeding into negative connotations‚Äù would mean.
@JoeDeMay Wow. I know I‚Äôm newer than you/others but I‚Äôd hope I‚Äôve built enough credibility for people not to assume I‚Äôm trash talking women‚Äôs soccer.
@JoeDeMay @TempleofLoon Ok. Sorry. To clarify: I thought the tone of my initial tweet was clear enough to show that it was tongue in cheek and not meant as a formal proposal for a sports franchise. My recommendation for an NWSL team will not be made in a tweet about failed MLS signings.
@JoeDeMay @TempleofLoon I mean, I understand it takes actual resources and don‚Äôt want anything done just to do it. But the amount of money blown on just the mistakes at the MLS level could essentially fund the basics of an expansion NWSL team.

You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it. Check out her policy positions. Learn about her story. See who else supports her. 		Trust me. @mitrajnelson‚Äôs passion, experience, and vision will make her a fantastic addition to the St Paul City Council. 	https://t.co/2sO9R01yjc
.@mitrajnelson is a lifelong Minnesotan. Like many of us who have made St Paul our permanent home in the last decade, she didn‚Äôt necessarily go to grade school with Joe Mauer.		But she knows how to engage people who have been left behind by traditional politics for WAY too long.
Saying someone can‚Äôt play a role in shaping our community because they ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt lived here long enough‚Äù is essentially like saying ‚Äúno new families - or immigrants - should have any say in our community.‚Äù 		It‚Äôs an extreme and scary line of thinking for so many reasons.
People are responding to @mitrajnelson because she is listening to their concerns and suggestions and sharing her proactive vision for what St Paul could be. 		Her experience working at all levels of government makes her capable of connecting dots others may not connect.
On ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt have the expertise‚Äù:		Local politics and policy is really complicated. But @mitrajnelson is one of the sharpest people I‚Äôve ever met in terms of synthesizing complicated policy issues into real world situations and working with actual human people to address it.
On ‚Äúshe owes everything to the mayor‚Äù:		By the time Melvin endorsed Mitra just before the Ward 4 convention, her team already had roughly 85 delegates committed and only needed roughly 100 total. They had flat out outworked every other campaign.
Attacks throughout the Ward 4 race have so many sexist/racist/ageist undertones that it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. 		As someone who has seen @mitrajnelson and her team work up close, let me clear this up for Paul and all the other people on an uneducated smear campaign. 		(Thread) https://t.co/UGy2IK3DLm
She‚Äôs worked on critical issues like housing and knows what it takes to get stuff done. Her balance of personal touch and sharp intellectual curiosity is absolutely fantastic. @TristaMatas is exactly the kind of voice we need at the Ramsey County Board. 		Vote Trista on Aug 14th!

It‚Äôs one thing for Calvo to ask fans to be more supportive. But asking fans to not even **compare** one player who replaces another is bonkers. He‚Äôs basically asking fans to offer full throated support and investment without ever having their own thoughts. https://t.co/fbP1utVhgs

@MNCoachGolan @alipsher @mlrouse6 @B_FLETCH_ER @sjsj2288 The question mark after SJ is what makes this. So good.
@katie_stp Agreed. There have been too many games where it seems like the coach - not the roster - actually cost the team a result. #HeathOut
@alexschief One of the most frustrating things about Heath is his pattern of using first sub at 70-ish minute, second sub at 80-ish minute, third sub unused. For a team with non-world class starters, it seems bonkers not to actually make changes/adjustments in-game and see how things go.

@aagreene87 Oh we got a second dog for that very reason. Now they mostly bug each other when they're going bonkers. Except now he's a big goon so she is no longer the boss.
@aagreene87 The only difference for our hyper pup is that she will stay out there until she's so tired that she literally lays on the ground panting and I have to carry her 50 pounds up the stairs, out of the park.

@stoatno1 @StudioDistills They're right by Urban Growler, I think.

@mikesonn To clarify, this is a super boiled down version of an answer to a very specific question. I wouldn‚Äôt take what I wrote to represent the whole position.
(Breakouts now where people can ask questions directly of staff. https://t.co/LXNToWUfhd has all the documents. End of live tweet)
Question: Any other big ideas to specifically mention?		- neighborhood nodes to help people walk places within 20 min in their neighborhood	- more focus on recreation programs and services rather than just physical parks
WATER:		- water supply, waste water, and surface water need to be managed	- but the plan operates at a high level	- set top level priorities that can guide future policies	- emphasis now on an integrated approach to water resource management. All our water management is connected
LAND USE:		- basically the whole chapter is new	- we had over 3000 comments on land use alone
HOUSING:		- ten years ago we were in the depths of the recession	- now it‚Äôs the opposite. 1% vacancy. High growth. 	- focus now on how do we manage new housing and actually acknowledge our renters and who is most vulnerable. Prioritizing housing security.
TRANSPORTATION:		- were prioritizing safety and equity first and access to jobs right after that	- prioritizing pedestrians and bikers first, with transit users next, then drivers	- we‚Äôve had tools before, but this really prioritizes our top goals
HERITAGE PRESERVATION:		- first time doing this kind of chapter in the comp plan. Want it to read more user friendly	- more emphasis on cultural preservation and not just historic preservation
Question: what‚Äôs different in your chapter than the existing plan?		PARKS: 	- to clarify this covers ALL parks. Not just city parks	- major developments like Ford and along green line are definitely new for this plan
Staff round table with leads from each planning chapter (Parks director filling in for parks planner). https://t.co/FgWtslqswd

‚ÄúOur disparities are the direct result of exclusionary political processes. The key to eliminating those disparities isn‚Äôt just passing policies.
