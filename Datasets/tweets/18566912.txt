Happy Birthday to my great friend, @VP Mike Pence! https://t.co/wTAMm6BtrQ
My iPad continues to be awash with reports that our national debt is unsustainable. This is just one more sobering reminder ‚Äì something that is unsustainable one day stops. There is only one solution and it is to reform entitlement programs for future beneficiaries.
Furthermore, for the first time in almost 40 years, Social Security‚Äôs cost will exceed its income. Both of these troubling reports are further evidence that as a nation we are continuing to spend money we do not have and we are passing the bill to future generations.
We have two ominous events occurring because of failing entitlement programs. A new report from the Medicare trustees projects that the Medicare‚Äôs Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted three years earlier than previously reported.
The Administration may be correct in claiming that the existing steel and aluminum tariffs have been helpful to some workers and jobs, but it‚Äôs hurt other businesses that use these metals. It‚Äôs going to be a tax on all consumers.
Protectionist policies typically are another version of crony capitalism with the government picking winners and losers.
I strongly disagree with the decision to move forward with the implementation of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Mexico, Canada, and the EU under the guise of national security concerns.
It is my sincere hope that you will take time to reflect upon the service of our fallen heroes. On this Memorial Day and every day, I ask that you join me in praying for those we have lost and their loved ones. #MemorialDay
There are not enough words to describe how grateful I am to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in the military. I am always reminded that freedom is not free, and it certainly cannot be taken for granted.
I again call upon the President and his administration to exercise extreme caution and focus on the nation states that violate the actual trade rules and force transfers of our technology and intellectual property.
All of the great gains President Trump has made with generational tax relief and bureaucratic regulatory reforms ‚Äì the reforms that are fueling our economy ‚Äì can be wiped out overnight if we end up in a global trade war.
Trade laws designed to uphold critical national security measures should never be used as an excuse for raw protectionism.
The Honda Accord is not a threat to our national security. However, taxing it with trade tariffs is a threat to the economic security of millions of hardworking American families.

This is a powerfully historic moment in time. Along with the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs rightful and eternal capital, the dedication ceremony that took place is an enormous milestone in history not only for Israel but for America as well.
.@POTUS sent a clear message. He is ready to take a different direction &amp; put America‚Äôs nat'l security interests 1st. I stand by our President &amp; his decision to withdraw from the bad Iran deal &amp; seek a meaningful agreement w/ Iran that will ensure a long-term solution, stability.
It is an understatement to say we cannot afford a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. President Obama made a dangerous agreement packed with serious shortcomings ‚Äì it was a good deal for Iran and not a good deal for the American people.
Most of all, Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. Furthermore, the deal is dangerously flawed as it expires and seemingly did not shut off Iran‚Äôs path to a nuclear weapon. A deal in need of a permanent solution was answered with temporary measures, and that is unacceptable.
From the beginning, Iran has not followed the spirit of the so-called ‚Äònuclear‚Äô deal. They call for the annihilation of our ally, Israel. They continue to develop and test missiles.

This Tax Day is a historic one, as Congress and the White House successfully worked together to fix our broken system. #TaxDay https://t.co/CNpqBwVBsr
Consumer confidence is up, jobless claims are down, and customers in at least 39 states are seeing lower utility bills. While some benefits will not be realized until next year, over four million people are already seeing bonuses in their paychecks.
Next year, we will see the individual health care mandate disappear, 90 percent of Americans will see greater take-home pay, and the standard deduction will nearly double because of #TaxReform.
While our citizens are still coping with the headaches and frustration of the outdated 32-year-old tax code, they can rest assured that a new day is on the horizon.
This time next year, many Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form much simpler than the one they are having to deal with this tax season.
