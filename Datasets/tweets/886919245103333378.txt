@jayanwana @owhonda_henry laughs
@owhonda_henry @jayanwana If u know u know, you a very young person to me both intellectually and otherwise and you should be appreciative to have got me chatting with you. What is your profile none. but check my page and read about me. If i had know you r partisan i wud not chat u.
@jayanwana @owhonda_henry Its unfortunate. Every Buharist is the same always turning sentences upside down. Who did this to Nigeria.
@owhonda_henry @jayanwana Also there in the absence of the chairman what happens? the meeting shall be chaired by anyone selected by simple majority. Read very well sir. Hunger of the brain is more terrible than my own hunger for food. laughs
@owhonda_henry @jayanwana I have seen that you dont deserve my conversation. Even after reading the paragraphs sent in by @jayanwana you still argue. You read only one line read all sir and stop disgracing intellectual discourse and maybe yourself if u care
@owhonda_henry @jayanwana My dear brother dont argue what you dont know much about. the Judiciary is an institution with internal democracy one of the most functional in Nigeria. Mr President went too far. @jayanwana @MobilePunch @THISDAYLIVE @Kennedy4Aha
@owhonda_henry @jayanwana @owhondd_henry you still doubting that its not possible for NJC to meet without the CJN
@owhonda_henry Have you now seen that with or without CJN the NJC can convey a meeting?
@jayanwana @owhonda_henry You see its possible for NJC to meet without the chief justice? So due process is due process anywhere in d world
@YIAGA @inecnigeria Especially for FCT that i am interested in
@YIAGA @inecnigeria Let there be follow up on INEC because what is on ground is more than what they have published here
@owhonda_henry You think so? Outsiders have many thing to do with us ooo. even our economy is hinged on d performance of same outsiders dollars. we signed a chatter with the international organizations and nations of the world
@owhonda_henry to reinstate him means due process has to be followed. thats exactly the point i want u to understand. now we r clear
@owhonda_henry E.U is saying NO	U.S.A is saying NO	UK is saying NO	NBA is saying NO	Supreme Court justices are saying NO	National Assembly is saying NO	Femi Falana is saying NO	Nigeria Civil Society is saying NO	How come you are saying YES
@owhonda_henry Your position is good for not supporting any politician. i am one anyway. But please do also support rule of law and due process as a 21st century citizen in a global space. support credible people to govern. Its nice having a chat with you sir. God bless you
@owhonda_henry NO no no thats a wrong perception. this issue does not have much awareness by the down trodden, its we the elites that refuse to accept the fact that Onoghen is like Ganduje, like several others who are now saints by partisanship. we must rise to save our nation
@owhonda_henry If you are not biaselely biased, you would have known that our democracy is under pressure. What happened to d monkey that took money from a farm, ok d snake that took money from jamb office, ok how much have EFCC recovered?
@owhonda_henry He that proclaims justice must come with clean hands. Who is clean in Nigeria? Especially all the past and most current government officials. ok some are saints by partisanship abi? Lets challenge the status quo for the good of future. cheers
@owhonda_henry Read and understand our constitution pls. No man is capable of holding down government institution. There is check for each office including that of Mr President. Its constitutional sir
@owhonda_henry That you speak to my feelings does not negate the fact that great injustice has bedeviled this country with strong visibility in this administration. who knows who has food but you are not better than thousands of pple in front of NBA hqtrs now
@owhonda_henry i dont understand it when u keep saying he is playing games. if u have ever witness a court sitting you will understand that confession does not in any away affect judgement.
@owhonda_henry I believe you are also a promising young Nigeria, and i bet you if we continue to celebrate disorderliness in our institutions, then future will be tough for us.  If u listened to Falana on channels, he accepted that both the presidency and the CCT is wrong in their approach
@owhonda_henry Do you if he is in the right state of mind when he made any statement you claim, and that confession as you mentioned does not stop due process and rule of law in discharging judgement.
@owhonda_henry So you now tell me that because Onoghen is the Chairman he can hold NJC for 1 year assuming he is not suspended? Please my dear fellow citizen, NJC has a panel of high ranking justices who can meet and effect a suspension not Mr President.
@owhonda_henry Listen to yourself. If NJC have the the power to appoint and disappoint, then what kind of game can their subject play? Let the executive exempt their power from judiciary and that is true democracy as practiced most places in the world sir
@owhonda_henry You cant say he did not declare his assets until judgement comes after investigation. Moreover how come this is cropping up barely 3 weeks to National Election. Its unfortunate and its a pity the foundations of our cherished democracy is gradually cracking
@GovAyoFayose His Excellency where are you/ these people wants to bury true democracy and i know you as the mouth piece of the common people. You can empower me to go public in a dramatic dimension.
Who have never been involved in corruption among all those actors both in APC and PDP? Though i heard Oshiomole said peoples sins are forgiven when they join APC. I am a proponent of due process. We have to give independence to Judiciary https://t.co/1UVkR2mfVL

This is totally unacceptable. This is the fasted judgement i have ever seen in the history of Nigeria, a top government official in such capacity as the Chief Justice being suspended without due constitutional process. It means the foundation of our democracy is cracking. too bad
