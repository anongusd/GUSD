Conor Lamb supporters can and should breathe a sigh of relief as this will be quite a feat for Saccone to overcome.  		Conor Lamb will win by at least 500-1000 votes when all is said and done.  You heard it here first!  #ConorLambForCongress #VoteLamb #ConorLamb
With only 3,000 absentee ballots outstanding in Washington, Westmoreland, and Greene counties and with Saccone only ahead in those counties by 53-57%, Saccone would need to capture greater than 63% of the outstanding absentee ballots to overcome Conor Lamb.  		That all said...
