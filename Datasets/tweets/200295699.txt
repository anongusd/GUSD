@GasBuddyDan Any sense Dan of how long it might take before stations are back up to their normal schedule of being full of gas for customers? I have readers wondering. Thanks

@GasBuddyDan Hi Dan. Would like to ask you why Markham gas stations are having trouble keeping gas in stock.

#Markham Still waiting on the online results, but @frankscarpitti has made entrance and, with huge paper ballot lead, it's clear he will win going away. Cites accomplishments, thanks volunteers to appreciative crowd. https://t.co/4Csplhj9Yw
#Markham While we wait for the online ballot results to come in Markham check out this @frankscarpitti from the past! Oh for the days of Madonnna's Like a Virgin! https://t.co/gVCK4paxqj
#Markham Still waiting for the guest of honour to show up at Le Parc on Leslie Street in Thornhill. Just have paper ballots to go on so far and @frankscarpitti is up by 4258 to 1182 for Steven Chen. 3 other candidates way back.
@lisaaqueen @TownofNewmarket Good luck with that! Just have the paper ballots so far in Markham
#Markham Most interesting ward races could be 5 and 7 where multiple candidates are battling it out. Andrew Keyes @awkeyes has a decent lead over a field of 13 in Ward 5 where @Ward5Councillor Colin Campbell chose not to run. In Ward 7, Khalid Usman @kusman786 has slight edge.
#MarkhamVots In Ward races, only sure things appear to be @karenrea2 who is whipping the competition in Ward 4 and looks like she will return and newcomer Isa Lee who has a big lead in Ward 8 in race to replace longtime councillor Alex @ChiuWard8
#Markham Frank @frankscarpitti off to a huge lead in Markham. 5-way race for 4 regional council seats should be tight all night. Don Hamilton trying to break through with Jack Heath, Joe Li, Jim Jones and Nirmala Armstrong.

@Sensiablue Elderly folks who do have the flu are better off going to 24-hour urgent care instead of overcrowded emergency rooms
@Sensiablue Part of the idea is to keep the elderly folks from getting the flu, if they don't have it, from those who bring it to emerg.
@KathyRoman Public opinion is harsh. And those named could be punished by bosses, spouses, etc. Tough situation. All part of the issue
#fluseason #hospital #emergency https://t.co/Q3NKcQowtX DON'T go to hospital emergency room if you have the flu https://t.co/OeeNhoW2CF
@KathyRoman 2/2 So why not those charged with drunk driving too? Also it seems to be on rise, so publicity could help reduce it maybe.
@KathyRoman 1/2 All I can say is that we publish, and police do to, those charged with other crimes too, not just those convicted.
@KathyRoman Is this in reference to York Regional Police name and shame plan for drunk driving?
