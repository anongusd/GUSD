Does a person's behavior not count as evidence? By your logic, do cops who investigate if a driver is drunk based on a swerving car not following evidence but instead an extrajudicial "feeling"? The investigation can be fair AND @POTUS could end up innocent. #TrustTheProcess https://t.co/kMvvuF6wLN

If I were a member of #congress, I wouldn't clap or stand for anything between the @POTUS's entrance and exit for the #SOTU.   Too much emphasis on inconsequential gestures of partisanship. Easier to just sit and listen.
We still think @realDonaldTrump only ended the #shutdown to distract the news cycle from #RogerStone...
@realDonaldTrump didn't end the #ShutDown today because of @SpeakerPelosi or political pressure. He ended it TODAY because of #RogerStone being indicted. Trump knows he'll get flack for caving, but he prefers that we talk about that and not Stone. That really says something.

3/ ...@ewarren does what we would expect any #Democratic candidate to do: criticize @POTUS and lay out an alternative. But voters should demand more. Policy should begin with vision, not simply contrasting the political opposition.

@HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems should propose a plan that includes funding for the REAL solutions. Until then, @realDonaldTrump gets to use the #BorderWall as a prop for better messaing. @TheDemocrats can win over the #AmericanPeople, if they proposed a better solution.
Let's talk about drugs being smuggled through legal ports of entry. Let's talk about immigrants overstaying visas and staying here illegally. Let's talk about helping countries which are so unsafe for their citizens that those citizens come here and seek asylum.
@TheDemocrats are blowing this. #BorderSecurity is a real issue, but #TheWall is not a real solution. It's a wasteful and inefficient plan that won't solve the real problems while instead serving as a hateful symbol (and symbols matter).	https://t.co/hqPADW1CZ2

New boss, @DepSecDef, pointing at #China is not surprising. In fact, focus on China is pretty bipartisan. @BarackObama wanted to pivot towards #Asia, and #TPP was meant to counter China's economic rise. https://t.co/pcmIhEOFfv
Wonky, but important to know. Pay-Go = laws be paid for by revenues (taxes) or spending cuts elsewhere. Cut-Go = laws be paid for only by spending cuts (risks cutting into important programs). Cut-Go stays if rules don't pass.		https://t.co/BjLHAzVWlM
Could mean continued quagmire in the #MiddleEast... could mean standing by our #Kurdish allies, who are viewed as terrorists by #Turkey and would likely be attacked... could also mean a lot about any resurgence (or lack thereof) of #ISIS	https://t.co/1C6tMmZtbk

No matter your opinion, @SenWarren entering the #2020 race is good for everyone for one simple reason: She has ideas worth discussing. We might not end up choosing them, but we will undoubtedly learn a lot by talking about them.
There's a push towards #socialism on the left, but one could also argue that we need to reclaim "natural" #capitalism. The capitalism that has been uneven and unfair isn't true capitalism. It's been corrupted by cronyism. Political reform would go hand in hand w/ economic reform. https://t.co/yyQBgT1oHa
And if it were @HillaryClinton's emails and Dems were this, wouldn't @RudyGiuliani declare support for law enforcement doing a careful and thorough job? We say support law enforcement doing its job (w/ fair oversight, of course) no matter who is being investigated. https://t.co/NiCu2oTzsC
Absolutely correct. #climatechange is 100% a matter of #NationalSecurity (among other things). Responding to natural disasters, food shortages, spread of diseases, and population displacement suck up money, resources, and leave us less secure. https://t.co/S2vuPNx7nN

If gov employees start financially struggling in this #GovernmentShutdown, that says a lot about the state of personal finances in America. Everyone needs to be prepared with at least a few months worth of expenses for emergencies. Shutdown still inexcusable, though!

Don't fear the #stockmarketcrash. Ups and downs are perfectly normal. If you're worried about your money, then you were too aggressive in your asset allocation to begin with. Set it and forget it, depending on when you need it.
The original intent of these companies was to empower individuals by putting underutilized economic resources (ex. idle cars) to use. They weren't meant to be full time employment opportunities. Whether or not we treat them as such is a big part of the future of work. https://t.co/GbTZaq8muf

This is absolutely NOT true. Many illegal immigrants overstay legal visas, and most drugs smuggled by cartels sneak through legal ports of entry. Physical barriers are appropriate in some places, but technology is key. #BorderSecurity is necessary, but #TheWall won’t cut it. https://t.co/z9vJ5eCD1r
Wishing everyone a joyous #Festivus! With a #GovernmentShutdown there may be lots of grievances to air, but never doubt the feats of American strength! #FestivusForTheRestOfUs
Let's remember that @realDonaldTrump tends to eventually side with the last person he speaks to. The power struggle here might not be between R's and D's, but among @gop lawmakers and the direction of their party. https://t.co/zCHtbvcMLG
No matter your feelings on ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩, this should be alarming. The Office of the President should never be able to get involved in such investigations. If he’s innocent, let it be proven in court. https://t.co/JTeU1iBDnG
Like many fights, this #GovernmentShutdown is @TheDemocrats vs the @GOP. But it should be #Congress vs @POTUS. Voters need to remember that reps in Congress don't work for the president. #ProcessMatters
When it comes to #ForeignPolicy, the key question is: What ensures the safety and opportunity of #Americans at home and abroad? Do the #SyriaWithdrawal and now #Afghanistan withdrawal expand or detract from our safety and opportunities?

We propose eliminating all primary debates for both @DNC and @GOP. Rather than attack fellow party members for sound bites, we suggest interviewing (town hall?) all candidates to discuss qualifications and ideas. Those are plenty to distinguish candidates. https://t.co/8uyeSEJzS8
#Mattis's resignation marks a turning point in the #TrumpAdministration. @POTUS promoted all the military people with whom he surrounded himself (Mattis, Flynn, McMaster, Kelly) and they are all out or on the way out. Simply put, @realDonaldTrump is shifting gears.
A #Government shutdown is not a parliamentary tool to get stuff included in legislation. If people want a #BorderWall, great. But there is a right way and a wrong way to get it done. Process matters. #Governance
The question to ask: Are Americans safer at home and abroad with troops in #Syria? Let's evaluate the plan through that lens. https://t.co/SLcf5XYK0e
Our purpose here is simply to educate voters on what's happening. What we described was the legal mechanism used. If voters disagree, they should vote accordingly. If voters don't think the change is legitimate, they should vote accordingly.
Understanding how the #TrumpAdministration can legally enact a #BumpStockBan w/out #Congress. Machine guns are already illegal under fed law. The @TheJusticeDept expanded the definition of machine guns to include #BumpStocks 'cause they turn other guns into de facto machine guns.
If there's one thing voters should take away from the delay in the #FlynnSentencing, it's that our public officials must be held to the highest of standards.
#Apple ripping on @facebook over privacy and data goes to show the social pressure tech companies are under. If non-monetary attributes are deemed valuable by consumers (i.e., user privacy), they become part of the overall market forces. #capitalism
@amazon takes $1.5 billion in incentives to open up in NYC, and then @Google expands its NYC presence w/out incentives. NYC offers both companies talent and resources. It begs the question: why do local reps bend over backward when companies want to move to those spots anyway?
We need to face the harsh truth: previous generations sold us out. Revenues must go up and spending must go down. Financial insolvency may well be one of America's gravest threats...
And while spending keeps increasing, revenues keep decreasing (2017 tax cuts). #Deficit is now huge, but we need more money for #infrastructure #defense #healthcare and more... But we're already spending 8% of all spending on interest alone!!
#Americans need to understand how the federal #budget works. We face a huge problem from gov spending, but the problems are benefits we all get (like #SocialSecurity and #medicare) https://t.co/8xjZ05aqOj via @BrookingsInst

We can expect #GunControl and the #2ndAmendment to play big roles in 2020 (shocker, I know). A lot regarding this topic can be done at the state and local level. It's worth asking: How likely do you think it is another #SandyHook could happen in your town? https://t.co/HTW7aVjJKE
