LTG McMaster: Distance between Army and civilians is getting worse in part because of decreasing size of the force. #FPIForum
LTG HR McMaster recommends Hal Brands and Peter Feaver's response to calls for "offshore balancing." #FPIForum
LTG HR McMaster: There are no short-term solutions to long-term problems. #FPIForum
LTG McMaster: We need to be prepared to fight across a range of contingencies, and be able to adapt quickly to new circumstances  #FPIForum
LTG McMaster: I think there is an untapped willingness to serve in our country today. #FPIForum
LTG McMaster: The Army doesn't "man equipment," we "equip the man." That's our differential advantage. #FPIForum
LTG McMaster: Difficult to overstate threat from North Korea. Iran has been waging a proxy war against us since 1979. #FPIForum
LTG McMaster: Russia and China are engaged in a revisionist strategy to reshape the international order to fit their interests. #FPIForum
LTG HR McMaster: Wars resemble each other more than any other human activity. We have to understand why and how that is. #FPIForum
LTG HR McMaster: Some in academia don't want to study war because they confuse "study" with "advocating it." #FPIForum
.@MarkMoyar: Obama's waste of resources in the "civilian surge" in Afghanistan could have been averted if he looked to history. #FPIForum
.@MarkMoyar: The talk of "smart power" at the onset of the Obama admin was compelling, but results did not live up to billing, #FPIForum
Next at the #FPIForum: General McMaster talks about the importance of studying history for formulating strategy and policy today.

.@MaxBoot: Syria has become a horrific failure for US foreign policy + could have been averted w/action. But Obama didn't want to #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: Obama has presidef over the worst strategic + humanitarian conflict of the 21st century by trying to avoid intervention #FPIForum
RT @W7VOA: "Best thing I can say about @BarackObama is he didn't immediately carry out his campaign promises," says @MaxBoot. #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: If Obama wanted to keep US troops in Iraq in 2011, he could have - see the fact that we have 5,000 troops there now. #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: Great unraveling of Obama admin was the killing of bin Laden. No longer felt constrained to do what he wanted. #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: Obama did not follow Bush's example and push for a renewal of 6-party talks after North Korea's provocations. #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: Obama has been a bit of a born-again free trader. Knocked trade treaties early in admin, now a champion of them. #FPIForum
RT @whitneygrespin: "Allies are critical enablers... They are not window dressings" Mansoor #FPIForum
.@MaxBoot: There was global goodwill for Obama when he took office, but it's hard to see if he's achieved any of his objectives #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter's style and tactics, upset his base, alienated his potential allies, and foreign policy crises damaged him #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter was not as liberal as he was painted, and we did see a hardening of his stance post-Afghanistan invasion. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Pres. Carter was intellectually curious to a fault, but never wanted to understand how Washington works. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter's relationship with Congress began on the wrong foot and never recovered. Alienated Speaker Tip O'Neil. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter's holier-than-thou attitude was both innocent and arrogant. Proved to be amateurish. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter's pardoning of Vietnam War protesters fed into perception that he was anti-military. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter wasn't met with the plethora of foreign policy crises that we're used to, but also had to deal w/Soviets. #FPIForum
.@MarkOnDefense: Carter's style and tactics put him at odds not only with his adversaries, but also his allies. #FPIForum
.@MarkonDefense: If you go back to Carter's first 100 days, you could see the seeds of the end of his administration. #FPIForum
.@MarkonDefense: Carter is one of our least-studied presidents. His legacy discourages study. #FPIForum
.@Markondefense: There's a crisis in historical literacy in this country, and it's having a major impact on formulating policy. #FPIForum
Next at the #FPIForum, we'll have a panel discussion on what history tells us about the first 100 days of a presidency.

Gen Votel: I would describe the security situation in Afghanistan as an equilibrium in favor of the government. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: Afghanistan is a country worth fighting for, and I remain very hopeful for it. It's important to see this through. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: I would say there's been a bit of an uptick in Iran's regional malign behavior since @TheIranDeal was signed. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: The #JCPOA hasn't changed the Iranian regime's behavior. The other issues that we're concerned with still remain. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: Al Nusra is Al Qaeda, it's an organization that has long-term designs that we have to be concerned about. #FPIForum

Gen Votel: It will be a long fight in Mosul. Operations could last through the winter and into 2017. We'll move at the pace of our partners.
Gen Votel: The big idea in Iraq and Syria is to create momentum and pressure tactically, financially, politically. #FPIForum

Gen Votel: We're seeing both sides in Yemen trying to use military means to improve their leverage in political negotiations. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: We have to think transregionally. Threats along @CENTCOM's periphery have impact in the area, and have to be dealt with #FPIForum
Gen Votel: The mil-to-mil relationship with Egypt has remained fairly steady since the coup. #FPIForum
Gen Votel: We need to recognize the relationship we've had w/Egypt, their regional importance, and the challenges they face. #FPIForum

.@SenatorCardin: Russian cyberattack was not an attempt to elect anyone specifically, but to undermine faith in democratic process #FPIForum
.@SenatorCardin: Russia is undermining the boundaries of states, but also democratic institutions of states in its neighborhood. #FPIForum
We had some tech issues earlier, so here are some key tweets from our talk with Senator Ben Cardin:
Next up at the #FPIForum our discussion with Senator @BenSasse. FPI Board Member Eric Edelman will be moderating.
.@Benatworkdc: America’s research capability is one of the key differentiators for us. I’m worried that we’ll cut our seed corn. #FPIForum
.@RLHeinrichs: We have kept a lot of tech in limbo over the past several years. We need to bring it forward. #FPIForum
Rob Weiss: Cybersecurity is a top priority. It's a continuous challenge to keep advantage over those trying to steal our tech. #FPIForum
.@BenatWorkDC: The Army is its own worst enemy right now. It doesn't have a clear vision for what it needs to do. #FPIForum
.@BenatworkDC: BCA is irresponsible, but we need to think about what is a real portfolio investment strategy in all these areas. #FPIForum
.@RLHeinrichs: Why in the world is the F-35 competing budgetarily with the new ICBM? It makes no sense. We can’t punt on either. #FPIForum
.@RLHeinrichs: We have been planning and spending money at the Pentagon in ways that make no sense at all. #FPIForum

.@RLHeinrichs: US has been intentionally holding back in areas of advanced technologies for years for being of too provocative. #FPIForum
