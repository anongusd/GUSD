@phauran @Busybeezy60 @wilw Catholic Christianity is based on being disciplined in life and thought which it doesn‚Äôt seem you are practiced.

@MotherJones He's running this nation like his failing corporate interests. Board room decisions on an international scale. SAD!

@jbillinson @NPR The ignorance is staggering!
@DailyCaller "Hero's welcome?" When did he liberate Poland? This headline is silly.
@cintia_cuperman @DailyCaller He may have Antonio Sabato Junior fooled about his Christian way of living but it's obvious that he is no such thing.
@cintia_cuperman @DailyCaller And besides, he would prefer that there be no moral high ground anyway. He's ruining our country and it's pissing me off.
@cintia_cuperman @DailyCaller He's president in name only. He does not deserve respect as long as he behaves the way he does. Neither to his supporters.
@FaithfulGarden @realDonaldTrump Too late.
@BloatedPOTUS @Brooklynredbon7 @my2bits4u @FoxNews @GreggJarrett He's a boss with that hairstyle.

@Salon Being on Twitter, I can attest to #Trump supporters being more mouthy. They know nothing, so it's not hurtful. Just uncivil.
@nbcwashington @joncoopertweets @GovChristie Man, he doesn't care about any of this! He's on his way out and knows he's wrong. Took all the power out of that argument, huh?

@scoobasteve7132 @DailyCaller Holy holy holy and all that jazz. The president has likely done 80x worse but had the money to bury it.
@DailyCaller Because everyone knows the Enquirer for its trustworthiness.

@Mike_Banks23 @THR It's amazing you can't answer a direct question.
@Winston15181508 @DineshDSouza You're pathetic of you think a same human being would ever behave this way. We've already condemned Kathy Griffen. Trump is far worse.

@TrumpATeam1 @DineshDSouza Oh, we haven't forgotten anything. Travel ban, health care, Russia. It's all still on the burner.
@DineshDSouza @Mike_Banks23 Because it is serious you yutz! Never had a standing president shown himself to be such an asshole!
@Mike_Banks23 @THR I'm sure you're keeping score. Why don't you tell us...

McCoy thinks she is still 25, Exp think she hawt and wantsta ball it.
Also, dudes have an unnatural preoccupation with the chick right off the bat. Kirk, the pimp, thinks she looks old. So does her own hubs.
McCoy and said lady used to be an item. She left him 10 years prior for the archeologist. He's a dick, btw.
Kirk, McCoy &amp; Expendable beam down to give physicals to a scientist and his wife. Lady looks different to the 3 crewmen.
First up, #TOS: "The Man Trap" from 09/08/66. 1/
@NYMag He probably didn't even know she was still alive. I didn't.
@NormEisen He is a dangerous fool.
But now, as a husband and dad nearing 40, there's been a resurgence.
I was a huge Trek fan throughout my teens and early 20s but it started to wane. And, I found girls.
My first #Trek experience came in the late 80s with "Wrath of Khan." Then, I got my own TV series, #TNG. That was it for me.
Hey folks! Who wants to watch a little #StarTrek? I will be binging every series beginning with #TOS. Watch for tweets coming soon!
@ThisWeekABC @ananavarro And why should they be? The president is insane! We've established he says things with no basis in reality whatsoever.
I'd rather have a president from any other era. You know who was a Modern Day President? Theodore Roosevelt, MF! https://t.co/TrPo4WaGcM
