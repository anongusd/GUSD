@ArkansasBlog And you wonder why people stop responding to your questions. Write what you want. No need for my input.
@ArkansasBlog So your questions, were not questions. Should have saved us both time and started with the above.
@ArkansasBlog Very often rules are adjusted to ensure that the changes properly conform to the enabling law, prevent unintended consequences, eliminate redundancy, correct inconsistencies, etc. 2/2
@ArkansasBlog Much more to the process than disapproval of a rule. I‚Äôd encourage you to look through a rule packet to get a better understanding of the important role that BLR/legislature provides. 1/2
@ArkansasBlog Of rule promulgation? No.
The legislature can only pass laws that allow or restrict the promulgation of rules.  That authority only exists when we are in session. 3/3
To disapprove a rule a member must demonstrate that the new rule change is contrary or in conflict with state, federal or constitutional law. We cannot vote to disapprove bc of a disagreement on the policy. 2/3
There has been a lot of healthy debate on the approval of the rule change that removed the required journalism offering in schools. Regardless of perspective on the issue, our legislative authority related to disapproval of rule changes has been exaggerated in the discussion. 1/3

@ingramlaw @StefaniBuhajla @nhhorton WCMC is in my SD, so their data/experience is important to me.  Understandable its not to you.
@ingramlaw @StefaniBuhajla @nhhorton I haven't advocated making policy based on prelim numbers.
@ingramlaw @StefaniBuhajla @nhhorton I would recommend calling WCMC with your questions. I've never found them to be dishonest with numbers.

@JanetCrow1 what are you saying and who are you talking about?
@StefaniBuhajla Here is the language to Act 72, which would also cover SB1020 and HB1143. http://t.co/qUjV6WyYUZ
@StefaniBuhajla I'll try to pull up the act to make sure, but that I am certain that it provides needed clarification.
@StefaniBuhajla That was passed in an earlier bill during the session.
-focused on making informed, thoughtful decisions with the best interest of our state and their constituents in mind. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
Regardless of the outcome of this particular issue, I‚Äôm incredibly proud to serve in the 89th. Colleagues on both sides of discussion are-
@nhhorton I did and didn't see anything. RT the posts that you are concerned about and I'll be happy to address.
@nhhorton @tolbertreport ...but couldn't point to a specific instance of that actually occurring?

@DavidCrow7 ?
@nhhorton 7 am. Stuttgart, Beebe, Keo, England
@nhhorton @phprogram Next is Monday at 7 am at Searcy Chamber on Main. Look forward to seeing you there.
@JanetCrow1 sorry, I was meaning every member has had opportunity to sit in presentations that fully examined bill.
@JanetCrow1 Every member has had at least 5 open to the public opportunities to do the same. Each time it was explained line by line.
@JanetCrow1 nothing Pelosi-like about. I'd be happy to go over every line with you. Full of solid safeguards.
@JanetCrow1 many have had updates in their communities.

@nhhorton that isn't what they said that day, but there really isn't a reason to keep this going.

@phprogram understand. In SD28, I have held 19 meetings that dealt predominately with this issue. All public and well attended.
@phprogram are you going to be able to come to the meeting at 5?
@phprogram you are right. Probably better way to state is that they hadn't read the bill they were discussing.

@nhhorton I haven't seen anyone attacking, only those wanting to engage in discussion. Maybe I don't follow the folks we are talking about.

@ArkansasBlog I think first step should be consolidation of lower brackets and then incremental adjustments of top.
@ArkansasBlog Moving the brackets would alter the effective rate for all, even those over $500K.  I don't know what others are considering.
@ArkansasBlog Move brackets not rates and do it incrementally.  Changes effective rate and lowers tax burden.  You cut from growth.
@ArkansasBlog What are you talking about? Did I advocate for elimination of income tax?
@ArkansasBlog Something for nothing? Government growth is another factor.
@ArkansasBlog Equation is not that simple or dramatic.
@ArkansasBlog I believe that we begin the reform by incrementally decreasing the effective tax on all AR via consolidation of the brackets.
@ArkansasBlog w/ 6 brackets inside the 1st $33,000, I don't see how anyone can argue that AR income tax doesn't deserve attention/reform.

@ArkansasBlog wasn't my goal to argue anything. Think we do have a twitter disconnect though.
@ArkansasBlog if significant dollars don't leave states to pay for new coverage, then who pays?
@ArkansasBlog also, agency should take time to cover all bases before releasing cost study. Don't you agree?
@ArkansasBlog how we treat tax is separate issue from expansion, but I think deserves consideration.
@ArkansasBlog if your employer stops providing coverage and you don't buy, then you buy or pay tax for coverage. Is that premium deductible?
Also, fed taxes are not deductible on AR returns, but premiums can be under multiple scenarios. How will the individual mandate tax apply?
For instance, where is the allocation for fed taxes leaving state economy, which has to have a material impact.
Thanks to DHS for the estimates on expansion. I appreciate the effort, but things are not quite as simple as their spreadsheet asserts.
