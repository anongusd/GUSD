@paurichen @SkyNews I mean illegal is illegal. And no need to single out a group of illegals based on race. America was built on the blood of natives and the sweat of slaves. The ancestors  of these folk still have to file paperwork to get here legally. There are many illegal Europeans in America!
@paurichen @SkyNews Illegal is illegal irrespective of activity. That is why it is wrong to focus on a specific race of illegals. America was built on the back of many..natvies, slaves etc. Doesn't mean the Irish immigrant gets a free pass so Mexicans can be persecuted
@bhoy_67 @CNN So in rhe extreme, we should wait till the child dies, then arrest the parents? I do not believe any adult should have a child in thier care if they refuse to provide basic medical care.Limit your religious bs to YOUR  adult self and provide care for the child.

@CNNPolitics It took this long. There are entire doctoral programs with only chinese students.  Chinese prof's with a pipeline of student funded to study in the USA, finding work under Chinese bosses in big  key industries.

@cfm860 @BelleNoel14 @kojoshow Meat is used to describe animal flesh 100% of the time. Meat/y has been used as an adjective for some fruits/vegs. But clearly we are using the meaning understand by majority of mankind. The industry can come up with more imaginative and innovative names for their market.
@cfm860 @BelleNoel14 @kojoshow Tylenol is a brand name and contains acetaminophen. Aspirin is a NSAID. Meat is not a brand name, and can be equated to the chemical composition of the headache reliever. So by law you can't sell acetaminophen labelled as turpentine. Its is a false statement. Beans is not meat.
@BelleNoel14 @cfm860 @kojoshow I certainly wouldn't buy 'Aspirin substitute"  instead.of the real deal. Any pharmacy that attempts that is committing a fraud. The meat industry may actually have a good case against these labels. I will not take kindly if mislead to buy soy or beans shaped into hot dogs.
@BelleNoel14 @kojoshow It seems there are different shades of Vegans/Veggies. Those who reject meat for ethical reasons, and those who don't eat meat other reasons eg. Choices and reasons  may differ among the groups. But  bean curd  IS NOT meat, and the labeling is misleading to the consumer.

@ItsBrandonBoyd @CNNPolitics Still shocking that the GOP is going along with this! They refuse to do their job and represent the people who elected them. Come 2020, no one is forgetting this easily , the impact is casting a long shadow. And there are so many more issues of relevance than the wall

@CBSNews The Goebbels of this administration. Indictment coming soon!
@thehill Secure the nation with a wall on the border, making us target practice for homegrown terrorists? 323 people died from mass shootings in 2018 alone, what has the GOP and NRA done to curb that? https://t.co/0FoKVfccDy
@thehill Curious..what does she call her husband? That picture is unflattering though!
@thehill From the same man who is so partisan, he changes senate rules to limit how many people have a say on new legislation. He goes down as the most partisan senate lead without vision, and unwillingness to use legislative powers to control an unhinged executive branch.
@thehill Seriously, which fed  agrees to you mooching off  tax payers money and creating havoc and chaos based illogical reasoning. Congress needs to demand a mental health screening!
@SkyNews The President job is to keep government  working and the legislative branch gives him the money. Just as DNC waited since 1936 to pass a new healthcare bill - medicare, the  GOP needs to realise their window of opportunity passed this yr, and get back to work on other issues
@thehill The most partisan majority  leader of all time without  vision. Compromised  into playing puppet for the executive  branch. ...VOTE HI'M OUT
@CNNPolitics GOP is individual greed over national  security.  2020 can't come soon enough. No president has this much power  to throw tantrum at our expense unless the GOP senate ceded it!
RT @Tansmom01: @AC360 @andersoncooper 2 year of Republican rule, why wasn't it passed then. Stop the blame game and open the government.
RT @TheDailyShow: Oh man, once Trump gets his wall he better hope no one shows Mexico this old video we found. https://t.co/FtzeGlmecz
@DPohocsucut @ABC And your point is what exactly...you lost me with your opening.
@CNNPolitics Good for him...Impeachment is neccessary after this week of drama! Yet he still bills the government for staying at his own properties,  numerous children and wives with secret service detail, and over pays dumb hacks to advise him in the WH!
@politico GOP is a disappointment to the people. You had two years controlling house, senate, and the executive branch and you want to put this on the Democrats NOW. You all deserve to lose your salary and benefits for the period of closure!
@CNNPolitics Till the video tape that contradicts his story, or Kelly Anne redefine "calm" to suit her boss.  People are tired , hungry and need a pay check. Get that through your thick head. Try standing in-front of furloughed employees to see if they don't do worse than shouting !
@ABC ..not Senate, Congress!
@ABC GOP had 2 years of controlling all branches of government ,and they could not pass a budget to build this wall till democrats too over the senate. Keep putting your individual desires ahead of national security , and see what happens in 2020!
@ABC We deserve better !
@politico This needs to end 19 days ago. I was not one to support impeachment till this week. Get rid of the man whatever way you can. National security risk and creating a power vacuum worldwide in his inability to lead and work with the allies.
@BBCBreaking Why is he still president..time to get rid of him. Nothing but a national security risk.  Imagine if it was a non white non male president! to much leniency. If you cannot do your job the board of directors appoint someone who can! GOP Senators need to step up!
@jadapsmith @RedTableTalk Its almost shocking how long this has been going on, several people certainly enabled and covered up for a very long time. Shame on them ALL!
@CBSNews McConnell comes across as compromised. All these years in senate only to play lapdog to an unhinged man. The same bill which his Senate passed a few weeks is what is being presented to him from the House. A disappointment , but 2020 will see him as a minority leader!
@piersmorgan The voice that insists on joining conversation even though he has nothing to say....go away pest!
@ABC Wait till everyone stops paying tax in California....!
@ABC Why is the WH still staffed, Why does 45 and family still have secret service protection, why are the senate and congress till getting a paycheck?
@WashTimes slippery slope, you don't see it till its too late. Goebbels  and his mice video propaganda;  and those he likened to mice ended up in gas chambers. Be warned!
@ABC This is not news...this is an archaic institution that undermines progress on equality and equity.. Time to get rid of the lot!
@USATODAY Seriously, this is news...unfollow stat!
@NewDay @CNN @SenatorLankford What has natures strongest barrier, the OCEAN done to curb immigration? It did not stop Fred Trump, Marry Ann Trump, Ivana Trump and Melania Trump from coming to America. And you think a wall will do WHAT! The ocean can bring down a wall !
@ABC Personal responsibility for taking drugs..if there is demand , of course someone will supply it . Closing one source down will only make another supplier richer as long as DEMAND exists!
@ABC Irresponsible general headlines....What kind of drugs? Last I checked opiates are manufactured in nice labs in the west and not on the Mexican border...
@washingtonpost @PostOpinions It must be quite difficult for people to cast their minds back only a few days ago..In his own words, he said he was shutting down the government. An infantile act ie costing the national money and jeopardizing national security and leaving federal families without $$$
