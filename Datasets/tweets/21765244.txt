Now, the Senate must follow the House’s lead by passing HR1. Working families deserve a government that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.
With the passage of HR1, the House is taking a bold step in ensuring all working people have a say in what kind of country we will be. The #ForThePeople Act will make voting easier and ensure elected leaders are accountable to constituents.
America aspires to be a country where every person has an equal voice, regardless of the color of their skin, where they’re born or how much money they make. But far too often, the voices of working Americans are left out of our democracy.

And for shining a light on “domestic workers serving without labor protections. Women and men who could thrive if only they had the support and freedom to do so.” For too long, home care and child care workers—mostly women of color—have been excluded from our labor laws.

It’s time for Republican leaders--from Attorneys General to judges to members of Congress and the president--to listen to the will of the people and stop trying to take our healthcare away.
Tonight’s ruling in Texas is just a continuation of their failed attempts to take our healthcare away. The #ACA is still the law of the land. We expect a reviewing court to reverse this decision, as the Supreme Court has twice upheld the constitutionality of #Obamacare.
The American people believe that every family should have affordable healthcare so our loved ones can be happy and healthy. We voted overwhelmingly in the midterms against politicians who voted to take affordable healthcare away--but Republican leaders still haven’t learned.

New Acting Attorney General Whitaker wants to cut Mueller’s funding “so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.” He cannot run the Mueller investigation &amp; must publicly commit to protect it from outside interference. #ProtectMueller

The disgraceful behavior of the Trump administration and the senators who voted for confirmation will fuel our efforts on November 6, in 2020 and beyond.
Every time Brett Kavanaugh authors or agrees with an opinion that puts billionaires and corporations ahead of working people, we will remember the men and women who put him on the Court.
We applaud the senators who stood up and supported working people by opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Those senators listened to their constituents and showed they care about our right to have a voice in a union and access to affordable healthcare.
SEIU members are outraged that this man (#BrettKavanaugh), who repeatedly demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament, an inability to tell the truth and has multiple, credible sexual assault allegations against him, will be deciding our rights for the next several decades.
Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court represents a historic low for the nation. Working people, our healthcare, our right to join together in unions and our ability to vote unimpeded are all at risk.

This administration, Congress and #SCOTUS have trampled the rights of working people and our ability to have a voice at the ballot box. Judge Kavanaugh would continue this attack on our families. He’s always been bad for working people--now our democracy is also at stake.

Judge Kavanaugh’s record makes clear that he would be a rubber stamp for the president, including his crusade to sabotage our healthcare. His nomination has been pre-approved by an extreme group that wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. #SaveScotus
Judge Kavanaugh is a narrow-minded elitist who would further rig our economy and democracy against working Americans. #SaveSCOTUS (2 of 2)
Working people know all too well how important #SCOTUS is to upholding key American values. In just the last few weeks it attacked the rights of working people in the Janus case and enshrined discrimination against immigrants by ruling in favor of the Muslim ban. (1 of 2)

This is unacceptable. This is inhumane. This is non-Christian. We are here to be the light in this moment of darkness that we are in. And we're here to make a difference.  (3 of 5)
I'm a U.S. citizen and I'm here to stand up for those voices that can't stand up. For those children in cages, in deplorable situations that don't understand what's going on.  I'm here because this is wrong. It's not what the United States of America is all about. (2 of 5)
I want to share with you all what Wanda Smith from @seiu668 said when she was asked whey she traveled all the way from Pennsylvania to the border in Tornillo, Texas: "I'm here as a mother, a human being, a daughter of an immigrant."  (1 of 5)

Lifesaving care provided by 500K SEIU nurses, doctors and healthcare workers in hospitals is at risk, too.
Essential long term care services provided thru Medicaid-funded programs by 600K SEIU nursing home &amp; home care workers is at risk
They are pushing an extreme agenda that put corporate profits ahead of the health of working Americans.
Republican leaders want to cut more than $800 billion from #Medicaid with no thought for older Americans or ppl w disabilities.

23. The path ahead is difficult but with the energy, commitment &amp; determination of AFRAM members across the country, I know we will succeed. https://t.co/mN4fUblWtu
22. We must have faith that workers across this country will rise up &amp; fight for #RacialJustice, for economic justice &amp; for social justice.
21. On this 20th anniversary, we resolve to continue the work of this caucus that is vital to the very existence of our great union.
20. We'll never succeed if any person is thrown away bc of race or heritage. We won't have economic justice if we don't have #RacialJustice.
19. We defeated Puzder for DOL Secretary, who said of robots: "There’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case." https://t.co/mc3BLOAPdn
18. We're beating back a devastating attack by a bill that disproportionately threatens health care for Americans of color &amp; poor Americans.
17. Despite attacks Lisa keeps fighting "Hard-working home care workers will no longer accept the fact that we are underpaid &amp; overworked" https://t.co/Uh2sJArCIp
16. And since the 2016 election, we have seen the most serious attack on working people in this union’s 95-year history.
15. WI passed a strict photo ID law &amp; in Milwaukee, where 70% of African Americans in the state live, African American turnout decreased 13%
14. Voter ID requirements, limits on early voting &amp; barriers to register to vote disproportionately affect communities of color &amp; the poor.
.@1199SEIU 13. For 40 years we’ve seen an attack on workers’ ability to join together in unions and an attack on their right to vote.
.@1199SEIU 12. Today families are working harder &amp; longer while still struggling to pay their bills &amp; provide for their families w/o going into debt.
11. @1199seiu member Lisa Johnson: "In the past, we were forced to do these jobs." Home care workers still live paycheck to paycheck. https://t.co/iaWtq4pGVU
10. From new Demos report, median white households have $13 in net worth for every $1 the median Black household has https://t.co/bxmFRObRnj
9. The staggering wage gaps long-endured by Black workers continue. More than half of working people who are Black or Latino make &lt;$15/hr.
8. Systems across our societies continue to prioritize white people at the disadvantage of Black people and other people of color.
7. Those rules were written to exclude Black Americans from the growing middle class. And those inequities continue today.
6. As @tanehisicoates pointed out, when Social Security was signed into law 65% of African Americans were ineligible https://t.co/SSmA9iDKEF
5. Jobs predominantly done by Black workers were excluded from basic protections &amp; benefits like overtime, labor law &amp; Social Security.
4. Lauren: "We always did the grunt work for low wages. White babies drank from our breasts, but we couldn’t drink from their fountains." https://t.co/slL8zpkchP
3. Back in August, home care worker Lauren Clark powerfully spoke to how our country’s legacy of slavery erected lasting structures.
2. I'd like to pay tribute to these incredible leaders and talk about how economic justice &amp; #RacialJustice are inextricably linked. https://t.co/5MHQ7GJVUK
