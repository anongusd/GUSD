Smart, independent representation returns to #IL10. Congrats @ROBERTDOLD
With @wbez discussing how R majority can turn a do nothing congress into a do something congress. http://t.co/2xJtp8u6Gd
I voted for @ROBERTDOLD today because #IL10 deserves an independent voice. RT if you agree!

RT @noonanjo: President Obama talks about how hard it was to impose sanctions. He's talking about his fight with Congress, to water them ...

Appreciate @Schneider4IL10's past support but I didn't work with you;I've worked with @RobertDold closely and he has my strong support #IL10
VP's comments on Iran sanctions belie the letter his administration sent us last year opposing our amendment http://t.co/FIVEnc4I #VPDebate
