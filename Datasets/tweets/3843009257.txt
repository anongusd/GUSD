@templelaw I guess if you're a poor white student or happen not to join one of those affinity student groups, you dont matter as much to @templelaw's Office of Student Affairs &amp; Office of Career Services? Do they only offer after-hours/additional services based on race &amp; sexual orientation?
Hey @chucktodd @MeetThePress, 100% love @SenFeinstein reaction to those kids b/c you could kind of tell she really wanted to say it to the Freshmen Dems pushing joke plans like Green New Deal. Also, your panelist @hmcghee is a loon, get someone more stable next show?!
@RandyEBarnett Just like people who would build Walls/pro-boarder security, billionaires, anyone against the Green New Deal, Republican Supreme Court nominees, pro-lifers, people opposed to all classifications on the basis of race, and ... people who say things Democrats don't like.
@RandyEBarnett Last week, only racists &amp; homophobes didn't immediately believe &amp; emotionally internalize Jussie Smollett's fantastical accusations. OBV, this week, pointing out the double standard in reporting must make you an 'imoral' &amp; unprincipled bigot.

@NateSilver538 Addition of 'Hillary/email' is a self-soothing mechanism to avoid discussion of the many other materials real flaws w/ Hillary/campaign (an emotional trigger). But, the addition undermines ur sexism argument—none of the others attempted &amp; destroyed evidence of their controversies
E.g. In 'Politics Podcast: The Mess In Virginia' a reasonably realistic unemotional summary of Dem responses occurs, quickly followed by the "journalists'" opinions all alluding that GOP is just racist &amp; pro-rape (no fact summary included). @NateSilver538 what's with that?
Wow, @FiveThirtyEight, I used to listen to your politics podcasts as they initially had a semblance of unbiased reporting. They've gotten increasingly partisan, &amp; are now just hackneyed reiterations of the worst DNC talking points [unlistenable].

@obsessafilma @juscomments @ChrisCuomo Also, FYI, I'm well above Chris's level. In fact, I think most people are. His dad did get him a swell career though.
@obsessafilma @juscomments @ChrisCuomo No ... I was responding to the previous tweet saying: "Georgetown Law must be super proud." Frankly, I assumed the person wasnt a lawyer, not trying to be arrogant.
@KatzNose @ChrisCuomo I'm not sure why you're asking, but yes. Canadian Law school .... I'm sure you're not necessarily up on a lot of stuff. (jk, couldn't resist)

@mayflower862 @sean_prevost @ChrisCuomo Ask Chris
@sean_prevost @ChrisCuomo When one party violates the constitution in order to prevent a candidate of the opposite party from constitutionally guaranteed right in elections, then that is cheating! Agreed, so long as no more cheating takes place!
@sean_prevost @ChrisCuomo Thanks for your input bud, but that doesnt prove what you think it does. Just because FDLE isnt (or hasnt yet) started an investigation doesnt mean no cheating took place. The only fact we do have is that a COURT ruled she violated the constitution. See your mistake?
@sean_prevost @ChrisCuomo ... a form of 'cheating'. https://t.co/Rx6qcz2Lh2

@JohnJHarwood Actually, that's just your opinion John. Much like claims of Russia collusion, such claims are not corrupt if true. Let's wait to see the facts, hmm?
@SamWangPhD Given national pop vote isnt a thing, ur assertion that this statistic =a 'popular wave' is baseless. Given real results measured (seats gained) there must of been a lot of inefficient votes cast. Indicating not a popular wave, but extreme discord in partisanly liberal districts.
I think [political hack] @JohnJHarwood is letting political leanings get the better of him again @MCaruso_Cabrera! Asserting Dem party has mostly commonly held positions &amp; arent v divided is the most absurd thing I've heard all day. Only a Dem advocate would assert such a thing.
@ezraklein 3) As for Kavanaugh &amp; Garland, those are based on votes in the senate (take it up with your Senators); &amp;	4) As for Citizens United &amp; Bush v. Gore, those are cases! Unless Ezra is suggesting we poll to determine a legal answer.... 		Ezra is VERY confused, wilfully or otherwise.
@ezraklein It just goes to show, people who poll about our elections don't understand much about the structure of our constitutional system:	1) There is no house popular vote;	2) Electoral college ensures each states # of electors represents the states whole population (voting &amp; non)
@RandyEBarnett I agree @MattWalshBlog! But I agree with @RandyEBarnett more. Why dont you take it up with the 'Rock the Vote!' people?
@RandyEBarnett ❤️ I cant tell whether thats a solid burn on @dannybarefoot's *really* dumb twitter bio &amp; claim of voter fraud omnipotence, or a sick burn on the irony that any 'Ad Guy' (&amp; especially anyone whod describe themselves as one) would assert he knows what serious people claim or dont!
@RandyEBarnett Some people dont like it when you start messin' w/ stem cell of their living Constitution. §1 is only alive so long as they like the results &amp; we must accept custom as precedent. Similar to how liberals use the invidious in 'invidious discrimination', or 'well regulated militia'.
@BillKristol Bill, you’ve lost it! Thankfully, nothing has really happened. You want a White House speech because a lunatic sent a bunch of pipe bombs out (who the FBI will hopefully be capturing shortly)? I don’t remember outcries like this after the ricin letters last month. #Melodramatic
@Onhereforthene1 @RandyEBarnett The Dems, post-Civil Rights Act changed from being [racist] for unequal treatment under law benefiting the majority (whites) to being for unequal treatment under the law for minority groups who suffer from 'invidious' discrimination. At time made sense, 2 sides of same coin now
@Onhereforthene1 @RandyEBarnett While I appreciate you get your facts from funny line on '30 Rock', that's just entirely not true. 1) A greater proportion of Republicans in Congress than Dems in Congress voted for the '64 Act when passed; &amp; 2) GOP was &amp; remained pro-equal treatment under the law.
@RandyEBarnett Frankly, I'm not even sure my above analogy holds-up 100%... I just love the film &amp; was lookin for an excuse to tweet the clip.
@RandyEBarnett Maybe Riot/Rioters are their preferred pronouns? The Dems seem to be stuck in the 60's (the 1860's). They always seem to have an odd, yet historically typical, overreaction to the confluence of race, immigration, &amp; a Republican pro-Union POTUS.	https://t.co/yOYaRBUFu9

@BillKristol @ChrisCuomo You’re an idiot
@RandyEBarnett Given Professor Ford claims are per se defamation, I think we’ll just apply the civil standard: she &amp; he are both presumed innocent, &amp; she has the burden of proving her claim is true by the preponderance of the evidence. Hope that clarifying. Also I believe she believes her story
Hey @davidfaber, @jimcramer is absolutely correct bout the absurdity of the deal &amp; applicability of criminal charges. Elon’s willful public lies on twitter is the most blatant intentially manipulative &amp; misleading thing I’ve seen any public CEO do for very long time
@RandyEBarnett E.g. Use of anonymous sources, when they can assert something as a fact (vs repeated hearsay), retraction and misconduct standards.	Obv. they’d have to do it themselves, so it’s prob a moot question anyway.
@RandyEBarnett Do you think the press would be served by forming a SRO (like state bars or med associations, except w/o the states enforcement), assuming they could form a sufficiently unbiased one? The press always talks about itself like it is a profession, but has no decrenable standards.

@CillizzaCNN @WRashbaum As a matter of fact, Cohen must of done some legal work to negotiate, draft, &amp; get settlement signed (or oversaw that process). Plus, worst crime article wildly speculates about is misdemeanor. Even more, non-disclosure settlement payment could be legal exp in general retainer.

@perf_tenn @RandyEBarnett @JohnJHarwood Uhh, the quote was the comment. John posted the quote for some purpose. Since John doesnt have habit providing the missing literal text of a referenced quote (to tweets he's not even mentioned in), it was very likely not for purely informational purposes. 1/2

@RandyEBarnett So many straw man arguments one could confuse the Sac Bee w/ a wheat field! 	His argument: B/c Originalism, a relatively objective principled method of Constitutional interp. cant work 100% of the time, his method of making up stuff based on whatever HE feels today must be right

@petestrzok Also, FYI, the outpouring of support you received is derived from partisan politics (ie like your investigations) not 'fighting for our American ideals.' American ideals arent supporting disgraced ex-fed employee who receives rightfully harsher penalty than initially anticipated

@Ceph37 @elonmusk ... What the hell are you talking about?
Scariest thing is @elonmusk might actually believe investors confirmed support after a few casual conversations. Hes like one of those cult leaders at point when they actually start believing all their own outlandish preachings. Is rational valuation the work of the devil Elon?
@Laurie_Garrett @elonmusk Jesus, Laurie. They're doing wonderful things in mental institutions these days.
@elonmusk Ha oh really? We'd all love to see the emails or any documentation you have regarding their 'confirmed support'.	A brilliant CEO would never produce a twt stating "funding secured" w/o any documentation or signed contracts. That'd make it materially false (or a big ole' omission)

@willfnye @mchmiel @FiveThirtyEight No I agree. That could have been discussed also.
@InfinityBall Yeah, actually it was. The data reported by 538 was used in the paper by the authors to support what they believe is the cause. See https://t.co/NYcgaSwt8I
@JulesDreading @PersonOnTwitt3r @eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight So your saying every person MUST vote only on their short term econ interests? Should we impliment a poll test to see if they are going to before they vote? Should we sensor Fox News for providing information you dont agree with? (soiler alert, right answer is no) Please, grow up
@eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight Amy, you are not rational. That is your opinion. I may even agree with it (or not), but it is far more complicated than that.
@mchmiel @FiveThirtyEight That's just not accurate. Authors rather make several attempts to explain the cause, which all implicate the sole source of their observations are the individuals intrinsic biases. See https://t.co/NYcgaSwt8I
@deedeewatson4 @FiveThirtyEight I'd largely agree. I do think that the study should have mentioned or considered it as a potential cause, as the authors state several conclusory potential organic causes of the observed results (e.g. in/out party bias). Extrinsic contributing factors could bare on hypothesis
@eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight Amy... That's not correct. Just admit that you dont (and no one does) what's in an individual's best interest besides that individual. Additionally, that is what you said just in the form of: "if they dont agree w/ what I think their best interest is they must be racist".
@PersonOnTwitt3r @eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight haha classic, with a picture.
@PersonOnTwitt3r @eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight . . .  good one.		I know reading is probably a challenge for you, but I assure you novels are usually longer.
@eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight My point is simply that they are in the best position to determine what is in their best interest (i.e. not you). Even if we may disagree with their determination, even if its objectively wrong, the ability to do so is absolute. Its also unfair to then also presume biased intent
@eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight Perhaps they determine that their own best interest/s by examining their lives (as most competent adults &amp; non-slaves do), &amp; decide should vote on the basis of a different issue (or multiple) entirely? Maybe they think long term sustainability of gov program is in best interest?
@eatthedonut @FiveThirtyEight . . . cause you def know 'their own best interests' better than they do. #Wow

To clarify, irresponsible reporting practices would be procedural (e.g. sourcing/over reliance on anon sources), NOT content of reports (so long as sourcing &amp; other procedure passes muster). Should also have oath of confidentiality &amp; ability to disclose to SRO confidentially

@troth_law @RandyEBarnett Actually, I just took a little break from work (like 15 min, no billing). I kinda get a kick out of engaging ppl I disagree w/ in the hopes we may be able to reach some mutual respect or understanding.
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett I think it was just me, maybe one other person ...
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 4) You say potato I say potato. To a neutral observer, opossing one specific nominee after the nomination is 'principled' seeming. Vs. A blanket declatory statement against 4 potential nominees would seem more like a 'smear'. Again, twitter. YOU GOTTA CUT THE ALL CAPS, ALSO MAN.
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 3.1) That was I think Prof. Barnett point, that given this is their only route it's an odd choice to use it as red meat for your political base vs. appeal to moderates (given trump already has Dem base activated).
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 3) In this case, with the removal of fillibusters (GOP &amp; Dems fault equally), the ninority party (Dems in this case) arent 'rejecting to hold hearings' because only majority has that power. W/o fillibuster any minority party can only use nominee confirmation process as PR event
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 2) We're on twitter, more precise wording would take up too much space. It is a favor because, I think admittedly, the GOP was never going to confirm him. I think sparing a nominee from the partisan attacks is kindof a favor.
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 1.1) I get Dem base is revved up on issue, but I think its fair to say that to a neutral lay observer, it would be more appealing to oppose the actual nominee, rather than 4 potential.
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett 1) I think you may be falling into the fundamental attribution error trap, in regards to Prof. Barnett. I think it's almost always true that, especially for a party seeking to regain majority, to regain control appealing to independents/neutral lay observers is best strat.
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett ... (versus what Dems really did, to smear 4 possible nominees and seeming more ‘unreasonable’). Also, what majority opposing party-GOP did w/ Garland is different in that as the majority they had the ability to follow through-sparing Garland unneeded pain of a “hearing”
@troth_law @RandyEBarnett I get the analogy, but it’s not literally the same. I think Prof Barnett was mostly making a PR/political point-bout the imprudence of minority oppossing party saying NEVER (unnecessarily). When they could seem more reasonable to just think it and then oppose real nom after

@RandyEBarnett In addition to ur caps issues, @troth_law, what u said is also wrong. Art. II says POTUS appoints w/ "the Advice and Consent of the Senate", with no mention of a perfunctory hearing requirement. I think its just safe to assume (based on orignal pub meaning) Congress didnt consent

@DavidLat @EdWhelanEPPC Ha! Admittedly, my tweet was a pretty hollow &amp; obvious comment on the tone of your article, which you do vigorously couch as 'ridiculous' within. I just really got a kick out of defining a slang term as an aside, to play into the tone.
@DavidLat @EdWhelanEPPC I know.

U R disgusting @SenatorDurbin! Trumps an idiot bt in privt meeting confidentiality &amp; candidness allow debate &amp; compromise. U poisond well 4 political gain, poisoning any deal, &amp; on dreamers backs! #Shame		Also regardless of who lives there those countries are objectively s**holes
.@NateSilver538 In ur Game Theory discussion, you both assume Trump is solely drafting his own N.Korean twts (&amp; receiving no guidance on content). Given rhetorical consistency across gov, it may be a fair assumption that DoD is having some input?
@ForecasterEnten @ClareMalone @NateSilver538 @jodyavirgan Why was Bannon in the White House in the first place? Given that he is crazy even according to Trump, seems like a better question.
.@forecasterenten @claremalone @natesilver538 @jodyavirgan I think yall got a lil carried away w/ Fire&amp;Fury. Wolfe admits Banon is "very large source" [the main] for the book. Also, we all agree Banon is a loon, so hearsay bout Trump from him seems unreliable on its face.
.@andrewrsorkin, It's probably much easier to hold the position your guest has if youve always been and grown up extremely wealthy (like him). But he has a really "cool" position (or at least signaled all the right values)
Very disappointing how biased @FWhitfield’s show has become! She doesn’t challenge guests, and only has liberal “reporters” on her show. I’m a neverTrump libertarian, but @CNN &amp; Fredricka embarrass themselves &amp; journalistic profession #joke #pathetic #stomachturning
.@MelissaLeeCNBC While the Gift Card-opioid connection is interesting, exposing all of society to increased inconvenience (&amp; lost value) of GCs &amp; government data tracking is absurd. Perhaps authorities/retailers should focus on preventing the retail theft required &amp; fund research
It’s a horrible disease and I feel badly for people suffering with opioid addiction, @BeckyQuick, but treating everyone in the US for their illness is a slippery-slope. Gift cards should be as liquid as possible &amp; opioids is a Home Dept cop-out to keep those $ locked in their rev https://t.co/3H3RcnfTZW
Isn’t it possible @andrewrsorkin that some instrumentalities that opioid addicts may use to get drugs , cannot &amp; should not be made more difficult for everyone (regulated)? Police the larceny
As for the cure of animus, can it be cured by doing the same thing next time just w/o the same feelings?  Whar if the Gov/person who made the animus statements/actions changes her mind or "evolved" (like Obama).
Prob w/ Courts use of animus is (as always) definition &amp; its cure. How did CO demonstrate religious animus? Asian applicants to Harvard (&amp; other colleges) should claim, preferencing 1 protected group that necessarily harms another is animus. I agree that speech maybe too slippery https://t.co/5MlfKlNqJW

@dale_schrock @ericbolling Both very important, but #ContestConvention will happen if field can keep DT below 50% delegates 4 rest of prime
@jlperry_jr @ericbolling Yeah &amp; it will likely work

@rev_b_wayne @ericbolling B/c actual rule only requires major of delegates frm 8 states. 4 #Contested delegates all unbound&amp;so auto get that
@rev_b_wayne @ericbolling Yeah, but Rule40 only applies to first round. W/ Rd1 passed, that rule doesn't really apply 4 #ContestedConvention
@Avlislrac Yeah! @ericbolling point seems 2 B Trump MOST likely 2 get to 1237. Doesn't mention its more likely NO1 will hit 1237 #Contested

@SwamiDaveSays @ericbolling BUT pretendin #Kasich(or #Rubio)will evr drop is not realistic. So no-one will make it to 1237. Will B Contested
@ericbolling Trump evn Ws FL&amp;OH, u say will get 47% prop Delegates. he wld nd @ min50%-his best case. Kasich/Rubio commin on strong in OH/FL

@Giddy0411 @BretBaier @JohnKasich @RealBenCarson They didn't b/c their campaigns are jokes &amp; they are helping Trump
@BretBaier I think Kasich made everyone say we like him, but we still don't know why he's allowing Trump to win, by being obstinate
@BretBaier Rubio won, Trump Lost, Kasich seemed like a confused elderly man who doesn't know what reality is.
It's cause people have to search multiple times to find out @realDonaldTrump has zero policy or legitimacy 4 points https://t.co/aEmOGAfNQo

@Reince Why is @JohnKasich still in the GD race?!
@MiaEanissa @JWGOP Are you joking. I got a better Idea of how you could vote. Take a ballot &amp; flush it. Or just vote Trump directly
@JohnKasich in what universe? Your delusions are starting to affect others. Drop out, it's pathetic
