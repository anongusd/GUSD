Dayaratna:  Regulatory policies regarding carbon dioxide emissions are predicated on faulty models, will have devastating economic impacts, and will have only negligible impact on the climate.
- in particular by 2035, the country would see an average employment shortfall of nearly 400,000 lost jobs, an up to 20% increase in household electricity expenditures, and an aggregate $2.5 trillion loss in GDP. (2/2)
Dayaratna:  In particular, we modeled the regulations suggested by the previous administration’s Interagency Working Group and found that the economic impacts would be quite devastating – (1/2)
Dayaratna:  So the bottom line is these regulations are predicated on models that have been manipulated to justify a particular regulatory agenda.
Dayaratna:  Energy is literally the basis of anything and everything we do from flipping on a light switch, to starting up your car, to enabling this very hearing to operate. And unfortunately, many people take energy for granted.
Energy is necessary to produce almost everything we have; to make energy expensive is to make living difficult for all but the richest citizens. (3/3)
Heating and cooling costs will become so expensive that many will have to choose between food or heat.  (2/3)
Legates (1/3):  The long-term impact to eschewing fossil fuels will be to intentionally make energy expensive. Anything that uses energy will therefore cost more. Transportation costs will skyrocket, making it expensive to travel to work and to transport goods to market.
Our witness, Kevin Dayaratna, is the Senior Statistician and Research Programmer for @Heritage.
Insistence that these events must be caused or exacerbated by human activity reflects a denial of basic climate science. (2/2)
Legates:  Current climate observations indicate that the events which kill or injure the most people and have the biggest economic impact are not affected significantly by changing greenhouse gas concentrations.  (1/2)
Legates:  My main concern here today is that we are focusing on an expensive solution that will have virtually no impact on our lives. Climate has always changed, and weather is always variable, due to complex, powerful natural forces.
Legates:  Historically, hurricane landfalls are more frequent during colder periods and become less frequent as the temperature rises.
Legates:  Extreme climate events are becoming neither more intense nor more frequent.
Our witness, David R. Legates, is a professor and climatologist at @UDelaware. He also holds a joint appointment in the Dept of Applied Economics and Statistics as well as in the Physical Ocean Science and Engineering Program.  He’s legit.
.@RepMcClintock: There are many ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions without destroying the lives of working families and producing the kind of reaction we now see on the streets of Paris.
.@RepMcClintock: Science thrives on civil and dispassionate debate.  When someone tells you the debate is over, that dissent should be forbidden and dissenters should be personally attacked – that’s not a scientist talking – that’s a politician.
.@RepMcClintock: Hurricane activity is much lower than recorded in the 18th Century.
McClintock:  Warming is nothing new: our planet has been warming on and off since the last ice age.
McClintock: No one denies that our planet is warming; carbon dioxide levels are increasing, and ocean levels are rising.  But before we run screaming into the night, let’s also do a quick reality check.

Energy production provides a reliable revenue stream to offset the lack of taxable lands. Yet, burdensome regulatory requirements have discouraged greater development, resulting in lost revenue for investment in public education.
For many western states, funding public services like education is particularly challenging due to the tax-exempt status of federal lands. Many states attempt to offset losses in private tax revenue with revenues generated through energy development on federal lands.

"Secrecy was so vital to the endeavor that the Clinton administration was denying a decision had been made, even as bleachers were going up for the presidential announcement at the Grand Canyon." -Michael Leavitt, former Governor of Utah https://t.co/2UkyagajFy
The opportunity now lies with Congress to protect and set apart the places in Utah that deserve it, to consider what the lands mean to those who live on them and visit them and to apply the #AntiquitiesAct as designed
Using the #AntiquitiesAct to create #GrandStaircase was a clear example of inadequate protection. The Antiquities Act has another downside, what one president can do with a pen, a phone and a podium at the Grand Canyon, another can undo or unravel #utpol
President Clinton's #GrandStaircase designation locked up school trust lands, which derived revenue from the multiple uses of the land. The monies flowed to an endowment to support public education.
It's inconceivable that someone entrusted to the highest office of the United States would be willing to undertake a process that was purely partisan on a matter of such importance #GrandStaircase
No one in this country can love these lands more than those who live there. These places are vast and beautiful. They symbolize America and they define Utah #utpol
The reason that Washington declarations like #GrandStaircase and #BearsEars are described in Utah as "midnight monuments." They are sprung on the state by a federal government removed from the aftermath of its socio-economic realities.
Under President Clinton, the #GrandStaircase National Monument was done in stealth, under wraps and on the fly. There was a deliberate effort to conceal and keep monument planning out of public view.
"The way the #GrandStaircase came forward was an abuse of power, process and protocol so egregious that it is offense to the concept of democracy itself." 	Michael Leavitt, former Governor of Utah
