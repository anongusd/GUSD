@FeministaJones @ChristalynPR Wow. I missed this. Thanks for sharing.
@rolandsmartin @JotakaEaddy @ekp Sadly, some of the smartest, most innovative are also scammers (on Sundays I temper my language). Sharing these stories with state AGs, Consumer Affairs offices and the media is a must. We may be unable to stop most of the calls, but we can better educate the most vulnerable.
@JotakaEaddy @ekp I've also been getting health insurance calls that I know were mostly scams at the height of open enrollment season. Now "important information about "my Visa and Mastercard account" calls abound. I can't encourage you to lobby but there are 535 people who may need to do more...
@JotakaEaddy @ekp Sigh. Don't lose your temper like me but report this to the Federal Trade Commission: https://t.co/lXOdhAomov or call 1-888-382-1222. Also, note the times and call your phone provider's customer care number. They may need to heighten their spam/fraud protocols.

Behind the Washington acronyms, inside the beltway jargon &amp; flashy headlines are a series of @FCC actions I fear are jeopardizing #consumers

By eliminating the #mainstudio rule, @FCC allows big broadcasters to abandon the communities they‚Äôre obligated to serve. Not #ConsumersFirst
.@FCC action will give those using hearing aids greater ability to control the volume when using wide range of devices. #Inclusion
3.5GHz band can unleash #competition &amp; support #unserved areas BUT rules must allow small providers &amp; new entrants fair shot to get licenses

.@FCC¬†20th¬†Mobile #Competition Report fails to assess entire #wireless ecosystem including towers, backhaul, and transport facilities.
How can the @FCC¬†majority conclude #wireless market is effectively competitive when so many still wait for mobile service where they live?

.@FCC majority‚Äôs proposal to dismantle #openinternet rules is frightening in its disregard for the actual experiences of #consumers.
#Broadband is a necessity in the 21st century and access to it allows the most vulnerable among us to hold on during our darkest moments.
In late 90‚Äôs &amp; early ‚Äò00s #broadband investment was highest ever. Guess what? This occurred under #Title2 w/ unbundling &amp; line sharing rules
Permission-less #innovation has been the bedrock of American #internet policy for decades. Why then is @FCC majority gutting #netneutrality?
Rollback of #netneutrality deeply damages @FCC ability 2 be a champion of consumers and competition in the 21st century. Not #ConsumersFirst

Yet to see a credible analysis that suggests #broadband provider capital expenditures have declined as a result of 2015 #openinternet order.
Using interpretive gymnastics to shirk competition and consumer protection responsibilities is the antithesis of putting #ConsumersFirst.

.@TMcSweenyFTC, we both support efforts in Congress to pass meaningful privacy legislation and encourage cross agency collaboration.
@TMcSweenyFTC , Consumers need and want more and better privacy choices. Our complementary expertise is just what consumers need.
.@TMcSweenyFTC, Protecting free and open internet drives innovation. Eliminating clear rules would place us in uncharted territory.
. @TMcSweenyFTC , Applying differing FTC and FCC tools and expertise in a complementary manner protects consumers and businesses.
.@TMcSweenyFTC, you raise a good point about multiple cops on the beat for privacy. FTC and FCC have worked well together on this.

Live interview with @OfficialRFDTV about today's @FCC vote on independent programming. https://t.co/ckP1s5XBKa
#Independent and #diverse voices are necessary for a vibrant media landscape. @FCC proposes rules to level the playing field.
Despite strong #ratings and rave #reviews from viewers, the cruel reality is that independent programmers live by a different set of rules.
The @FCC seeks to strengthen investment in #broadcast industry by streamlining rules and procedures for foreign ownership reviews.
Today the @FCC modernizes¬†our¬†Wireless Emergency Alert #WEA system: A¬†#LifeSaving tool.
Independent and diverse voices are the foundation of a vibrant media landscape. Read my new op-ed: https://t.co/NLdc9GTLHd

It's our duty to ensure consumers continue to receive critical service functionality, like calling 9-1-1 #TechTransitions
When it comes to the most vulnerable in our society, we cannot have, nor can we afford to have a disconnected community #TechTransitions
@FCC #TechTransitions Order will ensure that consumers receive in the future, what they expect now: reliable and secure, voice service.
There must be room for #5G offerings that benefit those in the urban high-rent district, as well those struggling in the rural prairies
As we collectively figure out just what #5G is, we must not forget pockets in this nation where people still live in a 2G and 3G reality
The next #wireless evolution promises to fundamentally change the way we live, interact, and engage with our #communities #SpectrumFrontiers

@FCC received 27k+ consumer complaints on #billing in the first 6 months of 2016. Providers should improve disclosure of below-the-line fees
It's imperative that we ensure low-income Americans can reap the benefits of #5G and are not left in digital darkness #ConnectingCommunities
We can and must do more to make sure those economically disadvantaged are not priced out of digital opportunity #ConnectingCommunities
Common refrain for robust #competition, affordably-priced #communications services and policies that will enable #innovation to flourish.

@FierceWireless Enjoyed the conversation - look forward to continuing to engage with all of you on twitter. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless important to note.  the reserve won't deter largest companies from participating. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless They won't deter broadcaster entry b/c auction rules promote more competition, which means robust bidding. #clyburnfcc
@httponline @FCC 3 auctions since 2008 &amp; rules to promote competition &amp; incentivize service to local communities. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless I won't apologize for being vigilant on enforcement. If no one breaks the rules, there are no fines. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless ..which will be managed by the Spectrum Access System database.  These means, like unlicensed, no need for an auction.
@FierceWireless That would be my hope. Great innovation in the 3.5 GHz Band will enable 80 MHz of spectrum for license by rule... 1 of 2
@FierceWireless @WillRinehart we employ a team of experts, including economists, to develop policy recommendations. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless Fear-mongering.  We adopted an order to provide spectrum just last month. https://t.co/jCZFsRvP73 #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless We need to make sure LTE-U can co-exist with wifi. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless But, I am glad that Chairman Wheeler opened up a proceeding by issuing a Public Notice. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless Wi-Fi advocates claim that a version of LTE-U is being developed.
@FierceWireless We're working hard to free up spectrum.  Also will streamline siting of comms towers &amp; other facilities. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless Encourage industry to think about long-term data needs asap.  For ex: http://t.co/Smgnmhk7jL #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless @FCC is only requiring consumers be notified before copper is retired. my stmt: http://t.co/981ijuiVcm #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless there are still people &amp; companies still dependent on copper.  They need time to plan &amp; adjust.  #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless @ntia has been great partner in effort, will continue to work with them.  Beyond that, Congress must act.#clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless Last year, an apprentice ship program was launched to ensure workers receive proper training. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless Our wireless networks are expanding at an amazing rate, but we can‚Äôt lose sight of those who build. #clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless One tower worker fatality is one too many. We have a special responsibility when it comes to their safety.#clyburnfcc
@FierceWireless @SayreEvan By encouraging them to identify specific needs &amp; encourage sharing. #clyburnfcc
3) smaller license areas and license blocks &amp; updated competitive bidding rules encourage small companies 3 of 3 #mclyburnfcc
.@FierceWireless 2) encourage small biz interested in serving local areas will increase wireless company participation.  2 of 3 #mclyburnfcc

The broadband speeds of yesteryear are woefully inadequate today and beyond @FCC
Within 3 years, large wireless companies must have a solution to automatically send vertical info when you dial 911 from a cellphone.
I commend Chairman Wheeler for rules that will help first responders find us when we are in danger and dial 911 from cellphones indoors.
All Americans are relying on #FCC to advance new E- 911 standards. Literally lives are at stake.
