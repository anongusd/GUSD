@davidjo18019614 @donna_jacobsen @mkibbe @RandPaul @RepThomasMassie And Rand Paul said he will vote against the president, sad, the republicans who never leave Washington but are imitated by the Democrats. Those who oppose the president don't every expect to be re-elected.
@WSJ Try a ATM, cash is always better. The electronic transfer only benefits the banking system and marketing as they monitor your choices and where and how you spend money. They use that data for marketing and product controls.
@nypost Maybe that is where the Mayor's wife invested that 980 million dollars that's missing. What kill babies but sex parlors are OK. Then why hassle the Patriots owner in Fla. He should of had female company in NY, not a problem.
@JackPosobiec We can allow Cortez to hire and give staff member's access to the WH with I question how they are paid 52k a year and the democrats question a security clearance. Should run her and her staff through the system. I had security checks in the Navy and DOD work
@HKaaman @joe_nuzz War is not a pleasant moment for all involved. but, there are the good guys and there are bad guys. The world needed to end ISIS and such a high price on both sides because of Ideology , as stupid as the Democrats spending all their time trying to destroy the Republicans.
Senate Democrats have enough Republican support to terminate Trump’s national emergency https://t.co/KI3lLqPJ6e If they refuse the president, I look forward to the continued influx of immigrants and want to see what they do than.
@IsraelUSAforevr @tagruber Very cool people who kept a level head and helped the bird.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt 2 out of millions not a great example.
https://t.co/q6VvZ24mNo Actually, some tree species whose roots can extend 50 feet get into the water mains and gas lines and GOD forbid your cable TV service. They are nice for shade but cost millions of dollars in damage
@McTwatsAlot @JoanneSzafrani1 @woodyjwd @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Way ahead of you for 40 years, catch-up.
@KMTheWolf @JoanneSzafrani1 @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump You hit the nail on the head! Own a sailboat in Puget Sound and get to work 10 hours later to Seattle. In Minneapolis kayak to work only 2 hours. or from NJ to Manhattan by bike 6 hours depends on traffic. Of course we are using the expressways we built once for cars huh!
@TNTLEE34 @MickGollihue @realDonaldTrump Great hat, wish here in Thailand I could buy one!
@cnni 1 child rule in China but, how many robots are you allowed to have instead?
@business run a ratio of 350 million to what country you compare to. Cuba with a population of Jun 15, 2018 ... Cuba's population has remained relatively flat at 11.49 million, nearly Oct 29, 2018  New York City  8.55. How do you compare the US also when over half are immigrants
@USATODAY Calif. can't complain of droughts any more.
@KellyLEstes @JoanneSzafrani1 @IlhanMN Funny, because Muslims recognize a God but of a different name. She is just evil of anyone who is white.
@CNN Can't wait to see a remake of Saturday Night Fever with Robots, NOT! Pouring a drink, Cortez you out of a job when we kick you out of congress.
@RT_com Trump's one-liners at CPAC  - 'They are trying to take you out with bulls**t'. Won't print the word Bullshit but OK with Motherfucker against the president.
@nypost Your funny, take that idea to China, forgot you can't vote there. Russia, no, EU, no where in the world does a 16 year old have the insight to vote outside of being manipulated by social media and never worked???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt $4 and that is a regular coffee. Millennial's are the juveniles of the 21st century. I'll live long enough to see what they have done and impacted society and it is not positive. They talked about the 60's that changed America but not in the direction these young people are.
@chuckwoolery Chuck, no need to speak politics anymore. Wear a hat or tee-shirt and your CNN news story from the left.
@MichaelAvenatti What's the matter Mike, SNL isn't funny when it is you being laugh at or your clients.
@RealJamesWoods He just got a lesson in Ohms law.
@CNN Hey, Bernie sell your houses and work for $15 an hour maybe someone would believe you.
@NBCNews She does know that other culture exists like me being Irish/Canadian. I guess see has no problem with the history of the Mafia in the US. That's right, before she was born and then all of millions who arrived at Ellis Island and yes some were Jews Omar. Henry Ford hired Iranians
@TheMaverick_M Her answer, I guess I put to many zeros on the check at Macy's. Don't worry my husband will cover it.
@RealJamesWoods And so it begins. Hey, Democrats did they bring the Mumps with them or suddenly catch it in Texas. I wonder how CNN will report this. OH! breaking news medical problems with immigrant children in detention prisons in Texas, free them into the general population no problem.
@JackPosobiec Just like in a bar; We have a right to refuse service to customers, so, a convention is no different. Party Brasher. Move on to a Communist meeting.
@RealJamesWoods The future of America if we keep allowing such cultures into our society. For hundreds of years America welcome all people but, now is the time to be more selective.
@RT_com Wish I had a girlfriend like that to cover my back in the world of Democrats and liberals.
@TheMaverick_M @BreitbartTexas How many were legal US citizens!
@Bmw2163Heart @mglessman He started by taking their personal weapons.
@RealJamesWoods @norman60007248 I went down a mountain in a semi at 16 and it was not pretty let it go. Smart people learn to bury the past. The go fund act is east to prey on people. Getting your ass kicked is not the worst thing.What about the truck driver during the Rodney King. King got money driver O
@1776Stonewall Wait I'm confused, 2 years busting Mr. Trumps and within weeks we find the dirt on the girls of congress. So, Muller was is your problem 2 years and nothing but weeks and we see the real Democratic party members. Muller needs to find a real job. he sucks at investigative work.
@hardball It's not the presidents return as he donates his paycheck. They digging into his corporation which the family runs. Stop dragging the president into this anymore. better check all POLITICIANS  who have over $100 in their savings account. Try Bernie! and others.
@MrFin @Cocoa_Bean10 @elguapo64 You missed a few words. Democrats only!
@4YrsToday @ohlmanvickie Not yet, but he is on track.
@SheriffClarke @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump Thank you, this guy has been a hustler for 40 years just liking to be notice and say crap to continued to be noticed.
@CPAC @realDonaldTrump CJ PearsonVerified account	 @thecjpearson  .@AOC is going around calling black conservatives “tokens”.   The idea that any black person - who thinks for themselves - is a “token” is not only wrong but its unapologetic racist. Mr. Trump you should invite this young to WH.
@latimes Over 4 years!
@RealSaavedra There is a young man name C.J. on twitter a young Black man who sees through lies and truths like Mr. Williams who is White. These young individuals are the Republican party's future.
@washingtonpost If a child is going to be on Facebook, then this woman's creativity is welcomed since today's parents are also on Facebook talking crap rather than reading to their children and bonding.
@nypost Nigerian, anyone bother to check their Visa status.
@JoanofAmerica @LATAMforTRUMP @THEVOLUNTEER6 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn She has more balls they her husband does. That is why he Fucked an Intern in the Oval office.
@Cocoa_Bean10 @LoufromCT @BreitbartNews Read their signs, immigrants welcomed into the Western culture because they feared their own country. I think their country was happy to see them go and now our problem in the West. Is this what you want in America? freedom of religion is one thing but suggest they will rule us.
@TigerLetsRoll @CWMassey1958 We migrated from the East to the West in the beginning and the horse brought us there and without the horse we still be stuck on the East coast. There is a reason for everything. But, thinking like Cortez I miss riding a horse, but would always be late for work. To bitch like her
@YuH8TM3 @SheForest No,pledge of Alliance to the Flag of American but pray call in a school classroom? Tearing down statues of history and does not matter North or South without those struggles we would not be America. But, freely adapt a Muslim religion on school grounds while I can't salute Flag?
@mysterysolver3 @RealJamesWoods I watched the video and made me sick and mad. But, asshole did you prove this was a government facity  caring for thousands of illegal children. No, you did not lefty. it was a private day care center, again asshole.
@DoingRight1 @norman60007248 I guess Democrats only are allowed under Pelosi watch CNN brainwash news. The same methods of those who believe in Sharia Law.
@RealJamesWoods If the jealous wife laid off the potato chips more maybe the husband would dance with her.

What's next is a White actor playing MLK. That be a show stopper or the Oscars. Spike Lee can direct it.
@RyanAFournier Harris said in a statement.“No one should face harassment or  intimidation in the workplace, and victims of sexual misconduct should  be listened to, believed and protected.” So, a CONGRESSWOMAN calling the president a"MF is OK Harris. Or is it the color of your skin that matters
@AlwaysActions What happen between separation of Church and State? This is how my tax dollars are spent? When people arrived in America from the 1700's on at Ellis island, building a Mosque was not the top of their list. This is America, not Europe, Russia, China, Africa, Middle East. America!
@Condor_Law @realDonaldTrump There are a few more but in modern times these guys stand out.
@MathPhysics3 @dixie_normas Cortez, is this the system you want us to follow. Cortez with your social behavior and fellow new congresswoman would definitely be ban from those services ladies. Maxine included.
@DanielTurnerPTF @dixie_normas My weekend BBQ's and my Harley, this woman has to go. As for snow blowers which mean work but with her I get money anyway for my BBQ's.
@Condor_Law Anyone remember the days of book burning by the governments and yet a person does it and he gets prison. Germany still should have a eye kepted on them. They never liked losing 2 wars they started to be the master race. Wants NATO buts deals with Russia???????
Volcanic activity is melting this Antarctic glacier from below https://t.co/upL9lXEk8i Green Deal people people read some information that is real not CNN or listen to a dumb senator from Hawaii. And she lives on a Volcanic island?
@Condor_Law @AOC @Greenpeace @greenpeaceusa @gatewaypundit It’s not climate change alone that is causing the thaw. New  research by the National Science Foundation has found evidence that volcanic activity beneath the glacier is a likely culprit. People need to read more Cortez. I'm enjoying my beef Burger now with bacon to.
@Condor_Law @AOC @Greenpeace @greenpeaceusa @gatewaypundit And this is Greenpeace talking, she won't listen and others who follow her.
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Senator, you need to look and understand that the earth flips every so many years. Our MAGNETIC core has shifted again and does several feet per year, also you're not aware of the Volcanoes under the ARCTIC CIRCLE which is heating the Arctic, Titanic plates shifts naturally,
@thecjpearson @AOC C.J. follow your instincts and beliefs but, don't chose a side and become like her. Be rational, non-judgemental and most of all bias. The truth and proper balance of government is to see and argue both sides to make decisions that effect all parties. Cortez is one dimensional.
@Condor_Law @SadiqKhan @BreitbartNews The western countries opend their hearts, their homes. access to services they never had. Give them jobs and opened our pocket books. And what happens they bring their cultural problems and act like they are in their own country. If they wish to do that, than send them home.
@AnnThacker2 @JoanneSzafrani1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yea, his walk shows he was exhausted,
@Condor_Law @kdeleon We should shake Cortez family tree and see what falls.
Trump’s Surprising New Ally in Mexico? The Government https://t.co/OzN4cNeg0a It's about time because sooner or later this migrants will settle in Mexico and in tourist centers which is easy money and that brings the criminal element. Those types who don't make it into the US.
@Independent To bad we can't do it the US, half of the New Democratic congress would go to jail where they belong.
@seanhannity If her staff doesn't believe or enforce her demands/policies why should America believe anything she say's or endorses. But, the staff member got his 52k salary. And who authorized that? Staff eat beef, America allowed Tofu? She Vodka.
@latimes Comparing Mr.Reagan to Harris is so left field. Reagan knew America since his days before congress when he wasn't in politics. They governor and after president. She slept her way into politics. Knowing the country that's a laugh. All those years what has she done in politics?
@donna_jacobsen @KamalaHarris Kamala Harris lied - Oops. It’s difficult to straddle that fence without getting stuck! NO!, If a person had the inner strength and skills they would clear the fence and leave those behind you are not ready to clear hurdles or they pause in the middle of an obstacle or paid TV
@chuckwoolery Joe Biden is getting advice from social media executives on how best to appeal to young voters. Hey, when he finds out what these new young Dem's are like on the social media, I wouldn't run for president as a Democrat with the knowing and take support of the social media crowd
@nypost Oh! She wanted to be a political rock star and she got her wish. Now, she will feel and learn, not, what with words people and media will scrutinize you just as you and others in congress push on Mr. Trump, family, business, friends. Remember, now you will get a taste of it, Star
@DineshDSouza Jim Acosta gloats over Trump not getting a deal: “It's strike one in Singapore, he didn’t get a deal...Now, it’s strike two in Hanoi. Mr. Trump and SK president working only 7 months of dialog and other presidents in 50 years did nothing and no deal or even visited with NK JIM JO
@TheMarkPantano @SheForest won’t do as well as their parents because their wages are stagnant and they are drowning in debt. Parents went to school and got an education. Debt stop buying phones and video games. Get a real job, move out of the basement. Life is not a party or TV or Facebook. Its called work
@rosedixontx @donna_jacobsen If its good enough for the military and federal workers and the private sector than yes. People elected to government should be held accountable just like everyone else. Can we start with Cortez.
@dbongino Pushed away, walked out! Interesting how the media just can't say talks concluded and negotiating teams on both sides will continue talks including  South Korean and Japan updates. While Russia is coming in on the back door, Putin invited Kim. This is a test where Kim will go.
@RealJamesWoods And bring along a few books while you wait. IE; VA ankle fusion, check, 5 months later chop chop. Bangkok. bad back, spinal surgery 36 hours later. Paid hospitals or government run hospitals. bring your Visa.
Crimes are committed by many natural born US citizens. But, the amount of such crimes by illegals of all countries hiding in the shadows of America are a threat that be control with border security and immigration enforcement, over stayers etc.. https://t.co/zMKgzZq78e
@hardball HIC digs into the Trump group. They many industries such as Amazon, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, and the long list with investment houses and banks should be this deeply checked to see where money comes from and where it goes and how it is used. Want corruption control, get them all.
@NBCNews Was it just me who watched and hear Trump say; I could of signed but the hangup was about areas Kim wouldn't give access to. Other than that those first steps would have happen and still might
@nypost Yea, you can see and count all those smiling faces in NYC.
@susanannemiller @donna_jacobsen @realDonaldTrump I wish they use the word concluded instead the interpretation of Walkout. I believe they went as far as possible and decided to conclude the meeting and let the teams of both parties to work it out. #1 saves Nam, security forces, hotel staff, police extra work plus secret service
@chuckwoolery She should considering she has practice enough in front of her mirror.
@SuperEliteTexan @donna_jacobsen Ruthless teenagers and the other people standing there watching. The ttip of the ice berg and not just 1 on 1 but many attacked that kid kicking into the head to inflect the most hurt. I would like to know of what happened after.
Republicans pressure Trump to back down on border emergency https://t.co/rTFiFwzWFh Alexander told reporters afterward, referring to billions from a drug forfeiture fund and anti-drug smuggling money at the Defense Department. Then the emergency call would change, but still get $
Republicans pressure Trump to back down on border emergency https://t.co/rTFiFwzWFh Alexander told reporters afterward, referring to billions from a drug forfeiture fund and anti-drug smuggling money at the Defense Department. When El Chappo gets convicted got his $$ to
@WohlFoundation @EMouthy Neither, time to move on in current time and leave parts of the past in the past.
@Condor_Law @POTUS The presidents limo is not a Uber service. Of the dozens of individuals whose job is to get security tight which includes 24/7 eyes on the vehicles. that said like to know who they are Somlleet and friends to defend you to. Watch your lies or they will get you in trouble. or TV!
@RT_com Mr. Putin is fit, but this guy pure Bad Ass and he has his own weapon available. I hope he found a smoke.
@TheOfficerTatum @EricBonillo Thank you Mr.Tatum for recognizing everyone is on the hook for something but not because of the color of their skin. Everyone is plowing through the new challenges in 21st, but color is the least of the obstacles.
@thecjpearson @EricBonillo C.J. its your future and hope more younger people take the hard look of what is real and what is propaganda regardless of which side commits it. But,the Rolling Stone is nothing more than RS making big$ witches of D.C get a new Christmas card photo which will fad away. Don't quit
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Mr. Graham sir, enjoy that one slice of success pie at a time before you get to the next slice. Eventually, you'll get to enjoy the whole pie for why is baked.
Just watched the Live feed with Trump and Kim. Heard from the horses mouth. Look forward how the left will chop pieces of old words and twist what was said on Live TV. to suit their undermining not only the president but the country which they live in. Are the paychecks the draw? https://t.co/q9kkhh5NCo
Mark Meadows Shuts Down Rashida Tlaib With Blistering Public Rebuke (Video) https://t.co/iJIGSVv87W I think Talbid got a taste of eating crow after Mr. Meadows told of mixed family currently which she did not know. This is the leadership of the new Democrats?
@charliekirk11 You don't hear many wearers of Black Lives Matter as you hear and see a RED hat with M.A.G.A on it turn people into a hater.its like in schools kids wearing colors,to show what gang they belong to.Besides Somllett bullshit lies of a wearer of a red hat. If a hat can trigger, wow!
@USATODAY This was a hearing about Mr. Cohen, what babbling about race Tlaib is so unqualified to be in the position she is in the represent a congress member.
@CNBC I think his credit is good! Waiting on the Government check for the rocket launches it all works out.
@willripleyCNN @CNN Having traditional dishes from Asia may be to spicy for the entourage of Mr. Trumps and no one wants to run to the toilet during talks. Same for the Asia's western cuisine may no be their taste delight either. I was in Saudi and offered the Goats Eye I ate it but only once.
@RyanAFournier So, what's with the Yellow Vest mean?
@daisylueboo1 OOps! I sent to you can you retweet to Greta.
@daisylueboo1 Buy a empty Sears store  space to configure room floor plans. plumping for a large person base, all the power, parking. A/c training facilities space/visitor  maybe a shop of hand made crafts, internet, maybe bring in a medical service. in house pharmacy etc. 1 floor Train staff
@USATODAY Allegations go back to 2015, meaning the reported assaults started under the Obama administration. In the past four years, 4,556 children said they were sexually assaulted while in the care of Health and Human Services' By who, officials, kitchen workers people in the group?
@PattyMurray So,single women and men help foot the bill for those individuals. Every penny counts in my wallet.But the big dilemma is that you are forcing a cost on the public like Obama care mandates.Besides the program your forcing employers to paid 3 months leave.if I call in sick I get3m$
@Condor_Law @ShannonBream @FoxNews Fox states she could face deportation what? A no brainier. Inch by inch to enforce our laws. How did she get here? Find employer and nail them. I said in another tweet, cut off the support system and it will help deter. They made be nice people but some use our systems flaws.
@JackPosobiec @AOC Anyone have the picture to make a old man's day?
@Condor_Law @SpeakerPelosi Nancy needs to recheck her body bag count of illegals who have done this same crime. But,they to track his 18 years here, Employer, nail him, credit for truck, nail them, landlord, nail them. Closing the support availability is a tool to curb, illegals, visa over stayers use ICE.
Pit Bull from Dog Fighting Ring Placed on Death Row, Now Changing Lives With Her Second Chance https://t.co/5lQ0aAjJog I have a female Staffordshire Terrier and it gets looks but, she is kind because I've always shown affection. Smart on commands, plays with small and big dogs OK
@AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump Mr. Bolton get it done so Mr. Trump can focus on the next 6 years and have a Ace card for the re-election only if you guys pull this off. You've been around and can make it happen.
@MSNBC Documents more than 4,550 of sexual misconduct against  migrant children the Office of Refugee Resettlement fiscal years 2015 and 2018.. So, check the years 2015, Obama. 2016 just starts with Trump. But what is the influx amount compared to 2015.
@dbongino Question? How does see approve the salary amount and authorizes the accounting office. There must be a budget director at the WH for WH payroll?
@RealJamesWoods Maybe a few Bitcoins to boot.
@RealJamesWoods Or better yet a wheel-barrel full peso's 1 benjamin =956 peso's it looks better " A Fist Full of Dollars"
@nypost I hope he is OK. I'm a disabled Vet at 63 and get around slowly with my walker and sadly i carry the second amendment with me as I fear the same in this day and age. I always hit my target.
@washingtonpost I think you will see a few surprises, keep the presses open.
@JackPosobiec Cool, does she have a sister?
@willsommer @eugenedelgaudio Well,to Jacob my mind is still intact and to manipulate my thoughts with who to vote for on Twitter which has a lot of smart followers from diverse backgrounds, I think you chosen the wrong way to waste your time and ours.
@thehill @RepAndyBiggsAZ Thank you for the informative video and i question why have i never seen such news worthy news such as this on CNN ?
@realDonaldTrump @mglessman Your there sir as my commander and chief perform that function and that stuff from Dem's and media is or should be on the back burner. Focus on NK. Make the DEAL that hasn't been seen since the End of the Vietnam war. This Kid wants to open he is not that stupid, my believe.
@seanhannity First time in Asia on the street level??
@Acts17 @joe_nuzz @AOC Thanks, since I'll be will be here hear for 20 more years I must pay your debt? Send me the keys to your house, cars, and boats and wife's phone number first please in 12 years. Sorry, forget the wife the rest is OK my address is America.
@ScottAdamsSays @Cernovich Now if this guy ran for the Democratic party it would be scary, but than Cortez would be confused.
@hodgetwins I'm thinking AFRO_MAN I was going to run all day but dick got in the WAY, then I got High then I got High!
@billyraybryant @HalibutCheeks1 @billyraybryant  your not of old school or not a man. When a  man shakes your hand where I come from that is it.
@WashTimes And then we get more Cortez's.
@billyraybryant @HalibutCheeks1 I've been living an educating in South East Asia for 14 years, and before that 9 years in the Middle East and before 9 years in the Navy in Europe so, as you laugh what time in country do you have. Oh! I forgot India.
@mitchellvii FREE entertainment, better than the Oscars!
@Pappiness @realDonaldTrump Did you go Nick or every serve?
@HalibutCheeks1 @billyraybryant Wrong! A man is a Man that's it. I or him will never dress as a freak to show tolerance to a 3,4,5 gender question BULLSHIT girl.
@Pappiness @realDonaldTrump did you go?
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Does it not reflect the potential of Cortez being there to give free shit away!
@CAPEarlyEd @PattyMurray @BobbyScott USE CONDOMS GIRLS!
@realDonaldTrump @patobrien236 Please sir, give the Kid a break and let him be the BIGGER man in his neighborhood, it will go a long way since Mr. Nixon open China relationships. or Mr. Reagan with the Berlin wall coming down. make 1 mark in history which will always respect you sir.
@IsraelUSAforevr @ImDeplorable16 He didn't get it then only to high 5 basketball players now and sign his book.
@SAndrew76 Buy one if you can with a 455cub inch
@MIRedState @RebeccaFaussett So sad!
@SAndrew76 I was thinking my favorite movie Road House and his 64 Rivera. The headlights are the same.
@SAndrew76 Yea the front end threw me off like a Buick but the Fins, yes a Caddie.
@AnumeleKen @RT_com Thank you, somebody knows history.
@RT_com This asshole couldn't find Saudi Arabia on a map outside of Vermont.
@LoufromCT @dkahanerules On the day in 1973, as the Vietnam War drew to a close, the Selective  Service announced that there would be no further draft calls.
@beermanTom @mitchellvii @rkukkapalli1 My father called me a SOB because I finally fired him in WaterVille, WA country Fair. Payback, with his big grin! He and my mother made me the character I am and proud of it!
@SAndrew76 Nice Buick.
@POTUS Give the Kid a break behind closed doors, no one person wants to live like some in NK. But, he knows better but not how to release the people of NK. Let the South Korean teach him. Your job was bring the WAR  to a end officially, sir.
@CNNPolitics No news like you expect but important knowledge for the masses. Report it fairly and correctly or the misinformation you put fore is no worst than a socialistic system. Is CNN in favor of a Socialistic system, answer that!
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt They agree they should pay more taxes cool! But, unlike the President who has given his paycheck back these 2 guys they should in some point in time just before they drop dead and leave$$ to family
@mitchellvii Don't worry she will let you know when you need a haircut!
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe You chumps don't anything about what old hand shakes mean in Asia or the Middle East. Old school a handshake is a real man's word not the same  as a other gender in the USA.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt That is why Jim Jobs and him were best buddies as Apple, bullshit! I met the guy at his Mercer Island home and he was a Prick.
@CNNPolitics "existential crisis" He's funny most people do not know the  word EXISTENTIAL;	What's the saying ; Bullshit them with facts and Dazzle with Brilliance or something like that but no Democratic runner-up is that smart.
Mr. @POTUS please give the kid a break for the future of that Peninsula. Come home and Infrastructure giving NK a chance to compete. And VOC/TECH  training for the skills for the infrastructure. Screw the Democratics get a head start in real time sir.
@Richard43970320 Help building the wall and save a life!
@latimes And Mr. Trump wasn't president and there was no Paris accord on climate change huh! maybe just a normal cycle but that sounds to easy to explain 50 years difference.
@Condor_Law @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just like Smolltee she should be arrested for false claims. #1 Why would a fired employee be in the presidents limo? What did the Secret Service said? The Limo driver? The people at the car entrance the president doesn't open his own door. This right after the Oscars huh!
@chicktotheright @Tiredofweirdos So, if transgender let them compete with the same gender what ever that is. I'm still in shock Bruce Jenner wins the decathlon and now a what?
@1776Stonewall @donna_jacobsen @BreitbartNews And free dental and college with 3 squares a day and a date if you want one. Who wouldn't want to go to prison with this cold climate change and still get a cow burger before the Dem's change their minds.
@Jali_Cat @donna_jacobsen WoW! To much time at the airport lounge drinking those free drinks. Sounds like me on News Years eve or the next morning. Go Party Nancy! The Democrats what a group that will be remembered in history and not for a positive reasons, making Mr.Trump's job so easy.
@guardiannews Cry Baby!
@CGTNOfficial Easy to say when a average worker living in a cubical earns $15 a day.
@quickslanding @donna_jacobsen I'm ex-Navy and it depends where and what he was taking pictures of. Security is important in the military.I had a secret clearance because of the aircraft i was assigned to and never took photos of inside the cockpit or manuals, if this person was doing it well, investigate.
@cnni A pain in the ass .In Asia helpful. In the western airports your a nuisance.
@IvankaTrump @LindaSuhler Check out CCVTS, Camden County Voc/Tech School in NJ. I and my brother attended. I went on to a great career in aviation and my brother who works for the government became a scientist for the military. Voc/tech training for all the early release individuals that can be train.
@IvankaTrump @spweber54 @realDonaldTrump Nudge your father my president, I like to start hearing about infrastructure rebuilding and the jobs will follow.
@washingtonpost 2 years in the making getting boring. Access to all the data and still no results. Only the news media making money and don't want it to end. Don't worry you'll have 4 more years to hassle my president buy stock options now while you can or Cortez will take your money.
@CBSNews His record company or he doesn't have 100,00 to get out of jail. OH !well, so much for close friends huh!
@business Give average wage workers more credit cards why don't you.
@cnni She attended George Washington University graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Museum studies.And a CEO, why doesn't CNN mention that when a Somali in congress supporting ISIS which Saudi Arabia helps to fight against. The Princess is not the same as this new congress.
@politico Doesn't the world have more to worry about than a person getting laid? Now if unlike Kelly doing minors than yes but, these are legal age women. Try nailing more RAPIST and DOMESTIC violence people.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Thanks to news media like you and CNN. Your part of the problem not solution.
@thehill Public report, give us the ALL  documents on President Kenndy's .
@CNN A Billionaire in a hot tub with cute young women, so he gave them money. Do you give your wife or girlfriend money for shopping and they you get sex later. What is the difference. Like at 77 it will effect him, your funny. I'm 63 in Asia and do it all the time. Its normal CNN,
@raducom @QueenMlm @EinsteinMaga @mymynags @KamyMAGA @Serremmy @DFBHarvard @MAGAgirly @DoingRight1 @Razorsmack1 @pjbowles4 @GeanineC @AnnThacker2 @briantopping66 @RevKeithBritt @cali_curmudgeon @OrenIShiKiddo @jonz970 @ImabitcSumtimes @JulieReichwein1 @RNinMI WOW! he was a Democratic.
@indy100 @Independent Important message to what part of America, people who don't want to go forward or repeating what 600,000 men died for in the civil war to make a change for all people. What's next burn the Declaration Of Independence, tear down the Lincoln memorial or remove all white people
High court deciding fate of cross-shaped Maryland memorial https://t.co/zOj0hw3VgF  Muslims can build a Mosque and Blair pray Via loud speakers and yet a 100 tribute for local servicemen is not acceptable. Find don't look at it. if you have no faith what the FUCK is your Problem!
My President does listens and understands. https://t.co/pQ5GVs3GI8
@TIME Safe for him
@CBSNews Hope he stays unlike a person in SF who wants the cat removed from the Fire Dept. house cat. Illegals are OK in CA. But not a house comfort creature of GOD
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It takes to make a good decision. Cut the young guy some slack and again , he needs to save face an Important part of Asian BASIC culture.Give a little and the world will be rewarded. Regardless of the war horses think. Judge the man not the people of NK who deserve a better life
@JackPosobiec I watched Green Book which is something I did not know even as I lived through the 50's-60's. As a kid traveling in a Carnie family I saw racism first hand but,going town to town I didn't see color only people having a good time on the Midway, eating cotton candy and riding rides
@thehill @HillTVLive Pollster Dan Cox. this kid as a POLLSTER with these views belongs on Cortez payroll to keep all stupid people in the same room. A POLLSTER predicating economical futures. Hey, Warren what do you think?
@CBSNews The people who are given this med for a reason. Can't blame the system only the users and the doctors which are some that give it out like candy. Control the doctors who issue the drug also.
@NPR I taken that you have never been to India or any other foreign culture. Your an  armchair writer want to be writer, sad.
@realDonaldTrump @MickGollihue Asia and save face crap. Cut the guy a deal and the people of NK will grow into the wonders of the 21st century that they have no idea exist. Look at the Middle East, I worked there in the 80'-90's look at the change after the wars that open their eyes and potential. Iran is next
@HuffPost Cute in his purple dress, he must think he is Prince!
@USATODAY What because it wasn't radical enough to make news for people like you. It told a story pf American history. Black panther is a sci-fi movie that's all. And Spikes KKK movie is a true story but raised questions of negative history. I can watch that crap on your media or CNN
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Give up a phone that is smarter than user for a year, Gosh, how did Lewis and Clark, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Patton and don't forget Mr. Bell have ever they got through life without a smart phone? I guess the telegraph isn't cold enough Western Union.
@CBSNews Hell no! Get his information anyway you can and send him to Gitmo.
@RealSaavedra People should not have children,I agree if you can't care for them and raise to have a future. That being said in Africa, South America, Middle East and Asia need to control births in those regions. having 8 children and living in a refuge camp is no future. To bad Cortez made it
@Independent Maybe people are exhausted of seeing violent movies of racism which I can watch on CNN and get a prospective view of history that dealt with racism that effected both the Black and White cultures. The informative subject of the Green Book was enlightening to many not of that era.
@nypost Who dress them a blind drunk person?
@Trump454545 @RebeccaFaussett And Democrats and socialist want to destroy our country. You have people in the Democratic party talking racism, defending ISIS, stripping Americans of their personal rights. The Gay community think the world owes them something. Tell me would a Transgender solider jump on it?
@DeptVetAffairs 17 months in appeal process for my service connected disabilities. No updates. Even my lawyer can't get an answer, what is wrong with you people. You do not support Vets like the lies you tell the general public. I served my country and this is what I get.
Spike Lee on 'Green Book's' Controversial Oscars Best Picture Win: "Ref Made a Bad Call" https://t.co/F4tI4vYEZz Jealous of a film that a black actor won an award.Spike Lee crying like a baby. What's up with the Black community no pleasing them. What if a India, Chinese movie won
‘The Monsters Are the Men’: Inside a Thriving Sex Trafficking Trade in Florida https://t.co/CP8R4z6Zht No one asked the big question: What visa are they on, how were they sponsored and in Thailand you need a round trip ticket and proof where you will stay,hotels, apts. etc.
Adam Levine's Nipples During Super Bowl Spark Complaints to FCC About Gender Equality https://t.co/GZdsrjfNIA Gender equally? So, when I go to the beach without a shirt on and my nipples are exposed than a woman can show off her breast or just the Nipples. I'm confused.
@ShawnG927 @JoanneSzafrani1 @TWITMO_INMATE @Maggieb1B @Brenderm1 @winstonCovfefe @McguireScotty @OutOfRegister @midwestright @gsteck74 @MagaGoldHat @DoingRight1 Great role model for Smollett.
@LoufromCT I was in Russia in 91,92 and 93. I was in Moscow where more goods were available in the expensive Western stores.But,I Bernie never made it to central Russia where you stand in line with a chit to get a half a loaf of bread They after you pay for that item you get a chit for eggs
@SenatorCantwell And that means using birth control and not having single individuals pay for some women's bad choices My tax dollars can be better spent Hand out condoms without the Federal government being responsible for women's health Again, never hear about men's need for federal health care
@USATODAY So ,he supports racism if a Black man displays it but gets angry if a White person display racism.He must be like the Black senator in Nebraska who calls our Flag a Rag. But, if he wants something he waves it. Look at what he has and he spits on America people supporting Smollett
@nypost Tell you what NYP, she can come here and we send your asses to Syria and you can have all of the ISIS brides still there. After they are not picky who they screw. Being a socialist supporter like you. you'll fit right in.
@thehill The morning Laurel and Hardy show except the real ones were funny and American.
@DanCrenshawTX Confused, I thought Cortez was the "BOSS".
@realDonaldTrump @SheForest Make a deal with NK Mr. President, he wants one but the saving face crap gets in the way. Before China and Russia moves in with a better deal. Give the guy a little slack.
@McAllisterDen @SheForest So, a Mom and Pop shop must pay for 3 months for an employee that has a baby. That is why I would only hire single Males who are sterile or women who are sterile. Why should my income suffer because a person has a baby?
@RealSaavedra "What I just say", yea, our school system is working well, not. Cortez on Dr. Phil is a new version of Jerry Springer.
@IngrahamAngle @USATODAY She was not able to handle children's questions but yet she is a elected official Oh!my.
@RobChristie11 @daisylueboo1 Very cute!
@rakri99 @gex_daniel Of course its NY.
@LydiaLynn89 @gex_daniel Ass!
@mitchellvii @AOC Quiet, let the kiddies in the Democratic party beat each other up and see who's left standing. My bet at the last minute Biden will come in and rescue the Dem's or at least try.
@dixie_normas No TSP sorry, work to remove the Dictator  with the support of the people. With thousands storming our borders with a similar situation. Fix the situations not open more new problems for Mr. Trump.
Terrence Howard Expresses Support for Jussie Smollett After Felony Charge: 'We Love the Hell Outta You' https://t.co/4V9mRRCq2W Won't watch anymore of his flicks, he's as stupid and racist as Smollett Homie!
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit The other Democrats can't be this stupid to let this bartender influence the party. This is going to be a easier win for Mr. Trump then in 2016.
@Michael_MBA @Farm_Machinery_ So we don't need 1/2 million immigrants to do this work any more just as many other industries have displaced workers.
@MSNBC And your point is?
@RT_com I bet Cortex could sell them the cows we no longer can have on earth. But, wait why were cattle here to start with? They mission was to wipe out humans?
@TalbertSwan Please tell me this person was arrested for assault.
@USATODAY Who cares so we can hear more bullshit about politics instead of watching the real meaning of the Oscars. They have their paycheck, go home turn off the TV its as boring as Hollywood is these days. I don't need to know or hear what screw-ups there are.
@Franklin_Graham @joe_nuzz @realDonaldTrump @VP Prays are great but seeing action from Democrats to keep this nation it stands for is there problem We need to pray for them to come to their senses and purge our society of those who are working hard to destroy what America stands for and blood lost to be this great nation again
Abuse at levels of America. What happen to my country? https://t.co/2gqRLjr9lg
@TalbertSwan @garyvickers123 I'm a busted up Vet living in Thailand for that exact reason. here I get respect and when I need help they help. I did 4 months in one and saw terrible behavior of SOME  of the care givers. But, with the new generation holding those jobs it will get worst.
@DavidJHarrisJr @ElaineS74713643 Americans need to stop being nice in the world and take people like him out of the system of government. Liberals how can you even stand there and call yourself an America when this animal calls our Flag a rag. Some of you have lost someone defending the FLAG, stand-up.
@GregNorberg @garyvickers123 And the worst part is this is a nation wide food chain and TACO BELL let's this happen. This is just the beginning when like in MN other cultures do as they did in their countries. We welcome immigrants and this is what happens in America.
@HuffPost Hey Lemon, what do call when a Black man Jussie Smollett faking an attack accusing White people had attacked him and put a rope around his neck. Is that not a Black skinhead stirring up a cause of domestic terrorist act? Or is that acceptable in your view because he is Black?
@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace Because on like you he waited to get FACTS  and not sell a story.
@thecjpearson @eugenedelgaudio @WhiteHouse Good to see a young man focused on the future and doesn't see color.
@business I lived and worked in Saudi training the RSAF from 1987-1995 and the transformation and progress they have made is amazing. Forget China and Russia this country is ready to be a positive power house on the world stage. If you know anything about a Arab they get want they want.
@CNN Perfect example of Obama and thankfully a ex-president. Rather, than still be involved in Politics he plays with media, bullshit dude.
@JackPosobiec The more air time she gets the more she sent's out misinformation.
@MSNBC Any comments from him about the new Congresswomen and their stability in US government?
@RT_com You guys are so full of Bullshit. Lived and worked there in Saudi for 9 years and Locust come every year at the same time like birds doing migration. Stop scaring the public assholes.
@RealJamesWoods I live in Thailand and to watch the vendors all day and night dump everything down the drain ditches is beyond believe, like China. Thinking the rest of the planet is going Green Democrats your crazy. Check what the street vendors are doing in Minnesota our new citizens.
@JacobAWohl I lived in St. Louis Park area, when to college there, hang out in St. Paul on the weekends. I have no problem with immigrants IF THEY ASSIMILATE  into the American way and culture we were built on. But, that is not the case. Time to move to Montana.
@RealJamesWoods @CWMassey1958 Thanks great her ass should be down on the border where our new want-a-be citizens are throwing rocks at security forces, what is she going to do hand them the KEY to the USA.
@SheForest @SuperEliteTexan I also think as a replacement bartender at Cortez old work place or better yet her office and split the difference with Nancy, and Democrats in the WH, after all how many have in their employment who are illegal already?
@CEasttwood @realDonaldTrump Mr. Eastwood, you and others got it right. Hear it from the Horses Mouth rather than and decide not by people like CNN. You made my Day!
@ScottAdamsSays @CNN Accept defeat possible, But the big question is what a socialist Democratize system will do? They haven't done shit in 8 years and still no plan except Green, no Beef, No Cars your out of your FUCKING mind , move out of my soil that I lay blood to as a serviceman.
@TomFitton @boston25 She's lucky I'm in a wheelchair and I would of Bitch slapped her and if continued to touch me as a assault I would of shot her in the foot.
@DanCrenshawTX @dixie_normas The left are trying to draw the rest of us into a weak nation and think this soil of America is a playground of all of the wars we fought, the people who died believing what America is and will be. I can't wave my flag or wear a hat what are dong in America?
@winstonCovfefe @SheForest @realDonaldTrump No other president has given his salary to others, even Kennedy from a wealthy background kept his salary. Clinton's writing books never cough up money.
@CBSNews Go to jail and get a college degree for free. So, some student debtors  should learn, commit a crime in America go to jail and get a college degree for free wow! Only in America. So, you parents don't need a second mortgage, great!
@JacobAWohl @SheForest In Minneapolis, wow!
@SuperEliteTexan @SheForest They walked through other SA countries and now getting a taste of the real world. And Democrats want to allow this mind set into America. Put all of them in DC and see what happens.
@business If Bloomberg knew anything of logistical problems then they wouldn't ask. #1 spare parts available in major hubs, NO stock piling . Ground support equipment is complicated, maint. personnel  training on foreign airports lacking and the list goes on. Sink them to make a reef
@EmmaCLong Emma, he may not be your favorite representative of us as Americans. But, do you believe in your heart a socialist direction is where America should go? Sorry, I've been to over 30+ countries and lived and worked in many and even with the flaws of our system Trump is trying.
@RT_com Its time we paid attention to our hemisphere and its problems before China and Russian dig in there. Russia threatening to launch missiles to DC.China  buying farm land and projects around the world. NOT a PR show but a wake call for the WH. Screw Europe. This is our back yard
@sdcharge2k12 @RT_com Sorry, was thinking El Chapo, either way I hope El Chapo got to watch his future
@robbystarbuck @jonhsanders2 @idrisstv I think that guy deserves a job on Empire as his replacement.
@latimes @marymacTV Tell that to the assholes who took down General Lee statue a man from WWII commander, not General R. Lee.
@business It's safer.
@ShellyCov @jonhsanders2 Not a problem Nancy?
@Condor_Law @TuckerCarlson Destroying public property is a crime and all those who did should be made to replace the statue and face criminal charges. And made to get history lessons dating back to WWI.
@RT_com I hope he got to watch in jail.
@guardiannews If anyone wants to hurt either one these guys are a moving target.
@nypost She doesn't look to happy being removed from the Trump family. But, sure the money she got will make her smile off camera.
@kidgolferman @norman60007248 No sex education in school but having babies as a teenager who believes in South Park, Facebook etc.. is the way Calif. wishes to go. How about instructing the illegal immigrants to stop popping babies also and stop using the programs like DSHS.
@cq2101 @only0787 What scientist said we have 12 years, Oh! Congresswoman Cortez.
@AMErikaNGIRL07 @norman60007248 @DineshDSouza I had to clean the Shit off my shoes after watching this. Again, these people as actors are just the jesters we paid money to watch for entertainment. For them to express support for a fellow JESTER IS SAD.
@RealJamesWoods @Condor_Law America, and you want to have kids? I think she needs to be left in Columbia and not have credit cards. Cortez should put her on the payroll to, as she said, I don't want to work. The 2 of them can do TV interviews and protest in the streets together.
@NPR Cortez should try reading her book.
@MarkDice @SCShout Who authorized such a salary for her staff? There must be someone in Congress Right or Left to control this socialist.
@PolishPatriotTM He admits it about his family and yet we don't enforce our laws WHY THE HELL NOT! I served in the military for what purpose in believing in the constitution like others before.
@nypost Do the letters F.U. mean anything?
@RealJamesWoods Getting better every day!
@Reuters @AOC No, the dog is trying to give her a taste what meat taste like.
@RealSaavedra @Cernovich Remind me, she was a waitress in NYC? Has she ever been to a farm other than seeing one on TV?
@daisylueboo1 If you dug deep into what countries own a lot of our commercial buildings and sea ports its scary just to satisfy stakeholders and shareholders who are sell-outs to America.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt A young person living in their Mom's and Dad's basement giving advice to a new job? Joke of the day. They need guidance now, rather over a period of 20 years growing up never interacted with employers before Wow!
@CNNPolitics Does it matter all new democrats act like socialist  anyway.
@BreitbartNews ONLY IN AMERICA!
@Condor_Law @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo @gatewaypundit Stay where you are on the bed you made.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Obama never inner acted with foreign leaders as Mr. Trump as.
@NBCNews Don't do the crime if you can't do the time!
@business The Rothschild dynasty is bulking up its German business to try to take on larger rivals. If anyone knows history how this family has and continues to sponsors wars around the globe since the 1800's Think bullets,copper mining for bullets, ships to ship bullets etc..
@washingtonpost Day care, stop having babies. until your old enough to support a family. Buy CONDOMS girls.
@nytopinion @nytimes I lived and worked in Saudi for 9 years and was privileged to meet with the royal family. They are the good balance between countries like Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. They are modern and progressive county of Islam. Their contact with Pakistan's new leader is a good thing.
@RealJamesWoods Aren't ISIS brides so caring. Thanks, James reminds me of mail order Russian bride.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Funny, the media pushes the idea yes, a lot of drugs come through our legal ports on entry. But,Hey wake-up what about apprehensions up nearly 100000 in fiscal year-2018 Oct 23, 2018 The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 400000 people crossing the Mexico- U.S. border in  2018
@DjLots3 @secretbetteryou @TheOfficerTatum If racism is so prevalent,  then why did #JussieSmollett have to pay a couple of Nigerians to help him pull off his hoax? At least he could of hire unemployed Americans to kick his ass. Anyone check the Nigerians Visa, work permit or a job kicking peoples asses?
@John_R_Berna @secretbetteryou @luluHru @_crazy_dog_lady @EricLevis4 @ProfSchlitzo7 @MightyNitin22 @ForEverKnite101 @AOC168 @okWessler5 @mbales250 @GordonTrema @Shar_n_Shar @FairyQ15 @BrAiNfReEzE69 @go4itbas Don't drop the soap!
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Free press does not mean to write or make a story sitting your ass in a chair in a building IE; the bullshit story of the Empire dude, never watch nor intend to. The kid with native American and it goes on and on. FREE press means FACTS, MORE FACTS. Not maybe, or,perhaps etc..
@CBSNews Complete the story of over 500 illegal chemical factories on that alley way.Check out the wiring on the poles. Sad, but avoidable. These are societies we need to help develop and bring into the 21st century, don't need Facebook.
@NBCNews There goes wet tee-shirt contest and spring break,Oh!1920 swimsuits required on all public beaches.Tattoos, tank tops forbidden.And never buy a Bikini not allowed But, wait the girls knew what they were doing right? freedom of choice, gone out the window. Dem's win again, no skin
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Look at him with the Nixon pose, you think CNN or others will break this guys spirit unlike Cohen. Fat chance.
@JackPosobiec Pay her debt, stay where you belong THERE! GO FUCK  another terrorist.
@SocialPowerOne1 Does she every work in her new taxpayers office or just be a Democratic protester poster Girl?
@RealJamesWoods Good one!
@RakeshRGoel Only if they keep stealing other countries technology and produce products that the workers earns $15 a day, of course they make profit and be a leader on the abuse of its citizens.
@Independent No worse they a clueless non communication family in the US when a child kills fellow students. You hit the nail on the head you as a parent never spent enough time to really know your child. So, he made a choice. What could you have done, be a BETTER PARENT.
@NPR Put them in prison like any other sex offender.
@CGTNOfficial Is that before or after the thousands of acres it controls for farming.
@Independent Maybe he can hire her as a maid, wait a sex slave like a ISIS fighter, no just trying to blow his importance up others ass. Thinking he fools us. he likes the attention.
@RealJamesWoods I'm a disabled Vet using a walker and a Trump supporter and second Amendment. Pity the Fool you dares touches me and I feel threaten well, bullets are cheap by the box.
@Reuters How about getting into the Hillary Clinton email issues instead of wasting time on a LOSER.
@CNN What a waste of time, I'm glad I'm retired in another part of the world where people are real and down to earth. Calls the cast to support a asshole who filed a false police report and claim WHITE MAGA people attacked him. next time it will be for real.
@thelastpinkcar @latimes Feb 7, 2017 ... Basic Definition: A grant is the transfer of anything of value from the Federal  Government to a non-federal entity to carry out a public purpose . But a sanctuary state; how has the GRANT money been used or will be. Ca. always has their hands out.
@KazmerDiedre @CBSNews I know that but the flow of liquid is a sign of things to come.I live in Thailand and see Tsunami scars,years on the oceans as as a sailor. To see 100 ft waves crashing over an aircraft carrier is amazing.I enjoyed kisses near Mt. Edna, flash floods in Saudi destroying in seconds
@CNN Illegals well for one thing the factory should have been closed.The days of turning a blind eye is over.The Illegals tell others waiting to come (30,000) headed this way come on up I get you a job),its OK if on a proper work Visa etc. but using all the services under the table NO
@business Old school politics still work. Did not Churchill and Roselle meet in secret with Stalin?
@latimes The Feds money and the money would not used for its purpose should be withdrawn.
@RealJamesWoods They, all of the non-white colors came out and cheered on with the rally call: Another person of color attacked" So, as reality and truth revealed that a calculated stunt to attack people who are WHITE regards of religion/cultural background should be accountable, right!!!!!!!!!!
@AD_WHITMAN @RebeccaFaussett He's an actor he believes what he sees in the mirror of himself. But, one of my favorite songs is Michael Jackson's song ; Man in the Mirror, which questions the face in the mirror and face truth within yourself.
@KateTay33649324 Thanks Kate, for all service personnel we never called in sick on a Monday. A few Navy shots would help ha-ha!
@RT_com Good luck getting spare parts.
@NevadaJack2 @RebeccaFaussett He thinks so? I bet his wife wasn't happy!
@CBSNews Breath taking is an understatement, the largest and most dangerous underground Volcano in America and you thinks it cool? A few months ago Hawaii lava flow. How about an in-depth report about what to expect when that Lovely view explodes.
@TheMaverick_M Giant leap for all Mankind again!
@Reuters People forget China is program to think 100yrs. ahead. So, use all of other countries resources to fuel their growth and in the END they will be the only ones with resources left and ONLY for CHINESE PEOPLE. Every company wants profit but now is the time to put China in its place
@thehill So, the re-enactment at Gettyburg's is now not allowed. So, erase all of America history and replace it with tearing down statues, allowing 1/2 million illegal immigrants into the country, think socialism , and become a Muslim, OK. Time to move on to another country with Freedom
@EMouthy @OliverMcGee @JAMESHGRACEY2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Yes!
@PDChina I notice not one person JUMPED in to save the girl. Panda's are not GRISLY bears for attacks. America do we fear these individuals if we go to war on the stupid man made illegal islands. Think not! Sheep!
@NavaiBaku Many people have no Idea where your country is but, I married a woman from Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek. I hope since my last visit in 1992 that things are improving and not under Putin?
@CGTNOfficial These are important issues for the world not some asshole making false police  reports or going green as a Democrat or even the wall. This is a world issue.
@Caliicoder3 @TheMaverick_M @KamalaHarris He knows her true character. And if the family thinks you are a ????????????? What should America think?????
@Reuters That's why we have stowage tanks.
@seanhannity Let's see convinced millions of people and donors to send money and after 2 attempts will try again???? You would think as a donor/voter you might want to bet on a Donkey THAT MIGHT WIN THE RACE?
@JackPosobiec Why is her stupid problem now a moral problem with US citizens, Go to Saudi, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Indonesia, Malaysia but not the USA.
@TimRunsHisMouth @JackPosobiec @NBAonTNT You see, Barkley and the gang know he is an embarrassment to Blacks. And did with a sense of humor for people of all colors.
@JackPosobiec I'm all for freedom of religion but,to try and transform AMERICA into a foreign culture and believe we as citizens will bow down to this will not happen.I think its time to remind all those who been welcomed to America to start assimilating as such or go back where you came from
@Claude44937605 @patobrien236 Don't know what happen to Minnesota, maybe to busy to actually taken the time to know her as the real person not the words  and lies that came out of her mouth. Question; large Somalia population were they all LEGAL TO VOTE??? VISA CHECK TIME.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER You mean 2 young people in a relationship or marriage who never wanted or learn from their parents to share the required choirs in a home. Someone has to clean the toilet and wash dishes, cloths, cook but I forget today's' adults never learn because their Mommy did it for them.
@CNBC Damage control. trying making a proper shoe not with child labor and a glue gun in a locked door factory somewhere.
@ssroenigk @SCShout When I said under the age of 40 I meant people who's lives are on a phone in their face, mindless conversation about Sitcoms on TV like Friends/ Seinfeld, South Park etc... I think the women are getting it but many others are still little kids playing adult.
@TheGatwickView @CNN They enjoy words like: In my opinion, maybe, perhaps, might be possible, if, not sure, I think, big one for them. Or, could be, what, I heard from someone in the WH, rumors. The toy they have excuse me,  is where GOD's sun doesn't shine.
@CNN Sen. Kamala Harris said that she is disappointed by Smollett allegedly filing a false police report. ALLEGEDLY, go smoke more pot what do you need than what the police have discovered. NO BALLS TO SAY A FELLOW BLACK PERSON IS A ASSHOLE!. Quiet when your girl Trump a MF.
@business Putin like Hitler pumps the people up to believe they should be the master race So a war eliminates overpopulation, opens factories, gives people something to do in Russia.Seen plenty of foreign cars, TV's, washing machines, telephones, computer. from other countries not Russia??
@CNNPolitics This is going to be great entertainment in 2020 from the Democrats, better than the Superbowl which was boring.
@polishprincessh @JoanneSzafrani1 I guess Bengashi wasn't important either to her.
@AnnaBD20 @JoanneSzafrani1 He's lucky he didn't start a Rodney King incident.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt And knowing who can afford a sexual harassment suit.
@ssroenigk @SCShout I prefer Bob Dylan; Pissing in the wind when talking with Liberals and Democrats and most people under the age of 40. If you don't face the right way it will spill all over you.
@DoingRight1 @JoanneSzafrani1 @POTUS Thanks to the interviewers, Opinions are like Assholes everyone has one. Her reading comprehension available at her new desk could enlighten her but Stupid is what Stupid is.Minnesota should be ashamed for what they put in congress.A mindless person who watches to much South Park
@ulovett4 @Breaking911 Thanks for the well wishes. With my 30 years of military injuries even over the counter anti-inflammation meds has trashed my kidneys. So, either way legal drugs are just poison in the wrong hands, As for smoking, I wish, still not legal here in Thailand
@JohnAnd83677058 @PattyMurray I lived in Wash. but the states has a high degree of crime in the Eastern part of the state and Murray acts like an ostrich and bashes the president to at least try something to stop these crimes. The barrier/wall will stand a long time and hopefully slow and stop some of these.
@NBCNews Yul Brenner did the same decades ago. he made a video which should be shown and I think a video showing a cancer lung being removed might help also.
@BrandyA46874591 @billyraybryant DHHS is the free ticket for illegals and lazy people.
@daisylueboo1 TV and movies combined with social media input amplifies the sexual urges of young and stupid people. hey, sex is great I get 5 times a week but responsible. USE A CONDOM, birth control and still enjoy sex without having an abortion after and killing YOUR CHILD LIKE A MURDERER
@politico Don't care a US citizen or not. She supported ISIS and made the choice, we don't need her or her child of evil to bleed the welfare system with the liberals from the left or some Damn Church group. We need to tax churches these days because they are full of Hot Air and don't pay
@PattyMurray Mexico is paying the price now that thousands are on their borders and sleeping in the streets of their country which lacked immigration control and costing them a lot of money. As for you, you like the idea its picking season in a Yakima, Kennewick etc. And need cheap labor.
@daisylueboo1 People don't understand we as a Western culture CAN NOT OWN LAND OR A BUSINESS 100% in China, Asia, Russia or the Middle East. But, they can purchase and own a property or start a business by themselves. It's called FREEDOM. Wish the others would follow.
@RealSaavedra @SheForest Time for a new Book sponsored by Democrats. Funny more books this from fired staff of Mr. Trumps and how many from the Democrats, I lost count only so many fingers and toes!
@BreitbartNews Rep. Maxine Waters  said Thursday that she couldn’t yet “make sense” of Empire actor Jussie Smollett , no problem she hasn't make sense in Decades, that is why we need TERM LIMITS on politicians like her.
@maziehirono @PPGNHI Why is it I only hear about a woman's health and reproductive rights and NOTHING about a man's needs let's say Prostate, Cancers Spinal Injuries etc. caused in the work place or being sterile and need help, colon cancers Nope only women who can't keep their legs close and say NO!
@ulovett4 @Breaking911 Right now with a left ankle fusion with 5 screws loose, the Right ankle bone on bone. The 3 rods and 12 clips in my spine, the torn right rotor cup of my right shoulder, I wish I had meds not to abuse here in Thailand. its the people who abuse the drugs and those who disperse it.
@JacobAWohl @ImDeplorable16 Someday the need for the barrier like the Berlin wall will come down. But, for now until all of our Southern border neighbors develop into a productive society for themselves than the barrier/wall is needed. Find and build their own dreams in their own land so, vast and rich.
@cindygermain3 @Strohj17 @JimCook10454070 @TheJuanWilliams @POTUS @FoxNews He wasn't a bad SURGEON  just overloaded in the VA system. Five screws later in my left ankle an 1 sticking out 5mm=1/4 inch which caused the fracture weak point over time. Also, no chance for the VA doctors to get updated technology training in the VA system. Invest in the VA
@ulovett4 @Breaking911 The big picture of those who struggle for a better life. Well, there are millions of Americans who have fallen prey to drugs and crimes caused by abusing drugs and alcohol too.But,can our system not help our self's first before 1/2 million more from the south come seeking help?
@TIME Green book excellent reflection of the times and yet shows that not all people had racist attitudes.I lived in those times as a kid in South Phila.We were separated but never crossed the line of killing or burning down a neighborhood.People of all colors did not disrespect Flag
@ulovett4 @Breaking911 That $ 6,800 worth of dope once cut several times would effect how many kids on the streets?And how many crimes committed with that little bit of drugs you suggest So,saving 1 life or stop destroying a neighborhood is not worth a 5.B dollar wall.And the big drugs that make it in?
@Strohj17 @JimCook10454070 @TheJuanWilliams @POTUS @FoxNews I wish I could agree, been 17 months for the VA appeal and the new RAPID program threatens 3-8 years if I don't select RAPID. 2 spinal surgeries failed ankle fusion from Seattle VA hospital. I was number 6 in the room that day with only 1 surgeon and assistants doing the drilling
@CNNPolitics As the Democratic party implodes Nancy seeks others to follow her toward the downward spinal of false ideas and hopes of the leadership of the party. The focus they have is on Mr. Trump and not the American people or the international community that the Republicans are supporting
@MSNBC Before people get killed by orders of this dictator he should take his Russia gold and flee before his fate is determined by the people.
@Independent And what do you call a person who assist and cares for the ISIS and now her many husbands or lovers are dead or ran away and left her where she choose to be for years. We should welcome her to America. You like her you keep her.
@Reuters That's what you get from China coach!
@politico Doubt she has ever read any of the Constitution.

@alangomez @USATODAY @CBP How many of these children are really with the real parent. Do a DNA simple blood test!
@NBCNews Can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
@Telegraph And after a few hundred folds, time to buy another one because you got suckered into the cool net of it. Consumers are easy targets for stupid things. Hey, I still have some pet rocks that need a home? Cabbage Patch children go with the pet!!!!!
@USATODAY Blame the greedy landlords not force a city budget because you can't afford an apartment.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Mr. Trump, it's not only the Clinton's but an investigation into the New Democratic group and those going for the WH should be investigated like President Trump has been and still.
@BloombergAsia Try scheduling correctly and don't overload a airport.
@RealJamesWoods Funny, she talks about the US and yet no word on how her little island country owes $75billion dollars. I thought as a tourist island they would do well. Stupid me, like her socialism  and corruption are the norm there, sorry, I'm so stupid as a Republican and taxpayer.
@brithume I'm glad I'm old so I won't have to deal with this crap to many more years.
@WhiteHouse Sad we have to divert resources to such a program rather than just scientific as China and Russian look to a military use of space. Bring back NASA projects to US before it is to late. Don't understand they think they bomb the American spirit in submission World Wars are outdated
Omar apologizes to Jewish groups over tweet condemned as anti-Semitic: reports https://t.co/x7MgWoO5u4 How do you say KISS MY ASS in her native language. Liar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@megxnhxrris 2 children affected by this. How about the hundreds of children affected with lost of either their father or mother in the combat zones they fought to rid the world of IS. No her ass belongs right where she is including the children who when grown up with be polluted by the same
@WSJ Hey Cortez where are you when we need you? Oh! no cars,I forgot. Don't remember Yellow Cab asking the government to protect them or a state control taxi service, yea another of Democrats policy in play for the future.Break out the horse and buggy or a bicycle with Dem's in charge

@mitchellvii @AnnCoulter Quiet, the repairs and changes in the security barrier areas have been going on for a long time and will continue because as you said the money is already there.
@Joelpatrick1776 Thanks for the positive message and it had nothing to with the color of your skin. You know your Black and be proud. I'm white and proud. But, most of all I'm an American just as you displayed even when others didn't agree with you. Its not about color its about America&amp;potential
@Independent The sign of things to come with today's young people doing what they want without thinking of the consequences. Does he own the aircraft, NO. Did he pay for the fuel or the new engine NO. And if a malfunction would of happen his response would be. I'm the DICK HEAD!
@dbongino To stupid to make coffee at home a use a Thermos????
@Cernovich Tax sugar drinks. How about stopping the flow of drugs and Illegals crossing the border instead of worrying about my waist line.
@AP @KimTongHyung This event is the changing event to the next phase in the world of peace. China and Russia threatening countries with Nuke's and man-made military island. If we keep NK of this mix and live like their neighbor to the South it will be because the US has a strong foreign policy.
@JackPosobiec .@Politico reports :"A wide-ranging disinformation campaign aimed at Democratic 2020 candidates.Oh!! calling the president a MF on live TV? Maxine encouraging harassment to others, blackface, socialistic leaning.Islam in the WH for IS supporters. We haven't got to you yet Hillary

@seanhannity Nut Job!
@marklevinshow @SheForest Choices for people of all race, color and faiths. Have you been doing OK in America and its foundations or want a New left extreme influence from outside cultures, money and political ideological thoughts to take what you have?
@RealJamesWoods @jonhsanders2 To old to go skiing and doubt they actually read other sources of information other than CNN. But, their protest is near the tavern to keep them going. As for the plow guy,like in Thailand; The brakes failed it was icy outside?
@maziehirono @hawaiifoodbank @MauiFoodBank State workers which are city budgets or federal workers. Stop painting a picture like everyone in Hawaii have no income or food. You have the 3rd largest federal payroll, how about cutting and trimming the fat to save mainland taxpayers $$$$$
@SenGillibrand @PaulQuinnTigers We the socialist forget the me as a person. let the socialist leaders direct me like a Zombie but it makes them the Democrats feel good. But, it's OK they have a car and I have 2 feet to get around. But, where have all the cattle gone? I love government housing with no water.
@LoufromCT @davidwebbshow @KerryPicket @JGilliam_SEAL Where in their Star Bucks mind they got the idea is has to do with Black Lives matter. All lives matter of all colors. So,all history of people killed in the line of duty does not count. What's next the World Trade Monument the Vet wall in D.C. By removing a object changes minds?
@business As a person with an aviation background and time around Boeing.I choose Boeing, the spare part supply chain worldwide is better.Under the Gold Maint.program more Tech's are available worldwide quickly for dispatched and the aircraft are serviced more easily worldwide at airports

@BreitbartNews Bullshit, I bet the inventory sold out and more orders received.
@RealJamesWoods @jonhsanders2 Winter face masks, they don't look like skiers to me.
@Condor_Law @AlanDersh @USATODAY Why and have tax dollars spent in the courts, child care , media attention like CNN supporting her cause as an ex terrorist supporter. Go to Iraq, stay in Syria but she lost the right to return and if so 10 years in-prison at Gitmo with the rest the IS friends.
US says Alabama woman who joined Islamic State isn't citizen https://t.co/EXt2A4Ki4H Come back ex ISIS bride with child because she has now where to go. Come back and live on welfare after supporting IS,NO AND DOUBLE NO.She made a choice now live with it. congress is like her
@seanhannity Hey for all of the Democrats out there Mexico caught 25 good job. So, Nancy 20,000-30,000 coming North how many friendly M-13 are coming in the Non Threat Southern Border, right Nancy!
@LindseyGrahamSC Great for the Federal workers day off but Kalama somebody still needs to pick-up the trash, police work, FD's, shops, McD's. Sensible solution extend the days 3. Hours change open more. Our population is in the 350m range, keep up with peoples needs in this busy world.
@thehill Has not the WH just pushed and signed with legislation with adjusting time served an the many who will be early releases. So, Sanders what in the heck is he speaking about. Quoting Time? And the Juvenile laws change. Hey, no more sharing O2 tanks with Ginsberg.
@ARmastrangelo Stay in Syria and open a Starbucks. Not welcomed as a traitor. Stay in the Middle East where your curiosity got the best of you. Everyone pays the price of success and bad choices now handle it in your new homeland.
@SheriffClarke @JussieSmollett @KamalaHarris Does Norman Bates come to mind?
@SaraCarterDC You know if all those running as Dem's would pool all the money that will be wasted and put them in debt running. So, choose just one of the bunch and give it a shot against Mr.Trump. and the millions given to programs and try looking like the good guys but Nay! that won't happen
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If they are from a European country with proof of some sort of attachment to a country than yes the EU citizens should be held and dealt with the country of connection for criminal activities. Hotel US No Vacancy
@seanhannity Is there a legal on line betting for the Democrats to see you makes it to the nomination.  I've done black jack but the odds on this would help my retirement money. Better than the horses or dogs right? Like Buster and Ali odds wow!
@PattyMurray @BobbyScott Perhaps the Democrats need to focus on one or the other existing children which could sensibly been address by the Adults who consented to sex which cause a need	or the future children lost in a place like a Democratic NYC? Either way education for pete's sake use a condom save $
Hurd says 1,000 Texas farmers could have land seized for Trump's wall https://t.co/BzzUyPVIV8 News, vultures saying siege property more like easement for utility purposes  These people bitch but in the 1800's power, telegraph. phone OK. So security in 2019 not important also.
@CNBC Rain, shine, 3 meters of snow? Great for a small country. But, what fuel is used to produce this mass electric grid? Fossil or Nuke, Windmills? Power must come from somewhere. Reminds me of slot cars as a kid but off the track you lose.
@thehill I was a instructor in the Navy, educated,also in the civilian world as an instructor/teacher. I guess the Senator never took a public speaking class to learn about body language and hands in the pocket, She's thinking its damn cold and I want to go now, quit why your not in debt.
@RealJamesWoods They have Cortez for the opening act .Can't wait to see what a $10 million  socialist Micheal Moore movie looks like since I've view all of histories stories. See should view a few episodes of death camps and the Berlin Wall, again like she even knows where Berlin is. Not in NYC
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog If employees of contractors like cleaners, cafeteria workers other services did work during shutdown with the WH knowledge than yes,back financial only for services used daily not a full contract issue. Federal workers are in a different boat. But, did they get unemployment funds
@business Mr. Jacobs does not own the river view therefore the view he has enjoyed has been the property view of the state which can and will use it as necessary.
@business Mr. Jacobs I envy the view, to bad the people Killed and Drug overdoses never lived long enough to see that view. Suggest you build the deck higher. The golf course of course will still be on the ground. Life changes and an easement is always a federal utility law usage. sorry.
@WSJ Amazon go someplace where people want to work not complain your a giant entity but a employer of thousands who need money to pay bills and actually drive and not ride a train or every used Uber to get t work. Middle America with rail systems and better weather for productivity.
@kimguilfoyle Well,he's right his party the Democrats leaning toward a socialist system with the new and old congresswomen preaching attacks on others, taxing, free things, support Sharia law freedom lessons learnt from Europe's failure of immigration.Their big boys &amp; girls but play babies now
@CBSNews A lot to do with the items they purchase that are consumable eating out or delivery a lot. Items that sit on a shelf.Constant need to be active in a social setting or media use all which cost $$,Budget a little better won't crimp one's complete lifestyle just be smarter about it.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Wish he did the McDonald's.
@USATODAY @usatodayopinion Republicans have a sense of humor watching Socialist Democrat's trying to sell America down the tubes causes great humor where it counts and it is not in NYC or Calif.and SNL is not a source of reliable programming unless your a jack-ass and rude, abrupt, pushy and live in a box.
@USATODAY @usatodayopinion Why is just a reflection of the media's face.If it were not Trump you will and would do the same. Making money of faults is your driving force.Our presidents will change with time but the NEW generation of Media is embedded with DNA as a negative reporter for$$ jump the gun and $
@JackPosobiec Berlin wall? Her lack of knowledge of world history and of WWI &amp; WWII is stunning. Berlin, she couldn't find Mitch's office or her buddy Nancy's without a road map. Like she has ever been overseas in a foreign culture maybe as a barmaid blowing GAS out here ASS. Dem's hire dumb.
@JackPosobiec I don't recall that the barrier on our border will have land mines, machine gun nest and dogs in place with the congress budget. But, a proper processing control point yes. And as people know immigrants can apply for asylum at an American Embassy or consulate in their country!
@business @bopinion Did he provide a cleric when he killed?
@CNBC First time I've seen Mitch crack a smile when speaking about Democrats.
@RealJamesWoods I think he did the Anthrax line, to have such a screwed-up brain.
@Aikens_Josh @donna_jacobsen Maybe when 3,000 non invited guest arrive and need a place to crash , call ahead next time and we;ll put a chocolate on their turned down bed, OK, NJ.
@JackPosobiec Send it to NY they seem to like that sort of symbol.
@AmyStart3 @Farm_Machinery_ @realDonaldTrump Sorry, my Grandfather and Grandmother were farmers as was my mother and my 6 aunts. As for in the Carnival business born in the fifties and continued for 20 years working in the rain, economic downturns etc.Worked overseas, work visa's and visitor visa'a have rules for overstay
@tenaciousT0286 @peachy_witchy Waste yes also on those who use the system and I'm not talking the big projects it's those little free programs for lazy people.
@DJesus__ @RT_com I to was in business with only 12 workers. But Amazon your talking 20,000/ Heck in Minneapolis like 5,000. If your earning that level of revenue you need to speak to his accounts.
@Jenn198523 @squattchie Like to check their visa status if current or expired and where they get their money from and how?
@Jenn198523 @squattchie Watched the video people in their own words, like the US but want the US to be more like home with Sharia Law which the new congresswoman supports. Last time I checked we haven't had a  Pirate ATTACK at a shipping port like Somalia does to shipping for ransom
@AmyStart3 @Farm_Machinery_ @realDonaldTrump Temp work permits does not mean bring 10 relatives under the age 5 with you. I guess you never worked outside the country. You get a work permit. Contract ends you go home or immigration takes you home understand. Check visa requirements of other countries to see work rules visa
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt I guess he is clueless about a equipment operator on a state or federal job may earn 30-60 per hour and the road flagger gets the same. And unless he knows a better way to build roads,bridges, high risers with a computer the old fashion jobs will be around and tech jobs outsource
@RT_com Perhaps no tax but; Employees salary, social matching employees,Labor and Industry tax. property tax, water-bill, power bill, city services taxes, waste etc.. And then the spendable income employees, shops, food, gas, rent, utilities driven by employment of Amazon. Look pass nose
@thehill Put your face on that and make money huh!, not seen any important big projects from him in the US even though he was president for 8 years. Strange how he gives back. And NO I don't want a sign book or free pass to his library, sorry.

All others beware. Wide enough to cruise the top with a vehicle and mobile devices to roam on a track which can be on the wall
@realDonaldTrump @peachy_witchy Apple, Lockheed Martin,Walmart, 25 will shape Trump administration to  develop job training programs. Technical training, weld, plumb, forklift/crane/truck/ concrete all at a VOC/TECH invest, train for infrastructure we hope soon next on the list. Talk construction company needs.
@DonaldJTrumpJr  executives of Apple,Lockheed Martin, Walmart, 25 will shape Trump administration efforts to  develop job training programs. But Voc/Tech school investment for those workers when hopefully infrastructure is on the list. Welders, forklift/truck drivers, masons etc.
@thehill She's watching what she is saying but don't worry her true colors will come out.
@mitchellvii Just goes to show she's getting no Love in congress from either side. Just a turkey sandwich for lunch which is more than she deserves.

@TheOfficerTatum @donna_jacobsen @IlhanMN Resign, like a security clearance question. YOU lied and been caught doing illegal activities therefore ineligible for the position simple business rules of contact behavior. And lying breaking the law the first time with immigration. Amazon is hiring in St. Paul, bye.
@thehill Perez, got it right on health care for the 49,000 beds, faculties, medical attention and  food, hot water, Landry, cable TV of course in Spanish and lastly all of the American individuals diverted to provide this service for those Southern border visitors not US citizens.
@TheEconomist Yes but tend to more aggressive torn between old lessons and new cultural differences in the West.
@washingtonpost Nothing new we have them , China has them. Prepare with a very big flyswatter or a strong mosquito net. I thing inspired but  the classic movie  The Birds, Alfred Hitchcock.
@Lexa_Merica @donna_jacobsen @Alyssa_Milano I say that with today's bio-technology a finger scan even palm sensor on a personal firearm be in place to avoid a child or a nasty visitor from using the weapon only the owner can fire the weapon.
@guardiannews If you can measure the gas in the atmosphere is it not able to extracted from the gas in our air and recycle it for other uses. I saw in China Hugh air filters looking like art.
@Reuters Does this person not have a work load and job to do in her taxpayer provided office? or should we allow her to continue to be on the streets, TV, talk show without seeing legislation activities from her.? She's on committees I thought, not Berkley 1968. Waste of taxpayers money.
@daisylueboo1 @RebeccaFaussett If you can compare how many elected her in her district and see how many more to push the petition over the top would be great.
@cs00582scs @RebeccaFaussett To many reruns watching Romancing the Stone. I quest their Little Mule wasn't quite so powerful, Try a Hummer next time.
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Jumping the gun of information from the pillars of power trying  to make a point. YOU and Dem's are splinting the country in half with this hair brain Socialist concept. Check your bank account and hopefully soon your retirement package, don't cry poor and free giveaways.
@NBCNews All you hear is an ass like Baldwin and want-a-be funny guys sit their butt up North and watch mass media and form a stupid idea. No working knowledge of government, finances sucks in marriages and these people we hire as Jester tell me what is real, please.
@DeepStateExpose Can we book a appointment for Cortez, Pelosi and a few other women in congress. Is Maxine busy and a few Muslim ladies should be treated to this treatment. After all Dem's were in P.R. during the holidays with 109 lobbyist. The girls deserve taxpayers treat, Limo thrown in!
@thehill Sen. Cory Booker campaigns in New Hampshire: "I think that there's a serious violation of separation of powers. Don't know the rest of you never open your mouth with ; I think. If, Perhaps, Maybe etc. If you DO NOT have HARD FACTS shut up. This guy who leaked Doc's preaching????
@TheEconomist That's because they are still living at home,school paid for by parents or bullshit grants. Can't put down a cell phone or turn off mass media (FaceBook), etc. Talk only the old farts OWE them.Well, I'm a old fart and I'll be damn to keep  giving my money away for useless growth.
@Independent I don't know if your wonder wizard writers know what a car jacking is but poor SCOUT will be so slow a 8 year old can mug it,worst what if medications, good for the patient bad for the thief? Armor trucks get robbed, don't think walking (slow), Scottie will?Gated community world

As dollar stores move into cities, residents see a steep downside https://t.co/cGQVumjEyU Complain about 30,000 $$ stores and yet the folks who shop there afford those cheaper products.But yet Dem's want another 30,000 immigrants would love that shop in VENEZUELA. and SA.
@BillKristol Showing a 5 year old news show, Trump wasn't even running for president than. Your outdated?
@washingtonpost People are and went into Mr. Trump's love life,other politicians present and from the past, what makes her so special? Who is she and what skills does he have and why so many people on the payroll does she not do any of her own work or just TV?How $$ monthly IS THIS SHOW costing?
@RealSaavedra She needs to read a American document; " We the People", we know that this is not South America and Russia, China, Syria or Iran.The government is here to work for us not having Uncle Sam in and control your life. Dem's want balance,then stay in school, work hard, stay of trouble
@ShellyCov @Lexa_Merica But,on flip side how many times has a single women or friends gone to a club and got treated the same way How were the beans of the story found out? Did he confess and couldn't take all the attention. Hey, girls as least some of you knows to feed a man not just beers and complain
@ShellyCov @Lexa_Merica He may of gotten carried away with attention which probability started with server asking Like; Is your date coming, and there it began. Over decades I always traveled and worked on the road and seen single people women and men. I have pay the check for Mom/Pop Day,strangers etc
@ShellyCov @Lexa_Merica Democrats attacked Mr. Trump and family/relatives for positions in the WH yet in less than weeks a BOYFREIND?? has a account which a good hacker based on that usage can get in.Time to get her out, I demand the FBI check deeply. Screwed with Trump 2 years, now in house for newbies
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @Lexa_Merica Women holding signs show me/give me a job who are here on a immigration program with most having minimum skills the Governor enjoys having low paying jobs for them and still have being subsidized also. If anyone knows about the cost of living in Minneapolis you understand, techie
@Tweets4MAGA @EricBonillo We spent Billions to train servicemen &amp; women,equipment  tank1billion, Aircraft, ships support training for professionals Firefighters, Police, CBP,Nurses,Doctors for what,so a person breaking the Law can not be accountable.1 life means nothing to Democrats what if were your baby
@TishMoscow @Lexa_Merica @AOC No sure which opening gives off my methane gas but either way it just a reflection of her true character. Composed, right, educated right if anyone believes this person you need to read and learn things and just not listen to this Bimbo! She may of fooled NY but not real America!
@BlissTabitha @garyvickers123 OK but let them live in VT. if they are going to trash the American way of life. Many Muslims are very good normal people as are those here from different cultures who in Freedom of faith while not hurting Americas basic openness of all races, colors. But, do NOT step on my FLAG
@RealSaavedra A job, benefits, security and maybe stock options isn't good enough for Cortez who must be a good investor with all the tip money she saved or tucked with campaign funds which must be some extra. She hires outside consultants where does that money come from taxpayers I hope not!
@charliekirk11 Well if we use the 49,000 beds that congress just signed for part of the 61k than we down to 12k or so instead of funding for immigrants, FDNY, EMT and medical clinics etc on immigrants then we have progress to free more funds for the city services and make a dent in the problem?
@Reuters Tell that to the 25,000 lost of jobs and economic benefits. I understand the housing issue than fix and control the landlords. 3 years no tax Amazon ? but construction jobs, food service, shops, markets etc.. more than 25k lost a whole x 7 workers for every 1 at work Amazon.
@Dantej21 @mglessman If you don't how to drive in snow ,ice stay home. Speed  the first mistakes, no chains or studded tires I bet. new compact chains can be safely driven at a moderate speed 40+ The trucks that hi ,the companies some are at fault and should pay damages. The others to if speed posted
@Trump454545 @SheForest She is a politician for Democrats her mouth opens words that go circles to nowhere of real intelligence, values for AMERICA, a plan for this country and what she is suppose to do in government. She wishes to protest go back to the streets, write a book anything but in congress.
@GirlTrumpp @mglessman Lies and history will get you in the end.
@RealSaavedra She hasn't visited the border, has an understanding of the current US homeless shelters of overcrowding. Analyze the 49,000 beds just signed and the impact of services being redirected to the influx of immigrants and no long term solution just open the doors/wallets of the US
@nytopinion @nytimes So, 20-30,000 more people headed North caught on video and being monitor on their journey and when they hit the US border, barrier or no barrier, what would you do NYT if we just split the group 50% NY, 50% Ca. and only on your city budget provide shelters, food, medical etc...
@politico Not a problem, the cities in CALIF and their defiance for safety of the old country should have all their federal dollars blocked until an audit of exactly where the money comes from and goes. Auditing ALL BANKS, PAWN SHOPS, CHECK CASHING SHOPS,FOOD STAMP PROGRAMS, HOUSING ETC..
@CNBC No compassion, If Mr. Fox believes that Mexico can say we are not human beings after millions elected him for stemming problems form Mexico and FOX you did nothing by allowing thousands through borders  to prey on the AMERICA taxpayers and enjoy the jobs at the border
@Lorilove10983  Hello back to you also, David, I'm in Thailand 12 hours ahead of you if your on the East coast. Always home so, have a good day/night.
@sabine_durden @JackPosobiec @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Amazing but I bet it went in one ear and out the other. Sad, until a bad situation happens in someones life it has no meaning. And the Democrats safe behind secure gated communities and WH security live in a Bubble. I hope Sabine they hear the voices of Love ones taken.
@Condor_Law @SpeakerPelosi @OfficeGovEthics Not a Monster but an OLD OSTRICH  who time has pass that effects millions of lives she is clueless about. That is why I support term limits on Congressional  officials. I hope others will get that on a ballot for 2020.
@buyko_nb @Farm_Machinery_ You must be a Fiend and Bartender in NYC. Your Friend Cortez?
@business Other people in other countries put 4-7% of income for savings. You spend $7 a day on coffee times 30 days -$210 per month times 12 is=$2520 per year. And If you save $2520 per year X 25 years=$63,000 not counting interest. So, coffee or savings?
@mitchellvii Nah! we read and hope your mother is a little better. But, be ready when time will take her as all of will do, I'm 63 and disabled Vet and don't fear the future, I remembered how I lived!

@RealSaavedra I thought she said she was married in Somalia?
@RandPaul Ok, but who is a better choice a new Democrat socialist, anti-American? Nothing is written in stone but like you toss the stone upon the waters and see ,you just don't know how far it will take you in your future. Risk is always a gamble. Bet on Republican like you of the Future.

@MattWalshBlog Road ways to repair are free, bridges? Better listen to Mr. Eisenhower 2 hour exit speech. Glad I'm not young or misinformed as you, To much MTV or Facebook for you dude!
@DonaldJTrumpJr No people who erroneous made deductions to screw the system were flagged. But Mr. Donald Trump J.r. make sure people at the high level of big money are view the same way, This is not a Dallas TV show.

@washingtonpost How about and be responsible for your own heath and stop eating crap, drinking all the wrong things,smoking cig's, no exercise and when you get a cold or fever when FREE HEALTH care you cry like a Baby. Grow up, people. The government is not your nurse maid.
@USATODAY Some of the teenagers in the background were Mocking only because of the beat of the drum.I've been to the LONG house of Native Americans. But, the young man looking eye to eye did not present disrespect. he was absorbed  in the moment and did not say or do anything wrong.
@Tasha77789 @janeomara @USATODAY Male Lions or species in the wild do not bond. There is always a leader of a herd, etc.. nice picture but the Mane, shows they are no brothers. Alpha males in the animal kingdom is the norm that's all. A Lioness yes, 2 males in a pack, Photoshop!
@Condor_Law @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @ILMFOrg But,he is still a Republican that questions inside the party with intelligent debate. not like the Democrats who represent nor discuss anything for the people.Their focus is only Mr. Trump who doesn't take their Bullshit seriously as myself and many true AMERICANS know. he is OK.
China Says Space Is Not U.S. ‘Private Property’ https://t.co/uZ6ulcLyAt if they military installations like the islands they have done. This is a act OF WAR, FIRST STRIKE. and for what purpose to build my restaurants in America, stupid. 21st century police actions yes, WWIII, ?
@HuffPost Law makers , you did not ask the PUBLIC CNN!
@CNNPolitics Oh! WOW she didn't do anything as Secretary of State, her cheating husband didn't put forward HER IDEAS AND NOW NOW AT RETIREMENT AGE AND MANY BOOKS AND A LIBRARY AND MULTIPLICITY PROPERTIES SHE HAS A VOICE.
@Condor_Law @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @ILMFOrg Paul is solid! An a True American. He challenges for the right reason but seeks the truth not like Democrats like wolf's in sheep hiding in the Flock that people like CORTEZ  has corralled, has does a little bartender convince so many old school politicians in Dem's?? scary.
@RealJamesWoods @fogcitydog Jolson dubbed "the king of blackface"The World's Greatest Entertainer".His performing style brash , extroverted, black publications sometimes been credited for fighting against black discrimination on Broadway as early as 1911. In an essay written in the 21st century. Sorry Jimmy
@SaintDenechek Because you need the history and cultures not to do with culture BUT WORK ETHICS that built things like the empire state building during the depression. The street vendors hustling food making a honest day living.Every watch CINDERELLA MAN, LEARN, enjoy the popcorn,I'm for you.
@standfortruth10 @SaintDenechek @POTUS And so sad during the closure of the government YOUNG  the new DEMOCRATS destroyed public property for what reason, it's a sign of the xxxix????? Facebook  culture/green reflections of values. Native Americans should not be angry with a kid with a grin but WITH DEMOCRATS
@SaintDenechek "Doormat". No one is a DOORMAT, don't care where you come from as you never understand my life from the slums or a carnival/circus child of the subculture 50's,60.70.80.90. and seen things in travels of change. Old saying: Until you walk a mile in anothers shoes|!
@SenSanders @Cernovich You are so out of touch Bernie who every is blowing smoke up your ass! Eat more veggies, no cows, no cars for pollution Tofo free for everyone, wow! How about like Mr. Glen we send you to MARS to prove your points as the oldest out of touch person on the planet.
@Reuters I think more like GITMO if he is a good swimmer. Been there https://t.co/hFhnAOHaI7. No way to tunnel and speak with the CARTEL. What's wrong with this Idea I like to hear. Hell, he would even have a view of the water and make new friends of terrorist Ideas, like RICE?
@charliekirk11 Well, if GM, PHILLIPS politicians did not remove the electric train system in the 1950's oh! I forgot the tire makers ( Firestone). Check your history. Do Calif. every go to school and I'm from Phila . education where we still have TROLLEYS!
@janeomara @USATODAY Dumb-ass, check the color of the Mane. Nice picture but you, clueless.
@CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon Kiss my ass to excuse all the things I have done good and bad in 63 years. Move on American you are so boring . grow up like the rest of the world!
@BBCNews Well, we'll see if he is as powerful as Al was in Prison.
@washingtonpost Ego's or status in intercity with a pet/companion like when you leave your children in a daycare is a sign of enjoying the company of a creature thousands of years old is a fault to be displayed. Mr. Trump has shown that of ego of a pet needs care not a TROPHY for lazy owners
@HuffPost stick in my face and I'll stick in where GOD gave you a split.
@HuffPost Stick that in my face and be ready, asshole press. Your lucky you only got bruised. But, you were just seeking a story. Go Away UK. Fix your story on Brexit
@ewong @nytimes Are we placing military equipment and NUKES in the Virgin Islands, P.I, Saint Thomas, islands on the coast of Singapore. Wake-up world these OLD  school regimes of centuries of totalitarian rule have not progress. China Dragon not WELCOMED IN THE EAST!
@politico States senator from California in 2016, becoming the first Indian-American . What her and Warren who are you? Black, Indian, Chines, Asia what bullshit card you want to play to be a big shot which your not. Go home and smoke more dope. I smoke dope but I had 2 spinal surgeries .

@RealJamesWoods I guess he leads the way in saving on head gel testing on rabbits. But, all that Aluminum  for razor blades and the cost to produce the product and energy, perhaps learning how to harness meth. gases would be novel  Sorry, you must haven't attended science classes. Cory
@Condor_Law  Do you have a older sister who wants to marry a Old dude. If and when I return back to the USA, dinner and your family is on me. Thank you!
@RealJamesWoods Poetic justice definition is - an outcome in which vice is punished and virtue  rewarded usually in a manner peculiarly or ironically appropriate.		I believe the Democrat's are the latter. Sorry, dude sytax a little rusty like me.
@RT_com Japan invaded countries like China in 1930's and Bombed the US. Korean with Chinese Communism in the 50's. And millions of Americans, Australian, British, Canadians , French and many more. Go Fuck yourself with Russia and China.
@guardiannews Nobody asked the reporter to stick a Microphone in his face. Hey! UK worry about Brexit we kicked your asses out 200 years ago. Stay out of politics  and we stay stay out of your COLONIST PERIOD OF SALVES, INDIA AND EVERYPLACE ELSE YOU EXPLOITED, to many to mention.

@pamelaclearwood Not directed at you. My Point when was the last time everyone and wondered and  looked into the night sky and saw the Brilliance awaiting all of us. The Light Above is waiting if we look inside and above, that'a all. Sorry, If my words were confusing.
@pamelaclearwood I don't have the answers but I learnt from my time in the slums of South Phila as a boy getting my ass kicked walking 12 city blocks to school at 4 1/2 and being 20 years a carnival/Circus kid for 20 years I believe I have some insight.	Strength comes to you.
@GovKemp @thecjpearson Equal opportunity was written into LAW before she was born. Funny, like SNL  no new material or reruns and the same old scripts of days gone by. The media is as boring as watching GOLF.
@thecjpearson @katieeeoneillll COFFEE is coffee without the $4 foam!
@dougstafford @thecjpearson Their just pissed off because some of the Bullshit write-offs don't exist anymore which other taxpayers had to fill the GAP.	Sucks to be HONEST!
@thecjpearson Why were not in El Paso? See CJ, stop being a ARMCHAIR POLITICIAN LIKE THE DEMOCRATS AND GO OUT THERE AND GET DOWN AND DIRTY. I support you. Don't think because your young and a person to different opinions stop you, that will always be there. look at the Dumb Dumb of Democrats
@thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @RealCandaceO Backwards, Mr. Trump will be honored to meet you. You should be in Congress not the party girls with socialist and racist ideals. In fact you should join him with his meeting with NK. I support this idea because then as a person of proper youth and morals will return with a truth
@thecjpearson Sorry, CJ not capitalism but the evolution of humanity without  paying a price of days gone by. only people with hate wish to remember the horrid of the past not to see the future of balance . Want to help, feed people in the war zones, now.  Ross Perot did. History of all colors
@thecjpearson Old saying; You can take the Redneck of the Woods but you can not take the Woods out of the Redneck; But, DON'T PUT EVERY RED NECK IN THE SAME WOODS. The South is more polite and courteous than any other states I'm traveled and they have grow more than the N.E. in decades.
@pamelaclearwood Sorry, Pamela, GOD left the light on for everyone. it does not matter what name you use but since the Egyptians, Mayans, Incas, they worship something bigger than themselves. Even my time working in the M.E. they acknowledge Jesus as a prophet Hindu's have a GOD.

@LucyLovesTrump @Lexa_Merica I guess in 2019 I better get Neutered to be safe in a women s HATEFUL WORLD. it's OK most women can't even operate a Micro-Wave to feed a family or themselves. Neutral Training interesting. Anyone remember the song 2525 won't need no husband or wife?
@LaylaAlisha11 @Lexa_Merica @IWasHrren The only Green these students know is when Mom and Pop send money and get stoned in the local campus bar. I smoke Green but always paid my way in Universities and training. Nothing to prove with all that crap to hang on the refrigerator means nothing. it was what you do each day
@thecjpearson @SebGorka Watch the video by Mr Mcgraw; Humble and Kind. Your age has nothing to do with the spirit to understand and accept the differences of the world's cultures But, make choices NOT FOR YOURSELF but those you believe one day you will do good by. Today's Dem's wish to destroy progress

@tejalrao @nytimes Classic's in LA, you haven't traveled the 30+ countries and 37 states since my youth plus living in Canada and being in Mexico in the 1970''s young people with opinions crack me me up!
@business TV is giving way to much time who time has past, boring!
@CNNPolitics Is WHITE not a color. Don't you think I had to compete with education to be employed a 2.6 0r a 4.0 score. Watch the GREEN BOOK and see it was not always easy for anyone of the people to make decisions of fairness!
@LucyLovesTrump @Lexa_Merica The more I see of Women coming out with a voice the more Vulgar they are. Girls, men have always been men since we killed and BBQ the first dinosaur to put food in the cave. Mistakes, we made perhaps. But. our aggressive behavior got our asses shot off for liberty for you.
@KAG4All @SheForest Nobody told you to drag your children /or other people children across Illegally. I think we will sue you for breaking the Law AND COSTING AMERICAN TAXPAYERS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR YOUR ILLEGAL ENTRY!
@ColumbiaBugle @SheForest So, 6 years old you could make that decision? What do you think about your father Fucking a woman in the OVAL office as president? Didn't teach that in University did they. BlueBloods Bullshit to the END!
@SheForest Thanks for the acknowledgement, I'm not proud of my screw-ups but, I was pressed hard to work hard and I play hard no regrets. But, when and if you screw-up in life be strong enough to accept the results. I did. immigrants must face the same music!!!
@TheMaverick_M Yes,a DUI is a criminal offense and impacts ones life. I had them spent my time in jail, years of probation monitoring, restrictions on driving, employment denials because of it. police watching me. So,Illegals are not criminals with DUI's only Americans. I paid the price they to
@WSJ Mexico a bad name are you kidding. The country alone murdered 30,000 themselves.	And they say America is dangerous?
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @tomforemancnn If you mean socialist thinking, racist thinking and empty words your right, that's why they are Democrats.
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Higher standard than white men? Look at what they have been doing to Mr.Trump for 2 years. She is the one who slept her way to the top and smoked pot along the way. She and few other women of color in congress are a disgrace to the nation and what America stands for.
Trump calls on Omar to resign over remarks condemned as anti-Semitic https://t.co/9mnCRO1R4J Her apology is empty and what she was stupid enough to said is a reflection of her true character. She does not belong in American government.
@RealErinCruz 49,000 beds for illegal immigrants and Oakland evicts homeless Americans????????????
@Carolly13248534 @Anthony33985587 @NYCDogs4Trump To the voters! And to America. They talk of Black face, knelling, etc. And she is a congresswoman.
@joe_the_butcher @Anthony33985587 @jetrotter We only ever see her big smiling face not the rest of her un her dress in white like a KKK member. Check the teeth can't fake them.
@kevinhaddad08 @Anthony33985587 @bitterlily22 Who needs Norm of Cheers we have Cortez the fire dragon lady of NY.
@LanceBrutcaster @Anthony33985587 Tax dollars at work to get voter registration of illegals in the Bronx's
@QTAnon1 @peachy_witchy Notice she's wearing white just like at the SOTU address. I thought only virgins wore white or KKK socialist. One way to get voters to look closer into her qualifications. Didn't see that during her campaign or wouldn't want to. Has the same smirk in the photo as she does now
@javeedstwit @mkraju @KilloughCNN Chewing gum and talking is real class, like her followers are.
@PZelazoski @mkraju @byrdinator @KilloughCNN Junior, to much credit, more like H.S. dropout ghetto style.
@mkraju @KilloughCNN Any one tell her its rude to talk with your mouth full, chewing gum and trying to think and talk at the same time is the only way to keep her views silent against America. Must be a custom in her country.
@RNCastaldo The best on twitter today, thank you and Bob Hope which most people under 35 have no idea of him and what he did for the servicemen and women for decades as a loyal American who came from UK.
@CBSNews He was a piece of crap doing what he did while men and women on duty defending the country in fox holes, ships, deserts and DMZ he should of been locked up.
@TheMaverick_M Sue the Dutch they were the slave traders who brought slaves from around the world. And sue on behalf of slaves who die in Rome for entertainment. Today's society are not held accountable for what took place hundreds of years ago. Tell that to the Union soldiers who died for them
@PattyMurray @lisamurkowski Where's your big donors, Gates, Boeing? Oh! Microsoft in India and Boeing building in S.C. and China. Your just now focusing on this issue, great awareness of what goes on in your office. Some of the most expensive real estate in the country and taxes and this is an issue?
@RealErinCruz @IlhanMN Good point Ms. Cruz. To betray the Koran and yet support us infidels goes against ever aspect of the Koran. We as non-Muslims Americans should not trust her access to government and I'm sure there are Muslims around the world that  will not trust her.
Ocasio-Cortez retracts erroneous information about ‘Green New Deal’ backed by 2020 Democratic candidates https://t.co/4UG9XTlfn8 Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff,does she not do her own work or just TV shows and radio talking through her smirky smile.
Democratic leaders not looking to punish Ilhan Omar after her apology for anti-Semitic remarks https://t.co/SIpmSMvLmn You want to impeach the president for his words and policies and yet you let slide a congresswoman who apologized but she still thinks the same. Left leaning!!
@RealJamesWoods No disrespect to him. I know the feeling. But, a reflection of what people have come to expect. He held his head high with the situation, just as he did to the events that lead to that moment. Even with that indignant moment he showed what a real American is.
@globaltimesnews Like to see the same under live fire!
@thehill Off the backs of taxpayers born here like me!
@TheEconomist Because US Democrats don't want you to eat beef.
@latimes In another reversal of course from the Brown administration, Newsom is  establishing the Office of the First Partner, his wife Jennifer Siebel  Newsom’s preferred title, with seven new positions and a $791,000  budget. Nepotism, sound familiar in local government.Who is she?
@HuffPost A is for Apple? B is for raise? Glad I actually when to a real school in the 60'-70's with teachers with better grammar and art work.
@CNN Better check the Kings coke habit overseas and I'm not talking about soda pop.
@Independent Her EGO is bigger than her brain and other parts of her body. 1 movie and she thinks???????????????????????????????????
@washingtonpost Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. No mercy for the people they hurt why should I feel sorry for them, 3 meals a day, bed, plus more. That's more than the victims they hurt.
@MSNBC Make sure we take the federal dollars with us as we leave California.
@CNN average 50k per year with bennies and want to strike.
@guardian Maybe, but he always does a role as a professional well.
@business Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending  machines to be under stocked, and to have to wait in line to use the  men’s bathrooms. Your Mom doesn't work here. Kill the 40oz coffee in the morning and learn to eat before work.
@indy100 @Independent Not if your straight!
@Independent Mental health in Hollywood, that's a good one. I'm sure people in the other 49 states excluding NY get the joke!
@omniaomnibus @Farm_Machinery_ @PeterEgan6 Slaughter house news is new?Enjoy your steak, chicken Nuggets or fresh fish? Guess to young to read about Chicago of the late 1800's and how it fed troops and fat cats in steak houses.wool for fancy cloths you buy at Wal-Mart these days. Feed a person with why they were put here
@thehill @CoryBooker But, promises to longer leak confidential documents as president or don't get caught. legal representation Hillary Clinton and husband.
@Reuters The 1920's are over!
@Independent Is she a legal citizen? They ran Obama past why not hers and any family connection to terrorist groups?
@CNN Check all the useless things she purchased and shop at the Dollar Store, not Macy's like the rest of us.
@thehill Teach them in the streets like me they should be out there with a shovel to make a few bucks to eat or help someone. it's called work ethnics not just words.
@guardian Easy to do with 1 billion citizens.
@Anna_Soubry @RealErinCruz I don't know the UK issues but she looks so exhausted!
@CNN I lived in Puget Sound and we get a weird snow storm every 10 years. And at Snoqualmie Pass 15 METERS each winter, who are you reporting the snowiest in 70 years. Without snow at the pass no drinking water in Seattle. Mt. Baker, Mt Rainer. You must be a tourist?
@Meljanx @LA_OC_Native @latimes Bullseyes!
@LA_OC_Native @latimes National Guard reservist called to duty and before on active duty I only take orders from the Commander-In Chief not some elected official such as a governor. Maybe in California or liberal states, that never worked for me. I took orders from commanders not politicians.
@RealErinCruz It's not a movie but what is real in the 21st century still in certain countries. Can you own a weapon in China or legally in Russia or Iran, think not!
@LoufromCT @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi She needs a paid vacation to a death camp in Germany where you can still smell the death of burnt flesh. And remind her that there was over 6 million. And if you want to know 40 million in Russia by Stalin. Feel safe at Amazon in MN, does she?
@Independent You hang in the wrong place with the wrong people, please he was just a guy making money.
@nypost Mom and Dad taught them well, now society will intervene to analyze what went wrong. More violent videos, social media, magazines, TV violence and the word  F^*k in every movie rated PG13, right! Not allow to have curfews in the inter-city, access to guns and drugs?
@mitchellvii Or the Magnetic shift of the planet or the Volcanoes under the Arctic ( you make tea in a kettle with fire below and result hot water), explain to me how mother natures system is different? Carbon food plants, plant more green and I don't mean tea.
@guardiannews HallMark strikes again, soon to be a thing of the past like an Arcade.
@NBCNews Instead of a Boycott, an input about the colors I understand but the functional use of this item is a good idea. So, they were fixed on the color which Black absorbs Sun heat rays better than White. Find another issue to Bitch about, what's next Boxer shorts with hearts?
@MSNBC This guys fat face is everywhere trying to paid off debt. Move to Atlantic City and play slots, he's old news. Can't find a new story NBC or CNN.
@latimes Last time I check only the commander-in chief has authority over military not a small governor who gets BILLIONS of dollars in support for a state with massive problems which cost the other 49 states millions for Calif. policies. We have Bollywood, don't need Hollywood any more.
@HuffPost All those tax dollars collected for hundreds of years and no Limo driver? Sell a Castle!
@CNBC Not bad Puerto Rico owes that much and they have no oil? Hey, Cortez is that not a concern on the budget committee you are on but wait Green movement and kill cows, what's next Lamb Chops, no fish, no air, clothes, books,music and for you lip stick from Rabbits?
@SenGillibrand We need people who are willing to fight: For health care as a universal  right. For every child to have a chance to get a good public school  education but, not in NYC that Democrats supported. Less children citizens of the US, less schools except for foreigners.
@CBS @MichelleObama Grammies is about the entertainment business why is she there, promoting a book?
@CNBC I worked at Boeing and this concept was 30 years ago, remember the SST Air France. Young news people and generation XXXX think everything is new only because you don't know crap about crap these days unless on Facebook or CNN. So, sad to be misinformed in life. Read a book
@Patriot988 These undereducation loud mouth people forgot they earn the right to be stupid without being imprisoned or killed under the freedom of millions who died for this right TO BE CALLED AN AMERICAN Don't turn your distorted values into me ,I must live in the toilet of your past. Wrong
@Patriot988 Maybe I should move to their country of origin and stir the pot of raciest and murder an corruption, poverty, dictatorship which last time I checked and used my credit cards, went to a store with food in it with no Military guards or hijacked food trucks in the USA and free press
@MSNBC @SRuhle @AliVelshi Never hear the stats of how many crimes committed and people in prison who are illegals from all countries in our system because of our immigration/visa policy.
@JudicialWatch This is why there should be term limits.
@HuffPost Running for president and talks about Blackface college issues of 30 years ago, separates people of color and I thought white is a color and never at 63 have put a blackface on so, he thinks all white people of color do this. but, he leaks documents before president huh!
@politico So, she's busy spending her $14 million dollars of personal wealth talking about Trump but not on issues she stands for. I know about Mr. Trump, who in the heck are you Warren and what do you stand for?
@SenGillibrand So, no big support but take the public of their hard earn dollars. It takes millions to run a race for the WH. I like to check her QuickBook records. How can she said that in the real world of CNN.
@PattyMurray Your show in Washington State isn't much better with a drug problem, making Eastern WA. pay for Seattle's problems and budget. Illegals in gang violence. have you ever traveled outside of Seattle or Olympia your safe haven like Evergreen University! Oh! don't forget logging jobs.
@CBS @DUALIPA @st_vincent Nice display, stop sexual overtones but on Grammy night OK?????????????? if men need to keep their manhood locked up what about women's display, sounds like the story of the Apple and Snake. it's OK for them to show skin but don't touch or speak to them. No more Bikinis!
@RealSaavedra Another socialist thinking, stand in line for days to see a doctor and all will be well. try visiting a busy VA hospital and you'll see how a budget control system by the government works. I bet she never used a socialist medical system. let's see when and where she has medical .
@Condor_Law @GovMikeHuckabee @BrianKolfage @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @TSA @VP @SecretService I know what it feels like to be in a wheelchair and get screened the same way. people watching you, bitching at you your holding up the line, move faster, comments take a bus, stay home etc.. it takes strength to endure as this Vet did also, We been through worst at check points
@GovMikeHuckabee @BrianKolfage @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump I'm a disabled vet also not as severe as him but he was professional as he was in service to respect the job of the TSA personnel we give responsibility to keep all people safe.I say this because someone could use him without knowing to do something bad. But, screen all the same
@BBCNews We should learn from them but, in NY they kill future citizens to allow illegal immigrants and their children to come into a system and culture that they can't contribute for 20 years until you get a Democrat like Cortez and others. That support death and free stuff.
@NeensCa @Lexa_Merica You put these brave soldiers in harms way and the mission to stop more death and when an animal who kills in the name ideological bullshit is removed you try and destroy all he and others whose lives are on the ground not sitting your ass with a beer watching CNN views.
@peachy_witchy @Lexa_Merica I'm a man he's not the cutest but a honest man who knows right from wrong and believes in American values which it stands Key words for which millions who have die and STOOD for it principles not knelling bowing down to pressure rather they hold their head up proud to be American
@BorderNarcotics @dixie_normas I think the next presidential debates should be in the octagon. Fair fight Trump and 12 democrats all wearing green and eaten vegan before the match. let's see who wins meat eaters or liberals on a Tofu diet? I'll bet on McDonald's!
@nytimes She is not Native America and yet she beats that drum of over 200 years of history only to stir hate the black Democrats talk of slavery, why is it the phase people of color? I'm white is that that not a color that counts or is voting time and CNN TV ratings time. Stop media hate
@RT_com Hey, Democrats you know that South Americans heading North don't bring crime right. Just children not their own to get in the USA with their stories of crime that they are part of. Crime only happens if the Sheep in the Neighborhood allows it. We fought for freedom, why not them?
@TIME Then what in the hell were they put here, for picture taking and why have teeth a straw will work right. Liberals go to Mars and eat Kelp!
@CNNPolitics She should learn history and about death camps ran by a outside force of evil.But, in her own country they kill each other try to debate that on capital hill no matter how much money the world gives her country they act like animals and she condemns Israel policies. Loser!
SF fire station says they are being asked to get rid of their cat, Edna. But they want her to stay. https://t.co/2icYMknYVq What cold blooded person complained,men and women who serve the public have a symbol of peace after having a day that most people can't imagine.
@CNNPolitics Blackface by humans should not remove all parts of history to remember the struggles of ALL people of the time who believes forged our NATION of all colors.
@HuffPost If your the real person getting food stamp assistance for now until your life improves, yes. Anyone who knows the abuse of the SNAP program costing us tax money, drug related occurrences then you live on the Moon! PEOPLE give their SNAP card in exchange for drugs and alcohol.
@WSJ Amazon, big mistake haven't you learn your lesson in MN, with the issue of pray calls, special food, rest spaces! Profitability and who pays a guy like me in TEXAS.	And now in a Socialist work culture in NYC, thanks to CORTEZ. I'll buy ALIBABA with no bullshit.
@OLDFLACO @Lexa_Merica @galacticaactual @GordonTrema @Jana__Howser @JanetTxBlessed @RodHillis1 @andrea77214732 @KamyMAGA @Layla0406 @Branko_MA @DLindsey2 @scarletteskyMT @JjRedWave1 @rdrhwke @teli707 @MonicaBettsGOP @T_FLgal @krunalley Something most people don't understand the price they pay also. But, the courage they display is something all people should try to achieve when the world is not fair.
@RT_com Yes,of course but as a youth not an adult who knows better! HISTORY will bite you in the ass, just ask my divorce lawyer when my crazy RUSSIAN wife showed the court a DUI charge 20 years before I was stupid enough to marry her.WOMEN, learn quick and lawyers are their best friends
@RealSaavedra MUSLIM band, where is she employed now! BUT, not for long I hope!
@RealJamesWoods THANK, her for losing 25,000 jobs plus all support in the local community because no one wants to do business in a Socialist environment.
@VeteranStrong3 The new military. I Remember when I finished my time after 9 years because of injuries my friends, seniors telling me about how juniors had TIME OUT CARDS when you gave them a ass chewing for being lazy. NOW Facebook to disobey a direct order they don't like WOW!
@BreitbartNews So impressed with her input!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, right!
@JudicialWatch ABOUT time!
@PattyMurray Copy NY, it seems to fit your views and I'm sure not all Washingtonians. ALSO, try teaching people about birth control like a condom which would avoid an abortion issue to start with.
@PattyMurray Why would you as in your State in EASTERN WA. like Yakima the illegals are needed during farming season. And don't say know I'M EX-NAVY, business owner in WA. FOR OVER 20 YEARS and spent a DUI TIME in the city jail with 60 people in the cell block and 40 were on federal hold.
@CNN Bad Santa part three!
She what happens when you can't spank your kids anymore or ground them. Don't even try to take that cell phone of of their death grip these days. No gender training , right. Wrong from Right teaching not allow to be taught or enforced. But, build more jails for the brats.
@rollcall Surprise, Democrats will actually come to work on a weekend but no on Holidays when Americans were working.
@John_KissMyBot @EMouthy She can't comprehend the millions of lives lost in 2 WWII to protect from Regimes, Communism, Socialism and Marxism. And our current men and women serving around the world to protect Democracy that she trying to tear down here and take my beef burger.
@BreitbartNews Make sure you without the tax amount of the $10 million before you put the check in her hand and she flees the country to life of leisure in a socialist country, Cuba, South America.
@DanCovfefe1 @gex_daniel How come no Bobble heads for sale yet, so I can count how many attack me outside of NYC boroughs thank God for NRA and #2 Amendment.
@benshapiro @billyraybryant People like me know how to have fun without having CNN as entertainment. Go for a walk, swimming, skiing, ride a bicycle, see a movie, have a BBQ, have a street block party, have game night with friends, hang with your kids and no phones. I guess she needs instructions at camps.
@dbongino What an idiot she is. Thinks she knows everything about our great country and knows even least about foreign cultures or politics. If she thinks foreign leaders take here serious with her break dancing moves well " Stupid is what Stupid does".
@Time4U2Know @gex_daniel He was right, we don't need 2 more years of dragging this out against Republicans, If he can't speak in five  minutes the Chairman should Refuse himself!
I'm new here, how can I send this comment and picture to Democrats? Thanks. https://t.co/NYqa1SYCRv
@Smart3Stacy @AOC One more point how would Cortez address the issues of Dinosaurs burping Methane? But with over 6 billion people burping after spicy food and a good pepperoni pizza with jalapenos are we next?
@Smart3Stacy @TheMaverick_M @AOC Oh! Thanks, I forgot my cold glass of milk and my corn flakes wouldn't be the same with water. And my Cheddar and pepper jack with my yogurt all gone. Thanks, Cortez for depriving me. She's from NYC so no more Tzatziki sauce on Gyros or meat what's a person to do?
@jennnixon @Farm_Machinery_ Mr. Carter was a Navy Nuclear Submarine Commander who owned a family peanut farm. His background lead him to government than the WH. he is still active in helping this country with his bare hands building homes for others. Where is Bill, Hilary, Obama and wife? Oh! writing books.
@BBCWorld Yes!
@business So, Cortez wants to rebuild all new buildings. Wood or steel Cortez? Something has to come out of the ground to build them and don't forget railroads ties of wood. Can a tree farm produce all this wood and what country do we start to cut from. Hey, Washington state looks good!
@CBPArizona @EMouthy @CBP Yea, that road barrier wire fence Obama supported really works huh! 325 was a practice run wait until the 29,000 use the same path, then what Democrats?
@FMart80 @thehill NPR host Steve Inskeep asked Ocasio-Cortez Thursday morning about  concerns from conservatives that the 29-year-old former bartender's  proposal
@FMart80 @thehill Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who announced a sweeping "Green New Deal" on Thursday that promises to render air travel obsolete, get rid of gaseous cows
@thehill Where in NYC, LA, etc... or the bar Cortez worked out of. You learn a lot when riding a subway and never left the state. No more steak houses, McDonald's, Taco Bell or Gyros shop in the future, will French Fries still be OK? Who needs diets we have Democrats telling us how to eat
Ocasio-Cortez contradicts herself on role of government in massive and unprecedented 'Green New Deal' https://t.co/HQ8AifHeXy 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls including Sens.Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Elizabeth Warren,D-Mass. Cory Booker,D-N.J. co-sponsored the resolution. haha
'Combat shopping': Mayhem at Seattle stores as shoppers clear shelves pre-snow storm https://t.co/yLpGJAYBDO Good time for a government shutdown. People in Seattle can't handle snow well, the ones on the East of the Cascades can handle it.
There are more moms in Congress than ever before https://t.co/qnVho3n4B9 Single mothers? Some with a axe to grind with men. Sorry, if some of them could not manage a family and marriage how am I to believe and trust their judgement for ALL people which includes men?answer please.
@CNBC At least she has a better perspective and something to say unlike Hillary did, who went on to books, her husband, Obama etc...
@thehill @HillTVLive How many Billions will that cost the US taxpayer? Your on an island how polluted have you let it get?
@BreitbartNews Let's start with that $10 million Nexflex  movie money from the new ambitious Democrats, Cortez lead the charge!
@TheMaverick_M Is that before or after the 54% wage taxes?
@JudicialWatch Why because he's black or what is the reason?
@CNN That saves a few tax dollars and food for the homeless.
@Condor_Law @realDonaldTrump @POTUS In August 2018, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico reported the Commonwealth had $74 billion in bond debt and $49 billion in unfunded pension liabilities as of May 2017. it seems soliclism works their on the mainlands backs. Cortez can you read?
@Sekusa1 @peachy_witchy @AOC Why not? If your going to build a train system over the Ocean wouldn't you want to know about weather. It is as easy as the Elevated trains and tunnels in NYC right, piece of cake for her.
@JudicialWatch It only took 2 years not counting the years of abuse while in the WH circle of Democrats. Funny, they circle the wagons for her and fellow Dem's but not for the citizens of the USA. Book sales are good she said.
@Condor_Law @AOC Venezuela, sounds like a great place to live if you can get past the road block of food on the bridge. Better yet, when I see it work in NYC, LA, MN, and Puerto Rico I'll move there.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Invest, then no phone money for the airtime on your IPad to talk all day.
@chuckwoolery Do they do drug test in congress, if not they should. Here she is in one the highest drug infested city in the country and that explains what comes out of that socialist thoughts. Why a train to Australia when we need just high speed trains from coast to coast for commerce.
@CNN Where were the rights of the peoples lives he destroyed that put him on death row to start with?
75 things you don't need to buy https://t.co/FxNXx4qCln Sad you find what other people can afford and like suggest by you as a waste. My 30+ traveled countries cheaply when you live like a local and my other vices make me happy big ass TV to boot.I don't pay parking fees like NY.
Tax expert tells Congress there is 'a lot to find' in Trump's tax returns https://t.co/ITTJAlTwPW I expect all of those millionaires on the Democrats side for the WH submit their tax/business holdings up to the light also. And dig into the 30 year past of their lives to be fair.
@JackPosobiec And how do women do their fair share of recycling their Pee!
@BreitbartNews The design is functional but a poor choice in color. Try user friendly colors, with the arctic weather I can see it working well.
@AP I'm a retired disabled Vet living here in Thailand for several years and the selection of the Princess is a good choice. I've seen her work for the people here and she is highly respected as she has followed in her fathers footsteps to continue his work here and she is smart.
@SaraCarterDC @AOC Has Cortez looked in the mirror after how many TV shows she has appeared on and I haven't seen ANY  proposals from her or Dem's. And she trashes the SOTU address which I felt offered choices to the Dem's unlike Pelosi grinning and shuffling papers behind Mr.Trumps back.
@Smokers1Wipes @TheMaverick_M Yes!
@BreitbartNews ARE YOU KIDDING?
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Is that not A  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN!
@Reuters You know nothing about how the systems works FMS aka; Foreign Military Sales which means, like me who worked 9 years in the Middle East under the DOD  private contractors , ex military maintain and train the foreign forces. Your so stupid Reuters.
@dbongino So she came to America to get people involved  with other peoples affairs here?
Four House Dems Refuse to Attend Trump’s SOTU https://t.co/kPuibgcu1p No matter they were not there during the holidays to discuss issues with Mr. Trump. I guess they  have to return to Puerto Rico for r&amp;r time or collect money.
@HuffPost Big deal, it's for them a actor paid to provide entertainment only.
@MSNBC Not on my ship or duty section in combat.
@PattyMurray Your all about the money for parks which Mother natural built and you suck millions of dollars in revenue and that is your big concern. Liberals, show me he money to spent someplace else like the Alaskan Way which eastern WA, foots the bill. Try a toll road concept .
@USATODAY What a stupid gesture wearing white, but never heard a real plan from the people in White, but have the Black congresswomen filed a gregarious objection?
@SenGillibrand @staceyabrams @AGBecerra Diverse, full of heart for WHO  criminals, looking forward which for decades to avoid issues of  the past? 30,000 more headed North that is not a problem? What Planet do you live on.
@Uncle_Jimbo @IlhanMN How in the hell did this person who wants to bring her culture to US soil because the crap coming out of her mouth can not be said in her country. Be American and stop teaching us to be you.
@USATODAY If you need a drug that cost 350K your in big trouble anyways. But, for those families shatter by illegal immigrants of a cost millions is NOT worth your time right Sanders.
@PattyMurray Murray, fix your drug problems, illegal immigrants which Washington has the most. You do know where WALLA WALLA prison is right, go visit before you open your mouth again.
@BreitbartNews Why? She and other Democrats keep singing the same old song, America not first lets be a socialist country.
@Condor_Law @IlhanMN It will bite her in the ass in the future. And why has MN allow this to happen in the first place.
@MSNBC Sorry, I keep saying a finger print ID on the grip or trigger would avoid this situation of a child or a bad person able to fire a weapon. So simple of a idea it's stupid.
@USATODAY I learn that shit in 5th grade cry babies put the Facebook phone down and read a dam book.
@HuffPost He has gotten to this point in life why? Black/White or just an American? he raises the issues of color not the thousands of fans who just came to watch a football game, which sucked anyways.
@HuffPost So, he sees color not the president! Cool one less face to feed.
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Next time you or someone you know gets a home invasion or your tax dollars go for foreigners instead of American citizens on the streets let the general population have a heads up in safety of your gated community So,1 or many lives as an American citizen has no value in your eye
@JournoJoshua @detroitnews Do what you have to do.I live in Thailand and this country enforces their immigration laws, why can't America. I'm a retired disabled Vet who can not afford to live in the US on my pension sadly.But,I must check in every 90 days and once a year proof of income for the visa.
Magnetic north just changed. Here's what that means. https://t.co/vLrBXCSwWq Volcano activity increase lately, Ocean temp. changes,weather pattern changes all part of the natural order of the planet, man made don't think so! mother nature evolution of life and death. Oh! well.
@JudicialWatch If I were a tech geek, I could read in the reflection of her eyeglasses in this photo who and what was said. Anyone have those skills.
@politico Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, the highest share of the vote won by a candidate outside of the two major parties since 1912. Check facts, it is possible. remember the Whip party, Tea Party?
@Independent Nearly, what part of America are you speaking with? it's like Horseshoes and Hand-grenades which is closer to the truth or target to mark a score that counts. Dem's water Polo does not count keep swimming.
@BreitbartNews No a problem he was probably in Puerto Rico anyway and has not recovered from not being present during the shutdown to discuss the issues while Mr, Trump was there. One less sleepyhead in the chamber on the Democrats side, whats next headphones allowed in the chamber.
@IRG9876 @patobrien236 However,in Cabinda, wedged between two French-speaking countries the DRC and the Congo many people speak French as well as, or better than, Portuguese. Also, the Angolan Bakongo who were exiled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo usually speak better French and have the money
@HuffPost Why, he overstayed his visa simple! Pay the price like other countries
@CNBC I was a teacher in Thailand and Southeast Asia and this asshole has no Idea what the young people distractions are on this public media has done to their motivation. Their believe Facebook will make their future. FU.Mark!
@1RealLori @TroyShilling Hell, write another book and never share your wealth only the working people must do this in their tax bracket, yes! You can afford a snowblower an a few illegal workers on your payroll as before.
@TheEconomist Is it any different we buy from Wal-_Mart with cheap labor or child labor that we allow import goods from coming into the the USA. Don't forget chaining the factory doors or sleeping quarters for those 18 hour shifts to make $27 dollars a day.
@lisamurkowski Why no men leadership discusses?
@politico Lose 100 pounds and actually have an agenda unlike why he has been doing on book tours/TV/interviews so full B.S.
@DeepStateExpose @TroyShilling Does the word Gillette and Marie Anne of France ring a bell? You want sex chose a willing partner not a CHILD! CHOP CHOP!
@IRG9876 @patobrien236 It's been a French problem since colonialist periods and the French still have their fingers in the pie for the resources they take.
@RealJamesWoods @patobrien236 What goes around comes around!
@Reuters This is a HUGE  step in a world where religion dictated political direction. I hope Hamas is watching. The Right side of politics in the Middle East like UAE, Saudi, Dubai see the future for all.
@NPR WOW! even as kid in South Phila. of the sixties there was a 5cent$ return on bottles. What's new now it;s a good trend but not a novel idea. How to think I got my Licorices money!
@SenBlumenthal You mean work until 72-75 before collecting benefits because those dollars invested in my future is spent on your programs like Illegal immigration's, welfare, food stamps for those able to work and subsidized housing, DRUG  problems.FIX THESE ISSUES AND MAYBE MONEY WILL BE THERE
@PattyMurray @Lilly_Ledbetter How many men work in the banking business when you go to the teller window. Do men own hair salons, babysitting services, day care why because women wish to control this sector of opportunistic and more.
@SenGillibrand Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Carolyn Maloney initially co-sponsored the bill, which failed to pass in 2006.[1][2] A different version of the bill passed both chambers in 2010 and was signed by President Barack Obama in the beginning of 2011. under Dem Obama.
@RT_com The Japanese had developed this techno knowledge in WW II, your just keeping up junior want a be reporters. try watching the HISTORY CHANNEL  of the USA.
@BreitbartNews That' FUCK-UP!
@RealJamesWoods Wasn't expecting that from Jim Carey and knowing his family history in Hollywood.
@GovMikeHuckabee @Patriots They better check the touchdown when the guys feet was in in mid-air and hustled to the next play and the RAMS got the first down?????????????????????
@RT_com It was and before an Independent country before UK colonist that you did like most of the world Merkel you don't shit about Ireland, stay in your territory you to MAY.
@dcexaminer @MikeCrapo Want a another BAIL OUT like the OBAMA time, don't think so this time.
@business Not if you had BETS in LV.
@BuckSexton its just another band. Give me SuperTramp.
@JudicialWatch The stupid Democratic system also does not understand that the immune system of these travelers bring in SUPERBUGS which the US health and CDC spends billions of dollars to stop. People are so uninformed.I survived Stahacuuccices Arueraus,, flesh eating disease in ASIA and AFRICA
@WSJ Wouldn't you when the system fails because to busy being political correct chasing Illegals and violent criminals. Eye for an EYE! Liberals who live in gated communities think this way. It's not Revenge but Justice and not a waste of millions of dollars to save a BAD APPLE!
@WSJ So, never we heard or seen a BLACK,Hispanic, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Asia Buddhist  and a Caucasian make humor of each others race for a laugh. Better tell SNL.	Forgot the Russians,Polish, Germans, Italians and the rest of the planet.
@newtgingrich Need to see you step up to plate, you can handle the heat or your to old to be a voice for what is a good direction and there will be mistakes. But, change is something  some people must take in small dosages.
@CNN The THREE STOGIES were entertainment but these people are criminals.
@PattyMurray @FBI Your a Blow heart, Military bases, military ship yards, submarine bases, Boeing federal F-18 projects, tourist you cry poor. STOP THE DRUGS AND Illegals  IN THE STATE. Murray, get you head out of Seattle and see the BIG PROBLEM you have ignored.
@SenGillibrand So, using children like a shield in a war zone to say we separate truth from lies to gain access to our country we the country telling lies as they throw their children over a border protection wall in Arizona or swim in the Reo river.What a Moron whomever left her desk in D.C.
@BreitbartNews He is confused that the Democrat  governor  is a Democrat?
@cs00582scs @ElaineS74713643 Calif. let Mexico have it and WALL IT OFF FROM THE REST OF NORMAL AMERICA!
@CNN And who brought this back, not US citizens how about all the illegals in eastern Washington like Yakima, and  in the farming areas? You think?
@cnni If you can not swim what in the Hell are you doing in the water? Especially, in open waters with Rip tides or cross current directions inlet to a beach area .
@ScottPresler @ElaineS74713643 The Rams got lucky on the quick play when the first down with NO TOES  touching and the ball caught in Mid-Air and they hustled into the next play. They lost because they were not the better team but play well and Goff did well for his first super bowl! The judge, well stupid!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Fair play, welcome  to the real world; This is your Past and we dig into it just like going to court and system brings up your past. What, Democrats must of thought they were immune from scandals!
@PattyMurray I don't think you understand he is the president and your small role as a Senator which has done nothing to promote progress for all people. Checked your voting record you like the sidelines. I lived 25 years in Wa. over taxed, drugs, crime, Illegals  in the East of WA.
@dbongino Don't worry they are 2nd Amendment individuals not a bunch of bar hoppers from NYC, San Francisco or  liberal cities who don't understand the privilege of being an American and defending our principles and way of life outside the concrete jungle with limited thought of FREEDOM.
@business I think the old guy with an outdated Bow Tie who has never left the safety of his home needs to visit the real world of the problems of the border and spent a few nights in Chicago and East LA without escorts or bodyguards, dumb-ass!
@guardiannews WHY?
@Tiredofweirdos Prays are good but support to understand why he chose this direction right now is the important direction. His destiny will be what it is suppose to be for all service men and women who chose that path to support the beliefs of their families and countries.
@pulte Detroit.
@rghollandsworth @Tiredofweirdos I never called in sick on a Monday on a Aircraft carrier with 4 years at sea doing my job! Thank you!
@CGTNOfficial so, funny!
@cnni And we keep sending millions of dollars into their corrupt government?
@BBCPolitics @BBCNews All I hear is her debt which causes stress, welcome to the real world! And wants help? 	There 3 billion other people in line with the same problem.
@politico Only if your a Democrat trying to enjoy uninformed voters!
@Independent So, show a picture of his daughter not the AIDE. CNN and Independent you show  true colors of Bullshit Journalistic skills which is a negative 0.
@newtgingrich @jonhsanders2 You are talking about NY and all the Democrats that support this bill .
@Independent Put your ass on the  field and be tackled by a 230 pound person traveling at 15 mph to knock you down. It was not a exciting game but the warriors did their best for your lazy fat ass desires as you ate pizza in a jersey and never exercised Independent outside of your desk.
@Reuters Freedom of religion in the UAE and no killings like with ISIL, Taliban, Boko Harom etc... But, her in the US they protest against Jews, Catholics, etc... Time to live there maybe!
@guardian Bullshit! You were not qualified!
@JackPosobiec Both reflex personal opinions not just reporting unbiased  information , so, both are just as bad.
@mitchellvii Thank you, as the KINKS said walk like a man, does not make me I must follow in YOUR PERSONAL CHOICE to be transgendered and force me to accept your choices in Life. And that does not give transgender individual more or less privileges in the system.
@RealJamesWoods On July 26, 1943, the first class of African-Americans entered Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes, Ill. Among the first Corpsmen in 1943 was John Andrew ... I wrote a script and researched him like Hacksaw Ridge this is a story to be told. davidflynn@hotmail.com
@RealJamesWoods What is this even a issue for a kid standing in front of another person, personally I more concern of the value meals for seniors at McDonald's has more importance on my budget! And time!
@newtgingrich Mr. Gingrich, Mr. trump was working and present during the holidays and shutdown asking Democrats to come and discuss a fair compromise. I hope as others you support the Republican party and not bent to all the negative voices as the decisions today will impact for 20+ years.
@CNNPolitics Chris Christie now a big mouth TV/Radio loud mouth dog's everyone what a LOSER!
@NBCNews Yes,its the reaction to the mood of the country because the polluted IDEAS of the news filters ideas to control the direction of their left or right leanings which is wrong to convince the general population which is just about ratings and income.Sorry if anyone believe THIS WELL
@RealJamesWoods Silly walls, explain that to the CBP, police officers died in the line of duty or the families who lost someone to illegal immigrants. EL Chappo who smuggler 100 billions of $$$$$ drugs into the US and said we don't need a barrier/wall to contain this problem DEMOCRATS?
@Condor_Law @POTUS @marklevinshow Can't wonder why so many ambulance chasers looking for a story. Journalist or want -to-be kids with no not background trying to write bylines. Not problem stand in the unemployment line like the rest but since no functional skills since youth I suggest McDonalds at $15 per hour.
@tannerstake @RyanAFournier That's even more information that I really don't care about. The Loser Pack are just that. Small minds in a big world.
@BreitbartNews A overstay is a overstay, pay the price. I live in Asia and if caught for a overstay well a plane ticket home is the exit door and banned for years from returning. Laws are made to be enforced no matter who you are.
@RealJamesWoods @EricBonillo But killing Babies in NY is not? What have we become? I agree with the animal bill as I love my dog as a member of my family. But, NY what were thinking?
@DeplrbleRzistr @TheMaverick_M Wish the rest of the Democrats would follow his lead and quit for the good of the country.
@HuffPost Wow! one less fan means one less person standing in line to get a hot dog and beer. Stay home and watch reruns.
@mitchellvii Nothing better to do since none of them have a plan for America only pointing fingers in all directions, writing books and doing TV interviews. each competing with each other for attention. Do the voters realize how much tax dollars have been wasted on them so far.
@dbongino Just watch CNN everyday! Democrats 12 years and counting down.
@USATODAY Which was he? it does not matter, busted!
@RealJamesWoods Stack up on chips and dip for the 2020 run of political entertainment.
@guardian Only if you make it that way in your daily actions.
@HuffPost There are a few new Democrats he should invite to the show rather than just a statement, But, get it right CNN NOT a republican Gov.
@CNNPolitics Can he bring the dead bodies of the victims there also from illegal immigrants who killed them and not make a pity party over someone who choose to make the journey. The victims were not asked what they wanted, why are we fixing her life over the others needs here as a US citizen
@IngrahamAngle @CNN @realDonaldTrump Michael Moore said a 30 year old age limit to run for president would be good and wishes Cortez was older. The field of 2020 Dems ranges from to smart-ass youth to bated old millionaires with several books among them. Leadership or traffic crossing guard!Eye 2020 not today issues
@RealJamesWoods @GovernorVA Now he's sorry,Church and State separate some Dems don't get. Business is business and you screwed-up. So,explain the lack of customers and harassment your employees will endure, lost of hours, even jobs because of your stupidity Life is a two sided coin to keep you in your place
@latimes Bullshit,Check facts CNN clone.Apr 24, 2018 - Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are just a few of the tech giants that rely on the H-1B visa to snatch up coveted tech talent“reached the Congressional-mandated 65,000 H-1B visa cap for fiscal year 2019. Where are our 65k graduates here
@RealJamesWoods @jonhsanders2 About 15% of Starbucks' revenue came from China and Asia Pacific markets $3.2 billion fiscal 2017, Starbucks aims to increase its Japanese stores by about 20% to 1700 by the end of 2021, hey Moore between meals speak louder we didn't hear that Boycott clearly in the real world.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Work hard, play harder!
@MSNBC 30 years old to be president,only because its time to move out of Mom's and Dad's basement and get a job after they spent their savings sending you to university.	Right Michael Moore, Cortez just made you her best body1
@RealSaavedra @jonhsanders2 Bullseye!
@CNNPolitics What do you call FaceBook a wealth of higher knowledge or Snapshot, Whatsup etc,,,	besides what teen could afford to stay at one of hotel/resort businesses. or what teen wants to have a real job these days? Some do correct, but city kids, please.
@marklevinshow @jonhsanders2 Its not just the anti-Jew view but complete disrespect of America how we got here fighting all types of battles from the beginning,for liberties as free speech, religion  and independent spirit to succeed, positive advances in prejudices, her voice she doesn't represent all of us
@NPR If your speaking about light bulbs, broken furniture etc..., please they live in these facilities and they break the stuff all the time. no respect for their own living area. They wish to behave like animals let them live like animals in their own spaces.
@CNN Wow! Mr.Trump brings families of victims to the White House and Peliso brings an illegal worker to the SOTU address?Feel sorry she was finally discovered or perhaps a barrier/wall funneling check point would of flagged her and others earlier.If she made it how many criminals did?
@Condor_Law @SpeakerPelosi @cnnbrk Thank you CC, why Democrats and some Republicans won't face solid evidence just like the crimes they are. When police have confrontations and issues they fix it. SWAT as an example, gang investigators etc.. So, a Barrier/wall choke funneling point would help stop this crime.
Undocumented Workers Lose Their Jobs at Yet Another Trump Property https://t.co/H6up7B5eWI At least the Trump organization is cleaning house, when will other companies do the same so the extend of the problem both parties can try and find a workable solution
@Carolyncorneli8 @Lexa_Merica How would she know the stuggles of segregation in America and wasn't just the South  affected. this person needs a reality check. I like to see Don Lemons on CNN interview her and ask her about segregation.
@RyanAFournier Yes, and with a finger print on the card. You need picture ID to drive, buy booze, even a library card has a picture. Medical cards, work places, Military ID,building entrances etc...if you want to Vote than what is the problem, only criminals or illegal persons would be put off
@washingtonpost @TheRickWilson Christie, 9 TV appearances and a book another sell out of the SWAMP.

@Condor_Law @US_FDA @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @KamalaHarris @ICEgov @DHSgov It's not just about stopping the drugs coming in. But, how do we grow and developed to  all young with questions,no leadership to be a positive influence? Legal Laws every kid wishes to  break. But, I had my bad boy time, but knew how to be a good person also, can't today?Same
@Lexa_Merica @chrisvanderveen I'll never jump ahead  of you in line with you, but SMILE!
@Jim_Jordan What are you in competition with IPads and think a 16 year old today cares or understands political issues. Are deomcrats that despite for votes, whats' next 8 grade sounds a bit to Nazi for me.
@SenGillibrand You complained of the shut down, now pay federal workers and declare a national holiday. You voiced millions lost in small commerce  who must adjust and work on that day. Weekends is a start.
@DFBHarvard @jonhsanders2 Minnesota is to cold for me anyway. What happen to the Norwegian/ Swede culture in Minnesota. Everyone sell out to the Left?
@jnottah @jonhsanders2 I thought she won, good I haven't lost my mind. Rebuttal to Mr.Trumps SOTUA.. Should be interesting since she has no government inside information to back-up her comments. Could be a reflection of the future of the DEM. party?
@Jamierodr10 @jonhsanders2 @realDonaldTrump Mexico should of dealt with in at the Southern border. As long as the caravan stays on that side of the border, sorry its cold outside and we need to attend to our citizens of all race, color and background who are suffering also on the streets of America. Stand in line.
@CNBC Well, if he would of gotten the 5.7 billion it would of ended.

@LindaSo21443550 @jonhsanders2 @RealJamesWoods Good one!
@NBCNews Has not the system proven that a problem of illegals, overstays and other forms of fake ID's to undermine the system and billions of dollars to enforce which could be used for the citizens of the country before we invite strangers into the strapped system we have now, sorry.
@cnni @CNNOpinion She could loose a few pounds trying to tell a culture thousands of years old what to do, good luck with that. I hope she likes rice.
@AmericaFirst150 @jonhsanders2 Come on CNN propaganda only 30 people hitch-hiking North no problem Pelosi. Time to sale food on the highway. Hey! Mexico what are you going to do to help your Northern neighbors before your next check of assistance?
@TuckerTonight @jonhsanders2 @SenSchumer I guess a gated community and security with an alarm system in the homes is not the  same idea of security for what every reason for the rest of America?
A deaf couple accuses Delta gate agent of refusing to help them, threatens to sue https://t.co/Hp30syHqlC I'm sure these women had cell phones. I live in thailand and many times use my text/voice app to communicate. be in a wheelchair like me, they can walk.
@JudicialWatch could of kept a lot of people safe, warm, feed in this cold weather rather diverted for her trip and or programs for non-citizens.
@Condor_Law Won't see that on CNN, good job. sad, real news but facts are facts. I'm not a big fan of DSHS either.
Maduro Sounds Conciliatory but Warns: U.S. Intervention Would Be Worse Than Vietnam https://t.co/Y49Gw1E9wf #1 they don't dig tunnels, they like their phones and modern things. Food would be nice, employment too. They want him out, somebody is cheating the citizens and it is him
@CNBC JP Morgan would say that as Americas oldest banking system and Bank of America which started in S.F. after the earthquake and was the bank of Italy.But Obama bailed, banks, GM, Chrysler, and others on the tax dollars. Only Ford took care of their own debt. And now close Factories
@HuffPost Can't entertain like a Jack Parr, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, don't need the same crap all day long from the news and idiots talking politics at the water cooler. Fire your writers you are ssssssooosooo boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where are the comedians on TV? not a political big mouth.
@INFIDEL_2_0 @TheMaverick_M @GovInslee @BobFergusonAG I'm from Wash. and Yakima has a high crime rate and to many illegals there on federal warrant's . I know spend 6 months in the Yakima jail on a DUI charge as a white man. Gun control there would be a good thing, sorry.
@RealJamesWoods No detention  center for him with heat, food, blanket on the floor and hell a colored TV with Spanish language on it to make everyone happy. Nope! just good all American concrete and no home/shelter because our Democrats like to be bleeding liberals and do America second!
@derek_mafs @jonhsanders2 @AOC Yea, you can take the Girl out of the bar but, you can't take the bar out of the girl; nor her socialist thinking that might work on the streets of the Bronx's but there is a big world outside of the Lincoln Tunnel.
@usatodayvideo @USATODAY people hate this cool weather and snow and ice. But, a resource to be stored for farming, drinking water, fire-fighting, stream/creek/river management before it reaches the oceans. hydro-power. Fill dams, reservoirs. Ice houses fill-up for spring/summer use.

@RealJamesWoods @Nike Funny, their can't afford them to start with. And last time I entered a church I KNELLED. Besides an example of a culture trying to STEP  on my 1st Amendment Rights not trying to assimilate to the Western ways they migrated to start fresh as an American spirit FREE! and safer.
@Independent Trust me more poor which i think you mean someone else paying the bills rich student And as a student you take those outside jobs. And the rich just study yes, but all are getting the same experience no matter poor or rich, PT work as a student if say rich student that's all.
@RepDanCrenshaw Maybe he should try a neighborhood BBQ and see if any of his neighbors come. But, telling them to bring their own food, wine, beer because his shelves are empty. Oh! bring the charcoal also, I still have some gas he said.
@Reuters @CassLGarrison The Western hemisphere and where Argentina is makes it a good launch site for space vehicles of all countries. The Atmospheric environment.
@realDonaldTrump Yes sir, But get the American troops off the ground for the public imagine. But, a large UN Flag &amp; NATO Flag  with our troops there would please the new voters young and old. Besides good training for UN troops and NATO partners. They put us in Europe come to the Middle East
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, the highest share of the vote won by a candidate outside of the two major parties since 1912. Anything is possible in America that is why we are what we are. But, forces are trying to breakdown that spirit, what once was.
@HuffPost A Freshman Congress person should do it not a Governor. The headlines because for the First black woman Mayor, no. Let see how the future of the fresh Democratic  party will go and see the future leadership to be Bipartisanship.
@CNNPolitics Ryan did seem weak to push agendas through of Mr. Trumps. Now, Mitch he's hanging in there.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Good thing NO Smoking around life support equipment sitting next to her.
@HuffPost 535 Members of Congress divided by 50 states and 2 territories equals=10.2 each place. Salaried employees, why not have them MAN POLLING stations. Divide another 10.2 and get 5 more places. Motel 5, OK I'll pay TD, $35 for food that day, OK. They work for us, I thought!
@RyanAFournier As a US citizen but live in Asia, their QUICK national pride done in the morning shows the unity of their country. They disagree on many levels in today's world but the national spirit flows through all of them. The POA if done crosses colors and races to feel US as intended.
@RT_com WORD OF THE YEAR ; CONCLUSION!
@chuckwoolery Chuck, don't get mad and go and read the SS benefits web page. That states you DO NOT HAVE TO BE A US CITIZEN to get benefits. I'm a disabled VET and I read important info and SS is one. You can check but that is how I read it. Try the Chain Link relatives over 65 benefits.
@MSNBC Call her fired or finally discovered to illegally work. Question how much money did she send off US soil illegally. She said  Trump people knew, maybe HR. You think that Mr.Trump knew the daily operations of his companies. Hell, you have a Congresswoman who can't find a office
@Forbes So, you agree that a wall would work Forbes. Which means the FUNNELING process of the same amount of immigrants would not change but now at INCREASE CHECK POINTS/ENTRY and the that same CPB resource would re preposition there right? They would still be all needed.
@Condor_Law @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @SpeakerPelosi There many practicing religions in the US. with different symbolic symbols to say or display them. Remove a symbol or word that built America but also welcomed other faiths is a lost to foundation!
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Happy for the baby and mother receiving attention and being looked for . But, what about the homeless mother and baby in the old car last, no shelter space. Humanity not lost but in the wrong direction.
@NBCNews I think that Election day should be on a weekend as most individuals are off. Voting hours extended and make it a 2 day process so all those who wish to vote can find the time. utilized small arenas/gyms more provide indoor comfort/sitting instead of lines which raise tempers.
Chris Christie Shreds Jared Kushner's Father: 'One Of the Most Loathsome, Disgusting Crimes That I Prosecuted' https://t.co/f8p2yyljGE I guess he went over his Visa limit when running for the WH. Does everyone in DC write books and go on TV, live large die small 15 mins.
@floridaguy267 @dixie_normas NJ wishes to have a wall to keep New Yorker's out!
@MSNBC @AriMelber Yes, breaking records for saying the most words as a socialist Democrat without moving her lips. Runner-up Kalama and a close 3rd is Maxine Waters.
@Condor_Law @KamalaHarris What is with all this socialist movement and talk? She knows see is running for president of the U.S. not Russia or China or Iran. American was built on freedom and the ability to grow not be contained like sheep. I agree health care is pricey, fix that not my choices!

@Independent Hey Daniel, 1st Amendment.
@TIME Yea, if your just asking the Democrats.
@MollyV178 @jonhsanders2 Why boycott football is it because the kneeling thing is no longer a message fans want to see when they go to a SPORTING event not a political event. Spend hundreds of $$$ to be disrupted with politics. We get enough of that all day!	Enjoy the game for what it is, entertainment.
@cnni Always confused, China on the move with all its growth and yet students come here to study. And then when in America, studying in English and at a University like Duke speak Chinese in a professional training environment. GO HOME! Take your money with you. And we lose a professor
@AnnCoulter @eugenedelgaudio Davos elites are smiling, can't make money without selling those bullets MRE's, fuel, tents, and portable toilets. Someone must make money right?Governments have the printing presses for the money but we just take their cash or gold and enjoy our annual bullshit meetings to laugh
@nypost Don't worry the democrats are on your side, need free stuff and leniency call us. NO ID required we trust you.
@USATODAY Should of saved some of that money before paying the bar bills as Celebrate got the best of you.
@grgbkr37 @peachy_witchy I'm confused she only started wearing the head scarf sine Mr. Trump has been in office. But, 911, beheading soldiers, burning pilots in cages, blowing up catholic churches did not make her think twice. Only in America do we let nut jobs have a voice no matter how stupid.
@mauidiver1 @TheMaverick_M Foreign affairs are you kidding Nancy.
@mitchellvii @jonhsanders2 Sadly Bill, I doubt many newbie Democrats and liberals actually know what the Magna Carta is.
@TrumpDailyNewss @ElaineS74713643 She forgot to ask Nancy Pelosi how to dress,Nancy must be so upset with her worn out old smirk and make-up cracking with that plastic smile wishing she could wear boots like that. hey the Democrats weeks in congress,holiday in PR maybe she lost her luggage to dress like that?
@jaybebo84 @TheMaverick_M Come on another lie from Republicans, Democrats say no WORRIES!, as long as they don't come to my district not a problem. We'll contain it in the republican areas and CNN will never inform the rest of the nation.Hey! eat up enjoy that food street food with their sanitation ways.
@rial_rocks @jonhsanders2 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS ISIL must be laughing their heads off unlike the ones they removed from US soldiers or the burning of a man in a cage.Anyone who even listens to this,well I can't really said what I want as an ex serviceman. How come she never spoke like that during an election. She fooled people
@nypost Be prepared and stop the $6 coffees at Starbucks. Put money in the bank it's called savings. Pay your bills and stop using credit cards you can not afford. Who uses credit cards to buy food and spent cash on smokes? Are you crazy?
@charliekirk11 I think he's a lot smarter than that and always has a back-up plan. Learning curve the next hard lesson will be on the Democrats. They won the battle not the war. Let them enjoy a few moments in the sun before the next face-off with Mr. Trump.
@RyanAFournier @peachy_witchy Come on, it's a Blue state and the average Democrat there are clueless where their taxes go. You live a life never driven a car, been outside the city and think this is how everyone is. Well, the land of OZ is a fantasy just like living or being stuck in a concrete land call home
@TheMaverick_M No, that's the Presidential power.
@mitchellvii @TheMaverick_M Sadly, during WWll the local German's did not believe in the death camps until they were shown and helped buried the bodies of those in the camps. Perhaps,the harsh reality of the influx of immigrants and and some of the bad things they bring with them must be SHOWN MORE.
@catturd2 @jonhsanders2 Easy, check the medical receipts sent to the tax payers to keep her breathing on the bench for liberals.
@STACEYDUBOIS4 @jonhsanders2 You forgot Nancy in the family photo.
@AP_Oddities Just don't forget to feed it on time. I know my loving Pit Bull gets a little upset if I don't feed her on time! Watch those fingers.
@emzanotti @SebGorka And during the shut-down she and other Democrats were in Puerto Rico with lobbyist. How much tax payers money was used? Never heard about her giving her salary to help as Mr. Trump gives his salary to agencies and their causes.
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Mr. President; Wall off Calif. and N.Y. and let them in and Pelosi and the others can find the money to feed, shelter, house them without my tax dollars. Let's she what she out of the left side of her hat tricks. And the next crime committed or drug overdose will be on her!
@BreitbartNews Maher, is the jerk to be so foul mouth to a teenager and think just because the man was old puts him in the right. No big words when he burst into a church. It's just another comedy attempt to make money. You SUCK MAHER , YOUR WHOLE FAMILY to how does that feel you BIG PRICK!
@RealJamesWoods @SebGorka And to think the Democrats remembered my Birthday! What a great gift free, free and why only republicans paying for this lucky day? Oh! the other 325 million sending me free stuff thanks to your buddies the Democrats!
‘Pelosi does not mess around’: Democratic speaker emerges triumphant from shutdown https://t.co/oQBsJp2Nje Triumphant for Democrats lost to American people. I hope she has a plan when immigrants hit the US border.and let them go to CA. and they can feed, shelter, employ them.

'No one should ever underestimate the speaker': How Pelosi won the shutdown battle https://t.co/9rPFddkZXZ She separated a situation as a woman trying to prove a point. I hope see lives long enough to see her stupidity.
'No one should ever underestimate the speaker': How Pelosi won the shutdown battle https://t.co/3ktb7V9Gp3 she she was to undermind the government of the USA. Like the Big Socialist from NY. Rot in Hell Nancy, you destroyed America. I bet she does not even eat Mexican food.
I'm done with the USA, thank everyone who i have enjoyed to seriously tried to have discussions of what is possible. But, I will not live in a SOCIALIST COUNTRY this is no longer AMERICA????????????????
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews A Recon Ranger is Army and he was a Marine reservist in the states, Awol several times,in the Brig. What else is these dumb dumb done, Airborne or Navy Seal?
@realDonaldTrump President Trump sir, about the hats. Want to confuse CNN and others the hats should be various colors and then they would have to ask the meaning of that. Red shows anger. I like magenta personally.
@RepDanCrenshaw @SebGorka 4 more than before, keep it up Mr.Crenshaw to discuss with the other side of the house to come to the table and talk like a real politician of the position you and them were elected to do to support the best interest for us citizens. We voted for you all to be our voices.

@my2gr8girls @Lexa_Merica He was a Reservist in the Marines and never left the states and  AWOL many times, In the Brig. Sorry, he was a degrace to the uniform from the start. And shouts his mouth and barges into a church to make a point, Lock him like before. He's also a disgrace to his tribe.
@spweber54 My first carrier deployment in 1976, she's big, bad and deadly. Worked the Flight Deck like being a pit crew at Indy, a kick in ass but your head has to be on a swivel  all the time or it will bite you. Did 4 more cruises on 4 different carriers, Enjoyed my naval career.

@nypost They can't be to mentally ill if they know how to sue!
@Reuters If Iraq's parliament can settle they differences why can't the Democrats come to the table?
@SenatorCantwell Instead of a letter how about going in person and cast a proper vote and reason with other Democrats on the several sections of the bill Mr. Trump and the Republican have proposed.
@NBCNews @TheRISEofROD If he's smart, take a plane full of the corruption money and go on a long vacation before the people make a example of him in prison or hanging from a rope.
@nytimes STOP POUNDING THAT DRUM!
@nytimes He was a Native American veteran of the Vietnam War? Again, fake news he never was in Nam, Awol several times, put in the Brig get your facts right. Oh! that would not sell news to the leftist.
@CNN Tell that to democrats who are taking a 3 day weekend after being in Puerto Rico with lobbyist.
@CBSNews Good thing he bought it now before a certain Democrat gets a 70% tax on people like him. he worked hard and made money he should enjoy it the way he wants Democrats.

@Reuters A land locked country which took in 1 million immigrants and production slowing and now finding a way to deal with 1m immigrants telling the rest of the world to not focus on national Interest. She has guts to dictate to others when she has causes a crisis in her own country.
@AP No credentials, the president? And his son a big game hunter? You know where to find them right a place called the White House. Perhaps using that same statement on how so many other people with questionable backgrounds get their gun license in NY? And they sold on the streets.
@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi Why is it only the Republicans are at work and the Democrats are not.If no show can we dock their PAY! has any of them actually spoken to any CBP agents in person Instead of a holiday with lobbyist in Puerto Rico go to the border and speak with them and observe the real situation
@mitchellvii Hopes see gets better.
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations to NBC for this video and your heard it from a 30 year CBP officer calling it a crisis. The post style barrier Obama spent money on did not and will not continue to work. Stand your ground Mr. President and please show this at your State of the Union address.
@JZahav1 @TheRISEofROD @AmyMek @RealCandaceO I lived and worked in Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis were nice and not radical, But, for the radical Muslims they use children as a weapon and brainwash them just as Hitlers trained children for war with their youth corps.

@charliekirk11 @murawski_joe Were we not told government was going to trim the budget? Retraining in the private sector is a better investment for the general population and companies who want those skills of these workers.

@Reuters @Breakingviews @ClaraMarquesRTR A country with vast potential for reform and the Elites blow him off. I guess when the riches industrial group who would want political stability in the world. No money in peace in their eyes. The Top 1% enslaving us. Mr.Trump does not want to part of that group for good reasons.

@LATAMforTRUMP @Lexa_Merica @SpeakerPelosi @Millie__Weaver @Lrihendry She lost she coldn't find the chamber to vote or someone took away her rattle toy. All she has to do is follow the TV news cameras to work.

Wait the newbies been to busy on TV how do you expect them to read what was done behind the scenes of government. How many Democrats are living in their new free office,now they have time  to read
@harjo111 @Lexa_Merica @realDonaldTrump Of course!
@Independent When will entertainers learn the days of having groupies in your room after a show and drugs in the hotel are over. All the money you save from legal fees.
@Serremmy @dixie_normas The Hate speech is free speech is a little overboard. But, proper points in a discussion is fine and no need to speak of hate unless your Kathy Griffin.
@WSJ Let's hustle women out of more money on this nonsense. Nancy Pelosi could use some help with that problem breaking a sweat from flying around the world and working in a kitchen.
@AmyKremer @LATAMforTRUMP @SpeakerPelosi She just wanted a free meal and some wallet size pictures taken for her fans.
@RT_com It took this bill to force NATO countries to anti-up!
@WSJ @EdwardConard But the WSJ supports Democrats, cracks starting to show in loyalties.
@RealJamesWoods @jack Surprise CNN doesn't have the balls to hire her. But, their is always SNL and Baldwin.
@RealJamesWoods @jack Practice with Kathy Giffin first and then the congresswoman calling my president a MotherF***er on national TV with kids all around here. And hey before the world ends in 12 years can you take the other NYC loud mouth too?
@Reuters Slow is smart.
@Independent So many stupid people in the world today. What if one of their relatives were on those flights?
@TheEconomist And another 10,ooo at the border digging under Obama's fence.
@AnthonyMixerWA @Lexa_Merica Kind of expensive to travel from D.C. to Ohio. Free food, but who pays the cost of travel, hotels etc.Only benefit is free publicity. Hey, call the lobbyist that paid for the 30 Democrats and their holiday with family in P. Rico. better yet CNN might paid for the TV rights!
@washingtonpost They explain the impact of the volcao's below the Arctic, Yellowstone, Mt. Etna etc.. and do't forget animal farts!
@Briteeye777 @Lexa_Merica @TeedIsMe @kvmidd85 @KellsBellsSC @jonz970 @armyvetgramps @KenGrimes9 @AngeleStar11 @LoriinUtah Well said! Causing service personnel men and women to be put in a political debate over Miscellaneous gender types with a need for combat readiness is not fair for the military or the individuals wishing to make a political stance. private sector fine, war zone?
@RealSaavedra Has she every done any work in congress yet? Has a staff with a budget,wasted taxpayers money and she's all over the TV and news. Is this what you Democrats voted for in her. 😉
@nypost The co-pilot?
@RealSaavedra So, Behar admits like CNN hasdn't  said SOME people ( news medias)  jump the gun on the story to rid the country of president Trump. Didn't quite work out that way did id Joy?
@cnni Blame the storm, infrastructure design of the homes and services lack of preparedness, local officials. But, don't blame a strain system. it's an island rapid response is a little hard to do duh!
@CGTNOfficial Or the trail of people to afraid to stand up to the government and gangs but see a easy out with foreign money. Now, I understand Davos cmments  that 4th &amp; 5th generations will be in the work force. To supplement others who don't work.
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN It wouldn't have make a difference to you or Lemon, you just move on to the next story to hassle Mr. Trump
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Fair play, the Democrats have spent 2 years of tax dollars pursing Mr. Trump, now let's spend 2 years watching Democrats spending tax dollars defending Clinton's emails. Only to boost the bottom $$$ line of CNN, NYT, WP and others.
@nypost Sorry, Ann the Democrats said the world ends in 12 yers, so drink up quicker.
@yhwhuniversity @Lexa_Merica @prageru @PJMedia_com Thank you, Lincoln got it as a Republican and at all risk for the civil war to continue signed the proclamation to free slaves and he had salves. Democrats especially the new young bloods don't know any history of either party in history.
@IndyMusic @Independent Maybe the female acts that applied are not very talented
@Reuters What happen to those empty housing buildings? And still more, why?
@Reuters @AARP @JoAnn_Jenkins Only because the Elites will cause this situation economically to force us to work until 75 before a pension.
@CGTNOfficial Pick on the president fine, but why pick on the wife and children. Poor taste, sensationalism only.!
@CNN @richardquest He gets paid to play in the snow, good job!
@RT_com I meant to say from threats of neighbors on Israel's  borders throwing rocks to threaten a bombing from Syria back military of the Iranian regime.

@cnni @CillizzaCNN I vote at the Thomas Jefferson memorial a founding father.
@Forbes Scientist can't develop a bio-degrade bag? I read once of paper six pack holders. On the Moon, going to Mars, super colliders, robotic surgery, silk stockings, artificial heart and limbs and the scientific community can't make a disposable bio-degradable BAG?

@Reuters @WesternUnionCEO When I can change my name to George Jetson and live on Mars. I live in Asia where they do not want or take credit cards or ATM debit cards. They want cash! This is what comes out of Davos because electronic monitoring of your personal cash flow will be controlled.
@APWestRegion @AP The average H. S. Teacher pay in Denver,is $57,014  January 16, 2019, but the range  between $49,776 &amp; $65,820.

@latimes It's a start, hope he stays safe to make a change there.
@Reuters Productive lobbying n Puerto Rico with all the Democrats on lobbyist dime.
@CBSNews How did they get all the way to the USA immigration border and Mexico did stop them down South with this new process?
@cnni So, the Democrats should support him now. decades in government before and he made mistakes. America, and you to give this guy another shot with your future?
@VP @Scavino45 Mr. Pence, yes we need to work with our partners in this Western Hemisphere just as China &amp; Russian are doing in The East But please tread carefully we don't need an uprising here on behave of them.The people will  make the move. Build a relationship with the friendly there first
@CBSNews Legal worker on their payroll? Why did she avoid correct name exchange? most importantly why was the dog hit by a car, not on a leash as required in the city in public? Sorry, for their lost as I love my dog very much too. The dog didn't die it was KILLED by a careless person.
@globaltimesnews Takes the fun out of having a 32 inch and A/C and refrigerator inside to get away from the wife and kids some days!
@WSJ Real estate is the big thieves of the downturn of the housing situation.
@TIME Confused by the banner " Teachers on strike for themselves and students on early holiday".
@nypost Nothing new about that. Lucky, they sold their home others LOST their homes to banks and were force to live in house trailers and others in cars.
@Reuters Bad idea, even worst corruption and monitoring than would be the government.
@jabeale Referring to Jim.
@jabeale With your rude demeanor wouldn't avoid you?
@RedNationRising @ElaineS74713643 Won't hear or see that on CNN.
@SenatorCantwell And using birth control and having their partners wear condoms should be no a brainier!
@CNN Aug 23, 2018 - Roll Call estimates Elizabeth Warren's net worth at $4.7 million, making her the 69th wealthiest member of Congress. You first Senator Warren.
@cnni @richardquest Igloo to show differences at a WEF? Quest try a PowerPoint presentation next time with facts, sorry forgot your CNN. Build a bigger Igloo to show the differences between real news and Fake news. CNN's would be bigger to fit all that bullshit inside.
@Alyssa_Milano Students visiting the Lincoln memorial, went there to hassle women, disrupt MLK day, insult a senior native American, start political turmoil with a red hat. God forbid they ate McDonald's the same food Mr. Trump served at the White House. Your on crack! or should be!
@NBCNews Again. entertainer  paid to perform in Las Vegas and sounds off politically during a show. I would of wanted a refund from the show. Hey, Don lemon but no MAGA hat but voices political words at an entertainment venue is OK. When will it stop? Democrat nonsense speakers in toilets
@HuffPost She's just Ghetto and disrespectful to all women.She only wants the money and attention. Anyone who takes her serious well has no sense of decent behavior. Sell your song not wiggle your asses liken a strip joint. And loose a few ponds some of those asses are soooo ugly!
@CassandraRules Hey, another potential Democratic Congresswoman for the future, you think? She better hurry before the world ends in 12 years.
@cnni Puerto Rico for decades has allowed itself to become a welfare country. Try to build a common goal for the residents and stop waiting in line each month for the welfare check every month. be productive PR and responsible. States on the mainland need help to your not the only one.
@AC360 @CNN @SenWarren Free enterprise and companies control the wages of a worker for productivity and need, also the type of work IE; McDonald's cook $15 per our to cook burgers or a school teacher with a degree. Can't pay equal for unequal skills Warren!
@RT_com Take some of those left over FEMA trailers from Katrina and park them outside on the back lawn and charge rent? problem fixed. Does a democrat from the city know how to use a outhouse and Sears catalog?
@HuffPost Excuse me asking if your a American citizen to get a handle on how many people illegal here is a major concern. How many now, and how many in coming years as least before the world ends in 12 years according to the Democrats.
@Lrihendry You mean I only get to watch 12 more Superbowl games, and eat $5 dollar Dominoes pizza, The world is ending! Thanks Democrats for keeping me info,  what I would do without you and your  loud mouth thoughts!
@GovInslee @AGOWA Now work on the drug problem, Illegals in places like Yakima and make Seattle pay for the tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way not Eastern Washington State.
@Independent The West did not let them down they did it all by themselves. Billions of dollars in aid and they riot, burn and still destroy their own country. Time to exit this ancient country sucking the west down with it.
@LindaForAmerica @Lexa_Merica Don lemon said on 22 Jan. on air that there is the Separation of Church and State as he reference the M.A.G.A hat on the HS kids heads. But, Congresswoman Omar wearing a RELIGION SYMBOL HEAD WEAR IS OK IN CONGRESS. HUM!
@usminority @Lexa_Merica @TamikaDMallory @lsarsour @Alyssa_Milano @chelseahandler @JudgeJeanine @TuckerCarlson Why no Men's march, we get sick to.
@adjunctprofessr @Lexa_Merica @POTUS Democrats will do anything and spent the WALL money to keep her breathing on the bench.
@gspatton007 @Lexa_Merica The kid or the old man banging a drum in his face?
@bud_cann @Lexa_Merica Instead of shooting off her big mouth in the media she loves,  how about learning and studying all of the bills in congress. Does she even know how to cast her vote?	Nostradamus she's not.
@STEPHMHAMILL @iamcardib It's a reflection of greed on her part and producers. And they when something happens to cause someone to be sexist the #metoo peple go crazy. WOMEN you should flag/protest this video. Your slogan" Do what I say not what I do right girls. can't have it both ways.
@jabeale Thank goodness Gomer Pyle didn't show his always smile. Now it's a crime to be just you and then hassled over a hat. CNN bashing the HAT, SMILE and saying the kid disrespected the elder.Perhaps the elder beating a drum in the kids face should of backed away. suppose to wise at 92
@nypost Why?
@KKpower7 @Lexa_Merica @JohnKerry @realDonaldTrump I thought he was unemployed and why speak in Davos? He no longer represents American interest. His retirement pay must be good to afford to go there and hob-nob with Elites! And they he trashes the president. He must be on CNN payroll to like the ex-Ohio trader.
@USMC This what the men and women do to protect our country. What have you done today average citizen? You protest, turn over cars after a game, riot and burn businesses  in the name of WTO. Kneel at a sporting event bringing politics to a football game, what's wrong with the US?
@Harlan @CNN Aerosmith had it right " Something wrong in the world today".
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You mention earlier briefly Mr. President but a "barrier" is a control point for the legal process another main purpose of the control barriers to stop people from digging tunnels, hiding in trucks etc. for their own safety. Also to stem the flow of illegal activities.
@Reuters Plus the 30,000 recorded murders last year in Mexico.
@latimes About time for change there like in Mexico to finish corruption in those countries and dictatorships.
@RepDanCrenshaw @dixie_normas To continue sir, excuse me. Get in the spotlight for all Republicans who voted for and supported you and for the silence voices. Someone who is new needs to stand-up to the loud mouth, foul mouth, uneducated, rude young Dem. congress. Your not afraid to be a target, go get them!
@RepDanCrenshaw @dixie_normas Mr. Crenshaw your a smart guy, I and others know what it takes to be who you were. I know you can handle the spot light and pressure of the media. Like the new Dem. members who are showboating get in there and sound off to the public with correct info.
@RepDanCrenshaw @dixie_normas Thank you Mr. Crenshaw for the update. 6 democrats is a start but for the newbies with their strong left leanings and complete lack of  understand how a government works is their problem and should be help accountable to all citizens left &amp; right. Won't see this story on CNN.
@ChuckCallesto Come down off your high horse!
@freedom_moates Be like SNL and put a bounty on her scalp.
@Independent Shark infested waters and a tourist destination for families on a the worlds largest cruse ship which dumps garbage over the side and attracts sharks?  Sounds like fun! Jump in but exit?
@RealJamesWoods I guess using proper English is not her strong suit. I wonder does she use a MAN'S razor to shave or a girl one?
@funder @DakarEthan Not getting current pay NOW but will still get BACK PACK PAY AND HAVE THAT NICE GOVERNMENT JOB MOST PEOPLE WISH FOR THERE!
@RT_com Beauty and no brains.
@SenatorCantwell And put Mom and Pop operations out of business. I know my restaurant closed because of labor cost not only to me my products and utilities went up from my vendors. hit from both sides.
@nypost Sounds like a Jim Carey movie OH! GOD on line?
@maziehirono @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump hos·tage/ˈhästij/nounnoun: hostage; plural noun: hostages	a person seized or held as security for the fulfillment of a condition. You should choose your words more carefully Democrats. Buy a dictionary and read one.
@maziehirono @TSA Look forward to hear how they will Piss away their back pay!
@USATODAY Who is the woman in the car?
@MSNBC Like your suntan from PR.
@latimes You phase she's wining the SHUTDOWN, no one is winning what about the rest of us 325 million people who don't care who is winning one on one. it's not about an old broad having a job an a big EGO  and a small desire to care for people.
@RT_com Stupid and sick and again put men in a bad light.
@WashTimes Now he's Joking. Well, think before you speak but now the world knows what a jerk he is.
@TIME Remove the background of the Fighting Irish too, OK. What's next. Must I learn about our history good and bad from an internet source from China or Russia?
@HuffPost The life of a music star with questionable MORAL VALUES and history judging Mrs. Pence is to funny!
@CStamper_ Can I borrow her crystal ball or get a good table in the bar she worked at?
@freedom_moates Offering a sex act for exchange of a favor or money is a crime in most states. Attention geter that's all.
@USATODAY More money but striking for students?
@RT_com 5 o'clock shadow still showing.
@SenGillibrand Why is the message she sends that White people must join men and women of color? Has she every traveled though America and see the DIFFERENT COLORS of people from all over the world in the US. And blame me because born white skin thinks I don't  understanding?
@AC360 @CNN @JohnKasich @andersoncooper He's on the payroll of puppeteers now.
@charliekirk11 they wrote ; TheY WORE.
@SenatorCantwell First it was a drug issue, they the native Americans issue and now firefighters. can you not solve nor discuss  one major topic at a time. What about the Alaskan Way if at the wrong time can kill thousands of people and cause an economic  disaster in the city of Seattle.
@freedom_moates Complains about hats, well we should protest views on buying logos of sports, restaurants, internet companies, Amazon, or any other form of free expression just to suit her in the Ivory tower she has been lucky to achieve because of people. troll something important besides hats!
@CGTNOfficial Mom to busy on the cell phone!
@Independent Where do these Tee-Shirts being made the Girls think in a Union shop in America. But, they like the income from sales of them.
@charliekirk11 Mahome will go into the history books before he reaches Brady age in the NFL.
@SenatorCantwell Because of the #TrumpShutdown, #TribalHealth programs like the Thunderbird Treatment Center could be interrupted. Hey. Ms. Cantwell how about stopping the flow of drugs into Washington State and the Native American budget rules are Federal not State. I love the words="Could Be"
@freedom_moates I hope he saves his money because he is and has been a negative influence on Blacks and White liberals who should not take him serious with such PERSONAL OPINIONS, His job report is news not try to lecture, And take his buddy Como with him.
@charliekirk11 Why? the teachers didn't strike like in L.A. for a pay raise to give teachers motivation in the work place and the parents Oh! well the children repeat the same mistakes of them. Turn off the headphones and read a book together. Schools are not a babysitting service!
@freedom_moates Sorry, I look forward to their debates and see you trashes who. New material for SNL and Democrats. Old versus new Black vs. White CNN news should be interesting more than now. Dig up dirt, but I must wait 18 months so sad, TV is getting boring with CNN repeats of thinking.
Nick Sandmann believes "that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping to [defuse] the situation." https://t.co/t7ij1XK26U via @HuffPost Watching the video I only saw that youth did not understand the cultural theme of the Native Americans But, he just stood there ?

@JacobAWohl I thought it was a women's march for something else not voices outside issues.
@JacobAWohl She is in America and she voices opinions about Israel? She freedom of speech but why she never spoke that way back home. She lives here to start more internal issues that she is clueless about.
@PressSec @JohnCornyn And they did it the legal way, right on.
@JohnCornyn It's OK it has driven the criminals out  who had preyed on the tourist.
@Independent What happen to pure comedy not satire all the time on shows like SNL. Where is Jim Belushi when you need him.
@nytimes And that was the Great Depression Era and those people she helped wanted to work because they lost everything farming and jobs. Watch Cinderella Man a true story where he returned the helping hand money. people today will they do that or continue the terrible welfare freebies?
@MSNBC First bring back the 30 Democrat politicians and have them pay back into the system for all the money and perks from the 109 Lobbyist who were there to influence than and my tax dollars. It did not work on Clinton having SEX in the oval office over the desk while people worked.
@CNN Cut in serves to people in prison and hungry strike. Hungry strike saves money great. Services, free education, dental, a bed, food, TV, newspapers, phone access Wow! They are in prison for a crime right or the lives they destroyed who some never recover from means nothing
@nytimes Anyone every hear of welding?
@guardian Find a new partner or buy batteries.
@Independent Go ahead Democrats lift sanctions there?
@Forbes Yes. watch YouTube all day and South Park and the younger Democratic want-a-be leaders bring that experience to the America public.
@mitchellvii Does the word Compromise every enter your thoughts to a real situation facing us. Old saying: " Can't have your cake and eat it too", unless you share.
@freedom_moates Can we send dictionaries to those poor liberals who only understand CNN, NYT, WP poor journalism vocabulary. Wait, is Journalism to big of a word for them? Where is my Thesaurus when I need it.
@MSNBC Joke of the day, right? At least now  a Republican can go to a restaurant and hear the voices of Democratic voters who question why are we the Democrats acting like our Mascot? Call Nancy!
@nytimes Can't share fake news only the fake news you try to Bullshit us with, senior and very smart. Tell your younger staff to prepare better background data before you splash it on the masses. Old people not confused you do that well for yourselves.
@BBCNews Forget the potential of injury but buy a sovereign?
@RT_com There goes the Lolly Pop industry and is there an age requirement to enjoy Lick-able food in Turkey. Can blow things up but don't lick your ice cream cone?
@cnni Like that is new information?
@USATODAY Now he must be accountable to speaking to one team not the other. What do play USA TODAY good cop/bad cop. Don't you have a favorite team? Do you see the Seahawks callin Dallas and saying hey great game. You pick on the family, fast-food lunch, hats and now sports, Anything left
@charliekirk11 10 billion and free gas well only if you are quick to get it in a busted gas line. No story on El Chappo saying he gave 100 million to the former president. Hell, if he was my dealer gave me that he be my best buddy!
@freedom_moates His style hat is; M.I.L.H. =Make Illegals Live Here, and screw the rest of https://t.co/yhXJK094tr.A. citizens here? Can't remember the last time I received something for free without having to work for it. Mr. Trumps compromise is fair until the government sits down to talk.
@freedom_moates Freedom of speech, religion First Admendment rights and this man hates HATS or the Color red or just can be supportive of M.A.G.A.- Make America Great Again movement. Oh! he's a Democrat,
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees who were set to  visit with American troops stationed abroad, while receiving briefings  on the status of an ongoing war. Now I know who else was on the trip, valid but still bad time. Sorry readers the news only shows some points
Trump White House reportedly sought to put Pelosi 'in her place' https://t.co/tryTgVuN8Y via @msnbcNever heard the purpose of her trip? So, her to say that Mr. Trump put in danger? What's next for these https://t.co/QS5cou2A9g about Hamilton/Burr duel?
@CNN Confused the kids are no protesting for a pay raise?
@CNN Don't these women have a job or the MEN back home earning the pay checks?
@SenatorCantwell That's why Boeing moved a operation to the Nonunion East Coast. And if not for the Military bases in the state the cash flow would disappear. Sorry, Senator lived 20 years there and know how the military payroll improves the states wealth. Ex Navy. Microsoft campus India.
@MSNBC "This is cruelty as a strategy"which the immigrants dragging children thousands of miles and many not even be their parents hoping to enter the US. The cruelty lies on the shoulders of those who think they can just enter the country expect a big welcome. Move South to Venezuela.
@Forbes They own the equipment now would be a good buy at 6 bucks a share, they will survive who else is there?
@ChuckCallesto Didn't bother to ask the coffee vendor who knows everyone and where. I thought they were given a syllabus in their indoc? Oh! it wasn't in socialist language. And she thought/thinks she can just barge into his office and do her thing with cameras in tow. Youth is wasted on youth!
@nytdavidbrooks @nytimes But, all they want now is show me the "Money", instead of the union reps do negotiating they shut down the school system worst the government shutdown and the impact already on families who are government workers. If they had passion they should being using better common sense,
@CBSNews Obama's fence just derailed 400 people and they had to spend time digging under and yet Mr. Trumps barrier which would be anchored deep below the surface would slow down many more before the CBP arrive, you think. Nothings perfect. it's a barriers understand that word correctly,
@Reuters She's definitely not the art teacher.
@CNN LA teachers demanding to get an equal education and yet her sign is not in English and she's a teacher demanding more money to teach in a AMERICAN school system. Try teaching the national language first please.
@freedom_moates All that education,socialist thoughts to the door steps of AMERICA.Plenty of opportunities in South America. Venezuela needs people like her with their inflation rate. Venezuela's inflation rate? Today, the annual inflation rate is 60,324%, and the monthly rate is 94%
@nypost Guess he never hear of the bird flu potential.
@freedom_moates When was the news just the news and allow us to decide on the material presented and Mr. Lemon leave your personal opinions out and stop trying to lecture me. I have about 3 decades on you and actually lived in the 50's and 60's and 70's when there was a big problem on streets,
@Reuters Private detention centers. You make it sound like a hotel. They broke the law and get 3 meals a day and a bed and hot/cold water. THEY are in a JAIL where criminals go. And complain they have a commissary? Wish I when to that jail when I had a DUI.
@freedom_moates I guess Democrats get more pay at CNN than Republicans are not willing to pay for Fake news presenters.
@BrianPendleton @Tesla No spare tire. How to change a tire for Dummies should be included than.
@MSNBC Why should she or others be commended on  because their views are different. Why must I accept their views about their choices when they try to challenge my believes. Freedom of choice is what American for. You do your thing I'll do my thing and live in equal balance, OK?
@globaltimesnews Looks like a DC3 to me!
@elonmusk @InsideEVs Like your car, but please keep those from China in those Asia markets. Bring a Chinese made car back into America with this advance technology is a slap in the face to Americans who built this country.
@CNNPolitics You've studied Mr. Trumps body language and wrote stories. Try analyzing the grin on Peliso fave with gravel. A little girl with a big hammer, smoke and mirrors.
@charliekirk11 What's worst a tent city in America or the streets of Mexico. I would chose the tent city before being returned back home than the streets. When they are returned home I hope they influence others to not try to do the same thing heading North.
@MSNBC @GarrettHaake How many trips has she every been overseas in a war zone and what came out of the visit. And if she thinks as a woman the Muslim leaders (male), wish to deal with her well she's clueless of the Middle East and its culture. I worked 9 years there and it is a man's world,
@nypost She was headed to a war zone and she claims the president put her in a dangerous position. Like she does not think even on a commercial aircraft nobody overseas would know she was there. Where is she sleeping plus the others tagging along. Holiday Inn and no news cameras.
@MSNBC Yes, because their budget is part of the DOT. But most live on station in government housing just as the NAVY, ARMY and Marines with no cost to them. Secondly, the bases are making arrangements with their internal services and local communities like the banks are to.
@freedom_moates @AOC She can  afford it now with her generous government job. But has she said she will give her salary away? How does that work if your taxed 70% and don't wish to live in Sweden?
@CGTNOfficial I guess the tunnels recently in Arizona of 400 people is not and important fact? Or the New caravan from Honduras heading North  is not factual either. So where are these invisible people that are not causing a crisis, Busy digging more tunnels I think.
@RT_com Sounds like Budweiser marketing with Borne on date. Blood is Blood sorry, I've had several surgeries and blood transfusions and no one every asked what year or vintage of Blood I wanted. Hey ,at this point I'll take Schwarzenegger blood. At least I believe his Blood would be good

@darhar981 @TroyShilling @YoungCons Members of Congress don’t make tactical or logistical decisions in  Afghanistan. The president does that. Nancy belongs in Washington doing  her job negotiating the end to this shutdown. Correct!
@babsmarshall1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @GeraldoRivera He's hated because he 's a sleazeball (Clinton),and a cheat.He's hated because he lies.  No problem just comparing crimes that were proven to the citizens of the USA. Unlike the the current hate train the Democrats seem to be onboard with against Trump.
@nytimes Obama prosecuted mothers for coming to the United States illegally. He fast tracked deportations. And yes, he housed unaccompanied children in tent cities.	Read more here: https://t.co/xKKn42fBZR
@freedom_moates Just got the job and now she knows everything that has been going for 2 years with Muller. Must be nice to have that crystal ball that spits out data like "IF", maybe, not proven, possibly and so many other finger pointing words still. Do your job Ms. and focus on your voters.
@NBCNews If is not on Facebook or in a video game you think  a H.S. student is going to care what happen 70 years ago! And they want a pay raise from 50k-75k they all ready get to teach this subject matter. What happen to Sci., Math and reading and writing guides?
@Independent Huffington Post, Mr Dorsey responded to a  hypothetical question about whether Trump would be removed from Twitter  if he asked each of his followers to murder one journalist. Where do you get these ideas from CNN? Again you and CNN, HYPOTHETICAL, IF, POTENTIALLY. WHAT NONSENSE!
@SenatorCantwell Dear Senator, great idea but had never read or seen a concrete plan from the Democrats. I read the voting roll calls and still not a sustainable idea on the table. And mandatory ACA was and not the answer.
@nypost I wouldn't call her dangerous just a LOUD mouth kid with no real world understand outside the Burroughs of NYC.
@freedom_moates Little minds and big egos in the Democratic party don't get the big picture how important it is at this time that NK is straining to warm up to the idea of being a good neighbor in ASIA and remove threats to the South. This is because of the current WH efforts.
@babsmarshall1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @GeraldoRivera Where was your voice when President Clinton was bend over his desk in the Oval office and he wasn't alone as men and women like me were serving our country standing guard protecting the constitution.
@therealtmac13 @DonaldJTrumpJr @GeraldoRivera More like the Democrats play book and start with the word "MF" to determine which party  is the loudest and most rude.
@NBCNews Sorry, I keep hammering away that with today's technology that a finger print recognition chip on the trigger/grip of a weapon could avoid such terrible lost of live.
@Curtzo604 @NBCNews Correct. but the team provides the accident reports and thousands of engineers based on those reports evolve  the technology to prevent it from happening in the future. I understand very well with 20 years in aviation and being a QA inspector/trainer.
@CuomoPrimeTime @SenWhitehouse Again with the word "IF", don't know your skill sets but in  business world and when I was in Aviation the word "IF", is not use . It is or it is "NOT". Innocent until proven guilty but shareholders profit come first at CNN Right?
@freedom_moates Give her a Grammy award for the best role of acting like she really lives in the modern world outside of NY and DC.
@guardiannews It's suppose to be a late night show and entertain not a continuous stream of news. Learn to be funny first not a CNN interpreter.
@MSNBC She is the first Lady and her security issues require more details than Nancy Pelosi needs as just a member of congress
@USATODAY The good news is with a DNA discount and blood sample when you get robbed/murdered in a Mexican resort they can ID you.
@nytimes What will she do with all those Hats she wanted to sign for the troops?
@NBCNews Again, they are there after the fact of accidents and DO NOT prevent the accident before hand. The mass media makes it sound the World is coming to a end.
$11 toothpaste: Immigrants pay big for basics at private ICE lock-ups https://t.co/sR2imjvOuV Criminals have more rights than the LAW abiding  citizens. I've been in Jail and had food 3 times a day and toilet paper when needed. Cry me a river!
$11 toothpaste: Immigrants pay big for basics at private ICE lock-ups https://t.co/sR2imjvOuV You broke the law and in jail at taxpayers expense and safety and complain about having the Privileges of a commissary cost. ,
@Independent All those years in Congress and now Nancy wants to go visit troops why? or a stop over in PR with the rest of the Democrats feeding off the money of the lobbyist there.
@CNNPolitics Funny, 30 democrats and 109 lobbyist in PR at the same time? When your on a Island be prepare for the weather of a billion years of history!
@NBCNews Well welcome to the real world and businesses and the LAW states to avoid issues like that is to speak in National language of the country so others don't worry about what is said behind their backs.
@CNNPolitics Well her skills as a waitress/bartender are handy but, upstanding constitutional  law and history of law is not her strong point. Where is Jerry Springer when you need him?
@CNN No discounts for Warren? Indian or Mexican?
@CNN The fence Obama put in place unlike the wall/barrier which would sunken down 20-30 feet or so. Even EL Chappo would have a hard time with Mr. Trumps completion of a barrier on our borders. I guess they heard a dishwasher can get 21million dollars by refusing to work on a Sunday?
@RealJamesWoods Border war? Wrong dialog, it's about having and enforcing laws that impact not only the persons involved but to spare the average taxpayer from the burden of tackling their problems also. Tax more for success to give it away to BullS**t programs, don't think so!
@Independent Buy cheap Chinese sunglasses next time and drive slower. Blamed the SUN? The sun is always on schedule I think poor driving skills were involved not the Star that warms us.
@nypost Roll up the window! next time.
@Independent When you have money from selling books you can make any part of your body look and feel good.
@Independent I guess that explains why the New Democratic party are not very funny!
@Independent Did her insurance company pay for the damaged plastic car parts after she did her deed?
@CNN Don't understand why CNN would phase Muslim in America. She is American but why tag the word Muslim first? Religion is religion not part of your personal identity!
@NBCNews 325 million people in America and many church going people work on Sundays and still have a family and life. Church doors do not close at sunset. As for employment her skill at what she did can be workable everywhere. if you read she got some money but the lawyers got the big$$$
@WSJ EU always needed help and ask for handouts. And when the S**t hits the fan over Iran they will ask again for help.
@CNN @StCollinson Throwing the toys out of the stroller stage? What stupid nonsense words but wait  I forgot only Democrats can understand such childishness vocabulary.
@RepKatieHill @senatemajldr Why is it we only hear about Women's health care and not Men's health care issues?
@STEPHMHAMILL It time she will learn to ask the right questions and directions on her "Train of Democratic Policies" Think not!
@AsheSchow @jabeale This new fresh blood of the the Democrats is more entertaining than SNL. Wait why I haven't seen any skits on SNL live shouting MF to the audience and the sneakers is a nice touch for her, Ghetto style,
@MSNBC @Lawrence Wrong your mouth opens quicker than the when the REAL facts are told. I run for cover when Breaking news comes out because the fallout of lies is to much to handle.
@cnni Hopefully now they learnt to have a savings account not a cash card for Starbucks $5 coffee.
@freedom_moates Has this woman ever had a real job? White privileges where? Does she know that of the 325 million citizens in America are not all white?
@SenatorLeahy Open the government after the Democrats stop playing Ping-Pong with voters desires and needs and stop being self serving of their egos.
@nypost Forced to work on a Sunday how dare they do that. But, with 6 children to feed I would hoping for 8 days a week work to feed them. And last time I went to church it was in the evening as the door to GOD's place never closes even on a Sunday
@nypost An NYT calls us racist in America. Now you give a blood sample to get a discount?
@DanCrenshawTX @jabeale Common sense in politics is not the norm sometimes. Politicians avoid issues because if they solve a problem they have to much time on their hands like enjoying the lobbyist paid vacation in PR
@SenGillibrand Their children or a opportunity to bluff the immigration system that does not work.
@freedom_moates He is the one with the hangup on race. His views of life is from a armchair policy of talking but not living outside of the CNN mentality.
Trump's grounding of Pelosi's plane sparks political outcry: ‘One sophomoric response does not deserve another’ https://t.co/TjemJWNu4c She is just a spokes person why now and for what purpose after decades in government to visit places she never before. Showboating!
@thehill Speechless Democrats, wait still on holiday in PR and 109 lobbyist I guess. need to sleep off the hangovers and where to open new bank accounts from the Lobbyist. Eisenhower WARNED  about the military complex and their deep pockets!
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Like you don't eat junk food, please!  At least they exercise do you?
@HuffPost Good luck with that as long as CNN ,NYT, WP find you worthy of bring in money to the shareholders.
@CNN Helpless, she can't work the ATM by herself ?
@mikandynothem @dixie_normas But you did not address the issue did she arrive here legally?
@dixie_normas @ColumbiaBugle What you see and what you get from Politic and it is a double edge sword of truths and LIES.
@dixie_normas Those are the words I raised my right hand to in 1975 when I joined the navy
A Little Cafe In Kansas Feels The Ripple Effects Of The Government Shutdown https://t.co/GsxhQzY6sC Adjust and learn to not put all yours eggs in one basket, competition will get you always plan  in business to expect the unexpected
@globaltimesnews Now China dictates economical policy to UK? This is not Hong Kong.
@nypost Where on Mercer Island where gates lives?
@CNN Love to hear or see the batteries work in the winters of Chicago. How do jump start 16 batteries at once when you need to go to work to pay for those 16 batteries that fail in sub-zero Temps, have a good pair of winter boots ready, and take the 1$ bus ride there. Tesla=summer.
@CGTNOfficial About time.
@RT_com Profit, good gimmick like it will stop the problem or line the inventors pockets with $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@Independent You play you pay the price!
@RT_com About time.
@CNNPolitics Try retirement! with your generous government pension and free medical care which has cost the public over 500,00 dollars so far!
@USATODAY @LOLGOP @usatodayopinion Why is it no one talks about the Bush, Clinton, Obama shutdowns and tier impact at the time? So bias!
@HuffPost Wait I thought you were an American living in a country that doesn't see your race but yet you bring it up. maybe move to Montana and leave the ASIA card in Hawaii.
@PattyMurray Sorry for your bad luck,I have VA help but with 2 ankle fusions3 spinal surgeries, torn shoulder tissue an a wheelchair pay ALL MY MONEY to a health worker per month and unable to work or have a spouse to support me.Your problems were from the past your lucky you get what you get
@washingtonpost Where are the 39 Democrats right now in PR being dined by 109 Lobbyist who paid for them and family on a charter flight. Look in the mirror and try to tell the same story to your face or the American public,
@SenBlumenthal @Bradley_Airport You forgot to mention back pay or the free medical care they get NOW, The accumulation of sick days and vacation days. Where was your voice in 1995 when Clinton having fun in the oval office during his 26 days of shut down?
@SenGillibrand @maddow Get all the Press you can for now, but your message hasn't a sound direction or plan for the future of MEN/ women.  EQUALLY HASN'T BEEN SEEN BY YOU! ONLY BIAS.
@TIME What hurts more a truck with propagandist on it or a tank in the square.? Freedom is not for everyone I suppose.
@henryfountain It's not Global warming but the natural cycle of the planet, Try researching the volcanoes under the Arctic and Earths shifts in the plates which has been happening since the begging of mankind. You think a few electric cars will change the shift of the land mass we call Earth.
@Breakingviews @Reuters @edwardhadas I think you never spent time in Japan nor understand it's culture of being efficient, polite and safe compared to the other countries bidding for the games.
@JeffFlake Glad your retiring, Go back to school.
@JeffFlake Wait! Carbon tax money back to consumers of fossil fuels but not into the technology to improve filtering systems or ways to produce and recyclable the items we use. carbon tax has been around for over 10 years wake up dude, your way behind in technology.
@DGreenbaum Discipline and respect to those who have been on the planet before me which lead me to be a leader also in my time. Without that background I be as lost as today's generation whose knowledge comes from info like Facebook and other forms of money driven type culture.
@BBCNews Giant pet, but better to understand that the creature was used to retrieve oysters/pearls from the bottom of the sea floor only to be extracted by her to make profit. I guess the punishment  fits the misdeeds of humans for profit.
@RyanAFournier @Annabel98108346 Don't every wish to see her/him/? in a bikini on the beach.
@DavidJollyFL @Annabel98108346 @realDonaldTrump I think that you have no accounting or balance a check book skills as when the wall which began in the 90's under Bush and Obama even they saw a threat and the COST of illegal immigration to the economy and straining the social support system diverted from US citizens.
@ChrisAlbertoLaw @Annabel98108346 Watch your words in todays world where is the words that " That no man OR WOMAN" is above the law. With 121 women in congress and foul mouth Democrats and behavior insulting to the masses make sure you balance your word with facts. I think the congress threatens us more.
@RobbyMook @Annabel98108346 Tell you what show the public the 30,000 emails from her and convince me  that she did not break the laws in government.
@omzmusic @Annabel98108346 @realDonaldTrump Try doing one on Democrats restricting growth in America and giving away Billions and Billions  of$$$ that could used in our nation, We need to stop being the welfare handout to every foreign country and start to rebuild what we once was. You afraid of change for the better?
@realDonaldTrump @Annabel98108346 It's about time someone put them in their place. Mr. president the average Joe has no idea about the fingers they put in the world pie, sneaky people as always. It 48 years for them to reach the Moon but only weeks to destroy our economy and take jobs paid their citizens $14  day
@ShinySuccubus1 @Annabel98108346 @JohnJHarwood @JohnCornyn @ResistGeeks @MrScottLads @AryaResists @GUrthog @GR8FL @Prometheus_2020 @GrootResists @Sky_Lee_1 @American_Blonde Immorality ls not protecting American interest and having a system of checks and balances. But when Democrats like you give the hard earn tax dollars to foreign  cultures and ALLOW ILLEGAL people into the system to make yourself feel good while the rest of us carry the burden.
@rolandscahill @Annabel98108346 Sorry, I disagree I sense a man who wishes to put the future of this great country in the hands of the people like the revolutionary war but, with freedom comes responsibility and today to few people and especially the youth don't get it.
@kimberscogins Kim, i feel your pain having my First Amendment rights taken like CNN, NYT, WP Twitter has chosen sides and blocks any anti Democrat words when they are  criticized. But, we as a nation I hope are that stupid to be at their level of bias. .
@RealJamesWoods @kimberscogins @TheDemocrats Thanks James for raising my blood pressure more with the video of Maxine Waters. This only the beginning of what the new 121 women in Congress will do the mens voice. Like to see them dig a ditch in the rain for $7.45 per hour. More money to be made popping babies at home.
@DennisDMZ @kimberscogins better than a bleeding heart Democrat
Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Wash Dishes by Hand https://t.co/r2mWUyq9LU	Tell that to mother who why did i have kids to be a maid, I think not. hey kid you missed a spot. And for the young people I had to wash the floor on my hands and knees a MOP doesn't get in the corners.
@Independent Shooting fellow students changes a teenagers brain. maybe if they were to stone to load the weapon or forgot what school they went to smoking isn't such a bad thing.
@speedbum1974 @claumendoza83 @CNN No, they will find another way to twist the story had bad they had it. Why is it I don't hear from those of Clinton's 26 days and him having sex in the oval office during his shutdown? it seems Congress and government was having fun!
@Wisechoice_01 When will America break the cycle of welfare for the lazy. Believe or not when a person has employment many things change in their lives even if they feel the money is small. But in today's economic  the average wage is more than $10 an hour.
@Reuters Send some of those empty containers to the moon and bring back cottonseeds but please don't smash the TESLA CAR out there.. Oh! I forgot the Moon now is a Chinese territory. Moon Rocks imported and duplicated in China, patent pending!
@kimberscogins And I'm sure the 30 democrats in PR on lobbyist money are having a good time at the bar. Happy Hour all day.
@nypost Make friends, why is America worried like all younger people of the planet Facebook, Whatsup,Line all these medias influence and stir the youth. Like other Middle Eastern countries the young will discard the old ways just like in America when they don't  know what a dial phone is
@CNN So freedom of speech only exists when a Democrat say's it's OK.  I don't agree with there methods but they are entitled to freedom of speech too. The Black Panthers we're stop from free speech. Liberals like CNN, NYT, WP voice their distorted truths why not others?
@HellsKitchenFOX @GordonRamsay Come on Gordon play nice, I was like you when I owned a restaurant and my ex-wife brought that scene into court and I lost my business and that was 2001. Now in 2019 watch your back or you'll be dishing it up in free soup kitchens.
@Independent Your 18 what do know about women rights. And for the basters I lived and worked In Saudi for 9 years. I guarantee in years to come when she faces stereotypes here she be calling her father to come home
@CNN @CNNOpinion Why he's a drug dealer.  Why spend money on a drug dealer whose only purpose was to cause problems in Canadian society. Good Bye in drug hell! with the rest of your friends
@Independent 50 years ago I kissed Daniel in 4 grade when she wasn't ready I confess, I'm toxic Gillette.
@nypost Can touch this one, Did Ted Turner know she was a closet battery user?
@CBSNews Excuse me Federal employee has medical coverage for that. Where is Obama ACA? I don't think her mortgage payment is equal to free insulin, oh! sorry pay the deduct able what 10%, please. Retirement benefits, holidays, sick leave, vacation time where do you find these people?
@TIME I guess no grandparents or aunts or uncle form the 50s-60's, 70's and have never seen the History channel or have knowledge of the countries industrial revolution that brought them the Iphone! What do they teach in school Square Pants Bob reruns?
@nytimes That's great if they follow the law of the nation and not twist it into he/she battle which seems to be the trend with them.
@nypost Is this an example of the women's movement in DC. Wait a man made her do it that will be her plea, right?
@USATODAY I hope we recycle that good old steel with a high iron content. Hey Gillette razor blades for men,even the toxic ones.
@NBCNews @NBCNewYork Bad food or mental issues? Address these issues before you waste 2 more years on a Russia probe. Clean up the streets. I don't think you remember Police Chief Rizo from Phila. he took  police out of the cars and put them on the street. it worked than and would work now.
@HuffPost Better than  a want-a-be Blue Blood hiding emails, and preach women rights again what about men #metoomen
@PattiSolisDoyle @SenGillibrand All I hear is WOMEN ISSUES what about us men? Except for a few body parts in different places #metoomen.
@Reuters @michellenichols If that is a problem stop accepting after work drinks and travel in a group do your job and go home and quit the socializing scene that you put yourself into. Use common sense stop blaming everyone except yourself.
@BBCNews Lets send more money there that will fix the problem right?
@CNN @JillFilipovic @CNNOpinion The girls and CNN like it, But, Gillette stay out of politics I bet your shareholders and stakeholders are not all happy with your comments condemning men for being men and call men toxic. I have a few manly words for you but not allow to said them unless I'm a Dem congresswoman
@CNN So American Mormons paid for the real estate cost and building of the church and yet many Mormons can't even afford to travel there makes sense to me, I guess!
@cnni Competition in child abuse records? If you think you get Italians to 10% of there check to the Mormon church, I look forward to this event!
@washingtonpost Birth rates dropping because a couple don't have the financial means to have a family. BUT, BRINGING IN immigrants for low paying jobs compounded by the family they bring will drain the SS system, DSHS funds and many programs paid for with tax dollars. Explain the upside?
@MSNBC WW l &amp; ll are finished EU does trade with RUSSIA and China so why do we need NATO? Money spend better else where. it's like the Russia are going to Invade Europe which they never did. China on the other hand seeks world power still economically and Territory wise also.
@Reuters Don't you just love family when you money?
@SenWhitehouse What eats carbon dioxide? Go to Singapore and get a lesson. Plants eat it and guess what produce the needed 18% Oxygen we use? And what about the volcano under the Arctic heating from the bottom up can you stop that?
@SenBlumenthal 2 years and Muller's report might cover a paper napkin.
@globaltimesnews Does that mean no more cardboard in the beef?What about not chaining the doors of factories. Done worry China citizens we will lock up all Christians so not to influence you from the one only form of faith in China. democracy, well maybe in the 100 years. We think long term right
@lnwyd Like to read some letters from Clinton's 26 days But, wait he was to busy having sex in the oval office while men and women in the arm forces were on station and 800, 00 fed. workers not working. What about Obama have any letters I love to read.
@FallonTonight @nbc Hey Jimmy don't miss out on the murder rate of over 600 in 2018.And what about the trucks load of supplies of water and other goods left abandoned in PR. But, hey US mainlanders keep sending those checks to me.We've created a welfare state in PR  local government  doing a bad job
@AC360 @CNN @SenBlumenthal @andersoncooper 2 years show me the public proof. I only hear CNN, NYT, WP talk it up and yet no material for the public. CNN, NYT, WP enjoy the zenith of your time as you continue to boost profits not news.
@NBCNews get we get that money for the Barrier?
@rklein90 @HuffPost Again private school. Just like private clubs etc.. When you open and have money to open a PRIVATE school than do what you want. but to comment because you can't get your child in there send them to public schools and risk all the outside influences you complaint about in private
@harperbulletin @SebGorka @newsbusters @WashTimes @theMRC @RichNoyes I guess you don't listen well enough. negative has been the mass news media feeding a frenzy of negative comments which more interesting than the results mr. Trump has produced with his team. 3.3% unemployment? stock market gains, trade, international changes NK. negative right!
@blackishabc Excuse me but there are THOUSANDS OF OTHER SKIN COLORS AND RACES BESIDES BLACK IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD!

@Reuters China start putting all those empty containers of cheap products on the moon we will need throwaway items there. Anyone want to buy cottonseed options from the moon? Is that better than Hemp here on Earth, I'm so confused Moon or Earth and then there is Mars Wow!
@guardian So we have the Muslims calling us infidels, the Buddhist in Asia putting people in camps, Hindus burning churches. You know what, freedom of religion lives in America. I would band anyone from this countries when you talk about human right issues. Trading partners right!
@Reuters @ReutersTV I guess you don't know that a body needs protein for muscle growth, veggies don't cut it.
@NBCNews These are nations we give BILLIONS to and look how the puppet government handles it?
@emilyslist @SenGillibrand "Is a proven champion for women",  Excuse me what about us MEN we need health care also. We work in the weather, heavy lifting, dig ditches, steel mills, dangerous jobs which causes physical problems. You want health care because a woman does not use protection or common sense
@colbertlateshow @SenGillibrand Number one when public speaking I learnt in my occupations, speak to the audience not the show host duh!
@nytimes Do you have a poem that the homeless can eat and stay warm with. Priorities I guess when you have money to burn.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SebGorka Mr.president stand your ground. Let's hear some infrastructure news and put the wall to bed JUST DO IT! they are hassling you,well go for it because they will not change their opinions. keep fixing the problems behind the scenes. My advice go in silence and deal with new congress
@nypost Tips accepted for my wardrobe and apt. cost and can I get a bigger office now to fit my EGO?
@guardiannews When in Rome, that is there law keep your nose out of it for a drug dealer. One less on the streets of Canada killing your children.
@fleccas @SebGorka At least it was not SNL but just as bad thank goodness I don't watch this jerk. Where is Johnny Carson when late night was funny not political. For those who watch this show you will see a lot of her on there.
@latimes Average High School Teacher Yearly Salary in California. High School Teachers earn an average yearly salary of $74,940. Salaries typically start from $48,930 and go up to $101,660 and work 9 months a year, retirement package etc. and want more. learn to budget like the rest of us
@cnni Another mouth to feed because she hates her parents but loves and knows how to use Facebook well. Who is going to provide $$ and resources to her? What skills does she have? Oh! she can be a blogger on CNN, you think.
@guardian A 20 year old ex Russia jump ramp carrier is a real threat ha ha! If there weapons last as long as the cheap products with cheap labor last like a Wal-mart purchase item we nothing to worry about. besides why destroy your best customer.
@washingtonpost Why so, news media like you put your spin on their words. These are the world leaders they do need to answer to a stupid news media who only interest is profit based. You must think people outside WASH. are really stupid. We don't live in reality TV shows like you.
@NBCNews Hand them out in DC on the March. But people are lazy when it comes to doing the proper act sometimes. it won't match my makeup or cloths.
@SenGillibrand That will funny seeing you refuse PAC money hahahahahahahahah!
@SebGorka Why is it nobody talks about the natural volcano under the Arctic  melting the ice from the bottom up. Yosemite park and worlds largest most dangerous of volcano activity. Oh! the shifting of the planets axis over the years which is natural. I never should of learn science
@CNNPolitics Government workers will get back paid be real in your words. And for the rest of the USA with a 3.35 unemployment rate they are happy! factory shutdowns have nothing to do with government its the shareholders and stake owners, you know all about that right CNN?
@Forbes Again redirect this hint to the new Democratic party especially the new congresswoman who called my president a MF.
@nytimes 4 weeks shutdown and "LONG term research projects are at risk".4 weeks, long term doesn't sound right to me. Clinton did 26 days and the world and long term projects did not suffer. What makes this different? Oh! its the haters of Mr. Trump.Where was that objection for Obama time
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @SenWhitehouse I love it 2 years and "IF" crimes were committed. 2 years, sounds like the investigators should be investigated to find out how much money they have wasted from the taxpayers only to feed the news media system telling the same story for 2 years huh!
@TIME Of course 30 Democrats in PR with 109 lobbyist free holiday with family and sucking up to big business who pledges to invest in inner city programs and give money for social projects, right!
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The only good news but will never happen is the Honduran government said it will arrest people who drag children North. Lets see what Mexico does this time. The longer they sit in Mexico they might think twice before heading North.
@HuffPost You have it backwards as the media tries to find new  dirt to sell more air time stocks you scramble with this story . Only your viewer base would believe this fabrication, I guess when you live in the city and inhale subway fumes all day your mind gets a little cloudy.
@AC360 @CNN @JimClyburnSC @andersoncooper Hello AC, what about the new democrat congresswoman who called the president a MF, should she not be removed? or does your views from CNN dictate bias. She did not regret it so why should he.
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @ChrisCuomo Like the Congresswoman who called the president a MF, You are so one sided Cuomo. You speak well but what comes out of your mouth is nothing short of disgusting. hands off the Dem's they do no wrong in your blinded eyes.
@washingtonpost Private school why not? Some of us don't wish to be main stream so stop pushing it down our throats. You have your way and so we who wish not to acknowledge these trends can and will do so, freedom of choice works in both direction.
@HuffPost Again, unions take monthly dues for the workers. last time I was in a union they provided funds from dues paid during a strike. What is this union problem or better yet where is the money?
@LoraineLena Right its a choice or being careless and who suffers the child, parents, the social society systems, taxpayers. have sex responsibly.!
@honeyxpie @GOP Back to the days of cloths hangers and backseats of cars I guess. Until people take responsibility for their actions there will always be this situation. And excuse me what did OBAMA DO IN 8 YEARS? Bias, where was your objections then?
@ScottNeumann12 Buy CONDOMS!
@SJCRTL No your irresponsible behavior has caused 1/4 of lives to be finished because you did practice birth control methods. Those tequila nights are expensive aren't they?
@SenatorWicker Teach the new youth to keep their pants on and legs closed girls!
@SenToddYoung Sounds great what do you do with the illegal immigrants who have children in the US just for the benefits. Try to focus on one major issue of the day right now. Abortion has been a political storm for decades and not going any where. Fix the big problems that effect the 325m
@JimInhofe Government shutdown, LA teachers and now #MarchForLife on DC when resources being push to the limits. I agree abortion is terrible. But, people Men and Women need to learn birth control methods better. Safe sex, not killing, child support payments, custody battles etc.
@Reuters @Breakingviews @AntonyMCurrie Ford was handed Volkswagen after WW ll and declined now finally working with them. I guess it takes over 70 years to learn a lesson?
@MattBockhorst You million dollar paycheck and you complain about the burgers. Again no one said thank Mr. Trump. You young people expect to much for such little you contribute to society. leader of men who are only concern the money their agents can get for them like a piece of meat.
@Reuters Venezuela is at a boiling  point the US government should back off. It's going to happen there let it happen naturally. if we polk our noses in there they we will be drawn in and that will cost us billions, back off and see what happens by itself.
@rcbl Your just jealous you were not invited.
@silviakillings Some of favorite food and they didn't have to pull up to the 5th window and wait 15 minutes for their burgers. Good job Mr.President
@RepMarkMeadows To busy in PR with the 109 lobbyist funny, don't hear much about that on CNN, NYT, WP huh! I guess the good old boys club for the Democrats is OK but not for Republicans. Bias maybe? Nay! democrats or CNN, NYT, WP would never be bias right?
@BenWeiserNYT @JoeKGoldstein @richoppel Misssed meals saves money and for the POOR lawyers who can't bill their clients so sad for them. Wait, people in prison for crimes in a hurry to burden the courts, I think this is a nice cooling your heels period, relax, i know when the vending machine doesn't have any snickers.
@RT_com LA teachers are you watching. You said that Mr. Trump is holding the government hostage but what about you LA teachers, are you not doing the same and you time it during the government shutdown to add to the problems of the nation. glad none of you were my teachers, sad.
@TIME First they to learn language skills and should know the law and how government works which I learnt in 7 grade which seems to elude them in the democrat side of the newbies. Diverse or street kids playing grown-ups that effect my life. Save the world, they such of started at home
@washingtonpost He try to do something cool and simple and the late want-a-be comedians try to humiliate him, sorry it was a fun simple act and the media just like to sell more air time. Anybody bother to see the stock prices of CNN and others like the NYT, WP. sad way to make profit.
@HuffPost Oh! What about the mouth of the Congresswoman who called our president a MF, that's acceptable #metoo movement. Girls look in the mirror it takes two to Tango just asked the women in prison on drug charges, killing their children, check fraud, prostitution etc.. No Angels!
@CNN You cluster all men as toxic masculinity and you know why I divorced because my wife was not only verbally abusive but physical.Gillette keep your business on business not thrashing men. I for one now will buy another product even if is from China, tired of being slammed as a man
@TIME I think more that a metal detector or x-ray machine.#2 all back packs are left outside only visible books or supplies can enter school under a watchful eye. sad it comes to that but young people cause this situation themselves now deal with it. As they age they learn security.

@GPCAHunger @HelenGymAtLarge @marygayscanlon Is that why Phila ship yards don't build ships and Camden NJ over the bridge is one of the most dangerous places in America?
@HelenGymAtLarge i was borne in South Phila. and after 50 years it still hasn't changed, Your full of shit!

@HuffPost Bo-Ho!
@Independent Anyone who watches cartons to interpret life is more stupid they the cartoon.
@WAStateGov @GovInslee As long as the state of Washington pays the bill.
@Independent You really don't understand that women in that region try to remain white skin.

@brenda7nv7 Hi Brenda, just an old dude living in Southeast Asia,
A kindergartner brought a handgun and ammunition to school https://t.co/EBtcPPz6Q9 As I suggested before an electronic finger ID for the trigger would be a safe guard to avoid a discharge by a child or unauthorized person of the weapon. Still be sales but a added safety feature.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Won't see videos of that meeting with 109 lobbyist, who is paying the bills. It takes 30 Democrats to look at disaster relief in PR. How about the violence on an island that spends Millions of mainland money and has has so many problems, crime, drugs shortages Fire them all!
@nytimes Over 600 killed in 2018. They want and need disaster relief yes from BULLETS. Call me stupid but how do the bullets arrive on the Island? Control that and it might be a good start. You see we have the problems on PR and Dem's want more illegals with the same problems.
@HuffPost She wishes for the wealthy to be taxed to support inequality and yet each person can succeed if they choose to complete an education etc... She wants change for equal lifestyles earn it! Change the culture of those who choose not to succeed first and then provide assistance.
https://t.co/FxkFigjv7f She does realize this is not Sweden of 9.9m people and US is 325m and very diverse of cultures and she would take that 70% collected and give to another favorite country of hers?
@Forbes I hope this course was mandatory for the new DEM. congressional party because they could use a few pointers in public speaking not bar dialog. Just locker room talk Dem's?
@NPR Documents most probably have been exchanged and the bank knows the situation  and knows once back to work the income is there and still there with back pay coming. People look for months for a home now its a CRISES! I need those 4 walls and a garage NOW!!!!
@RT_com Can't feed the people, depend on some foreign aid but can come up with 1 million dollars cash huh! Do the citizens not realize how their own leadership is not focus on a plan to benefit all parties.
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Don't understand her fixation with tax structure of Sweden of 9.9 m people with a low ratio of diverse cultures and compare a system of checks and balances of 350 m US of diverse societies and needs. See knows nothing of Micro/Macro economics and balance a check book.
@nypost That's fine he is a private citizen not an elected official to represent voters.
@CNN Not as bad as a video games shooting the heck of human beings and fellow students or office co-workers is it. Or shoot the crap out of a military or police officer on your 50 inch TV.
@MSNBC When you live in a inter-city environment and don't own a car or every driven and subways and local clubs of all sorts and Facebook and CNN are the only form of external distractions from the cubical then yes, you would of watched the Dem's more and checked your wallets.
@HuffPost How by having to hire more police officers to control the influx of numbers of people hard to account for or replace GOD rest they souls the officers gunned down and you believe the situation of ALL illegals not race but all individua here illegally makes us safer, OK????????????
@BillOReilly I agree, as more people are pissed or peaked of interest I believe they look at many forms of media especially people like myself overseas. CNN has lost the ability to report news and has become a whipping apparatus to a certain tone of a political party and think they're better.
@brenda7nv7 I disagree, the world could be view cold when the hard work and challenges of being a single parent and business owner can sometimes cloud the view. But, past dark clouds is always sunshine waiting, you just have to believe! It's a tough world but not without a heart!
@NPR Sorry, you'll get your back pay as most federal employees are paid a set monthly salary not an hourly wage. The hourly workers will feel the pinch the worst. So, go to work and do your job and you will be backed paid. Sit home and protest probably won't help.
@washingtonpost Obama put post in with the idea of stopping vehicles and a wire fence about 4feet tall. Check your facts about what type of barrier, Obama, Bush did. They started to erect proper barriers and Mr. Trump just wishes to finish it to seal the border and enforce proper entry.
@MSNBC 63% at airports, what about the other 37% coming by land. I guess I must be the only person reading the CBP web site stats?
'El Chapo' trial: Drug kingpin’s 'secretary' testifies against him https://t.co/DZy3W1Z8Xs You want to know a real need for a wall speak to El Chapo, if anyone knows about the border it would be him correct?
Amid border wall debate, third drug tunnel found in less than a month along Arizona border https://t.co/EdPSl2DzVP A new high tech barrier besides the height is that a vibration sensor system like detecting earth movements can be part of the early warning system to alert an area,
@WSJ So much with dealing with a progressive country like China ha-ha! Advise; Don't stand in front of any moving tanks or government vehicles. Taiwan by force, Tibet, artificial islands with military equipment in place, NK ear huh! Tough, trust the Russians, Arabs, Chinese. I go Arab
@nytimes And you highlight the US shutdown when the employees and contractors and all involved will receive back pay as signed into law . Stop making sound worst then it is. No big story when unemployment was 5-6% or in the real world many CITIES are facing 15%-30% unemployment now
@CGTNOfficial That's Asia!
@nypost Democrats, it's a party, got my check enough for a 6 pack and Tesla. Suckers who voted for me and thank you AA and all my buddies there for voting for me Cheers!
@NBCNews The news media highlights that that USDA/FDA shutdown causes health concerns. I stated that in house health inspector employees aka; Production manager/supervisor do it. I said that food issues are after the delivery of poor handling by employees or stowage/refrig etc...
@cnni @CNNOpinion Didn't have thousands of people willing o travel thousands of miles to utilize another territories resources, I've around the world and seen such walls of history and your wrong they worked to control what comes in and what goes out. To govern as a collective society not invaders
@RT_com With over a Billion people there has to be money floating around in their pockets,
@HuffPost December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, for 5 and 21 days That's 26 days in the same period by Clinton.
@SenCoryGardner I worry about the drugs, gang problems in state. the trees aren't going anywhere soon and park rangers are on the front lines. Cleanup the snow and i don't mean from the North Pole.Apr 4, 2018 - Colorado drug deaths almost certainly were the worst in the state's history last year
@HuffPost That's a law suit that should happen because it is a malicious act and even worst employed by the media and cost to discredit Mr. Trump is an insult to the state of Washington whose liberal views seem to take it to extremes such as new congresswomen  using MF etc..
@MSNBC Was or IS a Russian spy, Democrats, are you serious? What's next he's alien sent to disrupt the planet!!!! 2 years busting this guys Balls and nothing that is a waste of money. I hope Muller isn't getting his salary.
@SteveScalise @Wisechoice_01 @realDonaldTrump Everyone in Congress should have their pay and perks removed until they sit down like nice boys and girls and stop screwing with the average persons life. it's just not the Republicans but the Democrats weren't there at holidays and now walk off on the weekend who is the bad guys
@BorderMayor @Wisechoice_01 @RepDanCrenshaw @WSJ Mr. Crenshaw will be a positive representative in Congress for the US. Dedication to duty and honor is something he stands for.
@Wisechoice_01 And lets not stop it from coming across the border , who needs a wall when you have such thinking to provide services for junkies like a Starbucks, which employees asked for that in San Francisco. What has America become?
@Wisechoice_01 Fair enough but earning those benefits rather than sitting at home the person if able should do some sort of community work until they find pull time/part time employment. Being lazy and getting assistance from tax payers is not a lot to ask. otherwise maybe the immigrants can do
@latimes $4 billion and yet we give 33 billion to Egypt each year plus several other countries Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Jordon, Columbia etc. over 120 billion a year to these countries who provide no assets to us. Rebuild our country, secure borders,curve crime, affordable housing

@cnni That's going to far,if you every done Mushrooms well it would replace the Coke thing but create another problem.420 is enough to appease the masses don't push the hard job of law enforcement or create more hazards on the road. Be satisfied with that. Everything in moderation best
@thebradfordfile @SebGorka Don't understand why Nigeria or South Africa gets money since their economies produce money. Nigeria with oil reserves and South Africa framers mostly White. The other countries are a waste of our tax dollars and have never given anything back. Plus Egypt's military cost.
@nytimes Clinton 26 days
@RT_com That's a natural occurrence its just that its in our life time, picture 5000 years ago when humans saw the earth change before their eyes too.
@nprpolitics Clinton 26 days get it right for once.
@CNN Beyond the call of duty or a person who displayed humanitarian instincts which i wish more people in America would have rather than turn a blind eye.Which means letting their neighborhoods&amp; community be overtaken by gangs and bad influences.The government can't fight every battle
@HuffPost Clinton 26 days get it right.
@AP Again for your lack of stupid research dept. Clinton 26 days, get it right liars!!!!
@11thHour @MSNBC @nytimes @jmeacham A real estate mogul now president working for the Russians? Well, they didn't do such a good job investing in Atlantic  City. I see Trumps name on a building without the Russian flag going. His wife is not Russian. Eats McDonald's not borscht soup. huh! sounds like a spy to me!!!
@c_m_dangelo @HuffPost 12 billion park budget? Where does that $5-$40 dollar entrance money go? Not counting concession stands and souvenirs monies. I've been in business and 12 billion sounds like a lot for a park system yearly that generates a revenue per entrance?? So, divert down time to the Wall$
@CNN Nothing to do with the shutdown, They are animals to begin with the Gen X or just F***ed -up individuals no matter what given the chance and probably one of those graffiti  types and thinks its funny to destroy public and private property. Don't every let me catch one in the act!
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @RepAnthonyBrown I guess it could of been said about Lincoln as a Republican who signed the proclamation about slavery against all odds to move the country forward. If a barrier is not built now it is and will be needed more in the future and cost more. Do it now, it will stand for 50 years .
A new migrant caravan is forming in Central America, with plans to leave next week https://t.co/kfbF8NI1aq Another group of spineless citizens fleeing when their numbers are larger than the criminals they claim. And yet no standing up to the government of there country
@RT_com We in the states haven't come to that level yet except when there is a WTO meeting haha!
@USATODAY If this situation can be enforced than why all the fuss over women with Mr. Trump decades before he became President. Seems a bit unfair don't you think. I guess 30 million would close my mouth with a big smile and a very large yacht.
@NBCNews Such a scare tactic to the public because in house safety inspectors are there etc.. from vegs to meat packing. Most problems come from after delivery to the stores and mishandling/stowage of products from employees. The factories are the monitored by professionals on staff.
@MSNBC It took the threats of Mr. trump for Americans and businesses like in the older days to start acting like Americans supporting the community . That is the fabric of our society, But lesson learnt that the government is not always the provider. Its the people who make America work
Exasperated Democrats try to rein in Ocasio-Cortez https://t.co/pWVyCSPuNX	I bet she knows how to pour a good beer might come in handy at her rallies she speak up with no message 2m followers of what a angry NYC girl who thinks she can fix the worlds problem but don't hear plans
@bennyjohnson @BullinsClaude @BoKnowsNews She is  going to have fun time in Congress getting anyone to take her seriously.
@charliekirk11 @BullinsClaude I don't think we'll have to wait that long on Ginsberg!
@Lrihendry @BullinsClaude Well she did use a page of the constitution which is better than the KORAN which states the policy of hate for Infidels. The Democrats are a mixed bag of nuts and I do mean NUTS. No one new member has said anything productive like Nancy the hen mother must approve first?
@Jenn198523 @BullinsClaude Young Democrats have a short member also CNN doesn't have the guts to show that not now or be reminded. What goes around comes around it will come back to bit her in the ass sometime in government.
@RealJamesWoods @BullinsClaude Kids playing grown-us.
@Jenn198523 @BullinsClaude That's what all dirty old men say and they hope to get away with it. Look at Mr. Bush in a wheelchair grasping asses.
@HjRockwell @BullinsClaude @cnnbrk Bullseyes!
@dcskins65743 @BullinsClaude @CNN I guess like the peace corp faded but give free money to foreign countries with no buddy on the ground. Kennedy was smart Peace Corps provided needed care and assistance and control; flow of resources but today's' Americas can't get that cell phone and Facebook off
@MSNBC @WillieGeist Jump to 1995–1996 (26 days)  The government shut down after Clinton vetoed the spending bill It is likely this administration will set a new record when the impasse hits 22 days this Sunday and  medias report Clinton's as 21 days How to believe such misinformation from media.
@Tim_Canova @BullinsClaude Shouldn't she be relaxing and collecting Social Security or is there money to be made tampering?
@DPohocsucut @BullinsClaude @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Nice sense of humor if you get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did.
@TheUncensoredT1 @BullinsClaude @MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Funny how many people put there foot in their mouth and yet does not follow the same cause she said leading a charge or just be disruptive in Congress? Money talks and Bullshit walks! She to busy shopping at Macy's in the city.
@MSNBC Pinocchio has nothing on you to compare a 2004 motivation speech to say don't let obstacles stop you with your UNIVERSITY EDUCATION and a bright future never quit. However immigrants with children in tow and seniors with min. skills does not mean to climb our wall for salivation
@nytimes Makes you wonder a city 80% Hispanic saying no wall, no crime in their city, no drugs or gun fights. Seems that a safe passage through this border city with open spaces has no problems huh? Funny, when  shootings/drugs happens in other other border towns why not here mayor?
@cnni One more frustrated teenager who hates her parents who won't let her use Facebook, whats-up, snap-chat and all of those social media outlets that do the thinking for you rather than think for yourself.
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Threatened by her are you kidding. A loud mouth girl from the Northeast with an educational background but a pure city girl who complain she had nothing to wear for her new job or cried poor looking for an apartment, yet as a waitress in NYC the tips are more than today's salary.
@Reuters @davidshepardson Just make sure you build it in America!
Joshua Tree National Park has been trashed in the shutdown. Now visitors are cutting down trees. https://t.co/nH2LVcLIPx Are these the same indivuals who protest Climate Change, WTO, Globalization, yellow shirts in France, and shoot each other in clubs. the leaders of tomorrow?
Joshua Tree National Park has been trashed in the shutdown. Now visitors are cutting down trees. https://t.co/nH2LVcLIPx A government shutdown is no excuse for today's young people who do this type of damage it's a culture of their time which seems to just pissed away on youth.
President Trump Went to a Border Town to Prove They Need a Wall. Residents Say Otherwise https://t.co/X8Uatizd83 Of course his city of 150.000 is safe the illegal immigrants don't wish to draw attention at the border town but take their business North otherwise busted in Town.
@guardian I'm 62 and tap about 20 different news medias around the world. I'm university educated and started using the Sinclair  and Tandy's and Mac before you were borne. You right older folks take time to filter through the bullshit some medias puts out. But we have all day.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Is that big enough to hold the amount of drugs that come across our southern border. If thee was no problems years ago and growing why do we thousands of people there?
@USATODAY It's a coffee house not a social services dept of the government. The legal liability of the cleaning crew or others to come in contact with these throw a ways. What neighborhood are these stores in. Sell your stocks quick and switch to drinking tea at home and save money
@CNNPolitics Only 8 more to go to set the 27 day recorded by Clinton and Dem's oh the 5 days to small potatoes by the Dem's but the Obama was just 16 days for Dem's .16 +5+27= 48 days the Democratic party deprived 800,000 federal salaries to Reagan and Bush severall days and over a weekend,
@NBCNews How many areas in place have this breach type. #1 as a trained welder I see what looks like melted metal black burns areas from a cutting torch but if by a saw your talking a power saw if a hand saw they should market it and never need to come to the US. Great Saw$$, you think?
@TIME I guess free shipping and return policies will change, quick after divorce buy all the empty Sears and Kmart's stores and warehouses and as you grow you'll need cheap space. Don't tear them down make a dormitory environment and use to shops as necessary employee housing etc..
@cnni Every dog has it's day and power and fame don't last forever is time is almost enough for the people to really do something.
@MSNBC And the funds are for F.E.M.A. a Federal Dept. that controls fund allocation under their guidelines. So, when Calif. needs and has gotten FEMA assistance it's need federal not as stated taking funds from the Golden State, key word State not federal stop mixing apples and oranges
@MSNBC Love the spin, this is not a Murphy Brown TV show,insulting firefighters no, questioning forest management practices  we know it happens all the time unlike the wall idea a better use of manpower to clear and manage forest growth with the fees taken, budgets etc. needs reviewing
@RT_com Just shows you Money does not promise a long term relationship or health look at Mr. Paul Allen, Steven Jobs. Feel sad for the guy really, now more than ever I bet all the fake friends will come out of the woodwork to give advice?
For a real-world example of Ocasio-Cortez’s tax proposal, look to Sweden https://t.co/hHGxaOwvbf Sweden 9.9 million people total. USA 325 million people. The USA also has millions undocumented. Culture classes are different, education, now she 's economist????
@RT_com RT I thought you were better than that. The list was for EMPLOYEES OF THE COAST GUARD not the CG's themselves. I hope your not taking lessons from CNN on reporting incorrect info are you???? Disappointed!
@CNN @KamalaHarris Again Clinton did 27 days did CNN cry like this then Boo who! You know how to twist words but don't report a fair comparison to others shutdowns. Obama 16 days and Clinton 2 times one time 27 days. I don't see any comparison reporting. Fake news. I have other words for you suits.
@NBCNews This guy is just coming out of the shadows of history family history. hes been a playboy so he knows somewhat of a western culture. But the Chinese courts him and influence him. I hope he is wise enough to make a good choice or be another Taiwan or Hong Kong example of control?
@MSNBC TV ratings just exactly what the Mass Media is all about not the real issues. Picking sides with personal views. using position to form bias and your clueless on data. Check; CBP stats, Major city crime drug rates ( where do the drugs come from), Social services costs etc...
@HuffPost I suggest you spend time reading the CBP web site for stats. Also google which cites have the highest drug driven crime rate. Poverty levels and homeless not to mention those on welfare programs. Tally up that data and decide the ? Fix the US first of some of it problems,
@NBCNews That's the bulk so if some come through the southern border that is an acceptable figure but doesn't count in stopping drugs hitting our streets huh! And the other illegal activities happening in the spaces of our southern territory is acceptable to your version of secure borders
@HuffPost Yea, he's a rude SOB.
@MSNBC If she can be passionate and upset and not apologize why can't Mr. Trump who never held office before be held accountable for being upset and passionate also without having to apologize like her. rather bias thinking. Do what I say not what I do motto of hers?
@HuffPost the nationwide opioid epidemic, drug abuse issues vary across the  country, with the District of Columbia ranking No. 1 for drug problems,  according to a WalletHub analysis. Now it seems the cities and now suburbs has a drug problem which includes drugs coming into our borders
@greggutfeld Just love those arm chair news reporters who vast knowledge of internal politics, social dramatics, relates to the common man ( I don't live in a gated community or arm guard in a condo area), Fortune telling seems to work well with the CNN base who sadly believes them??????
@cnni @TimListerCNN Can't change the Ideology but to remove the logistical system of weapons, supplies and finance that is a start. No bullets makes it hard to win in a fight. No money means not fuel to engage, produce propaganda material etc.. Support the average citizen after ISIL lose face within
@AP That's how China handles immigration issues and states to regain Taiwan by force as necessary.And yet we want to build a barrier on the southern border to be able to funnel people seeking asylum to enter at proper check points not trekking across the desert risking certain death
@CNN They dealt with under Clinton for 27 days and its only been 18 days. Also, shows Americans do not save money as do other societies do. It 18 days impact them now how would be prepared for other emergencies . And do not union dues paid and the union provides a % of income
@MSNBC They need that type of voice in Central America and if didn't get shot or put in prison she help to reform those countries. But to suggest the USA has a morale or financial accountable to help these who don't follow the legal law and the ones who do get delayed further.
@HuffPost If they smiled any harder their lips would crack. Don't understand what they can't see the picture or problem aka; crisis,tons of illegal drugs causing USA to have a big problem.other items, human trafficking. Depleted social services for our current citizens to allow immigrants
@SenatorBaldwin Indirectly when the tons of drugs and other illegal items are hampered by a physical barrier. Dem's say it comes in ships mostly, check the CBP web net data and see the stats from the southern border which happens every day but never makes into the news. Facts ARE facts.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes, some people don't like to hear about peoples lives not connected to them. Only the media likes to report the story but don't like a real reference until it happens to them. And your CBP data I read myself on the net, CNN should use Google more instead of armchair reporting.
@SenatorDurbin What's the drug problem like in your state and how many undocumented people use your social services there? Your unemployment and crime rate.
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS @senatemajldr Tell that to the OD people of family and friends why we can't stop the drug trade or gun trade or the human trafficking. i agree New Mexico is no the market for drugs or illegal guns and human trafficking that goes to places like NYC, Chicago, L.A. etc.. all the Blue  states.
@CNNPolitics And the folks you poll are usually inter-city democrats who ilive n places like NYC which they don't have to deal or have working knowledge of the full situation. Try reviewing the CBC  web pages with their stats.
@CNN They fired him why not fire the new elected congresswoman who called the president a MF in the halls of congress while in her new position.
Complaints prompt Amazon to remove products that are offensive to Muslims https://t.co/c49xFtO5cP Who ever the market direct was for these products did not do research on this faith.I'm not Muslim but got to support the idea,You don't see door mats of the US flag to wipe feet
@MSNBC If the president called the Democratic Congress all MF's what and how would you react on live TV broadcast around the country and international news medias. You talk about separating genders your a driving force behind a he/she battle not politics for the masses.
@MSNBC Yes you have DEM's from Mr. Trumps comments prior to being president, the #metoo movement. So, your comparing what happen years ago with Mr. Trump to a newly elected representative of the people in the halls of congress and children present to call the president a MF?
@missoulian @SteveDaines @Interior May 17, 2018  The latter park, home to the mighty Grand Teton and other rugged peaks, also charges $35  for entrance, effective June 1, 2018. Those traveling by motorcycle will  pay $30 for a seven-day pass, effective June 1, 2018. how are these fees used and where is the surplus
@JulieRiggs363 It's the 21st century and yes,leaders of these countries that are corrupt know how the milk the system from the west and totalitarian power remains with them. Stop feeding the hands of the criminal and the corruption should go down. And maybe modern practices will help the people
@Cameron_Gray @JulieRiggs363 The young elected officials already have a personal bone to pick with the WH but yet haven't seen any presentation of  mature women capable of making decisions for the masses. Congress is not a Sorority House or Animal House for grudging and the language of the new congress!!!!
@DanCrenshawTX @JulieRiggs363 Thakyou Mr. Crenshaw, well put about the verbal attacks on the citizens who don't live in concrete jungles and don't enjoy,CNN and other media platforms to report or satire news from the WH but never the positive gains. But, can you get the president to talk about infrastructure.
@SenSchumer Like Bush gets high points for Katrina. President  70%, faulted President George W. Bush and the  Federal Government for their handling of the problem, while 58% and 53%  blamed Governor Blanco and Mayor Nagin respectively.
@CNN Only a dozen but, was not about the same involved in 911? Caught at the border and think if we had more secure barriers forcing them to attempt at check point gates along the border we could catch more and NOT RELEASE. security barriers work as a mental and physical barrier.
@NBCNews Would not local government which should have a natural disaster panel doing a job from their federal dollars received. Who does the budget for Puerto Rico, Before your make comments about the federal government investigate what the local government did right and wrong.
@TIME During the Barack Obama administration, a 16-day government shutdown occurred during October 2013. Which Mr. trump's is the second longest not the third.
@TIME Get it right Clinton 27 days, Obama 16 days. Young people calling them self reports haven't learn to research on the internet yet. get facts right to your readers and report correctly for once.
@PatriciaMazzei @nytimes You also had prisoners so, like a work detail in the military you use some them to help clean and repair.hire a roofing company and use the prisoners to train them and pay the federal wage $ 7.45?better than a roofing company with illegals. Hire the local Voc/tech school teachers
@nytimes former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama deployed the  Guard to the border in 2006 &amp; 2010,pushing Congress to pass  overhauls of immigration policy. Both overhauls failed. A  2011 government review estimated the Bush and Obama deployments cost at  least $1.3 billion.
‘It’s Just Too Much’: A Florida Town Grapples With a Shutdown After a Hurricane https://t.co/m6JP8xBdAg are the types of issues to be address. i assumed the warden and council are doing the paperwork for re-opening a federal prison with needed funds
@CNNDonLemon Your suggestion of delay feed of Mr. Trump so you can jump in to be a distraction with your personal  views. If Mr. Trump puts his foot in mouth so be it. But suggest delay sounds like CENSORSHIP and our FIRST AMENDMENT? which is what you enjoy, correct?
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Clinton shut down the government for 27 days why do a story of the impact then to the impact today. And Obama with Billions of bailout for auto makers(shareholders), and banks at what cost to tax payers, And you complain about 5b for border security, crazy. Do a fair comparison
@NBCNews Just easier to have reporters take bits &amp;pieces of his address an twist news to fit their personal spin on his words rather than have the public hear it directly.Mass media ripping into the showdown over immigration and you don't wish to air it.But half time of a football game is
@globaltimesnews China still remembers what Japan did to their country in 1939. And Chinese like to hold grudges. But the rest of the world moved on so has Japan. But,if China continues its expansion ideas;  Building Islands. Taiwan.Retraining Buddhist in camps, right!! Exploit workers low wages?
@Independent it's OK for Hollywood that foul language is a norm in films and they have no imagination just repeating the nightly news, boring and for $20 cost. When Johnson does a film RAMPAGE ? A gorilla gives the finger and another gesture for sex at the end of the film. Great PG FOR KIDS
@Reuters China cuts allowance on Imports. Good idea maybe we should try the same America. But,if we  divert need of cheap imports why no invest in our Southern Neighbors. I'm talking South America I think they can produce what we use from dollar stores, Wal-Mart, cheap electronics,medical
@PattyMurray I lived in WA. for 20 years and knew to many single mothers who work the DSHS and system and families. They provide services for none US citizens where the average DSHS has several translators on staff. They know where and how to get meds if they need it. No ACA? Its mandatory.
@HuffPost I think a YouTube video would of worked just as well, say a NG series on animal survival. The frog was one think but dinner time for the turtle and Puppy Chow could of been done in private.
@SenCoryGardner You worry about Trump,this guys has a Billion people to boss around and is everything that is a island belong to China;Taiwan, North Korea, islands off the coast of Nam, PI Or his tourist island with the missiles for protection from pirates. He still has his Wall as a backup plan
@Independent I watched the clip was this a joke or why was he ejected, what did said or do. No  text story with clip but it is called Culture News
@TIME Wait Ex-federal cons in Fla. regain the right to vote but also have one think USA citizens mostly and have ID's. So, during census asking for proof of citizenship should be required. Need ID to drive, get bank loans, credit card use, library, stay in a hotel etc.. PONY UP ID"S.
@TIME Fell in love with a Russian woman on holiday, cut his spending allowance and see how long the Russian stays around. Home he paid the hotel bill and jewelry bill. other blue bloods married different women like an actress and such. It must the in thing to do these days!
@CNNPolitics I would think her STATS would be more reliable than senators whose asses are sitting in D.C. Did forgo salaries, still limos for some, lunch room? 12 million$$$ new day care center. let the immigrants camp in Congress, they are not using it. Pool open, free wi-fi, gym wow!
San Francisco prices are so out of control that one hotel is charging the equivalent of $21.25 for a cup of coffee during a JPMorgan conference https://t.co/ZZdEaPbE3g $21.25 is crazy but able pay and even high salaries don't stop penny pinching. Find a new hotel, save$$$$$$
Rachel Dolezal gets trial date for welfare fraud case https://t.co/w4OYPjR1Sb	Those are gaps to fix in computer and human input to systems for benifits like SNAP, welfare and others. Hey Warren you should hook up you have claims that common, how much does Warren earn.
@macrockets Lucky to afford them and produce enough for charging also. Better if you extra power to sell to a neighbor not the grid.
Park Service takes ‘extraordinary step’ of dipping into entrance fees to bolster operations at popular sites https://t.co/bzhqhM2zzb The Dem. senators condemn the use of Park Fees which is used to SERVICE VISITORS and those individuals do what it takes.
@Reuters @patpichatan Here is a example a rights group, who's paying for the hotel, food etc... and yet many Thai's live on the streets like in America. They help a handful stabilize but what about the 500,000 homeless and millions on welfare, Where is their support, jobs, shelter, car, food etc...
@neeratanden Why all the fuss, no one raise such a stink when Clinton show down the government for 27 days. But allow thousands of unskilled immigrants across to utilized our services cost more than government shutdown does in the long term. But you young folks sucking up to kid voters
@washingtonpost Does see know she is in Thailand, refugee status in Thailand? I live here as an America and the visa rules requirements are a pain in the butt and you need to have a good income. Should of made a direct flight to Canada or the US better chance. No free stuff here like the West.
@brianschatz Maybe and a special prize a job in Congress, what do you think? Stop all that hot air coming out of politicians mouths and you would have a positive impact on global warming.
@HuffPost @aimeeallison Our culture has changed drastically in past 2 decades and she is a product of that but to change the foundation of government and not follow rules that work she just wishes to bend the system to suit her. No practical knowledge of the world and its impact outside US borders.
Trump Offers a ‘Steel Barrier,’ but Democrats Are Unmoved https://t.co/B7U0Ex8TMS Check your facts Clinton did 27 days as a record to beat for a shutdown. Also check your figures how much Obama and Clinton spent on border fencing and returned immigrants during  time in office
Migrants’ Despair Is Growing at U.S. Border. So Are Smugglers’ Profits. https://t.co/dq7tqiT1vn You cry crime, poor and yet somehow people find 4,000-7,000 usd to pay. that's over 500usd which is more salary for a month than China or Thailand's.
@RT_com Preexisting conditions Dem's or a society losing the drive for exercise and fun which helps to avoid diseases like a heart attack which the person in the video won't live long enough to enjoy other than for the hospital bills. But Obama will pay or I mean he taxpayers will.
@nytimesworld @nytimes Endangered fish $3m to be served for dinner. Funny, In Wash. state when fishing no barb hooks for salmon if caught they take your boat, gear, fines etc.. But in Japan its legal to capture and eat this species if you have the $$$ I hope there is no Eagles there for them to kill.
@CNNPolitics The message she put across is a person hot temper, rude, foul mouth and this is the representation of women in the new congress. If you watch the video she also starts with word Son of a Bitch besides saying MF. She has leadership skills, Pelosi is now den mother to the newbies
@HuffPost A bit bias don't you think, calling someone stupid, no brains, loser etc.. is not nice and Mr. Trump has used such language but, to used the words MotherF***er in public and children present and you compare that action to Mr.Trump.The old Trump tapes do not apply as not the Pres.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. President how about phasing it as " Security is Coming Back", the wall paints a picture like a prison wall. But to say security is coming regardless of the physical material. So sell the security view but modify the use of wall sir,
@seanhannity Read the article but did not hear the words give my salary like the President has been doing and continues.I guess for her ' Money talks and Bu*****t walks.Still paying off the the debt from Boston Ms. Corte Masto? I guess being a waitress you were not very good at it in the city
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Democrats have supported billions of dollars in funding for physical  barriers. In 2006, the Secure Fence Act passed with bipartisan support.Enjoy your gated community and home security system why do you need one?
@Independent Boston University a leading private research institution with two primary campuses in the heart of Boston and programs around the world.Went to a private University in Boston and said that she had no money for a wardrobe and cry's street smart,sorry don't think so,to clever NOT!
@RT_com Reminds me of a Star Trek show where Kirk dies!
@MSNBC She is just sucking up to women and telling she can change the past and the present day can correct the past! Dream on and wasting time in the past! Young people want change than just do it and stop with the past crap! It's 2019, her makeup must crack when she lies.
@MSNBC Redress old issues when there many more current to the culture base. Reviewing OLD  school lessons not many were successful but changed happen when to recognize the change of the culture. can repay or relive yesterdays, Focus on the 21s century on all issues. History is cool but!
@Independent Yea, Like Bill Clinton never inhaled and had sex in the oval office. It must of been when he shut down the government for 27 days so not so many eyes on him. I see that that her college days prepared her well to screw up my future in the system. College dropouts please apply.
@nypost And doesn't smile, were the nails a bonus! Ego's go figure.
@nprpolitics Some points are valid but why now when you have had a Democrat President in office what 16 years and now a Republican and want to jam up the system. This should of been done decades ago but now the DEM's use the back door policy, First Act you had decades!!!!
@cnni Remember what goes around comes around!
@RT_com Boy. your funny to think this would work in South East Asia. maybe in the Western cultures of who is present or those suspended or have issues maybe. I live here an was a teacher and an American, your funny ARM CHAIR POLITICIANS .
@CNN Yes, 2 terms 6 years each is fair to remain up to date with the society at that time.
@HuffPost She needs to learn about the-family support system for military and the federal people have which they pay dues and of course the back pay they will receive. Again Clinton went 27 days, Obama went 16 days both Democrats. I'm ex military please they have internal support.
@MSNBC Yea, and the speaking coach you want to express the real push of emotions when you say MF, Kiss My A**, your AH and much more intelligent vocable potential  from the new women in congress who thinks it is a fashion show not a development of progress and laws etc...Go Girls????
@CNNPolitics Pelosi, nothing worst than the President but he used words like stupid, flake etc.. But call someone while new to government call the president a MF. Such language in the normal work force is a HR file complaint. And you condone-thigh behavior on her first day????????????????????
@BBCWalesNews @BBCNews Quick, Happy Hour is almost over.
@CBSNews Obama, Schumer and Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006,  which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border. Check out the price tag. A fence huh! that keeps trespassers out all right or Beware Guard Dog On Duty.
@Independent Ignorant; lack of knowing or caring. What is important in ones life may not be so important to another. After all you work/hustle all day and want me shoulder data from the media of all sources. Most people work the 1 job or more would prefer how to get a better nights sleep
@mitchellvii @EricTrump Lucky? or clever like a Fox? You don't live that long without learning a few tricks up your sleeve. The newbies in the DEM. side will have an interesting tenure.
@nytopinion @nytimes @jonathanweisman He is not the one building houses and bulldozing down others homes no matter how poor. Relocate, we try that with Native Americas didn't work out so well still. Sorry, your neighborhood you Israeli must work with what you have. Fair and equal can work with time, start now
@washingtonpost Expansion is fine if within the proper building land requirements. BUT AND BUT the noise level during 2 pray times can be late evening and early morning. Respect faith this is not the desert. High tech, set alarms like a clock, cell phone etc. Enforce the same curfew as for music
@MSNBC That's only one video.Maybe check her friends in those days.I mean we have Maxine  Waters, endorsing physical  contact on Republics,Newbie calling the President a MF (Democrat) and a party girl all newly appointed and payed by tax payers. Will enjoy the fake news on these leaders
@CNN Do what you do best boys, fight for the right cause. And continue to use education and use your knowledge to make proper decision just as on a battlefield to get positive results for all involved. Remember there is no "I" in TEAM. and freedom is not Free!
@BBCWorld @BBCNews Excuse me but the increase of food intake and a stomach protruding  a little should of been a clue in months of monitoring her? That's going to be one amazing baby borne into a spot light from birth. I hope the child handles it well.
@NBCNews Do you honestly believe that even with a full staff which are posted on the edge of the overlook, slipping down a water area or the saddest of a tree to rob ones life would have a different ending? No, they put themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. R.I.P.
@CNN No infrastructure plans,real affordable health care without penalty, job growth, up dating industry,cleaning up the gang problem,modify guns laws but after 2 years still trying to tear down Trump.That's a waste of my tax dollars for your salaries. Drop your egos and do something.
@NBCNews Confused, Illegal immigrants getting a place, running water, food, shelter and legal help and if lucky a sponsor who puts them in a  apartment etc.. But 47% INCREASE in L.A. California and we should allow another several thousands in. Not caring current homeless but take more in?
@USATODAY Wow! No home work Clinton 5 days and 27 days. Obama 16 days. Maybe the THIRD but who reads history or look for facts, NOT YOU. And we are not bailing out banks and automakers like Obama did in addition to the shutdown. You should furlough your research team until they can read!
@CNN What is a third GENDER? I was in the restaurant business, how many TOILETS must a business have these days?
@CNN Thank goodness this's your generation, I'll stick with good old slap in the face at the bar or a beating by a jealous boyfriend for rejection but a hologram. If he were smart he's suited to the one way trip to Mars. even as just a janitor sorry, environmental engineer.
@realDonaldTrump We have enough of that already on the streets of America, we don't need more logs on the fire. Fine a way to invest better money in Central America our food bread basket with great potential rather than Syria and others who just like to fight over religion?These CA people can win
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Hammer away on Infrastructure but reel in the unions. Mr. Kushner program is a perfect opportunity to showcase early release to a TECH/VOC.training; welding. forklifts. scanners, road flaggers, backhoes, dump trucks and other equipment used to build. They have skills not open yet
@SenMarkey @SpeakerPelosi Our industrial complexes Stateside has the highest standards for emissions carbon foot print etc..You want climate change have the other countries in the world match the same standard. better yet form a scientific panel a way to deal with trash would be my first choice, water #2
@MitchKSmith @campbellnyt @alanblinder Obama went 13 days 2013, Clinton 5 days and another 27 DAYS same problems about workers but no one ever mentions they receive back pay, please! Mr.Trump only 13 days thus far so, Dem's (Newbies stop crying Wolf, you know the story right?)And they were DEM'S HUH!
@CNN I'm scare to go to a IHOP after Maxine Waters. Tax returns, that works both ways. Let's not work on issues like Infrastructure and keep this focus. Stop just feeding the media stuff to investigate, impeach etc.. Fine work on it but stop the news crap. Work on legislation please.
@cnni I love my dogs but if a person wants a pure breed that's in a pet shop I can not buy it unless from a shelter etc. So, now you limit the business of people and corps. that Love pets but restrict their business. i smell lawsuit not kitty litter. What's next Ca. save the ANT, flies
@latimes No problem let's have thousands enter who will fall between the cracks and resource to this life style of violence, after they keep saying they seen it all at home , L.A. is a great survival training course for poverty stricken people.We can't stop this . How can we help others
@washingtonpost No he's smart enough to have monitored the other attempts to influence cultures with the ruling direction is based on religion ideological thoughts not by the rule of accepted Common Law from the times of the Romans and Greeks. Let them battle it out. We are just targets, get out
@CNNPolitics And I saw children in the photo. Hey Mommy, what does  MotherF****er mean, it's OK I call your father that all the time.I apologize and promise to never say those words again at my new job as a GOD, for the suckers in the hood who voted me and all my lovely Muslim friends GO USA!
@SenatorBaldwin Tlaib has made a difference in peoples lives, great role model. All of the women in Congress should teach her some manners. Is this is the core of the NEW CONGRESS perhaps an impeachment process on her before she wrecks your party. We have Mr. Trump but not impeachable.
@NBCNews Now her true colors come out not like on the campaign trail all sweet and everything. Now as we try to rid gang bangers like M13 we take them off the street and give them a job in congress. So, Women of America and Democratic party this  is you? That would get a mouthful of soap.
@SenatorDurbin Medieval wall but when you having people with a big heart i get it. But, not educated, skills that are not used so much anymore, need food, shelter, medical care, housing and special help to navigate in a modern culture. So, the barrier they understand mentally and challenge.
@AmbJohnBolton Make sure Turkey steps up to the plate without trying to wipe out Kurds who are not the enemy of the people. Israel is a ally but we been holding there hands for to many years. Need to work on their housing plans. Like to see some practice to dismantle Boko Harom to use on ISIL
@CNNPolitics I thought we were to take gang bangers off the streets, instead they get a job in congress and bring the street trash with her. Do they do drug test on elected political people or a physic. evaluate . if they don't they should. Boy, Love to do a detail background check on her.
@NBCNews I see her language skills as a Muslim said its OK to call the President a MF. She and Maxine Waters seem to have displayed the NEW and OLD type of representation her Dem, party has brought to the new Congress. So democrats these are the people representing your vote and voice?
@SenatorDurbin 2013 shutdown lasted 16 days.1996, for a total of 27 days.November 14–19, 1995. Point, Obama and Clinton had shut downs that exceeded the current shutdown at 13 before you continue to bash the presidents decision for the security measure of a barrier and better enforcement of law
@realDonaldTrump Roll with the punches Mr. Trump.
@alexburnsNYT @ksacknyt Where's the books like the rest of them? he really just wants the library.
@NBCNews It was always there perhaps he uncorked the emotions but it does not dismiss in America to have a peaceful understanding. its us neighbor to neighbor who hasn't connected, can't blame government for peoples attitudes in the life they are. be accountable for yourself for once.
@CNN How many more different types of rest rooms must be installed in businesses now?
@Independent Is it dark or has the bubble popped?Citizens everywhere had always had their way. Now you say dark days,I see the different sides making a loud voice,now the trick is for the citizens to adjust to differences because we are in the same boat of the USA. New citizens change Ok, USA
@CNNPolitics Why did you Include a photo of Mr.McCain who as passed along with living Senators, bad taste what the message? Magical mystery tour idea?
@TIME Media reports25,000 Hondurans planning a new march North I hope Mexico has learn they will need to enforce the visa, other requests,So if as shown Mexico's weakness on law is costing the US system more now they 5 billion for a secure barrier with legal entrance points no promises
@HuffPost Make sure you discuss the volcano activity under the Arctic and Yellowstone. Try Mt. Etna shift in the angle of the planet since earthquakes. Learn science
@TheOval @USATODAY @jfritze In the past, including the 16-day shutdown in 2013, federal workers  received back pay. But that outcome is not guaranteed because it  requires Congress and the White House to work together to pass a law  mandating the back pay.
@Reuters Russia's version of Air Mail? Been there can't envision it flying in their winters as bad as Chicago in the winter.
@MSNBC You could of voiced Trump's associates involved etc.... But, to say the Family boy you have big B***s.
@Independent It's really not that far fetched. People who consider them selves of importance live in gated communities but why? For the same reasons for the barrier to stop the influx of people not following the rules of law and yet like storm troopers scale the border like a thief?
@USATODAY If there are warning signs in English so should there be ones in multi-languages always even just for insurance purposes as we are seeing now. Have a high tech Kiosk simple use to explain in chosen language. it is Disney for Pete's sake.
@NPR Ex-felons who are out but in prison NO, they burn that right until if released.
@NBCNews A bit vague, journalists who are US citizens killed aboard or on USA soil. If you talk about a tongue lashing by Mr. trump during a press conference than yes.
@Reuters Tough to find new recruits I guess but any old dog will do. Don't think we have to worry about Nukes coming from there.
@macrockets how much coal does it take to produce the power to operate the elelctric plug in? if it draws from wind power great. But, is it?
@RT_com If the shoe fits!
@latimes Just great! more pressure on the US. Hey Mexico enforce your border visa requirements. Why don't we enforce visa requirements. here in Thailand, the place you stay hotel or house.Round trip ticket,600 $ in your pocket. And hotels and landlords sent your passport # to immigration
@Forbes Could of used them in Indonisia
@globaltimesnews Fly's like the Spruce Goose. Funny, Pam Am with Boeing aircraft built an empire on this form of transportation. It can fly 4000km water rescue I think that might be a little late. other functions depends on tonnage and takeoff space needed and water conditions.
@washingtonpost Before we built billions of dollars prison system hanging was a normal way for criminals to end.Yes,if in some states those laws are still on the books they must be removed that's a no brainier in the 21st century.Wrong or right even a horse thief in the day hung. its in the past
@RT_com Finally, a refocus on a COMMON THREAT  ISIL The Kurds have a way to go for Turkey to back off on them however even Turkey realizise  that the frantic's of an ISIL must be removed and with the help of the Kurds. The Kurds are not the big problem right now. Stabilize first!
@Forbes Hey Congress, Mr.Spielberg provides us with a product we enjoy when we purchase it how come we can't get the same out of Congress they entertain me also and its free just watch watch the mass news media.
@RT_com Somebody forgot to do their scheduled inspections I.A.W. city codes and building permits of the day however;Temp changes, steel, winter in and out, loads like a elevator overloaded but avoidable or predictable with proper inspects, look at Seattle's Alaskan Way finally a funeral.
@nypost Would you rather we destroy them or control population growth. We should do it for some humans around the world also to cut down on lack of food source,land disputes etc.. Just like the Buck who needs and claims for survival. Need to look at he big picture and real needs of WHO?
@Reuters Now that's a corny take on the Trump's but not rude like SNL and late night TV been lost since they are not  capable of developing their own character. The idea of TV  is to take you away from real life, not in your face all. I want to laugh not think where is Red Skeleton?
@NBCNews But forgetting the continues needs of other consumer countries. China drive to exploit cheaper commodities but also to exploit the idea of cheap labor like Brazil and other nations it has lease land for farming is a plan to use others cheap resources Like buying Manhattan for $24
@nypost Duh! he was British and they tried to colonize us, didn't quite work out. Damn we could of been part of Brexit! Nope 3.5% unemployment lowest in 49 years. Anyone follow the CIP and its direction. MAGA
@nypost Ghani in the 50's learn to play nice with the Brit's. So should those who physically live there also. Everyone wants what Maslow determined  to be valid. What do you think. Only they can make the choice not the USA or others. https://t.co/cy3fxEQdZU
@nypost Business is dog eats https://t.co/La6Mna65qP greedy, owe to much, sell the business. Small business I had one is a personal think. I made some profit but the idea of ones idea to come to life was priceless. I felt good I had workers who appreciated employment.
@TrueMoveH hahahahahahahahahahahahah! You guys are funny!
@CBSNews 6 million dollars needed to stay alive, sorry for the pain all of you are going through1
@MitchKSmith @nytimes @matt_furber Claas Relotius; I understand he works at CNN and writes for other media outlines. Does he write for the Washington Post or you?
@SenatorTomUdall Its illegal to enforce immigration laws that most civilized countries have What hurts a local economy is the outpouring of money to support those you don't support the law and the citizens who do don't receive that $$ become more embedded in problems because the $$'s go elsewhere
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS We have over 350 million people in the worlds largest economy and consumers. So international trade war? how much made in China products at Wal-Marts in Texas really need. Thought about ways to produce more made in America or in Texas. Each state should brand their state products
@AP Two children both from Guatemalan huh! Common factors about the same age, same village?, water source? same diet? Dragged 2000 miles on foot, limited food supply that they are use to. Physical contact of 1000's of others with immune issues and bacteria you do the math.
@MSNBC I be happy to if I sold books and had a library and street named after me. Building homes  like Jimmy Carter , Mr&amp; Mrs Obama , sorry busy with new second house remodeling I forgot. Haven't seen a picture in a soup kitchen in Chicago or assistance overseas huh! To be a STAR wow!
@CNNPolitics And when did that bill pass in the house and the president sign it in a budget. Funny, you just SPLASH 2019 sort of the YK scare in it's day Your news reminds of the saying kicking a dog when its down kind of CNN style But be cautious lies always come back to bite you in the ass.
@realDonaldTrump The parent(s),were the guardians of the children and the blame lies there however the Dem's with their stance of the wall which has never been done or has it. To enter anothers land gates were erected, civil behavior enforced, is not a wall a control point for good citizens legal
@maziehirono The deaths of a person lies in the guardian of the person and the parents were the ones who failed the children however; the Dem's stance of NOT believing that a wall would stem or be a deterrent would fail how? it has never been tried. your lack of policy has made that clear.
@SenatorDurbin Trump has donated his quarterly salary since taking office, you got your check how did you spend it? Congress when rtn will vote in back pay admendment everyone who is federal knows. but now their unions provide$ as part of their dues as normal unions do. your the crybaby!
@SenatorCantwell No,I disagree.Some of these common problems can be control by simple health management and over the counter drugs that are affordable.Example;I'm asthmatic and a cup of strong black tea to help open lungs because of the natural caffeine. Diabetes, wt. and diet + exercise=health
@NPR So stay at 2012 levels and are other countries at that level or performing better? Paris accord?
@NBCNews He summed up the total package Check2018 vs 2019 increases. salary 2.55% BHA basic housing allowance, hazardous duty pay up, sea pay, flt. pay and other increase check the internet I di. Big jump like Mr. Regan did in the day.I thought you had a research dept, not Starbucks data
@CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon For decades the issue/problems with the immigration laws and enforce has been there on the back burner. Mr. Trump has uncorked  a burning issue which has come to this point however; we are here, tough measures for now until a reasonable plan is negotiated. it takes 2 to talk.
@washingtonpost In addition to the men and women in the arm forces they are also citizens who deserve the right to hear words directly from the Commander and Chief who yes has a agenda that differs from most democrats so and the media spins his words on the TV he said what he believes in for us.
@NPR You said mostly, everyone knows when a military there roads, power, water is put in place. Sorry about no schools their been busy not getting blown away by the enemy that tears down everything they put up. Look beyond the school, try google earth for a birds view of a street.
@RT_com Mr. Trump goes to a golf course, check out Macron's digs!
@USATODAY I sent this on CNN short story 2018  vs 2019 salary increase 2.55% Also check the charts, Bha; basic housing allowance, sea pay, hazardous pay, bonuses and there are several more increase since Mr. Regan 10% across the board is close to the real figure when computed as a total.
@guardian Yes!
@guardian We talk ISIL and troop withdraws, are we forgetting a plague on societies Boko Haram?
@JessicaDurando @USATODAY Wow!wish you inflated my business ledger with such a high number,If 5m for one day so $5 billion for control systems could save 5 million each day from a lost So what are the Dem's waiting for.I guess they forget that is a infrastructure project which would employ a lot of people
@NBCNews The days of the 400 page Christmas catalog and outhouse use has past. Somebody was not watching the changes at Sears, too bad.
@CNN @karaalaimo @CNNOpinion Your funny, this Star Trek 21st century. Monopoly is out . Oldest game The game of Life you should look at the board if you can find one. Put down the cell phone on a 8 year old or a 35 year old your so funny, Selfie!
@washingtonpost FORCED, no given a choice The hair if grabbed by the opponent would be points on a foul which in turn restrictions that opponent chances because the confusion of what part of the body is legal in the sport. Not force, given  impunity to compete at a proper rule level broken.
@Independent write a book like the others, Clinton's, Obama, Commey your in good company haha!
@CNN legislative process includes  evaluating, amending, and voting on proposed laws and is concerned with  the words used in the bill to communicate the values, judgments, and  purposes of the proposal. but lets get lawyers and staff, not focus on the job where were you on a work day
@nytimesworld @nytimes Sounds like they need to question their leadership management skills the the rest of the worlds financial economies take the hits, your nothing special.
@NBCNews Just maybe if you do remember their faces you better run and hide because they will be there to kick your asses!
@USATODAY Yes, the heck with the Middle East. Lets address this issue here at home. If you can't fix your own backyard why are we tiring to fix theirs?
@guardian Know your a grownup and stop speaking like a 13th year old on drugs, not cool!
@RT_com Give me a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@USATODAY CNN and SNL has become poor taste except for those limited in a concrete world.
@HuffPost The boys dream??????????????? Rumors and do what once hear?
@JeolenC You don't follow if you had the edge o a golden spoon but risk, i prefer challenges even in a relationship and your marriage with a  sprinkle of faith can go a long way on a rainy day. The shine of gold will fade but the work never stops the heart of it's job.
@mchooyah @CNNPolitics But they buy the books by the Clinton's or Obama's and get a signature but that is different Explain someone please Stop selling those America flags everywhere to while your at it Don't let mickey sign that commercial hat mind set to visit the park many times and bring the family
@CGTNOfficial Confused? they had someplace else to attend that was more important then discussing and working out plans for US in 2019 at Congress?  how to stop truancy in Congress, shut down all perks/salaries/food service, hell i lock the bathrooms in their offices.
@marklevinshow Arm chair reporting, does she even know where Iraq is on the map? You know what they said about opinions and a**es, everyone has one.
@brithume When has that stopped certain news media outlets? Again you are just another one with too big of a personal opinion instead of being neutral and us interpret the news for ourselves that your payed to provide. Where's Walter Cronkite or Peter Jennings when you need them..
@SenBennetCO How can you substitute the word ESCAPE to the word dragging a child 2000 milesthe stress load, lack of food and shelter along the way and arrive and the CPD doing a great job with THOUSANDS  of immigrants being cared for doing the processing phase. a floor is better than a desert
@nytimes Must be getting desperate for a 50 year old byline!
@TheLeadCNN @CNN If it would be in the best interest according to CIA types Mr. Pompeo would of intervene if critical . CIA is to self serving of a influence in such matters. Again only 2,000 people who in one big battle could be destroyed. Let them fight it out finally.
@CNNnewsroom @CNN @NimaCNN He was there for the troops not to be overshadowed in politics and you the media turning it another head line to find faults in each move he makes.What haven't you produced a story with a Interview with the PM and ask your self??? about the withdraw.
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @RepGaramendi We went from 100,000 troops on the ground in the past to only 2,000 on the ground I call that progress, so protect those valuable resources of 2000 lives who will live to fight another war in another far away land. For now give them a break. heard of Drones?
@OutFrontCNN @CNN No you put 2000 military personnel at risk. 2000, that's not even a garrison level. To you it may satisfy you lack of military tactics but against the news report 30,000 ISIL.	France and England since the early 1900's has vested interest there no us. get out save lives and money.
@CNN Go Greyhound! We don't check ID's we only want you in our seats ( all major credit cards accepted),  or with cash! Government vouchers, food stamp cards whatever; Water $2 dollars extra enjoy your trip.
@CNNSitRoom @CNN Americans are all ready paying the price of a LOOSE border in 100's of facilities housing the immigrants, the logistical support at the border and people processing documents, power, water, fuel etc... what's the tally on that? Food bill 25,000 to feed? And more to come.
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @RepGaramendi Question; did not the ARMY corp of engineers get involve in the levees in New Orleans? Idea, with newly released prisoners and the Army and Navy CB's training and construction could be done at the same time.Also such a project with military personnel would get experience!
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @RepGaramendi Here are the Top 25 countries providing UN Peacekeepers:	Ethiopia (8,326)India (7,471)Pakistan (7,161)Bangladesh (6,772)Rwanda (6,146)Nepal (5,131)Senegal (3,617)Burkina Faso (3,036) and you 2000 US troops against ISIL in Syira and expect + results? Kidding right?
@CNN Compromise!
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump A $5 billion dollar secure border is cheaper than in this wave of immigrants 25,000 and what about the next group if these individuals are given asylum and the next. How much have we spent just in months for this latest unsought of people. Where is the Dems Ideas???????????????
@CGTNOfficial Sorry a 71 year old man in a homemade barrel? So, now the coast guards of the water ways and US Naval ships plus some commercial ships will be on the look out for him. And hoping no problems but if there are problems somebody has to rescue him and who pays the check?
@CGTNOfficial If only 2000 US were on the ground and many in logistical support and the news reports 30,000 ISIL? excuse me not very good odds for an effective military presence. So, to save our only 2000 troops from harm coming home is a good move.
@CGTNOfficial Sorry, but the news skipped the part that MAINTENANCE of the system in a salt water environment was not done as scheduled. Sad way to learn a lesson with people paying the price.
@CNN So, how does that work under Obamacare and Democrats idea of preexisting conditions. Sorry, I left my Platinum card at home? But, I wrote a book and I work for Congress my health care credit is good, right buddy old pal's.
@CNN Yes, investigate why a parent would drag a sick child 2000 miles on foot to a place where she has no idea about. I wager they told her about Disneyland and can eat all the ice cream you want BUT keep on walking!!!!!!!!!!!!! Right investigate but who was is  responsible?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Servicemen and women on duty 24/7 including today and so is our Commander and Chief. Don't see Congress anywhere!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Correct Mr. Trump. Money from a fellow Muslim rather than us  consider as infidels   removes the idea we are trying to conquer them as a people. We can  augment help through other channels without the show of military interference . Let the Russians do it and fail.
@nytimes I'm confused, last time I entered a park there was an entrance fee? Some smaller parks but most had fees which goes in maintaining the park. The workers yes, federal or state but still a fee is collected if private would cover cost
@CNN Now! that's a good man. As a person with limited mobility but still able to afford my own needs, I am thankful to know that people like him is part of this world.
@elonmusk If your going to dream big!
@CGTNOfficial What is it the media doesn't report about the bridging of North and South Korea and the participation of Mr. Trump as a key player in this success. Now the N&amp;S are the path of peace between themselves.
@nytimes Good luck with that idea. I live here in Thailand and Ghetto kids in the US playing ball is a way out of poverty for them. it's on TV here  all day and the village kids watch it all and cartoons to exercise their brains.
@CNN How often does a 15 year old fly? Red meat, no new things etc... carbon foot print? Try plastic elimination, dump your MP3 player batteries also, watch out with the shampoo you use etc... Wow! 15 huh! where did you get such ideas before wanting to be on the TV?
@elonmusk To dream, fail and than succeed that's Magic.
@SenatorHeitkamp Mr. Trump has being since he has been president, now you wave your flag in the public's noses.
@CNN Tell your peers to stop shooting each other in schools or dance halls also. You are the generation watching violence  on videos, games  etc,, not old farts like me or your parents. 15, take responsibility for your own actions and not blame others. Kids, be kids not killers.
@cnnbrk Have finger prints?
Greyhound tells passengers how to push back when Border Patrol comes on board https://t.co/lvnk2VbCoB When did Greyhound bus company become mobile lawyers to protect law breakers Oh! keep the money flowing in not abide by the law?????????????
@CGTNOfficial Yes climate change it's all Mr. Trumps fault. Oh! wait Mt.. Etna been there and so has the Volcano for thousands of years as it spouts gases into the atmosphere to warm the planet or kill dinosaurs off. Are we next because of Mr. Trump or mother earth which is it in control?
@CNN @BobCorker How can you predict the wall will not be a deterrent, magic ball? Ever climb 30 feet in the air in the middle of the night sir with police on the other side waiting?	Open policy hasn't worked, how about a new approach a 30foot WALL?
@CNN @RandPaul Senator your speaking to deaf ears, just do your best work at work. The media likes to twist the public in the wind. 50 billion in a country that hates us huh? CNN does not comprehend those facts, it does not because it's business is to  sell news like a bad TV show.
@CNN @RandPaul Thank you Senator, pull up those boots straps as they say. Your neighborhood defend it.
@ChrisVanHollen A few thousand troops which are mostly logistical support and maintenance personnel for equipment do impact a large scale military present. to impact a change only to put them in harms way. Now 200,000 on the ground your talking. But, Dem's don't think so chickens!
@nytimestravel @nytimes Suppose to tip then what in the heck is the 10=20% service charge on my bill every time. The employer is suppose to give that to the workers not in their pockets. D'on't blame the customers nail the owners.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse A physical deterrent sets a different mind set. Besides delays of thinking to avoid a barrier gives our CPD time to response. I'm OK if they enter with LEGAL do process Mr. President. Merry Christmas sir.
@amyklobuchar 40 years to late.
@amyklobuchar @JohnCornyn You sure like the words  " MY Bills", thought the other 400+ members had a voice also?
@amyklobuchar 20 billion heck, Mr. Trump only wants 5 billion, so if you do this then 15 billion won't get lost correct?
@amyklobuchar Wait we shut down now 2 days and a person or business rushed to purchase a home in 2 days before Christmas, a small business was going to expand during the holidays and thousands work with no pay or you mean delay for federal salary employees. McDonald's still hands out checks.
@amyklobuchar @DickDurbin @SenMikeLee @JohnCornyn @CoryBooker @ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein You forgot Mr. Kushner?
@amyklobuchar @pressfreedom How does a Journalist free a society? report, yes free a society what planet do you live on? They report and the powers to be make changes. It seems they been reporting for 100 years and never seen them FREE  a society as you say??????????????
@amyklobuchar @SenDuckworth I suggest finger print ID to operator a weapon , to simple in today's technology world, don't think so.
@amyklobuchar @nytimes Your talking about children with guns who only wish is to go home, they are not a trained military. Forced to fight or worse on their families. No one wishes to die for a cause especially when they have no idea why!
@amyklobuchar @FoxNews @BretBaier Military advisers or the industrial Military machine Eisenhower warn about in 1960?	It's not our neighborhood, fix us first they worry about the others who wish to destroy their own turf,
@nprpolitics Cracks me up, 300,000 and then 500,000 and millions effected no pay you say 800,000 , glad I don't gamble and misinform my bank account.
@SenFeinstein He is a old war horse like Patton, never wishes to see a battle finish. he served well but times change and he should also.
@SenDuckworth Tens of millions , where did you pull that number from in your dreams?
@SenatorCantwell Asthma, diabetes etc are manageable by common sense over the counter meds and common sense. Are citizens in Washington state that lazy to learn basic health care for themselves or you and the taxpayers must hold their hand?
@nprpolitics Not about jobs huh! It does not matter the color of your skin only the skills and personal drive to succeed.
@SenToddYoung @washingtonpost Let's hear the plan on CNN, sir.
@amyklobuchar Funny you don't look like a teenager but again your history lessons come from the TV tube, correct? Ever been to a library?
@ChrisCoons Most law enforcement comes from city budgets.
@ChrisVanHollen Using words that MOST people never have used or hear of. Trying to impress Huh! Act in an excessively subservient manner. Like bending down to Democrats with their head in the sand, sir? kowtowed????????????????? not impressed.
@cat_travis But what a great mind to write our Constitution How do you know they had a Lisp? Drink to much like a football match in a PUB?.
@CGTNOfficial Like football, let them battle their own internal questions after 3,000 years they need to wake up.
@CNNSotu @SenBobCorker @jaketapper @RandPaul @RepAdamSchiff @ninaturner @RickSantorum @PaulBegala @mkhammer @CNN @cnni @SIRIUSXM @BobCorker @DrRandPaul Definition of cartoon. 1 : a preparatory  design, drawing, or painting (as for a fresco) 2a : a drawing intended  as satire, caricature, or humor a political cartoon. b : comic strip. Laughing not I as a disabled VET
@CGTNOfficial Patience is a virtue, let Turkey and gang do what they said they can do. We can always go back in. We need a break so does our military personnel.
@nytimes Shut down the limo's, lunch rooms, personal security, perks lie the gym etc.. Take away something that politicians have come to expect. Park personal cars outside and walk to work. many could use the exercise. exit the necessitates they bullshit with in the morning etc..
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS Families or government workers who are on salary and will receive their pay. Why make a statement as if everyone in New Mexico will not receive a paycheck?	You will get your check correct, so will others! Of all states border security should be a major issue,
@CGTNOfficial Only stakeholder and shareholders cry, please!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@EnergyDems @SenatorCantwell @realDonaldTrump A million caribou are more important than supporting humans. They will survive as the pipe that has been for decades without destroying them off. Keep buying foreign oil and resources Senator Cantwell. When I see you riding a bike to work because of no gas in you car tank.
@nytimesworld @nytimes Gave him a gift, right. No his Vietnam and billions of dollars and future lost of lives trying to influence people who want ours and his money but not infidels on the ground. You don't know much of Middle East history. Russian can't balance their country it think?
@GovInslee Mr. Governor I think we should send the 25,000 illegals over to Yakima and expand your prison system of them How many in custody there.I did DUI time there and 80% were gang bangers,want more send the buses to the border sir. Like cold eggs and sleeping on a floor with 46 others,
@CGTNOfficial Why is China involved in India's military? Land grab. Funny when you spent money the friends you make.
@ChrisCoons You work for the people, don't see you  sitting in the halls of Congress to work out a deal. Enjoying your paid holiday period?
@SenAlexander Mixing Apples and Oranges? Budget, Nukes who elected you with such thinking.  You never would of made in my 7th grade history class.
@ChrisVanHollen Why, you don't like advice from someone smarter than you and the B**ls to say it?
@SenCoryGardner Mr. Gardner, why is it that in your statement 25 billion dollar bill to address many issues of immigration and CNN does not provide this news to the public? 	Thank you, and for supporting common sense. There is no correct answer to a problem but at least a positive step forward
@lisamurkowski Your on the right track Senator Murkowski, others should follow.
@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump Before 25,000 marched North. Check the news bro!
@PattyMurray Your a government employee and you will get your check, so will they. Stop pushing buttons and causing stress. perhaps if as a real POLITICIAN you would of iron out a deal. Check Yakima and how many illegals in jail Who pays those with no paycheck ,right! Nice to live in a bubble
@amyklobuchar To mention TV show Magna Carta, which means The Great Charter', is one of the most important documents in history as it established the principle that everyone is  subject to the law, even the king, and guarantees the rights of  individuals, the right to justice to a fair trial.
@CGTNOfficial Correct, that is why to pull our nose out now while we can before the Democrats want us to stay.
@CGTNOfficial Let them learn to play nice in their own back yard.
@SenatorCarper Cold fusion is next.
@cnnbrk Illegal, how did it get on the shelves or doctors hands. Follow the money and find the problem. Call investigative news.
@nytimes How did you go from 500,000 to millions???????????????????
@nytimes he could of worn a cap, But for fair safety reasons fair but it should of been done in the locker room not on the mat.
@SenatorDurbin They are salary, check your score card. You will get your check correct?
@SenatorLeahy The forest will still be there and the parks after Mr. Trump leaves office. After all, they are still here after Teddy, right?
@SenatorCantwell And because of the evergreens my ASTHMA  is fine no pollen like a Maple Tree back East.
@SenatorCantwell 90% of the list you posted can be dealt with with common sense, i as a Asmathic as an example. You wish to treat everyday problems of people rather than educate common cures, Asthma, a cup of tea opens air ways, Acne please, eating dis orders again etc.. Diabetes diet exercise.
@ChrisVanHollen I lived and worked and trained in the Middle East for 9 years,let them work out their problems you don't know anything about the average person there.Take orders let them get their hands more dirty but not at the expense of our service personnel. ISSL is a local problem, not ours
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That is why he is the President and you are not he has B***s.
@CNN Spin on old school, you think to deep but actually no brains at all. Just twisting a tune which no harm in it's day #metoo crap, please get over your self's.
@SenBlumenthal You should worry about your own state.
@SenatorBaldwin Seen the photo's of 25,000 people trying to enter at one time. How many spare bedrooms do you have, ? need a few thousand yard boys or maids, please!
@CNN Always trying to sue someone, how about a person who puts themselves in the wrong place at the wrong hour of the night.
@SenBobCasey Sorry, egos aside. These countries which we have integrated for less than 500 years has been good for us. But, now they wish wish to bleed us dry of money and resources because we are weak and we are not. Stop being big brother and protect the MAGA without outside pressure.
@PattyMurray @SenWhitehouse Put a hold on our resources  and jobs and buy more foreign resources and when they choose to shut us down they what? remember 1973 OPEC and gas lines, I guess you were just a young girl not diving to work yet to pay bills before mass transit.
@SenWhitehouse @wuerker Donor interest? Do you understand  anything about DHHS AND THE WELFARE SYSTEM. Do you know that even as a Non US citizen can collect SOCIAL SECURITY MONIES  when the chain link to family members come here,
@SenBlumenthal synonyms:peevish, bad-tempered, querulous, pettish, fretful, cross, irritable, sulky, snappish, crotchety, touchy, tetchy, testy, fractious, grumpy, disgruntled, crabby; USE SUCH WORDS FOR FOR THE AVERAGE, YOUR A JERK. I KNOW BETTER, IMPRESS POOR PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenatorCantwell Your not very good at numbers Senator Cantwell.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I guess dedication is more important to some than you at home on a Tuesday, not in CONGRESS and you still get your check. Nice example of leadership for the working class that voted in office???????????????
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump They are salary workers and will get a check. Why because he is and was rich comes into the mix, jealousy? Do your homework correctly, why are you not in the Congress on a Tuesday doing your job as the election people selected you, Enjoy your paycheck for CHRISTMAS.
@SenBlumenthal Sorry, it took 20 years for you to realize this. Pass it along to Baltimore and Chicago.	My idea a finger print control on the trigger, too simple I know. But 21st century. Don't take weapons from  good people control those of the other side and protect children by misfires.
@SenatorDurbin hard working America paychecks, how much money of tax dollars go to support our homeless, OK but illegal immigrants, those illegals in federal prisons, over stayers using DHHD services , social programs etc... America first, try it for a few years which we haven't done in DECADES
@CGTNOfficial Oh! Please it's a jump ramp ship of one. ( 15 aircraft), The average person does not understand this. A antique Russian vessel if you want to learn more read Jane's.
@SenBlumenthal How many people have left your office?
@CGTNOfficial I guess when the road gets tough light weights bail ship. GOODBYE IN YOUR NEXT BAILING.
@SenatorCantwell Quick response, disabled Vet had teeth problems went to DHHS for help, they deny me care for free because my income was $400 per month but a illegal in Bellevue got 100% free care. Sorry, you really don't know your system there.
@cnnbrk Wait you call list a story but unnamed foreign government, stay tune America again breaking fake news for selling ratings, You people are full S***t
@elonmusk You should be building a museum to Mr. Tesla and yourself  for having visions, You earn this respect as others thought Tesla was a crackpot. people like you bring dreams to the real world. Remember Kennedy, we do because it is hard
@CGTNOfficial Whast's a White boy doing in China as a spokes person anyway? can't find a way to sow your views in your country. We call that PROPAGATION
@CGTNOfficial We are allowed to have conflict and not be be RAN OVER BY A TANK.  Or as a Christian put in camps asshole! We are not perfect but do not lock up 1st amendment people so much only dangerous ones!
@JayTilton @SenatorLeahy @realDonaldTrump Reality is why you were voted in. We trusted your words to voice us as I go out an pick up your trash containers at 5am . Do you wish to switch jobs for a year?
@SenateCloakroom try working through Christmas not the cloak room, average people still go to work on this day, how about congress? Not funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@waltshaub @SenJeffMerkley Senator Merkley, complicity is a disease when someone spends to much time in one position. Only the rare continue to vision change others stuck in old school mud believing it works. Culture changes never faze them. keep up with the people not policy.
@BryanLowry3 Yes he would as he warned in his exit speech of the military industrial complex influences that plague us. I believe in a strong defense as a military man but there are limits. people in the world need to eat food not bullets for profit. Why can't we stop where they come from?
@NEI @SenJohnBarrasso @SenatorCarper @JimInhofe @SenWhitehouse @MikeCrapo @SenBooker Great, now COLD FUSION and harvest solar power from the sun and stars before fossil fuels are finished and we all know that is real. But core energy of the earth is yet to be looked at.
@SallyQYates @SenJeffMerkley Your right Senator Yates, it's not about the wall but a fair way to enter the country. The rules of of Common Law that most countries abide by, why not us on immigration? Can't the Democrats see this? Without rules you have have no direct to forged forward as a Nation .
@RepJayapal Medieval is allowing individuals who come into a territory to change and dispute a stabilized society with rules of laws and undermine a system to suit there needs from the same place they came from. Give me your poor etc.. meant individuals with skills and dreams.
@SenDuckworth Of course they will will be payed, your payed right? They are salaried employees like you. Stop sending the wrong message. Will you get your check, yes you will.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Explain to me how 25,000 people climbing over the border with no skills seeking free care etc.. benefits the other 500,000 homeless we have already  don't have a government hot shower as those in the illegal sponsored shelters now? can't you mow your own yard?
@ChrisVanHollen Pay increases for the average worker comes from the employer not the government. With tax breaks for companies they were able to pass along a better wage for the average worker. Some states pay $15 hour to work at a McDonald's for a $1 dollar burger, get real Sir.
@SenJohnHoeven Senator Hoevon besides the border security issue many people have not hear about the bill which includes disaster assist funds. put 2 and 2 together and let the NAY Sayers make a comment on that. You can't have it both ways. COMPROMISE, yes but pass something!
@CNN it just shows people will do anything to break the laws.
@CNN You mean choking or paralyzing Congress, last time I checked it was the Democrats who wish to act like an ostrich, it's the 21st century, time for a change. Pandemonium?	History and Etymology for pandemonium Latin daemonic "evil spirit," borrowed from Greek damnation "evil spirit
@nytpolitics @nytimes if a voter is that easily manipulated then have at it. I believe the voters of America know better. Only the fake mass media perceives it as an invasion from Russian and make us feel duped into believing it, WRONG, I live here and know local political situations. NYT ha!ha!
@CNN Don't stop choices, if you choose not to purchase the product don't sway others by bias opinions, it's business and the folks working in the factory need the work. buy another brand. Simple!
@peterbakernyt @nytimes @maggieNYT What lies ahead is both parties need to grow in their mind set and really see the world from the bottom-up. learn to walk in a persons shoes before passing judgement of something you never experienced.
@nytimes OK, lets blame Mr. Trump climate change, has anyone read or studied science at the NY times. Paris accord of course man made 3 billions year ago??? it's called evolution study the solar system, Saturn loosing rings yes Mr. Trumps fault right. it must be nice young and misinformed
@marclacey @nytimes Is going to a park on Christmas on your wish list cook a family meal, call an old friend.Visit a nursing home. Help at a soup kitchen .Security still in place who feeds you this information it comes from airport fees also duh! Visit your neighbor
@CNN @sallykohn @CNNOpinion $10 million raised privately and Democrats hold up Mr. Trumps promise and it's his fault, right! But they have no immigration plan which is fair to the US citizens only to appease the liberals.
@nytimes It's a abused system, get their butts up and be thankful for the program and be a productive citizen in sort of fashion and just maybe get self respect back to be a roll model for children and others.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Step in the right direction. Now train them for needed jobs to rebuild our infrastructures and send the kids back into school for skills or on the path to college. Camden County Voc/Tech school N,J. could be used as an example, one of the best in the country Mr. Trump
@nytimes It's about time, wasted money spent on repairs, safety issues before the next quake brings it down and killing people and the aftermath.
@granny2651 @nytimes Funny you say that,been there married and divorce one. Let Russian,Turkey and Iran spent Billions in a culture that does not like infidels and trust me they won't like the Russians in their neighborhoods for long. You think infrastructure is bad in Central America, Eastern Russia
@nytimes What were they thinking? That deserves a long prison sentence to set an example.
@CNN @RonPaul @smerconish Thank you Mr. Paul. We are not in the empire maintenance business.
@nytimes Some non essential government services will close, parks etc.. But most federal workers are on a monthly salary and will receive money. Why do you put out misinformation like that?
@CNN Car Jackers haven! Taggers fun! rain, snow, traffic lights, pot holes, cross walks? Are you serious? What happens when you trust and spend you food budget and it does not arrive. Or I a disabled person and my food does not arrive who do I call, Ghost-busters?
@nytimes It's to time to past the torch. After all the British and French sliced up the Middle East after WW I as colony powers their problems we got sucked into.These countries need to learn to play nice in their sand box. Give them farm equipment not bullets. I live 9 years there I know
@nytimes 500,000 homeless in America now  and do we need 25,000 more at one time to provide for. That is a group larger than some militarism and police departments and they can't stop crime in there own region? Spineless people.
@CNN Sweet but, where are the children who need the Christmas spirit stuck in there beds and rooms. Not the adults who work there shift and return to for them They are important too but, " Show me the Children Rock Obama Santa"
@JBrusells Only can wish that the intended people really read our voices from the normal people not the media salesmanship for ratings.
@SteveDaines  Sorry I  misspelled your name in my tweet. Merry Christmas. eye sight failing.
@CNN Stupid question? Finger print control trigger so a 4 year old can't shoot there sibling? Or a street gang banger can't fire a stolen weapon. I know to simple huh? But on a credit card to buy beer and cig's no problem huh!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Want to show the right-stuff Mr. President. Have a HUGH Christmas dinner on the front lawn Christmas day. it is a Tuesday. Invite the Nay Sayers and see who shows up for work. Lincoln did not rest on Christmas. Others on hourly wage have to work, why not CONGRESS?
@CNN Tell you what, how about we send the 20,000+ immigrants to the CNN offices to clean, wash windows, polish your cars and limos and do you like Burrito's. You build housing, provide health care and of course child care. Deal CNN?
@nytimes We tried alcohol, give it a chance. If not legally controlled it will find it's way. haven't banned booze or cig's and look at the damage anyway. Take crack and guns off the streets nope. Fix old school problems and worry about the changing culture later, Progress!
She can survive but to make life decisions on my behalf what are you thinking? I spent months in a nursing home at 49 recovering VA surgery and the average age was 66-90 and when you are sick you do not make clear direct decisions, can she?

@CNN I remember my time in the military on 5 aircraft carriers. I don't recall calling in sick on a Monday or taking a day off when there was a job to be done, all for $246.36 a month in 1976-1986/ Yes, the pay went up with Mr. Regan. Congress do your job, send the limo drivers home.
@realDonaldTrump Sorry Mr. President , first lady and family and to Mr. Pence and his family I forgot to wish you a old politic saying; Merry Christmas. I don't know about you but I will watch White Christmas again with Bing and Danny and of course eggnog.
@CNN Sounds like; Clockwork Orange? Did he kill a Deer or Deers and I'm just an Engineer with bad spelling?Deers is an accepted plural
@CNN didn't hear about CNN sending power generators to Syria. Yemen to have Christmas lights or just electricity for hot water and cook food, Remember its a tax write-off good for you. Why not put your money where your mouth instead the average US muster the courage to help,
@CNN If you can't handle the heat in the kitchen, McDonald's is hiring. Subject to violence, never mention the group of soldiers diverted to cover your ass for safety. In Vietnam news people carried a weapon to survive, your poor excuse? For news you put my friends in harms way.
@VP Your a team, stand fast it is the right direction in the 21st century for my country, thank you. Welfare, free money, bloated payouts are finished. Roosevelt put people to work who wanted to work. It's time lazy people 4 decades of that to stop. No one likes 6am wake-ups.
@PressSec Your a strong person, the ACORN dosen't fall far the tree Mr. Huckalbee , you did good. You should be proud of this person and to call her your daughter.
@sheba418 @GeorgPapp @qq_american @realDonaldTrump Do you think you would have the courage to make decisions for 350 million people, when most people pause in line at STARBUCKS to order a $6 coffee????????????????
@SteveDaines Mr. Danies, as a Vet I live in Thailand can't email sorry, It's not just about the wall but the LEGAL and proper way to enter the USA. Really want to shake a tree please learn about VISA overstays here and what they are doing. I wish we did the same in the USA. ????
@CNN It survived Billions of years before Mr. Trump and will be here before the CNN blame him for climate change. Volcano's under the ARCTIC, of course Trump. Yosemite FAULT LINE of course Trump,San Andreas Fault of course Trump. Well, what about the ice age of 1800's of course!!!
@realDonaldTrump  Stand your ground Mr. President. Eisenhower warned about the Industrial military complex. Make peace in South Asia? Green Acres. Mr. Albert a VET sent farm equipment not guns. Mr. Perot sent food. Kennedy Peace Corp.Old Ideas still work on uneducated people.
@AC360 @CNN @drsanjaygupta A great legal mind is an asset however: from experience as a Disabled Vet with multiple physical problems that over the years haven't always had a clear mind. It's time for her to move on, finish what time she has but not in the courts. It's not correct for the situations now.
@nytimes Mr. Rubio can have a long career in politics after he learns to put our people first. 17 years trying to stabilized a culture that is not willing to do their own hard work. focus Mr. Rubio. They survived 3000 years before America started Middle East welfare programs. Alliances?
@nytimes Yes, the mass news media to busy finding what is wrong in government but never report the other side of a story and the impact of our citizens needs, military, infrastructure needs etc. All Mr. Trump bashing, the media is an embarrassment to the normal people of this country.
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @jaketapper Hey Jake, If you lost friends and part of your body defending people who can't and won't help themselves would you not be happy to come home to your family and friends. Feel safe in gated community don't you, lucky fool. Others live in the real world on a hourly wage.
@bpolitics Dream come true? 17 years wasted for ideology change and never will happen. Let Russian, Turkey and Iran loose lives and billions of dollars in a sink hole which $$$ better spent on it's people. Stop welfare thinking!
@bpolitics Finally, the lives of our military personnel and the billions of dollars to change the minds of embedded minds wasted  in South Asia can and should be diverted to our infrastructure needs.
