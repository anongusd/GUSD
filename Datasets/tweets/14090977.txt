@Abraham42350652 @amyklobuchar @SherrodBrown Incorrect. Voter ID laws prevent people from voting because they do not have the required documentation with them. Inactive status is worse, because people discovered this at voting time not knowing they need these docs with them.
@amyklobuchar @SherrodBrown As an election worker, I would see this notation on voter registrations, which required them to present proof of identity at the time they voted.

@eshark67 @KamalaHarris White privilege maybe to not know this, but... It's not just a murder, it's putting a murdered person on display (typically hanging in a public place by a noose) to terrorize an entire group of people. The additional crime is terrorism; threatening more murders = 2nd crime.

@LouC_2 @JohnStossel @AWEA https://t.co/gpypbr6mXc . Experience Curve is an econ idea that explains why the price of wind is declining the way it is, and PV solar cells as well.
@LouC_2 @JohnStossel @AWEA I'm actually quite well versed in it, having spent most of my adult life paying attention, with a passion for the engineering and science of renewables.  So, yes, I do know what I am talking about. @AWEA #WindPower #pv @Lazard
@LouC_2 @JohnStossel Wind is already is half the cost of the coal that is burned.  Thus lots of new wind capacity.  @AWEA has good charts, too.  No new coal power plants built since 2014 in USA for a reason. https://t.co/mDb6tqLYfz
@ETAWhenever @AprilDRyan Hiyyyyyyyyyyah!!!!  Self defense made simple.
@LouC_2 @JohnStossel MANY turbines are made there.  Most?  MANY of the ones installed in the USA are made by Americans, and are definitely maintained by Americans.   Solar PV and wind installers, as a job market, are 1.2M now, last I checked, far more than the 30k coal miners that are left.
@JohnStossel @LouC_2 Bs.  Money for oil goes to the middle east, to fighting evil tyrants. Money for wind turbines goes to Iowa GE workers who build them.

@teriblturk @NRAblog @NRA Waiting Periods save domestic violence (DV) victims (almost always women &amp; children) since murder-suicides w/ gun far more deadly than other attacks, plus waiting period is frequently anger-cooling-off period. Proven, state vs. state. #NeverAgain
@teriblturk @NRAblog @NRA Great to have an actual response instead of knee-jerk one. Waiting periods save lives: suicide and domestic violence by gun in states with a 3-day waiting period are proven less.

@VoteShelbyMood @dsmyxe @hboulware That's some bit of BS right there, dude.  Teachers are not babysitters.

@howard_land @NRA You won't have Trump for long.  His days are numbered, and I think everyone who isn't a Fox fanatic knows it.  Massive corruption, FBI and US attorneys are closing in.  Embarrassment.  Too bad, wish could have done what promised.

@DoctorKOH @hboulware Sadly, they didn't teach Finnish or swedish in my schooling.  I'm suggesting we can learn from Finland.  Fund schools per pupil, from state funds.  Property tax, I think you might agree despite our debate here, leads to vast disparities of opportunity and educational quality.
@hboulware You have 4 day school weeks and are famous now for supplies shortages and outraged teachers.  Their opinion beats yours on what should happen next.
@grsvt81 @hboulware I understand you have opinions.  The Finnish do, too: they made education a national priority.  The international rankings show the great results they are getting. They also are very quick to integrate innovation. We could benefit from their experience.
@hboulware Suburbs,  &amp; each varies drastically in quality because school funding is based on property tax.  Poor areas need more money per student because upbringings are frequently nonideal. Blaming parents can't work across populations of 100,000's.  Kids deserve equal opportunity.
@hboulware Every single teacher in every school in Finland has a master's.  Every. Single. One.  You think you're better than them?  Home of the free indeed.  Free to fail, from lacking simple school books, well paid and degree'd teachers, long enough hours in classrooms, high expectations.
@hboulware Dollars per student, are you high or low, Nationwide?  Why are you not aiming to provide world class education? Don't you want people to move to Oklahoma, knowing it's got great schools?  Opposite is happening now.  No chance I'd bring my kids there, high tech world coming at em.
@hboulware Show me another profession where having a doctorate earns you less money.  Besides, if you're a qualified person, what could entic you to go to such a small district? Only money.  And 100k isn't very much now for a highly degree'd manager.
@hboulware Still on 4 day weeks?  Still skimping out and cheating OK children out of a good education?  Is Oklahoma even trying to be number one? Why not?  Divinding that 50 mil by num students makes it pretty tiny.

@charliekirk11 GDP grows when we have more capital - HUMAN capital as well as financial capital.  GDP was shown to grow about 1.5% faster in the 1950's because of inward migration, largely from post-war Europe.  Immigration feeds GDP - some of the most motivated people are immigrants!

@sighnatasha Perhaps Mr. Nugent believes in the 90-gram soul assertion - that souls weigh approximately 90 grams, and that it's possible to measure the loss of this mass at the time of death.  First, Mr. Nugent would need to weigh himself...  lol.
@JustinColgan2 @NRATV @NRA @NRAILA @ChrisCoxNRA Perhaps they'd like to meet the thousands of people who have had loved ones killed with firearms?

@PolitiBunny Not all guns, just assault weapons.  We had the ban from 1986 to 1996, and it worked, with significantly fewer people dying from these weapons (and it was just on sale and manufacture, no confiscation).  This is not confiscation.  this is ban on further sales, and is reasonable.
@realmissbeeswax @LadyLNorth @chucktodd The central message of Christianity imho is compassionate loving-kindness, for everyone.  Saying it's good to be good on Good Friday hits that smack-dab center.
@hboulware To be fair, Ingraham attacks a lot of people like that, high-school-mean-bitch style.  Trouble is, she forgot Hogg is IN high school, and knows how to hit back &amp; effectively!  Don't yell at the prissy queen snob, take away her credit cards!
@hboulware @PolitiBunny No funding allowed, still.  No Funding means prevented from studying gun violence.  I think we all want less gun violence (excluding hunting and on the range).  So, NRA isn't representing us here.
@Red_State_Rebel Teddy Roosevelt: Great guy, but remember the KKK was huge in the USA in 1910's. Lots of lynchings. Every great person has not-great aspects, and some of his quotes can remind us of the rampant racism then. Unless- you want to seem racist? in which case, go ahead. Context matters.
@Red_State_Rebel If you remember, Hillary Clinton was attacked first in 1993 for proposing a Medicare for all health insurance change.  This would have saved me VAST money spent on premiums since.  Don't like her? Fine, but financially for me, that idea was great !

@hlsitton @NRA They are my business when wacknuts buy high-capacity magazines, alter their weapons slightly with bump stocks to make them weapons of war, and then go on a rampage in a public place.  Your rights stop where my life is actively threatened, and vice versa.  Common sense gun laws.

@edenrebecca32 @giu0807 Peace be with you. It is widely known that an effective grieving process includes telling stories. So, I encourage you to tell the stories, all of them, embarrassing or stupid or funny. Somewhere in that process is the religious concept of Bearing Witness. #MSDStrong
@CityLab @mattyglesias It was possible to advertise your apartment 2 only a set of people that were male, white, and Christian. This is a clear violation of federal housing law.

@nytopinion @Carmenr1Carmen In the 1950s, USA population grew naturally increasing GDP growth by that same percentage. This is one macroeconomic causation for higher growth in the 50s. China is experiencing massive growth in the cities, putting population to work in factories, and GDP growth shows this.

@maddow If we really want to punish Russia, we should interfere with their flow of natural gas to Western Europe by building lots and lots of wind turbines. It would have the side effect of being good for the climate as well so a win-win.

@robcorddry @realDonaldTrump As much as I'd like to agree with you, I think calling Donald Trump dogshit is an insult to the good and proper purposes that dog excrement serves.

@221bitter Of course, I believe in equal opportunity.  I lose privilege and power more from weak women than strong ones. We all have our reasons for being on this ship, arguing whether my reasons for being aboard are good enough is silly.  I'm glad we're going the same direction.
@221bitter @heyyguido @IrresponsibleC9 #Feminism benefits me. Yes, it does. Stupid-ass movies that train young women to be dependent on a man (e.g., Twilight), that's making us into Saudis. Half their population is prevented from doing basic tasks.  That'd mean more work for me. So, NO. Easier for me. Better for them.
@221bitter @heyyguido @IrresponsibleC9 Thanks! Yes, I did!  I get to decide what is sexy.  My wife says when I wipe up messes on the floor, that's sexy.  Sexy is eye of the beholder.  I like strong, competent, smart women.  Yes, that's sexy to me. Screaming at a mouse? Nope.
@LandenSmith11 @NRA So sorry you are participating in, and supporting an organization that freely Advocates giving murderous Psychopaths guns. Common Sense gun laws are just that: common sense.

@nerdist As a next-door neighbor to Wauconda, Illinois, I approve of this dessert!
@DanaGoldstein Rewarding teachers: more money if they get a master's in Ed, or pass qualification exams for teaching specific subjects / knowing lots of material, etc.  Part of job is giving inspiration - how to measure that? Perhaps is possible.  Rewards of teaching are usually non-monetary.
@DanaGoldstein The idea of merit pay for teachers has confused me.  To reward performance, great, but what if teacher starts with very tough/behind students?  Most improved? How to encourage genuine learning vs. teaching-to-the-test? Discouraging the teachers cheating?  Tough questions.
@DanaGoldstein You have 3 lives now.  ONE, with husband/partner, romantic or sedate.  TWO, work life with coworkers/friendly ppl/inimical misanthropes.  THREE:  You with your baby, an entirely different life perspective, separate, disjointed, cocooned.  ENJOY!  Mazeltov!
@thehill This is straightforward graft and should be investigated / prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  I don't care if DEM or REP, should be investigated / prosecuted  NOW.
@thehill Withhold judgement until evidence is in, but immediate resignation (depending on strength of allegations) is probably warranted and should be demanded.
@MicrObliterate @Emma4Change PTSD, iirc, is worst when it's unexpected severe fear of death.  There are specific ways to help this, medically.  ASK.  Living with PTSD (dreams/flashbacks/constant-low-fear) is avoidable and (I've heard) somewhat fixable. ASK YOUR DOCTOR. Applies to everyone, not just soldiers.

@JackBeN97732195 @WhiteHouse I like the idea of the @WhiteHouse twitter feed being a directly-run Russian-Troll-Farm account.  it would be much simpler if we knew that.  Then, we could just ask questions in St. Petersburg instead of the whitehouse press room.
@WhiteHouse Note:  infrastructure plan to include a sizeable amount of road-building in Russia, and have a rider specifying large weapons transfers to Russia.  Also, we admit defeat in world war II and say the Soviets did it all.
@thehill Now, watch the @GOP agree but define 'assault weapon' as only applying a blunderbuss fitted with brass inlays and clearly labeled in large letters, "Obamacare".
@bcallen22 @thehill Even as a leftist, I have to say, no.  Opposing tax breaks can be done for any reason.  That said, why is a government giving special treatment to any one company anyway?

@shannonrwatts @Delta is based in Atlanta.  Demographics says power in Georgia will shift from whites to blacks over the next 20 years, and with it from conservative to liberal.  This is happening all over the south.  Even Texas will be blue by the 2028 elections, population wise.
@jordanemilyy I know I'm 51 years old, intellectually.  I know I make a good living as a software engineer.  But, when it comes to doing handyman jobs for family and close friends, I work for cookies.  Someone makes me homemade cookies, I take notice.
