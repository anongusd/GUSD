@antoniogm 3/ And if, after investigating, you find that workers consider the moderation standards confusing and inconsistent, you report that too.  That‚Äôs the job of journalists. Even in the face of people who consistently demean it. Especially in the face of that.
@antoniogm 2/ There‚Äôs absolutely no journalistic hypocrisy in calling for moderation and then investigating to see how FB is doing it. If you find that FB is handing off the job to a low-paying people mill where workers are traumatized, and have too little time to pee, you report that.
@antoniogm 1/ But there‚Äôs a more ethical and responsible path. Halt the outsourcing. Hire the moderators directly. Choose seasoned people, not kids. Pay them a much higher salary, commensurate with the burden of the job. Treat them like other FB employees.

@Carnage4Life @nytimes No. I want the NYT and all paywall publications to recognize subscribers via whitelisting and send no advertising for the publication at all. None.
@robotterror @nytimes They can whitelist subscribers at the source when they subscribe. Using this whitelist, neither they nor their ad tech partners would advertise to you or target you for ads.
@SethGRosenberg @nytimes Wow. You really don't get it. What I want is no ads for subscriptions. None. I don't want ads targeted at subscribers. I want subscribers to be whitelisted so they receive no ads to subscribe, either in the app, on the site, or in email.
@fromedome @nytimes It's just a whitelisting issue, Dan. They already obviously have an ad tracking and targeting apparatus for customer acquisition. It likely crosses privacy red lines for me. But what I'm suggesting is simply that, once you are a paid subscriber, you get whitelisted and spared.
@amhdeleon @paulrobichaux @Carnage4Life @nytimes I want the @nyt and all other paywall publications to whitelist their subscribers and spare them from in-app and out-of-app messaging that is aimed at non-subscribers. It's pretty simple.
@robotterror @nytimes I'm not. It's about subscriptions, not advertising and not tracking. I'm saying create a whitelist of paid subscribers so you're NOT spamming them and NOT tracking them and NOT treating them like they're prospects.
@Carnage4Life They are different issues. I am a paying subscriber to the @nytimes, and to many other publications (whose survival I strongly support) yet they don't treat me as a customer, but as a prospect.

@bonnaud_dowell @chriswb Apple has cared about privacy for a very long time. Here‚Äôs a clip of Steve Jobs talking about it with me and @karaswisher back in 2010.

And, yes, of course, I read the whole article, which describes a creeping growth of privacy-robbing features as Facebook grew. My point is that way back, very near the start, when the service was a fraction of its current size, privacy was already expendable. Size wasn‚Äôt the key.
I respectfully disagree with this headline. I‚Äôve known Mark Zuckerberg for at least 12 years, and he‚Äôs never cared about privacy as most define it, IMO. Even when FB was much smaller. The turning point came in 2006 with the introduction of the News Feed. https://t.co/yR3Jx0mpGs

@gebloom I have no idea. You might be right. But, as you know if you read the article, it covers just the four major pro sports: NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL. And some teams in other sports had more impressive odds than the Patriots.
@gerryteri @markkahn Read the article. The author ranks two MLB teams much more impressive in odds than the Patriots, but both were Yankees teams of different eras, not the Braves.
@tompetz Also, remember that, when the Patriots were created in 1960, the Steelers had already been in existence and in the NFL for 27 years (since 1933).
@tompetz Read the story. But the author says this: "1974-79 Pittsburgh Steelers: four titles in six years, 38,000-to-1". The full six titles for Pittsburgh took 34 years vs. 18 years for New England - almost twice as long - so I'm assuming the odds were easier for the Steelers.
"The odds of the Patriots carving out this dynasty, with six Super Bowl rings since 2001, are 71,000-to-1. That is staggeringly high...A 71,000-to-1 unlikelihood makes the Patriots‚Äô dynasty easily the most impressive achievement in NFL history. https://t.co/y3FSqz7HjB

@patricknward @Patriots @RedSox Actually, the @Patriots and @RedSox fan bases weren‚Äôt so devoted. The Sox often played to less-than-capacity crowds in the bad old days, even in a small park.

@gogigupta @Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple 4/ But, as I noted before, this is really just chapter 10,000 in the decades-long battle by techie-oriented folks to put their interests ahead of those of average consumers, as they did in the old days. And Apple is their favorite target because it markets to non-techies.
@gogigupta @Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple 3/ It wouldn‚Äôt matter to me in the least if Apple cut its percentage to, say, 15% across the board, as long as its curation remained unchanged.
@gogigupta @Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple 2/ But, on Android, where alternate stores do exist in large parts of the world, I‚Äôm unaware that anyone adheres to these principles as well as Apple does. Please let me know if you discover one.
@gogigupta @Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple 1/ No mobile platform company today cares remotely as much about privacy and the consumer‚Äôs interests (as opposed to advertisers or vendors) as Apple. It‚Äôs certainly possible that an unknown company could care more or do it better.
@Python2121 @backlon @stevesi @Apple I can only assume you don‚Äôt recall the pre-iPhone era. It had nothing to do with VCast. ANY third-party developer desiring to offer ANY app on ANY phone had to pay nearly all of its revenues to the carriers. Apple radically changed that, creating the market in smartphone apps.
@stufalk It‚Äôs an *opinion* piece. Clearly labeled as such. It‚Äôs not supposed to be neutral. That‚Äôs what opinion pieces are for. Notice the big word ‚ÄúOpinion‚Äù Right at the top in the screenshot below. https://t.co/Px3PJ0oziL

@stufalk What‚Äôs vindictive about a recitation of facts done in Facebook‚Äôs own style? These are all  real events, and well documented.
@Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple It isn't a possibility of more malware. It's a certainty of more malware and worse things, like cyber weapons wielded by foreign powers. A certainty. By contrast, your prediction of lower prices on apps is just a possibility, since most apps are free or cost trivial amounts.
@Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple I too wish other platforms like webOS and Windows Phone had succeeded. But they didn‚Äôt. And making the internet accessible and safe for consumers matters vastly more to me than making it an easier place for techies to operate. That‚Äôs the heart of most of these debates.
@Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple I disagree. The internet has become a hotbed of crime, privacy theft and even cyber warfare. Apple isn‚Äôt perfect, but it tries to block these things. Fracturing of the app distribution system in the absence of any overriding problem that might justify it seems reckless.
@Noah_Feller @backlon @stevesi @Apple Depends on the Supreme Court‚Äôs application of our archaic antitrust laws. But I‚Äôll tell you that I‚Äôd never buy an app from any alternate store with lower standards than Apple‚Äòs, regardless of price. The oligopoly is a big problem. But scamming and malware are just as bad.
@backlon @stevesi @Apple You mean, just randomly, or because the market for quality or original apps has shrunk? Should the government mandate a lower price, because I‚Äôm a huge proponent of tech regulation, but even I don‚Äôt support price controls. There is a court case on this, though - as you know.
@backlon Echoing @stevesi, I‚Äôd note that when Steve Jobs announced @Apple would take only 30%, the room of developers erupted in applause. I was there. Why? Because getting your app on the deck in a phone before that required giving the carriers *most* of the revenue, often 70% or more.

There‚Äôs been no natural sports rivalry between Boston and L.A. since the Lakers and the Celtics traded NBA championships regularly in the 1960s and 1980s. But, in just the last 98 days, Boston teams have won both the baseball and football championships over L.A. teams. Amazing.

5/ My company isn‚Äôt the government. It‚Äôs allowed to have its own vendor policies. If customers and vendors don‚Äôt like those policies, they‚Äôll desert me. But I‚Äôm willing to take the risk. In fact, many customers trust me BECAUSE of my tough policies. So how am I the bad guy?
4/ Instead of focusing on Dole‚Äôs repeated breach of policies it has agreed to in writing, some complain that I have too much power. But do I? All I‚Äôm doing is setting and enforcing known policies in my own private-sector stores. And Dole is still selling everything elsewhere.
3/ Dole‚Äôs reaction is to relabel the banned product and then ship it again to all my stores. This time, I ban all their products in that one category for one day. It disrupts their operations briefly, even though they remain on the shelves of my of my bigger competitor.
2/ But Dole deliberately ships the test product to *all* of my stores, not 3. Plus, it turns out that the nature of the product violates my policies that Dole has agreed to. So I ban the product. (Note: I am not referring to the real Dole here of course. This is a  made-up Dole.)
1/ Thread. Here‚Äôs one way to view the Facebook/Apple dispute. Say I own a chain of 100 popular grocery stores. It‚Äôs far from the biggest chain, but folks trust it. Dole uses my chain to test new items. It wants to pilot a new kind of canned fruit at 3 of my stores, and I say OK.
@reckless @facebook @Apple @verge You‚Äôre never going to find a private entity, including Google or its hardware partners, that has no right to curate its platform or product. You curate the @Verge every day. @voxmediainc kills spammy ads when they‚Äôre reported.  Netflix decides what it wants to produce or acquire.
@mvigod @facebook @Apple Globally, Apple has less than a 15% share. That‚Äôs being dwarfed. As for the FaceTime thing, it was a bug, not a business model. And you should know the difference.
@reckless @facebook @Apple Of course there‚Äôs a choice. And the @verge, properly, covers all the options, even small sellers. Apple had under 15% of the global smartphone market and was a bit behind Android even in the U.S., the last time I checked.

@teddunne @jasongay Yeah, it was pre- Super Bowl.
@pcmulholland @rams @Patriots @RedSox @Dodgers I know. They move around a lot.
@teddunne @jasongay It‚Äôs not the same calendar year, or consecutive years, it‚Äôs the same season.
@teddunne @jasongay Hmmm...according to Wikipedia, the 1969 pro football championship game (played on 1/4/1970) was between the Browns and the Vikings, neither team being from NY or Baltimore.
I‚Äôm too young to get the Larry King reference, but I trust @jasongay. https://t.co/yRE8kIEwt3
@patricknward @jasongay Against the same opposing cities in the same season?
@scottknaster https://t.co/pqutVum4am
@scottknaster No, same means same, not consecutive. Boston and L.A. played for the championship of the baseball season that started in 2018. The same cities are playing for the championship of the NFL season that began in 2018. Both are considered the finales of their sports‚Äô 2018 seasons.
So, @jasongay: has this ever happened before? https://t.co/qRVQp6z6zm
@bennetkelley @rams @Patriots @RedSox @Dodgers But not against teams from the same opposing city, which is the distinctive feature here. So not analogous.
@scottknaster No, not the same. To match this, it has to be the same season.
...Makes me wonder whether teams from the same two cities have ever before played for the championships of two major pro sports at the end of the same season.
When the @Rams and the @Patriots take the field for the 2019 Super Bowl on Feb. 3, it will be only 98 days since the last pro championship game between teams from Boston and L.A. - the @RedSox victory over the @Dodgers in the 2018 World Series...

@oringordon @BostonGlobe They should do it like baseball. No coin tosses. Visiting team bats first (or plays offense, in football). In overtime, both teams get a chance, in the same order. Only downside: games can be endless. Game 3 in L.A. last fall went 18 innings, took 7 hours.

@bjshourt I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an excellent product in a technical sense. But, given what we know about Facebook, I‚Äôm amazed that anyone would put a camera and mic from that company in their home.

3/ These federal employees deserve to be paid. They deserve the chance to work. And, in an era of rising wages, they deserve a raise. Instead, Donald Trump is putting hundreds of thousands of families across the country - most outside DC - in financial jeopardy. It‚Äôs outrageous.

@Magnera_ Why? When it comes to privacy, the iPhone is part of the solution. Whether people can afford a top new model at $1000, or buy a cheaper model (including newly-built older designs) for much less, they will gain more privacy and security than by buying a cheaper Android.

@MichaelKitces @RobertStern Thanks. After 40+ years at the WSJ, with up-close knowledge of many companies, I became very wary of stock prices and therefore market caps as a metric - high or low. I saw that they often diverged from the realities of the real economy and of the real performance of companies.
@MichaelKitces Because everyday people can program the destinations and sometimes even preferred routes of driverless cars (‚Äúavoid toll roads‚Äù). Average investors have no input into the algorithms and formulae used by automated herd, unison trading. Instead, a black-box formula is in charge.
@MichaelKitces What it says is this: ‚ÄúRoughly 85% of all trading is on autopilot‚Äîcontrolled by machines, models, or passive investing formulas, creating an unprecedented trading herd that moves in unison.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just computers placing specific trades based on individual human instructions.
@MichaelKitces Please read the article.
@MichaelKitces Read the article, please.
Given this, it‚Äôs just lazy to say company X is a trillion-dollar company or company Y has doubled in value or lost half its value. It‚Äôs just algorithms trading on pre-set inputs. The part of the market that makes nuanced judgements about each company is shrinking fast.
This is a big reason why market caps, high and low, are a terrible measure of a company‚Äôs ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. The algorithms that decide the vast majority of trades are blind to individual corporate trends and fundamentals. They act with blazing speed on pre-set macro inputs.

@backlon It sucks. But when I bought my last two iPhones, at the Apple store, they said Verizon was the only major carrier that required its own SIM and a special rigamarole. On 1 of the occasions, they sent me me to the nearby Verizon store to activate the phone &amp; adjust settings.
@profgalloway @POTUS I know of absolutely nobody who sees Trump for what he is, and for what he‚Äôs done to the country - even in SD - who thought rising stock markets gave him a ‚Äúhalcyon‚Äù effect.
@backlon Sorry you had to do this on Christmas Eve, Dieter. But you seem to be blaming Apple when you make clear that this is carrier-specific, a function of the SIM, not the phone. You say with other SIMs on iPhones the setting are available. So if it‚Äôs Verizon‚Äôs fault. Why knock Apple?

Now, they behave like bank robbers. The market will decide what it‚Äôs worth to obtain the building blocks of that aggregation.
This is brilliant. https://t.co/ROhBITVJJQ
@antoniogm But you keep talking about selling data, a topic I haven‚Äôt discussed in this thread.
@antoniogm Oh, I‚Äôm not for excluding bloodsuckers like this tracking company you mention (which I know nothing about). It‚Äôs not just about Facebook. A federal privacy law would cover every entity surreptitiously tracking and profiling web users. But Facebook‚Äôs behavior has been egregious.
@patk @arrington @Scobleizer Very cool.
RT @patk: @waltmossberg a bunch of people (including me) thought deeply about this 11 years ago. cc @arrington @Scobleizer. The right thing‚Ä¶
@pt @jack_regan I agree.
@antoniogm @sarthakgh Not my problem. That‚Äôs the problem of businesses built on user data. Maybe they re-evaluate their business model. You might have to figure out how much to pay for your raw materials if you want to keep raking in profits. Most businesses do that.
I should add that, just as with other private property, you could outright decline to allow it to be used or transferred.
@davidjacobs You may see me there.
@jack_regan @pt That‚Äôs absolutely right. It‚Äôs easy to establish the distinction between other businesses and journalism in law. It‚Äôs distinguished in Fair Use laws, for instance. There could also be publicly accessible records of sales of data, as there are for houses.
@DosSantosDiasPR @facebook Download your Facebook data. It‚Äôs easy. And then look at the file and be appalled at how many companies have data on you. If you use Android, the file will even include your phone calls and text messages. And the download is likely incomplete, since can you really trust FB?
@antoniogm And the light goes on! Good. But not a rev share of the current auction system price. The payment to property owners - owners of personal data - should come first. FB would discover the price via the market, like every other business.

@antoniogm Well, with the Portal, Zuck is following some gullible people around with a camera. But that‚Äôs another thread. The point is that the open web exists. And FB is tracking me around it collecting raw material for his business without asking or paying. FB didn‚Äôt create the open web.
@antoniogm The market would decide. It might be small. It might be large. Doesn‚Äôt matter. They should ask, clearly and openly. And if the user (the owner) gives the info away, fine. If the owner wants money or some other compensation, then we have a market.
@antoniogm And you‚Äôre still on the question of selling data, which wasn‚Äôt what the Times piece was about at all. And it wasn‚Äôt what my tweets were about at all. I‚Äôm just a capitalist, saying my data is my private property and the law should clarify that it would be illegal to steal it.
@antoniogm I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre wrong, Antonio. I never said anything about FB selling my data. I was discussing how they - and others - obtain it surreptitiously without paying me for it. You‚Äôre right that they couldn‚Äôt sell nude photos of most people. The issue is: how did they get them?
In other words, your private information should be viewed as private property, which you can sell, rent, or give away,  if asked. In the U.S., we have 200 years of legal precedents on private property. Your data should be covered by those precedents.
And don‚Äôt be confused by the argument that you‚Äôre getting a ‚Äúfree‚Äù service in exchange for watching ads, like old-style TV or print. That would be a fair deal. It‚Äôs the secretive profiling, all over the Web, that must be banned. User permission &amp; compensation should be required.
This is so wrong. Facebook, Google and others simply appropriate highly detailed, highly personal information about us without any action that could reasonably be called notice or permission. We need a federal law requiring that they ask first and offer to pay for it if need be. https://t.co/QpFLwVHyDp

@SethGRosenberg @karaswisher Advertising in its old classic form is fine. Advertising loaded with, or based upon, privacy-stealing tech, is not fine. It's the heart of the problem. Or, one of FB's big problems.
@jimgable Never. Ever.
@SethGRosenberg @karaswisher The key to newspaper advertising was indispensable journalism, whether national and global, or local, or a combination. Advertisers wanted to be where that journalism was. That, plus classified ads, which Craig's List, not FB, killed.

@SewardTotty No, that's not the case, as I see it. I think our whole country, and other countries, have been affected adversely by Facebook's policies and actions. I am not quitting Facebook because I've been under attack there. I haven't been.
@wtomlinson No. Read the thread.
3/ I am hardly the first person to quit Facebook and I am not urging anyone else to do so, or trying to spark some dump-Facebook movement. Nor am I judging anyone who remains, or everyone who works there. This is just a personal decision about where online I wish to participate.
2/ I am also quitting Facebook-owned Instagram and Messenger.  I will remain on Twitter, and will continue to communicate via iMessage, email and SMS text with those who have my email address and/or phone number. Obviously, people who follow me here can also reach me via DM.
1/ Some personal news:  I've decided to quit Facebook around the end of the year. I am doing this - after being on Facebook for nearly 12 years - because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I‚Äôm no longer comfortable there.

@juanjoseluisgar Drag and drop is slower than just picking from a gallery displayed via an icon.

@HilzFuld My pics are stored in iCloud and all are available on the Mac. If I‚Äôm on the Mac for another reason, I expect to be able to use its core apps, like Messages, instead of reaching for the iPhone. And I expect them to be good.
@BonnieHausman No. I need a laptop for 10-20% of the things I do. My old one was on its last legs. This one is very nice. For the tasks for which I need it, the apps I use are fine. But, when I'm using it, I expect *all* apps that Apple itself writes to be good.
2/ One glaring example is Messages. Adding a photo to an iMessage you‚Äôre composing, from within Messages, is a breeze on iOS, but cumbersome on MacOS. How hard would it be to add a media picker or an attachment paper clip icon next to the text box on the Mac version?

@AdamThierer @megangrA Thanks for posting this. Sure, there were way fewer people online then than now. But, as you note, it was still an oligarchy. And it got much more concentrated after AOL bought CompuServe and Prodigy faded away. For awhile it was a duopoly between AOL and MSN.

1/ Before starting my tech column, I covered the deft and gutsy handling of foreign policy by the late President George H.W. Bush, &amp; his close friend, Secretary of State James Baker. They wrapped up the Cold War, took the reunified Germany into NATO, and drove Iraq from Kuwait.

@ShiraOvide @Microsoft @Apple @amazon Stock prices - high or low, rising or falling - are a poor proxy for company value in the real economy.

@ShiraOvide I‚Äôm glad for @Microsoft shareholders that the stock price is rising. But Microsoft‚Äôs value is in its products, its earnings, its employees, its customer satisfaction, its innovation. Market cap is a terrible way of valuing a company. That goes for @Apple &amp; @amazon too.

@backlon @stevesi @reckless iTunes has lots of options and features for techies and edge cases that hardly anyone needs today. I used some of them a lot in the 2000s. But no more.

@bt_hathaway @stevesi @craigmod I understand the limitations of iOS and the USB-C port for pro and serious amateur photographers. But most people are neither. Your example comes up often on tech sites and here on Twitter. It‚Äôs quite valid for you. But it means nothing to the vast majority of people.
Worth reading. https://t.co/eiak5nVydg
Excellent analogy, @stevesi. https://t.co/N9njqx0yZ0
@JasonCross00 @stevesi @craigmod And, by the way, my own use of my laptop has nothing to do with the examples you cited. It has to do with the fact that some app makers haven‚Äôt done proper iPad apps. Not many, just a few. But enough to justify a laptop purchase every 5-7 years. I‚Äôll upgrade my iPad much sooner.
@JasonCross00 @stevesi @craigmod To be clear, I‚Äôd have no problem if Apple added these capabilities. My problem at the moment is that people who do particular things on laptops, or who (like you and me) have gotten used to certain features on laptops, demand them on this new type of computer.
@JasonCross00 @stevesi @craigmod ...and I need none of those things. And didn‚Äôt before I retired. I don‚Äôt own a camera other than my phone. It has never even crossed my mind to use and external drive on my iPad. And I find that Photos meets my needs. You obviously don‚Äôt. I believe my use case is far more common.
@JasonCross00 @stevesi @craigmod As you say, the issue here is software. I personally prefer the apps written for the iPad to old desktop apps. I prefer the iOS nav and gestures to the old GUI navigation. Haven't used a mouse in years. Don't want old-style apps on my tablet. If you do, Surface is a great choice.
Teachers and journalists: if a @NewsLitProject news lit camp comes to your town, jump at the chance to attend. They bring the two groups together for productive professional development. If your town hasn‚Äôt hosted one, you might consider helping secure the modest funds needed. https://t.co/BxCJ3IcAxp
@stevesi @craigmod Apple DOES call the iPad Pro a serious computer, and it is.  While they compare sales &amp; raw specs, I‚Äôve never seen them call it a laptop. For me, it does most work things faster than a laptop. But I still do the rest on a laptop. Folks need the mix of devices that suits them.
@stevesi @craigmod Exactly. Most of these critics have a very particular point of view about what work is or what a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù is. And it usually doesn‚Äôt line up with what productivity means for the vast majority. I can‚Äôt tell you how much work I‚Äôve done on iPads. But my kind of work isn‚Äôt theirs.

@RyanOver There‚Äôs a tendency here among some to confuse the word ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù with the word ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù. A laptop is a particular kind of computer. So is an iPad, a smartphone, an Apple Watch. All of these supplanted the laptop for many - but not all - tasks, and added tasks they do better.

@stevesi 3/ I still stand by my first iPad review, from 2010, which talked about how it could take over from the laptop by being better or more convenient at specific common tasks. Not at specs, nor on everything you could do with a laptop eight years ago. https://t.co/gndgAs36zI
@stevesi 2/ They haven‚Äôt replaced the laptop. They‚Äôve replaced almost all the *scenarios* for which I formerly needed the laptop. I‚Äôd much rather grab one of my iPads for almost anything I need to do than use the Mac. I expect my new MacBook Air to be my last laptop.
@stevesi 1/ The most important word in your thread is ‚Äúscenario‚Äù. I ordered a new MacBook Air because I still need or prefer a Mac for some scenarios. But my most used, and favorite, computers, are my iPads (a Pro and a mini) and my iPhone X.

4/ Mac mini: didn‚Äôt test it as it isn‚Äôt really aimed at consumers.
3/ The new iPad Pro, in two sizes, is spectacular. Big bezels are gone. The USB-C port allows it to connect to more things. The keyboard case is vastly better. So is the Pencil. It‚Äôs wicked fast and fits bigger screens in the same or smaller overall sizes. Pondering buying.
2/ The MacBook Air, one of the seminal consumer tech products, has been rescued from neglect and updated. Everything from the display to the processor to the speakers is way better. It has TouchID and is a tad lighter and thinner. It‚Äôs fast and sleek and I‚Äôm buying one.

@profgalloway 4/ BTW, I‚Äôm not picking on you with this argument. I‚Äôve made it before with others. I just think you‚Äôre really smart and am surprised that you use market cap as often as you do in tweets and podcasts.
@profgalloway 3/ Market cap is a common metric, easy to state and compare. But, IMO, it doesn‚Äôt represent a company‚Äôs real performance or real value. And the focus on stock prices is a disaster for long term thinking. To me, there‚Äôs business, and there‚Äôs the market, and they‚Äôre not the same.
@profgalloway 2/ The stock market is often controlled by big traders with fast computers. And many, many of these traders aren‚Äôt buying or selling based on a company‚Äôs performance or fundamentals, but are mostly betting on what other traders will do, regardless of reality.
@profgalloway 1/ Thanks for the serious answer, Scott. I have no single go-to. That‚Äôs my point. But, after covering companies (not just tech) for decades, I believe the stock market and the economy are more divergent than people think.

@profgalloway @kitone Of course my words weren‚Äôt aimed at you. You interpreted them exactly right. If anyone ever decides to attack all those who partnered on any endeavor with @karaswisher, I will happily share the foxhole with you.
@kitone @profgalloway Your interpretation is wrong. Those words were aimed at lazy *journalists*, not at @profgalloway. He is not a journalist.
@gruber You‚Äôre right. But shhh!
@addygunners I think everything, including China, should be on the table. As I said in my first tweet, Apple isn‚Äôt perfect. It should be held to account for its own issues. But that doesn‚Äôt mean Cook‚Äôs speech isn‚Äôt important and right for democracies with the rule of law. China has neither.
@profgalloway But the two old guard tech companies- Apple and Microsoft- are very different on these issues than, say, Google and Facebook. Apple was founded in 1976 and IPO‚Äôd in 1980. Microsoft was founded in 1975 and IPO‚Äôd in 1986. They are ancient &amp; different in tech terms than the others.
@profgalloway You also know that Apple has done curation for many years, in the App Store and in its product decisions. It‚Äôs been criticized for this. But, IMO, it‚Äôs been right. Sadly, during the current techlash over privacy invasion and false news, lazy journalists lump all ‚Äútech‚Äù together.

@sethdashley @PeterD_Adams Since @Google doesn‚Äôt disclose its search or autocomplete algos, which is its right, or give users much granular control, which is bad, this is essentially an editorial decision by the company. It is 100% responsible and needs to fix this kind of misinformation.

This week, in 2001, the post-PC era began. Its full effects wouldn‚Äôt be felt for years. But, IMO, this was the start of the move in which the PC (or Mac) ceased being the essential digital device, used all day everywhere. Today, it‚Äôs the smartphone. https://t.co/13ORYUEBFm

Read this short thread about privacy. @Apple isn‚Äôt perfect, and we‚Äôre right to be skeptical of tech giants.

@patricknward @Dodgers @RedSox That‚Äôs very likely. Although, since the Senators had big gaps in their history and the Nats are so new and not truly a descendant of the Senators, some matchup or other with D.C. may not even have happened.
@stevencwebster @Dodgers @RedSox Boston won in 5 games.
@JVSylvester @ilovaussiesheps @Dodgers @RedSox I assume so. Also, in those days, even though Fenway Park already existed, the Red Sox chose to play home World Series games at the field of the N.L. Boston Braves, because it was larger.
The last time the @Dodgers and @RedSox met in the World Series was *102* years ago, in 1916, when the Dodgers were known as the Brooklyn Robins. Casey Stengel starred for Brooklyn and Babe Ruth was the pitching hero for Boston. Man, baseball has a long history. https://t.co/zpbbRJn3j5

@catalj22 Population does matter. Why? The biggest cities get extra chances to win because the leagues give them extra teams in each pro sport. NY has at least two teams in each. Greater LA has two as well. Chicago has two in MLB.
3/ ...and, while it‚Äôs way too early to tell, both the @Patriots and @celtics have reasonable chances of winning championships this season.
2/ Even if (heaven forbid) the Sox don‚Äôt win, 10 pro championships in 18 years is still incredible for a metro area that ranks only tenth in population in the U.S. and is about a fourth as populous as the rival NY metro area.
1/ The past 18 years have been the Golden Age of Boston pro sports. If the @RedSox win the World Series it would be the city‚Äôs 11th pro sports championship since 2001. That‚Äôs five Super Bowl wins, a possible four World Series wins and one championship each in the NBA &amp; NHL.

5/ Conclusion: the CEO may be a nice guy, but I am very happy to be back using Lyft starting tomorrow. (Note: I have no financial or other ties to either company.)
5/ We didn‚Äôt complain, because who wants hassles on vacation? But the irony was that their CEO @dkhos was on Canadian TV bragging about a research center he‚Äôs launching there. He needs to research actually picking up riders where they ARE, not where @uber would like them to be.
4/ In one case the @Uber app even drew a block-sized rectangle on its map to direct us elsewhere. By contrast, in my experience all over the U.S., Lyft almost always comes to me where I am.
3/ In Montreal, @Uber constantly: either thought we were in spots where we weren‚Äôt; tried to get us to walk to a different ‚Äúpickup spot‚Äù; and/or forced us to cross busy streets to get in the car. None of this was due to illegal or dangerous pickup situations where we were.
2/ After over a year of riding @lyft exclusively in the U.S., we had to use @Uber because @Lyft doesn‚Äôt operate there. And it was a far inferior service. We took at least a couple of @Uber trips daily, &amp; about 80% of the time, the service somehow screwed up our pickup location.

@johnywrites @reckless @backlon Who ever said his keynotes and launches weren‚Äôt produced by a team? Of course they were. And I‚Äôve never heard anyone suggest otherwise. Or suggest that he didn‚Äôt make the final decisions.
@reckless Watching this Steve Jobs iPhone 3G keynote again, I‚Äôm struck by 3 things. 1. @backlon is right that Apple is always about the story, a story of constant progress &amp; happy customers. 2. Jobs repeated everything 2-3 times. 3. Jobs usually attacked competitors head on, sarcastically.
@HilzFuld Hillel, I am so very sorry. You have my deepest condolences.

@kvox As always, I feel better when we agree.
@hemanthpulimi @LaurenGoode @reckless @JoannaStern @backlon Of course everyone should read every @backlon story and watch every @backlon video. I do, religiously. I‚Äôm a big Dieter fan. I was just guessing at who would be doing the main iPhone review at @verge.
@Thigs @LaurenGoode @reckless @JoannaStern Thanks.
These are my personal views and tastes, without the benefit of testing. Before you buy, read a detailed, honest review. I strongly suggest forthcoming reviews from @LaurenGoode, @reckless, and @JoannaStern.
Since some here have asked: I am not yearning for a smaller iPhone than the X or XS (though I support those who‚Äôd like the SE to be updated). And I don‚Äôt want a big screen either. The 5.8‚Äù screen in the X, in a body not much bigger than the older 4.7‚Äù phones, is perfect for me.
@triemilalim No. Not for me.
@CrippsCorner Actually this is a serious question. Both sizes are new.
I am buying the new Apple Watch. Haven‚Äôt bought one since the original and the new design and features look terrific and helpful. I am not buying a new iphone this year because I am very happy with the iPhone X I bought last year. Waiting for 2019.

@dobruno 2/2 Even the Max will have many fans, though I personally have never liked or owned the biggest phones. And I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcovering‚Äù these devices. I‚Äôm retired. Read @LaurenGoode, @reckless, @JoannaStern.
@dobruno 1/ You‚Äôre wrong. I think the X, which I own, is brilliant, and I assume the XS will be pretty much the same great experience. I assume many people will love the R, and that it will sell very well. The new Watch seems genuis!
@mixotic1 I was there in the room for that one. So, yes, I thought about it.
I agree. I know several people, including my wife, who adore the SE size. I suspect the move to all big iPhones is dictated by Chinese and other overseas tastes. But I‚Äôm with you guys. The SE should have been retained and upgraded. I also think women deserve real pockets. https://t.co/nIyMQLdE4H

5/ Conclusion: the best smartphone I‚Äôve ever owned or tested. Yes, it was too pricey for many, but I feel it was a good investment for me, especially since I don‚Äôt plan to replace it for at least another year.

3/ Convenience: roomy screen in a body I‚Äôve easily slid in and out of pockets for a year. Home button: what home button? The new gesture system is fast, natural and genius. I stopped reaching for a home button almost immediately. Screen: as brilliant as ever.
2/ Durability: no scratches or dents, despite several drops with just the same thin case I‚Äôve used for years. Cameras: best photos I‚Äôve ever taken, as good today as on day one. Face ID: works 9 out of 10 times so quickly that I can just ignore it and swipe to open.
1/ I know that next week Apple will introduce new,  improved iPhones. But here‚Äôs my one-year update on my 2017 iPhone X, which is still running iOS 11. Battery: still great, lasts more than a day. Speed and fluidity: as good as on day one.

You are right, @Happicamp. This isn‚Äôt about political views that we can debate.

@vladsavov @ShiraOvide With respect, nobody knows what perception stock prices reflect. The markets are dominated by short-term thinking and high volume arbitrage, not long-term desires to own.

Saying ‚ÄúI never vote‚Äù is just a dodge. Claiming ‚ÄúMy vote doesn‚Äôt count‚Äù is wrong, even if you are in a political minority. Don‚Äôt even try ‚ÄúI already marched/sent money/ signed a petition.‚Äù That‚Äôs great, but not enough. Vote like your freedom depends on it. It does. #NoExcuses
All of the usual excuses for not voting, especially in midterm elections, are bogus. Especially when we have an autocratic President with no checks and balances in the other two branches. If that concerns you, vote like your freedom depends on it. Because it does. #NoExcuses

The key to change is heavy, unified turnout on Election Day.
The Declaration of Independence, which we celebrate today, was adopted only after a long period of petitioning a tyrant to do the right thing. It didn‚Äôt work, so our founders had to take action. Today, that action is voting. So, get off the sidelines and vote. #noexcuses. https://t.co/KifcdnoZr1

@mims @BenBajarin Of course Apple is doing really well. So is Amazon. I wasn‚Äôt questioning that. I do strongly question the metric of market cap to judge how well any company is doing.
@BenBajarin @mims I think market cap is used as a proxy because it‚Äôs a simple, single number you watch change daily or hourly. But it‚Äôs not the same as business reality.
@mims Revenue, profit, growth, customer satisfaction, brand, innovation, competitive position, product roadmap, management, corporate values (like diversity, privacy, security, environment) - just a few, in no particular order. Shareholders benefit from this stuff.
@mims This is not about any particular company, but why do you consider market cap a good measure of a company‚Äôs success? We all know much of the money in the stock market is about bets on market arbitrage, not on well-informed faith in a company‚Äôs strategy, management or products.
@JohnPaczkowski Trump‚Äôs ex-cabinet members and lawyers plan to use that for reunions.
@stevesi Exactly! The First Surface has the right idea.
Fifty years ago today, I returned from the night shift at my summer job &amp; watched in horror on TV as Bobby Kennedy was murdered, in real time, right in front of my eyes. I was deeply forlorn, especially since it came on the heels of Dr. King‚Äôs murder &amp; the riots that followed. https://t.co/21mARES04R
@mikebc23 @Apple @Microsoft Full respect to @Microsoft, and to #Surface lovers. But I'm talking about something different. A clamshell that is wholly or mainly oriented towards modern tablet apps, not classic desktop apps. Microsoft has very few of the former. Apple has a zillion.
