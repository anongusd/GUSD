@MrBill108 It‚Äôs racist because it misrepresents the caravan as violent criminals when in fact the caravan is composed primarily of women and children. Seeking asylum is not a crime, they are refugees, not MS-13 and certainly not cop killers.

@TheBigBen76 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI 3.  Scope is fully determined by requesting official, again 45.  If 45 wants his kindergarten classmates questioned: so ordered.

@TheBigBen76 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI 1.  Twenty yrs federal LEO here, multiple clearances.  A background investigation isn‚Äôt a criminal investigation.

@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr A confirmation hearing isn't a court of law, it's the worlds most intrusive job interview.  It's not a matter of legality, its a matter of character.  If the hearing surfaces criminal wrongdoing, said crimes are prosecuted in the courts, not the Senate.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr How many federal background investigations have you been subject to and passed?  I know exactly what I'm talking about.  I've had my family, friends, teachers, former bosses all interviewed for my investigation. If a new allegation arose, a new investigation would have followed.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr And you didn't dispute my point about the backgrounds.  It's simple: new allegations require new background.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr How do you know its a farce? How about we see and hear from everyone involved under oath: the accused, the accusers, witnesses, and allow them to be cross-examined?  What's the harm in that? Why all the secrecy and hiding?

@whimzies4me @NBCNews Fed prisons are not a representative cross section. The FBOP (I worked for them btw) has a prison population of 181K vs 6.6mil in the states. Illegal reentry after deportation lands you in fed prison, not state, so that explains the 26%, not a crime wave.

@whimzies4me @NBCNews Keep getting your "facts" from a xenophobic hate group, I'll look elsewhere.  And that's not a link.  Its a pic, where from?  Yes, we spend tax dollars on illegals, I've yet to disagree with you on that. 		Illegals (absent children) do not get welfare, food stamps, or Medicaid
@whimzies4me @NBCNews 2/2 ....aren't going to subject themselves to law enforcement scrutiny.  They are actually more law abiding as a whole as legal citizens because of that very fact.
@whimzies4me @NBCNews I will concede most of what you had in your list to varying degrees.  However, illegals cannot receive the vast majority of federal benefits like welfare and food stamps. The only way it is possible is with a fake iD. And millions of fakes aren't out there because illegals.. 1/2
@whimzies4me @NBCNews And the DLs in the 12 states do not allow them to receive benefits.  Most have a distinctive marking on it that preclude benefits.   See for yourself.  If you don't trust the website, they have PDFs of the laws you can review for yourself.		https://t.co/8bxByC4GAb
@whimzies4me @NBCNews FAIR?  		They check out as EXTREME RIGHT BIAS on media bias watch dog groups.		They are also considered a HATE GROUP by the Southern Poverty Law Center.		They also have ties WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS.		So, your "source" is a joke.		https://t.co/ThtvU7Qb6p

@LisaSwartz8 @whimzies4me @NBCNews Much obliged for the assist.  There's tons of this out there readily available, but it doesn't fit the xenophobic narrative and thereby brushed aside as untrue.
@whimzies4me @NBCNews So millions have fake IDs to perpetrate fraud, thereby placing them in the crosshairs of LE? Because you have to have a valid ID to get benefits.They don't had out benefits to illegals, doesn't work like that.		SCOTUS gives the RIGHT to a free public education to all. Look it up.

@Deplorabelle @jasoninthehouse We‚Äôre talking about Sessions, not Mueller. I‚Äôm not seeing anything about Sessions in what you provided.  Maybe I missed it?  Are you proposing Sessions was planted by the deep state to help take down Trump?
@Deplorabelle You haven‚Äôt given any facts about Sessions.  Sessions refusing to skirt the law and unlawfully protect the subject of a criminal investigation makes him impartial, not part of the Deep State.  Protecting his boss would be more in line w conspiracy.

@Deplorabelle I see.		So what about the Republicans that made his appointments?  Bush 43? Rosenstein?  Where do they land in the world of the Deep State?
@Deplorabelle Mueller is also a Repub, appointed to lead the FBI by a Repub, also appointed Special Prosecutor by a Repub.  		So my question is this, is the Deep State a bipartisan organization?  So, the country can't be governed in the spirit of bipartisanship but it's destruction can be?

@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley The statute of limitations for felony sexual assault in Maryland has no expiration.  Just FYi.   https://t.co/D4GciPZdEb
@realDonaldTrump If you truly are the champion of transparency and expedited justice, then release your tax returns like every president before you did over the past four decades.  Show us that you have no financial ties to a foreign power that would impede your ability to govern.  We'll wait.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I think her primary concern is her and her family's safety.  She wants assurances she and her loved ones will be safe if she testifies.  Can't fault her for that.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It's clear that Dr. Ford knows she isn't getting the FBI involved.  As long as both parties get their chance to testify in front of the American people, I, as a citizen, will be satisfied.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley You should see my FB page.  LOL
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I love intelligent debate, I can do it all day so long as both parties show respect.  I bow out when it gets ugly.  Life is too short.  :)
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I applaud your civility and good manners.  It's refreshing. I'm sure neither of us see that a lot on Twitter.  ;)
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Well I guess I need to keep up on current events.  LOL
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It is the FBI's job if they are compelled to do so by the Prez.  Kav is Trump's nominee, Trump is the only one that can compel the FBI to open background investigation number seven.  But he won't.
@Champenoise46 @realDonaldTrump I just got out of bed.  I'm good.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I propose that they speak to witnesses, the accused, and the accuser.  They haven't done any of that yet.  They need to.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley No one has submitted anything under oath that I'm aware of in regards to the alleged incident.  The committee hasn't even met in session to discuss the matter.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley More than a letter.  Subpoena witnesses and put them under oath so lying has consequences.  Conduct an investigation, a real one.  If the facts can't be gathered and credible evidence cannot be obtained, so be it.  But an attempt needs to be made.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 4/4   No one is saying Kav should be prosecuted for a crime, only that the truth be uncovered so the American ppl know who they are putting on the bench.  Remember, confirmation hearings are not a criminal court, its a job interview and we want his full resume, all of it.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 3/3.  If, during the course of a background inv. it appears a crime has been committed and credible evidence is gathered, it is forwarded to the proper auth. in the proper jurisdiction.  In this case the SOL is long expired so criminal charges cant' be filed.  ......
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 2/2  ...and to find the skeletons if there are any.  Background inv. dig into everything, I know because I was fed law enforcement for 20yrs and had my background done every five years.  Jurisdiction is irrelevant in a background inv. because no one is on trial.   ......
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley You're fixating on it being a criminal inv., its not.  Background is nothing more than fact finding, to paint a pic of the nominees life, their character, actions, etc.  Confirmation hearings are a job interview where every detail of that person's character, integrity...  1/2

@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 2/2...	3.  Sex. harass. isn't a crime the FBI investigates, so why would they have jurisdiction simply because they were both fed employees?  	4. If the FBI can be prompted by the WH to investigate sex. harrass. claims, they can certainly investigate an alleged attempted rape.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 1. Placing the letter in the file is not a thorough investigation. Interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence is.	2. The FBI didn't have jurisdiction in 1991 because they were fed employees, they had jurisdiction because the WH gave it to them. 1/2...
@RepRalphNorman Shame on you for making jokes about a rape allegation.  You should apologize and resign.   You are a bad person.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 2/2.   If credible evidence of a crime is uncovered in the course of a background investigation, the FBI can open a criminal investigation.  But, jurisdiction as you pointed out, does not apply and the matter would be given to the State.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Confirmation hearings are not a court of law to mete out justice,  they are job interviews conducted by the American people by way of the Senate.   The FBI conducts background and if so ordered by the prez, can reopen the background to follow up on allegations.    1/2 ......

@ldsknack @senorrinhatch A confirmation hearing isn't a court of law, its a job interview for lack of a better term and the Senate literally is a representative body of the public: "We, the People."   We are the ones conducting the job interview by way of the Senate.  Nothing is really "standard."
