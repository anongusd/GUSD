Tomorrow, we have the opportunity to continue building toward greater prosperity for all Americans or to return to the dismal Obama/Pelosi economy.
Tomorrow’s election is about your family’s economic opportunity. It’s about your ability to choose the best health insurance option that works for you. It’s about better jobs, higher wages, lower unemployment, fewer regulations, and lower taxes.
The Democratic Party has run an entire campaign based on their opposition to our President. They offer no clear policy platform. This is not a mistake. They will do exactly what they did during 8 years of Obama. Nothing new. Nothing good.
As the only economist in Congress, it has been my honor to help leadership steer America back to economic prosperity. We cannot stop now. Everything we gained can be lost if we go back to the policies of the past.
The media is making this race about red and blue waves, but the real story is how an economics professor went to Washington to work with the majority to rebuild the American economy.	https://t.co/zMwloW8h1T
Spanberger has delivered no details for her agenda, while claiming to be independent. Is she not just waiting for Democratic Leadership to provide her real agenda? $10 million in corporate and party-driven donations. Is she really "independent?"
Thank you, Sheriff Leonard, for this vote of confidence. I look forward to continuing to work with you to keep our communities safe. #VA07		https://t.co/VnQQ3VeOwR
At the end of the campaign, Abigail Spanberger is running on what policy platform? Can you name three points?? If you can't, isn't that a problem?

Democrats are using the nine pages of Obamacare that deal with pre-existing conditions to defend the entire law -- all 961 pages that have raised your premiums 150% in the past five years and led to $5000 deductibles. That's not good policy. https://t.co/qGk1cf76b0

Abigail Spanberger’s $32 trillion health care plan would expand Obamacare &amp; double our taxes, bankrupting Medicare in the process. Americans can’t afford another health care disaster &amp; Virginians can’t afford Abigail Spanberger. Watch our new ad here: https://t.co/uXbRX1rNio
On @AmericaNewsroom this am talking with @BillHemmer: "My opponent says the economy's not doing well, the tax cuts didn't work -- if you just look out the window you can see the truth of the matter."	https://t.co/x8MOv6nebp
Spanberger cannot hide from the fact that her campaign is funded by far-left special interests: $2.2 mil from Act Blue, $337k from House Victory Project, and $562k from House Majority PAC.
I was elected because I promised to uphold the Republican Creed and to be an independent voice for the 7th District. Even Spanberger has pointed to the many bad bills I voted against because they were wrong for the 7th District.
My opponent has repeatedly attacked me for returning more of your hard-earned money back to your families and millions of dollars back to communities in the 7th District. #GOPTaxCuts
Spanberger says, 'Voters must know that their elected representatives are focused on serving them, not special interests...not anyone, but the voters'. Yet the vast majority of money supporting her comes from outside the 7th District.
Schools, Infrastructure, and the Environment are funded mostly by the state and local governments. Our Tax Cuts have given them massive surpluses. Raise taxes and you'll see projects aimed at improving the schools, roads, bridges, and environment slashed back to nothing.
Tax Cuts have brought massive surpluses to our State government. Surpluses necessary for improving our schools, funding our state police, and rebuilding state infrastructure. My opponent wants to take all that money away from Va and give it to D.C. bureaucrats.
Moderate Democrats no longer have any power within their party. The radical left-wing of the party, controlled by Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren is in firm control of the Democratic agenda.		https://t.co/TrohMvUaXH
On immigration, you have a clear choice in this race. Instead of putting violent criminals in jail or deporting them, my opponent has defended gangs and wants to join our governor in providing sanctuary for them in Virginia. https://t.co/Gs7BbiKxVS

A vote for Dave Brat is a vote for a pro-business environment that allows our small businesses to grow and thrive. https://t.co/RFwlSvYWlU
I have always been an independent voice for the 7th District. I've stood up to both Democratic and Republican leadership when I felt they were wrong. Spanberger will have to do whatever Pelosi tells her to, or watch all her money and support go away.
Never before in a debate have we seen a candidate for Congress take so few positions. Spanberger told some stories about her family and spoke about bipartisanship, but outside of her support for universal background checks on guns and government healthcare, she had no positions.
Americans, after 2 years of Nancy Pelosi's left-wing agenda, sent a very clear message to D.C. They didn't want it. Republicans won the House, the Senate, and the White House. All in response to Pelosi's liberal agenda that kills jobs and hurts American workers.
So, if the choice was between Nancy Pelosi and Republicans, would Abigail Spanberger, who has said at least three times since July that she would “under no circumstances” vote for Pelosi -- vote for Republicans? For @Jim_Jordan? 		https://t.co/M0IPOh5sHi
Abigail Spanberger's campaign depends upon the support of Democratic Leadership and liberal special interests. Is there any doubt that she'll do as they bid her if elected? She has no choice but to be a rubber stamp for the radical Pelosi agenda.
Abigail Spanberger says that she's against deficits. She's also for all kinds of expensive Democratic legislation. To increase spending without running deficits, Spanberger must require the largest tax increases on American families in US history.
"Spanberger gets very upset when I point out that, should the Democrats regain control of the House, she'll be a rubber stamp for the Nancy Pelosi agenda, but she never takes any positions opposed by Pelosi. Strange."
Tonight's debate left voters with 1 question: do Virginians want proven results or radical resistance? #VA07Debate #VA07 https://t.co/5klJIIe3C6
The ultimate irony is Abigail Spanberger &amp; Democrats calling for lower deficits when all they want to do is add more government programs &amp; contribute to the skyrocketing national debt. #VA07Debate

My opponent said bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, which we had. And yet, the Dems said no to every rational compromise. What part of the Goodlatte bill does my opponent not like? #VA07Debate
My opponent is for sanctuary cities, which Gov Northam has also supported. Do you want to turn Richmond into Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco? Gov. Northam along w/ Nancy Pelosi &amp; Abigail Spanberger want to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants. #VA07Debate
My opponent is wrong on the fact w/ preexisting conditions. She's in favor of Medicare for All, ending medicare as we know it. That's a $32 trillion increase, doubling your taxes. A vote for Abigail Spanberger is a vote for the Nancy Pelosi agenda.
On health care: Obamacare was a disaster. It wasn't cost effective. Under Obamacare prices went up 150%. You don't do competition by a full double down on government takeover. #VA07Debate
There's so much college debt but a shortage of jobs for these graduates. We need to encourage alternative pathways for students.
A 4 yr college is not for everyone. In VA's 7th district, a truck driver makes $65k. There's a shortage in skilled workers for jobs our businesses have open &amp; we need to make sure our children are ready to fill them.
We have huge moves we can make in education. Last year, we improved K-12  education mandates &amp; gave more choice back to the states. And this year for higher ed, we did a bill for kids to follow new and improved paths. #VA07Debate

Democrats complain that folks with preexisting conditions paying more for insurance is discrimination, but under Obamacare all Americans saw increases up to 150% over five years. Who's discriminating against whom? I'm for more affordable insurance alternatives. Democrats are not.
Revenues are up. Wages are up. Unemployment is at historic lows not seen in half a century. Our economy is BOOMING. The Republican tax cuts were not a gimmick. Virginians are better of today thanks to our pro-growth agenda in Congress. Spanberger would reverse our success. https://t.co/ZNM4460QHu

What do we really know about Abigail Spanberger? She would roll back the tax cuts that are helping Virginia families and be a vote with Nancy Pelosi to stop the American economic comeback.
The economy is ROLLING and families in Virginia’s 7th are reaping the benefits. Abigail Spanberger wants to repeal the tax cuts and take us back to the Obama economy.

Thanks to a doubling of the standard deduction and lower tax rates, 90% of Americans saw bigger paychecks this year.
There were more job opening than job seekers in June. Wages are ticking up. Hispanic and African American unemployment are at record lows. Will Spanberger join her Democratic colleagues in reversing our economic growth?

Will Spanberger double taxes to pay for her healthcare plan? How many new regulations is she planning on springing on our doctors and nurses?
Republican legislation has helped reduce online advertising for sex trafficking. Has Spanberger developed a position or plan to deal with these issues? Or will her "new tone" magically solve the problem? New tones don't help women and children or create jobs.
Unemployment is at record lows. Wages are ticking up. More Hispanics and African Americans are working than ever before. Will Spanberger join her Democratic colleagues in reversing our economic growth?
Women business owners are more optimistic about the economy than ever before and we're seeing more African American millionaires today. Will Spanberger undo this with higher taxes and regulations?
The 7th District knows where I stand on the issues. Why is Spanberger so silent when it comes to specifics? Are her plans really that unpopular that she has to keep them secret? Maybe she could run fewer ads and answer more questions?
The 7th District should not have to vote for a candidate in order to find out what they stand for. Spanberger should tell the 7th District where she stands on the issues. Instead, she runs deceptive ads trying to trick the voters.
Is Spanberger a vote for impeachment? Why isn't the economy at the top of the Democrats agenda? Are they more concerned with impeachment than American workers and the middle class?		https://t.co/kidgRrnMhO
Many women and young girls have been caught up in the horrors of sex trafficking. While Republicans work furiously to end this scourge, Spanberger only talks about "a new tone" in DC. Will a new tone help these women and young girls?
Republicans have removed painful taxes and regulations to unleash the economy. Does Spanberger support our economy-growing tax reforms or will she raise taxes and impose painful regulations on American businesses?
72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017. Many from fentanyl that has poured over our southern border. Spanberger has been silent on what to do. Will she end I.C.E. and unleash chaos on the border?

CNN and major media networks had been reporting nonstop on the family reunification issue. But rather than report on a national headline, RTD reports on a stint of street theater by liberal performers.
The real story here is that a group of activists embarrassed themselves by protesting an issue that Rep. Brat is fighting hard to solve with a bill he introduced in Congress 2 days before. Rep. Brat’s bill is a companion bill to the very popular Sen. Cruz bill by the same name. https://t.co/hAxISwKmNk
