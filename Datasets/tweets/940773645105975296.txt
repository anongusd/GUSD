@LarryScott1919 @CynthiaNixon Government price controls are not wise, not rational, and not sound. The rent control law has existed for seven decades and has only prolonged the affordability crisis in New York.  The rent control law, which makes the housing shortage worse, is the problem.
@NYMediaCritic I want everyone to vote for me -- but more importantly, I want to actually fix the problem with policies that work -- not bad government regulations that make the problem worse. Good intentions don't equal good policy, my friend.
@MLNY @CynthiaNixon Mike, her plan would make NYC's housing shortage worse, and would bring investment to a screeching halt.  The only way to solve NY's affordability crisis without exacerbating the housing shortage, is to allow the market to produce a greater supply of units.

Cuomo and Percoco ran the Governor’s office like the mafia - with bribery, a pay to play protection racket and a life long membership that punished individuals who tried to leave. /4
As legislative leaders and candidate’s for Governor I’m calling on Senator DeFrancisco and Leader Kolb to take long overdue action in Albany. /3
It’s time for our elected leaders in Albany, from the legislature, to the Attorney General to the Comptroller to stop enabling Cuomo’s reign of corruption. /2
