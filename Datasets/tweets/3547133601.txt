@lance_bray @GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The caveman gif was in reference to people using flip phones. You said you don’t use a flip phone, so I’m not sure what your issue is. It was a joke, do you not have those in KY?
@lance_bray @GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Either you can afford something or you can’t and opt for payments. If you can’t afford the 50$ a month payments then that sounds like a personal issue. Either way spending money on a wall or illegal people have nothing to do with that.
@lance_bray @GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump What did I call you? Lol. Sorry if I hurt your feelings. How would illegal people stop you from spending 1500$ on a phone?
@lance_bray @GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Bud if you want to generalize more than half the population then that’s up to you, if you want to choose ignorance then that’s up to you.

@jconk46044 @whodatbevo @BrianKolfage @DeplorableChoir @RyanAFournier Good luck with that Joan. Spend all your hard earned money you’d like, but it’s a 100% a waste.

@graceligon @Ewwjr53 @SamdelASR787 @whodatbevo @BrianKolfage @DeplorableChoir @RyanAFournier That’s fine, but just because there are people who support it, doesn’t meant that the people who physically own the land will sell their property, or won’t contest an eminent domain claim.

@Staticrockers @NBCNews So anyone who “opposes” POTUS shouldn’t have their clearances revoked? #ThatsAFascistRegime
@stephenlegath @NBCNews If you are needed to confer on a specific situation. It could take a year to get approved for your clearance again. That doesn’t seem plausible in cases of urgency. Also lots of people who are not government employees have security clearances, including teachers and engineers.
@MarLado I saw that they finally released it. Thx for the share tho. It does seem like this was pre meditated.

@cosmos_griffin @RodneySeeking @CBSNews By no means is this a perfect state but if you’re a citizen, then complaining on Twitter isn’t improving anything. Volunteering at local shelter is a start, or even dropping of some necessities would help. It’s better to pitch in, instead of standing around bitching.
@cosmos_griffin @RodneySeeking @CBSNews You repeatedly stated incorrect “facts.” I was just correcting them. California could do more to help our homeless. We have a lot of programs but they aren’t always easily accessible. A lot of our homeless suffer from mental illness and there not a lot in place to address that.
@RodneySeeking @cosmos_griffin @CBSNews The states with the highest rate of homelessness are Hawaii and New York followed up by California. So even though California is the most populated state they don’t have the highest homeless population.

@missmagnoliamom And yeah you definitely don’t understand bigoted.

@missmagnoliamom Of course you claim to be a religious person. Lol. What’s funny is the so called “followers of Christ”on twitter are the most judgmental. Your judgement day is going to be a reckoning.
@laura1909marie You only give advice is someone asked for it. Lol. I bet your friends and family love all the “advice” you bestow upon them unsolicited.
@ChristianPojoga Because your child needs to eat. Dude you are gonna have a interesting time when you have children. At the very least make sure whoever you decide to have children with, shares your views, otherwise there’s going to be a lot of arguing in your future.
@laura1909marie I’m upset for all the woman that you are trying to shame in public for feeding their children. You’re a sad and repressed. But feel free to talk all the shit today and go to church and pretend to be a good Christian. ✌🏻
@ChristianPojoga And no one I’ve ever met breastfeeds in public for the attention. You do it cuz you’re baby is screaming and hungry. Basically it’s to each mom to do what they are comfortable with and none of us should be judging, or making them feel bad for what they are doing.
@ChristianPojoga Are you a parent with a breastfeeding wife/gf? If you are then you understand sometimes you have to feed in public settings, it’s 111 where I live today and no I’m not putting a blanket on a baby. Most woman are discreet, but men will still stare.
@laura1909marie @Puck6T9 @Equilan @missmagnoliamom @FoxNews You literally liked a comment by a pervert who wants to stare and lick his lips! Lol. Yeah you’re on the right side of things.

@Puck6T9 @Equilan @laura1909marie @missmagnoliamom @FoxNews You also have the less creepy option of not looking, and leave the woman and her baby alone. Most woman are discreet about it, but men will still stare and wives/girlfriends will get angry and blame the breastfeeding mom for being “inappropriate.”
@OKmomx3 @laura1909marie @missmagnoliamom @FoxNews You literally just shared more than most mothers breastfeeding in public. Breast’s were created for the purpose to feed children, everything else is secondary. If you’re a mom, then you understand it’s the hardest job out there, and everyone could use less judgement.

@Bad_Brad1234 @FoxNews How is the government controlling you, when civilians are suggesting that gun owners, store their guns responsibly and make sure that it’s never able to be used by a child through your own neglect?

@therealbertpmro @FoxNews @RandPaul And I’m a sick person for wishing your kid and all other kids don’t get shot?
@therealbertpmro @FoxNews @RandPaul Dude this conversation spurned from comments by Rand Paul about a school shooting. You have a kid, who’s going to go to school in America. This is his and your reality.
@therealbertpmro @FoxNews @RandPaul Dude at the end of the day, the beautiful kid in your pic, won’t be protected by your rights or my rights to own a gun. He looks like he’s going to be school age soon, that should terrify you. Rand Paul doesn’t give two fucks about your kid.
@therealbertpmro @FoxNews @RandPaul Speaking as your hypothetical “little person” no one has come for my guns. I still have all my rights in tact. Has someone come for yours?
@therealbertpmro @FoxNews @RandPaul And he talks about celebrities being guarded by armed guards, yet he walks the halls of the capital building, where his office is, protected by armed police officers. He’s a hypocrite.

@RobertS71494497 @FoxNews It’s Fox News’ way of trying to smear Romney, to avoid him running against Trump in 2020.
@67sanmartin @FoxNews A brick and mortar business is different than a political campaign. These ppl represent you daily. So they become synonymous to you as the candidate. As a boss if you found out that one of your employees was a rapist, or serial abuser, would you keep them as an employee?
@RobertS71494497 @FoxNews There’s not a state that a sexual contract would hold up in a court of law. It was consenting until it wasn’t. I hope you understand the difference. If you are in the middle of a sex act with a person who gave consent, is allowed to say no I change my mind, and you have to stop.
@67sanmartin @FoxNews Also sexual abuse, physical abuse and verbal abuse are not specific to a political party.
@67sanmartin @FoxNews While that’s technically true, employees are a reflection of the boss’ character judgement. I’m more interested in the actions that are taken once these things are brought to light. In Trumps case, he just rehired Rob Porter for his 2020 campaign.

@DanielBundyDB @FoxNews I’m pretty sure there is no specifics on paying the debt in this bill. This bill adds over a trillion to it, on top of the 1.5 trillion from the tax cuts, we are upwards of 3 trillion added in the last 18 months.

@_RainyDayWoman @MeganBrogue @FoxNews @dbongino So you don’t trust the police? Lol. The GOP narrative sure has changed. I had to wait 10 days for all guns I own and it was fine. A waiting period is a proven method to deter someone from committing a crime if that’s their intent.

@KAG_VA4Trump @RepMattGaetz I itemize as an independent contractor for my second job. I just did my taxes and lost the ability to claim a lot. It was worse than I was expecting. I don’t think they took in to consideration the people who depend on the ability to itemize.
@MeganEllyia I’m glad to see them turning their thoughts and prayers in to actions.
@MeganEllyia I was thinking the same thing as I watched the teens across the nation. Columbine happened when I was in 10th grade. I remember being scared, sad, angry and uncomfortable with the emotion that I had for complete strangers. I wanted to help them, and I was told to pray for them.
@gw_hope @USATODAY You should work in PR, cuz that’s one hell of a spin.
@3809ps @Vince_van_gay @adviIlavigne @NBCNews The point of the walk out is that a bunch of kids had their choice made for them as well, by being shot to death. I’m a proponent of the 2A but the students deserve the right to make it to adulthood and choose for themselves.

@FoxNews Did you only post this story because it took place in CA?
@WeWantConorLamb @Morse4America this is a great idea. Especially in Calaveras and the more rural areas that are in the 4th.
@dmac936_dylan @BeckiiAalto @FoxNews @POTUS And Iowa and Pennsylvania have the highest corporate tax rate. You are correct in that CA has the highest income tax rate. Your accuracy is like 7%. Lol
@dmac936_dylan @BeckiiAalto @FoxNews @POTUS Ca has a state surplus (not in debt) Alaska has the highest unemployment.  Louisiana is the highest in food stamp recipients. Hawaii has the highest homeless population. All of your “facts” are false.
@irritated_chap @SusanEvelynHE @FoxNews @POTUS We also have a huge state surplus. We are a donor state, which means we pay more in federal taxes that we receive. We have the worlds 6th largest economy and largest agricultural industry of all states. And with the taxes on marijuana, it should cover our bullet train no problem.
@JohnQMajors @FoxNews If you don’t do what the flight attendants say, they can deem you non cooperative or combative. Which can force the plan to be landed and you get arrested and charged with a federal crime. With that being said, this liberal Democrat would have fought tooth and nail for my dog.
@SBelle1950 @kevintripp @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JerryBrownGov California has a huge surplus.

@Colleen07071964 @YellowRoseTX59 @DesertGables @GOPChairwoman Your bio says you’re an RN, I’m not sure how your taxes didn’t go up. RN’s in my state can make over 100k a year. I very clearly stated that I was happy for the ppl, that got a tax cut, but I didn’t.
@Colleen07071964 @YellowRoseTX59 @DesertGables @GOPChairwoman Wtf are you talking about? You’re  complaining to me about me supposed complaining? I made a statement that my taxes have gone up. That’s called a fact. #IronyIsLostOnYou
@ianbremmer Of course he has! The scary/hilarious thing is, how much @POTUS is probably considering it.
@Oregontider You might live in the wrong city bud, I think Alabama might be more along your comfort zone. Keep it weird Portland!
@Oregontider And my state has the 6th largest economy in the world. If you think it’s just lettuce then you might want to brush up on your agricultural economics.
@Oregontider But you’re cool when it’s an American dude doing the raping and killing?
@Oregontider So are you upset that a innocent person was attacked or that it was done by an illegal immigrant? You responded to me, I was just letting ppl know most Dems don’t want gang members roaming the street. I’m not sure why you can’t accept that or it just goes against POTUS’ narrative
@Oregontider Market and rely on immigrant workers. I don’t get why it’s ok for Trump abd his family to keep requesting immigrant visas but when we want them, it’s wrong?
@Oregontider They were alerting the people who haven’t committed crimes, who work and have children. I’m not saying it was exactly right, bcuz I’m sure there were ppl who have committed crimes that got away as well. But it’s a two way street, we have a huge ( the largest) agricultural
@Redsmom5 Sorry I’m done.
@DesertGables @GOPChairwoman That may be true. And I’m glad you got a little back. I wish everyone did.
@Oregontider The gang has been around since the 80s, the on,y reason it’s front and center bcuz it’s a talking point to get ppl riled up for or against immigration. But to be clear, no democrats want murderous gang members roaming the streets.
@Oregontider Our politicians don’t want to waste our state surplus and send or police, sheriffs and chp in to do the job of ICE. We also don’t want Americans racially targeted and harassed. But yeah most would get behind a task force to eliminate MS-13.
@kwquigg @Redsmom5 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 See the difference is, you want mine and my husbands money because you have no integrity. With one transfer I could get a forced apology. Why would we want someone with your scruples making any financial decisions for us? Every person is a potential client or a current one.
@kwquigg @Redsmom5 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 I wonder how many people have re-evaluated their portfolios, based on your actions? It’s a small world, and you never know who your investors are. I’m sure you even have some of those “types.”
@kwquigg @Redsmom5 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 And the picture that was provided was cropped and didn’t show his full face, so that’s the epitome of a false narrative.
@kwquigg @Redsmom5 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 You’re the one who’s attacking people. I wonder how your clients at Exponential feel, about how you treat complete strangers on a public platform. And I’m sorry if the word Fuck insults your strong morals of insulting people on the internet.
@DanaBougon @GOPChairwoman Lol cool. That will keep me up at night ✌🏻
@kwquigg @Redsmom5 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Fuck you dude. I could give a shit the “type” you think I am. And I don’t owe anyone a mea culpa. The picture was cropped and had his head purposely cut off. @redsmom5  sharedthe entire photo from another persons account. But way to be a douche and make assumptions.
@OwoJets @GOPChairwoman That makes absolutely no sense. But props to you, for dumbest tweet of the day 👏🏻
@nosurrender4me @GOPChairwoman Awesome for you if you got a big cut, im absolutely not saying we all don’t deserve it. I was just upset because I didn’t.
@nosurrender4me @GOPChairwoman Literally nothing has changed in my state tax laws. I also itemize, and my 2nd job is classified under independent contractor. So i lost the ability to claim a lot.
@Redsmom5 @FrontRowJo @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Thanks for clarifying. I didn’t read the entire thread and don’t follow the other person.
@MishMashB1 @Tennesseine @RepJoeKennedy @KamalaHarris I definitely didn’t mean any disrespect in reference to his age. I like him and his political views, I think we just need a shake up.
@Redsmom5 @FrontRowJo @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Ok this is a completely different photo than what was posted. On a different persons account. Either way in this context, it looks like remembrance ribbons. My school wore them for Columbine.
I’d like to be clear and set the record straight. As a Democrat, I don’t want to protect MS-13, as Trump just stated. Feel free to coordinate with gang task forces and round up all of the MS-13 gang members.  But don’t use it as an excuse to racially profile people.
@Tennesseine I like a  @RepJoeKennedy and @KamalaHarris ticket. I like Joe Biden but he’s a little old and by the time the race is here, he’s gonna be even older. 🤷🏼‍♀️

@danieldemer That really sucks.
@danieldemer So they aren’t bringing it back, or doing a 2 hour ending?
@FoxNews I love how no one is mentioning Whitefish, and their mismanagement of getting the power grid up. Yes PR has had financial issues, but they are Americans and deserve to be treated accordingly. No one mentioned anything about Florida and Texas’ financial situations.
@farmdwg @RepJeffDenham The fact that we are spread out is why it will work. Obviously you don’t want it, but there enough people who do, so I hope you will be able to embrace it. I do think they need to get more organized and narrow down the budget.
@farmdwg @RepJeffDenham I also wonder how many ppl fought against cars, and then trains and air travel because they were afraid of change. Other developed countries already have high speed rails, we are behind the times.
@farmdwg @RepJeffDenham I used to commute everyday on the ace from Stockton to Livermore. It was a much better alternative than driving 205 and 580 everyday. Our state has a huge surplus, and it’s going to get even bigger with the sales tax on marijuana. Why not invest in innovative travel?
@linda_cambareri @RepJeffDenham *they need to get more organized and stay on budget.
@linda_cambareri @RepJeffDenham It creates the ability to commute hundreds of miles in a fraction of the time. Most other developed countries have high speed rails to help with travel. The US and Ca need to quit living in the past. I do agree they need to get to get more organized and on budget.
@farmdwg @RepJeffDenham Are you kidding? Do you know how many ppl commute everyday? You live in Modesto, I’m sure you’ve been on I-5 or 99 at peak traffic. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to eliminate that a little?

@RepJeffDenham I ask myself all the time “when is enough enough, with Jeff Denham?” A high speed rail opens up the state and progresses us forward. Would you like to bring back covered wagons, oil lamps and coal plants? Oh wait....

@vbrookdebbie @SNRevolution My point was, California is not as bad as ppl want to make it seem. We are all Americans and have to start finding some kind of common ground. My mom was also a single mother who devoted everything she had to raising myself and my brother, so I understand.
@vbrookdebbie @SNRevolution Lol ok. Well I’m sorry that it was so horrible you felt like you needed to leave. I grew up dirt poor, in a city named one of the most dangerous in the country. Somehow I managed to move past that. Instead of fleeing the state maybe you shoulda lent a hand to make it better?

At the end of the day he could be tracking down all these MS-13 gang members we keep hearing about but alas..
@alan22227528 @GlowplugvRay @FoxNews @jeffsessions My entire point is, we aren’t the only state considered a sanctuary state, yet we are the only ones being sued. If it was strictly because of federal laws then ALL the states in violation would be named. But that’s not what it’s about. #hypocrisy
@alan22227528 @GlowplugvRay @FoxNews @jeffsessions It’s def something Sessions wants to do,  but there would be such a huge blow back. Colorado has such a huge surplus they are investing in schools and infrastructure outside of federal help. And if they did, they would have to target ALL states not just the ones they don’t like.
@GOPChairwoman No, Democrats and even fiscal republicans don’t want a f%#king wall. When that money can go to other, much needed things. How about we start paying for all active duty military travel to go home and visit their families, they incur that expense themselves and few can afford it.
@alan22227528 @GlowplugvRay @FoxNews @jeffsessions *federal law
@alan22227528 @GlowplugvRay @FoxNews @jeffsessions Yeah federal says marijuana is illegal, yet California and 28 other states have made it legal, so obviously there’s a gray area. Our borders are not open and flowing like some would have it seem.

@vivahate44 @landonwaddell @FoxNews How many times have you replied that you were just joking? Lol. Generally with a joke you don’t have to reiterate its a joke. My only point was if you’re gonna joke about this, then don’t act all offended and upset when it’s an adult male and a teenage girl. Be consistent.
@Sparatan_1 @Kert200 @Landonite0323 @FoxNews I would argue that the flood of Dudes that have replied with upset are the triggered ones. All I asked if it was cool if you flipped it to an adult male with a teenage girl, and all of a sudden they found that reprehensible. #HYPOCRISY
@vivahate44 @landonwaddell @FoxNews Dude if you think sex with kids and young teens is ok, I am morally superior to you.
@vivahate44 @landonwaddell @FoxNews Lol. Yeah my friends and I stand around joking about sexual interactions with children. WTF?!? Are you going to parties with Roy Moore?
@OGExecutioner @Landonite0323 @FoxNews Yeah dude it’s not. Girls have all the same feeling and attractions at that age, as boys do. Sorry to blow your mind, but we do.
@vivahate44 @landonwaddell @FoxNews Ok so jokes about boys having sex with adult females, are cool? But you switch the genders and that’s a no go?
@Kert200 @Landonite0323 @FoxNews Yeah a 30 year old adult having sex with a 14 year old is the same, regardless of gender. Do you really think that girls are less attracted to older male teachers, than a boy would be?
@SailFree @FoxNews So if a fairly attractive male teacher did this with one of your daughters or grand daughters when they were 14, that’s ok too, right?
@landonwaddell @FoxNews There’s a ton, and they really don’t like me implying that this could easily be their daughters. Apparently that’s not cool.
@Landonite0323 @FoxNews Would you also let a 30 year old dude, do the same to your daughter? It’s a two way street.
@MikePhillips65 I agree, regardless of party they should all be fiscally responsible with our money. But this administration claims to be fiscally responsible, while behind the scenes are guilty of gross mishandling.

@elgato102957 @Altairtheflyer @FoxNews You missed the point. The person I replied to, didn’t think they were old/mature enough to organize and protest their cause. I pointed out that most of them will be able to vote, enlist and buy a gun this year.
@ourhealthca Everyday, diluted in water and through a straw, it’s horrible on your teeth enamel but amazing for everything else. I’m attributing it to a flu/sick free year.
@PriscillaPro @ABC If you think arming the teachers; whether they choose it or not is a valid option, then what’s the plan for that? Who pays for it? Who buys the weapons, the training etc? Also what happens when a student takes a weapon from a teacher? Teachers had to fight for a 250 tax deduction
@gogreen18 Yes!  #PSAofTheDay
@chayalyn For clarification,the person that I originally replied to said they were just children, and what do they know. I listed a number of things that a lot of these children will be able to do very soon, even though he didn’t think they could possibly create the movement they have.
@FoxNews @MZHemingway These “children” are speaking for themselves. Most of these “children” will be able to vote, buy a gun and enlist in the military this year. These “children” apparently don’t like being shot at and seeing ppl murdered around them and are demanding that it never happens again.
@LukeEnno @FoxNews So our government wanted to cut the teachers 250$ school supply tax deduction, until they received so many calls and letters they changed their mind because of the optics, but you think they are gonna pay for this?
@vivahate44 @BoundForBedlam @FoxNews Like seriously teachers across the nation and their unions had to fight to keep their measly 250 school supply deduction, do you really think our government is going to put out money for this? Maybe the @NRA could foot the bill, instead of padding the pockets of our politicians?
@vivahate44 @BoundForBedlam @FoxNews If you think arming teachers is a solution, then who pays for it? Who pays for their side arms, ccw costs, liability ins, training etc? And what happens the first time a student takes a gun from a teacher, it happens to police and it’s their actual job to carry one.
@Mikepet86794072 @FoxNews If you think that’s a valid plan. What’s the rest of it? Who pays for it? The salaries, the licensing, the liability insurance. Also who’s doing the background check on these people?  Teachers had to fight for their 250$ school supply tax deduction.
@Altairtheflyer @FoxNews I’m guessing you learn a lot when being fired at, and watching 17 people get murdered around you.  You realize most of these kids will be able to vote and buy a gun this year, but you don’t think they are even capable of processing their grief?
@Rod19790835 @FoxNews Most of these kids will be able to vote and buy a gun this year. But you don’t think they have the capabilities to process their grief, organize and protest for change? Would you feel differently if you agreed with their point?
@Laura_Lovecraft @mommasampson @KamVTV So you don’t think that a bunch of teens can process, make thoughtful decisions, organize and protest? But you’re ok with them voting and buying guns?

@EZdougie @CBSNews Lol. Obviously you got my example.
@EZdougie @CBSNews I just feel the actual vulnerable people who NEED these programs will be the most negatively affected. We just gave corporations a 1.5 trillion tax cut, and we also need to help the poor, sick, elderly, and veterans as well.
@EZdougie @CBSNews So we should tell people what’s “unnecessary”? Anyone who’s ever worked has paid taxes to support the program. I personally don’t drink soda but I like chips, and I wouldn’t want someone telling me I couldn’t buy something.
@EZdougie @CBSNews I grew up with a single mom who had to be on assistance to support my brother and I while she went to school. My brother has a peanut allergy and I’m allergic to all dairy. As much as I want to eat “shelf stable milk” it would have made me sick. Not everyone abuses the system.

@PhxGOP @dhatch73 @DansSangvind @FoxNews @RoseannForTrump @SenJoniErnst You know who generally has to say “I’m not a racist” is a racist. To be fair tho, there aren’t a lot of news story about @ICEgov rounding up and reporting the illegal Irish immigrants.

@PhxGOP @dhatch73 @DansSangvind @FoxNews @RoseannForTrump @SenJoniErnst That’s not how enrolling in the military works.
@SamathaHamilton @FoxNews @SenJoniErnst One of the main qualifications of being a DACA recipient is you can’t have a criminal history. All of the dreamers either go to school or work and pay taxes. They also help grow our economy.
@PhxGOP @dhatch73 @DansSangvind @FoxNews @RoseannForTrump @SenJoniErnst So you’re volunteering to sign up to replace the dreamers currently serving in our military? They’re positively contributing members of our country, who work, pay taxes, grow the economy, and yes serve our country in the military. Why wouldn’t you want those ppl in the US?
@Imyurhukelberry @FoxNews @SenJoniErnst Our country will lose billions if they left, they contribute positively to our economy and pay taxes. And the estimated loss, doesn’t include the cost to actually send them somewhere. Why wouldn’t you want hard working and educated part of our country?
@I_Drank_What_ @FoxNews @SenJoniErnst One of the main qualifications of DACA is that you can’t have a criminal history, or commit crimes going forward, as it would disqualify them from reapplying.

@jimsta29 And the whole discussion isn’t even a debate of their crime. It’s about whether our POTUS, should be bashing private citizens over petty bullshit. HINT: he shouldn’t, there’s plenty of major life altering things going on in the world that need his attention.
@jimsta29 Lol did you read my comment? No I absolutely don’t think it’s ok. I however don’t equate theft of plastic eyewear to 10 years in a prison labor camp. They are idiots and hopefully learned a lesson, but the time did not fit the crime.

@SwordsmanSmith @vlynpowell @RobertVandersl5 @DesignO9 @ColMorrisDavis @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I agree. We as Americans should respect the laws of countries we travel to. They were dumb and didn’t. It still doesn’t change the fact, that the president of the USA, shouldn’t go on social media to say he shoulda left them there becuz other ppl aren’t giving him credit.
@vlynpowell @RobertVandersl5 @DesignO9 @ColMorrisDavis @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump If he’s helped all of these ppl out of the spotlight, and didn’t mention it himself. How did you hear about it?

@RyanMathern @AliFritters @HunterPage43 @FoxNews If you have children and are married and are in the middle class, and don’t live in a high tax state, and don’t depend on any of the major deductions being taken away then yes you may benefit slightly. I hope you can use the extra 1182$ a year. I however won’t benefit.
@RyanMathern @AliFritters @HunterPage43 @FoxNews *previous not precious 🤦🏼‍♀️
@RyanMathern @AliFritters @HunterPage43 @FoxNews I do. From all the reasons in my precious tweet. I’m all for a tax cut for Americans, however If it’s so great then why is it only temporary yet the corporate rate is set to be permanent. And we take away a 250$credit for teachers but add in a deduction for private planes?
@cat_guy_steve @FoxNews I just thought it was funny. If they are undecided then they should add that in. The total should be 100%. Leaving it out was slightly weird.
@rs0114 @FoxNews I’m not in the 1% but I itemize. I travel for work, have a parent (adult dependent credit) and medical deductions. All that will be taken away. And I live in a high tax state. Yet they want to add a deduction for private planes?!
@RyanMathern @AliFritters @HunterPage43 @FoxNews Mine is the ability to itemize is being taken away, the deductions for adult dependents, medical and work/travel deductions. Yet the senate bill added in a deduction for private jets?!?

@candice_ralston @Janisnz3 @RepMcClintock I’m sorry ma’am but any corporation that chooses to operate outside of the US for operating costs will never come back. Even if they were given tax free status, it’s just not comparable to what they save.
@candice_ralston @Janisnz3 @RepMcClintock But there is no guarantee that it will bring anything back. The last tax reform that benefitted corporations, CEO’s and owners of companies just bought back more stock. They just added into the senate bill a deduction for private planes, im sure we will get great use out of that
@Janisnz3 @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock And yes I know they raised  personal exemption but it doesn't get anywhere near my regular deductions. And I don't have children so I don't get the dbled child credit. Under the house version my tax bracket isn't even changing.
@Janisnz3 @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock I have my facts straight bcuz I read the damn thing. Did you actually read it? It gets rid of most state/local tax, the ability to itemize, Medical deductions, adult dependent credit and much more.
@Janisnz3 @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock And if this is such a great tax cut, how come the personal cuts are only temporary but the corporate rate is permanent. And the senate version last night added in a personal airplane deduction. So I'm sure I'll make great use of that 🤦🏼‍♀️

@PharmaJameson @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock Also I will be losing the ability to deduct work travel expenses which is a huge deduction for me. And if the “cuts” are so good then why are they only temporary, yet corporate cuts are permanent?
@PharmaJameson @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock So it’s the States fault for losing medical, adult dependent, itemized, and several other deductions? And only people who are married with children will benefit at all. My tax bracket isn’t even going to change. If you aren’t negatively affected then great for you, but I will be.
@Jim_Jordan Do the people of Ohio not need state/local tax deduction, medical expense deduction, itemized deduction and so much more. If they don't then I'm happy they won't be adversely affected but me and a lot of others are going to be. Not to mention it's gutting Medicaid and Medicare.
@MMScholes @candice_ralston @RepMcClintock @SenatorCollins That deduction is one of the more heartless one. To them 250$ is nothing, but it makes a huge difference to the ppl actually claiming the deduction. I didn't mean to leave it out of my rant, but I selfishly only mentioned ones that applied to me🤦🏼‍♀️
@cop462 @RepMcClintock This bill would significantly raise my taxes. It takes away several deductions that I depend on, not to mention the ability to itemize, even with the dbled personal deduction, it's still no where near what I usually have.
@cop462 @RepMcClintock I'm a registered democrat and voted for him originally. So did my husband.
@candice_ralston @RepMcClintock This bill takes away state/local tax deductions, adult dependent deduction, itemized deductions, medical deductions. I'm happy for you if none of these apply to you but it will make my taxes go up significantly. Also it will increase the federal debt significantly.
@RepMcClintock Thank you for listening to us who live in your district! Too bad the other California republican representatives didn't.  I sincerely hope that you and the others can figure out how to make this better for the American people.

@Aevans5858 not liberal wisdom, just an American not taking the threat of a nuclear war lightly. It's not a LOL type situation. Ya feel me?
@vincenzo_2 @FoxNews South Korea has one of the biggest US bases in the world.
@dr_freeman87 it's a US threat because Guam is US territory with major US bases. If it's attacked it's a declaration of war.
@magambill keep that mindset up and we may very well find ourselves in another war, but the biggest of any of our lifetimes w/ mass deaths.
@magambill @thehill so ALL presidents since the Korean War in the 50's have been Dems? This isn't a blame one party,everyone is responsible

@WhiteHouse @SHSanders45 I'm seriously disturbed by these 9 and 10 year olds who keep writing @POTUS who can't legible write their names.

@RosieGray said stephen miller who grew up in Santa Monica and went to Duke University. Who's a white man in America. He acts very put upon.
@girliegirlie they do! And then it makes me question that they actually understand what a public poll is. 😬
@FoxNews yeah he bolstered a lot of fake rage. Stephen Miller is the worst!
@yashar he's the worst of the worst! A truly disgusting human being. And it scares me that ppl like him are creating policy.
@Acosta "jim, jim, jim, jim, jim lets talk about this." Thx for showing who Stephen Miller actually is, a grotesque human being.
@AnnCoulter I think you have a crush on this little hate nugget, you tweeted about him 4x in 6 mins! 😂 #StephenMillerIsDefKKK #creepy
@AnnCoulter he loves to tell ppl what they are actually saying. Also im sure he keeps ppl in a basement and owns a ball gag 😬
@Jen_loves_Texas @politico yes because it's legal that means "everyone" will use it. 🙄 However everyone will benefit from its tax proceeds.

@RawStory I'm in 100% support of this train wreck decision👌🏼👍🏻 😂
@johnnyjohansenj it's not normal for a POTUS to not make a statement about foreign affairs of this magnitude.
@VP don't you think it's weird that you're making theses statements and not @POTUS?! 🤔👎🏼 #AskingForTheCountry
@RawStory remind me, was it @Scaramucci who said "grab em by the pussy." I'm sure they've heard worse at home. 🙀
@FoxNews a 9 year old wrote this? Yeah this should be forwarded to @BetsyDeVos to show how bad our public school system is.

@IsaboTaylor @bababire @FoxNews @onenewsnowcom not new. I'm commenting on things that I'm tagged in. Sorry you are annoyed by logic ✌🏻
@IsaboTaylor @bababire so we should be way more afraid of fast food restaurants. #JustAThought
@IsaboTaylor @bababire top 15 reasons a person dies in CA doesn't even have being murdered on it. Top reason ppl die in Ca is heart disease
@IsaboTaylor @bababire @FoxNews if you live your daily life in fear, then terrorism has already won out.
@IsaboTaylor @bababire @FoxNews @onenewsnowcom terrorism is shocking. I hope there doesn't come a day that I don't find it shocking.
@CaptainRhettB @PollyNaviaux @nowthisnews and if a microchip changes your faith, then chances are you don't really have any.
@CaptainRhettB @PollyNaviaux @nowthisnews so the voluntary microchips in our cellphones, cars, and atms/credit cards are ok tho, right?
@ABC who calls the police for this?!?
@IsaboTaylor @FoxNews we all have to live here, hopefully the country can come together and find some common ground ✌🏻
@ABC this is the news I miss 😫 @CrackerBarrel these ppl need a lifetime food card. They are dedicated!
@IsaboTaylor @FoxNews one last thought are the Islamic terrorists learning to speak Spanish to fit in, in Mexico?
@IsaboTaylor I wanna be clear I'm not being facetious, these are legitimate questions I have to someone who thinks this is a good idea.
@IsaboTaylor @FoxNews another thought are they gonna sink it 20 ft deep into the ground as well, bcuz tunnels have been pretty successful😂
@IsaboTaylor @FoxNews and if these threats are able to enter the country unnoticed, aren't they cunning enough to just come through the gulf
@IsaboTaylor Lol ok. If that were true, the "new" wall probably won't be built for over a decade, how will it "defend" us more than current?
@IsaboTaylor @FoxNews  have you ever been to the border? There already is one. What's the point of wasting money to build another one?

@dauntless_diana I'll get right on that research👌🏻 But can you tell me exactly where in the Bible it talks about microchips? 🤖
@PollyNaviaux @nowthisnews where in the Bible does it mention microchips? I guess my dogs are all doomed to hell cuz they are microchipped 😂
@RWPUSA a President who successfully pardons himself is not the leader of a democratic nation, he is a dictator who does what he wants.
@williamlegate I can't process this ridiculousness, so I'm just gonna pretend i didn't see it. That'll work right? 👶🏼+🐟=😳
@BrianHanes4 @ABC lol yep that's gonna save you 😂
@BrianHanes4 @ABC an attack on any American state is an attack on all Americans. You're so sure your state wouldn't be next? ✌🏻
@BrianHanes4 @ABC awesome attitude towards your fellow Americans, not to mention the 1000's of military and families that are there.
@katycandlesoap what? I didn't say you didn't read it. And what professional are you talking about? Did you comment back to the wrong person
@thehill another person to spin #AlternativeFacts. Except he will try to be your friend first, then lie to your face. 🙄
@o_stone 😂 well it seems you have it all figured out. You should tweet @POTUS your plan, i'm sure he's looking for "good ideas" ✌🏻
@o_stone Lol, were you one of the ppl that didn't read this? It's an opinion of something that might happen. What do you suggest we do?
@katycandlesoap we can't worry about it all. My original point was it just seemed to be something they wrote to rile up their core base.
@katycandlesoap and lots of things "could happen" for instance the Texas sized asteroid could hit us and we'd all be obliterated.
@katycandlesoap  it's an opinion piece with a headline that reads as if it's fact based current events. I think most didn't actually read it
@FoxNews @FoxNewsOpinion this whole article was conjecture and "what if's."  It's completely misleading and fear mongering #LiteralFakeNews
@mike_pence you mean the "Red tape" that prevents a stock market crash and a housing crisis?!?! Yeah let's just roll all that back 🤔🖕🏻

@ggary59 @jipkin how are disabled children and adults supposed to do this?
@ggary59 @jipkin and they or you paid for their schooling? Or did they get financial assistance?
@ggary59 @jipkin Lol how do you expect ppl working full time who are under the poverty line to afford school?
@mattslagg  Sir, have you actually read the bill? It does have cuts, yes it's a roll back. But a lot of ppl will lose vital coverages.
@ggary59 @bawl @jipkin @KellyannePolls you realize that there are people who work full time, that still fall under the poverty line?
@realDonaldTrump so what have you done since January, besides calling it a lie, a hoax or fake news?
@FoxNews you're gonna have to accept that some are gonna  boo when you actively try to take away people's civil liberties.

@WendyWiecki no worries Wendy we can both live in a world where we disagree. I'll hope for the best but still plan for the worse.
@WendyWiecki I appreciate you trying to show me things he's done, but it's all fodder and show. Nothing's actual been done.
@WendyWiecki never said I didn't read it. Half of the things listed are him "discussing" things with people. Conversations aren't actions.
@rlgordon18_ruth I was fine before and after the recession. Hope you and your neighbors can say the same in the case of the next ✌🏻
@rlgordon18_ruth so they survived w/the help of assistance. Yet you voted for someone who doesn't believe in that assistance? #Hypocrisy
@rlgordon18_ruth so if they didn't have jobs. How did they support themselves? Gov't assistance?
@rlgordon18_ruth lol sounds factual 👌🏻 if your neighbors didn't have jobs that's bcuz they chose to not have them. There's always work.
@rlgordon18_ruth yes I know, and trump just pulled back the regulations that were put in place after that happened
@rlgordon18_ruth ok at this point I think you are quoting a meme you saw. You realize these numbers are verifiable right?
@rlgordon18_ruth but I guess if you want another housing crisis or another recession, then sure take away all of the regulations. 👍🏻👌🏻
@rlgordon18_ruth and regulations are checks and balances that prohibit any entity from gaining too much power.
@rlgordon18_ruth you think our economy didn't grow for 8 years? It almost dbled. I'm not sure where your getting your "facts" from

@STSTWO @7448fuckenbull who said I did? I absolutely don't condone violence , especially for political views.
@jtLOL another solid argument 😎
@STSTWO @7448fuckenbull Their are extremists on both sides who use their views to justify the terrorist acts that they commit.
@STSTWO @7448fuckenbull Lol you all seem to "really" know what's going on I suppose. Nice to call someone stupid when facts are stated 👍🏻

@jason_vanorder @melvinlacey @TallahattaMan the only "riot" that ppl keep referring to is Berkeley and there were two extreme sides fighting
@jason_vanorder @TallahattaMan just like the guy who shot Rep Gabby Giffords in the head.
@jason_vanorder @TallahattaMan this isn't a Repub or Dem thing, he was an extremist who used his political views to justify his crimes.
@KellyannePolls just like what happened to Gabby Giffords, the shooter was an extremist who used his political views to justify his crime.

@JenBohle I'm sad to say, I think your very valid point Is lost on her.

@Chesham37 @Jenise_Jen @Chesham37 that was my original thought, I shoulda stuck with it. It's late and I took the bate. Lol
@Jenise_Jen @JenBohle if I'm correct he was in the U.K. And made a statement about it.
@Jenise_Jen @JenBohle Are you talking about when the 5 officers were shot? He spoke at the memorial.
@New1000AD I'm a Democrat and a gun owner. Lol. The two aren't synonymous ✌🏻

@sftbllmommync a republican shot Gabby Giffords. It's not a Repub or Dem thing, it's an extremist who used his views as justification.

@40Texan no prob it's how I generally try to interact wth all ppl. We are all humans who have opinions. Have a nice night ✌🏻
@40Texan but those weren't politically motivated, violence nonetheless. I believe in the 2nd amdt, but the violence in general is growing
@40Texan I would to, in California today we had a guy shoot up a UPS store and look what happened in FL last week.
@40Texan you know what they say about assuming. I have a wiener dog sticker in window, if I was shot at, I wouldn't assume it was that. Lol
@40Texan @FoxNews im not making an excuse for this person at all, they are criminals and no one deserves to be shot at for political views
@40Texan @FoxNews i just thought the narrative was funny because nowhere in the article did it say that's specifically why they were shot at
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider it's not like @potus spent the last year calling them liars and questioning their intel or anything 🤔😬
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider how do they know they were shot at because of their flag? Did the assailants say that?
@mamasittalove I agree about the divide and am no fan of @POTUS, but this person is a criminal regardless. You can't just shoot at ppl.
@sftbllmommync @FoxNews so all the ppl who've committed crimes while supporting trump are what? Answer: they are ALL criminals.
@40Texan @FoxNews shooting a gun at an unwarranted person doesn't make you a liberal, it makes you a criminal.

@MeSharona1 snopes debunked the social media stuff that said trump did it. Also it's still not enough to get done what needs to be done.

@Dbunker92011 @thehill he chose to recuse himself w/out explaining why to his constituents and now you all are in an uproar when he did this
@Dbunker92011 @thehill I meant obvious to you and any basic functioning person. Do you understand what recuse means?
@Joshjamestom @thedanieb @deray @billmaher so you're one of the racists that feel at home Josh?
@Joshjamestom @thedanieb @deray @billmaher yeah jokes about slavery don't deserve "outrage". What would you like me to be "outraged" about?
@Dbunker92011 @thehill that's the point, by recusing himself, it doesn't allow him to do what he's doing. I thought that was obvious.
@FoxNews is there a pro-choice club? They both should be allowed or both denied.
@thedanieb @deray @billmaher I'm aware that even being shocked by this that I'm spewing privilege like a broken main.💦 #weNeedToDoBetter
@thedanieb @deray @billmaher wtf?! How in 20fuckin17 are ppl making slavery jokes?! Welcome to Trumps America where racists feel at home😡
@Jeffcla11116849 @willieluex8 @medic6423 @NBCNews if you actually think that then why isn't Saudi Arabia included?
@Jeffcla11116849 @medic6423 @NBCNews yeah but 9/11 happened and bush had the 90 day ban. Still is t prevent anything. You can't live in fear
@Jeffcla11116849 @medic6423 @NBCNews also what's the point when the original 90 days is already up?
@Jeffcla11116849 @medic6423 @NBCNews are we all not currently safe?
@thehill while they have their wish list going, how about they start a program that helps active military get free travel when on leave?
@Dbunker92011 @thehill then he shouldn't of recused himself, you can't say one thing publicly, then do the opposite and not get called out.
@donnarowe35 @thehill did you read the article? Lol
@pamelaegarland @FoxNews no personal offense but if you think that coal is our future then I have a bridge to sell you.

According to @POTUS we will have the cleanest water. I wonder how the city of Flint feels about that 🤔

@thehill shocked 😐
@SofiaHayes20 @mjcrazyblonde real "Christian" of you throwing around insults and judgements. And the book is full of fluff w/no substance 😉

@UncleAndy45014 @NBCNews ok well obviously you know what you're talking about. Lol. Hope guy don't have any kids or grandkids ✌🏻
@realDonaldTrump why make a spectacle about it? Is the attention and flare really needed?
@SpeakerRyan does that reform include making millions from the privatization of prisons? Prisons and Health Ins shouldn't be for profit!! 👎🏻

@realDonaldTrump did someone rip the phone out of your hand and this is all you could get out ? 😑
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider it's crazy that we don't give our service men and woman complimentary travel home when on leave.
@ABC I disagree with the alt right on pretty much everything, but we must protect the first amendment.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @FoxNewsInsider the rights agenda is Fascism.
@holymolyomg9 If the school is sub par then call them out and help fix the problem, don't just use it as a political statement.
@holymolyomg9 @FoxNews it just seems like she dropped a bombshell and this community is left to clean up the mess she's caused
@FoxNews @NileGardiner he didn't bomb the air base, he bombed the runway.  The air base was operational same day.
@holymolyomg9 @FoxNews also I think a better way of announcing this would have been w/a follow up solution to the issues stated.
@holymolyomg9 @FoxNews not if the entirety of the staff, parents, and a large portion of students are disputing it.
@suemartin1650 @holymolyomg9 @FoxNews that's what I meant, she only had a statement from 1 person out of 1000+ students and staff
@GeorgeTakei That he's about to be fired, while @realDonaldTrump simultaneously defends him on twitter?
@StockCats i think he's too afraid of what the results would be 😂
@RepBarbaraLee @washingtonpost seems legit. His whole premise has pretty much been "f&amp;%k woman, children, LGBTQ, poor, POC and disadvantaged
@hNBCNews it's unsubstantiated and a leak? Lol. So shouldn't it be an unsubstantiated lie? #askingForAFriend 😂
@JennyRussellAJB @FoxNews I feel sad for wherever you went to school.
@holymolyomg9 @FoxNews I think to make such a blanketed statement, she needs to put a little more effort and research into the claim
@Lennon2122 @FoxNews she made this announcement off of one persons statement. Maybe she needs to do her due diligence and gather more info?

@WesSpannuth @BaittyJulie @FoxNews same,I'm not under the ACA and mine more than dbl'd. The problem is privatized for profit Ins companies.
@zanechaffins @IrisRimon @FoxNews love that you're a "Christian" but revel in people's misery. 👍🏻
@KellyannePolls Hillary is not president! At some point this administration is going to have to stop deflecting and get your shit together!
@ProudAm781 @FoxNews I'm not sure how that converts to not respecting our allies who've also sacrificed troops.
@ProudAm781 @FoxNews we also use the lions share of NATO.
@realDonaldTrump I think what was a big deal was the @GOP sponsored robo-calls from you when it's illegal to do them in Montana 😑
@ProudAm781 @FoxNews the "deadbeat" allies that are currently fighting along w/our own service people right now deserve respect as well
@scormako @FoxNews or re enlisting? There are 1000's of NATO allied soldiers fighting along w/ours. They deserve our respect as well
@scormako @FoxNews lol sure. We are the ones in a war, on the ground in Syria, and on the verge w/North Korea. Are you signing up to fight?
@ToddHeadleeAZ @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump except we are the ones who are in a current war and on the verge of a war w/North Korea
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider He got better than what he gave. He's made the US an absolute joke.
@guardian most of America agrees with this sentiment as well.
@Dego431975 I don't know how you conduct yourself but I don't go around telling ppl to light themselves on fire, even stupid ppl
@Dego431975 it's a term for when you think you've made a joke. Lol. How do you not know that?
@rickie_authemen yeah and I'm sure lots of things could have been prevented if things were changed. Lol. Hindsight is 20/20
@Dego431975 @FoxNews burn. Lol.

@Mer57maid  yeah I know what a real handshake is, and if someone did that to me, they would probably get punched.
@tankdrvr26 @FoxNews lol I don't think you have read the bill or have any understanding of what has been said.	Please go educate yourself
@ABC 😂 at what point is he concerned? I just want to know where his line is? #askingforafriend
@FoxNews but pushing heads of state out of the way, direct insults and shaking hands like a lunatic is totes normal. 😑🤔
@d1auditor money then you obviously are have no clue
@d1auditor honestly if you don't see the hypocrisy in selling weapons to them while simultaneously banning others that aren't giving us
@d1auditor viable governments that harbor terrorists that committed the worst attack against our country ever. Ok seems legit
@d1auditor lol apparently you didn't read the ban. The original was specifically said muslims which is why it kept getting rejected
@sgardner912 oh and we just sold them a billion dollars in weapons. Seems legit in keep us "safe" and not catering to anyone. Lol
@sgardner912 except that Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 terrorist came from aren't included in the ban and are allowed to travel here freely
@d1auditor Our constitution provides protection to Americans, and a Muslim ban affects Muslim Americans
@KBSMA1 but yet the hypocrisy of the ban that the Saudis are allowed to travel here freely and we sell them a billion dollars in weapons
@KBSMA1 this was pointed at Saudi Arabia being left off the list of countries banned even tho its where the 9/11 terrorist came from
@1rancan the saudis?
@ShawnSRocks @USATODAY or disturbed or crazy. But definitely not a terrorist. 🤔
@byjoelanderson and as a non black person I apologize for living with blinders on and thinking this country was getting better.
@1NorthStar @robin_manic also thx for the insult, that usually when I know the person has no Intellect or reason. Lol
@1NorthStar @robin_manic yeah im the stupid one, when your making statements then follow it up with well that's what woulda happened. Lol
@LauraHouston4 most religions probably can be defined as a cult. Lol
@LauraHouston4 point is mosques and temples are also tax exempt.
@LauraHouston4 god knows how much the Catholic Church claims.
@LauraHouston4 Scientology claims more than a billion a year.
@LauraHouston4 nope it's technically a church
@robin_manic not what he said tho. We had one when 9/11 happened yet it still happened so what's your point
@robin_manic lol yep
@LauraHouston4 why do you think crazy ppl like the Waco and ruby ridge right cults file as churches, tax exempt status
@LauraHouston4 technically I could start a church tomorrow, and as long as I meet the guidelines I can file for tax exempt status
@LauraHouston4 mosques are a religious institution and function as so under our constitution.
@LauraHouston4 @FoxNews *in
@LauraHouston4 @FoxNews well I'm the US a mosque doesn't pay taxes. All religious institutions are tax exempt.
@robin_manic @1NorthStar @FoxNews that our laws don't apply to other countries then im not sure you will understand
@robin_manic lol I think your the one who's having that issue. It's available online you can go read it, but I feel like if you don't get
@robin_manic first of all they were U.K. Citizens. 2nd our ban doesn't stop them from going anywhere else except here
@robin_manic the point is they said if ours was in place that the attacks would have been prevented. That's not true
@g_geboy night Glenn. Maybe try and expand your mind a little and go speak to others different than you
@Bring2Light777 I respect everyone's right to practice their religion as long as they aren't breaking the law
@robin_manic no it doesn't. It applies to the listed countries coming to the US. We don't write laws for the U.K.
@g_geboy im not sure why you think I agree with genital mutilation. Do you think all muslims are getting this done?
@g_geboy and the way it's done in a Brisk? Where the rabbi cleans the tip w/his mouth and cuts the skin with not anesthesia?
@robin_manic im not sure what you are referring to, feel free to restate
@robin_manic the person I was replying to, said if the ban had been in place then the Manchester bombing wouldn't have happen
@g_geboy I actually wasn't a liberal before this year, and realized that our country is still full of bigoted ppl who just want to see white
@g_geboy technically circumsision is genital mutilation to. But nice way to talk to a fellow American. I'm sure you're a good Christian to
@g_geboy why so I have to leave my country just bcuz I respect others beliefs? As long as they follow our law?
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 so feel free to pick through history and only remember what you want
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 I'm proud to be an American, but we slaughtered millions to become that remember
@g_geboy illegal ppl don't collect income tax but a lot pay it. Do you actually research anything or just repeat things from twitter?
@g_geboy Muslim is a religion. Lol. Yes there are radicals just like any religion.
@robin_manic @1NorthStar @FoxNews we don't write bans for the U.K.
@robin_manic @1NorthStar @FoxNews yeah I know, we are the US. Lol
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews ok well keep being ignorant and making assumptions, you know the old saying
@amandabonds211 @g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews it was a target bcuz killing woman and children had a bigger effect.
@amandabonds211 @g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews wow. Your kids gonna grow up scared and sad. I'm not gonna live my life scared
@1NorthStar @FoxNews ok that comment just made me realize you are an idiot and I've wasted the last 10 mins interfacing w/you.
@1NorthStar @FoxNews no because our ban is for the US. You realize Manchester is in England which is the U.K. Right? Lol.
@amandabonds211 @FoxNews @POTUS in the US? Lol.
@g_geboy yeah banning religions, war on the press, rounding ppl up. Totally doesn't sound familiar.
@Godfatherfan1 @FoxNews @POTUS yep so the country that gave us the 9/11 terrorist get a pass? At least get on board with your own opinion
@Godfatherfan1 @FoxNews can you explain how leaving Saudi Arabia off the ban makes sense? And then we give them weapons?!? Lol
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews I would bet all my guns you've never had a real convo w/ a Muslim person. Lol
@1NorthStar @FoxNews but we let the ones giving us money out of it and give them more weapons. How does that make sense?
@1NorthStar @FoxNews if he wants the temp ban then I think he needs to include all countries that radical terrorist have come from
@adamslassiter @Twitter good point! He would prob dedicate a team to just changing his tweets. Lol
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews I'm sure that's what hitler said about the Jews, who've also been at war for a 1000yrs
@DeadPoo79209252 @FoxNews if he's gonna do the temp ban then at least do all countries that radical terrorist have come from.
@DeadPoo79209252 @FoxNews but by all means bye a billion in weapons and you're free to come in with no verification?
@DeadPoo79209252 @FoxNews @POTUS which is usually SOP. But @potus just wants to look like he's tough on terror.
@jujub001 @FoxNews @POTUS you realize there are Muslim Americans? Lol
@adamslassiter honestly @twitter needs to let us edit these damn things. Lol
@Godfatherfan1 @FoxNews @POTUS and what about all the other radical ppl? Who aren't Muslim, their just disturbed, crazy and unhinged?
@Godfatherfan1 @FoxNews @POTUS yet Saudis will still be allowed in, and sold weapons. Lol. Cool story bro 😎
@g_geboy @JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews neither do most muslims. I ask again have you ever spoke to a non radical Muslim and asked any ?'s
@Calamity777Jane @FoxNews @POTUS any religion that send missionary's anywhere to proselytize is doing that.
@Tim71428977 @_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews Even the strictest of the @scouts judges isn't going to rule against the constitution.
@adamslassiter I got what you were trying to say.
@adamslassiter I'm sorry that want pointed at you at all! I was just flying through responses and sent it to the wrong person
@sgardner912 @FoxNews @POTUS have you ever read the Bible? There's lots of violent things in there. Also ever heard of the crusades?
@sgardner912 @dragonsbrath @FoxNews because our @POTUS is only using the ban as a political measure and to seem like he's tough on terror
@rendermark222 @FoxNews @POTUS also have you ever seen a Brisk? Or a hospital circumcision? That's technical genital mutilation.
@rendermark222 @FoxNews @POTUS I don't agree with genital mutilation. If you ever spoke to a non radical muslim they don't as well
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews @POTUS which deems it unconstitutional.
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews @POTUS that's why the courts keep kicking it out. They keep saying Muslim ban, instead of travel ban w
@Dego431975 @FoxNews @POTUS have you ever read the constitution? Do you understand words?
@adamslassiter @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews @POTUS I can't have a convo w/someone who can't form sentences. ✌🏻
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews @POTUS I'm not ok with the persecution of anyone for what they choose to practice as their religion
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews current  @POTUS tries to instate a religious ban for political benefit and make it seem he's being tough on terror
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @FoxNews @POTUS most presidents instate a travel ban when taking office, its common practice. Im fine with that
@rendermark222 @FoxNews @POTUS also I expect anyone who comes to this country try to follow the laws and constitution.
@rendermark222 @FoxNews @POTUS lol. You think our laws are based off of religions?
@Adaias_Magno @FoxNews @POTUS yet 15 of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, they aren't on the list of banned countries.
@dragonsbrath @FoxNews @POTUS yet the country who birthed the 9/11 terrorists get sold weapons and are allowed to come here freely?
@TwoDeerPines @FoxNews @POTUS yet the country that was responsible for the 9/11 terrorists get sold a billion in weapons and come freely?
@wisecc1 @TwoDeerPines @FoxNews @POTUS have you ever met a Muslim person? Spoke to them, asked any questions at all?
@LauraHouston4 @FoxNews also @potus just ended separation of church and state to give churches more political say
@JeffWetzel @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews @POTUS yeah Israel is involved in that yet we still send them a million dollars a day.
@LauraHouston4 @FoxNews @POTUS this meme has def changed my mind. Go fucking expand your small world and speak to ppl who are different.
@Blue_Sunflowers @GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews @POTUS SCIENTOLOGY, deism, Amish, satanism, and even Jedi-ism are all considered religions. Lol
@GOHAWKS525 @FoxNews @POTUS Christianity, Catholicism, Judaism, Buddhism, Sikhism, mormons, Hinduism, Taoism,
@FoxNews @POTUS Why aren't they protesting the billion in arms that we  sold to Saudi Arabia, where 75% of the 9/11 terrorists came from. 🤔
@FoxNews @POTUS also anyone who supports this specific phrasing doesn't support the constitution, "banning" a religion is unconstitutional.
@FoxNews @POTUS what this doesn't say is most of the 19 came from Saudi Arabia, which isn't even listed as one of the countries in the ban.
@AmericanBA2017 @cnnbrk You're comparing muslims to the nazis? And you're the Jews in this scenario? Yet you  want to eradicate the muslims?
@AmericanBA2017 @cnnbrk I'm sure hitler had the same sentiments about the Jews.
@LindaWildes you are awesome! To be fair I was deeply offended by these signs much more,  but never called the cops 😂 https://t.co/YDefWNIxrV
@grohix2 @FoxNews *separate
@grohix2 @FoxNews 3rd I made a comment on this particular thread, not sure how that translates to me not diversifying my news outlets 😐
@grohix2 @FoxNews 2nd we already have a federal DEPT that investigates voter fraud, so paying 2 spears entities is a waste of time
@grohix2 @FoxNews lol ok well 1st of all I wouldn't ask Gov Abbot anything bcuz he's a bigoted idiot.
@FoxNews why not? Seems legit and totally not a waste of money or time. Also how's that special team assigned to voter fraud? 🤔
@BBCBreaking @BBCNews  so it's not just the US that white men get more lenient sentences for horrific crimes. Shocked 😐 A prank!?! Really?
@MaryNumair @funder @trdny damn I had to dbl count those zeros. Lol. I'm sure he'll make that up in no time w/all his new business contacts😂
@cavcrusader @NBCNews @benandjerrys chunky monkey and pistachio :)
@Freedom55555553 @NBCNews @nbcchicago so if anyone's protesting it's probably for that.
@Freedom55555553 @NBCNews @nbcchicago well it's a private for profit prison and staff that the @GOP voted for.
@ReplaceTrump @NBCNews @BenJerry_Be  that's kind of the point. To be told you can't do something that you should absolutely be able to do ✌🏻
@cavcrusader @NBCNews you mean equal civil rights for everyone? I'll make sure to buy extra @benandjerrys next time to compensate 😉
@Terianniaraq @indigoblur and it's getting very old to spend 3million every weekend our @POTUS goes golfing.
@Terianniaraq @indigoblur I get that there is a cost to protecting the first family, but a lot of what we are currently spending is elective
@indigoblur @Terianniaraq and we've spent 60 million dollars extra to protect @POTUS 's wife and child separately in NYC 😐

@realDonaldTrump who did they ask @KellyannePolls, @VP, anyone from the @GOP or @PressSec?  😂
@CJPatruno @williamlegate @KellyannePolls I'm also worried about the sanity of the 4 ppl so far who've voted no. 😬
@cwayne72445190 @FoxNews @aacuna1 you must be a great person to hang out with. Lol
@sephy_usman @Matt_Hilburn @washingtonpost would do what? Lol. I'm pretty sure shoving anyone out of the way shows disrespect.
@maga307 @thehill yes that's who to blame, not the psychopath who committed the crimes. I forgot terrorists only travel legally. 😂
@NoMoreRomney @thehill well 9/11 happened and we blamed the saudis, but trump has moved passed that apparently.
@SenFeinstein I'm pretty sure their underlying motto is "F#%k woman and the poor"
@Matt_Hilburn @washingtonpost lol 😂 obviously not you. Good luck w/ that 👌🏻
@FoxNews I didn't realize your dad was a dem @Meganmccain? Every American should care why Russia wanted to interfere in our elections.
@thehill because party lines and politics are more important than basic American standards. #NotShocked
@Matt_Hilburn @washingtonpost because it shows a complete lack of respect for other foreign leaders. #Duh
@pivbee1 @FoxNews he tried to ask a question. Lol.
@cwayne72445190 @FoxNews @aacuna1 so you forcefully assault everyone who gets in your personal space? Lol. You must hate going out in public
@LindaHarden @FoxNews @aacuna1 his family asked ppl to stop perpetuating a conspiracy theory, they are grieving and deserve peace
@AliceHouser2 @FoxNews @aacuna1 then he probably shouldn't hold public office, or be around children, or ppl in general, yeah no animals too
@guardian I can't wait for Trump to talk about how large his crowds abroad were, in comparison 😑
@NCCindyLu @FoxNews @WillCarrFNC so technically it's not like they just came from no where, this has been a problem for decades.
@NCCindyLu @FoxNews @WillCarrFNC do you have a specific statistic? They did a documentary about them in the 90s as the quickest growing gang
@NCCindyLu @FoxNews @WillCarrFNC  did you read the article? It doesn't specify any specific numbers except the dozen that were released.
@NCCindyLu @FoxNews @WillCarrFNC @POTUS44 😂 Lol. Ms-13 has been around since the 80's.
@Bucky_Breeder @thehill @POTUS I was just pointing out not everyone who is poor and gets federal aid or benefits is a lazy person leaching.
@Aprilvish @thehill @mschlapp there are ppl who work full time who fall under the poverty limit who desperately need these programs.
@Bucky_Breeder @thehill @POTUS you realize there are ppl who work full time that are still under the poverty limit? #justStopBeingPoor
RT @andreapitzer: Press intimidation is a key precursor for many bad things, including the decline of societies into authoritarianism.
@keithellison ppl can raise up and overcome this, some need help. Him saying this, is a slap in the face  to the ppl who struggle everyday
@keithellison he's obviously never gone hungry, thirsty, w/out a roof over his head, or had to go to donation centers for shoes and clothes
@BooniePirate @Mrchris401 @thejossgroup @GOP got it. Now I see. Lol. This is my fault for even trying to have a rational factual discussion
@diane_bristol4 @JimCrackton @thehill they also don't believe the conspiracy that @seanhannity is using to get views. They don't deserve it.
@diane_bristol4 @JimCrackton because they want the murderer found but they don't want themselves or their son to be used as a sound bite
@GOP @TheDemocrats @HHSGov how about you create a healthcare system that isn't for profit? This goes to both sides of the isle.
@JimCrackton @thehill also don't think that the outrage behind this is for the family who's grieving and being exploited?
@JimCrackton @thejuice45 @thehill I'm pretty sure the new @POTUS has created more media hysteria than this. Lol
@JimCrackton @thehill the advertisers are fleeing because of the families public out cry and the cease and desist order, yet he continues
@BooniePirate @kobykalvin @thejossgroup @GOP ok well it seems you have the "correct" info. Lol. Good luck in whatever reality you live in ✌🏻
@BooniePirate @kobykalvin @thejossgroup @GOP he electively chose to golf more in the 1st 100days than the last 3 POTUS' combined.
@BooniePirate @kobykalvin @thejossgroup all of this info is readily available. Just bcuz you don't like the numbers doesn't make it untrue.
@BooniePirate @Mrchris401 @thejossgroup @GOP his trips vs other presidents are public knowledge, this is completely verifiable info.
@BooniePirate @Mrchris401 @thejossgroup @GOP they set the cost but he electively chooses to go and spend the money on it.
@tickedoffvoters that was basically my point from our whole convo. Closes borders and walls are not gonna keep the bad out.
@tickedoffvoters terrorist were. But if we live our lives afraid and direct hate at ppl for no reason, they are winning anyways.
@tickedoffvoters I know I live in the US. 9/11 happened the year I graduated high school and it was the first time I actually realized what
@tickedoffvoters it is definitely not. And i try not to take all my freedoms for granted because I recognize how lucky I am.
@JP61926104 after this conversation, possibly.
@JP61926104 instead of sleep I think you should stay up and do some research outside of Fox News and stay away from info wars too. 😂
@JP61926104 I'll be crying all night long Lol. If anyone's feeling legit get hurt in twitter, they're gonna a have a long life ahead of them
@tickedoffvoters but im not going to let the horrible ppl and things in the world make me scared or change who I am.
@tickedoffvoters not at all! It's a human rights violation. I generally don't agree with most religions tho.
@JP61926104 you know the mostest in the whole entire world! Lol. 👏🏻#thisDudeIsDefHittingPuppies
@JP61926104 @CNN nope I actually looked it up, CNN is the late on the uptake, this story broke a few days ago. When they made the statement
@JP61926104 @CNN @seanhannity lol ok dude you obviously know what's going on. #wasteOfTime #DoYourResearch
@JP61926104 @CNN I love how ppl throw around the term fake news but don't take the time to research the matter they are talking about
@JP61926104 @CNN @seanhannity made the stmnt about stopping his inquiry out of respect for the family, in reality it's bcuz of the lawsuit
@JP61926104 @CNN @seanhannity lol do you live in reality? It's verifiable information,Have you looked? Or are you just following blindly
@tickedoffvoters I'm sorry you are afraid, hopefully you can work through that because our world is full of a lot of bad ppl.
@RonlynGriggs @CNN the family has filed a cease and desist order and has made a public plea for @seanhannity to stop. How is that fake?
@JP61926104 @CNN except that the family has filed a cease and desist order and made a public statement pleading for @seanhannity to stop
@starshinecake @dramfool1 @tjkturner but the help I received from FAFSA was vital to me 10 years ago.
@starshinecake @dramfool1 @tjkturner the funny thing is the 3 percent tax cut I'll be getting now doesn't make a difference to me at all now
@starshinecake @dramfool1 @tjkturner no I'm justifying why they are needed. I worked full time as a student with aid and still struggled
@starshinecake @dramfool1 @tjkturner and yes I was one of the leaches who used some of these programs because I was a low income student.
@starshinecake @dramfool1 @tjkturner I don't mind my taxes going to things like education, 11 billion in cuts, but screw the kids.
@tjkturner so you don't want to pay taxes at all? Lol. Actually please just stop responding, you obviously have no grasp on reality.
@tjkturner @dramfool1 actually some of the poorest cites and states are republican dominate. I'm not sure why that matters though
@tjkturner @dramfool1  how bout you go to Detroit or flint or some of the poorest cities in the US and see what's actually going on.
@tjkturner @dramfool1 @starshinecake damn terry your privilege just spewed all out over the internet with that comment.
@w5lffjpCzGAZPgq  have you actually read the proposed budget? Lol.
@w5lffjpCzGAZPgq well protection and infrastructure are being cut to. I  took personal offense to the special Olympics cut. It seems cruel
@dramfool1@tjkturner have you actually read the proposed budget or are you just talking out of ignorance and preconceived opinions?
@dramfool1  @tjkturner do you even know the statistic or are you just conjecturing? Lol. Do you know anything about what your saying?
@tjkturner @dramfool1 welcome to now. And FYI ppl have always needed help but now they can get it without burdening others. At least for now
@Jeri_Rosenbrook then your parents were better ppl than most. I hope you can find some compassion for the ppl who will be affected.
@Jeri_Rosenbrook also you stated your family ran a care facility? So none there was paying through MEDICAID, SSI, SSDI ETC?
@Jeri_Rosenbrook your the one who suggested that family should take care of ppl who need it. That doesn't always mean parents BTW https://t.co/pfLXs7dVON
@Jeri_Rosenbrook so you basically want to live in a dog eat dog world where no one helps anyone? That's sad and sucks for the little ppl.
@Jeri_Rosenbrook and neither is after school programs, meals in wheels, ADA programs and many more, but a lot of ppl vitally benefit
@Jeri_Rosenbrook @FoxNews ironically they are some of  the ppl that assistance will be cut from tho.
@Jeri_Rosenbrook @FoxNews you seem like a great person I'm sure your family is totes on board w/taking care of you. Lol 🤥
@Jeri_Rosenbrook @FoxNews then how the hell can you say ppl should have their families take care of them instead of them needing assistance?
@tamyf8 @FoxNews no need to reply, I honestly don't care.
@tamyf8 @FoxNews lol it's called reading the damn bill proposal and staging actual facts not conjecture. How the hell are you a nurse?
@dramfool1 @tjkturner does your family know ahead of time if you ever become disabled or unable to care for yourself that it's up to them?
@tjkturner @starshinecake @dramfool1 lol this is the most ridiculous thing I've heard today. So only ppl w/out family get benefits? 😂
@Jeri_Rosenbrookthat's just one small part of the cuts, not to mention veterans benefits, aid to the poor, disabled, elderly. Fuck em tho
@Jeri_Rosenbrook @FoxNews if you don't walk away believing they are the hardest working person you've ever met then there really is no hope.
@Jeri_Rosenbrook @FoxNews @POTUS damn jerri you seem like a great person! Lol. Go speak to a special Olympian and listen to their story,
@starshinecake it's fine that's your opinion and i hope you and no one you love is affected. Time will tell I suppose
@starshinecake see your just throwing numbers out there with no actual facts. In reality you don't know who actually needs it.
@starshinecake I agree that ppl who take advantage need to stop, but the cuts affect ALL ppl who who benefit from the programs.
@tamyf8 @FoxNews @POTUS how could you comment on something when you have no idea what your commenting on? Lol. Thx for proving my point tho🤗
@tamyf8 @FoxNews @POTUS first of all you assumed I was a liberal, second did you read the budget? Like at all? There's a lot being cut.
@starshinecake @KWL1300 how does it not have to do with this? Did you read the budget? That's what he's referring to?
@starshinecake @KWL1300 yeah that doesn't necessarily apply to ppl who literally are unable to do for themselves.
@starshinecake @dramfool1 you realize these funds and programs are for ppl who can't necessarily do for themselves? Disabled, elderly etc?
@starshinecake @KWL1300 none of these cuts will affect me, the worry I have for others is the compassion he said we need to take out of it?
@starshinecake @KWL1300 Cutting funding to the poor, elderly and the SPECIAL OLYMPICS IS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.
@FoxNews @POTUS is this what MAGA is? To cut funding to the SPECIAL OLYMPICS?!?! I know I've never been more proud to be an American 🤔🤥👎🏻
RT @Alt_FedEmployee: Nothing says values like cutting hundreds of billions from medicaid, veterans, &amp; hungry kids to invest in blowing shit…
@tickedoffvoters also just FYI Wikipedia isn't a valid source but you could look up the numbers here at https://t.co/AWMQw8Khr8
@tickedoffvoters we can do a citizenship swap, ill go to Canada and you can live here w/ closed borders, a cement wall and no healthcare 😂
@tickedoffvoters also there have been several terror attacks that didn't come from a Muslim person, a few in your country, several in mine.
@tickedoffvoters I'm very lucky, I've never been a victim of terror attack. I'm sorry if you have and that's where your fear comes from.
@tickedoffvoters it seems like you're the one not paying attention to current events. I'm sorry you live in fear of one group of ppl
@tickedoffvoters also the only terrorist attack Canada has suffered in the last 2 years was the radical Canadian man shooting up a mosque.
@tickedoffvoters well your numbers are skewed and concentrated. Try comparing that to the total number of people killed
@tickedoffvoters I hope you become less pissed and find some kind of peace, living with fear and anger is sad. Good night
@tickedoffvoters but maybe go out and speak to ppl different than you and you'll realize not everyone different is out to get you.
@tickedoffvoters obviously you have some solid facts. Lol. Oh wait it's just your own fear mongering, I'm sorry your afraid of the world
@tickedoffvoters instead of using this tragedy as an excuse for blame, how bout you just say a prayer or send condolences? LOVE OVER HATE
@tickedoffvoters your totally right only Muslim ppl are terrorists. ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS HAVE TERRORISTS!
@JustinTrudeau @tickedoffvoters you realize that state of thinking is exactly what terrorists want, terror doesn't have a specific face.

@thehill @FoxNews created a toxic environment, then feign shock when their employees act like this. 🤥🤔
@thehill what hurts the country is a @Potus who has no idea what he's doing.
@CNN well the upcoming weeks international news should be Interesting. Lol. 😂
@AnnaKFaris @Abartlette @MomCBS thank you to you and all on your show for standing with planned parenthood and the support they provide 👏🏻🙌🏻
@jake_yea @williamlegate I can't think of any. But regardless using one wrong to justify another is idiotic.

@CzarIvanIV @CNN you can look up the exact statistics on https://t.co/AWMQw8Khr8.
@CzarIvanIV @CNN there are far more ppl who claim to be Christian than Muslim that commit crimes in this country.
@CzarIvanIV @emuirhead @CNN ans now that our @pouts took away separation of church and state, churches can lobby for their own agendas
@CzarIvanIV @emuirhead @CNN if you don't think The US tries to use Christianity to pass laws then you aren't paying attention.
@CzarIvanIV @CNN who are you speaking to? ISIS? Were you a victim in Orlando? There are extremists in ALL religions that use it as an excuse
@CzarIvanIV @CNN and as constitutionalist you should respect that ALL Americans have the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.
@CzarIvanIV @CNN you can despise whatever you like dude, all I'm saying is life is a lot better if you don't blame others for your own fears
@CzarIvanIV @CNN yet it's still a religion and in the USA it's in our constitution that we have Freedom of Religion. Have you ever read it?
@CzarIvanIV @CNN also your definition of Islam can be applied to almost all religions.
@CzarIvanIV @CNN I don't like Brussel sprouts yet they still exist as Brussel sprouts. Lol.
@CzarIvanIV @CNN no dude it's a religion. Just because you don't like Muslim ppl, doesn't not make it a religion. 😂
@TylerThaGrest54 @CNN you still have the right to free speech, but you are not free from consequence of what you choose say, even on twitter
@TylerThaGrest54 @CNN words on twitter are still happening in real life. If you're saying things you wouldn't say IRL that makes you a troll
@CzarIvanIV @CNN you're a constitutionalist who doesn't believe in the constitution? Lol. You know the part that allows freedom of religion?
@TylerThaGrest54 @CNN so you believe in the steelers but not the constitution? Let me guess you're a good Christian too? #CoolStoryBro

@PwrCane1 @FoxNews it's actually tomato, no e. But I guess that just proves that there's more than two points of view 😂
@RamblinManNC @CNN and if ppl are really paying attention and not following blindly then it won't get distorted.
@RamblinManNC @CNN look at history, at any country that starts a war against freedoms of the press, it doesn't usually turn out well.
@RamblinManNC @CNN but I believe that just because I may not agree w/what someone is saying, I respect their right to do so.
@RamblinManNC @CNN to cancel certain ppl out of security concerns that's technically their right as well.
@RamblinManNC @CNN and students protesting speakers on campuses is their right on either side, if the campus itself makes a decision
@RamblinManNC @CNN limiting freedom of the press is infringing on the 1st amendment.
@SenSanders don't we already have a dept that tracks voter fraud? How is the new commission different? Are they volunteering their time?
@FoxNews @PressSec @POTUS  I don't know why this headline seems sarcastic and mocking but It made me lol 😂 nonetheless.
@RamblinManNC @CNN the thing about protecting the 1st ambt isn't protecting the speech we are comfortable with, it's protecting all speech.

@BrentDuquette that was my point I had to get flown from homer to anchorage cuz it's a long long drive. I don't think you got my point
@BrentDuquette @CNN are these cases actual fact or is your state Rep your fact base? Last time I was in AL, I had to get flown into Costco.

@drewistotle @CNN I didn't say anything about obama care, I'm all for a reform, one that doesn't include Rape and pregnancy as a PEC tho.
@drewistotle @CNN also the ban was supposed to last 90 days, so the administration will have to rewrite it to reflect additional dates
@drewistotle @CNN the Supreme Court hasn't agreed to even hear the case yet, so as of right now it's law.
@ghwatcher4ever @twright55 @FoxNews She did do her job, apparently she was right considering the ban was found unconstitutional in court.
@twright55 @FoxNews Neither of the clintons are currently president. Citing one wrong to justify another is ridiculous.
@ALT_uscis I don't think he even understood what was going on, he's just waiting for his jello.
@realDonaldTrump Isn't this considered witness tampering? Or is this fake news too?
@CNN @drewistotle The courts did find it unlawful, hence it being shut down.
@CNN @twright55 She was answering the questions that were asked in reference to the original ban. She doesn't determine the questions asked.
@funder She definitely unmasked that @SenTedCruz is an idiot!
@EricTrump if this is completely untrue then you should definitely sue for liable, unless you're worried about what would actually come out.
@ALT_uscis @tedcruz is an idiot!
@RepJeffDenham When you voted to pass the AHCA, did you actually read it? Were you aware of the preexisting conditions listed?
@realDonaldTrump Lol what about you repeatedly defending him and saying he didn't do anything wrong, for months!!
@thehill it baffles me that people who voted for Trump, are shocked when things like this happen. #WellDuh
@ThomasDurrant7 also the https://t.co/AWMQw8Khr8 website doesn't support these facts. Honestly I respect the police but biased has to stop
@ThomasDurrant7 This is an opinion based meme. Also the term myth is describing historical events of things that actually happened. @FoxNews
@FoxNews @RCamposDuffy what are the services considered? Entertainment?
@piedmontian11 Also the house and senate who at the time were republican dominate approved the IRAN deal. So maybe you should ask your Rep?
@piedmontian11 My questioning of trump is not a defense of any other person. He is the president, but I don't follow any of them blindly.
@The_LoneCitizen @thehill I am white, but agree, we need to end the biased and the narrative that "white is right" and somehow superior.

@DarrellIssa  Did you read ANY of the preexisting conditions??!? How could anyone think that this bill is ok? https://t.co/GZr7vHe7C3
@DarrellIssa So in your words it's ok for Rape and domestic violence be considered a pre existing condition?
@DarrellIssa what do you have against victims of Rape, domestic violence? And pregnant woman who may have PPD or have had C-sections?!??!
So @GOPLeader is the one who rallied for the amendment for rape, domestic violence, C-sections and PPD to be pre-existing conditions?
@realDonaldTrump Doesn't it cost double since the protection in New York is already in place for your wife at Trump tower?
@mlip16 @ABC woman and men alike with, anyone can be a victim of both. But they are all exempt so they just figured it wouldn't affect them
@ABC Or maybe the realized a bill that has RAPE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE as a pre existing condition was just too much for their conscious
@hypno_chickens @DeplrablRedEyez I don't condone that either. There are extremist on both sides and the all showed up for a fight.

@BNeessen @FoxNews @NickAdamsinUSA  Grow up and expand your mind, have conversations with people who think differently than you
@RDSmith1025 look at the Crusades, if you don't think that ppl have used Christianity as an excuse to commit atrocities, look at history.
@RDSmith1025 burden of proof is on the challenger actually and that would be you
@FoxNews @NickAdamsinUSA why can't we respect and protect ALL religions? Our president only respects Christianity as political tool.
@SpeakerRyan what about the MacArthur-Meadows Amendment that says Rape, domestic violence, C-sections and PPD are pre existing conditions?!?
@WaysandMeansGOP @PeterRoskam the MacArthur-Meadows Amendment has preexisting conditions like rape, domestic violence, c-sections and PPD👎🏻
@RDSmith1025 crimes in the name of Christianity, my point was there are extremist in all religions.
@RDSmith1025 horrible things just like any other religion. I'm sure if you do a quick google search you can find many ppl who have committed
@RDSmith1025 if you would have read the context of the previous tweets I was pointing out ppl who say they are Christian can do
@tamousa19 so your ok with the healthcare bill making sexual assault a pre-existing condition?!  I don't think it's ok to justify it
@SpeakerRyan Are sexual assaults, domestic violence ,c-sections and postpartum  depression going to be considered a pre existing condition?
@BigDuhie1955 keep on judging 😂 FYI: to tell a woman she is PMS-ing is an insult. If you truly didn't know that then you're an idiot
@BigDuhie1955 once again an insult. I feel bad for any woman in your life, you obviously thing of them less than.
@BigDuhie1955 I don't blame anything on christians, I respect all religions and recognize the bad apples of any organization
@BigDuhie1955 also I have a clue, but I'm definitely not a sheep who follows blindly. But feel free to keep making assumptions and judgments
@BigDuhie1955 love how you assume Im a liberal because I recognize that people have used ALL religions to do bad things for 1000's of years
@BigDuhie1955 oh yeah i forgot it's ok to insult people as a "Christian" after 1am. Cool story bro 😂
@BigDuhie1955 also very "Christian" of you making fun of something that God created for me to be able to create life.
@BigDuhie1955 you know how you know you've  won, is when the other party resorts to insults. I thought we were just having a conversation
@BigDuhie1955 and for your original question no I don't consider the men I listed as Christian,  they did and committed their crimes as such
@BigDuhie1955 and thank you for proving my original point that there are extremist in all religions that don't represent the whole.
@BigDuhie1955 yep sit in judgement cuz that's what god wants, Definitely very "Christian" of you. Lol.
@BigDuhie1955 @williamlegate so you're saying no Christians have done bad things in the name of Christ? Have you ever read the Bible? Lol 😂
@RepStevenSmith @williamlegate will you please address this? It seems like he thinks it's ok because there may be victims of bill Clinton
RT @RepStevenSmith: @NARAL Have you alerted Bill Clinton's victims.
@naral   @RepStevenSmith so you are justifying one wrong by another?
@BigDuhie1955 @williamlegate Even Christian's have extremist.
@BigDuhie1955 @williamlegate Timothy McKay, terry nichols, Dylan roof just off the top of my head.
@ABC my only question is why he didn't announce that Trump was also under investigation?
@Steward_Men I guess it's a good thing you dont have to follow Christ through the Middle East in current times, seems like you would opt out
@seanhannity question of the year:  Are you a hypocrite?
@realDonaldTrump yeah he would have probably fought hard to keep his 150 Men, Woman and children that he OWNED AS SLAVES!!!!!
@rosiebudpisces not an expert just not a small minded sad person who only understands one way of life. Looks like you're the one in a hole.
@rosiebudpisces I seriously feel bad for you and your family. You must be a miserable person to feel that any human being is "sub human"
@CobraGreek if you don't like the multiculturalism that is America, why did you come here?
@CobraGreek no one makes me do anything I don't want to "sweetheart."
@CobraGreek it also says in the  Bible that it's ok to strike your wife and own slaves. So your point is really a non sequitur.
@rosiebudpisces I would think a 3x cancer survivor would have a little more compassion for human kind.
@rosiebudpisces have you actually met a Muslim person? Spoke to them? Asked any questions? @WomenintheWorld
@williamlegate The only thing @FoxNews is accurate at is bad touching. #ShowMeOnTheDollWhereTheFoxNewsAnchorTouchedYou
@ALT_uscis @thehill @realDonaldTrump they cost you nothing because the Tax payers are footing the bill. #alternativeFactsFromThePresident
@CNN Well with their latest threats, it seems like it totes worked, but I'm sure Trump will blame Obama, Hillary and leprechauns too 😐
@realDonaldTrump At some point you're gonna have to stop blaming Obama and the democrats. It's a republican controlled senate and congress.
@realDonaldTrump So now you literally just say the opposite of what's going on? I see what you're doing there 👀 #oppositeDay
@ALT_uscis sounds like nazi Germany.....
@POTUS @ShopFloorNAM @btetech @MarlinSteel Maybe you and your family should set an example and bring your companies manufacturing to the US.
@NPR @realDonaldTrump If he's so worried about them, why not concentrate on the ones here? Add funding and enact a federal gang task force?
@ALT_uscis @DHSgov wtf?!?! Should you be head of homeland security, if you can't figure out how to protect the homeland??!?
@realDonaldTrump So how is your wall gonna be any different than the one already in place? Except of course the American steel and labor.... https://t.co/3xtpP0G7LP
@realDonaldTrump  But you didn't beat Hillary in the popular vote.  Any news yet on the 3-5 million illegal voters yet....
@realDonaldTrump If anyone who voted for you, actually believes that, I have a bridge for sale if their interested.
@realDonaldTrump should a person under a audit by the IRS be dictating tax code? #ShowUsYourTaxes
@POTUS is this one of those things you say but mean the exact opposite? DAPL? KEYSTONE? Etc
@nytimes Because LITERALLY no other actual celebrity would respond.
@Alt_FedEmployee now to just drop them all on an abandoned island somewhere.......
@Patriots @seanspicer I think this just means that more players slightly respected Bush more than Trump but neither as much as Obama 😂
@rainnwilson Or the Whitehouse?
@BrianDavid63 I'm not stupid and I'm also not a sheep who follows blindly. You obviously have no interest in any other thought process.
@BrianDavid63 abortions through PP ARE NOT paid through Medicaid in the US is 100% funded through donations.
@BrianDavid63 and no my mom wasn't lazy, she was alone with two kids and no way to support them. The system gave her a chance
@BrianDavid63 lol ok dude. No one said I was a liberal, you assumed. I was just pointing out spending money to let someone golf is idiotic
@BrianDavid63 @BlakeStBums @USATODAY and if you're ok with ANY president spending this much for travel then you are the problem
@BrianDavid63 @BlakeStBums secondly I was a child of a parent who had to be on welfare, if it weren't for it we would have been homeless
@BrianDavid63 @BlakeStBums @USATODAY first of all federal money doesn't pay for abortions through planned parenthood.
@POTUS Is this a do as I say, not as I (my business or family)  do situation? It's more buy American hire American unless your name is Trump
@realDonaldTrump MS-13 has been in cities across the US since the 80's. Do you even fact check anything you say?
@realDonaldTrump So instead of bringing the country together you continue to try and divide it with petty things like this?
@SamanthaSJones4 Does it not make you question or take pause at how much he's spending? While simultaneously making cuts to vital programs.
@MorganAuCourant @CBSNews I'm aware. I was being sarcastic because it just seems so ridiculous. But thx for the info :)
@CBSNews they don't get free golf cart rentals at a place he owns? Lol
@FoxNews @seanspicer @oreillyfactor awesome!! Bill can sexually assault someone while Sean defends him by saying at least hitler didn't 👌🏼

@realDonaldTrump yes that's why you ask for immunity from federal prosecution. Lol. Do you have any idea of what you're doing?
Why don't we un-ban asbestos and throw some lead on our paint too. #cuzWhyNot
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews because they aren't the president. Also pointing out others wrong doings doesn't justify yours. #duh
