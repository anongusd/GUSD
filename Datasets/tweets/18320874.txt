And finally - I think our candidates should talk as little as possible about Donald Trump‚Äôs asinine twitter feed. He‚Äôs a corrupt idiot. Let‚Äôs spend our time talking about how we raise wages for working people, how provide health care to all, how we restore our reputation abroad
We have a chance to rethink how this all works in modern media. Let‚Äôs do that and use our debates to showcase the ideas we have to make people‚Äôs lives better.
And let‚Äôs not just do mainstream TV debates. Let‚Äôs actually meet people where they are online too. Digital engagement should be a major part of process. No debate should exist without a comprehensive strategy to engage the public in real conversations about our country‚Äôs future.
One of the best ways to do this is to stop allowing bad moderators who ask gotcha questions that are not substantive. I hope the @DNC will make that a part of these debates. Let‚Äôs have diverse, talented moderators who are interested in getting into real debates on the issues
I also agree that this is a fantastic way to showcase the diverse talent the Party has to offer the country. I hope we have 10-15 strong candidates who vigorously debate the smartest way to provide health care to more Americans, to reduce income inequality, etc.
I could not agree more that traditional polling should not be the driver of who is on what stage. Grassroots fundraising is one key indicator of seriousness of candidates. So is their commitment to organizing &amp; digital. Would love to see these factored into debate selection.

It‚Äôs exactly what we see in Texas. If people vote &amp; the electorate looks like the population, it will be a battleground state. And we are seeing evidence that the energy &amp; enthusiasm is there.
The single biggest threat to our democracy is not Trump &amp; the Republican Party that enables his authoritarianism, corruption, lawlessness, abuse of power. It‚Äôs indifference. It‚Äôs people not voting. We can change all this if we vote. It‚Äôs that simple.
And he made it clear that complaining, despair, anger are not enough. He always brings it to a call to action. His passion for people participating in their democracy is invigorating. ‚ÄúWhat is going to fix this democracy is you.‚Äù
He also talked about the reasons to vote for Democratic candidates &amp; their vision for a more just, progressive world without equivocation. We have to be running for something.

@JHagner @alexburnsNYT Less resourced doesn‚Äôt mean begging. It means getting more volunteer leadership to scale. It‚Äôs just not what any of the border states did. Those Organizers were some of the best partly bc they had fewer resources.
@JHagner @alexburnsNYT DSCC, the state parties, etc were investing in states where there wasn‚Äôt overlap. It shouldn‚Äôt be presidential campaign job to run everything. Those committees btw get to spend way less in BG states. We have to think of it as a team game &amp; stop relying on prez campaign to do all
@JHagner @alexburnsNYT Sure, you can disagree w border state programs run by a presidential candidate.
