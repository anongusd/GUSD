3 will crush families w/ kids. Third it eliminates deduction for state &amp; local taxes. So if you live in NY, NJ, PA (esp Philly) u pay more.
2 GOP plan hurts in a few ways. First it RAISES the bottom tax bracket from 10% to 12%. Second it eliminates the personal exemption. That
1 GOP tax plan really helps the super rich. That's obvious and not disputed. Less obvious but very important is that it HURTS working class.

Great to see #NotreDameFootball dominating MSU
@anna_coppedge @Mussallem ND is an independent for football. For other sports, the ACC isn't bad but I liked it better when it was in the Big East w/ Gtown, Nova, etc
@bcawley15 @Mussallem I also meant beyond sports too. Vandy is a small, private, top notch academic institution in a conference with no other like schools.
@Mussallem Good point. But I'd still vote for Vandy in the SEC as a worse fit. They should be in the ACC instead.
Random college football comment: I always forget Vanderbilt is in the SEC. This may be the worst fit in the entire NCAA.

They hate Obama so much they're now hellbent on repealing what was the GOP healthcare plan for 20 years before Obama supported it. https://t.co/etvBBeT6Q3
The GOP has only 1 goal on healthcare: end Obamacare. Why? Because it was done by Obama. That's all this is about for them. #TrumpCare
But they all have the same 2 things in common: they all get to universal coverage and do so for less $$ than we spend on health care.
UK gets to universal coverage through socialized medicine. France, Germany, and others get to universal coverage through hybrid model.
Friendly reminder that universal coverage and "socialized medicine" aren't the same thing.
