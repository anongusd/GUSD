@ElectedMob no law has a 100% success rate. not sure thats an argument to give up on all laws.
@ElectedMob its easy to find https://t.co/Umw0Dac3PT
@ElectedMob no one believes every single death will stop from 1 law change, no law fixes 100%. does that mean we don't do anything?
@ElectedMob I hear you.  yes, likely, but pills, knives etc people do tend to survive. w a gun chances are almost zero.
@ElectedMob people that don't use a gun tend to survive. those that have access to guns don't. immediate access = big diff. very sad truth.
@JohnnyBGoode33 I'll call it the private sale loophole from now on.
@ElectedMob calls out for a multi prong approach, no single fix. surprised you want more fed involvement :) thx for your time + ideas.
@ElectedMob most gun deaths are suicides. easy access seems to be an issue across the board 4 suicide &amp; crime. also far 2 many accidents.
@ElectedMob we clearly disagree, send recommendations if you have them. no need for personal attacks. I'm assuming you aren't for tragedy.

@ElectedMob @sedallas easy for anyone to get a gun. suicides, accidents &amp; murder are in a completely different league than anywhere on earth
