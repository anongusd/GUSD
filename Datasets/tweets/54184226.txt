@iamcardib Will you please start twerking in the middle of the SOTU, that would be great. Thanks!
@DiannasRose @michaeljknowles It's sad how a smile is misconstrued as hate just because of a red hat.
@RepJohnYarmuth You are an embarrassment to the people you serve.
@RepMcGovern Did you have your hearing aid on, because America heard it.
@PaulinaDedaj Nice job! Just another MSM sheep. 5 minutes of work and you could of found multiple holes concerning the the Indigenous People March story. What's wrong? The truth doesn't fit the agenda? When did chastising kids become the narrative? Real journalism is dead, thanks
@JamesMartinSJ @NCRonline You should be apologizing to your students, you've failed them today. I guess you can't be bothered with facts. Did you see the video that shows the American Hero backing your kids in a corner? This young man was doing his best, held his composer far better than many would have.
@realDonaldTrump The mockery lies in the falsifying of heritage, I'm glad that you remind Americans of the true tragedy. Taking advantage of the government to better your education and wealth is wrong. If she'll scam the government once, she'll do it again.
@davidhogg111 Sure, I can see how someone as simple minded as you can think that.

@travisjnichols @realDonaldTrump or you'll burn American business and violently attack those that oppose you?? https://t.co/FVi4STf7Rk
@realDonaldTrump Keep fighting the good fight Mr. President.
