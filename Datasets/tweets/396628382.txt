@Markjo189 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump He claimed responsibility when it was up. Funny thing is that probably very little of this is his responsibility...or Obama's for that matter. But he asked for it when he equated the market with a booming economy

@ByBuckyGleason Should people be wary of McDaniels because of the Belichick coaching tree? I'd be happy if the Bills don't get him. Thanks

@LukeRussert Minnesota got it last year. Cleveland won the lottery in 3 of the previous 4 years. That right there is proof it isn't rigged
@LukeRussert you think it's rigged because the 76ers got the first pick? Over the Celtics and the Lakers?
@ByTimGraham Wow did you call that? Or are you just announcing the pick before Goodell?
@TBNSully Suppose Tunsil lasts until 19...Does Buffalo bite? Right side is weak...
@mikerodak do other NFL nation reporters do this for their teams? Curious to know if there is a bias toward picking teams they cover to win

@YahooNoise @MarkusZurlino @Robtichenor wouldn't that make it a push though?
@JeremyWGR the original Otis Redding version? Or did they change the lyrics to how the Panthers "are happenin'"? No prob if it's original
@ChildrensVPhila Hello, are you open tomorrow? Thanks.
@Schopptalk At least Bills didn't whiff. Newton or Miller definitely would look great in Buffalo though
#PITvsDEN so on 4th and 1, have the guy with torn shoulder ligaments throw it 40 yards into double coverage...
@psychologicaI @24_7Farnsworth context please?
@scott_pianowski because you have to win the toss AND score a  TD. If you don't, Larry Fitzgerald happens

#PITvsCIN when did Rex Ryan start coaching the Bengals?
@Schopptalk at least the Aud was indoors
#PITvsCIN Marvin Lewis content to punt from 38 yard line in first quarter...despite his 0-6 record in playoffs. Has he learned nothing?
@JoeBuscaglia @ADP248 do they have similar needs as the Bills? Would it matter if they are ahead of Buffalo?
@JeremyWGR maybe, but I'm so SICK of watching the same teams and players in the playoffs with such little turnover. Yes I'm jealous
@briandottPA nice timing with the thunder clap
@ByTimGraham Horrible clock management by Chip Kelly.
@Fred22Jackson Congrats. Hope you win it all. #BillsMafia
@YardsPerPass @JeremyWGR Pitt has an exceptional offense. How many other teams are capable of this? Certainly not the Bills...
@TBNSully horrible call
@MatthewWGR clock only stops within last 5:00 of the 4th quarter
@Schopptalk the Eagles have maybe a dozen plays in the book.
@MarkMaske I mean, they could have used EJ Manuel to make the throw
@TBNSully Giving ball back to Brady is never a good idea when you need two scores
@salmaiorana Giving ball back to Brady is never a good idea when you need two scores in the fourth quarter
@mikerodak Looked like he had single coverage on the last play. Taylor didn't even look that direction.
@UncleChaps @JeremyWGR Fake account
@mikerodak That's unfortunate
@JeremyWGR honestly, they looked like outclassed losers against Bengals, Giants, and Patriots
@TBNSully just run the same column you wrote last year
@Schopptalk if you are kicking off at the 50, what is the downside of attempting an onside kick?
@Anthony_Becht @JeremyWGR @buffalobills respect him with a spot on the 53-man roster
@NFL_FanTeam_Ldr maybe, but Alonso is coming off of his 2nd major knee injury. Just sayin'
@butterflybeat the egg was laid today. I saw the female.
@butterflybeat I kept the leaf moist, tool. I have 1 milkweed plant at home that's in a water bottle. Is it possible that I damaged the egg?

@salmaiorana Matt Cassel?
@ByDavidMurphy Yes, true. Thought you were referring to trades and/or FA contracts. Spiller was a luxury they couldn't afford.
@ByDavidMurphy When have they overpaid before? If you're referring to Bryce Brown...4th round pick. Otherwise, you have it wrong.

@NYDNSports Stop using "gate" as a suffix! It's played!
@keithlaw @CJNitkowski God I know! WHY do media perpetrate the continuation of this travesty?
@salmaiorana Focusing on "obscure" playoff losses, 1998 game at Miami where Moulds had a million yards. Flutie fumbles with a chance to win
@salmaiorana Feel like the usual suspects have already been mentioned. How about Bills-Jags, AFC Wild Card, 1996?
@cjakhaenna @KCJoynerTFS Yes, but Herm would also have kicked FG's on those 4th and goals.
@salmaiorana Weak 1st half FG's on 4th and goal as well. The loss is squarely on him.
@YahooNoise and all you had to do was start watching with 2:30 left in the 4th quarter.
@KCJoynerTFS McCarthy's wimpy 1st half decisions to kick FG's aren't helping.
@salmaiorana Punt down 2 scores with less than 7 minutes left...is Marrone the guest coach for Seattle?
@bobwojnowski @KCJoynerTFS What about AFC championship in 1990? Raiders QB had 150 yards total in the game with 5 INTS.

@975TheFanatic if he was such an offensive innovator he wouldn't have attempted a 46 yd fg on 4th and 1. D didn't lose it today, Chip did.
@DanGrazianoESPN @tedpickrell008 What?
@JeremyWGR It's not even about the math at this point. It's a lack of understanding of the Bills recent history.
@salmaiorana Should I be happy that Chargers won? I don't think so but I'm not sure.
@Schopptalk Should I be happy that Chargers won? I don't think so but I'm not sure.
@darrenrovell @faketeams Teachers, cops, doctors, nurses and firefighters are GROSSLY underpaid in our society.
@JeremyWGR it was a scoring play so why can't they review it?
@Schopptalk yeah. gutless
@ABCPolitics @briandottPA @ABC Yeah but I haven't seen any results from the polls
@975TheFanatic And decision to kick FG on 4th and 1. Playing not to lose.
@salmaiorana Good teams rise above bad officiating.
@newskag I'm a math teacher (on lunch break), and I'll believe that I'm getting new textbooks when I see them.
@TheRealPodVader Keep picking against the Bills and making it your "lock of the week," please. No playoffs in 14 years is too long.
@ByTimGraham If the switch to Orton is a "win now" move, what was that FG attempt on 4th and 1?
@TBNSully Gutless.

@MatthewBerryTMR Quick foray into baseball? Can you rank these 3 for dynasty league? Welington Castillo, Nick Franklin, Adeiny Hechavarria.
@MikeVacc thanks for the columns
@MikeVacc It was Don Beebe who ran down Leon Lett in super bowl 27. Tasker blocked a punt in that game.
@JonandSeanShow  Moreno had the Broncos' first first down of the game.
@JonandSeanShow  Just checked play-by-play. Welker didn't have Denver's 1st 1st down reception. D. Thomas did.
@BWilliamsonESPN how do you recover from that without some questionable supplements?
@KCJoynerTFS clock is still running..
@LarryHolder So when Bush began to hit him, he was aimed at Harvin's chest. Intent wasn't to hit him on the head. Will the rule be revised?
@SigmundBloom Bunk. That's what. QB sneak. Fall forward for a first. Having a staring contest in the NFL like that is bush-league.
@JeremyWGR R Cooper should have been cut in August. G Bernard is safe though. Early in the game = not important. At least according to #13.
@JeremyWGR Alex Henery should be cut. Also Steve Johnson should be cut because it's an accumulation of critical mistakes over several years.
@MikeMiss975 should have gone for 2. Then it would be game over
@BuffNewsVogl @pham1717 Zing!
@ESPNFantasy Does Antonio Brown get any extra points for the last play? Can you update the protocol on the site?
@MikePereira @TBNSully  That is a joke, right?
@Schopptalk FYI Sixers defeat the Bulls 107-104. They are now 3-0 with wins over the Heat and Wizards as well. Think GM Sam Hinkie is happy?
@Schopptalk analytics says yes
@JohnnyGoodtimes Yep, relived the entire thing. It was very good.
@JohnnyGoodtimes Beyond catastrophes and tragedies, I've never felt such empathy with another person in my life as I did with Bartman.
@JeremyWGR After 13 of them, a losing year only remains interesting for so long, though, regardless of the side-plots with this team.
@LukeRussert Maybe, but 2-4 this year is the same as 2-4 in 2006. New Orleans up next week. Another year without playoffs blows
@TBNSully I'll bet that the the Bills offense doesn't see the ball the rest of the day.
@JeremyWGR True, but most likely they'll be 2-4. All 2-4's are alike.
@Schopptalk Take away the last Bengal possession to end the half, and that average drive start becomes....the 16
@Schopptalk tracts
@TBNSully Yep, sneak should have been the call. Why turn your back to the line on 4th and inches?
@Shirlez23 The guy has an ankle injury. Why don't you tweet about McDonalds or something worthwhile?

@nflnetwork Hey redzone. The Panthers-Bills are in the red zone and you guys are showing us non scoring opportunities. Wake up.
