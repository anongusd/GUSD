@BravenakBlog @linvivian You got it, boss.
@politicalnook @BravenakBlog @linvivian Yes.
@BravenakBlog @linvivian Ok look, I'm not here to fight with you. I just hope you get out and vote blue in November, so we can all wake up from this nightmare. We dems are good at arguing, debating, going at it even among ourselves as you can see, while the reds plow over us with their blind fanaticism.
@BravenakBlog @linvivian But more importantly and the point I was trying to make: Bernie actually CARES about the middle class and the poor. Not a single soul in the GOP gives us a passing thought except to come up with another idea to rip us off as the massive uneducated consumers we mostly are.
@BravenakBlog @linvivian That's not what he says. He wants the VERY rich to pay as much as WE DO prorata, which they DON'T. The VERY rich pay RELATIVELY VERY LITTLE, and even though they are only 0.5-1%, if they paid the SAME prorata as WE DO, lots of problems would be solved, they'd STILL be VERY RICH.
@BravenakBlog @linvivian By the way, I don't mean to blow my own horn but I have a master's degree in economics, and I can tell you that if the US Gov't REALLY WANTED to make education and healthcare affordable to us all, it is something they could do. The status quo is the problem; they live off it all.
@linvivian @BravenakBlog Ma daaaaaai, cara mia. What are we doing fighting among ourselves when we should be coming together to avoid the end of the world at the hands of a total psycho? Bernie is on our side, so let him have his say. I'm sure he's done a lot more for us than anyone on the other side.

@DaddyDaddymac A question for #TrumpSupporters #MAGA #MAGA2020.
@jenandjanstwits Arguing, unfortunately, rarely changes anything in a good way. I try to act as a conduit for information I feel is valuable and should have more exposure than I think it is already getting. We need to act as a network that promotes/distributes the most valuable info - and comedy.
@jenandjanstwits @ReneeCloyd1 @liveluv707 @YesSirJames @HoarseWisperer I see. I wouldn't take it as a 100% given in that case. And I prefer to ask for forgiveness instead of permission for such a harmless act as this.
Trump is so certain that the #BlueWave will take over, that his promised 10% TAX CUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS (!) only works IF the Dems don't take over. This would be a BIG promise to back out of (more than Warren's million...) so he must think the #BlueWave will happen... Thoughts?
@SassyKadiK It's the mid-game meeting with his coach. Depending on how the US's biggest enemy, the Dems, do in the midterms, the coach will adapt the plan accordingly for Donnie to be able to get that end-run just right. Donnie's got small hands so preparation is indispensable.

@AnitaSummers57 @keesgarden I'm not sure Anita. It depends on how you define "young people" - 18-25? 18-30?  But one fact you can look up easily is that millennials voted very little in 2016 and are not planning to vote a whole lot more in November - yet if they did they'd go #BlueWave

@realDonaldTrump @March_for_Life You are full of shit, and everyone knows it including your closest friends and family.  Go jump in a lake - although that would probably make it toxic for the next couple of centuries.
The GOP controls the White House, Senate, House, a Supreme Court pick, and most governorships and state houses... and @realDonaldTrump blames the #GovernmentShutdown on @SenSchumer!? LMFAO - at midnight, it seems POTUS also turned into the world's BIGGEST FUCKING PUMPKIN.

@realDonaldTrump will you put me on the list to come and visit you when you're in the cell next to your son-in-law?  I'll bring you some good jokes, I promise.  One of them I came up with is "everyone loves you". Like it?
If @realDonaldTrump farted and spoke at the same time, would the forest give a shit?

@realDonaldTrump I just wanted to say, you stable genius, you... If you hadn't invented the word FAKE, right now I wouldn't know how to characterize this very tweet, from the bottom of my heart...
@realDonaldTrump isn't it time for your 121st day off so you can cheat rich golfers instead of American Taxpayers? In case you're hesitating.... we hid a triple-cheeseburger on the 19th hole. GO!
@realDonaldTrump America will be great again when you are either in an insane asylum, a coffin, a jail, or a combination of the above. So yes I agree, let's MAGA! MAGA ALL THE WAY!
