@AmazonEve Please don't spread C-16 lies.
@AmazonEve Please link to the Arrow Gender court documents you're referencing.
@AmazonEve No, it doesn't. Whoever told you that lied to you. The Canadian Supreme court was very, very clear about what C-16 covered.
@AmazonEve If you think that's what postmodern philosophy is, you're mistaken. 		Acting like Republicans in the Cohen hearing this week has nothing to do with postmodern philosophy.
@AmazonEve I hear you making that assertion. What I don't yet get is you explaining how my "taxonomy/epistemology is PoMo" rejects Modernist philosophy. Specifically, what attribute of my discourse rejects Modernism?

@AmazonEve Any private business that doesn't use public funding (tax breaks, SBA loans, city contracts, etc) probably should be able to discriminate. However, business relying upon public funds need to serve all equally.
@AmazonEve Us/Them conflict isn't new and has always existed. Why do you believe this feature of human subject/object cognition is "Marx/PoMo" (which, again, isn't a phylosophical thing). 		Are you using "Marx/PoMo" as a euphmism for someone saying "they have it better than us"?
@AmazonEve "Marx/PoMo" isn't a thing. 		Are you maybe talking about Materialist analysis? Are you saying Materialism sounds like weak Functionalism?
@AmazonEve I mean, if you apply that value upon another, sure. 		But most folks transition to the degree that is right for them. Certainly, that's the approach we support.

@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Actually, I'm exactly with my language. You're the one who seems to want to pretend that ontologies are material reality. Radical feminists have critiqued the construction of body binaries since the 1940s.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Do you oppose trans &amp; intersex women being, "female and already have the rights that come along with that"? 		Fun fact: "intersex" isn't a binary.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Or, you know, strawman the person you're debating instead of engaging honestly, amirite? /s https://t.co/Dp7CJFiryI
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Ah, euphemisms; the bigot's last figleaf. 		The "subjects" we disagree about is trans and intersex women being women under the law. 		You think the law should engage us as men, we (and all the other actual medial, psych, &amp; legal orgs) disagree. But we're blind, eh?
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Yes, bodies and terms used for bodies are different things.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate Tell me truthfully: do you think the politics you‚Äôre promoting right now would be welcome at the anti-abortion anti-LGBT hate groups that fund the TERF movement?		Common, be truthful. Your best guess: yes or no ü§®
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate What you‚Äôr doing is pretending that policy is procedure. You‚Äôre also pretending that policy exists independent of caselaw.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC @UKTransadvocate We‚Äôre not the ones being paid by actual hate groups to advocate against trans and intersex women. That‚Äôs the TERF movement.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC (Hey, @UKTransadvocate, remember that time UK TERFs to came to America to harass American trans women and dictate American legal policy. Oh, and didn‚Äôt an anti-abortion anti-LGBT hate group pay for it?)		I‚Äôm sorry Ben, what were you saying about sticking noses in other countries?

@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Strawman. Maybe deal with the critique being made instead of trying to sidestep it by pretending that I just said you're bad for disagreeing with me. Your rhetoric comes from somewhere. Let's talk about where it comes from.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC No, I'm referring to Raymond's dialectic.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC The fact is that you're pushing a slogan promoted by a TERF group funded by anti-abortion right-wingers. This is either true or it's not. 		(Psst... it's true.)
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Yeah, TERF dialectic is exceptionally easy to spot. It's full of rhetorical memes --slogans if you will-- that are appealed to as if they were axiomatic.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Yes, I agree that you're pushing a very specific ideology that is funded by American right-wingers.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Please don't strawman me. What I act like is that there exists an easily identifiable TERF dialectic pioneered in the 1970s and that this very specific TERF dialectic is used by people who both do and do not identify as TERFs.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC OOoooh. You're one of those people who gripe about POMOism without knowing what you're talking about. 		BTW, your entire metanarrative argumentation is POMOist.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC I think a lot of people (both male and females) get called "TERF" because they're pushing the dialectic TERF opinion leader, Janice Raymond pioneered.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Ah, you're a fan of 'bigotry of bigotry is bigotry' logic, eh?
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC And almost all bigots will say that, due to terms applied to them to describe the nature of their bigotry, they are also victims of slurs. The dialectic of any sex essentialist activist was pioneered by a TERF. One need not self-ID as a TERF to promote TERFlogic.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Actually, I've seen many who do. Even a certain infamous TERF attorney took to FB to declare she was a TERF. 		The whole "shut down debate" trope is rhetoric pulled right out of the right wing's playbook.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC I think most bigots would say that regarding **any** term, applied to them, denoting their bigotry.
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Post into a reply where I said you were pro-Trump. 		The reality is that TERF orgs are funded by the American evangelical right. The reality is that TERFs work hand-in-hand with anti-abortion, pro-Trump groups. 		Go on, deny it üòÇ
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC These are patches that you can buy. By **your** metric (certainly not mine), is racist and homophobe a slur? https://t.co/l5HxEHHwL5
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Ah, the NS and Ditum, who revels in ahistroical myths and can't work in academia now because she's too much of an edgelord for all those squares, eh?
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC Trumpers do the same thing you're doing to promote the notion that "racist" is a slur. 		https://t.co/I3Upc15spx
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC If your slur metric is shitposts from social media, you tell me:		https://t.co/G0aK6oOmTi		When applying your "TERF is a slur" metric to "racist," is "racist" a slur? Or are you relying upon special pleading to validate your slur metric?
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC But nevermind that TERFs actually tried to murder trans women like Sandy Stone, that they beat trans-inclusive radfems like Robin Tyler, or that they threatened trans-inclusive Lesbian Avengers with a knife. https://t.co/l6j0xskxxW
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC If the metric you're using for slur is shitposts on Twitter, then, to be logically consistent, you also think misogynist is also a slur because people shitpost about misogynists, correct? I mean, I wouldn't agree, but this is your metric, not mine. https://t.co/KBIbXvAAKQ
@BennWaddington @GMPCityCentre @HRC TERFs created the "TERF is a slur" and "Cis is a slur" campaigns in 2013 after the American right-wing's successful 2012 "Homophobe is a slur" campaign. Repeating the campaign slogan won't make this not demonstrably true.

@GromeThea I'm wondering if Posie removed it because she figured out the American press doesn't have the anti-trans bias that the Brittish press does or if @facebook itself removed it because she's harassing a trans woman for being a trans woman.

@mesce11 @afterellen Ah, great. Then we agree that a trans woman‚Äôs phenotype is female, materially speaking. Correct?
@mesce11 @afterellen Biological sex = ontological sex
@mesce11 @afterellen Does your ideology prevent you from admitting that material phenotype is an aspect of sex?
@mesce11 @afterellen Ah, you belive sexuality is the sexual attraction to ontology and not one‚Äôs material body.

@HairyLeggdHarpy @LilyLilyMaynard Gender nonconformity is a GREAT thing and should be welcomed without trying to push folks in any direction. 		If you think phenotype dysphoria is about gender stereotypes, you fundamentally misunderstand why trans ppl transition their phenotypes.
@ErikaESoaring Why would you assert that mere "reality" is oppressive? 		Do you believe that Marxism was at work before 1875?
@HairyLeggdHarpy @LilyLilyMaynard Yes, humans ***as a species*** --not individually-- are sexually dimorphic. 		I totally get that you think "sex" is reducible to one essential attribute and is thus immutable. You're wrong, but I get that you operating from a place of misinformation and ontological dependence.

@LilyLilyMaynard That was great right up until you encouraged people to lie to kids. 		I mean, I 100% agree with everything you wrote, except for the lie about MAAB kids never being able to transition to another sexed class. That does, in fact, happen for lots of trans and intersex folks.
@HairyLeggdHarpy @LilyLilyMaynard Why must you strawman me? Why must you pretend that medical dictionaries are ‚Äúunscientific‚Äù because they contradict your medical claims? 		If you have a reasonable argument, you shouldn‚Äôt need to confabulate.

@LilyLilyMaynard @TinyTardigrade Maybe you should take the time to learn your movement‚Äôs history before promoting it? I mean, your movement terrorized many of the most notable radfem groups out there for being trans inclusive: Lesbian Tide, WCLC, Olivia, Cell 16, Lesbian Avengers, Sisters, DoB, etc.
@ErikaESoaring Nonsense. You‚Äôve just claimed that everyone who‚Äôs ever been oppressed in history was a Marxist just because they noticed that another group was killing them. Marxism is way more than us/them dynamics. üôÑ
Many believed that we created @vivsmyth in our 2014 interview because she busted the myth that "TERF" was created a slur by TW against CW. Well, here's Viv's own @guardian piece: "I'm credited with having coined the word 'Terf'. Here's how it happened" 		https://t.co/BChKqnoXcw
@ErikaESoaring Your critique isn't intelligible. 		I get that you think that social constructionism is the same thing as Marxism (it's not), and I get that you seem to have leaped from that misunderstanding to the conclusion of "chaos." 		How you arrived at this error just isn't apparent.

Kids MUST have GD and not be merely GNC.

Only DSM-IV GID research asserts a link, not DSM-5 GD research.
@LilyLilyMaynard @HairyLeggdHarpy If you‚Äôre saying that ‚Äúsex‚Äù actually includes a lot of attributes, genotype and phenotype included, then please let me know so that I can apologize for misunderstanding you and your movement‚Äôs fact claim.
@LilyLilyMaynard @HairyLeggdHarpy I get that it‚Äôs only natural for someone with a head full of Critter ideology to scoff at the notion that ‚Äúsex‚Äù isn‚Äôt reducible to one essentialized attribute that excludes genotype &amp; phenotype.

@HairyLeggdHarpy @LilyLilyMaynard No, the kind of movement that gave you the very specific dialectic you‚Äôre using.		Tell me, how much TERF/GenCritter media ‚Äîblogs, posts, books, lectures, sites, sub-reddits, videos, groups/forums, etc‚Äî have you consumed?
@TinyTardigrade @LilyLilyMaynard These cases are well documented and appear in peer-reviewed papers/reports. Pretending that‚Äôs no so isn‚Äôt helpful to your fact claims.		Would you like me to cite sources? Go ask the cis radfem Robin Tyler if TERFs beat her. Ask the Lesbian Avengers about the TERF knife threat.
@HairyLeggdHarpy @LilyLilyMaynard Did u just claim that a trans woman‚Äôs  female phenotype is unambiguously male because... essentialist reductivism?		I get that it‚Äôs useful rhetoric to pretend that ‚Äúsex‚Äù = only gamete size, &amp; excludes genotype &amp; phenotype. You‚Äôre wrong, but I get why u‚Äôre using this rhetoric.

A trans person is not the same as a person that pretends they‚Äôre a different species. Trans people/bodies materially exist; people who are other species do not. 		Pretending that trans bodies don‚Äôt exist is an erasure.

@GoodKopBadKop @LilyLilyMaynard No. Bodies have sexed attributes, not the other way around. A phenotype is not a body; a body has a phenotype.		A cis doc named Harry Benjamin popularized that trope in his 1960s-eta book as a way to explain the trans experience to other cis people.

Weird how you guys don‚Äôt do the same with your financials, eh?
Nope. 		Instead, you want to have a debate about opinions. You don‚Äôt want to ask their side why they refuse to ask for privacy for ALL cis, trans, &amp; intersex students. Nah, you‚Äôre just happy to support the notion that privacy only exists if trans &amp; intersex bodies go away.
It‚Äôs about ensuring that only cisgender places exist in the same way that DADT wasn‚Äôt about the ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù of straight people. 		I mean, it‚Äôs not like the same arguments aren‚Äôt used against EVERY civil rights struggle. 		But you‚Äôre not gonna tell your readers that, are ya? https://t.co/PtVyS0i8JJ
Instead, what you‚Äôre materially supporting is the notion that ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù = the eradication of trans &amp; intersex bodies to create cisgender-only spaces... all while casually misgendering a school kid.		Real classy üôÑ		It‚Äôs NEVER actually about bathroom or locker rooms.
Hey @USATODAY, fuck you and this nonsense. 		If the issue is ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù then either give every student their own private areas or give all cis, trans, or intersex students who wants it access to a private stall. But that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre supporting here, is it? https://t.co/PR7iZM1hLr
@LilyLilyMaynard Do you not support the analysis of Raymond‚Äôs TS Empire? I mean, it is the foundational thesis that started your movement, &amp; Gender Hurts endorsed.		She states that the goal is to morally mandate transness out of existence. 		Are you saying you reject your movement‚Äôs stated goal?

I‚Äôd believe you if you told the truth and said that your adult kid was in therapy and after a few doc visits, the doc discussed some future docs to check out.		I call BS on your claim that on a second visit the doc instructed him to get surgery.
@HeadHeartLips @LilyLilyMaynard If you‚Äôd like to apply the material analysis of foundational radical feminism, maybe quote Wittig or Dworkin? ‚ÄúWoman‚Äù is defined by her material condition w/in culture. 		Your essentialist ontology is just functionalism, not materialism.

@MPMBlos @LilyLilyMaynard @AlexSharpe64 Yes, I get that you believe that bodies are ontologies. I get that when someone points out this error gencritters get confused. Nonetheless, material bodies are not ontologies.

@LilyLilyMaynard @AlexSharpe64 Can you define ‚Äúsex‚Äù in a way that doesn‚Äôt exclude cis or intersex women? 		I mean, I get that your goal is to define trans people out of existance within society, but you‚Äôre not going to do that without also defining a lot of cis and intersex women out of existence.
Ben -		Pretending that ‚Äúsex‚Äù isn‚Äôt genotype and phenotype won‚Äôt make you right.		Pretending that ontology comes from nature or god(s) won‚Äôt make you right.		Pretending that essentialism and reductionism = science won‚Äôt make you right.		https://t.co/yTSoFlYlI4

@WyeWorry7 @LaurieBHiggins @Transgendertrd BTW your ‚Äúreal/biologial‚Äù designations are, in fact, ontologies. Which do you think constructs ontologies: Nature, God(s), or culture?
@WyeWorry7 @LaurieBHiggins @Transgendertrd As for the material rality of bodies, the end ‚Äúresult‚Äù of transition is dependent upon genotype whereas the ‚Äúresult‚Äù is phenotype.		You applying an ad naturam fallacy to this material reality is about your ideology, not material reality.
@WyeWorry7 @LaurieBHiggins @Transgendertrd So-called ‚Äúpassing‚Äù or culturally communicating oneself &amp; persona as a member of a sexed class is something that most all cis, trans, &amp; intersex women work at. We do this because because culture punitively compels us all ‚Äîyou ‚ÄúSuzy‚Äù included‚Äî to do.
@LaurieBHiggins @WyeWorry7 @Transgendertrd Oooh! The trans = BIID argument! You're new critter, arentcha? Newbies always seem to start there before they read the literature on BIID and realize they're being silly. 		Next, you'll move onto pretending that trans people transition to embody sexist stereotypes.
@LaurieBHiggins @Transgendertrd I mean, if you're talking about IGM, then it's been going on for more than just 20 years. If you're talking about trans surgeries on children, then that's never been ethical. Whoever told you that trans children are getting surgeries lied to you.

@Gerontia @LilyLilyMaynard Noting at all. 		It would, however, be kinda silly to pretend that post-transition trans women have male phenotypes and based upon that mistake, assert that trans women are male.
@TinkDangerClose @naturalworldmom Your own ROGD study shows a 91% persistence rate. Dr. Zucker said that for most GD teens, the outcome is persistence.  What info did you use to conclude that your child would desist? 		If you need referrals to actual professionals, please let us know!
@LilyLilyMaynard If you're talking about trans women, then the same as that cis and intersex women? As you note in your post, the material condition of women defines their experience. That's what it is to live a life 'as a woman.'

Because if you‚Äôre going to be a hate group, apparently you have to make the thing you hate part of the Jewish conspiracy to... conspire? To exist? üôÑ		Hate is just stupid.
@nevelcot @JulieRei There‚Äôs only 1 ROGD study. It‚Äôs a BS unethical study done by an inexperienced trans researcher who lies to the press, but it was published.
@nevelcot @JulieRei You mean, the adolecents weren‚Äôt diagnosed w/GD as children because that diagnosis didn‚Äôt exist when then were children?
@nevelcot @JulieRei Then I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre asking for.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Zucker says that ‚Äúmany‚Äù is around 30%, which is inline with GID persistence rates wherein the vast majority do not ‚Äúpersist‚Äù (ie, transition their phenotype). Most in the mixed GID group did not have GD.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Are you asking how many of the 30% of the kids who actually do have GD will persist into adolescents?
@nevelcot @JulieRei Zucker says, "in adolescence, the most likely outcome is persistence of the GD. 75-80% would continue to have GD. The treatment would be social transition and biomedical treatment."		The ROGD study found a persistence rate of 91%.
@nevelcot @JulieRei He's talking about conversations w/uneducated patents. 		I shared that piece because you asked about, "estimate of the % of GID kids that were diagnosed with GID that werent gender dysphoric." 		Zucker puts that number at around 70%. Only about 30% have GD, the others are GNC. https://t.co/tm4sDOo7Em
@nevelcot @JulieRei Sure: 		Zinck, S., &amp; Pignatiello, A. (2015). External Review of the Gender Identity Clinic of the Child, Youth and Family Services in the Underserved Populations Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Toronto: CAMH.
@nevelcot @JulieRei If you're talking about a category that mixes the few with phenotype dysphoria in with the majority that does not but is gender non-conforming, then all fit within that category. 		That's what was wrong with GID: it pathologized gender non-conformity.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Either one has phenotype dysphoria or they do not. If one doesn't have phenotype dysphoria, there's no need to "transition" one's phenotype. 		Transitioning w/out phenotype dysphoria causes phenotype dysphoria, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
@nevelcot @JulieRei According to Dr. Zucker, after the DSM-5 was published, 70% of the kids he was seeing DID NOT meet the criteria for GD. https://t.co/sTnyCDN3iF
@nevelcot @JulieRei A kid with phenotype dysphoria is not the same as a kid who doesn't have phenotype dysphoria. Pretending that they're the same thing will wind up harming kids
@nevelcot @JulieRei This is what you just said: GD + GNC kids from DSM-IV GID diagnostic pool are the same as the DSM-5 GD diagnostic pool.		That's a mistaken belief on your part.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Bob, GD is not the same diagnostic pool as GDU under the DSM-5. For GD, one must meet the diagnostic criteria for GD; for GDU, one does not need to meet the diagnostic criteria for GD.  		GD and GDU aren't the same thing. Pretending otherwise doesn't make it so.
@nevelcot @JulieRei The requirement for A1 --actual phenotype dysphoria-- in kids **is what makes the DSM-5 GD dx for kids different** than the DSM-IV GID. 		It's why they're two different diagnostic populations.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Here‚Äôs your claim and my claim. 		I asserted that criterium A1 was necessary for children to get a GD dx. You claimed otherwise. 		To support your claim, you‚Äôre now citing a different dx for people who don‚Äôt qualify for GD. https://t.co/xQplb2P10P
@nevelcot @JulieRei Yup. A and B. No C or D. The "Unspecified" specifically relates to the ICD10 F64.9, not the IDC-10 F64.2 pediatric patient code, which is the correlate for the DSM-5 302.6 code for children. Moreover, the UGD category is for those who don't fit the GD category.
@nevelcot @JulieRei C and D? Where did you hear that 302.6 had a C and D? https://t.co/19WKr8zGsK
@nevelcot @JulieRei Here you go. https://t.co/yz7bL3xuoE
@nevelcot @JulieRei I didn‚Äôt deny anything about the ICD-11. 		I denied that you can produce a screenshot of the 8 actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria saying what you claim it says or you can‚Äôt.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Again, this is not the actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria.		Why do you refuse to post the actual 8 criteria?
@nevelcot @JulieRei On this page, where are the 8 criteria that comprise the DSM-5 302.6 section?
@nevelcot @JulieRei A billing code is not a criterium. We‚Äôre discussing the 8 criteria of the DSM-5 302.6.		Show me where in the 8 criteria says what you claim they say.
@nevelcot @JulieRei No criteria is listed on the screenshot.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Instead of pretending that ICD/DSM correlates are itself criteria, maybe read up on this? https://t.co/WUIAy9hHcm
@nevelcot @JulieRei Show me on this page The DSM-5 302.6 criteria.
@nevelcot @JulieRei You can either produce a screenshot of the actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria saying what you claim it says or you can‚Äôt.		Which is it?
@nevelcot @JulieRei You‚Äôre conflating ICD-10 code with the DSM code. What you‚Äôre citing are the ways ICD and DSM codes can correlate.		The F64.9 ICD billing code standard does not appear in the actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria itself. Maybe stick with the actual criteria?
@nevelcot @JulieRei Bob, any games that‚Äôs going on are happening in your own head.		You can either produce a screenshot of the DSM-5 302.6 criteria saying what you claim it says or you can‚Äôt.		Which is it?
@nevelcot @JulieRei Then take a screenshot of the DSM-5 302.6 criteria and show me where it states what you claim it states.
@nevelcot @JulieRei I care about truth. 		You made demonstrably false claims about gender dysphoria.		My assumption is that your gender ideology is probably based upon your misunderstandings.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Yeah, you should ask him where those words appear in the DSM-5 302.6 criteria.		Again, I find it interesting that you want to cite everything but the actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria.
@SoniaClimes @CroneInAMillion @SuptBlackburn @DavidJMunro @policesupers @NatTransPolice @ACCJulieCooke @LGBTpoliceuk I think you‚Äôre talking about what cis people do, not trans people. 		How many billions are spent by cis people each year in diets, surgeries, hair care, meds, etc to embody the cultural male or female ideal?		That‚Äôs not what being trans is about.
@SoniaClimes @CroneInAMillion @SuptBlackburn @DavidJMunro @policesupers @NatTransPolice @ACCJulieCooke @LGBTpoliceuk No, that trope was popularized by Benjamin in the 60s to communicate the trans experience to other cis people. 		No, phenotype dysphoria isn‚Äôt the desire to have another body.
@nevelcot @JulieRei No, it‚Äôs not. The book you‚Äôre citing is not the DSM-5. 		Please don‚Äôt lie.
Activists take aim at anti-LGBTQ ‚Äòhate group,‚Äô Alliance Defending Freedom https://t.co/dk9118SNnu
@nevelcot @JulieRei It says DSM-5 2013 and refers to section 302.6 of the DSM-5, referencing a diagnosis that isn't in the DSM-5. But then again, this isn't the DSM-5 that you're citing, is it? 		Why are you choosing to cite everything except the actual DSM-5 302.6 criteria? It's on page 452.
@nevelcot @JulieRei https://t.co/Ge42RFqV1b
@nevelcot @JulieRei GIDNOS is not in the DSM-5 and even the definition of "gender dysphoria" in the DSM-IV glossary is different than the one in the DSM-5. Specifically, in the DSM-IV, it could mean unhappiness with gender role. That's gone in the DSM-5.

@nevelcot @JulieRei Please screenshot the dx you‚Äôre talking about from the DSM-5 book.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Psychological diagnoses are codified for professional use in the DSM‚Äì5. If it's in in the DSM-5, it's not an actual "diagnosis." For example, a doc can't bill for a "diagnosis" that doesn't exist.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Instead, why not learn from this interaction? Just because a critter tells you something is so, doesn't make it so. Fact check stuff from independent sources. If they make a claim about the DSM-5, then open the actual DSM-5 and fact check it.
@nevelcot @JulieRei What... What do you think "diagnosis" means?
@nevelcot @JulieRei I just LOL'd for real.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ		Your argument just became:		"I DEMAND THAT WE NOT DEAL WITH FACTS BECAUSE I HAVE AN OPINION!!!!!"		Take a screenshot of the ACTUAL DSM-5 302.6 entry for the book and then get back to me.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Yes, you keep posting that as if it were the same thing as the actual medical/psych criteria. It's not. The only source for the medical/psych criteria is in the actual DSM-5 book. 		Open the book, screenshot the 302.6 entry.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Yes, that's nice. 		Now, take a screenshot of the ACTUAL DSM-5 302.6 entry since those standards from the book are the only actual medical/psych standards.  		Go on. I'll wait.
@nevelcot @JulieRei Yes, the DSM-IV GID is defunct. It's a non-diagnosis. The criteria aren't applicable. 		Under the current/valid diagnostic criteria, a child MUST have phenotype dysphoria --and not be merely gender non-conforming-- to get a DSM-5 GD dx. https://t.co/G5QhEecpIL

@nevelcot @JulieRei GID is a mixed diagnostic pool of GD and non-GD gender nonconforming children. You're citing this mixed group to support your claims about GD. 		Either you're lying to people who don't know the difference between GID and GD or you don't know what you're talking about, Bob.

@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard #TERFlogic: It's "insane" to note that supporting Trump's anti-trans agenda isn't feminist or liberal. 		Let me guess, you think sanity =  supporting Trump's anti-trans agenda because it's feminist and liberal. Right? üôÑ https://t.co/Ll91DjfcLb
@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard You claim you don't support Trump. That's a lie. You 100% support his anti-trans positions. 		You can't be liberal or a feminist while also supporting the guy who admits he sexually assaults women and peeps into the changing rooms of girls.
@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard Okay, I just wanted to make sure that you're saying that you and Trump agree: you both transsexual women are men. Correct?
@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard No, you didn't. You prevaricated, which speaks volumes. 		Just answer this simple question: "Do you believe transsexual women are women? Because Trump doesn't."		https://t.co/N26Lxwbh67

A HUGE congratulations to Massachusetts for obliterating the anti-trans "bathroom bill" #question3! More than twice as many voted for #trans #equality than voted for discrimination. What a repudiation of hate! 		WELL DONE #YesOn3MA!!!
@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard So, just clear everything up here and now: in what explicit ways does your trans policy differ from Trump's trans policy? 		Do you believe transsexual women are women? Because Trump doesn't.
@Coffee__Grind @LilyLilyMaynard Translation: "I really don't want to acknowledge that I support Trump's agenda because I know that makes me a bigot."
@E8Emma @LilyLilyMaynard "Am a left wing lesbian feminist" 		And yet, you support Trump's agenda. That's neither "left wing" nor "feminist."

@thinkandblinkp2 @SuesanwithanE @EntitledOwn @dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Are you asserting that within the last 3 years, the persistence rate has changed?
@Dex_starz @dad_gc @LilyLilyMaynard @RGFrederickson @TakeLuckSerious @Krenzle @SuesanwithanE @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD It‚Äôs equally important to not conflate gender nonconformity with phenotype dysphoria.

Phenotype dysphoria isn‚Äôt about gender roles, stereotypes, or hierarchies. 		Certainly all gender nonconforming kids should be supported and loved, not pushed in any direction or pathologized.
@thinkandblinkp2 @SuesanwithanE @EntitledOwn @dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD That‚Äôs from Dr. Zucker himself talking about his clinical experiance, post-DSM-5 in ~2015.
@dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @SuesanwithanE @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Weird how you‚Äôre using an article that only cites old defunct DSM-IV GID data (GD + GNC kids) instead of modern DSM-5 GD (just GD kids) data.
@piratekween07 @EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard As a PIV rape survivor, the notion that my vagina will rape someone because of birth categories seems like ideology, not reason.
@piratekween07 @Shy_Survivor @EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Systemic category oppression is imposed upon categories by the system. In this case, culture. Bodies are not oppressive; the culture in which they exist is the issue.
@EveEndor @ReclaimTheBody @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yes, unconscious people breath. Are you claiming that because unconscious people breath, conscious people don‚Äôt apply ontology to their perception of material reality?
@EveEndor @piratekween07 @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Are you claiming that my examples in the tweet you‚Äôre replying to don‚Äôt exist because catigory averages or are you merely saying catigory averages exist?
@SuesanwithanE @EntitledOwn @dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Under the old defunct DSM-IV GID rubric, those 70% GNC kids would have qualified for a GID dx. However, nowadays, thankfully, mere GNC is not enough to get a DSM-5 GD dx for kids.
@SuesanwithanE @EntitledOwn @dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Which is why it has all that quantitative data that shows a 91% persistence rate... which is a bit higher than the ~80% DSM-5 GD persistence rate Dr. Zucker claims trans teens have.		Note that post-DSM-5, 70% of the kids Zucker saw did not have DSM-5 GD; they were only GNC. https://t.co/ITLKFn2hkY
@Gerontia @dad_gc @LilyLilyMaynard @SuesanwithanE @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Nope. You‚Äôre just wrong.
@dad_gc @RGFrederickson @TakeLuckSerious @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @SuesanwithanE @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD Yeah, a cis doc in the 1960s created the ‚Äúborn in the weong body‚Äù trope to explain the teans experience to other cis folk.		Phenotype dysphoria does not mean that trans people think we‚Äôre ‚Äúborn in the wrong body.‚Äù

@thinkandblinkp2 @SuesanwithanE @EntitledOwn @dad_gc @Krenzle @LilyLilyMaynard @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD You mean GID studies.

@Krenzle @dad_gc @LilyLilyMaynard @SuesanwithanE @ncoldteacup @LostinFife @BlanchardPhD There‚Äôs only 1 ROGD study. The persistence rate in that study is 91%.
@radley_ms @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Actually, Dana‚Äôs ‚Äúwake up‚Äù was having Brennan tell the truth: Dana is not any different to TERFs than any other trans person... even after being talked into signing a UN letter asking them to revoke trans protections.
@EveEndor @ReclaimTheBody @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard You‚Äôre not conceptualizing bodies as concepts?
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Oh, I get that you 100% believe that you don‚Äôt use categories when categorizing bodies. It‚Äôs why this convo is interesting.
@EveEndor @ReclaimTheBody @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Is thay not what you‚Äôre invested in doing?
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard I‚Äôve no delusion your ideology will change. This convo is interesting o to me because you‚Äôe willing to stay true to your convictions and make very specific claims about ontology.

@EveEndor @ReclaimTheBody @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Please post into a reply where I claimed that ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt tell who is male or female.‚Äù		All I‚Äôve done is:		1.) inquire about your ontological constructs; and,	2.) assert that bodies/reproduction and your thoughts about it are 2 different things.
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard You‚Äôre claim a sexed category is known by instinct.
@Shy_Survivor @EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Pretending that racist laws don‚Äôt define the material consitions of Black folk is ignorant.
@Shy_Survivor @EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard As a PIV rape survivor, I certainly agree with body autonomy.
@EveEndor @ReclaimTheBody @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Ah, thank you. You‚Äôre saying one of the ways *you* categorize sex is via behavior.

@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Again, you seem to be claiming that your ontology is based on sight: phenotype. 		If you find yourself appealing to essentialism or reductionism, you‚Äôre doing gender.
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Bodies aren‚Äôt ontologies. That‚Äôs gender you‚Äôre *thinking* about.
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Are you saying that one‚Äôs phenotype defines one‚Äôs material condition within culture?
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Nothing can be ‚Äúgrafted‚Äù onto reality.		There is only the material reality of bodies and reproduction. Your thoughts about that reality *is* gender.
@EveEndor @Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Bodies and reproduction materially exists. Your thoughts about that reality are thoughts. 		Weird how you ‚Äúcritical‚Äù folks think thoughts exist outside of their heads.

@LilyLilyMaynard @Voroux Danielle, pay attention to the answer. 		Lilly, are you claiming that trans women don't have phenotype dysphoria and that what is medically transitioned isn't phenotype?
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, screenshotting that gem. Get back with us in 2 years. https://t.co/2CyVd60qND
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, no. Medical transition is about phenotype dysphoria.		Once you've been out for a decade or more, you'll figure that ontology isn't the problem.
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yup. Maybe look up Dana's old site on the wayback machine. She said everything you've just said. 		You just haven't yet figured out gencritters think all of that about you.
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, pretending that trans women transition because they "feel like a woman" is a beloved TERF trope. 		But tell me, are any of those 5 items untrue?
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard You even use the exact rhetoric Dana did on her site.
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Let me guess:		1.) U transitioned less than 5 years ago.	2.) U feel empowered right now.	3.) U know the umbrella is the problem.	4.) U know you stand in solidarity w/women.	5.) GenCritters have been nice to u, unlike folks like me.		But u're tots different than the others, right?
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Go on, tell me you don't sound like Dana. https://t.co/G3ZkSTYSo2
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, you sound EXACTLY like Dana Taylor when she was in your spot.
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Riiight. You're tots different. 		You're not vulnerable, you're feeling empowered, right? 	They don't really think YOU'RE a man like those nasty AGPs, right? 		Surely you won't wind up like the TS Sep who signed the UN letter asking them to stop protecting trans women, right?
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yup. You are. And it always seems to take TS Seps who align with TERFs a year or 2 to figure out they hate you, that they see you as a man, that they want you to detransition, and that they used your vulnerability to dupe you into being their fool.
@Voroux @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, it's not like we've not heard this from others. It's going to take you 6 mo to a year to figure out those you align yourself w/think YOU are a man and a possible rapist. It'll take you another 6 mos to a year to leave your gencritter ID. 		Get back to us then.

@ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard Ah, and we‚Äôre back to ontology; this time constructed by... ‚Äúnature‚Äù did you say?		Please list the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù attributes only ever found in the body of someone with a phallus.
@ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard Yes, phenotype exists on a spectrum. 		Are you sure you want to stand by your assertion that, "genitalia is absolute and binary"?
@ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard To be clear, you're not, in fact, claiming that phenotype is only phallus/no-phallus, correct?
@ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, both are ontologies.
@floraetlabora @ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard Yeah, that's not horseshoe theory. In this case, it's anti-woman/LGBT right-wingers and pro-woman/LGB left-wingers sharing the same anti-trans dialectic.
@ArcherBM @LilyLilyMaynard Actually, yeah. I'm pretty good with ontology. 		Apparently, you believe phenotype means with or without a penis, correct? https://t.co/qjz0DWJO69

@SoniaClimes @LilyLilyMaynard @mimmymum @Transgendertrd @cwknews @BuzzFeedLGBT @PatrickStrud @BuzzFeedNews @TransActualUK @TransMediaWatch @AllAboutTrans Oh, the 1970s-era Sissy-Boy Syndrome "study" that conflates gender expression with gender orientation, I know well. I also know well the BS DSM-IV GID category that did the same thing so it could pathologize gender nonconformity,
@LilyLilyMaynard @SoniaClimes @mimmymum @Transgendertrd @cwknews @BuzzFeedLGBT @PatrickStrud @BuzzFeedNews @TransActualUK @TransMediaWatch @AllAboutTrans I did read through the fist couple of posts. I saw a lot of openions, dubious claims, and ideology.

@Gerontia @LilyLilyMaynard The talking point from anti-trans folks is that it's risky. They pretend that we don't have 20+ years of data on trans kids w/long-term follow-up. They also conflate trans kids with precocious puberty kids to support their claims, pretending there's only 1 drug for trans kids.

If you believe ROGD, then you‚Äôre claiming that cis kids catch and truely become trans websites, books, friends, etc.		This is just a recycling of decades-old bs conversion therapy rhetoric.
@FMStomp @LilyLilyMaynard @mimmymum @Transgendertrd @cwknews @BuzzFeedLGBT @PatrickStrud @BuzzFeedNews @TransActualUK @TransMediaWatch @AllAboutTrans Yes, I get that you‚Äôre choosing to pretend that they didn‚Äôt tweet multiple times that these stickers should be used in school. 		Now, what were you saying about truth? https://t.co/7wzQ3VLq11
@Gerontia @LilyLilyMaynard Yup. If the boy likes dolls, let him play with dolls. If he wants to wear a dress, so what? Gender nonconformity is okay!		If, on the other hand, the kid tries to kill themselves because of phenotype dysphoria then, JFC, yes, let them transition.

@WickdTransWitch @TeelaWild In fact, I think this is why TERFs hate "TERF" so much: it rhetorically stops their colinization of the analysis, dialectic, and identity of the radical feminists they beat and tried to murder.
@WickdTransWitch @TeelaWild I always found it interesting that TERFs worked so had for so long to make people think that TERFism is the radical feminism of Olivia, Lesbian Tide, Cell 16, Sisters, West Coast Lesbian Conference, etc.
@WickdTransWitch @TeelaWild Actually, it was Sandy Stone that was about to be murdered by TERFs before radical feminists from the Olivia Collective disarmed them. Sandy was a member of Olivia and Olivia even paid for trans medical care.
@BiologicalWMN @GhoulishGrace @Djinnkitty @AliceMarie420 @KaeleyT @CyberRatXXX @ladyattis @Chr1stinaG @ZJemptv Again, your total lack of class analysis seems strange, especially coming from someone who claims their rhetoric proceeds from radical feminist dialectic.

@charley_asmith @LilyLilyMaynard Perhaps to you, but to trans and intersex women who are regularly targeted by the accounts engaging in this unlawful behavior, they might disagree. They, armed with the posts from these accounts that demonstrate ‚Äúintense dislike‚Äù might find a justice who also disagrees :D
@LilyLilyMaynard @SMacoibicin I suppose the issue is different in each country.

@charley_asmith @LilyLilyMaynard I mean, I suppose the criminal is free to assert any justification that comes to their mind.		But gosh, it would be unfortunate if people were archiving social media posts from these people that express what a reasonable justice might take to be ‚Äúintense‚Äù dislike of trans people.
@HowardTreesong @LilyLilyMaynard Are you making the fact assertion that the women who‚Äôve photographed themselves vandalizing these spaces don‚Äôt also make posts that a reasonable jury wouldn‚Äôt classify as ‚Äúintense‚Äù dislike for trans people?
@SMacoibicin @LilyLilyMaynard Certainly that is unlawful vandalism, tough the vandalism isn‚Äôt directed at a protected class and thus, is not a hate crime.
@HowardTreesong @LilyLilyMaynard A crime that is motived by intense dislike is a hate-motivated crime. https://t.co/5V9soIZi6A
@LilyLilyMaynard After putting your reply through my sarcas-o-meter, it seems that we agree that vandalism is illegal. 		Is this vandalism act part of the well-known TERF campaign of placing such stickers around spaces currently frequented by cis, trans, and intersex women?
@LilyLilyMaynard Are you claiming vandalism isn‚Äôt unlawful?
@LilyLilyMaynard I think the issue is unlawful vandalism targeting a protected class for the purpose of making their existamce in society more difficult... which is the ‚Äúhate‚Äù part of the unlawful act.

@AmazonEve Yup, as a whole, the 3rd way was always trans-inclusive. There's a reason so-called gender critical activists call themselves the 4th wave.

@AmazonEve *sigh* In other words, you don't know. 		Show me evidance that Dworkin knew that Raymond had contracted with the government.
@AmazonEve In what book did Andrea Dworkin say she had trans friends, say that exclusion was trans people's biggest issue, that trans medical care should be free, and that trans rights should be respected?
@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @JulieRei What do you mean "who decided this"? Why do you believe that community language is appointed by a person? 		Community groups by 1974 were using transgender in its modern context in both the UK and US. It organically spread from there. 		Nobody proclaimed anything.
@AmazonEve It's all there for you to see, but you seem to be attached to an ideology that compels you to pretend otherwise. I wish you'd look at the historical record instead of repeating talking points you've picked up on YouTube.
@PosiCoreLaurie @TerfBlocker Who are largely responsible for the prohibition of trans care in both public and private health insurance plans... and who are working with the right wing, right now, to promote bathroom bills. They even get to speak at the Heritage Foundation.
@AmazonEve Your assertion isn't supported by the historical record. 		3rd wave was always supportive and most 2nd wave was, too... though much less than 3rd wavers. The largest 2nd wave feminist grassroots events and orgs were trans-inclusive.
@WriteyFolks Yeah, they like to keep it that way.

The radical feminist collective Olivia paid for trans care and physically stopped TERFs from murdering Oliva member Sandy Stone because she was trans.

This disco-era gender logic was behind the pathologization of GNC kids in the DSM4.  		Now, GNC isn‚Äôt pathologized. Let kids be what they are.
@AmazonEve @_oatc_ @ErikaESoaring @TallShelley @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Yes, some feminists were anti-trans; a lot weren‚Äôt. 		A lot if 2nd wave feminism was rooted in existentialism and a lot of 3rd wave in skepticism of various modernist ideas.
@AmazonEve Zucker &amp; Green wanted GNC kids to be pathologized in the DSM4. 		DSM3 GID = GD kids	DSM4 GID = GNC + GD kids	DSM5 GD = GD kids		After the DSM5 came out, Zucker said ~70% of the kids he was ‚Äútreating‚Äù didn‚Äôt have DSM5 GD, but were GNC instead.
@AmazonEve For DSM4 GID (ie, kids who don't have GD, but r gender nonconforming + a small group of GD kids), the ‚Äúdesistance‚Äù is high (Zucker says most gender non-conforming kids r coerced into conforming, while almost all GD kids persist in having GD). Zucker says most DSM5 GD kids persist

@TallShelley @ErikaESoaring @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @stellahymmne @RevanAthame It's ahistorical to claim that TERFs didn't exist back then when TERFs attempted to murder Sandy Stone, while Olivia radfems stopped them.

@_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne Ah, no. I'm talking about Jeanne Cordova. Back then, she identified as "cross-gendered" which she later said equated to transgender. She later said she self-identified as a trans and butch.
@ErikaESoaring @TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Oh, Gloria totally jumped on that bandwagon. 		I mean, lots of feminist groups sent Raymond critiques of her book, the Oliva Collective included.
@AmazonEve @TallShelley @_oatc_ @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame What are you talking about? 		I stated the fact that Raymond's work was published in the Federal Register and Shelly sent me a quote about Gothic culture from Dworkin. Then you claim that me stating a fact about Raymond is POMO. 		Please explain your logic. https://t.co/erAL0tahQB
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Why are you attempting to change the subject?
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame TE wasn't "lauded by feminists." It wasn't a best seller and it was largely ignored by the major feminist groups at the time as pablum. 		However, it made a huge splash in TERF circles and gave them talking points for decades.
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame *Under male dominance		BTW, what does this quote have to do with the Federal Register? https://t.co/hRKm7nzPzy
@AmazonEve @TallShelley @RoryWalkerEsq @Boster_clack @wildlx @BristolAFed Raymond published in 1979. Dworkin published in 1974. These works are incompatible and represent polar opposites when it comes to trans support.
@AmazonEve @RoryWalkerEsq @Boster_clack @wildlx @BristolAFed Nothing she did, under the law at that time, was criminal. It was 100% legal to structurally create the machinery of our death and suffering and it lasted decades. 		The Trump admin is, right now, trying to help Raymond's cause.
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame The sentence before that describes what "violation" is in its modern (to the time of her book) context: "Literature, science, philosophy, pornography calls penetration violation." She's talking about the language Western culture uses to describe fucking.
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Do you believe that Dworkin was anti-trans? If so, please cite something from her copious writings or speeches that supports your claim.

@AmazonEve @_oatc_ @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame He was anti-trans, but it was Raymond's OHTA report that supported HCFA/NCD recommendations, published in the Federal Register in 1989, that led to the ban.. though Raymond's own NCHCT report had been publicly available since 1981.
@AmazonEve @RoryWalkerEsq @Boster_clack @wildlx @BristolAFed What are you talking about? Every question you raised about Raymond is addressed in this very long, very detailed, very thorough evidence-based post: https://t.co/0iZ8bILqK3		If you have a specific critique, please be specific about your critique.
@TallShelley @AmazonEve @RoryWalkerEsq @Boster_clack @wildlx @BristolAFed Dworkin never said, "all sex is rape." MacKinnon didn't say that either. 		Both were very much pro-trans. 		Again, there is ideology and then there's actual demonstrable history. I prefer demonstrable history.
@SineFourEx @AgnesW350 @LilyLilyMaynard There were two types of "GD" that existed under the DSM-IV: phenotype dysphoria and gender role dysphoria. Under the DSM-5, there is only phenotype dysphoria. 		We spent 20 years fighting against so-called "gender role dysphoria."
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Yup. ALL the information you need is here: https://t.co/0iZ8bILqK3
@TallShelley @_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame I prefer actual history to ideology. 		Yes, there were some TERFs doing what TERFs do. Raymond was one and she did a lot of damage attributable to government guidance written by her. It was her guidance, published in the Federal Register that did the damage, not all feminists.
@GIdentityWatch Did you ever get to the 9th Step, Cathey?
@_oatc_ @AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Yup. Also, public insurance covered trans care up until it was banned by Medicare, citing Raymond‚Äôs work.
@GIdentityWatch Yes, ad hominems can sometimes distract from the one‚Äôs lack of an evidence-based argument.
@AmazonEve @RoryWalkerEsq @Boster_clack @wildlx @BristolAFed The Lesbian Tide Collective in the mid-1970s. 		Your fact claim is that ‚Äúall‚Äù of feminism was anti-trans. That fact claim is demonstrably false.
@snerber Bodies and reproduction are material realities; what you think about those realities is gender.
@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne Nonsense. The "all of them" claim is demonstrably false.		Dworkin was pushing for trans inclusion &amp; healthcare in 1974. 		https://t.co/zcSlHDoI98

@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame You mean, private insurance quoting the OHTA report word-for-word in their exclusion policy doesn't prove a causal link?

@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Are you asking about where "TERF" came from? Or TERF/radfem history? Either way, this journal article might be helpful: https://t.co/usVRHOsn1z
@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Ish... By 1974, the inclusive "transgender" was popping up in trans materials in both America and the UK. By 1979 Christine Jorgensen was doing interviews telling reporters to call her transgender, not transsexual.
@AgnesW350 @LilyLilyMaynard There's a ton of evidence to support the claim that a lot of DSM-IV GID kids were autistic. We don't have evidence to make the same claim about DSM-5 GD kids.
@JunkMale101 @Womans_Place_UK @sussex_police That's awesome that you can claim that on Twitter, anonymous Twitter account.
@AmazonEve @ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Transgender existed as far back as 1965 and was used by doctors to refer to transsexual people. 		Pretending that sex essentialist radfems are just the same as radfems --who used their own bodies to protect trans women from sex essentialist radfems-- is ahistorical.

@ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame The Oliva Collective stopped TERFs from murdering Sandy Stone. The radical feminist Robin Tyler was beaten by TERFs for protecting a trans woman from TERFs who were trying to bash her. The largest Lesbian Feminist gathering ever voted twice to be trans inclusive.
@ErikaESoaring @stellahymmne @RevanAthame Eh, the history is more complicated than that. The pioneering radical feminist org The Lesbian Tide was led by a trans person and the Olivia Collective paid for trans medical care. The militant radfem group Cell 16 was very trans-inclusive.

@Lisa96060241 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard They've been publishing on this for 20+ years. Here's a Grooren paper from 1996. 		Also, here's a 2015 "long-term" follow-up paper from the journal Nature and a 2011 "longer-term" follow-up paper from the journal Pediatrics. https://t.co/ff1BzG0u3v
@Lisa96060241 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard "Longterm" as in life-long studies? No. "Longterm" as in decades? Yes, there are and none found any issues. But yes, we **do** want to see life-long studies done. Data is good!

@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard @ZUCKERKJ Please substantiate the ratio you cite with peer-reviewed research.
@CiriAntares @SchuylerTaylor4 @LilyLilyMaynard @ZUCKERKJ This has, thus far, been very true. More time and research is always a good thing.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard Hrm... I don't know who you are. There are several TA writers who tweet from this account. 		If you believe that Zucker himself hasn't publicly said --numerous times-- that his "therapy" consisted of enforcing gender roles and stereotypes, you're not dealing with facts.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard Actually, I know for a fact it *is* true. The hyperbole you're asserting comes straight from social media, not reality. 		I invite you to educate yourself about what actual affirmative therapy is: https://t.co/Bj73MgCuvY
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard @ZUCKERKJ Zucker himself said that a full 70% didn't have DSM-5 GD; instead, they had DSM-IV GID.  Under the DSM-IV, one only needed to be gender non-conforming to qualify for a DSM-IV GID diagnosis.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard If what you're advocating for is Zucker-style thereapy, you're advocating for gender role programming as therapy. You're supporting the pathologization of gender nonconformity.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard Actual afirmitive therapy and actual watchful waiting BOTH utilize the Dutch model: allow use of puberty blockers at Tanner Stage II and hormones between 16 - 18, depending on the country/jurisdiction.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard The only difirence between actual watchful waiting and actual afirmitive therapy is that kids are allowed to ****socially transition**** if there is a clinical need. Even watchful waiting allowed this in adolecents.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard *WE* stood against Zucker's bastardized "watchful waiting" BS because it was reparative therapy that pathologized gender nonconformity. YOU GUYS stood with Zucker, claiming that we stood against actual real watchful waiting.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @CiriAntares @LilyLilyMaynard Nonsense. What's happened is that your lot promoted the lie that what Zucker et al were doing was "watchful waiting." It wasn't. As soon as gender nonconformity was documented, Zucker et al tried to coerce kids into gender roles as "therapy."

@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal Having said that, nobody living within culture escapes gendered conditioning or creating a gendered social persona. Our laws generally require that we construct these personas. Nobody, in this culture, can space that fact.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal So, phenotype dysphoria is what transsexuals have. Anyone who claims they know why transsexuals experience this is lying; from brain to gender studies, the truth is that we don't know.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal For years, *we* ran a law policy conference back in the early 1990s that dealt with trying to depathologize gender nonconformity, make med/psych care accessible to those who actually needed it, &amp; dismantle gender role laws.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal It's one of the things that's so difficult about the gencrit vs trans narrative. Most of the things you guys talk about are the very things we were shouting about for decades... except we were just dumb trannies who didn't know what we were talking about.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal The American trans advocacy tradition was shaped by trans-identified folks like Leslie Feinberg and the radfem, Jeanne C√≥rdova and street queens. We always hated the pathologization of gender nonconformity.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal Green, Zucker, and the other gender-ghouls didn‚Äôt watch or wait. If they found gender non conformity, they tried to coerce kids into gender roles, stomping out gender nonconformity because they ran the DSM IV Workgroup.
@LilyLilyMaynard @SarahSpartacus @jessesingal Sure, I mean, just about any and every state and national trans group fought this fight. It‚Äôs why we hated Zucker‚Äôs promote-gender-roles-as-therapy ‚Äútherapy‚Äù. He called it ‚Äúwatchful waiting,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not what it was. We don‚Äôt have a problem with watchful waiting.
@SarahSpartacus @LilyLilyMaynard @jessesingal It was a protest of a GID institute. Trans activists have been doing protests at GID gender nonconformity pathologization conferences, institutes, and symposiums for decades. Weird that wherever you get your info from lied about that fact.

@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano If by "your part" you mean never making any falsifiable claim of bias regarding @ZackFord's (maybe trans activist/maybe not trans activist) critique of the Atlantic article, I would agree.
@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano And that would be applicable to me if I could, in any of your tweets to me, find even one example of you stating an explicit example of a factually biased claim made by Zack. 		Some anti-SJWs use #obfuscation to hide the fact that they have no explicit critique to make.
@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano I didn't see anything and it's possible that I missed the tweet. Since you're familiar with it, please link to the tweet wherein you name the specific factual bias claim in Zack's critique of the Atlantic article.
@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano Please point to the specif tweet wherein you state the explicit factual bias in @ZackFord's critique of the Atlantic piece.
@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano Actually, you never (at least in the tweets I saw) made any explicit critique. You talked about a veague unsubstantiated bias you asserted but never gave an explicit example of. 		Let's clear all this up: what factually biased claim did you take issue with?
@docamitay @ZackFord @ZUCKERKJ @jessesingal @JuliaSerano Are you referring to this tweet wherein you said that you were talking about trans activists and noted that you didn't know if Zack was one?

@BJontry @4th_WaveNow Pretending that children are being put on hormones won't make it so. Publishing propaganda claiming that GID = GD won't make it so. Pretending you're not pushing illegal "therapy" won't change the fact that the "therapy" you push is criminal.

@PollyLlwyn @notprotected_ Yup. It's like an anti-trans group looks at anti-gay activism from the 80s/90s and reenacted it all. Obviously, Trend wants to be today's NARTH.
Why not ask them why they lie about the DSM-5 Gender Dysphoria criteria, claiming --contrary to what they DSM explicitly states-- that after going to certain websites, kids can suddenly or rapidly come down with a case of Gender Dysphoria?		Why didn't you do *your* job, jurno?
Why not aske the hate group why they support reparitive therapy or why they tell teachers that kids can catch being transgender from @youtube and @twitter?

@LilyLilyMaynard @robjessel @Transgendertrd Lots of GID kids desist because GID was a mix of mostly gender nonconforming kids and gender dysphoric kids. Hell, even Zucker confirmed this. It‚Äôs why I advocated against GID for 20 yrs.		Why do you lie, pretending that GID &amp; GD are the same diagnostic populations?
@LilyLilyMaynard I know you‚Äôre 100% oblivious to it, but your rhetoric is exactly like the anti-gay reparative therapists of the 80s/90s, moaning about recruitment, unhealthy lifestyles, and ‚Äúshoving lifestyles down everyone‚Äôs throat.‚Äù		You sound just like a NARTH activist.
@robjessel @LilyLilyMaynard @Transgendertrd They're a group that promotes fake "science" to get trans kids into reparative therapy. They're functionally no different than other hate groups like NARTH.
@LilyLilyMaynard 1.) Show me the peer-reviewed *medical journal* paper that differentiates between "coming out" and ROGD.		2.) That's not medically ethical. Neither is reparative therapy you support. 		Your anti-trans movement isn't any different than the anti-gay movement of the 80s/90s.

@robjessel They are a hate group. They function just like the hate group NARTH did: they lie about the science and promote reparative therapy.
@robjessel Additionally, I would AGREE that many DSM-IV GID kids didn't have gender dysphoria. It's why trans advocates advocated against GID for 20 years. 		However, there's no evidence to support the claim that DSM-5 gender dysphoric kids don't have gender dysphoria.
@robjessel Your fact assertion is that with less anti-trans cultural oppression, FAAB access has increased **because** they are being pressured into it. 		Do you have peer-reviewed medical data to substantiate your claim?

@arwen_king @cwknews @SFPublicLibrary Not going to happen. Since I didn't transition my phenotype for the same reasons you modify your own body, I won't presume you have Gender Dysphoria.
@arwen_king @cwknews @SFPublicLibrary Yeah, it's not cool for cis people to project their complicated feelings about their gender identity onto trans people. https://t.co/6EYwCD1aHW https://t.co/Y2I2b4rfrb

@manwil83 @NoraCalder Um, no. That's not science. That's ideology. 		Phenotype = Body's primary and secondary sexed attributes. 		BTW, there are practically no 100% "natural" genotype-only-derived phenotypes in our society... up to and including your own phenotype.
@NoraCalder Yes, This is a phrase cis people like Dr. Benjamin used to describe the trans experience to other cis people in the 50s and 60s; trans people use this cis language as shorthand for "My phenotype doesn't match my gender orientation."
@Transgendertrd A.) gender isn't an emotion 	B.) sexism = gender stereotypes, hierarchies, &amp; roles	C.) sexism =/= gender orientation, identity, or expression
@FireWomon Except that trans people's biology is, in fact, changed through medical transition... unless you're prepared to claim that phenotype isn't an aspect of biology?
@Princess_Indigo @megjohnbarker @Channel4 If it were mere validation, I don't know that I'd have such an issue with it, as BS as that concept is. However, what they're "debating" are trans people's right to exist in public as equals to cis people.

@MsGoalieQueen Are you saying that someone hasn't transitioned in society? In other words, you're talking about someone who'd taken some spiro once, didn't transition, ID's as F (online) and then somehow hypothetically wants to compete in major sports, right?
@MsGoalieQueen Simple: If a sport is constructed as 2 sexed classes, (say, class A &amp; B), if a person hasn't transitioned to from class A to class B, then they've not transitioned from class A to class B.
@MsGoalieQueen No, certainly someone who's pre-transition shouldn't compete in a post-transition class; however, we've been here before with arbitrary sexing tests that inevitably assert that some women aren't women. This would pathologize ~14% of cis women: https://t.co/6gUiEVInw9

@ZJemptv You know the "ex" she's talking about in the thread about custody? That's the boy that was under her care and abused. She got pregnant from her abuse and the "ex," now an adult doesn't want his kid exposed to her brand of slime.
@MsGoalieQueen I think the issue is that it essentializes what a woman is supposed to be. Cis women who, through natural variance (or for other reasons), have a higher T level, are now going to have to medicate themselves to be considered women, or else compete as a man.

That @MumsnetTowers has to LIE in order to make their hate sound reasonable to readers reveals some truths about MN. I think MN advertisers should know that MN promotes lies and hate targeting trans people so advertisers can make informed choices about their #FreeSpeech.
Medical and surgical transition of ‚Äúyoung children‚Äù isn‚Äôt a thing. It‚Äôs a pernicious lie that bigots use to substantiate their hate. 		Think about it: @MumsnetTowers cited this lie to international press as the reason they support anti-trans hate on their site.
Since @MumsnetTowers, gets to concern troll over fake things like the medical transition of ‚Äúyoung children,‚Äù I demand, in the name of fair and ballanced reporting, that the @guardian print that we‚Äôre concerned that MN parents aren‚Äôt vaccinating children. https://t.co/38NGrmdusX

The cis/trans concept has been around for a very long time. It only gained cultural currancy reciently.
@_oatc_ Nah, do you not recall what happened to Dana and what became of her after they got through with her?
@Defend_Reality Yes, TERFs (in 2012) called TS Sepritists who worked with them their "lapdogs" because they could be trained to repeat their talking points as trans people.
@WakkaDakka3 @SoulTatt @Alina_Starkova_ Wait. What? Are you saying the real life test is a major risk?
@SoulTatt @WakkaDakka3 @Alina_Starkova_ Are you saying that if a non-transsexual transgender person meets another non-transsexual transgender person, they'll then think they're transsexuals and try to give themselves gender dysphoria by changing the phenotype they're happy with? https://t.co/sy8jOqazUO
@WitchBrain @seven_hex You're doing exactly what mums from mumsnet talked about doing. 		You guys are doing exactly what Brennan and Hungerford's crew did with TS Seps in 2011. I expect the same outcome. https://t.co/qgpMqtJ0iP
@seven_hex When that gencritter Kool-Aid starts looking good, google what became of Dana Taylor after becoming their TS Sep poster-girl.
@WakkaDakka3 @Rose_Of_Dawn Yes, yes, yes... TERFs are the reasonable ones who will tots support the cause of separating transsexuals from teh bad ol' transgender. 		Have you found your next Dana Taylor yet?
@seven_hex @WitchBrain Get ready for the TERF/gencritter love bombing. 		When I see you slinging TERF/gencritter BS a few months from now, I'll remind you of this conversation.
@WitchBrain @seven_hex Oh, look who came to recruit you: someone from the so-called "gender critical" movement. You know, what the TERF movement morphed into? 		Again, will you be as gullible as those who came before you? Please surprise me. https://t.co/t1Ti9p7uDF
@seven_hex No, the various iterations of the "separate transsexuals from the transgender umbrella" idea coalesce into a movement 1 - 2 times a decade, always with the same old arguments. Hope your iteration won't be as gullible as the ones who came before you. TERFs are poison.
@Alina_Starkova_ Isn't that the whole point of the so-called "real-life test"? Some people socially transition &amp; figure out that moving forward isn't right for them. There's nothing wrong with that. 		But yeah, transitioning one's phenotype w/out GD will lead to GD. Wouldn't wish that on anyone!
@seven_hex I honestly want to know if this incarnation of the Harry Benjamin Syndrome movement is a gullible as those who came before you.
@Rose_Of_Dawn Google "Harry Benjamin Syndrome" and "Transsexual Seperatists." What you think is new and diffrent isn't. It's just a lot of old nonsense that gets recycled once or twice a decade.
@Alina_Starkova_ I was with you right up until the "self-id" statement. This media trope is situated around the hypothetical wherein a dude will merely "self-id" as a girl to gain access to a girl‚Äôs bathrooms so that he can do bad things. This media meme has been used against #SOGI... https://t.co/ZoJ1hFJUe5
@seven_hex Okay, then you're mistaken. 		I asked if you guys were going to become the things TERFs called "lapdogs" back in 2012. Asking if you intended to become a TERF "lapdog" is not the same thing as saying that you are, right now, a  TERF "lapdog."
@Alina_Starkova_ Yeah, if you don't have GD, changing your phenotype might actually *cause* someone dysphoria. 		At the same time, I totally support those who don't fit a binary and present is whatever way want... especially if it fucks with sexist binary culture üòÑ
@seven_hex Paste into a reply where you were called a lapdog. 		TERFs used to call TS Seps their "lapdogs" for helping them back in 2012.
Ah, and here come the TERFs, doing what they've always done: try to recruit #TSRainCrew dupes to carry their water for them. Who'll be their new Dana Taylor, I wonder? Who will take the bate? https://t.co/yIWfSoK1Sp
While the #tsraincrew movement used to be built on the lie that Virginia Prince "coined" transgender, the post-mortem critique we made 6 years ago seems to remain the same: 		https://t.co/qcry2Jx7UA https://t.co/KKEjPeAZNz
Hey #tsraincrew, are you the next TERF "lapdogs"? Because, back in 2012, that's what TERFs used to call TS Separatists who would carry their water for them: "LAPDOGS." Mumsnet TERFs are already talking about how to use you best. What's that saying about history repeating itself?

@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Yeah, any large meta analysis will include various data quality. Do you know if the data was weighted on quality? If not, that would be an interesting analysis.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Is the 30% the one that looked at people who transitioned between 197*-198*? There were 2 groups, the dico era group did much worse than the 199*-200* group? That one?

@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher So, maybe you're so biased, you can't even consider an article that considers your issues if it also covers the other side. I just you'd claim that our recent podcast on the dangers of medical transition "biased" because we didn't condemn the notion of transition, eh?
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher If you view an article wherein we explicitly discuss the problem of badly trained hubris therapists and the harm they can do "bias" merely because we also discuss the conversion therapy drumbeat *is* the definition of bias. We considered both areas of concern.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Whelp, the thing is, your issue is directly addressed in this article. I think you're coming for the erroneous belief that these are issues we pretend don't exist, that we don't talk about it, and that we don't do analysis about it.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher I'm interested in your thoughts on where our concerns overlap; I think this would serve as both evidence of that overlap and a good place to begin a conversation without being adversarial.
Anyone have any events coming up in the next few months that you want up to promote on our podcast?
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Actually, this is an interesting point I and others who support the "affirming model" have highlighted. 		Give this a read and let's talk: https://t.co/AnA0OAlZFP		It kinda sounds like we care about a lot of the same things.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher A kid that‚Äôs just GNC doesn‚Äôt reach the diagnostic threshold for a DSM-5 GD dx.		Are you asking me what should happen to professionals who misdiagnose patients where those patients deal w/iatrogenic MH issues?
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher As I‚Äôve already said, you question defines the population as anyone who went to a gender clinic for non-defined reasons. 		The pop you want me to make fact claims about is a mixed pop of GD &amp; non-GD people. https://t.co/FnNnrBBXXE
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher For instance, here's your question. Just because a parent comes to a clinic worried about GNC in their kid doesn't mean that they'll be included in the GD Dx'd pop, correct? 		Let's define the pop in question, and then rationally consider the published data. https://t.co/CFn2x06R0q
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher You seem to want me to make fact claims about a diagnostic population that you've yet to define. I can't reasonably do that. 		Let's define the population parameters, look at the research, then talk about what is reasonable to assert as fact, based on the published data.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Great! Okay, I think we can all agree that various forms of trans identities are on the rise. Figuring out how much and how many of that group has a DSM-5 GD Dx is another really huge question. As a researcher yourself, how might you go about getting to that data?
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher If we want to know we're talking about a DSM-5 GD diagnostic pop, it just seems that we would want to look at the research, pops, and various data that is limited to a DSM-5 GD diagnostic pop, instead of other various pops.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Thanks for the prompt. Since you want to use 10 yrs as your metric, we'll 1st need to explain how we remove 5 yrs of mixed data since GID *is* a mixed group of GD and GNC kids. 		Could I persuade you into sticking with only DSM-5 GD research instead of mixing GID &amp; GD data?
@NetiNeti61 @fedupfemme Made what up?
@reckoner80 If you were DX'd under the DSM-IV, you were probably in a horrible position. The DSM-IV GID is toxic and harmed tons of people. Anyone/any parent who expressed concern that their kid was gender nonconforming could get a GID DX and then get "treatments" for it. üò°
@reckoner80 Oh, don't get me wrong. 		I don't like everything about the law, either. I'm just saying that **if** that's the reality, then that's the reality, and I have to exist within reality. 		Personally, I support a DSM5 DX, providers following SoC, &amp; knowledgeable ethical therapists.
@EsterforSanity @reckoner80 Reductionist essentialism. I've not come across this argument before üôÑ		Also, I agree. "woman" isn't a feeling. Women are a class that's defined by their material condition within culture.
@reckoner80 It entirely depends. 		A) Is it legal? 	B) Can the person give legal consent? 	C) Is this someone transferring docs after spending years with another doc? Do they have a DX of GD? What's their situation? 		*I always support having a good therapist involved w/transition.
@reckoner80 Let me highlight the part you seem to be missing. I'm saying that **if** this is their legal right, it's their legal right. 		I'm also saying that if this is their right, pretending that it isn't A) won't help &amp; B) seeks to take away a right they have under the law. https://t.co/LExwDxiNPE
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher The DSM4 GD definition is pretty terrible and will harm A LOT of people if applied to modern medical treatment. Those who do use that definition are, IMHO, unethical those with cause should file against them. https://t.co/y9qSsKDJwW
@reckoner80 Post into a reply where I said, "activists agreeing that it's ok give a 20 year old female testosterone after one visit to a Dr."
@reckoner80 I'm saying that if someone is an adult and can give consent for what happens to their body under the law, they have that right. I don't agree with infantilizing adults about what they legally choose to do with their own body. That means I'm pro-abortion "on demand," too.
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher You're demanding we have a discussion about a term you don't seem to want to define. If you're not referring to the DSM-5 GD diagnostic criteria, then just clearly state exactly what YOU mean when YOU use GD in ROGD. https://t.co/2d0HYyJspR
@reckoner80 I mean, if you're an adult and are able to give consent, I don't have a problem with docs giving hormones. I support body autonomy. 		Are you talking about children getting hormones after 1 visit?
@reckoner80 It means that there has been enough time for the doc to go through the Misconduct process and suits to be filed. That's why I asked if you knew of any source for the results of the investigation.
@JulieRei @docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @Susan_Larson_TN @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Twitter claims won't get him to where he says he wants to be.
@JulieRei @docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @Susan_Larson_TN @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher I really wish that --if the doc had evidence to reasonably assign a direct causal status to the various sources he asserts to be causal conditions-- would publish his findings so researchers can see the evidence and add to it and/or critique it.
@reckoner80 Is this the Russell Reid you're talking about? https://t.co/GW7oZiv74C
@reckoner80 Thanks for this. That happened 5 years ago. Do you have an official UK source for the results of the investigation?
@docamitay @OliviaMaynard13 @JulieRei @AliciaMHendley @transegghatcher Excellent! Thank you! 		Are you saying you're referring to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Gender Dysphoria when you write GD in ROGD?

@Muttmere1 @Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ @LilyLilyMaynard @Genethique_EN @GenomeBiology You're the one who keeps citing religious organizations to substantiate your fearmongering over trans kids, not me.
@Bioethicsnews @Muttmere1 @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ Even your Pope said Hell isn't real, though the business side of the church rushed to say otherwise. Fear is the biggest business of them all and y'all are the original OG, no? I mean, your site is nothing more than concern trolling.		https://t.co/vgUTGtCtDv
@Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @Muttmere1 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ @LilyLilyMaynard @Genethique_EN @GenomeBiology And yet you pretend to offer rational and reasoned analysis about trans issues and abortion, eh?
@Bioethicsnews @Muttmere1 @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ So, you're merely concerned and not at all a religious front at all? 		Thanks for clearing that up! https://t.co/kB418mf5ef
@Muttmere1 @Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ @LilyLilyMaynard @Genethique_EN @GenomeBiology If you directed that at the religious institute that won't talk about its child rape problem, I totally agree with you, @Muttmere1. 		If you're directing your concern at us, I encourage you to take some time away from twitter and think about the bedfellows you promote. https://t.co/BrfP3VDxri
@Bioethicsnews @Muttmere1 @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ I looked through your ethics articles and found a lot of stuff on the "ethics" of trans people, but nothing about your ethical stance on priest rape or pedophilia. Interesting. 		So, according to your "ethics":		Trans: ethical problem 	Church rape: https://t.co/QfF21cb5cp
@Bioethicsnews @Muttmere1 @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ Let me guess, you don't want to talk about your beliefs anymore, amirite? Because, when it comes down to it, your "Institute" is just an opinion platform for whatever your Church claims as biologically "ethical," eh? https://t.co/NuXmA5PTnW
@Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @Muttmere1 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ @LilyLilyMaynard @Genethique_EN @GenomeBiology Oh. tell me about the biology of transubstantiation.
@Bioethicsnews @Muttmere1 @butterflygone02 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ You're a Catholic opinion blog pretending to offer something other than Church dogma. 		Tell me, as a "biological" site, what is your opinion on the reality of hell? üßê https://t.co/DFb1ixb8QT
@Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @Muttmere1 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ @LilyLilyMaynard @Genethique_EN @GenomeBiology Nah, you're tots not a Catholic opinion institute.  üôÑ https://t.co/MGmLmh3pxF
@Bioethicsnews @butterflygone02 @Muttmere1 @NCBCenter @GenderCritical_ Wow. A religious site has an opinion. No religious site has ever had opinions about trans issues! How ever did you find one?!? üò±
