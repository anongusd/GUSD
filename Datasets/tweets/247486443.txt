4/ House Democrats will vote this morning to fund @Interior and end this shutdown. Republicans should stop making #nationalparks like @JoshuaTreeNPS suffer for the sake of the president's ego.
3/ The Trump approach now, which many Republicans are still supporting, is to demand the wall and close their eyes to the damage the #TrumpShutdown is causing. Moving money around to try to paper over the destruction a day or two at a time is not a real strategy.
2/ House Democrats have said all along that the way to protect #publiclands during the shutdown is to close them until normal operations, and normal staffing levels, are restored. This was the Obama approach during the failed Republican shutdown over the Affordable Care Act.

9/ "The sooner [young, diverse Americans] become part of that loyal constituency like they are, that‚Äôs our protection for these lands and waters. And that requires diversity, period."		Read the full piece for more thoughts on #publiclands, #nationalparks and #NoBorderWall.
8/ He tells environmental groups the only way to succeed is to keep America‚Äôs diversity in mind, looking at how their issues connect with people of color.		‚ÄúThe constituency for the things you care about is a different constituency. It‚Äôs diverse. It‚Äôs urban. It‚Äôs younger."
7/ That idea is now part of the environmental mainstream but when Grijalva arrived in Congress in 2003, his interest in conservation policy was met with skepticism from environmental groups who didn‚Äôt understand why a Latino congressman would care.
6/ Grijalva organized public hearings to elevate the drinking water problem, which showed him certain communities could be more susceptible than others to becoming victims of pollution as a result of systemic racial inequality.
5/ Grijalva first saw ties btwn environmental issues and racial justice in a 1990s battle over #Tucson #AZ drinking water contamination. TCE, used to clean airplane engines, leached into groundwater and reached some city aquifers, tainting water for communities largely of color.
4/ ‚ÄúCongressman Grijalva is without a doubt one of conservation‚Äôs biggest champions on Capitol Hill,‚Äù said Alex Taurel, conservation program director for @LCVoters.	 	‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an authentically progressive American who doesn't in any way imbibe Beltway values." - @RepRaskin
3/ He also expects to hold hearings on the environmental complications of President Donald Trump‚Äôs proposed border wall and has staked out a big policy fight by vowing to try to reauthorize the nation‚Äôs fishery laws, where #climatechange impacts will be an issue.
2/ The 70-year-old son of a Mexican immigrant, Grijalva is the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. With it comes a platform to focus public attention, and legislation, on public lands and environmental issues with a progressive bent and a consideration of racial justice.
