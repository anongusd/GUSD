This morning, I was honored to receive the Family Research Council’s True Blue Award for scoring 100% on their 2018 vote scorecard. In Congress, I will always support policies that strengthen American families and protect the unborn. #ProLife @FRCAction @FRCdc https://t.co/afGUEDcjdx
I believe our Founding Fathers knew what they were doing when they included the Second Amendment in our Constitution, &amp; I will continue to fight against Democrats’ efforts to weaken it. I’ve said it before, &amp; I’ll say it again: I value our #2A right, &amp; I will always protect it.
I just voted against H.R. 8 because, as a gun owner, I believe in the importance of our constitutional right to keep &amp; bear arms. This lazy piece of legislation would not protect Americans from gun violence – it just creates more hoops for law-abiding citizens to jump through. https://t.co/B8K8OdKRki

For the 1st time in a decade, the U.S. is the world's most competitive economy. Our unified Republican govt's pro-growth policies are working. The American people are better off today than we were 2 yrs ago. Looking forward to seeing the momentum continue. https://t.co/ehHHB1bnEB
The November general election is quickly approaching, and Team Roby isn't taking a single vote for granted. I will continue to run on my record as a proven conservative who puts Alabama first. Join us: https://t.co/HMwfxyrGqn
I also assured the group that as the Republican nominee for AL-02, I remain focused on our shared conservative priorities: supporting our military, caring for our veterans, implementing smart agriculture policy for our farmers, securing the border, &amp; defending the unborn.
Last night, I had the opportunity to speak to the Dale County GOP. I shared some of the successes our unified conservative govt has accomplished over the last 2 years, including properly funding our nation's military &amp; unleashing our economy through historic tax reform overhaul. https://t.co/RJIVIE906e
The House responded by passing H. Res. 1071 recognizing that "allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote... diminishes the voting power of US citizens." I was proud to support the measure. The right to vote should be reserved for American citizens. https://t.co/qKMt11EWQu
San Francisco &amp; several other Democrat-led cities around the country have put forward resolutions that would allow all non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in elections. I don't know about you, but I firmly oppose this idea.
I'm honored to have the endorsement of the Alabama Realtors in my campaign for reelection in AL02! I'll continue to fight for policy that supports the real estate business. I'm eager to see this industry grow &amp; flourish in our state. More via @ALDailyNews: https://t.co/QokuboBUqE
It's clear that Americans are working &amp; prospering, &amp; small businesses are thriving. Thanks to our conservative, pro-growth policies, our economy is booming. I'll keep fighting for hardworking Alabamians &amp; our AL-02 job creators. Looking forward to seeing this momentum continue!
This week, the National Federation of Independent Business (@NFIB) released its Small Business Optimism Index from the month of August, &amp; it showed a new record high in the survey's 45-year history. https://t.co/mgTf5kBX1n
It's been 17 years. Let us #NeverForget the lives lost on September 11, 2001, whether at the hand of terrorism or by heroic sacrifice defending this great nation. Even in the darkest of times, in the midst of unspeakable tragedy, America will always rise above. https://t.co/EaP8aRj4AN
Judge Kavanaugh is an excellent choice for the Supreme Court. He is a qualified, conservative jurist who I believe will serve the American people with dignity. I'm glad the Senate has begun the confirmation process, and I hope we will see him confirmed soon. #ConfirmKavanaugh
Americans are confident in our economy, &amp; rightfully so. I am eager to continue working alongside my colleagues in Congress &amp; the Trump Administration to make life better for Alabamians. #TaxReformWorks
Great news! A study found that families across AL will save $1.28 billion on electricity over 5 yrs as a result of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. The report also states that AL's economy will add thousands of jobs &amp; see $1.34 billion more in economic activity. https://t.co/b9are15srV
If “human rights” are really the concern here, my question is: “What about the right to life of the unborn child?” As a #ProLife woman, I will always stand up for this right – at every stage.
It is appalling to me that anyone would attempt to assign a monetary value to human life. Abortion is not an economic issue, and it should never be watered down and treated as such. https://t.co/naiXrNGtwV
For more than 200 yrs, our country has been a land of optimism &amp; opportunity. Over the last year &amp; a half, we’ve worked to foster this outlook again. I look forward to seeing this nation continue to prosper. I'll always support commonsense policies that strengthen America first.
As I told @yhn, I disagree w/ NY Gov. Cuomo's comments from yesterday. We live in the greatest country in the world. Many brave men and women have served and sacrificed for the very freedoms we enjoy as Americans. https://t.co/3SQebYhm8S
I'm glad this issue has been resolved for now, but we must continue working to enhance security at our southern border. I will always support commonsense measures to crack down on our illegal immigration problem. Read the response to our letter here: https://t.co/5KKAUfRPfu
I recently joined @RepByrne in sending a letter to Sec. Mattis &amp; Sec. Nielson to oppose the housing of 10,000 illegal immigrants at Navy airfields in Baldwin County. I'm pleased we've received word that this action will not be taken. https://t.co/h3xYjcPLjn

It has been a privilege to be a part of the conservative momentum &amp; to work alongside my colleagues in Congress &amp; the Trump Admin. to push some very important priorities over the finish line. We're in a unique position to accomplish even more, &amp; I’m eager to continue the fight.
I’m honored &amp; humbled that the people of AL-02 have again placed their trust &amp; confidence in me, &amp; that I will have the opportunity to continue to do this job on their behalf. Thank you to each person who went out to the polls today to support me. https://t.co/hOfL6MxAGY

What an awesome day! Yesterday I hosted House Ag Committee Chairman Conaway for visits w/ producers &amp; local leaders in Pike, Coffee, Houston, &amp; Geneva Counties. We had productive discussions about efforts in Congress to send the farm bill to the President. https://t.co/BQYErTBc4e
I am thankful for Ag Chairman Conaway’s time, &amp; it was great to be among friends &amp; supporters as we talked about next steps for the farm bill. Rest assured I will remain actively engaged to ensure that AL-02 farmers are treated fairly as we work to send a bill to the President.

I was proud to vote in favor of the NDAA because I know how critical it is that Congress provide our military with every tool they need to do their jobs and keep our country safe. I will always work to ensure that our military is properly funded.
In the spirit of Memorial Day, this week the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This important bill authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and the many critical military programs on which our men and women in uniform rely.
The Constitution makes it clear: The right of the people to keep &amp; bear arms shall not be infringed. As a gun owner, I've always defended 2A when liberals have attempted to undermine it.

You may have seen my recent assurances that Congress provided no money for abortion in the recent government funding package. That remains true, and this action by the President further ensures that Planned Parenthood isn’t able to receive these dollars through Title X grants.
This "family planning" loophole has allowed Planned Parenthood to receive millions of taxpayer dollars over the years, and it must be stopped. Let me be clear: Abortion is NOT family planning.
This is a MAJOR win for the pro-life movement! The Trump Administration has announced they will propose a "Protect Life" rule to prevent Title X federal "family planning" dollars from being steered to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/IUDYdnvNL1
The House is scheduled to consider the new farm bill tomorrow, and I'm proud that it provides important support to AL-02 farmers like Jonathan. In Congress, I will always fight for smart agriculture policy on behalf of the hardworking farmers throughout our district. https://t.co/0pvnW7iJM8
This week the House is scheduled to consider the new #FarmBill to address the challenges our farmers face each day. I'm eager to see this important legislation over the finish line. I remain committed to making sure the government works for our farmers and not against them.
Agriculture is the largest employer in AL-02, and I'm proud to be a strong voice for farmers and to represent their concerns in Congress. I know how important it is that we get farm policy right on their behalf. https://t.co/gL1c3gLVV2
I will always work to ensure that our men and women who wear the uniform have the support they need when we send them into harm's way, and I will never stop fighting for proper treatment for our nation's veterans. Happy Military Appreciation Month!
It's Military Appreciation Month! I am proud to serve AL-02 that is home to two of our nation’s finest military installations, thousands of active duty and reserve personnel, and more than 16,000 military retirees. https://t.co/VsltFWgKsD
I said from the very beginning this was a bad deal that doesn't put America first. Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism, and we must take their efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon very, very seriously in future negotiations. https://t.co/bYyMtajiLQ
This is a BIG deal: Yesterday President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Agreement.
I want every veteran in AL-02 to know that ensuring proper care for our veterans remains at the top of my priority list. You have sacrificed so much to protect our great nation. The very least we can do is ensure that you always have the very best care here at home. https://t.co/VdXMezH0nm
ICYMI: This week I was proud to receive @NRA's endorsement. I appreciate having their strong support in my campaign for reelection in AL-02, &amp; I will continue to work alongside them to defend Americans' constitutional right to keep and bear arms. RT if you support #2A! https://t.co/VQUqxW3hiN

I have consistently advocated against dangerous sanctuary laws because they violate our nation's existing immigration laws &amp; put Americans at risk.

As I've said many times, my top priority for our tax overhaul is that the people of AL02 benefit. Under our plan, the average, median-income family of four in Alabama will receive about $2,100 - not just once, but annually. This is great news for the people I represent. https://t.co/xFAfQCIwZ9

This #TaxDay marks the end of a very complicated era. This is the LAST time hardworking Americans have to file their taxes using our old, outdated, and unnecessarily complex code. Our historic tax overhaul makes filing simple while nearly doubling the standard deduction. https://t.co/CptkuM8spS
I am honored to have received the Award for Conservative Achievement from the American Conservative Union Foundation. I've been proud to have the opportunity in Congress to vote on legislation that upholds the conservative principles that are important to the people of AL-02. https://t.co/5G5Pmrepfn
Our Constitution states that our right to keep &amp; bear arms must not be infringed, yet liberals try to chip away at that right. I'm proud to have an “A” rating from the @NRA for my stance on legislation that protects our freedom. I'll never stand down in the fight to defend #2A. https://t.co/PQbLzfGb3g

I'm so honored to announce that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Fed PAC has endorsed my campaign for reelection in AL02! I am proud to work alongside NFIB to advance policies that strengthen small businesses - not hurt them. https://t.co/FJj3dpSxpF

Agriculture is the largest employer in #AL02, and I know how important it is for our farmers to have someone willing to fight on their behalf in Washington as they continue to provide food &amp; fiber for the world.

Tax reform is working. Hardworking men &amp; women all over AL are benefiting as a result. We're just a couple of months in, &amp; already more than 4.7 million employees across the country have received bonuses. Eager to see where we we are in a few more months! https://t.co/paqPs1rpc4
Today I spoke to the Capitol City Republican Women. We discussed the exciting things our unified Republican govt accomplished in 2017, &amp; I shared my priorities for 2018, including rebuilding our nation's infrastructure &amp; crafting a farm bill that treats AL commodities fairly. https://t.co/iClm3IZrvC
I recently joined @EWTN to talk about my views on life and other policy proposals I've fought for in the House to protect life at all stages --&gt; https://t.co/n2b9wcDn6R
Thousands of Americans have joined together in DC today for the largest annual pro-life event in the world, the @March_for_Life. I'm always so inspired by how many people, including some from AL, come to this event in order to speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves.
Nancy Pelosi called tax reform "the end of the world" &amp; "Armageddon." More money for hardworking Americans sure doesn't seem like the end of the world to me. Since President Trump signed our #TaxCutsandJobsAct into law, many employers have raised wages or given bonuses.
From my family to yours, Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year! I hope you have a wonderful holiday season. https://t.co/aM9RNtsUQd
Yesterday was a historic day! For the first time since 1986, we overhauled our tax code to let families &amp; businesses keep more of their money. Americans have been waiting for this. I'm so glad that we could make tax reform a reality in the 1st year of our unified Republican govt. https://t.co/P5ECRn64ha
