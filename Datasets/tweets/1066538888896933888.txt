@baddestpaki They‚Äôre releasing this many pics. They‚Äôre looking for attention. Divorce in making.
@realDonaldTrump How are you making strides in clean water in the US when you ignore climate change facts from scientists?
Why haven‚Äôt young celebrities learned that marrying or being engaged after only weeks or short months of knowing each other are a disaster waiting? What are they 1940‚Äôs retro?
@rachelbogle Not sure about that. I do think this marriage after such a short engagement and differences between the 2 and I‚Äôm not talking age is a divorce waiting to happen. They have a better chance than Harry &amp; Meghan which is not looking good right now.
@realDonaldTrump So funny. Laura Bush has so much class and no respect for Trump. Trying to get on her good side? Won‚Äôt work!
@davidaxelrod @shellywisn @ScottWalker This is such a disgusting use of power. He‚Äôs mad because his own law disqualified the recount of the election results.
