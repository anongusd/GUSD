"VEGAN MEATS" are absolutely intertwined with the Monsanto "PATENT ALL THE FOODS" crusade. 		and yes, it is a crusade, because theyre out to destroy all indigenous foods on their wake 		so go learn about what actual food liberation looks like. it is isn't about fake meats
STILL HAVE MY VEGAN COOK BOOKS FROM 40 YRS AGO		if y'all can get your hands on the original UPRISINGS book for bakers and the original MOOSEWOODS, do yourselves a favor and read them, top to bottom		vegetarianism &amp; veganism were about FOOD LIBERATION, not another capitalist rent
NO. 		it is a recolonization of food. 		veganism is rooted in the DECOLONIZATION movements of the last century. 		"VEGAN MEAT" is a cooptation &amp; recolonization of the movement. 		go learn yourself some history. https://t.co/9nH5owzatw
ACTUALLY, 	TAKE A MOMENT TO LISTEN		indigenous vegan cuisines NEVER mimic animal based recipes		veganism is today a reactionary movement. wasn't 40 years ago; as part of the DECOLONIZATION mvts		"VEGAN MEAT" is a cooptation the decolonization ethos of veganism		know your history https://t.co/yHh1DZyzAK
