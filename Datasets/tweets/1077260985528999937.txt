@KyleClark Someone took a minute from attending @CPAC to tweet this. 		That's commitment.
#SchoolShooting anniversaries are a growing reminder that many #prolife advocates care about saving children's lives only up until those lives are abruptly ended by a gun. 	#Parkland 	#SandyHook 	#columbine

@UnfollowTrump Um...	You decided not to yet. Yesterday.
@realDonaldTrump Is that an anonymous source?		Oh, it is.		Based on your criteria, wouldn't that make this #fakenews?
@realDonaldTrump Is this like when customs flags passports of people with Hispanic names who live near the border? Because they must be illegal due to proximity?		Because prayer rugs are used everywhere. 		SERIOUSLY.
@SteveKingIA Freedom of speech does not equate to freedom from consequences. 		#HTH
If Jesus had been "Israel First,"we'd hardly be going to our respective places of worship this morning. 		But he wasn't. 		He was for all of humanity. To love them and save them, and we're commanded to do the same. 		Things to think about as you head to church today.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, they're in Puerto Rico, part of the United States, to support the rebuilding effort. 		Since you keep bringing up the term "humanitarian."

@realDonaldTrump You may want to speak to your son, then. 		He seems to think there's no "human" in your brand-new humanitarian crisis branding of border wall funding.

Sunday: "Thank you, Jesus, for your saving grace that redeems all humans! Help me every day to love as you do!"		Monday: "Keep those animals who can't speak English out of my country. Who do they think they are, trying to take opportunities from my precious family?"
Me thinks @DonaldJTrumpJr didn't get the memo from the #GOP about adding "humanitarian" to border wall messaging.
How refreshing it would be if people who make saving the unborn their top issue would spend as much energy on all of the other issues that work against that baby once it's born.
@JacobAWohl That's fucking stupid.
@chas2117 @brithume @NBCNews Lots of things and people are ignorant these days.	There have been more recent reports indicating the visit was in the works prior to this week. 	And yet the fact remains POTUS did not visit active troops last holiday. 	Glad he changed that.
@KimLamoreaux1 @swtlor1946 @realDonaldTrump No worries. And agreed... my head tilts at precarious angles almost nonstop. üòë
@brithume But not by the time the original article on @NBCNews was posted.
#ThingsImNotApologizingFor		Caring about fellow human beings enough to where I'll call out fellow human beings for not walking their talk or, y'know, acting humane.

@JaneVarian1 @realDonaldTrump Wall?	Fence?	Ok.
@KimLamoreaux1 @swtlor1946 @realDonaldTrump I was asking her to declare where, since she reverts to cries of "fake news" to assert her support for Trump, she gets her information that he works 24/7 for the American people. 	I have some guesses. 	I support journalists, journalism, and the 1st amendment.
@KimLamoreaux1 @swtlor1946 @realDonaldTrump My reply was directed to @swtlor1946, apologies for confusion. 	She seems convinced I'm under the influence of fake news.
@swtlor1946 @KimLamoreaux1 @realDonaldTrump What is your source of information?	Out of curiosity. Since you mentioned ignorance.
@realDonaldTrump I swear every time you randomly capitalize completely normal words, like Wall, I imagine them as fictional entities. 	For instance, Wall is a town in the movie #Stardust that sits on the border of normal Earth and magical Earth. 	(see above for appropriate capitalization) https://t.co/aGpo1ChMu1
@GOPChairwoman @JohnCornyn Or they're more interested in a cheaper and effective way to secure the border in this, the 21st century. 	#wildguess
