@PeterSullivan4 Is he including a public option in his ACA bills?
Although Medicare negotiation is a much-needed reform, by itself it is not a solution for most Americans. Voters sent this Congress to Washington to lower prescription drug prices for all Americans.
@ItMustBeJim Yes, that is inherent to single payer.
@DeanBaker13 Absolutely!
- Include a state maintenance-of-effort	- Deficit finance $2 trillion off the top	- Employer tax of ~8%	- A Warren wealth tax (or equivalent)	- Securities tax of .02%	- A higher rate for the top 1%
A Twitter challenge for math wonks out there: To finance single payer, how low can the income/payroll tax rate be set for most people? You can design your own package, but I'll suggest one. 1/ @ernietedeschi @jodilliu @paulkrugman @DeanBaker13

@jamesdoleman @JohnDiesattheEn @dylanmatt @jodilliu Where did I say that?
This is a very important question. If any plan sets the employer tax below the current average employer spending of 8% of payroll, then employers will get a windfall. https://t.co/eZRrloqGKL

@dylanmatt @jodilliu @Chrissyeibner But perception is important. If we're going to have any modeling/analysis before a CBO score right before a vote, which could be a total disaster, it's gotta be RAND. Even Urban Institute is viewed as biased.

@EdwinCPark @amitabhchandra2 Same thing
@amitabhchandra2 What I mean is Medicaid can get steep discounts even though it covers everything. Because it has a hammer - the threat of noncoverage of all of a manufacturer's drugs. (Which to my knowledge has never been invoked.)
@amitabhchandra2 True but I think value-based pricing would incorporate that value.
@amitabhchandra2 I think you're wrong on the last point. Medicaid uses a hammer without a formulary. And I think you need to distinguish between arbitrary, across the board price setting vs. value-based pricing. Economically unviable = little innovation.
@ForecasterEnten That's a bit incomplete in my view. Harris could win South Carolina and California going into Super Tuesday southern states. A better way to look at it is Sanders *needs* to win Iowa and NH.
@cynthiaccox @CitizenCohn No over 10. You are thinking of single payer.
