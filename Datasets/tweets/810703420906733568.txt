This shouldn‚Äôt have to be a partisan issue. As humans were destroying the world and have been for hundreds of years. Instead of continuing the mess we have to start curbing our destruction and work back to fix our mistakes. Yeah we fucked up but it‚Äôs not to late to change
This planet is being destroyed. You don‚Äôt have to believe in global warming or climate science to acknowledge that destroying habits, dumping harmful chemicals into bodies of water and polluting trash into our environments isn‚Äôt good for this planet and the lives of others
I think it‚Äôs funny when people get mad about not being able to use plastic straws at restaurants or plastic bags at stores. We can live life without them and instead of complaining about efforts to make the world greener and safer, we should actively try to do more
