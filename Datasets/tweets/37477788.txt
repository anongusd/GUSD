RT @MoForMAGA: Competitive Coexistence: An American Concept for Managing U.S.-China Relations By @AndrewSErickson 		https://t.co/DwcsJvu2DS
Describing the United States &amp; China as strategic stakeholders that should pursue #CompetitiveCoexistence realistically is a good place to start.		Read my complete recommendations for US officials from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump on down here @TheNatlInterest:	https://t.co/pR6oxU0S8j
#BottomLine: 		China won‚Äôt do America‚Äôs homework.		The US must safeguard its own interests throughout the course of US-China relations.		Rather than let Beijing dictate terms in bilateral interactions, Washington should proactively &amp; consistently promote its own ideas &amp; phrasing.
Using America‚Äôs Own Words		Circumventing pitfalls is not enough. 		US must assertively articulate American concepts &amp; policies. This will help to avoid having Chinese interlocutors driving interactions &amp; policy conversations in a direction that could undermine American interests.
3 Loaded PRC #PoisonPill concepts that US must avoid:		1) The #ThucydidesTrap	2) New-Type Great-Power Relations	3) Community of Common Destiny		Tracking slogans as they emerge &amp; evolve can help US officials anticipate freighted phrasing &amp; avoid further traps as Beijing sets them.
Implementing the Principles: Avoiding PRC Formulations		#WordsMatter &amp; ceding the conceptual initiative = weakness. US must not appear to acquiesce to‚Äîor, worse yet, embrace‚Äî#Party-dictated wording that makes US appear to fear tension or be willing to yield to #China to avoid it.
9) Cooperation Requires Reciprocity		To the extent that China proves willing, US will cooperate to reduce tension, pursue shared interests &amp; mutually good outcomes.		But it takes two to tango! US won't court China as "#ArdentSuitor," yield unilaterally or give disproportionately.
8) Opposing Misbehavior, Not China Overall		The US seeks not to suppress China wholesale, but to #oppose its #harmful #behaviors.	 	The US does not seek to replicate the Cold War by attempting to ‚Äú#contain‚Äù (#comprehensively #suppress) China the way it did with the Soviet Union.
7) Not a Zero-Sum Game		#CompetitiveCoexistence both rejects ready agreement on disputed issues (unrealistic) &amp; an #inevitable drift to #war (similarly unlikely given overwhelming costs &amp; considerable shared interests).		Interaction +overlapping interests different from #ColdWar.
6) Using Friction to Counter Harmful PRC Actions		In #Leninist fashion, Beijing pushes forward when its relentless probing fails to meet resistance. 		But when the US does #resist, #China often chooses not to escalate.		This demonstrates the limits of Beijing‚Äôs appetite for risk.
5) Accepting Risk		To pursue an effective competitive strategy of its own, the US must accept more risk.		It should make clear that it, too, is comfortable with a degree of friction &amp; tension.	 	China tests the US continuously, probing for weakness &amp; opportunity. Must pass tests!
4) Holding Ground in Contested Areas		The US will stand its ground &amp; thwart PRC dominance in contested areas where they have conflicting vital interests &amp; overlapping presence. 		The US will uphold its interests even when #China‚Äôs efforts impinge upon them &amp; generate #friction.
3. Safeguarding US Interests		US will proactively pursue its interests &amp; continue to uphold its vital interests &amp; those of its allies &amp; partners. 	These include maintaining the rules-based international order, in which disputes must be resolved peacefully under international law.
2) Embracing Competition		The US will neither shrink from competition nor pretend that it doesn't exist. The US &amp; its allies no longer tolerate inconsistent #HappyTalk or unfair arrangements.		#MattPottinger shows how to clearly &amp; candidly voice concerns:		https://t.co/MovDhuDssF
Principles for #CompetitiveCoexistence		1) Competition is Inevitable		Conflicting political systems, values &amp; interests make US-China distrust &amp; competition unavoidable for the foreseeable future. Both nations must learn to live with it for the long term.		https://t.co/pR6oxU0S8j
1) Don‚Äôt suppress China wholesale, oppose its harmful behaviors.	2) Accept risk/friction to recalibrate PRC actions threatening US interests.	3) Hold ground in contested areas to thwart PRC dominance.	4) Reduce tensions &amp; pursue shared interests as much as PRC's willing to do so.
I propose a new American vision for US-#China relations: the pursuit of #CompetitiveCoexistence. 		Based on the advice I've provided to key US government principals over the past several years, this paradigm contains 4 pillars.		Read more @TheNatlInterest:	https://t.co/pR6oxU0S8j

A #bipartisan Congressional-Executive Branch consensus is emerging that the US must pursue a markedly different approach to #China.		Describing the US &amp; China as #StrategicStakeholders that should pursue #CompetitiveCoexistence is a good place to start.		https://t.co/pR6oxU0S8j

As a PRC State Media Bureau Chief, @chenweihua, you're tasked w/ supporting PRC positions on #Huawei, etc. What more &amp; more people find ironic &amp; troubling is that you &amp;your colleagues use @Twitter to do so, even though many in PRC can't use. Hence their &amp; @georgesoros's concerns.

#POLICY IMPLICATIONS		1) To #counter #China‚Äôs expanding #maritime presence, the U.S. should carefully cultivate its global network of #alliances and #partnerships, which is a #unique #strength offering unparalleled influence, access, and power projection.		https://t.co/kRNIoGCWoD
Even if China becomes convulsed by internal problems, its very disarray could subject its immediate neighbors lacking significant sea buffers to tremendous challenges.		https://t.co/mFzJ8rLeaP		https://t.co/n7fp1no99q
Moreover, in its fourth decade of sustained growth in national power, China faces increasing headwinds that will likely slow its future progress overseas, as well as internal risks that may even draw it inward.		https://t.co/kRNIoGCWoD

"Over 35 of those years were spent on the front lines of #CoastGuard operations including 8 commands @ a time when my service was obliged to operate under the mantra of 'doing more with less.' 'Doing more with less' are appropriate words for a martyr..." 		https://t.co/R4DkohaOUt
"For more than 45 years I had the distinct honor of wearing the #uniform of a Coast Guardsman. My career culminated in serving for every man &amp; woman‚Äîactive, reserve, civilian, auxiliary, and their family members‚Äîas the 25th Commandant of the #CoastGuard."		https://t.co/R4DkohaOUt
Why the #CoastGuard is an irreplaceable #US #Armed #Service that must be funded NOW: 		https://t.co/R4DkohaOUt		As explained by its 25th Commandant, @USCGAcademy &amp; @NavalWarCollege grad ADM Paul Zukunft: 		https://t.co/OjpPf6n8gH		"The Coast Guard is... 'doing all with nothing.'"
I'm honored to have briefed ADM Zukunft @ChinaMaritime Studies Institute @NavalWarCollege in 2016, when he was @USCG #Commandant.		Then‚Äîas now‚Äîhe understood the strategic situation &amp; communicated the key points clearly.		Now he's working to save his Service, &amp; we all must listen! https://t.co/7uhmaONjdw
Here's how @USCG Commandant Admiral Zunkunft is spending his retirement now, @VP Pence:		Defending the Patriots of his service by writing in @NavalInstitute Proceedings:		"To add insult to injury, the #CoastGuard is no longer 'doing more with less,' but 'doing all with nothing.'" https://t.co/ulGYYnVf45
"First and foremost, we are an #ArmedService that takes the #MilitaryOath to support &amp; #defend the #Constitution and obey the orders of @POTUS. #CoastGuard personnel have served in #every #military #campaign dating back to our inception on 4 August 1790."		https://t.co/R4DkohaOUt https://t.co/ARm841AV78

Wow. 24 hours and no tweets from @potus @realDonaldTrump.
In conclusion, @JoeLieberman‚Äôs craven lobbying won‚Äôt make America any safer from #ZTE. But @marcorubio &amp; others can help ensure that it doesn‚Äôt harm US. Call expert patriots like @jmulvenon @McReynoldsJoe &amp; @EBKania to testify. They won‚Äôt charge any money &amp; are happy to help US!
So what is actually going on here? @JoeLieberman ‚Äútold @politico he may help #ZTE ‚Äòtry to reassure both their consumers in America &amp; also obviously the US government.‚Äô‚Äù Translation: he will offer high-paid window dressing to help ZTE keep doing bad stuff. https://t.co/ywVGXORPtB
Here‚Äôs why @JoeLieberman can‚Äôt plausibly claim to be helping America by helping ZTE: It‚Äôs already clear what threats ZTE poses. They know it, &amp; we know it‚Äîjust follow @marcorubio. And mark my words: #ZTE WILL NOT change to safeguard the US. It‚Äôs not who they are, or what they do.
‚ÄúBecause I have demonstrated that I share their concerns, ZTE believes my inquiry can engender candid &amp; constructive dialogue that could lead to effective solutions.‚Äù‚ÄîBut not to solutions that actually safeguard US national security, intellectual property &amp; economic prosperity.
.@JoeLieberman: ‚Äú#ZTE asked me to lead this independent inquiry precisely because of‚Äînot in spite of‚Äîthe fact that I share many of the concerns of the Senators &amp; others in the USG whose views ZTE wants to understand &amp; address.‚Äù ZTE clearly wants the best lobbying that $$ can buy.
‚ÄúIt is even worse that he [@JoeLieberman] recognized those concerns as a senator, and is working on #ZTE‚Äôs behalf anyway.‚Äù https://t.co/ywVGXORPtB
And it is also why it is absolutely #unconscionable to lobby for #ZTE. @marcorubio, please tell @JoeLieberman! ‚ÄúIt is bad enough that #Lieberman is working on behalf of a foreign corporation that violated US sanctions &amp; poses #NationalSecurity concerns...‚Äù https://t.co/ywVGXOAe51 https://t.co/UQzkDh6xFl

"The PLA‚Äôs land-based missile and air forces enable other military assets to focus on conducting offensive missions, such as blockades and sovereignty enforcement, as well as defensive operations farther from China‚Äôs shores."		https://t.co/sksucqoEGQ
"Sea-based land attack probably is an emerging requirement for the PLAN. Chinese military experts argue that to pursue a defensive strategy in far seas, the PLAN must improve its ability to control land from the sea through development of a long-range land-attack cruise missile."
"The expansion of naval operations beyond China‚Äôs immediate vicinity will provide China with a diverse set of capabilities for striking targets across the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions as well as exercising control of SLOCs."		https://t.co/dA0CV3PQ9t
"...while China‚Äôs expanding power projection capabilities are applicable to both regional &amp; global missions, China‚Äôs military strategy remains focused on developing the capability to dissuade, deter &amp; if ordered, defeat a potential third-party intervention in regional conflicts."
"These bases, and other improvements to the PLA‚Äôs ability to #project #power during the next decade, will increase #China‚Äôs ability to deter the use of conventional military force, sustain operations abroad, and hold strategic economic corridors at risk."		https://t.co/sksucqoEGQ
"The establishment in #Djibouti of the PLA‚Äôs first overseas military base ‚Äì which hosts a deployed company of Marines and equipment ‚Äì and probable follow-on bases at other locations signal a turning point in the #expansion of PLA operations in the Indian Ocean region and beyond."
"The Chinese govt also methodically cultivates relationships with private media owners &amp;journalists to encourage them to depict China in a positive light. These efforts demonstrate China‚Äôs growing desire to shape public opinion on the international stage. "https://t.co/sksucqoEGQ
"...including the United States. These #radio #stations broadcast pro-China content but have not registered as #agents of a #foreign #government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (#FARA)."		https://t.co/dA0CV3PQ9t

"China‚Äôs expanding official media presence reflects a concerted effort... to shape opinions... &amp; promote China‚Äôs view on key topics. President Xi Jinping urged China Global Television Network, Xinhua‚Äôs int'l media service, to 'tell the China story well' &amp; 'spread China‚Äôs voice.'"
"Advantage in this competition will go to those who not only create the best technologies, but also best protect and field them in creative operational ways...If not hardened vs Chinese legal &amp; illegal pursuits, these actions could erode the US #NationalSecurity Innovation Base."
"China...employs joint venture &amp; licensing requirements that pressure companies into transferring tech, while CHINESE COMPANIES DO NOT FACE THE SAME #BARRIERS abroad. In an effort to gain sensitive knowledge, Beijing is increasingly looking to recruit &amp; relocate talent to China."

"Beyond China, the new gov't is going back to the institutions @MashiRafael demonized: the World Bank &amp; the IMF. Some worry that Ecuador is simply seeking another set of financial masters."		New twist on old theme: #Socialism works great until you run out of other people's money.
"heavy sedimentation means engineers sporadically release large amounts of water to clear out the system, causing flash floods.. Carlos Usam√°['s] brother &amp; a friend were fishing near another Chinese-built dam when a similar flood washed them away..bodies were found 2 days later"
"workers say they‚Äôre sometimes confused because of shoddy #translations.	One sign in #Chinese reads correctly: 'Direct-Current (DC) Pumping Group.'	The #Spanish does not: 'Pressure Group from Washington, DC'"		See the photo!		@owenschurchill @samgeall @SixthTone @chinglishmuseum https://t.co/cLXebKU3XL
"Now, 7,648 cracks have developed in the dam‚Äôs machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by #Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment."		https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"early as 2014, technicians noticed cracks in the Chinese-made stainless steel equipment. That December,13 workers were killed when a tunnel flooded &amp; collapsed. A senior engineer sent records to Mr #Correa,the president, asking to brief him on the problems..was fired days later"
#CocaCodoSinclair Dam Debacle Aftermath		"Mr #Correa, the former president, is in #exile in #Belgium, #wanted for organizing the kidnapping of a rival.Many of his lieutenants have been #sentenced for #corruption or are on the run as well."		Any comment from Belgium, @MashiRafael?
"Under the constant hum of the dam‚Äôs transmssn towers, residents..worry that the twrs will topple in the constant mudslides. Geologists say the tower foundations weren‚Äôt built into bedrock by the Chinese. Another complaint is the bill. ..'Where have my old mother‚Äôs taxes gone?'"
"Today, the dam typically runs at half capacity. 	Ecuador still has to pay back the debt, though. The $1.7 billion loan from China‚Äôs Ex-Im Bank is lucrative for China: 7 percent interest over 15 years. In interest alone, Ecuador owes $125 million a year."		https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"tried to generate the project‚Äôs full 1500MW, but neither the facility nor E‚Äôs electrical grid could handle it..equipment shuddered dangerously &amp; blackouts spread across the country...Ecuadoreans were never told about the failure &amp; a full power test has not been attempted since."
"It ended up being built right under the Reventador volcano‚Äî&amp; nearly 2X the size of the proposed dam that had been rejected decades before. When it finally opened in late 2016...#XiJinping...flew to #Ecuador to celebrate. Yet only two days before the visit, the dam was in chaos."
"Mr. #Correa suddenly had access to money, but a new crisis emerged: The country was running out of power. A drought was depleting the nation‚Äôs reservoirs, paralyzing its dams. Rather than look for another source, Mr. Correa doubled down on hydro power." 		https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"Mr. Borja and other officials were staggered by the terms on Chinese loans. Most came from a large state-owned lender, the Chinese Export-Import Bank, which had high interest rates &amp; required Ecuador to use Chinese companies in construction, effectively eliminating competition."
"Even a Chinese diplomat in Ecuador, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had his doubts about the project.		'We didn‚Äôt give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting,' the diplomat said."		https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"An indpndnt review of the project in 2010,prepared by a Mex govt agency..warned that the amt of water in the region to power the dam had not been studied for nearly 30yrs. Since [then], Ecuador had suffered punishing droughts &amp; there were concerns that its glaciers were melting"
"When Fernando Santos, an energy minister in the 80s, found out that the #CocaCodoSinclair dam was actually being built, he cld hardly believe it.'The volcano has been erupting since the time the Spanish came to Ecuador in the 16th century..in such a risky location was nonsense'"
"The gamble was all Ecuador‚Äôs &amp; now [it's] looking for new loans to plug its many gaps, incl. more money from China. Just this mo, Mr Moreno flew to China to renegotiate some of his country‚Äôs debt‚Äî&amp; borrow another $900 million. 	'The Chinese put the hook in,' said @stevehanke_es"
"..gas subsidies, sevl gov't agencies &amp; &gt;1,000 public jobs. Most economists expect [E] to slide into recession, stirring outrage. 'China took advantage of Ecuador,' said E‚Äôs energy minister, Carlos P√©rez. 'The strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.'"
"Pumping enough oil to repay China has become such an imperative for Ecuador that it is drilling deeper in the Amazon, threatening more deforestation. But that is not enough. Hobbled by the debts, President Len√≠n Moreno has slashed social spending [CONT'D] https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"China gets paid either way. To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80% of Ecuador‚Äôs most valuable export‚Äîoil‚Äîbecause many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not $. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit."		https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"Then there is the price tag: around $19 billion in Chinese loans, not only for this dam, known as #CocaCodoSinclair, but also for bridges, highways, irrigation, schools, health clinics and a half dozen other dams the government is scrambling to pay for." 	https://t.co/IM4DfOmHJv
"Nearly every top Ecuadorean official involved in the dam‚Äôs construction is either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges..a fmr VP, a fmr electricity minister &amp; even the fmr anti-corruption official monitoring the project,who was caught on tape talking about Chinese bribes."
"Now, only 2 years after opening, thousands of cracks are splintering the #dam‚Äôs machinery. Its reservoir is clogged with silt, sand &amp; trees. And the only time engineers tried to throttle up the facility completely, it shook violently &amp; shorted out the national electricity grid."

The @USNavy should also continue to promote a binding regional code of conduct with robust rules of the road. 	Any Chinese failure to cooperate should trigger an explicit bottom-up review of activities that the PLAN itself values--naval diplomacy &amp; other prestigious interactions.
To ensure safety &amp; accident avoidance, #China's #CoastGuard &amp; #MaritimeMilitia must adhere to the same Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (#CUES) to which the PLAN has publicly #committed itself‚Äîtogether with other international standards of seamanship.		https://t.co/WdEapBDcQg

Treat China‚Äôs sea forces holistically: link behavior of all three to US interaction with them.		Even if Chinese interlocutors profess ignorance or dismiss these matters initially, American resolve to impose linkage will make them report back &amp; inform organizational interests.

Chinese leaders deeply fear failure in front of foreigners, esp. if their citizens could become aware of it. To deter harmful activities, US officials should reveal the PAFMM publicly, hold China to international standards of seamanship, &amp; treat its three sea forces holistically.

3) China's distributed unilateral approach of "escort zones" seemed regrettable in principle when there was support in the international community for a genuine cooperative multilateral arrangement. Many other navies coordinated &amp; integrated ops directly. 	https://t.co/BKVmK9VeC6

Multiple factors limited the appeal to others of the ‚Äú#zoned #escort‚Äù approach that China promoted, and have prevented its adoption. 		1) Because some sea areas are much busier than others, it would have resulted in an inefficient distribution of forces. 		https://t.co/BKVmK9VeC6

"The all-male quartet aroused curiosity and inspired innocent guesses about their relationships. 'So, are you father and sons?' 'Colleagues?' And, pointing at Jianguo: 'Is he your boss?'		Of course, their real boss was ultimately Xi, who chairs the National Security Commission."
"With the practice of bei l√ºyou, things grew stranger still. On the road, the three policemen assigned to Jianguo would look after him as though they were his assistants: they bought sightseeing tickets, checked in &amp; out of hotels, helped with his luggage, took snapshots of him"
"TThe Chinese police state can be at once harsh and accommodating, insidious and absurd. I got a sense of these peculiarities in 2008, when Jianguo was released after almost a decade behind bars, and a team of policemen was assigned to monitor him daily for three months."
"In a joke [Chinese liberals‚Äîeducated urbanites] liked about the 2016 U.S. election, a bunch of eunuchs are so appalled by the bawdy quarrels among the married folk that they congratulate themselves: 'How fortunate we are to be castrated!'"		https://t.co/hgkhbFjHAg
Chinese #netizen slang: "whenever law enforcement frames people, or otherwise conscripts them into an activity, the prefix bei is used to indicate the passive tense. Hence: bei loushui (to be tax-evaded), bei zisha (to be suicided), bei piaochang (to be johned), and so on."
