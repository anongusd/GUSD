Healthy thinking is forward focused	This preoccupation with the past will only cause depression. Depression is often a preoccupation  with the past which causes frustration/anger because it can't be changed.

The worst part is that she appears to thoroughly enjoy causing people emotional pain by calling them racists.

@GOPChairwoman Which principles exactly? The magical thinking, or the irrational ones?
It's likely a setup. https://t.co/kkw3pV5yC6
@amjoyshow @TheRickWilson Actually, it's just the opposite of that. We are the party of deep conviction. Our president hasn't changed that. He fights for us, but he doesn't always represent us. It would seem that you're projecting  this liquid morality of the democratic party onto us.
@KatrinaPierson You'd have to sell your soul for that coat of many colors. Unlike Jacob, she's got some credibility issues that won't weather well. Just sayin.
@GOPChairwoman She's Fickle! Not a good trait for a CEO, manager, or supervisor much less a presidential hopeful. Trump is resolved in his politics. Not to mention...open borders. Really?

@KimStrassel This has been President Trump's missing link from the get go. My prayer is that William Barr will force clarity where conjecture has come to reign. Where there is confusion, Satan is generally nearby. His years of experience and tenacious tether to the rule of law is needed.
@BreitbartNews Why not? She's an American icon. Riding on her coat tails is only natural for the Hollywood elite. It's not like they actually care about her as a person. They care about what she has come to stand for, a barrier to the Trump agenda where Hollywood has lost it's luster.
@ananavarro Yes, but President Trump is not motivated by fear like the rest of us. We need him to show us it can be done. He fights for us and there's no amount of Ana Navarro swag that can stop that.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump I'm watching Lawrence O' Donnell literally gloat about how Congress crushed Trump's wall. What us conservatives need to see is literal footage of that wall being built.

@B52Malmet Anybody can be sued and investigated, but what's great about America and the law here is that we are innocent until proven guilty. So when you speak about an investigation as if it were a matter of guilt, that's a dishonesty biased portrayal as to what's really going on.

The border wall alone won't stop illegal immigration, much like flossing alone won't stop cavities. It's one tier of a more comprehensive approach to national security. To resist this important step is tantamount to ludicrousity.
@NewWorldHominin @Laurier Without freedom of speech, education just becomes indoctrination.
@NewWorldHominin @Laurier Dr. Peterson is one of the great minds of our time. He's not even controversial. It's their views that are controversial. Good for you for knowing the difference. One would think the University and ACLU would protect your freedom of speech.

@WatchingWhatYou @TomiLahren Yes. And you're a...?
@klorenzo07 @trish_regan Oh please!
@madisongesiotto you were quite impressive tonight on Fox Business with Trish Regan. Your points about the border wall were spot on. You're an asset to journalism.
You did an absolutely fabulous bit of journalism tonight with your breaking story concerning Venezuela and their close ties with Russia. The American hostages there needs to be addressed. I'm looking forward to seeing this story get ints proper coverage. Thanks!

@realDonaldTrump Please stand strong on the wall President Trump. We are behind you all of the way!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I agree with President Trump!
@ChasingOzPhotog @riverjordan19 That's just an attempt to create some manufactured guilt. Why don't you just tell us what's really on your mind?
@Ocasio2018 @YDSAosu @GretaThunberg Why don't you just concentrate on your own responsibility?!?
@YDSAosu Somehow, I get the idea that you're not completely sincere about the good of that. Just sayin
~timism~	Most of what it takes to be successful and to live a life of fulfillment is a result of refusing to give up, and summoning the courage to grow.
~timism~	When you're committed to achieving something, you'll either achieve it, or learn a alot about yourself along the way, which in-and-of itself is a victory.

@BartHubbuch @RichardGrenell I can only imagine the stellar advice you have for my wealth...lol?!? How's that going for you Bart?
@RichardGrenell Merry Christmas to you and yours Richard Grenell. We appreciate what you do for this country!
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter Hahaha. Try and stop me!
@PlanetTyrus you need to know that we love what you do. You've got perspective man. It's time for your own show. We are looking forward to it. God bless!
@greggutfeld I don't like reruns in the news. It's "The News!", not some kind of sitcom. The GG is different though. There could be a "best of" of the GG show. Ever thought of that yet?
@greggutfeld do you have a playlist for your music? I'd be interested if it's on Spotify. Maybe consider an Eddie Trunk type show on Fox Nation. I love fringe music as well. Music is Central to my life, and I love turning people on to music they hadn't experienced.
@greggutfeld you need to know that you've had a huge positive impact on those of us who have just taken up the news in the last few years. Instead of being just another talking head, you've got perspective unmatched by many, and you make it palatable. We miss Red Eye!
@RichardGrenell just know that we love what you are doing for our country. We trust you! Have a Merry Christmas to you and yours.
@HeyTammyBruce you are one of the most powerful voices out there. We love what you do. You've got great perspective and a steady hand. God bless.

@JaxTerrin @tianaperea__ It doesn't look very private to me or the rest of the world.
@tianaperea__ He was a lot of things, but he was not cruel, but you're willingness to intentionally hurt someone by shaming them publically is cruel.
@tianaperea__ Sure, leave the guy, but this is too much. I'm sorry, but this self-aggrandizing display was in bad taste. Anybody that might tell you otherwise will prove to be people you can't trust, and are junking on your crisis.

@KatiePavlich 	Ms. Katie Pavlich,	You really killed it tonight in your midterm coverage. Of everyone sitting at that table, your perspective was enlightening and spot on. You really do have your ear to the ground and your finger to the pulse of America. ThanX
@TylerStapleto14 @greggutfeld @IngrahamAngle @DanaPerino @JesseBWatters @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Wow, that's just incredibly tone deaf. I'm sure he can more than take it, but it crosses the same line as widows and a president's children. Just sayin.
@KatiePavlich @TheFive You did a great job on The Five, although I barely recognised you at first. The new look is great.
@rob1cox That was very Junior Varsity of you, self-serving and malfeasant. Perhaps a little time off would do you some good. Just saying.
