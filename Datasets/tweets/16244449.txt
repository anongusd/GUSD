We had a learning experience about what happens when you let small banks take lucrative risks and pass the downside off to taxpayers. And then, 20 years after, we had another learning experience about what happens when you let large banks do that.
Finally, the article notes that small banks have been declining since regulatory changes 30 years ago. We recall what happened 30 years ago, yes?
Small banks can't diversify their loan portfolios as well as large banks can. They often can't provide consumers with similar technology offerings. And online banking makes consumers less focused on local branches and personal interaction than before.
For example, this article notes that lots of locals invested substantial retirement savings in the stock of the local bank, and then the bank declined in value. Why would you want people to have retirement savings in one specific local business instead of a diversified portfolio?
I don't get the assumption found in this article, and in many public conversations, that having lots of little local banks is a good thing. https://t.co/53vaucZ9zO

@MrQuindazzi @EsotericCD There are fixed costs of being able to accept cash (like the labor time to open and close the cash drawers) that don’t go up as you do more transactions each day.
@EsotericCD You have to open the cash drawer, balance the drawer, address discrepancies, send an employee to and from the bank or hire a service to do that. The store can be robbed, employees can steal cash. All those avoided by going cashless.
@EsotericCD Part of the confusion is that it can be cheaper at the margin for a retailer to take cash for a given transaction, and the average cost per transaction can still be higher for cash than charge.
@EsotericCD I think most of the conversations around this underestimate the labor and service expense that goes into being able to accept cash. Stores accept cash because they think they’ll lose some customers if they don’t. But if they don’t think that...

@yashar @Fahrenthold Yes, but he claimed to own securities and other assets he didn't actually own. false claim vs. bad estimate
@Fahrenthold @thecitywanderer I guess my bias here is that any banker who takes a financial statement like this at face value, from anyone and especially from Donald Trump, is an idiot who deserves to be fired.
@Fahrenthold @thecitywanderer And we'd routinely apply different valuation multiples on income-producing real estate than clients or other banks -- sometimes because of a difference of opinion, or (this was ~2007) because we thought the then-prevailing multiples were unsustainable.
@Fahrenthold @thecitywanderer In particular, you want to focus on value you can access as the lender. If you're trying to collect under duress, your client is probably financially impaired. If Trump is financially impaired, his brand value is probably also impaired. So how do you lend against the brand value?
@Fahrenthold @thecitywanderer When I was a real-estate banker, we'd literally take these sort of statements and have side by side, the client's valuation and ours. Not because the client was necessarily full of it. But because the bank has its own perspective on value.
@Fahrenthold @thecitywanderer I think it's well-established that he likes making big, bold claims about his wealth in general, as a personality trait.
@thecitywanderer @Fahrenthold And the valuation multiple, obviously, is subjective. What's the legal standard on that, can you offer a multiple so ridiculous it's fraud? The bank is supposed to have expertise and is supposed to choose its own multiple anyway.
@thecitywanderer @Fahrenthold He said he used inflated multiples to value off a rent roll. "if you’re going by the rent roll, you go by the gross rent roll times a multiple — and you make up the multiple, which is something he had talked about —and it’s based upon what he wanted to value the asset at.”
@RPA_Two In practice, you don't lend against someone's "brand value" because in the event they face financial distress, it's quite likely the value of the brand has been impaired, even if the estimate was good at the time you made the loan. Or, a sensible bank does this, anyway.
@RPA_Two If you claimed to have an audited financial statement reflecting goodwill but you didn't, that would be fraud. But just writing on a piece of paper than you value your brand at $4 billion?
So if you inflate factual claims about a property -- you say it has more square feet than it does, or that it generates more income than it does -- that could be fraud. But it's up to the bank to decide what your buildings are worth based on that information.
@LizMair No, the fact that they are useless is what makes them *not* fraud!
The way loan underwriting is supposed to work is the bank takes factual statements about assets (such as how much rent they generate, or how much they last sold for) and then generates its own estimates of value.
I am very skeptical about the idea of these financial estimates as potential bank fraud. When Trump tells a bank his personal brand is worth $4 billion, that might be bullshit, but it's not fraudulent since it's a subjective estimate. https://t.co/Ql8cGQmAPS

@RichardRubinDC @hayden0818 I don't believe that figure is available week to week from IRS, but @ernietedeschi's estimates from Evercore are that taxpayers with lower incomes will see larger percent increases in their refunds than higher earners.
@hayden0818 @RichardRubinDC People are likely to attribute those shifts to the tax law even if they're not due to the change in the law. (And this will happen the other way too -- people who like Trump and get big refunds and assume they're from the tax law even if they're not.)
@hayden0818 @RichardRubinDC Even if the average refund is up slightly, there will be a lot of variation in both directions, often for reasons unrelated to the tax law. e.g., your child turns 17, you lose the child tax credit, but you didn't change your W-4, now you owe more.
@twincities30 @blumom2015 Were you in the AMT last year?
@blumom2015 It has an impact but, for a large majority of taxpayers, other tax cut provisions overcome the limitation on SALT. Only 6% of all tax filers, and 11% of tax filers in the 80th-89th %iles who are likely to be reliant on SALT, have an individual income tax increase.
@DLind But of course, there's huge variation in both directions and even if the median refund goes up a bit, you'll have individual taxpayers who have big swings in either direction, like any year.
@DLind The withholding changes are likewise overstated, I think, though we won't really know until the end of filing season. We've already gotten new data and the average refund is up slightly compared to the same time last year.
@LilacSundayBlog 11% of people making between $149k and $217k. For the whole population, it's 6%.
People are caught in a political narrative. They don't like Trump, they know Trump doesn't like them, they don't like the tax law, therefore Trump raised their taxes. And as with people who "knew" Obamacare screwed up their health insurance, this perception will overcome facts.
@hayden0818 @RichardRubinDC The comparison is against the same time in last filing season, so the effect is the same this year and last.
@hayden0818 @RichardRubinDC The latest data from IRS is that the average refund is very slightly larger this year than last year, though we'll see how that shifts during the rest of filing season.
Still, 89% of the people in that affluent income bracket have an individual tax cut, period, without having to impute a benefit from the corporate tax cut.
@RichardRubinDC Difference between the tables matters mostly for high earners, since people below the 80th percentile get little static benefit from the corporate tax cut. For high income filers it matters-- 11% in the 80-89 %ile have an individual tax hike, but only 8% if you count corporate.
As @RichardRubinDC reminds me, TPC makes a version of this table that excludes the corporate tax cuts. That's where the 6% figure comes from (if you count the effects of corporate tax cuts, only 5% of filers have a tax hike.) https://t.co/gGaL28y5eJ
@RichardRubinDC I remember seeing this table in the past but I can't find it?
@Sr_Penalosa See the "all" row, "with tax increase" column. It's actually 5%, not 6%, I had misremembered. https://t.co/dxquuWhgE0
@nbeaudrot Here are the tables. Yeah, it wasn't a big thing for the 80-89 %iles. Big for 90-94 %iles though. https://t.co/JvcB6Laj7Q
And of course, some people really did get a tax hike. About 6% of them.
Maybe you made more money or less, or had a child, or had a child turn 17, or gave more money or less money to charity, or had a capital loss last year but not this year. Maybe you changed your W-4 elections, etc etc.
Finally: I hear from a lot of people that "my refund did X" or "my tax liability did X" compared to last year, and they attribute that to the tax law. But in most cases, the law is not all that changed.

@televisionaryZW Yes. But they are mistaken about their own tax situations!
There are a couple of reasons for this. One, affluent people keep fixating on how they lost deductions. But their tax rates also got cut, and often that's more important. Two, many of them were already losing a lot of their deductions because of the AMT, which is now repealed.
This effect is not as pronounced as people think. Only 8 percent of tax units in the 80th through 89th income percentiles have a tax increase. https://t.co/dxquuWhgE0 https://t.co/M0hlUUO7wq

My guess is refunds will actually end up being *bigger* this year than last, because the IRS only started issuing EITC/ACTC refunds yesterday, more people get ACTC than did before the tax law, and anyone who claims EITC/ACTC gets a refund by definition. But, still a guess.

@maxwellcyoung @2AvSagas And I think a per-ride pricing structure is better because it encourages customers to only take the e-bike if they care about the power boost, so they’re left available for users who will be going uphill. Could be less than $2 though.

@ryanbeckwith Will discuss with @popehat next week but I think a key thing is pursuing a WH job is not the same thing as *wanting* the job. Cohen's testimony was a claim about his state of mind. How could anyone disprove it?
@2AvSagas @BenDWalsh A per-ride fee also encourages more efficient allocation of the e-bike resource: If you have a dock at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge, people not going over the bridge take regular bikes, leaving e-bikes available for the elevation gain rides.
@2AvSagas @BenDWalsh People who pay for the upgraded membership tier will be annoyed when they find the e-bikes are unavailable 40% of the time when they go to check one out. With a per-ride fee, they just don't pay
@2AvSagas @BenDWalsh If there's a material usage cost to the operator, a per-ride fee might make a lot of sense. Especially in New York, customers probably don't care about the e-bike feature on most rides, but will occasionally value it a lot (to bike over a bridge, e.g.)
@2AvSagas @BenDWalsh Doesn't the right pricing structure depend on how expensive the e-bike upgrades are to install and maintain?
@BenDWalsh @2AvSagas well that's kind of stupid.
@2AvSagas Since the upgrade to an e-bike will be free if that's all that's available at the station, it's hard to see how anyone is made worse off by this, compared to if they made no e-bike upgrade at all.

@RogueNotary Oh, I'm figuring Smollett was *actually* on the phone with his manager during the staged assault. I don't think that's a lie. I assumed he did it so the manager would witness the "assault," and that the manager is not a co-conspirator. But maybe I'm wrong.
@RogueNotary They initially wanted the phone records to corroborate his claim that the assault happened and he was on the phone during it. If that's all on video, why do they want the records?
@RogueNotary But why would police have thought the phone records would be probative?
The question is-- were Smollett's phone records essential to finding the brothers? Would police have had reason to look at those phone records for some reason anyway? Or is CPD sharp enough to find two amorphous men on the street just by seeing where they go in security footage?
If the police never find the brothers, then it looks like an unsolved hate crime. If they DO find the brothers (maybe police are able find them by the Uber they took after walking away) then it eventually unravels-- after WEEKS of it being a MUCH bigger hot-button than it was.
If there had been video footage, the skepticism that shaped the investigation and muted some of the public reaction would have been absent. The attack would have been there, on video. So, why look at Smollett's bank records or phone records?
One thing I've been thinking about: According to prosecutors, Jussie Smollett thought he staged assault would be on camera. If he hadn't screwed up the camera shot, would the hoax have worked? Quite possibly, I think. https://t.co/wf58EVVNWJ

@sebastian_byron Does Michael Cohen strike you as a prudent person, who makes clear-eyed assessments of what he can get away with? He's already lied to congress once.
An ongoing theme with Cohen is he has overstated his access and influence with Trump. He did it to "consulting" clients like Novartis. Why wouldn't he do it to the #resistance?
Or, well, not necessarily making it up. He might be guessing. It's a weird, specific-yet-not-specific memory. He doesn't remember when the conversation happened. And he's inferring a lot from the phrase "the meeting."
I believe Cohen about Trump and the speakerphone call with Stone about Assange (though I would love to hear what Rhona Graff has said about it). I think he's making up the thing about Trump and Don Jr. and the Trump Tower meeting.

On the other hand, you have Kamala Harris's hand-wave toward single payer, to be pursued after a very large middle-class tax cut.
It is to Elizabeth Warren's credit that she's led with a very big new tax, since she'll need one to pay for her agenda, and that she also has a deep catalogue of non-fiscal economic policies. She seems to have thought the most about what it would entail to move policy way left.
This is a contrast from the way the primary has shaped up as a bidding war to implausibly promise the world. The candidates who sound like they've actually thought about whether they can deliver what they promise are Klobuchar and -- in a very different approach -- Warren. https://t.co/BGrMLPA2ee

@asymmetricinfo Oh, and: About $1 billion of the $3 billion in tax breaks/incentives for Amazon were as-of-right, so other employers that step in for Amazon will be able to claim them, if they locate in the outer boroughs. So that’s not freed up, either.
Sorry I should note @asymmetricinfo addresses the crowd out issue.
Also, these future revenues are not “available” to hand out. They weren’t really available to give to Amazon, either. They’re needed to pay for government services for the future residents and businesses who will generate them.
Of course, the extent of the crowd-out is a key question, especially if business investment (taxed or untaxed) has positive spillovers. But my understanding of the research is that, in a crowded metro like New York, the crowd out is near 1-to-1.
So I think people are getting this wrong in a few ways. There’s no pile of $3bn. But subsidized Amazon activity would have, to some extent, crowded out unsubsidized activity. Now that activity will happen and be taxed, improving New York’s fiscal position. https://t.co/uUvxfmvv61

The former claim is harder to understand. People have a lot of trouble intuiting why Amazon adding jobs here would cause other companies to add fewer. (It’s because of the housing constraint on job growth.) But it has the advantage of being true.
I think some people confused the claim that subsidy packages don’t much change net employment (true) for a claim they don’t influence individual firm site decisions (false) and so expected Amazon would build this specific thing no matter what the terms because NYC is so awesome.
@LizMair I think this is right as far as it goes, though he flirts with the idea that SCOTUS could and should overturn and improper impeachment, which seems like a bad idea to me and something SCOTUS wouldn’t go for.
@LizMair This is also how he argues impeachment: That there are unconstitutional uses of the power even if the courts wouldn’t actually stop those uses.
@LizMair At least I assume he means not that the 25th Amendment can’t be used ever but that it can’t properly be used here because Trump is a capacitated and awesome president.
@LizMair I assume his point here is that even if a question is non-justiciable, the party exercising the unreviewable power (in this case, the cabinet) could act unconstitutionally, for example by removing a president who was not actually incapacitated.
@Popehat And think of all the times you mocked me for this.

@Wertwhile @conorsen Chicago has a weak mayor system, though you wouldn’t know it reputationally. And municipal power is divided among the mayor/council, the school board and the Cook County board. I don’t think it has the same history of contention, even though they have bigger shared fiscal issues.
@conorsen Actually sorry I had that timing wrong. The state took over the subway in the late ‘60s, though it was still a bailout of sorts, making it possible to cross-subsidize the system with bridge tolls. https://t.co/L4ANYjfAja
@conorsen And also NYC being the center of the media ecosystem and Albany being Albany.
@conorsen Some very unique factors here, driven I think by NYC being 43% of the state’s population and it being a very strong mayoralty— runs the schools, extensive taxing power including income tax, administers many functions ordinarily run by states and counties, etc.
@conorsen Is this a pattern outside New York?
I find it weird that people talk like Amazon was being flaky. They thought they had terms! Then New York pols tried to change the terms! Which was fine, there was no contract yet. But it was also fine for Amazon to say no. Sometimes, no one is the bad guy, there’s just no deal.
Amazon thought they had a deal, it looked increasingly unclear the mayor and the governor had the power to deliver the deal they promised, there was a lot of political opposition, Amazon decided not to proceed. No harm, no foul. Nobody lost anything they were owed.
I don’t get this line of argument at all. New York didn’t owe Amazon subsidies. Amazon doesn’t owe New York an office complex. It’s not extortion to decline to build an office complex. https://t.co/JieljuICXJ

Normal people care very little where Amazon places its offices -- which is rational. Why should they care?
There are stories you can tell about Amazon and why conservatives or liberals should be offended by it. But it's not cheap and easy to engage in backlash against Amazon. It's not like burning a Nike hat. It means paying higher prices and accepting less convenience, daily.
You might think Jeff Bezos's foray into journalism and the president's attacks on Amazon might have polarized the brand somewhat. But Amazon has excellent trust numbers with both Republicans and Democrats. https://t.co/JpKxvgAmYZ

@JedKolko How do you explain the Bronx?
This suggests that most of AOC's constituents do not view this as a great victory against Amazon. On average they wanted Amazon to come, even at a cost. But to @Wertwhile's point, it is plausible this is a case of asymmetric enthusiasm, where opponents care more than supporters.
And that makes sense, right? City and state taxpayers would have borne the cost of the subsidies and their benefits would have been concentrated in Queens. Some people may have been concerned about cost pressure and crowding, but not most apparently. (Maybe more in LIC, though.)
The most prominent voices of opposition to the Amazon deal have been local pols in Queens, but that doesn't align with public opinion. The Quinnipiac poll showed strongest support for the subsidy package in Queens (55-39) and the Bronx (54-37). https://t.co/jR32EJLy2X
@jryanwhite It’s impossible to calculate the counterfactual because we don’t know what economic activities would occur absent the deal. The Amazon subsidy likely does little to increase total employment in the city because we are capacity constrained.

We know what a TV network that seeks to re-elect the president looks like. It looks like Fox. And Fox looks very different from the others.
I know it has become fashionable to say the TV networks are *conspiring* to re-elect Trump in order to protect their material financial interests, but much of their other news programming is evidence against that theory.
That said, Twitter is not real life, so I don’t know is real world interest levels are that high.

@pearkes It's not bad faith. You made a ridiculous "always" claim, I am explaining to you that "always" is wrong by presenting a case where it is wrong.
@pearkes Not if the proposal exceeds the actual productive capacity of the economy. You can't build 100 million superyachts even if you devote every person in the world to their construction.
@pearkes No it couldn't! The superyachts wouldn't exist because nobody would sell them to you at the old price, and because the resources don't exist to build the all! Jesus!
@pearkes I all "afford" means is that you could print the amount of money it would have taken at the old nominal price to buy something, then that is true and unimportant and reflects the fact that you are playing a stupid word game that wastes my and everybody else's time.
@pearkes One could finance some amount of expenditure through printing and inflation but the ability to do so is finite.
@pearkes George, this is so obviously incorrect I can't believe you're even arguing the point. Suppose the government decides to buy every American family a $100 million superyacht, so it prints $10 quadrillion. Can it now afford a superyacht for every American family? Of course not.
@pearkes No, we can't, because as you print more USD, the nominal price of "anything" in USD changes.
No, the answer to this is not "always yes" because, as you print more money, the nominal price at which people are willing to sell you the thing changes. https://t.co/U7MwzkKEQb

The point is to be deliberately inscrutable, so you can send out the messages "you can have whatever you want" and "I never said you could have whatever you want" simultaneously.
Remember, most of MMT is a language game. https://t.co/AnK5T0jElf
@pearkes What?
@pearkes But this answer means the answer to the first question should be "it depends" not "yes."
@pearkes As you know, I am aware of this merry go round on the issue of whether MMT does or does not rely on taxes to control inflation.
Can we afford a Green New Deal? That depends what it consists of. The federal government is subject to real resource constraints. The observation that the government can print its own money does nothing to help answer the question.
When people praise MMT for the correct things it's helping people come to believe they also need to consider the incorrect things it's helping people come to believe. https://t.co/ynRDK7hSaB

@mattyglesias If freeing companies to move capital around doesn’t spur investment because they can already lay their hands on capital, why would barring them distributing capital spur investment when they have many options to park capital they hold?
@mattyglesias This feels to me like the fight over repatriation in reverse. If we stop companies from distributing profits they don’t wish to invest, they can just buy corporate bonds or whatever. Doesn’t force them to buy equipment or pay higher wages.

Also: This feels like one of those ideas that leaks out because someone is trying to kill it, like when Trump thought about putting his personal pilot in charge of the FAA.

@Route76West The problem is you end up imposing quite high marginal tax rates on middle-income people. The Harris plan already starts phasing out at $30,000 for a single filer, meaning they lose $0.15 of credit for every extra $1 they earn, up to close to $50,000. On top of taxes they pay now
I think it would be ideal for a Dem prez to find a way to declare victory on healthcare-- keep expanding the access to Medicaid and calling it technical updates or whatever-- and focus more on issues that did not absorb the first two years of the last two Dem administrations.
I do think Harris has the right priority order here -- giving lower-income families a few thousand dollars a year in cash would do more to raise living standards than yet another recut of the healthcare financing system. But they are in tension for financing and legislative time.

@dylanmatt single payer creates winners and losers -- you can make a straight-faced case that this has no redistributive effect and creates no losers.
@dylanmatt maybe, but I think it's easier to explain than the payroll taxes you'd need to finance single payer. you could say this thing is literally the premium your employer is already paying (but a little lower) rather than being something that is essentially equivalent to the premium.

Schultz is silly for many of the reasons people have been calling him silly and it's not clear he requires a strong rebuttal. But if a centrist candidate more in the Murkowski mold came along, a Democrat would need to make more of an argument for why centrists must not defect.
Unlike with the Jill Stein voters, who have to bizarrely argue the two parties are the same, a swing voter in the middle just has to object equally to both parties. This middle has moved but it still exists.
There are voters out there who dislike Trump, but don't have their hair on fire about him, and who are also wary of Democrats. Probably not usually for the same reasons Schultz is wary (anti-billionaire rhetoric) but nonetheless. They require an affirmative case for voting Dem.
While I am not a fan of Schultz (and think his appeal to voters will be very limited) there is a weird sense of entitlement in the way Democrats have been discussing the votes of those people who might theoretically vote for him if he runs.
Democrats have long criticized Republicans for disregarding CBO analyses with bad news about their bills. If Dems come in to power with an aggressive spending agenda, they'll have CBO problems of their own: https://t.co/8556Ia5BvZ

@SeanTrende @davidfrum Maybe a more moderate candidate would have won by not losing quite so badly in the white parts of rural Georgia. I just don’t see evidence for the proposition Abrams lost because she wasn’t acceptable enough to suburban moderates.

@ice9cocktail @ebruenig that's true.
@ebruenig For example, the $2000 omelette at Norma's in New York containing ten ounces of caviar is a marketing gimmick  designed to make the $200 price of the version with one ounce of caviar seem less ridiculous.

@baseballcrank we have income tax and payroll tax simultaneously. the existence of both taxes affects what rates are practical, but having one doesn't make the other absurd.
@baseballcrank @BenjySarlin That the income from the wealth is also taxed reduces the maximum wealth tax rate that is practical, but not to zero. (The Netherlands' wealth tax is a substitute for income tax on the wealth.)
Happy Australia Day!
A tax on wealth is very similar to a tax on income generated from wealth.

@anonymousacv Depending on the length of the shutdown, it might be much less than that. A HELOC might bear interest at 6%. If you borrow $10,000 for a month, that's about $50 in interest.

All that said, credit cards surely are a useful financial product for a lot of federal workers in this instance -- this is a good example of why consumers value the option to buy now and pay later. But it's not a reason the shutdown is okay for federal workers.
@ernietedeschi Also, people have some expenses they can't put on a credit card -- like rent or a mortgage payment. If you're liquid enough, this doesn't matter -- charge the credit card on purchases amounting to what you need to borrow. But if you're liquid enough, do you need the bridge loan?
@ernietedeschi ... that costs interest charges, and a lot of people are reluctant to do that. And of course, a lot people have limited credit. Some don't have credit cards at all, by choice or because they have bad credit. So, no bridge loan for them.
To @ernietedeschi's point about Wilbur Ross: The usual way a middle-income person would get a bridge loan is not going to the bank and saying "hi, I would like a bridge loan." It's by carrying a balance on a credit card. I bet a lot of federal workers are doing that. But...

Basically, we bit the bullet on a lot of the unpopular stuff with the ACA -- in particular, high premiums were an inevitable consequence of other popular policies, like the pre-existing condition guarantee -- and this would be a change that's pure public opinion upside.
A key thing you get from these healthcare polls is people like being given more choices and dislike being told to do things. You can't always do all of that -- sometimes you have to restrict choices -- but a public option is a pure choice-expanding policy.
Another thing you get from reading this poll is a robust public option would be very popular -- and because it wouldn't have any fiscal cost (it could even save money) you wouldn't have to raise taxes to do it -- you could even use it to "pay for" something else. https://t.co/tT0St2vprP

This is like arguing over whether the problem is that you fell off the roof or is that you hit the pavement.
I am one of the few who agrees with Chris Christie that firing Christie was a serious mistake that hobbled Trump strategically. But I *also* agree with the people who say the core problem is Trump's personality, not staffing. His personality caused him to fuck up the staffing! https://t.co/kyJw9JBj5H
It is sometimes the case that rivalries between legislative leaders and intra-party power struggles can be used to the executive's advantage. (Chris Christie was good at this with his Dem-held legislature in New Jersey.) This is not one of those situations.

@ClaraJeffery First of all, now you're making assumptions about me. What I would beg you to do is to stop guessing, because that has not worked out so well so far on this story.
@ClaraJeffery I don't think "rich and powerful" is how people ordinarily talk about middle managers at large corporations.
@ClaraJeffery Your specific claim here was that his mother is rich and powerful.
As for the PR firm: As many people have noted, one of the partners in the firm is a prominent conservative commentator, and this is a prominent story of great interest to conservatives. Why would we assume the family is paying full price? I don't know, you don't either.
@Wertwhile My point is that journalists should be careful to have foundations in the claims they make about people who are not otherwise public figures. It's not that this is necessarily wrong. Maybe they are very rich! Why guess?
@Wertwhile As many people have noted, one of the partners in the firm is a prominent conservative commentator. Why would we assume the family is paying full price? Maybe they are, but maybe they're not.
@jbhammer I said she was affluent! What I am contesting is "rich and powerful."
A lot of this discussion has just been, you know, not very journalistic. If the underlying facts are important, one should be journalistic. And if they are not important -- my thesis -- then they don't need to be discussed at all.
Glassdoor has the average "vice president" salary at that firm as being about $150,000. Which makes them one of tens of millions of affluent American families.
Lots of extremely casual claims still being made about this story. For example, why do we say his mom is "rich and powerful"? Because her job title is "Vice President"? At a lot of financial institutions, including the one where she works, that's not an executive title. https://t.co/KVweybc3uQ

How are we possibly on day four of this story?

@mark_dow Of course it’s an objection to the Fed. They call for a fixed interest rate.

These surtaxes are calculated on separate IRS forms. They are not included in the tax bracket tables. But they had a material effect on the progressivity of the tax code, and they survive the GOP tax bill.
In part, this was because Democrats avoided passing any bill that was heralded as a tax increase on the rich. Obama blocked the extension of the Bush tax cuts for earners over ~$500,000. And the ACA imposed surtaxes on high salaries and capital gains, designed to be obscure.
Among other things, people forget that Barack Obama made the tax code far more progressive by the time he left office than when he entered it. https://t.co/0bfncgxx8W

@ptbrennan11 @ebruenig @tylercowen The question is not so much whether the lender has good reasons to charge so much (I’m sure the overhead on small, short loans is high) but whether consumers are made better off by being given the option. Cycles where the loans roll over repeatedly do not serve consumers.
@ebruenig I don’t think nobody has ever benefitted from getting a payday loan. There are real cases where it’s a useful product for a temporary hardship. You can think that and still think restrictions pass cost-benefit analysis because of the more abusive uses.
The shutdown is a rare case in that it creates a mass liquidity issue that is verifiably temporary. As @ebruenig notes, some lenders have noticed this and are willing to lend at low rates. The low rates are how you can tell it’s a good product.
I don’t think this is right. The critique of payday lending is it ends up being used for things other than temporary hardships, at great cost to the consumer. That’s a reason the interest rates are so high — the borrowers are risky credits and are often ill-suited to the product. https://t.co/PAff2Fa7AA

I have been a devotee of the KonMari method for a few years. Organizing your belongings so you can see what you have helps you avoid buying things you already have -- saving money.
but also a lot of Kondo objections seem to be based on intentional misreadings. Like the claim that her method is expensive, because you might have to replace something you threw out. One point of the method is supposed to be that it makes you more selective about what you buy.

@MattBruenig Don't you need some sort of different inflation statistic if you're only looking at the part of consumption that's not fixed costs? If the fixed cost items went up in price more than the discretionary items, that's still a rise in standard of living.

@brantcooper @StephanieKelton SMBs *try* to hire due to huge savings but they hit a real resource constraint and the result is inflation.
@StephanieKelton The fixation on this transition issue and the choice to whistle past the big inflationary factor — thousands of dollars per household to spend on other stuff — is why popularized MMT often feels like vaporware.
@StephanieKelton But you also need to add the new private spending on non-health care goods and services by people who have been relieved of their obligation to pay for healthcare. This is a much larger effect than transition effects in the healthcare sector, and it’s permanent, not temporary.
@StephanieKelton The point I take you to be making here — that single payer only requires a fiscal offset to the extent is increases government spending — is trivially true. Nobody disagrees with that.
@StephanieKelton Show me the US single payer plan that gets us to OECD-average NHE, though.
@StephanieKelton A dollar in national healthcare expenditure savings from single payer is also a dollar of reduction in the fiscal cost of single payer. If NHE fell by half, single payer would not grow the deficit and would not require any fiscal offset. Conventional analysis or MMT, same view.

@erikbryn Well the most common reason they want to foreclose or evict is because they think the borrower or tenant is never going to pay, which doesn’t apply to federal workers temporarily without paychecks, but yes, I agree they also sometimes do for other reasons.
@erikbryn That would be pretty atypical. An eviction means a period when the landlord gets no rent, and residential leases are short so are unlikely to be far below market. I guess if you are rent controlled at a steep discount. For the mortgage, how does the servicer gain by foreclosing?
@bazzerwebb Absolutely
Of course, these workers shouldn’t be in the position of having to seek this forbearance, and this is a messy process and not everyone will get it. But their creditors have reasons beyond altruism to offer it.
This is good business sense. Federal workers are good credits — they have good job security and they’ll get their back pay sooner or later. Landlords and mortgage lenders would be similarly foolish to go through costly evictions/foreclosures instead of giving forbearance. https://t.co/Gg0AvRBbDO

@StephanieKelton If your view is that inflation can and should be managed through something else (like credit policy) then the inflation is a manifestation not of an excessive deficit but of misaligned credit policy, and deficits don’t matter. But you have stipulated that deficits do matter.
@StephanieKelton It seems to me that, definitionally, a situation where the deficit is "excessive" is also a situation where the deficit is supposed to be reduced -- I suppose you could cut spending rather than raising taxes.
@StephanieKelton If you say excessive deficits manifest as higher inflation, how is that not also saying that you manage inflation through fiscal policy?

@AndyHarless There are two misconduct claims here: One is conducting research on human subjects (the journal editors) without IRB approval, and the other is data fabrication.
@AndyHarless As discussed in the article, the IRB would have likely insisted that they notify the journals that the papers were fake once they were approved, so they wouldn't actually be published.
It’s worth noting, even though these researchers call this “Sokal Squared,” the original Sokal Hoax paper was not fabricated as such — it was a pile of nonsense but did not contain false empirical claims.
I have found the pushback here bizarre. Of course it’s academic misconduct to seek publication of a fabricated study in a journal, even if you were only doing it to make a point. https://t.co/MvCRnJRcyP

@TheStalwart @SaysSimonson @RomanchukBrian This is true of the existing bonds, but what if the government wants to issue new ones? If the holders want out of the bonds, their price will have to fall, which will push their yields up relative to where the government intends to issue new bonds.

@NathanTankus @StephanieKelton Congress can take back any powers it delegates, and when people face tax increases that feel arbitrary (because they've been told taxes don't even finance government activities!) there will be significant pressure to reclaim the powers and stop the tax increases.
@gray_sky_guy @Noahpinion isn't this the same thing? the result when the legislature fails to engage the contractionary mechanism is hyperinflation.
@StephanieKelton Right and my point in my article is that the legislature remains subject to political pressures, and it is likely to be reluctant to take the steps that would be necessary to prevent such acceleration.
The idea that we don't have to worry about fighting inflation because MMT won't allow inflation to arise seems... overconfident. https://t.co/KgamarLyle

@KevinWGlass Are these data reliable? I am shocked that home production hours overall haven't declined since 1900. People have washing machines now and they don't cook nearly as many meals at home.
Maybe the answer is to aim to shift social attitudes against marriages where the woman is the primary earner, perhaps by increasing expectations that men will do more of the household work? I am skeptical that policymakers can do much to change these attitudes or behaviors.
I don't know exactly what you are supposed to do about that? Interventions specific to raising especially middle-skill men's wages -- that is policies to grow the wage gap -- seems like an odd choice, although that is often implicitly prescribed.
The wage gap is not as wide as it was. And women are no longer shamed for failing to marry. So, now it is harder for many working-class men to make a case that it is worth marrying them. Also, both men and women seem to have distaste for marriages where the woman earns more.
I think a big problem with the "economic and social change undermined marriage and family for the working class" frame is that a main way it did this is by making women less dependent on men. https://t.co/kl5rL8RRQT

The more the contracting firms spend on labor, the more profit they collect, as their fees are a percentage of project costs.
MTA board member Charles Moerdler to NYT in 2017: “I think people like doing business with people they know, and so a few companies get all the work, and they can charge whatever they want." What does this mean? It means both labor and management benefit by overstaffing projects.

@MichaelLipsitz "imagine everyone's current contribution just goes to the government instead" yes, that's the traditional way to finance single payer, with a new tax. but you hear people say MMT makes that unnecessary, which it doesn't.
@MichaelLipsitz And even if you do have a $2 trillion reduction in total healthcare expenditure, moving all the currently private expenditure onto the public ledger with no tax increase would raise nominal incomes by something like 10x that figure over the same period. Hugely inflationary.
@MichaelLipsitz No. The Mercatus study stipulates to single payer advocates' claims that would be built around a sharp reduction in rates paid to providers, which is a political choice (and a difficult one). Mercatus does not claim that paying such rates is actually a feasible choice.
@MichaelLipsitz It's true that if you cut health care prices so drastically that single payer did not increase public health expenditure, you'd need no tax increase.
@MichaelLipsitz That's not a law of nature. Reducing unit health costs require political choices that will face resistance from both providers and consumers. Do you plan to cut specialist physician salaries to match other countries? And of course, expanding coverage will increase consumption.

And this ridiculous theater now where the WH thinks they're going to get Democratic support for the wall through talk and talk and talk about a border crisis -- who is this supposed to be fooling? It is such a waste of everybody's time.
The facts are obvious: The president thinks a wall sounds cool, and that's why conservatives find it necessary to build one. The wall is not relevant to the broader agenda -- everify, entry-exit visa tracking, reduced legal immigration -- that restrictionists want.
Republicans could have put this money in any number of spending bills. They could have even used the reconciliation process to fund additional border security with a simple majority. They would have not needed one Democratic vote. They didn't because it's not actually important.
It's insulting that we even have to have this conversation -- it's the same as conservatives claiming for YEARS that there was a Republican health care policy agenda and getting all huffy when I would say it didn't exist. ("We have lots of plans!" etc etc)
The complete bad faith of all the conservative commentators claiming to now think billions of dollars for barrier funding inherently important is that Republicans, over and over, chose not to make it a priority in policymaking over the last two years and they didn't care.

@mattsteinglass @conor64 And of course, any "the tax cut won't pay for itself" coverage was coverage about the problem of it creating deficits.
@mattsteinglass @conor64 I think you were reading a specific kind of lefty commentator who was especially invested in the years they spent arguing against austerity and so felt compelled to soft-pedal. It's not Anderson Cooper's fault you were selecting for people who agreed with you.
@mattsteinglass @conor64 Yes it was. What do you know? You live in the Netherlands.
@mattsteinglass @conor64 Anderson Cooper is not a member of the opposition party. It's one thing to say to Republicans "hey, you guys didn't care about that when it's your thing." It's nonsense to give as an answer to a member of the press.
@mattsteinglass @conor64 But that's still not true. It passed Congress by a narrow margin. All she is saying is that people in the other party didn't care. But that's a very different claim with many fewer implications than what she said; it's just a tu quoque.
@mattsteinglass @conor64 So, take her seriously, but not literally? (Also, that statement you propose is also not true; the tax cuts were unpopular, a lot of people cared.)

I would also note, that despite the fashion for MMT (and the misconception that MMT means deficits don't matter) the countries with single payer do not appear to finance it by running unlimited budget deficits.

I basically like Biden, he was an effective VP, and he could make a strong experience/efficacy case for being a good president. But unlike, say, Amy Klobuchar, he's not in a good spot to argue he'll outperform other possible nominees.
I also think the theory of Biden as a candidate who's especially strong in the Rust Belt is just that: A theory. The man has a strong track record of winning elections in Delaware, two dismal presidential campaigns, and performances on a ticket with Barack Obama.
Biden thinks he has a bunch of clear rules around what money he does and doesn't take that insulate him. The Clintons thought that too. If you're going to retire and do this stuff, retire.
If Biden's going to make an electability argument, shouldn't his building of a big-dollar NGO apparatus around himself count against him? This seems like a key lesson from 2016. https://t.co/jACMJM5TOy https://t.co/f4AUwsFaXy
@BrettLoGiurato The traditional view is that you use fiscal policy to finance the government and monetary policy to control inflation. The MMT view is that you use fiscal policy to control inflation and monetary policy to finance the government. Even if you buy this, fiscal policy still matters.

@MarketUrbanism @2AvSagas @RidersNY We’ve been saying for years “they do this stuff easier and cheaper and faster in Europe” so when Cuomo says “I found an easier, cheaper, faster way to do this from Europe” we ought to at least hear out some more details.
@MarketUrbanism @2AvSagas @RidersNY Is any of this less plausible than “the driving force behind the subway slowdown is the MTA’s choice to arbitrarily cut speed limits and then install faulty sensors to enforce those limits”?

@2AvSagas Also, Cuomo deciding that cost-saving technology is sexy is an improvement from his deciding that blue-and-gold tile is sexy.

I do not hate this idea of having uncommitted outsiders review MTA plans for whether they are stupid. We should try it with huge, overly expensive capital projects.
Cuomo opens this press conference by explaining that he basically ignores what the MTA is doing, unless it's something big and shiny, because he is very busy.
Incidentally: If Cuomo is right that a closure is unnecessary, then he's admitting he's been asleep at the switch for three years as the system he oversees has planned one.
@ClaudiaKincaid_ Yes. But Cuomo has been governor this whole time. If the closure isn't necessary he should have blocked it earlier. I was skeptical initially, but the administrators who know more about the system than I do seem to have thought it would take 7 years of weekend work otherwise.
Don't blame me, I voted for Nixon in the primary and Molinaro in the general. (Molinaro had the best and most detailed subway plan, including a shift toward longer closure windows for faster and cheaper repairs -- the opposite of what Cuomo is doing here.)

I do think there is a personality backlash against Warren among some voters, and I do think it is driven in part by sexism, and I do think it will matter politically. But it's possible to win in the face of that, with the right other strengths.
The native American story has been the one real, big problem for Warren, but Trump's ham-fisted handling of it might make many voters grow bored of it -- because unlike with the persistent email server issue, there's no significant underlying wrongdoing, just a bizarre choice.
Republicans think they can re-Hillary her, and Democrats fear that too, because they think all the anti-Hillary narratives were made up by a hostile media etc etc.
This has been a great news cycle for Warren, because she is in fact much more likable than Hillary, with much less baggage. She gets the benefits of the pro-Hillary backlash with many fewer downsides. And she has a more appealing policy agenda, if people ever listen to it.

Warren is also better-positioned than Sanders to develop useful, low-fiscal-cost policy initiatives when either of them hits the inevitable roadblocks that prevent large increases in government expenditure as a share of GDP.
Politics is in significant part about aesthetics, and how they feel about the terms "socialist" and "capitalist" is an important aesthetic distinction between Warren and Sanders, despite their fairly similar policy views. https://t.co/GCdokOpSmQ

Bernie’s fans are appropriately nervous about how many of his 2016 voters he’ll hold on to, and their best pitch is an ideological purity argument, and they are right that Bernie is more ideologically pure. How many voters care about community bank regulation is an open question.
My working theory: outrage and counter-outrage over Bernie-Beto camp disputes (otherwise a thoroughly *normal* story about leading candidates trying to make their cases/solidify blocs) reflects a few thousand insiders’ desire to relitigate 2016 &amp; matters very little to voters.

People focus on what Fed Chairs do but the power is really vested in the board and the FOMC. Chairs lead by influence, which would be hard if the chair was not respected.
Suppose Trump fired one or more Fed governors. Then, a voting majority on the FOMC would consist of the regional Fed bank presidents, since the Fed board already has only five members. Would Trump expect to get new Fed appointments confirmed after firing Powell?

Remember, the Fed does not control long-term interest rates. It influences them by sending credible guidance about its future actions. If it loses political independence, it loses the ability to do that and, if investors think the president will have it print money, rates spiral.

“Because you are entitled to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects” would be an amusingly dry read if the subject matter were not so dire. It’s basically “Because you are a reckless moron.”
Very unusually for a Trump admin resignation letter, but understandably in these circumstances, this letter contains no praise of the president.

@GingerGibson This but unironically
My main wish for presidential debates is NO LIVE AUDIENCE. The audience disrupts, the candidates pander to it, it eats time and makes the debates less substantive and serious.
I still think there won't be a shutdown, because Trump wants to go to Mar-a-Lago, and he'll be convinced that if he wants to show he's fighting he has to stay in Washington and fight.

Fun fact: The federal government refused to finance the Holland Tunnel, so New York and New Jersey went ahead and built it on our own. https://t.co/rhmaCR04EN
New York and New Jersey are rich, if the tunnel is so important we can find a way to build it ourselves. Putting this on Trump is giving the local officials who have so badly mismanaged the Port Authority a pass.
Note, the reported trial balloon about wall-for-tunnel is from Republicans, not Democrats, because Republicans are the ones who are desperate for a deal.
A wall-for-tunnel deal makes no sense. Democratic opposition to the wall is ideological (and for pretty good reason). They shouldn't trust Trump's FTA to administer the tunnel money. And the inevitable cost overruns mean the tunnel may not even get built with whatever money. https://t.co/XV1TDyE1x7

I think the extent to which the rise of this consumer/employee influence channel is a good thing for society is to be determined. My guess is it will do more good than bad, and be more democratic and more humane than other means of influence it displaces. Not sure.
@cmigbear Well, I guess, as a broad matter, it seems good for firms to be responsive to stakeholders. But stakeholder power here overrepresents some demos (wealthier; younger; more urban). Will that be a consistently good way to shape social phenomena?
@dylanmatt *for some industries
@cmigbear I'm not sure.
The old model was that firms wanted to be uncontroversial, to avoid alienating any potential customers. The new model is that taking a side on a controversy can make the brand *more* appealing to some customers, even if it alienates others. This actually cuts against Nate's worry
Firms don't just face pressure to boycott; they also face pressure to not boycott. That's a balance that means this doesn't have to lead to a race to the most bland. But there is a clear liberal bent in who many firms feel the need to appeal to these days. https://t.co/njyH3BApUn
I don't think this is the equilibrium. It's not who's loudest. It's a combination of who's important to the company's strategy and who's likely to change their market behavior based on what the company does. Customers and also employees. And there are principal-agent issues. https://t.co/SzL7pvDVZH

This is similar to the Local Law 11 rules, theoretically necessary to prevent people from getting killed by falling bricks, that lead to New York being festooned in semi-permanent scaffolding that somehow isn't necessary in other cities with lots of tall buildings.
In general, the mechanism we use to deal with things that might theoretically be dangerous is tort law. If a sign falls on your head, sue the business that hung the sign. We don't need government agents going around and fining small stores $6,000 for not registering their signs.
Maybe this regulation is stupid and the city should repeal it. https://t.co/OZsQb9IW8s

Well now it’s a bargaining chip https://t.co/tEtMzmWI8p
This is a plausible answer. https://t.co/AIu8fPmHiM
(By the way, the way you can tell Trump fired Yellen because she was associated with Obama or a woman or short is that he replaced her with someone whose monetary policy views were *very similar* to hers)
Now, maybe if Trump wanted lower rates he should have gone out and gotten himself a chairperson more dovish than either Yellen or Powell. Who would that have been?
Oh! And of course, the current rate hike campaign started when Yellen was still chairman!
In particular, describing Powell as “hawkish” is wrong. Hawkish compared to what? He’s in the middle of the road on monetary policy. What changed over the last two years was the economic environment, not the fundamental outlook on rates driving the Fed.
This is a bad analysis. I don’t think it’s clear at all the Fed would have pursued a different path on rate hikes if Yellen stayed as chair. Powell has similar views to her, and they work together as a board. https://t.co/NouUomMNj3

Now, maybe there is a big access cost here (though this story also doesn't deal w/ prevalence of prepaid debit cards). But if you're going to make policy around this, you need to weigh the real cost to business of the regulation, rather than just saying "oh that's so elitist."
When most of your customers aren't paying cash, your cash handling cost as a fraction of cash sales is likely much higher than your credit card processing fees. If you think it will cost you almost no sales, dropping cash is likely to be attractive.
Accepting cash is labor intensive. You need to set up cash drawers when you open and balance them when you close. A manager needs to address discrepancies. You have to send employees to the bank to pick up change and drop off cash, or hire a service to do that.
It would be nice if any of these pieces bemoaning cashless sales would actually engage with the principal reason businesses might save money by not handling cash. It's not about crime. https://t.co/AqELBcrE8f

Of course this feeds a conservative narrative that affirmative action is a cynical &amp; easily-abused concept, which is one of the reasons they mock Warren. But liberals should have a more direct concern with it. Fine to say it's not the most important thing, but it's still a thing.
If you think diversity metrics and initiatives serve an important purpose, presumably you undermine that purpose by letting an elite institution say you provide ethnic diversity within it when you, by any reasonable measure, do not.
I think a reason Warren is flummoxed here is all the intra-left conversation incorrectly assumes there was no ethical question for her to deal with in the first place. It is: was it ethical to let Harvard hold her out as an example of racial diversity? https://t.co/DkOlUTPvsK

@cszabla Morgan Stanley says "high street" retail asking rents (core areas like Fifth Ave) peaked in 2015 and were down about 15% by 2017.
@cszabla Yes, this is a question, and for a period it's leading to elevated vacancy along a few elite corridors -- not borough-wide, and not a "crisis" requiring a policy intervention, let alone a citywide policy intervention.
Landlords enjoyed astronomical rents for luxury boutiques when they could get them. But the luxury retailers were losing money. When these spaces lease, they'll probably still be upscale, but whatever goes in will be more useful to the masses than an empty luxury store.
One more thought on the faux-crisis of Manhattan retail vacancy. Often, it's discussed in terms of landlords only wanting luxury retailers. But in the places with truly elevated vacancy (like Bleecker St.), what's happened is a luxury retail bubble has popped.

@pegobry Am I wrong to squint at these polls and think Macron can get re-elected at this level of popularity by taking 25% in the first round and beating Le Pen in the second again?
This isn't why people don't buy canned tuna. Canned tomato consumption is holding up just fine. The difference is canned tomatoes are often superior to fresh ones, while other canned products (including tuna) are disfavored in favor of fresh food. https://t.co/FVFs36tLhW

@RadioFreeTom For example, Boot has been beating the drum on gun control. Rubin hated the tax cut bill because it was too tilted to the rich. I agree with those positions! Are they conservative positions?
@RadioFreeTom This is what voters do: They see what other people who seem to broadly share their values seem to think about specific issues and they view those views sympathetically. It can be a fine heuristic. But if your new people aren’t conservatives...
@RadioFreeTom And there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m not a conservative either. And if the people in your movement seem to have gone nuts, it’s proper to revisit your priors and see if they (and you) were wrong about other stuff in the past.
@RadioFreeTom This doesn’t make someone not a conservatives. But some pundits of this style — not you, I think, but Boot and Rubin for example — who have simultaneously shifted on other issues not clearly related to this in ways that I does think make them not conservative.

Another odd thing in Japan is pricing compared to the US. I’d say overall major Japanese cities are a bit cheaper than New York, but some things are substantially cheaper (food, rail travel, mid-range hotels) while others are more expensive (taxis, upper-range hotels)
One of the things that astounded me during two weeks in Japan was how free-flowing the traffic was, even in huge cities. I’ve heard a few explanations: high highway tolls; difficulty and high cost of car ownership, especially larger cars; excellent transit; economic stagnation. https://t.co/mGxuUM2ri6

@JamieMcCarty It’s LA-Xceptional
@scottringsage @NateSilver538 This is true, but I will be flying in and out of PDX for the first time this week! I am prepared to update my priors.

@cjane87 @reihan I think there is a story you can tell about how Republicans might try to expand their base by drawing more votes from non-white men. It is not a happy story for gender politics.

I think this is a missing piece of the “who lost Ohio” analysis for Dems — Kasichism was popular (if not always popular with Rs) and the Ohio GOP reaped the political benefit of moderation.
Mike DeWine’s good sense in not joining the latest multistate Obamacare lawsuit also helped.
You know, Republicans like to hate on John Kasich, but his choice to expand Medicaid probably helped the GOP do so well in Ohio this year by robbing Dems of a strong electoral issue.

Remember, the people complaining about the Amazon subsidies are by and large the people who complain a lot about Andrew Cuomo. (This includes me — I complain a lot about Cuomo.) And Cuomo is very popular.
Why would it be popular? People like Amazon, they like economic development in the abstract, this is especially sexy economic development, the costs are pretty abstract, most New Yorkers aren’t in western Queens and won’t be directly impacted by rents or traffic.
Incidentally, while I don’t like the HQ2 incentives package on its merits, I don’t buy the “this is bad press for Amazon” narrative. Watch for the first polls, I bet this is popular.
The president will soon be a beautiful butterfly of bitterness and resentment. https://t.co/PWRKgFgy2D https://t.co/VRru4Cggzg

@EsotericCD Didn’t she already say publicly she’s living off savings bc she can’t really work for pay during the transition? She never claimed to have no money, she claimed she couldn’t afford to rent an apartment in DC.
@karlbykarlsmith @bencasselman He won’t really even take over LIC though! The site is a few blocks from Court Square, over from the river, off center from the neighborhood’s core.
@_DarrenCohen @bencasselman About $900 million of the $3 billion package is the tax break any company gets for going to the outer boroughs.
@bencasselman Why do they need to take over?
Wait so next year Oklahoma will have a Rep. Horn and a Rep. Hern? https://t.co/8OhGCSET4a
Going to New York was about talent. Going to Queens instead of Manhattan was in significant part about subsidies, I strongly suspect. https://t.co/Ml2nDtLIFY
@dlharrell Google won’t get the state subsidies because they’re discretionary and it won’t get the city subsidies because it’s not in the outer boroughs.
@dlharrell No, this isn't right. The state program is essentially discretionary. The city program only applies in outer boroughs and upper manhattan.
You can think of the Amazon deal as being about New York's inability to build subways at a reasonable price. Instead of building more trains to carry commuters to Manhattan, we're paying a major firm $3 billion to get it to fall in love with Queens. https://t.co/088hSgZk4F
Here's the best argument I could find for New York's $3 billion Amazon subsidy deal. It's all about Queens, and I don't think it's ultimately convincing, but there is a logic. https://t.co/088hSgZk4F

@JarekFA Maybe we can use duck boats
The other problem with ferries is by definition about 50% of the area close to the station is undeveloped because it’s WATER
This is why ferries are bad, for those of you who are like “but I like boats” or whatever https://t.co/uDRGQY6NNu
