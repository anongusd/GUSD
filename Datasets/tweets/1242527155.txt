"but I will be playing for you...at least one of us gonna be free" - chills watching that scene - true sacrifice. @ForestWhitaker  #Roots

RT @Makani_Themba: @JotakaEaddy I'm 1.7 million miler on @UnitedAirlines &amp; often experience this kind of bias. Time for industry wide chang‚Ä¶
24) Implicit and explicit bias is real and should be addressed... even on planes. too many people have the same stories.. #flyingwhileblack
23)I hope @AmericanAir remind gate agents that cultural sensitivity &amp; just plain respect is really important for business. #flyingwhileblack
22) All too often we are subjected to questions, stares, assumptions, and mistreatment.  Today was my day. #flyingwhileblack
21) Again my experience is trivial to the massive violence faced by many people of color but I felt compelled to share. #flyingwhileblack
20) Further that yes.. black people are allowed and do fly first class.  And that its rude to make assumptions.  #flyingwhileblack
19) It is my hope that the .@AmericanAir agent will soon learn that class has no color.  #flyingwhileblack
18) The difference between me &amp; other passengers was my skin color Today .@AmericanAir reminded me of how different it was #flyingwhileblack
17) It is a sad reminder that while much has changed much remains the same.  #flyingwhileblack
16) While my experience is no comparison to the tragedies and violence that many face simply living while black .. #flyingwhileblack
15) I posted on FB about the experience.  Immediately several friends commented with similar stories of #flyingwhileblack
14) I respond to the agent "Yes I know"  She then aplogizes.While her aplogy was likely sincere; her judgement was not. #flyingwhileblack
13) But the fact that this happens all to often.. and in every medium.  #flyingwhileblack
11) At first I was shocked, then perplexed, and then I got really annoyed.. not because my "privledge" was challenged..but #flyingwhileblack
10) No warm welcome for me... rather the @AmericanAir gate agents says "Im sorry ma'm but were boarding first class" - #flyingwhileblack
9) I approach the gate &amp; motion to put my cell phone/boarding pass on the scanner.  But something very different occurs. #flyingwhileblack
8).  the @AmericanAir gate agent at Gate 40 smiles and greats everyone as they board. (even the woman who as in coach). #flyingwhileblack
7)I notice a nice couple in front of me flying with a baby. husband was in first class but wife was in coach. no issues    #flyingwhileblack
6). The gate agent announced boarding for first class.  Approximately 10 people who were white boarded before me.    #flyingwhileblack
5) As usual the gate agent announced that the flight would be boarding shortly.  So I grabbed my bag and went to the gate. #flyingwhileblack
4) I generally fly first class on all of my flight because of my status. Today was not different but the experience was  #flyingwhileblack
3) Today I was on @AmericanAir 1076 from @Reagan_Airport to ORD.  I was ticketed in first class. #flyingwhileblack https://t.co/tVB4BU1Xh1
2) I'm a frequent flyer. Often traveling back and forth across the country. As of a result I am #ExecPlat on @AmericanAir #flyingwhileblack
