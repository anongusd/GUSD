“The US flag insignia is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward.” - DA PAM 670-1  #AssaultForward https://t.co/PnIqEYJwXy
