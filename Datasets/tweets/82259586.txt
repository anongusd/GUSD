@hmajerik @RiNoArt Also would appreciate addressing fracking issue and why you see the need to push working class deep into the suburbs and expose them to abuses to make the numbers work. Plenty of public resources to make it happen in the inner city.
@hmajerik @RiNoArt tax revenues off the rails in @RiNoArt . Problem is lack of complimentary investment in affordable housing &amp; derelict admin by Mayor-- currently getting in the way of Tiny Homes and Artspaces and have produced nothing to date. Can't do affordable units without public commitment

@hmajerik @RiNoArt Let me guess. Did developers retain mineral rights?

@hmajerik More than 2 affordable units being lost for every 1 created citywide despite exploding tax receipts. Not a single affordable unit created in @RiNoArt to date but great job my Mayor?
@hmajerik Can't happen without better prioritizing public funds away from subsidizing your sprawl development and toward inner city housing so working class and minority residents can be part of the growth long term.
@hmajerik On call to make it happen 4 pennies on the dollar compared to long term liabilities to support sprawl development.  I can promise anything we're involved in will be incorporated into urban fabric and wont be deep in the suburbs to further exaggerate gentrification/displacement
@hmajerik Would love to but all of the public $ required are taken up by cronies/  Here's our proposal from 2 years ago for 300+ affordable units in inner city. Stood to be biggest single phase affordable project in the CO. Mayor's office got in the way of it https://t.co/sXaOJWRTTk
@hmajerik To be more accurate, we built the train station w private funds that provides active public amenity at the train stop. Affordable housing is needed compliment and it can't happen w derelict Mayor's office. Check into it before you start slinging dirt around
