.@MIkeFroman: When leaders gather for the #AfricaSummit, defining next generation of #trade relations will be at center of their discussion
.@MikeFroman: As POTUS said in Africa last year, we seek a partnership rooted in equality and shared interests #AfricaSummit
African dvlopment requires hard infrastructure, #trade capacity building, training for young entrepreneurs, trade facilitation #AfricaSummit
.@MikeFroman: Requires a comprehensive #trade &amp;investment strategy w/ a renewed #AGOA &amp;support of public &amp;private sectors on both continents
.@MikeFroman: The clearest lesson from #AGOA -Tariff preferences are not enough; we must address the impact of surrounding constraints
.@MikeFroman: We've been involved in a comprehensive review of #AGOA to determine what‚Äôs worked well &amp; what needs to be changed
.@MikeFroman: #AGOA has been good for America.  Last year, US #exports to sub-Saharan Africa supported nearly 130,000 jobs in the US

.@MikeFroman: Under #AGOA, total #exports from sub-Saharan Africa to the US have tripled &amp; improved business &amp; investment for AGOA countries
.@MikeFroman: The potential for #trade to drive global dvlpmnt remains strong. To reach it, we must update our approach to trade &amp; dvlpmnt
.@MikeFroman Technological connectivity creates new opportunities to expand #trade, promote growth &amp; address major dvlpmnt challenges.
.@MikeFroman: With growing South-South #trade, countries can provide for their citizens &amp; contribute to the dvlpmnt of poorer neighbors
#Trade works when benefits are broadly shared. If workers have no voice &amp; work in unsafe conditions, promise of trade is unfulfilled
.@MikeFroman: Negotiating high-standard agrmnts like #TPP &amp; #TTIP focus on securing the strongest labor &amp; enviro provisions of any agreement
.@MikeFroman: US preference programs beneficiaries must have rule of law, fundamental protections for workers &amp; good governance principles
.@MikeFroman: We must seek dvlopment that is broad, inclusive &amp; sustainable. Raising standards is a key objective of our #trade policy
.@MikeFroman: The first group of #GSP beneficiaries S.Korea, HK, Singapore, Israel &amp; Mexico chose #trade as key part of economic strategy
.@MikeFroman: #Trade allows developing countries to import technologies at lower prices, encourages efficient resource allocation
.@MikeFroman: #Trade fuels growth, investment&amp; reduces poverty, which translates to more jobs &amp; increased incomes for the poor
.@MikeFroman: While #trade alone can‚Äôt solve every dvlopmnt challenge, it‚Äôs a necessary part of successful &amp;sustainable development strategy
.@MikeFroman: Between 1991 &amp; 2011, dvlping countries‚Äô share of world #trade doubled &amp; nearly 1 billion people were lifted out of poverty
.@MikeFroman: #Trade advances global development by promoting growth and alleviating poverty
.@MikeFroman: Since WWII, the US has been one of the principal architects of a global trading system founded on openness, fairness &amp; freedom
.@MikeFroman: We must reexamine the relationship btwn #trade &amp; development &amp; recommit to a US trade policy that drives broad global growth
