@priaribi @wendybutton @jonfavs @TVietor08 @PodSaveAmerica @crookedmedia assumed this was about me but then saw pic. i am prepared to admit defeat.
I say this because Kraft will (rightly) get the bulk of the blame here, but a complicit abuser is a complicit abuser whether you're a billionaire or a mailman. The others involved in this ring need to be brought to justice too.
Sex trafficking rings are just that: rings. It takes many complicit voices - knowing violators, maybe unnknowing violators - so as we learn more, remember that this goes way deeper than Kraft alone. His criminality deserves to be amplified, but there are more.
@fauxredhead Haunts me to this day. &lt;3
I actually think this extends beyond Democratic candidates. Social media (especially Twitter) rewards the voices with the quickest, loudest reactions, and very rarely those that are more thoughtful and studied. It's a lesson for all of us as both creators &amp; consumers. https://t.co/Zi0NgOfIk6

Also her grand entrance is via a mermaid-sized shell. So there are definitely stagehands and/or choreographers who have to prep the details of that entrance. None of them notice she‚Äôs gone??? Weak production value! Not befitting the fucking KING OF MERFOLK.
@Tres_Natalie Thank you; this is what Twitter is for
I‚Äôm just saying that there are several people in this production who should have known that Ariel was missing and they could have either tracked her ass down or let the understudy go on (you know her sister Adena or Adela was so thirsty for that)
I‚Äôm sorry but if there‚Äôs one thing I know about Sebastian is that he is a DETAIL ORIENTED lil crustacean. I think he would know if his STAR isn‚Äôt there to perform his new banger???
Also Sebastian wrote the song and he didn‚Äôt give Ariel a pep talk before and make sure she‚Äôs feeling good before the song debuts?? He would know if she was a no show!
They‚Äôre Jackson 5 and Ariel is MJ and you‚Äôre gonna yell ‚ÄúPLACES!‚Äù before you make damn sure that your star has been through hair and makeup???
Ok I can‚Äôt hold this is any longer: in The Little Mermaid, how is there no stage manager to make sure Ariel is backstage and ready to go before her sisters go on to perform Daughters of Triton?

Don't buy into the argument that this is about unrealistic expectations that women place on men. No. Not wanting to be preyed upon or misled or treated with total disregard for ones dignity is not unrealistic; it should be standard. This is NOT about seeking perfection.
This "I'm sorry I'm not a perfect man" response is such bs. Nobody is "a perfect man." And for women to expect to be treated with basic dignity and respect is NOT the same as women expecting "perfection." (1/2) 		https://t.co/VrTFZFTG86

To anyone perpetuating the "How dare Dr. Ford drink coffee and SMILE after her hearing" POV: YOU are keeping victims of sexual abuse quiet. They think they don't deserve to feel relief or happiness ever again. Dr. Ford should smile; she was brave as hell.
Kavanaugh walks into his home, locks the heavy wooden door, slowly glides to his vanity, and stares at himself in the gold-plated mirror as he rips off his eyelashes, wipes the rouge from his cheeks and says, "Mama, you gotta love me now."
Watching Ted Cruz at this hearing but dreaming of the day - SOON! - when we'll see @BetoORourke represent Texas in Congress.
@KalobPowers Anger, hurt, fear, sadness, regret - I hear all those qualities in his voice, but terror is NOT one of them.
One cool thing about democracy is that sometimes it leads to federal hearings debating the use of the term "brewskies"
Hey men: stop being so SHRILL. That's our thing!
Me when Kavanaugh asked Klobuchar if *she's* the alcoholic https://t.co/JLfPd5vImu
I missed the last hour for a meeting and am so behind that it feels like that time I had strep throat for a week in middle school and I came back and everyone knows fractions, has read To Kill a Mockingbird, and got a bra. #kavanaughhearings
Ray Romano as Kavanaugh on SNL??? Voice bros!
@james___2016 Yo - you don't have to call me an idiot. Uncalled for.
If we don't place Supreme Court nominees under scrutiny, then we aren't doing our job as a nation. 		A sexual assault accusation is not commonplace and it deserves to be taken very, very seriously. 		So Kavanaugh, your emotions, while valid, are no more valid than Dr. Ford's.
So an investigation is "welcome" if it's about stuff he wants to talk about, but "a national disgrace" if a woman alleges sexual assault. Cute, Kavanaugh. #KavanaughHearings
Let me also say that we're all allowed our hot takes and opinions on this, but the people who are actually given a platform to speak at this hearing are ELECTED OFFICIALS. If you want your voice represented, YOU HAVE TO VOTE. Register and learn more at https://t.co/6rqyBS64oW
GoFundMe: Let's start a company to crowd fund cute calligraphy wedding invitation companies!		America: Lolz we need this for staggering health care bills and federal testimonies against sexual assaulters
Let me also clarify this: you can't be a "nice person" but a "bad drunk." Nice people don't get to be nice 90% of the time but then get belligerent &amp; assault-y when they get bourbon in them and still qualify as nice. 		Your moral compass doesn't get a pass when you're drinking.
The most disgusting retort I'm hearing about Dr. Ford's testimony is that she should "grow up."		If honestly, vulnerability, bravery, and responsibility to civic duty isn't the very definition of "growing up," I have no idea what is.
Leahy expressing gratitude for Dr. Ford AND he pronounced Ramirez correctly = seems basic but these are both victories
Imagine this being your audience when talking about your own sexual assault. We need more female representation and we need it NOW. https://t.co/ct0qqR5rzO
Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony has moved beyond an individual sense of duty to a straight up civic duty - and her clarity and honesty with us is a gift. I‚Äôm in tears. About it all. The pain she‚Äôs suffered, the bravery behind her words.
The terror in Ford‚Äôs voice is gut wrenching. If you‚Äôre still questioning her motive, consider why a woman would put herself under this scrutiny if it wasn‚Äôt true.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the INTEGRITY of the institution. Is he the best we can do?‚Äù @SenFeinstein taking me to CHURCH this morning; see y‚Äôall at the free donuts table after mass
‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen to the lady, BUT we‚Äôre going to bring this to a close‚Äù is exactly how women are often treated when we finally do speak up: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen BUT.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen BUT no promises.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen BUT don‚Äôt expect help.‚Äù Why not ‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen AND I‚Äôll help you?‚Äù
Feinstein explaining the horrors and statistics of sexual abuse is EXACTLY why we need female representation in Congress. The Grassleys of the world can fumble Hispanic last names; step aside and let the women lead facts.
Oh hell no, Grassley just fumbled ‚ÄúRamirez‚Äù like a picky child trying to eat around the salsa on a breakfast burrito. Gloves off.
Anyone watching with their kids? (I have no kids but just curious, feel like this is tough but necessary convos for parents to have with their children)
Why is Grassley acting surprised and apologetic about the ‚Äúmedia circus?‚Äù This might be a hot take but this is about confirming a damn Supreme Court Justice; there BETTER be a circus or else what, we‚Äôre just gonna pour some chamomile and call it a life? Vet ANYONE thoroughly.

"Women are so angry" WELL HE GOT THAT RIGHT
I AM BLACKING OUT
what the actual fuck is happening right now
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN ACCUSED HIM OF HARASSMENT. 		THAT IS HOW DISPOSABLE WOMEN ARE TO THIS ADMINISTRATION.
Trump just expressed concern "the reputation of a great gentleman," in case you want to know why I am walking right into my underwater bunker, never to be seen again.
Trump literally just said "these are all false to me" re: the Kavanaugh accusations. "Why did they wait so long?" 		This is a party of cruel misogynists, plain and simple. 		#IBelieveSurvivors #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord #IBelieveDeborahRamirez #IBelieveJulieSwetnick
The prevalent thought has been that women aren't fit to be elected officials because we get emotional, because we‚Äôre mothers who need time off etc, but what are we seeing?		Men incapable of representing their electorates because they‚Äôre busy defending themselves &amp; their cohorts.

I wasn't expecting Flake to completely decry Kavanaugh, but saying that both he and Ford are "unwitting combatants" in this "ugly process" is a slap in the face to Ford + all victims of sexual assault		What part of physically holding down a woman against her will is unwitting?
Serious note: you‚Äôre not alone if you‚Äôre feeling a deep sadness not just for Julie Swetnick but for this culture of abuse/denial that has kept so many women quiet for so long. I have generally felt anger + desire for pro activity, but goddamn. Today is straight up sadness.

I get it - you're trying to be ironic and say "if I didn't care, I wouldn't be here, right?"		There's a difference between BEING PRESENT and SHOWING UP. Melania, you're at the border physically - but you're in a cage emotionally. 		https://t.co/QaqxGhPqCC

We're used to the ire, the discrimination, the dismissive behavior... but in this moment in time, it's really beautiful to see so many recognizing this as an issue that transcends citizenship. #KeepFamiliesTogether - even if they weren't born in America.
One bright spot: as a Mexican-American, it's unbelievably heartwarming to see people of all ethnic &amp; racial backgrounds stepping in and voicing their disapproval of this children at the border crisis. Latinos, we're not alone, and I hope each &amp; every one of us internalizes this.

@bconte813 Great that he's been vulnerable about his mistakes and the repercussions, but I'm more concerned with @adultswim's repeated history of creating environments where harassment is acceptable and continuing to not hire women.
@sethblink I agree with this - we all have to be individual arbiters of what we decide to refrain from watching and why. For me, this offense is unforgivable - and I would hope the network would take every POSSIBLE step to prevent behavior like this again. Incl. hiring more women.
@bconte813 Apologizing is the very least one can do. What is "looking at oneself" and how does that prevent behavior like this from becoming systemic? Also who is the arbiter of which harassers receive multiple chances, and which are ousted permanently after their behavior is revealed?

I promise you there are so many show creators, writers, performers, directors, and executives with brilliant minds and brilliant ideas (yes even ideas that can make your network BANK) that DO NOT SEXUALLY HARASS PEOPLE.
Are we learning nothing from the #MeToo movement? Networks: provide an HR for your staffs. Make space for more female, trans, diverse, and non binary creators. And for the love of god, DO NOT CONTINUE TO REWARD SEXUAL HARASSERS.

I also want to point out that sexual harassment &amp; abuse of women is truly an intersectional issue. No one race or age is immune. The media loves to pit women against each other, but it's encouraging to see us transcending that and standing by these victims right now.
But my second hope, if I'm being real, is that all those powerful male fiends out there of every industry - all those preying on interns, assistants, bosses, colleagues - that they are scared shitless right now. And that they amend their ways &amp; seek help.
My biggest hope right now is that Weinstein's victims - those who have come forward &amp; those who haven't - find some solace in the support of a nation that is truly grieving with them right now.
Not a single woman I know is astonished by this Weinstein case. We're so acclimated to the cult of the patriarchy that our first reaction is "of course he did."

@BEEBALM2010 I love this and believe it so so strongly.
The most powerful gift women have is the option to walk away. That, and multiple orgasms.
There's a reason the phrase "female intuition" exists. Because it's powerful. And it should be loved, honed, and trusted.
And that cycle continues into adulthood, where we feel indebted. Like we owe every man, every job, every administration TIME. NAH. We don't.
I just think young girls are taught that we always have to stick it out. That things will get better. Nah, sometimes you just gotta walk.
My biggest advice to young women, in your career or in romance: TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. And don't be afraid to walk the fuck away.

Other people's illnesses are never going to cease to make me sad. And every step we take towards holding healthcare from others is criminal.
RT @HireMeImFunny: John McCain has the world's most fucked up make-a-wish
This is exactly it. Would that we could ALL see the benefit of good health coverage, like him. But fuck him for supporting this bill. https://t.co/94pZMCy46T
Yes. This would have been the ideal outcome. His lack of empathy for Americans is inexcusable. https://t.co/khZj9WliV0
@2Legs1Crutch No, and that's where I lose respect for him.
@justkelly_ok @igorvolsky I 100% get this POV.
@bechey @igorvolsky Exactly.
@brianscully I 100% understand this perspective.
I firmly believe one can applaud McCain's strength in the face of a major health crisis &amp; also take major offense to what he just voted for.
Congress just voted on something they knew nothing about.

@MyBleedingInk @KonstantineinCA @capetrov My intention is good, in other words, even if my follow-through is short sighted. Working on that! There's no ONE solution.
@MyBleedingInk @KonstantineinCA @capetrov I don't purport to know everything &amp; am very grateful for the feedback. I think my own sadness leads me to try to find reasons for it all.
@MyBleedingInk @KonstantineinCA @capetrov Look, I appreciate all this info &amp; honest talk - I really do. Thank you guys. Clearly we have to continue this dialogue.
@MyBleedingInk @capetrov THIS I agree with completely. We have to change the narrative of what we assume to be the intentions of a shooter based on their race.
@MyBleedingInk @capetrov I think anger that intense coupled with a lack of impulse control/empathy goes far beyond the normal anger spectrum that most of us feel.
@MyBleedingInk @capetrov So you're arguing that anger that compels someone to draw arms against another human qualifies as "simply angry"?
@capetrov @MyBleedingInk I'm in no way demonizing the mentally ill. It's not nefarious to point to the correlation here.
@MyBleedingInk @capetrov None of this is meant to ignore the culpability of the accessibility of guns, by the way...
It saddens me to no end that gun control has become so partisan as to render it virtually unstoppable. But mental health is NOT partisan.
The very least we can do at this point is provide courses in identifying mental illness. Like CPR, it should be widespread &amp; mandatory.

@Lambach There is an urgency. People need to be encouraged to get medical checkups now. I'm not engaging with any argument against this, thanks!
Unreal: Sessions talking about overdose deaths while ignoring the Trumpcare bloodbath that will take away mental healthcare for millions.
@MrNickCharles awesome and THANK YOU for your service, sir!!!
@Lambach Incorrect. The passing of the bill will take time to trickle down to your insurance. Schedule appointments NOW before turnover happens.
Seriously nothing related to #JeffSessions matters. Please go schedule your mammograms &amp; dental exams &amp; therapy sessions now while you can.

It's contingent upon those of us who are healthy &amp; do have healthcare to fight for those who don't, EVERY DAY. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.
For me, the takeaway from Kimmel's speech is that if he, a famous wealthy white male, can struggle w/healthcare, what about the rest of us?
...the reality is that the impact of a famous face sharing their story is HUGE. And I'm so glad Jimmy did it.
In my journey with my healthcare doc, I've interviewed dozens of parents going thru what Kimmel has gone through (&amp; worse), but...
Jimmy Kimmel didn't share his story to be a hero, but that's what he achieved. He's a hero for giving healthcare an emotional, famous face.

And for another hot take... is it possible there's some part of Trump that enjoys Spicer's faux pas as a distraction?
So here's my question: WHY IS GUN CONTROL NOT FRONT &amp; CENTER?
But we have to keep pressing issues - LIFE OR DEATH issues - even when the pulse of temptation is to meme Spicer's ruddy face all day long.
Obviously Spicer is a twat. Obviously his comments are laced with equal parts idiocy, ignorance &amp; lack of empathy.
And yet today, we're so concerned with Dopey Spicer that the conversation of gun control has barely entered the lexicon.

ALSO, in these gray times, to see love &amp; friendship &amp; gratitude &amp; appreciation &amp; hope without cynicism is POETIC. #JoeBiden
It's more socially acceptable for women to say we love our friends, but for male friends, it's often cloaked in jokes. Not with Joe &amp; Barack
I really do love what the Biden/Obama relationship teaches to young men about how dudes can &amp; should express their love for each other.
"As long as there's a breath in me, I'll be there for you." - #JoeBiden to Obama. Oh my god. True masculinity is expressing love like this.
@jordanrweiss GOOD LUCK WITH THATB

@joshgondelman &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I empathize with that teen.
Obama to Russia: "We can do stuff to you"	Sounds like bad sexting from a teen who is totally not even a little bit a virgin dude like no way
I love hearing Obama's dedication to upholding democracy, but lord, it feels like the pillars of integrity are crumbling around us.
"Everybody had the information. It was out there." Obama on Russia's hacking, but this also sums up Trump's election. We had all the info.
Obama holding a mirror up to the media's obsession with WikiLeaks is PURE savage. But yes, Trump's the one who "tells it like it is."
