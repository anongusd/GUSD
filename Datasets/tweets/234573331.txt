.@DrNealDunnFL2: We are experiencing the greatest economy in modern history - w/ record low unemployment. Maintaining the SNAP status quo simply doesn't make sense. We all should want to incentivize the work-capable population to re-enter the work force and lead fulfilling lives.
.@DrNealDunnFL2: I'm very supportive of the House version authorizing funding for the foot and mouth disease bank, feral swine eradication, &amp; market access programs that expand U.S. agriculture exports. #2018FarmBill
.@DrNealDunnFL2 at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: We must maintain what we achieved in the House version to ensure that the farm safety net continues to provide a level of certainty during times of recession &amp; loss. #2018FarmBill
.@RepJeffDenham at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: It is critical for specialty crop growers in CA and around the country that we pass a farm bill that continues USDA‚Äôs funding &amp; accessibility for the Market Access Program, which bolsters visibility &amp; sales for U.S. businesses abroad.

.@KYComer: The House bill takes steps to lift Americans out of poverty through the best assistance plan - a job. The #2018FarmBill emphasizes the importance of getting Americans back to work and provides a path for them to learn valuable job skills through training programs.
.@KYComer at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: As a farmer myself, I know the challenges my fellow farmers and all rural Americans face. I'm proud of the work we have done to craft a bill that builds on the risk management tools like crop insurance. #HouseAg #2018FarmBill
.@RepRickAllen: As we continue to see our economy grow with over 6M available jobs, H.R. 2 provides #SNAP recipients with opportunities to prepare for gainful employment through education/training an opportunity that should be available to all Americans. #2018FarmBill
.@RepRickAllen at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: I continue to hear that Congress must take action to address the economic hardships that have devastated rural America &amp; our farming communities. Our farmers need a strong safety net and the certainty that a 5-year farm bill provides.
The House approach provides a historic investment in job training. A new skillset or degree can be life-changing. We owe it to the people SNAP serves to be bold and improve these outcomes. #2018FarmBill
.@RogerMarshallMD: I'm proud of the nutrition provisions the House put forward. When you have a program that has added 9 million participants since the height of the great recession, it's clear that something isn't working.

.@RepTedYoho: Negotiating this legislation and delivering certainty for our nation's farmers and ranchers is my top priority. #2018FarmBill
.@RepTedYoho at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: With our strong economy, there are more jobs available than people to fill them. It is imperative that we take this opportunity to encourage work through legislation. The best tool to fight poverty is a job. It's as simple as that. #SNAP
.@RodneyDavis: There are 6.6M open jobs in the US &amp; small business optimism is its highest in 35 years. If not now, when? When do we make these critical investments in our workforce to fill these jobs &amp; help end the cycle of poverty for millions of Americans? This is good policy.
.@RodneyDavis at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: One major component, that impacts 80% of the farm bill, is the House's common-sense approach to modernizing #SNAP. The House makes substantial investments in workforce training and will help individuals receiving SNAP find employment.
RT @RepRickCrawford: A nation that cannot feed itself is a nation at risk. We need to continue to protect our abundant food supply. #FarmBi‚Ä¶
.@RepHartzler: We cannot miss out on the opportunity to take a positive step forward to break the cycle of poverty. Work-capable individuals should be empowered to access work through career training programs so they can live out their full potential &amp; fill 6.7M open jobs in U.S.
.@RepHartzler: The number one economic development across the nation is access to rural broadband, and we can all agree this farm bill needs to improve access and reliability to high speed internet for every American. #2018FarmBill
.@RepHartzler at Farm Bill Conference Cmte: The #2018FarmBill needs to provide long term certainty for farmers by maintaining a strong safety net &amp; crop insurance programs, full funding for the FMD vaccine, &amp; common sense reforms to our conservation like rolling CSP into EQIP.

.@AustinScottGA08: This is our opportunity to provide the needed certainty and support to our farmers and provide commonsense reforms that will support the president's agenda of achieving prosperity for all Americans. #2018FarmBill
.@AustinScottGA08: Giving #SNAP recipients access to knowledge/skills necessary to maintain employment and rise above their current situation will help meet the intended goal of temporary assistance--helping those they serve onto a path of self-sufficiency and earned success.
.@AustinScottGA08: Currently, #SNAP recipients are stuck between a rock and a hard place. The legislation drafted in the House includes commonsense changes to the existing policy which offers a true pathway off the program. #2018FarmBill
.@AustinScottGA08 at #FarmBill Conference Cmte: Without the certainty of a farm bill in place, it becomes very difficult to plan for the upcoming growing season. The hard-working men &amp; women who put food on the table for Americans, and the world, deserve a level of certainty.
.@RepMikeRogersAL at #FarmBill Conference Cmte meeting: Like majority of Americans, my constituents support strong work requirements for #SNAP recipients. Today's booming economy is the perfect time to provide opportunities for people to get into the workforce. #2018FarmBill
.@CongressmanGT: An expectation of work ‚Äì when paired with funding, service &amp; supports ‚Äì just makes sense. It is time to evolve #SNAP so we can serve Americans in the most impactful way;  that includes a strong work requirement, paired with meaningful job training opportunities.
.@CongressmanGT: We currently have an unemployment rate of 4%, and over 6 million jobs available.  Let‚Äôs provide this work-capable population new opportunities by enforcing the expectation &amp; dignity of work, while modernizing the supports to find employment. #2018FarmBill
.@CongressmanGT: Without question, #SNAP remains incredibly important for many Americans; yet ultimate food security only comes from sustaining job. We have a tremendous, even historic, opportunity to provide beneficiaries the tools &amp; skills needed to thrive in a booming economy.
.@CongressmanGT: H.R.2 also builds on the current #farmbill by streamlining processes and making programs easier to navigate. This includes merging CSP into EQIP, which I believe will help make EQIP and its administration simpler and more effective. #2018FarmBill
.@CongressmanGT: I strongly support the conservation title contained in H.R.2 It‚Äôs important that we continue to provide these important dollars for conservation purposes, targeting them directly toward farmers, ranchers and landowners. #2018FarmBill
.@CongressmanGT: H.R. 2 does much for commodities, but I‚Äôd like to mention my strong support for the dairy provisions in the bill. Dairy producers continue to struggle &amp; I am pleased that the House and Senate farm bills build on the assistance provided earlier this year.

.@giancarloCFTC: The US cannot be complacent about the historical primacy of our derivatives markets. Our best response for US commodity market participants, &amp; for global markets, is to ensure that US derivatives markets are unrivaled int heir openness, orderliness and liquidity.
.@giancarloCFTC: American derivatives markets are the world's largest, most developed, and most influential. They are also the world's best regulated. The @cftc has overseen the U.S. exchange-traded derivates markets for over 40 years. #HouseAg
.@giancarloCFTC: I believe the CFTC is an agency upon which the American people can look with satisfaction in terms of taxpayer value, effective oversight of US markets and mature development of public policy amidst the	rapid pace of change of 21st century financial markets.
.@giancarloCFTC: I am pleased to report that the agency is on sound footing in meeting its statutory mission. @CFTC #HouseAg
The committee expects @giancarloCFTC to continue to refine your rules, to oversee financial markets and to tackle new challenges coming--all of which require resources. I have not given up reauthorizing the @CFTC, but we cannot hold the agency hostage to Senate's inaction.
.@ConawayTX11: I made a pledge to reauthorize all the lapsed programs under our jurisdiction. We have passed legislation through the House, but the Senate has failed to act. @CFTC remains unauthorized, but the commission &amp; its responsibilities have not stood still. @giancarloCFTC
.@ConawayTX11: I appreciate the clear framing of your concerns and sensible suggestions you‚Äôve made to solve real problems, while still supporting the overarching goals of Title VII. @giancarloCFTC #HouseAg

.@AmberBaldet: There is no technical reason we cannot have both	centralized (FedCoin-like) and decentralized (Bitcoin-like) digital assets in circulation, to provide consumer choice and allow risk diversification. #HouseAg
.@AmberBaldet: Stakeholders are in near unanimous agreement when it comes to cryptographically unique digital bearer assets, the genie is out of the bottle. As science fiction author William Gibson said,‚ÄúThe future is already here, it‚Äôs just not very evenly distributed.‚Äù #HouseAg
.@AmberBaldet: The revolutionary proposition of cryptocurrency or more broadly, cryptoassets - is the ability to send something you own across the Internet and then irrefutably not have it anymore, without relying	on a third party to intermediate or otherwise witness the event.
.@JoshFairfield: A token should be deemed a security when it operates like a security, a commodity when it operates as a commodity, a currency when it operates as a currency, and a simple property interest when it operates as a simple property interest. #HouseAg
.@JoshFairfield: Blockchain technology has enabled new communities and new business forms. It has also provided the technological basis for a badly needed expansion of personal property rights online. #HouseAg
.@JoshFairfield: Working out jurisdiction over actions or business models that cross several different regulatory boundaries will be time-consuming, but no harder for blockchains than they were for network communications technology generally. #HouseAg
.@JoshFairfield: Already, cryptocurrency tokens are appearing in court decisions on inheritance, wills and trusts, and other routine treatment of personal property under the common law. It may soon become as routine to own digital tokens as it is to own dollars in a bank account.
.@JoshFairfield: Good property rules contribute to human thriving, or as Nobel	Laureate Amartya Sen expressed it, good property rules expand the range of human capabilities. Thus, good property rules are those that expand what people can do. #HouseAg
.@JoshFairfield: Technology underlying the current rash of cryptocurrencies, is a relatively new database technology that permits communities to self-organize and build trustworthy decentralized databases. #HouseAg
.@ConawayTX11: As we consider changes to the law or new regulations, #HouseAg will be a part of the conversation. We have a vested interest in the definition of a security, because it directly impacts the definition of a commodity.
.@ConawayTX11: Providing clear guidance to enable developers to determine the nature of their token and then suitable rules to enable them to develop their project, is essential to both protecting the public and promoting innovation. #HouseAg
.@ConawayTX11: Providing a strong, clear legal and regulatory framework for digital assets is essential. #HouseAg
.@ConawayTX11: For the first time, we have a tool that enables individuals to reliably exchange value in the digital realm, without an intermediary. The promise of being able to secure property rights in a digital space may fundamentally change how ppl interact with one another.
.@ConawayTX11 at #HouseAg hearing on cryptocurrencies: Digital assets like #Bitcoin and Ether, but also like hundreds of other token-based projects that are being developed, represent a new way for people to interact and engage in commerce with one another.

.@FloridaTomatoes: True to forecast, most of the growth in Mexico's ag shipments to the U.S. has been in the fresh fruit &amp; vegetable sector.
.@FloridaTomatoes: Even before #NAFTA entered into force negotiators forecasted it could negatively affect FL &amp; other specialty crop regions
.@FloridaTomatoes: Unfortunately, the current trade environment under #NAFTA has not fared as well for many US fruit &amp; vegetable producers.
.@FloridaTomatoes: US specialty crop producers grow the highest quality ag commodities globally &amp; can compete in a fair market environment.
Hammer (NOPA): Thanks to trade agreements with our North American partners, U.S. soy exports have grown significantly over the past 23 years
Hammer (NOPA): #NAFTA has played a significant role in boosting incomes for millions of U.S. farmers, ranchers and allied manufacturers.
Hammer (NOPA): The U.S. food and agriculture sector is heavily dependent on our current level of access to Mexico and Canada.
Hammer (NOPA): Since the #NAFTA agreement was enacted, U.S. food &amp; agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have more than quadrupled.
.@USCG: The proposed executive order to withdraw from #NAFTA prompted MEX to look to Brazil for alternative sources of corn &amp; grain products

.@BeefUSA: Duty-free access, close proximity &amp; our transportation system contribute to why Canada &amp; Mexico are strong markets for U.S. beef.
.@BeefUSA: Without question, #NAFTA has given U.S. beef a strong advantage over other countries in competition for North American consumers.
.@BeefUSA: We've seen significant growth in U.S. beef exports over the past 7 years due to free trade agreements &amp; lifting restrictions.
.@USDairyExporter: The US dairy industry is united in its desire to preserve what's working under #NAFTA w/ MEX &amp; address what's not w/ CAN.
.@USDairyExporter: Canada unfortunately has created a dairy trade relationship with the U.S. that can best be described as heavily strained.
