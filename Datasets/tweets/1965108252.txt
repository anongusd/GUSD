@StetsonCEdwards @mlbtraderumors You would compare Warren to any of those guys and those guys are all asking a 100 million or more. Warren will be lucky if he gets 3 million a year
@StetsonCEdwards @mlbtraderumors If he was any good he wouldn't have been traded 3 times now and twice for the Yankees. If he was good someone would have signed him already. It's not like he's asking 300 million. You can get him on a minor league deal and nobody signed him. Garbage.
@dodgers_randi I don't know about Harper going 2 Philadelphia because every player I spoke 2 does not like playing in Philadelphia in front of their fans. One year I was at a game and they were throwing trash at Santa Claus. It's not just the Phillies it's all teams in Philadelphia.They're nuts

@dodgers_randi The good thing is now that you're getting their back of their rotation and you're getting it at home the next 3 games. Sale is there only one legit starter. Price was lucky tonight the Dodgers bats were off. Roberts needs to get his head out of his ass.
@dodgers_randi This is Robert should know he play there. At least he stole the base there once.
@dodgers_randi I've seen 10 different teams play at Fenway this year and for some reason the Dodgers are playing deeper than all 10 different teams I've seen play at Fenway maybe that's why these bloop single are dropping in. Outfielder are playing too deep.

@Acosta He must have said that to you Jim. I love it.
@RepMikeQuigley There is another Illinois politician worried about illegals instead of Illinois where he was elected in the office. How about the homeless in Illinois and especially the veterans that are homeless. Stop worrying about illegals and worried about the homeless in Illinois you bum

@dodgers_randi You're right when I was watching the game and they showed the crowd it was in the first inning then when I turn the game back on they showed the upper deck then it was filled up. I guess people are late arrivals in LA.

@Acosta There's a reason why @CNN  sucks is because idiots like you don't report everything and don't report the truth. It sounds like Jimmy didn't get his way again.
@Acosta Maybe if you and your network would actually tell the truth on TV and Report the real news that's going on daily and stop lying to the people they wouldn't act like this. This is why people chant CNN sucks is because you lie and you're so negative every single day towards Trump

@DonaldJeffery1 @SenatorDurbin He's too worried about illegal citizens then its own citizens in the state of Illinois and that it goes along with Tammy Duckworth. These two have to go they put a legal citizens in front of their own citizens in this state. The people have to wake up and vote them out.
@SenatorDurbin How come you're always willing 2 help the illegals coming across the border into United States but you're not willing to help the homeless and especially the homeless veterans in the state of Illinois? The people in Illinois vote 4 you not these illegals coming across the border.
@SenatorDurbin Obama knew about the hacking in 2016 and didn't do anything about it. He didn't do anything about it because he thought HRC the Democrat was going to win . But she didn't America President Trump made America great again and we're going to stick with President Trump in 2020.
No thanks to @BarackObama the way he ran his country into the ground. He has no shame the way he's living his lifestyle right now off of the citizens of this country.
