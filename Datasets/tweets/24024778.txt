@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Are you shitting me? Jeez.
@clairecmc Lots of good comments on this one. Yes we all know it’s procedural etc. etc. We also know how pressure sometimes works in the beltway; especially when our allies are presented with false, fabricated choices like DACA vs CHIP.
@d_mccarthy37 @clairecmc my friend, don’t forget how pressure works either
When I was working at the White House, I remember what a big deal it was that @clairecmc did the right thing &amp; voted for the DREAM Act. Quite disappointing to see her throw those same American kids under the bus with her CR vote last night.
@SenDougJones your first big vote and you’re throwing DACA kids under the bus. Pretty disappointing, sir.

@TuckerCarlson These @NEAarts partner programs help a whole lot of smart, deserving young people who should have a fair shot. Come visit
@TuckerCarlson For you to suggest that our students from these rural &amp; inner city schools are somehow on rich welfare is disgusting @NEAarts
@TuckerCarlson We also have @NEAarts partnered education programs in schools in "elite" rural Montana, Louisiana, Wisconsin, &amp; North Dakota
@TuckerCarlson My students are as deserving of a wonderful education as any child of a wealthy person who is about to enjoy a tax break
@TuckerCarlson Creative thinkers are often the difference between engineering &amp; innovation.We need innovators to compete in a global economy
@TuckerCarlson These programs have used Arts to successfully raise math &amp; reading achievements, student engagement, and creative thinking.
@TuckerCarlson @TurnaroundArts @NEAarts we outperformed comparable schools that received federal funds for improvement (“SIG schools”). https://t.co/7C8laHmHo5
