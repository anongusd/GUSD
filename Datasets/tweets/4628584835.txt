@basspankai The whole thing is kind of confused &amp; I assume it is because no one seems willing to have a real political discussion. It has to get personal like this to avoid any actual political detail.
I'm slightly confused by the rage that MSM reported things leaked by Klobuchar's former staff. You either report it or you don't. Wouldn't it be extremely odd not to report it? Maybe it can be put into context in some way--but any journalist is going to report this.
@roadtoserfdumb @briebriejoy Some other good points made by @briebriejoy (going from memory) are (1) extreme inequality is harmful to everyone (2) poverty is always bad &amp; (3) focussing on class is extremely politically effective. What good reason can there be to resist focus on class?
@roadtoserfdumb @briebriejoy There's no point in this comparison. Sometimes race does a person in. Sometimes class. The combo is deadly. Salient point is that w/out attention to class, people most harmed by racism will stay in the same place--and focusing on race alone can blind people to this.
@roadtoserfdumb @briebriejoy No, it's simply a mistake to compare these things. In some cases, being a middle class black person is better than being a poor white person. In other cases, it's not. There is no way to really compare these things.

That the Rainbow Coalition is mostly forgotten shows how easy it is to slip from a radical idea to the status quo. https://t.co/A6Jg6GOkEf

Research on the first Rainbow Coalition (started by the Black Panthers &amp; I guess Fred Hampton was involved) kind of blows the mind. It was a multi-racial coalition started by the Panthers. https://t.co/23BfUpZX3m
I go on and on about Jackson's Rainbow Coalition--but his platform is still so wise &amp; prescient &amp; necessary. And I still wonder what happened. Why did no one take up the torch? Jackson was on point about everything--including LGBT issues.
@ashrelliott We did not hear our politicians speaking these words. People felt very powerless because there were no political figures who would openly question certain basic injustices &amp; absurdities in our system--that the majority already knew existed. Only Jesse Jackson in '84 spoke out.
@ashrelliott You may be unaware that a lot of people already agreed with Bernie Sanders. For years, many people have been saying 'why are we spending all this money on the military? Why these wars? How can we have a housing crisis &amp; a medical care crisis in the richest country in the world?

@OmanReagan We have a very degraded political climate. This makes so many better things way harder than they should be. Not everyone is saying 'here are our ideal plans.' Sometimes they are saying 'here are our feasible plans that are essential for future survival.'
@OmanReagan Yes, I am oversimplifying horribly. I mean *necessarily tell us.*  Lots of ways of linking race to class are red herrings...a crude Marxist analysis is ridonkulous. But it still makes sense to say that we should alleviate poverty caused by racism using universal programs.
@dolladollabille @onekade Sure. I guess it's one of those things where I'm older &amp; all we heard in the years leading up to mass incarceration were gripes about how criminals get off, etc. A dangerous narrative. It is galling though to see the difference in acquittals when someone can really pay big bucks.
@onekade @dolladollabille The power is usually on the side of the prosecution. But you are correct that what should be happening is the indigent accused are getting adequate criminal defense--sometimes they are not--because the state won't pay for it.
@onekade @dolladollabille True. I don't feel so good griping about someone horrible paying up the nose for a stellar legal defense though. We need good criminal defense lawyers. They gotta get money from somewhere.
@OmanReagan I think everyone is confusing (1) the theoretical question about the relation between race &amp; class and (2) what policies to pursue, what laws to make, how to position a movement to end racism &amp; skyrocketing economic inequality. (1) doesn't necessarily tell us what to do about (2)

@bianconeri541 @nhannahjones That's all true but...is it relevant in electoral politics where you're mostly trying to change the government &amp; what it does? Who do we think Sanders is going to put in key posts? It's going to be many activists of color and he doesn't GAF about making industries happy.
@bianconeri541 @nhannahjones You create a political mandate for programs by universalizing them. But at the same time, you have to attack specific types of racial injustice, e.g., in the criminal justice system. Sanders has a strong history of advocating for both.
@bianconeri541 @nhannahjones No. Not color blind. It's not the main reason. The main reason is to end poverty. But realistic about the ideology.

@Daphne_488 @yungneocon Here's another book with the same basic idea. https://t.co/5SdfbBba37
@Daphne_488 I like this book because it basically says 'experiment with many things, and see what helps you.' This is a strategy that worked for me. https://t.co/cWWasA8Bnt
@Daphne_488 The reason adaptogens help (I think) is that they reduce my response to stress. If you can reduce the reaction of your brain to stress, you can sometimes blunt the effects of trauma in your life. It's weird to think that staying calm fixes your brain--but it actually can for some
@Daphne_488 I also take adaptogens like rhodiola &amp; ashwaghanda. For me, these work far better than any antidepressant or anti-anxiety pill. I personally am terrified of anti-anxiety pills like xanax. They made my problems WAY worse.
@Daphne_488 Everyone is different. I was told I had various 'anxiety/depressive disorders.' But I always wondered 'why is it that if I'm in a beautiful place, with no stress...I become instantly normal? Why does STRESS cause 95% of my problems?' Nature helps me a LOT.
@Daphne_488 I like 'insight timer'...There are a couple of self-meditation go to sleep recordings on there that really work to relax. And they are FREE. It is something you have to do over time. Therapy can be good if the therapist is helping you to get a sense of safety. Your brain can heal
@Daphne_488 Focusing on relaxation sounds so fluffy &amp; unserious. But with trauma, it isn't. It's KEY to healing. There are meditation apps with meditation recordings, self-hypnosis recordings, etc. They really help! Also, sleep (which I'm unable to do like a normal person) can also help!
@Daphne_488 This article also says that anti-depressant use can be good for neurogenesis (regrowing brain cells). The biggest enemy for that can be chronic stress. You may notice that stressful incidents make you more reactive, which exacerbates the trauma.
@Daphne_488 Sometimes there's just one incident causing PTSD. Some people have chronic trauma (e.g., abusive relationship). Some people have complex trauma, which is from ongoing harms in childhood...These cause different problems. ALL can be ameliorated, and sometimes resolved.
@Daphne_488 That's just a metaphor I was using. But here's a scientific article about it. There are so many different factors--e.g., what age one was traumatized, how long it lasted, etc.  https://t.co/eMdDIboeet

@Daphne_488 @yungneocon EMDR works! Or it did for me. It's strange but it removes emotional charge of the memories. But another (cheaper) thing to do is to talk &amp; walk. It doesn't work as well but this is also an odd mind-body effect thing. Even jumping on a trampoline has effects. Helps to experiment.
@Daphne_488 @yungneocon A good book is 'The Body Keeps the Score.' It's a little all over the place. E.g., trauma is *partly* a mind-body thing. So sometimes you have to try many things--exercise, yoga, deep breathing, hot baths, biofeedback...but a key thing is to get the reactive brain to settle down.

@curaffairs I think you might be the very best outlet to do a story on possible social media strategies that will manipulate leftists in dangerous ways. But it's not your usual wheelhouse. Nevertheless @NathanJRobinson you are very smart &amp; can figure it out.
I'm lumping a lot of different problems together here. But the way the social media f***ery works is super subtle.
Many, many things are going to go wrong via social media for Sanders supporters. But it's very hard to warn them. For one thing, they tend to get attached to some bad actors who are pretending to be leftists.
(b) be whipped up into a frenzy (c) become so deeply resentful they refuse to vote in the general election (d) attack other essential planks of the left under the guise of identity politics (which they're manipulated to hate)
Sanders support is a main target. But who is targeting? It's very hazy. There are many interested parties. I think Sanders supporters see themselves as can't-be-manipulated--which why it's easy to be manipulate to (a) attack other Democrats &amp; feed the Bernie bro narrative
Does anyone care that the same thing is happening again? Sanders supporters barely noticed that there were many big accounts switching to Trump after the election. They don't even see the wolves in their midst. Now there are fake Dem Socialists on FB bashing @IlhanMN.
OK, there are already FB groups I didn't follow that pretend to be @SenSanders groups...but aren't. There are also Twitter accounts stirring crap up that are obviously not pro-Sanders but pretend to be. Social media f***ery is all over the place already.
This FB group is masking itself as Democratic Socialist but I AM SUSPICIOUS. https://t.co/ojjLPbSvuB
@LukeRussell1281 @gcramer30 @thomaskaine5 One reason is that they don't get votes PURELY through racism. Both parties offer a package deal &amp; there are racially oppressed people who see both parties are racist but they'll pick the GOP package deal b/c of some fantasy reason they've gotten attached to.
@LukeRussell1281 @gcramer30 @thomaskaine5 It's just not quite so simple is all I'm saying. But these outliers aren't so significant--the party is now dedicated to white supremacy explicitly and their overall base is primarily racist. But I don't think we should completely lose sight of the complexity.
@LukeRussell1281 @gcramer30 @thomaskaine5 I'm not excusing it by any means but there are quite a few people who don't have big theories about the world. They don't read the news or watch it much. Their concerns are more day-to-day. They vote the way the people around them vote.
@LukeRussell1281 @gcramer30 @thomaskaine5 The party. But the people who vote? It's more complicated. I actually know several people of color who voted for Trump--at least one out of fear of losing her job to immigrants. (She seems to regret it now...but working class people have a lot of anxiety about this.)

@yungneocon It sucks but a good thing is that if trauma is your problem &amp; you realize it--you may find one reason you haven't progressed is that most of the things people do for depression &amp; anxiety don't work for trauma (like SSRIs, etc.)--but you can make a lot of progress other ways.
@yungneocon Yes. I found out way too late that a lot of my problems are from trauma. I wonder how many people this is true of, and they don't know enough about trauma to figure it out. There are a bunch of non-drug things you can do even for complex trauma.
@gcramer30 @thomaskaine5 I've known some who aren't any more racist than most white people. And I've known some who weren't white (and they also did not seem particularly racist to me). There are a lot of reasons people are Republican--though I doubt any of these people would support Trump, to be honest.

@Realjameswills1 @JCasman09 @collisindc @onehugman @JonBlumenthal @AOC Look at the science. This is not a political opinion. The economics also supports these ideas. Ask the scientists. It's not some Democrat plot. At bottom, it is physics.
@Realjameswills1 @JCasman09 @collisindc @onehugman @JonBlumenthal @AOC It's not relevant to anything.

@FHamster28 @MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC Except I hear really amazing things from some people...It may depend on the disease. I don't feel 'cared for' very much within our system. Doctors are always leaving, tired of the bureaucracy. I've had 4 doctors in 5 years.

@MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC Govt. is not a main reason for healthcare costs. I'm guessing you're a libertarian so you don't want any coordination, laws or rules on healthcare. The libertarian idea is let people be harmed &amp; punish the harm. But if you know harm is going to occur, why not prevent the harm?
@MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC The money that is paid to the military is not primarily due to regulations. But the question is--what is the evidence the government can never do anything well? Our military is deeply interwoven with the government &amp; you do trust the military.
@MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC I'm sure you know that when governments have single payer, citizens' health improves, and they are no longer bankrupted by medical costs? Life expectancy is also closely correlated with this. It's hard to believe the US is such an outlier that it could never work here.
@Realjameswills1 @onehugman @JCasman09 @JonBlumenthal @AOC The Clean Air Act was passed (under Nixon) before the climate change issue was well-understood. With renewable energy, we can meet our energy needs HERE in AMERICA. It would keep money for jobs here--not spend it on foreign oil.

@MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC Conservatives have such confidence in our military--but it is a government entity. #MedicareForAll also doesn't have the govt running the health system--only the insurance system. My insurer is a disaster--makes mistakes, refuses coverage when it is allowed. Most are, actually.
@MrBeardedTruth @joseph_dunlap @QuidRises @TheFeltyPerro @AOC Right now, American health care is in a disastrous state. We pay at least 2x per capita more than any other country.

It's up to US to grasp what it truly means to think of yourself &amp; others as truly equal--of everyone as equal--and to get through to other people what it means for politics. This is a long term project w/ no end point.
People understand on certain levels that what is happening to them is wrong--but on another level, they've been programmed to wonder if they deserve it. Breaking through to that dispirited place would transform our culture. Many more things are possible after that.
People are very beaten down. The one thing Sanders does is make them realize they are beaten down &amp; their problem is injustice. This is what makes him a problem. But to make these changes requires convincing a much larger group of people.
I doubt even the most ardent conservative would have guessed we'd be where we are now--which is so many people completely content with dramatic inequality, no bargaining power over their labor, doubting if they deserve public higher education.
Many people currently do not resist the idea many Americans must suffer so the flow of wealth is not disrupted--but these attitudes used to be quite different even 30 years ago. The sea change started in the 80s w/ Reagan.
He also mentioned this in the Town Hall--we aren't currently respecting the fundamental value of individuals, or fully acknowledging the civic and human rights of all citizens.
Sanders says as much himself. The change needed can only come with a social revolution (in thinking--not a violent overthrow). This is absolutely correct. Anyone who is older will see that the ideas in our society about individual worth have devolved.
Sanders cannot do much about our system. Sanders cannot and will not reform or overthrow anyone. So calm down, everyone. The main difference between Sanders &amp; the other candidates is he clearly sees what the problems are. But our system makes many of them insoluble.

@thefayth @steveinmerida @Delo_Taylor @Russian_Starr I think you have a point. It's a very difficult problem. But sometimes you have to wonder--why is the situation always such that it is so difficult? Sometimes it feels like a set up, you know? People go silent &amp; think that this is the better path. But is it?
@ak_reed1012 @chick_in_kiev @newrepublic It's great to remember the Japan hysteria. Shows you a lot about hysteria. The Reagan years were a major cause for our current situation. Reagan took the solar panels off the white house. The backlash to environmentalism started then as well.

@ajoeltaylor I bought her vape pens. She wouldn't use them. She has OCD so it's harder for her to change. (That's just my guess about how her brain works.) My family is too hard on her. She's an AMAZING &amp; KIND woman with some self-destructive issues &amp; they focus too much on these issues.
@viv_kaul @EdwardGauthie20 @fig_latin @briebriejoy To actually 'pay reparations' don't you need a huge amount of money? (That would be justice--anything less than a huge amount is not.) Anything else is simply symbolic &amp; then a later cudgel for racists.
@viv_kaul @EdwardGauthie20 @fig_latin @briebriejoy Would it be enough? One reason for being worried about this proposal right now in this neoliberal age is that it could be a pittance then later used to uphold ideology about how 'oh, we paid reparations! And everything isn't fixed!' Thats if they could even get it off the ground.

@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome Clinton campaign put out (1) Jeremiah Wright's speeches (2) the Bill Ayers friendship (3) This photo of Obama as a youth (to imply he's a Muslim). Someone has been through Sanders' trash &amp; more by now. Now they're trying to get him on plane trips he took FOR THEM. Ha ha ha ha.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome The campaigns hire investigators to comb through every possible thing on rival candidates. (My guess is Bernie's doesn't...He doesn't need to, since the pt is to distinguish yourself from someone very like you.) Clinton did this w/ Obama. Then they LEAK it to the press.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome This raises a really interesting question...How DO they motivate the attack journalists? They probably just say 'go out &amp; find some dirt on X person.' Realize though that Clinton paid an actual spy outfit to look at Trump. So they ALREADY have investigators on Sanders for sure.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome My point is the motivation is already there...but clearly they do put out hit reporters on left politicians. Look at AOC. They probably go through her trash.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome It probably doesn't have to be that direct. They hire people who cannot conceptualize of issues outside their class framework. And any journalist is rewarded for a 'scoop' story.
'You made me do it!' blame is always absurd but it's also very interesting--because people do it when they want to avoid personal responsibility.
I'm trying to think of an analogy. But basically, if you think of human beings as free agents, you cannot blame one human being for the wrong actions done freely &amp; without interference by others. That's absurd.
No matter what happens, they'll blame Sanders for Trump's win (if he wins). If a third party spoiler comes in &amp; destroys the world by making Trump win, they'll blame Bernie. Some people have lost the ability to understand causality or responsibility when it comes to Bernie.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome I think your statement is true in a sense but the relationship is not as tight as with the GOP &amp; Fox. They are essentially an arm of the establishment but are genuinely more self-deceived about it. I think it's real that they don't think they are &amp; try not to be (but not hard).
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome I think that might be painting with a broad brush though. They all have similar class interests.
@DeKbball @PatrickTheGray @TM16297 @KFILE Sanders did not cause Clinton's prior unpopularity. He didn't force the newspapers to write story after story about that email thing that he refused to raise as an issue (but which Comey turned into a disaster anyway).
@DeKbball @PatrickTheGray @TM16297 @KFILE Sanders motivated voters who ordinarily don't vote. He brought new people into the process.

It was a strange realization that the softness &amp; size I admired as a child is supposed to be a bad thing. She just radiated personal power.
@chick_in_kiev There are places in the US where it seems less of a big deal. New York City is definitely not one of those places.  LA &amp; NYC seem to have a more rigid culture than other regions when it comes to physical appearance.
@JawMadison This is disturbing to you? Access to birth control pills &amp; subsidized vasectomy? All they do is (1) make it cheap (2) advertise on the radio. People do not want large families in Mexico anymore. So they have fewer babies. It's called a public health program. It helps women.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome If we engage on social media with these paid trolls, we're merely going to be helping the Brock-like efforts. It's going to be very difficult because Sanders' campaign is always held to a much higher standard. And money interests are very afraid of him (of us, actually).
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome The gauntlet is also the media, money &amp; a way of thinking. Sanders does not employ the dirty tricks that Brock used. My guess is that private entities will jump in &amp; use the same social media methods Trump used (which Clinton also used at times). They'll do everything they can.

@BoundlessSouls @Taxiof2 @AOC This is not the area of the country that needs this revenue. And it's still out there--some other region will get the money. Amazon has hurt small business more than any other company.
@bluntedpurpose @nataliesurely Basically, we have a situation where Sanders or Sanders supporters can do nothing right. Now he's close to the front. So it's going to get much worse. Their bright idea is to repeat the debacle of 2016.
@JawMadison @BhamDSA It appears the best ways to lower birth rates are (1) Focus on education (esp. of girls) (2) Blanket the country with free or cheap contraception. (3) Food security for the poorest. If you have birth control for next to nothing at the local market, the birth rate declines.
@BrianStawowy @JawMadison @BhamDSA LOL. No but I suppose in a parallel universe all those babies exist. Rather, it's educate girls plus birth control pills (also male vasectomy). Mexico is the poster child for reducing the birth rate via this method.

@chrismurphyusa I did not get to laugh about it. I was actually shuddering about it. The dental care was low quality.
@EdCara4 @andrewperezdc @nataliesurely They actually paid trolls...as far as I know, Sanders didn't pay trolls.
@gcramer30 @nataliesurely @BarbaraLNewsome They actually lose their minds often. I think they are way more upset generally than we are. They can't let 2016 go. We're more focussed on the future.
@bluntedpurpose @nataliesurely It is utter nonsense. But it's now sort of a corner we're backed into...and I think it's real.
@nataliesurely It's sort of a fascinating game where you get backed into a corner &amp; must keep quiet. And everyone else gets to talk. But in response to an actual issue--some ugliness is politically damaging. Sanders supporters face much more scrutiny, and so really do have to be more respectful

@BoundlessSouls @Taxiof2 @AOC The Queens residents aren't going to get the vast majority of those jobs. You have to look at Seattle. Honestly.

@burevestnik3 I say it's bullshit but I'm actually sort of doing it...It's this magical thinking but I'm also afraid. I think one of the centrists will definitely win &amp; I know that Trump is probably going to be very hard to beat in 2020. But the pledge is all BS propaganda &amp; magical thinking.
@holymtnbike @Trillburne Actually, no! She doesn't seem good. I just think it's speculative. In fact, it's actually possible for a politically noxious person to be a great boss. There are probably Republican a**holes who are really good to their staff. It's one of those weird things.
@burevestnik3 I'm not speaking to what centrists will do. In fact, this problem with third parties exists no matter who runs. It's our biggest hazard. Racists will vote for a white guy. Lefties will vote for a Green. My point is that the 'pledge' is bullshit.
@holymtnbike @Trillburne Not necessarily! There are a lot of ways bosses get power. E.g., she could be someone who gets others to want to curry favor with her. There are a lot of boss styles &amp; Klobuchar is the 'lashes out' kind. (Not saying Harris is a good boss but she seems to inspire some loyalty.)

@Dartger Thank you! This looks pretty delicious!
@FiefsintheNight @CoreyRobin Definitely. Have to distinguish b/t public sentiment and political culture. Political culture depends on incrementalism--not only because of neoliberalism but because it is always rewarded, whereas boldness &amp; failure or asking something of the public is usually punished.
@lakesideliberal I don't quite get what you're referring to.
@CoreyRobin It's quite easy to believe &amp; disbelieve at the same time--though hard to explain how we do that. Compartmentalization is required to function daily. E.g., we know we're going to die. We cannot think about this in real terms until it's right in our face.
@CoreyRobin Multifactoral 1) It's a form of denial/self-deception. In this case, it is a version of climate change denial. 2) It's a manipulation of people's desire for firm ground--which is the status quo. 3) It relies on poverty of imagination about a radically different world/rapid change

@IronDiesel58 @AOC That's not what happened in Seattle. Amazon's arrival was followed by a massive homelessness crisis. It's not affordable to live there anymore. The people getting the best jobs come from elsewhere. They should go to the places without jobs, where housing prices have bottomed out.
@Taxiof2 @AOC They should. They could go somewhere that isn't booming economically, and then housing could be built. In the area they were going, rents would go up astronomically &amp; force out many.  Going to Jacksonville or someplace like that could be an actual benefit to the people there.
@icestorm75 @AOC You do know that she didn't FORCE Amazon to leave? She mainly raised pointed questions about whether people in her district would benefit &amp; they FLED. The people that live there were going to see their rent quadruple &amp; most wouldn't get the jobs on offer.
@lindsayh12 @SureFireSearle @jjainschigg @Toxitaro @AOC I like the part where 'she forced Amazon out' when all she did was raise questions about what Amazon planned to do. Then they fled. (Or rather, did a corporate strike.) What's that tell you?

@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders It's just good to know these things when you are thinking 'what the HELL is going on? Why do people elect these freaks?' It is because the VOTERS are OLD WHITE PEOPLE pretty much. If we can change that, the country will move far to the left in a decade.
@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders Just to be clear--yeah, that's right...Clinton got more voters of color--most voters  are generally older...While Bernie got the youth vote. To really WIN he has to get more of those voters that he didn't get before. HE KNOWS THE ISSUE. He is ON it. *Not* unique to him.
@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders He's NOT doing 'uniquely poorly.' The point is that TURNOUT IS KEY. So this is the most significant issue both for the primaries AND for the general election. That is all that I mean. It is not any kind of 'slam' on Bernie. All candidates face this issue about WHO GOES TO VOTE.
@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders No. You misunderstand me. This is just what happened. Black voters did not vote in enough numbers for Clinton. So this is one reason why she lost votes Obama gained. It's not 100% clear he can get these votes because he ALSO lost to Clinton in 2016 in some states due to this.

@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders The issue is about WHO GOES TO VOTE. there is a class of people who don't benefit at all from politics. Can he get them to vote? That's what he's trying to do. Black people are NECESSARY to any democratic win because racist whites vote GOP. Black women vote the most.
@Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @rmathis995 @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders Bernie has been hammering on this point for decades--that people don't vote!  Something exceptional has to get them out to vote. Obama was that. White people vote for Trump. Something has to counter that. So Trump has an advantage because whites are still the majority.
@jayho747 @aseaborne @WaywardWinifred No matter who runs, Trump has an advantage because he's an incumbent and the economy is so far OK and we have the electoral college. It's going to be a very close race NO MATTER WHO RUNS.
@jayho747 @aseaborne @WaywardWinifred Actually, no. Any third party candidate who is not an extremist right winger could hand the country to Trump. And this could very well happen. Schultz could be enough to sink us. It is a looming threat no matter who does it.
@rmathis995 @Wraith_guy @Meghan_BB_ @jamesmcelweejr @BenSpielberg @BernieSanders It's a media creation (possibly a public relations creation). It's a convenient way to explain away wide discontent.

@TWLadyGrey @followjaspa Naturally, when you are running against someone, you think that you are better for the position. Clinton most definitely thought she was better than him? I'm not seeing how it's unlike other primary contests. It was less hostile than 2008.
@TWLadyGrey @followjaspa This is another way to look at it. Clinton was definitely going to have trouble in the midwest simply because of NAFTA &amp; the TPP...then you add FL...and eek. But Sanders was popular in many swing states. Many pushed for him as a way to stop Trump.
@TWLadyGrey @followjaspa Not making criticisms is tantamount to not trying to win the nomination though. When it came out that Clinton was being investigated by the FBI for the emails (BS of course!) I started to fear Clinton would have trouble. Some thought Sanders would be safer against Trump.

@BeckyIB We have to get the Senate and the House to reverse the damage. The systemic issues are huge. The Presidency itself needs to be reformed &amp; weakened, most likely. If we survive Trump, he showed where a lot of fault lines are. Can't EVER take this risk again.

@riccaric @left_is_best_ @aedwardslevy He wants to shift the party back to the pre-Bill Clinton era. The party moved to the right. It hasn't worked. The Democrats were dominant for decades. Then they lost steam. The wind in their sails is not because of Trump-hate. Sanders focussed the Democrats on economic issues.
@riccaric @left_is_best_ @aedwardslevy It's not really a hostile takeover. It's more of a back-to-basics takeover.
@BeckyIB @NewYorker But if he really annoys you--then you may think 'well, of course.' It's just how people read the news.
@BeckyIB I'm only saying--he has already attracted an onslaught of negative, and even severely annoyed coverage. Look at the @NewYorker today. They got a guy from the Hoover Institute to write about Bernie. He is displeased!
@rocknrollElder @ryangrim I wasn't trolling--I honestly don't know how the electorate can be undivided at this point.
@TWLadyGrey @followjaspa I don't know a single person who didn't vote because of Bernie. The one thing that can be done to prevent that is to have a very fair, transparent, &amp; democratic primary process.

@rocknrollElder @ryangrim So you're saying...it's a primary? Is there a 'unified' vote at this time that he'll be dividing?

@arcadewildfire @louise_seamster @prisonculture I appreciate your thoughts though, and your work. I always thought when I was a kid I would grow up to protect kids from injustices like that--but I really don't do it. I am glad for people who do.
@arcadewildfire @louise_seamster @prisonculture They find out eventually. This whole conversation is making me sad. People scoff at idealizing children but when it comes to this--violence, hatred...they learn it. For a child to learn he is hated is heartbreaking. Racists aren't born with their ugly desires. Adults ruin them.
@lexietalks @SuburbanKL @SenSanders @Richard_Schiff @t1international Not all lower-level public education is a disgrace.

@The_Albatross Yes, that's a good way. It's something that's been resisted because some economists decided to discount future costs. Their projections depend on the future being exactly like the past. And we have scientific evidence it won't be. Realistically, future costs will be huge.

@alon_levy Ah, OK. That's heavy-handed. However, isn't that because Israel is a small country without many alliances?
@alon_levy That seems like regular politics though maybe the usual backroom deals. It doesn't sound like the US controlling Israel exactly?
@alon_levy Bill Clinton! Tsk!
@alon_levy @benjaminholgate @MGsovski @mattyglesias Oh, do tell. Really?
@alon_levy This is all very interesting to me. I try to avoid this issue. Your take seems a little implausible but then the world is a strange place so who the hell knows? Now I want to know about US lobbying in Israel. What?!
@alon_levy @benjaminholgate @MGsovski @mattyglesias I'm sure Israel could defend itself without US help, given that Israel has nuclear weapons. It certainly *appears* that Israel is interested in US support on a number of levels. And the US does not appear to have much sway over Israeli politics--but it's hard to tell for sure.
@alon_levy @benjaminholgate @MGsovski @mattyglesias Is military aid ever 'need based'? US gives aid to get the governments of countries to be amenable to US interests. Israel is already amenable to US interests. Judging from Netanyahu's actions toward Obama--Israel expects the US to be amenable to its interests &amp; the US complies.

@alon_levy @benjaminholgate @MGsovski @mattyglesias You mean --it sends a message to other countries that the US will take up for Israel? Why is money essential for that message? And who is going to attack Egypt? (Also, who would not want 3.5 billion dollars?)

@BitchR @tirnmy @eshaLegal @ChelseaClinton @mcbyrne @IlhanMN Antisemitism doesn't take the form of people screaming how they hate Jews every time. It often takes the form of making the person disloyal, foreign, other, suspect, not 'one of us.' That's why it works to raise 'the Jesus thing' against a Jew but never say a bad thing directly.

@grouch_ass @latimes @latimesopinion They never did go after Obama as hard as they go after Trump. He just did not give the same level of material. But Clinton was comedy gold.

@oliverbcampbell @EnlightFundy 'Learn to code' is a grave threat? Who said it was a grave threat?
These are the things I worry about. I feel like I was trained so that men have an advantage in many contexts. I was trained to be polite and inoffensive. Men can exploit that. But for the next generation, let's teach them verbal ju-jitsu, not to seek a defender.
Were so many wrong to think that women cannot get into power if they are seen as unable to fight their own battles? Are we ever the equal of men if men are supposed to come in and rescue us from other men? Don't we create at least a minor disincentive to letting us in the room?
Tangent: MANY men are sexist in power-struggle situations. They are unaware of it. A woman with power is a personal affront to them. Often, we react because we're sick of that shit, and they take advantage of the fact we cannot act with dominance. So OK, not a level playing field
It's so politically effective we'll never get rid of it. It has these concerning elements (1) sometimes it's chivalrous defense of women in power--protection (2) sometimes the charge is sexism (it can be that but if it is a standard political attack then there's no way to know)
Often, the attack is couched in terms of sexism. But if it is political, and not something that would be out of line or unexpected if a man were in political position instead of a woman, then does this not depend on the idea that women need special protection?
Example--the Corbyn lip movement. I'm reluctant to list any others because everyone will go bananas. This charge works on people's brains at a deep level. It seems highly manipulative. I am extremely suspicious about the ideas it could be manipulating.
There's this motif used now where a woman is in politics, and a man does what is a purely political thing. We don't know his motives but it's something political people do. However, a woman is considered to be the object of the thing the man does. So the man is roasted.

@JoshuaB77311058 @katywh20 @RoseAnnDeMoro It's not 'one group is all that matters.'  This is how elections work. You have to appeal to voters based on things that matter to them. In the US, people believe they're screwed by both parties, and don't bother to vote. So you have to give them a reason to vote for your side.
@JoshuaB77311058 @katywh20 @RoseAnnDeMoro The black vote is the most important vote to beat the GOP in the general election. It is the make or break vote. If black voters vote, democrats win.

@veggie64_leslie Wonderful judgement. Wonderful!
@colddayonmars @Misbiopy @OneHipNinja Migration is VERY significant in showing how bad things were in PR because of the hurricane, and the criminal failure of the US govt. to protect American lives or help Americans. It's just not good comparative data to show anything about Venezuela.
@ChibaCityBaby @cmmcmmcmmcmm @nycbubbles @and_then_sum @VR0NLINE The very problem with solving social issues with criminal punishment. At that point, it won't matter why someone did something. If a social issue is assigned to the courts, individual struggles are irrelevant. Criminal punishment isn't a solution for the faltering of the poor.
@colddayonmars @Misbiopy @OneHipNinja It's a great example to show injustice. But it's a special case when it comes to migration. Many people who live in PR have relatives on the mainland, and all can legally settle in the US. So of course more might leave.
@veggie64_leslie Whoa. Really?
@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill Sure. I think different people with the same take can frame the problem and/or the solution differently in good faith. The 'heated' part is if you look at it in one way it looks obvious...so maybe people get too snarky. I don't know.
@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill Maybe you frame everything differently. I think on Twitter people are talking to an audience, and sometimes it is not that personal. But I do wish--if there are real Bernie people doing it--they'd cut out anything personal. It doesn't help.
@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill If I say 'you're making a mistake!' that's not saying 'your whole if is a lie!' or 'you're a bad person!' All I think is that some big problems are due to certain ties to particular industries (and maybe ways of thinking)...so Bernie is best for that.
@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill They are paid trolls is my point. There was a story about it somewhere. It's real. Anyway, Veronica...they're just trying to convince you. Yes, people get nuts on twitter but everyone knows in 2016 that some of the most dedicated fighters of justice went for Hillary.

@veggie64_leslie The hypocrisy is also entertaining because the same people that love Clinton also hate her but pretend it is for other reasons like 'she's not exciting.' Or 'she's too old' (she's two years younger than Clinton), or whatever whatever whatever. It sheds so much light on them.
@veggie64_leslie I think it's a positive--even if you want Bernie--to have her in the race but I know a lot of people don't agree with me.

@TigerMedicine @TahoeBoulder @bourgeoisalien @thehill In the great depression, FDR stabilized the US by reducing inequality. He alienated oligarchs to do so. A strategy to avoid the worst effects of material deprivation. Mass repression is another. Whatever happens, we need leaders that don't make ordinary people feel screwed.
@TigerMedicine @TahoeBoulder @bourgeoisalien @thehill In the next 10 years these things are likely: Massive ecological destruction, a global economic collapse, global slow growth is already happening, a LOT of unemployment due to slow growth &amp; automation. This is a recipe for civil unrest, more fascism, a lot of scary things.
@TigerMedicine @TahoeBoulder @bourgeoisalien @thehill I'm a woman. I don't think women are more ethical than men by nature in electoral politics. They engage in less interpersonal violence than women but that's not relevant here. I think ethical paragons tend to avoid electoral politics most of the time.
@TigerMedicine @TahoeBoulder @bourgeoisalien @thehill Make that the second time. The first time...that was a little more of a standard situation. The second time turned into a very weird situation which has only gotten more crazy over time.
@TigerMedicine @TahoeBoulder @bourgeoisalien @thehill Oh, it would be a fiasco for sure but it's not worth fighting about it. You'd need an aircraft carrier to fit her baggage on.  So it's madness, of course. But it was the first time.
@Mr_Bramse @HarveyHuson @sarahkendzior OK. If no one can prove Trump did it then he should not face criminal charges. This is what I think about all Americans facing criminal investigation. No one should be charged without sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing. So far, he has not been charged.
@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill Ha ha ha. Bernie is happenstance. We don't have anyone else! You guys hate him.

@TahoeBoulder @TigerMedicine @bourgeoisalien @thehill Why does it matter if someone runs for the same office multiple times? Let Clinton run again. I don't care. Though it could get pretty weird if she did. So are you thinking there's a deja vu issue?
@KevinKlawitter @GhostPanther But he never mentioned Clinton. This was after the election. He was speaking generally.  Here's an interesting book by Manning Marable about that.

@Mr_Bramse @sarahkendzior @HarveyHuson Maybe it's all a crazy coincidence that he mentioned benefitting from the crime during the election in public &amp; then was unlucky enough to have spent time with Russians on an unrelated matter...and then had various criminal associates. Sound like I'm being sarcastic but I am not.
@Mr_Bramse @sarahkendzior @HarveyHuson There are a bunch of 'cover up' charges that could apply-- like obstruction of justice. However, they aren't that significant. He said he fired Comey because of the Russia thing. He is on camera saying that. But that is not enough.
@Mr_Bramse @sarahkendzior @HarveyHuson The accusation is not that complicated. They are a foreign power. That's why the word 'collusion' keeps being said over and over. In this case, a crime was committed (email hacking is a crime). So if he has connections to that crime, then he is criminally liable.

@BarKunTar78 @GhostPanther It is incorrect that any Democrat can beat Trump. We learned this in 2016. And it's still true. Obama had a huge dip in popularity at exactly at this point--and he won a second term. It's harder to win against an incumbent.
@BarKunTar78 @GhostPanther In every primary, the candidates criticize each other, and the voters argue that the other candidates are worse. This is what happens in a primary. The reason Sanders is different is that he shifts attention to sharp differences in policy. So the voters demand more.
@KevinKlawitter @GhostPanther What he's saying here is obviously true. It is clear that having a woman candidate is not enough to help women. Some women candidates do not help most women. We all know this is true. You can twist it into a gaffe, except for the fact it is true.

@katiecannon2 @girlbossphd @GhostPanther If polls are any measure, then it is not true that women and POCs have major problems with Sanders. He is popular with all groups in polls. And what other measure do we have? Some women &amp; POCs love him, some hate him.

@leahmcelrath @DavidKlion @page88 @pithywidow The one candidate who I don't see being flagged much by the usual suspects is Warren. Weirdly, this may hurt her, as she could get lost in the shuffle. Also weird, most of the 'real' democrats are thrilled about Harris but uninterested in Warren. Why?
@leahmcelrath @DavidKlion @page88 @pithywidow There will be many bots and trolls to come. But they already support both sides. There will also be vituperative rage-dumps, many sincere &amp; not from bots &amp; trolls. All of these methods are a disaster.
@leahmcelrath @DavidKlion @page88 @pithywidow Is it possible to offer specific arguments, and documented evidence to back up the arguments? Can't we do this? Since I believe Harris is going to win, I will appreciate hearing good arguments in her favor that are based on specifics since right now I find her record distressing.
@leahmcelrath @DavidKlion @page88 @pithywidow When people are criticizing Harris, they are offering concrete objections to her as a candidate. There will be many bots/trolls going forward on all sides. Also, there are many loony 'just how I feel' threads about Bernie right now (but sincerely held).
@leahmcelrath @DavidKlion @page88 @pithywidow Maybe 2/3 the prominent Bernie supporters I have been reading are thinking of Warren as a decent possibility, absent Bernie. They are currently praising her tax proposal! The rest aren't talking about her a lot. (A few are--but not many.)

@traceyh415 @Tylerjoelb So sad. There was a television show in the 60s about the poverty, and it had a big influence on the Great Society programs. Such hard lives! I think the industrial lung diseases my great-grandparents had echo down into the current generations. Kids grew up w/out parents.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery It's hard for more well-regulated people to understand. I'm not saying anyone who is full of hate can be converted to sanity by love, though it's too bad they cannot. I'm only saying that you're letting them write the script, which is foolish.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery This is also true of some white racists online. They want people to hate them because feeling like a victim is part of their deal. If you hate them, you're just giving them what they want. True of most trolls. Yes, they are bugging you to get you--but there's self-hate there too.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery It's much easier if you think 'maybe this person is working out some issues in some way that makes sense to them, but not to me.' This is what I tend to think about most people. Then you can ask 'who is worse off, here?' Sometimes it's you, sometimes it's them. Or no one.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery A peculiar assumption. I know some people do this, but I am not doing this. I think he showed some of his pain.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery What would be the point of hating them? Though I teach deference to elders to my own kids, and my teenager.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery Another item in one story was that, when interviewed, the emphasis of Phillips' co-marcher was 'we know they are kids.' He said some of the kids were receptive, so I am assuming there were a few side-conversations that weren't totally horrible. It was a very big group of teens.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery In the media, and in people's words on social media, it has become too easy to dehumanize people of every race. This is now endemic to our social and political culture. Individual white people can be dehumanized but when non-white people are, much worse things happen to them.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery It is true that the Covington teens faced that outrage because they are white. Because the outrage was so total, with so many people pushing their own agenda, the entire incident became symbolic of things that were relevant to larger groups.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery No. I'm only acknowledging they were marchers, in DC about an ongoing &amp; terrible set of issues. The BIs were yelling at them, not only at the teens. (They yell at everyone). Possibly the teens lumped everyone together. But they were different groups, with very different aims.

@ErynnBrook The type of ADHD makes some of those in my family who have it great on standardized tests because of the hyperfocus. There are many other basic life things we are unable to do &amp; some developed harmful coping skills to compensate.
@ErynnBrook FYI: you can have ADHD and be a straight A student. Many in my family have it but we were all academically gifted, and successful. It can be a useful diagnosis even if you don't ever seek medical help, since you will understand your issues &amp; there are a lot of DIY solutions.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery It could be false that the Covington teens embrace a hateful perspective. Also, they are too young for this to merit the same reaction one would have to adults. But I still don't get why they can't be told that tomahawk chop gestures &amp; jeering made things worse in that situation.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery If I am more 'on the side' of Nathan Phillips it is because my assessment is that Nathan Phillips and native people ARE threatened in a comprehensive way in our society. I am not romanticizing him. That is a fact. It is undeniable.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery Could be wrong, but that is my diagnosis of reaction. Nevertheless, situation is extremely complicated, and if the result of reacting to the students is that white people will see themselves as under attack, which they are not, then the reaction may be tragic &amp; counterproductive.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery It is assumed that the Covington kids embrace this ideal so this is why people react to them in this way. Believing that some people like Nathan Phillips have suffered horribly due to the idea of white racial superiority is not the same as being a racist.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery Before Trump, I tried to moral dialogue with everyone. However, the Trump era has made this much harder because I think some of the people one would converse with in the past embraced an idea of white racial or male gender superiority that is beyond the pale.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery The situation is more complicated than he thinks &amp; he's kind of rude but what's the point of fighting with him? Some of his words are true &amp; some false &amp; he has real struggles so my principles take his personal context into account. That's not ad hoc.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery An example from my life. I have a Native American childhood friend who hates the government, is evangelical, loves Trump as a result. Always comes onto my FB, &amp; picks fights with other people. He gets belligerent but I know his life so I say "OK, I hear you."
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery One clear misunderstanding we have in this discussion is that the application of principles requires context. E.g., teens are young (as those w/ Phillips acknowledge), BIs spoke cruelly. The protestors have in mind a long and painful history, which I acknowledge but you do not.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery I don't think this was a wise choice on their part--just as I don't think it was a wise choice on the students' part to strip down, gesture, yell, and then face down Nathan Phillips. Confrontational responses in situations of interpersonal misunderstanding are rarely beneficial.
@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery The implication was some attack. They said they were planning a peaceful protest as they approached the shrine. They were prevented.That's all that happened, according to Catholic news service. https://t.co/bwaETRFBFV

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery I'm describing a principle of general, and universal respect that applies to every person.

@dovesandletters @RioSlade Not exactly. Those who want to keep burning fossil fuels are losing the argument due to facts on the ground. Their last option to win is to make us give up. We don't have certainty the situation is hopeless so we should not cede the ground nor accept complete powerlessness.
@LisaTMullin @for29years It often seems to me that when people make better arguments against her, they are accused of harassment or unfairness. Maybe I'm wrong. There's a lot of outrage in the responses to those better arguments against her. A kind of citadel they've built against legitimate criticism.
@LisaTMullin @for29years She's entirely correct that she should be able to advance her views without harassment. Her arguments are insufficient to prove her conclusions, and her conclusions are easily weaponized by those whose intentions are harmful. It's also not clear it matters what's in her heart.
@dovesandletters @RioSlade Yes, this is why I said there is debate about it. But it doesn't make sense to me that we must completely dismiss what the IPCC predicts. It does make sense to me that telling humanity it's time to close up shop is premature and counterproductive.

@lakesideliberal @BeruangSinar @SashaMichelle89 @AOC Yeah, if she wins. My guess is that it will be another huge nail-biter but it looks a bit better. Kamala Harris is not going to be a hero to the midwesterners who can't pay their bills. So our only hope is that they are totally sick of Trump.
@lakesideliberal @BeruangSinar @SashaMichelle89 I'd relax if I were you. Harris will have a gauntlet behind her. Russia'll be happy because resentment will continue to fester.

Let's disagree about the politics rather than make out the other side as evil. Otherwise, we're enabling the GOP.
@Michaelrm62968 @PrettyBadLefty Being anti-racist in a meaningful way is not at all easy. Knowing that an indigenous marcher represents a sorrowful history of injustice that requires respect--that's something every teen I know would be aware of. They would admire him, not 'try to show him.'
@Michaelrm62968 @PrettyBadLefty I meant--not hostilely disrespecting people. This is actually quite easy for normal people, including teens. I can say with total confidence I don't know a single teen who'd act like these kids, whatever their race/ethnicity. Correcting things is a HUGE task. The hardest task.
@lilirishdynamo @SashaMichelle89 There was a huge campaign on social media (partly paid for) to create hateful divisions with the Democratic party. This is probably happening again! But people are still falling for it. And I'm NOT talking about disagreement during the primary, which is normal.
@BeruangSinar @SashaMichelle89 People of every side were insane. I saw a lot of insanity from both sides. Like 90% of Bernie supporters, I knew Clinton was our only hope.

@BeruangSinar @SashaMichelle89 Hillary supporters (or paid trolls or something) were on reddit sock-puppeting on Bernie threads. They were very unhelpful to her candidacy.

@PrimeDirector @BanGaoRen @ifonlyifthen @andizeisler @ClaraJeffery The details about this are very thin. I used to go to that Basilica for mass so this is why I cannot figure out what was going on. It's an open space with place for prayers. The majority of Native people are Catholic. Phillips wasn't using the drum as a 'tactic' but as a prayer.

@blown_wish @catbyte88 @ryangrim @babsben It still ruins many people's lives. The sex abuse is horrifying and yet it probably liberated Ireland from Catholic stranglehold faster than any sort of liberalizing method anyone could devise. Not that it is worth it. It's still good though.
@blown_wish @catbyte88 @ryangrim @babsben That's horrible--though slightly funny to me to think about my Catholic upbringing. I'm sure it affected me but we were all Catholic &amp; we dismissed every bit of that. I would hear those things as a faithful Catholic &amp; be like pffft! What nonsense!
@ajhatswell @umairh This also might be why it seems crazy to people. We're used to the status quo. They cannot be. A lot of things young people do look nuts because they think they can change the world. They are happy to use old lefty geezers to change the world. It drives the US &amp; UK media insane.
@ajhatswell @umairh They want what he is promising. They want the change they think he brings. Note also the age differences. Young people are his biggest support. They don't trust unbridled capitalism. They feel desperate, and hopeless. It's worth thinking about why.
@blown_wish @catbyte88 @ryangrim @babsben It probably all sucks. But it sucks in many other places too--Latin America, Asia. South Korea, for example. Even Japan is not a paradise for women. But this just makes it even more worth trying to understand the women who embrace their culture when the culture is oppressive.
@2xBeepBoopVodka @samfhicks @CapehartJ The response to defend the students is very telling to people who honestly don't get the teens' behavior. Nathan Phillips &amp; his fellow marchers did NOT call for any doxxing. But he is being painted as some hostile threat when he clearly isn't.
@2xBeepBoopVodka @samfhicks @CapehartJ No, he didn't target him. Hard to understand why a 16 year old or however old that kid was would think he had to face down this older man with a drum. The kids screaming &amp; making gestures I also don't get. Not hard for some people apparently. But hard for me &amp; many others.
@blown_wish @catbyte88 @ryangrim @babsben Women in Pakistan also have choices, as do women in parts of Bangladesh. It also depends on the woman's income, education level or region. But I was thinking mainly of women in the US. Why do they pick religions that don't see them as equal? I honestly want to understand why.
@blown_wish @catbyte88 @ryangrim @babsben It depends on the country. Women in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Indonesia, Nigeria, etc. do have more choices for how they live, though the window in Turkey may be closing now.

@catbyte88 @blown_wish @ryangrim @babsben E.g., when I read about, e.g., 'wifely submission' I DIE a little. A lot! Maybe the real truth is all those wives are just brainwashed &amp; pathetic. But they don't seem that way. So I try to understand...a little. Not that I can ever agree or hope they don't change their minds.
@catbyte88 @blown_wish @ryangrim @babsben I have never heard the word 'sixiwty.' I'm not trying to shame you. I just don't want to bash billions of people I don't actually know. It is an effort to understand. I cannot say I do. But I try because I am sure that it has to be complicated.
@samfhicks @CapehartJ They dress in other ethnic costumes at other games. Like thinking you need to show an elderly indigenous man with a drum that you cannot be 'intimidated', white people painting their faces black but leaving lips white needs a re-think. Wear the clothes, but don't paint your face.
@Ogunzinho @umairh Don't forget Mercer &amp; other shenanigans. But I think you are exactly right about the apocalyptic fantasies that crop up when people see their fortunes wane. Or maybe atavistic fantasies. They'll take any change--but esp. hope to turn back the clock. Magical thinking!
@Ogunzinho @umairh Seems like a reasonable explanation. It is precisely what happened to us with Trump. However, the 2008 crash played a significant role. And of course Obama wasn't enforcing austerity but wasn't seen as intensely dedicated to reversing the harms of 2008 (blocked by the right).
@samfhicks @CapehartJ I am honestly AMAZED that people would actually think this is at all appropriate. You know a backwards swastika is also a Hindu symbol but I wouldn't be wearing earrings like that.
@preetideshpa @PrettyBadLefty I agree--but the training is so deep. I find myself being deferential in all situations where a man is bullying me. In my case, and in the case of many other women, internalizing that was essential to survival. Our personhood is warped by the threat of violence &amp;/or ostracism.
@samfhicks @CapehartJ I am teaching my kids that when they meet a person they disagree with, they don't rush to hate them &amp; stay open to dialogue. But in a society where other parents are so enabling of kids' entitlement &amp; hostility to others, are my kids going to be chumps or victims? Are we all?
@samfhicks @CapehartJ From the standpoint of someone who simply wants to live in a society where we have high moral expectations for the young &amp; the public culture enforces good values &amp; respect, it's very disconcerting.
@samfhicks @CapehartJ Reactions is now strong because a) the teens were hella obnoxious b) they did not act appropriately &amp; adults enabled them c) now we find lots of bad info about the school...Blackface, etc. &amp; especially d) the denial is so total &amp; choreographed by paid pros.
@samfhicks @CapehartJ Understand the idea of defending the kids from doxxing &amp; rush to judgment &amp; remembering they are young (and YES PLEASE lets do this for ALL kids...EVERY teen accused of anything ALWAYS). But I don't get the idea 'oh, this is all fine. The elderly man drumming is the bad one.' NO.

@ajhatswell @umairh There's very helpful. It's very hard to understand how Corbyn got the blame for this thing. But I suppose people are imagining a different Labour party under different leadership...and if more effective maybe they would have successfully softened the exit or gotten a re- vote.
@hmantegazzi @KillerMartinis Well...I'm going back a little far. I was thinking since the French Revolution anyway. Historians like smaller time slices but there has been an ongoing struggle--popular revolts always fizzling out, bring crushed, etc. Persuasion is the only way.
@hmantegazzi @KillerMartinis But I personally think the main reason most of the world is not more socialist is because of the brutality used in stamping out socialism whenever it arose. So that is the other side of the coin. You can look at the last 300 years as 'la lucha sigue.'
@hmantegazzi @KillerMartinis If left gains power by force, generally there will be a vanguard or authoritarian leadership...or that's what always happens after using force if they win. If the left doesn't have overwhelming popular mandate, then they have to fight...the fight usually ends in a kind of draw.
@hmantegazzi @KillerMartinis But then the left's gunpower can never match the rights' gunpower. I think your point before (maybe?) was that leftists should prefer liberal democracy. I agree with that exactly. Besides that, you only have to look at aftermaths of wars. The left can ONLY use persuasive methods

@andizeisler Be honest though--you have actual doubts about whether your kid would do this?. There is no way my kid would do this. I have absolute certainty about it. He'll do other appalling things but nothing of this kind. Most kid screw ups aren't parenting failures but this one has to be.

@Eugene_Scott My kids even help older people on the bus with packages. I don't have to threaten them or anything. They have genuine desire to show respect for older people. They want to be polite and helpful.  This was EASY to teach also (unlike most things I try to teach them!)
@Eugene_Scott I currently teach my children complete deference to the elderly. Doesn't matter if they yell at you &amp; you haven't done anything. Just say 'sorry Sir/Ma'am.' I guess some people don't do this anymore. Racist white people when it comes to brown elders at least.

@gnocchiwizard I had similar thoughts. But it's a teeny bit more complicated than that because Killmonger wants to take over the world in an uncontrolled way &amp; King T'Challah says he wants to use the technology to help the oppressed (though he is vague on how).
@gnocchiwizard I was thinking about what these teens will grow up to be--and it is partly that their parents are actively committed to preventing them from thinking critically...but also it could be that a kid who thinks critically might be unwelcome in their milieu.
@gnocchiwizard The whole thing is disturbing but the fact they simply accept their children could act badly, but must be defended without even asking them to reflect even for a moment! It's unsurprising, and explains a lot about how some people turn out--but it's hard to watch anyway.

Their parents made them like that. But what will their lives be like in that bubble? Always running away from real life? A shame.
@JeremiahTrent @girlsreallyrule @samswey Sad. I've seen this with (some) wealthier students. The parents are narcissistically invested in the kids so they never allow the kid to learn from their mistakes. They protect &amp; coddle their children from any hardship or criticism. The children do not develop character that way.
@birkirstin @haguediva @girlsreallyrule It's very helpful to teach a kid perspective-sharing when they are young. If my kid sees someone who might put him off we say 'why is that person acting like that? What are things like for them?' This makes kids patient with others. Also--teach deference to the elderly!
@haguediva @girlsreallyrule I was wondering how to teach my kid to walk away when other teens are acting poorly. The oldest is good but can't guarantee he'll never get in any trouble! The youngest has a warm heart but in adolescence, they conform. They would NEVER do anything remotely like this though.
@Perpetr8rMike @DAvallone @DavidFutrelle It is too bad you did not read the statements by the indigenous marchers because right off the bat they said 'they are only teens...' They mentioned their concern for them, they mentioned they didn't want them internet mobbed, etc.
@Perpetr8rMike @DAvallone @DavidFutrelle No. There was no way around him given the crowd of shrieking, gesturing students.

@pheminazi @DavidFutrelle Yeah, that's the other thing. Besides their other issues, those chaperones &amp; teens lack basic common sense.

@nowhitechalk @so_rudez @arlenparsa Yes. Clearly. Why it's sickening. They're reaching the age where it's going to be fully baked in. And why it is so tragic when teens are thrown away in our criminal justice system. People can change at any age, but teens are redeemable. Sadly, these parents want them this way.

@Tracey___G @so_rudez @arlenparsa That should be the take away. The unfairness of that is disgusting.
@rrufiange Absolutely. When young people do wrong, it is the responsibility of adults to put them one the right path. Our society is set up to toss away the lives of First Nation kids, black kids, immigrant kids. So many opportunities wasted, so much potential wasted because of racism.

@_tothewonder @gilgrim @RespectableLaw There's a lot of compassion in the words spoken by the indigenous marchers. Even hope. Their song was apparently a healing song. Those kids could benefit so much from reflection on this experience, and what that man &amp; others could teach them about fortitude, compassion &amp; dignity.
@_tothewonder @gilgrim @RespectableLaw So unfortunate.  All evidence points to mob behavior. Those who want to defend/explain/justify do them a disservice. This is something they can learn from. And if they honestly do, they will be better off in life (and likely forgiven by those present).
@_tothewonder @gilgrim @RespectableLaw We know that not everything can be seen from video--can't read the kids' mind. However, watch &amp; listen. Teens mock, gesture, belligerently debate adults asking them to step aside. They are massively disrespectful. The mom's letter also doesn't support a more benign reading.

@benedictthemad @the_real_crank @clb4yeswecan @arlenparsa @Pontifex @supmikeclines Catholic schools differ so much.  It depends on the orders, and the orientation of the school.
@so_rudez @arlenparsa True. This is actually a chance for these kids to learn. They could benefit so much from understanding why their actions are very wrong. But they probably won't because there's an army of deniers/enablers/excusers/justifiers out there to stop that.
@pgeezy68 @arlenparsa Even 14-16 years olds actually guilty of terrible crimes should be allowed to rehabilitate &amp; redeem themselves. But they have to do something to get that chance. They have to change. These kids can too. This is a chance for them to become better.
@_tothewonder @gilgrim @RespectableLaw Sorry, I didn't save them. I just looked up the hashtag of the high school and watched all the posted videos. We don't JUST have the video--we also have what the indigenous marchers said.
@pareene I would basically die if this were my kid. He called the cops on another student! But she was trying to keep him from filming her &amp; was uninjured. Oh, no. I hate to blame the parents because karma will bite me in the a** w/ my kids if I do. https://t.co/xUDt2puljf
@pareene I suppose you could look at this as a case of massive rebellion while also maintaining the family privileges. Because he doesn't need to be a Trump supporter to stay privileged. It's a direct hit on mom, though.
@pareene Whoa! Just read about him.

@jrcoyne99_17 @oklahomosexuals @RespectableLaw They can't get out of his way and let him pass? The wider angle shots show them mocking him, disrupting his song, and so forth. All they had to do was step aside.
@_tothewonder @gilgrim @RespectableLaw He was going to the Lincoln Memorial, and they blocked the path, tried to disrupt the song, made rude gestures, etc. Barbaric and unbecoming behavior from those teens. They won't leave them alone. I have watched many angles &amp; it is clear.
@Uncle_Jimbo Came at them? Held their ground? They're drumming. The kids could have walked away. You must be kidding.

@queersocialism They go through life like that. But the only explanation is they cannot be shamed by being shown their indecency, and they cannot learn. Because the evidence is all around them and they do not change.
@queersocialism Correct. You and I would die of shame. If my kid did that--I would die of shame. They seem to think these things are normal. It explains a lot.
