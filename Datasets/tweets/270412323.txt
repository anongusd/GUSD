@standfree4ever @carykatz @CRTV On Friday in Las Vegas, Katz, CRTV's owner and @MarkLevinShow's business partner, sued CRTV to get his money back. So the person who's "hurting a fledgling conservative TV network" is its own boss. Don't get played for a sap by these phony conservatives. https://t.co/a0F9yfiidL
@FrankelJeremy @CRTV I don't know who your friends are at @CRTV but they might be interested to know that their boss, @CaryKatz, filed suit against @CRTV for millions of dollars in Las Vegas on Friday. So @CRTV seems unlikely to be long for this world. https://t.co/a0F9yfiidL
@NHAinTexas @OilFart1 @marklevinshow @carykatz @CRTV Don't be a sap, and try to understand something very simple: It's Mark Levin's business partner, @CaryKatz, who's suing @CRTV to "take down the entire network". Read the court complaint: It's not about "the message" and "the cause" to Katz. That's why he's killing your network.
@NHAinTexas @OilFart1 @marklevinshow @carykatz @CRTV 1) @CRTV doesn't have "hundreds of thousands of paying customers". You're way off. Try dozens of thousands.		2) They have one investor - @MarkLevinShow's "great patriot" @CaryKatz. And on Friday Katz yanked the rug out - https://t.co/a0F9yfiidL

@standfree4ever @carykatz @CRTV "Great conservatives" understand a core conservative principle: If you incentivize bad behavior, you get more of it. 2 judges have found @CRTV guilty of wrongdoing &amp; ordered them to make it right. You want them to escape the consequences: there's nothing conservative about that.
@FrankelJeremy @CRTV Yeah, well, @CRTV's Corey Fehlner and the other @CRTV goons destroyed it as soon as they heard they'd lost the case. Cut through wiring, ripped out fixtures and fittings. I guess @CRTV doesn't believe in losing honorably.

@rjmontesLC @joemerone @Vertiable @TheNewsHam Actually RJ, at least one of them was lying.
