UPDATE: #NJUFO opens and ‚Äúgray snake with tentacles‚Äù emerges, ‚Äúlarge as a bear‚Äù and ‚Äúglistening like wet leather.‚Äù
UPDATE: Huge metallic cylinder, formerly thought to be meteorite, plummets from space onto #NewJersey farm resulting in 30 yard-wide hole in ground. No injuries. Onlookers advised by police to keep distance. #NJUFO
‚ÄúHuge, flaming object‚Äù believed to be a meteorite, falls on farm in the neighborhood of #GroversMill, #NewJersey, 22 miles from #Trenton. Details forthcoming.
