Are there racists and bigots in this country? Yes, and sadly there always will be. Are there prejudiced people in this country? Yes, and we need to confront them whenever we witness their misdeeds.
America is not a racist nation, anyone think or implying otherwise is just naive and gullible! Unfortunately, just like human body consists of bad cholesterol, our nation shares the proportional numbers of people who are racist, bigoted, and prejudiced as well. “We the People” https://t.co/pLOkBxX7hG

A worldwide survey was conducted by the UN. The only question asked was: "Would you please give your honest opinion about solutions to the food shortage in the rest of the world?"

@Newsweek If the rigged political system allowed most ineligible person to be elected to the highest office then anything is possible? Should the blame go to the mega investors,  Congress, Electoral College, and all major parties for looking the other way and ignoring the Constitution?
