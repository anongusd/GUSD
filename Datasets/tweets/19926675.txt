With lower tax rates at all income levels, Americans in every community will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. In fact, a family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will save over $2,000. https://t.co/aWgbO8FU6P
Doubling the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 will help more parents across the country with the costs of raising a family and caring for loved ones. https://t.co/CHiBkOJUVJ
The nightmare of tax complexity is coming to an end. With this dramatically simpler and fairer tax code, roughly 9 out of 10 Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form as straightforward as a postcard. https://t.co/oW7eA2jp0L
After years of stagnant wages, this new tax code will finally help Americans get a raise. It will reward hard work and encourage investment in our communities to increase the growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks for hardworking Americans nationwide. https://t.co/ZGzJKAXdUF
Not only will our new tax code protect American workers and stop jobs from moving overseas ‚Äì it will help reestablish our nation as a 21st century magnet for job creation, innovation, and economic growth. #NewTaxCodeCountdown https://t.co/huuFIZ6pz7
Americans will continue to have important tax benefits &amp; deductions they count on, including relief for high medical bills, mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and education expenses. Our new tax code also retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and IRAs. https://t.co/L72VQTNsgK
