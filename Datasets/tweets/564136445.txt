@AlaskaAir Travel &amp; adventures are good for the soul.	They always make me happy and whole.	A lot of destinations I want to get to fasta.	That‚Äôs one of the many reasons #iFlyAlaska    #AlaskaHappyHour
This is just one of the many amazing views my son @LewisSports and I found today on the Gold Creek Pond #snowshoe trail at Snoqualmie Pass. I hope you had a chance to enjoy this beautiful #winter day. @SnoqualmiePass #wawx https://t.co/FykRo45GMH

What a stunning January day in the #Seattle area. Perfect for a walk on the pedestrian/bike path across the I-90 bridge. The view of Mount Rainier across Lake Washington was simply spectacular.  #mountrainier #winter https://t.co/XcTV55CfHq
The Brothers are standing tall and looking mighty good today! The two 6800 feet high peaks in the Olympic Mountains provide a remarkable backdrop looking across Lake Washington from #Kirkland on this beautiful winter day. #snow #mountains https://t.co/NLsFSICgK8
@FrequentTweeter @LewisSports Happy New Year to you. That‚Äôs such a nice message to Tim and me. Can‚Äôt thank you enough... and as Tim said we are looking forward to many 2019 adventures and will definitely be posting photos.
@MikeGurley That's a very nice compliment. I'm sure you will handle it well. I feel very lucky and I'm definitely loving life. Thanks... and Happy New Year!
Stunning #winter scenery near snowy #Leavenworth, WA. This is just one of the many amazing views I saw along a #snowmobile trail in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National #Forest. Can't wait to go back! https://t.co/EZZtXVDzI2

@cookin1182 Haha! Thanks for sharing this!!! That's a fond and funny memory for me.
Over the years I‚Äôve told many people that one of the finest gentlemen I ever met during my career in television news was George H.W. Bush. In this photo I was interviewing him during his 1980 run for President. I‚Äôm saddened tonight to hear of his passing. #GeorgeHWBush üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/jnfzQEq0sY
@ToveTupper Excellent video!! I can see why @HighlineSchools are proud of their middle school principals, teachers and academic success.

Heading to Palm Springs for the #Thanksgiving weekend with @ToveTupper &amp; @LewisSports on my favorite airline @AlaskaAir. Sure hope they still accept these drink tickets on the flight down. I‚Äôve been saving them for a long time for a vary special occasion. üòÇ https://t.co/TFXnAgjINQ

@TheChrisPayne Chris, that is a great story!! Definitely made my day. I was working at @ABC7News at the time. Thanks for letting me know after all these years.

@MoarlyCreative @HomeStreetBank This is excellent!!! Congratulations to all involved!!!
The beautiful and somewhat rare larch trees that turn gold for just a couple weeks in autumn were out in all their glory this weekend near Blewett Pass. Here they are all lined up under a clear blue sky with Table Mountain in the background. #larch #tamarack #nature https://t.co/sMUIRHwIBs
Went searching today for the elusive golden larches in the Cascade Mountains around Blewett Pass with @LewisSports and @ToveTupper We found a few. What a beautiful day!!! #larches #tamarack #autumn https://t.co/HMBthpaS2W
Fall colors call brighten things up even on a rainy autumn day. Beautiful trees in the foreground with evergreens on Tiger Mountain shrouded in clouds in the background. I enjoyed my time in #Issaquah today. #fallcolors https://t.co/wni51SCetp
Cool October colors can brighten up a dreary Pacific Northwest day. I spotted these trees in Issaquah. #fallcolors #issaquah https://t.co/xqzQCW9ujf
Stunning fall colors in the underbrush among tall pine trees in the Wenatchee National Forest near Leavenworth, WA. Thanks to my daughter Kristian @wsubabe96 for tipping me off about this beauty. #fallcolors #nature #nationalforest Check out https://t.co/7hLTqhDyEo https://t.co/sexHHa0VBG
Fall colors are popping in the Cascade #mountains. This is just east of Stevens Pass on Highway 2. It's quite the #scenic drive these days. Happy autumn! #fallcolors #autumn https://t.co/BNqodeyUZG
With the autumnal equinox arriving tonight the fall colors are already out in the Seattle area. I spotted these trees today. Happy fall! #autumn #fallcolors #Seattle https://t.co/BBcrq0xdLu
Hey @Walter_Kelley I just saw you talking about the huge anvil cloud today. I got this picture of it looking south from Issaquah in case you‚Äôd like to use it. https://t.co/luCn1ZqQ6V
@budaka123 @MountRainierNPS The one tip I would have is to do the trail clockwise for the best Mount Rainier views.
@budaka123 @MountRainierNPS Sorry I don‚Äôt know for sure. Since I have the pass I haven‚Äôt looked around at the trailhead to see if they have the drop box for the one day fee. If you go I hope it works out and you have fun! ‚õ∞
Pleasure to work with two great companies: Moarly Creative &amp; Delivery Express!!! Thanks! https://t.co/8pet7A4Epf

@ToveTupper You are way too kind!!!! Thank you!!!!
@IssaquahCoffee @MountRainierNPS You‚Äôre welcome! It‚Äôs always one of my favorite stops!!! #bestcoffeearound
@budaka123 @MountRainierNPS It's the Naches Peak Loop trail on Hwy 410 just before Chinook Pass. No park entry fee required but you do need a Northwest Forest Service pass to park at Tipsoo Lake where the trail starts.
What a beautiful morning among the #wildflowers at @MountRainierNPS Trying to beat the crowds I hit the trail early and caught the sun just as it was coming up over the horizon. #sunrise #NationalParks https://t.co/rJZtVFnXvJ
@SeattleBlgrs @Mariners @AnthonysRestsNW You should have ordered a ‚ÄúMy Oh Mai Tai.‚Äù
@coffeedup Thought about it, but did not. A lot of people do swim in Snow Lake though.
@CharBSage The mountains got a lot of snow this past winter so it‚Äôs hanging around a little longer this year. A bit unusual maybe but it is called Snow Lake. Here‚Äôs another picture from yesterday. https://t.co/MF1blt0fAA
@jdthorell Thanks for your help in 2001 and for your kind words now! I think about Kathi every single day! I hope all is well with you!
@budaka123 It's listed as 7.2 miles round trip with an elevation gain of 1800 feet. It's rocky in places along the trail. I want to say it's really not too difficult but you would be the better judge. It sure is beautiful up there though!!!
Snow Lake in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness near Snoqualmie Pass was absolute stunning this morning!! If you can, I'd say #goforit #hike #snowlake https://t.co/bL4ISk4V8U

Celebrating Kathi Goertzen who would be 60 years old today. She loved her family, friends, the #Seattle community and the @WSUPullman Cougs. As she battled brain tumors over a dozen years she was the epitome of courage and grace. Oh, how I miss her. #GoCougs https://t.co/Rgl9k7JrS9

Now that the rain has stopped (finally) it's the perfect time to check out the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. The fields, although pretty muddy, are in full bloom and amazing as always.

After a foot of fresh #snow overnight in the Cascade #Mountains it was a beautiful, although sometimes overcast, day at Snoqualmie Pass today. A great opportunity though for the waning days of #snowshoe opportunities as we move deeper into #spring. @SnoqualmiePass https://t.co/OHq0Oc3qme

@randy_moss_TV Randy, I just watched the Florida Derby on @NBCSN a few hours delayed, on my DVR. As always you and Jerry did a great job. Quick question though: what was up with you and Jerry switching pocket squares? Clever. I liked it!
@OwyheeNoCome @komonews @KIRO7Seattle I'm very much aware of this controversy and certainly aware of the importance of reporting the truth and the facts. The truth is I retired 4 years ago and I still very much have my soul. Thanks.
@CanuckZag I‚Äôm with you Kellie. It‚Äôs a great story!
@danscollard I do have the jersey. I didn't realize it was a limited edition.
Good news! This guy will not be in the lineup for the @Mariners tonight on @MLB #OpeningDay It is a fond memory though for #ThrowbackThursday when I threw out the first pitch at Safeco Field after I retired from @komonews in 2014. Thanks to the M's. Have a great season! https://t.co/awXO9K60rh

@Kevin_Martinez @Athletics Charlie Finley loved them and obviously changed the face of the game but I can tell you first hand at the time not all the players were so sure! üò≥ Good luck this spring &amp; summer!!!
@Kevin_Martinez @Athletics Fun memory: Opening day Comiskey Park Chicago April 16, 1963, Kansas City A‚Äôs vs White Sox my 1st job as visiting team batboy was 2 hours before the game to stand on the mound with the new controversial gold &amp; green KC road uniform so TV cameras could adjust to such bright colors
@LaceyTreaunna @LewisSports I sure should. I check those trip reports all the time and know how helpful they can. I'm a huge fan of @WTA_hikers and appreciate all that they do. I will try to do that. Thanks Lacey.
@number1slacker1 Thanks John! It‚Äôs a fun place to visit in any season but usually very special in winter.
It's one of our state's most popular hikes but with the trail covered in deep #snow today my son @LewisSports and I had this beautiful view of Franklin Falls all to ourselves. #waterfall #nature https://t.co/v93TLpbbWK
Kind of hard to believe that about 10 minutes after I took this picture it was snowing pretty heavily at Snoqualmie Pass today. It all made for a fun #snowshoe adventure. #sunburst https://t.co/FU5LyGdxPa

Sunny in Seattle but just after dawn today it was foggy at @SnoqualmiePass. Still, there is beauty to be found on the #snowshoe trails. https://t.co/kl2cqCs8Yz
@twintraction I thought I felt a minor earthquake 2 nights ago, but it didn‚Äôt make the news so I figured I must have imagined it. Then I heard about the Mount St Helens swarm of quakes so maybe it was one of those. For St Helens though they say this swarm is fairly common.
Looking for a #fun and easy #snowshoe trail with amazing views? You won't be disappointed with the Wenatchee Crest trail at Blewett Pass, especially on a clear day. It was amazing shortly after #sunrise this morning. #sunburst https://t.co/n0zdUdz6NW

@coffeedup The trail was icy in places. I'd suggest wearing micro-spikes, YakTrax or some other kind of traction device on your hiking shoes
@nanda_morse We tried over Christmas break. Had to abandon ship because of crowd &amp; stuck cars. 9:30 yesterday just beat the weekday crowd.
@jamebo63 Thank you Jamie!
@scoooter54 I saw that Portland got dumped with snow. I hope you can enjoy it. Thanks for watching KOMO-TV when you were up in Seattle!
@pamstucky No but that's because the road was closed today for plowing right at the I-90 exit. We walked the road 2 miles to the trailhead.
What a #winter. Now #FranklinFalls is almost completely frozen. It was a fun #hike today but it's VERY popular. Go early. I-90 exit 47. https://t.co/sbYdfOknYh

@nanda_morse Nice! I was thinking about hiking to Snow Lake but figured snow would still be an issue. The Source Lake hike is a good option.
@LewisSports @michael_alunni Trying to beat the favorite I'm going with Exaggerator and My Man Sam. Good luck!
@idaho_panhandle @LewisSports I always try to beat the favorite too. I haven't studied it closely but I like Exaggerator and My Man Sam.
@CanadaLev Going to see Donald tomorrow?
@Robthegman Nice Rob!! Thanks.
@Robthegman I've heard you can see it from I-90 but I never have. That would be pretty cool.
@CanadaLev You're always in Canada!

@angel_lorrice I think that's it. They're given out with every drink.
@WarlockKenny I'll never use one again.
@DanLewisNews I find the number to be stunning. When I first saw it I thought it was a misprint but many sources seem to agree it's accurate

@connie_ormiston Not that I know of on that hike but there are many more in the area. The Snow Lake hike is a good one or Rattlesnake Ledge.
@connie_ormiston It's not quite up to Snoqualmie Pass at exit 47 on I-90. It's a short (one mile) relatively flat hike to the falls.
@fredreiff1 Thank you! I hope you had a great day.

@mswalli Yes he might but check with him because I'm not sure there's room for it in the sports department office! Very nice of you to ask!
@mswalli @LewisSports @komonews Thank you!! Oh, and I was watching too! #ratingsboosters #pops
@dillsdot253 @LewisSports Tough call. I think whatever you're comfortable in. We did a ton of walking in SF but had an Altima rental.

@oldlineman1975 @CraterLakeNPS It sure is! I loved it!
Last stop on my #roadtrip. @CraterLakeNPS in Oregon. All I can say is: wow! #craterlake #wizardisland #oregon #blue http://t.co/sneMMzQXQL
@sacsequim I don't know about the cavern tours. I didn't see them advertised but I didn't look closely for that. Beautiful place though!
@tjmaceff Thank you!
Beautiful day at Mount Shasta in California. #roadtrip #mountshasta #california http://t.co/H1X7ufV7Eo
@adrianadunn It's another day of adventures on the road for me so it should be good! Have a nice weekend!
@adrianadunn  I remember! That was 10 years ago? Wow. Great people at @komonews . I'm glad you enjoyed your internship &amp; hope all is well!
@adrianadunn You're welcome Adriana. I'm really glad you enjoyed it. I sure did!
@arturot @komonews Thanks Arturo! It's an amazing sight. So glad I hiked there today... and it was a perfect day!
@kitchentable28 @komonews Thank you!!
@adrianadunn I know! I'm so glad I took this hike. The lower and upper falls on the McCloud River are nice. The middle falls are awesome!!
Great hike today to the middle falls  on McCloud River in Northern California. #roadtrip #waterfall #California #hike http://t.co/2tZpa9nxkK
@KTVUJulieHaener I can't believe that was 10 months ago, but I have tell you I have really enjoyed these last 10 months! Life is good.
@KTVUJulieHaener Thanks Julie. I watched last night too. Great to see you... on TV.
@Canada_Kellie No. Just a road trip. Wandering all over the place. Having a great time!
@Canada_Kellie He's one of, if not the best, stick handlers in the NHL. Blackhawks miss him!
@KTVUJulieHaener You're as good as ever Julie! Watching tonight from Monterey. Nice work!!!
Road trip winding down. Nice day to check out Morro Rock in Morro Bay, California. #RoadTrip #morrobay #California http://t.co/Zs8olFglvd
@BJShea @stp999 Also check out Bell Rock and Snoopy Rock, my two favorites. Have fun!! #OldIsAStateOfMind
@TwilightLaPush It was fun to see!
Snoopy! Some rock formations you need a lot of imagination to match its name. Not Snoopy Rock in @SedonaAZ #roadtrip http://t.co/mZoyodpwSx
@Canada_Kellie Nearly 2,000 miles in 7 days. You'd really have to like being in a car!
@Robthegman I've heard many great things about Antelope Canyon and have seen some pictures. Won't make it this trip but I hope to some day.
@stp999 @BJShea I left Sedona Steve... but not because BJ is headed there!
Quite a sight rising out of the red rocks in #Sedona AZ. There's a nice hike to Chapel of the Holy Cross. #roadtrip http://t.co/faMUhvQRO3
It's spring in Sedona, AZ and the hike to Bell Rock is something to put on the "to do" list. #sedona #hike #roadtrip http://t.co/jkQHgUtheW
@Ryan21L I'll check out the brewery Ryan. Thank you! #craftbeer
@Ryan21L Grand Canyon first. Then Sedona. Honestly not sure where after that. I like to adlib these trips and go where my car leads me.
@sfreemangolf @komonews Thank you! When the news broke there was only one place I wanted to be: with my friends and colleagues at KOMO.
@MetPatrick22 Vert nice of you to say. A sincere "than you!"
@jimmay1968 Thanks Jim!
@MetPatrick22 I'm having a great time. I love road trips. I'm putting many miles on my car and enjoying every minute it. I'm a lucky man.
I love a good road trip. I'm heading over the mountains in the Dixie National Forest in Utah, bound for Arizona. http://t.co/X64LvCzpSU
@ConnieKOMO @komonews Thanks Connie. Miss you too.
@Robthegman The weather has been great so far. In the 70's and blue skies. That changes tomorrow. Clouds and rain in the forecast. Oh well.
Great day for a hike to Hickman Bridge, a natural rock bridge, at @CapitolReefNPS in Utah. #retirement #roadtrip http://t.co/rIhyFbJk34

@kaceymontoya @Rebecca_Sports @courtneyfriel Nice moment! Please tell my friend @JimCastillo5 I said hello!!
@chenoite It will be 9pm an hour earlier today than yesterday! #DST
@TwilightLaPush @MetPatrick22 It was fun to have a part in the film but the best way to keep the YAAAAYYY in that movie is to not watch it!
@MetPatrick22 It is forgettable!!!
Beautiful day at Seward Park in Seattle. The mountain was out in all its glory. #seattle #sewardpark #mountrainier http://t.co/IGATkM0pL1
@Canada_Kellie Hi Kellie. What's up? Busy time in the NHL, that's for sure!

@TwilightLaPush Thank you!!

Horsethief Butte &amp; wildflowers in February? I spotted this sign of our mild winter while hiking by the Columbia River http://t.co/WVP7CIMJKV
@Weather61 Great way to look at it!!
@Earther57 With the mild winter these things are blooming early this year!
@TacomaJustin I'm not sure it would fit.. but I know it would look good!
The things you see while hiking. Today on the Horsetail Falls trail by the Columbia River in Oregon. #oregon #hiking http://t.co/3NlgWXRg4B
@laurenlcooley It's definitely worth a visit Lauren and not too far out of the way.
@rennyb_inthePNW Wow! Very cool. Thanks again!
@rennyb_inthePNW Thank you. I saw some signs for that today. I'll try to check it out!
So glad I got a chance today to hike by the most visited location in Oregon for many years: Multnomah Falls #awesome http://t.co/mr76CA7dA1

@sweetemily01 @MacMusic_tour @BarsAndMelody @Exposure_BB @ThisIsTheBrooks @asjoshtaylor @jwaltonmusic Wish I could be there!
@laurenlcooley Tough to predict but I think that has to be a possibility.
Late today. Deer to left. Downtown skyline shrouded in fog. Olympic Mountains in the background. Now that's Seattle! http://t.co/GzWk6zwkfW
@laurenlcooley Yes. I've seen that being reported now too.
Nice afternoon with the clouds reflecting on a very calm Beaver Lake in #Sammamish today.	#beaverlake #Reflection http://t.co/7qLaCZOWMl
@Breeza7 Haha! Thanks! Lester Holt will be filling in. They didn't call me!!

@Canada_Kellie @LewisSports They better get their act together... and soon!

@skoolboy32 It's Highway 93 in eastern Nevada. 97 is very cool too!
@MetPatrick22 One of the roads was Highway 50 in Nevada. It's known as "the loenliest highway in America." It was great! #usroute50
There's something very enjoyable about driving on a scenic, secluded highway with plenty of time to reflect #roadtrip http://t.co/cW9PzGdoxT
@ScottSKOMO @travelingbhat What a great picture!!!
@laurenlcooley Thank you again. It was a very pleasant scene!

@idaho_panhandle No. I'm headed the other way.
@idaho_panhandle Yes. It's close. I'd guess about 40 miles away.
@MicahGrimes No. Southern Utah. Hopefully to hike in the National Parks.
Today I hit the back roads of southern Idaho. You don't always have to leave your car to enjoy the winter view #idaho http://t.co/MVFrWFbTFH

@laurenlcooley @LewisSports It was pretty amazing Lauren. A lot of mist too. We got a little soaked but had a lot of fun.
@karenjen75 @LewisSports @StevensPass Thank you! @Sony RX 10. Does not have a detachable lens. #greatcamera #sony
@MetPatrick22 @LewisSports @StevensPass And that's okay with me although I know our friends at Stevens &amp; other ski areas aren't too pleased.
@GEEQL @LewisSports @StevensPass I'll drink to that!
Another amazing January day for a hike. My son @LewisSports and I headed up to Bridal Veil Falls near @StevensPass http://t.co/CsUcRsH2xl
@srosenow_98 I think you're right about that!! Google images failed me on this one!
From the Seattle waterfront today I had this view of Mount Olympus peaking out from the fog #seattle #mountains #boat http://t.co/X4g1xtEdeP
@laurenlcooley Nice! You have tickets to the game! Should be fun.
@thecoffeemonkey Ha! Yes. But not quite living in the fast lane.
Odd! I-90 westbound was closed at Snoqualmie Pass by a rockslide &amp; there was hardly any traffic so I took this pic! http://t.co/pzI0WYWIL8

Awesome day for a hike in Joshua Tree National Park. Many amazing views! @JoshuaTreeNP #california #hike #usa #beauty http://t.co/1Unu6QY5Ih
@jonhumbert I wish I knew!?!?
I feel very fortunate to have been in Santa Barbara, CA tonight to see this sunset. #roadtrip #California #sunset http://t.co/A6XrzjC5rH
@idaho_panhandle Thanks Brian but I think I'm going to miss it this time around. I'll have to come back!
@violetdiva I seriously stopped for pictures at the bridge and kept going!
@SleepenNSeattle Sorry about that "thanks you" typo. I hate typos!!
@calkid357 Just for a few years.
@SleepenNSeattle Thanks you Lisa! That's very nice of you to say. If you ever see me out and about be sure to say hi.
@calkid357 Haha! The fog rolled in shortly after I took my pictures. It really did!
@Rwwmsontree @chenoite Thanks Randy!
@jackie_lund Retirement is going extremely well. I've been very active. Lot of hiking this summer &amp; fall. Now on a nice road trip.
Passed through San Francisco today &amp; got this picture of the city, through the Golden Gate Bridge. #goldengatebridge http://t.co/eb6BvrIIMQ
@LewisSports Nicely done. Great article.. and what a fun hike. I was lucky to be able to go with one of the @SeattleBlgrs #hike #Washington
I got a little up close and personal with the Heceda Head Lighthouse on the Oregon coast. #oregon #coast #Lighthouse http://t.co/txRQB1R7kp
@Canada_Kellie Hi Kellie.
@jotell18 @LewisSports Thanks! I'll also keep waiting for a bonus hiking day or two. I'm sure they'll come along!
@calkid357 @LewisSports I know. Tim and I had some fun with that too.
@GlenBeebyKBOI @LewisSports Haha! It's one of the many things I love about retirement!
Ever been to Keekwulee Falls? @LewisSports and I had a nice hike up that way today. Awesome for November! #wa #hike http://t.co/rsX1txwQsD
@MollyShenKOMO Thank you! It sure is a great way to spend a day, especially in November. #hiking
@MollyShenKOMO Yes! I'm excited to be working with you again. Would reply earlier but I was here today. #hiking #wa http://t.co/vIyuG42h29
@Canada_Kellie @LewisSports Nice.
@Canada_Kellie @NHLBlackhawks That worked out pretty well.
@REBoles1116 @NotIrishEnough Good point. Made me laugh, but I think this might be for when he cuts right back in front of that slow poke.
@coopy1211 Loud and clear! #messagereceived
I just had to take a picture of this car I saw today. #traffic #speed #highway http://t.co/4mvlTy3b8I
@TheSeahawks32 Yes, life is precious! I'm trying to enjoy it to the fullest &amp; I feel blessed in retirement. Thanks for the follow.
@TheSeahawks32 @kcnews Couldn't be better. I'm really enjoying it &amp; feel extremely fortunate. Making the most of every day &amp; staying active!
Great morning to sneak in a hike before the Seahawks' game on the Snoqualmie Valley Trail. @kcnews #hike #washington http://t.co/Aw8iywZ27l
@Canada_Kellie Some retired guy, I think.
@angie_seattle For sure! There have been many cute costumes and kids. It's a fun night!
@seatacmediacom @MichelleLudtka Good news!!!! I don't own any!
@angie_seattle Yes. I've learned to be more specific. Saying a number "usually" works... and with my supply 2 seems to be the right number.
@Glorygirlone Thank you!!
@Glorygirlone It is a whole new world.. and actually I'm really enjoying this retired life. I feel very fortunate to have this free time.
@seatacmediacom I bought what I thought would be plenty of candy... now I'm a little worried. Might have to alter my tactics!
@JCCC629 Yes in a way but I think they're just excited. Most of the trick or treaters are nice &amp; wishing me a happy halloween &amp; a good night
First Halloween night home in years &amp; having fun but I'm finding for most kids "take a couple" means 3 and in some cases it means a handful.
Had a nice hike yesterday on Tiger Mountain with @LewisSports You can read about it, &amp; many other NW adventures here: http://t.co/tF0JEqR2f8
@Canada_Kellie I'll see if I can coax him out of hiding. I hope he likes to hike!
A little Halloween week greeting in a picture I got today hiking along the Snoqualmie Valley Trail in Carnation, WA. http://t.co/Jbo2d2Mat2
@laurenlcooley There's no shortage of rain in the forecast! Enjoy your visit!
@idaho_panhandle Thanks for your comments. Very much appreciated. Good to hear from you.
I think 1 of the most important things in life &amp; 1 thing I truly appreciate in sports, is loyalty. So, thanks for ur answers @Mariners fans!
For the fun of it here's a sports talk question: @Mariners fans would you trade Felix straight up for Bumgarner? #WorldSeries #mlb
@COZZEB I really appreciate your kind words about that. I loved my job, my friends at KOMO and this community. Thanks again!!!
@COZZEB @KaraKostanich Thank you! I can't believe I've been retired for 5 months already. So far I'm really enjoying it. #fortunate
@Canada_Kellie @NHLBlackhawks I'm already sitting in front of my TV! #GoHawks

@Gink_1228 What was the 206 skit? They've been nice enough to ask me to record a couple. #the206
@calkid357 Thanks Jen. The weather just turned. Had been sunny and 80. Tomorrow overcast, breezy and 59. Welcome to autumn!!

@skitzofrenic696 @space_needle Thanks!!!
@SteveTVNews @space_needle Thanks. I am. I miss my KOMO friends &amp; hope to stop by soon. I'm watching, of course &amp; you're doing a great job!
@GEEQL @space_needle Haha! It's a 200mm zoom from Sony. I just got it and was testing it out today.
Tourists had to be happy with the way today turned out. I know I was. I got this pic of @space_needle from Kerry Park http://t.co/2ML5ESFZ8Y
@GEEQL Thanks again Tom. Much appreciated!
@bikermartie Thanks Martie. It's a fun and fairly easy hike that ends with a very nice view. I enjoyed it. #cedarbutte #hike #Washington
Looking for a good seat? I found this one today at the summit of the hike to Cedar Butte near North Bend. #hiking #wa http://t.co/nOImNHQK5d
@Skygdss424 Got it!
@NormGregory About 20 seconds.
@LoraaBeee Thank you!
@Skygdss424 Baked?
@medicboi1 I think so! And her outfit matches the colors in the trees! #autumn #AutumnLeaves #Seattle #GreenLake
A beautiful late summer day but while walking around Green Lake I spotted some sure signs of autumn! #seattle #autumn http://t.co/q48uOmJ4cc
Excitement is building for maybe the biggest college football game of the year: @SIUSalukis at @PurdueSports #DreamBig #GoDawgs #whynotus
@Airstream_Inc Thanks! I'm enjoying many new adventures that would qualify as #LiveRiveted 2 good friends have &amp; enjoy Airstream trailers!
@embarkorg Thanks. It's pretty amazing up there... and it was a beautiful, sunny day.
@TwilightLaPush Not expecting a lot of snow but this will be the 1st year in my adult life that I won't HAVE TO drive to work when it snows.
@TwilightLaPush I agree - even though it also means we have 3 full months of winter. #ughh
@tessablavergne I did! It was great. I tried to say hi to everyone going by. Sorry if I missed you! I hope you enjoyed the hike &amp; view too.
7:30 in Seattle and it's getting dark? This is frightening. #spoiled #byebyesummer
What an amazing view today from Rattlesnake Ledge. A great hike not too far from Seattle. #washington #mountain #hike http://t.co/3aphsrBMFb
@Canada_Kellie @LewisSports It's Bettman. Do I have to watch?
@laurenlcooley Thank you!!!
@MichelleKOMO You know me all too well.
@MichelleKOMO Thanks! Miss you too. Surprisingly I haven't been playing that much golf.. although today I did &amp; played well. #wonsome$
@Canada_Kellie I was at Snoqualmie Falls - looking away from the falls.
Tonight's sunset in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. #sunset #washington #mountains http://t.co/ptKoIpuhkl
@MikeBarbre @LewisSports Great day on Alki! We hope you enjoyed the day too!
@chenoite I wish!
@chenoite The answer would be YES if I had anything to do with it! #butidont
The end of another great late summer day. Tonight's sunset from Alki in West Seattle. #sunset #seattle #alki http://t.co/O32iyKECyh
@NoCoothJoe Nice!! I hope to get up there in the next week or two.
@AndyJonesLive Yep!! I'm having a great time, thank you!!
@AndyJonesLive Haha! Looks like it almost could be but I was home watching the @Seahawks  game on TV &amp; loving every minute of it! #GoHawks
@justin_hopkins @Seahawks #waitingbythephone
@jackie_lund @SeattleBlgrs Haha! Ours are blue and green right now!
@RachDanger Thanks! Retirement is going very well. Yesterday was the first Labor Day I've had off in more than 30 years. I had a great day!
@GEEQL Very nice Tom. It sounds like an amazing experience, especially for someone who had dreamed of flying for decades. Thank you.
@GEEQL Thank you. I'll remember this for next time.
The view of Mount Rainier today from Enumclaw. #rainier #mountain #volcano #washington http://t.co/CTBCby2CiB

Beautiful day today along the Seattle waterfront. This is a pretty amazing place to live. #seattle #skyline http://t.co/rGjUCXKJZS

@BoeingClassic @MitchB425 12. Have a great tournament this week!
@NoCoothJoe Not yet but it is in my plans. Thanks!
@MitchB425 @BoeingClassic Thanks Mitch. I guess I would qualify for the "ex" part!
@politicalshon Really? What was the story about?
@Canada_Kellie @TV_Agent_Steve I might even have to go to some @NHLBlackhawks games! Sure would like to. @AlaskaAir to O'Hare!
@Canada_Kellie @espnSteveLevy @TV_Agent_Steve Definitely looking forward to that!! #Blackhawks
@MitchB425 No. I wasn't there. I'm sure I missed a good time!
@frozen_waffles Oh, so now you're branching out into foreign languages. I should have sawed that coming.
@frozen_waffles That's okay. I'm rooting for ya!
@matthewrocks5 That one is definitely in my plans.
@frozen_waffles Good line but you might be barking up the wrong tree.
@Just_Jenn10 Haha! And I didn't!
@Baddjo @LewisSports I'm loving retirement Bill. Thank you!
I went to Rattlesnake Lake today near North Bend. Beautiful place &amp; a great hike but I'm just not sure where to park. http://t.co/eEmQgxYYvS
@KCOYClaire Congratulations!
@paulrennie37 @komonews Thank you Paul!!
@paulrennie37 @komonews Thank you Paul. I guess for some of us those have now become "the good old days." And they were good! #kathi
@lbgoober2001 @komonews So sorry for your loss. It's true, you can tuck away the pain at times but it never fully goes away. #kathi
@frozen_waffles I learned a lot from her too Marty - about journalism, community, family and being a good, kind, caring person. #kathi
@jmccabe809 @komonews Thank you Jennifer. Kathi was truly an amazing woman and such a trusted and dear friend. I feel her spirit everyday.
Seattle lost a courageous woman 2 yrs ago today. Missing Kathi &amp; thinking of her family &amp; her beautiful smile. #kathi http://t.co/BaVo4eTB8z
@Skygdss424 Stay classy!
I am @mattsdriscoll It's going really well, so far. I'm keeping busy and having fun.
@mattsdriscoll Wow!! I really don't know what to say Matt other than a very sincere thank you! #BestofSeattle #speechless
@MetPatrick22 It's going very, very well thank you. I'm keeping busy and having fun.
@MetPatrick22 Damn! Sorry. Next time!
@Canada_Kellie Hi Kellie!

@MikeGurley Things are going well Mike. I'm using a small pocket camera but it's good quality. @Sony Cybershot RX100 Thanks!
@MzEvaMae Thank you - but I do have to say so far retirement is going very well. #thanks
@mswalli Thanks again! You're kind words are very much appreciated!
@chenoite Thank you Marilyn. You are very kind!!
@calkid357 You're very sweet Jen. Thanks! Have a great day!
If you've never been at Volunteer Park in Seattle at sunset you might want to check it out. This is from last night. http://t.co/pSlLRlSHCT
@TwilightLaPush @BlueAngels I totally agree! Thanks.
@19Scott82 @BlueAngels Thanks!
@RobinMcCauley Thanks Robin! I always like it when I get a "whoa!" If you're in town you should definitely check them out!
Have a great Seafair weekend! I got this picture of the @BlueAngels over Lake Washington yesterday. #Seafair #seattle http://t.co/xczohscDMj
@TV_Agent_Steve Great movie huh?!?!
@NatronJones @MountRainierWA Thanks Nate. I agree. This is a pretty amazing place to live!
@MountRainierWA Thanks! That includes some good company. You are my favorite mountain but you always have been! Hope to see you again soon.
@Nunes @realstevepool Steve who? #alsojk Who could ever forget Steve Pool? He's one of my best buds! #thankssteve
@MauigirlMyers Another perfect day for it!
@jotell18 @MountRainierWA It's the perfect place!
@mwhitish @MountRainierWA Thanks Mary! The mountain and the national park are amazing!
If you have a day off this week consider a visit to @MountRainierWA National Park. I got this pic while hiking Monday http://t.co/hLRpz6p02K
@Lori_E_ @MountRainierWA It's really amazing up there! I hadn't been in years and am so glad I went. Very enjoyable day!
@LewisSports Thank you, sir!
@ToveTupper @SeattleBlgrs Thats an excellent plan!
@coopy1211 @MountRainierWA Shadow Lake is easy. Frozen Lake is moderate. You can do Shadow in an hour. I'd say two hours for Frozen Lake.
@Ortsac66 Thank you!!!
@ToveTupper I will do that. Sunrise was great but I definitely want to hit Paradise too. The @SeattleBlgrs set the pace and I will follow!
@eight__lives @MountRainierWA Just now getting into hiking. I love it!
@AlanMRedman Thanks! I'll be around!
@coopy1211 @MountRainierWA I did two hikes today: Frozen Lake and Shadow Lake. Shadow Lake has more wildflowers.
@YawningOrchid @MountRainierWA Thank you. Mount Rainier National Park is an amazing place!
@AlanMRedman Yes. Thanks. Retirement is going very well. I'm staying busy and finding many new adventures. #lifeisgood
What a great day for a hike today at @MountRainierWA #rainier #mountain #hike #retirement #wildflowers #washington http://t.co/vFkyNqPL03

Snoqualmie Falls - looking pretty nice today. #snoqualmie #waterfall #washington #rain http://t.co/VRgyeTQ3UN
@DeloresKathleen Thanks. Eight weeks in now and retirement is still going extremely well. I'm staying busy and having fun.
@splashylopez You betcha! Happy Birthday. I hope you have a great day!!
@EricJohnsonKOMO @realstevepool Ring a bell is not that sound I equate with that!
@TwilightLaPush Ahhh, the good old days!!!
@TwilightLaPush It was another great day in Seattle, at the market and along the waterfront. Thanks.
@Gink_1228 @dvisone What's an alarm clock?
@hduong34 Thank you!
@dvisone No kidding! I'm definitely loving this summer so far.
@shmajo Thanks Shelbs!

@ShaunMrWright Sorry I missed that one.
@Skygdss424 Aww. Thanks for your kind words! Lol.
@YawningOrchid Thanks! Good to hear from you. All is well.
@contexthound Ha! Sorry about that. I feel fortunate &amp; blessed 2 be where I am. I loved &amp; was dedicated to my career but also very happy now
@Canada_Kellie @WeeHawk12 @NHLBlackhawks I love it. Those two guys are awesome.
@Canada_Kellie @WeeHawk12 Have fun with that!! It's a great game... but not as great as the greatest game in the land. #Hockey
@Canada_Kellie Yes. There have been (quite) a few rounds of golf. Some good. Some awful. But that's golf!
@calkid357 Thank you! I really think I will do it. #astarisborn
@RebeccaKing6 Thank you Rebecca. It's a whole new world for me not being so tied to the news. I loved my job but this retirement is nice!
@TwilightLaPush Thank you! Maybe I need to head to the coast!
@jammers427 Thank you. I've done a really good job of staying busy. More family time. Golf and going to the gym. And much less news!
@frozen_waffles Totally agree.
@calkid357 do that would be the Doowylloh sign from the back?
@calkid357 A roller coaster fix would be fun. It's been a while. That hike sounds like fun too. Steep? Crowded?
@MollyShenKOMO OMG I think I just had a nightmare!!! Great to hear from you. I'll be watching!
@HudsonHMack Yes I would like that info. Please DM it to me. Thanks ... and I'm happy things are going well for you too!
@frozen_waffles Life is good ... and the new hours usually have me home long before midnight. It's a whole new world!
@DougPigsleyKOMO Thanks Doug. I also miss the good conversations and seeing all my KOMO friends. Please tell everyone I said hello! #komo
@CaptainRonSEA No kidding! Those bats have really gone cold. They have such good pitching just a few runs will win a lot of games.
@Zelda98373 Thank you! I promise to get a few more photographs on here soon. I still love taking pictures!
@HudsonHMack Thanks!! The weather has been awesome since I retired (7 weeks ago already). Time is flying but I'm having fun!
@calkid357 Sounds like a great trip! So Cal is definitely on my road trip itinerary come fall and winter.
@dillsdot253 So far it wouldn't be too hard. I'm saving my travels for the fall and winter. I love it here in the summer!
@Dawgs2002 Haven't started traveling yet. I'll probably hit the road in late September. It's too nice around Seattle now to leave town.
I haven't tweeted much recently. Retirement is going even better than expected. I feel blessed and lucky. How the heck are ya?
@sum1star I always wondered what happened to the T-Man.
@sum1star I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure I heard of that happening. I might have missed that one. #sorry
@LynxSiamese Haha!! That was fun to do. Thanks. #206
@LOB4LIFE Thanks Mike. All is going extremely well.
@laurenlcooley  Thanks Lauren. I hope you're enjoying the holiday!

@Canada_Kellie Thanks Kellie.

@MetPatrick22 It's going very well thanks. I'm keeping myself active and busy. I'm enjoying it so far!
@MetPatrick22 Sorry. I thought I had done that long ago.
@KevinBye1 @LewisSports @SeattleBlgrs We drove, and explored, the Icefields Parkway all the way to Jasper. We're big fans too!
@LewisSports Wish I were there!
Just one of the many furry friends I saw this past week in Banff National Park with @LewisSports aka @SeattleBlgrs http://t.co/9pc3s3mQ3Q
@TheNikky Thanks Nikky. I love that place! Haven't been there in a while though and, so far, I am enjoying retirement. #luckyman
@EricJohnsonKOMO I think you need a picture of the real thing like this that I have to mark Needle's 50th anniversary http://t.co/PXdlpZE7dk
Seeing some awesome views with @LewisSports as our trip to Banff comes to an end. This is Bow Lake. #banff #canada http://t.co/fieaMUVMQE
@FriendIone @LewisSports Thank you!!
@Mylesoldacct @LewisSports Thank you so much. That's very nice of you to say!

@Mylesoldacct @LewisSports Thanks! We have always loved visiting Canada!
@laurenlcooley @space_needle @seattlecenter Thanks Lauren. Hopefully the weather will be just like today when you arrive.
@Gink_1228 You got that right!
Tough to beat Seattle on a beautiful summer day like today. I hope you're enjoying it. @space_needle @seattlecenter http://t.co/zjRwzLNjBf
@MichelleKOMO @ShannonODKOMO @seattlecenter @PacSci @RussBowenKOMO I saw that #liveonkomo at 11pm. Wish I were there to see the arches live!
@7KEENER2U1 I wish I knew.
@7KEENER2U1 Thank you Robert.
@sfreemangolf Thanks. It'll be nice to honor Ken tomorrow at his memorial service. I suspect some of the "knucklheads" might even be there.
@laurenlcooley Thank you Lauren. So sad, but we're all focusing on fond memories and pulling together.
@Sheryl262 Thank you again!!! We're going to add some new pictures next week so it's worth checking out! #sheryliscool #kathi

Early evening. Snoqualmie Falls. Awesome retirement. So far. #waterfall #snoqualmie #river #washington http://t.co/GarXohJYOU
Breaking: situation is contained at Reynolds HS in Troutdale, Oregon. One student shot and killed. Gunman is also dead. Other students safe.
Oregon school shooting update: 1 student and lone gunman dead  at Troutdale HS. Incident appears to be over.
@SARose95 Very sad on many, many levels.
Shooting at Reynolds HS in Troutdale, Oregon. Injuries reported. School being evacuated right now. Reports of at least one gunman in custody
@GEEQL @jeffburnside @komonews Thanks for thinking of me Tom but I'm just a little short of 222 years old although some days I feel like it!
@mackinnon_c  Thank you.
@jackie_lund @LewisSports Thank you. I agree! He's multi-talented and does quality work! I wonder though where he picked all that up. #pops
@chenoite @LewisSports Amazing guess. FYI: I highly recommend this photographer and personally I would use him again! #greatjob #greatrate
@LewisSports I didn't hire him but he sure is a pro!!
@tomkorocz @MichelleKOMO @LewisSports Very nice! Enjoy the game!!
@shaynajeandance Good to see you! Congrats on your upcoming nuptial.
@lindsaycohen Thanks Lindsay!!!
@soundslikepuget Really? That's awesome!
@Blondeoprah @AudWally @honestchocs @McMinnvilleOR Aww. Thank you!!!
@laurenlcooley Thanks Lauren!
@hollis_jesse You're welcome! Yep, it knuckled alright!
@malmssummit @komonews Thank you. It's going well so far.
@Gink_1228 I know! What were they thinking?
@GEEQL @komonews I have not.
@Just_Jenn10 Nice contrast! Thanks. It's a cool setting!
@mamalyn__ @komonews Thanks! So far, so good!
@coffeenplanes @komonews Many more local and domestic travels for sure!
Hi. Just thought I'd share this picture I took today of West Point Lighthouse while hiking at Discovery Park #seattle http://t.co/OUh3qe8PJZ
@bcondotta @_MargaretLarson @Mariners Good one Bob! I know that Cameron Dollar could play, and can now coach, all four quarters. #imdone
@bcondotta @_MargaretLarson @Mariners Or, Norm Cash.
@_MargaretLarson @Mariners Don't sell yourself short Margaret. Gotta be at least 75 Cent!
@Kevin_Martinez Haha! I'm a available.
@Kevin_Martinez You might say I've got too much time on my hands.
@BigLo66 @Mariners Thanks Big Lo!
@Mariners Let's hope that doesn't change!
Some things just don't add up. For example the @Mariners John Buck is by far more than twice as good at baseball than 50 Cent #mlb #Seattle
@tomkorocz I also have winning ticket on Spectacular Bid from the Derby, signed by jockey Ronnie Franklin. Ran into him in a bar that night.
@tomkorocz That's awesome you were there to see a Triple Crown win. I think California Chrome can do it but I have seen the racing form yet.
Short story on my "not yet complete" website about my experience with last Triple Crown winner, Affirmed, 36 yrs ago http://t.co/QmiGA0RwbC
@Blondeoprah @AudWally Awesome day!
@CCRSport Thank you. Relaxed, happy and healthy. Can't beat that. #luckyman
@Gink_1228 Feeling pretty good. Thank you! It fits nicely, so far!
@MegInSeattle I've been amazed and truly touched by all the kind words.
@MegInSeattle Thanks Meghan. Sorry for the tears.
@sacsequim Thanks. I am and I need to visit Sequim!
@erecasner @komonews Thanks Eldridge. I really appreciate that. I hope all is well with you!
@Levy_Kellie @StvPitts 12 retirement days. 4 days of golf so not too crazy yet but I'm working on it. I think I'm done with NHL til next yr.
@StvPitts @Levy_Kellie I accept!
@SARose95 I sure am. I miss seeing my friends at KOMO everyday - but retirement isnt too shabby.
@GEEQL @komonews Thanks Tom!
@DJJAE_EL @komonews Thanks. Everything is going well so far.
@ItsSchille Thank you Justin. That is very cool for you to say that. It means a lot to me. Kathi was the BEST!
@FNCRJO @komonews Yes sir!!!!
@jdlathrop I have ZERO complaints!
Spotted in West Seattle today: two former anchors. #seattle #sunshine #alki #retired #komo http://t.co/AmkxrNbXij
@spinecoug @LewisSports Thanks Mike. At least it was straight.
@Bham_Insider @LewisSports @komonews Thank you!!! You are very kind.
@jackie_lund @Mariners Yes, it is. Just 10 days in - but so far, so good. Thank you.
@snarkofthebeast @Mariners I might be able to make "that" throw!
One more thanks to @Mariners for having me throw out the 1st pitch last night and for the great team jersey #funnight http://t.co/QKVO3JAqrp
@idaho_panhandle @LewisSports And the James Jones autograph. He was my catcher and what a nice guy he is.
@germanium14 Thank you. It was a fun night! My thanks again to the @Mariners for a very special moment.
@idaho_panhandle @LewisSports I like your analysis. You are very kind! Thanks Brian.
@CynZumba @Mariners I think that was actually the sound of it bouncing!
@SugarrButt That has been a big bonus.
@SugarrButt Thank you. It's just 10 days but so far retirement is going very well.
@daveydham I love that woman!!!! #daughter #bestever
@JenGustin @LewisSports Cherish those moments. It's awesome!
@RedsledDan Itried!
@Bigdaddycool50 Caught me! Actually it was a spitter and the bottom dropped out of it.
@KayKGUNArizona @Mariners @DougPigsleyKOMO Thanks Kayla!
@Mariners @DougPigsleyKOMO Thank you. Some of my most fun times in Seattle and most memorable moments come from Mariners games.
@DougPigsleyKOMO @Mariners @KOMO4Sports Thanks Doug!!! All I can say is: it was right down the middle... but a strike?? #liveonkomo at 11pm.
@seahawksfan30 @LewisSports A very nice honor. No doubt about it!
@Kevin_Martinez @JML1777 Thanks Kevin. That sure was fun. Thanks to you and the @Mariners
@Kevin_Martinez @JML1777 I was hoping for a dollar but only got about 90 cent. Sure was fun though!
@seahawksfan30 @LewisSports James Jones was a very nice guy. I was very impressed.
@TimothyKelly01 @Mariners Thanks! I think I got this one. I hope so.
@shmajo Awesome!!
@YawningOrchid @Mariners Thanks! I always know I can count on you. I appreciate that!
@seagernation @Mariners I'm afraid the catcher wouldn't be able to handle it! Lol
@SusieinLondon @Mariners I would love to!
@SusieinLondon @Mariners Thanks Susie. Maybe I can put to use some of what I saw last year at Lord's Cricket Ground! #funtimes #london
@Mary_Nam @Mariners Hopefully not a real funny one!
@_PayThePiper I sure hope not!
@RickPeterson @Mariners Scary!
@Pachodelic1 @Mariners I'm hoping to get the whole dollars worth. Definitely not 50 cent!!!!
@Mariners I'm currently looking for the heat. I'll bring it if I can find it!! Thanks for this great opportunity!
@nkhensley @Mariners @LewisSports He's trying!!
@CookStevie_S Should be fun. Hoping to throw a strike &amp; it will be from the mound, not in front of it. My little league days were long ago.
Seams like this should be fun. I'm excited &amp; a little nervous to throw out 1st pitch tonight at @Mariners game #seams http://t.co/5jtqN1N6Cs
@Levy_Kellie @NHLBlackhawks First pitch is tomorrow night.
@dkseattle @LewisSports @Mariners I hope I get a thumbs up üëç after the pitch!
@Levy_Kellie @NHLBlackhawks Amazing. Sunday's game 7 is going to be a battle royale!
Excitement about California Chrome becoming 1st Triple Crown winner in 36 yrs? On Stubhub $250 for grandstand $7000 for clubhouse box seat.
@LewisSports Very! Tonight it's Lean Cuisine for me.
@LewisSports @Mariners Not sure if I'll (try to) bring the heat or throw knuckler taught to me by Hoyt Wilhelm when I was @whitesox batboy.
@JordyAri Very nice! I'm feeling a little old - but I guess there's no denying that time marches on.
@laurenlcooley @LewisSports Thank you!
@PashaRozay @komonews @realstevepool Thank you. Ken's family was there with him, surrounding him with love. He will be greatly missed.
@samiam_253 @komonews Great picture. Thanks for the tribute. Good times at @EmeraldDowns
@SleepenNSeattle He was a good man and a good friend. I'm saddened by his loss and praying for his family. Thank you Lisa.
Had a nice day taking pictures with @LewisSports Got this one thru the Black Sun sculpture at Volunteer Park #seattle http://t.co/CksHJ6S1ut
@seagernation @Mariners Thank you! M's beat you to it &amp; asked few weeks ago. It'll be my honor to throw out 1st pitch this Saturday #100cent
@levy_kellie Hi.
Nice. I just became your 100th follower @katiesmithy72 I sent you an email about our missed meeting at KOMO. So sorry!!
@MillerBruns That's me throwing the ball. My son @LewisSports catching. Memorial day warm-up for throwing out 1st pitch this Saturday. #Ms
@pamstucky @ArtifactUprsng Thank you. I had not heard of this either.
100% of proceeds go to Kathi Goertzen Foundation to find a brain tumor/cancer cure. Some of my pictures are for sale http://t.co/Yd768QHx2F
@danskiffington Thank you. I very much enjoyed working with you too and hope all is going well.
@Bigdaddycool50 @Mariners @LewisSports I'm thinking knuckler!
@TKraze Thank you!! I also don't have space to adequately express my thanks for such a nice comment. I sure do appreciate your kind words.
@DaddyDuggan @JRWerner9 My feelings exactly. Thanks.
@spinecoug @LewisSports @Mariners Oh yee of little faith.
@JRWerner9 @NHLBlackhawks Definitely not looking good but it ain't over til it's over - or something like that!
@shmajo @LewisSports @Mariners I hope you see me throw a strike!!!
@spinecoug @LewisSports @Mariners No way!!! No short throw for me. I'm going 60 feet 6 inches.
@ecoconsumer Thanks Tom. And now I guess I finally have something in common with JFK!
@LewisSports @JChaseWilliams @Mariners You got that right!
@Kevin_Martinez @LewisSports I will definitely enjoy it Kevin! Thanks.
@SeattleCityGal @LewisSports @Mariners I didn't want to get that one dirty, or the message on the ball smudged - so we used another one.
@Kevin_Martinez @LewisSports Thanks Kevin!! I'm excited, nervous and determined to throw a good one!!
@DougPigsleyKOMO @LewisSports @Mariners Oh yah. I'm sure that'll help!!!
@TracyMorgan_ @LewisSports Thanks. Right now I'm missing being there but had good family time today which would not have happened otherwise.
@DougPigsleyKOMO @LewisSports @Mariners I know Dougie!!!  The pressure is on!
@snarkofthebeast @komonews Thank you Matt. The trails are happy so far but I don't think this "retirement" thing has really set in yet.
@IrishCARBomb21 Very well so far. This is first Memorial Day I've had off in about 30 years. So far tho it seems more like a long weekend.
Playing catch with @LewisSports to get ready for Saturday night. Thanx @Mariners for asking me to throw out 1st pitch http://t.co/rZrKfp94jj
@jotell18 That was fun doing that. Not many people have seen that movie. It didn't last very long in the theaters.
@jmccabe809 Things are going well so far. Thanks!
@seahawksfan30 Kinda like a long weekend so far but good.
@MotofishCoffee @FremontSunMarkt @JessEstrada @komonews I'll have to take you up on that some other time, but thank you very much!!
@coachmayer Twi great places: Yellowstone and Woodinville.
@coachmayer I've had 2 good days since retirement but it really just seemed like a weekend. The verdict is still out.
@tamiro18 Thank you!!!
@Gink_1228 @JenGoos44 I'm retired ... not a graduate.
@vawnschmitt @komonews I think you're right! Thanks!!!
@Gink_1228 @JenGoos44 No good leads yet! Should I be worried?
@vawnschmitt @komonews I was thinking about Kathi too. Hope she'd be happy for me but I mentioned retirement to her once &amp; she told me DON'T
@nonsequiturlass @komonews Aww. That's pretty sweet! Thank you!

@adamBarhan Thanks Adam! I'll be on the course tomorrow (weather permitting).
@rshu1960 A little ... but maybe more like a vacation day. It might really seem weird when it's a month or so!
@JoJo_Rider33 Thank you ... but uh-oh ... this is just day one!
@kellymiyahara @komonews Thanks Kelly. I loved the KDAN (for a day)! I'm still catching up on FB &amp; Twitter. I was so swamped yesterday.

Thanks @pacsci for lighting the arches last night in my favorite color schemes to honor my retirement #summersolstice http://t.co/lVydny4jse

@KirstenT_21 @SeattleBlgrs Sorry to say I have worked every single Memorial Day that I've been in Seattle (27 years) so I'm not sure! #BBQ
@TheNikky I sure am. Excited, sad and nervous all at the same time.
@firedancer_168 That is the plan. KOMO would like to have me do some special projects in the months and hopefully years ahead.

Maritime official says "We have to locate it, confirm it belongs to #MH370 and bring it back" but it could be something that fell off a ship
Largest object spotted in Indian Ocean is  26 yards long. A second piece is smaller but official says we can't speculate until we see them.
Australian maritime official says "This is the best lead we have right now" but we need to get to area to assess objects more closely #MH370
Australian officials say satellite sightings of objects in Indian Ocean are credible enough that ships &amp; planes are heading to check it out.
Maritime official says they've had searches before with credible sightings of objects that have turned out not be what they thought.
Australian maritime official says there's a "credible" sighting of objects in Indian Ocean but might not be connected to Malaysia Flight 370
