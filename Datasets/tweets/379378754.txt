@SebGorka @KamalaHarris "More importantly, how stupid do you think Americans are?"		The answer to that all depends on whether or not those American's are liberals or a conservatives. Liberals aren't the brightest bulb in the bunch. Just look at their math re: the Green New Deal.

@tieara47 @OneVoiceUS @TomFitton I never dealt with military air for members of congress, but did many times to get news media aboard military flights. If it's for travel from Point A to Point B, then it's prohibited. They'd have to fly commercial. If travel is an integral part of the story, it can be approved.
@Vivgrace2017 @Antoinotabot @TomFitton Use of military air is 1 of the benefits of being in congress. Some, like @SpeakerPelosi, abuse it more than others. In one 2-year period, the Air Force spent over $101k on food &amp; alcohol when she traveled. At $10k per year 4 food, that's enough 2 buy groceries 4 over 10 years.

@SenFeinstein What is the source of your "facts"? Congressional Research Service? Homeland Security? State Department? Your 4th point of contact?
@AppropsDems @POTUS So, what's your point? I'm an Army veteran, and it took a DemokRATic administration 9 months to finalize my retirement. I received 15% of estimated retirement instead of 85% until my retirement was finalized. Current employees miss one paycheck and they go into meltdown mode.
@BrianKempGA If you're really serious about underming organized crime, start with those thieving, criminal DemokRATs.

@BonnieKRobinson @RepDonBeyer Do some research. Not once has anyone whose been furloughed or worked without pay during a shutdown ever lost a dime of pay. It might be retroactive, but they always get paid. - A retired Fed with over 32 years civilian Federal service, and over 43 years total.

@Acosta The opposite of enemy is friend. You are not my friend. Over a period of almost 30 years, I worked with news media. For the most part they were fair, balanced, and unbiased in their reporting even when the story was negative. You're a propagandist, not a reporter.
@DanCrenshawTX @Lindapearl2 The Army has uniform regulations. I'm sure the other services do to. If they were wearing the MAGA hats while in uniform that would be one thing. Holding them in their hands to get them autographed is quite another. Those doing the criticizing have never served in the military.
@ChuckCallesto The liberals are sick, sick in the mind. Disrespecting the dead, physically assaulting people, bullying people, trying to silence them. You don't see conservatives behaving like this. You'd think we were a third world country the way liberals are acting.
