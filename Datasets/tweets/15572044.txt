Bummer - the fog is too thick and the @skiworldcup super-G has sadly been canceled. After bib 38, the results are valid as is. #worldcupvalgardena
Fog sitting comfy from the start to camel humps-not going anywhere fast. Let’s hope it clears soon so @Jared_Goldberg “Goldie”-who posted the fastest time in the first DH  training run-can show us what he’s got! His focus and intensity is #onpoint. 💪🏼 #worldcupvalgardena
Take that back...race interrupted due to fog. Forerunner at start. 🙏🏼🔜☀️#worldcupvalgardena @skiworldcup

Ahhhh, bummer - @Kjansrud was in the lead at the second split but nearly goes through a panel and comes to a stop. Sorry, 🇳🇴 friends! #worldcupvalgardena
Fun Fact: former U.S. Ski Team coach Andy Evers, who now coaches for Switzerland, set today’s super-G. Why does this matter? @TravisGanong responds well to Evers’ course sets. That’s a big plus. 🇨🇭 #punintended #worldcupvalgardena @skiworldcup
