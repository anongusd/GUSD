@AskPS_UK Yes, i even brought a hand held vacuum specifically for the PlayStation. It's even next to an open window to try help but that's not working either. It's always been bad but this is horrendous.

Just signed @mbatshuayi for @Wolves on @EASPORTSFIFA to help my promotion push. No way he's that slow in real life.
@dvntownsend Write something about how awesome I am. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
@davidgold So many people on here that are the problem. Do I think Moyes was the best choice? No. The board have invested money in the club. We have a fantastic squad that needs a shake up. I think Moyes is the man that will wake the players up. I love #whufc and will back them always.

@ExWHUemployee I think if Moyes is appointed we should riot.
@vickyhungerford @BLOODSTOCKFEST Toto probably just assumed they were booked due to popular demand. #thepeoplehavespoken
@gibboftw @Hitman Fuck me. I wonder if there's a screwdriver you can unlock.
@sexypitabread Imagine living in a world that gave a shit. That would be a truly sad place to live.

@vickyhungerford do a fake announcement. Announce something stupid like the cheeky girls.
@Hitman just missed out on Sa/so on this ET because your fucking punch glitch. Click to syringe nope punch him in the face. Great.
@pennjillette love your stuff man. Just started myself. Is it me or is there something to the way you repeat people's names when onstage?
If they make a resident evil 7 biohazard movie the perfect director would be @RobZombie he would capture that shit perfect. @Capcom_UK
@gibboftw drugged his fags. He went nutty and tried to clean himself in the shed.
