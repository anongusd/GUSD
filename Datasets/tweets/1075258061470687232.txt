Happy Galentine‚Äôs Day to all the strong women out there!
Trump said he would be an ally to LGBT Americans, yet he has attacked the queer community multiple times. He has appointed multiple anti-LGBTI+ judges (including to the Supreme Court), he has refused to recognize Pride Month and he is trying to impose a trans military ban.
Great Democratic Response from Stacey Abrams! Glad to hear our values heard!
Glad to see the President reaching across the aisle, but we will not sacrifice our values and goals for him. Now, onto the Democratic Response!

Happy #LunarNewYear to all who celebrate!
So excited to get to hear the President begin his speech by saying ‚ÄúMadam Speaker.‚Äù We have made history, or should we call it herstory? #ForThePeople #SOTU
Especially with what the Trump Administration is growing out there, we need to remember our goal: to #endtransphobia https://t.co/BLFnKv5IKS
That you @RepSpeier for showing President Trump that trans soldiers are soldiers and that they should have the same opportunities to serve their country like anyone else. https://t.co/2alA7OidjM

It‚Äôs day 30 of the #trumpshutdown and the President is still refusing to open the government. It‚Äôs time to open the government, and the President and Senate Republicans are refusing to do so.
It is day 29 of the #trumpshutdown and the President thinks that the Democrats will get him out of his own mess by accepting a deal using #DREAMers as political pawns? No way, Mr President!
