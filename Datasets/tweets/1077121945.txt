Tonight, we witnessed @POTUS use the Oval Office as a prop to spew exaggerations&amp;untruths about what he calls a crisis at our southern border. In his quest for an ineffective, wasteful, immoral wall, Mr. Trump has shut down our government, causing 800,000 Americans to go w/o pay.
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That’s not a pattern – that’s an epidemic. Congress has to step up &amp; pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place. #NeverAgain https://t.co/5daJeqSlle

Bah humbug -- @RealDonaldTrump’s government shutdown needlessly hurts 800,000 federal employees across the nation who ensure the well-being and security of the American people. We need to end the #TrumpShutdown now!
Let's not forget this direct quote from @realDonaldTrump: "I am proud to shut down the government... I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down." Enough is enough, Mr. President - or should I say Scrooge - end this ridiculous stunt and open our government. No wall!
Not only did Trump &amp; his Republican colleagues shut down the gov, they let #VAWA expire, leaving survivors of domestic violence high &amp; dry. Congress should pass @JacksonLeeTX18's bill to strengthen this critical program &amp; provide greater resources to survivors!

Mr. President, unlike you, I've been to these facilities since your cruel policy was instated. I saw a sea of humanity - countless mothers who came to America fleeing violence in search of a better life for their children. They deserve due process &amp; their day in court. https://t.co/Oo95YcTBTR
Over the weekend, #TitleIX turned 46! I remain firmly committed to protecting equal opportunity for women and girls so they can participate and achieve in education free from discrimination, harassment and violence. #ProtectTitleIX
What I saw today was absolutely horrifying. I will never forget the sobs I heard from so many mothers who had been ripped apart from their babies. This is no way to solve our issues at the border. Trump caused this problem, and he MUST put forth a plan to reunite these families. https://t.co/Y3ziGgOGHu
I am horrified by what I have seen in this detention center. It is un-American to secure the border by separating mothers and fathers from their children. We have to reunite these families and do better to give them a humane living situation. What's happening is unacceptable.
They are not being updated on the news, and many of the detainees didn't even know about the new Executive Order. They are fed misinformation -- encouraged to fill out paperwork and led to believe they might then be reunited with their kids.
Women were dressed in blue jumpers, men in orange. Basically treated as criminals. One woman said she’s been in that same clothing for two weeks.
Other detainees were deported without their kids. Many at the facility are terrified that will happen to them.
One woman had her child taken on June 6. She was told it would just be for 48 hours because she was going to court. Then her child was gone. Since then she has only spoken to daughter once and doesn’t know where she is.
We met with 20-30 women who were in hysterics &amp; don't know where their kids are. Some had been there for over a month &amp; haven’t had the option to see a lawyer.
Just toured Port Isabel ICE Detention Center in TX. It was horrifying, shocking &amp; very eye-opening. Thread to follow....
My concerns about the humanitarian crisis at the border have not been alleviated. Read more about our trip here ⬇️		https://t.co/mCBeNmFYLv
Also saw many who slept in a cell with concrete floor under mylar blanket. Shoes still caked with mud. Doors of cells had signs with identifying characteristics like “male juvi 13 under”
From what I’ve seen so far at the #Texas border, there are a lot of young girls and their mothers packed into cement cell blocks. They don’t look like criminals to me, but they are definitely fleeing from criminals in their home countries.

.@realDonaldTrump continues to use NATO as a punching bag despite the crucial role they play in deterring Russian aggression and fighting global terrorism. My third amendment in #NDAA reaffirms that continued U.S. leadership in @NATO is critical to our national security
With that being said, the full range of women’s roles as victims, supporters, and preventers of terrorism is often overlooked. My second provision included in #NDAA would require U.S. strategy on countering violent extremism to account for women's roles.
The world is stronger &amp; more prosperous when women participate in conflict prevention and peace negotiations. That's why I'm pleased my amendment was included in #NDAA that authorizes @DeptofDefense to conduct research on women’s contributions to security around the world.

Safe to say bragging about “massive and powerful” nuclear capabilities doesn’t scream Nobel Peace Prize.
Now that we are in this precarious situation, I am urging @POTUS to recommit to diplomacy with North Korea and empower our State Department. A good start would be nominating an Ambassador to South Korea.
I hope the President learned that you cannot run the country &amp; diplomacy like a reality show. You have to prepare, talk to experts with all different points of view, and come to the table with specific goals in mind.
Walking away from the negotiating table is a mistake, taking us many steps backwards. We don’t know how North Korea could respond &amp; given @realDonaldTrump's belligerent rhetoric, this could even escalate to a nuclear showdown.

Whether or not Iran stays in the deal, it now has license to claim it’s null and void, and respond by restarting their nuclear program. The consequences for peace and security are serious, endangering our national security and putting our greatest ally Israel at grave risk.
Withdrawing from #JCPOA to fulfill a campaign promise is shortsighted&amp;scary, allowing Iran back on the path to a nuclear weapons capability. This decision has the potential to destabilize the region, isolate us from our Euro allies&amp;undermine American credibility around the world.
