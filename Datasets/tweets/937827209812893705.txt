@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell so do you only care about the ones that are killed by people coming across the border not the ones are actually killed here by other Americans???
@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell Actually I don't have2 read it bcuz I don't like the killing of any1! A wall WILL NOT STOP PPL FROM KILLING! Our world is in the same way as when God flooded the world, killing, robbing, adultery, hatred, etc.Unless the rapture happens 2morrow, it's not going 2 stop netime soon

@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell Well well, so do I? And as far as whatever paper you got that from isn't a widely-known paper... So I literally just fact check it through Google...
@realDonaldTrump &amp; 4 sum1 who supposedly believes in God or mayb that's just so U can get support from evangelicals! U rly need 2 look up 7 deadly sins in the Bible!&amp; U'll C U have every 1 of those inside U! Do U not know how 2 be kind 2 sum1 or R U a little kinder when U R trying 2 sleep w/Sum1?
@realDonaldTrump I didn't even know who U were really # 1st except 4 Ur apprentice show! They showed a clip the other day w/all the women who have made sexual allegations against U &amp; U act like it's bcuz Ur DJT &amp; they must want Ur $$! 1 way 2 stop a bad reputation is 3 own what U've done!
@realDonaldTrump Didn't Ur Dad/Mom teach U that lying is wrong? Bcuz it's not just wrong bcuz Ur the president it's was wrong the moment U started lying many moons ago! I truly believe U know exactly what Ur doing when U lie bcuz U do it all the time abt the smallest/BIG things, U just don't care
@realDonaldTrump With so many failed biz's, how can U call Urself a successful bizman? I heard U in an interview say I didn't say I was perfect &amp; We don't want U 2 B perfect but U could have a moral compass! U lie every day so how is any1 supposed 2 believe anything that comes out of Ur mouth?
@realDonaldTrump I personally feel that U R on a huge power Trip w/Putin standing right behind U! Haven't U learned through Ur life that U have 2 work 4 what U got? NO,  Daddy gave U $400M &amp; when I look up Ur past &amp; U know any1 can do that? you've had some really crappy luck in Ur businesses! https://t.co/lNd7rPDWhH
@realDonaldTrump Then U don't need $70B 2 build Ur wall that's already there &amp; abt $26M 2 maintain it! Y NOT B honest 4 once in Ur life &amp; let us know this whole thing was 1 of many lies U have told in Ur life! It was NOT abt the wall @ ALL! https://t.co/CIj13xQM0W

@saletan @chucktodd @margbrennan Well he'll just never get his wall! I really at this point feel like it's his wall! It cost us about $6B 4 35 days partial govt shutdown! our economy went down cuz no1 was buying anything bcuz they weren't getting pd. so just like his other biz he can let this 1 go bankrupt

CST Guards R saying most drugs R seized by them!
@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell We need to make sure that our country is safe from the enemies 1st &amp; 4most bcuz the immigrants R not our enemies, they actually add 2 our ctry! Who the hell do u think picks  vegetables &amp; fruits? They take the jobs most Americans won't do! TRUMP had a whole lot wrkin 4 him 2
@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell And that's all fine and dandy we need to take care of this BS that we're going to now with a lot of his cabinet being locked up cuz it all traitors and was sleeping with the enemy! Trading data can you have T&amp;P worried abt the dossier.. so like I said first things first!
@MikeMacAlabama @brendonmla @Casewinter13 @steph93065 @RepSwalwell IT'S FUNNY THAT U GUYS R WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRANTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR CTRY 4EVER BUT UR SURE AS HECK NOT WORRIED ABOUT PUTIN &amp; THE SAUDI PRINCE, TRUMP IS BEST BUDS W/NOW EVEN AFTER HE HAD A GUY BRUTALLY KILLED!? I'M MORE WORRIED ABT TRUMP PISSIN PUTIN OFF &amp; STARTING WAR W/US https://t.co/2de8qfr0Hw
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump And @ every1 of his rallies U don't ever hear him say NEthing kind about ne1! He's constantly calling ppl names, only 1 he hasn't called a name yet is Pelosi &amp; I wonder why that is? He's been siding w/enemies of ours &amp; that's ok with U? 🤔🤦
@TheRightMelissa @HeatherARatliff @realDonaldTrump Just bcuz he used David, Moses and others doesn't mean Trump is the chosen 1 bcuz he has every &amp; I mean every1 of the 7 deadly sins &amp; he lives in it every day! God says U shall know my people by the fruit they bear &amp;I'm sorry my sister but I don't see any good fruit on that man
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump It's ppl like u that R dividing our country by Rep/Dem, left/right, blk/white. we all need 2 stop doing that so it stops dividing us!

We weren't born 2 be left/right Dem/Repub Black/white
@a76marine @JRize75 @km_scannell @rgriesemer3 @guypbenson @RepSwalwell Bcuz they're 2 busy covering all this crap about the wall &amp; then all the lies &amp; stuff Trump tells every1 everyday! I watch about Chicago all time &amp; it did say after the new year no1shot any1.I don't know about now, the 1st wk of Jan &amp; that's a record 4 them! So it gets reported.
@JRize75 @rgriesemer3 @guypbenson @RepSwalwell There R 7 tunnels @ Arizona border &amp; when I checked this AM, it said the real price wall is $70billon plus $150billion 2 maintain it. &amp; I forget if it said monthly or yearly, i believe it said monthly 4 that $150 b! Ridiculous amt of money esp our drugs get caught by coast guards
@dirtyturd @RepSwalwell I mean really, how would they feel if every1 of the workers decided that they wanted 2 go on strike 4 the way that they've been treated. What would they do!? THEY wouldn't have any1 2 do those jobs. I'm glad Nancy Pelosi didn't cave 2 Trump's bullying! Hear is a Fear Monger!
@dirtyturd @RepSwalwell They opened it w/o the funding 4 the wall 2day.	I truly do feel bad that 800,000 Federal workers were either being furloughed w/o pay or having 2 work w/o pay &amp; it sucked! I just don't feel that anybody esp the POTUS should hold workers pay hostage.

@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Can the Dems do anything to open it up on their own??? Especially if the REPUBS are not willing to? 1.6 billion dollars is enough to get it started and stop making other people suffer from the shutdown 🤦🤦💔💔😓😓
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump And I didn't send that 2 U thinking that he could  supervise all his volunteers! They should do background chks tho! I was trying 2 show U, there's SO much 2 fix here in the US that more border security can be fixing existing structure among other things they need. $1.6 B will do
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump However Trump working 4 Putin is a Natl emergency right now! The divisiveness that we've got here is growing, ppl need 2 stop separating us into DEMS &amp; REPUBS, Black, white or left &amp; right. WE R ALL HUMAN BEINGS WANTING 2 LIVE OUR LIVES &amp; PROVIDE 4 OUR FAMILIES AS BEST AS WE CAN
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Why is it all the Dems fault? Trump has nothing 2 do with a problem that we have right now in this country? Ur ok w/him being in bed  w/Putin giving him classified info &amp; hiding his affair w/ him! The border is not our only problem here &amp; it definitely isn't a national emergency
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Once again, it doesn't matter who they worked 4, I was just telling U who they were &amp; what was happening right here in the US that Trump makes it sound like it only happens via the southern border!

@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/jxsC9LAYA3	Trump could have saved a lot of ppl stress &amp; grief over the stupid shutdown if he would've taken the $1.6 billion &amp; started there but instead he acted like a temper tantrum spoiled little boy! It definitely does not know how to run a country
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump WE NEED MORE BORDER SECURITY AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN A FREAKING WALL! WE HAVE A BARRIER RIGHT NOW! YOU CAN'T PUT SOMETHING THERE THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH EITHER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING TO BE COMING AT THE WALL.. TRUMP GOT $$ 4 THE WALL..HE DIDNT USE IT
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Just like someone said earlier do you think that this wall is going to stop that? How many American cops have killed Americans? As well as Americans have killed cops! My point is fear-mongering is not the way to get what you want and that's what Trump does!
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump By the way I wasn't deflecting! And whether this person was on a county level or a state level or whatever used to be a judge and the other one used to be a senator! Conservative at that, supposedly high morals and as we see if they want that high of morals
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump I did my research! 1 was an ex-judge, &amp; a campaign chair in KY! The other was a campaign chair &amp; x representative of Oklahoma! Not saying it's just Trump's ppl, I'm just showing U that it happened here a lot more than Trump wants us 2 believe than it does from across the border
@RealFurgas @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/hJ66sr8irX instead of the 25-year sentence that he should have gotten because it was his first time and he said he didn't intend to harm the three-year-old they gave him 10 years! Imagine if that was your daughter

@Linag33 @Franklin_Graham Then why does it seem as though people are treating the POTUS as their God &amp; not turning towards God but towards these men &amp; women in the Political realm? Their faith is being turned 2 man &amp; NOT God 🤦🤦😓😓
@Franklin_Graham I met Ur dad &amp; mom in Fort Lauderdale Calvary chapel back in the 90's! Ur dad was amazing &amp; the closest thing 2 God I had ever met! IMO, 2 be a Christian is 2 B Christ like as much as possible correct? If we sin, we're 2 repent &amp; ask 4 forgiveness means 2 turn away from sin,? RT?
@charliekirk11 @JerryFalwellJr BY UR WAY OF THINKING, REPUBLICANS WANT 2 KEEP THE RICH RICHER &amp; THE MIDDLE CLASS &amp; POOR PEOPLE LOWER!

@JoshuaDixen And help is important you are correct but you think trying to tell these two egomaniacs anything about their weight is actually going to make a difference to them because they're not listening! But other people do see Ur Tweet &amp; people with low self-esteem could take that 2 heart
@JoshuaDixen I know who it was about Josh what I am saying is it doesn't matter who it's about. What does matter is The Way We As Americans or non-americans alike talk about each other..... I don't care what people have done or not done I just want people to be kind to one another 😔
@JoshuaDixen Then as I got older it was harder 2 lose but I had to do work on myself first and foremost. Then I got diagnosed with MS and 2000 and got given chemotherapy and ACTH which is a very high potent steroid so you see not everything that you see has an easy fix
@JoshuaDixen And sometimes health is not a choice. For me when I was younger because I was a victim of heinous crimes committed Upon a Child I gained weight to keep men away from me. As I got older I did the up and down weight-wise and still wanted to keep men away from me
