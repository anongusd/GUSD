Either way, someone is paying a lot whether it be you, private insurance, or public insurance. With public insurance, you'll just have to pay more to the govt to cover it for everyone else. If you're fine with that, which some are, then work
You can solve it by putting price limits on services and products I guess, but that's in and of itself one of the absolute worst solutions imaginable.

That isn't to say Gallego couldn't win; he just has a more difficult path should Dems want to risk it by choosing him
While both have the same share undecided, it makes Gallego's job much harder if he's the nominee--assuming McSally starts mid/high-40s, Gallego not only has to get a huge share of undecideds, but pull away prior McSally voters; difficult for a liberal D in AZ
What's really notable is the starting point for McSally between the two: against Kelly she starts in roughly the mid-40s, which isn't necessarily bad but certainly isn't where you would want to start. But, against Gallego, she already almost has a majority. https://t.co/CHOyKZXQWk

Lot of safe seat freshmen or otherwise safeish Reps often file earlier so they can raise money from donors that gets sent to their party's central committee and/or dispersed to more vulnerable incumbents or to challengers in competitive seats of the other party
Well, to be 100% accurate, they might not necessarily be running again (FEC F2s allow Representatives to fundraise), but if they wanted to they've done pretty much everything to do so
More filings: Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), William Lacy Clay (D-MO), Gonzalez (R-OH), Mike Burgess (R-TX), Steve Watkins (R-KS), David Scott (D-GA)		With Lacy Clay running again in MO1 it makes it harder to Justice Dem Cori Bush &amp; scandal-ridden Rep.

4. employment opportunities for black men (ESPECIALLY for black men with a criminal record) 		The list goes on. Being "colorblind" and putting your head in the sand ignores vast inequality between different sects of the American population
There are HUGE problems that must be addressed: 1. young black men being disproportionately incarcerated for similar crimes 2. the education gap between the races 3. Redlining and subprime loans being given more in black and Hispanic communities
Being "colorblind" ignores the MASSIVE inequality there is between races and ethnicities in America (the black-white inequality being one of the largest), and you can't fix a problem you don't want to acknowledge.
Ok ok ok... seems a lot of white pols are missing this one	Being "colorblind" may sound nice in interest groups and in principle, BUT if you really wanna move forward as a nation, we have to acknowledge differences, celebrate them, and follow through w/equity https://t.co/FnPDZpxcIb

@BlueWave2020NY That's not going to happen so long as both want to wholly claim Jerusalem though. Is there a clear end in sight? I wouldn't say yes necessarily; maybe if there was some way to split Jerusalem, but that would be pretty difficult. 2/x
@BlueWave2020NY Oh yeah 100% it's a very quixotic goal for peace in the region, but I believe we'd be remiss in not trying--my personal idyllic view is that we could get more peaceful leadership of the Palestinian state as well as a less militaristic Israel. 1/x
We need to protect Israel, but we must also find a way to make sure we aren't overwhelmingly harming Palestinians in the process
Omar's tweet is messy, but I don't think the idea that the entire US government is rallied in behind protecting Israel is false (both parties have an interest in this, and rightly so), HOWEVER there needs to be debate in also preventing the massacre of civilians on both sides
Two things can be true:	1) Global left is having a problem with anti-Semitism cropping up in offshoots that must be snubbed	2) We must also find a way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict that protects and heals both of the communities in the region

I meant each PD has an infinitesimally small time for their caseload. Whoops
That they hardly have any time to review any case they go over. With more PDs hired (perhaps raising wages as an incentive) and fewer petty drug cases clogging up their time, we would have a fairer and more just criminal justice system
Furthermore, we need two things more: a complete and utter decriminalization of Marijuana and immediate release of nonviolent prisoners incarcerated for Marijuana, and also more public defenders; the current caseload each PD has is so infinitesimally small
@samzhang428 @DemocraticLuntz @k1ug3 @decunningham2 Oh my God
Our current justice system isskewed against the poor and people of color that it's ridiculous! With the prevalence of unfair profiling &amp; militaristic police forces, we need strict body camera enforcement, more community policing, and less military gear in the hands of local depts

@DrewSutton20 @SenhorRaposa Georgia Dems aren't totally inept though (which I know you are arguing), and it's just SO difficult to win there federally; Perdue is pretty popular IIRC (although so is Abrams). I do think she can win (she isn't DOA). But, Georgia is a tough nut to crack is my argument
@_Political_Nerd @SenhorRaposa @DrewSutton20 Not in recent political times
@hyperplanes @k1ug3 @decunningham2 Sounds like a fantastic idea
@DrewSutton20 @SenhorRaposa Though I would personally LOVE to see Abrams run, Georgia is prob a tier 2 senate race compared to states like NC IA CO and AZ
@DrewSutton20 @SenhorRaposa That happened primarily in states with a history of doing so (e.g. Connecticut, Mass, w/Maryland being a surprising outlier), but it's much harder to do that in a state like Georgia that hasn't elected a D federally in over a decade

@k1ug3 @decunningham2 Work requirements feel imo like they are for making the wealthy have a happier state of mind than it is at guiding the poor to "bring themselves up" imo; a lot of the time jobs are difficult for the VERY poor to find, and they often are entry-level, end-point jobs that pay poorly
@k1ug3 @decunningham2 Yeah--I am 200% for expanding the EITC, but I do feel that the impoverished need and are desperate for more income whether that be removing work requirements, simply raising check amounts, and/or building more housing to lower costs municipally
@decunningham2 What was also really interesting is that on one hand he wasn't a fan of unions, but he also favored discussing things such as a UBI and bringing back welfare pre-Gingrich's 1994 Contract for America. Very interesting man politically
@decunningham2 I really wanted to ask how he felt about Right to Work laws but I wasn't able to ask my question in time
@decunningham2 Use newer workers as bargaining chips. For instance, teachers w/30-yr tenure will be paid about 3x as much as a newer teacher because unions use these fresh faces as bargaining chips in contracts with employers. He doesn't like the emphasis on seniority 2/2
@decunningham2 We interviewed a guy who lived in poverty in my Sociology class and he discussed how he thinks unions are fantastic in principle, and he loves the unions in Nevada because they offer things such as training, but he doesn't like how most other unions 1/2
