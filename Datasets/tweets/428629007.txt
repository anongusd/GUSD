@realDonaldTrump I understand your concerns about the wall! I’m more concerned about how this Federal Shut Down is going put an hardship on us Americans!
@Semaphore89 @ulricson The thing is eventually this wall that the politicians are fighting against, will eventually start trouble for our own country!
@realDonaldTrump Yes, keep him on ice!
@realDonaldTrump I know this Wall is of much concern, but look at the facts of reality! Now, it’s effecting America! It’s effecting our well being! Its not worth a federal shut down! Politicians has to stay in tune with America, in order for us to run productively!

@IanNg5 @shalom4020 @CheapESkate @anneke_van_ver @BelindaSilva @auroraline @realDonaldTrump I also corrected my self and this explains why, I said that some people treat us like second class citizen! Your acting like a prime example!
@IanNg5 @shalom4020 @CheapESkate @anneke_van_ver @BelindaSilva @auroraline @realDonaldTrump Only God can judge me!
@IanNg5 @KMdrag @arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump I’m American!
@KMdrag @arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump I agree, but I’m afraid of a day that I will never forget 911! We have to know what’s coming in and out of our country! by every means necessary! We have to be organized and civilized!
@arlethapappas @KMdrag @realDonaldTrump See that’s the problem, many see it as a color thing, I see it as an American thing! You talk down about our POTUS, but you also took the initiative in criticizing me without even knowing me! ????
We all can agree to disagree, some people just don’t get it! But, My opinion may be different than yours! But, it’s my opinion! and your opinion is yours! You Get It! Indeed...
@arlethapappas @KMdrag @realDonaldTrump We all have right to agree to disagree! Your entitled to your opinion as well!
@Pr0popanda @realDonaldTrump I said some countries not all! Mainly mostly every where we go we need ID proof of who we are!
@shalom4020 @CheapESkate @anneke_van_ver @BelindaSilva @auroraline @realDonaldTrump I’ve corrected it if you read on to accept! But it’s clear to me that some people do get the point! Accept! I’m only human! Damn! Lol! You know what I mean!

@anneke_van_ver @BelindaSilva @auroraline @realDonaldTrump Indeed
@realDonaldTrump As Americans we have a motto to Honor! I feel we as Americans need to come together because, it’s as simple as this United We Stand, Divided We Fall....
@realDonaldTrump Etc...
@realDonaldTrump To break it down for you we can’t go no where with out proper creditials!  Papers , ID, Birth certificate, Drivers license, passports
@auroraline @realDonaldTrump I mean most countries treat Americans like second class citizens!  Where can we get citizenships in any other country with open arms?
@auroraline @realDonaldTrump Really, some countries treat us Americans like second hand citizens! But, we except most with open arms! Real Talk! And I’m not a racist! I just call it the way I see it!
@realDonaldTrump This is a problem and I’m sorry about their situation, but we as Americans can not go in no other country with out having a pass port! We have to have credentials of legitimacy! We have to have ID in our own country to work &amp; Drive!
