@ChipotleTweets I have read your food safety guidelines. YOU DO NOT HAVE A MECHANISM FOR SEPARATE HANDLING OF RAW CHICKEN AND OTHER FOODS.
@ChipotleTweets and don't tell me to contact anybody. I have done that numerous times and don't feel  you have correctly analyzed problem

@AdamAtchison Bond election DOES NOT RAISE TAXES. SHARE THIS VITAL INFO
@drshow Nice interview with Carly Simon especially the last part, sharing vulnerabilites about speech.
We do not pay you to futz over Hillary's e-mails.  Cedar Falls
@NMPBS NM PBS is the worst administered PBS station in my memory. Those FAUX fund-raiser shots are annoying esp. when it's a lady in OHIO!
@wrightr Have listened to your Fresh Air interview several times. Informative. Thanks!
@NorahODonnell Some of those folks in Frank Luntz's focus group were in his other group!! They changed clothes! What is going on??
@chimerakim Was it your intention to make the audit look so cockeyed and unprofessional? An APS administrator told me you left a lot out.
@DonMoyaABQ Just finished leaving a message with McHard Accounting LLC. Journal report summary makes them look like they had an agenda.
@chimerakim "Investigation" in to Moya? I dont think so when it uses words like "seemed" and "told by several individuals".
@NorahODonnell Director in charge of prompter should color code words that will be easily misread: Canadian County(county in red).
@NorahODonnell LOVE YOU GUYS ON CBS MORNING AND I DONT EVEN HAVE A DVR. SUGGESTION IN FOLLOWING TWEET:
@rikkijklieman Just got my dose of smart by watching you on CBS. You are a true public servant, as is your equally smart hubby.
@DrGailSaltz FYI: I have taken Prozac for 20 years and noticed that I have an elevated "startle reflex". Just file this away. Thanks
@GayleKing Your arms are looking gooooood!!!
RT @FullFrontalSamB: Voting isn't this hard, @SpeakerRyan. Extend the Zadroga Act now. #WorstResponders https://t.co/1Wwm99IRWM
@MichaelEDyson Keep up the excellent work! Maybe try to talk a little slower! :)
@charlierose PEOPLE HIDE THEIR TRUE THOUGHTS...IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. QUIET PEOPLE CAN BE RADICALS!!!
@DaveCullen Enough time had passed. I saw you on MSNBC, hated living in that neighborhood with religiosity everywhere during and after event
@chimerakim Super job of reporting on Raquel Reedy!     https://t.co/sovEXVVinG petition Raquel Reedy for Superintendent

@HouseBenghazi STATE DEPT BUSINESS USES CABLES YOU DUMB DUMB DUMMIES
@jacob4kids Editorials are completely different from reporting. Kim Burgess has done an excellent job reporting on education.
@chimerakim   which board member voted against Reedy's contract?
@USDA Get a bunch of huge football players to visit school cafeteria and have them sit down and eat their veggies. Not saying a word.
@hectorbalderass  PISS OFF ASSHOLE

@GayleKing SLEEP SOLUTION #2: listen to radio but has to be something with words so you get bored or drift off....BBC works for me age 68
@GayleKing SLEEP SOLUTION #1: we sleep in 90 min pieces so if u wake up cant get back to sleep wait for 90 min (get up do something)
@SLKinNM YOU GUYS ARE OVER THE TOP.....CALM DOWN
@kskorte Have you watched Nancy Laflin FULL interview with Valentino? Fascinating. Brad Winter introduced Valentino to gov and skandera.
@kskorte Skandera and Valentino both attended Pepperdine. Pepperdine is a red flag to me. But I am a Dem.
@kskorte I like Common Core. It's a way of raising the standards.  I don't like Skandera or Martinez.
@chimerakim    Excellent journalism Saturday article on the APS texting mess.
@Mayor_Berry    Just take the flag down, you chicken
