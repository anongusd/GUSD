@brettjensen35 U guys, and the fellows I worked with in SF, were amazingly cool about letting me get all up in your business to take photos
@brettjensen35 Would love to show you the full project someday. Feels long overdue
@brettjensen35 Yep still in Mexico City. Visit Tahoe or northern Colorado about twice a year. But both a day’s drive from SLC. Actually ...
@brettjensen35 In particular I love the shots of you smiling while a guy lifted his kid into the air; the “Utah man” portrait; and the untouched black tea
@brettjensen35 It was both long ago and very cool. We’ve both moved on a bit no? If you ever talk to Kris, Erin, Nicole or Tom Alexander tell them I say hi
@brettjensen35 Also hope we cross paths someday to catch up. Shared some cool experiences in Berlin so many years ago :)
@brettjensen35 Hope it’s cool I msg u when Utes play. I’m an observer of PAC-12 without really having a team of my own. Just enjoy conference play
