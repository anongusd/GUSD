The only item that the demoRats complained about is the fear he may over turn Rove v Wade. I don't think he will. But, aborting an unwanted baby because it's the wrong sex or an inconvenience. That's just plain wrong! If it can live outside the womb, it's murder. K. G. https://t.co/mMR552aqO7

Of it until I started trying to French kiss my mom and dad also drew Mickey Mouse with male parts and male breasts. I didn't  know about those things. But I clearly recall the assault to this. I knew he was a neighbor. Can't recall his name though.
I know she sounded creditable. However, she couldn't name when, where and much of anything. I beleive she is either a pathological lier or it happened and someone else did it to her. I was 5 when I was sexually assaulted. Knew who, where, and my parents were unaware https://t.co/ovjpmLXqek

It happened to me more than once when I was young. But, he's 81 and with one kick in his mess or a chop in the throat he'd be incapacitated. That's the way I feel, my friend. K. G. https://t.co/GfaDQddbWX
My friend, it did more than once. I just feel if he were younger,  jail yes. But his age, one kick in his " mess " would stop him or a chop in the throat, etc. I know how to defend myself now. Won't happen again. K. G. https://t.co/GfaDQddbWX
Na! Don't beleive it unless he was severely impaired by alcohol or drugs. One can't he read ? The door to the restroom is easy to open than an outside door to a pressurized cabin door. K. G. https://t.co/up3TDVS1Fu
He is now a convicted sex offender. Psychologist said he's likely to re offend. That said, couldn't he have been sentenced to house arrest with an ankle bracelet? He's 81 years old. I know his victim feels safer with him in prison. Anyone feel the same? K. G. https://t.co/Pgtn8PoYUy
Why didn't he have house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I know if allowed out w/o being secured the psychologist stated he could re -offend, that's why the jail time. But, he is an old man and just be convicted as a sex offender +. I think is enough. Anyone? K. G. https://t.co/U6aN1Hppag
This is the beginning of what they plan to do with the constitution and every part of our laws. Need to stop them now. K. G. https://t.co/RSX5uMeYxw
Why don't they install razor wire on top of the wall ? Many coming are not from South America, Mexico but from the Middle East, setting up camps to kill Americans then hiding in sanctuary cities or states. That's who we need to stop. K. G. https://t.co/0HSRDb3Yfc

They will try every trick in the book until one of their higher echelon people is accused of major felonies. Then they won't want it then. I believe the Judge in full. And, radical Judge says he is without doubt a gentleman w/o question. So, no evidence, no charges. K. G. https://t.co/1KE83lnf0m

I read it in whole. The Judge has a very good point. We can't allow those who assume he will over turn Roe v Wade. I doubt very much he will, there are other Judges on the bench.

I don't think so. The South voting to leave the Republic in 1860. The Civil War to free the "negros " from slavery in the south. And that's why DemoRats hate Republican Party. K. G. https://t.co/SwNNCHqYQ3

Sen. Fienstein: what did all of you DemoRats do to the women at the time President Clinton was in power? He lied under oath, his wife crucified those innocent women. There was DNA evidence as well. And all of you have the nerve to attack the Judge? Shame on you! K. G. https://t.co/L0g4dEbwKs

When you under go a FBI back ground. They ask everyone and I mean everyone he knew as a child, teenager and adult, and every time he's advanced. So, why wasn't this brought up at anytime. The FBI may have interviewed her. Don't know, they need to check back into it. K. G. https://t.co/RD5uvqoSlX

He'd loose his job if the President pulled his class Security Clearance. He couldn't get a job anywhere, where one type is required. That's what the President needs to do to all of them. Then, we'll see them have something to whine about. K. G. https://t.co/A6MzKZOqQW
@LadiesOfLivePD @DeputyPoundsSRO Oh no, you will be sorry. I had mine cut when it was that long. It's back down there now. It's a pain at times, but I love it. Sleep on it and wait a week. At the Victorian Trading they have a book for long hair and jewelry to put in it. Look on line in Kansas. K. G.
Have a nice trip back to your war zone shit hole. K. G. https://t.co/Tr5hFrP5Jq

Okay, Brooklyn is part of New York. My mom was born there. My brother in Manhattan. I went to the city once a week for work at the Stock Exchange and major Banks.

Have a good safe week my friends. May G_d watch over you and your families, Amen. K. G. https://t.co/UxuEUFBIT7
They really think they are that important to the country. When writers went on strike we survived the whole thing. Didn't have withdrawals or threaten to kill ourselves. You entertain us, nothing more. You don't heal the sick or save a child from a burning house. Okay ? K. G. https://t.co/YzTQNwM7dN
A lot of them live in New York. All over the state. Most are hard working people and don't act like the world owes them a living. K. G. https://t.co/goXBDc9EUL
That's what perverts do. Right in front of everyone, knowing she won't say anything at the time. So her skirt is short she has the body for it. Can't stand very heavy girls &amp; woman in to tight an outfit. She is just right. K. G. https://t.co/3rWdNs1U0Z
They wouldn't have done so much to hide it, but, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Thanks for giving us another suggestion. Have a nice weekend, my friend. K. G. https://t.co/nD7RHUPtWh

So, what was the President suppose to Do? He let ingrate McCain's family use Air Force 2. Now, DemoRats have not acklodged his kind actions. The President let him use the plane he was not entitled to use. He wanted Air Force one as President. It was 2nd., best. K. G. https://t.co/dYB1tS4MN3

With her being in support of illegal aliens, she was probably friendly to him as a caring friend and he took it wrong. And, she was brutally murdered. The people who support these illegal aliens have all the butchered people's blood on their their hands. K. G. https://t.co/1GvwlsEXkS

He was a senator why didn't his family pay for it ? Especially after the hate speach his family gave the President. They could have put this feud behind them mentioning that President Trump sent his family plane to escort him to his burial spot. I don't get it. K. G. https://t.co/E2fPT1zNGM

@IngrahamAngle @SHERRYLGODFREY1 @JohnBrennan Mr. Brennan, what are you smoking? You need to watch Fox and your favorite news programs. See how they play part of a sentence that if listened in full makes a difference in what is said. Please don't listen to others comments. Listen to your own heart. K. G.

At first I thought it was against our President Trump. But, when I read the tweets I understand. Hitting a sitting president from the grave. That's like a horror movie. Trying to blame him for his mess he left. Good try McCain, doesn't work. K. G. https://t.co/pgnFWqDGdm
I'll beleive that when I see it. Being President Trump's star they will slap his Hans, be a good boy.  K. G. https://t.co/wBcu7UocLR

Oh my friend, they haven't been found 'not guilty' a big difference. My fear is they disappear without a trace until a shooting or bombing. Is that DA a DemoRat or leftist Republican? They let a terrorist group go free for the time being. K. G. https://t.co/c1wJBcnFgI
Sorry, I saw on Fox this am. The prosecutor failed to either show or paperwork ! He's is going to refile charges. We owe the judge an apology for the DA's error. What a screwed up mess! Meanwhile, they could disappear &amp; never be found again. K. G. https://t.co/khHbbvNSla

I couldnt watch the end. Where is animal control, ASPCA, etc. Their Reglion is, not part of our culture, letting animals suffer. They treat their woman just like this. And, we should let them stay here. ?   K. G. https://t.co/GlMoZEm9CZ

New York is a mess ! Not the city I loved to work and visit. I would be afraid to visit now. Just too much nonsense going on. K. G. https://t.co/5btXFyrkAt
What do they think will happen when they learn you have been soft reporting on this  awful homicide? Did you see the crime scene photos? That could be your daughter, sister, mom, etc. The horror of it . Her last minutes. Think !  K. G. https://t.co/f37a3rftgI

Are they not building the wall now? I saw on Tweeter part of the wall. They said he'd been in the U. S. for a few years now. So, who did he work for ? Or, did he survive on stealing and robbing his neighbors. K. G. https://t.co/e9QcMpWFy1
If, however she happens to win, they need to check the voting machines. I can't fathom how they think the way they do. I just don't get it. K. G. https://t.co/XbBc5vAVtn
Jeez, my heart missed a beat or two. They credit the President with ridding New York of a former Natzie.?  Wow, need to put that in a book. Thank you for you and families service. K. G. https://t.co/53BZyGcc1J
Well, the old ' fart ' is well enough to vote, he's well enough to come to work.!!!  K. G. https://t.co/WToIU0Nae7
I would donate w/o  being able to deduct it on taxes. One of my family members maybe next to be murdered. If, we all donated $20.00 twenty dollars that would be a nice down payment. K. G. https://t.co/aaHzJTKARW
I beleive L. E. Should send crime scene photos to those in California who want the illegal aliens left alone. With a note; what if this was your child, grandchild, etc. Damn you all to hell!  K. G. https://t.co/SKoWDUi02b

I know you mean well. Thank you for the daily prayers. I beleive they don't beleive in G_d. So, they don't fear Him. They think once they die they go no where. I'd like to see them when the meet G_d and try to talk their way out of it. K. G. https://t.co/zVH4EwNIfV
So, lady it's the Law Enforcement's fault that Americans R being murdered. No, it's your fault they are killing, stealing, anything that comes to mind. Because, YOU make all kinds of excuses for them. Typically a lawyer's lie to get their client off. K. G. https://t.co/5M90WJ7lA1
Mr. Woods you tell the truth always. G_d Bless you!  K. G. https://t.co/P54xN1QYMY
That's just sick ! They could have killed someone, now that is not funny! K. G. https://t.co/vXDnJWh1bn
What are they smoking ? Or shooting up ? They don't care about us at all. How can a human being feel that way about a dead young collage student in the prime of her life, cut down by a heartless illegal alien who's been here for years. Who did he work for? K. G. https://t.co/yqWX9kVIfc
Amen! They don't give a sh*t about us at all. If they win, it will get worse! Remember that always. K. G. https://t.co/LANxrQzYxh
Andrew Cuomo says the illegal aliens are more important than any of we legal Americans. And Our President Trump doesn't care about those illegals. No, dude he cares about we Americans (legal).  So, hope you enjoy your tour, it's your last. K. G. https://t.co/1K1c5qg6tD
I don't know if the DemoRats are just stubborn or really believe they are correct with regards to the illegal aliens. How many must be murdered, assaulted, etc., before they admit they are wrong ?  K. G. https://t.co/5dFaCxEO8A

I know she's white !  K. G. https://t.co/oRqgBopIHy
I hope the obnoxious ' person' realizes she just committed an assault with a weapon. Is that handle metal, the end ? Now we know why so many are shot in Mi. They can't stand the truth. I'd ask the ` lady ' what did Oboma do for you ? More welfare, etc. ?  K. G. https://t.co/oRqgBopIHy
What is going on there ? Perhaps the Mayor will as the President to send in the Guard. The Mayor has to ask first. K. G. https://t.co/yD6LXoCsX0

When we worked, we were assured that we would have Medicare when we retired. We paid into it for years. It's being drained by illegal aliens. Who have not paid into the system. Therefore, not intitled to anything, period!  K. G. https://t.co/BeqJOknDKN

I wouldn't call it throwing under the bus. We don't know what was said or accused, etc. Perhaps, this is his way of getting this all out. Someone, was running this. The snakes head must be cut off from the rest of the body to kill it. K. G. https://t.co/NiBqEjUP6C
Yes ! K. G. https://t.co/gnAvduiRIg
He better have a case in law to reverse himself. The President needs to Fire him too ! It is a law, they are illegal aliens. End of story, this judge is treating this as his personal feelings. I feel for them living in squalor, but we have laws!.  K. G. https://t.co/eAhGUIcgSu
Good for you Mr. President. Fire them all. They are hurting our country. Trators!  K. G. https://t.co/ulfx625fQc

@SenateDems If they are hiding anything can't be as bad as what you all have been hiding. You have some nerve !!! K. G.
Thank the Lord he could return to work. I'm not sure I could do that. I'm terrified of lightning. Nearly struck three times. Close enough to cause burns like hot grease from frying bacon. I imagine they feel like I would in a thunderstorm in a field in a iron suit. K. G. https://t.co/hVyIjfrrjF
I beleive the K-9 when they retire should go to a handler they worked with. I beleive animals have dreams and nightmares. The experienced handlers will know what they are going through.  G_d  Bless  all of you!  K. G. https://t.co/6fRfQNkvrM

He and his parents belonged to a cult. All the young children had to bleach their hair white. If he wasn't in the cult now, he would let his hair grow its natural color. Just a thought. K. G. https://t.co/MqkQtKFzQR

Doners are going to get tired of supporting loosers Like Anthony Weiner. He and his Wife Huma Aberdin raised runs for his bid for N.Y. Mayors race and would have won if he could quit taking pics., of himself holding his private parts. Then a 15 yr. old girl. K. G. https://t.co/tUp2XZj3wF
Has anyone heard of the Spanish Inquisition? Well, the Pope's Reglious Order was the sponsor for it. Even further back people were burned alive at the stake, imprisoned for years for nothing they thought they had done, but the church thought so. K. G. https://t.co/b3wzc3ZPZl

I beleive if the President shuts it down to early, they will claim he did it because they got close to "their" truth he's guilty. He knows what he's doing, give him time. K. G. https://t.co/fKTJvFLlmH
