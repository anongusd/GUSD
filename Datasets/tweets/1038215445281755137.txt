@maahumkhn @Roguebeauty912 That's fair. I agree, in adolescence, much of a child's views reflect those of their parents. I'd argue that in middle school children begin to form their own views. The important thing is to teach them critical thinking. Nothing inherently wrong about teaching them your ideals.
@maahumkhn @Roguebeauty912 I disagree. Even pushing something in an extreme or aggressive way isn't forcing your opinion. You can't force someone to think a certain way. Also what about this post was aggressive or extreme? The kid asked for it.
@Roguebeauty912 @maahumkhn You can't force an opinion onto someone. You can present them with an idea, but it's up to them whether or not to accept it. And 10 years old is about the age I started to formulate my own opinions on life. You just gotta think for yourself.

2/2 But you can't completely disregard everything someone says just because they're racist. There's merit in sifting through a person's ideologies and separating the good from the bad. Though it shouldn't have to be said, I will anyway, I'm not defending Hitler in any way lol
First off that's not what @RealCandaceO said. Secondly, a major fallacy of the left is that once a person is a nazi or Hitler EVERYTHING they said is then discredited. Maybe Hitler did have some good ideas obviously the mass murder of Jews wasn't one of them. 1/2 https://t.co/69leom8w6o
