Maybe some piece of the wreckage will be large enough to float. Maybe some form of democracy will survive. The promise of America.🇺🇸
The time for averting the shipwreck has passed. The Promise is finished. In the history of human follies, this is the worst. The most we can do now is toss the captain and his lackeys overboard, try to slow the rate of collision.
The Republicrites have taken over the ship. They have broken into the provisions, given each other raises, distributed the guns and opioids. It is the best of times.
Told about the alarms, he declares that he is smarter than all the admirals. “Don't pay attention to those flashing things! How do you like my clown suit? It's gold! A Saudi prince gave it to me! ”
The rise in drought, hurricanes, floods, fires, famine, failed states, refugees, and extinction is just beginning. Imbeciles in power, children in cages, totalitarianism, the avalanche of lies, disruption, revolution, civil war; it is just beginning.
