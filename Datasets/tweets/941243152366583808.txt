@AP @apbuf It's shocking to me that people think trained individuals with guns WOULDN'T deter shooters. Surveys of prison populations have made it extremely clear that criminals are terrified of armed civilians and avoid them at all cost. High school psychopaths are no different.
@north021884 The NRA donates to politicians who already support people's freedom to defend themselves. They don't need to bribe them.
@JelenaLisavac Nobody has a ‚Äúright to be safe.‚Äù You have the right to protect yourself to the best of your ability. You have the right to make YOURSELF safe.
@altman_angela @CNN Not certain on type-of-gun parameters for that study. Regardless, most gun homicides are committed with handguns, as well as most self-defense gun use.
@JelenaLisavac I can't even comprehend the level of statism necessary to believe that the government -- not you -- is responsible for your own safety.
@altman_angela @CNN That statistic is from More Guns, Less Crime by John Lott.
@altman_angela @CNN John Lott estimates over 2.5 million Americans use their guns in self-defense a year. I'd argue that well over half of those instances were life-threatening.
@CNN Armed citizens are already saving over a million lives a year with their guns. Protection and self-defense are marvelous things.
@FoxNews If we started punishing suicide with the death penalty, we could stop suicide in its tracks.
Is it possible (just possible) that the NRA isn't bribing politicians, they're just donating to politicians that oppose strict gun-control?	Nah, according to all those catchy protest chants on CNN, they just want to kill kids. Makes perfect sense.	#GunControlNow #StudentsStandUp
@JoyAnnReid Teachers actually average over $50k a year and when you consider hourly totals (teachers have 3 months off a year) they make more than most architects and software engineers.
@dianelgeary @NickBrownCO @thehill The Senate is actually planning to pass a nation-wide "cancer ban" in 2018 that will save millions.
@NickBrownCO @dianelgeary @thehill Some could argue that if you prevent someone from acquiring a gun and they are subsequently murdered, you've denied them their right to life. See how "right to life" doesn't equal "right to get rid of things people sometimes use to hurt other people?"
@NickBrownCO @joemac1114 @Limbstan @thehill "Not a risk. Just throw that argument out."	Geez, I'm convinced.
@thehill Teachers can't be trusted with guns! They can only be trusted with caring for 20+ children all day and giving them the useful knowledge necessary to nourish their young minds while guiding them safely through childhood. But not guns.
Suffering =/= credibility.		#CNNTownHall #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #StudentsStandUp
@thehill Because being safe isn't a right. Defending yourself is. Next.
@realDonaldTrump News flash: government regulation almost never keeps anyone safe.
@jordie_ray Just the Left militarizing frightened children for political gain. Not sure if it's fishy, or just unethical, disgusting, and highly predictable.
Waiting for a SINGLE policy proposal from the Left that has potential to stop school shootings.		...still waiting.	#ParklandStudentsSpeak #ParklandShooting #BanAssaultWeapons
@NBCNews ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt support militarizing confused kids to disarm law abiding citizens and upend constitutional freedoms, you don‚Äôt care about kids!‚Äù	-The Left
@JoyAnnReid @NRA Hopefully they‚Äôll organize and finally BAN guns in schools! If we had a big sign that said ‚ÄúNo Guns‚Äù outside every school, murderous criminals wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance!
@FoxNews Fact: 40% are patently insane.
@funder #BanMachineGuns		...We did. Anything else?
@KamalaHarris Yeah, I'm so sick of congressmen saying we don't have enough gun violence.
Teaching angsty teens the ways of self-congratulatory freeloading and conquering the cognitive dissonance of loving Mcdonalds but hating capitalism (whatever that is) since 1848! https://t.co/jL9DIyHUBv
@Zeddary I hate to align myself with any jowl-wiggling from Bill O'Reilly, but his opinions on gun legislation are still more valid than a catatonic 15-year-old's.
@JYSexton Your wordy, solecistic articles give me indigestion.
@CNN Your first mistake was expecting the government to protect you.
@CNN The Left:	"None of these assault accusations seem to stick! It's like everyone already knows Trump a scumbag and they just don't care! The only thing left to do is exhaust every resource we've got and stick to the same exact failing strategy. It's fucking foolproof."
If you think there's even a CHANCE dyslexic facebook ads, racist twitter-bots, and nude @BernieSanders coloring books affected the presidential election, you must not think very highly of the American intellect. 		...I think there's a pretty good chance. https://t.co/P5x3ZVZpiH
@rejects Fortunately, what you "know in your heart" holds no water whatsoever legally.
@JoyAnnReid Kids 5-18 have less than one in a million chance of dying in a school shooting. Instead of guns, I suggest we focus on banning stuff that REALLY kills kids, like bathtubs, plastic baggies, and cut-up hot dogs.
@FoxNews "Research the effects of porn"	You must mean taxpayer-funded masturbation sessions. 	...For safety.
@SwampRob @CharlesMBlow Yeah, over 2,000 people dying a fiery death hundreds of feet in the air is totally comparable to creating a few pro-Trump twitter-bots. Totally.
@DineshDSouza if you're going to make "too soon" jokes, they've got to be funny. It's either going to be edgy, or make you the most hated man in America. Unfortunately for you, it's the latter.
@thehill You don't think Russia has any OTHER motivation to disarm American citizens? Nah, probably just trying to "divide" us.
@NBCNews This is so disgusting. It's pretty obvious the raffle winner will be a latent serial killer and using his new AR-15 will kill the entire baseball team before holding the coach's family hostage and using them to ransom $150,000 and a helicopter to Cuba.
@CharlesMBlow How often are people confiding in you about their spouse being lost at sea?
@politico @POLITICOMag Using confused, traumatized kids to push your political agenda in the wake of a tragedy is certainly a classy move.
The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy without a gun because he destroyed it on youtube.	#preventdefense #justcallthecops #GunReformNow #GunControlNow https://t.co/f1Qv25l6tj
@thehill Good to see someone standing up against responsible gun ownership! After all, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy who's destroyed his own gun.
@FoxNews @FBI Government department answering to the DOJ not concerned with politics.	Fucking right.
@JoyAnnReid @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump FDR put thousands of Japanese-Americans in internment camps for years. But yeah, no, Trump is the worst.
@funder The chances of Trump resigning are lower than those of Trevor Noah making a human being laugh on purpose.
@NBCNews Let's definitely take policy advice from emotionally traumatized teenagers. Definitely.
@funder I colluded with the facts to comprehend that collusion isn't a federal crime.
@NBCNews Yeah. Ok. https://t.co/DCuHWLcl7b
@NBCNews He posted on youtube under his own name that he aspired to be a "professional school shooter." 	The lesson is, follow your shitty kid on youtube so you can foil their murderous shenanigans before 17 people lose their lives.
@NBCNews Meanwhile, 1/3 of mass shootings are committed by someone prohibited from owning guns. Peace through gun regulation is a dream within a dream within a bagel.
@AliVelshi @NBCNews Hopefully his neck-skin will finish consuming his face before he does anything too stupid.

@BuzzFeedNews He refused to sell his gun, so he gave it to the police: now they can sell it instead! This man is a hero.
@provenself As a Puerto Rican lesbian transexual hamster, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
@CharlesMBlow Comparing 9/11 and Pearl Harbor to an election hack. Reasonable......highly reasonable...
@NormOrnstein Yeah, we should just BAN guns in schools!		...oh wait.
@zoo_quiz "Who can guess..."	Implying you have to guess...? Shame!
@kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid Kyle, instead of summarizing the article you merely posted the same quote it was originally posted with. I'm starting to doubt you're equipped to assess the credibility of the things you read.
@EdKrassen Hilary Clinton has sent 12 tweets in the last 24 hours.	She's addressed mass shootings, feminism, gun control, and her new book. 		SHE DIDN'T ATTACK THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE!!!!		Let that sink in.
@AriMelber Actually, Christian Bale's voice has gone hoarse from years of screaming at other castmembers for just looking at him.
@TheUndefeated I get all my political advice from Lebron James because he went to high school.
@nytimes Stay alert: the culprit is likely a brainwashed, Aryan 9-year-old without the slightest idea what a swastika looks like.
