@67jewelCDH @rhiles2760 Yes. &amp; If he does, the chance of that happening might also enable me to suddenly fly around whatever room I’m in
@AubreyEl1 @cspanwj @realDonaldTrump *Side note on my Tweets here; This is all said without forgetting Otto Warmbier. Kim knew and Trump taking him "at his word" is a failure of itself; to Otto, his family, and America. Just like taking Putin for his word that it wasn't Russia
@AubreyEl1 @cspanwj @realDonaldTrump Yea I can agree, I won't contest that..Just wishful thinking on my end.. Whatever happens, if anything, will take time
@AubreyEl1 @cspanwj @realDonaldTrump I agree- the US-SK joint training is a hit, but it can always be immediately reimposed..and we aren’t withdrawing any of the 30k USforces from SK..As long as Trump can keep the door open and not give up anything more, maybe a real leader can close in on a real deal someday🤷🏻‍♂️
@dogcanyon @cspanwj I agree, he doesn't know what he talks about on most things imo..and I know the Peace Prize thing is also talked about..just looking at the bigger picture. No praise for Trump but not condoning it
@cspanwj Not a Trump person, one. bit. But I see reaching out to N.Korea is a necessary evil, talking to Kimmy Jong Un. It will be a long process..but not talking to only keeps the millions of suffering N.Koreans closed off to ANY hope. Also, Dennis Rodman will come in for the rebound
@RepGosar The more I love America, the more I hate Trump. It’s reciprocally proportionate
RT @TheEconomist: Why is Vladimir Putin invested in the survival of Nicolás Maduro's regime? https://t.co/OlCNXJUUTf
@realDonaldTrump Don't worry about Cohen - you already said we shouldn't? focus on working on world peace (Prizes). Side note, I can agree on regarding talking to Kimmy Jong Un, but not praising him..
@DavidWohl I know, forthcoming Defectors are scary. Hang in there @DavidWohl you've got this. Btw, change your passwords, @JacobAWhol {&lt;-RIP to his page(s)} might try to login
@DavidWohl I agree that attacks are wrong..But a “malicious” flag attack..?
@NBCNews "I should have chosen words that don't land me in a different suit with stripes" @RepMattGaetz https://t.co/R6xATDZmG8
@WhiteHouse Trump's dinner strategy: "Mr. Kim, America has a truhhhmendous line of defense..I mean, nukes would overcook these like you've never seen before." Kim promptly agrees to disarm and Trump wins #NobelPeacePrize on. the. spot. He then hurries home to hug @RepMattGaetz https://t.co/pSMh2Mnj6N
@krassenstein MSNBC better be careful, the man-baby @RepMattGaetz established that the word "test" is a synonym for "tampering"
RT @waltshaub: @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(b), 1515(a)(1)(B).
@SheForest @DonaldJTrumpJr Didn't mention them but okay! I love America and our original voting instituions
@DonaldJTrumpJr Crazy stuff..It's almost like running a race with closed-door Russian meetings, floods of troll-based fake news, and a team of later-to-be-jailed hacks as coaches...so unfair

@realDonaldTrump Ok good..I was waiting for @realDonaldTrump’s America-condolence  tweet so we can all forget about this and move on..like we’re supposed to. But don’t forget about the duct-taped mouths at the border!
@DavMicRot There was no evidence of duct tape on mouths so is doesn’t warrant need crisis-emergency attention from @realDonaldTrump

In reply to @Kasparov63's tweet on mounting damage:#WinterIsComing. p53 "There is an irresistible tendency to look only for big moments in history" .."long-term trends and patterns usually matter more".."it is important to look at how each moment fit into an overall pattern."

@JoePerticone The best part of this tweet is that yes, it grabbed Phish and Deadheads’ attention..but they started talking about music with each other in the comments💀🌹⚡️
@business That’s unfortunate, many scrapped Trump hotel plans, Maybe Try Moscow again?
@HillaryWarnedUs @rhiles2760 @MSNBC https://t.co/h32wnXR2Ue
@seanhannity He had two years with a GOP majority in both House and Senate to do so. It became an 🚨Emergency🚨 as that changed. “I will have Mexico pay for the Wall, Mark my words”” @realDonaldTrump..Even if..Why would we rely on a foreign country to pay for ANy national crisis? Oh wait..

@Kasparov63 Such a globally recurring pattern. Although they come to boil at different temps and timeframes, the rights of those under the tyrants will always organically pop the lid
@j_gelling @BillOReilly You got me..I actually am a bit paranoid about the integrity of our democracy's ability to act without foreign influence, which as been confirmed and is still in the works ..Maybe this not as warranted as scary buses on the border, but time will tell
@j_gelling @BillOReilly Facts are important, yes. But Paranoia is also an emotion, triggered by Trump’s tactics to maintain the blind followers..kindof like Putin

@thehill Russia cultivated @realDonaldTrump over a long period of time, along with many individuals who got onboard the campaign later on as well.. It's worth a long and fair investigation for the sake of democracy..if nothing comes of it after it's concluded, so be it. But idk about that
@JackPosobiec uh oh. A ❄️ was born
@BillOReilly Yes, should be investigated, I agree 100%. But deep down, I can't help but know you're thinking it could be a book opportunity since there isn't anything better for @BillOReilly to write about https://t.co/sq056yYLk6
