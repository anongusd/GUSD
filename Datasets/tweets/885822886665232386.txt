@jnd4588 @RealSonsof @KamalaHarris Medicare for all is a joke. Ppl like Kamala in WDC will exempt themselves like they did for ACA and make the rest of us live in a endless hell. The VA is a total mess ask any military person. VA just a snapshot of the socialize HC BS. And abortion in killing funded by tax payers
@jnd4588 @RealSonsof @KamalaHarris The only ppl that made it harder for you to get healthcare is Democrats.  Stop your spinning game. The Republicans just want to stop paying for killing babies. Get you drama story straight.
@jnd4588 @RealSonsof @KamalaHarris Not attacking your reproduction rights, or assaulting women so get off your spin game lady not playing it. The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. No one wants to take that from you. Drama!!
@RealSonsof @jnd4588 @KamalaHarris The gov is paying for adortions because if it wasn‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation. You can spin it any way you want.
