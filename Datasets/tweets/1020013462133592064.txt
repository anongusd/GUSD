@MBuhari Don't ever be deceived by that hired crowd, there will be no vote for there. What did you do for the people #mrfailedpromises
@MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo It is a shame that the president could be talking about next level when he was not able to deliver 1% of all his electoral promises the previous time. That next level should be for you and your cronies because Nigerian would seek a better alternatives.

@karribland12 Do you really think that the state can do much when it comes to bringing this people to book?
@karribland12 usually refuse to return.
@karribland12 surnames, i tend to be very skeptical about issues like this. The government have also claimed that RSSDA have a condition that requires that any trained person would return back to the state to add to man power which was usually violated as so many of the trained persons
@karribland12 Is it possible that the students publish their names and the name of their parents so that the people can use such name to counter the government's claims if it be false? Because for someone like me whom growing up saw the substitution of qualified people with people who have

@karribland12 Really sad, but i thought that the governor said that the RSSDA programs were no longer sustainable given that the political class has used their wards to cover up spaces that was made for the best brains in Rivers state.
@NigeriaInfoPH The Man city @ManCity vs Man @ManUtd game would definitely gothe side of the blue side of Manchester @ManCity
@elrufai aEl-rufai have suddenly become drunk with the blood of the innocent. A man who used a state's money to pay terrorist is not fit to be a governor and cannot hold any public office in saner clans.
@feggeborn @aishambuhari Hahahahaha..........
@aishambuhari Please madam, what did you use to honor them? I thought it should have been a Nigerian thing and Kannywood.
@DailyPostNGR Can somebody please advice this old demented fellow that the days of APC are numbered.
@olushola_shola The presidency have a lot to hide but only time shall tell. This people have a confidentiality too heavy for them to handle. The APC people who are aware of this must stop threat and talk if they love Nigeria and Nigerians more than self.
@NGRPresident You are a total fraud, what is 10000? Why should it be now that election is around the corner? What type of business can you start with 10000 @ProfOsinbajo?. Please why is the account not verifiable? APC is a scam
@KunleAyo8 @smoochieey once shared cannot be retrieved. The name of an organization was mentioned and that is a great deal in law especially if the information turns out not to be entirely true. I have seen such cases and that was why i asked question. Am not against you speaking up
@KunleAyo8 @smoochieey Am not and will not feel insulted, from the part of the world where am from insult to people especially for asking questions is normal. I love the fact that you spoke up. I do not believe in cover up but i always support proper investigation because information
Super Falcons deserve support. #flyeaglesfly. We are demolishing Mimosas https://t.co/ojR0sMc7yN
@smoochieey @KunleAyo8 The man who brought the story earlier told us that the staff and students have been instructed to shield the person and later the same person who was been shielded was arrested. Hoax!, i was actually trained to ask questions so as to not condemn innocent people
@smoochieey @KunleAyo8 No insult to you once again, i would not even be tempted to take to insult. I have seen where people are accused wrongly and because it is a very sensitive matter people let their emotions get better of them. No one supports rape, it is a crime. But proof
@smoochieey @KunleAyo8 I do not insult  people. Please was he there? If the answer is please, he cannot tell people to help him retweet what he have not verified. What of if this turns out to be false?
@KunleAyo8 Have you investigated the matter or you just want people to to retweet such a serious matter? Attach a video to show authenticity of your claims. Please let's be wise
I have said it before that APC administration is the greatest fraud that a nation can witness. https://t.co/xOPvXiDI1s

@SEzekwesili Give him money if have and stop complaining or bringing such frivolous complaint to public domain.
@AMADICHIMA This Adetola must be a senile for making such a useless allegation against the East. He lacks respect and must be one of those he goats trying to instigate crises in the south east.

@Seedgate @MBuhari is a fraud, i was misled to supporting him. It is over, i voted for him because i thought that he had integrity.
@MBuhari Shame Mr. President that until now, you are still talking of "will". We want to see what is on ground not what will come. We came out in mass 2015 to vote for you because we needed change but you have failed. @MBuhari

@PremiumTimesng I just believe that this man is just a joke
Nkosi sikelel iAfrika was always the chant in the fight against white domination meaning God Bless Africa, but now Africa leaders have become so embroiled with marginalization of fellow Africans. I wonder what the chant should be?

Watching the frenzy that always surrounds the name Nelson Mandela and attitude of the black race especially Nigerians when an issue of extra stretch for general good is out, one keeps wondering if the only two courageous men of African decent are Madiba and Kanu.
