@DanRiehl People consume media differently today.  They get their news from Twitter and Facebook.  They get their opinions from the newspaper or cable.
@DanRiehl Well that's a good point, especially about smaller outlets.  But I think ideological balance, if it ever really occurred, was more about efforts to capture share of the marketplace than any other factor.
@DanRiehl I guess my point is that the media, from the very beginnings of our Republic to William Randolph Hearst to today, was never about getting to the truth as much as selling newspaper (or clicks) or advocating for a particular candidate.  We have a free press, but not a fair press.

So this is where we are as far as I can tell.  The Democrats now say that the reason Kavanaugh shouldn’t be confirmed is because he lied when he said he never blacked out while drinking in college.  How do they prove that he is lying? I don’t know.

The idea that Democrats would actively work to give Trump a victory on tax reform is preposterous.   Hence the reason the GOP has to go alone on it.
