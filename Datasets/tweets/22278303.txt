Thanks for sticking with me. The title of today's Senate hearing is an apt one, "Not forgotten." As journalists, we too have an obligation to make sure we cover what happens in nursing homes. Here's hoping our tool helps. https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN /end
Here's another one written with the help of our tool: Popular Blood Thinner Causing Deaths, Injuries at Nursing Homes https://t.co/VkxjcdvEPD 11/x
To give a couple examples, here's a story I wrote using our tool showing how nursing home staff take lewd and inappropriate photos of residents and share them on Snapchat. https://t.co/Hiov9ntod8 and our list of 65!!! incidents since 2012. https://t.co/qFI0JYu3ze 10/x
So much more can be gleaned from our Nursing Home Inspect tool. It's helpful for journalists, researchers, consumers and, dare I say, even regulators. You can compare homes and even use our keyword search to see which homes have gotten cited for particular problems. 9/x
Nursing homes in New Mexico, Kentucky, Arkansas and Texas have more serious deficiencies per home, on average, than any other state. Are you a journalist in one of those states? Have you asked about it? https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN 8/x https://t.co/98gCBI4g8b
All of these nursing homes have been fined MORE THAN $750,000 in recent years! Journos, do you cover an area where one of them is? Have you written about it? https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN https://t.co/ecpyXxeYqZ
Here's a list of the homes with the most immediate jeopardy citations in recent years. Journos, do you cover an area where one of them is? Have you written about it? https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN 6/x https://t.co/PEofIdvvcz
Take, for instance, River Haven Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Paducah, Kentucky. It has been cited for **23** immediate jeopardy violations in recent years. That means inspectors had serious concerns about resident health and safety. https://t.co/hTp48e6GQT 5/x
This is really important. While some nursing home metrics are self reported, government inspectors are our eyes and ears in the facilities. Some problems they found are truly shocking. https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN 4/x
Unlike many tools, ours focuses exclusively on the results of nursing home inspections, on homes cited for severe deficiencies, on homes that have received fines, and on homes that have had their Medicare payments suspended for new admissions. https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN 3/x
On the eve of the Senate hearing, @ProPublica updated our Nursing Home Inspect tool, which lets you easily compare the quality of nursing homes nationwide. https://t.co/6ZldZx5yYN 2/x
Today, the Senate Finance Committee will hold an important hearing on nursing home quality. It's called "Not forgotten," but sadly problems in nursing homes are often forgotten. https://t.co/7IELa3J45m 1/x

That said, the past year reaffirmed my faith that many of the best stories are waiting to be written, in reporters‚Äô notebooks or in their heads. 11/x
Not everything went perfectly. It was our first year. We made mistakes, and we intend to learn from them. 10/x
And legislators in West Virginia acknowledged that it may be time to revise their conflict-of-interest rules after @wvgazettemail reporter @Kenwardjr showed how often lawmakers voted on matters in which they had a personal or professional interest. 9/x
Members of Congress called on the Trump administration to reverse course on plans to neuter a nuclear safety watchdog board after @thenewmexican reporter @RebeccaKMoss detailed the cutbacks. 8/x
The inspector general of the @HUDgov announced plans to audit troubled housing authorities following stories by The Southern Illinoisan reporter @MollyParkerSI about the deteriorating conditions of subsidized housing and HUD‚Äôs lax oversight. 7/x
Stories by @jcsheckler and @bykenarmstrong led to the resignation of the Elkhart, Ind., police chief, an independent investigation of the department and criminal charges against two officers. Elkhart‚Äôs mayor abandoned his plans to seek re-election following the revelations. 6/x
Not only did our partners find those stories and have a profound effect, they also showed how important it is to support investigative journalism at the ground level. 5/x
A year ago, when we launched the Local Reporting Network, we didn‚Äôt know what to expect. But we thought it was important to give reporters the ability to pursue accountability stories that can‚Äôt be wedged in amid daily deadlines. 4/x
The pressure to produce clicks above all else is undermining the chance to do investigative reporting that requires more than a few days of work. 3/x
What has already been lost is even more significant than is understood. Communities covered by watchdog journalists who have the time and support to look critically at local institutions are now the exception, not the rule. 2/x

For one of the officers involved, it was his ninth disciplinary incident, according to personnel records gathered by @SBTribune and @ProPublica.		After being hired in 2008, he was suspended six times and reprimanded twice in his first five years.

.@jcsheckler requested the video after noting a disparity between Chief Windbigler‚Äôs public description to the Police Merit Commission ‚Äî the city panel that exercises civilian oversight ‚Äî and what the chief wrote in personnel records.
Five months ago, the two officers were disciplined for this incident. But they received reprimands rather than suspensions or possible termination.

This is why journal disclosures are important. $3.5 million is not a complete figure, as I have shown above. 4/4
That's just one company that's not in Open Payments. There are more. Take Grail, Aura Biosciences, Foghorn, PMV Pharma, etc. We do not know how much Dr. Baselga earned from them--and he didn't provide them when we asked. 3/x
For instance, Baselga served on the board of Infinity Pharmaceuticals. He earned:	$137,369 if fiscal 2015 (https://t.co/Ra0XBm9PUv)	$68,436 in fiscal 2016 (https://t.co/sLSV2Gop4C)	$42,556 in fiscal 2017 (https://t.co/oyTTp8c0nA)	2/x
One important thing to consider in this discussion about Dr. Baselga is that we don't know what we don't know, meaning many companies don't disclose to Open Payments. 1/x

RT @katie_thomas: Really good rundown of some questions and answers about our story. https://t.co/KPuiNHsfkU
5/ If you just Google Dr. Baselga and any given company, you‚Äôll find mentions of it. So what‚Äôs the big deal?		A. That‚Äôs not the way conflict of interest disclosure works. It‚Äôs supposed to be on all articles for which it is required.
4/ Why didn‚Äôt you note that Dr. Baselga did disclose his relationships in some articles?		A. We did say that. We said he didn‚Äôt disclose in 60% of articles from 2013-present. In two thirds of those 60%, other authors did disclose. (In 2017, he didn‚Äôt disclose in 87% of articles.)
3/ What‚Äôs the big deal?	A. As past president of a major cancer research group and current editor in chief of a medical journal, people look to Dr. Baselga to set the rules. If he doesn‚Äôt follow them, what message does it send?
2/ When you exclude the Seragon money, his industry earnings are minimal, no?	A. Not so. Beyond consulting fees, he earns a lot of money serving on boards. And many startups don‚Äôt disclose how much they pay doctors.   Also all ties are supposed to be disclosed.
1/ Isn‚Äôt it possible that Dr. Baselga just forgot to turn in a conflict of interest form?		A. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. Most journals require all authors to fill out the form, whether they have a disclosure or not. Meaning he had to write that he had no disclosures.
A couple questions have been posed about my story with ‚Å¶@katie_thomas‚Å© and I thought I‚Äôd try to answer them.  https://t.co/EYuKbSip4v
This is a dangerous viewpoint. @SGottliebFDA has said so as has every clinical and medical leader in the US. https://t.co/IgfUPiJjlG
@Mike_Hixenbaugh @Behrouz_Zand Of note, early-stage research journals DO require disclosures. And in 2/3 of the studies in which Dr. Baselga did not disclose, at least some of his co-authors did disclose.

14/  If you are a patient at @CHI_StLukes or another Texas Medical Center hospital, tell us your experience: https://t.co/WWwRsKWbNe @Mike_Hixenbaugh @HoustonChron /end
13/ Where does this leave us? The hospital said its bypass surgery program has improved and that its heart transplant program will remain open. Our investigation continues.
12/ And we reported how from mid-2016 to mid-2017, @CHI_StLukes heart bypass outcomes were among the worst in the country. https://t.co/DBthmCpclw @HoustonChron @Mike_Hixenbaugh
11/ In the meantime, we‚Äôve reported about a man who sued the hospital after he suffered brain damage during his heart transplant in 2016: https://t.co/k0aUxJTuSV
10/ A week later, Medicare said that it would stop paying for heart transplants on Aug. 17 because the hospital had not resolved its underlying problems. https://t.co/cFCTw6hqdC
9/ The hospital reopened the program saying it had made policy and staffing changes, but saying it found no systemic problems with the care the patients received. https://t.co/T9FJDss5nZ
8/ @CHI_StLukes suspended heart transplants for 14 days in June after two patients died following heart transplants in May. Another had died in March following a transplant in January. All told, three of nine heart transplant recipients this year died. https://t.co/TAaw7Bgdon
7/ @propublica and @houstonchronicle published our first piece in May, noting the outsized number of patient deaths and an exodus of physicians. We also reported on unusual complications and a widow who received an anonymous letter raising concerns. https://t.co/5l4t9rU2Yl
6/ None of this received public attention. The hospital continued to market itself as having outcomes that were among the nation‚Äôs best--even though statistics showed otherwise.
5/ In the meantime, however, the hospital‚Äôs outcomes started to look statistically worse than expected when national transplant analysts reported results. That caught the eye of Medicare. In December 2017, an inspection said the hospital was out of compliance.
4/ The hospital hired a new transplant surgeon who began work in 2016 and it has said that results improved dramatically.
3/ In 2015, patient outcomes took a turn for the worse. Among 14 patients who received a heart transplant in the first six months of that year, five died in less than a year, far more than would be expected.
2/ @CHI_StLukes has played a historic role in heart care in this country. It was here that famed surgeon Denton Cooley performed some of the world‚Äôs first heart transplants back in the 1960s, and where his prot√©g√©, Dr. O.H. ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Frazier, has pursued an artificial heart.
