There have been links in Fox News articles (can‚Äôt find the link) of known liberals donating money to get the caravan here by Tuesday.

@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump So trump calling illegals coming here an invasion is all bad but Obama bin Laden going against our police force for 8 years is ok. He could of started a race war with things he said and never backed the blue. So trump defending our borders is bad?
@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump Why don‚Äôt we have mandatory English here in America. It‚Äôs been our language for hundreds of years and well majority speak it. Why should we cater to those who don‚Äôt. We should teach mandatory English to all that come here LEGALLY

@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump In multiple California counties there are more registered voting Democrats then people of voting age in that county. So yeah I guess illegals can‚Äôt vote
@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump And the group is waving a Honduras flag. Any large group of people marching under another country‚Äôs flag trying to come here is an invasion. Oh and they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt vote‚Äù there has been hundreds of dead people and illegals voting for Libs in the 2016 and now

@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump And 1). You just said trump golfs to Much but you want presidents to take vacations 	2). How is trump hopeless when in two years he‚Äôs defeated ISIS, made peace with North Korea, boosted our economy, defended our borders and ended the Korean War. Just amazing work for a hopeless
@eripof @gman5567 @Blueequus775 @realDonaldTrump Lol Obama took multiple multi million dollar vacations in his time as president. Trump is donating his salary and boosting the economy. Quick question do you think the caravan should be let in and allowed to vote too?
