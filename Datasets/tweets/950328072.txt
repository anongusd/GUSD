@KevinFreyTV @SpecNewsCLT Thanks!  Just want folks to know my team and I are still hear.  Committee on House Administration has a list of 40+ items that have to be completed prior to last day, many of them with deadlines in early/mid December to allow them enough time to transition to new Members.
@KevinFreyTV @SpecNewsCLT Hey Kevin, please make sure to include the full story.  Yes, I am a Member of Congress until January 2nd, and I'm still working . . . but as part of an orderly transition have to start archiving and transitioning social media, cancelling subscriptions, wiping computers, etc.
You are welcome to continue to reach out at 202-225-1976 or 704-362-1060.  God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.
As my team prepares for an orderly transition, this account will be archived and deactivated on November 26th.  My Charlotte and DC offices will remain open for as long as the Committee on House Administration allows. (continued) . . .
Thank you for the great honor of serving you and all of North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District these past six years.  As I prepare to leave this office, I am very much aware of the incredible privilege you granted me.  (continued) . . .

Stopping 'sue &amp; settle' will put an end to years of back door judicial fiat and lead to much needed transparency and accountability.
Today's legislation has no direct impact on Hurricane Matthew disaster recovery efforts in N.C.
We anticipate additional disaster relief up to $50B.  These additional amounts, while necessary, beg for fiscally responsible offsets
Support for Puerto Rico?  Absolutely.  Today's disaster relief bill?  Absolutely not, without suitable accountability.
"Disaster relief" bill included $16 billion bailout of National Flood Insurance Program. No reforms to address waste, protect taxpayers
Disaster relief is necessary, but no effort has been made to trim expenses elsewhere in DC to help pay for it.
When hardworking American families face unexpected expenses, they find offsets in family budget.  That's real life, but not in D.C.
America must help those in need, including Puerto Rico, but we must do so responsibly.  Today's legislation wasn't responsible.

You are not forgotten.
98,000 homes &amp; 19,000 businesses in NC were damaged by Matthew.  82,000 applied for assistance. 142 familes still living in FEMA trailers
Today I also sent letter to @HUDgov, @fema, and @HouseAppropsGOP reminding them of ongoing Hurricane Matthew recovery needs
So while the news will focus on money for Texas, know that today's action also benefits those still recovering from Matthew
With specific funding now appropriated for Harvey, those FEMA/NC funds can be "unfrozen" and relief projects continue
In wake of Harvey, $110 million in FEMA assistance designated for NC was frozen to ensure adequate $ for immediate post-Harvey needs
Today I joined bipartisan majority to approve $7.85 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief.  Also important for Hurricane Matthew efforts

Fin CHOICE Act helps properly regulate financial industry, ends taxpayer bailouts, increases accountability while supporting economic growth
I co-sponsored and helped introduce the Financial CHOICE Act, which passed in the House last week.
In 2010, there were nearly 7,100 community banks nationwide. Now, after Dodd-Frank regulations, only 5,521, a major loss for small towns.
This over-regulation has strangled community banks and made “too big to fail” banks even bigger. Read article here: https://t.co/NjLDubLwsi
Dodd-Frank created one-size-fits-all regulations for banks - from Wall Street banks to community banks and credit unions.
.@SouthCltWeekly recently published my op-ed on failed Dodd-Frank, why Financial CHOICE Act is better, which passed House last week.
The Financial CHOICE Act, which I co-sponsored, means opportunity for all Americans, &amp; bailouts for none. More: https://t.co/WSzGvl46lC
Bank fees have increased 111% under Dodd-Frank, which has made Wall Street banks even bigger while strangling community banks,credit unions.
Under Dodd-Frank, NC has lost 50% of banks since 2010. 3 have consolidated just in the last few months. Read more: https://t.co/WSzGvllHda
The Financial CHOICE Act will repeal and replace the failed  Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.

Our answer to this legislation is the Financial CHOICE Act, which I co-sponsored and which passed in the House last week.
Dodd-Frank is Obama-era financial legislation w/ one-size-fits-all regulations which strangle community banks &amp; credit unions.
What is Dodd-Frank? In a nutshell, it’s Obamacare for your bank and credit union.

The #financialchoiceact will impose the toughest penalties in history for fraud on Wall Street.
The #financialchoiceact will end taxpayer bailouts for Wall Street.
Dodd-Frank has contributed to slowest economic recovery in 70 years, impeded access to capital/credit for small businesses
Dodd-Frank also created @CFPB, which even the liberal DC Court of Appeals calls ‘unconstitutional’ and a ‘threat to individual liberty
Under Dodd-Frank, NC has lost 50% of our banks since 2010, while 3 community banks have consolidated just in the last few months.

Insurance companiess are also prohibited from raising premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous coverage
The AHCA prohibits insurance companies from rescinding coverage based on any new diagnosis or health care need.
Under the #AHCA, insurance companies are prohibited from denying anyone coverage due to a pre-existing condition.
Every bill I’ve supported to repeal and replace Obamacare has included protections for pre-existing conditions.
Premiums and deductibles have skyrocketed. In #NC09, constituents have exactly 1 option for health care coverage on the Obamacare exchange.
7 years ago, President Obama and fellow Democrats mounted a government takeover of health care. The results have been disastrous.

Pittenger statement on pre-existing conditions: https://t.co/8iA6H7G3mk
If another state offers benefits which go beyond those currently included in Obamacare, you might choose to move to take advantage.
The #AHCA gives states options in how to meet a common standard.  Those with pre-existing conditions will still be protected in every state.
Even then, those individuals cannot be charged more if they maintain continuous coverage. (3/3)
….with pre-existing conditions through another risk-sharing or reinsurance program.  (2/3)
Current law remains in force unless an individual state chooses to serve those… (1/3)
The legislation does give states the flexibility to choose which solution is best for their unique circumstances.  #AHCA

.@RepStevePearce and I issued statements condemning Obama’s last minute terrorism funding. Via @BladenOnline: https://t.co/5om3AA8Fn8
Now I am grateful that we are moving forward with a new Admin. that will dramatically improve America’s strategic posture around the globe.
We should recognize that a substantial amount of this funding will likely end up supporting violence and other terrorist efforts by Hamas.
In the final hours of his Admin, Pres Obama felt compelled to continue his rudderless foreign policies by sending over $200M to Palestine.
Apparently the past 8 years were not long enough for the Obama Admin to waste taxpayer dollars and promote failed Middle East policies
During his final month in power, President Obama provided $261 million U.S. tax dollars to the Palestinian Authority.

Watch my speech supporting the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act (HR 7): https://t.co/3r9odCJ4bt
…you’ll understand why the idea that some people advocate for the murder of little babies is unconscionable (2/2)
If you’ve ever held a newborn, so defenseless and completely dependent on you…. (1/2)
H.R. 7 would make the Hyde Amendment government-wide policy and ensure future federal programs don’t support abortion.
However, Obamacare ignores the Hyde Amendment and uses tax dollars as subsidies for insurance policies which offer abortion services.
The 1975 Hyde Amendment prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion and is estimated to have saved 2 million lives.
Being pro-life I recently helped pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act (HR 7) as a cosponsor.

Watch my opinions on President-Elect Trump’s inauguration via @TWCNewsCLT: https://t.co/HeJEcips9z
President Trump is a businessman and I think he wants to bring his skills to change the course of what is happening in America.
Under the Obama Admin. we are growing at 1% economic growth. This is the only Presidency since WWII that hasn’t reached 3%.
President Trump will convey to the American people that he is going to be there to change the course of this country,
To be there with the peaceful transfer of power that we have in America is so special and are great moments in our history.
As I walk up the worn stone steps of Capitol each day to vote I look at that dome and see it represents freedom, liberty and opportunity
The inauguration is a thrilling moment for America and those in Congress boycotting it will miss out on a glorious opportunity.
I’ve been going to inaugurations since Reagan in the 1980s. I was there 4 years ago when President Obama was inaugurated.

A market driven health reform allowing insurance to be sold across state lines will encourage competition and  drive prices down.

I urge Sen Dems to put down their partisan weapons and work with Reps to find a solution that puts the needs of Americans above politics
Dealing with a public health crisis like the Zika virus should be above politics.  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats see things differently.
How does one justify ending the lives of little babies impacted by Zika, rather than compassionately trying to heal them?
The Democrats’ underlying belief that killing innocent babies is a necessary tool to fight Zika is disturbing.
The bipartisan bill had support until it was blocked by Pres Obama, and other Dems to be used as a talking point on the campaign trial

There are better ways for Mr. Kaepernick to protest. Vote. Host a forum between young black men and local police. Volunteer in the community
What remains clear is that Mr. Kaepernick's disrespectful behavior has done nothing to advance his stated cause.
Mr. Kaepernick seems to equate "pride" and "respect" with "acceptance" and "endorsement."
Nearly 1.5M more have been wounded protecting the American flag. Meanwhile, Mr. Kaepernick will be paid $11.9M this season to play a game.
More than 1.3 million Americans have died defending the flag which Mr. Kaepernick has chosen to disrespect.

Read about the House Republican plan for a simpler, fairer tax code in my column in the @Statesville https://t.co/bdM5tArsGS
With a new tax code built for growth, we can once again make America the best place in the world to hire and invest.
The restructured IRS will have three primary branches: a families and individuals unit, a business unit, and a small claims court unit.
Our House Republican Blueprint reorganizes the IRS to prioritize the taxpayer, not the government.
Tax reform means little, however, if the agency charged with collecting taxes isn’t reformed as well.
We need our major businesses to retain jobs in America, instead of moving overseas because of overly burdensome taxes and regulations.
Our House Republican plan would install a flat 20 percent corporate tax rate to enable American businesses to be more competitive.
Our Blueprint is centered around three basic ideas: simplicity and fairness, jobs and economic growth and a “service-first” IRS.
House Republicans are committed to fixing America’s tax code through common sense reforms outlined in our Tax Reform Blueprint.

This follows Iran launching a military rocket near the U.S.S. Harry Truman in December, and the illegal capture of 10 US Sailors in January.
Meanwhile, President Obama has given Iran $1.7B taxpayer dollars, including $400M as “leverage” to secure the release of 4 American hostages

Six years later, Dodd-Frank’s promises have been replaced by concern the law is doing more harm than good.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis the 2009 Dodd-Frank financial reform appeared to be a lifeline.

Read more about the bill I introduced, H.R. 5607, and its approval here: https://t.co/bWh6cITtd0
This bill results from a series of bipartisan hearings examining how we can improve our laws to address the threat of terrorism financing.
The longer groups like ISIS remain on the battlefield, the more effective their messaging and recruitment efforts become.
HR 5607 requires the Treasury Department to investigate how to incorporate our Embassies into counter-terrorism financing efforts.
H.R. 5607, The Enhancing Treasury’s Anti-Terror Tools Act passed by a bipartisan vote of 362-45. Read more here: https://t.co/bWh6cITtd0
RT @SteveScalise: .@RepPittenger’s bill helps improve our ability to detect and combat the financing of terror organizations. https://t.co/…
HR 5607 is scheduled to be voted on around 6:30 tonight. Watch live on @cspan or at https://t.co/OGS2Im6Qj5
This bill is an effort to support the Treasury's role and our larger strategic efforts to defeat terrorist organizations.
Many individuals are not aware of the substantial role our Treasury Department plays in our embassies abroad.
HR 5607 seeks to enhance the tools the Treasury Department uses to combat the financing of terrorist money laundering and illicit finance.
A vote on HR 5606 is scheduled around 6:30 tonight. Watch it live on @cspan or at https://t.co/OGS2Im6Qj5
HR 5606 helps clarify the current illicit finance laws and provides corrections to ensure that our current laws work as initially intended.
My bill HR 5606 is a result of a bipartisan yearlong series of hearings focused on improving our laws to address evolving terrorist threats.
H.R. 5607, the Enhancing Treasury’s Anti-Terror Tools Act, will improve anti-terror finance monitoring of cross-border fund transfers
H.R. 5606, the Anti-terrorism Information Sharing Is Strength Act, increases information sharing across federal law enforcement agencies.
Shortly, I will be speaking on the House Floor about HR 5606 and HR 5607.
Last week I also introduced two counterterrorism bills. Read more about H.R. 5606 and H.R. 5607 here: https://t.co/fr1rY80RzE
The Treasury Department’s FinCEN is our government’s primary agency dedicated to combatting money laundering and terrorist group financing.
As groups like ISIS become increasingly sophisticated, they often access the US and the international financial system to transfer funds.
FinCEN is on the front lines ensuring that terrorist and criminal enterprises cannot reap the benefits of normal banking operations.
The increase in FinCEN funding is fully offset by cutting waste elsewhere in the budget.
This amendment to increases funding for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) by 3 million dollars.
Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved an amendment introduced by myself, which was attached to H.R. 5485

I hope that our country will take a strong assessment of this and know what we need to do in every respect to support our law enforcement.
Police officers are incredibly dedicated public servants. They deserve all of our full commitment, support and trust.
I cannot believe the extent to which some people misrepresented the role of the police and what they do on our behalf.
These police officers are dedicated to our safety and are out there on the front lines everyday on our behalf.
The attack in Dallas was overwhelmingly tragic and sad.
This attack was the deadliest attack on law enforcement in America since September 11, 2001.
This morning I joined @BoThompsonWBT on @wbtradio to discuss the overwhelmingly sad attack in Dallas. https://t.co/fG0YEsHQUq

We identified specific opportunities to work together to intercept terrorism financing and enable critical data and intelligence sharing.
Just last week I also introduced two bipartisan counter-terrorism financing bills.
Last month, I hosted a international forum in Vienna on terrorism financing, Intelligence collaboration, and civil liberties protections.
I spent last week in the Middle East with allies increasing collaboration to cut off the funding sources of radical Islamist extremists.
The longer ISIS and similar groups remain on the battlefield, the more effective their propaganda and recruitment efforts will become.
As a result of President Obama’s failed foreign policy, radical Islamic terrorist groups have been able to grow at an alarming rate.
Last week, the world saw yet another horrifying terrorist attack in Istanbul. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected.

@willkennedynews @WCCBCharlotte What about working together to defeat radical Islamic terrorists &amp; protect American families?
@markknoller Perhaps he could direct that energy toward defeating radical Islamist terrorists, increasing economic growth past 1.5%
@FOX46News @POTUS Maybe if he could direct that energy toward defeating radical Islamist terrorists and strengthening US economy . . .
The President's time would be better spent working with Congress on legislation to grow the economy, create jobs, and keep Americans safe.
More American businesses are dying than being created. Is this the type of leadership to tout at a campaign rally?
At the same time, America’s economy is sputtering along with just 1.5 percent growth.
President Obama’s foreign policy of appeasement and apology has been a failure, leaving America and the world less safe.
We are seeing radical Islamist terrorism strike across the globe with disturbing frequency.

Read more about the #GOP health plan here:https://t.co/tP38p4CTSr
The House Republican plan protects patients by ensuring no American, regardless of age or health status, can be denied coverage.
Our plan also allows health insurance to be sold across state lines, which would increase competition and drive down costs.
There would be no federal requirement to purchase health insurance, but those who do would receive a tax break.
Our plan offers a refundable tax credit to pay for health insurance for those without access to employer coverage, Medicare, or Medicaid.
Not once has public approval of Obamacare risen above 45 percent.  Americans want to be in charge of their own healthcare, not Washington.
Meanwhile, House Republicans were at work, offering to expand freedom through a common sense plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Last week, House Democrats spent their time on a publicity stunt in a misguided effort to restrict Americans' Constitutional rights.
Read my column in the @statesville Record &amp; Landmark about how the #GOP health plan puts patients first.
This ruling also shows the importance of filling Justice Scalia’s seat on the #SCOTUS with someone committed to protecting the right to life
Due to the zeal of radical pro-abortion activists, such protections for women and babies won’t be in place.
These laws were written to make sure such tragedies would not be able to happen again.
Kermit Gosnell was able to murder three infants who were born alive during attempted abortion procedures because of insufficient oversight.
Seems like they’ve come to the more radical position of "whenever, wherever and by whomever."
What happened to the pro-abortion mantra of "safe, legal, and rare"?
As a member of the #ProLife Caucus, I am disappointed that the #SCOTUS struck down two common sense safety regulations on abortion clinics.

Despite President Obama’s misguided efforts, we cannot appease or apologize our way to a solution.
Our Middle East allies are discouraged by the lack of American leadership in the fight against ISIS and radical terrorist organizations.

Three keys to prevent terrorist attacks are adequate Intelligence, cyber security and the interception of funding,
The objective of this forum was to collaborate to prevent attacks from terrorist organizations.
I recently hosted the fourth Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum. Learn more here: https://t.co/D9IfbjwAy2
Now, we encourage President Obama to work with Congress on common sense steps to secure our borders.
Today’s Supreme Court decision reinforces America’s separation of powers and careful system of checks and balances.
That means enforcing the law, not issuing a royal decree to ignore the law.

I have worked to promote policies which would defeat ISIS, including efforts to counter and intercept their illicit financing operations.
The Obama Administration has yet to develop a serious strategy to degrade and defeat ISIS.
The longer ISIS remains on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, the more effective their propaganda and recruitment efforts will be.

Legislation I have co-sponsored has increased accountability for VA employees and ensured that taxpayer dollars are used to help veterans.
Last month, the House approved a VA budget of $176 billion - an increase of $13 billion in funding compared to last year.

We are a divided government - we do not give absolute power to the President. Obama would like to make the law but it is not in his power.
11 states have sued the federal government due to executive overreach; it is time to realize Obama’s abuse of executive power.
We need to rein in President Obama from this executive overreach and federal threats that he is continuously making against NC.
I went to the House Floor to submit the amendment to block Obama’s ability to withhold money from North Carolina.
We cannot stand by and be idle while President Obama overreaches his power. He is to enforce the law not interpret and write it.
President Obama has no right to write the laws. He cannot proclaim laws by edict, or punish states by withholding federal $, as NC over HB2.

Strong consideration would be given to members from rural and underserved communities.
Advisory Committees would represent different charter types, asset sizes, geographic locations &amp; ownership type.
Credit unions &amp; community banks should not be regulated in the same manner as large intl financial institutions. https://t.co/l8WiaRgNgU
This legislation would create Advisory Committees to give smaller fin. institutions a seat at the table to ensure common sense regulation.

You can read more about efforts to improve Doppler radar coverage in CLT here: https://t.co/budhJWUL9X
Thanks @ThomTillis &amp; @SenatorBurr for efforts in Senate legislation to require NWS Doppler radar facility in CLT! https://t.co/budhJWUL9X
Thanks to my House colleagues who co-signed appropriations request to improve CLT radar coverage: @RepAdams &amp; @RepDavidEPrice
This is in addition to HR 3538 which I sponsored - would require a NWS Doppler radar facility in any metro area of 700k or more.
Yesterday in the House, I requested appropriations to study radar coverage gaps in major metropolitan areas.
Inadequate radar coverage results in missed signs of severe weather, such as a 2012 CLT tornado for which warning was received after damage.
The Doppler radar covering CLT is in Greenville/Spartanburg - a signal too weak for accurate coverage once it reaches CLT.
Did you know that CLT is the largest metropolitan area without a  NWS Doppler Radar Facility? I'm working to change that.

Next Supreme Court Justice should be selected by next president, not by one in his last months in office. My view:  https://t.co/rq7dyG3HJV

With election in full swing, Senate should wait &amp; let American people decide who they want to select next Supreme Court Justice.
We should not be setting a precedent of a President nominating a new Justice in the last months of his term.
President Obama's nomination could alter the balance of SCOTUS, leading to radical policy &amp; legal shifts. https://t.co/LwpWLtSWQn
President Obama has Constitutional right to nominate someone to Supreme Court. Senate has Constitutional right not to confirm.
