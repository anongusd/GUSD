The likelihood of #SusanCollins losing re-election has been vastly overrated. She won by 37 points in 2014, and Maine shifted quite a bit to the right in 2016. Early polling shows her up only 8 points over a generic Democrat, but up 24 over Susan Rice. #2020SenateRaces

I do like that the most progressive Democrats have been proposing tax increases on the wealthy to pay for their ideas though. I'm not necessarily endorsing their tax plans (partly out of incrementalism), but they are least guilty of pie-in-the-sky logic when it comes to #taxes.
Politicians of both parties should probably stop saying they're going to cut taxes on the "middle-class." I'm not exactly a deficit hawk, but we really shouldn't be running deficits this high when the economy is strong. #deficits #taxes

@Red_Pilgrim You do make some strong points; it would obviously would be a travesty if she walked free. I will say that in theory I would like to see her stand trial, but we should review carefully. Not sure exactly what she plans to do as a Trojan Horse if she's arrested immediately.

There's a lot of idiotic criticism of red-state Democrats from the left. Say what you will, but no one works more tirelessly than Jones, Manchin, Heitkamp, McCaskill, etc. at helping centrists in their states beat right-wingers when the odds are against them. #BernieSanders
One critique of #BernieSanders is that he has used the Democratic Party for his own ends, without contributing anything. This is fairly typical: "outsider" candidates tend to be somewhat narcissistic and reject the hard work needed to build coalitions.
I am very concerned that direct military intervention in #Venezuela would cause the next government to be viewed as an illegitimate puppet state, but the US should definitely be using any pressure it can to support the National Assembly over Maduro.
I'm reconsidering this... a bit. In the Senate, Hillary had a moderately liberal voting record on foreign policy (representing a very liberal state), then took pretty interventionist/hard power positions while Secretary of State. Some could pivot once elected. #ForeignPolicy https://t.co/lSw3jkPTrG

Senate Democrats should vote "present" on the #GreenNewDeal, like they did with Daines' Medicare-For-All amendment. In my view, the #1 issue we need to address is climate change, but that doesn't mean that one freshman congressperson should dictate the solutions.

@SanityAA 1.8 billion according to a study in 2015. Look, obviously you can't negotiate with ISIS or Boko Haram, but you're oversimplifying some pretty complex issues. The vast majority of Muslims are not violent. As for Turkey and Iran, yes, we need to engage with all other governments.
@SanityAA That's not what I said. I support Israel, we're on the same side.		People often just believe what they are raised to believe. The views she expressed are pretty typical in the Islamic world. If we can't engage with her, we're shutting ourselves off to 2 billion people.
The #IlhanOmar controversy mirrors previous comments by prominent Muslim Americans. I strongly dislike her comments about Israel, but we should try to engage with Muslims and the Islamic world rather than branding them as anti-Semites when they express their views.
Pelosi's refusal to allow Trump to give the #StateOfTheUnion address in the House sets a bad precedent. I can already see the GOP blocking a future Democratic president from speaking for some arbitrary reason.

I personally think #RoyCooper has strong chances of re-election in 2020, perhaps by a wide margin. The GOP's nominee (most likely candidate is Dan Forest) will likely be to the right of Pat McCrory and incumbency advantage seems to still be significant in governor's races.
Roy Cooper should sign the bill for a new primary in #nc09, especially given the likelihood of fraud in the primary as well. At this point, it's clear that a new election needs to be held, but it should not be seen as a Democratic power grab.
This is a huge win. The only potential opposition to the #CriminalJusticeReform bill from Democrats would be on the left-wing of the caucus for not going far enough, and it seems like most of the Republicans will vote yes as well.	https://t.co/Cb5xgCx5bZ

Why not pressure #BernieSanders? Because they want to attack the party establishment, while the left-wing of the caucus is too holy for critique. Whatever happens, Schumer shouldn't block anyone from the position if he wants to promote broad appeal for the Democratic Party.

It was a mistake to portray #Trump’s lack of foreign policy knowledge as a new, unique problem. None of the 3 presidents prior to Trump (especially W) were really ready for the foreign stage. Hillary was unique for a modern presidential candidate in this regard.
None of the 2020 candidates are prepared on foreign policy like #HillaryClinton was in 2016, although Bernie stands out as being the least thoughtful and knowledgeable of the major candidates.
The Muller investigation and judicial confirmations would ideally be dealt with separately, but ideally McConnell would bring the vote on the #MuellerProtectionBill to the floor. I hope more Republicans join Flake, though it would have been more useful had he done this sooner.
Everything about #RandPaul—especially the Pompeo vote— suggests that he is an establishment Republican who has used his father’s genuine legacy as a nutcase-ideologue to give himself a libertarian facade.
It’s a shame that so many libertarians and leftists were defending #JulianAssange while he was scheming to destroy the United States. Anti-establishment, populist ideologies are by far the most vulnerable to manipulation.
The Speaker election is actually a really good test of how effective they are. #NancyPelosi whittled down her opposition to a mere 32 votes and prevented anyone from rising to challenge her.
I am pleased by the re-nomination of #NancyPelosi as Speaker. We have a proven, highly effective wheeler-dealer in charge rather than someone more charismatic and less experienced; Democrats definitely made the responsible choice.
I cautiously agree with the Senate’s #Yemen resolution. This administration has atrociously handled the crisis with the Saudis; if we want a constructive alliance, we need to find a way to re-craft it that restrains them, and our policy towards Yemen needs to be part of that.

Rural areas tend to report votes before urban areas, absentee and provisional ballots tend to lean Democrat, and pacific coast votes always come in last. So, yes, late-reporting votes lean Democrat and that has nothing to do with #voterfraud.
I'm agnostic about whether the Democrats should choose #NancyPelosi for speaker again. There's a lot of unfair criticism of her, but it might not be a bad idea to shake-up leadership and try to win over new (or old) voters, especially given how long she's been in power.

Had #NorthCarolina held election day jungle primaries with different districts, then runoffs, Dems probably would have picked up 2 or 3 seats. The liberals suing NC over those districts turned that down because they believed the overrated "high turnout means we win" arguments.

DC should be given statehood. It's the most straightforward and logical solution to the problem of DC residents' lack of representation in Congress, which I think is very obviously wrong, especially considering that they pay taxes. #dcstatehood #notaxationwithoutrepresentation
Likewise, having so many nonviolent offenders in prison should be seen as a tragedy for #justice (irrespective of the social value of deterrence). On the other hand, the #deathpenalty shouldn't hinge on whether people who have done horrific things are totally devoid of humanity.
The worst kind of logic about #justice is "I would never do this, therefore anyone who does it is evil". That's reinforcing a social norm, it has nothing to do with morality. Real justice is focused on reciprocation for the harm caused to others, with a heavy weight on intent.
I am cautiously opposed to withdrawing from the #INF agreement at present, but I hope the administration's goal is to re-negotiate the agreement to get Russia to comply (not sure it will work).
Are the #bombings just the inevitable result of populism and hyper-partisanship on the far-right? Self-reflection on the consequences of rhetoric is needed on both sides, but there's a clear difference between Trump and Sanders' responses to terrorism by their supporters.
Likewise, the gleeful calls to overthrow #SusanCollins are not very thoughtful. And as much as I love #TammyDuckworth and #MaggieHassan, I wasn't pleased that #MarkKirk and #KellyAyotte were the two Republicans successfully taken down in 2016.
If I were a #Republican, I would be terrified that my party's institutional advantages in the House, Senate, and state legislatures could lead to the death of competitive elections and ideologically diverse representation in this country.

@TroyIITweets Originally intended to include that link, but didn’t have space. I am realizing that I made the Tweet ridiculously vague and obscure without it
@TroyIITweets https://t.co/UpIEpaQQ0a
@TroyIITweets Due to Democrats being predominantly urban.
@TroyIITweets Even without gerrymandering, several states will skew in House representation towards the GOP.
@TroyIITweets I meant “natural geographic advantage in the House”. Wasn’t including the Senate there.
Obviously, this is a terrible way for the president to value his advisers. #DonaldTrump #JimMattis
My guess would be that #JimMattis voted for #McCain and #Romney, then for #Hillary in 2016. I think that #Trump just means that Mattis isn’t a Trump supporter when he describes him as “sort of a Democrat,” in which case I think he’s right.
It’s disappointing to see #NikkiHaley leave, as she was one of the more stable and competent foreign policy voices in the #Trump administration, though I disagreed with some of her actions, like her overly partisan response to the UN Poverty Report.
I disagree with all of the objections to using the efficiency gap to measure #gerrymandering. The #Senate was intended to empower rural areas, the #House is supposed to reflect the popular vote. State legislatures should try to reverse natural geographic advantages for the GOP.
#Obama talked a lot about "middle-class economics." Then #Bernie talked a lot about the needs of "working-class" Americans, and #Hillary started talking about how her policies would help "middle and working-class" Americans. It's an interesting linguistic shift to the left.

@BallardHal @jaytillery @SenDougJones That’s single-payer. That’s different from a public option. The British system has pros and cons, but it’s not really relevant to anything I said.
@BallardHal @jaytillery @SenDougJones Why?
@BallardHal @jaytillery @SenDougJones Not true.
@BallardHal @jaytillery @SenDougJones Medicaid expansion can also reduce premiums	https://t.co/Hizpcj0mLS	But the protections for people with pre-existing conditions caused premiums to increase, which is why I think we also need to re-instate the individual mandate and pass a public option.
@BallardHal @jaytillery @SenDougJones This is a fair (ish) point, but what you said wasn't that it would cost taxpayers money. Several studies have shown that Medicaid expansion has improved healthcare for the poor in the states that have expanded it.	https://t.co/DbCXiLykDM 1/2
Is this just the result of outdated rules still on the books or is this intentional? I can’t imagine anyone think this is a good policy. #Canada #Marijuana #BorderSecurity https://t.co/k5haa41Nll
Prior to now, the US has been increasingly allied with #SaudiArabia in order to counter the growing influence of #Iran in the #MiddleEast. The killing of #JamalKhashoggi, as US legal resident, is clearly going to shift that calculus, but I’m not sure what the solution is.

It should be obligated by law for presidential candidates to publicly release recent #taxreturns. I imagine the only reason this wasn't already a legal requirement was that everyone was voluntarily releasing their tax returns before #Trump.
#Democrats should have recruited a viable candidate to challenge #BobMenendez in the primary. I honestly would probably vote for #BobHugin if I lived in #NewJersey, my hopes for control of the #Senate aside. There need to be consequences for pay-to-play. #CountryOverParty

@anitaDlivaditis @RepWalterJones I’m sure you disagree with many things Brennan has done and said - which is fine, I’m not an expert on him. But none of these articles are making a good argument that Brennan was leaking classified info - if I’m not mistaken, it’s just speculation with regard to Yemen.
@anitaDlivaditis @RepWalterJones My point was that it’s important to provide intel to trustworthy experts who might tend to disagree with you, so they can independently analyze it - and if this was just a petty attack on Brennan, then that isn’t constructive at all, which is of typical of politics today.
@anitaDlivaditis @RepWalterJones Well, I certainly haven’t seen anything like that, even in anti-Brennan articles.

One of the most obnoxious points that #ClimateChange deniers make is about how man-made CO2 emissions only account for a small percentage of our atmosphere. None of them actually have any clue how much CO2 is necessary to raise global temperatures enough to change the climate.
At the time, I remember that #HaroldBornstein's letter sound so obviously Trump-ish that it almost seemed too obvious that Trump wrote it himself. Didn't any of his staff warn him that the letter sounded completely nonsensical?
#Iran never broke the terms of the original deal, so why would Iran or anyone in the international community work with us to make a better agreement? And why would #NorthKorea enter into a nuclear deal with us either for that matter if we're just going to break it?
Whether or not the #IranDeal would have succeeded in the long-term, it makes no sense at all to pull out of it right now. Like #Trump's attacks on the #ParisAgreement, #DACA, and #ObamaCare, this feels like nothing more than a reckless, destructive attempt to undo Obama's legacy.
And Gina Haspel seems to be a highly competent, relatively apolitical individual who has followed the law of the time, but she could negatively impact our relationship with other countries, especially our European allies, if confirmed. #GinaHaspel
Pompeo improved on many of Tillerson's flaws by taking advice from former Secretaries of State and exhibiting less of an irrational aversion to career diplomats while also taking extreme positions on the Iran deal and the Paris Climate Agreement. #MikePompeo
I've been on the fence in both of the last two major confirmation battles.
@MelissaAckison Ohio was a bellwether because it was very close to the popular vote most elections. As it was R+10 relative to the popular vote in 2016, it's unlikely that it will continue to be a bellwether, unless Democrats gain back relative ground in the Midwest.
#DennisKucinich and #PaulaJeanSweringen should endorse #RichardCordray and #JoeManchin as quickly as possible. The Democrats need to be unified for the midterms, we can fight each other again once the 2020 primary season rolls around.
#PaulaJeanSwearigen and #DonBlankenship both doing relatively well in #MingoCounty, in the heart of coal country, is really fascinating.
I'm very pleased that it looks like #RichardCordray, #JoeManchin, and #LindaColeman have all won their primaries.
Not sure who I’m routing for in the #WestVirginia #GOP #Senate #Primary. #DonBlankenship probably gives #JoeManchin the best chance of winnning, but it’ll be really depressing to see Blankenship as the elected nominee.
I don’t think there will be strong bipartisan support for the #PopularVote until a Republican wins the PV and loses the #ElectoralCollege. This is completely possible as Democrats had the advantage in the EC in 2004, 2008, and 2012.
I am mostly opposed to the idea of new #TermLimits	Not a fan of #TheSwamp in theory, but in the current political environment, term limits would mostly lead to extremists replacing moderates.
The denial of evolution and climate change by many on the right may have been the precursor to Trump's ability to get away with denying basic facts and logic. #Trump #Truth
I really don’t like Kamala trying to become a Bernie Bro. Overturning Citizen’s United should easily be a top 5 goal for Democrats, but unilaterally disarming is stupid. This may help Kamala in the 2020 primaries but this purity test hurts Democrats. #KamalaHarris #SuperPACs https://t.co/hPxS8GNc7E

Democrats overestimated the importance of Tillerson’s history with Russia and climate change, which is what many foreign policy experts said at the time. He ended up being a bad Secretary of State for other reasons. #RexTillerson
I don't really resent the fact that Trump lost the popular vote and won the election. Irrespective of whether or not I support the electoral college, I would have been perfectly happy if the popular vote and electoral college results were reversed. #ElectoralCollege #PopularVote
@wahwahnyc @paulajean2018 Don't live in WV. I can certainly respect that viewpoint, but I think it's also important for the Democrats to have a shot at winning the Senate. I don't agree that Manchin is a fanatical Trumpist. Remember he voted against the GOP tax and healthcare bills.
I think #ClimateChange is the most important issue facing our country. That being said, I can’t see how electing #PaulaJeanSwearengin wouldn’t just throw #WestVirginia to the GOP. #JoeManchin is electable. #2018SenateElections
What surprised me most about that is that Romney could have rejected Trump’s endorsement and still easily won in Utah. It’s almost like Romney prefers having no dignity when given the chance. #MittRomney #2018SenateElections #UtahSenateRace

@ZiggyTheRedNose I think that rests on the assumption that racism no longer exists. The authors clearly disagree and feel they’re breaking down racial stereotypes. Anyways, I don’t see how someone can see race as an un-mentionable topic while socioeconomic racial disparities clearly persist.
That being said, the fact that James Comey probably should have been fired anyways shouldn’t change how we view the obstruction of justice allegations. #JamesComey
I’m not a big fan of James Comey trying to make himself out as a hero. He handled the email investigation atrociously (and probably caused Trump to win) and then somewhat made up for it by refusing to back off the Russia investigation.  #JamesComey
@JaneHWBB @paulkrugman And more importantly, it sets a good precedent to be cautious with this sort of thing in terms of how allegations against future Democratic Presidents are treated.
@JaneHWBB @paulkrugman Like concrete evidence from the Mueller investigation, etc. I don’t know that I agree that Trump is almost definitely being blackmailed... I think there’s a good chance but that’s just that: a chance.
@paulkrugman I like Krugman, but this thread’s a bit too speculative for my taste. What he’s saying is certainly possible, but let’s wait until we have more evidence before we throw around those kind of accusations.

@clairecmc You were exactly right.

@jameslogletree It was a JOKE.
Something we shouldn't soon forget is the amazing strides we have made when it comes to #LGBTQ rights. In 2008, Obama and Hillary both ran against gay marriage. Now most Republicans don't bother fighting it. That, at least, is something Trump can't easily reverse.

The risk of nuclear war far outweighs any deterrent value. Barack Obama campaigned on non-proliferation, but he never focused enough on it while in office. The United States' goal should not be ambiguous: we want a world free of nuclear weapons. #NuclearWeapons #NonProliferation
Most liberals and some conservatives talk about cutting our huge defense budget, but it is also generally agreed that defense sequestrations are harmful. I would like for a more nuanced discussion to emerge about our defense budget. #DefenseSpending
One thing I am interested in about the Sanders-Warren wing is in how they feel about conservative Democrats — Tester, Heitkamp, Manchin, Donnelly — who win in solidly red states. At what point is keeping the worst out more important than sticking to your guns? #Democrats

@kylewatson1984 But there are people who agree with you about doing away with conferences. Neil Paine of FiveThirtyEight... I think they’re fun.
@kylewatson1984 Miami lost to Pitt, Clemson lost to Syracuse. The playoff selection is not arbitrary, it’s based on how each team played throughout the season. I would say that, if anything, conference championships are more arbitrary (three-loss Stanford qualified, one-loss Alabama did not).
@Jillibean557 Why do you think that exactly? That's a big leap.
@klynn5678910 @SilvaWantana @realDonaldTrump She appears to be referring to the allegations against Trump with the Access Hollywood tape to back them up. Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was at least consensual in a literal sense (ignoring how the power difference between them makes consent complicated).
@klynn5678910 @andrewjgregor 14 women have accused him of sexual assault. How do you know that they are lying?
If there are any allegations where it is misleading to bring up the timing, it is with those concerning Roy Moore. The Washington Post investigated long-existing rumors which LED THEM to Leigh Corfman. She DID NOT seek out the Post once Moore won the primary. #RoyMoore #AlSen

@kylewatson1984 That was on head-to-head with Auburn, their only loss. Teams do not qualify for championships based on overall strength of record.
At this point, I believe that Roy Moore will most likely win. People point out Virginia to show how much the polls underestimate the blue-leaning turnout under Trump, but forget that in New Jersey the polls slightly overestimated Murphy's lead. #AlSen
These last two playoffs have pretty much conclusively shown that the selection committee cares more about overall record than conference championships. #CollegeFootballPlayoff

Mitt Romney should run for the Senate in Utah. While I disagree with him on a lot, he will be able to lead Republicans against Donald Trump. The imminent retirements of Flake, Corker, and likely McCain weakens the mainstream, anti-Trump faction of the GOP. #Romney #2018Elections

@joesoto_6 This whole argument is a bit inane. The US president is a socially constructed concept, so it can be framed in a number of different ways. Nonetheless, I am personally of the mind that, taking the long-term view, accepting Trump as president is the only reasonable thing to do.
@TimonPrax Really? It was under the Obama administration that the economy turned around; and Trump has really just continued Obama's policies with regard to combating ISIS, so I wouldn't say that either of those things are due to Trump being president.

My home state of North Carolina should probably send about 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats to the House. It is so gerrymandered that we currently have 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats in the House. Independent commissions are needed to re-draw congressional districts. #Gerrymandering
Demanding a "thank you" on Twitter for doing your job is bizarre and un-presidential. I can't even imagine any other president doing that. Anyone who thinks we also need to discuss the behavior of LaVar Ball, a private citizen, completely misses the point. #Trump #LaVarBall

It is LONG past time for congress and the president to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The alternatives are:	A. Do nothing (useless and morally wrong)	B. Deport 11 million people (impossible and morally wrong)	I don't even know why it's up for debate at this point.
The Senate naturally leans towards the GOP because low-populated, rural states tend to be conservative and have equal representation to states like CA and NY. However, congressional districts are so gerrymandered that the GOP does even better in the House. #ThatNeedsToChange

I’ve been thinking: why do Sanders supporters talk about the Democratic and Republican “establishment” in the same boat? Do they not understand how far we would have come had we managed to fill political offices with nothing but “establishment” Democrats for the last 20 years?
“Political correctness” is a lie. It was the GOP that made “All Lives Matter” into the most un-nuanced, misleading, and covertly racist cliche in our modern political discourse. #BlackLivesMatter

@MattCFriel @SylviaHandwerg4 Not sure about the point of this... Republicans are always overrepresented in the # of counties won because they are popular among rural voters.
@hottiecaliente @Steph88642946 @francisco_sam @realDonaldTrump Actually, no. Those were different polls. And I think you’re underestimating the HUGE margin gap between these polls.
Plus, the only two caucuses he lost were IA and NV, important states.
Bernie lost the primaries in OH, GA, PA, NC, FL, TX, and AZ. Bernie is popular among independents, but none of those primaries were even within 10 points. It’s true, Bernie might have won as he was polling higher (without attacked from GOP), but it’s probably a &lt;50% chance. 2/2
For all the Bernie Bros who are certain that Bernie would have crushed Trump in 2016, I did a little unscientific speculation on that: based on primary results, Bernie might have won WI and MI, but might have lost VA w/o Kaine. So where would he make up the rest of the gap? 1/2
The media portrays it as HRC’s “fault” she lost because (aside from the veiled sexism) even after the primaries they wrongly assumed that Trump was easier to beat than any other candidate. They spent a year underestimating Trump and now they blame HRC for their stupidity. #2016

@BlazeRushmore @michelemccarrol @vjeannek @D_B_Paralegal @miahfost @ParkerSheri912 @StasiaDeEtte @jstines3 @SenJohnMcCain Let's clarify; rich people "paying more" could mean two different things: ACA increasing demand for health insurance resulting + driving up costs and the projected long-term deficit increases caused by ACA leading to a tax hike (the second one is more dubious). 1/2

I won’t support any of them as strongly as I did HRC, who I think was one of the best candidates for president ever (if not the most electable), but hey, at this point I’ll take it.
Don't get me wrong - I'd love another go at breaking the glass ceiling even if that meant losing, but CA seems precisely the wrong place for the Democrats to look in 2020. And Kamala didn't win any points with me by backing Bernie's healthcare bill.
I am increasingly, cautiously #Biden2020	Not very enthusiastic about Sanders or Warren.	I supported Kamala Harris in the California senate race, but I'm worried about her electability on a national stage.	Regardless, Democrats need to win in 2020, and Biden is really popular.

@realDonaldTrump Someone needs to put these two children in separate rooms.
@realDonaldTrump "Fair trade" deals or fair "trade deals"? The first thing has a specific meaning whereas the second is extremely vague, but I imagine the ambiguity is intentional.
@realDonaldTrump Rasmussen was one of the least accurate polls in 2010 and 2012, now everyone's acting like there some polling gods because they were relatively close in 2016. Polling averages are usually more accurate, which puts you at 37.8%. "Some people think"... very scientific.
Why does anyone believe that WikiLeaks are some sort of transparency-activist idealists? For years, Julian Assange has clearly had an anti-US political agenda just like Putin. Their mutual support for Trump should tell you everything you need to know. #WikiLeaks #Trump

Swing maps from 2012 to 2016 for red, blue, and swing states.

@SunnyDe79068668 @tom_streeter @Grimeandreason @DrJillStein Of course. It would hurt my point if I grouped Sanders supporters and Green Party members with conservatives.

@TheTalent15 @wlkh @NateSilver538 So, in other words, perhaps they should have lauded him less in 2012 (if anyone actually did; I was 14 at the time).
@TheTalent15 @wlkh @NateSilver538 538 does chances not predictions. It always has. You have to look over many different elections before you can accurately assess how accurate it is. How close 538 is, on average, to each state's margin is probably the best indicator.
@SemperMosaddegh @DrJillStein @SemperMosaddegh That's an interesting statement. How do you know that if you don't know which party benefits? Policies are the reason politics affects people, and those vary greatly from party to party.
@TheTalent15 @wlkh @NateSilver538 @thetalent15 From that point of view, there is no difference between a 51% chance and a 100% chance. This is a not a rhetorical question: can't you see that that is fundamentally illogical? And no, it was closer than most elections: they gave Trump much higher odds than Romney.
@RalphNortham won Virginia by 9 points! Clinton-Kaine only won Virginia by 5 points! This sends a message to the GOP that going along with Trump will be a catastrophe.
@GovGaryJohnson 182 of the 270 polls listed on RealClearPolitics had your name on them. There's a significant difference between 0.1% and 67.4%.
@DrJillStein That is the epitome of a false comparison. Yes, there is discrimination against African-Americans in the US justice system. No, that does not say much about US foreign policy.
@DrJillStein What do you plan to accomplish with a recount? If you didn't want @realDonaldTrump to be president, you took the wrong course of action.
@DrJillStein Either you are misinformed or you are a liar. Do people believe this nonsense?
@DrJillStein It's in your interest to support ranked voting, but depth of support should matter as much as broadness of support. Plus, isn't anyone from the Green Party worried about empowering people from the Libertarian or Constitution Party?
