Thanks to the @TucsonChamber for hosting over 800 business leaders today at my Tucson #AZSOTS!
May God bless us in that work, and may God forever bless and protect the great State of Arizona and the United States of America. #AZSOTS
We made a difference. We made this great state stronger; we made it freer; 	 and we left her in good hands. #AZSOTS
To borrow a sentiment from President Reagan I will be uplifted knowing we weren't just marking time. #AZSOTS
Ten years from now ‚Äì whether I run again or not ‚Äì I will be working in my garden, and will look back with pride. #AZSOTS
We should aspire here to rank among the best of those. #AZSOTS
Great men and great women have walked these chambers, and graced these grounds with their honorable public service. #AZSOTS
I‚Äôve been returning to the Capitol now for more than 30 years uniting with my fellow public servants. #AZSOTS
Protecting our military is good for Arizona ‚Äì and good for America. #AZSOTS
The money will be used to mitigate property encroachment and preserve military land use projects.  #AZSOTS
I am calling on the Legislature to renew support for the Military Installation Fund. #AZSOTS
I will direct the Military Affairs Commission to develop a strategic plan for sustaining their missions. #AZSOTS
Arizona military bases together contribute more than $9 billion to our economy annually ‚Äì while safe-guarding our great country. #AZSOTS
Students expect it. And Arizona‚Äôs tax-paying parents deserve it! #AZSOTS
I am asking our AZ Board of Regents to develop a plan that guarantees stable in-state tuition levels. #AZSOTS
Arizona students and families need stability and affordability in their college education. #AZSOTS
We will reward improved student performance and we will incentivize and replicate success. #AZSOTS
I am asking legislators to approve an ambitious and historic education proposal, which I call Student Success Funding. #AZSOTS
We must stop funding the status quo‚Ä¶ and instead reward innovation and measured outcomes ‚Ä¶ and fund the results we want. #AZSOTS
By 2018, three out of five jobs in Arizona will require post-secondary training. #AZSOTS
None of our progress toward economic prosperity will ultimately work if we do not improve our K-12 schools. #AZSOTS
It is imperative to have a stable, dedicated funding source for TGen. #AZSOTS
This type of innovative, research-driven and idea-to-market manufacturing system produces good jobs and a healthy economy. #AZSOTS
The drug is produced and developed only in Arizona in Arizona thanks to a partnership with TGen, Scottsdale Healthcare and others. #AZSOTS
I toured the Celgene plant in West Phoenix, which makes a drug that treats several forms of cancer. #AZSOTS
I‚Äôm asking you to send me legislation to eliminate this tax and increase Arizona‚Äôs competitive edge! #AZSOTS
Arizona imposes a sales tax on manufacturers for the power used to create their products. #AZSOTS
I am calling on the Legislature to approve a package to further boost Arizona‚Äôs business competitiveness. #AZSOTS
To the criminal traffickers, I say: Your days are numbered! #AZSOTS
To all the victims of human trafficking out there: We have not forgotten you, don‚Äôt give up, help is on the way. #AZSOTS
I will create a Human Trafficking Council to coordinate efforts statewide to address this crime. #AZSOTS
I ask you to strengthen AZ law to give prosecutors and law enforcement more tools to combat this evil and better protect victims. #AZSOTS
Human trafficking traumatizes 27 million victims worldwide. #AZSOTS
We are working to create a model for states dealing with another challenge: human trafficking. #AZSOTS
The agreement it is structured so if a future Governor or Legislature fails to live up to its terms, plaintiffs can reopen the case. #AZSOTS
I was proud to announce last week an agreement ‚Äì subject to final court approval ‚Äì that will end the Arnold v. Sarn litigation. #AZSOTS
As governor, I insisted that we properly fund and fundamentally reform behavioral health into a holistic, community-based system. #AZSOTS
For over 30 yrs, Arizona has been forced to live under court direction because we failed our Seriously Mentally ill population. #AZSOTS
I call on the Legislature to work with me to codify a new permanent agency. #AZSOTS
I‚Äôve asked Charles Flanagan to serve as the director. #AZOSTS
The Order establishes a new Division of Child Safety and Family Services with its own Cabinet-level Director who reports to me. #AZSOTS
This morning, I signed an Executive Order that abolishes CPS as we know it. #AZSOTS
Enough with uninvestigated reports of abuse and neglect! Enough with the lack of transparency! ENOUGH with the EXCUSES! #AZSOTS
But our job is far from over. Our child welfare system is broken ‚Äì impeded by years of structural and operational failures. #AZSOTS
I also want to express my appreciation to Charles Flanagan, the entire CARE Team, and the CPS staff working with them. #AZSOTS
Nearly all of the cases have been assigned and more than 3,000 children have been seen by CPS staff or local law enforcement. #AZSOTS
Thanks to OCWI, we discovered the horrifying truth that some at CPS failed to investigate thousands of reports of child abuse. #AZSOTS
We created the Office of Child Welfare Investigations as an instrumental first step. #AZSOTS
I know this: All of us care ‚Ä¶ and Arizona MUST do better. #AZSOTS
Our immediate challenge is to transform our child protection system to ensure the safety of Arizona‚Äôs abused and neglected children. #AZSOTS
Together, we have pursued and protected the values most important to Arizona‚Äôs families ‚Äì and Arizona‚Äôs future. #AZSOTS
I confidently proclaim that the spirit of Arizona is strong ‚Ä¶ and so is the state of our state. #AZSOTS
We stood united in saying to Washington: Keep the Grand Canyon open! Government should never close that which God has created. #AZSOTS
Arizona is ranked in the Top 10 by CEOs nationwide and Forbes Magazine recognized us as the #1 state for expected job growth. #AZSOTS
Our message to job creators has been heard: Arizona is open for business! #AZSOTS
We LOWERED business property and equipment taxes, corporate income taxes and capital gains taxes. #AZSOTS
With help from the @AZCommerce and our tax reforms, employers have created nearly 175K new jobs with $4.3B in new capital investment #AZSOTS
We ended this past fiscal year with nearly 900 million dollars in the bank. 	There is no doubt: Arizona is BACK ON TRACK! #AZSOTS
In 2009, Arizona had a 3 billion dollar deficit. Now, Arizona boasts a healthy state surplus and a replenished Rainy Day Fund. #AZSOTS
Today, Arizona‚Äôs fiscal house is in order and, together, let‚Äôs keep it that way. #AZSOTS
I am proud of the progress we‚Äôve made in the past 5 years to bring about the Arizona Comeback. #AZSOTS
That June day will forever be etched into our hearts ‚Ä¶ the brave 19 and their families forever in our prayers. #AZSOTS
This past year, Arizona experienced one of the worst tragedies in our history as we lost 19 heroic firefighters at Yarnell Hill. #AZSOTS
Overcoming this challenge would be difficult and painful. It would require honest leadership and tough decision-making. #AZSOTS
When I stood here for the first time as Governor, we faced the task of guiding AZ out of the bleakest recession in our history. #AZSOTS
I was terribly saddened to lose Ben Miranda. Let us pray that his spirit of public service lives on in all of us.  #AZSOTS
It‚Äôs my pleasure to welcome back Representative Doris Goodale - we‚Äôre all gratified to see you here.  #AZSOTS
"Mr. Speaker, now introducing..." #AZSOTS
Happy Opening Day! Stay tuned for live tweets of my 2014 State of the State address! #AZSOTS

My FY14 #budget focuses on child safety, performance K-12 funding and #AZ Medicaid expansion. Read more about it here: http://t.co/RgRFVAJw
My FY14 #budget is balanced through a disciplined, conservative approach. Read more about it here: http://t.co/RgRFVAJw #AZCompetes #AZ
Check out my new Tumblr page at http://t.co/PxBMHKPe where you can find news, photos and info about what we're doing in #Arizona.
Thanks to @PhxChildrens for their support of Medicaid expansion. It is the right thing to do for #Arizona. #AZCompetes http://t.co/Chjo6Pu7
Proud to see Arizona was named the 2013 #ProLife All-Star by @AUL, a great honor for our state! #AZ http://t.co/nbNg6QGj
Business and healthcare leaders in Arizona have made it clear: They support #Medicaid expansion. #AZCompetes http://t.co/o1OhmF9q
I‚Äôm proud to stand with #AZ leaders in #business and #healthcare in support of #Medicaid expansion. #AZCompetes http://t.co/4aJ9wdgD
In #Arizona, we have set the economic agenda for the #Southwest. States like #NM are following our lead on #taxes and growth. #AZCompetition
ICYMI, I joined @broomheadshow on @KFYI yesterday to talk #SotS2013 and #Medicaid expansion. Listen to the replay here: http://t.co/W61igCEt
Honored to be in #Tucson to deliver the #SotS2013 today, thanks to the @TucsonChamber for hosting! #AZ
I will be joining @broomheadshow at 5pm to discuss the #SotS2013 and the other issues facing #AZ. Listen live here: http://t.co/ZDo3tAGg
God bless you, God bless America and God bless the great State of Arizona. #AZ #sots2013 #tcot
I know that Arizona's best days are yet to come. #AZ #sots2013
Just as when I entered this chamber 30 years ago, I am filled with optimism. #AZ #sots2013
Arizona's challenges are great, but not greater than our capacity to meet them. This is Arizona's legacy. #sots2013
As we gather this session, let us put the best interests of #AZ above all else. Because that is what we are called to do. #sots2013
I ask the President to finish the job. Secure the Tucson border, the most heavily traveled gateway for illegal crossings. #AZ #sots2013
Once our border is secure, I pledge to work with all people to reform our nation's immigration system. #sots2013
Arizona knows BEST how to manage its own resources. #sots2013
#AZ has been a national leader when it comes to battling federal mandates and pushing the Feds to live up to their duties. #sots2013
We are lucky to have 12 year old Shelby with us today. Learn more about Shelby's story here: http://t.co/3rruyCmE #AZ #sots2013
Amazing things can happen in Arizona when we work together as leaders and encourage innovation and partnership. #AZ #sots2013
I'll be releasing more details about my Medicaid plan in the days to ahead. Weigh the evidence and do the math. #AZ #sots2013
AHCCCS is not the problem. It is the solution, the gold standard for cost-effective managed care in this country. #AZ #sots2013
I won't allow ObamaCare to become a bait-and-switch. #AZ #sots2013
Any expansion of #Az Medicaid will include a circuit-breaker that rolls back enrollment if reimbursement rates drop. #sots2013
Together with my team, I've crafted a plan to address concerns and safeguard Arizona. #sots2013
This amounts to a hidden tax estimated at nearly 2K dollars per family, per year. #sots2013
Under the current system, these costs are passed along to #Az families. #sots2013
With this move, we will secure a revenue stream to cover the costs of the uninsured who already show up in our emergency rooms. #sots2013
Remember: Arizona citizens have TWICE voted to expand Medicaid coverage and I will fight to uphold the will of the voters. #Az #sots2013
Saying no to this plan would not save these dollars from being spent or direct them to deficit reduction. #AZ #sots2013
Of course, I'm speaking about Arizona's Medicaid program and expanded coverage in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. #sots2013
We cannot simply wag our finger at the federal government. Trust me: I tried that once. #Az #sots2013
Arizona's future is also tied to another critical decision. #sots2013
Our new Common Core standards are tied to the top education measures in the world. We'll know if #Az schools aren't doing the job.
Working with parents and schools, lets help ensure today's struggling reader doesn't become tomorrow's dropout. #az #sots2013
I'm so proud the #az legislature joined me last year in funding the Move on When Reading program. #sots2013
Lets come together for the safety of our schools, allowing our teachers and children to focus on what's important: learning. #az #sots2013
We have a responsibility to make sure our children have a safe place to learn. #az #sots2013 #tcot
We must take steps that will simplify out sales tax code to help our small business owners. #az #sots2013
The @azcommerce has already helped deliver more than 680 million dollars in capital investment and six thousand jobs. #AZ #sots2013
In the new economy, talent is king and competition is worldwide. The ACA will continue to lead our job-attraction efforts. #sots2013
Where they've hampered private industry with excessive rules and regulation, we've marshaled the power of the free market. #AZ #sots2013
It's no surprise that we in #AZ have created a model of recovery very different than that pursued by the administration in DC. #SotS2013
These past four years, we have faced moral challenges. My friends, this too is a moral issue. #AZ must protect her children. #SotS2013
I'm asking legislators to join me in approving an emergency budget request to hire 50 additional caseworkers right now. #AZ #sots2013
We can start by taking action on behalf of some of Arizona's most vulnerable: Arizona's abused and neglected children. #AZ #sots2013
Lets honor their sacrifice by giving the very best of ourselves every day in our service. #AZ #SotS2013
And I am confident that Arizona's light of opportunity will shine as bright as the #AZ sun in the years to come. #sots2013
In 2010, we asked the people to increase their own taxes and promised it would be temporary. We kept that promise. #sots2013 #AZ
We limited regulations and passed the largest and most strategic tax cuts in #AZ history - unlike leaders in DC. #sots2013
Together, we've made great strides in the last 4 years to improve Arizona's competitive position. #sots2013 #az
#AZ must compete for the most desirable jobs for our citizens and the finest students/faculty in our schools and universities. #sots2013
I am here to tell you that our second century will hang on another C: Competition. #sots2013
We have just celebrated all of the achievements of Arizona's first 100 years, and we were reminded of Arizona's "Five C's" #sots2013
For all the change across these 30 years, much remains the same. I am grateful to have a family that is my rock of support. #SotS2013 #AZ
Three decades ago, nearly to the day, I entered this chamber for the first time as a legislator. #SotS2013 #AZ #tcot
Less than two days until the #SotS2013, RT if you believe #AZ is ready to do big things this year! #tcot
According to @ChiefExecGrp rankings, #AZ was a Top 10 State for #Business in 2012. I am confident 2013 will show the same results! #SotS2013
I'm very proud of the #AZ comeback, but this comeback isn't about government. It's about businessmen and women. #lfl2013 #tcot
Happy to be a part of today's @azchamber #2013 Legislative Forecast Luncheon. They have been a great advocate for tax reform in #AZ
Glad to have repdavid and @RepMattSalmon in #Congress fighting for #AZ http://t.co/EKTKb8yM
We‚Äôve made great strides in turning the #AZ economy around but we can do even better by reforming our #tax code this year. #SotS2013
#AZ was ranked the #1 state in the #US for entrepreneurs in 2012 by @KauffmanFDN. Arizona is truly home to innovators and creators #SotS2013
Great morning meeting with #AZ freshman legislators. Very impressive group, ready to do big things in #2013 http://t.co/2DEtlt8s
In November 2012, over 22K non-farm jobs were created right here in #AZ. I believe #2013 will bring even more jobs to our state. #SotS2013
#AZ is top 10! MT: @The_RGA: 13 out of the top 15 states ranked for small business friendliness led by #GOP Governors: http://t.co/Kzj1g0Rz
Looking forward to next Monday's #SotS2013 address. Proud of what #AZ has accomplished and I know the future is even brighter!

Goddard embraces Obama‚Äôs increased spending mantra. Taxes on groceries, doctor‚Äôs visits, & dentist visits? http://bit.ly/abcfFG
Obama's growth of gov programs killing economic recovery. Now, Dems want double down. AZ can't afford it. http://bit.ly/cPeyID
AZ GOP legislators return UFCW endorsement over boycott. Goddard & Dems stick with boycott cartels. http://bit.ly/caSNFL
Day 230 and still no budget plan from Goddard. Wrong on Obamacare. Offers no plan of his own. http://bit.ly/djZhOD
Now, more than ever is the time to say no to the boycott cartel.  http://bit.ly/aIDFMj
Goddard and Dems continue to lament their years of overspending, but offer no plans of their own.
I am proud of Proposition 100 protecting education and public safety.  We have been getting the job done for Arizona.
Thank you to everyone who showed up to watch the debate tonight.  I am proud of my track record in leading Arizona's comeback. #AZGovDebate
Terry Goddard:  Wrong on immigration.  Wrong on Obamacare.  Wrong on boycott.  No plan.  www.GoddardisWrong.com  #AZGovDebate
Paperwork to come tomorrow.  There is proof that Goddard signed off on the prison reclassificiation.  #AzGovDebate
Goddard signed off on prison reclassification during Napolitano administration.  #AZGovDebate
The only plan that Goddard has is actually borrowed from what we have already done.  http://bit.ly/9NSrB4 #AZGovDebate
"Goddard cut from same cloth as Obama administration." #AzGovDebate
Goddard didn't sue on Obamacare because he supports it.  Arizona does not.  Another reason www.GoddardisWrong.com #AzGovDebate
Get ready.  Terry Goddard is about to be wrong on Obamacare.  #AZGovDebate

I am proud of the Race to the Top and we will use it to reform schools.  Social promotion will no longer happen in AZ.  #AZGovDebate
"Napolitano made some mistakes."  - Terry Goddard  FINALLY he admits.
Goddard laments cuts to education without offering any plans of his own.  I backed Prop 100.  Goddard checked the political winds.
I am the only candidate who stood tall on Prop 100 to protect education and public safety.  #AzGovDebate
Napolitano spent rainy day fund when it wasn't raining and Goddard is surprised with the results.  #AZGovDebate
Goddard runningmate Napolitano creates mess with overspending and then won't take the blame.
Goddard likes my commerce authority.  Wish he would have helped with his budget plans.  #AZGovDebate
I am proud of my support from the Arizona Police Association and the Fraternal Order of Police.  #AZGovDebate
Goddard opposed Prop 200, employer sanctions, and SB1070.  Now, he is quoting them on how Arizona is taking the lead?
Goddard and Obama thinks AZ is safe.  Does this look safe to you?  http://bit.ly/9zlkTO #AZGovDebate
If Goddard opposes the boycott, he should refuse the endorsement of anyone actively boycotting the state.  #AZGovDebate
Goddard supports Obama's immigration plan.  Yet another reason www.GoddardisWrong.com #AZGovDebate
SB 1070 has united America against Illegal Immigration.  Goddard opposes.  #AZGovDebate
It has been 229 days without a plan from Goddard.  Don't expect one tonight.  #AZGovDebate

@Playmaker4747 usually they either collect way more taxes, provide lower standards of healthcare, or a combo of both.
@Playmaker4747 Jeff, regardless of anyone's feelings about healthcare, AZ cannot afford what this bill mandates. We just don't have the $$
