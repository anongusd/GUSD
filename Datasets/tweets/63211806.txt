@asnider I was too young at 15 or 16, and had to convince my grandfather to grant me access on his laptop so I could do at least one.
@asnider I just wanted to let you know I thoroughly enjoyed your portrayal, and RIP Cody Jarret, though I couldn't be there when he started.
@asnider Hello DRTUNA, I was in #NADW for your portrayal of the 10th Doctor, but only in one part of Foe's Den, filling in for Rob as Irish.

@ZeitgeistFilm I know that imperfection is why Communism never works; while  imperfect people try to run a perfect system, it never will.
@ZeitgeistFilm I know what I've said here will not change your view. I said so expecting that it won't, and knowing nobody's perfect.
@ZeitgeistFilm My question would be, are we any better than they are under those circumstances? I appreciate your work. Just my two cents.
@ZeitgeistFilm I truly agree with your films, except Bilderberg, CFR, and Trilateral are godless; by nature of Marx's Communist Manifesto.
