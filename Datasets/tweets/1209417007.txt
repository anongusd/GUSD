A new low for Democrats ‚Üí By voting to make it harder for domestic violence victims to protect themselves from abusers, Democrats proved to the American people that they aren‚Äôt serious about preventing gun violence and are instead just interested in pushing their liberal agenda. https://t.co/g2Tg9GyGao
Every day in this country guns are used by good people to defend themselves against bad people and H.R. 8 is going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns. This is a bad gun control bill that does nothing but criminalize law-abiding citizens.
Democrats say there is an exemption for hunting in the bill, but it‚Äôs written so vaguely that if you want to loan your gun to a hunting buddy, you might need to bring along your attorney to find out if loaning a shotgun to your friend makes you a criminal.
Under this bill, a woman might have to wait 20 business days to get a gun to protect herself from domestic violence if the NICS system isn‚Äôt working. If she borrows a firearm for self-defense, the friend who loans her a gun would face a year in prison and up to a $100,000 fine.
I strongly oppose the gun control bills brought forward this week under the guise of background checks. Republicans identified many problems with this bill and the Democrat majority shut out almost every one of our solutions.
Democrats should just call Medicare For All what it is: a radical government-run, socialist health care program that forces 158 million Americans off their plans and costs taxpayers even more than Bernie Sanders‚Äô $32 trillion dollar plan. https://t.co/KhtCe8oBgw

The Democrat gun control bills will make criminals out of law-abiding citizens‚Äîyet they won‚Äôt allow an illegal immigrant who fails a background check while trying to buy a gun to be turned over to ICE. That‚Äôs disgraceful, and it shows their true intentions. https://t.co/AQxocoRQyH
I‚Äôm joining The @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews tonight to share my story and the truth about the Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week: it‚Äôs not a serious attempt to prevent gun violence, and instead aims to take away the rights of law-abiding U.S. citizens.
These are only a few of the real atrocities caused by illegal immigrant crime. Democrats calling this emergency fake owe an apology to #AngelFamilies and an explanation to the American people about what exactly their plan is to stop these preventable tragedies.
And just recently in Florida, an unborn child was killed by an illegal immigrant who then fled the scene of the crime. https://t.co/wiWkNSEtAg
In Speaker Pelosi's own backyard an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times recently shot at a sheriff‚Äôs deputy. How can Democrats ignore this? https://t.co/m1Rlb9Mysx
How can Democrats call the crisis at our border fake when day after day we see heinous crimes committed by illegal immigrants against innocent Americans? It's not a fake crisis for the child molested by an illegal alien that snuck back into the country. https://t.co/ty92cNcr0z
Democrats just voted to try to cancel the National Emergency @realDonaldTrump declared to secure our southern border. This is a slap in the face to our experts who put their lives on the line to protect our country and are pleading for more resources to combat the border crisis. https://t.co/aXn2ceQ4Pv
The Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week is more about taking rights away from law-abiding U.S. citizens than stopping gun violence. https://t.co/1Zh9WUitVj

Democrats refused to listen to my testimony as a survivor of gun violence and supporter of the 2nd Amendment because they're only interested in hearing from liberal gun control advocates.

Fortunately, @realDonaldTrump made a promise to the American people to build wall in areas where drugs, human trafficking, and criminals flow freely into the U.S., and this deal ensures he has the flexibility and access to funds to build more wall and secure America‚Äôs border.
It‚Äôs a shame that Speaker Pelosi continues to ignore the recommendations of the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our border, and refuses to support the full $5.7 billion requested for physical barriers.
I applaud @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to sign this funding bill, as well as the steps he's taking to keep America safe. $1.375 billion in funding for 55 miles of badly-needed border wall is a big step, but clearly falls short of what Republicans wanted and what @POTUS requested.

During the next three weeks of this short-term agreement, Pelosi and Schumer need to stop playing partisan games and finally take serious steps to address the humanitarian and safety risks at the southern border while also reaching a long-term agreement on government funding.
One thing is clear from this last 35 days: Pelosi and Schumer would rather force the longest government shutdown in our history than fund border security that is critical to the safety of our nation.
Yet each time, Pelosi and Schumer refused to come to the table or even present a counteroffer. Now, once again, President Trump is exhibiting leadership by agreeing to re-open even though we still haven‚Äôt reached an agreement on border security.
Time and time again, President Trump proposed reasonable solutions that would open the government and secure our borders, while also including policies that Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have previously supported.
Over the last month, Speaker Pelosi and liberals in Washington have put their personal differences with President Trump over the security of our border and the paychecks of federal workers.

This is why we need the wall: Nearly 17,000 criminals were apprehended at the border last year, many smuggling deadly drugs. ICE saved over 900 children from human trafficking last year.
Our border is in crisis. Here are the facts: Over the past 2 months, border patrol saw a nearly 90% increase in the # of attempted illegal crossings compared to the same time last year‚Äîa 44% increase in unaccompanied minors alone. There are almost 2,000 inadmissible entries a day
Here‚Äôs the reality: Walls work. Illegal traffic has dropped over 95% in Yuma over 9 years since a wall was built there in 2005, over 90% over 15 years in Tucson where a wall exists, and over 92% in the area of San Diego with a wall over the last 23 years.

While Democrats may have won the House by running a fear-mongering campaign, unfortunately their reckless legislating has not proven to be as effective for the American people who have to live under this failed system.
Not only does tonight's ruling confirm that this broken law cannot hold up under court scrutiny, but it also affirms that the law does not actually protect people with preexisting conditions.
Over the last 8 years since it was signed into law, we have found out that the Democrats who passed it caused millions of families to lose the plans and doctors they liked, and imposed unaffordable premiums and deductibles that undermine the basic coverage that families enjoy.
When Democrats forced Obamacare down the throats of the American people on a purely partisan basis, they threatened that the law needed to be passed so that people could find out what was in it.

His legacy will loom large in so many ways, but none more than in his five children and 17 grandchildren, many of whom are already paying tribute to his life of public service by continuing on in his footsteps.
While we all mourn his loss, we gain solace in knowing that he is finally reunited with his beloved wife of 73 years, Barbara.

I find it disingenuous when some in the media refuse to report or call out actual violence by leftist protestors, yet they‚Äôll whip into a hysterical frenzy over what clearly was a joke at a rally. This is about which party has the best ideas, not which party has the most bullies.
It‚Äôs irresponsible for the mainstream media to create a false equivalence between this and Democrat leaders in Washington regularly using threatening rhetoric to call on their supporters to harass Trump officials, supporters, and Republican members and candidates.
President Trump was clearly ribbing Congressman Gianforte for last year‚Äôs incident, which he apologized for last year. It‚Äôs obvious he was not encouraging his supporters to engage in attacks, and not one person harassed the numerous media reporters who were present.

While Democrats visit New Orleans to tout their radical, out-of-touch agenda, we'll keep working with @realDonaldTrump to address issues that actually affect American workers and families by implementing policies to grow the economy, create jobs, and strengthen national security.
Last year, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement agents saved 900+ kids from sexual assault or human trafficking. While Republicans voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE &amp; the work they do to protect America, the majority of Democrats voted "present" &amp; 34 voted against it.
The economy isn't the only place Republicans and Democrats differ. When it comes to enforcing the law, some on the Left would rather not. Sen Harris thinks it's outrageous that a criminal who is here illegally would be deported, and many Democrats want to abolish ICE entirely.
A Louisiana restaurant owner told me the #TaxCuts have led to more people eating out at her restaurant. Another family used the extra money to make home repairs. People are seeing real results. Democrats want to raise taxes on your family. We want to make your tax cuts permanent.
While Senator Booker was calling the Republican policies that created jobs &amp; gains for workers "reckless, unjust, and just plain cruel," Americans everywhere were getting to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks and seeing new opportunities to achieve the American Dream.
