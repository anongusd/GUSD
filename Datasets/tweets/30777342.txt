@AhedElTamimi what have Arabs and Muslims done for the world besides cause a resurgence in anti-semitism, hate against West , Christians , rape, and murder ? Israel has done so much good for the world.
@AhedElTamimi the real reason for no peace for Arab-Israeli conflict is the incite , denial of israel , denial of Jewish connections and anti-semitism
@AhedElTamimi Judaism is the oldest monolithic religion , compared to Christianity and Islam . Get ducking educated
@AhedElTamimi when the U.N. partition plan happened Jew‚Äôs accepted the proposal , the Arabs did not which causes the conflict in the first place
@AhedElTamimi there has never been a Palestinian state up until 1964 when the PLO was formed.
@palestininianpr The arabs created the Palestinian problem. Originally they were arabs. After they fled Israel and into Arab states They were put in refugee camps and basically told your not Arab your Palestinian. #Truth #Israel #Wakeup
@palestininianpr There was no Palestinian state until 1964 when the PLO was formed. Get fucking educated. When the UN partition plan took place the Jews accepted the proposal, the Arabs didn't and they attacked Israel.
@palestininianpr You should change your twitter description addicted to fake news. There is no occupation. Palestinians in Gaza and Arabs in the arab world are taught to hate Jews, Christians, the west, and think of Israel as a colonial power.

@leah_lovely_x @GaetaSusan I agree watch this https://t.co/qQ1G88DO7n. Blacks Say Whites Who Think "Voter ID Laws Are Racist" Are Ignorant Racists.
@GaetaSusan The Dems say voting ID laws are racist. They really think minorities are incapable of getting a drivers license, or a passport. Thats why!..
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Build the Wall!! https://t.co/9Wm7sQD4qy we need to help finish this campaign for the border wall!
@bfraser747 I agree but dems SAY OH VOTER ID LAWS are racist. NO it isn't blacks have come far enough where they can get an ID. You need an ID to drive!
