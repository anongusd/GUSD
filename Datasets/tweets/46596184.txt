@rebeccanagle @billykeene22 @canoecanoa @jbendery @PaulHRosenberg Apologize you are correct, I was told the SOS was conservative and thats why it was released by him.
@SenCapito @SenCapito Manufactured Crisis! The WH, GOP and You are lying! Where has the Ethics and Morals of the GOP gone? Stand up and Lead for WV citizens @SenCapito
@billykeene22 @rebeccanagle @canoecanoa @jbendery @PaulHRosenberg The vitriol here is pretty off the Richter scale. Current CN leadership is known as extremely conservative and is looking out for its business interest first. And it seems this entire conversation is missing the point of the @PaulHRosenberg article.

@SenCapito @FCC @AjitPaiFCC @SenCapito Commissioner Carr voted to end Net Neutrality ensuring that large corporations can kill any small and local #WV competition on the internet. Again showing your disdain for teh citizens of #WV. Shame @Sen Capito.
@SenCapito @ONDCP @SenCapito Director Carrol has no Public Health or Drug Policy experience and has limited enforcement experience as a prosecutor in VA. Your judgement to confirm this man to lead @ONDCP shows once again how you have failed #WV most vulnerable citizens.

@cnnbrk the Maryland Governor Hogan has called for investigation prior to vote. Isn’t he in charge of state police?
The BIA is gathering comment on terminating the CDIB program. This is yet another proposal from the Trump Admin that would drastically rewrite decades of AIAN Law and the bedrock by which current Indian policy relies. All in an effort to terminate the trust responsibility. https://t.co/3jgj0JUOKF
@JerryWayne4554 @AnnCoulter This is not court as the GOP has reiterated continually. If it was, these individuals that have denied any memory of anything would be witnesses under oath and an investigation would be conducted. The fact that none of these are occurring is the real damage to the legal system.
