CNN's @barbarastarrcnn reporting the ISIS leader's real name live. http://t.co/wt0Nsw8oQi
“While he had a number of aliases, we believe his real name to have been Fathi Ben Awn Ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi,” a US official said.
The U.S. government had been using his nom de guerre: Abu Sayyef.
From @barbarastarrcnn: US Official: the real name of the ISIS leader killed in weekend raid is Fathi Ben Awn Ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi.
US forces captured some of his communications equipment. There was hand to hand combat during the operation, sources told @barbarastarrcnn.
There is reason to believe Abu Sayyaf may have been in contact with ISIS leader Al Baghdadi, sources familiar told @barbarastarrcnn.
Sources: U.S. forces kill ISIS figure in Syria http://t.co/WtJOkmGJCj
This took place at a residential building in Dayr Az Zawr in eastern Syria.
All U.S. troops returned safely. About a dozen ISIS fighters were killed in the firefight.
Abu Sayyaf was in charge of ISIS' oil and gas operations and directly and increasingly involved in ISIS command and control.
Sayyaf fought capture and was killed in the raid. His wife, an Iraqi named Umm Sayyaf, was captured and taken to Iraq for interrogation.
