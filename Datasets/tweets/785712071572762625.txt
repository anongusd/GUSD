@italiangirl7286 Thicken the first 3 in a sauce pan, then add the rest.. goes great with shrimp or chicken.  Thanks for all your help!  I’ll keep you posted on the meatballs!!😘
@italiangirl7286 Here’s the best Alfredo I’ve found so far.. (well, I stopped looking after this..).   PS. your daughter must be very lucky to have a Mom that cooks special dishes for her!  My husband isn’t picky, THANK GOD. https://t.co/BeJYFR3yAm
@italiangirl7286 I like Romano cheese too.  I bought Kosher salt, but I don’t think I’ve ever takken the wrapper off the top.  Lol.  Just my luck, I’d eff up my recipe.
@italiangirl7286 I do now!!  THANK TOU SO MUCH!  I’m making some this week.  I did make a killer Alfredo Sauce this week.  I’ll write it down and send a pic... if you ever want to try it out.
@italiangirl7286 Yea, I’ve made dry meatballs before, and I thought  the onions might help.  Obviously not.  😬.   No oregano or basil...  i promise, this week, I’m trying yours Syracuse used to have a meatball mix you could buy by the pound...  so I could cheat when I lived there.  (Ascotti’s).
@italiangirl7286 Sure, diced onions, garlic powder, oregano, basil,  parsley, parm cheese, the beef, pork, eggs and breadcrumbs.  I think thats it..  oh, salt and pepper.  I roll them kinda loosely, baked them, but last week mine turned out like bowling balls..
@italiangirl7286 How much bread crumbs?  Do you add milk at all?  I grew up surrounded by awesome old Itailian ladies that were great cooks... unfortunately they’re gone.. and I go from memory.  Which obviously sucks.  Lol!
@italiangirl7286 OK... writing this down!
@italiangirl7286 Really?
@italiangirl7286 I will do try that this week.
@italiangirl7286 2 eggs
@italiangirl7286 2 beef, 1 pork..
@italiangirl7286 I use dry breadcrumbs or panko crumbs, Beef, pork.. and wine (for me).  Do you actually use bread?  Wet?   Fried or baked?  That even sounds better...!  I just froze a huge batch of roma tomatos for my next batch of sauce. Yours looked sooo good! https://t.co/P0OKzqXN9Y
@barstoolsports @KFCradio @cyantist 5 F.. real butter (Kerrygold).
@italiangirl7286 Woops, that was the wrong pic.  Sauce was good, meatballs... nah, not this time.  I keep trying tho! https://t.co/6J9azHM0kO
@italiangirl7286 I wish... I actually threw out the meatballs.  Way too many bread crumbs.    Not sure what I was thinking. https://t.co/vOtQNpdbvM
