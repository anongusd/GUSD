It is hard to believe the Republicans on this committee that they are treating these allegations seriously or Dr. Ford with respect, when all they are doing is attacking the process by which people learned about these allegations.
Well, not one of them spoke to her, except for the Chairman.  They outsourced their questions until Dr. Ford left and Judge Kavanaugh arrived.		Now they are all attacking consideration of her allegations.		So, we may have different definitions of respect. https://t.co/nopJpb5A63
This is not a hearing about the allegations, or whether they are true.		This is a hearing about the process that led to this hearing.		There still has not been an investigation.		There really should be.
Sen. Hatch begins by saying we should respect both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh with fair treatment and respect.		Then goes on to attack discussion of Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations.
I understand the chatter about Graham‚Äôs anger serving as a rallying cry for GOP.		But the many women who were moved by Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony could have a VERY different reaction.		Don‚Äôt be surprised to see Sen. Graham‚Äôs comments in digital ads targeting suburban women nationwide.
