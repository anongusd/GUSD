With wholesale sharing of spectrum, a major government investment in American made 5G terchnology, a broad collaboration that includes Samsung, Nokia, Ericson, Qualcom and other companies, the United States can leapfrog the Chinese 5G effort. Without it we will simply lose.
A negative anti-Huawei campaign will fail. There is already overwhelming evidence that country after country is rejecting the effort into pressuring them to not use Huawei on securitygrounds. The United States must focus on developing a better, lower cost model.
The Chinese through Huawei have established a big lead in 5G technology. President Trump is the first national leader to recognize that our national security, our economy and rural America all require American leadership in 5G.
President Trump is exactly right to call for an American 5G program. America needs a new approach that is open tomeveryone through A wholesale approach that will lower prices, accelerate innovation and return leadership in this key technology to America.

Who is paying for this Central American caravan of 3,000 people so they can attack American sovereignty?if this caravan succeeds how big will the next one be? Why do news media and the Democrats favor law breakers?

The other great advantage of Kevin McCarthy‚Äôs bill to control the border is the impact it would have on stopping human trafficking. Thousands of young women cross the border to be sold into forced prostitution. McCarthy‚Äôs bill would help save them.
Kevin McCarthy has the only practical, intellectually honest response to the wave of drugs and violent gangs crossing our southern border. The choice is clear.Democrats favor open borders,sanctuary cities and acceptance of MS-13 gangs and killer drug importation.
Kevin McCarthy‚Äôs new bill to complete the wall and gain clear control of our southern border is vital for our safety. Fentanyl and carfentanyl kill.last year 74,000 Americans died from drug overdoses(more than were killed in the 8 years in Vietnam).MS-13 gangs have to be stopped.

Mueller is setting up a dragnet of obstruction, financial questions and every aspect of Trump's life and his associates lives.very dangerous
Muelleris now clearly the ti[p of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and crippling the Trump presidency.
Should now be clear Mueller is the "anti-Trump special counsel". Karl Rove warns in WSJ oped today"special counsels can run amok".

The history of cable television will have a very big chapter oin Roger Ailes. Without his success at FoxNews Trump could never have won.
In the years I worked with Ailes he was a great mentor, deeply patriotic, committed to Fox News ands really worried about America.
Ailes greatest contribution was the founding and development of Fox News. He understood that Fair and Balanced was the key to success.
Ailes played a key role in electing President George H W Bush in 1988. He understood the American people and he knew how to reach therm.
Roger Ailes was a genius at politics and the news media. His advice to Presidents Nixon and Reagan was historic and helped elect both.
Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down

Castro in 1959 to NYT reporter"W/o your help, and w/o help of the NYT, the Revolution in Cuba wld never have been" https://t.co/bWpZMtbQ4L
Under no circumstance should President Obama or VP Biden or Secstate Kerry go to Cuba for Castro's funeral. He was a tyrant.
So the NYTimes bears some responsibility for 57 years of dictatorship in cuba
Castro gave NYTimes a medal "Without your help, and without the help of the New York Times, the Revolution in Cuba would never have been."
Build a list of those praising Castro and you will have a list of leftists who reject reality for an ideological fantasy
Castro's policies impoverished the Cuban people.look at the cars in pictures.a dictatorship that drove out hundreds of thousands of Cubans
The outpouring of praise for Fidel Castro is tragic.he was a relentless dictator who imprisoned thousands, killed and tortured many Cubans.

Clinton is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one very big thing: We need change.
When you watch the debate tomorrow night remember Isaiah Berlin's " the hedgehog and the fox." Next tweet will explain

The killings in Chicago are not inevitable. Lots of American lives could be saved.But liberals have to plave saving lives ahead of ideology.
Mayor Giuliani and Chief Bratton developed a comprehensive policing approach that reduced murders by over 80% over next decade.
Want to dramatically reduce murders in Chicago?start by reading Giuliani's Leadership and Bratton's turnaround. These two books work.
Chicago's 90 murders in August, most in 20 years, were more than New York and Los Angeles combined.When will Democrats recognize the crisis.

Just as there were Wallace and Thurmond deserters from Truman there are establishment deserters fleeing Trump. Most Americans don't care.
Truman is the modern outsider most like Trump.blunt, plain spoken, aggressive, energetic and willing to fight the establishment.
Truman faced two third parties, one on segregationist front, one on pro Communist left. Elites KNEW Truman would lose. He fought back.
Republicans who are sure Trump can't win should read history of Truman's 1948 campaign. Pollsters were off by 9 to 19 percent.
We deserve to know why DOJ declined FBI request to investigate @ClintonFdn corruption. https://t.co/OV9JtRJCc8 https://t.co/E0vdevOcp1
