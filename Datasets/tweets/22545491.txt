We should always seek out steps that can prevent or minimize the impact of disasters, but while we have those discussions we must always provide aid to those in need.
I went to Paradise and saw firsthand the devastating toll it had on the people in that community. We owe it to those Americans, and any other communities affected by disasters, to stand beside them and offer federal assistance.

Now, Democrats are opposing border security measures they have previously supported without offering any solutions of their own. We need to stop playing politics and get to the negotiating table in order to focus on common sense solutions to this problem.
The humanitarian crisis at our southern border is the most glaring evidence of America‚Äôs broken immigration system. The president is offering solutions, including physical barriers - which Democrats have supported in the recent past.
No one benefits when government agencies are shutdown. Democrats have supported funding for physical barriers at the border before. Their opposition to additional funding is more politics than policy. Americans deserve better.

Another day, another Democrat tax hike proposal. House Democrats are now proposing a significant tax increase on American job creators. Taxes hikes will harm workers the most as companies eliminate jobs and cut wages if forced to pay a higher tax bill. https://t.co/DZhZGXXxKi
Despite today‚Äôs positive jobs report that highlights the positive effects of the Republican tax cuts, Democrats in the House are already proposing massive tax hikes. I will stand my campaign pledge to oppose higher taxes and fight to protect the families I represent.
Earlier today, I reintroduced the FACT Act, H.R. 249, in order to protect animals and taxpayers from unnecessary animal tests funded by the federal government. You can read my full statement and get more information here: https://t.co/XJWgotnG9B
Less than 24 hours into the new Dem House majority their unhinged rhetoric has laid bare their main goal is impeachment. They don‚Äôt care about the Mueller investigation or the Constitution. Let's stop the politics and start debating policies to help Americans families.

Tonight, I opposed Speaker Pelosi's sham vote that fails to address our crisis at the southern border and fails to move us closer to ending the partial government shutdown. It‚Äôs time to stop playing politics and get to the negotiating table. https://t.co/MJGaUy5DtB
Last June, the Senate Appropriations Committee ‚Äì by a bipartisan majority vote ‚Äì approved $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2019 to construct approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas along our southern border.
Last March, Speaker Pelosi and 110 of her Democratic colleagues in the House voted to approve $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2018 for over 90 miles of physical barrier construction along our southern border.
In October 2006, Congress approved the Secure Fence Act.  It passed the House 283-138 and later the Senate by 80-19.  Senators voting in favor included Sens. Obama, Biden, Boxer, Feinstein, Clinton, and Schumer.
In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208), which expressly authorized the construction and improvement of fencing and other barriers along the Southwest border.
Constructing a physical barrier on our southern border has historically received bipartisan support. So why are Democrats now digging their heels in over a difference of $3.4 billion, which represents 0.26% of our discretionary budget, for something they‚Äôve supported in the past?
It‚Äôs an honor and a privilege to be sworn into the 116th Congress. I pledge to defend the Constitution while fighting for policies that benefit our district, state and nation.

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the President‚Äôs Constitutional authority to make national security judgments in the realm of immigration. The decision is a win for the Constitution and for national security.
If foreign governments can‚Äôt provide us adequate security information on individuals wishing to come to our country, we must have the ability to impose narrow, country-based pauses until more strenuous vetting procedures are in place.
I agree with the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision that the travel ban is not about religion, it‚Äôs about ensuring we can properly vet people coming to our country.

The bill passed today includes the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to give the Forest Service the budgetary certainty it has been lacking for far too long. We can now devote more resources to wildfire prevention efforts and start to curb the rise in catastrophic wildfires.
The bill passed today includes $22.9 million for the Earthquake Early Warning system, an increase of $12.7 million. I will continue to be a champion for this life-saving technology that can have a significant impact when big earthquakes strike.

Republicans must work together to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a more competitive, patient-focused health care policy.

I do not believe many inland Empire residents will be comforted or reassured after hearing this uninspiring address.
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed that the President gave no indication tonight that he‚Äôs going to change that failing strategy.
The terror attack in San Bernardino is the latest and most disturbing sign that President Obama's strategy is failing.
We must restate our commitment and strengthen our resolve to defeat violent Islamic extremists around the world.
The reports and overwhelming evidence make it clear to me that the attack in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism. https://t.co/EdQ9GSA3GQ
We will not and cannot let cowards with evil intentions terrorize our communities and our country.
The heroism and bravery of our first responders, in the face of unimaginable evil, is what rest restores our faith in humanity.

I know that our region will come together &amp; provide the families of the victims with the support &amp; compassion they need in this trying time.
It‚Äôs absolutely heartbreaking to see this senseless violence in San Bernardino. Praying for the victims and their families.

I agree with Sen. Feinstein: ‚ÄúISIL is not contained. ISIL is expanding.‚Äù It‚Äôs time for a strategy that brings ISIL to its demise.
We need to halt the Syrian refugee resettlement process until we have confidence in our ability to properly screen them.
