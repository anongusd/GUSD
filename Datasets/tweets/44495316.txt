@guybranum Agreed. I do believe the generation we are raising, Gen Z, is further left and more inclusive than even Millennials, though. I work at a university so I'm seeing a lot of it, plus I have two Zs myself. Time will tell, I guess.

Home sick, watching Whitaker hearing and from what I can tell, he's a real obnoxious jerk. But that's what a certain segment of the American electorate seems to like, so.
According to CNN, the CNN reporter noticed unusual activity around the grand jury Thursday, made an educated guess, convinced his boss to let him go down and stake out Stone's house. Is that right @brianstelter?

@themillerz We can't pick him up every other day!
@themillerz Yeah, so the secretary at BASD explained to me. It's an alto sax, he can put it on his lap.
@ThatNeilGuy I mean, if this is policy, you would think he would have been informed of this sometime in the past six years.
The email said it is too large of an instrument (It's an alto).
My kid has carried his saxophone on the school bus for *six* years. Today was the first time he ever accidentally left it on the bus. He has now been told he is not allowed to bring the instrument on the bus and has to be driven to school on days when he carries it.

@GothamNoirNYC Youre absolutely right. And I do like stuff like Nat King Cole and Ronnie Spector. It was the confusion I saw in them when I said I didn't grow up with it. Reminded me of a high school friend who once looked at me and said, "But Santa Claus is a universal figure!"

They seemed confused. "But I'm Jewish so I didn't grow up celebrating Christmas," I explained. "I don't have childhood associations with Christmas music and Santa Claus and stuff."		I think I blew their minds. I forget how homogeneous some people's lives are.
Barre instructor did a Christmas list today and I said "Oh boy, let's see if I make it through." And I said "I'm not really into Christmas music."		And someone said "Do you celebrate Christmas?" And I said "Well, I do now since my husband is Catholic."

@byJenAMiller Secondly, I was always emotionally vulnerable during a race and even just a song could make me cry. And then I would lose my breath and have to walk until I could compose myself. Maybe that's just me and other people wouldn't be affected by being proposed to mid-race
@byJenAMiller My issue with race proposals is twofold. First and foremost is taking away from this significant acheivement on the part of the woman running. I guess if she expressed a desire for this type of proposal that's ok, but it rubs me the wrong way.

@DavidLJarman I mean, the Lehigh Valley's cities are now more than 25% Latino. Of course, this also has led to backlash, which we saw in the more rural parts of our counties (esp. Norco and Berks) in 2016.
@DavidLJarman I think it overperformed its demos because of the continued strength of unions in the state into the 2000s. The death of good union jobs combined w/Great Recession broke white non-college educated folks away from Dems. But as you know we're getting more diverse here, too.

@JeremyLittau It's fascinating how "climate change" is used by people instead if global warming now but he came up with it to be less scary do people would tune it out.		Ugh. I just can't help thinking that none of any of this would have happened if Gore hadn't been robbed in 2000.

@HBK112 Here's how we explain high deductible health plans at Lehigh: https://t.co/F1ehN9rvCP
@HBK112 With a PPO you're paying a higher premium but more us covered up front. With a high deductible health plan you pay lower premiums but then you're on the hook for the costs of care until you reach that higher deductible.
@HBK112 HSA means health savings account. High deductible plans offer the HSA, theory being you put aside the money you save from low premiums and then you spend it when you need it, instead up paying upfront in the form of high premiums. It's weird to have two HDHP plans. No HMO or PPO?
