@gaywonk It was a debate. And it was respectful. Don‚Äôt try to represent to your 68k followers that it was anything but. Do the legal ballots deserve to be counted in a proper way? Or should the illegal ballots be mixed in and counted? You are so wrong on this...

@JMac_1776 Jake, it‚Äôs not a tale. It‚Äôs true. And still no word from your fearless leader. Even tho he lost by 35 points after spending hundreds of thousands of his own money. Guess who won? Oh, that‚Äôs right. Gaetz. The one he lied about and attacked relentlessly. Give it up bud. You lost.

@JMac_1776 @KyleKashuv @mattgaetz Personally diasagree that he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about or doing, considering he just organized the largest gathering of conservative highschoolers ever for a conference.
