Hello -- Pointing to one person of a certain race as proof that another individual couldn't possibly be racist against that race/have said or done racist things... truly doesn't work.
Meadows says he's had so many conversations with Trump, and he's never said anything racist.
And remember, this was one of Cohen's earliest statements about the Stormy Daniels payment: "neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford."
The multiple ways in which Cohen claims he and the *CFO of the Trump Organization* discussed ways to use Trump's business to cover up an alleged affair is significant.
Another option discussed: Did anyone want to become a member of a Trump golf club and the payment could be found that way? (Again, for an alleged HUSH PAYMENT)
Cohen says they discussed other options, including finding someone who wanted to host a party at a Trump club, and the payment for that could be used, for example.
This answer is interesting. Cohen delves into his discussions with Weisselberg about how to fund hush payment. Says he asked Weisselberg if he could pay since Cohen didn't want to use his money. Weisselberg said no.
Asked if he has a book deal, Cohen says: "I have no book deal right now... I have been contacted by many, including for television, movie..."

Feb 27, 2019: Michael Cohen says he would not accept a pardon from Donald Trump.

Judge has ordered that Roger Stone may not speak publicly about the investigation going forward — “period.” No press interviews, blog posts, social media, statements. And no one can speak on his behalf, either.
Judge Jackson continues: "Roger Stone fully understands the power of words and the power of symbols. There's nothing ambiguous about crosshairs… In the world of social media, there's no such thing as a take-back.”
Judge also says she does not find his testimony credible. And on the Instagram post with the image of her next to crosshairs, she says the image he chose "had a more sinister message"

@RepJoeKennedy @RepKatiePorter @wutrain Warren’s taken dozens of Qs from voters already this year – on everything from net metering to net neutrality to the PR debt crisis. These are genuinely complicated issues to explain, and her former students say she's doing exactly what she used to do in the classroom.
@RepJoeKennedy @RepKatiePorter @wutrain Things we’ve heard Warren say on the trail: 	- “I’m going to get wonky”	- “I’m just going to nerd out”	- “Let’s really wonk out”	- (My personal favorite) “Can I get an amen from an electrician?” 	https://t.co/rD4LsvBOYo

My twitter timeline rn: Klobuchar and wash cloths
Klobuchar addresses her questioning of Kavanaugh, saying her father's struggle with alcoholism has taken him to the "lowest valleys." He still goes to AA at age 90, she says.
On the recent headlines about her treatment of staff, Klobuchar says in part: "Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes. Have I pushed people too hard? Yes."
And then on Green New Deal, she says this too, is aspirational. But there are things to focus on right away -- like get the US back into the climate deal (she says she would do that on Day One as president)
On Medicare for All, she says that can come in the future, but she wants something that can work now: protect the ACA; universal health care; public option
Within first 12 minutes of CNN townhall, you can see why Klobuchar would appeal to Democrats wary of far left candidates (or at the very least wary that they can beat Trump)
What Warren said in Vegas this weekend: “I still remember vividly the day the babysitter quit and what it was like to scramble to find somebody else. And it’s just gotten harder since then."
And remember that Warren got married at 19 and soon after had two kids. She believes that more than once, her career almost went off track because of child care challenges
Full story, with more to come, here: https://t.co/kopfXrPBMG
This is a clear indication that Warren's proposed tax proposal is clearly a major component of Warren’s overall platform -- her advisers say other proposals paid for by wealth tax revenue are expected
Warren's proposal would create a federal program that establishes a network of public and family-run centers. The care would be free for families with incomes below 200% of the poverty level – about $51,500 for a family of four.
NEW: Details of Elizabeth Warren's universal child care policy being released tomorrow -- it would guarantee child care from birth until the time children enter school, and be paid for by Warren's proposed "wealth tax."
Interesting that Warren will be joined on stage by her grandkids the day before she's expected to roll out major child care plan

Warren statement on Roger Lau: “Roger and I have been together since my first days as a candidate for office, and it's always been a fight from the heart. It's what binds us together. Roger believes in building a grassroots operation, and that's exactly what we'll do.”
Warren's choice of Roger Lau is historic -- Lau appears to be the first Asian-American campaign manager for a major American presidential candidate. This is particularly notable in an election that already features an unprecedented diverse field of candidates.
Notable that both Lau and Geldon are continuing their 2018 Warren Senate re-election roles -- campaign manager and chief of staff, respectively.
Dan Geldon, Warren’s longtime aide and former Senate chief of staff, will serve as chief of staff on the presidential campaign.

@jmestepa @CNNPolitics Great news for us! welcome!!
Warren was introduced by Rep. Deb Haaland, Native American congresswoman from New Mexico. According to remarks shared by Warren campaign, Haaland said Warren is "a great friend to Indian Country and to working families."
We are also told that at this luncheon, Warren did not deviate from her prepared remarks, and did not make any mention of her own claims to Native American ancestry or the DNA test controversy.
In introducing Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, Warren laid out areas where Congress needs to take action, including:	- missing and murdered indigenous women and girls	- rising suicide rates among Native people	- resources like housing, health care and addiction
Warren campaign has shared with CNN the senator's prepared remarks at the luncheon (reporters who cover Warren were not given heads-up that she would be attending the luncheon)
The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) tells CNN that Warren did not attend their conference today. The luncheon Warren attended "was held at the same location as the conference" but that "it was not an NCAI event," the spox said.
Elizabeth Warren spox Kristen Orthman confirms that the senator appeared at a National Indian Women's "Supporting Each Other" luncheon today. Warren introduced Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe of Massachusetts.

Warren's view on how and whether to take on Trump in 2020: "If all we do is move back and say, 'Not Trump,' than we’re not going to make the changes this country really needs."
Warren responds: "Because some people had asked me, are you going to respond to this, or are you going to respond to that, and the answer, no."
Asked Warren if you don't want to be engaging in every Trump tweet, attack, everyday, what prompted you to make comment this morning Trump being in jail this morning?
Warren says there is no doubt that Trump is a racist. But she adds: "the question now is, are we going to follow him on every single racist insult and taunt that he tweets, or are we going to take back this conversation?"
Warren has used the word "bigotry" today and yesterday -- that there's no place for it in the WH. Asked about other Dems straight out calling Trump a racist and if she would say that, Warren responds: "Oh, I’ve already said that."
Should Trump be impeached? Warren says the Mueller investigation needs to come out first.
So you think Trump will be in jail? Warren reiterates investigations are serious, and that part of her point was that "the problems we're facing in this country are not just Donald Trump. He's a symptom of what's wrong."
In a gaggle after Iowa City event, Warren is asked about her earlier comments about Trump not being a "free" person by 2020 Election Day: "Come on, how many investigations are there now, into him? It's no longer just the Mueller investigation... These are serious investigations."
@creynoldsnc But even in betrayal she looks at you with love look at that face
“It’s gonna be hard,” Warren says in closing about 2020, but says that this election is the chance for the country to dream big, fight, and win.
Warren: "I believe in science. Climate. change. is. real. It is caused by human activity and we are running out of time. Green New Deal. We’re ready."
@nickconfessore OK I am very upset to see this in my twitter feed
Warren always gesticulates a lot, paces a lot, punches the air a lot, but she seems extra energized at this Iowa City event. Also hearing some of the most enthusiastic applauses and cheers from the crowd I've heard in a while
Klobuchar: "Yes, I can't be tough. And yes, I can push people..." https://t.co/Jpnmt84JTT
A frequent line from Warren is that when she talks about changing the system, she's not talking about a "nibble" here or there: "Think big. structural. change."
As always, this is a big Warren applause line here in Iowa City: "End lobbying as we know it."
Warren, who officially announced her campaign yesterday, tells Iowans here that it makes her heart sing that someone of her upbringing could be a presidential candidate.

Warren: "Donald Trump is not the only problem we've got... Donald Trump is the symptom of a badly broken system. So, our job as we start rolling into the next election is not just to respond on a daily basis. It's to talk about what we understand is broken in this country."

Warren also gets a standing ovation here when she says every candidate should make tax returns public.
A strong applause line here in Iowa: "The kind of change we need to make is big, structural change. The kind that puts power back in the hands of people."
Clear that she took the stage here in Iowa this morning having made decision to attack Trump right off the top.
Warren has not been directly taking Trump on, by name. since announcing her exploratory campaign since New Year's Eve. Over the last month, she's barely said his name on the stump -- only doing it when a voter asks her a Q explicitly about him
Warren also says... Trump may be in jail by 2020: "By the time we get ot 2020, Donald Trump may not even be President. In fact, he may not even be a free person."
Warren continues: "Are we going to let him use those to divide us?"
Warren says there's a crucial question right now about "what Donald Trump does every day. There’s a racist tweet, a hateful tweet. Something really dark and ugly. And what are we, as candidates, as actistsis, the press, going to do about it?"
Whoa. Warren starts her first full day of campaigning by going after Donald Trump, by name. right at the top.

@krossny1 No idea who you’re directing this to but if it was at me, this was quite literally the opposite of my point. I’m saying there should never be any kind of burden on a survivor — including to confront their attacker.
In a perfect world, survivors would have the courage to confront the attacker, if that’s what they wanted to do.		Also in a perfect world, people would not be sexually assaulted to begin with.

As she has been doing since announcing her exploratory campaign, Warren talks about white vs. black economic disparity, including in home ownership. "Race matters," she says, "and we need to say so."
When Warren says "the middle class squeeze is real and millions of families can barely breathe -- it's not right," the crowd starts to chant: "It's not right! It's not right!"
Reaction after Warren said the words: “I am a candidate for President is the United States of America.” https://t.co/FrSCLZ45r1
Elizabeth Warren has officially announced she is running for president: "I stand here today to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America."
Warren now pivots to today, saying the system is still broken. "The man in the White House is not the cause of what’s broken, he’s just the latest – and most extreme – symptom of what’s gone wrong in America."
Warren: "The story of Lawrence is a story about how real change happens in America. It’s a story about power – our power – when we fight together."
“Nevertheless... they persisted.” https://t.co/NpcfkBUeIn

Markey: "For six years, she has been fighting in the trenches for what is right for the people of Massachusetts and entire country."

On stage now is Sen. Ed Markey: "I'm honored and I'm humbled to be here today with my dear friend and my phenomenal partner in the Senate, Elizabeth Warren."
Next up is Massachusetts Rep. Lori Trahan: "It is my honor to be here today to support Elizabeth because she has fought for working class families her entire career."

RT @ryanobles: NEW: @LGJustinFairfax denies second allegation.. and calls for full investigation into her claims. He also makes it clear:…
The accusers are also rarely motivated by money or fame (and in fact, the instant fame is one of the hardest parts of choosing to go forward.)
They also say they’re motivated more than anything else by the desire for others – the public – to understand that these men were capable in behaving in XX way, because they believe it says so much about the men's character.
They often say they were triggered by watching their attacker rise in their careers in public office/service. No matter what titles these men hold, to the women, the men will forever be men who inflicted on them the worst kind of pain.
They also painfully fret over the decision to go public. It’s one thing to confront an accuser who is more or less anonymous, and entirely another to confront someone whose lives unfold in public. Becoming their accuser instantly makes you a public person.
There are remarkable similarities and parallels in the stories of women who come out with public allegations of sexual assault against powerful men.
Sources could not confirm whether Bailey 🐶 would be there Saturday. Warren’s husband Bruce, her children and some grandchildren are expected to be there. I can also confirm it will be extremely cold.
Rep. Kennedy will endorse Warren at her campiagn launch rally on Saturday, as Globe first reported. Sen. Markey, Rep. Trahan, Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera and Boston City Councilwoman Michelle Wu will be among others to attend.

Warren: "This is about my family, my brothers, and it is about an apology from the heart."
Warren says she has not spoken with Cherokees' Principal Chief Bill John Baker again since WaPo story, but restated her apology: "My apology is an apology for not having been more sensitive about tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty."
Notably, Warren was asked twice if there might be other documents or forms like this out there, and she did not address that specific question.
(Warren would be referring to this Boston Globe investigation which concluded Warren's claim to Native American ancestry was "never considered by the Harvard Law faculty... or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools.") https://t.co/SX8yae6pFV
On criticism that she described herself as Native American to boost her career, Warren responds: "That is a claim that has been fully investigated and it has now been shown completely that nothing about my background ever had anything to do with any job I got in any place."
From my colleagues on the Hill -- Elizabeth Warren says she listed herself as American Indian on the Texas bar registration because she grew up in Oklahoma around "family stories" about her ancestry. "But that said, there really is an important distinction of tribal citizenship."

Holy moly!! Aforementioned man remembers that there *is* a white male politician he likes a lot! The senator from Montana — Jon Tester! He likes him a lot.
Aforementioned man: “Isn’t it interesting that not one white man has jumped into the race yet?”	...	Oh boy. The table goes around on Joe Biden: 	“Oh he shouldn’t.”	“He doesn’t want to.”	“He missed his time.”
If Trump doesn’t run though, which Republican would run? Nikki Haley, because she is a good “moderate Republican.”	...	“We do not need any more white men in politics,” says man (who is white).
But, the question is, who then would Kamala pick as her VP? “Elizabeth Warren. That’s what I would do.”	... 	“This is far-fetched, but I’m not 100% sure Donald Trump will run for re-election.”
“I am torn because I do not like the two-party system.”	...	“But who can beat Donald Trump? That is the question.”	...	One man says of the people in the field, she would bet on Kamala. Who? “The girl from California.”

I asked Warren about the woman in the audience who asked her about Violence Against Women Act — does she have a message for women who’ve accused the President of sexual misconduct?		Warren: “We have to take these charges seriously.”
Another reporter asked why she has not been directly addressing Trump. Warren said it is important to talk about an “affirmative vision.”
Asked about other Dems starting to get in the race, Warren says “I think it’s exiting for that Democrats have so many ideas.”
Warren gaggled with reporters in Manchester — clear she’s not addressing other (potential) Dem candidates directly. 		Asked how she’ll get support from those who voted for Bernie, she says: “I’m not a professional politician” (a like we heard a bunch in Iowa last weekend)
Warren closing message in NH: “This is going to be grassroots all the way for me... The way we make democracy work once again... is that we build a grassroots movement, person to person.”
Woman says this issue is not just about justice for women, but also about mental health. 		Warren to the woman: “You have demonstrated persistence. And you are strong.”
6th Q is from a woman who says she had the misfortune of dating the wrong guy in the 90s. “We need the Violence Against Women Act back... The stalker has been trying to find me again.” https://t.co/pIWm2Wui04
5th Q is about energy and Warren is pretty jazzed to start discussing “net metering.” 🙃		As she gets going, Warren gestures to one audience member: “Can I get an amen from an electrician on that?”
Biggest applause line of the Q&amp;A so far — Warren: “I believe in science.” 		“Climate change is real. And we have a moral and economic responsibility to make changes in this country starting right now.”
Fourth Q is about the EPA and how to strengthen environmental protections. Reminder that at Warren events, questioners are picked via lottery. Qs show range of policy issues people want to discuss.
Warren says African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested for marijuana. Says we should just legalize marijuana (to audience applause)
Third Q is from a man who grew up in the South Bronx and is of Dominican descent. Says he appreciates what Warren has said about “systemic reasons” that people of color struggle. His Q is about mass incarceration. (Audience cheers)
Second Q: “What do you see as some practical and active steps... to close the education gap?”		Warren is thrilled. “Aaaaah, thank you,” she says. “You speak to the heart of a teacher.”
Warren now taking questions in NH. First Q is from a man who is critical of superdelegates system. Warren tells him they’re already gone and that she’s long supported getting rid of them
Warren says her father was a janitor and she became a teacher, professor and US senator: “I am grateful to America.”
Warren: “We need to make systemic change in this country. Systemic change. Real change.”
Warren: “Why has the path gotten so rocky for so many people who worked just as hard as my momma worked?... The answer is the rules — the rules that are written in far-off Washington.”
In NH, Warren starts as she did in Iowa — describing her childhood in Oklahoma and how “my big chance was a commuter college that cost $50 per semester...” https://t.co/iWBkKiJ1uq

“I have three older brothers...” Warren begins, saying she talks to all three even though they don’t all share her political views.
Second question is about how to “confront someone like Donald Trump.”
First question here comes from this little girl: “What can we do about global warming?” https://t.co/pL2bi5bjcN
What was most surprising about the 2018 midterms? Warren: “It was the women.” 		“Women. Friends of women, who said: I’m going to make my voice heard.”
Also in the audience is Christie Vilsack.
The women onstage with Warren: 		Amber Gustafson, State Senate Candidate	Kristen Sunde, State Rep-Elect	Claire Celsi, State Sen-Elect	Jennifer Konfrst, State Rep-Elect	Heather Matson, State Rep-Elect	Karin Derry, State Rep-Elect	Deidre Dejear, Iowa SOS candidate
Warren says it was clear many people had written her off even before she decided to run for Senate, because previously a woman had run unsuccessfully. 		Says the mindset was: “We tried that and it didn’t work... You can imagine how that made me feel: I’m in.”
Warren recalls Harry Reid calling her to ask her to come to Washington.	“Hi, I’m Harry Reid.”	“I said: Who?”

@maggieNYT So happy we and our nuggets were not arrested
This short exchange captures a line that not only Warren, but all 2020 Dem candidates will have to walk carefully: some voters want Warren/Dems to confront and take on Trump; others don’t want them to engage Trump on his terms
Warren ends her first event of the day in Iowa by saying she wants to talk about Medicaid, because she doesn't believe Democrats have done a good job of explaining it.
When Warren says she doesn't have the power to stop Trump from hurling racial insults, audience members yells out: "Yes you can!"
Warren adds that her decision was to "put it all out there," and that when it comes to the President, "I can’t stop Donald Trump from what he’s going to do. I can’t stop him from hurling racial insults."
Warren: "I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship and I respect that difference."
First Q in Sioux City for Elizabeth Warren from audience: "Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully?"
Her 2020 stump speech is shaping up to be: biographical intro of childhood in Oklahoma; commuter college opening up doors for her; those opportunities not being available to many other Americans; Washington not working for the people but rather big corporate interests.
Notable that before saying anything else, including how her family overcame economic hardships, Warren begins with: “This is a dangerous time for our country.”

@CarolynSungCNN - Among the undecideds, they are curious about: Bernie Sanders (the name most frequently mentioned); Joe Biden; Kamala Harris; Sherrod Brown
@CarolynSungCNN - DNA test/Native American issue: 2 were not familiar with it; 3 said it’s not relevant/who cares/it’s overblown (1 person wasn’t asked)
@CarolynSungCNN - Issues important to these six people: Wall Street and financial regulations by far the top issue; others also mentioned Medicare, labor/workers’ rights and economic opportunity for middle class.
Before Warren's event in Council Bluffs, Iowa, @CarolynSungCNN and I spoke with six voters. The extremely unofficial survey:		- 4 undecided. 1 “completely” for Warren. 1 leaning Warren.
Warren responds by saying: "I feel the role of government here is to back out," drawing cheers from audience.
Interesting. Warren is getting a question from a former U of Texas student of hers. She is supporting Warren, but says she's worried about one thing: "I feel, if you support abortion, your entire message is lost."
Warren's response begins with: "I’m not a career politician... All I know is what pulls me into the fight… I got a chance as a kid. That chance is because taxpayers invested in public schools. That’s how I got my chance."
Warren is now taking questions from the audience. First question from a student journalists is about the "soul of the Democratic Party." (!)
(Here are the people outside of Warren event trying to listen in, via @CarolynSungCNN) https://t.co/h0MtbUVeyQ
Big applause line when Warren says this is an America that works for people at the top, but not those at the bottom. "This is the moment we need to make big, structural change in this country."
Mid-speech, as Warren gets going about home ownership for middle class, her mic goes out. Some people trying to hear from outside room now can't hear.

Is Trump telling the truth about Russia?		Cohen: “No.”
Cohen’s message to Trump: “Lay off Twitter. Run the country the way we all thought that you would.”
Cohen to @GStephanopoulos: “The gentleman that is sitting now in the Oval Office... is not the Donald Trump that I remember from Trump Tower.”  Says the pressure of the presidency is more than Trump expected.
Cohen asked why people should believe he’s telling the truth now. He says about special counsel Robert Mueller’s office: “There’s a substantial amount of information that they possess that corroborates the fact that I’m telling the truth.”
”I gave loyalty to someone,” Cohen says, who does not deserve loyalty. He says he is angry at himself for having been blindly loyal. “I’m done being loyal to President Trump.”
“He directed me to make the payments,” Cohen says for the first time in a media interview.
Cohen about Trump: “He knows the truth. I know the truth. Others know the truth.” Says it is “sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.”
Michael Cohen on GMA: “I have my freedom back.”
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/1cISaodwoV
I never told him to do anything wrong is of course not the same as: I never told him to do anything.
Especially telling: Trump says he “never directed him (Cohen) to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own.”
“They put that on there to embarrass me,” Trump says about the campaign finance violations that Cohen pleaded guilty to.
Trump also says on Fox News that the hush payments to women were “not criminal and shouldn’t have been there.” — as in, they shouldn’t have been included in Cohen’s charges.
Trump makes the “this is not fair” argument: “Nobody except for me would be looked at like this. Nobody. What about Congress, where they have a slush fund? And millions and millions of dollars is paid out each year.”
Revealing comments from Trump on Michael Cohen/hush payments in Fox News interview: 		"I don’t think we made a payment to that tabloid.”

SDNY memo suggests Cohen is delusional or at least in denial about the seriousness of his crimes: "Now he seeks extraordinary leniency – a sentence of no jail time – based principally on his rose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes."
SDNY says "Cohen deceived the voting public" by hiding these women's stories. Their message is clear: you don't get to do this, then plead guilty, then expect to be a hero.
Read this language: "While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows."
SDNY goes to some lengths to show disapproval re: Michael Cohen's attempts to silence women who had stories of alleged extramarital affairs with Trump
You can expect this line to resonate with Cohen. He had people telling him that he could become exactly that --  a hero -- by turning his back on Trump and telling the truth. https://t.co/rkpdh3O2dx
This line from SDNY on Michael Cohen: "After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen’s decision to plead guilty - rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes- does not make him a hero."
SDNY sentencing memo says it's requesting "a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable Guidelines range" for Michael Cohen.
Michael Cohen is correcting the amount he told a judge he paid in taxes, according to a short new filing his lawyer made. Cohen says he paid $1.9M in federal &amp; NY state taxes over five years. Previously, he had said he had paid $6M. via @kpolantz

Mareli Miniutti’s lawyer tells me: "Mareli Miniutti stands by the accuracy of her statements to the LAPD. The suggestions contained in Mr. Avenatti’s counsel’s letter to the LAPD are vindictive, contrary to the evidence, and unworthy of further reply.”
Avenatti’s attorneys say there are witnesses, as well as surveillance video in the halls, elevator and entrance to the building, that bolster Avenatti’s statements. https://t.co/Iep8aj82lg
I also spoke with Mareli Miniutti’s husband, Michael Miniutti. He told me: "In Mareli's defense, she was never aggressive. She never put me in an aggressive state of mind or anything like that. She’s a very calm, well-mannered, respectful individual. Very polite. Classy woman."
Avenatti’s attorneys: "Ms. Miniutti and Mr. Avenatti had an argument… during which Ms. Miniutti behaved in a volatile, agitated and irrational manner. However, Mr. Avenatti did not inflict any corporal injury or cause any traumatic condition upon Ms. Miniutti."
Miniutti also said there was another occasion -- in February of this year -- when Avenatti "acted in a physically violent manner" toward her. He "had been drinking," she said, "and became angry at me."
As the altercation worsened, Miniutti alleged, Avenatti "began forcefully hitting me in the face with pillows from the bed," and then grabbed her wrist and, later, her arm.		"He dragged me on the floor of the apartment towards and out of the door into the public hallway."
In a declaration filed as part of the request for a restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court, Miniutti described an altercation last week in which she said she and Avenatti started fighting about money.
Aspiring actress Mareli Miniutti was granted a restraining order against Michael Avenatti, and accused him of physical and verbal violence including hitting her face with pillows, calling her an "ungrateful bitch" and dragging her across the floor. https://t.co/Iep8aj82lg

Of note: Meadows has until May 15, 2020, to pay back the $40k to Treasury. This ethics case won’t be closed until he makes that payment.
"While Members are free to pursue romantic and intimate relationships outside of the House, there is an inherent power imbalance when Members romantically pursue individuals who are required to interact with Members as part of their professional responsibilities."
“The Committee found that Representative Kihuen made persistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities."
A second report from House Ethics also released today on Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen (who is not running for reelection) accused by multiple women of unwanted physical and verbal advances.
Key line from House Ethics report on Rep. Meadows: "Just as between Members and their staff, a power imbalance exists between senior staff and junior staff in congressional offices."
"There is no place in any congressional office for looking up skirts, or down shirts; staring at a woman’s chest; unwanted touching; or making sexual comments, even if subtle or in jest."
House Ethics says its report serves as “reproval” of Meadows’ conduct, and it is requiring the congressman to reimburse the Treasury Department for “overpayment” made to West of around $40,000.
House Ethics says Meadows failed to take prompt action in part by “demoting” West to a senior adviser role, then continuing to pay him even though there was “little evidence of official work” that he was doing.
House Ethics investigated allegations of sexual harassment involving Meadows' former chief of staff, Kenny West. According to its review, West’s behavior toward female staff was “inappropriate in every sense of the word,” committee said.
Some sexual harassment news from the Hill today: House Ethics Committee says Rep. Mark Meadows’ showed “failure to take prompt and decisive action to deal with the alleged sexual harassment in his congressional office."

Cohen would not answer question about his recent meeting with investigators.
These were Cohen's first on-cam comments in a very long time. Seems clear that he has this message about Trump, and is eager to be heard.
Cohen: "Listen, here's my recommendation. Grab your family, grab your friends, grab your neighbors, and get to the poll, because if not, you are going to have another two or another six years of this craziness. So, make sure you vote. All right?"

In addition to sharing with the FBI what Ford told him this summer, Gensheimer says he would have been a character witness to the FBI, had they requested his assistance.
Gensheimer says Ford first confided in him in July. While she did not go into great detail at the time, Gensheimer said she told him that she had known Kavanaugh back in high school, and that “he had attempted to rape her.”
Gensheimer says he would have told the FBI: “I found her testimony to be consistent with the limited knowledge that I had of the situation. The character that she exhibited – the personality that you saw during the hearing was spot on. She was genuine. She wasn’t acting."
Just spoke with Jim Gensheimer, Christine Blasey Ford’s longtime friend that Ford’s legal team asked the FBI to interview. He confirms the FBI did not, in fact, ever reach out, but that he would have been happy to speak to them if they had.
Blasey Ford's lawyers: "The 'investigation' conducted over the past five days is a stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of justice."
In addition to Ford, the lawyers say the FBI did not interview: her husband, the polygraph examiner, friends who provided affidavits to the Judiciary Committee and other friends
Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers have sent a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, noting that the FBI did not interview witnesses "possessing information highly relevant to Dr. Ford’s allegations."

Mitchell is clearly being careful with her tone -- trying to keep things conversational and soft when possible. But it is impossible to ignore the very problematic optics Mitchell is creating &gt; https://t.co/y9Dm0XbqdR
RT @ShaneGoldmacher: If Trump is watching Fox, these anchor comments are extremely significant https://t.co/LYfPtjdyH2
Mitchell has not explicitly said anything to state there's skepticism about Ford's fear of flying, which her friends have described. But the string of Qs about how Ford got to DC, about how she flies regularly -- plenty of people watching will read skepticism.
We still don't know a lot about Christine Blasey Ford. But one thing we've learned is that she has studied trauma as an adult. Incredible that she's being asked by Mitchell about her own trauma, and she's clearly applying what she's learned in her own research to try to explain.
Sen. Gillibrand, who has been watching Blasey Ford hearing from the audience, tells CNN during break: "I don’t know how they could hear her testimony... and not believe her – and still vote for Brett Kavanaugh. I just don’t know how they could do it.”
This visual: 11 male Republican senators watching as a female outside counsel they’ve chosen questions Christine Blasey Ford. https://t.co/hJmcAX9o4c
@maggieNYT Case in point: back on the D side in questioning, Sen. Leahy says to Blasey Ford: "There are millions of victims … who have bene inspired by your courage. Bravery is contagious."
Note the stylistic difference that is apparent already on R vs. D questioning of Blasey Ford. Rachel MItchell's questioning feels like a cross examination so far, of the specific events of the alleged assault.
Feinstein asks Blasey Ford how she can be sure that it was Kavanaugh who was covering her mouth during alleged assault. 		"The same way that I am sure I'm talking to you right now."		So not possible that it was a case of mistaken identity?		"Absolutely not."
I am reminded of what Blasey Ford's high school teacher told me -- that years after high school, she wanted to discuss with him research she was doing on veterans with PTSD. At that point in time this teacher did not know about her alleged assault. https://t.co/uE2H01oy6O
Blasey Ford says she has had anxiety, phobia and PTSD symptoms, as a result of the alleged assault from high school. Her home has a second front door for this reason, she says.
Stark reminder of the fact that no Republican senator on the committee will directly question Blasey Ford -- Sen. Grassley interrupts 5 minutes into Mitchell's questioning to move on to Sen. Feinstein
Rachel Mitchell, who is about to question Blasey Ford, begins by saying to her: "You were terrified. I just wanted to let you know that I am very sorry."
And it is not just her supporters or friends -- some Senate staffers, as well as senators, visibly emotional and wiping away tears.
As Blasey Ford emotionally describes the alleged assault, crying, you can also hear crying and see tears throughout the audience in the room.

She says Blasey Ford first confided in her in August about having been sexually assaulted in high school, without naming Kavanaugh. “She did say this has affected me my entire life.”
DeVarney, who first spoke to the NYTimes, now tells CNN that Blasey Ford told in August that when she and her husband were remodeling their home, “she insisted that every room had to have an exit door to the outside.”
Kate DeVarney, a longtime friend of Christine Blasey Ford’s, is the second person to tell me Blasey Ford struggled to be in spaces without escape routes. Blasey Ford doesn’t like to fly, DeVarney said, bc an airplane is “the ultimate closed space where you cannot get away.”
3. Blasey Ford is in hiding and her family is getting threats: “She is currently unable to go home, and is receiving ongoing threats to her and her family's safety.”
2. Monday is likely too soon: “The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.”

Many people do not report in any official way (to authorities, employers, teachers, etc.) -- or even share privately to friends or family -- at the time of experiencing sexual harassment or assault.
This underscores an urgent need for there to be more conversations -- among women, men, young and old --  about the reality of sexual assault, and the deliberation of victims. It is plainly not true that if assault happened, others would have heard about it.
Kavanaugh's Georgetown Prep classmate James Molloy tells @AnnieGrayerCNN about the allegation: “I think this is unfounded. If it happened, we would have heard about it. So that’s why I’m skeptical.”
(This was also in response to Qs about whether Georgetown Prep supports accuser's decision to speak; whether school has any concerns about party environment she described; and whether the school supports Kavanaugh’s nomination.)
Asked whether the school has a more substantive comment -- now that Christine Blasey Ford has identified herself -- spokesman for Georgetown Prep tells CNN their comment will remain: "We have no knowledge regarding any accusation.”
Catherine Ferandin, whose parents have been in the house across from the Fords for decades and who has known Blasey Ford for years, says: “Women have to stand up and say their truth... I’m really proud of Christine."

To be clear, Melania Trump sponsoring her parents is a method many, many Americans use to bring their family to the US. It just happens to be a practice that Melania's husband -- the President -- wants to do away with.
Pressed on the fact that President Trump has criticized family-based migration (“chain migration”), Wildes responded: “I can’t comment on the president’s politics when it comes to my clients but I have stood up against the president’s immigration policies personally.”
He did say: “I believe strongly in the principles of family reunification which is a bedrock of immigration policy and law and has brought millions of people happily to our shores.”
Viktor and Amalija Knavs' immigration lawyer, Michael Wildes, is declining to comment to CNN about how the Knavs became US citizens.
Melania Trump sponsored her parents to obtain US green cards, a source familiar tells CNN. Today, her parents became US citizens.

Asked DiSabato how he can be so sure Jim Jordan knew. He said Jordan was in many conversations where the implication was clear. DiSabato would say, "Jim, can you believe this dude?” Jordan would say something like: "If he ever touches me, I'll kill him.” https://t.co/B5oew6YVhp
What’s also painful is that DiSabato says years ago, he simply didn’t have the vocabulary to precisely describe what he now understands to be sexual assault. Seeing gymnasts come out against Larry Nassar was clarifying, he says.
DiSanto said every time he went into see Dr. Strauss, there was groping. “I never saw Doc Strauss over a nine-year time frame… where he did not want to examine my testicles. He groped. Every time."
Some of the disturbing things DiSabato told me: "His (Jordan's) locker was located next to Doc Strauss. It was a common uncomfortable joke that Doc was a serial groper,Doc likes to hold your penis. Everyone knew it.” https://t.co/B5oew6YVhp

Morning news in 2018 --@GStephanopoulos: "No tweets yet from President Trump..."
@BFischerMartin Yeeees! 👯‍♀️
5. Something else Cohen wouldn’t answer: if Trump knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting before it happened. “I can’t comment under advice of my counsel…"
4. "But Cohen did not praise the president during our conversation -- and pointedly disagreed with Trump’s criticism of the federal investigations."
This was not Michael Cohen “hinting” or being subtle about whether he still has Trump’s back. This was Cohen signaling in everything he’s saying — and NOT saying -- that he’s done being the guy who’d take a bullet for Trump.
@GStephanopoulos &gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Michael Cohen has said all along that he acted on his own to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. In this GMA interview? “For now, I can’t comment further."
@GStephanopoulos 2. Cohen wouldn’t answer some specific questions, deferring to his lawyer. But the tone here is telling: “I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy. I am not a villain of this story…"
@GStephanopoulos Cohen didn’t repeat past statements about how he’d do anything to protect Trump and be loyal to him. “To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.”
Couple of noteworthy things from @GStephanopoulos interview with Michael Cohen &gt;&gt; 1. Cohen was *specifically* asked what he’d do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting Trump or his family. He said family was his “first priority."

I have a feeling that many others have also wondered at some point how and if they could be a little like him. Rest in peace, Anthony Bourdain.
I never had the opportunity to introduce myself to Bourdain. I was truly intimidated by him. What would I even say to a man who was an actual bad ass?
Bourdain was famous and in front of the camera, but seemed to want to capture places, people and food in only their most authentic forms. And no snobbery about what was the right or wrong way to live and eat.
The experience put him on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Bourdain said. And it was not the first time he said he failed to “get Sicily right.” How he summed up what went wrong: “I end up an outsider staring in.”
He quickly realizes it's all staged – frozen, dead fish being thrown into the water as Bourdain snorkeled. “Are they kidding me?…. One dead cuttlefish, deceased octopus, frozen sea urchin after another.”
An older episode of Anthony Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown” I’ve randomly thought about more than once is this one in Sicily. He goes on this comically terrible boat ride where the locals want to show him “fishing.” https://t.co/UIJToOUViB https://t.co/52JhFcIsBR

Another bizarre sentence to point out: “We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea…” Who is “we?” Who were they informed by? Makes Trump sound confused about how this summit was even arranged.
Trump also thanks Kim for recent US hostages. He calls it a…………….. “beautiful gesture.”
More strange language — again, from US president to authoritarian dictator of North Korea: “If you change your mind… please do not hesitate to call me or write."
Trump boasts to Kim about US nuclear weapons: “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used."

Also note disagreeing views on disclosing Cohen reimbursement: OGE says it was required to be reported; Trump says they disagree but doing so anyway "in the interest of transparency."
Interesting about this range -- Giuliani told @maggieNYT earlier this month that Trump paid Cohen for far more than the $130,000 Stormy payment -- somewhere between $460-470k. If that's true, this could be an underreporting.
Trump acknowledges he reimbursed Cohen in 2017 for an amount between $100,001-$250,000. Note language choice: "Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses."

And in fact, one person familiar with Cohen-Trump relationship says Trump “never talked to Cohen about substantive matters” that Cohen’s clients would have been interested in.
Pharmaceutical company Novartis realized after one meeting with Cohen that he couldn’t be that helpful on healthcare policy. They paid him the rest of the contract — $1.2 million — anyway.
Important to note: Cohen wasn’t alone in trying to land himself lucrative consulting deals. After Trump won, there was a scramble — particularly among big corporations — to try to figure Trump out and gain access to him.
Cohen’s sales pitch after the election: "I don't know who's been representing you, but you should fire them all. I'm the guy you should hire. I'm closest to the President. I'm his personal lawyer.” https://t.co/hLUiKN1cLb

Sarah Sanders isn’t going to say much about Michael Cohen being paid by companies in exchange for access to Trump. She has deferred Qs to Trump’s outside counsel multiple times.
A Novartis employee tells Stat News they didn’t cancel their contract with Cohen because they didn’t want to “anger” Trump. Novartis’ official statement says the contract “could only be terminated for cause” so they couldn’t.
Omg. "At first, it all sounded impressive, but toward the end of the meeting, everyone realized this was a probably a slippery slope to engage him."
"The employee could not explain why Novartis would have agreed to a deal with a lawyer with no background in health care and without deep Washington ties.”  https://t.co/VAt0y0IiOG
This new statement from Novartis about Michael Cohen is a doozy. It hired Cohen for a year ($100k/month) focusing on healthcare policy. They had one meeting w/ him and realized Cohen couldn’t help. They couldn’t terminate the contract, so they paid him anyway for the whole year. https://t.co/stTzthCvCy
Remember that Cohen’s attorneys recently said Cohen had only three legal clients: Trump, Elliott Broidy and Sean Hannity. https://t.co/QSW2IeOnLB
NEW: Korea Aerospace Industries tells CNN that it received “legal advice” from Essential Consultants. A spokesperson said KAI did *not* have direct contact with Michael Cohen.

And here is the statement from Novartis, the pharmaceutical company: “Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.”
To be clear: AT&amp;T is acknowledging that it paid Trump's personal lawyer to try to get insight into Trump. (In a year when insight into Trump is basically... what everyone would like to have)
AT&amp;T statement on Michael Cohen: "Essential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.”
My intrepid colleagues @KaraScannell and @ShimonPro on their scoop tonight about Mueller questioning a Russian oligarch about payments to Michael Cohen — read that here https://t.co/gKiX5xBIJV https://t.co/S3txr8zlah
Fixing typo: The connecting thread here: all of the money was paid to a First Republic Bank account Cohen created for Essential Consultants, according to Avenatti. This is the same bank account Cohen used to pay Stormy $130,000 to stay quiet about alleged affair with Trump.
Other entities that Cohen received money from, according to Avenatti, include: pharmaceutical company Novartis; Korea Aerospace Industries, AT&amp;T.
This is what Avenatti is alleging: Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, received money from various entities after the election, including from a company controlled by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.

Trump is now defending John Kelly to a gaggle of reporters, with John Kelly standing right next to him
Trump: “I have great respect for President Xi. That’s why we are being so nice… But we have to bring fairness to trade between US and China."
Trump: "If I though it was fair, I would override my lawyers,” Trump says about a Mueller interview.
Trump: "We ran a great campaign. We won easily. We won that easily… That was a great victory. That was a great day for this country."
Trump: “I would love to speak… Nobody wants to speak more than me. In fact, against my lawyers… I would love to speak. Because we’ve done nothing wrong. There was no collusion with the Russians.
Trump: "In all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for 8 years."
Trump: "It’s actually very simple. But there has been a lot of misinformation, really… I say: learn before you speak. It’s a lot easier."
Trump: "He started yesterday. Ah — he’ll get his facts straight. He’s a great guy."
Trump: “Rudy is a great guy but he just started a day ago… He’s learning the subject matter…. He knows it’s a witch hunt."

"Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say."
@maggieNYT Giuliani says Trump paid Cohen around $460k - $470k total, including money for other “incidental expenses."

Finally saw the whole Rudy clip -- Rudy was *not* asked about Stormy when he started discussing... Stormy... and made major news
I've been sitting here wondering how Rudy would walk the Stormy $ thing back tomorrow if he wanted to but I can't think of how he would do this. "I was talking about a hypothetical"?
Just asked @MichaelAvenatti to react to Rudy comments about Trump paying back Cohen on Stormy $:		“I am stunned and speechless. If this is accurate, the American people have been lied to and deceived for months. And justice must be served.”
Michael Cohen previously said both Trump Org and campiagn were not party to Stormy agreement, and neither paid him back. What Rudy is saying now is that Trump paid Cohen back with his own money.
Just so we are clear: 	-Trump recently said he didn’t know about Stormy payment 	-White House has repeatedly said affair didn’t happen 	-Rudy: Trump paid Cohen back for Stormy hush $

@ChrisMegerian What would we do if it was improperly redacted and you could copy and paste what's behind the black?!
"We would just hand them out. Without having to sign a thing." 		This is what a person who recently worked for Ronny Jackson told CNN about the WH medical unit and its culture of casually dispensing meds. w/ @jmsummers https://t.co/fCSxPILVWn
To clarify, these are former and current staffers at the White House medical unit &gt; https://t.co/CPY1d9QQ3E
The overarching concern is more about broader culture of some WH staffers and officials knowing they could go to the medical unit and obtain medication that in the outside world would require a consultation/exam with a physician.
Admin officials, journalists, etc. will tell you that  the practice of being given Ambien or Provigil on overseas trips are very common. These are high stakes trips and these meds are often necessary to adjust to time zones, sleep and stay alert, etc.
2. One Obama WH staffer walked into WH medical clinic and asked for Z-Paks (strong antibiotics for infections). When the doctor said he needed an exam first bc of possible cardiac complications, he responded: "Dr. Jackson said I can just pick it up and I don't have to be seen."
Two anecdotes from the Obama administration: 1. One high-profile Obama official was leaving the administration and went to the medical unit asking for Provigil. He was given around 20 pills -- and it was viewed as a sort of "parting gift" to him. https://t.co/fCSxPILVWn

@jmsummers Also concerning: WH staffers could casually pick up Ambien even for their children, and get drugs that were not prescribed to the person actually taking the medication. All practices were endorsed by Jackson himself, we're told. https://t.co/fCSxPILVWn
@jmsummers WH medical unit was described as a "grab and go" clinic where mid-level staffers to the most senior officials could obtain prescription drugs without being examined by a doctor. https://t.co/fCSxPILVWn

The ex-Playboy model who signed hush agreement with Elliott Broidy may not get all of the $1.6 million. That’s the thing about hush agreements — once it is breached or made public, the deal is compromised.

Bc we could all use the visual reminder: here is that time in 2016 Michael Cohen signed his name in secret hush agreement with Stormy Daniels: https://t.co/WvRc6uYrwn
“The seized records include communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen." https://t.co/C8EMHiSV4I
Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has been pushing for the disclosure of the details surrounding this suspicious activity report.
Michael Cohen set up an LLC in 2016 for the purpose of making hush payment to Stormy Daniels. At some point, the bank Cohen used flagged a “suspicious” activity report with the Treasury Department.
Trump, meanwhile, said last week that he didn’t know about the $130,000 payment. Also, notably, he referred to Cohen as “my attorney."
Cohen has said that he made the payment to Stormy Daniels in 2016 using his personal funds. He also claims he was never reimbursed by the Trump Organization or Trump campaign.

Pure happy and lovely news &gt; https://t.co/oGgr9FYZFD
This is at the center of case Stormy is trying to make — that the NDA she signed in 2016 should be void, since Trump himself never signed it.
And in a declaration, Stormy Daniels says she didn’t realize until this February that Trump never signed the hush agreement. “Had I known,” Stormy says, “I would have never signed either document nor would I have accepted the $130,000 payment."
Avenatti posed the question to Charles Harder, Trump’s lawyer, in a meeting on March 21. He says there was also a follow-up email on March 30: "Was Donald Trump ever a party to the agreement? If so, how and when?”
Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, says in a new filing that Trump’s lawyer still will not answer the Q of whether Trump was a part of the 2016 hush agreement with Stormy Daniels.
Trump: “I don’t blame China."
Michael Avenatti says on @NewDay that Stormy Daniels met with a composite artist and they now have a sketch of man who allegedly threatened her in 2011. They’ll release that and an award for info on the man tomorrow, he says.

Information about the suspicious banking activity is of "great public concern,” Avenatti wrote in the letter. “Indeed, if the payment was made as innocently as Mr. Cohen has suggested, there should be no objection to the prompt release of the SAR."
In a letter to Sec. Mnuchin, Avenatti is requesting public disclosure of info about a “suspicious activity report” filed by First Republic Bank -- the bank Cohen allegedly used to make the payment to Stormy -- to the Treasury Department. https://t.co/exEYdPPNu9
NEW: Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti is asking the Treasury Department to release information about "suspicious" activity surrounding the porn star's hush-money deal with Michael Cohen. https://t.co/exEYdPPNu9

Wolf asks Avenatti whether his aim is to bait Donald Trump into speaking about Stormy. 		Avenatti: “Our goal is to get straight answers.” @CNN
New: Federal judge in California denies Stormy Daniels’ motion for an expedited trial &amp; expedited discovery – essentially putting a temporary stop to Wednesday’s request to depose Donald Trump and Michael Cohen.
@Ptsbrian @MichaelAvenatti Would really feel more comfortable getting direct comment from Mia. Only fair.
RT @MichaelAvenatti: @mj_lee BTW - to be clear, I meant no disrespect to Mia, my Great Dane. #basta
And Keith Davison tells my colleague @sarasidnerCNN on all of this: "Unfortunately as my previous statement asserted, I am not able to comment."
@Ptsbrian @MichaelAvenatti Actually I haven’t reached out to her yet
(Why yes, of course I have more on the dog. This is Mia, she’s 4 and weighs 155 pounds.) https://t.co/KdeVKIwg9H
@MichaelAvenatti Avenatti adds: “David Schwartz has no role in this case at all. You might as well seek comment from my great dane.”
@MichaelAvenatti Avenatti says he absolutely rejects any suggestion that it was Stormy’s former lawyer who reached out to Cohen first about a payment to stop her from speaking to the media.
Stormy’s CURRENT lawyer @MichaelAvenatti responds: "This is laughable and makes no sense. If he wasn't seeking to silence her than why have he and Mr. Trump continued to threaten her over the last few months repeatedly that if she spoke there would be financial ruin. "
(Asked whether he had any evidence to show this, including anything in writing, Schwartz said he would not discuss evidence.)
“So (Cohen) wasn’t seeking to quiet her. He didn’t even know about it until he was approached. It just happened to be 12 days before the election,” Schwartz tells me this morning.
Shortly before the election, Davidson approached Cohen and told him: “It’ll take $130,000 for her not to” talk to the press about Trump, according to Schwartz.
Michael Cohen’s spokesman, David Schwartz, is now alleging that it was Stormy Daniels’ former attorney, Keith Davidson, who first approached Cohen about a possible hush agreement — not the other way around.
Good morning! Hope you guys are ready for a couple of Stormy tweets since it’s been a little quiet today.

Also @MichaelAvenatti on whether Stormy Daniels would accept a settlement: “We would never consider any settlement that did not include everyone coming 100 percent clean with the American people.”
Avenatti says Harder responded: “We don’t know yet. We’re still researching it.”		That response, Avenatti says, “was incredulous to me.”
Michael Avenatti says he met with Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, on March 21. 		He at one point asked: “Is Donald Trump, your client, a party to this agreement?” (He was referring to the NDA Stormy Daniels signed in 2016.)

Here was the exchange about Stormy Daniels at the White House briefing on Feb 22, when Raj Shah said: "I haven't asked him about that." https://t.co/s6b1y9CEu3
RT @alexburnsNYT: The key phrase: “with Mr. Trump’s knowledge” https://t.co/LyPmrFjCrc
Cohen then then proceeded to wire $130,000 to Stormy’s lawyer’s account, lawsuit says.
Around October 28, 2016, Stormy and Cohen signed the hush agreement, but Trump did not, this lawsuit alleges. Stormy is arguing this renders the agreement “legally null and void and of no consequence.”
Michael Cohen then prepared an NDA and a “hush agreement" was “created by Mr. Cohen with Mr. Trump’s knowledge for one purpose – to hide the true source of funds to be used to pay Ms. Clifford.”
Lawsuit continues: “Trump, with the assistance of his attorney Mr. Cohen, aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth.”
According to lawsuit, Stormy wanted to tell her own Trump story when the Access Hollywood tape came out in October 2016 and she saw that other women were coming forward.
Lawsuit states that Stormy "began an intimate relationship" with Trump in summer or 2006 in Lake Tahoe and continued her relationship "well into the year 2007."
Trump’s alias, according to the Stormy Daniel’s lawsuit — David Dennison https://t.co/rFaXKwSqUt
Asked about lessons from Russian meddling in 2016 US election, Trump talks about... Supreme Court justices.

To be clear, this was the Office of WH Counsel’s response as detailed in the OSC’s report today (see pages 9&amp;10 of the report) &gt; https://t.co/UyN1pCUCvm
Office of Special Counsel’s response to this: “Conway’s statements, made in her official capacity, went beyond providing ‘commentary'… and thus constituted political activity."
Office of White House Counsel says Kellyanne was just offering policy commentary on the “prospects of the President’s agenda” and was not engaging in any advocacy.

There’s just no way that 17-year-old me could have been anywhere close to this smart, reflective and mature as the teenagers who have been interviewed on CNN this week after surviving their school shooting. They are all so impressive.
@agolubowitsch @MorningBluberry @TMiller51 @bpolitics this lady would recommend that everyone read the entire indictment.
So imagine that American – regardless of party, political views, race, background -- who might have just marched in their first rally or made their first political poster or even voted for the first time. Imagine how completely disillusioned this might all make them feel.
After reading this 37-page indictment, I feel utter sadness and borderline depression. American democracy is so precious, but plenty of people take that for granted — everything from not voting to rejecting the political process to feeling resigned their voices aren’t heard.
The Hillary-in-jail costume definitely became a thing at Trump rallies https://t.co/iMVOn78vvC
&gt;&gt;&gt; "Defendants and their co-conspirators deleted and destroyed data, including emails, social media accounts, and other evidence of their activities."
Go back and check out CNN's coverage of this NYC rally from November 2016: It was big, with "angry crowds" marching to Trump Tower. https://t.co/4xtDfvgDTq https://t.co/YKsPODDNFw
Russians continued their efforts AFTER the 2016 election too, including organizing rallies protesting Trump's victory. For example: a rally in NY in November called "Trump is NOT my President."
Russians PAID an American to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform, indictment says (if you're a reporter that covered 2016 campaign, you likely saw such costume on the road)
Russians were also involved in promoting political rallies in 2016 -- and made direct contact (while pretending to be Americans) with Trump campaign staff on the ground, indictment says.
For example, one message posted on an Instagram account called "Woke Blacks": "Hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL."
This is truly sad: The Russians “began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election"
The 2016 candidates these Russians wanted to boost: Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.
The 2016 candidates these Russians targeted, according to the indictment: Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio.
Rod Rosenstein emphasizing at press conference the extraordinary lengths Russians went to to pretend to be Americans — in order to fool Americans that they were Americans
Russians also stole American people’s social security numbers and birthdays to do things like create fake driver’s licenses
The target of Russian social media efforts in the US: create “political intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements."
Wow: Those operating social media accounts while pretending to be Americans “were divided into day-shift and night-shift hours and instructed to make posts in accordance with the appropriate U.S. time zone."
Russians learned, from this American, that “they should focus their actives on “purples states like Colorado, Virginia &amp; Florida."
Indictment details how Russian nationals “posed as” Americans and contacted American political and social activists. In the summer of 2016, they made contact with an American connected to a Texas-based grassroots group.
Arrangement made around May 2016 for a “real U.S. person to stand in front of the WH… under false pretenses to hold a sign that read ‘Happy 55th Birthday Dear Boss.’"
By summer of 2016, there were more than EIGHTY people working on this project at this organization. Its stated goal: “spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system."
The details about the set-up of this organization that meddled in US elections are stunning. It had multiple departments — similar to a newsroom! —handling graphics, data analysis, SEO, IT, etc.

Another painful detail: Both ex-wives tell me a woman claiming to be Porter's girlfriend contacted beach of them last year, asking for help. She said she was being abused by Porter, and wanted their advice. https://t.co/3Nn82078ZY
Rob Porter's ex-wife tells me he constantly choked her, threw her on the bed and put his body weight on her using a limb, and in 2005, punched her face. Says she didn't realize how bad the situation was until a counselor told her this was not OK. https://t.co/3Nn82078ZY https://t.co/x6kLYq1pg7

House sexual harassment bill is expected to be unveiled next week, after a delay before the winter break, per @SunlenSerfaty. Hope is for a vote this month.
Just to be clear, Gov. Greitens has so far, through a lawyer:	- Denied taking photo of the woman	- Denied suggesting he could make photo public	- Said there was no settlement or NDA	- Said he has never before been accused of other misconduct by anyone else
When Frankel had brought up this idea in a meeting earlier this week, Pelosi asked her not to do this because it would be a distraction from bipartisan efforts to address sexual harassment, per Dem aide https://t.co/uIePdZ9fX8
Rep. Frankel tells me she won't rule out holding mock hearings with Trump accusers in the future -- while she's focused on bipartisan efforts for now, "I don’t ever want to be called a liar – what we’re going to do in the future, I’m not going to predict.”

One thing to keep in mind on these settlement figures: impossible to know for sure without more details, but possible that part or even bulk of these settlements went toward covering legal fees https://t.co/JZvbq6xpcg
Between 2008 &amp; 2012, three settlements involving House offices:	1. Sexual harassment &amp; harassment because of retaliation: $85,000	2. Sex discrimination (including sexual harassment) &amp; retaliation: $10,000	3. Sexual harassment because of retaliation &amp; sex discrimination: $20,000 https://t.co/N6OUBT52Y3
There were at least 3 sexual harassment-related settlements involving House offices from 2008-2012, according to the OOC. The total amount of taxpayer $ that went towards settlements for these three cases: $115,000.
