@nathandaschle There‚Äôs no doubt Schultz could have an impact on the outcome of the 2020 general election, if he runs. But if his goal is to actually be elected president as an independent, we‚Äôve still seen nothing to suggest he‚Äôs capable of doing what Mike Bloomberg concluded he could not.
Schultz reminds me of something @nathandaschle once said about Meg Whitman‚Äôs gov campaign: she ran as an outsider and non-politician, but her ultra-glossy presentation and extreme reliance on talking points made her appear as rigidly conventional as any candidate of 2010 https://t.co/p4Sbesli57
@PoppyHarlowCNN And the talking points wear even thinner on conflict-of-interest Qs. Schultz keeps repeating that his investments in Starbucks, which does huge business in China, would not affect policy. But he declines to say, under repeated questioning, whether he‚Äôd divest his Starbucks stock.
Schultz‚Äôs answer on taxes included slaps at both parties (GOP on tax-cut law, Dems on AOC‚Äôs proposed hikes) but was just as empty of actual ideas. Said he should pay a higher tax rate, but then wouldn‚Äôt even give a general answer to @PoppyHarlowCNN on *how much* higher.
Schultz‚Äôs answer on climate really captures how he‚Äôs approaching 2020: says addressing climate is a top priority and then spends most of the answer slamming the Green New Deal. No policy proposals of his own, fire trained on liberal Democrats.

@julianzelizer Not really. He has relied on a combination of cultural/partisan polarization and, during the campaign, issue positions that were not conventionally Republican. One of his greatest strengths in 2016 was his ability to marshal GOP support without campaigning on Paul Ryan‚Äôs ideas.
This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwhat if Trump actually governed as a moderate‚Äù fantasy ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt involve him reversing or even tempering many of his most divisive positions. It‚Äôs a scenario where he just prioritizes popular stances he took during the campaign.
The conventional rejoinder is: if he hadn‚Äôt prioritized Obamacare, he could‚Äôve faced an insurrection on the right. I guess in theory, but would Trump really have lost a tug of war with Mark Meadows (or whoever) in the first months of his presidency? Is that likely?
Basically, what if the energy he poured into the ACA repeal debacle had gone toward some of the most popular ideas he campaigned on, like infrastructure and drug-pricing legislation?

Burden is on Howard Schultz to prove that he‚Äôs relevant, but if he does that, does the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs win the center‚Äù argument in the Dem primary get weaker or stronger?

The gap between this picture, and the preferences we saw from Dem primary voters in 2018, suggests room for some whiplash-inducing movement early next year

@daveweigel @JakeSherman @kyledcheney Yes though also true of Biden, Bloomberg, etc. ‚Äî isn‚Äôt the left where you‚Äôd most naturally take heat in a Dem primary? And think Patrick‚Äôs issues have as much to do with currency/relevance as ideology/purity, which differs from Harris and Booker
@JakeSherman @kyledcheney Is Trump‚Äôs tax bill pretty popular with Democrats Jake
@kyledcheney I think it‚Äôs a hurdle for any governor, but some of the folks who have held office under Trump do have stories to tell about pushing back on the administration. Patrick doesn‚Äôt have any particularly compelling story to tell about that, even as a private citizen.
@kyledcheney ... and most of all, I wonder how much ‚ÄúObama-like‚Äù also means ‚Äúpre-Trump‚Äù when it comes to style, oratory, outlook, etc. Notion that our differences are not as deep as they may seem strikes me as pretty antiquated.
@kyledcheney Sure, he‚Äôs not without appeal, but not sure coming from outside DC is an asset when Dem identity is so defined by fighting Trump, and not sure a 2-term gov and senior DOJ official is anyone‚Äôs idea of a political outsider ...
@icudred You‚Äôre back!

(Btw, it‚Äôs never really been the case that this stuff just bounces off Trump ‚Äî he has been a consistently unpopular president and voters have punished his party severely for his unpopularity)
The perception that this stuff just bounces off Trump has a lot to do with 2016, but it also comes from the fact that Congress conducted virtually no scrutiny of WH scandals over the last 2 years. Hard to envision in advance how much differently things might play out in 2019.

It‚Äôs a statement on the scale of Dem gains that they appear likely to meet or exceed their high hopes for NY/NJ/CA ‚Äî and the wins from those states will comprise about a *third* of their overall House pickups.
At the beginning of the cycle, Dems pointed out that they could ‚Äî in theory ‚Äî get more than 1/2 of the 23 seats needed for a majority just from NY, NJ and CA. Seemed like a heavy lift.		Well, they‚Äôre currently +11 in those states, likely to end up +13 once NY22 &amp; CA39 are called.

@yeselson She‚Äôs a superb populist politician. So is Brown. Like I said, there‚Äôs more than one way to win a state. And I think acting like there‚Äôs no difference in orientation/tone/strategy between the Beto (or Gillum) approach, and theirs, misses some important texture.
@yeselson It‚Äôs not mainly an issue of WJC-style centrists vs. Beto-style liberal insurgents. But there are liberal Dems who also actively seek out opportunities to reassure the center and center-right, and others who reject that as unnecessary and inauthentic.
@yeselson Pro- vs anti-union not much of a way to parse differences between national Dems		But there are obvious places where the Midwestern folks play to the center: Brown‚Äôs not for single payer &amp; Whitmer ran against it in primary. Tony Evers made a no-tax-hikes pledge.

@NickRiccardi @billscher I can see somewhat more value in aggregate forecasts ‚Äî like, for Rs to keep the House, or for Dems to win 40 seats, they‚Äôd need X number of 1-in-3 chances to work out in their favor. As a way of expressing ranges of likely outcomes rather than just binary win/loss predictions.

@cd_hooks @JStein_WaPo @Bencjacobs I agree with that, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why people are uninformed. The name on the ballot thing is just one limited proxy for awareness.
@JStein_WaPo @Bencjacobs I also reject the idea that most Americans are generally well informed about the two parties, beyond very surface-level impressions. That‚Äôs part of why there‚Äôs such volatility in our system. People vote for parties with very clear agendas, then recoil from their implementation.
@JStein_WaPo @Bencjacobs That‚Äôs changing the terms of discussion here. Can someone make a reasonably good choice just by party-line voting? Sure. Is someone informed about democracy if they don‚Äôt even know who‚Äôs on the ballot? No. I‚Äôm not talking about obscure dog-catcher elections here.

The first argument might be one that persuades the senators who will decide the Kavanaugh nomination. The second one almost certainly is not.
A lot of Republicans are taking the view that the allegations against Kavanaugh are not substantiated or credible enough to warrant opposing him. Trump‚Äôs view over time has been that virtually *any* allegation is rendered non-credible by a simple denial. https://t.co/mmKDBWVm4B
Even with Trump‚Äôs own history of serious alleged misconduct, it‚Äôs worth considering whether he‚Äôd have more authority to defend Kavanaugh if he‚Äôd dropped Roy Moore rather than dismissing detailed charges of predation and child molestation https://t.co/VJlUmNcizZ https://t.co/QjNt1aLsOt

@sullydish @Bencjacobs And mine was that I think you‚Äôre very wrong to write off health care as a potentially decisive issue this year (though it sounds from this tweet like perhaps your view of that is more conditional than conveyed in the column.)
I understand the substance of this argument, and why it matters a lot to Kavanaugh‚Äôs allies and friends. But I wonder if it translates with most voters. How many of them are invested in a Kavanaugh as an individual, as opposed to as an instrument? https://t.co/FBJOvnHnMp

@dontforgetmac @JakeReif @GregJKrieg Yup. People can also be fired up to vote about more than one thing, and different people can be fired up about different things. My issue was with the casual and total dismissal of one of the few indisputably relevant policy concerns this year.
@dontforgetmac @JakeReif @GregJKrieg You don‚Äôt have to imagine voters have extremely well defined views about how the health insurance system ought to be structured, to believe them when they say they‚Äôre looking for a candidate who they trust not to screw up their health care.
@dontforgetmac @JakeReif @GregJKrieg I don‚Äôt want to belabor this, but: you don‚Äôt have to give voters a lot of ‚Äúcredit‚Äù to think that they can feel alarmed about different things at different times, and that fear or anxiety about health care costs/access can translate into voting behavior.
@NathanKalmoe And I‚Äôll add that lazily caricaturing another person‚Äôs profession, in order to minimize and dismiss competing views, is a very shoddy form of argument and I hope you do better than that with your colleagues and students.
@NathanKalmoe You‚Äôre presupposing that I‚Äôm making broad conclusions about the electorate based on gas station interviews, which I‚Äôm not. Voters don‚Äôt need to have durable and specific views on health care for anxiety about health care to be an important dynamic in a specific election.
@NathanKalmoe If you think that because voters don‚Äôt have strong issue preferences, we can‚Äôt trust what they say in polls or interviews, or make inferences from the policies candidates choose to campaign on, that‚Äôs effectively a license to impose any interpretation you want on the electorate.

@dontforgetmac @GregJKrieg It will hinge on a lot of things but health care is definitely one of the biggest
(Re-reading it, the rhetorical choice to group health care ‚Äî a life-or-death or bankruptcy-threatening issue for millions ‚Äî with relatively abstract debates about ‚Äúnorms‚Äù and the executive branch is probably the most revealing part.)
You can argue that tribalism is a defining force - or the defining force - in American politics without making the kind of claim that suggests you‚Äôve never talked to an undecided voter or visited a competitive congressional district or state.
Columnists often project their own interests and views onto voters. But this, from Andrew Sullivan, is so wildly detached from the lived reality of anyone involved in or reporting on, or in many cases voting in, the 2018 election. https://t.co/dMlvdplWy9

@avizenilman I think the ideological trend among Dems at the state and local level is pretty clear in these blue machine states, but yeah, totally unclear at this point what it translates to at the federal level
@matthewstoller Beyond that, I'm not really going to keep going in circles, and maybe it's a conversation best continued off Twitter at some point.
@matthewstoller And it's possible to respect or venerate, as you clearly do, the power and values of more traditional left institutions without waving away the distinctions between these very different forces.
@matthewstoller You've said all this before &amp; you're just talking past all of my replies. There's a long tradition in Dem politics of shifting alliances b/t old-line party institutions &amp; labor groups, elite civic reformers &amp; editorialists, &amp; minority &amp; immigrant communities. This fits in w/that.
@avizenilman He's definitely different in ideological orientation, but his initial victory/subsequent impact/recent star status all reflect Dem demand for bold new voices and a repudiation of the wait-your-turn way of doing business in the party
@matthewstoller OK, so you can say that, as you just did, without concocting an inaccurate narrative about the race that just unfolded and why she won. There's obviously no guarantee that a candidate will govern in keeping with the aspirations of the people who voted for them.
@matthewstoller The idea that you can stack those people up against the mayor of Boston, an array of powerful unions, the last Dem governor, etc., and say, well, the machine was split ‚Äì no, that's not how politics works in Massachusetts.
@matthewstoller Did Bernie's backing from Ellison, Merkley and Gabbard mean the establishment was split? Come on. You flagged several liberal women of color, who represent a relatively new force in Boston politics, and Maura Healey, who beat the party-endorsed candidate in a '14 primary.
@matthewstoller You can take the view that Pressley doesn't represent the right kind of ideological change for the party without trying to downplay, implausibly, the authentic social and cultural forces behind her victory.
@matthewstoller Think you're toggling between mismatched arguments here a bit. Don't think Maura Healey and Michelle Wu, et al., are good examples of institutional/"big money" power manipulating grassroots energy.
@matthewstoller Think that's at best reductive, and I would say incorrect, way to view the Globe endorsement. Like someone saying NYT's endorsement for Teachout is a sign that "the machine" is split, which I suspect you'd recognize as wrong. Not all power is part of a political machine.

@JakeLaperruque Yeah, he did health care over Rahm's more cautious of advice. He also ran the health care push with great deference to centrist Senate Dems like Baucus, and got a process and product that reflected that.
@JakeLaperruque Look, I'm not endorsing the view that Obama was a centrist president, though you hear that from plenty of frustrated Dems. But a president of the left, elected in a near-landslide with full control of DC, probably goes a lot bigger on a lot of things, starting w/bank regulation.
@JakeLaperruque That's all consistent with being a liberal pragmatist, rather than a Clinton-style centrist or a Sanders-style activist. And Obama's rhetoric in 2008 let him be a lot of things to a lot of people, which is part of why the '08 version of his coalition didn't really hang together.
@Tzipshmil @JakeLaperruque I didn't say he wasn't a liberal. I said he was a pragmatist. He was clearly both.
@JakeLaperruque Some liberals might have heard the message that way but Obama was a pretty avowed pragmatist as a candidate and certainly as president
