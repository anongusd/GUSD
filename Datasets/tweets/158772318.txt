@janineannett A very tough thing. We lost our tuxedo cat after 18 years too. Our two teenage boys dug a grave in the back yard and said goodbye to a member of the family.
@JeromeAdamsMD @GovHolcomb @GovMattBevin I want to be there for that push-up contest, live-tweeting and shooting video.
@bartonswaim Next, isten to Mahler‚Äôs second and really freak them out
@davidfolkenflik We both know why. It gives him more ammo in his war on journalism, and furthers his cause in sowing doubt about facts, truth and democracy itself.
@RosieGray Not sure he‚Äôs really that ‚Äúworked up.‚Äù He sees an easy score in his crazy war on journalism and truth, and is milking it for everything it‚Äôs worth.
@jswatz Whoa, that‚Äôs one crispy slice
