Per US Health and Human Services, here's how to know if your mail has been IRRADIATED for safety.  "Weakened or discolored/yellowed envelopes.. transfer of inks"
@OKnox Yup.  White House mail facility moved off-site in 1996.  Then moved further (Md) after anthrax in 2001
WHITE HOUSE MAIL SCREENING FACILITY:  In 2017, it tested 5,000 samples for possible biological threats, 2,400 samples for chemical threats
Congress decided to appropriate $7 million in 2005 for a better mail irradiation facility in Washington, D.C.    In January 2008, US Secret Service abandon plans to build the facility, opting instead for contractors to do so
DC federal goverment mail experienced delays of two to three days because of irradiation screenings, per federal records
US Dept of Homeland Security has long recommended all high-profile businesses or government facilities establish OFF-SITE mail screening facilities
Federal mail in Washington DC:   1.2 million containers irradiated over seven year span.  Per federal records
Cost of irradiating federal government mail for threats costs an estimated $10 million a year, per federal records
MORE:  Postal Service irradiates mail sent to government offices in zip codes 20200 through 20599 in Washington, D.C.   Per agency records
All mail directed to White House, Congress and Library of Congress is irradiated, per US Postal Service.
Per agency records, US Secret Service processes about 634,000 pieces of incoming and outgoing mail at its field offices, including in Washington D.C.
Per agency records, US Secret Service screens more than 4 MILLION PIECES OF MAIL each year.
