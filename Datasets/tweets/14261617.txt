Have some questions about this FFA charter revision? We've got answers: https://t.co/Eklo4KEFOV
Another proposed revision allows the organization to consider an expansion of the number of national officers representing the organization’s growing membership, should the need be realized.
This involvement will guarantee the relevance of agricultural education in our nation’s schools and prepare students to fill the 235 unique careers in agriculture. #NextGenAg
The revised charter grants the board power to appoint the chair and the National FFA Advisor, and provides that the FFA board consist of individuals representing education, agriculture, food and natural resources.
We believe a revised FFA federal charter will provide needed flexibility for our board of directors and allow FFA to maintain strong ties with the industry of agriculture.

We’ll be sure to pass along news about how to help our FFA members specifically in these areas when it becomes available.
National FFA has just recently been able to establish limited contact with state staff in both areas, and we’re working with them.
The storms have especially impacted our FFA members and advisors, many of whom work and live outside the heaviest population centers.
The situation in both areas is devastating. There is catastrophic damage and lines for rationed food, gas and water often stretch for days.
Many of you have reached out about helping our friends in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands after the hurricanes. Today we have an update.
