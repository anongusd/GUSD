@aliwatson117 @temersonb @powhatannative @DonaldJTrumpJr Once again, I do not endorse the use of the Pocahontas slur however I do focus more on the fact that the woman was raped and murdered then the comment that was made!
@powhatannative @aliwatson117 @temersonb @DonaldJTrumpJr I do care about savanna‚Äôs act‚Ä¶ I donated to the families of victims as well as to the education of our youth, maybe you should step up and do something from your end I am only one person...
@aliwatson117 @powhatannative @temersonb @DonaldJTrumpJr I suppose you think the same of my dad since he has the same believe system as I do as you can clearly see by multiple articles written with him and about him...
@powhatannative @aliwatson117 @temersonb @DonaldJTrumpJr Rape jokes are not funny and they are highly inappropriate however I am pointing out that the focus should be on the missing and murdered not on the comment of Pocahontas even though yes that is equally inappropriate
@temersonb @aliwatson117 @powhatannative @DonaldJTrumpJr Amen, i‚Äôm thinking the raped and murdered part is worse than the Pocahontas comment too
