The devil now is in Obama's details because he just proposed massive new spending.   We need to empower our economy by scaling back govt.
One POTUS truth (and to his credit, a turning point) that his activist base needs to hear is the need to change Medicare in order to save it

POTUS needs to take responsibility and get control of his agencies.  Jobs means growth not more government.
