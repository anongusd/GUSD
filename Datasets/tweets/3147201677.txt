@chrisiousity I at least don't believe that your video touches on this school of thought.
@chrisiousity I don't think that the business or platform should be allowed to pick its customers. If people want to ignore each other or whatever that's something that should be left to the people to do, not the platform.
@chrisiousity Okay, so now that I've watched this again, Do you agree with the humanization of businesses/platforms? I don't. I think this is an unhealthy way to see businesses and platforms. They should just be seen and just mere function in society and nothing else.

@chrisiousity they've done it before. They devour each other way more than the left colectively does, and they've tried to deplatform leftists before. Last case of this I can think of is Xexizy. AKA Muke.
@chrisiousity off the top of my head, I'd say that both sides engage in deplatforming which I disagree with.
@chrisiousity To my understanding the methods are comparable but the goals are radically different. Hitler wanted genocide. SJW's want a sandbpx world were everyone's safe and happy.

@RantingF True but you can't count on people (in general) to act completely rationally all the time. In this situation I wouldn't consider him a rational agent. Aside from that I'd have to be there. That's all I can gather.
@RantingF I'd have to be there though when it happened though
@RantingF I personally had a hard time telling what was going on, but it seemed like she seemed like the one that initiated the situation in the first place and everything he was doing was in response to what she was doing first so I would say that he's more in the wrong.

@discordspies Please keep being a progressive shitlord. I love it.
@JillFilipovic Only if you will first.
@maria_thewitch Some of my friends listen to them.
@FelicityTV There's a lot you can do with pizza, Chicken spinach Alfredo pizza, Pesto pizza,  Pb&amp;j pizza, s'mores pizza, fruit pizza, tarte flambée. So much.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Okay but this still shows that they aren't principled to a fault on this.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Even in the cases that seem very absolute there's plenty of pragmatic stipulations to these things.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Another would be anti Monopoly laws that prevent one business from having all of a particular thing so that they can't price gouge the public which depending on what it is could actually really hurt all of society.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch That's something they tend to believe but these are some that don't think these rights should be unalienable. E.g. when the rich have so much money that there isn't Enough to go around. Many liberals advocate for redistributive policies in this case
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch That's still just a liberal idea That still doesn't mean that all liberalism is that. you are right that property rights came from liberal school of though.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Thinking about it that sounds like here when people conflate conservatism and capitalism. there's a reason libertarians exist in america. (I know that these people would be called liberals in the rest of the world.)
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Its just that many liberals tend to support capitalism because that's what they grew up under and they don't think its so bad and because of the way the capitalist system work they'll fund things to teach youth to grow up to preserve the system. That doesn't make liberalism cap
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Okay I thought we were talking about america more so for the moment. My mistake. But, either way there's no such thing as economic liberalism just as there's not such thing as economic conservatism. They're both nonsense terms. Liberalism isn't tied to capitalism.
@BorderlinerBish @maria_thewitch eh, yes and no. There's not ideological position that calls itself center nor will there ever be but for many people if you take their positions and examine them they usually agree with some things from each side which puts them in a "center"
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Its just many liberals are pro market but not all. You can be radically capitalist or a radical kropotkinist and still believe in liberalism at least in its basic principles of ideas and culture and what not to spread freely.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch The education part is true, the rest of that isn't. Many conservative believe in privatized education, and there's nothing about economics that's inherently liberal for the most part. I live in trump country. I can confidently assure that conservatives today are not liberal.
@LightningSamus @maria_thewitch Most conservatism today is still anti liberal.
@Livibeeee Pics or it didn't happen.
@maria_thewitch Yes but I wouldn't conflate liberals with conservatives. I'd say liberals are center conservatives are right and progressives are left/socialist/communit/Marxist/Kropotkinist/etc

@RantingF fair enough. Coarse I didn't think I'd get a response to this just cause it was so stupid. thank you though. XD
any thoughts on this? I forgot the rest of mine but I think I conveyed the idea effectively. thank you for your time and have a nice day.  I'm also still drunk right now but came up with this sober.
at least if I were them, I wouldn't want to count on just that, so this system would be preserved through denial, which would work because this is admittedly a really stupid thing to believe and I don't believe it either, but I do find it funny and fucking genius. Pun intended.
its too petty to really do anything about, because I can't imagine doing anything to repeal any policies or laws  already in place against man spreading, only because the whole man spreading thing was created under an ulterior motive, but...
This could very well be a very convoluted system of identifying men who have huge dicks, and on top of this, if this is the case this is never going away. Normie women aren't giving this system up if they're aware of it, and...
the men that are gonna complain about man spreading the most are going to be men that have large dick and likely proportionately large testicles. Right? Right.
I think its possible that there's a group of self serving "feminists" (in quotes for a reason), that used this to identify which men are "large" I'll explain...
Okay, so I thought of this fore a total of literally seconds. About the whole man spreading thing....

@DataDistribute do you have any of those examples on hand. Just want to go off of what you're going off of.
@DataDistribute You're right about that but we don't have or tried anything that actually ensures that yet, so you can't really its not achievable. I know its easier said than done but we just have to give the schools that same funding for each student and make sure the curriculum's all the same
lol guess I'm nothing then XD https://t.co/0OiIJOoUCo
@DataDistribute socio-economic issues as far as schools and healthcare that we can ensure equal opportunity. As far as broken homes. Coming from one I can tell you that you can't fix that. You can try to prevent that but you can't fix that. Each one's its own rabbit hole to go down.
@DataDistribute wait, how's equal opportunity meaningless?
@DataDistribute I was thinking about programs to help them help themselves. All the examples that I can think of this at the moment are things that help everyone.
@DataDistribute Oh god no. I don't want that.
@DataDistribute what's redistributed justice?
@DataDistribute I believe we should do somethings to bring them up in our society, giving them a hand. but how far we should go to do this is hard for me to really give an answer to because there aren't enough people that are completely aware of how deep the problems really are. So, I don't know
@DataDistribute To my understanding progressives believe that if you just only give them equality under the law and nothing else, they'll still be living the same way they were before and at least to them nothing's changed. I agree with this for the most part.
@DataDistribute I wasn't trying to propose anything at the moment I was just wondering if I had judged your position on this topic correctly.

@cultofdusty yeah that's totally not a fair critisism. There's a chance you'd have to deal with some of the baggage that white people have caused those communities and you shouldn't have to drop dead for it.
@bearingcab @MsBlaireWhite @cultofdusty but they'll still hold it against him because people tend to not think of these things on an individual basis and he shouldn't have to die because of it. He'd still be bound to have to deal with at least some of that baggage at some point

@KWintie But I'll also say that if every single person that made jokes about any demographic of people were genuinely bigoted against anyone that they made their joke toward, can you say they're really joking? Or if this was really true I think these issues would be much bigger/apparent.
@KWintie I can say that most of humor that I've encountered throughout my life has been mean spirited at least to some extent but I honestly don't know how to prove that.

@EmilyKrumlinde  We're going to eat pizza. we're gonna have a party. 	Thought you'd find that funny. have a nice day if I don't catch your next stream.
@KWintie I completely disagree. Most humor is mean spirited. My humor is hideously dark. Most of the things that I find funny I'd never actually be okay with doing to people.
@ContraPoints Looks great.
@chrisiousity shit I meant to say that I don't believe that people are generally benevolent.
@chrisiousity I personally believe that people are generally benevolent. I would still say that this guy is exceptional. I believe that most people are at best malevolent and at worse a preditor of some kind, whether political, economic, social and/or sexual.
@panicsw1tched your guess is as good as mine.
@Music_Man_Mike okay
@marinashutup XD christ...
@Barbara4u2 prove it. I don't believe you.
@marinashutup @EvrydayFeminism I have never understood how anyone can come to believe that bisexuality or pansexuallity can't exist. I'm also saying as someone that grew up in a very religious family.
@EvrydayFeminism @marinashutup I'm reading this and saying to myself... well no shit... I'm just wondering why this matters?

@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta oh okay. Nevermind about the speculation shit I was saying then.
@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta did she specifically tell you what happened?
@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta I'm willing to believe that she's not quite doing what everyone's saying that she's doing but it sounds to me that you're speculating that she isn't doing this.
@Music_Man_Mike you said that's what you're doing.
@OneSpeciesReal @Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta eh that's not necessary.
@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta Doesn't mean you have to withdraw from them though.
@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta Do you realize you're putting yourself in a position to be taken advantage of?	You're blindly believing your friend even with some evidence saying that what you believe isn't quite correct. I know you're just trying to be a friend but sometimes you just cant defend certain things
@Music_Man_Mike @demonsthenes13 I was going to point it out cause I wasn't sure if you caught that but someone else beat me to it.
@Music_Man_Mike @Drallasta when was the comment made and when was the stream the destiny was on explaining JF to her audience? the 2 dates of those are really all that matter.
@brahim_doc @muke010 I don't know how long ago she moved to Germany.
@RantingF I'm still followed.
@brahim_doc @muke010 She's also said she'd never support bernie
@brahim_doc @muke010 That's why I'm not sure.
@Marxarchist @WingTransparent oh okay. my mistake.
@defystars_ @WingTransparent Yeah you can defend yourself if you're personal autonomy is infringed on but you can't police people on stuff like that in general. Its just not worth your time and effort.
@defystars_ @WingTransparent yeah people change but not on a dime. They're less likely to change if you either give them shit or ostisize them for their views. you're better off talking about it and if they still disagree you're going to have to learn to live with that.
@defystars_ @WingTransparent There are some things you just don't have control over. I'm not going to police people's politics, I have friends that are complete ideological opposites of me (for the most part), regardless of if their believes and political positions effects me or not doesn't matter
@Marxarchist @WingTransparent my argument wasn't based on it. I was just using it to explain what I was trying to say.
@Marxarchist @WingTransparent I wasn't campairing sugar levels. dr pepper and rootbeer are 2 different sodas but they're both still soda.
@defystars_ @WingTransparent neither do I.
@WingTransparent @defystars_ It was after but I don't think the selfie really matters.
@defystars_ @muke010 @Kaylee_Hends what does the selfie matter. You can view people separate from their political views in the overwhelming majority of cases.	I like Sargon but I don't agree with some of his political views, same with bunty, same with claudia, same with Jimmy dore and with many others.
@WingTransparent @defystars_ I remember harmful opinions. My brother showed me some of their stuff and warned everyone about the system YT was going to implement and everyone worked to cencor him out.
@WingTransparent @Bi_Syndicalist thank god some people understand that.
@WingTransparent Fair enough I guess.
@WingTransparent I get that but that's not the point I'm trying to make.
@WingTransparent yeah but they're still different enough to be their own things.
@WingTransparent more like dr pepper and root beer.
@muke010 So does this mean that she's a neo liberal or is that too specific? She always came across that way to me.
@muke010 Hope she comes back she kinda grew on me a bit. She was also one of the few people that I follow on here that actually responds to stuff I say.
@WingTransparent Like I said she's different enough from them to be her own thing.
@WingTransparent @muke010 Nah she really is. She's not quite like everyone in any particular group. She's an anti-sjw with more than a few exceptions.

Thank you for your time if you do happen to respond to this.
If you don't have anything off hand or off the top of your head I was wondering if there was some site or something that explains these things more in depth because neither of us knew enough about it on a deep enough level to really finish the conversation.
He doesn't like the idea of having people transition if it solely and only something that the person is getting hung up on, and its just something that's just completely in their head.
My friend was saying that if it can be proven if it hasn't already that gender disphoria is something that can be seen in the brain like PTSD or ADD or ADHD or something of the like, he would be completely fine with it.
We agreed to disagree on the protecting people from themselves. I don't believe in protecting the individual from themselves where he does, and my friend believes in pragmatism over principle where I believe in principle over pragmatism.
Hey @gwen_no_fear me and a friend of mine were talking about people who transition. We ended up debating whether transitioning was harmful to allow people to do.
@gwen_no_fear I see it both ways.

@ScourgeAK @ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil I wouldn't go as far as to say that. People are going to do what they want, but there are reason people say that.
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil She's not being arrogant though. She's just living in the real world man. Not everything is a disney story. In fact, almost nothing is.
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil that doesn't mean they don't. Again, I understand why you're saying what you're saying but you have to live in the real world. It sucks but that's what you have to face.
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil Okay but these things play HUGE roles in romantic chemistry.
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil I could expect a lot of people above the working class to being willing AND able to deal with. No one suffers like the poor man. There's reasons for this. Most of them obvious at least to me anyways.
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil I would agree with you if I watched their content and they came across as stuck up, petty and pompous but she doesn't and she's not trying to imply that she looks down on poor people. She's just living in the real world and there's baggage that poor people have that I don't think
@ZsklongJ @dasukocho @RoamingMil You're too sensitive to subtext. You're seeing things that just aren't there. I understand why you're making the argument you are but you're going to have to come back to the real world man...
@ZsklongJ @RoamingMil @_BlackGuyT You can't expect people to be willing to deal with a close partner that has an incurable amount of baggage. Nobody suffers like that poor. I sympathize with what you're saying but you have to come back to the real world.

@RantingF I don't know if anyone caught this but his face gets redder from beginning to end of that short video, either he's trying to stop himself from laughing or he wants the guy next to him or something.
@RantingF Most of the libertarian right believes that to some extent. Styx is radically capitalist. I'd expect that coming from him.
@RantingF nah most racists are either openly and/or casually racist.
YOU HEARD IT HERE FOLKS!!! https://t.co/0DuKbzEAKb
@the1janitor Also taking time to just solve very casually helps too. You'll occasionally find and learn different and/or faster ways of doing some things, usually things that help you out in earlier parts of the solve.
@the1janitor Also if you look at the roux (pronounced roo, its french in case you were wondering) and petrus methods the one thing I took away from trying to learn those a little bit is that some times its definitely faster to build a 2x2x2 or 3x2x2 block first then solve normal from there.

@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty eh true but I think this place may actually get better.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty that shit would never happen here. damn.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty They're not going to give you that. Maybe where you are or are from that's much more possible. around here unless you have a lot of experience in a particular sector, you have zero negotiating power.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty Here that's slightly above minimum wage.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty But that doesn't reflex how they pay their employees though.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty the one in my area does give raise which I never expected but they dont' let you negotiate your wage. I have never worked for an employer that does that and the only ones that I can imagine do are employers that employ the well educated.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty that depends on the specific store, and in most cases you're going to be below the poverty line.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty I actually said something wrong earlier. 50% of women hold minimum wage jobs. not the other way around. Most minimum wage employers don't let you negotiate your wage at all.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty That doesn't mean anything. At least where I am it doesn't mean anything. They'll just tell you that you'll start out at minimum wage. I've only worked for 2 employers that don't do this.
@the1janitor Have you thought about learning a more advanced method? twisty puzzles have been a long time hobby of mine. started back in 2008. It became more passive over time but I still solve and speed solve cubes now and then. I can link you to some resources if you want.
@AbsurdEvolution @cultofdusty Most businesses don't allow you to negotiate your wage. you also have to remember women hold more entry level job positions than men. So I question the statistic that that came from. I don't think that study looked far enough into that.

@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie for instance one black kid could be sad but fine, the next one could have been super codependent on their parents who are now dead.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie the results aren't going to be consistent. they're all going to be under different circumstances you don't have enough of a control over the samples.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie They're adopted which is super hit or miss because of the baggage that come with being an adopted kid mainly because of what leads up to being put up for adoption.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie I've only gotten that from just articles that I've seen floating around here and there over the last year or so. I've never looked that deep into it but I'll find things on it if you want.
@maria_thewitch sounds like an action horror film.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie I'm not arguing my initial claim at the very moment I'm saying that some of the things in the evidence that you posts are either things that don't matter or aren't caused by the things that its saying or implying that they're caused by.
@maria_thewitch write a script about a dream you wanna have.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie All of the arguments in that article that you posted seem to all be environmental factor and have little to do with the actual biology. None of it proves that biology has anything to do with it.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie The reason I bring that up is because He's likely right about that.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie "I imagine that this is due to xenophilic infatuation and lust vs. real personality similarity. I.e. it’s not because you’re truly in love with her, it’s because she’s a latina and looks “exotic” or some such nonsense."	This is an fetishization .which is environmental.

@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie Sorry I was just talking about the video you posted.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie Doesn't go into the racial issues in the societies that he's talking about. Doesn't go into immigrants vs  people that grew up in our society. cherry picked graphs of the demographics. No analysis as to why some mixed marriages end up falling apart. No analysis of cultures, etc.
@izwhechtsuppe @DataDistribute @KWintie Again this guy is coming to these conclusions off of way too little information. these videos that he makes on these topics should be at least twice to three times the lengths .
@InsiderFood What stage of capitalism is this?
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie a lot of the blacks and Hispanics that would have voted Bernie don't vote because they believe that the system's against them and that there's nothing they can really do about it. Those that voted hillary either dont know she isnt progressive or they''re neo-liberals like hillary
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie Do you have anything to say to my response so far @FirstOccidental ? I'll come back to this later if I don't respond right away. its 6:20 am where I am.

@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie People of all shades and walks of like though not many wealthy people which would be the only exception to this were willing to vote for bernie and strongly perfered him over clinton by a mile.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie Colored people would, if white would be republicans vote for what are known as Neo-liberal democrats. People like Hillary Clinton, Bill, Nancy Palosi, Tom Perez, the like. These people don't reflect the base of the party at all.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie Republicans also knowingly and deliberately play upon the bigotry of the poor whites to get themselves elected and them believing the kinds of things that this video says certainly doesn't help at all.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie they need to do that so that they get paid by these big businessmen and corporations. Democrats do this too.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie For example. The republicans take advantage of the ignorance of the poor whites, by making their low tax systems sound smart to them leaving them with the belief that they get a reasonable amount of the money that the businesses aren't taxed anymore.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie He has come to this conclusion off of way too little information.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie Okay. So I watched this video.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie I would say that its a good thing that american isn't synonymous with any ethnic origin. Most of the people hat I've ever talked to about agree.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie I'm just a decentralist. I'm definitely left, but I'm not an SJW or progressive though I would say that I tend to agree with them on many things. I almost want to compare myself to Jimmy Dore but there's still some differences. I'm globalist but want a decentralist model for it.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie Honestly, most people that I've met don't tie american to any ethnic origin. We're going in a direction where we'll be a majority mixed race anyways in just a few decades.
@DataDistribute @FirstOccidental @KWintie For those that believe, that's a side they can always take.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie I never really cared that much about my race and I'm not religious at all. I watch the distributist to keep tabs on that political perspective. I do like to interact and discuss things though.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie though being half Haitian and half white I myself am especially a mongrel. I'm part native Caribbean part African and white.
@FirstOccidental @DataDistribute @KWintie the assumed priorities are what's being used as a reason to hold one's race against someone.. You can argue that recessive genes being lost would be a very beneficial thing but I guess it doesn't really matter all that much. I'll concede that argument I have no weight in it.
@DataDistribute @KWintie Also on top of that someone taking to long to do something isn't going to matter if no one else is doing it. that's all I got.
@DataDistribute @KWintie All I'm ever really able to argue against the race-realism is that people mutate for the better mongrels are usually healthier and smarter than anyone of pure ethnic origin and that race isn't a fair thing to hold against anyone.

@RantingF yeah that exchange is fake but that totally happens.
@RantingF I've seen stuff like that happen. its funny and really stupid but it does happen. I've seen it happen both way too.
@RantingF XD this was great thank you
@RantingF non-offensive.
@transwitchlexi wait was their any context leading up to that? Not sure how this was even remoptely offensive. I almost feel like this is sort of a troll.
@JudgingDogma personally I don't think businesses should be able to pick their customers and I think if they kick people out they should have to prove that they're being disorderly in some way.
@JudgingDogma do you have the article you read?
@JudgingDogma I get that but I really don't like the idea that businesses can thought police their staff for things they do and say outside of work.

@RoamingMil the tweet you retweeted I would say is blatantly sexist but I would say have kid scout or just scouts. I don't see why the sexes need to be segregated. I've always found that kind of dumb.

@RantingF @demotimvator The Alt-right in the west is relatively benign. I'm not even remotely concerned. Most of the western alt-righters either don't have the social skill and/or the gall to actually achieve the things that they want. Like.... the over whelming majority of them.
@demotimvator @RantingF a lot of the white working class especially of those in more rural area actually do believe that liberals hate them.
@RantingF thank you. I live in trump country unfortunately. its a breath of fresh air to hear at least you say this.
@cultofdusty Why? Blaire's exactly the kind of person that she wants to be. think of any show that features women arguing that moms sometimes get super glued to. That's the kind of person Blaire clearly enjoys being and I don't think there's much else to her other than the fact she's trans.

@the1janitor Also I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of the alt-right that exists in the western world doesn't have the gall nor a big enough lack of comfort to actually do anything like this. Many of them don't even have the social skills to run for office or do any of these things
@the1janitor The Ukrain, Poland, and Bulgaria are where this has the most attention.
@the1janitor I'm speaking specifically of the alt-right. To my understanding most alt-righters came from /pol/ and the majority of people the use /pol/ are from eastern europe. What's happening in eastern europe? I remember seeing this not too long ago. https://t.co/KCi3Oc5hFE

@RantingF My issues with Hillary were that she's a huge neo-liberal that was going to barely do anything for progressives, and she was such a liar, almost as bad as trump, to the point that I don't know how I'm supposed to expected to believe anything she says.

@Marxism_Wokeism The only time that I can think of that he's actually criticized the right was when trump was talking about censoring out some news.
@Marxism_Wokeism To be fair he did make a bunch of videos in support of Bernie and he does sometimes bring up that he does support parts of Bernie's platforms and that america should do something about its poor, but I see what you mean. He should criticize the right more.
@RantingF That much I had assumed. My profile pic is an actual picture of me. My friends and people I went to school with are pretty used to seeing me but in this area I'm pretty exotic looking though to a lot of people I pass as white just because I'm so light skinned. Half Haitian.

@xeridanus @RantingF That I can agree with for the most part with maybe a very few exceptions. how many people are qualified to do each of these jobs. I'd imagine that becoming a daycare person would be easier than becoming a welder.
@SigRuman @RantingF oh okay
@SigRuman @RantingF CHS?
@xeridanus @RantingF that's a big grey area that has a lot of different ways of interpreting it. I personally think teachers should be paid like doctors but a lot of it is also comparing apples to oranges. Like comparing cosmetology to welding. I'm having a hard time comparing the 2 to be honest.
@RantingF coarse that wouldn't solve the problems with part time jobs that treat their employees like crap. I remember plenty of times where my single father coworker got screwed pretty hard when something happened to him or his kid or when he couldn't find a baby sitter. I had to cover.
@RantingF yeah which I would say is really its own problem, but I'm not sure what can really be done about it though. the only idea I have off the top of my head is just require employers to give their employees a certain amount of paid sick days per year.
@RantingF actually about a month ago I remember getting into a discussion with a woman about how women get pushed out of their jobs when they start a family and she agreed with that, which I found odd and drove me nuts. I think they should be able to keep their wage when they come back.
@RantingF Yeah, I can see that.
@RantingF yeah, that sounds pretty awful. Yeah I think were you are an where I am have some-what different cultures when it comes to this but I'm not sure cause I'm not a parent. My knowledge on this specific part of the issue is extremely limited.
@RantingF I'll also mention that I Live a little over an hour south of buffalo. Just in case that matters some how.
@RantingF Coarse I don't have kids, nor have I ever had a girlfriend, or anything.
@RantingF I've personally never heard that once in my whole life until people started talking about this a lot. where I am fathers taking care of and actually doing stuff with their families is really encouraged at least from what I see. in real life.
@RantingF its fine. I hadn't thought about it either.
@RantingF Oh sorry I didn't think you were gonna respond so quick. I would have said that different.
@RantingF Though I won't say that without also saying that women are usually the one left with the kids. I've only met 2 single fathers in my life. One was a former teacher of mine and the other is one of my current co-workers.
@RantingF Yeah I'm not here to do that, but even what you're just saying here so far, I just don't think the term "pay gap" is the right for it. Child care I would consider a separate problem only because that's a problem inherent to being a parent not so much women
@RantingF Every time I have the pay gap explained to me I never have one described to me. they always describe a discrimination issue, and if that's the case I don't see why they're calling it a pay gab which makes it sound some-what benign, which I think is harmful if anything.

@____u_____u____ @neonfiona Okay but that's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that someone  finding an act morally reprehensible to any serious degree doesn't inherently mean that they're going to do anything about whatever act it is. Most people aren't proactive like that.
@____u_____u____ @neonfiona I didn't even know you were mad.
@____u_____u____ @neonfiona Just because they don't do anything about it doesn't mean that they're okay with it. They don't care because its not their problem, and they want nothing to do with it.

@____u_____u____ @neonfiona Its not that they don't find what they're doing wrong. Its that they don't care about you. In many places you can sometimes find that being in the middle of public is the falsest sense of security that you could ever come to know, because no one cares.
@____u_____u____ @neonfiona That doesn't make any sense.

@cultofdusty Eh the only reason I hate twitter is because there's a character limit at all. Just never feel like I can tweet an entire thought when I need to, like during a debate or pointing out someone's flaw, dishonesty, intellectual or otherwise. I did here but half the time I can't.
@Veeh_Ro @MillennialWoes Lol XD
@cultofdusty Eh I think this is super subjective, and the reason that some people change their minds on something is because people of a particular ideological position are nice to them where people they had felt they "should" agree with aren't.

@OmniDestiny anything in particular you had in mind?
@CaesarNero1 @benshapiro well yeah because they're guilty of doing many of the things that they say that they're against. they got caught eating the forbidden fruits in the garden of eden.
@CaesarNero1 @benshapiro yeah but that's really intellectually dishonest. that doesn't inherently mean that either group's issues are invalid.

@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa If you respond to this thank you for your time The article I'm talking about in case you don't remember
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa So I don't know how the ICCUP worked at all, along with that ladder system.
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa I never played Broodwar. I've only been playing SC2 sense august of 2014 and got to diamond in HOTS.
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa I hate the way Ladder works in HOTS. You get promoted and you're instantly at the top of the league.
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa Promotions and demotions would happen the instant your MMR got to relative plat or gold diamond etc.
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa what if there were a larger variety of leagues but is was purely MMR based and changed less dramtically
@LiquidTLO @LiquidSnute @Liquid_MaNa I read that article. I had an idea that I came up with a few months ago and wanted your opinion.
