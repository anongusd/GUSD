@xsshabooh @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Sorry dude Serena just dropped a bomb at the press conference saying otherwise and I agree.
Serena just drops a bomb at the press conference on the fact that double standards exists in sports and she will keep fighting for women athletes. Love that! #SerenaWillians
@raulifr @idamaepeep @HappyInStars @L1terofCola @inSanelyRapid @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Yah you did. Love Serena or not that is not the point. The umpire went to far with his ego and implicit bias. Double standards for Serena but not others.
@xsshabooh @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Ridiculous behavior? Yah right. Don‚Äôt come at this like ‚Äúoh a woman needs to be quiet and take abuse from a horrible umpire‚Äù stop with the sexist double standards shit!
@DODGERFAN1966 @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Bullshit! Don‚Äôt even try to say that when you should know the game got rigged.
@raulifr @idamaepeep @HappyInStars @L1terofCola @inSanelyRapid @usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ Sounds like you are saying women athletes need to be all proper, never show emotion or get in an argument with an official. Now that‚Äôs sexist!
