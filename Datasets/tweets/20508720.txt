@Bruntonj8Jeff @davidfrum Yes. I feel like Dems could have drawn that out better, especially since Rs showed zero interest in trying to combat such serious allegations and stuck only to right wing media chum. I got into that a bit here: https://t.co/nUUzOyXPZm
Key point in here:		Politico recently reported that Meadows and Jordan have been rewarded for their nonstop crazy about Mueller. Trump dubbed them "warriors." They're now right wing media stars.		This shows how the closed information feedback loop can work against the GOP cause: https://t.co/l0M6Fe6ThI

Cohen says he will hand over to Congress 11 checks reimbursing him for the illegal hush money payments, all from Trump himself or an account Trump controls.		So, again, efforts to drag Cohen's credibility are beside the point.		Either those checks exist, or they don't.

Key takeaways from Cohen's testimony:		* Trump had illicit help getting elected president in not one, but two, ways		* Trump continued carrying out a criminal conspiracy while in office		* Trump covers his tracks with mob boss language		My new piece:		https://t.co/9685ApwbEO
@benjaminwittes We should all be able to say that an implicit command from boss to subordinate = direction. This shouldn't be controversial.
@rickhasen @bmaz Buzzfeed reported that Trump "directed" Cohen to lie to Congress. The explicit command part of the Buzzfeed story refers to general lying, not just to Congress.
@rickhasen @bmaz The SCO denial is vague, and leaves plenty of room for "directed" to mean "implicit command"
@bmaz @rickhasen "directed" comfortably fits in with the spirit of what Cohen claims, which is that what transpired was an implicit command from boss to subordinate.

@Bruntonj8Jeff @davidfrum Fair. A bit later in the testimony Cohen suggests that Trump tacitly directed him to lie more generally to the public about the Moscow project, which Cohen seems to have taken as his directive to lie to Congress. Not sure what that means in legal terms

@ReallyAwakenNow Yeah, sure. That's why Trump claimed that Republicans were going to win the House. Or has that been made to disappear inside the bubble as well?
@ReallyAwakenNow Fortunately they won far more House seats than Republicans did (yes, I know, the cult has decreed that this never happened)
@wisdomfromage good thing that so many of you voted Democratic in 2018 (yes, I know, the cult leaders have ordered you to pretend this election never happened)
It's terrible to see dynamic Democrats like @gretchenwhitmer feeding the frame that Democrats have to choose between racial issues/immigration and "kitchen table" issues.		That is a totally false choice. It is *not an option* to do one and not the other:		https://t.co/G0MwjV86cf

@GodandtheBear Not clear how agreeing voluntarily not to use stolen materials constitutes an infringement on free speech but carry on
@GodlessLib_CB @jeffspross @JamesSurowiecki Yes, that's why I said above that they could have done more *and* that probably wouldn't have mattered in 2010
@jeffspross @JamesSurowiecki Look, this is all a counterfactual, so who knows. Still, your account needs to account for why the structural fact of super-energized outparty wouldn't have mattered if, say, stimulus had been bigger
@jeffspross @JamesSurowiecki Sorry, *out party
@jeffspross @JamesSurowiecki Polarization and neg partisanship of this era scrambles equation. Out oarty is more energized -- this is just a structural fact. Thus Dems won House in 2018 despite relatively good economy.
@jeffspross @JamesSurowiecki I think it's fair to argue that Dems *should* have done a lot more, but I also think Rs would have taken House anyway
@drvox @jtlevy Jacob is also pretty far from a conventional right leaning libertarian
It's fascinating just how deeply committed the Trump cult propaganda machine is to the imperative of making the 2018 election (in which suburban women ran screaming from the GOP after Trump made it all about him and his wall) disappear. https://t.co/dnaTplJV0i
@MelissaRyan Yup, exactly
I should caveat this tweet. A lot would depend on how this pledge were drawn up. There might be ways that would be unworkable or undesirable. So we'd have to see what it looks like in the specifics.
This is a perfectly legitimate and accurate framing of the situation, and all the no-collusion dead-enders will help Trump spin any lack of criminal charges as proof that there was no wrongdoing whatsoever. And we can't let that happen. https://t.co/MgO4uJCXEJ
@fernandez2126 The guy who responded to you is correct, but in addition to that, the point is not to use stolen materials *and also* not to engage in disinformation tactics such as bots, trolls, etc.
@ggreenwald I agree it raises thorny questions. But I see nothing wrong with pledging to, say, not using illicitly hacked information that was delivered to one particular candidate.
@Jafpro_16 Because following the right over the cliff into procedural nihilism will really do wonders for our politics and democracy. Great idea.
@ggreenwald Good. You'll note that I'm pushing the Dem candidates on this matter.
@ggreenwald I think it's complex. I'd lean toward supporting media's use of materials if they deem them genuinely newsworthy.		One problem I acknowledge here is that, if media were to widely report them, there'd come a point at which it would be hard for candidates to avoid discussing them.
@ggreenwald But, since I've now got your attention on this, do you agree with the other suggestions -- Dems committing to not abusing war powers, and supporting tightening up discretion to declare national emergencies?
@ggreenwald I think it's more complicated when it comes to media, for all kinds of reasons. But I'd be for the candidates refraining from using that information if it were obtained illicitly, yes.
Joe Biden is calling on all 2020 Dems to join a pledge to refrain from use of hacked materials and other disinformation tactics in the campaign.		All Dems should sign on. And they can do other things as well to adopt a pro-democracy, anti-Trumpism agenda:		https://t.co/QDWfSxl1WF

@beyerstein I'm baffled at the outrage that is directed specifically at her tone. I could have made that clearer in the first tweet, but I thought I spelled that out throughout. Do you agree w the other arguments in the thread (which I'd argue are more important)?
@beyerstein I'd argue that your initial response to my thread was unfair in light of the full set of arguments it made 2/2
@beyerstein No, I'm saying the outrage that's specifically directed at her dismissive conduct is overblown, given the *totality* of her conduct. I have no problem with the criticism of her on the substance 1/
@beyerstein I think the outrage at her conduct is overblown, given the totality of it, and that we should be focused on the real problems in her argument. I thought I spelled that out, but perhaps I didn't effectively communicate it
@beyerstein That's exactly what I argued. And your response -- to point to the depth of the problem -- is puzzling, since multiple tweets in the thread point to the fact that the kids were effective in highlighting that very thing, which actually applauded.
@MilesGrant hilarious bad faith lying from you, congrats, it's cool that you're able to do that
@beyerstein Did you read the thread? Are you seriously playing this game?
@GodLovesUgly22 I literally disagreed with her on precisely the point you do: I think she's wrong to place her faith in consensus. The thread says this in multiple ways.

@JustSchmeltzer @MEPFuller @noboa Well, I sure hope that Matt notes that we are saying that there *are* problems with DiFi's performance, just that we should focus on the real ones
@OFFISHTHOMASK I thought I spelled out in the thread what I thought the longer video demonstrates, and I don't even remotely view it as all exculpatory. As I wrote, there *are* problems with what she did, but the outrage strikes me as overblown

@DavidAstinWalsh Thanks, but I'm not a Very Serious Person
@JScullyClemmons I tried to spell out in my thread that I thought that at times, she was actually listening and seemed open to their arguments.
@JScullyClemmons I think it's permissible as long as there is also nuance, which I tried to supply, and which you do not seem willing to acknowledge, as evidenced by this tweet from you.
@JScullyClemmons And it's absurd and overblown.
9) Bottom line: People are angry at Feinstein because she disagrees with the GND's goals and with the theory of change animating it. 		Fine: This is the argument we need to be having. The edited clip does disservice to what's actually useful/illuminating about this episode. FIN
8) While Feinstein was dismissive at times, on balance she listened to the kids. She even seemed to acknowledge some of their larger points, particularly about the irresponsibility of the political class' inaction, given the enormous stakes on the line for the kids' future.
7) Also, crucially, the problem with Feinstein's "realism" is that it lets GOP climate denialism place limits on our political imagination.		This is crazy, given that it is its own form of deep delusion, and is far less "realistic" than the animating GND goals and values are.
6) On this, too, I think Feinstein is wrong to say this ends the conversation. But here again, the kids got the key responses across effectively: 		They pointed out that articulating ambitious visions of a far better world inspires people, &amp; that this itself can be good politics.
5) At bottom this episode also showcased a deeper dispute over theories of change. 		Feinstein simply doesn't see the utility of pushing large, aspirational policies if they can't pass the Senate. That's her view. She's consensus minded.
4) But the kids got the key responses to this across very effectively: 		That the costs of inaction are greater, and that political elites often don't acknowledge that "we can't afford it" disguises hidden priorities that often aren't acknowledged, and should be acknowledged.
3) I think Feinstein was too dismissive of the GND. 		It's not okay to simply say, "we can't afford it," as if that ends the conversation.
2) Feinstein shouldn't have hinted that the fact that the kids are too young to vote has significance. 		They and their parents were engaging in political advocacy, and they were doing so effectively.
1) I watched the whole Dianne Feinstein video, and I have to say, I'm baffled by the outrage.		I say this episode was a good thing.		Yes, she was at times cantankerous and a bit dismissive of the legitimate political aspirations of these children and their parents.		*THREAD*

@jadler1969 @painter_nancy @joshchafetz @dandrezner Agreed on all counts! Also very robust oversight on Trump's immigration agenda and on his claims justifying the emergency
@jadler1969 @painter_nancy @joshchafetz @dandrezner My preference is for the resolution route.
@painter_nancy @joshchafetz @jadler1969 @dandrezner All this says is that they didn't insert language into the budget deal precluding a national emergency, which would have been nutty. It doesn't mean she can't go to court and/or pass resolution terminating.
@joshchafetz @painter_nancy @jadler1969 @dandrezner It's wrong.
@jadler1969 @dandrezner @joshchafetz I wrote a whole piece on this just last week, and have done piece after piece on the need for Dems to exercise oversight: https://t.co/eLCdzNA0tl
@jadler1969 @dandrezner @joshchafetz I know that -- the piece is about how the NEA created this discretion (yes, this is only a part of the story, but it's an important part)
@jadler1969 @dandrezner @joshchafetz My point is that a court victory for Trump, even if valid, highlights the degree to which Congress has made it possible for this extraordinary level of bad-faith abuse of the discretion Congress gave the president (though in fairness who could have anticipated Trump)
@dandrezner @joshchafetz Also, you are absolutely right! There is no discounting the possibility that Trump wins in court and wins reelection.
@dandrezner @joshchafetz In fact, I did a whole piece warning of the dangers of a court victory for Trump. It would mean presidential bad faith no longer matters, that there is literally no limit to Trump's discretion to claim national emergencies on completely false pretenses: https://t.co/IfqeQINUcY
@dandrezner @joshchafetz I'm not saying Trump will lose on either of those fronts. I'm agreeing with you that those are real dangers. I'm making an *additional* point by saying, "let's not help Trump reset the political debate in his favor."
@dandrezner @joshchafetz I agree with you on those points. I'm just saying that we need to *also* take care to avoid letting him reset the terms of the debate. I think this matters, too. After all, reporting has confirmed that he plans to stake his reelection on this resetting/redefinition.
@joshchafetz @dandrezner Right, and don't forget the lawsuits from landowners, which will further delay it, and also the bureaucratic constraints, which mean he's going to get *at best* marginally more of the same fencing we've been building for a decade: https://t.co/YFh7VECnjp
@dandrezner @csilberman70 IOW, even if he does win in court, what he'd end up building has *already* been dramatically constrained by Republicans in Congress and by the realities of what the bureaucracy actually wants, to the point where the end result will have little in common with his campaign promise.
@dandrezner @csilberman70 I agree with you on those points. I also don't think we should let Trump redefine "a smattering of the bollard fencing that has been built for years under previous presidents in a few more targeted areas" as "getting his way." This is the smoke-and-mirrors his campaign is trying.
@dandrezner @csilberman70 I would contest the idea that he's going to get his way. Even if he wins in court, it will take years, and it's not even clear what the physical result will be: https://t.co/YFh7VETYHZ

@neeratanden Right, which is why this whole debate is utterly unresolvable and useless until we know what the eventual Dem nominee stands for
@neeratanden I guess I'm skeptical that this is why Gillum and O'Rourke lost, but we do also know that Rs worked very hard to stain dozens of House Dem candidates with AOC socialism and that did fail
@jonathanchait ...it occurs to me this does raise an interesting question. The political science does tell us that a perception that a candidate is ideologically out of the mainstream can matter. (cc @jbview) I wonder whether rising polarization/neg partisanship alters this fundamental.
@jonathanchait I think it's too early to say, but I would not rule out the possibility that you will turn out to be right. I do concede that my starting point is skepticism that this will end up mattering much or that if the Dem does lose this would be why.
@jonathanchait Whether that will actually become true this time does remain to be seen, as you say, but it seems to me the history dictates we should presume the confidence to be feigned, and the leaks done for purposes other than to inform the world of their actual strategic calculations. 2/2
@jonathanchait Fair. On the other hand, the very nature of the grift on display here dictates that Rs will always say that *this time* the charge *really will* work, because *this time* the Dem *really is* a socialist. 1/
@MarcACaputo @armandodkos That's very interesting. Worth a piece, say I!
@jonathanchait Sure, but it remains to be seen what that embrace will really look like in substance, and if the Dem does lose in 2020, I doubt the intellectual activity on the left -- or the GOP characterization of it as a drift towards "Venezuela" -- will be a leading reason for it.
@MarcACaputo @armandodkos Of course they aren't. It's nonsense, and we are not obliged to pretend otherwise.
@armandodkos I mean, it's possible people around Trump put this out there to make him happy. I don't really see a problem w/Axios reporting on it, I'd just like an acknowledgment that this has already been tested and failed
@armandodkos It would surprise me if anyone around Trump actually believed this

@OsitaNwanevu @whstancil Right, I agree that there's no getting around the fact that this is just about getting Trump's taxes. The core legal Q would be whether the committee needs a good faith reason to request them. It might not need one
@whstancil @OsitaNwanevu As far as I can tell, the core legal question would be whether the committee needs any kind of good faith rationale to make the request. As you say, it might not
@whstancil @OsitaNwanevu Right, I think that's plausible, and it seems likely the admin would lose, but the issue is that this is uncharted territory, so Ds appear worried that if the request does not have a firm rationale, the courts could surprise them

Let's be clear on the real message Trump sent with his speech.		From Nancy Pelosi and the new Democratic House, Trump is demanding nothing less than total capitulation.		He will continue to proceed as if the last election never happened.		My new piece:		https://t.co/x1FKwGklJr
This is a flatly false depiction of what happened.		In reality, Trump agreed to reopen the government after Dems said No to his hostage taking.		Republicans demanded that Trump capitulate and give them a shot at negotiating the real compromise that Trump refuses to consider. https://t.co/4zlYKqPfzj

"America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants -- not walls."		Great to see @staceyabrams indicting the cruelty, depravity and sheer folly of Trump's immigration agenda in clear, simple, vivid terms.
Also worth remembering that Republicans widely ran on this lie in 2018 and got wiped out in the House anyway: https://t.co/rXv5fNRIxb
Trump's absurd demagoguery about homegrown socialism sounds awfully neo-McCarthyite, amirite?
The fact that there are now so many women in Congress is one of the few things in this speech that Trump actually can legitimately take credit for.
Trump just claimed to want "humanitarian assistance" to deal with the migrant crisis.		AGAIN, Democrats have put $500 million on the table for precisely that purpose. Trump is holding that hostage for his wall:		https://t.co/cThdq7Wlxi https://t.co/2SRHt9jbmb
@AlexConant @jonathanvswan Trying to cut legal immigration in half, limiting ways to apply for asylum, and slashing refugee flows is an interesting way to ensure that as many immigrants as possible come in legally.
As you watch Republicans roar with approval at Trump's demagoguery, remember that behind the scenes, those same Republicans are frantically trying to figure out what Trump will accept as part of a border deal, because none of them know.
Do not fall for Trump's fake distinction between "legislation" and "investigation."		Democrats were elected to provide a check on Trump. Investigating his corruption, abuses and full blown policy fiascos *is* good governing.

If anything, the media is snowed *too often* into treating bad-faith Republican attacks as genuine good faith arguments.		This is just more of the same phony ref-working. You feigning a great deal of conviction about this does not oblige anyone to pretend it's anything else. https://t.co/N3xkf2vNKo
@daveweigel Shorter @baseballcrank: When the press declines to uncritically amplify bad-faith Republican attacks on Democrats, it reveals its bias against us
In his interview with the NYT, Trump said that aside from his wall, everything being negotiated in conference is a "waste of money."		Again, Dems have offered Trump $500 million to address the humanitarian side of the crisis he keeps tweeting about.		Is that a "waste of money"? https://t.co/9quQ0gbSik

@LPDonovan @jonathanchait I think Dems would accept that, current "non wall" rhetoric notwithstanding, because this is already being built, and it would be less than Trump asked for (but more than their original offer). Q is whether Trump would (a) accept middle ground sum; and (b) call it a wall. 2/2
@LPDonovan @jonathanchait This debate is a mess. There's an easy way to a compromise: Dems get humanitarian money plus an end to efforts to restrict asylum. Trump/GOP gets more than $1.3 billion but less than $5.7 billion in border money, including for some of the type of fencing currently being built. 1/
@LPDonovan @jonathanchait It's in the $1.3 billion that they offered throughout the last quarter of 2018 -- that would have continued last year's expenditure, which contained fencing (that's exactly why fencing is being built right now).		it's not in current offer that's on the table in conference talks
@LPDonovan @jonathanchait There is no "sudden" Dem rhetorical nuance. They have already offered funding for fencing, in the $1.3 billion they offered. They provided it in last year's expenditure, too. That's why fencing is being built right at this very moment.

@ZaxxonGalaxian @asking_honestly @NoahCRothman I would let in more unskilled workers and broaden qualifications for asylum. Separately, what I'm talking about here is that one can advocate for real border security and more legal immigration at the same time.

Thread: https://t.co/r9tpVr4EsV
@asking_honestly @NoahCRothman That would be a dumb question, because the way to let in more people, which I support, is to make more immigration *legal,* not to allow more illegal immigration. Nothing wrong w/ supporting things that prevent people from undertaking dangerous crossings or block illegal drugs.

"Given how deeply Trump’s image of his own success is tied up in the economy’s performance, we now have to hope that Trump’s ego takes on so much water from worsening economic indicators that it overrides the investment his ego has in the wall. Yes, we’ve really come to this." https://t.co/mpun2n8mte
@yeselson @baseballcrank Every time they play this cynical bad faith game, which doesn't have the slightest shred of intellectual honesty or sincerity to it, the real result is that it only makes it clearer that the sole option is for Democrats to say, "no, this will not be rewarded."
@yeselson @baseballcrank Conservatives always pretend not to understand what Republicans are doing in these situations. It's kind of amazing. One side is asking for concessions in exchange for doing what he himself says he wants to do (Trump says he wants the government open) and the other is not.
It now appears that cynical anti-government and anti-immigrant advisers (Mulvaney and Miller) are conspiring to convince Trump that he’s the one with all the leverage and is on the cusp of winning a glorious victory. 		That's what new reporting indicates:		https://t.co/sgcwI0RwI3

@ImNotOwned @OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias Well, if that's the case, then the objections do seem unreasonable. But I thought the discussions were about something that theoretically might (or might not) happen in the future.
@OsitaNwanevu @deanleyland @mattyglesias Yes, that's a fair point. I got the sense that the discussion was more about whether she'd take this to swing districts in the future, which as you say is something worth debating.
@deanleyland @OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias No, they don't necessarily. That's the whole point.
@OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias I mean, it's not clear to me that a debate over whether primarying Dems in tougher districts is a bad thing to debate. But regardless, even if that is objectionable, it's still a far cry from the implication that people want to squelch content/form of her progressive advocacy.
@ACGuerrilla @OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias Right, that too. Actual sentiments are less "bad establishment wants to squelch progressive" and more, "we need to harness the forces she's successfully tapped in a way that benefits us more, and we should debate how to do that." Which seems like a perfectly fine debate to have!
@OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias I dunno, it sounded more to me like the tone was, "she's a rock star who is having a positive impact on the debate and showing us how to use social media effectively, but sometimes it can go too far." Which is not nearly as bad as what the headline implies re "reining her in"
@OsitaNwanevu @mattyglesias The sentiments in that piece also do not really support the headline, which was written to bait people like us to tweet about it.

@Jdhughes099 @davidfrum Interesting. Maybe the way to think about it is that this weakness that Trump is exploiting through unprecedented bad faith requires at least some bad faith on the part of those who are supposed to function at least partly as constraints (SCOTUS, GOP Congress)
3) And in this latter scenario, Trump will have gotten *most,* but not *all,* of what he claims he wants: Border security money + reopening government, both of which he says he wants to see happen.
2) By contrast, if Trump agrees to what Dems want (border security + reopening govt), he will have given up *nothing whatsoever* in concessions.		All he'll be giving up is his ability to use govt shutdown &amp; pain it's causing as leverage to get his way. That's not a concession.
1) If Democrats agree to what Trump wants, they will have made massive unilateral concessions (the wall) in exchange for Trump doing what *he himself* says he wants to do, i.e., reopening the government.
We are not in the midst of a conventional negotiation, in which each side is offering concessions in exchange for concessions from the other side. 		Here's the basic asymmetry, as clearly as I can explain it:
@bdquinn @charlescwcooke @NWADoug @robbysoave Right. There's been some good journalism and sociological fieldwork that has shown that the spike in engagement is directly rooted in a belief that Trump's election was an extraordinary event that indicates deep systemic problems.
@bdquinn @charlescwcooke @NWADoug @robbysoave There is some support in the political science literature for this view
Mueller sought information from Trump's campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio, CNN reports.		Not clear info was Trump-campaign related. 		But: "Fabrizio is intriguing b/c he's one of few people in Manafort orbit with knowledge of inner-workings of campaign."		https://t.co/vLVKa4DMeR
@Jdhughes099 @davidfrum I agree. The point I tried to raise in the piece is whether Trump has found a weakness in the system. In both travel ban and nat'l emergency case, Trump's bad faith abuses the legitimate reasons for granting president discretion. Policing this is hard, which he's also abusing.
@Jdhughes099 @davidfrum I'm not sure about that...it is legitimately difficult and complex, because there are good reasons to give the president so much discretion. The problem arises when that discretion is abused to such an extraordinary degree

Yep, @maddow has the right take: Dems successfully established the Dem Party position as for reopening the government, for relieving the suffering that the shutdown has caused, and for a rational, non-insane, non-demagogic approach to the complex challenges the border presents.
"The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They're a humanitarian challenge."		-- Nancy Pelosi
Great job, networks. You are complicit in amplifying this absurd display of destructive disinformation &amp; demagoguery. You knew this was coming, but acquiesced because Trump spent two years trying to destroy your profession's institutional role, perversely rewarding him for this.
Understand: Trump could have much of what he's now asking for -- more agents, more border security money, more money for bed space and for facilities for migrant families -- if he dropped the megalomaniacal demand for the wall, which is *not* actually about border security.
Finally, the anonymous quotes from White House aides and officials are simply incredible. These people say flat out that the wall wouldn't solve the problem as Trump has articulated it, and even admit that it's about symbolism for his core voters:		https://t.co/ssBhzR9rS6 https://t.co/S9c2xRKUb1
Third, the briefing that the White House gave to members of Congress, ostensibly to *inform* them so they could make good policy choices, was full of falsehoods and absurdities. This leaves no doubt about the depths of bad faith here: 		https://t.co/ssBhzR9rS6 https://t.co/dueJ23SiTY

@DefuscoDave I don't think we should define Trump winning as "persuading his base." Trump made this argument central in the midterms and suffered a historic wipeout. Now polls show Americans blame him for shutdown and don't want wall. So yeah, he's losing.

@TamarGranor @AdamSerwer Indeed! Thanks
@TamarGranor @AdamSerwer Also, Trump's pathologies/bond with his base have locked him into this stance. I have a piece about evangelical white support for the wall as a totem symbolizing defense of Christian nationalism that I hope explains this and supports @AdamSerwer's thesis: https://t.co/mmSV36vHO0
@TamarGranor @AdamSerwer TBC, these aren't mutually exclusive. My view is the cruelty is geared towards both goals. It thrills those who want the suffering inflicted and it's *also* meant to result in fewer immigrants in the US (which Trump/Miller also want), by discouraging people from trying to enter.
@TamarGranor @AdamSerwer This is a bit different from what Adam argued. The idea here is that the cruelty has a *purpose,* ie, deterring asylum seekers. Adam's point is the cruelty is itself the end goal. My argument is that the cruelty is failing to accomplish what admin says it's meant to accomplish.
As I keep tediously repeating, this sort of thing is exactly what Dems need to exercise oversight on.		The incoming chair of the committee that has jurisdiction over Homeland Security has laid out what this oversight will likely look like:		https://t.co/Y7XZMrqXv8

@LizMair @portraitinflesh Hmmm. I'd argue that the priorities of the GOP economic agenda, as reflected by Romney's candidacy, might have helped propel GOP voters to Trump. Indeed, Trump campaigned against those very priorities en route to winning the nomination, vanquishing candidates who stood for them.
@LizMair Even if Warren is as you describe her, Walker's characterization is still dishonest. Sorry, not going to pretend otherwise just because Republicans are accustomed to having this nonsense taken seriously.
@LizMair Also true, but he campaigned on rolling back the ACA. And are you seriously contesting the idea that Romney's policies were tilted toward the wealthy?
@LizMair Right, I didn't play along with his dishonest characterization of Warren's positions.
@LizMair True, McCain was not Romney. But Obama beat Romney, too!

@jenniferathomec interesting idea!
One clarification on this: In such a scenario, Dems would press administration scientists to publicly comment on the long term effects of Trump's *policies* rolling back climate/enviro regulations, which are fueled by his climate denialism: https://t.co/GVnKnYwDTu
@jenniferathomec But in this scenario, those scientists would be responding also to the deregulatory *policies* that Trump is putting in place.
By the way, if House Dems move toward restoring facts/empiricism to governing, a good place for this is on climate change.		For instance, hearings could publicly press the scientists behind the administration's dire climate change report to respond to Trump's climate denialism: https://t.co/A5YnmCFs6N

@danpfeiffer @jonfavs @ezraklein I wonder if there's a way to do this that's more healthy (for small-d democracy), one that doesn't treat "MSM" as a foil, the way right wing media did to silo off conservative audiences, and instead reaffirms public faith in quality journalism while developing separate channels
@jonfavs @ezraklein @danpfeiffer Thanks. That is a really interesting point/dynamic.		Supporting your overall point, it's overwhelmingly clear that the reason Rs fear DC media disapproval less is because they have their own separate conversation going on with their voters outside of those channels.
@jonfavs @ezraklein @danpfeiffer Can I ask, if that were accomplished, would the effect of this ideally be that Dems feel less constrained by centrist media elite disapproval, thus mitigating the asymmetry I'm talking about here?

@samwandmaster @raulita GOP Senate has already proven it's willing to pass funding w/o wall money. GOP House would not. 		In Jan, Dems control House, pass something immediately reopening gov, challenge GOP Senate and Trump to oppose it.

@willwilkinson @kdrum Yep. Well said.
@willwilkinson @kdrum This is actually a big breakthrough, and one thing that makes the Niskanen blueprint important, I think. Much GOP orthodoxy does not concede that initial point. It only treats "re" distribution as a departure from a supposedly natural pre-tax distribution, which makes it "bad"
@willwilkinson @kdrum (I would add that for theorists like Rawls and Dworkin, the outcome isn't what is either just or unjust; the background conditions are what must be scrutinized.)
@willwilkinson @kdrum But you do accept that pretax distributions are in part socially determined, that they can dramatically curtail human freedom/flourishing through no fault of the person in question, &amp; that this must be addressed to place capitalism/private property on a legitimate foundation, no?
The connecting thread between today's Mike Flynn drama and Trump's charity closing is that Trump's fortress of corruption is cracking on multiple fronts.		New from @paulwaldman1 and me:		https://t.co/yEqWvjxGpV
@willwilkinson @kdrum ...but you guys also treat as foundational the idea that unjust distributions can themselves limit human freedom, and that they are a social product, and thus must be corrected
@willwilkinson @kdrum Right. Incremental improvements in service of human freedom are good!
I feel like this point isn't getting through.

This is the right context. Dems just won the largest raw vote midterm margin in history, after polls showed large majorities wanted a check on Trump.

@RyanJSuto @DouthatNYT I can *kind of* see your point, at least in regards to how the WASP establishment might have remade itself
@DouthatNYT Fixing typo: "better intentioned"
@ThomasKaempfen @DouthatNYT I responded to that later in the thread.
@RyanJSuto @DouthatNYT Right, I deal with that later in the thread, please read through!
@DouthatNYT Today's elite is more the product of distributive failure on social resources. A failure of politics. Yes, systemic racism, too. But the better elites are more self-critical on both (though not doing enough) and aren’t as smugly comfortable w/their status as Douthat suggests. 6/6
@DouthatNYT Today’s multiculturalists &amp; cosmopolitans might at times be “shallow,” but generally they *are* more enlightened than early-mid 20th century racial nationalists, even bette intentioned ones. National origin quotas/racial hierarchies: Bad. Inclusive multiracial democracy: Good! 5/
@DouthatNYT Today's meritocratic elites generally speaking often have more moral rectitude than Douthat gives them credit for. They are often committed to public service and visions (agree or not) of a better world, and in key ways don’t compare badly to nostalgized previous generations. 4/
@DouthatNYT Some current elites are better than others. Obama (a product of meritocracy, not entrenched privilege) represents a far better elite than W. or Trump (both of whom *are* products of entrenched privilege in different ways). Lumping them into one "feckless" category won't do. 3/
@DouthatNYT Today’s “elite” (there isn’t just one, but still) just isn’t a product of entrenched privilege to nearly the same degree. 		This, and the fact that it’s much more open to women and people of color, are goods that are not dimmed by whatever failures you might ascribe to it. 2/
.@douthatnyt isn’t nostalgic for the old WASP elite’s *whiteness,* he’s nostalgic over its willingness to admit to being an elite, unlike (he says) today’s, which does not.		So people are misstating his argument. But I want to quibble a bit with his actual account. 1/

6) The larger story here: It is inescapably true that Republicans have been far more willing to engage in this type of destructive procedural warfare than Dems have. 		The best political science designates this as “asymmetric constitutional hardball”		https://t.co/XmFyh4DIxf https://t.co/DwGjisVgFl
5) We don’t know what will happen with NC mess. But meanwhile, serious power grabs are underway in WI and MI, where Rs are moving to strip powers of incoming Dem governors -- *after* they were elected. 		In WI, this overlaps w/new restrictions on voting:		https://t.co/Eil78fL9F4 https://t.co/JL0ftRIp5L
4) But the voter fraud cited to justify such schemes is itself a fraud. 		My book runs through some of the research bearing this out. Voter fraud is akin to deaths by lightning strike:		https://t.co/XmFyh4DIxf https://t.co/IXsSaOhJSI
3) As it happens, North Carolina is one of the states where Republicans attempted one of their most brazen voter suppression schemes.		In my book, I recount some of these capers. The NC version is amazing in its naked targeting of black voters:		https://t.co/XmFyh4DIxf https://t.co/ZeWBxNxQ8K
2) We are not hearing much from national Republicans about this sordid North Carolina tale.		This is odd, isn't it? After all, Republicans love to scream about fraud in elections -- when they’re using it to justify voter suppression.
1) An extraordinary story is unfolding in North Carolina, where the campaign operative for a GOP House candidate is being investigated for election fraud.		Meanwhile, GOP power grabs are underway in other states.		The larger context linking these stories is important.		*THREAD*

@mmfa @JuddLegum 10) A Dem strategist said something recently that is still nagging at me:		“Trump is carrying on a conversation with his voters under the radar that we just don’t understand. Democrats are not carrying on this same kind of conversation with their voters.”		Worth thinking about.
@mmfa 9) Fox News has been absolutely plastered with similar hysteria-fomenting imagery of the migrants for weeks. 		Sinclair and Fox News together reach a whole lot of people. It would be useful to know how many. 		As @JuddLegum says:		https://t.co/gOMoKRoZgN
8) According to @mmfa, the migrant segment will run on over 100 local stations as part of its “must run” series. 		Sinclair has broadcast similar agitprop defenses of Trump amid the child separations and after Charlottesville white supremacist violence:		https://t.co/sjH0diovU2 https://t.co/VxnGdDkkkk
7) The attacks on the independent press aren’t working too well on the American mainstream, thankfully. 		Majorities of overall Americans trust the news media, not Trump, to tell them the truth. 		But *huge* majorities of Republicans trust Trump:		https://t.co/pwUhCt5HRc https://t.co/PNWqbfoqxg
6) The decline in confidence in the news media is real. But it’s mostly a phenomenon among *Republicans.* 		And under Trump, this is at a new high.		My book offers polling data confirming this:		https://t.co/pwUhCt5HRc https://t.co/gmlylhvple
5) The larger context is important. This isn’t conservative opinion. It's *disinformation.*		During 2016, Sinclair played a big role attacking “fake news” on Trump’s behalf.		I recount this story in my book, in a chapter on the "pro-Trump media machine":		https://t.co/pwUhCt5HRc https://t.co/wceA6fH4SL
4) If anything, *Trump* has undermined the rule of law, by sending in the military to bolster GOP campaign propaganda -- an extraordinary act of official misconduct. 		Sinclair is lending air cover to this campaign and flirts with endorsing violence against asylum-seekers.
3) This is nonsense. The rule of law dictates that migrants have the legal right to apply for asylum, not that they represent a breach or an infestation (a word Trump loves) or an “invasion.” 		The segment smoke-screens this central fact with chaotic, frightful imagery.
2) The segment is classic agitprop. It whips up hysteria about a crisis that has “greatly escalated,” and bashes “the left” for undermining the military and refusing to “abide by the rule of law:		https://t.co/5IYDRHOkU8
1) This is extraordinary.		Sinclair is now reportedly requiring dozens of local stations to air a segment that defends the tear-gassing of migrants and describes them as an “invasion of our country.”		I’m not sure we’ve figured out how to conceptualize this adequately.		*THREAD*

@chrislhayes Right, I think this is probably true (though I wonder if a Dem House might be able to shift this if Trump gets desperate enough). I'm just talking theoretically here
@Politics_NYY @chrislhayes Well, yes, there is that. A much worse deal for Dems along these lines was already offered to Trump and he rejected it!
@chrislhayes Not quite sure about this. One can envision limited funding for border security that gives Trump a way to claim a fake victory on the wall in exchange for legalizing one million DREAMers being a non-terrible outcome.
On GM layoffs, remember:		1) Trump has repeatedly boasted that his browbeating of companies saved jobs.		2) Trump vowed his tax cut would spur investments in workers.		Now the browbeating might fail, even as he's all in on trickle down. A double whammy:		https://t.co/ptc74Zp03J

Useful thread: https://t.co/eSDmnZHqor
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick It isn't. My first impulse is often to think she's been misquoted or mischaracterized.
@SueSmith587 @TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick I want a transcript of the Guardian interview, not the speech
@tina_herod @seanbhoyer @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick I saw that and agree -- good but insufficient, b/c she told Guardian that the liberal democracies can legitimately say they've done enough &amp; *suggested* migrants are to blame for right wing populism (I don't think she believes that, which is why I hoped for clearer clarification)
@rickyofkokiri @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick I agree with this! That was the spirit of my original claim. I'm pointing out that I have often defended her against media criticism, which often is extremely unfair and even made up.
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick You know I've defended her over the years!
@Jpete008 @BioTurboNick ...and I apologize for the tone of my response
@seanbhoyer @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick to be clear, I actually think it might mitigate the comments! I don't get why they haven't released one
@Jpete008 @BioTurboNick Look, I agree criticism of her is often reflexive and deeply unfair. Please don't take my tweet to mean I dismiss that idea. I don't at all. I just don't think that unfortunate fact should lead us to refrain when she really should be pressed for further clarification, you know?
@seanbhoyer @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick that's good but I want to see a transcript of the Guardian interview. I've asked for one. No luck
@Jpete008 @BioTurboNick Yawn, some "man." So deeply silly.
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick I would like to see the full transcript, for sure. But the quotes that are there are troubling, and the response was inadequate. I don't understand the reluctance to admit this.
@rickyofkokiri @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick Everybody kneel in wonder at the fools who demand absolute devotion to Clinton, then surely scoff at people who demand absolute devotion to Trump.
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick If you don't think what Clinton says matters, you should say so :)
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick I do, every single day, and have done for the last two years
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick She is a global figure and moral authority in the eyes of 10s or even 100s of millions of people
@GMSarli @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick But I wanted to hear a much clearer repudiation of the idea that the migrants are *legitimately* to blame for right wing populism, and of the notion that the liberal democracies can legitimately say they've done enough. 2/2
@GMSarli @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick Half of it made sense -- that is, the claims that comprehensive immigration reform is the answer to right wing populism, and that right wing populists exploit the migrants to boost their own power. Those are good and important points. 1/
@TheObamanista @fawfulfan @BioTurboNick You are flatly wrong about this. Criticism of her is not a claim that she *owes* *me* anything. 		As a matter of fact, she *does* owe *her own supporters* and those who care about humane immigration policy a better clarification than this one.
@fawfulfan @BioTurboNick And let me add that "why should she bother" is a puzzling response. After all, *you and I* and others who are fair to her, and even *her own supporters,* deserve a better clarification than this one.
@fawfulfan @BioTurboNick The "media" may be totally uninterested, but *I* am not totally uninterested. Over the years I have repeatedly defended her against unfair media criticism and distortions of her obvious meanings. So I reserve the right to ask for better in this particular case.
@spr0uter @NickKristof @xpostfactoid But if that manipulation actually cost Rs House seats, as even some Rs concede, then that manipulation hurt him, so why are we treating this as a mystical power of his?
@RegalHarvester @NickKristof @xpostfactoid Republicans themselves have said the focus on the caravan helped Dems win the House. This constant desire to declare that Trump has magical political powers or that his strategies are more effective than they are is mystifying.
@UnmitigatedGaul @NickKristof @xpostfactoid I'm dubious the GOP base wouldn't have come back to him without caravan. Besides, even Republicans say the caravan emphasis cost them House seats.
@bridwise @NickKristof @xpostfactoid So what? If we define media success for Trump as "persuading GOP voters to believe his lies," that sets the bar too low.
@NickKristof @xpostfactoid Given what just happened in the last election, why aren't we all clearly stating that Trump's caravan "manipulation" of media was largely a failure?

@guyindurham That's absurd to the point of being disingenuous.
@upsidedown3439 @drudgewonk my point is, this needn't sound like, "no upper limit"
@BioTurboNick Clinton: "we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support"		She needed to repudiate that. One way to do this would have been to say, "we need an internationally negotiated settlement in which we (the US) are also setting an example."
@guyindurham I reserve the right to disagree with Hillary, particularly as I am a frequent defender of hers.
@drudgewonk I'd prefer an internationally negotiated settlement. I get your point here, I'm just saying this is the general direction I wanted to hear
@blankslate2017 I don't believe she has done *her own* humane views justice here.
@AquelloG Of course, and I agree with her on that. She needed to more clearly repudiate the objectionable aspects of her Guardian quote.
@BioTurboNick Who said "let everyone in"? That mischaracterization itself helps Trump. Indeed, it's the one he regularly uses.
@GotchaSC I agree with this half of what she said. She should have more cleanly repudiated what her quote to the Guardian says
RT @frommagioh: @ThePlumLineGS the climate has told me vehemently on several occasions he's not involved.
@BioTurboNick I agree that this is probably what she *thinks.* But the original quote is unclear, and this was an opportunity to forcefully recommit to this principle. I don't understand why she wouldn't take that opportunity.
@blankslate2017 I am glad to see that part, and I agree that this is the way to beat Trumpism. Have written that repeatedly. But she needed to repudiate the Guardian quote (even if it was unintentional to some degree) more directly
@daphna27 I'm a frequent Hillary defender, so you're directing this at the wrong person.
This is highly unsatisfactory. I'd hoped for: "I was wrong to say Europe has done its part. The liberal democracies should take in more refugees, not fewer.

@JonWalkerDC @meelar @MattBruenig ...but I agree norms aren't enough (though per @JedediahSPurdy some norms are democracy enhancing), and that systemic reform is needed
@JonWalkerDC @meelar @MattBruenig The party didn't openly run on that, and they still aren't. Instead, Rs employ all kinds of bad faith arguments to disguise their actual position.
@meelar @JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Out of curiosity, what's your answer to this: https://t.co/JRvuqfxHX8
@meelar @JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig I've offered my counter arguments on that already, in multiple replies to Jon
@meelar @JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Also, I'm not arguing there's an obligation to confirm. I'm asking whether there should be an obligation to hold hearing and vote.
@meelar @JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Okay. My apologies. I thought you were being sarcastic. Having been on receiving end of @MattBruenig's abusiveness today, I'm inclined to see the worst
@meelar @JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Your glib nonsense aside, the core Q here is what to do when there aren't clear enough rules for managing competition between leg/exec of different parties
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Im not sure where this is supposed to lead. You think it's fine if it becomes standard practice for nominees to never get hearings from opposition Senates from now on (serious question)?
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Agree largely with last point but having individual Senators question nominee in front of nation and then voting on said nominee at least exposes them to voter accountability -- which is exactly why McConnell didn't want it. TBC I'm not saying this solves everything.
@politi_matt @MattBruenig @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Also, I already did directly respond to this argument
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig The way I understand the question is as whether it should be seen as an acceptable outcome if it becomes the norm that no SCOTUS nominees henceforth get any hearing from opposition Senate
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig On the rotating sham votes, I agree the current system is seriously flawed, but I'm not sure how this justifies the no hearing approach or how we're supposed to proceed if that's considered acceptable 2/2
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Even if media/public have the option of blaming GOP caucus collectively for inaction, while true, the exposure from an individual vote is more accountability-enhancing. There is obviously a meaningful difference between the two 1/
@MattBruenig @JonWalkerDC No it isn't. I answered this	objection.
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig Holding no hearing/vote at all is explicitly designed to shield individual lawmakers from accountability. This is why McConnell did it, to protect his members from voting against a qualified moderate. 2/2
@JonWalkerDC @MattBruenig I understand this argument. Here's my answer: Holding hearing/vote at least creates a position that individual senators adopted, thus exposing them to accountability from voters 1/
@puckthecat1 @MattBruenig This is what I'm trying to argue, but I can't get Matt to say whether he thinks we can/should try to elaborate such a tool/standard when one is lacking.
@ThinkMiamiBeach @MattBruenig This glib reply says nothing. The whole dispute is over what to do/how to set rules for managing such conflicts when constitution does not offer clear guidance.
@helenbinchy Agree that Dems could talk about this more
@MattBruenig question is not whether Sens are obliged to vote for a nominee (they aren't) but rather whether they're obliged to give hearing
@MattBruenig @politi_matt @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan *prayed = played
@MattBruenig @politi_matt @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan I prayed along w/this disingenuous trick &amp; replied to it multiple times. This additional Q is designed to gauge whether you see any limits on what constitutes legit manipulation of rules of political competition. Someone of your blazing intellect should be able to answer this.
@MattBruenig @politi_matt @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Should Dem legislatures pass measures explicitly designed to suppress the votes of GOP aligned constituencies, such as working class whites? After all, they can

@braak I tried to grapple with this question at some length in this book: https://t.co/O8ky62HEkE
@braak @SeanMcElwee @MattBruenig @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan This is indeed the problem. The question is whether liberals and progressives should asymmetrically strive for an ideal of fair play in politics, or not
@SeanMcElwee @MattBruenig @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan The question is whether we want to try to agree with those who we think "bad" (and who think we are "bad") on standards of procedural neutrality, or not.
"Democrats made big gains because Trump declared war on immigrants — and on multicultural America — and lost."		Here Dem pollster @StanGreenberg	demonstrates that important point about what drove the Dem win with real data:		https://t.co/i2uiKCotcu		Which again confirms: https://t.co/LnqmEOVfkN
@EricLevitz @MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan I'm not really sure how you'd evaluate this act in isolation outside its larger context. Okay, I gotta run -- always a pleasure, guys.
@weprotect_truth @pkcapitol stay tuned!
@MattBruenig @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan We are not helpless here. We can try to articulate standards for fair play in politics that say, "this conduct by one body towards another is okay, and that conduct is not."  The mere fact that there are two bodies in conflict does not automatically obviate this ideal. 2/2
@MattBruenig @EricLevitz @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Despite your snideness, this does not save your argument. First, it's not even clear whether the "body" in question has a "democratic mandate" in any meaningful sense. Second, there are exercises of power by one body towards another that we can agree constitute abuses. 1/
@EricLevitz @MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan Right. But in Matt's telling, gerrymandering is fine, b/c the legislators *can* do this. Which seems to undermine the original claim about any legislating on their part being democratically legitimate (unless any exercise of power, no matter what, is automatically legitimate).
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan To answer this question, I'll refer you back to this:		https://t.co/G2eN2xllXn
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan The correct take is that the first part of this has a real element of truth to it, which is precisely why I believe the second half cannot be controlling -- we need to *try* to agree on standards for democratically legitimate conduct, *even if* that will always be contested.
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan No, because it's not wrong to block original acts that are wrong/abuses of power. In your telling, there is simply no exercise of power that can ever legitimately or neutrally agreed upon to constitute an abuse. I don't want us to end up at that place.
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan One thing I'll concede is that it's a very difficult exercise to determine when exactly extreme hardball is justified and when it isn't. I tried to suggest overall ways of thinking about this question in my book (shameless self promotion done -- for now)
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan IOW, there are certain types of "legislating" that constitute undemocratic abuses that we should curb
@MattBruenig @haroldpollack @BrendanNyhan The two questions are of a piece with one another. "Can" =/= "ought," and we should not say that "ought doesn't matter"
@haroldpollack @MattBruenig @BrendanNyhan At some point, we need to be able to say that the "exercising of powers" becomes not okay. It's not enough to just say, "they exercised powers, so we should too." I tried to answer the core question you're talking about in this book, @haroldpollack: https://t.co/pV6iBT2tBY

6) Trump installed a loyalist to constrain the Mueller investigation.

How many Rs have raised a peep about this?		https://t.co/U8nH0r9jP1 https://t.co/PGkGxch5SO

4) But this authoritarian style goes far beyond just lying about voter fraud.		We're seeing it on one front after another right now. It *escalated* as Democrats closed in on winning the House, which means imposing accountability on Trump's corruption and lawlessness.
3) Today, Trump claimed the vote in Florida has been "infected." 		Trump uses this word constantly, to describe alleged undermining of our country by undocumented immigrants.		As a GOP pollster told me, GOP voters are open to such claims because of race:		https://t.co/VL1Jdtx4ic

Now that Trump is again suggesting that demands for full vote counts in Florida and Georgia constitute an effort to "STEAL" those elections, I'm reposting this piece. Let's be clear on the broader pattern here: https://t.co/cIf2zzHYOI

Acting AG Whitaker does have the discretion to severely limit what is reported to Congress on Mueller's findings.		Trump clearly expects this.		But House Ds can subpoena them. This would prompt a legal fight. I spoke to law prof @joshchafetz about this:		https://t.co/TWr0mL2kfy
There it is.		White House aides and people close to Trump expect the new acting AG will "rein in" what Mueller reports on his findings, NYT reports:		https://t.co/Wtdw5X8Nfb		Reminder: New House Dem majority can subpoena Mueller's findings, and has other tools as well: https://t.co/eB1ouU80Au
@unclejoegargery @RonBrownstein Hah, fair enough!
Good question from @RonBrownstein here.		My suggested answer: Conservatives don't want to admit to this erosion because it was likely fueled at least in part by a backlash against GOP economics, which has nothing to offer on health care:		https://t.co/qE16Ge2kiR https://t.co/VpQwwUYCWA

@BenjySarlin @EricLevitz fair enough
@deidshaw @NormOrnstein @KevinMKruse @sarahkendzior Sarah is great and indispensable, but Norm has been pointing this out for eight years.
@BenjySarlin @EricLevitz Right -- I think it remains to be seen how durable the realigning is. But I also don't think we should water down the significance of how big the backlash was to all of these things -- that fair?
@BenjySarlin @EricLevitz I know, but that was also before ACA repeal! I'm just saying, let's not overlook the fact that suburban whites reacted badly to Trump's xenophobic nationalism *and* to GOP economics
@BenjySarlin @EricLevitz how about the recognition that Rs wanted to strip health care from millions of poor and working people

Since I posted this piece, Trump has:		1) Called for vote counting in Georgia to stop, because the R is ahead		2) Ridiculed idea that the votes should be fully counted in Dem areas in Florida		3) Confirmed that punishment of @Acosta is designed to chill other press scrutiny: https://t.co/cIf2zzHYOI

@smotus Yes, he does, once you understand what he really means by "helpful"
Pundits keep minimizing the Democratic victory. But what really happened is a multiracial, multiethnic majority, fueled by enormous turnout, rose up to put a decisive, emphatic check on Trumpism.		Some reflections on that, and what it means for 2020:		https://t.co/3GwszDkq45
