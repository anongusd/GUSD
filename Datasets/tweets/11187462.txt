@BrinaBrady @kccoVCR @WalshFreedom There's also something no one is talking about: Kim may be afraid that if he gives up too much his hard liners will take him out.  Some of them are older than dirt and committed to become a nuclear power.
@BrinaBrady @kccoVCR @WalshFreedom Since no President has accomplished anything w/NK over multiple administrations (Clinton got snookered and gave him aid to give up nuke efforts) whatever Trump has accomplished is a plus.  Give it time.  If he fails, I'll agree with you, but it's too soon to yell failure.
@KareBearScare @WalshFreedom My thought is that you would have said the same about Reagan.  Trump's got his own style.  Using it he got a cessation of nuke testing and missiles over Japan, returned hostages, and returned remains from Korean War no one has been able to do in 70 years.
@DuncanTopping @WalshFreedom Nothing much: no NK nuke testing; no missiles over allies in their area; return of hostages; return of Korean War remains.  Nothing at all.

@G_P_Clemente I thought of Rudy this morning.  I watched a new show called Proven Innocent.  Kelsey Grammar plays a prosecutor w/no scruples. I recall Rudy spoke to my nephew's law class at Fordham and said that if he thought someone was guilty, anything he did to convict him was okay.
@G_P_Clemente I also know all the warts on Michael, including him trying to get reinstated in NY.  Rudy convicted me.  When I got my publishing deal on Blood I wrote to him, asking for a blurb, but he wouldn't answer.
@G_P_Clemente I had a lunch w/Pistone. I was surprised by his literary agent.  I told him about some of his bullshit stuff and he laughed.  Wouldn't sit with Michael.  He says he's not a rat, but he testified against Norby Walters, who was like an uncle to him.

@Jim_Jordan The argument that most drugs come through ports of entry is ridiculous &amp; never challenged.  The  most drugs interdicted come through ports of entry.  We don't know how much is successfully brought in through border crossings?  We only know what we catch.

@Acosta The question of % of crimes by illegals vs citizens is irrelevant.  We are stuck with citizens.  Even 1 crime by someone who doesn't belong here is too much.
@realDonaldTrump A) The % of crime by illegals vs citizens is irrelevant.  We are stuck with citizens, but should not have 1 from illegals. B) Figures of drugs interdicted at ports of entry DO NOT account for drugs that come over the border successfully.

@SteveHilton South Africa is as poor an example of fixing past ills as any on earth, given the fact that whites are being killed and their land taken as official policy.
@SteveHilton Black Americans also have a responsibility to lift themselves up through equalized opportunity.  It starts at home, with whole families who encourage their young to go to school; who don't tear down local businesses each time they're angered; who attack cops.
@SteveHiltonx LBJ's "Great Society" programs were supposed to make up for past actions against blacks and lift them up.  Instead, it destroyed them.  The only way forward should be equality today; equal opportunity, NOT equal outcomes. Otherwise it becomes reverse discrimination.

@timb116 I assume you mean 2020, but no one with any political intellect would predict something so far away.  And yes, there are people who entered the country illegally and are ILLEGAL residents.  They are ILLEGALS.  Undocumented is a liberal lie word.
@timb116 My ancestors assimilated by learning the language on their own; no official documents in their language; they loved America like most of those who come here legally and earned the right to be called Americans.  Simple history.
@timb116 My ancestors came here LEGALLY via Ellis Island.  Thousands have applied LEGALLY today.  Those who sneak in ILLEGALLY have no rights to burden taxpayers with medical, education, and criminal, not even one, costs. My ancestors learned English on their own, worked, had NO welfare.
@timb116 Are thousands coming across through Canada?  Are Norwegians sneaking into the country en mass?  The truth is they are coming by the thousands ILLEGALLY from shithole countries.  Undocumented means you left your wallet home. They are ILLEGALS.  Your arguments are emotional &amp; silly
