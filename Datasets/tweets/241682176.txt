But it appears amends were made years ago. McGreevey's father, Jack McGreevey, campaigned for then-Sen. Menendez in 2006.üîíhttps://t.co/dQK3rSBmRA
McGreevey/Menendez had a rocky relationship. An aide to then-governor in 2004 warned then-MoC "to back down" from calls for a speedy resignation, "accusing him of also having an affair and setting up the woman in business and referring clients to her." https://t.co/RdBuoqVkD6
McGreevey did appear with @ChrisChristie during his successful 2013 reelection. But while McGreevey said he has the "greatest personal respect and admiration" for Christie, he declined to endorse him. "I'm out of politics." https://t.co/t5wzuaa8qi
