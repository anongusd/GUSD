@ThomasReeseSJ: 	3) Regardless, one example of a feminist does not constitute any type of pattern of feminists sexually harassing men ir women. Men, as a gender, have sexually harassed women from the beginning of the writing down of historical data.
2) As for this: "kissed &amp;touched him repeatedly, slept in his bed with him, required him to lie in her bed, held his hand, texted, emailed &amp; called him constantly ...." WTF!
