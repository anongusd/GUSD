@dparkermontana @aaronflint @EssmannJeff Don’t be confused. National defense is a constitutionally defensible use of taxpayer dollars.
@dparkermontana @aaronflint @EssmannJeff So because I don’t think govt spending programs are the answer to these problems, I don’t care seriously about these problems. At least I’m clear on that now. Find me a place that spends more govt money on these problems than our reservations. I’ll wait.
@dparkermontana @aaronflint @EssmannJeff If you know how to rid the world of pain, despair, hopelessness, aka “life” and the human condition since the beginning, we’re all waiting with bated breath.
@dparkermontana @aaronflint @EssmannJeff Those conditions existed before meth, especially on the reservation. Meth has made the problem exponentially worse.
@dparkermontana @aaronflint Because the meth is high quality and easier to obtain than alcohol. The drug cartels are targeting rural tribal reservations because they can charge a premium for their product to a largely non-mobile market.
@aaronflint Roughly 90% of the criminal cases prosecuted by my office are meth related. This meth is all trafficked to Roosevelt County from Mexico.

@mikejopek @SenatorTester because I negotiated for 3 weeks with Senate Dems, mod Rs and Gov. Absolutely not speculation.
@mikejopek @SenatorTester Nothing changed. Sen Dems, mod Rs were never going to let 402 pass. This was way to kill it w/o voting against it
@mikejopek @SenatorTester you're missing the fact HB402 only passed Senate bc House adjourned and it de facto died. Was never going to Gov.
@mikejopek @SenatorTester That was cover-MT Sen wasn't going to pass my HB402 on to Gov. Dems and mod Rs didn't like it.
