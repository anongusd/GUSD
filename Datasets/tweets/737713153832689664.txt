@davidharsanyi Policy trade-offs (such as deferred prosecution of Hezbollah members) in pursuit of a broader strategic goal (blocking an extremist regime from a nuclear weapon) isn’t the same as announcing to the world your faith in an extremist government’s lies.
@davidharsanyi Equating Obama’s nuclear deal and Trump’s public attacks on the intelligence community is a false equivalence even you should recognize. And I would describe the idea that the FBI (a largely conservative org) cooked up a political investigation into DJT as a conspiracy theory.
I think I’m with you on the unlikelihood of kompromat—but POTUS’ actions certainly don’t resemble that of a man with nothing to hide. As for conspiracy v. reality, I couldn’t have come up with as pithy a description of the right-wing media as that. Well done! https://t.co/iFBC6MwNGV
I’d wager that Putin sees the rhetorical wrecking ball Trump has taken to the Western alliance over the last 2 years as enough of a win that he stomached a few missiles in Ukraine and a hundred dead mercenaries.

@nhavimark I think that the apportion of the electoral college should just match the popular vote, that way we have democratic features without the gerrymandering risk.
