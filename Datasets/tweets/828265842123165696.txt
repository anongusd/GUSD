@BillFoxMD @chucktodd @MeetThePress I hear that, and the reason I brought it up initially was that I don‚Äôt see any further implementation of the ACA at least on an 18 month horizon, in fact I think the current administration will continue to claw it back. So I think the football is as far downfield as we will get.
@BillFoxMD @chucktodd @MeetThePress So if we‚Äôre thinking about a reasonable next step, I think a public option of some sort is the right way to go. A Medicaid buy-in plan, or a Medicare buy-in plan. I think soon (3-5yr) we will have states moving to true universal access, be it single payer or multipayer.

@BillFoxMD @chucktodd @MeetThePress Agreed. However, that does assume there will be a full implementation of the ACA, and that if it were fully implemented that it would be able to realize the health outcomes/value we‚Äôre striving for‚Äî and neither of those things are true.
@BillFoxMD @chucktodd @MeetThePress The next 18 months will hopefully be a thorough negotiation of what the future of our nation‚Äôs ‚Äòhealth system‚Äô will look like, and I‚Äôm hopeful everyone with the creativity and insight to reimagine what we‚Äôre doing is at the table.
@BillFoxMD @chucktodd @MeetThePress I wonder what he means by not fully implemented‚Äîif it‚Äôs the state by state expansion of Medicaid then it seems unfair because there‚Äôs no timeline. Usual Medicare for All pushback is around funding, I wonder if there‚Äôs similar concern around Medicare for some, or Medicaid for all?

I am TOTALLY for a fridge with free food though
@howell_ben @DrPoorman @ypc_chiefs @laceywh @jasleen_salwan @rbkrist @khchaiyachati @manikchhabra @Tracy_Rabin I think the core though is that the culture is right - the biggest thing our faculty do to promote our wellness is role model how they talk about, care for, and teach us about patient care.

@howell_ben @DrPoorman @ypc_chiefs @laceywh @jasleen_salwan @rbkrist @khchaiyachati @manikchhabra @Tracy_Rabin Other examples - intern retreat (protected weekend in woods with core faculty), Medicine and the Arts (~quarterly evening of skits/songs/Hamilton re-enactments), candy rounds with chiefs (kitschy but fun).

@sostfeldjohns @sue_bornstein But when I think of safety net hospitals I think of my training at UMC in New Orleans, and those with a commitment to the underserved in the mission/vision/values of the organization, which I haven't seen in the YNHH org statements
@sostfeldjohns @sue_bornstein For the last numbers I see for YNHH I see Medicare 41%, Medicaid 22%, so that seems to align. [ https://t.co/rJu6op6D8W]. But I'll confess I don't know if we are in the top quartile in CT for Medicaid / uninsured discharges.
@sostfeldjohns @sue_bornstein I see that in this policy brief SNH are defined as hospitals which care for a percentage of Medicaid and uninsured patients in the top quartile of the state, and in the list for hospital's that aren't safety net had Medicare 42%, Medicaid 16%.

@Cascadia @Atul_Gawande @Medscape Sounds like we‚Äôre talking past each other some.

I was also pointing out that physician salary isn‚Äôt a primary issue in health care costs.

@kglarson I‚Äôm really sorry to hear your premiums are becoming unaffordable. Often as of late that‚Äôs been because insurers are consolidating, and they are able to raise premiums due to the limited competition.
@kglarson I also believe by and large the VA is an outstanding health care delivery system and I take care of veterans daily that have better access to care than they would in the private health care system, so we disagree on that point too.
@kglarson Right, well I guess we disagree on what it means to 'need' health insurance. I believe that when people don't have it they avoid routine health maintenance and eventually they die earlier of diseases that could have been prevented but they are sick and hospitalized more often.
@kglarson No, it's called a public option. Single payer is when there's only one option. Also, in a lot of ways, the VA provides better care than you can get in the private sector, but I'm pretty confident you're not interested in that idea.
This is an absurd idea rooted in biases that are popular but with minimal evidence. We should get rid of any means testing in Medicaid and make it available to anyone regardless of income - https://t.co/8UDCaK2FZn
