Take a monopoly on jet based border security by scooping up every foreclosed upon Pilatus from the Keys to Guam at a steep discount, fit them with FLiR, and contract them out to Homeland. There's even a way to structure it like a non-profit, neutralize tax liability, and do good.
1. Find the foreclosed upon jets. Especially anything Pilatus w/ the Next-Gen avionics.	2. Get with Northrop/Grumman, or even directly w/ FLiR. Make each jet capable of seeing a cigarette being lit from 30,000 feet in a hurricane.	3. Request an audience with Homeland Security.
