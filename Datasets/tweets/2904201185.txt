.@DevinMurphyDTM on the importance of @prioritiesUSA: If Democrats remain offline, then we are doing a disservice to the people. That's why we're targeting a # of districts across the nation &amp; investing in media buying that talks about healthcare, GOP tax cuts &amp; more.
.@DevinMurphyDTM on getting started in digital: Digital is not impossible for young people, POC, marginalized communities, it is already in our hands. As long as we self-learn (&amp; have access to internet), we can do it. Use Google &amp; YouTube to your advantage.
.@DevinMurphyDTM on networking: Use yourself &amp; the tools that you already have to push yourself. You actually have more resources than you think. I have cold called and emailed people and it works.
.@DevinMurphyDTM on networking: When folks network, people think that you have to go to events &amp; have to invited. The reality is our network is the people in front of us-- our friends &amp; family. Then there's a level that go higher: people we've worked &amp; gone to school with, etc.
Starting @dtmstrategies made me understand contracts and scopes of work. Once I understood how to build a business, it became simpler to explore &amp; pitch to people. It began to become easier to frame &amp; market myself in the scope of my experience. @DevinMurphyDTM
.@DevinMurphyDTM on @dtmstrategies: It started from a simple Facebook post. Slowly, but surely, my network connected me to individuals who were interested in my services. It became something that I started seriously.
.@DevinMurphyDTM: One of the biggest mentors of mine was @aimeeallison. She said, why not do social media, communications, &amp; tech for a living? Since then, I have always seen myself as an entrepreneur.

Let that sink in: 60%. As @MariaTeresa1 raised, authentic outreach to young Latino voters requires consultants who understand them &amp; their community, all of which only makes the work of orgs like @VotoLatino &amp; @TheNADC even more essential and needed.		https://t.co/3Qo8EDOwKN

Great point from @David_desJ! Hiring diverse junior staff as @JointCenter notes requires intentional recruitment of diverse candidates &amp; removal of barriers like unpaid internships, which @payourinterns has been fighting for, to encourage POC to apply. 		https://t.co/oK7zjBqiYo

Thank you SIERRA for joining us for tonight's Q&amp;A!!!		"When you're fundraising, let your personality come out in your work. Let your passion come out in your work." - @SierraKC_, Development Manager at @AmericaVotes
Don't be scared of fundraising. Don't be scared to be turned down. @SierraKC_, Development Manager at @AmericaVotes
Q: What sites do you use for donor research? 	A: https://t.co/b7VTq1Zquk #DiversifyFundraising
Hire people of color to positions where they have a lot of power. @SierraKC_
Thread (4/4) It's always going to be campaign managers, finance directors, comms who get hired right after the campaign. Just knowing this fact alone made me understand the value of fundraising, the value of you bring to the table being the fundraiser. @SierraKC_
Thread (3/4) But when you are working on a campaign, your hope is to get hired. When you are working in field or programs, when the campaign is over, those field jobs &amp; programs are usually the last to get hired. @SierraKC_
Thread (2/4)  Often times, people of color take these jobs but they do not have access to fundraising jobs. @SierraKC_
Thread (1/4) One piece of advice that I received was young people of color who work to get involved or want to work on campaigns are that they are often placed in program or field jobs. @SierraKC_
Being a fundraiser is a lot like being a strategist. @SierraKC_
HAPPENING NOW: Join our Q&amp;A with Sierra (@SierraKC_), Development Manager at @AmericaVotes, on how we can support black women and women of color in political fundraising! https://t.co/Em0H9Uxz7r
