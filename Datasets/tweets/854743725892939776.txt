An Iowa family of four pays more in income taxes than an Iowa credit union making millions. That’s not fair. #TaxFairness  https://t.co/yOopyhSPHu
Nebraska Sen. Rob Clements introduced the bill because credit unions are branching out far beyond their traditional purpose of serving specific groups of people, such as government employees or residents of a single town. #TaxFairness  https://t.co/WLZ30xaPOf

A similar dispute between banks and credit union has erupted in Iowa. Last week, the state's top banking lobbyists called on lawmakers to impose the same tax on credit unions that banks pay and "end credit unions' free ride." #TaxFairness  https://t.co/EzgbtNKWeo
Iowa families pay income taxes. Why don't big credit unions?? Let’s put banks and credit unions on an equal footing so community banks can better serve our Main Street small businesses, farmers, and consumers. #TaxFairness https://t.co/9NAP2uMs5e
The average Iowa family pays $7,000 in income taxes yet credit unions that make $75 million a year in profits pay $0. We encourage Iowa lawmakers to address the tax inequity beteen banks and credit unions. #TaxFairness https://t.co/6Ul5m7ZASm
Iowa credit unions are using their tax savings to pay million-dollar salaries to their senior executives, build fancy offices in the highest-income areas, and pay for naming rights to sports and entertainment venues. #TaxFairness https://t.co/1IzSFPFOVh

This Valentine’s Day, let’s send our Main Street community banks some love for helping our communities thrive. If banks and credit unions are competing for business from Iowans, they should play on a level playing field. #TaxFairness https://t.co/RmEzYpxGfc
Iowa taxpayers have subsidized the nation’s largest credit unions. It’s about time Iowa’s tax policy puts our communities and farmers first and promotes a fair tax system. #TaxFairness

WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Senate could pass legislation as soon as tonight that would "free up burdensome regulations and give consumers easier access to credit." A win for Main Street small businesses and farmers!
The Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act “eliminates carve-outs for special interests in order to prioritize the average American over the well-connected, and it lowers taxes for American job creators, big and small. — @RepErikPaulsen https://t.co/G5eDXCGtRi
Needed reform will help small businesses access the resources they need to invest and hire more workers, and provide working families and farmers the support they need. Main Street wins! https://t.co/AcZMpQKXMV
"If Ronald Reagan was right that the ‘nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth' is a government program, then the second closest thing to eternal life must be a federal tax subsidy." https://t.co/iW0BWFlIwS

“I agree with Sen. Hatch that many larger credit unions operate in the same manner as taxable banks, and I believe it’s time for them to convert to bank charters and be taxed like the ‘big boys,’” - Credit Union President and CEO https://t.co/p15Asvevqs
"We may not each employ thousands of people like Smucker’s, but our goods and services bind local communities together. When we succeed, our employees and their families gain the financial security needed to thrive in modern America.” https://t.co/KquCCNAP1D
Treating your community banks and credit unions fairly means Iowa communities win. The Iowa Working Families Tax Relief Act helps communities, small businesses, and farmers. #TaxFairness
