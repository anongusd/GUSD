@twhubler @IWF @BetsyDeVosED @schoolchoicewk @BetsyDeVos @realclearpolicy @CarterAB $ often doesn't reflect real costs adj'd for student, school, and geo factors.

Great question!
@arXiv6174 @IWF @IWV @schoolchoicewk @HadleyHeath Amen!
@arXiv6174 @IWF @IWV @schoolchoicewk @HadleyHeath Yes-rationing ed based on where families can afford to live stifles positive change.
@arXiv6174 @IWF @IWV @schoolchoicewk @HadleyHeath We are. Some thoughts: heavy-handed govt mandates that require more $ for admin, not great teachers; that undermine local autonomy &amp; innovation; and that focus on bureaucratic compliance, not what's best for individual students.
