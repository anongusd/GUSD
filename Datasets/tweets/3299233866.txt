@IngrahamAngle 		It truly does not matter what the @GOP Senator’s did/didn’t do today because the @Democrats don’t really care.   @SenateDems have shown that they will “use” any situation to show complete disdain for @GOP #Kavanaugh @realDonaldTrump conservatives etc.
@IngrahamAngle If #BrettKavanaugh was angry, he is justified.
When she spoke, I didn’t get that raw, tortured emotional statement that moved me to tears. I can’t speak about my abuse without a complete breakdown. I didn’t see the same level of raw emotion in #ChristineBlasleyFord .
@IngrahamAngle I pity #ChristineBlaseyFord and feel sorry for her. I saw a troubled woman. I am a survivor. I saw more emotion from @sengraham2016 than I did from her. I will pray for her. I am not judging her or doubting her, but I sobbed through #BrettKavanuagh ‘s statement.

@TamraBarney  This is a biblical principle I learned in BSF Classes. Bible Study Fellowship really helped me understand my relationships, with God, my family, my disease (dis-ease) and myself. I grew up in a Christian home. I believed in Christ. Will continue....
@TamraBarney First, start every day putting everything into God’s hands. Literally, tell him -out loud, everything that is going on in your life and how you feel about it. Then, ask him to take care of it for you. He is our father and he truly cares. #MéMesStory .......will cont.
@TamraBarney I watched the show “Seeing Red”. I know how you feel about “where is God” when you pray and pray for healing. I was diagnosed with endometriosis and Hoshimotos at age 14. At 53 years old, a Christian, I have a lot of answers. -Some hard, some easy..I will continue
