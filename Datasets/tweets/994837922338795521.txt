6/ Finally, I found something will the 4 digits and was able to send an email to my US Rep.
5/ Are you supposed to have this 4-digit extension memorized? Today was the first time in my life that I‚Äôve ever needed it for anything! I couldn‚Äôt find the extension with a google search, so then I had to scrounge around my house for mail with the 4-digit extension on it.
4/ How is it that my full address couldn‚Äôt generate whether or not I was a constituent? It‚Äôs a congressional website! The Texas Legislature Online‚Äôs Who Represents Me? feature https://t.co/pIUF7p7k3m can typically pinpoint this info just fine w/o 4-digit extension. 	#ThanksTxLege
3/ I then went on to email my US Rep, where I had to put in my full address before it'd allow me to send an email. The next page told me that because my zip code is split between multiple districts, I must add the 4-digit extension of my zip code to be allowed to send an email.
2/ First, I called US Capitol switchboard &amp; asked for my US Rep. The switchboard worker immediately forwarded me to my US SEN. I hung up &amp; found the direct number to my US Rep online. I then called &amp; it rang &amp;  rang, &amp; eventually it just ended my call. No voicemail. No staffer.
THREAD/RANT:	I tried contacting my congressman during lunch today and I want to tell you about my experience. SO many hoops to go through and I imagine all these hoops are even bigger/more consequential for people who are aging and/or have disabilities.

Language acquisition is a critical component of ensuring that all students with disabilities in Texas achieve their potential for independence, productivity, and full integration into the community. #txed #txlege #studentswithdisabilities #publiceducation
ELLs can be misidentified or under-identified in qualifying for SpEd. Lack of adequate training in second language acquisition, cultural sensitivity, ESL instruction &amp; bilingual ed., &amp; pre-referral interventions in both special &amp; general ed. contribute to prevalence of this issue
As 2 of the fastest growing subgroups of students served in Texas public schools (special education and english language learners), Texas must examine the current state of services needed by students who are in both subgroups. #SpEd #txed #txlege
A major barrier for teachers, schools, and districts is determining whether an ELL is experiencing academic difficulties in school due to issues primarily related to language acquisition, or to disability.
During 2017-18 school year, 17.6% of all identified #ELLs in Texas‚Äô public schools received #SpEd. 31.8% received #bilingual services &amp; 57.4% received #ESL services. Almost 11% of ELLs receiving SpEd services were not provided any services through an ELL program. #txed #txlege https://t.co/7svmhJhXMy
Did you know that since 1990, #ESL &amp; #SpEd have been the only 2 teacher shortage areas consistently designated every single school year in Texas? https://t.co/VqLLryp55M

Me too. I'd also like for a follow-up to highlight Supported Decision-Making (SDM). In 2015, Texas became the 1st state to put SDM in law. It's an alternative to guardianship that supports people to make their own decisions &amp; stay in charge of their lives. https://t.co/T8yCqsOf1i https://t.co/HyWlUzSjHp
I did a little number crunchin' today. TX ESL program was utilized by students receiving special education services 25% more than Bilingual program during 2017-18 school year. I'm interested in why 10.81% of identified ELLs only received #SpEd w/o language program. #txed #pubed https://t.co/zvEqi4rH0b
Texans with disabilities and their family members play a vital role in advisory committees, boards, and councils. Supports, accommodations, and travel reimbursements/advances are crucial in ensuring inclusive and meaningful participation.

Thank you @ccmasey for educating us on #SpecialEducation in #Texas. #txlege #work https://t.co/SHyH7iWQXE
The issue of the 8.5% is a good reminder that the rulemaking process and development of manuals are a impactful part of the policy making/execution process. The 8.5% was found in an obscure manual. #TXlege should not be our only advocacy focus; state agencies need advocacy too.
Special education services in Texas are underfunded to the tune of about 1.8 BILLION dollars a year. School districts are forced to make do and students with disabilities often go without. #sped #txlege #schoolfinance #spedtx #publicpolicy #educationmatters

Prior to @brianmrosenthal‚Äôs #denied series, there weren‚Äôt a lot of people focused on #SpEd. After the series there was a ground swell and a lot of people were galvanized. Many grassroots efforts began at the #txlege because people were outraged.
.@ccmasey emphasizes that special education advocates have to be steadfast and have to continually educate and train so that issues like the 8.5% target (indicator 10) do not happen again. #spedtx #specialeducation #policy #txlege #disabilityadvocacy

.@NPRJoeShapiro @NPR Hi! I am using your illuminating report on the #sexualassault epidemic against people with intellectual diabilities to inform testimony I'm giving to the #txlege next week. What year is the 1% of allegations in Texas confirmed stat from? Thank you! https://t.co/Phafsb2U3C
4/ Police and prosecutors are often reluctant and unprepared to take on these cases due to inadequate training, stigma, and because they are difficult to win in court. FAR TOO MANY people with disabilities who experience sexual assault are denied justice. [END]
3/ One reason for this is that allegations of sexual assault rarely result in prosecution, so the abuser is free to abuse again. In Texas, fewer than 1% of allegations reported or observed by a provider were confirmed (@NPRJoeShapiro see: https://t.co/QlNnlfRne4).
2/ People with disabilities are *SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY* to experience #sexualassault than those without disabilities. And nearly *90%* of females with intellectual or developmental disabilities (#IDD) face sexual assault during their lifetime (@TheArcUS). #epidemic
1/ On 5/23/18, the #txlege House Criminal Jurisprudence Cmte will hear testimony regarding sexual assault prosecutions. #Texans with disabilities need to be included in this conversation about sexual assault #prosecution because they are disproportionately impacted. #MeToo https://t.co/IEaY2zIQdS
