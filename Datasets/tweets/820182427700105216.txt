@monreale25 @SenJohnMcCain Trump made fun of him for getting captured in Vietnam while he draft dodged. Trump knows less about being honorable than McCain's pinky.

@realDonaldTrump Donald Corleone made Comey an offer he legally had to refuse and document. #Impeach #flynngate Before he became the Don he was "Tiny Hands."
@POTUS Did your rich ass mogul Daddy tell you that? Putin? "The best people" who you secretly know? Your own colon? #Trump #maga #comey #insidejob
@realDonaldTrump Your tiny hands can't cover your fat leaky mouth in front of the Russians. That is best case scenario #sad #impeach #comey #leaks
@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg If the @POTUS is twitter beefing with him his career is doing just fine. If you want our respect drop a track.
@realDonaldTrump You know neonazis love you right?
#POTUS Hey lying dumbass. Taxing imports from Mexico will just make everything cost more. US citizens are still paying for that #fuckingwall
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Your leaky staff says you are irrational. I am apt to agree, your head has a merkin on it. See a therapist, please.
@POTUS How stupid do you think Mexico is? You would have to be dumb enough to bankrupt a casino to think they would pay for the #fuckingwall
@realDonaldTrump Donald no one wants to see your ass, but morons elected you president. I am sure the Mexicans will be happy to miss it.
@realDonaldTrump We did $531b of trade with Mexico in 2015. $60b is just 11.2%. We are the richer country so our consumer sector is larger.
@realDonaldTrump  Shut the fuck up Donald. Part of what makes a person a strong leader is doing the right thing for critics. You so weeaaak!
@realDonaldTrump your leaky staff says twitter bothers you: Your hands are tiny and everyone you respect is laughing at you behind your back
@POTUS you tiny handed yob. People climb Mt. Everest. Own ladders and ropes. Dig tunnels. Build ramps, stairs and zip lines etc #fuckingwall
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Wrong! Your highest duty is to the Constitution and the rights of every single American citizen.
@realDonaldTrump You need to see a therapist dude. You are clearly mentally unbalanced. Get some help, the voices in your head must be awful
@realDonaldTrump I think Republicans know this is voter suppression, but you are dumb enough to believe it is a problem because of your ego.
@realDonaldTrump People climb Mt. Everest and build tunnels large enough for subway systems. Your wall is objectively dumb as hell.
@realDonaldTrump American cities will resist your racist BS. But if you want to increase resources for useful programs please do it.
@realDonaldTrump Fox + Trump + hordes of elderly viewers = fucking the future for Millenials. We get to write your legacy it will be bad.
@POTUS  Based on the current quality of your cabinet picks when are you going to make El Chapo head of the DEA?
@realDonaldTrump President of the US fights free market forces with political threats. Conservatives cheer? #twilightzone
@realDonaldTrump Seriously? Another image cut to make the crowd look massive? How insecure are you? Do you need a hug? Get a therapist dude.
@POTUS Donald Quixote gives an alternative fact about a windmill: 		"It's a Dragon."		#donaldquixote
@POTUS Clever camera angle combing over your lack of crowd size. No surprise coming from a man with your hair. #compensatingforsomething
@POTUS Donald are you spamming B grade inspirational quotes in hopes that you will stumble on one that sounds profound? #throwwordsatwall
@POTUS That meeting better fucking be about how we are going to be first in next generation assembly robotics. Otherwise bite me.
@POTUS I DREAM of a president that believes in science, I CHALLENGE you to go a day without lying to your supporters. #tinyhandsoutreach
@POTUS What about the dreams of the Dreamers who were part of the dream act?
@POTUS I hope you all discussed police reform. They are over militarized and under trained. Better training would make them safer too.
@POTUS You represent a minority faction. The people live in cities and hate you. You can fix that by apologizing and changing your stances.
@realDonaldTrump You are are president. It is your fucking job to listen to our views. We are the majority and we will be heard.
@realDonaldTrump Shut the fuck up Donald. If you don't respect the media always you don't get praise them for sucking your dick.
@realDonaldTrump CIA wants global influence for US. You want us to be crippled isolationists. This doesn't add up with your tweet.
@realDonaldTrump We did vote dumbass, cities hate your guts. That is why you lost the popular vote by literally millions. Don't play dumb.
@realDonaldTrump Assuming you are correct. There is no way to tell why they watched. Based on the popular vote, anger and fear most likely.
@SpeakerRyan Remember this tweet in 4 years. Your party let a Fox into Democracy's henhouse. He may not be willing to leave after losing.
@realDonaldTrump "THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES." I see what you did there. Pooping and tweeting again. Your movement is shit. #pottymouthdonald
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump Good news, after tonight we can hook a dynamo up to Lincoln's body and its spinning will give us all the energy we need.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.

@realDonaldTrump If Donald Trump gets caught having oral sex in an odd way, weird place, or strange circumstance that will become a Trumpkin
@realDonaldTrump I hear you are immediately planning on taking a vacation. How about you not do that. And get your ass to work rich boy.
@realDonaldTrump America is already great. Your slogan's implied premise is unpatriotic and wrong.
@realDonaldTrump An opportunist is someone who exploits a weakness for personal gain. Like you are doing with America. Go fuck yourself.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump Promoting your businesses after fake divesting...Classic Donald. Dirty old monopoly man unqualified for his new job.
@realDonaldTrump How far down your list were they Donald? Oh wait you are incapable of self criticism so they retroactively were at #1.
@realDonaldTrump Based on how much you hate on NBC a rational person must assume they are doing something right. You are a man baby.
@realDonaldTrump You aren't even close to creating as many jobs as Obama. Bullying firms one by one is not systemic reform dumbass.
@realDonaldTrump Fake news is spread by old people online who don't know how to fact check. That is why they voted for you but you know that
@realDonaldTrump Totally delusional President elect makes unsubstantiated claims. The rest of the world is laughing at us because of you.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump We all know know you cheat at golf. Sam Jackson has more integrity in the shits he takes than you have in your entire body.
@realDonaldTrump Hire someone who actually has experience dumbass. Pay teachers more. Invest in our public schools.
@realDonaldTrump Bullying companies to employ a few people in outdated jobs is not a solution. You are just kicking the can down the road.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong! The media covered you so much that your Republican rivals could not compete with you because  airtime volume.
@realDonaldTrump Bush like you did not win the popular vote. He also turned out to be a horrible president. John Lewis was right to skip.
@realDonaldTrump Aha! a technicality. To the cunt mobile, cuntman is needed. "Technically correct, the best kind of correct" #futurama
@realDonaldTrump your ego is huge. However based on your hand and dick size assessments you don't know what big means.
@realDonaldTrump fuck your manufacturing subsidies. I want cheap cars and Americans working in industries of the future. Not manufacturing.
@realDonaldTrump Polls were within normal error margins. Good models had you at 30%ish to win. As did casino odds, which you should know.
@realDonaldTrump there are giant protests planned you idiot. You are controversial not popular. Your supporters plus your haters.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously dude? Take up yoga if you want to ride your own dick. This public self fellating on twitter is embarrassing.
@realDonaldTrump as always promoting you and your family is the fastest way to your heart. You all put the self into self interested.
@realDonaldTrump @levisteveholt By definition transparent government is not getting updates directly from those in power. Swing and a miss.
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump fighting with the CIA like a petulant child is stupid and not presidential. I think you lied about "having the best brain."
@realDonaldTrump please don't take doing worse as a challenge. I am sure you will be bad enough doing your best.
@realDonaldTrump Damn Donald your skin is thin. Tiny hands, tiny penis and you think both are normal because you compare them to each other.
@realDonaldTrump The media puts the word unsubstantiated in front of potential lies. You just lie.  #TedCruzFatherKennedyAssassination
@realDonaldTrump If you hadn't spent an entire election cycle ruining your own character. Unsubstantiated accusations would not be news.
@realDonaldTrump Only if you change literally every single thing about yourself.
@realDonaldTrump You are appealing to a narrow slice of the electorate with economic pandering. It hurts the rest of us. You are dividing us
@realDonaldTrump Manufacturing is a special interest. It is an obsolete way to make a living. America is about the future not the past.
@realDonaldTrump  1930's Adolfs are the only ones who can truly relate to 2010's Donalds. Stop shaming that proud name. #notalldonalds
@thalordson @realDonaldTrump That was my point. Literally dead wrong.
@realDonaldTrump Shut the fuck up Donald. You have no record. John Lewis does. You need to help him. Open your ears not your mouth for once.
@realDonaldTrump  I hear that ACA patients who voted for you and have preexisting conditions might end up being dead wrong about you.
@realDonaldTrump Have you asked R. Kelly to headline?
@realDonaldTrump For a man who doesn't drink you sure do like cheap shots. So classy, the well liquor of presidents. #drunkonpower
@realDonaldTrump This is an acceptable tweet. Good boy.
@realDonaldTrump I didn't make the connection until now, but you like watching people be "pissed off," too. So you insult good men.
@realDonaldTrump Are these insiders the voices in your head that scream at you to tweet in all caps while on the crapper? #pottymouthdonald
@realDonaldTrump If CEOs built businesses on their Daddy's money and saying "You're fired," they would be "all talk," and be paid jack shit.
@POTUS  you are the Wagyu beef in the middle of a shit sandwich of presidential administrations. Thank you for trying.
@realDonaldTrump "Donald Doesn't Care" has a nice ring to it for your plan. It will be what doctors say to ACA patients losing coverage.
