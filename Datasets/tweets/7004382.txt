@BetsyDeVosED Most importantly, the rule made it clear that regardless of where an online program is physically located, it must earn approval from any state where its students reside. It reaffirmed that states have the right &amp; responsibility to maintain strong oversight of these programs.
@BetsyDeVosED To start, the rule increased transparency for students. For example, if a student was considering an online nursing program that would not qualify them to work in their particular state, this rule would require programs to disclose that information.
Late Friday afternoon, @BetsyDeVosED issued a two-year delay of the Program Integrity and Improvement rule, which ensures state oversight of online education programs, many of which are for-profit. This delay is problematic in a number of ways...

And it ensures workers can negotiate directly with the company that functionally controls the conditions of their employment, including their wages, hours and benefits.

Committee Democrats will keep pushing to make sure that @USDOL is following evidence-based practices to prevent overuse of opioid prescriptions in the FECA	program and #protectworkers from dependency and addiction. https://t.co/KIHK3mBK91
While @USDOL has recently taken initial steps, it is critical that the Department stems the tide of further opioid addiction when caring for injured federal workers. States like Ohio and Washington have set an example to follow.
According to today‚Äôs witness testimony, ‚ÄúFECA is five or six years behind the rest of the workers‚Äô compensation industry‚Äù when it comes to dealing with the opioid crisis. https://t.co/2gvZSSfeYH https://t.co/dV9Fl2p3uy
This raises important questions about whether @USDOL is adequately guarding against opioid over-prescription in the FECA program.
In FY 2017, more than HALF(!) of FECA‚Äôs monthly pharmacy claims included opioid prescriptions. There are 27,000 injured workers in the FECA program who are prescribed opioids on an ongoing basis.
The Federal Employees' Compensation Act, or FECA, provides workers‚Äô compensation coverage for 2.8 million federal civilian workers for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. 		@USDOL is responsible for managing FECA.

Today @POTUS stalled the #Fiduciary Rule. Whose interest do you think he had in mind? #WorkingFamilies or Wall Street?
#Fiduciary Rule requires financial advisors to do what is in YOUR best interest instead of the their best interest https://t.co/kQbA1rl01L
Will @POTUS finally commit to the longstanding and bipartisan tradition of standing behind the BLS monthly employment situation report?
The BLS report contributes to a continued record streak of jobs growth under the Obama Administration. #ActualFacts
According to the independent analysis of BLS Report released today, the economy generated 227,000 new jobs in January. #ActualFacts

Scott Statement on Republican Efforts to Dismantle Critical Worker Protections https://t.co/CrKPJjgG98 #FairPaySafeWorkplaces
.@POTUS promised to stand up for workers. Repealing the #FairPaySafeWorkplaces EO will be one of his #BrokenPromises https://t.co/68hXZVgzXZ
.@HouseGOP are rewarding special interest by voting to destroy the #FairPaySafeWorkplaces EO. America's #workingfamilies deserve better.

Once again, the @HouseGOP is trying to dismantle critical protections for workers. Today it‚Äôs the #FairPaySafeWorkplaces EO.
Effective #SchoolChoice	‚úìoversight	‚úìaccountability	‚úìcivil rights protections for students/families		GOP "choice" doesn't provide those
GOP #SchoolChoice is a giveaway to upper-income families &amp; for-profit organizations at the expense of America's public school students https://t.co/aGWovEOWDi
Democrats believe public education is one of the bedrocks of our democracy. Republican #SchoolChoice plans undermine public education https://t.co/UAjFvQBTjI
Studies find #SchoolChoice programs do not guarantee improved or equitable education outcomes for students
Republicans' #SchoolChoice plans divert public school funds to private &amp; for-profit schools with zero accountability. #StudentsDeserveMore
Many #SchoolChoice plans deny vulnerable students civil rights protections. Students w/ disabilities often must wave #IDEA protections
