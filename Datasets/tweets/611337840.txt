@MarieResistance The Constitution requires the census for the purpose of determining the representation. Age is a basic question on all census forms since the first. The reason being is to determine the number of citizen adults, clearly.

@MarieResistance Name exactly how you see me as disagreeing with the Constitution?
@MarieResistance I think now we're at the root of the issue.	It is not private, certainly not worth the price it costs. Which if you reread my posts in that light you'll see the cost of trying to protect the privacy of it.	Like I said before, my initial reaction to citizenship? Was same as yours.
@MarieResistance Nope. We are misunderstanding each other somehow.
@MarieResistance Just so it's very clear. The Constitution is absolutely the stone that holds us together. It is the great compromise. It is not to be interpreted. It is not evolving. It does not flex.	I think our disagreement is that the question of citizenship is a privacy issue.
@MarieResistance Why are you twisting my words and not following?
@MarieResistance Yes. But the # of reps a state gets is determined by the census. In the above extreme example, WY would get nearly all the reps based on "population" and no distinction of citizenship. It is a leftist lie that citizenship is some privacy issue.
@MarieResistance Privacy is important to me. I was pretty offended by getting the long form last time around, it was extremely intrusive. No, it's not okay to ask personal or private things. But citizenship should be a matter of pride, not privacy.
@MarieResistance I do not want to subvert it. I hope my China example explains my why. I was at first against the citizen question on the census as a violation of privacy. But in this case it is required to protect the constitution. And it is not really a privacy issue that is critical.
@MarieResistance But other than "citizens" are in fact voting. The census needs to determine a count of citizens so that the constitutional math for representation can be accurate. Exp, extreme, say all of China was visiting WY at time of census and counted in it without differentiation...see?
@MarieResistance Citizens vote, not illegals, not non-citizens.
@MarieResistance States like HI, AK, WY are in affect nullified by the number of illegal votes. The ramifications of this are deep and very disturbing.
@MarieResistance Further it is determined how many each state has depending on its % of the population. If the number of non-citizen votes equals 1 Rep in a state, that rep is in essence robbed from other states. With that number equaling about 9 reps in CA for example,
@MarieResistance Rich! Your side seems to always place on others what is really in yourself.	There is nothing "anti-Constitution" in me.	The simple fact is that the country has a fixed amount of Reps, the population is divided by that number to come up with how many votes = a Rep.
@MarieResistance Suggesting??? Is that not obvious to you???

@AOC Funny you can quote the KKK, oh wait, you probably have access to all their stuff as the democrats invented the kkk. Garbage in, garbage out. Try learning about what, say Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison said. You'll find them more useful and enlightening.

@realDonaldTrump Compelling talk Mr. President. Thank You!	Nearly every American sleeps between walls and any that do not wish they could. Most work behind a wall. The house our Founders built needs a wall too! God bless you! And God bless America! #BuildTheWall
@Tupelobee @9975Ts @Jillibean557 @realDonaldTrump Thought so, it looks like it has writting on it, and looks like one of those things no one is supposed to see. lol
@VesantoMelina @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Oh? Clever, and what is around you as you sleep each night? What is around you right now? Walls have always worked.
@EvansMarie @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You sleep between four "medieval wall"s each night and they still work.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Most Americans already live behind walls, 4 walls and a roof??? Weather is one reason, but security is another big one. Your argument against the #BuildTheWall has no merit.
@Tupelobee @9975Ts @Jillibean557 btw, thanks for the post :)
@Tupelobee @9975Ts @Jillibean557 Wko has their hand on @realDonaldTrump shoulder? and what's that on the wrist?

@OfficialSPGB @MarkRPellegrino @FyrchMyrddin Marx simply defined and named a transitional stage between democracy and anarchy, nothing superior at all.
@jlmreading @lrlperson @NancyRVCL @timkaine So, you think that it is okay to steal?
@OfficialSPGB @FyrchMyrddin Further, we currently have very little in common with true capitalism and much in common with communism, hence our sad state of affairs.

@OfficialSPGB @nuyearsday @mitchellvii Then why after 8 years of a socialist in office do we see that the rich got richer, the middle class got poor, and the poor got poorer?

@StephEvz43 @realDonaldTrump Gosh, I don't see anything there about "funding".
@StephEvz43 @realDonaldTrump The constitution also talks about "treason"..."No Trump, no Wall, no USA at all!" That is "treason", that is what #Antifa shouted.

@xerxeswatkins Also there has been several video incidents of these marchers blocking streets and drivers bulldogging their way through(cont)
@xerxeswatkins As LEO probably has seen a lot of hit and runs, accidents of people not paying attention...(cont)
@xerxeswatkins Think I did, sorry Jim ran out of room. I'm just saying, when he posted it probably didn't know someone was killed.(cont)
@xerxeswatkins honestly that was my first thought as I saw the video almost live time. That the person was texting, drunk, etc... and street full of people
@xerxeswatkins When things were posted and what was known at time very important. Awhile back was hit by car and first thing was he tried to run.
It just keeps coming. I really cannot believe how corrupt our government and the left have become. #CrookedHillary #LockThemUp https://t.co/HEgJlwyK0T
@ananavarro That is how the left looks at all of us, as uneducated baboons. Though they wouldn't say that because they like baboons.

@CommonSenseinTN @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Really? Who said what, when, and how does it apply to my comment?
@CommonSenseinTN @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro What exactly is "absolutely not true"?
@TEN_GOP Something is probably going to be happening soon in CA, as buses here the other night, dozens, last time like this Dem primary time.
@TEN_GOP Next it'll be a book burning. That was destruction of public property! Again, where are law enforcement?

@Corrynmb @skb_sara @EboniKWilliams @POTUS @FoxNews @FoxNews on the weekends has long been a liberal rag. Except for a few like @TuckerCarlson and @seanhannity they are not worth any time.
@SaltyTusk @1TrumpMAGA lol
@MemeAlertNews @unsavoryagents News flash! "Hate Speech" is against a group, against an individual might be called bullying. #censorship is what this is.
@2Chron169 @POTUS Dear @CBS "terror" requires intent and planning. What evidence of any "planning" are you keeping from us? #FakeNews #cbs
@mitchellvii @careyc1210 That's harsh! But sadly so true. Shame on @ananavarro

@Acosta News Flash! You are a reporter, you report the news. Your report above is #FakeNews. The truth, @POTUS stated I was #FakeNews that's news

@Fuctupmind It looks like Lee Harvey Oswald to me.	Sorry, could not resist. Hair color matches 20 yo	Would like to see face turned same way, nose diff?
@garyinlv01 @TheJusticeDept @POTUS @FoxNews Maybe @POTUS needs to emphasize that "peaceful assembly" is okay. Coming to an assembly armed and armored clearly shows intent on violence.
@PatriciaMSpenc2 @ExoticCatLady @VitsikaGames @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Patricia, sorry I have no idea of the context? Maybe you're not talking to me, or just sharing friendly info?
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro I'm sorry, you don't get to parse reality as you see fit, in the last "30 years" Trumps "never", and never becomes a subset within 30 years.
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro It is you that lie. And you falsely accuse others of doing so. And, you assume to know what motivates me, absolutely wrong again.
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Well, ya know Bill Clinton was charged with rape way back and the left is always quick to point out "not convicted", because he made a deal.
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro not a lie, technically accurate. Coke says, "Things go better with Coke." well, Pepsi doesn't, still it's not a lie, or is it?
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Oh, cool beans! So he wasn't convicted of racial discrimination some 43 years ago, supposedly. And this proves what exactly?
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro and that is 43 years ago, seems like the picture says 30 years!
@achemsrazor7 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro So, when is he supposed to get out of jail?
@VitsikaGames @PatriciaMSpenc2 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Okay, I've looked at that picture. What am I supposed to be seeing?
@VitsikaGames @PatriciaMSpenc2 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro was just waving/thanking crowd. But it looked just like he's doing the old nazi salute, does that make him a Nazi?
@VitsikaGames @PatriciaMSpenc2 @ExoticCatLady @WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Dear Lamp Post, HRC won nomination, her VP select standing on stage, picture on front page of newspaper. He was certainly...

Who's #astupider ?
@LeahR77 OMG, She makes statement that BHO was "...criticized for not coming down harder..." on BLM riots. rewrite: He said nothing. #MAGA
@MelissaJPeltier @fusedcanadian @ananavarro @NesrineMalik lol, she didn't even block me!
@MelissaJPeltier @fusedcanadian @ananavarro @NesrineMalik Typical, not a single point of truth there.
@CASuperrunner @ananavarro Sounds like the Charlottesville City Council set this up to happen, permitted 2 BLM events around a already scheduled event. #SetupWars
@Abyssdreamr @ananavarro Ya, she's a real American hero isn't she... So glad we have @realDonaldTrump and we are #MAGA
@Johnps302 @ananavarro I hate to like this because #BlueLivesMatter as #AllLivesMatter, but I do support the point you make.
@tamtype @ananavarro Sorry, study history, first I'd point you at #BeerSummit, then the founding and history of #KKK
@emma_rn92em @tamtype @ananavarro Better watch out, the lib police are gonna toss you for not using "they're". Understanding is in the ears that hear, and I hear you.
@CaptParker1775 @CherylMerson @ananavarro Oh, the left can speak for all, sense emotion and intent, a possess several other seemingly magical powers.
@fusedcanadian @MelissaJPeltier @ananavarro @NesrineMalik You think negativity, hatred, and division are "bravery"? Maybe that deserves a rethink???
@tinkerrn71 @Tracydwyer7 @SgtBear3 @ananavarro Spelling might count for something too.
@SgtBear3 @h0p3n3v3rd13s @ananavarro Not mention #ObamaDontCare and $20 trillion in debt??
@PoppyLane_ @ananavarro Never trust a person that smiles while wearing a frown
@boundlessa @WMB72buckeye @ananavarro "They" are everyday growing too, It keeps getting better in the U.S.A. and it's becoming impossible to ignore.
@SusanIverach @freedm_of_spch @ananavarro To protect us from the "tyranny of the masses", or in this case tyranny of voter fraud.
@freedm_of_spch @ananavarro Oh, you forgot to subtract the estimated 25,000,000 illegal votes cast just in CA. All the biggest blue counties have over 100% reg voters.
@AnnettePendleb4 @Trumpster4Trump @hrenee80 @ananavarro Hypocrites all, I say! Violence is an ignorant mans last attempt at communication.
@SusanIverach @rumble626 @justdawn_ @PibbleGal @ananavarro Opps, that doesn't fit into their narrative. Please keep that hush, hush.
@WeWon2016 @CommonSenseinTN @PatriciaMSpenc2 @Trump45_USA1st @SparkleSoup45 @ananavarro Yep, the left notices race, color, religion, party, etc... first, the right notices actions first. A #FundamentalDifference

@KORANISBURNING @joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 And, more importantly me thinks, why does the #MSM continue to treat it exactly as that?
@rmck51337 @realeftypickit @momofmonday It is such a waste that so many just parrot what 3 minutes time on @CNN or @MSNBC would yield.

@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca Maybe you should try it sometimes, thinking can be helpful, especially before you talk.
@FactsVsOpinion @azrn1999 @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca Good, we do agree on something. Why all the personal insults?
@FactsVsOpinion @azrn1999 @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca That is really just a foolish statement.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca @POTUS No, I think calling half Americans insane idiots is not helpful to #MAGA
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca lol, now I belong to a cult? #MAGA sounds just what TR was talking about as being patriotic, don't ya think?
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca @POTUS Oh, just noticed what you called me, not very nice. btw, why do you think it is okay to steal?
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca @POTUS Yes, so how does #MAGA oppose this?
@FactsVsOpinion @azrn1999 @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca COTUS was the compromise, it is the center, it is not right of center.
@FactsVsOpinion @azrn1999 @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca I hope you do choose COTUS over POTUS when they become opposed. Keep in mind though...(cont)
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Great song! I find it humorous how the whole anti-establishment group has gotten turned around and now defends it.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca Ah, insult and diversion, an expected tactic. Back to your super powers, they seem to be growing, now you know what was clear to all.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews That is not at all what she said. She hopes he will understand him, in the end she says we need a regime change.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca and again, now you claim to know how I voted? Really, I think you give me too much credit stating I have super powers, when it seems you do.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca Ya, sarcasm is tough to discern in text, but it's always a good fall back for someone that is clearly wrong.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca I support Trump, yes, because he is my @POTUS, just as I supported BHO before. It is apparent that someone needs to school you.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca ...as I was not the one claim to know what 62,000,000 people "...WANT..."
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca Okay, you stated "...they WANT it." in reply to a nuclear war comment. As per usual, you see in me what is in yourself...

@FactsVsOpinion @azrn1999 @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca So, Insane Idiots is the assessment? Hard to understand? Why don't you try the hard thing it usually leads to growth.
@azrn1999 @FactsVsOpinion @jennebehre @HotShot_78 @elusivebecca I guess maybe the Humor got the best of you? Clearly no Intelligence or Truth came out.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump I am very serious about this. I strongly suggest you watch this short video.	blob:https://t.co/LqHDmUXGEZ
@marymauldin @LDesopo @POTUS True enough. #MAGA
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump The problem is junior and you're focused on the parent. Maybe the parent has faults, but the real immediate issue right now is junior.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump But you do care, in fact it's all you seem to care about. What @realDonaldTrump is doing and why he's doing it.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING @realDonaldTrump Like the spouse, saying we need to let junior be, he'll be alright if we just relax and let him vent, he probably doesn't really mean it...
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING But, if you start off assuming I'm doing it for pomp, to act tough, be the man, whatever, which is what you are doing with @realDonaldTrump
@joann_cubberly @KORANISBURNING @Ebola6673 No, Mexico is not threatening to nuke say the U.K.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Then and only then, I'd talk to him about us speaking to a 3rd party(a shrink) to work out what was REALLY wrong.
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Meanwhile I'd make plans to get the gun away from him, and do so at the very first chance.(cont)
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING That there would be very serious consequences for continuing down the path he'd been considering.(cont)
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Yes, pretty much so. I would let junior know in no uncertain terms that what he was saying was serious.(cont)
#DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #LockThemUp https://t.co/nnKDxsFL7e
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Oh, and I forgot to mention, junior is not alone, he has a billion friends right outside his window to stop you...
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Sounds pretty threatening to me, he might take it wrong and shoot you instead? He feels all alone you know?
@joann_cubberly @KORANISBURNING @Ebola6673 @SebGorka My heavens, why do you spend so much time and effort psychoanalyzing our leadership, and none on the real nutcase here?
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING So, @realDonaldTrump is unhinged but not NK Ldr?
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Okay, so perhaps we agree, take junior's gun away and give him a talking to about peace and love, and such things?
@KORANISBURNING @joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 I think we were given a clue, when @SebGorka refered to us as a "Hyper-Power", as in something coming at hyper-sonic speed???
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Well, taking your lead, I wouldn't tell the parents to ignore junior and maybe give him more guns to take to school.
I've noticed this as well. #MAGA https://t.co/eyalLkKwIM
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING Okay, the son comes home with a gun, says he's gonna take it to school and shoot up the lot of them. What is your advice to the parent???
@joann_cubberly @Ebola6673 @KORANISBURNING It was when Clinton dealt, Bush and Obama ignored, but now, no it is not. It is real. So the question is, what side are you on?
@Rubysayzz Ya, a big part of this problem sadly is mainland China. They swarmed over the border and created this split peninsula.
