Jordan, insanely, wouldn't admit Trump lied about the Trump Tower Moscow. He says it's Cohen's word against the president's. But Trump has admitted he pursued the Moscow deal ("very legal, very cool.") Even Trump effectively admits he lied. But Jordan won't take him at his word.
Jim Jordan, who he lied multiple times while calling Cohen a liar, got to go on Meet the Press and repeat one of those lies. He says the Steele dossier "was the basis for this whole crazy investigation to begin with." Todd to his credit called this out. But why have Jordan on?
He also testified that you participated in a criminal conspiracy to commit fraud and lied repeatedly under oath. https://t.co/b15vklqArI https://t.co/QKVM5o2BM5

House Oversight members failed today to ask Cohen about the $500k he was paid by a US fund that mostly invested money for oligarch Viktor Vekseberg. Or what Cohen knows about the firm’s CEO, who is Vekselberg’s cousin, giving 250K to the Trump inaugural. https://t.co/IRPZ344dFg

I can tell that Cohen teared up when Cummings mentioned Cohen's family because all the photags stood up and started clicking.
Jordan just lied, or at least said something inaccurate, in the course of accusing Cohen of lying. https://t.co/1Z32Saj5mw
Jordan says Cohen inaccurately wrote in a committee form that he didn’t get payments from foreign entities. This is wrong. Cohen said, and Republicans AGREED, that Cohen was required to disclose only payments from foreign governments in the form,  not companies.
Cohen said that Trump fraudulently used his charity to receive a $150,000 fee for a 15 Skype speech to a group run by Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk. The Times reported last spring that Mueller is investigating this transaction. https://t.co/lBtnRyHhML
Cohen says Trump told him that he won't release his tax returns because it would allow tax experts at think tanks to review Trump's taxes, resulting in AN AUDIT and tax penalties.
Cohen on Trump's claims he can't release his taxes due to an IRS audit: "I presume he's not under audit."
The president and his son and CFO were involved in a criminal conspiracy...?	Cohen: "Yes."
Cohen also says Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr. or Weisellberg would have received his false invoices and paid him.
Cohen says he believes that Donald Trump Jr. is "Executive 2" mentioned in Cohen's court docs.
Meadows told Cohen earlier that the form required him to list not just foreign gov payments but also those from foreign entities. That turns out to be wrong.
Cohen said that his lawyers have advised him that the language of the "truth in testimony" form he filled out only covers foreign governments. Cummings also says the form does not cover foreign "entities." Republicans seem to have misrepresented what the form asks for earlier.
Cohen's lawyer "drafted the document, and no one adjusted time frame" the person said. "Time frame" here is how long the Trump org pursued the Moscow deal.
Cohen's said Trump lawyers reviewed and EDITED his perjurious statement to Hill committees re Trump Tower Moscow. He named Abbe Lowell and Jay Sekulow among the lawyers who reviewed it. A person familiar with Trump's legal team said Sekulow reviewed but did not edit the document.
More trouble for Trump Jr.: Cohen testified that he briefed the Trump family (He said this meant Ivanka &amp; Don Jr.) about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow "approximately 10 times." Trump Jr. told Senate Judiciary he was only "peripherally aware of" the deal. https://t.co/PdHkhQXGoR https://t.co/w5gkV1WJXk
Hey @RepChipRoy, Mother Jones is not a "known conservative magazine." Bone up.
Delegate Stacey Plaskett suggests Gaetz face a House Ethics Committee and criminal investigation for his tweet seemingly trying to blackmail Cohen into not appearing.
Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) was waiting to tell Mark Meadows how she feels about his use as a wedding planner turned HUD official Lynn Patton to deny Trump's racism. "To prop up one person from our entire race of black people and say that nullifies it is totally insulting."
*not once tried, I mean.
For all their attacks on Cohen's character, Republicans have once not tried to challenge this totally credible, evidence-backed claim. Everyone believes this. That's big, because Cohen's story implicates the president, and his son, in a year-long criminal conspiracy.
Cohen says he arranged with Trump and Allen Weisselberg for Trump to reimburse him for the $130K hush payment to Stormy Daniels in installments over 12 months "in order to hide those payments" --ie deceive the FEC/voters. Cohen has copies of checks backing this.
You can tell half intelligent member's of Congress because don't read a statement/question even though it's already been said or asked just because they already wrote it. Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.V.) is failing this test.
Cohen is knocking down myths: Says he never went to Prague and that there's no elevator tape.
Where we are now is Cohen explaining that he recorded calls with the current president about hush money payments to porn figures because he knew that Trump was going to stiff the CEO of the National Inquirer's parent company after he paid for the womens' stories to silence them.
Cohen says that Abbe Lowell,	Kushner’s lawyer,  also reviewed his statement in which he lied to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal.
This seems like a clear violation of the gag order in  Stone's case. It bars Stone from communicating with press about his case -- and Judge Jackson explicitly warned Stone against that. WikiLeaks is part of his case. https://t.co/9di2hyUpZc

Dems using their time to point out that Republicans did no oversight of Trump for two years and are hypocrites are right, but they are wasting time on a argument that the president would probably prefer to them drilling down on his crimes and financials.

Meadows sort of slammed down his list of questions in a gesture of frustration after failing to get Cohen to answer his question of whether Cohen after contacted members of the administration on behalf of his clients.
Cohen said that Trump decided to make the $130,000 hush money payment after speaking "to a couple of friends" and deciding that "it's $130,000. It's not a lot of money."
What the hell is Lynn Patton doing here? When did she get out of that elevator?

Gaetz has returned, just went over and whispered with Rep. Mark Meadows, ahead of Meadows' questioning of Cohen. Not sure Gaetz's expression of remorse for his tweet yesterday was 100% genuine.
Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) tried to argue that Cohen's claims that Trump lied about his financials are not credible because Cohen admitted to bank fraud. This is undermined by Cohen providing written documents he got from Trump. Was Green saying Cohen forged them?
"Mr. Trump's desire to win would have him work with anyone," Cohen says.		This seems like a good summation of why Trump accepted Russian help.
After backing behind a sign that partly hid him from press and photographers, @mattgaetz left the hearing room once Dem questioning started.
First Dem questioning is by Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Shultz, who notes she was affected by the Russian hacks/WikiLeaks releases.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, fresh off his threat to expose Cohen's "girlfriends" and quick apology, is standing by the GOP side of the hearing room while Jordan questions Cohen. Gaetz is not a member of the Oversight Committee.
Cummings, who warned Cohen at an earlier personal conversation against lying today, repeats the warning in public. "We will not tolerate lying to Congress by anybody. We are in search of the truth."
Cohen says Trump's tweets attacking him were "encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family."
Weisselberg is cooperating with prosecutors in the Southern District and got immunity. Trump Jr. looks screwed on this, among other things.
Cohen seemingly just implicated Trump Jr. and Weisselberg and in a criminal conspiracy to break campaign finance laws. (This was not in his initial prepared statement we got.)
Cohen notes other checks reimbursing him for the payment of hush money were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg.
Cohen reads aloud his claim that Trump knew in advance that Stone told Trump in advance about WikiLeaks' plan to release stolen DNC documents.
As Cohen read the “He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat...” part of his testimony, Jordan ostentatiously leaned back and said something to an aide. Appeared a deliberate effort to ignore criticism of Trump. Sums up his approach.
Jordan made some legit points about Cohen being a liar and about Davis' role, but he then repeats the discredited claim that the Steele dossier was the basis for the FBI starting the Trump Russia investigation. There's no evidence that's true. Jordan just falsely insists on it.
Rep. Jordan starts his attack: "This is the Michael Cohen hearing choreographed by Lanny Davis."
Cummings says that questions to Cohen will not be restricted, but committee will have to respect limits on this answers in areas where there are ongoing DOJ investigations.
Rep. Meadows opens by arguing that Cohen's testimony and exhibits were not available 24 hours early and objects to holding the hearing. Democrats will vote motion down.
Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) tells press that previously announced limits on members asking Cohen about Trump and Russia are "null and void now' because Cohen "goes into Russia" in his opening statement.

In 2017, Trump supported the Saudi and UAE led blockade of Qatar. Qatar’s top ask last year was to get him to stop doing that. And their sovereign wealth fund is run by the state. So Trump suggesting they fund an inaugural donor’s project is extortive.
Also Haney is saying that Trump personally encouraged a foreign country seeking presidential favor to fund a private business of a major inaugural and GOP donor. A longtime Dem donor, Haney switched to mostly GOP after Trump’s election. https://t.co/P0HIKOshnD
Haney’s story is pretty clearly not the whole story, but even what he admits creates the appearance that Trump’s intervention was tied to Cohen’s hiring. (Haney denies this). https://t.co/P0HIKOshnD
Right after his encounter with Trump, Haney says, he sailed his yacht from Palm Beach to Miami, where the Qataris were holding a conference. Then Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, randomly showed at marina where the yacht was, and offered to help Haney pitch the Qataris.
Now Haney tells the Daily Memphian that his talks with Qatar began when Trump walked up to his table at Mar-a-Lago with a Qatari official, and said Qatar, which has a massive sovereign wealth fund, could fund the nuclear power project. https://t.co/w4rdfg5M5A
We reported last year that a Qatari official met in April with Michael Cohen and Franklin Haney, who was seeking federal approvals and Qatari money to develop an inoperative nuclear plant near Memphis. Haney hired Cohen to help broker the deal. https://t.co/TFZK05ON3n

Jacob Engels, who Stone says had access to his phone on the day of the Instagram post, and was with him in court today, won’t say if he selected the photo.
Stone avoids jail. "Any violation of this order will be a basis for revoking your bond."
This was pretty much a forgone conclusion. He still gets to raise money for his legal defense fund and to assert innocence. "You apparently need clear boundaries so here they are."

Stone says that Engels had his phone on the day of the threatening Instagram post. And that Engels has his Instagram login information. Again, Engels is in the courtroom. They could call him.
Pressed under cross examination to name the 5 or 6 volunteers who assist him, one of whom he says found him the image of Judge Jackson he posted on Instagram, Stone names two. The first is Jacob Engels, a far right Florida blogger. Engels is in the courtroom behind Stone.

Jackson in this hearing and the last one, was clearly irked by Downing's effort to cite his cross-examination of Gates' and the comments one juror made. Jackson scolded Downing, noting he incorrectly described a news report and that it's not evidence anyway. https://t.co/fa0bxWjFFb

@DavidCornDC Burr has not paid full attention to Manafort secretly meeting with Kilimnik, a Russian intel associate, apparently at the behest of an oligarch close to Putin, no. The committee never questioned Manafort about it. Or Gates. https://t.co/pTfGAW0hnp
White House aide Alexander Butterfield disclosed the existence of Nixon's taping system at a televised Senate hearing, under GOP questioning. (RIP Fred Thompson.) A hearing like this would not happen now. https://t.co/1gvOqKdXqS
Burr has also brushed off calls for public hearings. Senators preen at hearings, sure. But having them, or threatening to, is the committee's best tool to force disclosure. People are less likely to plead the Fifth if it's televised.
The Intelligence Committee agreed to limit the scope July 25, 2017 interview of Manafort to questions about the Trump Tower meeting. They never interviewed him about Kilimnik, the peace plan, Rusisan sanctions etc. And they never subpoenaed him to try to compel more corporation.

Broidy's efforts, which include hiring a forensic IT firm, have exposed what seems to be extensive Qatari cyber snooping (occurring in competition with Emirati/Saudi efforts) but his suits don't do much to show the guys he's suing were in on the hack. https://t.co/U3WgKC4TGN

Broidy, who spends a fortune on lawyers and PR, has a new law firm for suit #3. Steptoe &amp; Johnson replace Boies Schiller.

Investigating somewhat disparate issues through a broad investigation into security clearance problems seems like a sensible move by Cummings. It lets him look into a broad swath of Trump scandals in one probe that isn't easy to dismiss as frivolous. https://t.co/RfIQN71F4T
"This will not stop us from getting to the truth.  We expect Mr. Cohen to appear before both Committees, and we remain engaged with his counsel about his upcoming appearances.”
Schiff and Cummings: “When our Committees began discussions with Mr. Cohen’s attorney, not appearing before Congress was never an option. We will not let the President’s tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities."
The letter also seeks more information on what National Security Advisor John Bolton did or didn't disclose when getting a top level clearance about his bizarre appearance in a gun rights video used by Maria Butina. https://t.co/6z4A32B4O8 https://t.co/WAdHi3s02B

Still, here comes the part where Trump backers use Carr's partial denial to pretend that we don't already know that Trump lied to the entire country about Trump Tower Moscow.

Manafort claimed in January 2017 that he was using intermediaries to people administration appointments from Trump. https://t.co/qaCa6pzaL3
This is super complicated. But the bottom line is that someone seems to have effectively paid Manafort at least $125,000 in 2017. (Manafort claims otherwise.) And Manafort used an opaque scheme to mask the payment, then repeatedly lied about it, Mueller says. Who paid him &amp; why?
The filing suggests that the SuperPAC was owed money, a commission fee, by an ad firm or some vendor, which is normal. But the SuperPAC told the vendor to pay Manafort's creditor (perhaps his lawyers) instead of just paying it, allegedly because they owed him $. That's shady.
The entity that directed someone that owed it money to pay that money to someone Manafort owed money is reportedly Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump SuperPAC set up by Trump pal Tom Barrack and run by Manafort cronies Laurie Gay and Ken McKay. https://t.co/n3gkfb7dEo
This heavily-redacted Manafort breach filing may indicate that the mystery firm Manafort owed money to, and which received $125,000 through a complicated transaction from another entity who Manafort claims owed him money, was Manafort's counsel. https://t.co/N34uYxoQIc

Hinted at here are outlines of an accord. Russia helps Trump get his Trump Tower Moscow deal and use campaign polling to target pro Trump social media messaging; in exchange they get help with US sanctions related to Ukraine. The RNC platform changes are a sort of down payment.
Now we have the chairman of the Trump campaign involved in giving polling data to an alleged Russian agent and talking to him about helping Russia get favorable deal with the US in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian peace plan, which was a pro-Russian effort, was pushed by the same guys, Cohen and Sater, seeking the Trump Tower Moscow deal. This disclosure further exposes some of the quid pro quo. Kremlin help with the Trump Tower deal for Trump campaign help on Ukraine.
Manafort talked about the "Ukrainian peace plan" with Kilimnik during the campaign, per the redactions in his filing. This is a big deal. It hasn't been reported that either of these guys were involved in that effort, which was known to have been pushed by Cohen/Sater. https://t.co/VyWkFKL4Pe

Manafort had super shady meetings with Kilimnik during the campaign. https://t.co/Z0lB4A8tMz; https://t.co/oO72ym6VCx. Kilimnik is reputedly a former member of the GRU, which did the hacks, who has active Russian intel ties. And he passed messages between Manafort and Deripaska.
Manafort allegedly lying about his meetings and interactions with Kilimnik seem like the most significant piece of Mueller submission. Manafort to Kilimnik to Russia is the most likely means of collusion between teh campaign and Kremlin. https://t.co/bk74AvBcHm
This may be the most significant line in Mueller's Michael Cohen memo https://t.co/iDT4mcPV0q

This is the US Attorney for the Southern District of Manhattan sentencing memo for Cohen. Not Mueller.
"For these reasons, the Office respectfully requests that this  Court  impose  a  substantial  term  of  imprisonment,  one  that  reflects  a modest downward variance from the applicable Guidelines range." https://t.co/XmwaOcrJkA

The Russians were aware of this. The Kremlin lied last year by claiming they didn't get back to Cohen when he emailed Peskov. https://t.co/YvxKlIie3Q
@politisteve @epicciuto From at least December 2015 through August 2017, https://t.co/wB2jiryel3, not 2016, the Kremlin had the ability to expose that Trump lied about having business in Russia during the campaign.

Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, said the defense may seek discovery in the course of contesting that Manafort lied. Given Manafort remaining in the joint defense agreement with Trump, this could amount to Trump’s lawyers getting to see at least some of what Mueller has.
This is separate from a sentencing memo they will presumably have to submit later, but they will have to explain how they know Manafort lied to them, which may mean showing their hand a bit.
Mueller’s prosecutors agreed in court today to file a motion by December 7 laying out why Manafort breached his cooperation deal.

Allaham’s lawyer, Craig Engle of Arent Fox, said that the contract with Dershowitz called for the famous lawyer to provide advice on “cultural, international relations, and legal issues.” Dershowitz says he only gave legal advice.
Joey Allaham, a ex kosher restaurant owner turned lobbyist for Qatar, said in 6/19  deposition that he had contracted with Dershowitz for the attorney to provide him with “advisory and consulting” services “in many matters that involved [the] Middle East, especially Israel.”
Alan Dershowitz has been advising the White House on the Middle East peace process. A recent lawsuit revealed he also had a contract with a lobbyist for Qatar. https://t.co/0nSDmCQpV0

Trump lacks the power to "fire everybody right now" but he's admitting there that he feels politically constrained from attacking the Mueller investigation.
Trump on Mueller investigation: "I could fire everyone right now. But I don't want to stop it, because politically I don't like stopping it."
More threats from Trump on Democrats investigating him: "If that happens, then we're gonna do the same thing." 	He's the president. Who does he think he is going to investigate? The Senate is going to investigate the House?
"They look at us; we look at them." He's trying to use threat of Senate investigations to blackmail House Democrats into not investigating him. Are McConnell, Grassley, et al. down for that? https://t.co/4MCUYpbZGE
Immediately surpassed by his claim that getting blown out in House is better than keeping a majority.
Trump attacking members of Congress he dragged down for trying to stay away from him is the most aggressive rationalization ever televised.

Dodik is as pro-Russian a leader as they come. Russia backs his separatist efforts, and allegedly trained a paramilitary group he uses as a security detail, because he opposes Bosnia joining NATO and complicates EU candidacy. Not a great endorsement. https://t.co/VXba8cTvQf
Does Dodik think Serbian Americans care who he tells them to vote for? It's more likely his intended audience is Trump and GOPers he hopes will support his separatist plans, even though those break with 25 years of US policy in the Balkans and risk war.
Dodik, like Hungary's Orban is also an enthusiastic backer of Steve Bannon's plan to support far right populist/nationalist movements in Europe. Bannon's plan dovetails with Russian foreign policy. https://t.co/UEu8Swig5i https://t.co/FXTSoD8oOO

He's doing this while acting as Trump's top lawyer in a scandal over illegal foreign influence efforts. He doesn't care how it looks. It's amazing.
It's absurd to argue Rudy wasn't partly addressing Americans to advocate regime change in Iran. Which makes him a foreign agent.
Giuliani says he doesn't need to register because he doesn't lobby Trump/US gov directly. But FARA says you have to register if you're paid to promote US policy that benefits a foreign entity's. On Sat, Rudy advocated regime change in Iran to a crowd at Times Sq hotel, for a fee.
The letter noted that Giuliani has been paid for years by MEK, which was long designated as terror supporter the State Dept, and that his calls for regime change in Iran support the group's agenda. That is exactly what he urged Saturday, for $. https://t.co/NDyStpsUte
Giuliani called Sat for regime change in Iran while being paid by an Iranian opposition group. He did that despite Dem senators recently citing his work for an Iranian group, and other clients, in a letter asking DOJ to investigate if he's violating FARA. https://t.co/yyWKP3pYqs

@MiekeEoyang But I think it okays Kavanaugh splitting hairs in a way that was not fully forthcoming. His answer probably should have been that he did some legal analysis that arguably relates to the program he was asked about. The honesty bar for SCOTUS nominees should be high.
@MiekeEoyang So @MiekeEoyang argues Kavanaugh's email doesn't contradict his sworn statements because he was contemplating the legality of a domestic effort different than the NSA's actual eventual wiretapping program, which he may not have known about. This is a fair point in his favor.

There have been like 47 articles by Byron York et al. asserting that the agents who interviewed Flynn initially believed him, so somehow that means he didn't lie. That is nonsense. It just means he lied convincingly, as effective liars do. But evidence falsified his claims.

A federal judge in the lawsuit by the Big3 basketball league, co-owned by Ice Cube, against Ahmed Al-Rumaihi and Qatari ex-investors in the league ordered the sealing of a filing that includes a claim by one of Al-Rumaihi's lawyers that he remains a senior Qatari gov official. https://t.co/tS8MeHa6DU
I asked Dershowitz about these seemingly inconsistent statements. He said he hadn't used the word "duped" and did understand the Qatar government arranged his trip. But "I didn't know the scope of the planning behind it," he said.
If someone tells you they have "a relationship with the Qatari government," then flies you to Doha to meet with the Qatari Emir, who explains his foreign policy to you, and then you write a positive op-ed about Qatar, would you suspect you were part of a state-lobbying effort? https://t.co/THDlj37uv8
We quoted Dershowitz saying that Joey Allaham, who first approached him about a trip to Doha (at Shul) told Dershowitz that "he had a relationship with the Qatari government." https://t.co/ixWLbinRZB
Journal writes: "Some of the people who traveled to Doha—including Mr. Dershowitz—say they feel duped because they hadn’t known the trips were part of a state-lobbying effort."
Dershowitz says he didn't discuss Qatar with Trump. But, assuming that is true, does anyone think that stopped people who arranged for Dersh to go to Doha and meet the Emir from touting his presence in the White House as a deliverable for Qatar?
Dershowitz, we reported, was also in the White House, all day, on the same day the Emir of Qatar was there meeting with Trump. Dershowitz was there to advise on Middle East policy and dined with Trump. https://t.co/2iJRR6jD7u https://t.co/yyF2HstwpI
Worth noting: Dershowitz went to Qatar at least twice, with his travel/board paid. He also would not say if he was paid for a speaking engagement on his second trip, which of course suggests he was.
Yesterday's WSJ story on Qatari lobbying https://t.co/WXT7gK47cP covers some ground -Dershowitz, Huckabee, Mort Klein- that @Hannah_Dreyfus and I did in June. They of course have new stuff. But if you're interested in this topic, read ours too: https://t.co/2iJRR6jD7u
Since we reported that he joined that junket to Qatar and was paid $50K, https://t.co/FFL3fY1dHH Huckabee, while voluble, has not once commented on or addressed the matter. Maybe with the Journal and others flagging it again, Gov. Huckabee will feel moved to explain himself. https://t.co/D723ohiE45

By not even credibly threatening to make Trump associates testify in public hearings on Trump-Russia ties, Burr, Grassley and other GOP chairmen give up their power and ensure their investigations are half-assed.
That's why Burr, McConnell, Grassley Ryan, Gowdy, Nunes refuse to hold public hearing with Trump associates. The hearings would likely be revelatory and damaging to the GOP.  So Republican refusal to hold hearings is politicized. And it serves to help cover up the scandal.
And public hearings shed light on the conduct investigated. Trump Jr. explaining why he lied about the Trump Tower meeting is a dose of sunlight that doesn't occur with closed door testimony.
The main power of congressional investigators, who can't indict people, is to hold public, televised hearings. They're not just an opportunity for grandstanding, but a tool to extract information and force people like Kusher to cooperate and explain themselves.
“If the intent is to have a show trial, I’m not a participant,” Burr says on public hearings. This is a GOP talking point/excuse for not holding hearings. https://t.co/6rEDE1RhAw

@lrozen She protests too much. Her Credico set up claim is unserious. 1. She just parroted Cuomo's q there. 2. It's impossible, even if you exclude Guccifer. Credico got Stone to tweet about Podesta/lie about Assange access? 3. Were it possible, Credico is not the guy to pull it off.
@emptywheel Lived in his home, in fact. I guess a better way for me to have put that is that Stone's argument that Mueller is wasting time with Davis because she didn't work for him in 2016 is inconsistent with Davis supporting Stone's no collusion claims. She either knows stuff or doesn't.

Manafort had motive (winning election, Deripaska debt, financial probs) and means (Kilimnik’s contacts with Deripaska and allegedly Russian intel). He’s accused of tax evasion, bank fraud, lying to everyone. Maybe he didn’t conspire with Russia. But why wouldn’t he have? https://t.co/6TBNmEfbVl
Just a few weeks ago, an unsealed FBI warrant application, first reported by Reuters, showed Deripaska had loaned Manafort and his wife $10 million. That’s in addition to another $10million or so Deripaska has claimed Manafort owes him.
Manafort’s early August 2016 meeting with Kilimnik in Manhattan, held so Kilimnik could pass on messages supposedly from Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska about issues important to his country seems potentially more significant than the Trump Tower meeting.
People may have forgotten a lot of stuff reported about Manafort that indicates he may have worked with Russia in '16. For example, he was in touch with Kilimnik, who Rick Gates supposedly once claimed was a former officer in the GRU, the agency accused of hacking the DNC.

The idea that Sessions recused from Russia, then Trump got mad is incomplete. Sessions recused; Trump got mad; then Sessions walked back his recusal and bent to Trump’s efforts to subvert the independence of the Justice Department for political ends.
The idea that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, with the implication that’s all he said he’d stay out of, is now common shorthand. But Sessions never specified the Russia probe. He said recusal covered all matters related “in any way” to ‘16 presidential campaigns.
Sessions said in March ‘17 and a nomination hearing that he’d recuse from all matters in any way related to the 2016 campaigns. That would have meant avoiding the Hillary email crap, McCabe firing and other things in which he’s involved himself in failed pursuit of Trump’s favor. https://t.co/bDBq7QeDAf
I quibble with this Times characterization. https://t.co/nAlewPIbYZ Sessions said he was recusing from all matters related to 2016 campaigns, not just the Russia probe. That’s important because he’s violated that pledge repeatedly. https://t.co/7uyV6wJCmg https://t.co/hZHf4wKuYD

Prosecutors also revealed that US Person 1 in court filings, who presumably is conservative activist Paul Erickson, has been investigated by feds for fraud, in a separate matter from the charges against Butina. Her residence was searched as result.
She’s imprisoned until trial.	Judge said preponderance of evidence supporting denying bond.
Without pausing to mull, Magistrate Judge Robinson orders Butina held without bond due to flight risk.
Butina’s attorney, Mr. Driscoll, also referenced her interactions with Alexander Torshin and the NRA, seemingly confirming the very obvious: Those are the unnamed Russian official and the gun rights group referenced in prosecutors’ filings.
In Butina hearing, (now recessed) Butina’s attorney says that she received a letter from the FEC on 3/12/18 asking about contributions to a political committee. This suggests an FEC inquiry into whether Russians steered illegal donations to Trump/GOP.

Gowdy voted "pass," which suggests he feels a bit cornered by the lack of any GOP effort to explain why they backed off Bannon.
Dems win small victory here by getting Republicans on two committees to vote NOT to (re)subpoena Bannon, who refused to comply with an Intel Committee subpoena at the WH's direction. This votes shows Republicans' unwillingness to bother the WH with a real investigation.
Strzok gets to add the context of the text: He says he was enraged Trump's attack on Khizr Khan, the father of a "fallen American war hero," comments that Strzok calls "disgusting" and "horrible."
@redsteeze He's evidently talking about what he believes he meant.
Strzok says he does not recall writing the "we'll stop" Trump from becoming president text, but that by we, he meant the American people, not he and the FBI, would stop Trump's election.

Here's one of the appendices to the IG that Crapo just mentioned. Respect to this reporter. https://t.co/dPpo7anpjr
RT @lrozen: Someone please ask Horowitz why Strzok was not right about whether Russia investigation priority over Weiner laptop.
Cornyn asks Horowitz if Comey, given his admission that he thought Clinton would win, was "thinking about his future" as FBI director under Clinton. Horowitz says maybe. But Comey made decisions that hurt Clinton because he didn't want seen as favoring her.
FBI Director Wray to Leahy: "I do not believe Special Counsel Mueller is on a witch hunt."
RT @lrozen: Nunes told Fox he was briefed by NY FBI agents in sept. 2016 too. https://t.co/ygXenpTqgl
Horowitz's report and his testimony says the IG couldn't find a good reason why the FBI waited a month to look into the Weiner laptop. But given that it turned out not to be important evidence, a better question is why they rushed to look into in October, on election eve.

Grassley complained that Feinstein wouldn't agree to subpoena Lynch and Comey. Weird because he still won't subpoena Jared Kushner, who refused to talk to the committee.
@CPAsheldon Yes.
Grassley: "Attorney General Lynch clearly should have recused herself and this lingering controvery proves it." The IG report in fact says that Lynch should have been more involved in reigning in Comey.
Grassley: "The contrast to the [the Russia] probe is very stark."	This is true, but not the way he means. The Russia probe remained secret. Comey repeatedly shared detail on the Clinton probe.
Grassley falsely says the reports shows Clinton got "kid glove treatment" from the FBI. The IG report concluded the Comey acted improperly in to publicize negative information about Clinton.
Horowitz strains for an even-handedness while presenting a report that actually shows the FBI's improper conduct in 2016 wholly benefited Trump, intentionally or not.
Horowitz faults Strzok and Comey, in particular. But IG found no evidence that Strzok, despite his dumb texts, improperly took investigative actions reflecting his anti-Trump views. Whereas Comey's improper actions were devastating to the Clinton campaign. https://t.co/ZhLbxP3Vpy

Qatar and their lobbyists have pursued a variety of approaches in the US, and smartly worked not just to seek support, but to reduce criticism. Their outreach to Jewish conservative leaders was mostly the second category. They at least got critics' volume turned down.
But for the Qataris, having Dershowitz at Trump's ear, talking about Mideast policy, after they made their case to him, is exactly what they pay big lobbying $ for. And Trump's rhetoric on Qatar has shifted sharply their way.
This is legal. And Dershowitz says he didn't discuss Qatar with Trump or White House staff and he insists his op-ed expressed his independent view, didn't push Doha talking points.
Allaham approaches invites Dershowitz at synagogue and conveys a personal invitation from Qatar's Emir to Doha. Dersh goes, then writes a nice op-ed. Goes again. Maybe gets paid for a speech.

Even this explanation were true, this is obviously a terrible thing to say.
In saying he wants "a Roy Cohn," Trump puts himself in the position of Joe McCarthy. He actually wants to emulate the greatest illiberal villain in US history. Meanwhile people go on TV and repeat his rhetoric ("Spygate") and defend his nonsense claims.
But as dumb as it is, Trump clearly does think of Cohn as some kind of model advisor. And the person Cohn most prominently advised is Joe McCarthy. Worth remembering when Trump backers compare investigations of Trump's Russia ties to McCarthyism.
Stone says he told comedian/ talk show personality Randy Credico to "prepare to die" not as threat resulting from Credico contradicting Stone's statements about his WikiLeaks contacts, but because Credico told Stone he had terminal cancer. Credico says he doesn't have cancer.
A crazy tangent of these Trump times is the idea of Roy Cohn as a model. Cohn caused McCarthy to attack the Army, the proximate cause of the McCarthy's destruction. Sure, Cohn became a big time NYC lawyer, but he was fundamentally a failure known for being a horrible human. https://t.co/nGhd1Btyi0

Broidy's wife, whose email was also hacked, is no longer a plaintiff in her husband's suit, a redlined version of the complaint shows. She withdrew after he acknowledged paying $1.6 to a Playboy Playmate who said he impregnated her. https://t.co/MC9HLB2iN7 https://t.co/H3SOvaCBbq
The complaint does not specify the basis for these allegations. And it appears to function at least partly as PR for Broidy, asserting he was targeted by Qatar due to his criticism of them. Omits reference to his contract with the UAE. So many grains of salt required here.
Broidy sued Kevin Chalker, the founder of Global Risk Advisors, CIA and David Mark Powell, who set up a Qatar office for that firm (reputedly former CIA and British Intelligence agents, respectively.) Claims they connected Qatar to other "cyber mercenaries." https://t.co/p1p6Wobw22
Elliott Broidy, the scandal embroiled GOP fundraiser, has filed an amended complaint in his lawsuit against Qatar and others for hacking and disseminating his emails. Broidy says Global Risk Advisors of NYC, through an office it opened in Qatar, was behind the hack. https://t.co/nUAy5hG0Ut

BGR's Birnbaum: "We were not aware and we are not aware. We have never worked with Michael Cohen. We do not know him. We are just learning about this as you are."
Ukrainian President Poroshenko's National Reform Council is represented in Washington by the BGR Group. BGR Group President Jeffrey Birnbaum says they know nothing about Cohen working with Ukraine's Porskenko to get a meeting with Trump.
Times had a Porshenko ally on the record saying that the shelving of their Manafort probe connected to seeking Trump's favor.  https://t.co/wU3Qrvwra2 https://t.co/iZ2HjrhQtI
"Ukraine's domestic intelligence service, the SBU, did their own - secret - report on Manafort. It found that there was not one 'black ledger' but three and that Manafort had been paid millions of dollars more from Ukraine than had been made public."
This report claims arms sales to Ukraine were part of a secret deal that involved the end of Ukraine's Manafort probe. https://t.co/Gs71T8NQMl
BBC: "A report by a member of a Western country's intelligence community says Poroshenko's team believe they have established a 'non-aggression pact' with Trump," by dropping the Manafort investigation.
Times reported on Ukraine dropping the Manafort probe, but didn't tie it to the Trump meeting, and Cohen. https://t.co/wU3Qrvwra2

@adambarken Don't need to wait for Congress on this. The transcript's online. Mueller could charge Prince with perjury tomorrow.
There's a good chance Mueller will get those materials regardless. But Prince has made it much easer for Mueller to charge him with perjury by agreeing to release his testimony, possibly just so he could show off by berating committee Dems.
Dems say they can't just give those transcripts to Mueller. They'd need consent from the Intel GOP members, who are busy trying to undermine the Mueller probe, not aid it.
House Intelligence Republicans reneged on a pledge to release transcripts of interviews from their probe. https://t.co/VYODJNyQ5b Except for the ones where witnesses, like Prince, said okay.
Prince in Nov agreed to allow the transcript's release. Then he went out of his way to spar with Dems, faulting questions, etc. Seems logical that was because he'd had success with that in '07, and thought a transcript of him arguing with Schiff would help Wyo GOP primary voters.
And Prince's 2007 testimony before the Waxman's House Oversight Committee, while seen many people as extremely damaging, made Prince a hero among the sort of military fanboy right. https://t.co/BXjEH5TuuO

Jackson's ruling probably won't stop Trumpers from repeating the talking point that none of the Special Counsel's indictments are related to Russia, but it is more evidence showing how dumb those arguments are. https://t.co/SP6cg7xxng

Jackson knocks down claims that Manafort's indictment isn't related to coordination with Russia in 2016. https://t.co/kcbdPdiKre
The ruling notes, as has been reported, that prosecutors suspected Manafort of colluding with Russia during the election and crimes related to his payments from Yanykovych. https://t.co/Qnqybhzp4y
"It was logical and appropriate for investigators tasked with the investigation of 'any links' between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign to direct their attention to him."
"Manafort was, at one time, not merely 'associated with,' but the chairman of, the Presidential campaign, and his work on behalf of the Russia-backed Ukrainian political party and connections to other Russian figures are matters of public record."

Trump Jr. got a call from a blocked number while setting up the Trump Tower meeting. His father reputedly used a blocked number. But House Intelligence Committee refused to seek phone records to check if Trump Sr. made the call and knew of the meeting. https://t.co/9kYWKAIfcZ
It's like they caught a guy with stolen property, interviewed him, then concluded there was no evidence of crime, because he said he found it.
The report today shows again that House Intelligence Committee's majority wasn't actually trying to find collusion. They were just trying to carry out enough interviews etc. to create a plausible impression of an investigation. They all but admit that. https://t.co/D67UNlCgK0
One of the problems with the GOP report is they don't have a theory of why the Russians and the Trump campaign appeared to cooperate, if in fact they didn't.
The Russians used many means to communicate to the Trump campaign that they wanted to help Trump and wanted a backchannel to talk about it. They did help him. They got backchannels. Why wouldn't they use the backchannels to communicate about the help they provided?
The GOP report today downplays Rob Goldstone's email to Trump Jr. which said the Kremlin supported Trump, citing Goldstone's claim he was exaggerating. But here is another message (indirectly) from Moscow seeking a backchannel while saying the Kremlin supported Trump.
Erickson is one of the potential witnesses who Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee did not try to interview, according to Dems.
Gun rights activist Paul Erickson in a May 10, 2016 to Jeff Sessions' aide Rick Dearborn: "For reasons that we can discuss in person or on the phone, the Kremlin believes that the only possibility of a true re-set in this relationship would be with a new Republican White House.” https://t.co/COVPwDmQdK

This refutes Trump backers’ claim that Manafort and Gates’ prosecutions have nothing to do with 2016. Manafort, and maybe also Gates, was in close contact with an ex-GRU guy with current Russian intel ties in the middle of the 2016 campaign.
Assuming this is Kilimnik, important to note the FBI believed he had Russian inteligence ties in 2016, when he was in frequent contact with Manafort and received Manafort’s offer to personally brief Deripaska on the race. https://t.co/9XKixJXve9
@nycsouthpaw Also raises the question of what the “no evidence of collusion” crowd think Kilimnik and Manafort talked about at their 8/2/16 meeting in Manhattan to which Kilimnik came bearing messages from Deripaska about the “future of his country.”
@nycsouthpaw I don’t think the “blow for me and you personally” was part of Weissman’s summation in Feb. Does seem substantial.
Though much of this came out at Van Der Zwaan’s plea hearing last month, https://t.co/cxTi6L62GF the Kilimnik GRU piece is significant. Manafort had cause (debt to Deripaska) and means (cryptic email exchanges and an Aug. 2 meeting in NYC) to collude via Kilimnik.

Burr said during the hearing that he'd asked his counsel and learned four people, excluding Russians, were indicted by the special counsel, two for lying to the FBI, two for a mix of wire fraud and bank fraud. Who is his counsel? This is super wrong.

Those GOP members left before questions, which might include whether they think the president is doing enough on election security and whether they accept the Intel community finding that the Russians sought to help elect Trump.
All members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, minus Sen. Blunt, I believe, showed up for this press conference on election security.  But Sens. Risch, Cornyn, Rubio, Cotton left within 10 minutes or so, meaning most of GOP is gone.
Didn't say which state.
Burr says "we know" the Russians "were successful in penetrating at least one state database."

But notably, there is no indication of any consequences for the Nunes staffers involved in leaking the texts, or any loss of access for HPSCI. Beyond Warner and Burr's complaint to Ryan and the publicity, there is not fallout, per Hill source.

Weissman made clear in court that “Person A” is not Manafort and that’s it’s a person who worked with Gates who lives primarily in Ukraine.
Van der Zwaan communicated with Kilimnik via an encryption program and, according to prosecutors, shared details of Skadden’s supposedly independent report with him without the permission of the senior partner overseeing the work. That would be former Obama WH counsel Greg Craig.

This position is based on an NRA view that no expansion of gun laws is acceptable. It's political. But their backers insist on trying to offer a policy rationale for why they urge more effective background checks but oppose a comprehensive background check system. It's funny.
Since then gun rights boosters have made a principle of this compromise. They are okay complaining the existing background check system doesn't work. (Because this allows arguing for "fixing" the law before expanding it.) But they won't agree the law should cover private sales.
In a political compromise that allowed passage of the Brady Bill, people buying guns from private sellers, those not registered as gun dealers, were exempted from background checks. That's sometimes called the "gun show loophole."
Something to look forward to in coming days is NRA apologists trying to articulate a policy rationale for why they support administrative tweaks to our existing patchwork background check system, but still oppose requiring background checks for private sales. https://t.co/0hhx3feo23

A place where cognitive tendencies cause problems is on whether Russian interference, or Trumpers colluding, affected the election result. We don't know. But people resist considering the possibility. So much of the commentary is not, "We don't know," but, "We don't know, so no."
But my main take is I don't know what happened. Almost no one does. It's possible we never will. And we all have to deal with that.
@epicciuto I find getting to a good balance of prototheorizing and admitted ignorance hard. Seems like journalism, compared to say science, lacks a discipline of being clear on known versus unknown. But good reporting requires understanding and exploiting that distinction.

The indictment today is not some conclusive finding on how the Russians interfered. It addresses a piece of a piece of their broader effort. https://t.co/ilwfBfrI8V https://t.co/0YExlzO6ju
@Suburban_Dems Almost certainly.
The indictment doesn't say no American colluded with the Internet Research Agency; just doesn't charge anyone with that now. More importantly, this tells us nothing about a potential conspiracy between Trump campaign/backers and Russians regarding the release of hacked emails. https://t.co/2EyAs4GQTh

This plea deal, with an American, suggests that when Rosenstein said "there is no allegation in this indictment that any America was a knowing participant in this activity" he meant literally meant "in this indictment."
Another Mueller plea: https://t.co/jubBOgYmfM:	https://t.co/xvzhMGGGq3 https://t.co/GD9KaRLCKy
Rosenstein: "There is no allegation in this indictment that any America was a knowing participant in this activity." This does not mean no Americans colluded with Russia. It means none are indicted for that today. But Trump and his apologists are about to pretend otherwise.
Rosenstein: Russians set up fictitious social media accounts "advocating for and against particular candidates." Which ones?
The NRA spent $6.2 million in 2016 on ads supporting Sen. Burr, for example. Seems worth bearing in mind when thinking about how willing  Burr, the Intelligence Committee Chairman, is to look into whether Russia funneled cash to back Trump through the NRA. https://t.co/1yX8Qg1MXA
True, gun advocates' grassroots intensity remains more important than NRA direct donations, a piffle. But the NRA spent way more in independent expenditures in 2016 than ever before; https://t.co/GBao0A3QPs Their electoral MO is changing. We'd err to overlook their spending. https://t.co/or4kQeZg5A

Gun violence restraining orders, where a judge can okay temporary removal of guns from people who threaten themselves or others, might be a step to combat mass shootings. Unclear how much effect they'd have, but there's evidence they reduce suicides. https://t.co/UnJPjXlQzZ

Who do lobbyists like Richard Burt, Trent Lott, or former Rep. John Sweeney https://t.co/iwZZpHOo4G contact when they work for Russian-state controlled banks or pipeline firms opposed to sanctions on Russia? We don't know, because they legally avoid registering as foreign agents.
Foreign lobbyists I talked to note that many, maybe most, foreign lobbyists don't register under FARA. The prosecution of Manafort/Gates on FARA charges bumped up registrations by increasing awareness of the law. But people eager who want to duck FARA can do so.
Flaw in the idea "the Mueller effect" is fixing FARA: The guys Mueller's hit with FARA charges, Manafort, Gates and effectively Flynn, were targets due to roles in the Trump-Russia scandal. Mueller didn't go looking for unregistered foreign lobbyists. https://t.co/PEUqmkHVJN

Cotton is acting like it's super cool that the United States or its allies killed a bunch of Russians in the middle of a congressionally-unauthorized US intervention in an incredibly messy, bloody civil war. https://t.co/j4x7vvojXE
After intel officials declined to publicly answer his question about how 200 Russian mercenaries may have been killed in Syria, Sen. Cotton, chuckling, asks if massing troops near a US installation is a bad idea - a heavy hint at a conclusion he was just told is classified.
Sen. Cotton's questioning of FBI Director Wray just appeared to backfire. Cotton noted Comey called the Steele memos "salacious and unverified," and asked if that remains the FBI's view. Wray does not agree. "I think that's something we can discuss more in a closed setting."
Sen. Angus King of Maine at Intelligence Committee hearing: "We cannot confront this threat, which is whole of government response when the leader of the government continues to deny that it exists."
FBI Director Wray on Trump's attacks on the bureau: "I encourage our people not to get too caught up on what I consider the noise on TV and on social media."
Wray says provided a partial report in March related to Porter, a completed report in July and then responded to the White House request for more information in November. Raises possibility that WH knew of Porter's ex's allegations in March 2017, almost a year before he resigned.
Wyden to Wray: "Was the FBI aware of allegations related to Rob Porter and domestic abuse, and if so, was the White House aware this could affect his security clearance, when were they informed and who at the White House was informed?
