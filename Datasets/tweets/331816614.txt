I refuse to surrender to tribalism; I believe in politics; I believe in compromise; I believe in democracy. And I actually want to save these kids and future ones.
I’m also an immigrant who knows firsthand how brutal, terrifying and traumatizing this process can be; which is why i believe in working with Republicans to reform it, as we did with HIV ban.
Trump is not Hitler; I am not Neville Chamberlain; i’m a passionate Never-Trumper who wants to solve a problem that is empowering white nationalism everywhere
Preventing illegal immigration is not racist, not white supremacist, not bigotry; it’s integral to any democracy functioning; it’s a core function of government. 		Slowing massive demographic change is not fascist; it's conservative.
If not, we go through this again in less than 20 days; more family separations; more suffering for children
But this time go big for a pressing humanitarian reason; give him the wall and get DACA + Flores fix + MUCH more funding for border/ detention facilities &amp; processing asylum cases
I know Trump eventually reneged on a deal for the wall and DACA in January; that doesn’t mean it hurts the Dems to try again
I’m gonna break my rule and respond on Twitter (God help me)
