@AdamSchiavone Adam,		Bless your heart.
@mississippi1962 My Mother and Mother-in-law are both in nursing homes. These decisions are difficult. We put in a feeding tube last week. 		We aren‚Äôt going to end either of their lives. We all decided to let them live, but each family is different.
@AdamSchiavone I asked what you thought about it. 		It‚Äôs still not your child, it‚Äôs theirs. 		By what right would you tell them they can‚Äôt?  It would be none of your business, right?		How would you feel about that?
@AdamSchiavone What are your feelings about terminating after birth?
@Erik_Da_Red @AuthorKimberley Life does not begin at birth. That is the entire point of the 10 before and 10 after. You can agree or disagree as you see fit. 		An abortion that is necessary to save the life of the mother is acceptable to me at ANY time. 		Not sure what else we disagree about.
@AdamSchiavone Do you agree that there should not be late term abortions except to save the life of the mother?
@Erik_Da_Red @AuthorKimberley Show me where I assigned any motives to anyone. 		I don‚Äôt think we should have any late term abortions unless the mother‚Äôs life is in danger. 		Can we agree on that?
@AdamSchiavone Adam, 		You say there are no late term abortions except to save the mother‚Äôs life. 		I know of nobody anywhere who has ever had a problem with abortions to save the Mother‚Äôs life. Nobody. 		But I do know of a certain Governor that suggests killing after birth.		The question: WHY?
@Erik_Da_Red @AdamSchiavone @AuthorKimberley I am. In fact I am making points. 		I have not seen any points from you, but lots of avoidance. 		Yelling ‚Äústraw man‚Äù is not a point.
@AdamSchiavone Yes. I did. 		It seems relevant, since we are discussing late term abortion.
@Erik_Da_Red @AuthorKimberley It is a true statement, and relevant to the discussion. 		If there is no Life, then there is nothing to discuss. If there is a living human, then it has rights. 		People disagree about when Life begins but once there is Life there are inherent rights, including the right to live.
@AdamSchiavone Adam, that‚Äôs not a circumstance. It is a philosophical point. The twenty minutes does not have some ‚Äúmagic spot‚Äù where life ‚Äúbegins‚Äù halfway through. The Life already exists.
@mississippi1962 @AdamSchiavone @AuthorKimberley My children were all born healthy. Of course it happens. And it is sad. 		Cancer is also sad. Nobody asks for bad things to happen, and nobody is happy when they do.

@Erik_Da_Red @AuthorKimberley Erik, I am curious if you can explain the Governor‚Äôs words and why you feel they represent a straw-man argument. 		What was Virginia‚Äôs Governor talking about?
@dvdjbrn @AuthorKimberley Dave, which of my sentences is a lie?
@AdamSchiavone @AuthorKimberley Adam, I would be interested in what you think the Virginia Governor meant by his comments about keeping the baby comfortable until the Mom decides. 		If this is life or death, what is he talking about?
@AuthorKimberley @BHussler For the record, you didn‚Äôt explain anything. But have a good day.
@AuthorKimberley @BHussler That was a separate question but I don‚Äôt know why it matters. 		Where do you get the right to interfere?  What they do with their two month old is none of your business, right? You are not the Parent.
@AuthorKimberley @BHussler Kimberley, why would a child that had been born be made ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù, awaiting a life or death decision from the mother?		If you understand then you can explain. Just give me the short version. What did the Governor mean?
@AuthorKimberley @BHussler What about the Governor of Virginia??  Yes, he IS.
@AuthorKimberley @BHussler A two month old is completely dependent on parents to survive. 		Do you feel you have a right to tell parents how to treat their children?		On what grounds?  It‚Äôs not your kid and none of your business, right?
@BHussler @AuthorKimberley Amanda, I would never be critical of any mother who aborted to save her own life. That sounds irrational. There is no guilt involved, so I don‚Äôt understand.
@AuthorKimberley Also, if nobody is suggesting that then I don‚Äôt know why the Governor of Virginia suggested keeping the baby comfortable after birth until the mother decides if it should live. 		Is he one of the exceptions?
@AuthorKimberley I‚Äôm not a Republican so please forgive me if I don‚Äôt know what they believe.
@BHussler @AuthorKimberley What right wing propaganda?
@BHussler @AuthorKimberley I believe society has a right to set limits on how parents can treat their children. Beatings, starvation, or sexual abuse are not a parent‚Äôs ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù.		I support the rights of all individuals, including those who don‚Äôt have power or a voice. Is that wrong?
@AuthorKimberley Good. Then let‚Äôs not have any unless the mother‚Äôs life is truly in danger. 		It is a horrible choice to have to end one life to save another. I wish nobody had to make that choice.
Disturbing, but there is obviously no reason to doubt him on this. https://t.co/pJMPXHDFhn
@AuthorKimberley Some people feel that before birth there is no human life. Some feel that human life begins at conception. 		I believe that 10 minutes before full term birth there is the same living human as 10 minutes after. 		If there is human life, then you cannot just kill it.

@barona5h Yes, that's probably what happened. They didn't read the question, they just picked the response that I wanted them to. 		Because I have that skill. 		And because that's how polls work.
@barona5h More precisely, Rep. King feels that taking the quote literally without the surrounding context is misleading. 		And the poll exists for the purpose of seeing how others feel about this news item. Too many details for a tweet. 		The poll suggests a strong plurality feel the same.
@barona5h I understand your point. 		I also think you are completely missing the larger picture here, but it's not my responsibility to correct that. 		Yes, everyone should have had every word. After all, Rep. King claims his comments are devoid of the slightest bit of what we all heard.
@rkaufmann1776 However, I certainly would encourage you to reserve judgement until you fully understand the exact parsing of every word. Maybe what he said was in no way related to the actual words he spoke. 		Maybe it was just out of context.		Or something.
@rkaufmann1776 You sound as though you may not be very familiar with Steve King. 		Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy have condemned Rep. King. They are NOT, um, liberal black female Democrats. 		Also, my followers are mostly White Conservatives and a strong majority strongly condemn him.
@barona5h How so? It's a news item, and people on Twitter are voting about how they feel about it. Skewed? I don't see how.

@digupdead So, you think our system of government doesn't give enough power to the Executive branch, and you support a shift of power by having Presidents use National Emergency powers to get things done. Hmmm.
@AnonymousViking I don't like government, and I don't trust them. They are DRUNK on DEBT, if you haven't noticed. I don't care about the wall but I DON'T need a federal government declaring a National Emergency to seize power to get what they want. 		At one time Conservatives agreed with that.

@KantBreal The tying of insurance to employment happened because of government wage &amp; price controls. Employers offered benefits bc they could not offer higher pay.

@Orion84M Three key actions: 	1) Eliminate ACA requirements that employers provide health care. 	2) Eliminate the tax deduction for employers who do so. 	3) Employers who drop required to give the $ to employee. 		Then,		Require providers to post prices or rates and charge all the same.
@Orion84M It removes individual free market decision making, and sets up a dysfunctional scenario where the unemployed pay more for health care services.
@repckelly I see this as a form of insurance for businesses to use to protect workers and themselves. As long as it is voluntary I don't see a problem.

@stl7thward @JesseLawder @publiceyestl @brucefranksjr @jmannies @tonymess Great question. I certainly hope there was but I can't say. Peter Kinder did a good job there but too many ignore city voters.
So far this morning I have showered and had coffee and checked emails.  Oh, and I cast an actual vote in Missouri for Austin Petersen for US Senate. 	@AP4Liberty So far, so good. https://t.co/mXJcUMXjD2
@lori52993 @JohnDingell He is paid. Then he donates his income.
@barlegtetr @TonyBaumstarck @JohnDingell There is a difference between the "country" and the "federal government".  The President runs the latter, not the former.
If you live in Wentzville please check out Tony Lovasco and vote for him tomorrow. https://t.co/bWnQw50ry0
@sher_wr @JohnDingell Sheryl, not all of us participate in the left/right tit-for-tat daily squabbles. Some of us look at things through a slightly less partisan lens. 		I suspect that IS confusing. 		Politicians don't run our lives. What they SHOULD do is actually make a Budget and follow it.
@wicked1121 @SykesforSenate @POTUS It is interesting what values different people hold dear. You put together a nice list, which I assume are the strong points for your candidate. 		Not listed: our $21 Trillion Debt, or our new $1 Trillion deficits. No mention of bloated Omnibus Spending Bills. üê∑		But cool.
@sher_wr @JohnDingell No point about Trump at all. 		Presidents are not kings and their job is not to "run the country".  We are free men and don't need their help. 		They can't even run the government properly, let's keep them away from the rest.
Are you voting in the Missouri Primary Election tomorrow?
@JohnDingell Trump is not paid to run the country well. 		He is paid to run the federal government well. 		Big difference.
@repckelly OMG I've never won anything before!		...except Student Council President my senior year. But that's just about it.

@abracadabraNY @MarlaMHughes Probably true. I think an employer should be able to hire all union, no union, or anything in between. And workers should be able to choose to join a union or not as they see fit, and work for an employer or not as they see fit. 		If that is Right to Work then I am for it.

@Ltjohn25 Vices are not Crimes. When you make them illegal you create the turf wars you mentioned.  		Alcohol is destructive. Drunk driving kills. It breaks up families and ruins lives, and always has. But no turf wars, because it is a Vice not a Crime.		Alcohol is bad, but not a crime.
@Ltjohn25 That's why we are a Republic, not a Democracy.
@Ltjohn25 Every time you adversely affect another human it is wrong. Stealing is a Crime. 		Every time nobody else is affected is it not a crime and not hurting anyone but you. 		That is still a bad thing, whether cigarettes or alcohol or heroin or meth. But if you smoke alone, no crime.
@JiggryPokery @Ltjohn25 Every time it affects another person it is a crime. Every time it doesn't it is not.
@Ltjohn25 Is it ok for the Majority to force cultural norms on the Minority?
@Ltjohn25 I can see where things that harm other people in some way would be crimes. Why is it a crime when I hurt myself, in the privacy of my own home. 		I can't see what difference what form the self abuse takes. What business is it of the government?
@Ltjohn25 What is the moral justification for having some vices be allowed and others crimes?		Is it just majority opinion?	Should we rely on experts?
@Ltjohn25 Yes. Agreed.
@KantBreal I will not be signing up. I am certain force will be used to make me comply.
@batmansos Yes. I think so.
@Ltjohn25 Vices are not good things, but by definition they do not infringe on your rights. 		Heroin and Meth and Crack are illegal and use is at epidemic levels. 		We need to help people stop using tobacco and alcohol, but banning them or trans fats or 44 oz sugary drinks helps nobody.

@If_Its_Magic @WendyRedFox @MissouriGOP I am trying not to suggest that there may have been impropriety involved, because to date there is no evidence of any crime. None whatsoever. Zero.
@WendyRedFox @MissouriGOP The Executive Committee voted to waive their own rule (Rule 11, I believe) against allowing GOP financial support to candidates prior to the Primary. 		Had this been an uncontested incumbent facing a Democrat challenge in the General it could be reasonable. 		Not the case here.

We just don't need anyone putting in "fixes" in political races. Not the other Party. Not the government or Russians or criminals. Not the Kochs or Soros. And not the Party in the primary. 		Why not just keep it fair?

@TomJEstes @MissouriGOP Not attacking or holding any grudge against any person. I was attacking an idea; a position.
@TomJEstes @Vets4AP A judge can and will have a personal opinion about each individual that comes before them. To help one side or another is to show bias. 		I don't see official advocacy in the primary as consistent with their role.
@TomJEstes @MissouriGOP Metaphorical. I will attack the ethics of the Party taking sides in the Primary.  Individuals have preferences but should not show bias in their official capacity. To do so is unethical.
Name one Spending Bill that Josh Hawley has publicly opposed. #MOSen
@GrantGambling Most of you don't  care about limited government or fiscal responsibility, but a few of us still do. 		You drunken sailors call yourselves "Republicans", but you don't know what it means.

@GrantGambling Josh Hawley is not a Republican.
@TomJEstes Tom, I think the @MissouriGOP should be neutral before the Primary. 		You disagree with that philosophy, and so does the Missouri GOP. 		You all are entitled to your opinion. And I am free to attack all of you for unethical bias in the process. 		What they are doing is wrong.
-He refuses to debate. 	-He thinks we need gun control. 	-He does not feel he should have to answer any policy questions. 	-He supports the Omnibus Spending Bills. 	-He refuses to engage with voters. 		@MissouriGOP demands that you vote for Josh Hawley anyway. #VotersDontMatter
Unacceptable https://t.co/XYzaHnXz8S
@TomJEstes Define "they".		If you mean the dozen members of the Executive Committee then let's just make it explicitly clear that they are biased and not impartial. And that those dozen people will ignore the voters at will, and do as they please.
@tk0383 @MOGOP_Chairman I don't know why the @MissouriGOP decided to do this. To my knowledge there has still been no explanation of their actions. 		Corruption is only one possible answer, and there is no proof that this is why they did this.		I am quite certain there will be a press release very soon.
The @MissouriGOP has asked that everyone stop discussing allegations of ethics violations and wrongdoing by its Executive Committee. 		They want everyone to know that there is nothing to see here, and they have picked the nominee already so there is no need for voters to choose.
@TomJEstes I am upset with the Party, not Hawley. They should be neutral before the Primary. Hawley just wants to win (even though he doesn't show it).		Petersen does not embrace some Republican ideas; Deficits and Debt and Omnibus Spending Bills come to mind...he opposes those.

It's Happening!! https://t.co/xVzsEdhUDW
@DaveBertelsen He goes out of his way to praise Trump when he does good things. I applaud that.  AP uses a free market perspective to praise what Trump has done.		But that is a fine line. Purists are already having conniptions. Tariffs, like bloated Omnibus bills, are unacceptable.
@BheemaBachus Government can tax, which increases revenue. Taxes bring negative consequences, but increased revenue makes the math better. 		They can also just print more, like Venezuela is doing. The math works, but the economy doesn't.
@repckelly @onefreecitizen I meant neighbors, because my neighbors would be affected. The music would only affect so many. The tires, more. A nuclear cloud would make a huge number my neighbors.
@repckelly @onefreecitizen Yes. My neighbors can certainly forbid me from burning tires in my back yard, and even from  blaring RUSH's 2112 at full volume at 2am.
@repckelly @onefreecitizen There is no legitimate restriction on behavior by government that is not specifically related to the violation of the life, liberty, or property of another. 		There is no legitimate restriction on behavior without there being a legitimate victim that is being protected.
@repckelly @onefreecitizen If one individual violates the liberty of another we are back to a crime.  If the Collective does it, the aggrieved individual has no place to turn, except for violence.		To initiate force you have to prove you were injured, and for the collective to act there must be a victim./F
@repckelly @onefreecitizen The problem comes when one individual who has not been harmed wants to restrict the actions of another, for whatever reason. They have no right to do this, and any action toward someone who is not violating your rights is an act of aggression. /3
@repckelly @onefreecitizen Since the individual has a right to "restrict" his neighbor from violating his life/liberty/property, so does the collective in the forms of laws against theft, assault, and kidnapping. And they can seek justice on behalf of the individual. /2
@repckelly @onefreecitizen Government is collective defense of individual rights. If someone wants to kill/steal/rape an individual, that individual has a right to defend against it and seek justice if it occurs. 		The collective has the same right to defend and seek justice as the individual.  /1
@DaveBertelsen So, don't have principles?		I am aware that pragmatism is the latest thing, and the "ideological purists" are the objects of scorn for sticking to principles instead of finding solutions. 		Aware, not swayed. Tariffs are not the way.
@dhtyler Maybe. üòèBut here I was using sarcasm. And, you are correct.
https://t.co/d8Y4zqEI5E
@repckelly @onefreecitizen To the individual there is no difference. But one is a crime by one man against the other, while the other is all men getting together and committing a crime against an individual. 		We institute government to protect from the former, not engage in the latter.
@BheemaBachus The math works the same way.
@repckelly @onefreecitizen I am not sure what "conservative" means, but Liberty is freedom from government. I think that describes my position. 		It does seem most on both sides want more statism than I am comfortable with.
@J_Dubya80 I consider myself a Liberal as well. Liberty is always freedom from government.
@J_Dubya80 Classical Liberal.  Not liberal as the label is applied today.
@Ltjohn25 America is already drugged up. 	Heroin is illegal, and we have an epidemic. People who wish to do drugs are doing so despite the laws. 		All we are doing is filling prisons and spending money on locking people up. (Mostly in the cities, not out here where we live)
@photoartist9 @JohnHuffmanSTL @juliusagusta I think they should change the law, not let it slide.
@Ltjohn25 Alcohol is a completely relevant comparison. And you are advocating for laws against the actions of consenting adults behind closed doors. 		Gladys Kravitz stuff.
@onefreecitizen You are correct. Bastiat was a liberal, and sat on the left side of his chamber.
@Ltjohn25 Alcohol is also exceptionally bad for you. So are trans fats and too many soft drinks and white sugar.		I understand that many of you think you have the right to run other people's lives for them, but you do not.		I am going to go eat a Twinkie and follow it with a shot of vodka.
@photoartist9 @JohnHuffmanSTL @juliusagusta The one reason I can think of is to prevent States from violating individual liberty. If a State wanted to infringe free speech or self defense the federal government should step in to protect the rights of individuals. 		Of course, we have abandoned principle long ago.
@Spiegey63 Killing and stealing and raping are crimes. They should be crimes, and they are. 		Drinking alcohol is not a crime but you have obviously seen the devastation that alcohol causes in families and communities. Alcohol is devastating.
Interesting question here. 		Is Individual Liberty a Conservative idea or a Liberal idea?  Does the idea that you are "free to act as you choose so long as you don't infringe on the rights of others" run afoul of conservative principles? https://t.co/PKZj8G6AD0
@photoartist9 @JohnHuffmanSTL @juliusagusta Our founders envisioned a system where States would pick and choose their own laws, and they actually wrote that philosophy into the constitution. 		I guess they set a dangerous precedent.
@Ltjohn25 Why so?
@Spiegey63 Whether tobacco or guns or trans fats or gas guzzling cars there is always someone who does not approve. Maybe they don't like what I do in the bedroom or how I raise my kids. 		Life. Liberty. Property. 		Not "feelings".
@Spiegey63 My aim, as always, is to defend individual liberty.		There are lots of things that people do which you may or may not approve of. The question is, does it infringe on your life, liberty, or property?
Do you agree with President Trump that Congress should pass the Marijuana Federalism Bill (aka the STATES Act)?		The Bill would effectively exempt states who legalize it from federal pot laws.
@Spiegey63 Immigration and Borders are federal issues, and they should be. States should defer to the federal government on those issues. 		As for Mexican pot, a functioning US free market would eliminate that illegal demand.

@maddejansen I wonder if some in your field might do better in another field, like industry, where jobs pay more and are plentiful?		If you are working in higher ed you should be qualified for a job that you would only need one of.		My company is hiring.
US unemployment by any measure is at a low point. We have seen an improving jobs environment for many years.		Shouldn't the cost of social welfare programs be going down?  Why aren't these programs being cut?		We are going into debt to create these jobs, but our costs don't fall.

@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens It is unfortunate. At one time he had a very bright future ahead of him and now he just serves as an example of what not to do.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens It was his decision to sleep with a married woman. If he had not made that bad decision it would have cost him a lot of grief. 		I bet he really regrets making that bad decision now. Maybe next time he will not make such an unwise decision.		Hopefully he learned his lesson.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens I just checked. 		Still no tears for the Governor.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens Every criminal defendant is innocent until proven guilty, whether OJ or Weinstein or Greitens or Clinton or Cosby.		And even if you are caught red handed you still deserve a vigorous legal defense.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens As a criminal defendant citizen Greitens is entitled to full due process. He has not been convicted. 		Kim Gardner is clearly partisan and apparently incompetent and she deserves all of the criticism she is getting.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens The Governor is guilty of cheating on his wife with another man's wife. You admitted that earlier. That is not fake news. It was not a wise move and he may lose his Public Office because of it. 		I am sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens Are you the one behind the Office Holder's Bill of Rights, to protect Public Officials from capricious attacks by constituents and voters?		I have not signed up for that one yet. I am also not shedding any tears for Missouri's Great Seal.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali I don't think he should have done what he has admitted to doing, and I am greatly disturbed by what he has been credibly accused of doing. 		We will have to agree to disagree about how women should be treated.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali @SheenaGreitens He is being impeached because of what he has admitted to. 		The people of Missouri do not have to share your view of the affair. We have heard the woman and we have heard the Governor's attorneys and the consensus is that the woman is credible.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali "Younger" - LOL. Excellent spin. 		I have a calendar that goes all the way back to 2015. I also remember the early run-up to the Governor's race, because it was in 2015.  		"Younger"...üòÜ
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali It is good that you can admit that they had an affair. The Governor has already admitted it. It is sad, and that mistake looks like it will cost him his office. 		Like I said, it was not wise.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali Going forward I would advise other young politicians not to do this, because this is quite likely to happen if you do. 		If Greitens had asked beforehand I think most would have told him this was an unwise move. This is the kind of boneheaded move that could threaten your career.
@VisioDeiFromLA @StephenLimbaugh @ali Maybe if we back away a little and look at it from a little different perspective...

@RepublicOfVT True. My congressman is Blaine Leutkemeyer, who comes out every couple of years trying to sound fiscally responsible. Then he votes for every CR and Omnibus and spending plan that comes along. 		Every. Single. One. With no explanation, ever. 		Yes, Blaine loves Keynes.

@cwlair Of course the Dem agenda is worse.
@Vets4AP @manda2257 @AP4Liberty I would not have endorsed @AP4Liberty if he were not a fiscal conservative. Austin opposed the Omnibus and is committed to spending reduction.
A RINO is a Republican In Name Only, meaning they don't really believe in basic Republican ideas. 		If Fiscal Responsibility is a basic Republican idea, then are most Republicans RINOs?		Asking for a friend.
@Tea4gunsSC I agree with that completely.
@EvaLovasco @christoferguson There is a lesson here for future Public Officials. What that lesson turns out to be remains to be seen
@Tea4gunsSC No man has ever been free?		No man could ever be free until no man ever oppresses any other?		In that case the word freedom has no meaning. It is just a pretty word on a shelf that we admire, like one of Plato's forms, perfect but unattainable in reality.
@Tea4gunsSC I have zero problems getting food of clothing or shelter or anything, for that matter. 		You feel we should go halfway around the world and kill strangers so we can be "free".		I don't understand how freedom requires war. I think I am free already, and you keep arguing I am not.
@Tea4gunsSC Fascism and communism are not ok. I do avoid traveling to North Korea, so I guess you could say I change my behavior. 		Have you been to North Korea?  Do you frequent the south side of Chicago just to prove you are free?
@Tea4gunsSC No, it doesn't. I have free will and can make whatever rational or irrational decision I choose. The wolf pack and the mafia are just realities; they don't control me, even if I alter my decisions to avoid them.
@Tea4gunsSC In nature, the bear and the mountain lion do not steal my freedom.  Neither do floods or tornadoes. 		These challenges force us to change our behavior or face consequences, but we are still free. 		Similarly, the fact the "the Mafia runs the docks" doesn't mean I am not free.
@Tea4gunsSC I have read about that. 		The people who did that are undoubtedly dead by now, but we can drop bombs overseas if it makes you feel better.
@repckelly @TeamHawley @charliedalton55 @HawleyMO He will not receive a vote from me.
@Tea4gunsSC Here in my hometown we are not fighting any wars. No foreign invader has ever gotten this far. I am sorry if they are attacking where you are. 		I don't understand why we should go kill strangers overseas, but I can see it seems important to you.
@Tea4gunsSC It may indeed be near time to take up arms against our government. I suspect the Debt will eventually be the catalyst one way or another. 		This has nothing to do with killing strangers overseas.
@Tea4gunsSC I live in Missouri and not on the coasts so all of the attacks on our country are taken care of before they get to us. None of the battles ever make it this far inland.
@christoferguson I hope he prevails in his criminal case, as it seems to me the prosecution is politically motivated and they have made mistakes. Also, I hope the legislature removes him from office.
@Tea4gunsSC Liberty does not require war.
@TeamHawley @charliedalton55 @HawleyMO Oh, man!  Someone should have told Josh about the Missouri GOP Primary Debate for US Senate, which was also last night. 		Had Josh known about it he could have come and debated the other candidates. 		Wait - Josh knew about the debate, didn't he?  		Sad.

@Ltjohn25 @GovGreitensMO I am judging the Governor. 		Is it inappropriate to judge him by the values he says he holds?
@Ltjohn25 This morning I heard the administration say Syria has been using chemical weapons for some time and that this is a cumulative response. 		If that's true then Congress should have been consulted. Because of the Constitution.
@Ltjohn25 @GovGreitensMO No, I am not, John. 		I am asking him to resign over things he has admitted to.
I must say I agree with	@gretchenbangert &amp;	@JaneDueker &amp;	@KathieConway &amp;	@sdieckhaus &amp;	@Mikelkehoe &amp;	@RepAnnWagner &amp;	@AGJoshHawley &amp;	@calebrowden &amp;	@clairecmc &amp;	@robschaaf &amp;	many others. 	#StrangeBedfellows		@GovGreitensMO should resign https://t.co/z8adSbaGUh

@BruceLP4NV @LPNational @GOP @RandPaul @RepThomasMassie Missouri has open primaries, and so I can and will vote for AP.
@BruceLP4NV I have never been a fan of the President and have never hesitated to say so. But if we are to have government then people who participate will need to cooperate and compromise. 		I don't like Pelosi or Schumer but I will not deny reality. If the Mob controls the docks...they do.
@BruceLP4NV @LPNational @GOP @RandPaul @RepThomasMassie Ok. But of course you do not own the term, so your opposition is simply noted. 		I am no longer in any party but I can tell you AP is much more libertarian than the vast majority of Republicans, especially here in Missouri.		I will be voting for AP and also for some LP candidates
@BruceLP4NV There are 4 choices here. Is there a better choice than AP?		I want someone who will not vote for a bloated Omnibus. 		I want someone who will defend my individual liberty. 		I want someone who knows where Aleppo is. 		I don't believe in the forced baking of cakes.

@PetsandPucks I will tell you what we DO have. 		1) The Governor admits that he had an affair with this woman. 	2) This woman says he hit her and it was not all consensual. 	3) The Governor refuses to deny that there was a picture, or that he tied her up.
@PetsandPucks I don't think it would matter to many people if there were. You may be one of those, I don't know. 		My point is that even VIDEO is not enough for some people.
@PetsandPucks In this case we waited for the Missouri Legislature to investigate and issue an official report. They did.  		I wanted him to resign before the report. 		If the Republican dominated state legislature decides to impeach him, they will do so and I will consider that appropriate.
@PetsandPucks As I said, what he has admitted to is enough for me, and that is not disputed. 		These days we get videos where we can all watch something happen and people will still say "we need to wait for the investigation" to tell us what we just saw with our own eyes.
@PetsandPucks You are defending the Governor and his actions. He has been accused by the woman who was there of not taking NO for an answer. 		I have no way of knowing if you will also defend this behavior. I do not know what you see as ethical or unethical behavior.
@PetsandPucks He was charged with a crime and is in the middle of preparing for a trial. 		I am not an attorney and I am not sure what charge they could get a conviction on. 		When a woman says NO at any point a man should stop. You may not agree, but that's my opinion.
It is important that we train the next generation of young people to understand the principles of Liberty. One unfortunate side effect may be that they will all have @RandPaul's hair. https://t.co/jQaJ7pZBUK
@PetsandPucks I am a staunch defender of due process in criminal proceedings, like the one the Governor faces. 		But as I said there is no natural right to hold office. I think he should resign and if he doesn't I support his impeachment.
@PetsandPucks Jeff, I believe he hit her and took her picture and that it was not all consensual. 		I understand you don't, but I do.		I believe the woman's story and so do the people who investigated. 		I stand by my tweet.
@PetsandPucks The report says it was not consensual and he hit her. I waited for the official report and that's what it said. 		They investigated, and they found credible her claims. I didn't investigate, the Missouri Legislature did. 		What proof are you looking for?
@PetsandPucks The above is not unsubstantiated. He had sex with another man's wife while he was married. 		There is no natural right to hold office. I don't care a bit about his so-called "right" to be Governor, because that right doesn't exist. 		He should resign now.
@PetsandPucks Nope. 		3) Eric Greitens had sex with another man's wife. This is not disputed. 	4) Eric Greitens was married and cheated on his wife. This is FACTUAL and not disputed. 		The truth is these facts do not seem to disturb you at all. You are entitled to your opinion. 		So am I.
@PetsandPucks I was summarizing the report, which describes the woman being hit. They found her story credible. The Governor was asked to present his side and he refused. 		But as I said, what he has admitted to is enough for me, and that is not in dispute.
@PetsandPucks The things that the Governor has admitted to are enough for me. Those things are facts. 		The rest of this adds to it. Jay Barnes is not on a witch hunt. He is one of 5 Republicans and 2 Democrats to have investigated and issued this report, and it is not good.
@cchavers20 A prosecutor in St. Louis convened a Grand Jury and got a criminal indictment. 		In addition to this there are  investigations into his his campaign issues and vanishing texts both by the legislature and the AG. 		The legislature's job is to decide if he can still lead.
@cchavers20 Jay Barnes chaired the committee. Speaker Richardson found it disturbing. She is a first person witness. He declined to speak to them. They found her credible.		Impeachment is not a Court of Law.  Who knows what they will decide but the Legislature can remove him for many reasons

@captainjujubean Here in Missouri I don't need nukes or grenade launchers to defend myself. My natural right to self defense means I need to be able to match the threat I face. 		Right now in our society that threat is at the AR-15 level, as we are all aware. (But handguns kill far more)
@captainjujubean I work in industry, visiting manufacturing plants in the midwest. They have guards and badges and locked doors and I think schools should have the same. 		Some ban guns, many have armed security. I am not a big fan of gun free zones.

@Swohtz "Armed" backup?  Why?  	Why go with guns at all?

@Swohtz You have an inherent right to live; not to be shot and killed while in geometry class. And a gunman can deprive you of that right. 		Just because thieves steal does not mean you don't have a right to your property.
@Swohtz Rights do not vary from society to society. The people of North Korea have a right to free speech and self defense and freedom of religion just like we do. 		Unlike us, they have a tyrant abusing them and taking away their free exercise of those rights.
@Swohtz If they come for your guns will you be ok with it?
@Swohtz You should go back and read what I said. I said the threat level we face is about an AR-15 level. I think that is true.
@Swohtz @sl2111 What will you do when you arrive?  What will you use to stop the murderous thugs?
@Swohtz No, I don't. 		I realize you think all these people dying from heroin needed "permission" to take it, right?  But, not so much.
@Swohtz You are clearly not a fan of Bastiat or Hayek or Locke or Smith or Jefferson or any of the Classic Liberal thinkers. That's ok. We will have to disagree on the nature of rights. 		I believe our rights are both inherent and individual.
@Swohtz What one needs is to be able to handle the threat one may face. 		That threat in the US right now is not at an Abrams tank level. I don't need grenade launchers or fully automatic weapons. 		The threat level is about an AR-15.  That is the threat we face, right?  Not the tank.
@Swohtz Good to know, but I didn't ask anyone's permission. Nor do I need anyone's permission.
@Swohtz And how would a phone call prevent murderous thugs from killing me. Phone calls don't save lives.
@Swohtz NO, rights do not come from documents. Rights cannot be "given".
@Swohtz You have no right to kill me. Nobody has any right to kill me. Nobody has any right to steal from me or rape me or enslave me. I have no right to kill or rape or steal. 		Inherent in the above statements are the rights to life, liberty, and property. Which do you disagree with?
@Swohtz How should we protect our lives from the murderous thugs that would end them?
@SecretlyPsyched  https://t.co/LAg13zuRPz
@Swohtz There are no conflicts. Rights don't come from documents. 		I have no right to your life, liberty, or property and you have no right to mine. We each have an inherent right to defend our lives and liberty and property. 		No conflict.
@Swohtz We do have a problem. But my rights are inherent. 		We all need to understand our rights - to LIFE, certainly (life is sacred) but also to Liberty. 		https://t.co/nbCWnqVWOb
@repckelly I don't believe in the death penalty anyway, but certainly not for nonviolent voluntary transactions, however distasteful.
@Swohtz Certainly not my entire take. I heard a lot of respect for life. I heard things about non violence I agreed with. And I heard them demanding certain things. 		They spoke of Liberty. But...what liberty?  Whose Liberty?

@repckelly The theory being that if consumers paid providers directly for services they could remove these administrative costs.  Doing so would also introduce price/quality forces and better consumers. 		Currently there are very few market forces at work here.

@TheFaison FISA authorizes special judges to allow agencies to spy on Americans in some circumstances. The charge is that this power was abused for political purposes. It appears it was. 		Trump wanted Sessions to investigate instead og an IG. 		I would like to see Sessions go.
@repckelly I am hearing that the reason students were shot was that you and I have the freedom to buy an AR-15.		I don't agree with that, but that is what I am hearing.

@feingold32 I just don't like all of the additional debt. MAGA is increasing our debt exponentially, and I don't think all that additional debt is a good thing. MAGA is very expensive, and mostly about spending my grandkid's money. 		But we can disagree about whether debt is good or bad.
@IamFourdahill The entire question is about the age appropriateness of various activities. Glad you see that now.
@Scribbles646 @gcems645 He admitted to having an affair with the woman. The woman said he took a photo of her nude without her permission. A Grand Jury heard the evidence and delivered an indictment. 		No conviction but a lot of things are known already, and enough to make a judgment.
@IamFourdahill A two year old is too young to be able to give rational consent for sex. I believe the same is true of a 12-year old. We will have to disagree on this one. I just don't think they are old enough to consent to sex.

@TheFaison @angelsfann79 Crimes are violations of the Life, Liberty, or Property of another. We have laws to establish definitions of and punishments for crimes. 		Having a weapon to protect yourself from criminals is not a crime.
@TheFaison How about if we take unstable people in front of judges and present evidence and get a judgement so they cannot have weapons?		I support that.
@TheFaison Sure. 		I wonder how many new gun control laws it will take before police can assure us that every child in every school is completely safe?		How much will it take, and can the police assure us that is enough?

@dwpandme Certainly no fraud, and his words are very carefully chosen. I don't agree with him on everything but I really like his core philosophy.
@PennyAxa I think in a free society the government is merely collective defense against people who don't want a rights respecting government. 		When the People and the Government are not the same I side with the People.
The government has to have more powerful guns than the people, otherwise there is a risk that the people will take control.
@dwpandme Sure, he has some good ideas, and personal responsibility is at the core. When people feel like cogs their lives lose meaning.
@rowlyutd I don't think my country should be in Afghanistan, so I agree with you there. 		I do care about heroin deaths. And alcohol deaths. And handgun deaths. 		And Liberty. I care about Liberty too.
@rowlyutd If we can make it  voluntary it sounds awesome.
@dwpandme Perhaps. And if they do not violate anyone's life, Liberty, or property then I suggest we implement them at once.
@dwpandme First, thank you for a great question. I think the despair in our society is a big flashing red light. We need to shift the paradigm; the vision. 		But that's crazy talk, right?
@rowlyutd I hear you, but I believe in personal responsibility. 		And I also believe in compassion and charity. 		We should all help people who are trying to dig out of a hole, while ignoring those jumping in.
@dwpandme A fair point but...I do. I don't want people to die of heroin either.

@Shuff154Lea If someone is mentally unsound then a judge should take away their right to own a firearm. 		I agree, lets get these people in front of a judge, present the evidence, and have them legally barred from owning firearms. 		Absolutely. Yes.

@Shuff154Lea Nobody has the right to violate the life, liberty, or property of another. 		If you want to use force to stop someone from doing something, you need to show that they have violated your life, liberty, or property. 		Otherwise you should leave them alone.
@GarlowLily There are two issues here. First, who should help these people?  Second, how should we balance the rights of the individual with our concern for their welfare?		I think Missouri should have a serious discussion about how to care for these citizens of our state. I call for that.

@OfWolfAndRaven Check out @DaveRamsey and Financial Peace.
@OfWolfAndRaven Correct. Have you ever heard of Dave Ramsey?
@OfWolfAndRaven I am proud to say I am in that group. We don't need to borrow money to "honor" people.
@OfWolfAndRaven The purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property, not put on parades. 		I don't care what it costs, we should not borrow money to put on a parade.
@OfWolfAndRaven My grandson supports our veterans but he is a little short the money for an ostentatious military display. (About $20 trillion short).

@hayek My use of violence stops people from using aggression. Because they have no right to my life, liberty, or property I will feel justified in using violence if they infringe on them. 		I don't need to name the above with any label. It is simply a statement of fact.
@hayek We agreed that nobody has any inherent or natural right to the life, liberty, or property of anyone else. 		That's awesome.
@PetsandPucks I have to believe that is from Claire.
@hayek What I assert is this: You have no inherent right to infringe on my life, liberty, or property. If you feel you have such a right, I would be interested in where you think such a right would come from. If you don't, then we agree.

@hayek The Mafia establish a set of rules and customs, as does the dictator in North Korea. If I want to do business at the docks I will have to deal with the mob, just like bears in the woods. 		Reality affects our choices but that doesn't make it "right".
@hayek Those are the kind that DON'T truly exist.  		Like the right to the labor of another. You can enslave people, but you have no "right", dictator or not.		What you are describing are the "rights" of Assyrian or Hittite kings; which is the rule of thugs.
@hayek Sure, those are different discussions. 		For me, life is a sacred thing. Ayn Rand claimed that her life, and love of it, was the one thing she could swear by. And so I see murder as wrong. Not ambiguous, but taking a life which is not threatening you is wrong. Rape, theft: wrong.
@aaforringer I am aware of a certain "reactionary" element in those who follow me. I clearly fall on the Liberty side but I am tolerant of other views.
@JustinFrom1776 Fair enough.
How do you feel about efforts to make recreational cannabis legal for adults?
@hayek These two things need different words. Freedom of religion or speech is not granted at the whim of other people. They can be taken away, but doing so is immoral. 		You don't have the power to "give" me rights. You can attempt to take them away by force, and I will defend them.
@hayek Do you think people have rights?  If so, what rights do people have and where do they come from?
@TheFaison You don't have any rights that people in other countries don't have. They may have their inherent rights abused where yours are not (if they are slaves, for example) but everyone has the same rights.
@TheFaison Oh. 		I will have to find a different word then. I think I will use Liberty. 		Regardless, your rights are inherent, and so are those of the people who put money in that bank. You cannot hurt people or take their stuff, and they can't hurt you or take your stuff.
@hayek Rights are inherent. The right to live or speak or pray is not given or "granted".  But clearly you can be killed or enslaved and have your rights violated. The "protection" is voluntary cooperation to defend those inherent rights collectively.
@TheFaison Choices always have consequences. The Mafia exists, as do bears and tigers, and none of them care for your rights. But you are still free to choose what you do.

@nighthawkmoon I am not a fan of the metal detectors he insists upon at the State Capital but I am one of those crazy 2nd Amendment people. The legislators are not afraid; he could take a Xanax and restore freedom to the Capitol.
@Engelhardt_Dan Yes. Well said.
@DelBozo I think he should resign. Just one man's opinion. 		If I were a part of an honorable group and some douche kept invoking the association in every speech and then dishonored himself I would be pissed. 		But that is none of my business.
@Engelhardt_Dan Yes I was. John would have been great.
@AllenTruitt1 He also cheated with another man's wife and their marriage ended. That woman was recorded telling her husband Greitens blackmailed her. 		She WAS there, naked and tied up. Was she lying about the blackmail? Perhaps. But she was there and I wasn't.
@AllenTruitt1 Neither of us were there; the claims of blackmail may be true, and they may not. We know he tied her up and had sex with her. We know she was another man's wife. We know she said he blackmailed her. 		I find the facts to be disturbing; you may not.
@AllenTruitt1 Consensual sex would not include blackmail or threats of publishing nude photos. Also, he could have cheated with a single girl instead of some other guy's wife. The man is a sleaze.
@Shrekopher Obviously there is a moral high ground. There is such a think as ethical behavior. 		Blackmail and breaking your vows is wrong, whether everyone does it or not. And not everyone does. 		Obviously he should resign.
@Shrekopher This is not about Eric cheating on his wife, (not to mention with another man's wife) although that is a breach of trust. It is about whether the interaction was voluntary and whether or not he blackmailed her.
@AllenTruitt1 True, except for the parts he has admitted to and apologized for. Like tying up another man's wife and having sex with her, which he has apologized to his wife for.
@beverly_crider From what I understand the other Navy Seals fully support Eric Greitens. That is what he tells us.

Should Missouri Governor Eric Greitens resign?
@KashJackson2018 Eric Greitens continually makes the connection between his character and being a part of the Navy Seals, to the point it is nauseating. 		If it is true, then it is true. If not, then perhaps the Governor could stop boasting about being a Navy Seal every day of his life.
@beverly_crider All the man ever talks about is being a Navy Seal, and how being a Navy Seal has shaped his character. He repeatedly equates his character to his being a Navy Seal, so YES I am serious.

@MoaninMary Poverty is a problem that has always been a concern for humanity. In my opinion stereotyping certain "races" as poor is not productive.
@MoaninMary Why on earth are you talking about race?
The best thing to do for the poor is to teach them to lift themselves out of poverty. https://t.co/YV6XzB3cCB

@hred2694 You are free to feel any way you wish. You can kneel or protest or burn flags or whatever floats your boat. I don't care what you do.
@hred2694 I value Liberty and Equality. The Declaration of Independence declares those to be our values.  Our reality doesn't always match, true.
@HourlyStruggle GWB spent too much, and had a neocon foreign policy.  He perfectly represented his party, who embraced those things.
@hred2694 Burning the flag is not illegal.	I think it is disrespectful, but that is because of the values it represents to me, like Liberty, Equality.
@hred2694 Yes.
@JeffRayChirps Great question.
@hred2694 I believe people are free to burn it if they see fit. But to me it represents our values
@GMFWashington Yep.  But it is kinda like telling people about a flood headed toward them. I can look at solutions but convincing them of the problem...?
@RalphMus @TheLimerickKing Currency is a medium of exchange. 	Fiat currency is problematic, but coins are not necessarily debt.

@GMFWashington I was thinking of the long term, and the least pain.
@MCaff4spd It is the currently unemployed that we expect to suddenly be hired b/c of tax changes, but they are the least likely to be qualified.
@78estranged Corporations are not the same as government. They do not have exclusive right to use force.
@GMFWashington I think the collapse is coming, but a 1% reduction in real expenditures each year would obviously remedy the problem over time.

@nrkgalt Very true. Also, those promises will not be kept. Not possible.

@jonny_anderson ...wants the job. Is that tyranny or is that the breakdown of a community? It is sad, but unless I move there I can't fix it.

@jonny_anderson ...specific things from him, and he refused. Who is "the King" here?  What official policies are we protesting?  What specific things...

@jonny_anderson Looking specifically at the issue of some racist police officers shooting black people, what do you propose?  What are you asking for?
@jonny_anderson The injustice you are looking for is police misconduct in high crime areas, which protesters claim is racially motivated. Some of it is. ...

By eliminating PERSONAL deductions, they can lower CORPORATE tax rates. Maybe @RoyBlunt can explain this. https://t.co/wEdzpW4yfA
@IamFourdahill Sometimes people choose not to fight an injustice for very rational, pragmatic reasons.
@jonny_anderson It is the form it took. To me, the flag represents high ideals. I see the protest as "I do not respect this flag or what it represents".
@jonny_anderson If someone has been done an injustice they should protest. Injustice is occurring around the world &amp; people are protesting, and that's good.
@jonny_anderson ...and I don't like people who try to intrude into my life because their product or issue or message is so very important! They all are...

@jonny_anderson He is free. We are free. Everyone is free.  He wants to kneel. Fine. I don't wish to watch. Fine. I see no issue here. Everyone wins.
@jonny_anderson Why would I watch a football game?  Because I like football, or beer, or cheerleaders. Not to see a protest.
@jonny_anderson This was marketing, of a specific message. They chose an approach. I don't think it was brilliant, and it may be counterproductive.
@jonny_anderson I think it might help to view this not as the NFL but instead as Pepsi or Wendy's.  What motivates consumers? Millions spent on that data.
@jonny_anderson Those people are not employing these players. No, this is in no way coercion.These are customers voicing their opinion.
@jonny_anderson I am doing no harm to anyone. I have a poor opinion of someone and that seems to offend you.  You, and he, are free to be offended or not.
@jonny_anderson We need criminal justice reform.	This is a VERY poor communicator.	I am not a cop, so I can't help there.
@jonny_anderson I don't see any coercion.  To me, the flag is a symbol of some great principles. Others can disagree. I see no reason to be silent.
@jonny_anderson I do realize that my views may make some people uncomfortable. I am ok with that. Liberty can be uncomfortable.
@jonny_anderson I did judge him, yes. I judged him negatively, yes. He and I disagree philosophically.  He is free to express his views.
@jonny_anderson I revere Jefferson's ideas. Others are free to feel differently. Feel free to practice whatever religion you wish.
@jonny_anderson I am an individual. I don't care to watch it, so I turn it off.
@jonny_anderson I am not a fan of POTUS and I don't care a whit about his views.
@jonny_anderson What restrictions would you propose on how we are allowed to react to our fellow man?
@jonny_anderson ...Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. What I hear is that he doesn't like those ideas. I judge him accordingly.
@jonny_anderson In its simplest form, the message I hear is, "I don't like what this flag represents".  To me, the flag is a symbol of ideas written by...
1. To make people think.	2. To change the world.	3. So future generations will know what I was thinking.		 #WhyIWrite

@jonny_anderson Coercion?  I said nothing of coercion. What coercion are you talking about?
@jonny_anderson That very Liberty allows them to disrespect its very symbol as a form of protest.  And I am free to judge their actions as I see fit.
@jonny_anderson I said, "they are exercising their Liberty". They are. That Liberty is one of the greatest of our values. I am thrilled that they have it.
To me, the flag represents our nation's best ideals, like Liberty and Equality. When you kneel you exercise Liberty, while disrespecting it.

@megagerdes My point was about hypocrisy. Silence for political expediency.
@CampersHaven Sure. What we will end up doing is spurring some economic growth, losing some revenue, spending more, and smiling at our grandchildren.
@marinevet1982 Not what we were talking about but I have no idea.
@preacherskidd Sure. (wink). I'm a 56 year old white male; I know what you mean. (wink)
@12StepGolf Sure. They are the same. You can like both or dislike both for how they treated women.
@marinevet1982 Also wrong.
If you brushed aside Trump's "grabbing pussy" remarks as "locker room talk" you should not comment about how High Hefner disrespected women.
@jefthecrusher Should be. But I was trying to stay in the real world, where that does not appear to be an option.
@PatrickJLavin All of that is true.
@PatrickJLavin If they lower prices too far revenues will drop. Surely you can admit that. Drop the price to zero and revenue is zero.
@PatrickJLavin Ok, let's try one example. Taxes are at 1% and you lower them to 0%...		The Laffer curve is valid in a limited range of conditions, not all.
@PatrickJLavin Lowering taxes does not necessarily generate more revenue. Usually, it results in less revenue.
@repckelly @Randy_Minchew Like a great big muscle car. Or a lime green house. Or being a Goth. Or eating sugary donuts at every meal. It's offensive. 	It's freedom.
...@MickMulvaneyOMB says if we get to 3% growth the tax plan will pay for itself. He also says we are already at 3% growth. ($700B deficit)
@CampersHaven Sure, the economy is dynamic. But, lower taxes do not always increase revenue. It depends. Sometimes you just get less revenue.
@TheArionus They already are, right?  Good point.
@Katrinafaye @Astroglide13 Of course we can. Just cut spending.
@Astroglide13 @Katrinafaye They don't have to be, under a specific set of conditions.
@jdavidsonlawyer @aaron_hedlund @repckelly @LHSummers The answer would be free markets, but Larry would not be a fan of those.
@nrkgalt True.
@PornPops69 Agreed. But that was not the question. üòä
@mikeorr308 Sometimes true. 	Sometimes not true. 	Easiest example: Lower rates from 1% to 0%. 	Laffer depends on conditions.
@MichiganTaxes @kenaviba Right. That is exactly what I am referring to. Reagan's cuts were a dramatic lifeline in a dreary situation. Now...not so dreary.
@MichiganTaxes @kenaviba I don't know if you remember but the conditions with Reagan felt (and are) much different than now. Remember the Carter malaise?
@jdavidsonlawyer @aaron_hedlund @repckelly Obviously there is no way any of  these things could happen on their own. You need several really smart people in a room in Washington.

@pdwick Correct. I am interested in which of these specific things people value most.
@CorrieFoos Sure. But giving people the one easy answer makes for a boring poll. This is a harder choice, and I am curious which they really prefer.
@repckelly @jdavidsonlawyer @aaron_hedlund Don't let it go to your head, Big Boy.
@repckelly @jdavidsonlawyer @aaron_hedlund Ok, you are correct. 	I sometimes use the word "idiot" incorrectly. These were not unintelligent men, but they were wrong.
Which of these two things is more important?
@repckelly @jdavidsonlawyer @aaron_hedlund LOL. I thoroughly reject Keynesian ideas, and Hamilton's ideas were wrong-headed and threatened our republic. But I never met either, so...
@CardsFanTX @jeffersonianguy @jo_ferova We were coming out of the Carter malaise. Top marginal rates were 70%. Laffer is not always valid, especially under better conditions.
The US Inflation Rate over the last 50 years. https://t.co/mTwR0DcCQD
@BuckyMaxwell Me too.
@jeffersonianguy @CardsFanTX @jo_ferova Very true. Lower rates can spur growth and raise revenue, or it can cause revenue to drop. It just depends.
@CardsFanTX @jo_ferova True, it depends. I set the condition as a premise to force a choice.
@BuckyMaxwell And...it was a premise; a "given", to make people make a choice.
@BuckyMaxwell The Laffer Curve is only applicable over a certain range of conditions. Not all tax cuts yield more revenue.
@EricDonderoR We have been too enamored with Keynes and Marx to have tried Hayek or Bastiat.

@kramerreport Absolutely valid over a range of conditions. But not all. Sometimes lower taxes mean less revenue.
@EternaFreeda Better yet, get the federal government out of my health care.
@BrettMckee I thought about a lot of good third choices but THIS is the dichotomy I wanted people to consider, because THIS is the choice we are making.

@soflahoosier @SSMHealth However it is that they already do pricing, they should tell us that up front. On a public website. Transparent.
@IamFourdahill This is a for-profit industry putting on an entertainment show and charging money for it. This is packaged entertainment.

@MatthewFeyen In prayer it indicates subservience. In a proposal it is a petitioner. Humility...yes.
The bended knee is a subservient position reminiscent of serfdom. It is more a symbol of victimhood than protest. Strange choice.

@TheButcher1962 It is disrespectful.
@TheArionus There ARE people with hateful philosophies. And our country was founded on the idea of protecting even hateful speech.
@TheArionus I agree. The Law should match the philosophy. It should not try for a specific outcome, and should be known and fixed and blind.
@nrkgalt I agree, and I would hope they would be quickly dismissed, or that free speech would be victorious at trial.
@legiox61bc @repckelly There are homes for sale in my neighborhood. Anyone can buy them.
@legiox61bc @repckelly No, not true. I believe in a world of individual liberty. Apparently you do not. I don't like your big government authoritarian ideals.
@nrkgalt So...you don't believe in lawsuits?  I am confused.
@nrkgalt They should not be arrested.  Anyone can sue anyone for anything. But the government should leave them alone.
@TheArionus We make laws to "help" "fix" problems and we do not see all of the consequences.
@TheArionus I am concerned mainly with philosophy. I believe when we take away the voluntary nature of markets we do damage, though it may be "unseen".
@legiox61bc @repckelly This comment is not just wrong, it is juvenile and avoids talking about difficult concepts. Very sad.
@legiox61bc @repckelly Discrimination is bad. Perhaps you thought someone thought it was a good thing. It is a bad thing.
@ThatLawyerDude @repckelly We formed a union "to protect these rights"...including life, liberty, and property. We are each sovereign. ALL rights are individual.
@ThatLawyerDude Which one do you favor, and which do you oppose?  I have no way of knowing, so help me out.
@MatthewFeyen Yes. It is wrong. But it should not be illegal. 		Is there anything that is illegal that you think should not be?
@repckelly @legiox61bc Me either. How do all transactions involve health and safety?
@repckelly Hmmm...certainly private transactions. But public employees serve the state and many involve health/safety and justice/use of force. So no.
@MatthewFeyen @angelsfann79 I just want to point out you leave open the door for the other side to demand that you do things they think you should do. #TwoWayStreet
@legiox61bc @repckelly Sure...üòâ...and religion and sex and money and racism and sexism and homophobia and karma and power and politics and fame and....all of them.
@TheArionus My timeline on Twitter goes back a ways, and I also have a healthy blog. I don't think you will find "law of the land" anywhere in there.
@MatthewFeyen You are someone who is advocating the use of force to make people do things that they think are wrong. We will agree to disagree on that.
@repckelly I think ALL transactions should be voluntary. (I have stated health/safety may be exceptions) Housing is not health/safety.
@MatthewFeyen I agree. I think it is repulsive. I will join you in condemning them. But transactions must be voluntary, not forced.
@repckelly The law should be that you need no grounds. Transactions should be voluntary, not forced. With exception for health/safety.
@TheArionus Shouldn't all of these transactions be voluntary, especially when they don't involve health or safety?  Plenty of alternatives.
@IntegrityNow4US I dislike both but I think all transactions should be voluntary and not forced, especially when they don't involve health or safety.
@MatthewFeyen So...you don't think transactions should be voluntary?  You endorse the use of force to make people conduct business?
@repckelly Transactions, especially those not immediately affecting health or safety, should be strictly voluntary.

@IamFourdahill ...you or I will receive?  You reject markets...what will replace them in terms of deciding who can have what care?
@IamFourdahill Ok. How, then, should we as a society decide how to meet wants and needs with scarce resources?  In this case, who decides what medical care
@IamFourdahill What if they trade their stocks publicly without your permission?  What if people buy those stocks anyway?  What will you do?

https://t.co/UeMCXHtPP9
@TheArionus Here is a WP Summary of the bill. https://t.co/kHTIgIraK1
@IamFourdahill Not the opposite; the same. Both are voluntary. You want to use force to equalize outcomes. Force w/threat of violence. Bad plan.
@IamFourdahill I AM against the death penalty. (Have you not heard a word?) Pacifism would mean not defending against attack; I am not a pacifist.
@IamFourdahill IF it involves the killing of another living human being then it is our business.  If it does not then it is not.
@IamFourdahill "Institutional charity"?  What is that?  I only know the regular kind.
@IamFourdahill If it is a living human being then you cannot kill it, period. You don't think it is and I do. I defend the natural rights of living humans.
@IamFourdahill Sometimes people cannot afford things they want and need. That is not "because of the free market". That is where charity comes in.
@IamFourdahill Nobody has any right to infringe on the life, liberty, or property of another. That is not moral relativism.
@IamFourdahill Free markets are only a means for men to fairly exchange goods and services. Markets are not churches or charities, but corn for tomatoes.
@IamFourdahill All human life IS sacred. 	Bad things happen in the world; always have. But that does negate the value of life. Sorry you are cynical. Sad.
@IamFourdahill I do think human life is sacred, yes. I think every human has the same rights from conception to natural death, including the right to live.
@IamFourdahill Individuals can choose to buy prenatal care in the free market or to buy insurance for it if that makes more sense, which is unlikely.

@Tea4gunsSC Without the use of force to ensure compliance there is no State; there is only voluntary society.
@Tea4gunsSC Society is a collection of individuals living and working together voluntarily. A State introduces Force to make people Comply.
@Tea4gunsSC Then groups are NOT States.
@Tea4gunsSC You cannot avoid participating in Society. The State is not Society.
@Tea4gunsSC Can a State be voluntary?

@PossumRoadkill Right now the State Senate is looking at expelling her from the senate.
@islamisfeminism @based_jane Yes. Being "proud" (or ashamed) of your black or white or yellow or red skin would make a person a moron, IMHO.

@MoaninMary Maria has to go. She cannot stay in the Missouri Senate. This is unacceptable. We will see what Claire chooses to do.

@larsonrichard No worries...I am passionate about encouraging people to be debt free so they can use their entire income to build wealth.
@larsonrichard Our society is unfortunately set up so that young people are pressured to make bad decisions, like buying a new car or pricey college.
@larsonrichard I have been listening to people from all walks talk about how they got in debt for years. Rich or poor it is about responsible decisions.
@larsonrichard There is a reason credit is the most heavily advertised product in the US. They make a killing off of people, robbing their income.
@larsonrichard Debt is usually unwise and a bad choice. It is not usually a "useful tool", it is usually a mistake.
@larsonrichard Illness is one example of debt that may not be your fault. But most people run up student loans and credit cards for dinner out.
@larsonrichard There is no shaming. Debt is dumb and lots of doctors and lawyers are swimming in it. The borrower us slave to the lender.
@larsonrichard I suggest you find a Dave Ramsey class and listen to real people (rich and poor) face their debt and the real, behavioral reasons for it.
@larsonrichard "The system" failed you?  Richard, you do not appear to believe in any sort of personal responsibility.  Is anyone responsible for anything?
@larsonrichard In fact...debt is the primary reason people cannot escape poverty. Debt is how the poor become enslaved, unable to escape circumstances.
@larsonrichard I said nothing about the poor. The point is about debt. However, the path out of poverty does not involve debt but being debt-free.

@SharonAOrtiz @MSUPOLITICAL @Mthomps016 That is correct.
@GopherBigGuy911 When did we declare war on North Korea?
@Tea4gunsSC Article 1. section 8.
@robertrobq The US is not in danger of attack, South Korea is. But after Pearl Harbor we declared war almost instantly.
@SharonAOrtiz @MSUPOLITICAL @Mthomps016 Still.....?  Can you look up when we declared war?
@SharonAOrtiz @MarlaMHughes Did we declare war against North Korea?

With Obamacare off the list what Trump Administration priority is most important to you?

@RosaleeAdams It is a big concern of mine.
@mycakeartbiz @DennisL656 They don't seem very upset. Trump is moving on and they seem ok with that.
I don't think Trump supporters were ever very concerned about repealing Obamacare. They had other concerns.

@bcoleintn If Obama wire tapped Trump he is already aware. Everyone is aware.
