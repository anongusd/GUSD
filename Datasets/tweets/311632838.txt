@davidhogg111 Mod kits or gunsmiths either registered or unregistered who mods a gun to full auto needs to have legal jeopardy as a felony. I can see other areas where laws have to be implemented. That’s my 2 cents for now. But good luck in your endeavors.
@davidhogg111 50 cal rifles are a weapon of war and cannot be sold on the consumer market. Any weapon that can be modified ie: AR and AK to full auto must be inspected every year with possible spot inspections possible during the year. Sale of bump stocks banned.
@davidhogg111 I think all gun owners should be license to purchase a weapon like a shotgun or rifle used for hunting. I think you need a special license and show a must need to own AR or AK style rifles. Handguns are also a must need and go through training as well.
@davidhogg111  Just to let you know that guns until recently as far as the public’s can purchase was only shot guns and rifles with a built in ammunition carrier like only 5-6 regular shells. I consider that guns that have removable ammo clips, weapons of war
