@crazycancerlife I understand not living around it you wouldn't get what's happening!! But it's insanity what's happening here!!
@crazycancerlife In CA to get food stamps you have to work on and off for at least 18 months. Also regardless of immigration status you can get a CA drivers license which is all that they ask for when you apply for a job.
@crazycancerlife @KSmithSpeaking And if you have private insurance no one can bill it correctly because they don't see it enough.	I've literally been asked what it was and how does it work by the front desk at a DR!!!	And everything has to be bilingual literally everything!!
@crazycancerlife @KSmithSpeaking If you've lived here as long as I have you know who is and isn't legal.	No one speaks English, the care sucks because no good DR wants to get paid by the state because they don't, if you sit long enough in the ER you'll hear them asking for Medical cards.
@KSmithSpeaking @crazycancerlife It's awful!! But those making arguments in favor of the lefts narrative don't live where it's a problem!!	And after the wall is built the VA needs a major overhaul!!
@crazycancerlife If you stop a flow of illegal immigrants who get millions in gov benefits you'd be able to help citizens!!	Over 60% of illegals are on some kind of gov aid!! 	Just look at California and our taxes all due to illegals being covered!!
@KSmithSpeaking @crazycancerlife I hear ya!! Only those in California would really understand the effects of illegal immigrants on our welfare system, our Healthcare System and lack of jobs because they're being giving them to legals; due to tax incentives the CA hands out!!
