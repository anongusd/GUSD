I had the great privilege to get to know her when she and my father served together in the legislature in the 70s. She leaves behind a vibrant and full chapter in the book of Oregon’s great leaders.
She cared deeply about the environment, public integrity, Oregon history and quality public service.
Oregon lost a real treasure with the passing of Norma Paulus.  She had a spirit and enthusiasm seldom seen in public service.  She didn’t just break ground for Oregon women, she shattered barriers.  And she did it all with a certain flair and a smile.
We need to come together around bipartisan #climatesolutions that ensure America leads the way with innovation, adaptation, &amp; conservation to protect the environment &amp; create jobs right here at home. https://t.co/u8RYNimwTJ
People have the right to know exactly how this would impact their lives before we have to vote on it. This is why I asked the Democratic leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee to hold a hearing on this bill three weeks ago, and I renew that call today.
We know a takeover of our health care system would cost $32 trillion and kick 150 million Americans off their union and employer health insurance plans.
Here it is, a government-run, single-payer health care bill has been introduced, and yet there is still no promise we are going to give it appropriate review at Energy and Commerce. https://t.co/9hjPwA7Ezv
We all know someone who has been hurt by the #opioidcrisis - a friend, neighbor, or loved one. Combating this scourge requires an all-hands-on-deck approach.

It's great to return to @AEI to continue an important discussion with @slsatel on combating the #opioidcrisis.

Congress has granted the executive branch certain spending authorities. I strongly object to any president acting outside of those explicit authorities to spend money that Congress has not appropriated for specific initiatives.
While I consistently support efforts to strengthen border security -- and voted just yesterday for additional physical barriers on our southern border that President Trump requested -- I am deeply concerned about the precedent that this action sets.
The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Just as I opposed President Obama’s spending of taxpayer dollars without Congressional authorization, today’s action by President Trump raises serious concerns about the Constitution’s separation of powers.

Now it’s time for Congress to come together with the president on long term, bipartisan solutions to secure our borders and thwart illegal immigration.
I’m pleased that important work like forest management projects in our district will resume if this deal moves forward. I will continue to support efforts to reopen the government, put our federal employees back to work, and resume the vital services of government agencies.
This tentative agreement reached by Congressional leaders and President Trump is welcome news for federal employees and their families in Oregon who have been hurt by this partial shutdown.

Racism, bigotry, and prejudice have no place in America, where we hold true that all men and women are created equal. The comments of Steve King are reprehensible and unbecoming of any person, much less an elected representative.

We cannot allow any country to undermine our right to free and fair elections, and I will continue to support efforts to combat Russian aggression against the very bedrock of our principles and values as Americans.
That is why I voted for unprecedented sanctions against the Russian regime, which the President has signed into law, to send the clear signal that these actions are unacceptable.
As I have said repeatedly, I fully support the findings of the hardworking Americans in our intelligence community that Russia deliberately attacked our democratic process and continues its hostile efforts against our country and our allies.
Russia’s interference in our elections and repeated attempts to subvert democracy in America must be condemned by our country’s leaders.

President Trump can right this wrong. I again strongly urged the President to administer the justice that is long overdue for these eastern Oregon ranchers by granting them a pardon so that they can get back to Harney County and their families.
Prosecutorial overzealousness by the federal government under the Obama Administration ignored Judge Hogan’s judicial discretion, and doubled down, forcing them to serve a mandatory minimum sentence established for terrorists.
Multiple editorial boards across Oregon have concurred. https://t.co/58EuDHAhwV
Federal Judge Michael Hogan agreed, when he used his discretion to apply more appropriate sentences, calling the mandatory minimum sentence for this case something that would ‘shock the conscious.'
The sentencing of Dwight and Steve Hammond to five years in federal prison is unjust. Period.

While I’m disappointed that the President has opposed our bill, I’m glad it passed the House with enough support to override his veto
Today I fully supported the House's plan to pause the Syrian refugee program until we are certain our screening process can stop terrorists
That way, we can be compassionate to suffering people while ensuring the safety of our nation
The House will act on a plan tomorrow to put a pause on accepting refugees from Syria until all individuals can be properly vetted
It would be reckless and dangerous to allow more Syrian refugees into our country until we know they pose no threat to our national security
Our nation has always welcomed people who are seeking a better life, but we cannot allow terrorists to take advantage of our compassion
