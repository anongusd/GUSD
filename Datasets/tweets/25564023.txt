Through her eyes she also lost a lot of the black votes in one of the Carolina ‘s and other states in the South where they were suppressing the votes b/c of action by SCOTUS. I agree she needs to chill and keep doing whatever shes doing.
That’s right Michael was and still is, my baby. They can call him names but they don’t know his story. And they can’t take his talent away from him. He was acquitted. As many tmes as they tried to tie him to criminal crimes. ❤️❤️Rest In Eternal Peace Michael. https://t.co/Ggfk4oHqPU

You’re right Smiley and the people wanted to protect their pre-existing condition and that’s why we flipped all those seats. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 https://t.co/vrgVVVbPTQ
@smileyt22 @AuntLulie @Mahogany1992 @pannlewis44 @CeciliaLisa3033 @Backstorymom1 @KelliSmith15 @MzDivah67 @Robin_Volpi @nanblunt @CUSunset @admiralmpj Exactly
@admiralmpj @AuntLulie @smileyt22 @Mahogany1992 @pannlewis44 @CeciliaLisa3033 @Backstorymom1 @KelliSmith15 @MzDivah67 @Robin_Volpi @nanblunt @CUSunset Yeah I know he was going for it and that’s how we got the ACA because PBO was determined to get some kind of HC for all the people who did not have it
@admiralmpj @AuntLulie @smileyt22 @Mahogany1992 @pannlewis44 @CeciliaLisa3033 @Backstorymom1 @KelliSmith15 @MzDivah67 @Robin_Volpi @nanblunt @CUSunset Well that’s what they are going to have to do anyhow. It would take over a year to even get through . all the committees
@admiralmpj @AuntLulie @smileyt22 @Mahogany1992 @pannlewis44 @CeciliaLisa3033 @Backstorymom1 @KelliSmith15 @MzDivah67 @Robin_Volpi @nanblunt @CUSunset I think the Governor of CA might have mentioned something like that. I have to learn more about it because I don’t remember. But PBO wanted a Public Option, but the republicans was not hearing it. We barely got Obamacare.
@abronxchick @pannlewis44 @DLTrunnell @KelliSmith15 @veterans_i @BmoreTrell @Robin_Volpi Awe so cute
@AuntLulie @smileyt22 @Mahogany1992 @pannlewis44 @CeciliaLisa3033 @Backstorymom1 @KelliSmith15 @MzDivah67 @Robin_Volpi @nanblunt @CUSunset @admiralmpj Yes Smiley and Nancy Pelosi is not going to let them get rid of it. That’s Her signature program. She’s the one who made sure it was passed. She was Speaker at the time.
@abronxchick @pannlewis44 @DLTrunnell @KelliSmith15 @veterans_i @BmoreTrell @Robin_Volpi Yes we miss you so.
Yes. The media would have you think that all of these progressive dems were elected in November. But more moderate dems won. We flipped those seats from Red States. The media are trying to divide the party to build up rating. Not gonna happen. Let them get their own party. https://t.co/FX3iUMrcae

The first thing they need to do is fix the ACA which is law now. You’re not going to leave 20 million people without HC while you debate medicare for all. Obamacare is law. Fix it
