@RyanNewYork Tell me something Ryan		Are you happy in this twitter verse?
@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive I think it‚Äôs much more likely the nominee will be able to ‚Äúplay in both lanes‚Äù. 		Remember - a full-blown progressive (not even DSA) probably doesn‚Äôt win in NJ-7, NJ-11, NY-11, or NY-19 in 18. 		Party needs the debate, and needs to reunite fully afterwards.
@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive Frustration &amp; anger noted, Owen. 		I would pull back on the ‚ÄúGOP Lite‚Äù talk.  Gives the impression both parties are the same - at a time when their agendas could not be more divergent, and with literally EVERYTHING at stake.  		Great line on the trail - dangerous while governing.
@wfbor @NewsBreakers @FiOS1NewsLHV The feeling is meh-tual, Bill!  		Should point out - the show does not have it‚Äôs own handle (so... I‚Äôm not the one who got that account suspended)		I should add up the all-time prediction scores for show #251
Folks, I say this with love (and as someone who loves political polling):		2020 polls right now are USELESS.  		No one really knows the candidates, none have been road tested.  		It‚Äôs like asking someone what car they want to buy - just from photos and one paragraph.

@firehorse1200 State GOP rammed through a bill mandating a primary if the election was redone.  Almost like they knew this was coming...
Haven't had time to check my timeline... has anyone used "InflateGate" yet, or can I lay claim to it?
Anyone know the policies in NC for special Congressional elections?  Are there primaries?
Don‚Äôt understand why so many of my fellow #Caps fans would be upset to have Hagelin on the team. 		Yes, he WAS a Caps killer - but he‚Äôd be super motivated to beat the Pens, and show he‚Äôs still a champion.  		And the team needs some help.

@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive Not sure I agree with you about Amazon, Owen... I'm not dug in enough on how it collapsed (vacation - I'll get there).  		But, as for centrists vs. prog. left - too many Dems fear the debate (might lead to DT re-elect), but really fear the policy shifts.  		The debate is healthy.
Re-upping this thread... for some reason this top tweet did not show up in my timeline...		re:  this weekend's #NewsBreakers on @FiOS1NewsLHV https://t.co/30dKy0BxUU
I‚Äôve apologized to both men directly ‚Äì wanted to do so again here.  Also wanted to apologize to our viewers ‚Äì who may have been wondering why a show that does not air repeats ‚Äì aired a repeat.  		Thanks to you all for watching!
Both interviews will run on #NewsBreakers in the future ‚Äì Kaplowitz intact, and Wray either via editing ‚Äì or by redoing the interview (it‚Äôs a really interesting story about municipal planning and development).
We simply could not air the interview as it was ‚Äì it would have come across as though we did not realize the Amazon deal was dead.  And, rather than have a colleague perform complicated surgery on the interview, we just yanked the show, and aired one that had aired previously.
Friday, sitting on a beach, I read about Amazon killing the deal, and realized it would impact the interview with the Mayor.
That‚Äôs also what led to the show not airing.  I was on vacation last week, and taped my interview with Mayor Wray on Feb 1, when the Amazon deal was still very much alive...
Mayor Wray was on to discuss the redevelopment of the old GE site ‚Äì which will have a larger imprint &amp; impact on Sleepy Hollow than the Amazon deal would have had on LIC and Queens (based on how many people live in both communities right now).
@mikekaplowitz was scheduled to discuss his retirement, if his role in the 4-year GOP coalition led to that decision, and his thoughts on the present &amp; future of county government &amp; politics...
So, this weekend‚Äôs edition of @FiOS1NewsLHV's #NewsBreakers was not the show we were intending to air.  There‚Äôs a bit of a backstory, but let me begin my publicly apologizing to the scheduled guests, retiring Westchester Legislator @mikekaplowitz &amp; #SleepyHollow NY Mayor Ken Wray
@larrymerg @brianthemerg @AmericanAir I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever get over Macho Grande
@AndrewSolender And a fair counterpoint at that 		To which I respond: you can use your insights and powers as you choose.   To elevate the debate - or make it more entertaining.  		There are times when I HAVE to make the latter choice.  You don‚Äôt.
@AndrewSolender Why are you playing Veep games, Cuz?  There‚Äôs 436 candidates for POTUS right now, more than enough grist for a Sunday night twitter chat.  		Considering the underside of a ticket this far out, is, respectfully, a waste of time.
@joesgammato1 @GeorgeLatimerCE Allow me to add my two hands to that -literal- *smattering* of applause.  		Happy for you, but I‚Äôve heard putts for double bogeys get a bigger hand
@Galante118DFS @OPRupdate @ppapoker @JGPretlow some lawmakers are hesitant to agree to either or both... others have local concerns (tribal casinos), others have moral objections.  		Thought is one is more likely to pass than both - and sports betting is MUCH more $$$

@lyn_cade @tomwatson I don't know you, Fools, not sure how much you know about me.  But, if you think insulting anyone asking a legit clarifying question is "acting clueless," what exactly are you expecting?  ESP?
@tomwatson fair enough.  thanks for clarifying.
@tomwatson As a political reporter, Tom, not sure I know what you mean here... what behavior - and what do you mean "when the chips were down."  Dems were pretty confident through most of 2016, until Nov. 6th...

@Taryn19 @FiOS1NewsLHV Should the fates work in my favor - I have already decided where I will celebrate...
@Taryn19 @FiOS1NewsLHV Ah, well.  No jackpot for me :(
@Taryn19 @FiOS1NewsLHV On a COMPLETELY unrelated note (rolling my own eyes at this...)		Any idea what the voting window is for Best of Westchester, Taryn?
I do - though NB's formal charge is to cover Hudson Valley issues and politics - seems appropriate to also cover Albany during the session.  		Works well, given heavy influence HV now has in State Senate, and hence, all of Albany &amp; state https://t.co/HyA5bEU7mn
Funny you should ask about extending our interviews, Taryn... 		The full interview with Sen, Mayer (and most NB interviews) run about 20 minutes - but we can only air less than half.  		Full interviews &amp; panel segments can always be found at https://t.co/b4f6yMIQYH https://t.co/hFz02hJLqv

Takeaway from this speech:  Another shutdown is coming in 3 weeks.
Other than "we have reached a deal," there's nothing in this speech that's going to turn down the temperature.
This isn't the end - it's a 3-week mute button
This isn't politics.  This is a D-Level telenovela.

@TJMcCormack Expressing my opinions doesn‚Äôt impact my credibility; having opinions doesn‚Äôt either.  You‚Äôre asking about bias - I leave that up to viewers to decide (perhaps better informed, IMO, because I‚Äôve expressed opinions).

This MIGHT be interesting... https://t.co/ndfPRPQEuf
@Romaine_a_clef Correct.  And not in conflict with my comment.  		My point is, she needs to/should decide and announce today.
@tomwatson Much respect, Tom.  We'll just agree to disagree on this one...
@tomwatson Except that now, after the DT letter, she's stringing along the nation, not just POTUS.  	My opinion:  people want to know, and now is not the time to not give the people what they want...
Either way, Pelosi now needs to announce a SOTU decision TODAY
Okay, let's poll.  		What should Pelosi do over SOTU?
We'll iron out the kinks - likely will do 1-2 of these a week.  		Brodsky's not the call-in type... I always keep an eye out for my father - who did try to call once while I was hosting. https://t.co/OrWcyJBQr0

@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive RF is worried (with reason) about the potential blowback from the public if Pelosi's cancelling SOTU is seen as too much partisan gamesmanship.  		 I don't worry about that - it's already been priced in by voters.  Plus DT is the ultimate partisan gamer.
Appreciate the shout-out, TJ... 		To be clear, Bill and Richard are "pundits" - I'm just asking questions.  		I try not to opine on NB, especially since I get an outlet for that every weekday on RFL. https://t.co/qmfrrnmO6a

If you're a fan of #NewsBreakers, not only should you be following @RichardBrodsky &amp; @wfbor (Bill O'Reilly), but I'd like to introduce you to @JennaMRussell - she's the show's director and works (&amp; fails) to make me look good every weekend.
Trying to imagine the conversations at the White House that led to cancelling Pelosi's trip.  		"Cancelling SOTU - pretty childish.  Okay, find something equally childish we can do to respond!"		"Great idea, sir!!"
What is your least-satisfying, least filling item always listed as an ‚Äúentree‚Äù at a restaurant?		My nominee is ravioli.  I‚Äôm always still hungry after.  It‚Äôs like a appetizer, masquerading as an entree.
I enjoyed it as well, Senator!  The first of many such conversations, I hope! https://t.co/UlFiItmNsJ
Unbecoming?  		Advice to the GOP:  Forget Pelosi is a woman - you're not scoring points referencing her gender whenever you can.  		Just treat her like every other Speaker.  But enough "Ms. Pelosi" and "unbecoming" - just say you think "Speaker Pelosi" is "wrong." https://t.co/FCiiJHUGdl

Here's how the AP is describing DT's request:  		"President Donald Trump says he will address the nation Tuesday night about what says is a "crisis" at the U.S.-Mexico border."		Even they are putting "crisis" in quotes.  Says a lot.
If I was running a network, this would be a legit tough call.  Clearly has partisan intent, but he is POTUS.  		Inclination:  tape it, see what he says, air it if non-partisan.  		Want to give benefit of doubt to the office, but POTUS has blown benefit of my doubt... https://t.co/TCja4BpUE8

@gunpoliticsny @AOC @repjoecrowley Okay, but... he didn't, and she did.  And, unless you take odds on him winning the seat back, perhaps it's best to focus on, you know... the ACTUAL member of Congress?
By the way, PLENTY of Dems throw shade on her, as well... "gotta know something before you speak" is a common jab.  		It's an error.  For the party, and for themselves.  		And, I'm SURE her gender plays a role in how she's treated
It's kind of amazing to see how the right is so shaken by the rise of @AOC.  Not sure if they see her as "smearable" (the way they frame Pelosi), or are just so threatened by the rise of a popular, populist woman.

Okay, never pose a question on twitter without researching first.  		It‚Äôs an OLD dispute, both states claim governance, feds seem willing to let the dispute stand.  		So maybe ask @GovMurphy to chip in, @NYGovCuomo?

There has been a @firehorse1200 tweetstorm.  I shall reply as best I can...
I've seen it six times, including the 15th anniversary celebration - and I even met Lucy T. Slut...		Is it any wonder I just got a front-row seat to see @avenueqmusical's finale in NY this April?
Did you just compare yourself to Toby Zeigler?		Would this be too early to unfollow? https://t.co/giXMK3h4gS
Am publicly declaring that I am now following Joseph Sgammato (@joesgammato1) here on Twitter, so at least one person on this site can sleep easier.  		And yes, he would LOVE to buy a vowel.
@joesgammato1 You're both a funny - and sneaky man, Joe...
@joesgammato1 Guessing you got the same press release...
I think it goes back even earlier - and speaks to the erosion of GOP group-think.  		First person I recall using the term was Rush Limbaugh in the early days of the Clinton administration.  		Was an outlier then.  Now - mainstream. https://t.co/TJnV9C6dcc
Guys, it's the "Democratic" Party, not the "Democrat" Party.  		Just got an official press release on a COUNTY level with this error.  		See if you can find a single example of George HW Bush calling them the "Democrat Party".  You can't.
@DominicTV You are too kind, Dom.  		Sat on this for 10 min or so, trying to come up with a pithy, funny, insightful, or otherwise special response.  		This is what I came up with.
The past 5 minutes on Twitter:  @DominicTV relives meeting Nelson Mandela, while I make a joke comparing my mother to Robert Mueller.  		It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm not doing the twitter correctly.
It‚Äôs possible that my mother is actually Robert Mueller.  		I mean, she used to spring perjury traps for me ALL THE TIME.  		Like ‚Äúhow was school?‚Äù - on days I had cut.  		Perjury traps are BRUTAL.  		Of course, I was lying... but perjury traps are so UNAMERICAN, mom!
and 45 minutes later... to the bathroom door. https://t.co/HF0rCAIMOw
That may be too fine a point, Tom.  		On 1/3, Moulton, Rice, et al can either elect Nancy Pelosi or Kevin McCarthy speaker.  There are no other options.  		They'll have to decide, for themselves and their voters, which of the two is the lesser "evil."  		Should be a no-brainer. https://t.co/1xnimxcetV
@firehorse1200 I dare say, a permanent RFL with @wfbor, @RichardBrodsky, @DominicTV, @RichFrenchLive and myself would be entertaining - and exhausting!  We'd reach burnout in 5 weeks (or less)!  		Fortunately, Bill &amp; Richard have and need their own careers - so that just ain't happening.
@firehorse1200 Again, my thanks!

@firehorse1200 By the way - we need to disagree on something to make this an argument... need to strongly disagree to make it a "good argument".  		Hockey and sake, anyone?
@firehorse1200 Plus, if Nelson and Gillum couldn't win in this climate, when could they?  Feel the same about Ohio, where Dems not named Brown all lost.  PA, WI, MI are my 2020 worries.
@firehorse1200 I'll stand by that.  The macro economy (stock markets, corp profits, hiring, etc) are all doing relatively well... but, on the micro level - I don't think the overwhelming majority of Americans are feeling that lift.  And 401(k) growth is an abstract for most.
@firehorse1200 I believe I said that spikes in hate and anti-Semitism typically come during bad economies... and that that's not the case today in the macro (though it may be more than we've measured in the micro)
@firehorse1200 This I do not recall saying, Owen.  I find the need for constant expansion by corporations to be problematic - when just making  profit isn't enough, we've got real troubles...
@firehorse1200 Refresh my memory - can you repost my map?		Also, if it ain't red - it's certainly purple.  		Might you be confusing PA with Ohio and Florida - which I recently declared to both be red states?   		Love a good argument (bad ones, as well).  Just a question of how much time i have
@jonyedin Actually, yeah.  		Saw Ep 1 in theaters... but got a case of the Jar-Jars, and never went back.  		Picked it back up for ep 7
Also... 1-3 just RUINED the end of Jedi for me.  		How and why does Anakin get to become a ‚Äúghost Jedi‚Äù after all the crap he did?		And, why would Obi-Wan and Yoda be all smiling and cool with that?  His appearance there would feel like a fart in a Mini
Took awhile, but thanks to cable have recently finished watching the Star Wars prequels.  		Can‚Äôt get over Anakin Skywalker. 		In eps 4-6, he‚Äôs the most evil thing ever.  		After watching eps 1-3, turns out he‚Äôs just an idiot.

@tomwatson @Bakari_Sellers I get that.  Also possible to overreach on oversight.  		For example - Kavanaugh follow.  Better to investigate privately, then call witnesses if there a *there* there.  Going fishing in a public hearing could do more harm than good.

@firehorse1200 Really?  If the party moves too far left, they can kiss the industrial midwest, the south, and Texas good-bye (and the White House).  		Look how Dems won last night - progressives in lib districts, moderates in moderate districts.
Dems found ways to win (and lose) in PA, MI, WI, and OH last night - states they NEED to win in two years.  		Party needs to make sure they're repped in leadership and committees, and part of the coalition.  		Trump's paths to victory - and defeat - in 20 shone through last night
Like I said - it's Trump on steroids for the next two years,  		It's gonna be an all-American reboot of Limbo Rock:  How Low Can You Go?

@GersonBorrero Well, at least your opinions in this thread have kept a consistent quality level.  		Also consistent - your desire to mute the voices of people you disagree with.  How patriotic.
The only reason I'm responding at this point, is because of the personal invectives you keep adding to the end of your replies.  		Executives (Prez, Gov, Mayor) have the right in moments like these - and the press has a responsibility.  Info, appeals for calm, updates, etc. https://t.co/lgsgaV3Kby

@GersonBorrero @SquarePegDem @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor I‚Äôll end with this:   You‚Äôre calling this one wrong. 		Makes no difference to me who you‚Äôre voting for - or what party you‚Äôre with. 		To suggest Gov or Mayor not get air time after a terror attack, because they gain political advantage from it is wrong.
@GersonBorrero @SquarePegDem @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @ZackFinkNews OMG, seriously?		Read Fink.  Complaints about air time?  Fine.  Saying they should not be given air time?  Seriously not fine. 		I mentioned the mayor early in my responses, then focused on Gov in response to MB. 		Got any more crap you want to throw in defense of your bad point?
@GersonBorrero @SquarePegDem @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor It also offends me as a reporter.  OF COURSE they can and should be heard from.  		If you don‚Äôt like POTUS, should he not be allowed to do press?		Finally, I‚Äôm angry because you are both men I respect for your service and insight - but you‚Äôre both far better than this pettiness.
@GersonBorrero @SquarePegDem @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor Because you both argued against having the mayor and governor speak to the press after a series of bombs were found in their city and state.  		I‚Äôm offended by the petty rediculousness of that comment - in times of crisis, we have want and need to hear from leaders.
@SquarePegDem @GersonBorrero Also - why use ‚Äúattack‚Äù in quotes, just like POTUS did this morning with ‚Äúbomb‚Äù?  		Are you also denying these pipe bombs were an attack?  A terror attacking?  		Yet another terror attack on NY?

@joesgammato1 Perhaps we both need to invest in some lives, my friend!
@joesgammato1 I'd even prefer doing it in Jan/Feb, and make the budget begin in March.  		There's just no way to get a decent level of constituent involvement during November and December.
@joesgammato1 The timeline for the budget process is so opaque, Joe and I will be the only ones commenting on it.  		And Joe's only chiming in because he has to.
@joesgammato1 Mine was intentional.  I got all the words.  The best words.
Joe, do you think this is the best time of year for the county to do budget work? https://t.co/CJayfTUugp
#FixTheCharter	#ChangeTheCalendar	#NotBlamingAnyone	#MoreOpennessEqualsMoreGooder https://t.co/CJayfTUugp
Will note, for fairness - has been this way as long as I've been covering the county - going back through Astorino and Spano (and probably far earlier)
This is not on @GeorgeLatimerCE - but Westchester's budget timeline is totally screwy.  Always comes during election season and holidays, when constituent focus is elsewhere.  		Would love to see the county adjust it's fiscal year to make process more transparent

To all my transgender friends, and to all who see this tweet:		I‚Äôm so sorry.  		I cannot imagine what today must feel like for you - and I hurt all over because of it.

My apologies.  I forgot in all the confusion.  I shall issue a corrective immediately. https://t.co/21B0WaczI1
DEBATE REMINDER:  		We're in #NY02 tonight, as @RepPeteKing takes on @liuba4congress - LIVE on every RNN &amp; FiOS channel (including @FiOS1News_LI)...		6pm tonight.
If either can come together - would tape next week and play portions of those debates on next weekend's NB.  		If not, will air the entirety of @vote4murphy &amp; @PeteforNy next weekend.  		This weekend is @DavidCarlucci &amp; @vanderhoefscott in Dist. 38 on @FiOS1NewsLHV
Final Debate Note:  		Still no progress in SSen Dists 39 or 41.  		@Karen4NYSenate (Smythe) in 41 has said she's available - nothing from @Sueserino4ny in 41, or from @Tom_Basile or @JamesSkoufis in 39.

@Nycd16Indivis Working on it.
@Nycd16Indivis Anyhow... on to more important matters.
@Nycd16Indivis Perhaps I'm misstating my point.  I get no sense residents there like Trump any less - they just think his name is bad for home values... but they continue to live a Trumpian lifestyle.  		As, I suspect, many Trump supporters hide that support - until they enter the voting booth
@Nycd16Indivis Is it?  Or just the equivalent of a Trump voter who won't admit their support to a pollster?
There may be an election metaphor in there somewhere.  Or not.
I hope the crews are blocking traffic on Riverside Blvd, like those buildings allow/encourage every morning during the rush.  		I always feel a sense of entitlement when I pass by - that has little to do with the name on the buildings.  Removing the name is a fig leaf. https://t.co/7SdPE72Pym
Positive response from one of the two camps.  More coming soon (fingers crossed)
THURSDAY DEBATE UPDATE:		There may be some movement on a another LHV State Senate debate - which would air next weekend.  		This is all happening offline right now - awaiting final word (and times) from both campaigns.  		Stay tuned.  An announcement could some soon.
I'll say it again:  I don't trust any polling this #midterm season - unless you view it with a +/- 10 points.  		Why?  Turnout.  		No one knows which groups will turn out in what levels.
I‚Äôve had no contact with anyone representing @vote4murphy since Monday.  		I will reach out - offline - to take their temperature. https://t.co/1z5i93hd6H
Are you posting this as an argument against having a debate? https://t.co/1iezSXeWxL

BTW - I told Michael I was going to tweet about the conversation - continuing my efforts at transparency during this process.
If I gave the impression they had not responded to my inquiries AT ALL, my apologies.  They had not responded to my Twitter inquiries about next week until this call.  		I'm hopeful we can make a debate with @PeteforNy happen.
Just spoke with @michaelvlawler on behalf of @vote4murphy - they are reviewing possible debate slots for next week.  		For transparency's sake -  I will point out the Murphy campaign previously responded to earlier debate inquiries for slots now passed - or no longer viable
Still hoping to hear from @Sueserino4ny, @vote4murphy, @JamesSkoufis and @Tom_Basile about availability.  		Willing to host 30 minute debates next M, W, Th, or F - for air on @FiOS1NewsLHV's NewsBreakers		All negotiations to be done publicly - right here on Twitter.
Monday Morning State Senate Debate Update:  		No new contacts over the weekend.  @Karen4NYSenate (Smythe) and @PeteforNy (Harckham) remain the only candidates to have accepted my outreach for debates next week.
Schedule a debate?  I've still got 30-minute afternoon slots available next Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday to tape a debate for @FiOS1NewsLHV's NewsBreakers.  		Harckham is willing - just name a time, and we'll talk some issues! https://t.co/P88EoTLbh6
All the #midterm polling - from firms you know, firms you don‚Äôt, campaigns and parties all hide a glaring flaw. 		Turnout.  No one really knows who‚Äôs going to show up - and at what levels.  		Given that, there are more tossups this cycle than any I can recall.  Fed/State/Local
2020 polls are meaningless until after the midterms.  		Period.
...perhaps in a 30-minute, televised format where key issues can be discussed and analyzed by the senator and another person seeking the same office...		There‚Äôs gotta be a term for that...
Also, not sure who‚Äôs manning the @WestchesterGOP account (I have some ideas...), but if I were the @vote4murphy campaign, I would ask them to go quiet - and let the campaign - or better yet, the senator - speak for it/himself.
Saturday morning update:		No new contact with any campaigns about holding a State Senate debate on @FiOS1NewsLHV‚Äôs NewsBreakers.  		There‚Äôs still more than a week to schedule one. Or three. 		Just @ me, and we‚Äôll set it up.  Publicly.

To be fair, the offers are on short notice (for air this weekend or next).  Some campaigns have already indicated a willingness - but their opponents have yet to do the same.   I'm not going to disclose which campaigns have and have not responded...
These would, of course, compliment the debate we already have scheduled in the 38th District (@DavidCarlucci &amp; @vanderhoefscott).

WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT FORD &amp; KAVANAUGH? 		I'm hosting @RichFrenchLive tonight, and we're TAKING YOUR CALLS!  		(And @firehorse1200 - I'm personally inviting you to call!!!)  		6pm, #RNN, @FiOS1NewsLHV, @FiOS1NewsNJ, @FiOS1News_LI
@firehorse1200 I did.  And, I'm glad to see the Senate and POTUS have begun an FBI investigation.  		But I wasn't about to smile until it became official - which did NOT happen at the Judiciary today
So, it seems like this "delay" on Kavanaugh is entirely up to Mitch McConnell to abide by their wishes.  		Good luck with that.
Wait... is that "upstate"? https://t.co/eXFDAla6O6
@brianthemerg Honestly not sure if this is more about gender, violence,  and power - as much as it is partisanship and tribalism (the Sen reax, not the testimony)
What's the biggest factor in your view of Kavanaugh and the Senate vote:
Welcome to the team, @DaveASloan.  		Just read your Twitter bio.  		Here's the fun part about his NBA claim:  Dave is 4 1/2 feet tall (approximately - hard to tell from my elevation)
Gotta break my silence listening to Cornyn here.  Calling attempts to have Judge testify untoward, b/c he's a recovering alcoholic and cancer survivor and doesn't like speaking in public.  		Dr. Ford is ALSO is recovering from trauma, also shy - but no such deference to her.
I may go drive around in my car just to listen! https://t.co/8zYA1XXrNn
Does anyone think Mitchell has made any inroads on Ford that might weaken the impact of her testimony?  		If so - what points would those be?

@tomwatson @FiOS1NewsLHV @RichardBrodsky @wfbor Will add it to the list - have not seen any public polling on it, so not sure we‚Äôll have anything to go on other than word of mouth...
Fans of #NewsBreakers on @FiOS1NewsLHV - here's your chance to be a NewsBreaker of your own!  		Got a question about HV or NYS politics?  Tweet them here, and I'll have @RichardBrodsky &amp; @wfbor answer them on-air - by name!  		Send Q's before Wednesday AM.  Thanks!

Something rings odd about this.  Would understand Dems wanting SPM off the ballot for AG. 		The GOP push here feels like they‚Äôre scared of him as the nominee or actual AG - or want to bounce him from house race somehow. https://t.co/SY1Chxzw9m

@Wstchr7Resists @PressSec History will be kinder to Burr than to Trump or Putin
Regarding today's @PressSec briefing:  Sanders listed what Trump and Putin spoke about in private... according to whom?  Is that what Trump said they discussed?  No one else was in the room...		...and we know both of those men have difficulty telling the truth...

@DaveCatalfamo Let dad off the hook.  Not like he had any control over that anyhow.  		Have a good weekend - kisses to Jess.
@DaveCatalfamo And if VPOTUS had tweeted about AOC, that would be relevant to this thread. 		He didn‚Äôt.  He elevated Nixon to make his point.  		So, perhaps your beef is with him, not me, David
@DaveCatalfamo (Top)
@DaveCatalfamo Fine.  Forget the polls. Anything could still happen. 		Still doesn‚Äôt make Nixon anywhere CLOSE to being a ‚Äútoo Dem‚Äù
@DaveCatalfamo Actually - not Pence.  A Pence tweet. 		He inflated her stature to use her to attack Democrats in general. 		And now, you are, too.
@DaveCatalfamo How many elections has she won?  How many Dems proudly announce ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Nixon Dem‚Äù beyond NY?  		She‚Äôs a ‚Äútop Dem‚Äù like I‚Äôm a network anchor (wishing does not make it so). 		But go ahead - make Mike Pence the hill you choose to die on.
@DaveCatalfamo Really, David?  So Nixon is a ‚Äútop dem‚Äù?  There are 20+ Democrats rumored to be running for POTUS, 49 in the senate, 20+ governors, then there‚Äôs Cynthia Nixon. 		Explain to me how she‚Äôs a ‚Äútop Dem‚Äù
@DominicTV ...and on the 37th day, G-d created cows.  On the 38th, he created the ‚Äúmoo‚Äù.
Cynthia Nixon is in no way a ‚Äútop Dem,‚Äù Mr. Vice President.  		Check recent polling. https://t.co/QYvrjS0GeA
@MLBrendan @politicony @TheDemocrats I even corrected @RSP_1865  3 times Thursday when I hosted him on the RFL panel.  		He insisted on calling it the ‚ÄúDemocrat party,‚Äù I corrected him 3 time on air.
@MLBrendan @politicony @TheDemocrats I will occasionally use the terms ‚ÄúDems‚Äù and ‚ÄúGOPers,‚Äù but ‚ÄúDemocrat party‚Äù is actually an insult - I remember Rush using it 1st in the 90‚Äôs.
@firehorse1200 I‚Äôve watched all of 10 minutes of this World Cup, but in a year when the Capitals and Eagles won unexpectedly - I guess I‚Äôll go with England.  Because they *could* win, but no one expects them to.
@firehorse1200 First of all - if you can get a hashtag with my name trending, I‚Äôll give you 10% of all the earnings derived from said trending. Could be profitable...
That voters still trust the GOP on the deficit - given that the Trump tax cuts just exploded the deficit - shows a) how little most voters are invested in key issues, and b) Dems have terrible messaging. https://t.co/TN5AAtaOFm

Still don't understand why all of Liberty Island had to be evacuated yesterday... I know there were fears about the strength of the statue's skin, but evacuating the whole island feels like overkill - and a way to further penalize the protester in the public's eye.
From @politicony's Albany note:  Tracy Mitrano will represent the Democrat party..."  		Am I the only one (Democrats included) who still insists on calling @TheDemocrats by their ACTUAL name ("Democratic Party")?		Began as an insult, and no one fights it anymore.
@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive Many people, rightly or wrongly, look at ICE as the immigration police.  Now imagine, after Ferguson (or myriad other incidents), the response was to call to "abolish the police".  		That's what I suspect many moderates hear when the cry is to "abolish ICE".

@firehorse1200 @wfbor no, that's why I went with "true compassionate conservative."  My sense was GWB was using that as a label/selling point, Kennedy never called himself that.  		But Bill is compassionate.  And a conservative.
@firehorse1200 @RichFrenchLive @RichardBrodsky was particularly ornery last night.  He'll probably question that premise... just like he challenged every premise I presented on the air last night!
But the SCOTUS debate reveals a lot about Bill and other Cons - may not like the entire package of policy changes a conservative court will bring, but they like enough to support another Trump pick.  On balance, they believe it will be a benefit.
I'd call @wfbor a true "compassionate conservative."  He's conservative on economic and some social issues - but does care about the impact on individuals, and bucks the ideology when impacts are too negative.  1/2 https://t.co/Hu5RIKwquO

@andreagrimes @mattzollerseitz If they all walk out en masse, that leaves only ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù outlets in the room, and it really does become a propaganda platform.  Im frustrated too, but at least the right questions are still being asked.
Trump saluting a NK general doesn't really feel like a big deal, especially grading on the curve of other Trump actions.  		But the way the right went mental on Obama whenever he did anything remotely (in their minds) weak or "unpatriotic" makes the salute sadly relevant.
@NickReisman Gotta give them credit for putting a "grading scale" on a report card about schools/education.   You know, for those not familiar with the "A" through "F" grade scale, or how it works.

@ShibaRussell @IHOb Might be the best example, Shiba.  If you want ketchup on it - maybe time to find a different burger.  		Same with their pancakes... though if you even consider ketchup on pancakes, you're doing breakfast wrong.

@phil_oliva Again, up to voters to decide.  		Just a reminder:  this is Molinaro‚Äôs first, and arguably most important, policy/leadership decision as presumptive GOP nominee.
@phil_oliva Whether Killian is qualified is up to voters. 		My point continues to be, based on her resume and experience in elective office, she is not, on paper, qualified to be governor. 		I submit, once again, you would not have been ok if Cuomo had nominated a Rye council member for LtG
@phil_oliva Take off the partisan blinders for a moment. 		If Cuomo or Spitzer had nominated a LtG whose only elective experience was on the Rye city council, would you really be cool with that?
@phil_oliva Phil, this argument is nonsense.  No one disputes being a Senator or Governor is prep for becoming POTUS.  		Do you really think city council experience in the 35th largest city in NY is prep to be Governor?
@phil_oliva Congresswoman &gt; city council member.

So, GO CAPS!  #ALLCAPS  		And, Willy ‚Äì we love you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a guy every other team hates ‚Äì and would love to have playing for them!
But, I am still hopeful ‚Äì and think if the team can overcome this suspension (and a win tonight would go a LONG way to doing that), the Caps will emerge even stronger ‚Äì and be a force to be reckoned with.
Plus, a 3-game ban is an obvious overreaction/make-up for allowing earlier borderline calls.  		And, all of this, just as Caps fans were beginning to buy-in to the hopes of a long playoff run once again, so I understand the frustration and anger of our fan base.
The time to fix this was in the offseason ‚Äì or before the playoffs‚Ä¶ tell teams the games will all be called the same way ‚Äì or else, consistently call the games all the way through the playoffs.  The Wilson suspension seems like a change in rules mid-stream.
Now, with Wilson emerging, the team is a little more balanced.  And the lack of calls on other borderline plays confirmed that Wilson‚Äôs style was acceptable, and allowed.   Of course, now the suspension has left the team unbalanced again ‚Äì and possibly less equipped for playoffs.
In recent years, that‚Äôs worked against the Caps ‚Äì our skill helped the team dominate the regular season, but then the lack of whistles in the playoffs held our skill players in check.
Problem is, the two systems reward two distinctly different styles of play ‚Äì skill during the regular season, and rough/tough play during the postseason.
This is all the result of the NHL essentially having two sets of rules for its two seasons‚Ä¶ ‚Äúnormal‚Äù officiating during the regular season, and ‚Äúwhistles in pockets‚Äù reffing during the playoffs.

@Wstchr7Resists @Shelley4Senate @FiOS1NewsLHV It's a practical impossibility.  But, 22% turnout for a State Senate special is pretty darned impressive.
@firehorse1200 If you're referring to my comments on RFL Monday, that was the line I thought Democrats should use - impeachment as oversight as last resort.  I also said Dems should not campaign on it, but follow the Mueller findings.
Turnout in the #SD37 vote was 22.2% yesterday... without checking prior specials, that feels like a BIG turnout for a special election.  Kudos to all those who voted for aiding our democracy.  		Also, @Shelley4Senate on NB this weekend on @FiOS1NewsLHV

Okay, I‚Äôve started this rant‚Ä¶ perhaps I‚Äôll feel better if people list their own examples.  How have you seen people abandoning common courtesy around you?  		#CommonCourtesy
Yes, we‚Äôve gotten coarse in many aspects ‚Äì including our politics.  But, for everyone wondering how we find our way back ‚Äì how about a little consideration for others?
Or the people I see sampling off salad bars, or people who use the speaker while on the phone in public ‚Äì often on the sidewalk.
This rant doesn‚Äôt even include how selfishly people drive (like slow drivers in the passing lane), or people who cut the line for no good reason‚Ä¶
I calmly explained I was waiting for a register to open, she again said, ‚Äútwo lines!‚Äù  Later, she asked if I wanted to go ahead ‚Äì but this was clearly too important to her.
In the other, I was waiting for a register to open up at an eatery, when a woman raced past me ‚Äì and shouted out, ‚Äútwo lines!‚Äù
When I finally touched my horn (gently) a minute later, they looked at me like I had stolen their bicycles.  Never mind that they were holding up traffic.
Two examples today.  In garage, two people were chatting with a driver in the lane I was trying to use.  I waited patiently, then flashed my lights. They looked up, then down, and continued chatting.
Lamenting the death of common courtesy in our society.  	Too many people acting like they‚Äôre the only people on the planet ‚Äì and certainly the only people who matter.

10/ Also ‚Äì questions for 5 GOP members on BOL ‚Äì will wait to see if any get committee chairs, legislative pushed, or other benefits for joining.
9/ More questions for "coup" participants M.J. Shimsky &amp; L. Williams ‚Äì who were not part of previous coalition: what are they receiving for participation?
8/ ‚ÄúCoup‚Äù includes @mikekaplowitz &amp; Virginia Perez, who were somewhat on outs with Dem caucus after previous coup/coalition BOL‚Äôs‚Ä¶
7/ Plus, ‚Äúcoup‚Äù passes over two women ‚Äì Parker &amp; Borgia, right at apex of ‚ÄúMe Too,‚Äù and on heels of @Oprah‚Äôs message last night.
6/ May also be bad PR:  1st action since big Dem win pits Dems vs. Dems in very public divide‚Ä¶		@IndivisWstchr ‚Äì which played key role in big Nov. wins - livid at deal, likening it to IDC in State Senate
5/ Chair does receive more $, plus ability to shape/influence direction, agenda for board actions.
4/ May well be a personal issue:  Boykin power move + some dislike of C. Parker &amp; @CatherineBorgi1 in Dem caucus
@westchesterBOL @WestchesterDems 3/ There appears to be little policy/issue rationale for the ‚Äúcoup,‚Äù other than fears a @westchesterBOL led by Dem caucus could be ‚Äútoo liberal‚Äù
@westchesterBOL 2/ This, despite @WestchesterDems enjoying a massive election day win, securing a supermajority 12-5 majority on board.
DEVELOPING:  Benjamin Boykin almost a lock to be elected Chair of @WestchesterBOL today, leading a 5-Dem group voting with 5-GOPers in vote.

@artchixx @FiOS1News_LI Also, if investigations are underway - tell us.  If they're not, retract the claim.  		Oh, and if there ARE MS-13 living in HUD housing, why has nothing been done?  Why the threat that we "will evict" you - like nailing Capone for tax evasion.
@phil_oliva Maybe.  But my sense is that 2nd point was closer to what was actually happening.  		If I (over)stepped - my bad.
@col9847 Rico, every elected Democrat (as well as Republican) on Long Island talks about - and seeks to address the impact of MS-13.  All of them.  And we report on the threat, as well.  		But blanket allegations only make the process more difficult, hence my questions
@LynnePattonHUD @FiOS1News_LI When did I ask for resident info?  Just asking if you have investigations underway, or know of MS-13 living in HUD properties.  		Your tweet made allegations, I'm trying to determine what the basis for those allegations were.
Back from vacation - and hosting RFL all this week (6pm, RNN, @FiOS1NewsLHV, @FiOS1NewsNJ, @FiOS1News_LI).  		Only tweeted a little on break - and facing 19 notifications... responses to come shortly!
Madam administrator, you tweeted a warning to MS-13 members in HUD housing. Do you have any proof they‚Äôre there?  		Also, you might want to check out @FiOS1News_LI‚Äôs EXTENSIVE coverage of MS-13 before you accuse me of ignoring it. https://t.co/yKb3wKpsp6
So, @LynnePatton liked a response to my questioning of her tweet (despite it including an insult of POTUS), but declined to answer if there are any MS-13 members in HUD housing, like her tweet implied. https://t.co/qCqPf8Nk20
@col9847 Not arguing any of those points. I‚Äôm asking HUD‚Äôs regional administrator about MS-13 in HUD funded housing, since she posted a ‚ÄúDirty Harry‚Äù tweet about it.
Do you have any actual proof of MS-13 members living in any HUD housing in NY/NJ?  Any investigations?		Or are you just using your official government twitter account for political bluster, immigrant intimidation, and cheerleading for your boss? https://t.co/MxplCdGlOR
@newsysuzy OMG. You got the Doctor AND The Iceman?!?!!		This song is legendary in my family. Every 2-3 gatherings, that verse is sung or spoken. 		Seriously.
@makeNYTrueBlue @NYGovCuomo @NYSenate Unless I‚Äôve missed the resignations of @GeorgeLatimer37 and @revrubendiaz there IS no vacancy yet.  Perhaps pressure should be applied to them to trigger the special election process?
üëá 24 hours later - and still no reporting on who actually wrote this tweet? https://t.co/hBUQYA34M4
@lauriepuhn That‚Äôs an even lower threshold - a protection order can come without a conviction, arrest, or any formal adjudication.
@lauriepuhn Honestly not sure, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an automatic disqualifier. 		But if Cuomo proposal takes guns following protection orders, can a cop still cop without a gun?
Also (and this goes without saying) a play to progressives ahead of re-elect and 2020, and with Gillibrand stealing headlines this week.  		Interestingly - both Cuomo &amp; Gillibrand on the ballot this Nov.  Wonder who‚Äôll fare better?
This is a fire starter - with LOTS of questions.  Remove them permanently?  What about people from other states?  What about police officers? Apply to protection orders or convictions? https://t.co/QgpRoufutL

@CatherineBorgi1 @westchesterBOL Can‚Äôt be a surprise. 		Still have the votes for an override locked (or as close to locked as possible)?
RT @CatherineBorgi1: @WhitmanAndrew @westchesterBOL We expect the veto/override scenario
@jtwang_ @realDonaldTrump Only if you think GOP voters in Alabama stayed home &amp; Dems turned out because of Trump.  Maybe a few - but far more likely this was entirely about a horrific  candidate.
Careful reading too much into #ALSenateRace ‚Äî this was a referendum on one man, not the ideological/partisan divide.
@phil_oliva Perhaps (and for far more than RA wanted to sign for last year).  		But that still won‚Äôt cover the budget hole.  		So, what services would you cut?
Is your twitter name a reference to the Washington Bullets?  Would love to talk Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes... https://t.co/GHz8DJjuaP
So, what more would you cut, Phil?  Westchester‚Äôs now in a deep fiscal hole, sales tax revenue isn‚Äôt likely to save the day - even with airport and land sale, county‚Äôs facing a chasm. 		So, what services would you cut? https://t.co/L4Y5wWsmBT
If the 12-5 vote can hold, the @westchesterBOL can override an Astorino veto anyway. 		Better policy (for Dems) if RA signs it,  perhaps better politics/optics if he vetos + override. https://t.co/ouVxmK84F0

Okay, end of rant #2.  Gotta decide if this screws has polluted my karma too much to play in tourney. Then again, what else am I gonna do in AC?
Casinos used to give away freebies like candy - content to make their $ at the tables.  Now they‚Äôve monetized everything.  Including customer happiness.
Any industry can be destroyed from within. Make the service too available, maximize profits at expense of quality, and squeeze customers.
Just finished brunch and the register doesn‚Äôt take cash. At a casino.  No cash.
Service has been an absolute joke - though, given the real estate these guys walk just to handle a smattering of people, I don‚Äôt really blame them...
It‚Äôs like when I when exploring the ruins of Grossingers - except these places are broken down - and still open.

@OPReport Funny, Chris.  My first react was to check my tweet for typos!		I had forgotten how sad AC is.  Even sadder now.  They had a real opportunity here, and just BLEW it.
Okay, end of rant.  Got a tournament I‚Äôm carb-loading for.
t‚Äôs not the casinos fault (okay maybe a little) it‚Äôs ours.  This is who we are. 		Makes me wish dress codes and formality was still the norm.  I think we‚Äôve taken this casual thing too far.
If poker (online and cardroom) was legal in NY, I might never set foot an a casino again...
AC trip overlapped with Muni govt convention (unintentional), so saw other end of coin, too:		Officials being wined and dined at top end joints by interest groups and businesses investing in their futures...
..fashions ranging from school-suspension worthy to slept-in thrift store bargain bin grabs (yet they‚Äôre still gambling)...
...(when you can find an open casino. More closed casinos on boardwalk than open ones...)
And questionable taste: every food joint is a chain, every restaurant fronted by a celebrity...
Rampant obesity, poor health (and I assume health care), boredom, massive rationalizations...
Obviously poor economic choices, disillusioned faces, anger when longshots don‚Äôt come in, weary people...
Spend enough time at an AC casino and you begin to question America‚Äôs long term sustainability.

Westchester:  I'm putting turnout at 34.47% last night (someone check my math).  Not a huge boost from 2013's 33% turnout

@michaelvlawler Are you Talk of the Sound, Michael?  Or just trying to carry water for one candidate?  		(Also, kudos on the 280 characters).
@michaelvlawler We've reported on the property taxes, and responses from both candidates.  As for ax - as a reporter - if I had police report, I'd show it.

As to the Astorino spox now posting on this (my friends @wfbor &amp; @jessicaproud) is this the high-minded debate you and the CE really seek?
You also refer to Latimer as the "Democrat" nominee for County Executive in the first line.  You got the name of the party wrong.
Furthermore, you cite other elected officials whose district the incident occurred in - implying they should have known.  Why?
You also claim the incident was "hushed up" at New Rochelle City Hall - I would ask you to prove that claim.
You claim to have the police report from this.  Post it, so other orgs can research &amp; verify. https://t.co/gIoEGYAiTb

is possible.  My goal was to try and prevent this from happening on the local &amp; county level in the Lower Hudson Valley &amp; beyond...
our national politics has been polluted with these "divided facts," and when facts are in dispute, no debate nor reasoned decision-making...
My concern is the dispute over FACTS (pro IPA says it does not make WC a sanctuary, con side says it does).  For some time...
But I have been unable to bring both sides to the table for that critical debate... so the topic will not be a part of the show this weekend
Was hoping to host a #NewsBreakers debate on whether the Westchester #ImmigrantProtectionAct actually makes WC a "sanctuary county"...

@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino My guess?  This will be among top 3 issues for @RobAstorino's re-elect, as well as for all members of legislature  (9/9)
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino GOP/Astorino calling IPA "sanctuary county" bill, supporters say it's not.  Banking on that &amp; "law enforcement opposition" as defense 8/x
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino Electoral pressure (they're all up in Nov) and pressure from pro-IPA groups.  7/x
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino Dems would need 1 more vote to override veto (after L. Williams returns).  And there are some GOP legislators who could face pressure... 6/x
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino My guess is, when the story of this vote is written, GOP legislators probably got lots of pressure from Astorino to protect him 5/x
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino And this ain't a great topic for Astorino - who faces reelection for CE in Nov, and is eyeing another run for Governor next year 4/x
@westchesterBOL @RobAstorino Somewhat surprising; I had heard there was lots of support among legislators of both parties... but election day is 3 months from today 3/x
@westchesterBOL Not enough votes to overcome @RobAstorino veto - which is expected.  He'll be speaking soon to make his position clear.  (2/x)
Westchester Immigrant Protection Act passed @westchesterBOL 10-5.  2 GOPers (Maisano &amp; Gelfarb) voted yes, 1 gop/1 Dem absent (1/x)

@JGPretlow ...than they currently believe it is, could move the needle a little.  		So, I we're looking at an inside straight.  Possible, not likely
@JGPretlow ...a priority topic.  But calls and pressure can change that.  May not change minds, but if members sense this is a bigger deal...
@JGPretlow My conclusion for iPoker/#poker advocates?  Now would be the time to call and lobby Assembly.  My sense is that it's not considered...
@JGPretlow Could still be "horsetraded" for, or suddenly jump to the floor (but only if they KNOW it has the votes to pass), I'm just not expecting it
@JGPretlow Got nothing from Pretlow's office to lead me to this conclusion - it's just based on my observations of how Albany works (and doesn't)
@JGPretlow and that there are other priorities for lawmakers more pressing than iPoker,,, my personal opinion is - I would be surprised if it happens.
@JGPretlow Bills can go from zero to unanimous votes in the blink of an eye - and often do.  But, since there's still opposition in the Assemb...
@JGPretlow Backers in Assembly are still hoping this can get done by the wire, but time is running out.  Normally, timing is hard to predict in Assemb.
@JGPretlow the other factor is time.  Albany adjourns on 6/21, and there are just 5 working days left in the session (including today)
@JGPretlow ...so the members who represent districts with Native casinos are less likely to vote yes on any measure on iPoker...
@JGPretlow Keep in mind, Native casinos oppose iPoker (they are not tied to online setup like other casinos would be, and NJ casinos are)...
@JGPretlow that means Assembly and Senate versions would have to be reconciled, or Senate would have to ok Assemb version.  Former cld take a while...
@JGPretlow move to *floor* quickly...
@JGPretlow If Assembly passes iPoker (could move to floow QUICKLY w/enough support), bill would be different than Senate bill...
@JGPretlow Pretlow has also indicated he's worried about defeating cheats - making sure multiple players cannot "game" action on a table...
@JGPretlow (though I was not told what sort of consumer protections were being sought, likely on age, location restrictions &amp; addiction protections...)
@JGPretlow Told there is some pushback in Assembly, so they are seeking amendments to likely enhance "consumer protections" on iPoker bill.
@JGPretlow Feeling is, Senate passage today will have little impact (Senate has passed it before) on Assembly.
@JGPretlow (Pretlow is chair of the Assemb. Committee on wagering, and had been blocking advance of ipoker in NY before reversing positions this year)
On iPoker/#poker in NY:		Spoke with a leg. analyst in @JGPretlow's office... Gary Pretlow is the key player in the Assembly on poker...
@OPReport Damn... serves me right for teasing it so early...
Perhaps 5 minute question periods for Senators on such serious topics/questions is too little.They're rushing q's - and Sessions rushing too

Again, Owen - is making sure there's zero chance for harm w/any legal vice our standard?  If so, tobacco, booze, food, cars shld be banned. https://t.co/j7HEaFuWw9
@firehorse1200 @DustinGouker @SteveRuddock But, if we want to deny responsible people access to an activity b/c some are not responsible/ill, that's a very slippery slope.
Concerns are fair. But a NY gambler today can go upstate, to a Racino, to AC, Poconos, CT, DE, or illegal casino and face same risks. https://t.co/IhfTSZ8AdY
@firehorse1200 @DustinGouker @SteveRuddock Is "zero ability for abuse or harm" the standard we're seeking?  If so, time to prohibit booze, tobacco, driving over 65, high-cal meals...
All totally solid points. https://t.co/6MxYOX5Wx5
@OPReport So, Empire City or RW with racing, video games and live poker rooms?  That's now a legit alternative to a casino 2 hours away. /end
@OPReport And since ANY iPoker law would redefine poker as "game of skill," physical cardrooms would instantly become feasible.
@OPReport Will prob cost Yonkers (Empire City) and Aqueduct (Resorts World) some market share/revenue.  They want to offset that.
@OPReport I think only one new casino is open upstate (could be wrong). Catskills still a ways from opening - closest to NYC.

@OPReport And ALL those other entities (casinos, racinos, iPoker sites) have lobbying $ to spend, too.  Natives (&amp; Amaya) only ones outside looking in
@OPReport Fair concern.  But there are so many entities seeking a slice of this pie, can't imagine Amaya has enough juice to stop them all...
@OPReport My analogy:  You don't want to find out your daughter's new BF has a prison record. If you swap leg for dad, and PStars for BF, safety 1st.
@OPReport But my gut says "bad actor" makes bill MORE sellable - removes argument against major player, and could be seen as "consumer protection"
@OPReport State GOP loves to hammer Cuomo &amp; friends whenever possible, so I could see this as a penalty against Amaya...
@OPReport I've not heard who pushed the "bad actor" amendment into the bill, but the connection between Amaya and Cuomo is not an unreasonable theory.

How long until we get the telephone logs from the White House re: Did Comey call Trump (as Trump claimed, and Comey denied)??
On "why would #Comey take calls from DT after he said he didn't want to be alone with him" - do people refuse calls from POTUS often?
Lordy, he really IS a maverick.
Where's McCain going on these HRC questions?
Which McCain will ask questions next?  The good Republican helping the WH, or the maverick McCain who can't be pegged down?
Cornyn is giving the WH defense line - you thought Lynch was impeding Clinton invest.  So, why did you not do the same on Trump?
King Q's to Comey potentially damaging.  Attacks Trump's credibility - paints DT as a liar.   #ComeyDay bottom line: "who do you trust"
Where's Blunt going with these Comey questions?  If DJT did something wrong, why didn't you say or do anything about it?
How's #ComeyDay going for the White House?  Honestly,, I would give the President his phone back at this point.  He needs a defense.
Heinrich Q:  Why should we trust you?  Comey is self-deprecating - asks why Trump cleared Oval for their conversation.  Who do you trust?
Interesting approach from Heinrich:  Trump never talked to Comey about Russia influence in election.  LOTS of conversations with Obama
Risch Q to strikes at heart of Trump issues.  Did it matter if he SAID to "let this go" - or are his actions/how perceived that matters?
Comey's first take after meeting Trump:  He might lie, so I need to write this down.  WOW.
Burr appears to be targeting biggest ticket worries for Trump:  collusion, obstruction, the urinary dossier.  #ComeyDay
Comey:  nobody in admin asked me to drop Russia investigation - that's only a narrow bit of jeopardy avoided for the president
Supersmart of Comey to focus on Trump hurting FBI, not himself.  Co-anchoring coverage now on @FiOS1NewsLHV, @FiOS1NewsNJ &amp; @FiOS1News_LI

Are they, @firehorse1200?  Read the WaPo piece from last Saturday w Nashville trump supporters, and get back to me.
In short, GOP will cynically hurt/kill Americans for a politcal win on HC, @firehorse1200. Claim disaster &amp; pain coming, will not help stop
@firehorse1200 Yes, but:  watch Price at HHS tweak ACA regs to weaken it, so GOP can blame dems.
Who loses the most from the failure of the AHCA?  Residents of Palm Beach, FL.  I'm guessing Trump WILL head to Mar-a-Lago now.  #Sorry

After scanning my twitter feed, I felt compelled to post some quotes about American unity and patriotism. Remember, we are 1 people/1 nation
"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge... is itself a frightful despotism" -G. Washington
"My God!  How little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are in possession of, and which no other people on earth enjoy!"
"This country will not be a good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good place for all of us to live in."
"America is another name for opportunity.  Our whole history appears like a last effort of divine providence on behalf of the human race."
"Sometimes people call me an idealist.  Well, that is the way I know I am an American.  America is the only idealistic nation in the world."
"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!"
"...set out in principle to institutionalize freedom, responsible government, and human equality."
"America is much more than a geographical fact.  It is a political and moral fact - the first community in which men...
"The cement of this union is the heart-blood of every American."
"National honor is national property of the highest value."
"I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives.  I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him"
‚ÄúWhere liberty dwells, there is my country.‚Äù
