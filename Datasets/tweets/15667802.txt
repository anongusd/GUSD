So much is at risk. Extreme heat exacerbates air pollution, putting our health (kids &amp; seniors especially) on the line. Rising sea levels threaten infrastructure &amp; real estate. And impacts like these can cause instability abroad, affecting our national security.
This new report confirms that cutting carbon pollution will save thousands of lives and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in economic benefits.
Climate-related impacts‚Äîlike more dangerous hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires‚Äîhave already cost us billions of dollars and cost too many people their homes or their lives. Unchecked climate change will only cost us more.
You might have missed this, since the administration quietly released it the day after Thanksgiving. But a new government report confirms what we already know: Climate change is real, it‚Äôs manmade, and its devastating impacts are already here. https://t.co/rCZ1pXaDxq #NCA4

And in one of the best developments of this cycle, Florida voters restored the eligibility to vote to 1.4 million people who had served their time. Credit to @YesTo2ndChances for their work &amp; for setting an example for the few states who still have similarly outdated laws.
Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah also voted to expand #Medicaid, extending health care to 363K Americans! Maine elected a governor who will *finally* implement the Medicaid expansion that passed last year, and Kansas is primed to expand under a new governor, too: https://t.co/JsqQECutH1
We made some incredible progress to fight gerrymandering this year, too! Thanks to voters, organizers, and groups like @DemRedistrict, FOUR states‚ÄîColorado, Michigan, Missouri, and likely Utah‚Äîpassed initiatives to ensure #FairMaps and a more fair democracy moving forward.
We also elected a host of new governors who will oversee &amp; approve fair electoral maps, expand clean energy policies, improve our health care, and fight for state-wide economies that work for everyone. https://t.co/pj98tANIWY
With control of the House, we may finally see some oversight of the admin's worst decisions: undermining the Census, detaining &amp; separating migrant children from their parents, increasing pollution, and more. Overall: more transparency &amp; accountability of the Executive Branch.
What else to expect: no more #TaxScam bills. This new Congress will not slash #Medicare, #Medicaid, or #SocialSecurity to pay for the $1.9 trillion #GOPTaxScam that lined the pockets of billionaires and corporations.
This administration may still try to sabotage the law in any way they can, just as they have for the past two years. And the GOP led lawsuit to dismantle it is ongoing. So stay vigilant and stay organized. There‚Äôs still work to be done to #ProtectOurCare.
Obamacare repeal is dead. After dozens of votes and some very close calls, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions (+130 million people!) are done for now. https://t.co/aquiqEu99F

Hands-down one of the most useful tools you can use to get ready to #VOTE: https://t.co/W2tZ0XYiEJ		-See your sample ballot	-Compare candidates 	-Make informed picks at the ballot box	-Print your sample ballot or have it emailed to you		(big h/t to our friends at @ballotready!)
Climate change is already here, but we need aggressive measures to keep it from getting any worse. Start at the ballot box. We can still‚Äîand we must‚Äî#ActOnClimate. (8/8)
So here's what you can do right now:	-Register to vote at https://t.co/daxWPxyeFh.	-Know where your elected officials stand on climate change.	-#VOTE on November 6. Elect a new Congress. (7/8)
But we cannot give up the fight to #ActOnClimate. Two degrees may be bad, but 3 or 4 degrees would be much, much worse. It's not too late for this to matter‚Äîin fact it's *extremely urgent* that we get to work immediately. (6/8)
And that's only a fraction of what they've done. By undermining the critical work of the EPA, siding with big polluters &amp; special interests over our public health, and flat-out denying the science of climate change, they are putting us all in danger. (5/8)
As a reminder, the Trump administration has proudly	-pulled out of the #ParisClimateAgreement	-attacked clean car, mercury, and methane standards	-replaced the #CleanPowerPlan with the #DirtyPowerScam, which would cost 1400 lives per year according to their *own* estimates! (4/8)
We won't lie. It's very scary. People should worried about this. More importantly, people should be taking action on this before the record-breaking weather events we're already seeing (hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, heatwaves) get any worse. (3/8)
Essentially, if we push the increase in global temperatures past 1.5 degrees Celsius, we're looking at tens of millions more people exposed to flooding, heat waves, water shortages and more by 2050. Here's what that looks like: https://t.co/wZg34ciO9k (2/8)

On top of this evergreen video series, we're also facilitating these trainings live online through the month of September. Join the trainings in English on Wednesday nights here: https://t.co/NABTYYUoZi and in Spanish on Thursday nights (tonight!) here: https://t.co/cxSJmdP93E. https://t.co/vplQVvNSTl
If you're interested in hosting a Campaign Organizing Bootcamp yourself, let us know, and we'll follow up with everything you need to make it a success: https://t.co/HZvrET3BRJ
You can watch and learn at your own pace, but since organizing isn't a solo sport, we encourage you to gather friends, family, and neighbors to join in and maximize your organizing power.
What skills will you learn? Good question. We'll cover 1) sharing your personal story, 2) holding persuasive conversations, 3) motivating your networks to get to the polls, 4) preparing staging locations, and 5) digital organizing. https://t.co/GJBpOT14Kl
It's our bedrock principle that passionate people can leverage their power to create the change they want to see‚Äîbut we know that that requires a plan. This series breaks down every piece of that strategy so that anyone can effectively advocate for what matters to them.
OFA's Campaign Organizing Bootcamp trainings are here. They're online, they're free of cost, and they're everything we need to effectively organize this year and beyond. See for yourself: https://t.co/fPqIr5kY7k #OFAction https://t.co/9T56qyFIRa

When the repeal of the Affordable Care Act was all but inevitable, this massive groundswell of grassroots activism from everyday Americans is what ultimately saved the day.
OFA supporters alone contributed:	-Over a million petition signatures to stop repeal	-Tens of thousands of calls to Congress through our call tool	-Massive turnout at on-the-ground rallies
You spoke up. Millions of Americans took action by calling their elected officials, writing letters, talking to their neighbors, sharing their health care stories, rallying, and advocating for the law.

Health issues don't exist on a political spectrum. Pre-existing conditions don't care if you're left, right, or center. Nobody wins when health care for 130 million Americans is under attack. Read this thread to learn what's at stake: https://t.co/4Gx3vqObr1
Call Congress now and tell them to put an end to this cruelty: 202-224-3121
Leaders framing this as a "compromise" are lying. This is a cynical attempt to use children as political leverage for a border wall and other anti-immigrant policies. This has already gone far past what is decent and humane.
The Republican "compromise" bill would not end family separation, but it would allow for children to be treated like adults, extending their stays in detention: https://t.co/3IhE4Zjdnd

Speak up now so that the House doesn‚Äôt pass these harmful bills. Demand they work to protect #DREAMers as well as children and families. Call a key representative now: https://t.co/73oPs9qX3L
It's against our American values to remove protections for these 800,000 young people, and it's contrary to common sense. We need to stand up and protect them while also fighting for policies that actually protect children‚Äînot ones that destroy lives and divide families.
Republicans failed to bring bipartisan bills to a vote, and the bills under consideration now won't #ProtectDREAMers. But they do cater to the White House's anti-immigrant demands, enabling the administration to continue cruel treatment of children &amp; families at the border.
But on today's anniversary, their futures remain in limbo. Their status was jeopardized when the Trump administration needlessly ended the program last year. Since then, the Republican-controlled Congress has failed to pass legislation to permanently protect them.
These young people are American in every way but on paper, and this country is the only home they have ever known. They are our neighbors, classmates, friends, and colleagues. #DACA allows them to live, work, and go to school without fear of deportation.
6 years ago today, President Obama unveiled the #DACA program to protect young immigrants who were brought to the US as kids. 800,000 #DREAMers have since stepped out of the shadows because of #DACA. They strengthen our communities &amp; help us write our exceptional American story.

Team ‚Äô18 will bring together a nationwide network of experienced organizers, top-notch trainers, and passionate volunteers to give everyday Americans the tools they need to make the difference this year: trainings, support, leadership development, resources, and more.
We need dedicated people across the country to join us‚Äîand that's where Team ‚Äô18 comes in: https://t.co/o0T5fTFDW6
Finally, we'll take on statewide ballot initiatives where we can make an immediate impact‚Äîlike expanding voting rights, fighting for clean energy, expanding health care access, and more: https://t.co/z99qpIHC5U
We'll also fight gerrymandering in states where we have a clear chance to make sure maps will be drawn fairly. Many of the lawmakers drawing maps in 2020 will be elected this year, and equal representation is crucial to building a more #FairDemocracy: https://t.co/OWCJHNxD8N
First, we have to elect better representatives. We'll hold reps accountable at the ballot box for advancing this admin's most harmful policies &amp; we'll elect leaders who will fight for our values. See if you live in one of the key districts we're targeting: https://t.co/gnAvmpkQbN
Every day between now and Election Day 2018, we'll take strategic action across the country in three key areas:
Since Jan. 2017, our country has endured:	-a $1.9 trillion #TaxScam	-sabotage of our health care	-failure to act on gun violence	-inaction to protect #DACA youth		The stakes couldn't be higher in 2018. So today we're launching #OrganizingFor18: https://t.co/N0X88vUIoh.

This administration and their allies in Congress are hell-bent on taking health care away from women, children, and low-income Americans. We need to speak up in November.
Title X is a lifeline for over 4 million low-income women who need it for things like birth control, cancer screenings, HIV testing, and preventive care. Restricting access to that care is cruel, plain and simple. #NoGagRule #ReproRights

This country is enriched by immigrants, and we've always found strength in our diversity. But this administration constantly betrays these shared values that make our country great. 2/4

CALL YOUR REPS through the Capitol switchboard: 202-224-3121. We have to speak up if we want to reject the FCC's repeal. #SaveTheInternet and save #NetNeutrality. 9/9
Today, we saw senators (at least a slight majority of them) do their job by listening to the American people rather than special interests. Now let's put the pressure on the House and #SaveTheInternet. 8/9
But this Senate vote isn't the end. The measure needs to pass in the House. It's now on @SpeakerRyan to bring it up for a vote, and on our representatives to follow through and save #NetNeutrality from the FCC's reckless and deeply unpopular move to repeal. 7/9
The average internet consumer shouldn't have to worry about blocked websites, slowed-down content, increased pricing from providers, or "fast lanes" that only benefit those who can afford to pay more for service. 6/9
#NetNeutrality ensures small business owners can operate on the same digital playing field as big corporations. Students trying to finish school online can't be charged more than their peers who are able to attend class. 5/9
3) Millions of Americans rely on a free and open internet, and today we're that much closer to saving the #NetNeutrality rules that have protected that equal access. 4/9
2) It's a sharp rebuke of this administration and their catering to what big corporations want over the clear preferences of American consumers. 3/9
This is a huge achievement for a few reasons. 1) Even though more than 80% of Americans support #NetNeutrality, it took the entire minority party and at least one Republican to force and win the Senate vote‚Äînot an easy thing to accomplish. 2/9

This is the legacy @SpeakerRyan leaves behind. Stepping down was the right decision.
.@SpeakerRyan announced his own retirement just days after the @USCBO published a report that shows the deficit exploding, providing cover to his plan to strip away benefits like #Medicare and Social Security from retired Americans.
.@SpeakerRyan, the soon-to-be-former party leader, presided over a chamber that relentlessly tried to rip health care away from millions of Americans. Thanks to organizers and concerned citizens who spoke out, his attempts failed.
.@SpeakerRyan and his soon-to-be-former conservative colleagues failed to act meaningfully to help #EndGunViolence and #ProtectDREAMers, despite countless calls for congressional action.
.@SpeakerRyan and his soon-to-be-former conservative colleagues passed a $1.5 trillion #TaxScam on the back of the middle and working classes.
"...only 4.3% of workers will receive a one-time bonus or wage increase tied to the business tax cuts, while businesses received 9 times more in cuts than what they passed on to their workers..."		More on outgoing @SpeakerRyan's #TaxScam: https://t.co/1tp1IX7Xsw cc: @4taxfairness

Leaders in Congress continue to offer their #ThoughtsAndPrayers. But these words, without any meaningful action, ring hollow. We have suffered under this epidemic of violence for too long.
In the last 5 months, we've seen 3 of the 8 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history. Far too many lives have been touched by gun violence. This issue is personal to so many. To those families who've been affected‚Äîwe hear you, we love you, and we stand with you.
17 innocent Americans were killed in Parkland, FL yesterday. More were injured. Even more will now have to carry the weight of this tragedy for the rest of their lives.
For millions of Americans, the programs this administration wants to slash (#Medicaid #SNAP #CHIP #TANF) offered a hand to help when they needed it most. Because that's who we are as Americans‚Äîthis is what we value. More from @amprog: https://t.co/mm6EgUHxko #HandsOff

Mitch promised to bring a vote to the floor, but it still hasn't happened. It seems he needs a reminder, and Paul Ryan needs to know we're looking at him to make the same promise. 		Call Congress now at https://t.co/zO2VwlP1G6 and demand they keep their word. #DreamActNow https://t.co/plKRbiRVmA
We just have to keep pushing for it from the grassroots up.		Get off the sidelines. Take action today in whatever way you can.
And #WeDeserveBetter leadership from an administration and Congress that recklessly create a false choice between protecting #DACA recipients and funding the government in order to cater to their most extreme base.
#WeDeserveBetter than leaders who call immigrants "lazy" or insinuate that they're terrorists or members of violent gangs or from "sh*thole" countries.

We need to fund #CHIP. We need to protect #DREAMers. And we need to reopen and fund the government. 11/11 https://t.co/wMzhg5f2fR
But Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan decided it‚Äôs better to shut down our government because they have never been serious about keeping their promises to #DACA recipients. We shouldn't believe their hollow promises now, either. 10/11
There were bipartisan solutions on the table that would have funded the government, protected #DREAMers, and funded healthcare for children. 9/11
The truth is we don‚Äôt have to choose. We can protect immigrant children and sick children in America. 8/11 https://t.co/WDwBl7znZC
Now we know why. It was all so they could hold #CHIP recipients hostage in an attempt to give a false choice: that we could EITHER protect children's health OR #DACA recipients. 7/11 https://t.co/RROALNkEjz
Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan let the Children Health Insurance Program expire in September and refused to bring it up for a vote on a permanent solution for more than 100 days‚Äîdespite overwhelming bipartisan support, and despite negligible costs. 6/11
At the same time they broke their promises on #DACA, they broke another one to 9 million kids who depend on #CHIP for their health care. 5/11
Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan both agreed that they'd find a solution for #DACA recipients. They didn't. (See https://t.co/MIGmS2o5P0 and https://t.co/eDTOZvvVCz) 4/11
First, the White House ended #DACA in 2017, throwing the futures of hundreds of thousands young people‚Äîwho have only ever known this country as home‚Äîinto limbo. 3/11
Things are changing quickly in Washington, but we want to take a minute to talk about Mitch McConnell's manufactured crisis. 2/11

@SenateMajLdr @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake Now @SenateMajLdr is trying to rewrite key portions of this #TaxScam bill mere hours before tomorrow's planned vote.

@SenateMajLdr @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake They would have had to accomplish that through tax hikes or spending cuts; we don't know exactly how it would have looked, since so few people saw the bill in the first place. (We're all still waiting!) 5/
@SenateMajLdr @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake To get their votes, @SenateMajLdr McConnell agreed to a "trigger" provision for the bill: a clause that would stop deficit growth if certain benchmarks aren't met in the next five years. 4/
@SenateMajLdr This matters because some holdout senators (cc: @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake) have been vocal with their concerns about adding so much to the deficit. 3/
@SenateMajLdr Even in the most favorable analysis, this #TaxScam bill would still add $1 trillion to the deficit‚Äîand that's only if (a big "if") tax cuts end up creating growth. 2/ https://t.co/ZUGRIJCaT5

This is what a bad, backroom legislative process leads to: an equally bad bill.
If you get a tax credit because you're retired on disability or because you have adopted children, those vanish under this bill.
If you're looking to buy a house, a new cap would be placed on how much mortgage interest you'd be able to deduct.
If you claim certain deductions on your taxes because of medical expenses or student loans, this plan takes away your right to claim them.
This bill will add $1.5 trillion to our deficit, setting the stage for cuts to #Medicaid, #Medicare, SNAP, CHIP, and other crucial programs.
These are massive tax cuts for corporations‚Äîto pay for them, the money has to come from somewhere.
Now we know why Congress has been afraid to show us what's in the bill. #NotOnePenny https://t.co/0JvtUPrGn8
