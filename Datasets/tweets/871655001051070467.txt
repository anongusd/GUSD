@benpearceptx My initial point was that both the Dems and the Reps fall into the trap of thinking that people get off work voluntarily, and I thought the similarity was funny. I thought when you said "interpretation of an article" that you were referring to the healthcare crisis, not the gvmt
@benpearceptx I'm not arguing that the American healthcare system is good. I'm arguing that your solutions have downsides that you aren't considering, and that there are cheaper options where we can still cover the poor, the elderly, and affordability if the GOP could actually govern for once.
@benpearceptx For whatever reason, I can't access the report itself on the CBO website (Broken link?). But here's a Washington Post article written on the same day that agrees with me: https://t.co/CINhd2zygO https://t.co/NopofGsbWh
@benpearceptx The point here is that the ACA, with it's benefits mandate for full-time workers, created incentives for employers to cut hours, and the interpretation that the workers wanted to work less is wrong. This Advisor is making the same mistake.
@Roberto_M_Pena @NiskanenCenter Just for comparison, Lasik isn't covered by insurance and has been going down every year because doctors compete to get customers. Meanwhile, hospitals pay 800 dollars for a 50 cent bag of saline solution because customers don't care about the costs, insurance will cover it.
@Roberto_M_Pena The argument goes that third-party insurance inflates healthcare costs, because you aren't responsible for your cost. Moving to direct cash payments (With a universal catastrophic plan advocated by @NiskanenCenter) like they do in Singapore would cost costs dramatically.
https://t.co/TV8aVMXxeS		Reason #18238 why California Democrats are better than New York Democrats. https://t.co/Uv5bv3RzUF
@Roberto_M_Pena https://t.co/TPkrt2irWh by the Cato Institute is a great explanation of all the ways that monopolies have been formed, and some ways to fix them. https://t.co/pcft8cCCS0		Here's another solution by the same authors. 		Ignore the conservatives: Our healthcare is trash, not great.
@Roberto_M_Pena It's business-friendly, not market friendly. When's the last time you actually went and shopped around for a doctor or a surgery? The problem with healthcare is transparency: no one knows what they're paying because each insurer has different deals. It's a series of monopolies.
@benpearceptx @mattdpearce https://t.co/HhVG39eGcD
@Roberto_M_Pena The usual libertarian argument for that graph is that all the heavily government managed industries have only been getting worse, while all the market-friendly industries have only been getting better and better.

@benpearceptx @DataProgress I mean, I‚Äôm sure I could find some right-leaning propaganda polls to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that whatever latest think tank policy can be popular too. Most polling is garbage, though, and can easily be changed by slightly changing the wording. Plus the RINOs aren‚Äôt most voters.
@benpearceptx All a post Trump GOP has to do is say that the future of the Democrats is Bernie Sanders and Ocasio Cortez rather than Bloomberg and Bill Clinton style triangulation and these voters will come straight back.
@benpearceptx If you‚Äôre a Romney to Clinton voter, I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre swapping just because of trump, not because you want to double your taxes to pay for single payer, a jobs guarantee, a universal basic income, a green new deal... they‚Äôre still fiscal conservatives.
RINOs can‚Äôt vote for the Dems forever so long as they keep pushing leftwards. A post-Trump GOP needs to take these voters back. https://t.co/uZKavqehg9

@NeoliberalFed @Noahpinion Then maybe it's a bad example. What about West Virginia? Is it fair to include poor states in the US and then ignore the poor states like Romania in the EU and say that one system is significantly better?
@Noahpinion Does this include Britain, which is like the US and less equal than some other nations? Does it include nations like Spain and Italy, which are just not important on the world stage and have anemic economies? Is it fair to compare the US with Alabama to only the rich parts of EU?

@tuppington Just one question. What's your example of a country that hasn't oppressed anyone?
@tuppington Bah American expansion is nowhere near as bad as French or British colonialism. It's saved Asia, although the Middle East is fked.
@tuppington Clearly there are still many flaws in America. But it's certainly one of the better countries in terms of oppression.
@tuppington That's a clear violation of rights. I accept that. However, is it large scale suppression like the European colonialists or the CCP?
@iyad_elbaghdadi Where do you live now? Does it feel like home or just a temporary resting place?
@troutyreplica @curaffairs Also, can you name any countries with less oppression?
