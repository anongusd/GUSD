@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams BDS is not a non-violent movement and its goal is the destruction of the State of Israel. Jews involved in this anti-Semitic movement are suicidal, ignorant, or stupid.
@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams Wrong. All Israelis and most Jews criticize Israel because we love it.
@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams BDS is inherently anti-Semitic.

@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams Trump clearly is not a good person.
@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams Criticism of Israeli policy is just fine. BDS is anti-Semitism.
@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams Heck no. I voted for HRC AND detest Donald Trump. Moving the embassy and leaving the Iran deal are some of the very few things he has done right.
@Matthew_Lief @AdyBarkan @Lin_Manuel @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams It is neither brutal nor overly militaristic.

@simplylorilee @thebradfordfile @KurtSchlichter This is supposed to be news to me?
@DA1WOLFPACKJACK @thebradfordfile @KurtSchlichter I have a Jewish soul, thank God!
@simplylorilee @thebradfordfile @KurtSchlichter Jesus did not exist at that time, if he ever did.
@RealPaulWinters @KurtSchlichter @townhallcom Liberal and proud of it!
@thebradfordfile @KurtSchlichter Kids, the Bible doesn’t say that a fetus is fully human or abortion is murder. See Exodus 21:22
@AndyMcDonaldMP You are ignorant and probably an anti-Semitic bigot. Please go educate yourself.

@NuclearAnthro I detest intersectionality as it is used to promote anti-Semitism.
@DirkSchwenk I think you meant heterosexual white Christian men.
@NuclearAnthro Even more fun if you are also Jewish.
