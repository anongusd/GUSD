People of Michigan deserve better than gimmicks and games from their elected officials. Serious times call for real leaders.
Today's vote is a classic example of ideology trumping common sense. If adopted nationally, will be catastrophically bad.
As bad as things were in Michigan during the Great Recession, a balanced budget amendment would have made things far, far worse.
Today's partisan vote on a reckless change to the Constitution highlights all that's wrong with the Michigan Senate.
