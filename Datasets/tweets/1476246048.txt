‚Äú@UberFacts: Today is National Apple Dumpling Day!‚Äù You mean it's not during Atwood's Apple Dumpling Festival? Hmmm curious.
I've been working on this bio homework for three hours.
I use my plus one on coffee everyday #Blessed
I've been waiting in line for coffee long enough to read to DM three times.
It's Election Day! Go vote on your myOlemiss account for your campus senator! #DeanForSenate
I'd first like to just say no, secondly ouch, and thirdly, screw 8:00 am class.
My apologies. He is FaceTiming his girlfriend. #FOff
I could strangle the guy that is talking on the phone in the no talking section of the library.
If you think biology with Mrs H is hard I ask you come sit in just one lecture with Doctor Bensen. #SoLost
What I have I don't this past hour? Watch political debates. Why? Because it makes me feel better about myself.
There's just. What. I can't. No. Please stop.
Oh my gosh.
My stats class is just ratchet. There's no other word to describe it.
‚Äú@UberFacts: By the time most Americans are 18, they have eaten about 1,500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.‚Äù Not a damn one.
I love this school.
THE CLEANING LADIES ARE COMING TOMORROW, PRAISE THE LAWD! It reeks of pizza and whiskey on our floor.
I met a guy last night that told me he was strung out on adderall, is a diabetic, and hadn't eaten anything all day. #GetOffTheKoolAid
Lmao. I apologize for my insta videos.
Why did I loft my bed? It's such a challenge to get up on especially on nights like last night. Where's my chicken on a stick?
Last night was insane.
RT @SEC_Logo: NEW AP Poll Top 25: #SEC	1. Alabama	6. LSU	9. Georgia	10. Texas A&amp;M	12. South Carolina	19. Florida	21. Ole Miss
RT @OMRebelNation: It's been 24 years since Ole Miss started a season 3-0. Chew on that.
#FinsUpHornsDown
Get out of here UPD!
Just one more class. One more.
Forgot to charge my computer and left my ID in my room. #Helpless
The struggle is real today.
I've been called Yankee more than my own name. #Lolz
My Starbucks is out of fraps. What is life?
Are you kidding me?
I need to get up and start studying but I'm so tired.
I need a nap. Just need to get through these next two hours.
@LoganDukeman I kept mine in my office at home.
I will always think of the amazing Karen Dawson and her son on this day #IASC #WeRemember #GodBlessAmerica
I have to drink coffee to stay awake but then I just get hot and feel like I need to go cool down. Once I go cool down I get sleep. Meh.
@ripplejane I saw this and thought of you. http://t.co/IfJvefus11
Jarrod wants to have all 4 of us live in the same room and just use the other room as a party/activities room. #College
This rain can eat me.
I miss Coach Steele. I miss his jokes. I miss his attitude. I miss his advice. I really do consider him a father figure. Damn.
I feel like I could recite the M Book to people as much as I've gone over it for this class.
I shouldn't have drank that coke. Now I'm not going to fall asleep.
I couldn't imagine living with a greater group of guys.

Life is all about who you know.
There are those points in my class when I know I don't care what is being said because when I read what I wrote I can't even read it.
I hate TAs.
Today I learned what mean, median and mode are in math. I've taken freaking calculus. It's so hard to just not fall asleep in STATS.
I have no clue what I'm going to do in my math lab considering I have 10 assignments done already...
