@mikesonn Gentle reminder to us all that *other people in cars* are putting your son's life in danger. You are not. You are creating opportunities for him to experience and enjoy the place we live! If it were only people on bikes the "danger" would feel very different.
@thressaisobel If I were truly prepared I would have taken a selfie during early voting
@thressaisobel I voted early, no selfies from me

Folks are rallying today to tell @microsoft: #NoTechForICE
In addition to all the data and research and expertise, the presenter just had to deal with a white woman jumping in with unasked advice and policing her emotions and tone. #NPFund18
When we are surrounded by these narratives, we buy into them. It creates bias. White = power, white = money, white = success. We have to disrupt the narrative in fundraising. #NPFund18
Let's not just talk about disadvantage. If someone experiences disadvantage, that means someone else is experiencing advantage. "But I'm giving money to fix the problem" is not an excuse. You shouldn't have the money to give away in the first place. #NPFund18
If we keep talking about the problems as though they're individual problems and require individual solutions, we'll never get anywhere. As long as white people are in charge and making all the decisions, we're stuck. Challenge the systems. #NPFund18
White led organizations get almost all the dollars and almost all the grants. 96%. KEY QUESTION: "Where did these white people get their money?" Slave labor, stealing indigenous lands. #NPFund18
The gaps we say we're addressing with job training, school, home ownership, financial skills -- none actually engage the causes of inequity. We're just wiping blood from the wound. Overwhelming $ goes to "helping individuals," with only 2% of money to structural change.
"Diversity" misses the point. As though we're not operating out of a racialized history that has specially structured our systems to keep some voices quiet and make other voices loud.
"Majority" reinforces an artificially produced narrative that white is the norm and everything else is other. The language we use matters.
White supremacy defines who belongs, who owns, who is civilized. https://t.co/xJ1Q9v2w73
Amazing session on unpacking "diversity" as an effort and a word and a topic. Dense AF but full of opportunity to reflect and learn. #NPFund18
@crumr018 @ianacook Introvert life is the best life
"So people tell me you're loaded." Art reflects life with @T2_P2 at #NPFund18
@crumr018? @ianacook?
Any @ynpntc folks want to grab a lunch table at #NPFund18?
Hey @SmartNonprofits I have some accessibility feedback for you! Is there a good way to share it? #NPFund18
@SmartNonprofits I'm down to discuss how this discussion could look for the future if it's of interest!
And if you look at this profession and see a massive white savior complex, and capitalist values that encourage us to monetize our relationships, and subsistence based on power dynamics where funders have all the control .... Would you stay? #NPFund18
So we've been working on diversity as a profession for decades and it hasn't gotten much better. Yes, it's a problem because of our behavior, but can we also recognize how this profession requires complicity and upholds problematic systems? #NPFund18
How come there are no sessions at #NPFund18 encouraging us to explore the big picture problems of the money that sustains our sector? I want to be talking about how we disrupt the status quo, not feed into the funders and mindsets that pit us against each other.

There are only white men in the delegate line. So far, all of them are interrupting the (admittedly extremely flawed) process of credentialing to give ideas of how they would handle it. #mplsdfl #mansplaining https://t.co/O2b6DVqccz
The phrase "temporary existing proposed rules" shouldn't be a thing. #mplsdfl #whatdoesthatevenmean

@mrbmpls @scttdvd Oh that's my bus too, I totally agree. Construction won't even begin until 2021 😭
@scttdvd @mrbmpls The B line when it is built will replace the 53. (And it should have a dedicated lane. On Lake Street.)

Finished work, and got the pleasant news that I don't have to empty the furniture out of my apartment! Time for Lost and banana KitKats.

I am starting to loathe my job.
@OrganizeFISH @creepyed I do remember that, and that interview is a waste of freaking time. Blargh.
@OrganizeFISH Yay! Glad to hear some good news in that department.
@troyler Wow, that's some way-ahead writing. I'm continually impressed.
@courtney_5887 I am so glad you watch BOT.
@troyler That would be wicked, although Locke's faith is central to his likability. Rewatching the whole series once it's over will be epic.
@courtney_5887 @troyler I'd have to disagree as well. 2 a.m. + is awesome, and TED IS A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING it's not the morning's fault.
@troyler No, it's all the instances of "what" in dialogue in Lost. Or at least a great many of them.
@shoof just tweeting it: http://www.hulu.com/watch/72446/saturday-night-live-immigrant-tale

Watching "Anchors Aweigh." I'll only get through half of it before culture festival choir practice, unfortunately.
@sthede The standard workweek is 40 hours, unless you're a teacher. Teachers here (except ALTs, like me) usually put in 12 hours a day.

Watching "Guys and Dolls." I love Sinatra, and it's my favorite Brando role.
My apartment is trashed right now. @creepyed Would be proud.
@shooof I'm pretty sure they didn't spell songs like that in the 60s or 70s. FYI.
FYI, @USA_Network 's White Collar is AWESOME. Watchers of #Chuck will be pleased to see Bryce Larkin in a permanent role.

I think my twitter got hacked.
Watching "Swingers." Man are they embarrassing themselves.
Watching "Goodfellas." Sunday mob movie.
Watching "Citizen Kane." Don't know what I expected of the movie, but this isn't it. Still good, though.
@shooof Okay. Either now or in like 10 hours would be good for Skype. Since I am up.
Watching "The Odd Couple," a surprisingly charming movie. And it has that guy from "Hello, Dolly" in it.

#lassiteriscoming oh man
@amyloveswelding Seconded. There is none in Japan.
@sthede Probably another year, to pay off my loans. Also, the economy is crap so it seems there won't be jobs to come home to next year.
Awesome from Chuck is in Fringe! Now he's drugged up and about to have bad stuff happen, though.
@sthede But that's, you know, after I pay off loans and decide what to get a degree in and go back to school.
@sthede Lol. Dave wants to be a professor for sure, so even if I don't work there, he might.
@sthede No, I'm saying you all seem swamped every second of your life and it seems like no fun at all. Especially since I want a family.
@sthede Every time I consider getting a master's or PhD, I look at DPU professors and think, "Fuck no."
@troyler I didn't know Dominic Monaghan was going to be in Flash Forward! Even more psyched for that show now.
@amyloveswelding I so want to read that book too, but I have no way to get it in Japan! FML.

FINALLY watching "Star Trek" oh man is this exciting and I'm only at the paramount symbol
I am loving Nathan Fillion's jacket this episode. Also his "sad daddy" face. #Castle
"straightjacket" oh #Castle
Watching "The Usual Suspects." Kevin Spacey has a type as far as his roles go, and I like it.
Finishing up watching "12 Angry Men." Old classic movies are the best.
@shooof and i took that radio iPod thing with me to Japan to use in my car here COMMUTING BABY
@shooof CONGRATULATIONS don't run over starlet

@sthede Yeah, it's the new Bruce Willis movie. It's all sorts of sci-fi/robotics/campy.

@amyloveswelding i hear that too STAY AWAY FROM MY SISTER love you BUT SERIOUSLY WATCH YOURSELF
@harvestfire Should I e-mail you?
@harvestfire I looked for ones with a writing major, since I knew my major, and I didn't look at anything really bigger than 10K students.
@creepyed That is freaking adorable! And small enough that I could maybe hand-stitch it here, since I don't have a sewing machine. &lt;3 you.
@harvestfire I visited Syracuse and disliked it. I didn't get to visit Bard on the premise that mom and dad wouldn't pay for me to go. SUCK.
@creepyed I am writing you a letter too! (It's taking me forever, I'm sorry.)
finished work at 1:30 WHAT UP i wasn't really asking, no ALSO i like the new twitter fonts
@balamoot I am so tired right now it's not even funny. 2 hours with the kinders is more tiring than a whole day with regular kids.
about to go teach daycare on a not-good night's sleep WATCH OUT FURNITURE HERE I COME CRASHING INTO YOUR VARIOUS CORNERS HAHA ow
I am looking for suggestions of TV shows to watch, if anyone has any.
@harvestfire I am going to watch 9 later and it'll be AWESOME right right?

@harvestfire He also has high blood pressure, which counteracts mom's low blood pressure and gives us really good blood pressure. FYI.
I HAVE INTERNET. MUCH REJOICING.
@sthede I'll be sending an e-mail later today (my apartment is getting internet). But I do also have an active blog: schufman.wordpress.com
@sthede I am getting up at 6 a.m., so it seems reasonable to me. (My life is backwards.)
@sthede 9:48 p.m. I shall be going to sleep shortly.
@sthede Weird, isn't it? It was monumental rain here. Required that I buy galoshes.
RAIN
@balamoot YES KIND OF dave has internet at his apartment so when i'm there i do WINNER RIGHT also i get my own internet saturday

I wonder if I can get Twitter to my Japanese phone. Although I suspect it'll be hella expensive.
Time to do my first proper lesson plan as an ALT.
@harvestfire Jet Force Gemini YO WHAT UP I'M AWESOME AT REMEMBERING
@harvestfire DON'T CRASH plz
Cleaned out my account using Twitter Twerp. Super useful.
@Milyusha I knew about the spacebar ... but I feel like the N and P keys are vital parts to my existence and I should have known before!
Just discovered that if you hit the n-key while using Google Reader it goes to the next news item. AWESOME.
@sthede I don't think they have one. As far as I can tell Japan doesn't do a lot of RPGs. Just insane amounts of anime.
@sthede Although I didn't leave until Sunday, there was no way I could spend the three days before at GenCon. It was bummertastic.
1) INTERNET. 2) I'm in Japan. 3) @jooleesther rock the namibia. 4) extreme humidididity. 5) I shoulda studied more Japanese. 6) KANJI.
Really excited to watch #Psych tomorrow. Yay for the internet! Boo for not having cable.

Read @scalzi's Old Man's War, The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony in half a week. Good, but my pace made the inside jokes all too recent.

@aturco Exactly how I felt. I went to a block party instead.
Never made it to Lolla. They refused me entry because of my camera. And the restriction was NOT posted online, either. FUCK. YOU. LOLLA.
Heading to Lollapalooza. Bringing some juggling stuff. Hope I don't get sunburned.

Public transportation in Chicago and its suburbs is needlessly complex.

First stop on my way to Chicago. Ughhhh driving.
Going to Chicago! Today through Friday, visiting with family. Saturday, Lollapalooza!
Ordered contacts, called the Japanese consulate, made a haircut appt, returned library books, did paperwork. Next: more ppwk and disc golf.

No juggling ... sad.
Kooza is THE BEST. And they haven't even started juggling yet. If phones didn't have to be off, I would livetweet it for @troyler.
Groth's party = win.
Got a letter from @creepyed (YAY) which I will read at work because right now I am on the verge of being late.
Burn Notice ran no problem on the Hulu player, but Royal Pains is just not loading. Grrr.
@philipjreed Thanks for the info. I leave the country August 16, and it's nice to know I might be able to get one of them before I leave.
Even though I missed it tonight, I am excited to watch Burn Notice tomorrow! And Royal Pains, I guess. :)
cold symptoms + seasonal allergies = sinus infection
@SJGames Any updates on the release dates for Revolution and The Stars Are Right? I am dying to purchase them ever since Randy demoed them.
Watching the Christmas episode from s.3 of #Psych. Whaaaaaaat making out whaaaat?
All the @Psych_USA tweets make me soooo jealous I am not there. *I* want my name featured on an episode of Psych. DIP AND FREAKING CHIPS.
Watching "Hot Fuzz." This movie is win every time.
I am sick. Going to bed. @amyloveswelding I may have to raincheck tomorrow if I don't feel better. Will call you when I'm up. Love.
"Dude, he's running! International sign of guilt!" #Psych
WIN: RT @Psych_USA http://twitpic.com/b3pcx - Psych Season 3 DVD is now available! We recommend it with a side of pineapple.
I am watching Psych instead of getting ready for work. And either I'm getting sick, or the wings I ate last night hurt my throat. A lot.
I should be asleep but ... cleeeaning for showing tomorrow.
@harvestfire I can't GET NO ... i miss you.
Should be cleaning. Instead I will nap while bad television plays on my laptop.
Seester lunchtime.
Woke up just in time to hear @TheCurrent 's 9:30 coffee break. What a great day to start a Monday.
Just realized I don't have clean work clothes for tomorrow and it's too late to start laundry, as it will wake people. Ugh.
Locked-out-of-car party with @amyloveswelding and @harvestfire at Bloomington iHop. Not my car though. Poor Ryan Groth.
@creepyed OH YEAH winner.
@creepyed You are so sweet. I got a text from you earlier ... and I can't remember what it said. And I dunno where my phone is.
Bad actor chemistry = lol
@conorjames Bluebird. I like the skin options so far — and I found it reading that Mac blog you linked to once. Useful.
@harvestfire grooooosssss.
@mersiedotes I do.
Trying a new Twitter client. Not sure what to make of it. Why am I bothering with them again? Why am I not just using the internet?
Eating is so damn weird.
Just got done driving @balamoot and @amyloveswelding home from The Onion. A good night out. HAPPY BIRTHDAY WEEK EMILY!
@courtney_5887 I am lost without your current music tastes. I dunno ANYTHING that has come out/been populaur since graduation.
I have read 5 books in the last 4 days. I hope this means I will have finished 10 by the end of the week.
Our day at Six Flags is, mercifully, almost over. Pictures of facepaint to come later.
@sthede Somehow that makes me feel like the Kindle thing would be a wise move, given that you and @creepyed think Berque are so alike.
I think the only thing that could stop me loving my children is if they were dumb.
@sthede NO WAY. This news is monumental.
Discworld would be a fantastic RPG.
I wish I knew CMOT Dibbler.
@creepyed I want a slushie now. THANKS.
@creepyed Brilliant. P.S. Suggestions for a blog hoster?
@creepyed I just read your blog post from several days ago. Ohno/lol/wtf?
@balamoot Oh yah, fer sher.
@balamoot If I didn't have to get up early I'd join you.
Considering buying a Kindle, not because I want e-books but because I can't bring hard copies of books to Japan. Anyone have helpful info?
Safari 4 hates my mac, so I'm downloading Opera. I feel unsafe without a backup browser, in case the Firefox beta goes haywire too.
Anthony Gatto at #MOA. Most amazing juggler ever.

I adore Terry Pratchett.

I just realized that the reason this week has felt so long is because I've worked 7 consecutive days.
@harvestfire SO DID I OMG.
Ice cream. Want.
@mjwilco Small world. Perhaps I'll see you another week?
Watching an outdoor screening of Breakfast at Tiffany's. Well, "watching" might be stretching it.
I would buy a #socksbook of whatever @sockington put in it. Preferably cute pictures with funny captions. He's a smart cat. He knows.
@harvestfire You're lost. Even I know that one.
Can't believe #MichaelJackson is dead. Just confirmed on MPR.
@harvestfire Whyn't you eat it earlier?
@creepyed Preferably.
@creepyed I always laugh WITH you.
@creepyed So I have NO idea what you were saying in that voicemail you left me. Something about realizing something about the other day?

@sthede August sometime? I am hoping 3rd week ... so I can go to GenCon. :)
@amyloveswelding Only like 3 weeks until you are home! You'd better call me ASAP after you land. I miss you.
Just spent three hours playing games with Randy Sch...unspellable, of @SJGames . It was a blast. I will definitely be buying Revolution!
@sthede Thanks! and yes. She is okay — 15 stitches and a huge lump on her head, but she will be just fine.
@creepyed I hope you had a safe flight!
I lub my sister.
@harvestfire 's stitches and bloody head made me almost pass out.
update on @harvestfire: she is waiting for stitches. Or staples. In her head.
@harvestfire just cracked her head open on a German Wheel. I hope everything is okay! Parents made me stay home to watch the other sister.
@harvestfire tankoo.
It is likely that my new obsession in life will be furoshiki. Oh Japan, you are so good at folding things!
Charming guy just played impromptu piano at Dunn Bros. He left before we got a chance to say thanks. :(
@creepyed I just read your blog post. I am so, so sorry. If there is anything I can do to help, call me.
@courtney_5887 Thank you. ^_^
@creepyed I just watched Burn Notice.
I got my job! Going to Japan in August. SO exciting.

@harvestfire Opal Freeck.
opal frique. krazy rosey. mlia.
Just got done practicing my old-person skills: sitting up in a chair and sleeping. Also, my distant relatives and I have nothing in common.
The ending of #theRiches was seriously unsatisfying. Stupid writers' strike.

@courtney_5887 It just hit me how much it breaks my heart to not have you as a twice-weekly presence in my life. I miss the DePlex.
Burn Notice is amazing summer television.
When I stay up until 5 a.m., it's never for something important.

Wearing my dice shirt designed by @wilw. A guy at Borders complimented it. We talked gaming while I got notebooks for the game I DM tonight.
I just want to hear about the Japan job so I can GET ON WITH MY LIFE.
@courtney_5887 Kellogg performs solo in Milwaukee (8/22), Chicago (8/23) and Bloomington (8/25). If I am stateside, want to go to one?
See you later, see you soon.
Some days I just don't feel smart. My mom had to explain to me salted-in-the-shell peanuts yesterday.
@harvestfire Heck yes. To whom are you issuing this challenge?
At circus practice. There's a guy here from Germany doing a special German Wheel workshop -- I love it when he talks. So German.
@creepyed I miss you too. My sister and I talk about you ALL the time.
I feel like I'm allergic to being awake.
It's awful to watch someone act out being on a lot of meth. I can't imagine how afraid I'd be of a real meth-head.

@sthede No, but it's eerily similar in some ways.
Spent the whole night doing D&D character creation. For other people.
@balamoot "Is handle animal useful?" "Only if you want to handle animals."
"I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment."
Hanging out with @balamoot and it's awesome.
Drinking Kristian Regale out of the bottle makes me feel like a wino. Except it's fizzy juice.
Watching Psych. Just bought the first two seasons CUZ I LUB IT SO MUCH.
I miss having @courtney_5887 as a daily presence in my life.
I miss "truthbombs."
This Intel ad makes me indescribably happy every time I see it. Go Ajay Bhatt. http://bit.ly/NiBj1
@harvestfire "Can you teleport in D&D?" "Yes. There's a spell. It's called teleport."

@kaliopeg I would have been happier if that penultimate episode was the season finale of Bones, as I originally thought.
@troyler Your mom? Cuz if so, I like her.
@troyler Was it a super girly gay boy drink?
Someone's car alarm was going off for about 20 minutes this morning while I tried to sleep. I might hunt that person down.
You know when you lean back and stretch and your tummy muscles feel good? Contortionists must have to go all the way around to get that.

"This seems like an appropriate moment to talk about human goo."
@troyler Watching. It must be like birds picking at a corpse.
@troyler Dang it. I missed the best part of the weekend.
@courtney_5887 I wonder what they'll do with mine. I hope mail it.
@harvestfire Swing batta batta swing batta batta swing batta batta swing.
@aturco Glad it didn't rain.
@aturco Hope you are enjoying commencement. I am with @troyler on this one. Except I am watching another circus performance.
Why have my text Tweets been failing at timeliness lately? Also, relatedly: @aturco Everyone misspells it.
@aturco Lol. In your defense, almost everybody does it.
@aturco Stop misspelling my name! And I dunno.
This concludes the Livetweet of Circus Juventas blue show. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. CST: purple show! There will be no Livetweet, though.
German wheel done. And last act: shoot through. Takes forever to set up.
Holy shit. These two guys doing straps just stole the damn show.
UV costumes + contortionists = eerie
All-female teeterboard teams suck.
Russian springboard! I'm Googling more of this when I go home.
Choreographed dance to "Circus" by Britney. Only one girl pulled it off. The rest didn't have enough hips for dancing.
Mid- and low-wire just kicked it. Now the hoop kids are going ... which is cool, except their costumes look like full-body condoms.
Second half. Bungee trap OH NOES.
Those unicycles are taller than I am. "Uniflogging Molly."
egyptian boob attack.
Break dancing!
Pirate-themed Spanish web. It makes me motion sick just to watch.
"It's time to play with fire!"
Snoopy theme and kids balancing on globes.
Pink Panther theme and a suitcase with a $ on it.
Speech by Dan, the owner. Informed us there are 1000 costumes this round of shows. Side-by-side trap wuz awesome. Lauren shouted awkwardly.
Little kids in Peter Pan and Tink outfits on boats. Like 40 of them. Their trapeze and beam routines include falling.
Circus show: blue edition. Livetweeted by request of @troyler
@Mallorymc I know. Where are you moving after graduation?
@OrganizeFish Apparently yes. There was about 6 hours difference there.
I'm HOME!
60 miles south of Rockford. Wendy's chili is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten from there. 6 hours of driving left (at least).
@harvestfire Backlogged because I have life things to deal with.
Bdubs in Plainfield with the housemates. Nom nom chicken.
@troyler I remember hearing about that table.
Fringe rocked it. Oh. My. God.
@TimothyNiccum No, unfortunately. I graduate this weekend and will be home in about four days.
"Who let the dogs out" is playing in The Duck.LOL.
For $2,200 you can buy a replica of Kirk's original chair. Or you could buy every Star Trek season ever made and still have about $1000.
I've lived with dudes for almost 3 years and I still don't understand the appeal of messing with people while they're in the bathroom.
No, won't leave until Thursday. Will you be around at all tomorrow?
Contemplating passing out on the bed while listening to the tirades of Barney Stinson.
@sthede I am going to stop by either around 3:30 or 4:30 (I have to be somewhere at 4).
@sthede How late will you be in your office today?
@sthede Don't laugh at me, I got a grand total of five hours of sleep. I also might kill these girls blabbing outside my window.
Just got home from the seminar all-nighter with Brendan, Emily, Julie, early-leaver Drea, late arrival Rachel and drive-by Smoot. SLEEPTIME!
@courtney_5887 Half my seminar class is writing at the library (including me). What are you doing tomorrow?
I want my Twins cap. Right now.
@troyler Ditto. I want nap.
@creepyed I miss you already. Send me your address! I need it for lettersing!
Season finale of Dollhouse was great. Now, finally bedtime.
@troyler No. But I could. Here, let's see if they show up on your display: やった！
@troyler Glad other people are tweeting at obscene hours. It's really the best use of the internet.
In the library, writing seminar and watching "The Court Jester." WINNER.
@creepyed Denny Crane has the most fabulous ties EVER. They make me want to wear suits.
"I need this duck like a diabetic needs insulin. Like a wheelchair guy needs a wheelchair."
Lol. It IS about the DZs. They mentioned us.
Is this episode of Boston Legal about the DZs?

Best thing ever in the history of things: pajamas. A close second: slippers.
Senior reading went awesomely. Probably 150 people there. Whoah.
OMG @creepyed ALAN AND DENNY ARE DANCING
@TimothyNiccum How long are you in MN?
@balamoot We need to hang when I come home. When are you home?
@creepyed I am staying clear of that shit. Also, I stole Boston Legal. You'll get it back soonish.
@creepyed WAKE UP!
Splurged in IBC Root Beer for paper writing. So far today: 17 pages.
Do I need to get out of my chair? Or is it a walking pick-up? If you want to find me via foot, go up the main stairs and look right.
@creepyed What? Also, what's the plan for studying?
@sthede You mean between those parts where God destroys everything and when Jesus shows up?
@troyler I only take issue with you if you are anti-gay/anti-gay marriage. If so, let's have it out later. When I'm done with my paper.
I want to read the Bible just so I can tell the conservatives WHERE TO SHOVE IT.
Done with my CSC paper! Rejoicing!
"9 Songs to Save the World" — Norwegian Recycling
@sthede I'm pretty sure the paper for your class will be done by the end of the day. Want me to Twitter you or e-mail when it's submitted?
I am SO getting these awesome plugs-in-floor things when I have a house. They are ridiculous handy.
The GCPA is crazy maze-ier.
Secreted away in the PCCM. I bet people couldn't find me if they tried — this place is like a maze!
@sthede Touché.
@sthede Oh no, birthday parties and FUN and getting PAID for work whatever will you do.
@sthede I hate you for having nothing left to do. I don't want to write things any more.
@creepyed I am, but for a stupid student loan exit interview for which I'm going to be late.
RT @noahwilliamgray 150 people die of #swineflu & everyone wants to wear masks. 1,000,000 die of AIDS & nobody wants to wear condoms.

This might be the foggiest it's ever been at DePauw.
Distracted from goals by backgammon.
I love it when mist blankets the campus.
first time with inbox of zero I FEEL ALIVE AGAIN
Student loan exit interview stuff makes me angry and uncomfortable but they threatened to put a hold on my transcripts if I don't do it.
Watching Boston Legal and finding Twitter clients instead of working. This last week is going to be painful.
@aturco Lol. With getting out of here in the next hour. P.S. Hi.
I don't know how Fringe manages to blow my mind EVERY week. &lt;3 J.J.
"I only use my junk for good, not evil. With great junk comes great responsibility."
"Is that supposed to be an insult? 'Cause Nancy Drew solved every case."
@sthede How do you think Japan feels about being co-opted into the dominant ruling class in the genre of cyberpunk? I'm thinking annoyed.
@creepyed The movie isn't working, we're just staring at a blank screen. What's not to tweet?
Why did Twitter unlock my updates? Also, technology fail. It's interfering with "Blade Runner" in class which is bothersome.
@creepyed CONGRATS! Do you get to keep going?
@sthede Yeah, well, I don't get EVERYONE'S tweets to my phone.
@creepyed No word yet? I check Twitter about every 10 minutes hoping you've posted something. SUSPENSE
"You murdered somebody over a fake word."
"You're kind of docking your ship in your port."
Brought chips and salsa to class. I don't know if I bought way too much or nowhere near enough. I'm not good at judging portions.
I might kill for Greek food right now.
@troyler Agreed. It gets worse when you start running into art majors.
@organizefish @creepyed CONGRATS!
"You know what I'm going to do, Brad, just to show you there are no hard feelings?" [pause] "I'm gonna sleep with your wife."
@harvestfire The actress who plays Juliet is on Boston Legal ... as a crazy person. Lol.

@creepyed I rented Boston Legal season 1 from the library. You need to come home. Also, GOOD LUCK AT FINALS.
SLEEP IS FOR WINNERS
Rented season 1 of Boston Legal from the library. Jamming with it and Bomb Pops.
@creepyed I think it all went pretty well. How is your weekend???
@kakana550 Of course. P.S. It's Loopy!
@fyreflie I am excited to come to your reading! I expect you'll rock it.

I love Chicago. Printed on a restaurant menu: "orange drink"
"The machines are forcing you. They wanna watch. That's just how they get down."
My ride to Chicago took more than an hour extra because of traffic. I am never moving here.
@troyler Alas, I am currently fighting Chicago traffic and won't be back until Sunday. Missing my last chance at a DPU drunk weekend.
High Hopes is playing on my iPod ... how's your weekend, DePlex?

@harvestfire I'm so hungry.
@harvestfire yes and it's delicious.
@harvestfire No kidding. I am having a tootsie pop and it is delicious.

No more columns! @troyler Yay for not having to do stuff. Except I still am waiting for sports.
@troyler  Bruner is having an epileptic .... something. When will that column be done?
@troyler Lol. We were just discussing who was writing that column.
Anyone want to go see Tomy with me next weekend? Apparently it's going to be big and sell out.
@creepyed I shall look forward to it immensely. Like giants.
@creepyed And do you like chocolate chips?
@creepyed Now or tomorrow?
@creepyed Or now. Now is also feasible. But I will not be a good hostess because I am sleepy.
@creepyed If you come by tomorrow ... we made cookies. Tons and tons of cookies.
Fine, DePlex. But you missed out on sweet confectionary delicious. FREE sweet confectionary delicious.

@creepyed You're going to have to let me in on the details Sunday. Or if we hang out before that.

@creepyed Text me or something. I think we're grilling out and having sangria so I'll be around. (And you know I don't go to sleep until 6.)
I just realized I need to go see Watchmen. Except I haven't read the comic yet. WHAT DO I DO OH SWEETNESS NO.
Time for Heroes. And around 5, Dollhouse will go up on Hulu, so there's the rest of my night [morning] shot.
@creepyed I got my shirt. OMG OMG OMG. What time are we finishing your character tomorrow?
@sthede Nothing, now. It was an unnecessary fuss, as it turns out.
Time to kick up a fuss.
@troyler It's a losing battle. Soon they'll start holding weekly support groups. Probably Wednesdays around 10 p.m.
Remember POGs? Are you ready for this? The name comes from a fruity drink: passionfruit, orange, guava.
@creepyed I forgive you cuz you're awesome.
@creepyed Why are you doing that at @sthede instead of me? I asked the question. THIS IS DISRESPECT AND I WILL HAVE NONE OF IT.
@creepyed Are you a Spanish major? .... Did we already talk about this?
"Whoah. Talk about low-hanging fruit."
@creepyed I found it. Also, that was a lot of tweets about porn.

@sthede I do, I just like hard copy.
@sthede Damn. If I had mad lockpicking skills, I'd ... feel too bad to break into your office.
@creepyed Does this mean you like brussel sprouts, or that you don't like them and just want me to eat them?
Kroger was out of frozen brussel sprouts.	Like ... out, out.	I am crushed.
@sthede If you're around tomorrow, could I maybe borrow your hard copy of Pathfinder for the weekend if you're not bringing it on your trip?
@creepyed The livetweet shall be saved for a slightly more momentous occasion. And I ALWAYS hope for invisible things, as a rule of thumb.

@creepyed Hold the phone. We still have no level because Eman hasn't picked a campaign. So we can't really yet.
I just woke up and had 66 new e-mails.	WTF?
@creepyed If tomorrow is Wednesday, I'm free anytime except 7-8 p.m.
Muzak, the great maker of elevator music, has gone bankrupt. Considering I have not used an elevator in recent memory, I am unsurprised.

I love shows where the bad guys are still Communists. And by "still" I mean "from the '90s."
You buy one bra from Victoria's Secret and somehow they've got your e-mail forever.
Surreal moment at 6 a.m. (before I went to sleep): Blagojevich walks onto a stage somewhere over the caption "BLAGOJEVICH BOOK DEAL."
@troyler I remarathoned all of Lost this summer in a week. I earned my amusement.
@courtney_5887 Yeah, but ... it'd be funny.
@sthede Yeah, that one.
@troyler I laugh every time I see your Lost statuses. In a good way. Think you'll be caught up by the time the new ep airs on Wednesday?
[Jack] "Anyone ever tell you you have a dirty mouth?"	[pirate] "Yeah, your mother. When I was showing her how to wax my plank."
"The only honor he's interested in is JUMPING ... on her."
Oh Jack of All Trades! / Hulu gets better daily. / Nerdiness abound.
@sthede If you have @creepyed 's character sheet, can you bring it to class tomorrow so I can finish it this weekend?
@balamoot Sexdrive? Hmmmm? What is this I wonder?
@sthede You get this awesome LOLism for that awful joke: lollerskates.
"This is our fantasy man! It's like we're hobos!" "I don't have a hobo fantasy, man!"
Eff that. I don't care if you agree. Psych IS the pinnacle of great television.
You may not agree, but Pysch is the pinnacle of television as far as I am concerned. "I'll be the one flaring my nostrils uncontrollably."
@balamoot WHEN oh when will you be home for spring break?
Awesome LOLism: lolcano.
@creepyed That would be kosher. Though Emmanuel is running it and he hasn't decided on a level yet. Who has the character sheet?
I just don't understand what would possess anyone to make a cake shaped like feet.
@creepyed Ed, I'm making your character for next week. What do you want to play?
I'm to storyboard on time for once and now I just have to wait. This encourages tardiness. Wait and see.
Always wait for the shit you order at Dunkin' Donuts: http://tinyurl.com/byyp24
@troyler Bruner and his what?
@balamoot That Spider-Man was not canonical. If I were Stan Lee, I would have shot some bitches.
I should have been a programmer. Or a software developer. Or an engineer.
So far on Thursday night drinking: someone else pukes, I bleach the whole effing bathroom and everyone goes for cigars. Next up: Firefly.
Apparently you're not allowed to be gay, lesbian or bi on Xbox live. I feel better every day about not buying anything Microsoft.
I hope everyone in the world appreciates sandwiches as much as they should. Which is a lot.
Just got my first dirty TDP e-mail: Good grammar is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
I just wrote a 2-page critique of something I don't like and then lost it. Technology: 1, Elissa: 0.
New episode of Fringe doesn't air until April? Awwww man.
Dollhouse's dialogue is disappointing. Why do writers not realize that good dialogue moves everything?
@troyler If you win the lottery, I dibs some of it.
@creepyed lolz. I am too.
@kaliopeg So slacking in the newsroom tomorrow and watching Lost online. If I can wait that long. I hear from Courtney they're up at 5 a.m.
The local channels aren't working. Haven't been for 9 minutes. I am missing Lost and about to conniption it up.
Song that should be in your iTunes library cause of its pure awesomeness: You Give Love a Bad Name - Bon Jovi
