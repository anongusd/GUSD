@Nyman1Mary @seanhannity This had nothing to do with trump!  It was brought forth by the NAACP and grass roots support in Florida. 64% of the citizens voted in favor of this.
@ServisCB @seanhannity Because the people voted for it and an overwhelming 64% of the state voted for it. This referendum was voted for during the same election that a republican won the gubernatorial race. This is a bipartisan effort to acknowledge their debt has been paid.
@c_demauro @seanhannity No, the referendum was voted for by the citizens of the state and an overwhelming 64% voted in favor. This ruling excludes murders and sex offenders. This is a good and decent thing to do for people who have paid their debt to society.
@imretiredareyou @seanhannity That‚Äôs perhaps the most ill conceived and ignorant statement you could‚Äôve made.
@seanhannity As a Floridian/Veteran/Prison Administration I think this is an excellent measure. I voted for this along with 64% of my state. Once you‚Äôve served your sentence, your debt to society is pain in full.

@ryanwfraser @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump If it turns out a true and everlasting peace can be achieved, then fantastic. But forgive those of us who are skeptical not only bc Kim has reneged on every promise of peace he‚Äôs ever made and for Trump‚Äôs penchant for allowing bluster and narcissism to rule the day.
@ryanwfraser @ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump Wasn‚Äôt a big enough explosion to have actually disabled the site, only to close the entrance temporarily.

@ShennaFoxMusic @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs South Korea and North Korea that have brought us to this point. They have done this despite Trump‚Äôs reckless antics. The problem is that we are giving Kim what he‚Äôs wanted without him having to give up anything to get there.

@Andani2008 Marijuana literally kills zero people each year. That‚Äôs truly the most apples and oranges comparison.
@Andani2008 These mass shooters were lawful until they walked into schools or shot out of hotel windows and took life. The lawful argument doesn‚Äôt apply.
@Andani2008 These guns are made to kill other humans, period. They aren‚Äôt for hunting, they aren‚Äôt for sport. They are designed to take human life. Why do you feel that anyone needs to have weapons like this?
@Andani2008 Why can it not be the defining pinnacle of our nation?  If we stand together against this and define sensible gun control legislation, we say to our citizens that we care about their safety and still respect their rights. No one wants to take shotguns and single shot rifles.
@Andani2008 Indeed. They wrote the 2ndA to protect our new country from a foreign invasion from Britain, who we just defeated, or a tyrannical turn in our own government. However, when you have a gun and your government has drones, that no longer applies.
@Andani2008 So in that regard you‚Äôre ok with the status quo, of children being murdered in schools, as long as they don‚Äôt take any guns away?  Why can‚Äôt we agree that an AR-15(which is used in most mass shootings) is a weapon no civilian needs?
@Andani2008 The safest countries on earth are the ones with strict gun control laws. That‚Äôs just fact, plain and simple. More guns are not the answer as our society has clearly shown. We have more guns per capital than any other country and we are one of the deadliest when it comes to guns.
@Andani2008 The constitution is a glorious set of guidelines. However, our founding fathers made it amendable bc they knew they didn‚Äôt know everything and couldn‚Äôt predict the future. As someone who swore an oath to uphold that constitution I truly believe they didn‚Äôt envision this chaos.
@Andani2008 Australia had its last mass shooting in 1988. After that, they bought back almost every single gun from citizens before enacting stringent gun control laws. Since then, no mass shootings. We lead the world in mass shootings and our lax gun laws are a culprit.
@Andani2008 I appreciate your kind words. I just worry that decent seeming people like you are on the wrong side of history when it comes to guns. The 2ndA was written when everyone had muskets, incapable of this type of massacre.
@Andani2008 Because I‚Äôve tried protecting a community inundated with firearms and fanatics ready and willing to lay down their lives for their convictions. The radical right and gun lobby remind me of that fanaticism. Obama was right, they cling to guns and religion much like the Taliban.

@GabbyGiffords @MattMurph24 It‚Äôs amazing how 2ndA nuts go full on crazy when you dare to delve into the idea that some guns should be banned. I‚Äôm a veteran of Iraq and Afghan, I know that assault style rifles are made with the sole purpose to kill humans and don‚Äôt belong in civilian hands. Period.
@Shiba_Fan0 Well then you missed the point of being in the military. You defend your country/citizens/government from ALL enemies both foreign and DOMESTIC. While you may think your militia is in the right for it‚Äôs views and supported by a majority of citizens, it‚Äôs not.
@mageetravis So are AR-15s. We can have a conversation about the over prescribing of psychosocial drugs and gun control at the same time if they‚Äôre honest debates.
@Shiba_Fan0 If those American citizens were arming themselves with the express intent to overthrow the government, damned right.
@Shiba_Fan0 As a Citizen of the US, you retain every right.  But their are some that are muted by your active duty. But you‚Äôre talking about taking to the woods and taking up arms against your government. When you commit treason, you give up all rights.
@TuckerCarlson wipe that perplexed look off your face. It‚Äôs guns, it‚Äôs the AR-15, that‚Äôs the reason behind this senseless act. If we all still had muskets, this mass shooting couldn‚Äôt occur.
RT @tonyposnanski: He who takes $3,303,355 from thou NRA gives two shits about anyone but thyself and should resign. Tony 2:14 https://t.co‚Ä¶
@tonyposnanski Let‚Äôs end the gun control/rights debate right now:  Take all guns off the streets. Then, anyone who is 18 years old or older can get a government issued Musket for free.
@Shiba_Fan0 My bottom line is:  If the government comes for your guns while you live in your tent in the woods and you‚Äôre armed with an Ar-15 and a shotgun, their tanks/ships/jets/missiles/bombs will destroy you and your militia buddies. Musket to Musket was reasonable, this isn‚Äôt.
@Shiba_Fan0 I‚Äôll be perfectly honest with you. I‚Äôm a gun owner, a veteran, and a southerner. My whole family owns guns and hunts. But I will gladly give up my guns if it means I help save innocent lives.
@Shiba_Fan0 Keep your bow, keep ur Musket. U might kill one or two people if you had the intent. But with these other weapons, ur intent is magnified by firepower that is overwhelming. It‚Äôs sad that ur side is so scared that u can‚Äôt admit some guns need only be used by professionals.
@DishCommish @GabbyGiffords @MattMurph24 Well played.
@williamlegate @hititfergiemua End the gun control/rights debate:  Take all guns off the streets and issue everyone over the age of 18 a Musket.
@Shiba_Fan0 Nope, just a Musket. A single shot weapon that any true marksman can use to take down a deer or other animal they‚Äôre hunting. But you‚Äôll get your gun. You just won‚Äôt get one that‚Äôs specifically designed to take human life like an AR-15.
@Shiba_Fan0 Here we go, let‚Äôs end the gun control/rights debate right here:  Every gun comes off the street. Then, everyone above the age of 18 who wants one, gets issued a Musket.
@Shiba_Fan0 There we go. Let‚Äôs train more unstable teenagers how to use firearms. There‚Äôs your answer. Instead of them watching YouTube videos and shooting cans in their back yards, let‚Äôs train them how to properly kill. Does it even resonate how ridiculous that is?

@Shiba_Fan0 I want to give them due process by summering them to extensive background checks!  I want the guns that have the ability to cause this much damage in a short amount of time banned. If everyone still had muskets we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation.
@Shiba_Fan0 Sure, that‚Äôs what we need, more guns for people who want them and trigger happy militia forces surrounding our schools... safe.
@Shiba_Fan0 Doesn‚Äôt matter the reason?  So if someone buys a gun with the intent to take another human life it doesn‚Äôt matter?  When someone with a mental illness buys a gun it doesn‚Äôt matter?
@Shiba_Fan0 Australia did this by buying back guns from its citizens and banning all future sales. Since this happened in 1988, no mass shootings. I‚Äôm sorry, I know Americans love their guns, but we have a problem. You can say it‚Äôs not guns all you want but in reality that‚Äôs simply not true.
@Shiba_Fan0 Great, so you want to take it a step further?  Ban all semi automatic weapons?  Ban all guns?  Now these are ideas I can get on board with!  As a veteran I say guns belong only in the hands of the military and law enforcement.

@BillOReilly Way to deflect away from the issue of guns, you spineless wretch. There‚Äôs a reason the US leads the world in mass shootings and it‚Äôs bc our gun laws are a lax joke.

@pfabiani @BillOReilly If you feel that way about Clinton getting a consensual blow job while married and commuting a sultry and lying about it, surly you believe that Trump who‚Äôs done much worse should be removed from office too.
@TomTsaint2 @BillOReilly No facts?  You mean the fact that over 20 women have accused both Trump and O‚ÄôReily of sexual harassment and assault and both have settled cases related to some of these charges?  Only believe the men... must be a republican.

@lmcdaniel64 @realDonaldTrump By dregs who are you referring to? Are they dregs just based on where they‚Äôre from and the color of their skin? Most Americans are descendant immigrants from countries once considered shitholes like Ireland, China, Germany, and Italy.
@lmcdaniel64 @realDonaldTrump Let me pose a question to you. If you had been born in one of these ‚Äúshithole‚Äù countries and your children were threatened by violence and starvation, would you wait the 10+ years it takes to become a citizen or would you do everything you could to give your family a better life?
@JordanP00292563 @realDonaldTrump As a professor of American History I absolutely disagree with your assessment. The republicans of Lincoln were liberals and the Democrats were conservative. Now those roles are reversed, this isn‚Äôt hard to see.
@lmcdaniel64 @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt believe immigrants should gone before citizens. But I do believe that immigrants are and always have been the life blood of our country. Immigrants have a higher % of college degrees and a lower % of crime. From slaughter houses to military, they provide great services.

@MalcolmHensley7 @SenFeinstein You're absolutely right. But the problem with both bills is that there was no regular debate/order.

@realDonaldTrump You really just don't get it do you?  You can't lie and make this go away. You can't lie and change the law. Flynn turned on you to save his son from going to jail. He saved his son so that yours will go to jail.

@MalcolmHensley7 @SenFeinstein The ACA also provided a record number of citizens with healthcare and extended Medicare to states that weren't near sighted.

@KareninNC1960 @FoxNews If you watch the actual press conferences the only narrative you have is your own. Watch them, then fact check the things she says. It's mind blowing the amount of times she lies and distorts the truth in each one.
@KareninNC1960 @FoxNews I haven't watch CNN in years, lil fella. I do my own research by sourcing a story from multiple angles. I also simply watch sanders in her press conferences. Try it sometime. Instead of allowing yourself to be ignorant by chewing and regurgitating the slip fox "news" feeds you.
@docrocktex26 @MSNBC So much for his @SenWarren argument. But honestly, who didn't already know that he is a complete fraud?
@SpeakerRyan What about in the White House? An accused sexual harasser/assaulter is the president of the United States and you remain silent about him. Where will your hypocrisy end?
@culloden59 @FoxNews No, republican automaton lemming, I had it right the first time. Do you even watch her press conferences or do you just ingest the bs that fox "news" feeds you? Watch them for yourself, use your brain, I know it's been awhile but I promise it can still work if you try.
@FoxNews Sanders lies every single day to cover up for the president's dishonesty and ignorance. She deserves the criticism. That's what happens when you abandon ethics and principles for power.

@Haydenishere @BernieSanders Sustained year long 3% growth. And as I said, you mindless republican automaton lemming, the first 10 months of this year were still in obama's economy. Trump took credit for his predecessor's work. Plus, obama had 7 quarters of over 3%, just not yearly.
@Haydenishere @BernieSanders I have a copy of the federalist papers sitting on my desk at the university I teach American history at. I assure you I'm abreast at what the founding fathers wanted. The whole reason they (shortsighted for sure) created the electoral college was to keep a conman like trump away.
@Haydenishere @BernieSanders A week and a half is all the time in office Trump had under his belt before he started talking about how low unemployment was and how high the Dow was. The same economy he berated for a year and a half.
@Haydenishere @BernieSanders Because of Obama's economy. Thank him! His economy just ended in October. The economy has been growing at a brisk pace for 5 years. But republicans made you think it was all bad until magically a gameshow host turned it all around in a week and a half.
@Haydenishere @BernieSanders You poor unfortunate person. I'm very sorry that you're so ignorant &amp; misguided. I'm sorry the public school system failed you, it isn't perfect. Help us make it better. Help us keep our children from suffering the same ill destined fate as you. It's not Marxism, it's patriotism.
@Haydenishere @BernieSanders Don't be ignorant. Don't be that person. Corporations are doing extremely well, have been for quite a few years now. As the president points out daily, the Dow is at an all time high. The money isn't trickling down, it never trickles down.
@BernieSanders Every senator in swing areas that vote for this bill need to be voted out in 2018. Any democrats that vote for it need to be primaried.
@BernieSanders It's amazing to me that (R) voters simply swallow every line their Congressmen throw at them. It's as though they are afraid to think for themselves out of fear they're the ones who have been conned into giving themselves away.
@BernieSanders Spineless savages giving in to corporate greed.

@BillOReilly Then no one would talk to the president...
@catsmow1 @dabarnes2006 @JLongGallegos @SenFeinstein I'm from Mississippi originally so I can say this, but due to the sheer lack of quality education in that state, each vote should count as half. But this is America, it should be one person one vote. Not weighted electoral college victories.
@catsmow1 @dabarnes2006 @JLongGallegos @SenFeinstein No, lil fella, 3 million more Americans. It doesn't matter where they are from. What matters it that they are citizens of these United States.
@catsmow1 @SenFeinstein Really? Did the pilgrims have papers? Did the Irish during the potato famine? Did the Chinese during the gold rush? It's amazing how little of history your side actually knows. The truth is, this country was built on people coming here illegally and becoming citizens after.

@dabarnes2006 @JLongGallegos @SenFeinstein That's the one thing I actually agree with him on. The electoral college is an archaic system based on an agrarian civilization. Just like the ridiculous voting on Tuesday in order to let farmers travel to town after Sunday mass.
@dabarnes2006 @JLongGallegos @SenFeinstein You mean the same electoral college trump called rigged and said he would protest if Clinton won by electoral college? Riddle me this: If Trump has won by 3mil votes and lost the electoral college, do you think he would let it go? He won and he can't even let it go.

@LarryG_831 @kathormot @SenFeinstein The worst thing about this partisan atmosphere engulfing our nation right now is that most people stay in their corner and spew rhetoric they agree with. It's hard for people to sift through and disseminate information for themselves. It feels safe to rely on familiar sources.
@LarryG_831 @kathormot @SenFeinstein That was clever repartee. I gave you my sources when you asked. But if you want me to give you all of the statistics on gun violence in America then we are going to be here awhile. I didn't assume anything about you either, I simply stated the sites to stay away from.

@kathormot @LarryG_831 @SenFeinstein And where do you get your information from? Oh that's right, you've offered exactly zero information to the conversation. You've only hurled insults and cheerlead others. Quiet, lil fella, grown ups are talking. At least Larry has coherent thoughts.
@kathormot @LarryG_831 @SenFeinstein Read the information. Look at the sources. Gun Violence Archive, Miles Institute, FBI. But do your own research. Don't just rely on the NRA, fox "news", and your buddies. I'm a veteran of Iraq/Afghanistan and I own guns, but we have a problem that needs addressing.
@LarryG_831 @kathormot @SenFeinstein When mass shootings happen and it's not Muslims, there's silence on any kind of inhibitors to this violence. It's chalked up to "crazy" "lone wolf". Gun sales soar. Not one word from the NRA owned Republican Party on any sensible gun control. Hell bump stocks are still legal!
@LarryG_831 @kathormot @SenFeinstein The issue being is that when a brown Muslim terrorist does anything, the president immediately calls for border security (which would've done nothing) and extreme vetting (which again would've done nothing since the driver of the truck was radicalized since arriving in US) but...
@dabarnes2006 @JLongGallegos @SenFeinstein The people? Almost 3 million more people voted for Hillary. The people did speak, the electoral college silenced them.
@kathormot @LarryG_831 @SenFeinstein You really are an ignorant human being. You only chimed back in once someone else said something because you knew you had no information or even the ability for abstract thought to comprehend the discussion we were having.

@kathormot @SenFeinstein You bring race into it by only being outraged by the brown Muslim man driving a truck as opposed to the white male citizen that killed 59 people.
@kathormot @SenFeinstein Put yourself in their perspective. You were born white and in a free country, they were not. They didn't have the advantages you had just based on being born in a different geographic location.

@kathormot @SenFeinstein My point is that you choose one crime and attach that to all immigrants.  But I'm sure you don't do the same thing with all gun owners and gun violence. And yes, violence wise the people born here are quite a bit more violent to their own citizens as opposed to immigrants.
@kathormot @SenFeinstein Not all citizens are nice either, actually by pure percentages refugees/immigrants are far less likely to commit a crime than natural born citizens.
@kathormot @SenFeinstein 8 people killed by a terrorist in a truck. 33,000 killed by gun violence every year. 59 killed by a white shooter in Las Vegas. Selective outrage, no?
@dabarnes2006 @SenFeinstein That's easy for you to say considering you were born white and in a free country that provides a good education for your kids. Now imagine yourself living beyond that imaginary line we call a border. Would you not do everything you could to give your kids a better life?
@kathormot @SenFeinstein Then why is Trump cutting down the amount of legal immigrants and refugees allowed into this country?  Also, dreamers are school age kids that were brought here by no fault of their own and are adding to our society by military service/college educations.
@SenFeinstein We must do our part by voting out the party that's destroying our American values. The Republican Party has forgotten we are a nation of immigrants. It is our civic duty to protect these bright young minds.

@qq_american @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump No, you're what's wrong with this country. You're turning a blind eye to a person who used a position of power to prey on children. Moore has been accused by multiple women and was banned from a mall for his behavior towards young girls.

@qq_american @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You commented on me coming back to talk to you about hours being away. I simply told you where I was.

@garciajm999 @billmaher @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes, they are still assembling ballistic missiles but that was not part of the deal.

@garciajm999 @billmaher @DonaldJTrumpJr That's the problem though. You're ignoring everything this president is doing bc you disagreed with some things the other ones did.

@emperorbaldur @billmaher @DonaldJTrumpJr I believe the truth. I source that truth from a variety of sources. I don't join the 24hr cable news herd. I think for myself. When I was stationed in Iraq all of the coverage of what we were doing was skewed. Especially on fox "news".

@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr No, they all get kickbacks. That's why I said ALL.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr I agree on the Saudi money. But you're simply wrong that Hillary benefited personally by this deal.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr You think Shep is a liberal??? Lol. Just bc he doesn't always regurgitate the same garbage everyone else at fox does? We won't claim him as a liberal, but sometimes he shows some journalistic integrity, unlike his cohorts.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr That's just more garbage your conservative sites have poisoned you with. Have you ever listened to NPR? They simply report facts. If they have expert opinions on their shows, both sides of the argument are represented.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Russia hacked the DNC database and waged a propaganda campaign to sway the election in Trump's favor. The Trump campaign was in touch with Russian agents as well as Wikileaks in an effort to gain political capital. Yes, she did lose. But Russia interfered with democracy.
@Intelligal49 @DonaldJTrumpJr Ooh you cut me real deep with that one. I've read some of your replies. You really don't try very hard to sound like you have any intelligence whatsoever. Maybe it's bc you revert to insults and regurgitating fox "news" talking points. But you should try harder.
@mgratk @DonaldJTrumpJr Hillary didn't make any money from the Russian deal, bc the U1 deal wasn't personally approved by her. It was approved by a committee of 9 gov officials and could only be stopped by the president. Also, look at the facts, don't regurgitate fox talking points.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr No, don't watch CNN either, you'll simply back into your corner. Read politico/wsj/BBC/NPR. Plus, google "actual uranium one deal, transcript" and read it for yourself. Don't be a puppet on a string.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Please please please please look up the actual parameters of the deal, please. Stop regurgitating fox talking points. Russia did hack our election, they are ran by a dictator, human rights abuses are endemic , but they aren't evil people, as a people.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Absolutely they take bribe money and the NRA is the biggest lobby in the country. Of course they get kick backs. I'm saying this deal has been scrutinized by two administrations and no, zero, nada wrongdoing has ever been found. It's a conservative talking point only.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Better yet, I tell you what. Google one of your fox boys, shep shepard discussing the u1 deal. He does a pretty decent job of summing it up.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Do research!  The answer is no, it was a government committee that no one got paid for. Stop standing on a partisan dime and just assuming the worst. Look up the information for yourself.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Fox is the propaganda wing of this administration and they are corrupting your mind. You are spewing out rhetoriconly found on alt right "news". It's simply not credible.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr Stop swallowing what fox "news", rush, and breitbart are feeding you. Do the research for yourself. If you do, you'll realize no weapons grade uranium swapped hands and Clinton personally didn't approve or disapprove anything. A committee of 9 approved the deal.
@beckydecker8 @DonaldJTrumpJr You people are so incredibly ignorant. Look upnthe actual facts to that deal. Hillary was barely involved and she had no say to terminate the deal. It was made my committee and the only person that could stop the deal was the president. And no weapons grade uranium changed hands.

@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber Are a narrow minded automaton lemming to the ignorant rhetoric plaguing this country via our current admin, be careful what you retweet.

@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber I'm not saying people w/opposing views to me are ignorant. There's plenty of smart people who disagree. But the things u post are ignorant.
@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber I don't subscribe to the rhetoric you post &amp; retweet. But I absolutely judge u based on your narrow minded beliefs. Ignorance is ignorance.
@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber Because if you see people w/opposing views from you as mentally handicapped then I guess I must be. Bc I don't subscribe to that rhetoric.
@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber I looked through ur feed before I commented &amp; saw the nonsense you post &amp; ignorant people you retweet, so I take it as a compliment from u.
@Savage__Matt @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber Is that meant to be an insult? It's hard to tell with you simple minded republican automatons. Next time try to go above 3rd grade.

@Hey___its___me @LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber They banned an ignorant bigot. I applaud uber for standing up for decency against the empty rhetoric of a sad angry woman.
@LauraLoomer @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano strives for equal rights and equal treatment. You are an ignorant bigot. You try to incite violence against Muslims.
@LauraLoomer @Alyssa_Milano I really didn't realize people were as openly ignorant as you are. Your rhetoric is simply ridiculous.
@LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber They didn't ban a conservative journalist. They banned an ignorant bigot.
@LauraLoomer @Cernovich @Uber No, their anti-bigot. You ma'am, are a horrid human being. Good for uber by standing up for decent hardworking human beings over you.
@Khanoisseur @ken_crichlow Well it's a good thing congress has failed to do anything he's wanted to do so far.
@ThatMichiganGir @LauraLoomer Asking an entire race orvrekigion to apologize for the actions of one man is simply bigotry &amp; ignorance. Read a book/learn/grow, or shut up.
@ThatMichiganGir @LauraLoomer Muslims do speak out about terrorists all of the time. But that's not covered in fox "news". Get your head out of your a$$.
@ThatMichiganGir @LauraLoomer What? White people didn't have to apologize for the white supremacists. No one asked a race to apologize, bc that's ridiculous.
So everyone in New York is supposed to move on with their lives except Muslims, bc apparently they should feel responsible. Ignorant bigot. https://t.co/oQ1x3R9ZJy

@JudgeJeanine When you have to put in your bio that you're highly respected... that means you aren't highly respected but want people to believe you are.
@realDonaldTrump You and your condolences are so incredibly fake. You have to read your sympathies bc nothing good comes from your heart.

@prosica @realDonaldTrump I was a soldier for 8 years, now I'm a liberal professor. I've lived both lives. I served with distinction, just didn't swallow the koolaid.
@prosica @realDonaldTrump It's mystifying how so called patriots can forgive so much when it comes to trump just bc he says what you want to hear.
@prosica @realDonaldTrump He despises fellow soldiers? Doesn't seem patriotic. Trump was a real draft dodger. Why couldn't fight bc of feet but still play football?
@prosica @realDonaldTrump Trump did not. He got deferments for bone spurs but still played sports in college. He is a coward.
@prosica @realDonaldTrump If you honor your family members in service you wouldn't support someone who only talks the talk. He got 4-5 deferments to draft dodge.
@prosica @realDonaldTrump Your president doesn't like soldiers that were captured. He insults gold star families. He doesn't even know the names of soldiers KIA.

@prosica @realDonaldTrump I feel sorry for you. Hopefully one day you can emerge from this cloud of disinformation you've been immersed in. I hope you can grow.

@thehill Surprising? Not at all. He's for big business. No bigger business than big pharma.
@FoxNews I'm a veteran &amp; aware enough to understand that the protest isn't about the military it's about civil rights. It's their right I fought for.
@SpringbirdN2016 @BorderBob @foxandfriends Trump saying it's all fabricated is the issue. May be some things that are false in it. But to say it's all untrue backs him in a corner.
@SpringbirdN2016 @foxandfriends Hey, I don't care if Trump likes women peeing on him or inanimate objects. To each their own. But stop acting like it's fabricated &amp; admit.
@JoeNBC Isn't that always how they play their hand? They bluff until the cards are shown then they want to take back their bets.
@foxandfriends For the record, the dossier has not been discredited. Saying something has been discredited doesn't make it so.
@MikeMorton2530 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews You can't really be that naive can you? Hacking our elections was an act of war. But are we at war w/ Iran/NK/Syria? No. All enemies still.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews That's ridiculous. You're equating paying an MI5 agent (an ally) to do opposition research to using Russian agents (an enemy)?

@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump How about we just do away with all religions then no one would be persecuted for imaginary gods.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Because their fairytale conflicts with other fairytales.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump It's not meaningless when you use the hypocrisy of ones own religion and the blind spot in that religion pertaining to trump.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Have you read Origin of Species? That's not some pseudo religions text for me, but you keep bringing up evolution so I just think u should.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump The Bible was written to give hope to a suppressed and enslaved people. It did that. But just like every fairytale, it's time to wake up.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Yes!  That's what science is!  It's questioning everything &amp; learning as much as you can about it. Faith is the absence or abstract thought.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump I focus on helping my fellow man here, now, not waiting on a fairytale afterlife that'll make everything better. Believe in us, not magic.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump The difference is I don't care that there's no god. I spend very little time thinking about it anymore. I focus on life now, here.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Do you realize that your comments are just hollow ridiculous statements? Do you truly believe the garbage you spew?
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump I've read your bible and Quran. I've studied religions most of my life, they are fascinating. But they are not based in reality.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Wow. With every tweet you spew more and more ignorance. Have you ever read Origin of Species?
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump If you want to believe in a magic man that controls all things, go for it. But your beliefs are open to scrutiny by others just as mine are.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Believe what you want, we do, just don't try to run other people's lives based on a medieval ideology.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump No, your opinion on atheism is just fine. But when you try to plaster religion into our government, that's when we say "enough".
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Obviously your brain is hurting as you can't seem to come up with a credible response.
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Evolution you don't believe, but an invisible loving overlord that controls everything except reason and logic, that's the truth?
@noone_juan @suck_opinion @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump That argument literally makes no sense.
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Questioning someone's intelligence bc they don't believe in an invisible angry wizard in the sky?
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump It's completely ignorant of someone to think I cannot have an opinion about religion based on the fact I don't believe in it.
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Am I not allowed to know anything about religion bc I'm atheist?  My religious studies professors from college would disagree.
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump How am I turning my back on being an atheist by pointing out the hypocrisy of Christians concerning trump?
@noone_juan @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Look at the 7 deadly sins. Trump personifies all of them. Just like a Christian to turn their back on their religion for politics.
@RWPUSA The reason our constitution worked so well until now is bc it was created by great men who knew they didn't know everything. Now Trump...
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Christ would've hated @realDonaldTrump for his envy/wrath/sloth/greed/gluttony/pride/lust. You know, the seven deadly sins.
