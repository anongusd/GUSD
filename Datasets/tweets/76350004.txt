This morning on @TCNewstalk w/ @DavisandEmmer I welcomed the @whitehouse to MN. Listen here: http://t.co/S2NN46uc #ObamaInMN #stribpol
No. 1/ Bottom line is this: @whitehouse cannot be hostile to job creators, but friendly to job creation - it's a failed policy. #ObamaInMN
No. 2C/ In 2009, @whitehouse promised to fix economy in 3 years w/ unemployment rate below 6%. Again, hmmm. #ObamaInMN
No. 2B/ Today’s dismal jobs report marks 40th straight month with unemployment above 8%. #ObamainMN
No. 2A/ So-called stimulus – mother of all earmarks – came with @whitehouse promise it would keep unemployment below 8%. Hmmm. #ObamaInMN
No. 3/ Verdict in: @whitehouse trillion-dollar stimulus spending binge created debt, not jobs. #ObamainMN #4jobs #2futures #stribpol #tcot
No. 4/ Avalanche of @whitehouse job-killing regulations. “It boggles my mind how you would regulate dust,” MN farmer tells me. #ObamaInMN
No. 5/ Gas prices have doubled since the President entered the @whitehouse. #keystone #ObamaInMN
No. 6/ @whitehouse promises to “protect Medicare” but #ObamaCare guts $500 billion from Medicare. #ObamaInMN
No. 7B/ @whitehouse now estimates new #ObamaCare regulations forcing 80% of small businesses to give up current plans by 2013. #ObamaInMN
No. 7A/ @whitehouse on #ObamaCare: “If you like your plan, you can keep it.” Reality check - Wrong. #ObamaInMN
No. 8/ @whitehouse puts in place #NLRB that tells private companies where they can and cannot create jobs. #ObamaInMN
No. 9/ @whitehouse occupied campaigning - 5 stops today in Mpls and Chi - as 30 House-passed jobs bills are blocked by Senate. #ObamaInMN  
No. 10/ @whitehouse budget failed 99-donut in Senate. #ObamaInMN
Follow my top-10 list of reasons @whitehouse must make a U-turn so Americans can get back to work. Stay tuned. #ObamaInMN #stribpol 
Attention @whitehouse: Minnesotans tell me you can’t be fundamentally hostile to job creators and friendly to job creation. #ObamaInMN

I just wrapped up tonight's telephone town hall meeting. Thanks to everyone who participated!
Q9: Burnsville resident asks how spending on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya is going to affect the spending cuts debate.
Q8: Eagan resident concerned about difficulty of receiving science grants.
Results from tele-town hall poll: 59 percent of participating constituents support a #BalancedBudgetAmendment. Just 24 percent oppose.
A: Significant tax reform and loopholes would lead to increased revenue because it would put Americans back to work.
Q7: Inver Grove Heights resident asks if increased revenue can be part of the conversation to balance the budget.
A: We must work to protect and preserve Medicare and SS and reform entitlement programs so they are there for our kids and grandkids.
Q6: Eagan resident disappointed in lack of Social Security cost-of-living increases.
A: We've seen a blizzard of regulations the past few years that are bad #4Jobs, including from the EPA.
Q5: Burnsville resident has concern with local utility company issue.
A: I voted for the extension. The Senate needs to pass the FAA extension because it's good #4jobs.
Q4: Eagan resident: Frustrated with behavior from politicians. Example - FAA lack of funding is costing people jobs.
Asking constituents if we should amend Constitution to require federal government to balance its budget? (Results in 15 minutes)
A: GOP budget called for closing loopholes to reform the whole tax code. The federal gov't has a spending problem not a revenue problem.
Q3: Burnsville resident wonders how US can sustain without increased revenue.
A: The #debt is a good debate to be in and the agreement was a good first step, but it's only a start.
Q2: Eagan resident doesn't think Congress explains how Washington is running up an unsustainable deficit that grows by the day.
A: Keep speaking up and share your thoughts with Congress. "Reach out in every way you can."
Q1 from Apple Valley: Calle concerned about biases in mainstream media.
