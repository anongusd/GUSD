@SharpestJim Because we have no recordings of that older music, only composed sheet music.
@MarianeMatera Bam.
@CynicalMike @thebeatles With the Belmonts, yes? (Love their 1972 @TheGarden reunion album.)
.Loving all the replies! Interesting, too, that so far no one has named the band I would name.
Apropos of #YesterdayMovie, I have long asked: If all music were catastrophically erased from memory EXCEPT @thebeatles and one artist whose canon of work you could magically preserve, whom would you choose? My answer embarrasses me. Will give after some respond.
@easalter @BartonBishoff @thebeatles So we needn’t introduce into our critiques of the film every real-life factor which would render its premise untenable; rather, like most of not all art, it is best appreciated on its own terms. A documentary it isn’t. Love you, Bart! (What’s with the Russian?)
@easalter @BartonBishoff @thebeatles Based on the trailer, which is all I’ve seen, the film is an exercise in imagination, much like the song “Imagine.” Lennon only asked us to imagine a world with no countries, religions, etc. — not necessarily to build one.
So @SenTedCruz has proposed the #ELCHAPOAct, which would steer the estimated $14 billion in assets of #ElChapo to fund the border wall that @realDonaldTrump seeks. But what does @POTUS himself think? Watch my story for @WeAreSinclair: https://t.co/O4sNB6U52g via @YouTube
@ImJohnOHurley Hope you are well, my friend.
I love how #YesterdayMovie will allow us to re-experience @thebeatles as if they were brand new — the effect the songs have when played for the “first” time — but the trailer was too effective for me in projecting us into a world where no Beatles are alive; I wept.

@ColleenDoran I have great respect for Aparo. But as he aged, the volume of his output notwithstanding, he seemed to take less care with anatomy, shading. The Aparo of 1986 and beyond doesn’t compare to the Aparo of 1975. I made no representations as to his personality, kind or otherwise.
@frogchildren @PatrickZircher Bless you! Thanks so much.
@frogchildren @PatrickZircher Thank you! Can you provide a citation for Cooke's comment?
@PatrickZircher Please follow me back so I can DM you.
@PatrickZircher In my mind the best of the imitators, for lack of a better term, were Aparo and Sienkiewicz. The latter evolved into a multifaceted artist of staggering talent and range, an influence in his own right; Aparo, as he aged, got lazier. Hitch brings a strong dose of Neal.
@PatrickZircher Great example there.
@PatrickZircher How do you see that influence, that widespread imitation of his work, having played out? In what ways was it noticeable?
@PatrickZircher Interesting. I have told folks, including Neal, that he ruined comics for me, because after being exposed to his work, I couldn’t accept anyone else’s (most especially the imitators).
@PatrickZircher You said you can see the point -- what is the point? What do you think was meant by the original comment (i.e., that Neal ruined comics)?
@PatrickZircher Do you have any idea where the quote about Neal having ruined comics can be found? Or who said it?

@_MikeMcCartney_ Mike, remember when we met at Paul’s Gershwin Prize event at the Library of Congress, in Washington, when I introduced myself as the Scaffold fan in attendance? “You’re a class act, James Rosen,” you told me. Hope you are thriving this Christmas. #artyjokes
@BrettBentley17 My favorite hero is Batman and no one has played him correctly, to my preference. Merry Christmas!
“With Daredevil some radioactive material fell off a truck and got into his eyes. Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive spider. These were not very intricately thought-out things; they were usually the first thing that came into my mind.” — #StanLee, 1976/3
@Vanns40 You’ll hear more soon! Same to you.
“Usually the other people who have written the stories here at Marvel, like Roy Thomas, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, and so forth, when they create characters they usually put a lot more care into them.” — #StanLee, 1976/end
“It was on everybody’s mind in the early Sixties and seemed the easy thing to do. Bruce Banner has to become The Hulk, so I arranged for him to be somewhere where a gamma bomb exploded. The rays of the bomb hit him and bingo!” — #StanLee, 1976/2
“I never paid much attention — as you might be able to tell — to the characters I created. I took the easiest route....When I was creating characters nearly all of them gained their super-powers through some form of radioactivity.“ — #StanLee, 1976/1
@1stSSF One of my favorite photos of them. Same to you!

@jpd158 @FourSeasons Scroll backwards. I just explained it to someone else.
@moople72 @FourSeasons .No, he didn’t. He was perfectly@pleasant until I identified myself as a fan of his work. We were both dressed in suits and ties with overcoats, standing outside the Four Seasons.
3/ Having memorized every episode of “The Odd Couple,” and having had pleasant encounters with both Klugman and Randall, I was so disappointed that #NeilSimon was rude the one time I met him, outside the @FourSeasons in Washington. Approached him w/ respect that was not returned.
2/ “The Odd Couple” was to me the height of modernity, with its sophisticated depiction of the complexities of 1970s life in Manhattan. Almost impossible to me that it is now acquiring all the trappings of antiquity. #NeilSimon -&gt;
#NeilSimon RIP. When I was growing up @wpix showed “The Odd Couple” 4x/day. My friends and I watched them all. Several of us memorized every episode. Not kidding. We knew the trivia (which episode they switched apartments, ditched the laugh track, etc). —-&gt;

Here is another example: https://t.co/aPPYTKglXu
Israeli journalists are writing about me (in Hebrew).

@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense That was related to me by a credible and highly placed source as one of the problems the program was experiencing in terms of mismanagement.
@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense So I'd be curious if you could tell me what was "fake" in the news I reported. But I doubt you will. Did you even read the article?
@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense Moreover, I credited MAVNI as having had many success stories, and cited independent testing that showed MAVNI recruits outperforming peers.

@jpodhoretz As @PaulMcCartney has averred about Picasso, even his "worst" works have something unmistakably Picassoesque about them, and thus appealing.
@jpodhoretz None "unalloyedly." But "Mr. Moonlight," "Wild Honey Pie," and "Oh Woman, Oh Why" grate, as does "most of Lennon's "Some Time in NYC" LP.
@jpodhoretz Agreed, but "Imagine" is so not one of them.
@jpodhoretz I love that song, too; but you are a bad man.
@JayAlver @dcastillo82 @jpodhoretz "Imagine" was not socialist; it did not advocate for "no religion," etc., only asked that such be imagined: a thought exercise. cc: @yokoono

@RicochetEJHill @MuhammadAli He didn't run away to Canada or disobey the laws; he submitted to them and pursued his legal case until SCOTUS vindicated him. Like a man.
@RicochetEJHill @MuhammadAli Actually he didn't make a living. He was illegally stripped of his boxing licenses and the best 3.5 years of his athletic career were taken.
50 years ago today: @MuhammadAli refused induction into the armed forces as a conscientious objector. In 1971, #SCOTUS upheld his position.
