@jimpiasecki93 Not really, no. I wrote repeatedly they should sign Harper.
Our #Yankees notebook (by @GeorgeAKingIII and Davidoff) has stuff on Aaron Hicks, Masahiro Tanaka, Luke Voit, Domingo German and more. https://t.co/eL7mZ0gTak
Brett Gardner and Aaron Judge think the #Yankees can break their own record, set last year, for most HRs by a team. https://t.co/wDTHvlueRj
Aaron Hicks didn't take batting practice and won't play today after experiencing back stiffness following Friday night's game. He didn't undergo any tests, feels better today and the #Yankees are hopeful he'll return to game action on Tuesday.
@mikebronx300 I just wrote a whole column saying they should have signed Harper.
@possaspizza @rdh4 How do you know what I want?
@davesizzle Because he wants it all.

@favortj That's not realistic.
@george_gz29 Nope.
@dcnive Oh, never mind.
@dcnive Excuse me?
@Kevinsantana11 The goal is to win games.
@nyybrxbomber Wow.
@antimet2 Doesn't that go without saying?
@nyybrxbomber You're really going to let Estevan Florial prevent you from signing Bryce Harper?
@SeyMoreeeee You are full of crap.
@Pinstripe_Blue What an odd tweet.
@rerickulous The #Nets?
@Kevinsantana11 You can't have both?
@nyybrxbomber I didn't realize they had to choose between Judge and Harper.
@jonjy36 It depends on how you measure them.
@SeyMoreeeee What an odd tweet.
@Michael63677117 But my job is to first-guess when I can.
@a_fookin Yes, I do too. That was the column.

@K27_Paulino Ah, but read the column.

@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues Yeah, you're not going to win any intellectual battles by citing the captain.
Just under the wire! Good job. Unfortunately I can't reciprocate. https://t.co/90pgtq1PU6
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues It ties the historic low of '79 to '96. I just don't believe October results to be evaluative. They got a lot of lucky bounces from '96 to '01. You're better off sticking to the division titles.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues You've crunched the numbers on regular-season records from 2004-18? Because we all agree that October is a crapshoot and those results are not evaluative.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues Nooo. I'm saying we should trust no one. Some conclusions can be drawn (the payroll is down), some can't (all the private stuff involving revenue and other expenditures).
@Jeanette607 @bdcowboyup Yes.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues Of course they don't publish financials. They're private corporations. Those team-value analyses are just guesswork.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues How are those revenue numbers a matter of record?
@brendhaniscool I didn't buy in. I didn't misinterpret. It was a throwaway line.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues There are reasons to doubt the conclusions drawn.
@jmassengale @RiverAveBlues @Yankees I don't get paid to assume. I can't make accusations and allegations that can't be substantiated.
@brendhaniscool Because it was a joke. He was trying to back off his proclamation from the previous day, one that surely upset the Players Association, that they weren't in at all on Harper.
@brendhaniscool I can't believe how people have latched onto a silly quote by Cashman.

@JoshSabo1 @mulk_cj Asked and answered.
@mr_victor7 @jwelge96 @ant_sin @RiverAveBlues I think it's likely he checked with his social media people, based on his history. And the reaction to Manny has been extremely polarizing.
@bbqbaseball62 @bdcowboyup It's guesswork.
@DanDemelfi @bbqbaseball62 That's a good job by Hoch. My overall interactions have been much closer to 50-50.
@masapequaparkng You're entitled to hate the column all you want. Just surprising that you would get personal. I certainly recognize your handle and thought we'd been mutually respectful for a long time now.
@bcorson16 @RaXoR_Shu It's not resolved yet. When it is resolved, the questions will be asked.
@GBThePinstripes I do, but he's only a two-year commitment.
@bbqbaseball62 @FakePeteGammons The real Peter doesn't accuse people of lacking integrity when they disagree with him.
@ArielMiguel_24 @Emmanuel_z24 I get paid to have opinions.
@bcorson16 @RaXoR_Shu OK, thank you for using real data. Your argument obviously is legitimate, I just don't like the reliance on Forbes' stabbing around in the dark.
@bbqbaseball62 "Kool-Aid drinking portion..." And moron is a noun, not an adjective.
@DapLajoie They're on this timeline.
@tparlato11 Have you seen their books?
@RaXoR_Shu I can't answer that, and I understand why you're upset, but my point is that Forbes is admittedly stabbing around in the dark with those figures. It's not like they have access to the #Yankees' books.
@ArielMiguel_24 @Emmanuel_z24 Third party writer?
@yankees177 @O2012R2014 I'm not sure about the starting rotations.
@mr_victor7 @jwelge96 @ant_sin @RiverAveBlues I don't write the headlines.
@StableGenius_69 I am on record that passing on Verlander was very foolish.
@PatMoor32033002 @jonnysaysrelax Now I'm fabricating stuff?
@bbqbaseball62 You sure as heck implied it.
@StableGenius_69 Check my timeline.
@learytim Many people on this very timeline disagree with you.
@tparlato11 Fans should be more discriminating of the data they utilize.
@RaXoR_Shu Is that the nonsense from Forbes?
@mulk_cj Hoch already did one. I'm telling you that my responses throughout this month have been closer to 50-50.
@PFMazzone It is split.
@masapequaparkng I really don't know that. Sorry. I've always tried to be respectful of you. I'm sorry to see it isn't being reciprocated.
@O2012R2014 @yankees177 Significant gap?
@DapLajoie The truth hurts.
@PatMoor32033002 @marcuszappia "The majority of the fan base" does not follow me on Twitter.
@mmt___al Good point. LOL. Even 25 percent is a sizable anti-Manny contingent.
@Pete_Griffin16 It's intellectually lazy to play the "If George were still alive..." card.
@boberle123 I traded for Chapman and signed him to a massive contract?
@Lugerini OK, thank you for the clarification.
@BostonZRealty George has been gone for a long time. Let him rest in peace.
@Lugerini I've got plenty more I can send you.
@Lugerini Why are you replying to me? The point is you accused me of making up anti-Machado sentiment and I think I've proven I wasn't lying.
@mmt___al Believe it or not, many #Yankees fans are not even on Twitter.
@warschu @Lugerini That guy was a much better player than Machado.

@TT_215 Many #Yankees fans are not pissed.
@RaXoR_Shu You've seen their books?
@bcorson16 No. I can't believe how many people are making something out of his Death Star comment. It was a joke!
@Lugerini Check my timeline. It's an even split.

@caniopsu Very unlikely.
@Im_Mike_Y Did you forget to read the entire column?
@MaxCNY It seems like you're working yourself into a lather over a hypothetical.
@uconn51590 Not a soul is saying Tulowitzki is the reason the #Yankees can't go after Machado.

@PatMoor32033002 Nor would I.
@philgalletto I don't find it very humorous, and surely you can't expect me to speak on behalf of anyone besides myself.
@jonnysaysrelax As would I. But you nevertheless dissed three valuable players.
@BavielloJames Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.
@PatMoor32033002 There's obviously some sort of mutually beneficial financial agreement there.
@Jeanette607 @LukeBecker_YN26 It's less serious, if that's what you mean.
@PatMoor32033002 @Angelo_Pappas_ Jack is not on that show.
@PatMoor32033002 @Angelo_Pappas_ There never was.
@Angelo_Pappas_ @philgalletto What are you talking about? Dan Clark reported that Machado would sign with the #Yankees. I am reporting, rather obviously and in line with virtually everyone else, that Manny to the #Yankees looks like a long shot now.
@philgalletto Are you seriously accusing me of selling my integrity?
@jonnysaysrelax LOL! Alrighty then.

@LukeBecker_YN26 @Jeanette607 "Exploring trade options" is not "shopping."
@Angelo_Pappas_ Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.
@MichaelPacholek So...you disagree with me, but you agree with me?
@mulk_cj As I wrote in the column, that's not great.
@Markol19 @peterp2000 I can't stress enough how unreliable Forbes is on this stuff. Their "data" really should not be cited.
@Markol19 I agree with you on Harper, but not Machado. But also, Hal has consistently said he wanted to keep the payroll around $200 million. Resetting the tax rate was not done with the intention of going nuts again.
@PatMoor32033002 And anyone who questions whether Manny would be a good fit for the #Yankees is fundamentally an idiot and a suckup, as per your expert opinion?
@pinstripealley Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great - Actually Me.
@Jeanette607 I haven't seen anyone report that Andujar is being shopped.
@PatMoor32033002 Surely you understand the volume of #Yankees fans with whom I interact. Many are happy not to have Manny. Nothing to do with corporate BS, everything to do with watching Manny's act the prior 7 years.
@BobbyMilone29 No.
@PatMoor32033002 I really would be careful about speaking for anyone besides yourself. I try to do the same on the media side.
@PatMoor32033002 You are entitled to hope whatever you'd like.
@BobbyMilone29 Low.
@PatMoor32033002 @BenBerkon Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.
@Markol19 I really don't think you should speak for all fans. Many are happy that Manny appears to be out.
@Markol19 @peterp2000 Have you seen their books? I haven't.
@NYY_NYR I don't know who told you that.
@PatMoor32033002 Right, Forbes. Completely reliable. LOL.
@NYY_NYR No.
@PatMoor32033002 Where are you getting that revenue data?
@peterp2000 Because they can spend whatever they want, they should spend recklessly?

@TooGooden16 Emphasis on the "About."
@45thEnt @PanicCityNYMtL We report on this constantly. Including right now.
@iman_lerner Wright's salary is still his player salary. That goes on the books. Real front-office and other staff do not.
@TooGooden16 I'd prefer that you not use a hard figure when we're dealing with a great deal of murkiness.
@TheJRBarnes It's not a non sequitur. I'm telling you that we write constantly about the #Mets' spending. Including this very piece.
@TooGooden16 Oh. That is quite the estimate.
@TooGooden16 Who said anything about $129 million?
@HenrySanchez As stated clearly in the story, there's considerable guesstimating involved there.

@Easyfreezy33 The point is they SHOULD have a lot to spend. Whether they spend is it another matter.

@RU_2021 You got it. Congrats! Send me your address at kdavidoff@nypost.com.

@NYglesias1 @BobbyMilone29 @KHausNY He played too much centerfield last year. He's OK in the corners.
@NYglesias1 @BobbyMilone29 @KHausNY You didn't answer his question.
@KHausNY He's great nonetheless. And they very well might change the rules on the shift.
@GlockRivers @bbqbaseball62 Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.
@philgalletto @rben408 What?
@cafael1 What?
@tedcatino09 No.
@Just_MLB He played a lot of CF last year, which wouldn't happen with the #Yankees. He got into one fight with Papelbon, an established moron.
@SJSbarra It's in the column.
@tedcatino09 I don't see them bringing back Castro.
@NeilKirbyNY Time machine is better. 😀
@JakeElSnizake @BYankeefan He most certainly is. My bad. But I'm not sure who you mean, then.
@JakeElSnizake @JamesAs51995487 I don't. The Miami owner at the time was nuts.
@rben408 I’ve never heard the term “water boy” used in the context of a restaurant.
@rben408 What an odd tweet.
@JamesAs51995487 No one is giving him 13 years.
@cpbernhardtjr That's fair. He can learn.
@tiz71 @Eric_M888 Eh.
@Junior6926 I get it. But I'm not sure he's a fit personality-wise, and I think Andujar is a special bat.
@Brian_Cashman_ Correcting you on your agreement is odd?
@Junior6926 Right, that's in the column. Florial had a nothing year. He's no guarantee.
@ThomasHayostek Maybe I'm overly optimistic on Harper, but I feel like he's athletic and could improve with a team more plugged into analytics.
@jonnysaysrelax @JoeG_32 He played a lot of CF last year and it didn't go well.
@morganmiller242 LOL.
@Junior6926 They need an OF long-term more than they need an IF.
@nickkoch28 @bitsygirl3 Not every one, but quite a few.
@Desroches23 @JoeG_32 As I wrote, I agree with you.
@Brian_Cashman_ It's my most popular one, but not my only one.  And wouldn't it be "comeback," singular?
@ThomasHayostek Harper is a better defender than Stanton.
@Brian_Cashman_ What an odd tweet.
@Junior6926 What about the #Yankees' positional needs?
@bitsygirl3 What an odd tweet.
@PinnacleTaxMan It won't.
@morganmiller242 What an odd tweet.
@Brian_Cashman_ Do you mean "so shouldn't everybody else"?
@bdcowboyup Did Stanton become a great fielder and not tell me?
@JoeFL65 Neither is happening.
@PinnacleTaxMan He'd cut it.
@BYankeefan Bauer? That wouldn't go well.
@mbeezy2599 I'm busy no matter what.

@zalta2 Yup.
@yanks871 You realize championships are not the proper measure of a team's success, right?

@Brian_Cashman_ It has been a range of experiences - sometimes perfectly delightful, sometimes less so. But obviously I'm not basing anything I write solely on my personal interactions with him, right? That would be silly.
@Tomackze He already loves it.
@Brian_Cashman_ I have met Manny and interviewed him multiple times. How odd that you would assume I haven't.
@morganmiller242 @ryanmc817 I don't recall writing that he isn't a tremendous baseball player.
@CharlieHangley @AngryMetsFan13 OK. Who said he'd be anything beyond that?
@Samuelbball24 He might not even make the team. But the speed is obvious.
@Samuelbball24 He stole 21 bases in 28 tries last year in limited playing time.
@AngryMetsFan13 What an odd tweet.
@Brian_Cashman_ @LastSingleDigit My god, the obsession on the idea that the players "like" him based on photos and empty quotes...
@AllenSturgill Or maybe not.

@heres2sports @bdcowboyup OK.
@BL02026 @Eric_M888 @bdcowboyup Good grief, you're not much for nuance, are you? Of course Betances wasn't lying. But that doesn't translate at all into Manny being a fit or not.
@Eric_M888 @bdcowboyup I am insinuating that a happy photo does not mean Manny will be happy as a Yankee.
@BL02026 @Eric_M888 @bdcowboyup Right, because baseball players routinely blow up former teammates publicly. It happens all of the time.
@Eric_M888 @bdcowboyup I rest my case.
@Eric_M888 @bdcowboyup I don't even know what to tell you if you think those photos carry any meaning.
@MikeDesorbo1 @jonnysaysrelax @bdcowboyup I think he would struggle with the scrutiny, yes.

@ChoochCast What an odd tweet.
@shoewizard59 I disagree, but you're not alone.
@bkrudy It might be as skillful, but it isn't as important.
@GeorgeFalkowski Number five was an abomination.
@iRotohead You are conflating pitcher wins with team wins.
@iRotohead They should be wholly ignored.
@JerryTrupiano Thanks, Jerry.
@estein2223 No it isn't.
@estein2223 What in the name of Anthony Edwards are you talking about?
@Pronate What an odd tweet.
@bkrudy @OhLaughingBoy You are getting your chocolate in my peanut butter. You are debating like three different things simultaneously.
@GeorgeFalkowski Phenomenal! Thanks for sharing, George!
@groundruletrble Total bases is a good stat! Slugging percentage is legit.
@Weej69 You're not alone, but I'm sticking with win.
@1BostonFanatics @RoadToOctober "You guys"? LOL. Who appointed me spokesman?
@bkrudy @OhLaughingBoy Hits are every dependent on the quality of a pitcher's defense.
@CBSScottWhite We can't rest until the planet is eradicated of people who believe in the win.
@bmurree24 No.
@jasoncollette That's not great either. But I'l stick with wins.
@dgoold That's pretty bad, but wins are still worse.
@Rich_Mellon @GrantCMichaels They throw far harder today, and many guys threw too much as kids thanks to travel ball, etc.

@BryanFelice RBI are pretty dumb, but I'm sticking with wins.

@scottwthurston But some managers still try to push their pitchers to that 15th out to qualify them for the win.
@ClassallTDN What an odd tweet.
@chris2263 @HimayKoenig4 What? Sabermetrics isn't a stat.
@GeorgeFalkowski I didn't!
@SicaRichard You have to look at his ERA+. He pitched in a hitter-dominant era.
@CarlosMarti36 @JCPerezJR LOL.
@fzwanzger9 Because you kill things that are dangerous.
@bereasonable2 And that's my fault how?
@zogsport7 Thanks Bob! Statistical studies have shown that "pitching to the score" doesn't occur as much as we think.
@bkrudy @OhLaughingBoy And the context behind wins shows that it is a wholly useless statistic.
@DavidWaldstein Win. You can’t lose out on a save because someone enters the game after you and performs poorly.
@OhLaughingBoy You don't lose a save when someone who enters the game after you pitches poorly.
@jeffpasquale00 Why thank you! It has served me pretty well overall.

@ivan_padres It's in the column.
@jeffpasquale00 And yet here you are tweeting about it.
@CJ_Esposito And it's our job to eliminate them to ensure they don't multiply a la Stripe in "Gremlins."
@octonion I am not defending RBIs. I'm saying they're not as bad as wins.
@Askagreatdad As I wrote, it depends on how you came to that conclusion.
@ethan_witte My god, are people getting worked up over the word "controversy." I just had some fun with a couple of the people who still believe in wins.

@vridner Judge. And your comparison of Ohtani to Venditte is absurd.
@daviedoobie OK, first of all, maybe you notice the ERA difference there. Second of all, Ohtani had a 152 OPS+ in 367 plate appearances. Shreve struck out in his one plate appearance.
@daviedoobie LOL. He wasn't robbed.

@ricodorean21 @SimonettiSource The "Drury trade"? LOL. Looks to me like a non-trade (Drury to #Orioles). Jon is one of my mentors. I am happy to give your pal credit if it is merited. But based on our exchanges, I'm not impressed with your camp's grasp of nuance.
@GBThePinstripes @SimonettiSource My god, the exaggerations. Cashman told everyone of the mutual interest on Monday. "Exact structure"? LOL. Everyone knew it would be a one-year deal with a pay cut. And Joel had the agreement first, clearly.
@GBThePinstripes @SimonettiSource @DiannaEris @KING_KAGINS You are mischaracterizing the report. "Nearing a deal" means "Let's get through the fine print and a physical." "The #Yankees made an offer that CC has not accepted" is not "nearing a deal."
@SimonettiSource Worried? LOL. I gave you credit for advancing the ball a couple of yards but you clearly did not score the touchdown. I respond because it's the right thing to do.
@SimonettiSource I don't know what to tell you if you don't understand the difference between "an offer is out for him to accept" - and again, good job having the $8 million figure, although that was the figure that everyone was predicting - and "the offer has been accepted." All my best.

@GBThePinstripes @SimonettiSource @DiannaEris @KING_KAGINS I apologize if I indicated otherwise. And while Simonetti did have the interesting nugget about the $8 million offer, he did not break the story of the agreement. I'm not sure how that's unclear.

@SimonettiSource @DiannaEris @KING_KAGINS @nypost Exactly. They were in disagreement over the money. Then Joel broke the story that they agreed on the money. There has been mutual interest from the outset.
@DiannaEris @KING_KAGINS @SimonettiSource @nypost Your guy reported that the #Yankees and CC were in disagreement. Joel broke the story of an agreement. If you can't see the difference there, then we probably aren't going to see eye to eye on anything. All my best.

@FreyDaddy4 @MetsDaddy2013 Right. Look up Prince Fielder's settlement and then you'll see how rote this is. The idea that you have any grasp on this situation is beyond laughable.

@billpilgrim Wait, sorry. To clarify: Insurance doesn't pay for active days on the roster.
@FreyDaddy4 @MetsDaddy2013 It's not a big deal. Not sure what you mean by Wright and the PA will ensure that Wright gets paid. From their standpoint, it's no different than any other player contract.
@billpilgrim Right, but now there will very likely be a settlement.
@MarcCarig And you would know, given that you covered David for nearly three of those seasons.
@billpilgrim $20 million divided by 187 times six.
@MetsDaddy2013 MLB, yes. It's really not Wright's or the PA's concern. He'll get paid normally.
@JohnnyHoey The greater point to me is it really isn't that much money in the first place.
@drewshea01 We'll find out.
@MarcNYY618 Not all of it, and yes.
@vegaskev No, he just copy/pastes press releases about new food items at ballparks.

I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have concerning the inevitability of the #Yankees finishing 92-70 and the #Mets 84-78, but if you ask me about Alex Guerrero, I'm just gonna walk away. #Patriots
@livinglarge86 @Wiseguy791 What an odd tweet. Of course I'm proud. I'm supposed to feel shame because I swung and missed?
@ZeppieriTony What makes that a better question? It’s the exact same concept.
Accountable. https://t.co/Llv3xrOiHD
@Jeanette607 No, I wasn’t a big Odd Couple guy.
Can two baseball teams - one destined to go 92-70, the other 84-78 - share a Twitter shtick without driving each other crazy? #Yankees #Mets #RIPNeilSimon https://t.co/Ajq86zUZMy
@Wiseguy791 I'm not sure how that's relevant to this column, and I'm not sure why people think they're inflicting damage on me by bringing up failed predictions. I couldn't be prouder of that pick.
@MalinoAlex I don't see it, and with all due respect, neither does anyone else. I paid tribute to McCain's embrace of respectful disagreement. It was pretty simple.
@MalinoAlex What comparison?
@MalinoAlex My record dig?
@MalinoAlex Paying tribute to a fallen American hero is tasteless?
What would it take for the #Yankees to actually catch the #RedSox in the AL East? https://t.co/gAIHUdyooP
@pjmclaugh That's not good. My bad if I misheard.
@ScottDonig Who among us hasn't had a "crass moment"? Bill Clinton put out a statement praising McCain.
@NYY1996BR Really? LOL. I plead guilty to the allegation of general arrogance but I'm not sure what about this column is condescending.
@DJMESQ53 It's the job, right? Being a fan is a fireable offense.
@rchpkevin How am I making him out to sound stupid? I don't think he's stupid. His words were interesting, that's all.
@rchpkevin What an odd tweet.
@Jeanette607 Yes, teammates are never listening to clubhouse news conferences.
@berniebirnbaum Yes, you don't understand what "Summer Siesta" means, even though it is clearly explained in the column.
@Bobbytam333 I'm not saying he's done. I'm saying his timeline makes 2020 impact more realistic than 2019.
@Bobbytam333 I'm not sure Montgomery will be much of a factor next year.
@berniebirnbaum A point has been missed.
@BobbyBOOMS18 You don't understand the shtick.
@JeffrosMusic No reason to decide that now, right? I'm happy to answer in November.
The #Astros are now 5-1 since the #Athletics tied them atop the AL West. https://t.co/dxSgAcp35p
J.A. Happ has stabilized the #Yankees' starting rotation and has been the best development in their Summer Siesta. The overall concerns linger, though. #Orioles https://t.co/GSTyTfY8TR
@Jeanette607 His mates probably had no idea until they saw or read the quotes.

I often troll haters of my "#Yankees 92-70, #Mets 84-78" shtick with the quip "Respectful disagreement is what makes our country great.” John McCain actually lived that credo. RIP to an American hero.

@originaluyf1950 What's blurry about the reality that no one has excelled at hitting and pitching in 100 years?
@Starchild1328 Of course they do. Everyone knows that. Hence the oddness of your tweet.
@SeyMoreeeee Whoops. Thank you.

@LenKasper Just imagine viewing a ballgame from a blimp high enough so you couldn't see the ball's travels. The one component you'd be able to determine, by watching the players' actions, is whether it was a walk-off or not.
@LenKasper Watching you guys now. "Walk-off" win has meaning because when when the home team wins in the bottom of the 9th or later, the losing team must "walk off" the field in disappointment. Whereas most of the time, the team on the field wins &amp; gathers to celebrate.

From now on you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "#Yankees 92-70, #Mets 84-78"! Do you maggots understand that? #RIPRLeeErmey
With the #Marlins in The Bronx, their CEO Derek Jeter is making the right call by avoiding #Yankee Stadium. Actually, Jeter's overall low-key approach might pay dividends. https://t.co/sR4bIjSuM3

A new study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships determines that it takes about 50 hours of interaction to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours from casual friend to friend and 200 hours to finally agree that the #Mets will go 84-78.

@walder44 OK. But let's try to be more efficient next time. 😀
@walder44 It might. But it very well might not. And therein lies the answer to this entire exchange.
@walder44 No, your question was silly because of course you don't conduct a physical exam based solely on complaints. And you still haven't answered my question: What test in a physical exam confirms migraines if the patient hides the migraines?
@walder44 1) I get an annual physical, and no eye test; 2) The blurred vision wasn't necessarily constant; 3) It's an odd tweet because your question was silly.
@walder44 What an odd tweet. It's a physical exam not altogether different than one that you or I would get. And if you're not complaining of blurred vision, what in that physical would discover something linked to blurred vision?
@walder44 What would they be testing for, without a complaint, in a standard physical exam?
@walder44 You're 100% certain of this? You've conducted physical examinations for professional athletes on behalf of professional teams?
@walder44 Because the player has to say something about it. Tests won't confirm blurred vision if the testee says, "I don't have blurred vision."
@Jhoff10 Oh is it?
@timryderEOI Thanks! The 2016 MRI was on Drury's chart.
@Jhoff10 All indications are the #Dbacks didn't know about it beyond the 2016 MRI, which they disclosed.
@timryderEOI Nope.
@gibzon21 I answered this in a tweet.
Meanwhile, CC Sabathia was still feeling pain in his hip today, Cashman said, so putting him on the DL today was a no-brainer. #Yankees
Drury will get an "entire assessment" on Monday, Cashman said.
To make clear: Drury told the #Yankees this after leaving Friday's game. The #Yankees didn't know of the history prior to Friday. https://t.co/gpqSRUIg86
The #Diamondbacks gave Drury an MRI in 2016, after he complained of migraines, and it came back clean. Last week, when the #Yankees were in Toronto, Drury complained of a headache and was given Excedrin.
Brandon Drury told the #Yankees that he has been dealing with this migraine/blurriness issue for six years, according to GM Brian Cashman.
