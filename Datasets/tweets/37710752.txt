@ConnectMinds Hey gang, check out @ConnectMinds for more Math & Sci info and resources. Go wild.
@ConnectMinds #futureofournation   Until next we chat:  Let's change the world
@Samio_O No. I know dozens of outstanding science teachers, who understand the value of just thinking about something.
@magicjuicebox So far, every scientist I've met is a human. I don't get the gap, unless Snow never learned enough of each, as poss. explan
@CourtneyBale I met a researcher, who is absolutely certain of it. One more thing to be concerned about, especially when you vote.
@STEMAhead Celebrate the Passion, Beauty, & Joy (P,B,&J) of math.
@mattypilz #futureofournation We can't know. Don't be surprised if it's Climate Change is happening even faster than most research predicted
@CVG_MHC #futureofournation   Thanks; I hope you're right. I'd love to make a few more. Let's change the world!
@TheScienceGuy Meant to type that the space missions should be longer. Disappointed they aren't (sic) a little longer.
@ConnectMinds #futureofournation For me Michael Faraday, e.g. the Children's Lectures and, of course, Don Herbert, Mr. Wizard.
@beautyfoodie Drive less & drive less inefficient cars. No car? Bike and public transportation. No kidding.
@DavidLanda They do it all the time. One of the disappointments with the Space Station is that missions are a little longer, like to Mars
@Kubed Uh, I'm not convinced it was bad science. Not convinced either way. I want the Planetary Society to fly 'em in space on last Shuttle
@ConnectMinds The Colony Collapse Disorder apparently can be controlled somewhat by better hive management, more supers, less cold weather
@dreamcatcher37 Would but that they were native. Our honey comes from the European Honeybee, an invader that evolution is just now stressing
@ConnectMinds As, number 33
@DavidLanda Uh, not cyanide... elemental arsenic, As. It apparently can replace phosphorous in certain living celll's DNA. World changing.
@hashtager Check out  @ConnectMinds. I want to hear... er, read from you!
@scicom_bot Throw money at the problem. Physics teachers need to make as much money as engineers, midlevel attorneys. Hard thing to get done
@CVG_MHC #Futureofournation Zoning laws based on the idea that its often cheaper to preserve a wetland than to pave it: flood control costs
@GiftedHF That's a great start. Did you melt some ice at home? Salt in the water? Is the rink outside or in‚Äì or, was the ice soft or hard?
@Wingmnstr If you mean 3D imaging and virtual spaces, what's not to love in any tiny or enormous exploration...
@CourtneyBale If not right now, they absolutely will. If you like to worry about things, start there.
@CourtneyBale Plant trees that are native and well-suited. Require that the trees be replanted as they age and that they don't get cut down.
@CourtneyBale Healthy wetlands generally get thicker rather than erode. However, sealevel rise is trouble for every type of ocean shoreline
@Kubed Provide more, dare I say it, tax breaks to Universities. Reward administrators thru. tax breaks to keep tuitions down.
@ramgarden The US is not as good as it could be, because we don't invest enough. vid games schmid games.
@Wingmnstr Engineers, who find ways to do more with less, especially more heavy lifting and propelling, while using less energy.
@ramgarden @ramgarden Make it more important to everyone, every taxpayer and voter... and those that represent us. The money would flow.
@GiftedHF It is I, who must thank you for support, even after all these years.
@Samio_O Yes.  Absolutely. We humans are much more alike than we are different.
@Samio_O The idea would remain the same: one topic for the whole half hour with 3 fundamentals to get across with passion.
@mamacorin In MHO, the huge opportunity is in elementary education. Inspire people, before they're 10, and we'll change the world.
@GrizzGuy The problem is still the batteries. Gas tanks hold so much energy for their size.  Invent a better battery; get rich!
@ramgarden Great ideas; big needs: Engineers, who like mechanisms & electricity. Fundamentally, we need a government that likes public works
Just a half hour to a Twitterview with me, @ConnectMinds. Write in to the hashtag #Future OfOurNation.  Let's change the world!
