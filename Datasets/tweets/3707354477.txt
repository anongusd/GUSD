@aliciawitty I'm looking forward to coming down!!  I just emailed my uncle before I saw this about my buying my train ticket.  I'm going to spend a day with my aunt &amp; him in NJ after NYC.

@aliciawitty I think you'll like this quote from Dr King, "I have decided to stick with love.  Hate is too great a burden to bear."
@ChrisCuomo @donlemon Dr King once said, "I have decided to stick with love.  Hate is too great a burden to bear."
RT @DrBiden: Uncommon acts of kindness have a transformative power to create change - we all have something to offer. #MLKDay
@BarackObama I love this quote from Dr King, "I have decided to stick with love.  Hate is too great a burden to bear."  I would like to see your Secretary of State, John Kerry, be the next President of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump Martin Luther King once said, "I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear."

@JohnKerry I was just thinking about your former senate colleague &amp; one of my heroes, the late Dale Bumpers.  I am sure you know that his county was the 1st in the south to integrate the schools when he was School Board President.  He never sought recognition.
@aliciawitty @CityVineyardNYC I'll be down.
@JohnKerry @realDonaldTrump Mr Secretary, your strong commitment to fighting global warming is why you should be the next President of the United States.

@aliciawitty @MikeMettler @dawestheband @SoundBard Congratulations!!!!  You absolutely deserved it!!!
@SeaTacAirport @dog_rates @AlaskaAir @SheilaSimonIL I thought you'd like the bow-tied dog.
Great article on the leadership philosophy of John Kerry. https://t.co/6vpOT1Hom2
@aliciawitty Happy New Year!!!
@JohnKerry Your decades long commitment to global warming was another reason why I decided to support you if you run.  I know that as POTUS you would make it a high priority.  I believe that you can defeat Trump.  Happy New Year!!!
@JohnKerry There are lots of great men &amp; women who might run for President.  But I decided today that your are the best person for this moment in history.  Your are correct that global warming can not wait.
Great perspective on Trump from one of my heroes, former VP Walter Mondale,a leader who has witnessed a lot of history. https://t.co/QHzjaWl14A
@senorrinhatch You served in the senate with 2 of my heroes, Sen Bumpers &amp; Sen Simon.  Thank you for your service.
@LesleyRStahl One of the funniest campaign things that I saw (tv) was in 1988 when you were covering the New Hampshire Primary.  Sen Simon shook your hand thinking you were a New Hampshire Voter.
@LindyBooth I do.  How do you remember all of your lines for a show or movie?
@ChrisCuomo You have an excellent show.  You are very fair.  As I watch it, I sometimes think if your dad had been president in the 80s or 90s, there would have the highest standards of ethics.  A very different type of presidency.
@JohnKerry Happy birthday!!!  You would make an excellent President of the United States.  I am undecided who I will support but I like what I've heard from you.  I might support you if you run.
@donlemon Today is John Kerry's 75th birthday!!!
@ChrisCuomo Today is John Kerry's 75th birthday!!!
@aliciawitty Safe travels!!!
@aliciawitty @hallmarkmovie #ChristmasOnHoneySuckleLn The outside of the house in the movie looks like the historic Park McCullough House in North Bennington, VT. https://t.co/K8Dq4qwA69
@JohnKerry I often wonder what Sen Simon would say about Trump if he was alive.
@JohnKerry Today would have been the 90th birthday of your late colleague, Sen Paul Simon.  He is one of my heroes.
@BarackObama Tomorrow would have been Sen Paul Simon's 90th birthday.  I knew Paul.  I often wonder what he would say about Trump if he were alive today.
@ChrisCuomo @donlemon Tomorrow would have been the late Sen Paul Simon's 90th birthday.
@SenatorDurbin Tomorrow would have been Paul Simon's 90th birthday!!! I often wonder what Paul would say about Trump if he were alive today.
@aliciawitty @hallmarkmovie Well done job on the movie!!! :)
@aliciawitty #ChristmasOnHoneysuckleLane I'm enjoying the movie!!!
@espyforsenate Best wishes for you on Tues!!!!  We never met but I was a Congressional Intern for Congressman Bill Lehman when you served in Congress.
@ChrisCuomo I like your show!!!  I've heard you talk about your love for mashed potatoes.  They have something in the freezer section that tastes like mashed potatoes.  Mashed cauliflower.
@Comey I have a question for you.  If you knew how your career as FBI Director would have ended, would you still have accepted the position?
@aliciawitty @hallmarkmovie @colinferg @hallmarkchannel @HomeandFamilyTV I'm planning on watching it &amp; joining you on Twitter.
@aliciawitty Every vote in every election could make a difference.  At the condos where I lived, there was a vote to replace mulch with stone (lots of issues with mulch).  It passed by 1 vote!!!
@aliciawitty @eddiesattic @WalkrStalkrCon Alicia- The cousin of a friend who lives in Atlanta might be there.  She's a high school student who would like to be actress.
Excellent speech &amp; comments by Sen Doug Jones of Alabama. https://t.co/3fnUs5UzDe
@aliciawitty I am sorry for your loss.
@SenatorCollins under oath to the committee.  If I was a Sen (I am a Dem) &amp; a Dem president appointed somebody who had serious ethical/integrity questions about, I would vote against that nominee.
@SenatorCollins I would STRONGLY encourage you to reconsider your vote on the judge.  You liked what he said about precedent.  I am very concerned that the judge may not be telling the truth.  With so many classmates coming forward to say that he lied
@JeffFlake I would STRONGLY encourage you to reconsider your vote on the judge.  I am very concerned that he may have lied to the committee under oath.  With so many classmates coming forward to say that he was not honest.
@Sen_JoeManchin I am very concerned that he is not be trusted.  With all the former classmates coming forward to say that he was not truthful to the committee under oath.
@Sen_JoeManchin I lived in Athens, Ohio for 2 years &amp; took classes at West Virginia	Univ @ Parkersburg.  I STRONGLY encourage you to reconsider your vote.  You said that judge told you he would consider the human factor.
In his acceptance speech at the 1984 Dem Convention, Walter Mondale said,	"By the start of the next decade, I want to look to the Supreme Court &amp; say justice is in good hands."  I do not believe Justice would be in good hands with Brent Kavanaugh.
@JeffFlake Sen Simon I'm sure you'd agree was a Profile in Courage.
@lisamurkowski Sen Simon I'm sure you'd agree was a Profile in Courage.
@SenatorCollins Sen Simon I'm sure you'd agree was a Profile in Courage.
@SenatorDurbin I think you'd agree that Paul Simon was a Profile in Courage.
@SenatorDurbin I have thought of our mutual friend &amp; hero during the confirmation, the late Sen Paul Simon. Just a thought, you could remind your colleagues about Paul, his courage to do &amp; say the right thing when he was in the senate.
@JeffFlake  I have thought of my hero during the confirmation - the late Sen Paul Simon of Illinois.  He did not hesitate to take an unpopular stand if he it was the right thing to do.  I would encourage you continue to follow his great example.
@lisamurkowski  have thought of my hero during the confirmation - the late Sen Paul Simon of Illinois.  He did not hesitate to take an unpopular stand if he it was the right thing to do.  I would encourage you to follow his great example
@SenatorCollins I have thought of my hero during the confirmation - the late Sen Paul Simon of Illinois.  He did not hesitate to take an unpopular stand if he it was the right thing to do.  I would encourage you to follow his great example.
@aliciawitty I have a calendar with quotes for each day.  Today's quote by Bono is "Music can change the world because it can change people."  Even if you find a venue for a concert, I might not be able to come down.  I have a sick cat - stomach flu.

@aliciawitty Just a thought.  How about renting space at a public park?
@aliciawitty I might come down if I can work it in my schedule.
@SenGillibrand How fitting that today would have been Geraldine Ferraro's 83rd birthday.
@aliciawitty It was that thinking that helped Paul get along well with colleagues whom he disagreed with.
@aliciawitty John McCain was a wonderful man with many admirable qualities. One of them was working across the aisle. I think of the words of one of my heroes, the late Sen Paul Simon of Illinois. Sen Simon said that we all want a better America but we have a different way to achieve it.
@aliciawitty A while back, a wikipedia article said that a current Member of the Vermont State Legislature was born &amp; died in the 1600s.  It's since been corrected.
@JoeSchiavoni @StephanieDodd @clevstondems @CivicCleveland @ClevelandACTS @indivisible_cle @IndivisibleHts @TheCityClub @CuyahogaDems @RefuseOfCuyahog @CuyahogaDWC @neoybd I was an undecided voter.  For the last week, I was leaning your way.  Today I decided to support you.  I believe that you're the best candidate for the job.  Tomorrow I'll be voting for you in Athens.
@ChrisCuomo https://t.co/1vqMERP3Zx
@POTUS I call on President Trump to select former Georgia Senator Max Clelland for Veterans Secretary.  Sen Cleland ran the agency during the Carter Administration.
@JosephCalifano I have a historical question from your years during the LBJ Administration.  Why didn't LBJ do medicare for all not just your seniors?  My 2nd cousin, Harry, is married to your niece.
My friend, Congressman Rick Nolan, is retiring. https://t.co/jg8nKMUAyH	Thanks for 6 great years of service!!!
@aliciawitty How do I purchase tickets for your concert in Nashville on the 24th?  I followed the links but nothing came  up where I could buy a ticket.  Thanks!!!
@aliciawitty I have a quote calendar on my desk.  That is similar to my Monday quote, "It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiosly that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case you live by default," J K Rowling
@aliciawitty @Fly_Nashville @wahtsinaname @aliciawitty I once left my keys at a motel in LA.  They overnited them to me.  My mom &amp; dad were following me in their car to a hotel in St Paul.  She got the highway number &amp; exit number mixed up.  She exited 1 hr later in rural Wisconsin. lol
Let's come together.  As the late NY Gov Mario Cuomo told us 33 years ago, we are the family of America.  @NYGovCuomo
My heart &amp; prayers goes out to Nevada &amp; Puerto Rico.  There is far too much division in our great nation.
