@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton My last point....The hypocrisy in this narrative that an ally to the US in an Australian diplomat who tipped off the FBI that a Trump campaign official bragged about committing a conspiracy against the United States Of America with a known adversary in the Russians. /11
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton There are other wild rumors out in the MSM that have not been substantiated or confirmed but I decided to stick with just the facts. Even the facts make you wonder and scratch your head just a bit whether you are in the left or the right./10
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton -Trump has not instructed the FBI, NSA, or CIA to use offensive measures to combat Russian meddling or destroy their cyber capabilities in 2018 or 2020 elections. Something only the president can authorize /9
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton -If North Korea or Iran played a video bombing Florida or any other US state or territory I am certain he would tweet about it at the very least. /8
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton -Putin recently showed a video of nuclear warheads bombing the state of Florida.		-Trump can criticize and condemn comments and actions of SNL Mr. Baldwin LaVar Ball John McCain Jeff Flake Jeff Sessions etc. but not Putin for threatening the USA directly. /7
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton -Trump blames Obama for not acting against the Russians(kind of true but not really) but as sitting president he has not done anything either.... Obama closed the Russian embassy and expelled 35 Russian diplomats before he handed the keys to Trump /6
@DevinNunes @HillaryClinton -Donald Trump has not said one bad word about Putin		-Donald Trump has not implemented sanctions Congress passed overwhelmingly in August of 2016		-Trump‚Äôs State Department has $0  of the 120 million Congress allotted to fight Russian meddling of future elections /5
@DevinNunes -FBI did not let American public know that Trump Campaign was under investigation during 2016 Election.		-FBI did let American public know 11 days before election that investigation was being reopened against @HillaryClinton as it relates to her emails. /4
@DevinNunes The ultimate question is this. How can a true American Patriot be so disingenuous and avoid the fundamental premise that the current president, who is sitting in the oval may be a Manchurian candidate. Let‚Äôs look at some facts. /3
@DevinNunes It goes without saying that #Trump has given to The Clinton Foundation and other Clinton political interest also, but I digress. /2
