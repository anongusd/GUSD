"Snowmageddon"?!  What's the matter?  Life in DC too cold for ya?
Just watched my double cuz give a speech.  She was great.
These cookie cutter outsourced call centers are the pits.  It was so much better when we could just call and get what needed without fluff.
Please.  I don't care that you're happy to assist me.  Stop repeating what my call is in reference to. Just tell me what my balance is.
You asked for our comment, I simply will render: My country 'tis of thy people you're dying. ~ Buffy Sainte-Marie ~
Stop enabling the Hispanics, and stop asking others if they are of that ancestry.  there are other people here, too.
Take all of the other languages off the website, please http://2010.census.gov/2010census/index.php
If I see anything other than English on the census report, you can forget that my son and I exist.  THIS IS AMERICA.  SPEAK ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!
Employers who discriminate against potential new hires because of credit scores are wrong.  this practice needs to be stopped PRONTO!

@foxandfriends Phil's right, though.  Spring doesn't start until March 21st.
It's true - the IVR option of inclement weather/natural disaster records as natural disaster, so managers don't accept if for anything else.
Now, if they'll just fix the IVR so Managers will stop telling employees that snow does not fall under the inclement weather option.
My ex was dancing today.  Walmart told him he will be forgiven for the snow day back in December, and not to worry about Friday's either.
In Wisconsin, you must manually flush all urinals in a building. Does that mean that guys have to put the seats down, too?
In New York, a license must be purchased before hanging clothes on a clothesline. So, that's why we have apartments with no hook-ups, huh?
In Nebraska, it is illegal for bar owners to sell beer unless they are simultaneously brewing a kettle of soup.
What?  No milk or soda can be sold in Indiana liquor stores!  Why not?
Kansas prohibits shooting rabbits from a motorboat. I didn't know that those wascally wabbits could swim.
In Florida, it is illegal to sing in a public place while attired in a swimsuit.
@gretawire When coffee got that expensive, too?
In California, animals are banned from mating publicly within 1,500 feet of a tavern, school, or place of worship. Are they registered, too?
In Alabama, It is illegal to wear a fake mustache that causes laughter in church.
@virginiafoxx I am your constituent.  I'm glad your talk was great.
@pwire I'm just looking for a job - Period!
Mall to Christians: God talk banned! http://bit.ly/ay8JHm via @AddToAny

@TheOnion Now, that is funny.  Thanks for the laugh.  When I get a bike, I'll lock my it in a corner, too (it was stolen off a bike rack).
@RasmussenPoll Wow!  I am in the majority on this one, and I didn't even take the poll.
Walmart should be ashamed of itself for its total lack of regard for its employees.  Their safety is more important than a night's profits.
Do not penalize folks who cannot make it to work due to inclement weather.
Yes, shelves need to be stocked, but not during a snowstorm.  When roads are bad, ask those who are already there to stay for overtime.
Who in their right mind NEEDS butter, a toaster, or worse yet, a PLASMA SCREEEN TV in the middle of the night during a snowstorm?
My ex was written up for calling when the roads were bad because it was snowing.  Shame on Walmart!
No store - Walmart, KMart, Target, Joe Smoe's should stay open when it's snowing & reports say to stay home.
Walmart thinks it's safe for their employees to drive on icy roads during a snowstorm.  I DO NOT NEED TO BUY ANYTHING WHEN ROADS ARE BAD!!!!
Just about 7" fell last night, but there has been rain, too.  It is snowing again.
I believe in human beings, and that all human beings should be respected as such, regardless of their color. ~ Malcolm X
If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all. ~ Noam Chomsky
The greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself. ~ Saul Alinsky
Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputations... can never effect a reform. ~ Susan B. Anthony
I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen. ~ Rosa Parks
Quakers almost as good as colored. They call themselves friends & you can trust them every time. ~ Harriet Tubman
If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? ~ Gloria Steinem
Truth is powerful and it prevails. ~ Sojourner Truth
Social advance depends as much upon the process through which it is secured as upon the result itself.	Jane Addams
"When you put your hand to the plow, you can't put it down until you get to the end of the row. " ~ Alice Paul
Please remove Spanish from TV, signs, pamphlets, etc.
There are 321 languages spoken in the US, but English is the preferred.  Stop enabling the Hispanics & allow them to assimilate, please.
Alice Paul was a cousin of mine (my niece looks just like her, too).  I'd like to see the ERA completed before 2023, please.
