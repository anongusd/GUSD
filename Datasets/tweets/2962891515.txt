If President Trump needs to declare a #NationalEmergency to keep out the drugs and gangs, so be it because it's pretty clear that Democrats' only goal is to score political points with their radical open-borders base, even if it means sacrificing national security. #LA05

President Trump is an expert negotiator who keeps his cards close. I am confident the United States will be as successful in confronting Russian aggression as we have been in negotiations with other foreign leaders.
The Left still cannot get over the fact that Donald Trump is the President, and that’s why they’re desperate to keep pushing this bogus collusion narrative (even while they turned a blind eye to Obama’s weakness that allowed Russia to invade Crimea).
It is known that the Russians have always tried to meddle in American affairs, but nothing they did affected the outcome of the last presidential race. They didn’t change a single vote, and President Trump won in a landslide.

The House should focus on winning enough votes to pass the original Goodlatte-McCaul bill that accomplished everything that we as conservatives want: building a border wall, cracking down on sanctuary cities, ending the visa lottery system, and stopping chain migration. #LA05
My constituents have been clear: No amnesty for illegal immigrants. My no vote today reflected my commitment to them that I will never support amnesty. The bill included some good things but went too far in granting amnesty for about 2M people who came into this country illegally

Democrats want to tank the #2018FarmBill - risking certainty and stability for our farmers - because we're instituting work requirements for SNAP. Work requirements/job training aren't just GOP priorities; they're what an overwhelming amount of Americans are calling for. #LA05 https://t.co/IX27rhuHEP
The #FarmBill is the result of years of work. It will be better for the farmer and better for the American people. Today, we'll pass it out of the @HouseAgNews Committee. Here's a story from @TWILATV about how important this bill is to our young farmers and ranchers. #LA05 https://t.co/2ds8SNZzCL

President Trump is considering a veto of the omnibus &amp; I hope he does veto it. Republicans should be using our majorities to have an open debate and write these spending bills to reflect our priorities - the military, the border wall, rooting out waste. #la05
(2/2) rather than focusing on the money our military and border security need. Dropping a $1.3 trillion spending bill - one that breaks a deal we struck just last month - hours before it needs to pass is an irresponsible way to govern, and that’s why I voted against it.
(1/2) This 2,200 page omnibus dropped less than a day before we voted on it, and no one could possibly have read it all in that amount of time. I do know enough to see that it breaks budget compromise we struck last month by tacking on billions in extra spending on pet projects,
