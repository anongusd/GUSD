Republicans are blocking the military's paychecks explicitly, in order to pressure people into making decisions on a budget that has a lot of discussion still to happen.
McCaskill-D: [I ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the intermediate consideration that the amendment at the desk providing for continuing appropriations for pay and death benefits be agreed to with no intervening action or debate.]
McConnell-R: [I object. My Hope is that we can restore funding for the entire government before this becomes necessary. I'm going to object for tonight but we'll discuss again tomorrow. Therefore I object.]		Time mark 14:16:50		https://t.co/A5hM0m19yz
On the floor after the main vote the Democrats asked to continue pay for all members of the armed services as well as death benefits without intervening action or debate (aka, no strings "just do it") and McConnell blocked it. 	#TrumpShutdown #GOPShutdown
