@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein When the Sunrise folks posted that video with a negative framing in the tweet, they were disrespecting you, maybe not on purpose, but it is always disrespectful to manipulate people.		They could have said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre concerned by this. What do you think?‚Äù
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein A life lesson for whoever might be interested:		Always beware when people tell you what you should think.		If you see, ‚ÄúLook at this horrible thing, (X)!‚Äù		Before you even look at (X), be -mindful- that someone was trying to bias your view before you could form your own opinion.
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein She didn‚Äôt just point her in the right direction. She told the aids to give her the internship-granting the request.		As for your characterization &amp; conclusions, all I can say is that I saw it differently than you.

This is the sort of exactitude our lawmakers must have, both to craft the laws we live by &amp; to deal with those who try to move us only by force of will.
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Your objection to the voting comment missed out on something, IMHO.		In a partisan world, sloppy definitions &amp; muzzy reasoning are often used to bamboozle listeners. To survive in that environment, one must be scrupulously exact in discourse.

@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick You overestimate your power to wound.		Your conduct destroys any claim to credibility.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Your conduct is that of a troll.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick You are smearing people indiscriminately. No justice there. 		Each time a person spews outrageous bile without regard to reality, they merely destroy their own credibility.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick You‚Äôre choosing to behave like a troll. Perhaps you are one.		Goodbye.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick You‚Äôre choosing to behave like a troll. Perhaps you are one.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick You‚Äôre choosing to behave like a troll. Perhaps you are one.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Context is good.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Okay.		I gave you the benefit of the doubt, but now you‚Äôre just indulging in trollish behavior.		You‚Äôre hurting the cause you claim to care about by launching unjust attacks based on a manipulatively edited video.		Bye.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick The resolution as written was unworkable. There‚Äôs been a lot written on the particulars, but it‚Äôs waaay past my bedtime so I‚Äôll let you do your own searches, if you‚Äôre interested.	Did you want DiFi to lie to the kids &amp; say she‚Äôd support something that wouldn‚Äôt work? She‚Äôs honest.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick It‚Äôs not blind allegiance. (And your sneering has grown quite tiresome.)		I‚Äôm a California boomer &amp; have followed Dianne Feinstein‚Äôs career for decades. She‚Äôs the real deal-a public servant who is motivated first &amp; foremost by the public good.		She‚Äôs earned my respect, &amp; my vote.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I reject your ad hominem attack on her.		If you are genuinely trying to help the cause, then I feel sorry for your inability to recognize &amp; value an ally.		If you are a troll simply trying to stir up discontent &amp; division, then you‚Äôre doing an excellent job.		Proud of yourself?üïä
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick She tried to explain to them, but they weren‚Äôt processing what she was saying &amp; kept repeating their unrealistic demands.		There were people with appointments waiting to see her.		DiFi was as gracious as she ‚Ä¢could‚Ä¢ be, but she held her ground &amp; wouldn‚Äôt lie to them.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Did you watch the entire 6-part video?		She was extremely patient with people who were being unreasonable &amp; demanding. I saw no condescension at all.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Feinstein ‚Ä¢wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¢ dishing out any BS.	She tried to tell them the GND wouldn‚Äôt fly. She asked them to read her bill &amp; asked them for feedback.		She tried to bring them into the process. They had set themselves up with an unworkable goal &amp; were disappointed-&amp; quite unfair to DF.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I can understand the young children not knowing any better, but the older ones &amp; adults could have/should have thought this through. They set themselves up for disappointment, &amp; unlike DJT, DiFi doesn‚Äôt pander to her constituents. She‚Äôs ‚Ä¢honest‚Ä¢ &amp; that‚Äôs a good thing.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I‚Äôve watched the entire 6-part video. She was extremely patient. She acknowledged &amp; valued their passion, but stood her ground on the facts. She tried to explain, but they didn‚Äôt process what she was saying &amp; kept repeating their talking points. Their demands were unrealistic.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Well, we see things differently, then.		I see nothing to gain in attacking people who are on your own side.		We get things done by working together, supporting each other.		üåäüá∫üá∏üóΩüïä
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Sabotage? SMH.		Putin wants us destroying each other. His minions are doing everything they can to prod us into conflict.		We can‚Äôt win by giving our enemy exactly what he wants. We have to fix what‚Äôs wrong, do right, get back on track, unite against our real foes, and heal.	üá∫üá∏üïä
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick But if we want to move something more before then, Dianne Feinstein is not the one obstructing progress. The GOP are the primary obstruction, along with fossil fuel influence money. Putting pressure on DiFi accomplishes nothing-give her an environment where she can do more.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Right now the GOP hold the Senate &amp; the White House. That‚Äôs the reality we have to face. Dianne Feinstein is in the Senate. The ‚Ä¢ONLY‚Ä¢ way she can move anything forward is with GOP votes. It‚Äôs that or ‚Ä¢nothing‚Ä¢ until January 2021, assuming we take the Sen &amp; WH in 2020.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick We get the government we deserve. For too long we were collectively apathetic, &amp; now we have to roll up our sleeves &amp; shoulder some responsibility. They‚Äôre trying to goad us into turning on each other. Don‚Äôt give ‚Äòem the satisfaction. Choose your targets carefully &amp; let‚Äôs roll.üåä
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick So instead of making unjust accusations against public servants who are doing their best in a bad situation, why don‚Äôt we ask ourselves what we can do to help.	Help our candidates, put pressure on the opposition, &amp; expose the dark money forces exploiting the situation for gain.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Last thing-for those who complain about Dems who accept fossil fuel industry üí∞, remember that they wouldn‚Äôt have to if we supported them. Our Dem candidates have to compete against GOP war chests. Many candidates have pledged not to accept oil üí∞, but now aren‚Äôt raising enough.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick As long as the GOP keeps ‚ÄúDrill, baby, drill!‚Äù as their mantra, ‚Ä¢and‚Ä¢ they stay in power, Dems in the minority struggle to get anything done. Don‚Äôt blame DiFi for working out a deal that can pass in a GOP-held Senate. She‚Äôs working hard to move anything in the right direction.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Disagree. It‚Äôs up to us voters to ditch our collective apathy &amp; support candidates who‚Äôll do something about climate change. Not enough of us supported Al Gore in 2000. Not enough Dems voted to keep a majority in Congress for Obama.

@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist I have to speak of all of this in the past tense tho‚Äô, because we‚Äôre getting a new system in 2020.

@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist Both the regular &amp; audio ballots would be read by optical scanners back at the registrar‚Äôs office, so info wasn‚Äôt being transmitted electronically from the polling place to any central location. Nothing to hack there.
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist When a voter was finished using the ABB, it would print out a ballot with the numbered bubbles filled out, according to the voter‚Äôs selections. The voter could compare the finished ballot to their sample ballot to verify, so hacking really wasn‚Äôt an issue.
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist The audio ballot booth (ABB) allowed a voter to put on headphones &amp; listen to the entire ballot being read (in 10 languages in 2018) and they could punch buttons to select (or de-select), repeat, move forward or backward.

@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist Vision-impaired voters can find it difficult to fill out paper ballots.	People with severe arthritis, or amputees can also have difficulty.	(And people with poor literacy skills like to use audio ballot machines to listen to the selections, instead.)
@Irish_Atheist Some current voting machines either produce a barcode which the voter can only assume reflects their choices, or others tally the votes electronically with no way to verify or recount.
@Irish_Atheist Yes, but the electronic voting machine can be made to produce a paper ballot that is readable by human eyes, as opposed to a barcode. In Los Angeles County, our audio ballot booths do exactly that. You mark the ballot by punching buttons &amp; it prints out a marked paper ballot.

@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch After the election, employees of the Registrar‚Äôs Office take each envelope, verify the voter is really a registered voter, verify that they didn‚Äôt already cast a ballot at another polling place nor send in a mail-in ballot, &amp; verify the signature on the envelope matches records/3
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch Each completed provisional ballot is sealed in an envelope where the voter filled out their info-name, addy, date &amp; place of birth, if naturalized citizen they put that info down, etc. They sign the envelope. (We don‚Äôt hand ‚Äòem a ballot till they‚Äôve filled out all the info.) /2
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch Agree. I‚Äôm a pollworker in Los Angeles County. Anyone who shows up at a polling place is allowed to cast a ballot-a regular ballot if ‚Ä¢on our voter roster‚Ä¢, or provisional if not. During 30-day post-election canvas, registrar checks provisionals. /1
@stormchaser4x4 @JudicialWatch I‚Äôve been a pollworker in Los Angeles County for years. 	Your assertions are utter nonsense.
@FDG65 @JudicialWatch I live in Rep Waters‚Äôs district &amp; am a pollworker. The roster of registr‚Äôd voters at each polling place has always displayed a status code of who‚Äôs an active voter, inactive, or newly-registered. Proper procedures for each have changed over the years, but  your sneers are unjust.

Our society has reached a point where access to such videos could reach a large percentage of the population. Isn‚Äôt it time we adapt our campaigns to make use of that technology?
Such vids could also serve to humanize our Democratic candidates in the eyes of GOP supporters who have been deluded into viewing Dems through a ‚Äúdemon-colored‚Äù lens.
The candidates can send the link out &amp; Americans across the country could observe ‚Ä¢what‚Ä¢ they have to say, the ‚Ä¢reasons‚Ä¢ they give for saying it, and how each of them treat one another.	A series of these vids would be more enlightening than some stilted debates.
I‚Äôd love to see our leading candidates sit down together to ‚Ä¢discuss‚Ä¢ the issues before us. Spend an hour or more having a kitchen table talk on topic x, post it on YouTube or wherever.
After these recent years of hyper-divisiveness, one of the characteristics we desperately need is the ability to be civil with our opponents, to engage them in substantive discussion, &amp; to heal our divided nation.
Yes, we need to understand the differences between the candidates to decide which one we prefer, but do we ‚Ä¢really‚Ä¢ have to go into snipe/attack mode to do that?
With both foreign &amp; domestic actors seeking to exploit divisions within our country &amp; within our party, I dread the inevitable tussle of the upcoming Democratic primary race.
According to Ballotpedia, there are (as of Feb 7, 2019) 172 Democratic candidates for president in 2020.

@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams In reasoned discourse, people show each other respect. They are willing to discuss the details &amp; subtleties of a topic with the goal of reaching some mutually accepted conclusion, or else an agreement to disagree.	Constant peppering of potshots to distract &amp; confuse isn‚Äôt worthy.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams The troll‚Äôs purpose is to create an environment so toxic that their chosen target will either get fed up &amp; leave social media, or at least will lapse into silence to escape further attack, either way ceding ground to the troll. 	It‚Äôs not about the topic, it‚Äôs about domination.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams All these insulting &amp; manipulative ploys mean, of course, is that the troll isn‚Äôt trying to change the mind of their target. (If you‚Äôre trying to convince someone to see things your way, bombarding them with contempt is a poor way to do it).
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams The trolling attack-attack-attack approach is, of course, a way both to dominate &amp; to direct discourse-keep discourse on the troll‚Äôs ‚Ä¢chosen topics‚Ä¢, keep the target trying to earn the troll‚Äôs concurrence, which they‚Äôll never give no matter who‚Äôs in the right.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Another trolling tactic is to assault with many topics/accusations/sneers, to maneuver the target into defending on many fronts, or else ‚Äúlose the argument.‚Äù (Such word-assaults are not reasoned argument).
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Another trolling tactic is simple whataboutism- to name any topic, especially an emotionally charged one, phrase it as sneeringly as possible, &amp; drop it, not even bothering to frame an argument. Adding lots of references to excrement makes it even more vivid.
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens I‚Äôm not familiar with any Chinese prom dress, but I don‚Äôt really have to explain that Beto‚Äôs hometown of El Paso has a significant Spanish-speaking population &amp; a kid growing up there...		I get the feeling you‚Äôre just looking for excuses to jab at the left.		Enjoy your day.üïä
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens It makes no difference. üïä	https://t.co/1nHAqOqS0k
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams One trolling tactic is to select a true fact, but take it out of context. For example, stating California has the highest homeless population in the US, (sneer), while ignoring CA also has the highest population-period. Nearly 12% of US pop is in Cali.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams You‚Äôve forked this thread so badly, I hardly know where to post my response, but perhaps that was intentional?

@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell Another agent interrupted just then, and we never did get to ask what happened with they guy who killed his wife.  Been wondering about that ever since.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell So, the agent explained to us, it doesn't matter what crime they're investigating, or what they expect to find.  They come in with force, ready to deal with anything.  Normal practice, so he told us.	When you look at it that way, it makes sense.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell He grabbed a tool off his workbench &amp; grabbed a fellow employee from the next workstation and started screaming he'd kill the guy unless the agents backed off.  The agents had come for records, not expecting any trouble, &amp; suddenly were faced with a hostage situation.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell So there he was, working at his station, playing it cool, when suddenly he looks up to see a bunch of FBI agents walking in.  He jumped to the conclusion they had come there for him.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell They weren't expecting any trouble. To get to the office, they had to walk thru the machine shop, but what none of them knew was one of the mechanics there had murdered his wife the night before.  Her body was at home, &amp; he'd gone in to work the next day as if nothing was wrong.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell "Hey dude, what's with the guns? Did you think we were gonna get into a shoot-out over the timecards?"	The agent smiled, and told us a little story.  Some years previously, FBI agents were working a case of alleged fraudulent billing &amp; went to a company to seize records.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell This is pretty intimidating.  We were stunned, eyes wide, and we complied.  After they'd secured the area, they put their guns away and we helped them find the timecards and labor records they wanted. After a while, one of my co-workers got up the nerve to ask one of the agents,
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell Years ago, I worked for a company that got raided by the FBI.  We had some gov't contracts, &amp; an employee who'd been fired -for cause- decided to get revenge by claiming misdeeds with labor charging.  (Nothing came of it). The FBI agents came in with guns drawn...

@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel Watergate &amp; Ford‚Äôs pardon of Nixon devastated the GOP‚Äôs reputation with the electorate. When they had to plot their path back to lasting power, creating the conditions for a compliant media (or propaganda outlets, if you prefer) was put high on their To Do list.
@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel I agree well enough with what you‚Äôre saying, but just want to be clear that the goddess Minerva (Rush, Fox, etc) didn‚Äôt spring fully formed out of Reagan‚Äôs forehead.
@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel During Watergate, Nixon was angry about his press coverage &amp; insisted there ‚Ä¢should be‚Ä¢ press outlets that would be friendly to him to put out his message the way he wanted it to be framed, so, though it took a while, I‚Äôd say Nixon‚Äôs administration was an inflection point.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB üòÑ	I was just reacting to the idea that you seemed to hold it against KH that she accepted DJT‚Äôs donation, when I find it entirely plausible that she didn‚Äôt know (then) what a sleazeball he was.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Beyond that, I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. Some people were more aware of him than others, with folks in NYC likely having the greatest awareness.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I presumed you deliberately chose that article from the Guardian to show there was international interest.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB In the article you linked, it says Salaam, who was 15 at the time, didn‚Äôt know who Trump was, when Trump was calling for their execution. I don‚Äôt know if he was a native New Yorker. Of course, that article in the Guardian was a closer look at ‚Ä¢candidate‚Ä¢ Trump, in 2016.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Sure, people had heard the name. I was vaguely aware he‚Äôd tried to buy the old Ambassador Hotel (fell thru), &amp; something about a golf course in Palos Verdes. Heard sth about divorces &amp; a casino. But details about his character? Nope. Wasn‚Äôt on the radar for lots of people.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB It‚Äôs not realistic to expect lifelong Californians to be have the same awareness of New York characters as you do yourself. We have our own characters. ü§™
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB You say you didn‚Äôt need the media to tell you DJT was vile &amp; morally bankrupt. The point was-you knew who he was. Your bio says you‚Äôre in NYC, &amp; I acknowledged already that New Yorkers were aware of him. Takei‚Äôs been quoted saying he didn‚Äôt really know who DJT was. I didn‚Äôt-then.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB These are her values. To doubt that based on those contributions requires ignoring the context I described upthread.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB As she‚Äôs ascended to more powerful positions, she‚Äôs consistently followed that path-working to make things better for the ones the system has failed. And when mistakes are made, she‚Äôs quick to own up &amp; accept responsibility.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I disagree on conflating. When KH became a lawyer, family &amp; friends expected she‚Äôd be a defense atty to fight back against the system. She said no, you‚Äôve got to be on the ‚Ä¢inside‚Ä¢ to make changes. She worked hard &amp; used her power to shift the juggernaut to a new course.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I don‚Äôt have much, but I signed up for a small monthly contribution. The more of us who do that willingly, the less time she has to waste on fundraising. You decide for you. 	As for me, I‚Äôm in. 	üá∫üá∏üåäüïä
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB By pledging off Corp üí∞, she‚Äôs made herself vulnerable vs candidates who take that cash. She‚Äôs not making a cynical pledge. She‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your back if you‚Äôve got mine.‚Äù She‚Äôs putting her trust in ‚Ä¢us‚Ä¢ as an act of faith.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Also, I keep coming back to ‚Ä¢us.‚Ä¢ Citizens United wrought havoc. Dark money must be dealt with, but to do that, we‚Äôve got to put our own candidates in position to take action, &amp; speaking for myself, I see that in Kamala Harris.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB And where Trump‚Äôs concerned, nobody had a crystal ball. New Yorkers say they‚Äôve known for years he was a con, but this is Cali. Trump was ‚Äúthat TV Guy.‚Äù Heck, even George Takei was on his show in 2012. Times have changed, context is important.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Also, I have a question I don‚Äôt know the answer to. Did these Corps &amp; Trump donate to Kamala ‚Ä¢only‚Ä¢, or did they also donate to her opponents? Many times they play both sides as an insurance policy. Failure to accept that money would only have put her at a disadvantage.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB If her ‚Ä¢opponents‚Ä¢ had pledged off Corp money when she hadn‚Äôt, then the criticism would be fair. That‚Äôs not the case here.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Kamala began as an unknown when she ran for DA in SF, &amp; made a name for herself locally. Then for Cali AG she had to make her name known statewide. It took time to build her brand &amp; get ordinary folks excited. Once she had that support base, she pledged off Corp money.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I get what you‚Äôre saying, but again, context is important. California is a huge state geographically, with very expensive media markets. Vermont...not so much. Clearly, when running for statewide office, a Cali candidate needs way more cash.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB The bigger the office, the more campaign money you need. I don‚Äôt know which of these donors were courted by the candidate, or which ones were courting her. I don‚Äôt know whose contributions she refused to accept. Do you?
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB We can clutch our pearls &amp; decry politicians accepting money from moneyed interests, but if we just plain folks weren‚Äôt bothering to fund candidates, they had little choice. Without campaign money, they‚Äôd lose. Period.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Until recently, most ordinary Americans didn‚Äôt pay much attention to politics, and fewer bothered sending campaign contributions. So, most politicians in office spent a portion of their time regularly courting ‚Ä¢interested parties‚Ä¢ to plead for funds. Sad fact, but universal.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Next, simple deduction.	Imagine you‚Äôre a candidate for office, you‚Äôre not well-known, &amp; you‚Äôre not wealthy. You have to raise enough campaign funds to be competitive. If your opponents raise big $$$ for their war chests, you have to as well, otherwise you‚Äôre out of the race.

@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I do know you‚Äôve posted ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that are blatantly false, used cheap manipulative tactics, &amp; presented rudimentary arguments that are obvious  logical fallacies.		Nothing you‚Äôve posted on ‚Ä¢this thread‚Ä¢ is worthy of anyone‚Äôs regard.		Do better.  Be better.		üíîüóΩüåäüá∫üá∏üïä
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a troll working for Putin. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a troll working for the GOP. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a sincere American who‚Äôs drunk too much GOP kool-aid &amp; has been suckered into their groupthink, emulating the troll tactics you see around you.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I ‚Ä¢have‚Ä¢ studied logic, and I encourage everyone else to. I‚Äôm unmoved by false, manipulative nonsense. A great portion of the smears I see are ludicrously juvenile.		‚Äú(Name target), really?‚Äù		Am I supposed to be lost to doubt from that? Really? https://t.co/SYNiUTepwW
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers The troll assumes the position of the arbiter of truth, &amp; pretends that if their target cannot adequately disprove a claim to the troll‚Äôs satisfaction (i.e. never), then the target is obligated to accept the troll‚Äôs version. Pure malevolent manipulation.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Another manipulative tactic is to assault the target with myriad false claims, challenging them to prove otherwise. If they start to respond to one, the troll bombards them using any excuse. ‚ÄúOh, I notice you didn‚Äôt address this other claim! Oh, MSM is all lies!...‚Äù
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers We should all be mindful of such tactics so we can withstand them, and oppose them.	If you are, yourself, a sincere American with conservative views trying to persuade others, look for honest facts &amp; reasonable arguments. No more sneers, insinuations, falsehoods or fallacies.	üïä
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers It‚Äôs pure psychological warfare to unleash armies of bots/trolls pushing such positions to overwhelm folks until they join what ‚Ä¢appears‚Ä¢ to be the dominant pack, or are discouraged into silence, leaving the field to the trolls.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I don‚Äôt believe all GOP-leaning trolls are Russian, but I‚Äôm keenly aware they do exist &amp; are working hard to amplify divisions. One tactic is to create a flood of posts all agreeing with each other, hoping that undecided/uninformed or insecure folks will feel inclined to join in.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Another logical fallacy is the argument ad hominem. Ignoring reasoning altogether &amp; just launching attacks against one‚Äôs opponent. Mudslinging smear campaigns abound &amp; you‚Äôre throwing mud around yourself. I‚Äôm not impressed.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers When people challenge me with obviously false arguments, I‚Äôm left to wonder about them. Are they sincere, but na√Øve? Unaware of the flaw in their reasoning? Are they deliberately deceptive &amp; manipulative? Bad faith actors working for their own selfish cause? Or somewhere between?
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers We can see the same false argument with DJT‚Äôs wall. The GOP claims you‚Äôre either for the wall, or else you‚Äôre for open borders. Either black or white. It‚Äôs false &amp; insulting &amp; no one should be fooled by it.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers You posited, ‚Äúabortion at full term, really?‚Äù	That‚Äôs one extreme. The other extreme is ‚Äúfrom the moment of conception.‚Äù	There‚Äôs a whole world of shades of gray in the middle which is where reality lies.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Have you ever heard of the black &amp; white fallacy? Arguments that posit there‚Äôs a position at ‚Ä¢this‚Ä¢ extreme, &amp; a position at ‚Ä¢that‚Ä¢ extreme &amp; dismiss or refuse to acknowledge anything in the middle. When it‚Äôs black or white &amp; no shades of gray, it‚Äôs a false argument.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Have you ever studied logic? (Honest question.) Some arguments can be easily identified as false by their very structure. When I listen to ‚Äúnews‚Äù from the right, or to GOP politicians, I hear a litany of false arguments, manipulative smears, &amp; lies that are easily fact-checked.

But in cabinet meeting 2 days ago, DJT suddenly brought it up-Russ was right to invade ‚Äòcuz of terrorist attacks. Parroting Putin.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom You can imagine Putin saying, ‚ÄúHey Donald, Don‚Äôt let those awful Montenegrins join NATO. They‚Äôre horrible, aggressive. They‚Äôll start WW3!‚Äù Donny hears, he says, he shoves.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Coup failed, link to Russ GRU found. Montenegro did join NATO, &amp; at meeting, DJT did a weird thing &amp; physically shoved the Montenegrin Prime Minister aside‚Äîthe guy Putin tried to have murdered.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Russ GRU tried to arrange a coup in Montenegro, only foiled ‚Äòcuz one of the local plotters got cold feet &amp; turned himself in. They would have kidnapped or killed the Prime Minister, &amp; stopped Montenegro from joining NATO.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Trump gave an interview where he suddenly started talking about how the Montenegrin people were strong &amp; aggressive, &amp; next thing you know, they‚Äôd start WW3. Off-the-chart weird at the time. But Montenegro wanted to join NATO, &amp; Putin wanted to stop them.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom No, not history. Russ propaganda.	Putin spread misinfo in Belarus that Poland was going to attack, to get Belarus to move closer to Russia, politically.

@JCGrant7984 @VictorKilbourn @jmcauliff1 @realDonaldTrump Any estimate you see, drill down &amp; find out what assumptions it made.
