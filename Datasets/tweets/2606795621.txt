@atomicnerdbear1 @MissLynette13 She'll probly end up w viles of spores lol
@carmenluysa @Africanpatriott @SecPompeo @jguaido @smartmatic The only reason the US is intervening is bc of vast gold and oil reserves. Does Venezuela actually pose a threat to the US? No! If they did we would be invading half of the world's countries. As a citizen I'm more concerned about Colombia, China, and the Mexican cartels!
@nicobolivar91 @SecPompeo @jguaido Yeah, except for the fact that the people that live there actually don't want US intervention. They elected Maduro by a landslide. This Juan guy came from where? Maybe you can teach me something? Or maybe the fake stream media will keep up their efforts to program you?

@LaCourelle @NatyNicholls @DungivenSOM @marcorubio The real reason they were protesting bc they dont want American interference. They dont want one leader they elected and one leader, who happens to be a freemason, that the US just thru in there and decided out of nowhere to recognize as their leader.

@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trust me I dont live in a shell. I was raised in the hood and seen some shit you would never imagine. I've seen friends die from heroin and I see friends that are touring the world. It's all about your life choices, but govt shouldn't tell you what you can and cannot do.
@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I see where you're coming from. You could argue that weed is a gateway drug, but nobody starts out with coke or meth. Nicotine and alchohol could also be a "gateway"; they also prime the brain for unnatural dopamine. I wonder how many pot smokers actually graduate to harder drugs
@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Actually, I dont know the exact stats but, most drugs are brought in by sea.. or produced right in your neighborhoods.
@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I dont need to go to a drug rehab center. I'm not an addict. I said I've experimented; cuz I dont live in a fucking shell. Live a little, or just be a stuck up ass hole. Weed is safer than booze/tobacco, and probly most of your food.

@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Marijuana should be treated like alchohol; although studies have proven it to be 100x better for you then booze, it should be treated equally. You don't have to consume it, nobody's making you get high. Millions of ppl are already using it, they'll just have clean an safer access
@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You as well.
@BJoyMcG @POTUS_Schedule Although, I'm not going to vote for someone who uses that as leverage. I'll vote for legalization as a proposal, but not to get a certain person elected. I'm done voting for individuals.
@BJoyMcG @POTUS_Schedule The hemp bill passed a few weeks ago. So that's one hurdle. There are a couple other bills in the works, but not full legalization to treat cannabis the same way as alchohol is treated in this country. Not yet. I think the 2020 race, a candidate might use it as a selling point.
@BJoyMcG @POTUS_Schedule If he legalized it everywhere, he could say he accomplished something the left wouldn't bitch about. Like you said, every state that has legalized it, has had nothing but success; just imagine if he did it for the entire nation. You're right about Ohio not having it together tho.

@emgifford1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Everyone in this country is already brainwashed and enslaved by the system. I doubt some marijuana will make anyone any dumber than they already are. You know how many people are dumbed down from their TV and the meds their doctors give them?
@rummugtheorc @POTUS_Schedule That's awesome news. I have friends out there, near bentonville, and they are truly grateful.
@DowningVenus @POTUS_Schedule Ohio citizens voted it down the first time bc of the rules that came with it. It passed the second time it was on the ballot.
@gus_short @DowningVenus @POTUS_Schedule Marijuana is not addictive and study after study have shown various health benefits. It stops cancer growth, I mean the list of positives that come from the plant are endless. I, along with millions of others wouldn't consider it dope. Dope is heroin or meth. Weed is a plant.
@gus_short @DowningVenus @POTUS_Schedule What I dont understand is why alchohol is legal and studies have shown that it is 100x more toxic and for people that binge on it could face deadly side effects when they try to quit. Tobacco is a known killer, causing damage to your nerves &amp; organs and almost impossible to quit.

The way the criminal justice system is set up, marijuana users are forced to resort to a "harder" drug, such as cocaine, meth, heroin, and prescription drugs so they pass their periodic drug screens. Most users self medicate bc the illegal marijuana market works better than an RX

Honestly, I'm starting to think it might be better this way bc whatever govt gets involved with, turns to isht. Police only make you dump it out these days.

@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule ..that you'd pay anything to suck this guy's dick. You're pathetic.
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule cks.. Next he's gonna ban trigger assemblies, foregrips, lasers, flashlights.. He's not gaining popularity from the left for doing this, he's pissing off the right. I hate the last guy, 44, as much as anybody but at least he didn't screw w our rights. Man, I bet you any money..
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule Let's talk about it.. what has trump actually done, that he said he would? He lowered taxes for businesses, that was a given. What else? Obama did nothing against gun laws, but the guy who campaigned for gun owners managed to change the definition of a machine gun and ban bumpsto

I voted for him, but if you can't see his own agenda right in front of you.. idk, idc that's your problem. Is all you have personal insults? That's quite childish.
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule Substance abuser? I smoke pot you fukcn idiot.. big difference between that and meth.. it's exactly the point, that's why I'm here, so people can get a buzz just like they do when they drink, it's even healthier.. r u drunk?

@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule I'm not a bot. My name is Mike, I live in the woods in Ohio, south of Columbus.. I moved here to get away from all the leftists ideology in MI.. Have you been there? It's a breeding ground for political corruption..
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule Left, right... politicians are politicians. They all lie and steal your money at the end of the day. I'm not a leftist, like I said, I voted for this guy who has nothing in mind but making money. That's all it is, it's plain as day. If you can't see that, you got your own issues.

@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule Meanwhile the real reason trump wants a wall is so his coke is the only coke coming in. He invested $90M in Colombia in 2016.. have you looked into that? He also has a spot conveniently located in Flordia, semi-submersables can drop it right maralago.. we have mil in the carrabea
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule I'm not out here supporting these gun grabbers. I'm not blowing my smoke in your face. I'm not committing crimes against you. Honestly, if I seen you irl, I wouldn't even offer to share my weed, but if you asked I absolutely would. Marijuana is not a GMO. God put this plant here!
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule ..harder drugs when they get their pot, from the kid next door, frankly, they're less likely to do it. 2 out 3 Americans support the idea of legalization. Why do ppl like you try to step on something you dont want? I voted for trump, I won't again at this rate. #DontTreadOnMe
@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule The thing is, this stuff is already out in the neighborhoods and job sites. The people profiting however, are your n'hood thugs and kids who dont want to work. They're also selling the drugs even I am concerned about; but if normal ppl who want to smoke dont have to get offered..

@therealdanelee @Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule Okay.. meth, crack/cocaine, heroin, fentanyl... thise are all man-made substances. They are very dangerous. Marijuana can be used as medicine as to why its medically available in so many states. You have some research to do. A lot of research.

@OutOfTheBlue201 @POTUS_Schedule Hemp and cannabis are two totally different things. That farm bill is going to hurt small farms and families by mainly supporting large corporate farms.

@Fonz303 @POTUS_Schedule You'll still catch cocaine, heroin, human traffickers, and dangerous criminals, and illegal people from entering. Meanwhile, building a wall will give income to hundreds of people jobs. They want somewhere to go for lunch, probly taco bell or wendys.. still needed.

@CatCas2016 @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump The best part about legalization, you dont have to smoke pot if you do not want to. You wouldn't notice any difference in society, besides better roads, more police, a beautiful city bldg. The thing is, people already use these drugs, smoke/eat plants.

@dogusainc @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump Anti-drug campaigns and the access of information is really making a difference for the younger generation. Of course there are a few rebels, but the numbers of teen drug and alcohol use are declining. Personally, I think we need to be more concerned about tech usage numbers.
@dogusainc @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump Well, thank you. The detox from booze is so cruel compared to a simple craving. I agree, MJ is definitely making a boom and young people are getting hooked but these kids are so mature for their age. They're smart enough to say no and make their own choices.

@dogusainc @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump You can become physically dependent on alchohol, not on the devil's lettuce.

@dogusainc @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump What's more dangerous to you, a plant that literally gets dumped out if you get caught or a drink that literally takes you to jail if you get caught? Why is cannabis legal is Washington DC? Alcohol makes you puke and hungover the next day, weed lasts 1-4 hours, still can function
@dogusainc @Rasmussen_Poll @vivianmtl @realDonaldTrump Heroin, meth, and crack are dope. Dope is literally what the black market calls heroin. I know this because your average person who smokes pot has to meet some pretty tough guys just to get a plant. You'd rather have our children getting drunk and angry, with a man made poison?

@satishs95547858 @NBCNews Mad cuz big government, big corporations, big pharmaceutical. Everyone is lying to you to get what they want. They dont care about you, but I do. There's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight. How are you?
@NBCNews Pharma hype.... just go get dirty and build your immune system up naturally
@tracecb @Pookerscampbell @realDonaldTrump It's a scam to get u scared and go vote.. number of people crossing the border is down about 500k from last year.. or in other words, it's down about half. @POTUS is worried about losing votes.... only if he did what the people want...
@DrNikkiMartinez @realDonaldTrump Also, the number of people crossing the border is down by half of what it was in 2017. It's all lies to get people stirred up and at the voter's booth to vote red bc they're scared or whatever.
@mitchellichtman @realDonaldTrump It's a little scheme to get you to the polls to vote red. The border numbers have dropped by half since 2017. 1 million to 500k. I voted red but the power trip is too much.
@realDonaldTrump This is seriously no big deal. 2018 numbers of people crossing the border are half if the 2017 numbers. @realDonaldTrump is losing credibility. #LegalizeMarijuana because this fake ish is turning me Democrat. Or whoever is pro what I want, being lied to isn't one of them.

Naturally born fucking tweaker kids talking about dont do drugs..... bruh
I dont even have a side. I like Em and @machinegunkelly I grew up in det, all we ever played was Em. Then MGK came out and it was hard. If you quit hating you can watch the dude rise up. You kno how much hate @Eminem got back in the day?
I'm not about to argue with a bunch if illiterate, dumb fucking kids about whose a better rapper when you little shits haven't heard the bars. I've heard every single line from every single song hundreds if not thousands of times, from both artists. Learn to think for yourselves!
