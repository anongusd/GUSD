The essence of Bain Capital was about loading companies up with debt to exploit tax loopholes.
Romney: "I was in the business of balancing budgets" where we loaded companies up with lots of debt and then told them it was their problem.
RT @froomkin: Romney: We'll cut discretionary spending by 5% .Can't tell you what. Except for Obamacare, which actually saves money.
How are tax cuts for the rich more important than medical care for people below the poverty line? #GoBackTeam
Romney: "There are a number of things that sound good, but we can't afford them." Like tax cuts for the rich?
Dear Romney, your education policies did not work. In fact, they FAILED and moved us #backwards.	http://t.co/3iROjUoN
RT @TruthTeam2012: FACT: In Mitt Romney‚Äôs first year as MA governor, schools saw the 2nd highest percentage cuts in the country.
Romney: "I've got a policy for the future and an agenda for the future." President Bush can give you the details.
Reminder: Romney wants to increase military budget by $2,000,000,000,000 while giving tax cuts to the rich and somehow reduce the deficit.

I guess that's why Romney just ends up agreeing with Obama's foreign policy.

Ryan: We won't duck the difficult issues ... unless it involves naming the tax loopholes we would cut.
Interesting choice not to mention George W. Bush, even when discussing the Bush tax cuts and the great recession that Obama/Biden inherited.
Ryan: pulling people out of poverty by cutting one social safety net at a time.
Ryan has offered no clear vision to move this country #forward. Might as well be a return to a more extreme George W. Bush.
Dear Ryan: if you don't have policies to run on, apparently you just attack the incumbent.
That was a really tricky closing question. Biden handled it wonderfully.

Also, #Boehner is the Speaker of the House. He can't keep saying he's outside Washington; he's in its heart. #debtceiling #usc
We definitely liked @BarackObama's speech, but #Boehner's? He seems like he's campaigning and not working on a solution. #debtceiling
