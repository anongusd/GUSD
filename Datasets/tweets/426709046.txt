As a next step, join students and youth across the country at a March  for Our Lives event on March 24th to show your support for reform.
Bigger picture, in my personal opinion, the systemic drivers of  violence--including toxic masculinity, discrimination, inequality,  poverty, and white supremacy--must also be addressed and defeated for  there to be real safety, justice and human rights for all.
The preceding list is not exhaustive, but shows that there are many  steps that politicians can and should take right away to address the gun  violence crisis in the US, if they had the will.
10) Defeat NRA proposals to eliminate safeguards on the purchase of  silencers, arm teachers and make it easier to carry concealed weapons  across the US. Call your Senators and urge them to vote NO on S.446, the  Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.
9) Ensure that gun manufacturers adopt measures to minimize the risk  that their products are used to violate human rights and repeal  legislation that provides broad immunity for gun manufacturers and  dealers selling firearms
8) Provide funding for direct services, especially those in the most impacted communities to address the physical and psychological health impacts of gun violence.
7) Ensure that the human rights of communities most-impacted by gun violence are fully fulfilled, including full access to basic services, such as health care, education, water and sanitation is guaranteed.
6) Reform the criminal justice system to ensure all aspects of law enforcement, including  policing, prisons, and judicial systems, are human rights-compliant and not themselves contributing to the problem.
5) Ban so-called "assault" weapons that represent a high level of risk to public safety and significantly increase the risk of excessive injury should be prohibited for non-military use, including modifications for weapons that allow rapid firing and armor piercing ammunition.
4) Fund, implement and evaluate evidence-based locally run youth and gun violence prevention and intervention programs, including by passing the Youth PROMISE Act (H.R. 2197; S.1770)
3) Pass legislation that protects survivors of domestic violence and prevents abusers from accessing guns, including the Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act (H.R. 4186; S.2044), among others.
Congress should also pass a bill to authorize the appropriation of funds to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention for conducting and supporting research on firearms safety  or gun violence prevention (S.884; H.R. 1832)
2) Fund research into gun violence prevention as a public health issue as well as research into gun safety, including by repealing policy riders including the Dickey Amendment, limiting funding and placing restrictions on research related to firearms.
1) Pass universal background check legislation that ensures a minimum standard to ensure guns are not accessed by people at risk of misusing them. This should also include mandatory training in firearms law and safety. Passing the ‚ÄúFixNICs‚Äù bill would be a good step.
In that context, here are a series of measures that the US government should implement to help save lives. No one should ever claim there's nothing that can be done. There are many evidence-based solutions that--applied together--can reduce killings with guns.
Next, a point that is rarely ever made or acknowledged: addressing gun violence and protecting lives is not a policy choice, but rather a legal obligation under human rights treaties the US has signed &amp; ratified, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
- When firearms are used in the domestic violence context, women are 5 times more likely to die. In fact, the firearm homicide rate for US women is 16 times that of other developed countries. 	 	- Homicides w/ guns disproportionally affect communities of color, youth and women.
First, some facts	 	- On average, 6 children die from gun violence every DAY in the US		- Children &amp; youth under 24 make up nearly 20% of all gun deaths in the US (~92 are killed a day)
