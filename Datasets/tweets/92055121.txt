Confusion. What would really help is a detailed infrastructure plan from the Trump team so we wouldn't have to grasp at offhand comments.
So Trump's own plan doesn't call for any NEW government spending. But that's what Moore is appears to be talking about.
Yet the Trump infrastructure plan only anticipates that companies could offset the tax through tax credit and private financing.

By 2024 Social Security will cost 7.7 times more than Obamacare. And Medicare costs will be 6.6 times higher. Let's keep this in perspective
RT @abettel: CBO projects #Obamacare net costs in 2014 will total $36 billion, $5 billion less than previous projection.
Because starting in 2015, deficits will start creeping back up bc of aging pop, healthcare subsidies and higher interest rates.
CBO says 2014 deficit will be 2.8% of GDP, down from 4.1% in FY13. That's below 40-year avg of 3.1%. Don't celebrate too soon though...

4,173 job openings in February, per BLS. That's the highest level since Jan. 2008. Good sign.
I'd say earnings are going to be an increasingly important indicator in future BLS reports.
So while it's encouraging that there are fewer long-term unemployed and the LFPR is up slightly, we're not out of the woods yet.
BLS report shows a slight dip in hourly private sector earnings. Not something to panic about (yet) but it shows there's still lots of slack

OMB was off by $79 billion and CBO was off by $38 billion, if today's budget numbers are accurate.
In July, the White House (OMB) projected a $759 billion deficit for FY13. CBO in May projected a $642 billion deficit.
You can thank the Jan. 2013 fiscal cliff deal (tax increases), the sequester and basic econ growth for that drop in the deficit.
Between FY12 and FY13, the government spent $84 billion less but collected $325 billion more.

Senate #immigration bill markup in SJC will start with managers' amendment then move on to "trigger" amendments, Leahy says.
Leahy also introduces the long-awaited provision allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor their same-sex partners for green cards.
Leahy files #immigration amendment to prohibit building a fence on the U.S.-Canada border.
24 amendments from Orrin Hatch. Many make it easier for businesses to get H-1B visas.
