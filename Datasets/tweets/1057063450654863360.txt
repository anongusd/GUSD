@brenda_dotter @tribelaw @tedcruz You know what's even more painful? Watching him try to debate.
@sirDukeDevin @Stregabella9 This is mayhaps the least valid of @realDonaldTrump's views. To follow up on this would be one of America's worst violations of peacetime ethics in the last century.
RT @sirDukeDevin: Trump just said in his press conference that if the migrants start throwing rocks, they will be treated as if they have aâ€¦
@AndrewGillum The people will vote now. You have captured their attention.		Now, show us why we should.
@realDonaldTrump In an alternate universe, maybe.
@DesignsCrissys Yup. Just shocking.
@crazynickster @NRA Also, if somebody commits suicide, it is not their own fault. It is never their own fault. It's the fault of everybody around them, who couldn't understand in time the signs of depression and suicide in turn.
@frankwinfrey2 Sure, that's reasonable. Florida isn't regional for me, so I wasn't keeping tabs on Gillum besides as a person of cursory attention. I'll keep track of him now.
@crazynickster @NRA Sure, but is that situation not the same in EVERY other country in the world? How is it possible that we are this far ahead of everyone else in this disgusting metric?
@tribelaw Whilst I cannot speak as to his ability to be president, I can definitely affirm that he is the better candidate than @tedcruz, who is a bumbling political incompetent. Having a progressive Senator from Texas would be huge for this country.
@frankwinfrey2 That's the impression I was getting too. I just wanted to see if a noted endorser had thoughts on the subject
@adamgoldmanNYT @nytimes Journalistic integrity, thank the heavens, seems to have been maintained on at least some level. The fact that this woman came forward speaks for our current system's usefulness, flawed as it may be.
@NRA @realDonaldTrump For those, unlike the tagged people, who seek the truth:	https://t.co/klqEMwIv0g	Accurate information about guns is quite hard to find and I find The Trace does a good job handling a tough issue with aplomb.	#GunControl #getinformed
@NRA So, would you like to justify having the highest firearm suicide rate in the world? How many children, specifically, is that gun worth? #SuicideAwareness #GunControlNow https://t.co/Do47YwtAJq
@realDonaldTrump Second graphic of the day...For all those saying that massacres are an unfixable issue, they aren't. The only difference is how far you're willing to go to prevent them. #AtAllCosts #NeverAgain #Pittsburgh https://t.co/nzKwPafU5D
There's simply no words for some things in this country. Our government must do better. https://t.co/MHMQgiH3Pv
@JeffFlake You had your chances to oppose Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake. Your words ring empty in the ears of Americans, a too-little, too-late appeal to ethics when you have proven you have no moral compass yourself. Come back when you have given more than words for this country.
@SenateGOP And yet, this growth is traced back to policies instituted by the Obama administration. Could you change our minds?
@KamalaHarris @AndrewGillum Gillum's rhetoric certainly sounds good. Can you provide some insight as to his motivations?
Merkley deserves nothing less than a medal to step between Trump and his flawed Healthcare goals. https://t.co/smvUoLNl1A
@RonWyden @VirginiaGarcia Do you have any comments on Healthcare legislation to come in Oregon?
@RepMikeCoffman Very well said.
@realDonaldTrump Oy vey...where to even start? How about: CNN and company do not display falsified news. They display news with a TILT, as do Fox News, the NY Times, MSNBC, etc. The fact of the matter is, truly fake news comes from right wing rhetoric, not from liberal channels doing their job.
@Amy_Siskind @gatorgrad73 This is the only option for America. The influence of the people comes down to their willingness to take a few minutes of their lives to commit an act, which, all things considered, is an investment in their own future.
@SenWarren @SenSchumer Well said, Senator Warren. Do you have any ideas for potential legislation that could lead to stricter, more uniform gun control?
@RepMcKinley @WTOV9 This opioid bill is truly a step forward for the state of West Virginia. How would you describe the bill's strategy for bringing down the 52 overdose deaths per 100,000 in West Virginia?
@RepMcKinley @WVUMedicine @WVNursesAsso You seem to be a fair man in regards to hospital policy. Could you maybe share your perspective on the #MaternalJustice movement?
@CJW80956774 @GreatQuestionB @wanetadawn @realDonaldTrump I don't think so. If anybody has a point, it's up to everybody else to respect the legitimacy of their viewpoint. Most of the time in this country, that doesn't happen. This is one of the many things that must change in America to make this the land of the truly free.
@ValMartel5 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I hoped this was false,even though I knew that it was true.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Trump goes to grieve for the victims... I think the real question is: Will Trump support the victims by pushing for new gun control laws?
@nytimes This is so fundamentally infuriating.	There is numerous first generation Americans who contribute to the intelligence pool in ways that cannot be described. Would Trump strip prospective humans like this of their citizenship? Is America not a melting pot after all?
@AG7251 @realDonaldTrump Of course Trump has instituted some good policies, and of course fake news does exist in some capacity. However, fake news is not something that can be described as the most important issue our country has to deal with. Look at the last week! Gun control and Saudi need attention.
@wanetadawn @realDonaldTrump In the interest of good debate, let's continue this conversation, as so many already have. Mr. Trump often uses inflammatory rhetoric in his speeches, such that media outlets must excerpt and synthesize. This is true of most politicians. The media is simply doing their jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Regardless, Mr. Trump, the point stands that there is significantly more pressing issues facing America than your perceived "fake news" issue.
@SenGillibrand I was wondering what measures you think it best to implement in regards to the lack of funding of hospitals? None of the fine men and women here have come up with a satisfactory proposal to solve the issue. Do you have any thoughts? #MaternalJustice
@KamalaHarris Admirable as always, Senator Harris. Alas, I fear, at the current rate, gun control will continue to be an issue into the foreseeable future.
@lactodouladrph Here is probably the best take of the day. Cultural responsiveness is one of the largest issues in today's America, especially when it comes to maternal justice, due in no small part to the media's reliance on a few, heavily exhausted points. #MaternalJustice
@seayoungy This is the truth. If only more people could understand this...
@marcorubio Glad to see somebody denouncing the shouting matches that modern political debates are. However, I believe that you have used the same tactics on a number of occasions. Hypocrisy is never a good policy, Mr. Rubio.
@SenGillibrand An admirable sentiment, to be sure.
@tedcruz, whilst admittedly not the worst candidate out there, doesn't hold a candle to Mr. O'Rourke. O'Rourke's championing of progressive causes deserves no less than the support of Texas in moving forward. https://t.co/8eEfdrnpNl
@RepLarryBucshon So, I understand, Mr. Bucshon, that you are giving prayers and little else yet again in support of this tragedy. You say you serve Indiana's 8th district. Does this not include the members who will be shot for your negligence? #GunControl
The state of America as of right now may not be quantified using mere words of disgust. Parkland was less than 8 months ago, and yet the victims' words have already been forgotten with nothing but more shootings to show for it.  #synagogueshooting #remember #ParklandShooting
God willing, we won't have to jump through any more hoops to do so. https://t.co/3FgN4yBdAY
@SenGillibrand Somedays, America loses hope in the government. This is not one of those days. Thank you for supporting this country, @SenGillibrand.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Interesting how @realDonaldTrump enacts economic policies that have little bearing on the current situation, and yet the results show the economy skyrocketing. Could @BarackObama have anything to do with this? Surely not.
@realDonaldTrump Of course, @realDonaldTrump, you would find it suitable to have a close partnership with Mr. Bolsonaro, a bigoted, racist man with a long history of rather disturbing rhetoric. Of course.
@SenGillibrand The truth shall stand before those who assault it. #MaternalJustice
@RepJoeKennedy Now, Mr. Kennedy, is the time for brave action, not for brave words. I am with you in heart, in cause, but I cannot trust in you personally until you show the people than you will do more than talk about white supremacy.
@SenJeffMerkley @washingtonpost This is truly commendable. Many a politician would not have noticed or taken the time on this aspect of the Saudi issue, in any way. Whilst one must be aware that you are, of course, pushing your own agenda, America may only benefit from men like you serving it.
