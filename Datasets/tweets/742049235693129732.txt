@mms_boston3 @PressSec If you feel this way about my tweets, Y U ALL UP IN MY BIZ?
@mms_boston3 @PressSec as you seem to be tapped in looking for the negative, she, herself has stated she could lose a few pounds. What better way for her, a gov't employee still getting paid to help those not getting paid?
@mms_boston3 @PressSec your joy is your joy. Mine is tweeting at that lying cunt who is the voice piece for the cheetos-stained turd in the oval. We all find joy differently..
@WhiteHouse it is doing that now while at the same time creating food lines? How ballsy...
@mms_boston3 @PressSec how satisfying is that for you?
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER I have/had no money for food. Lost 58 lbs not eating and still the weight is dropping. I also reversed my high bp and type 2. Yay me
@PressSec You could lose a few pounds, so, how about donating all the food in your house to those furloughed? And then skip the next 2 blood payments from cheetos-stain in chief.. That will happen long before there is ever a wall
@realDonaldTrump hmm.. the recently uncovered testing facilities....did you ever wonder where those missiles are aimed?
@realDonaldTrump you in office (much to our sorrow), 800,000 workers will not get paid tomorrow
@realDonaldTrump what could be more exciting than that? Watching paint dry; watching grass grow; watching @SpeakerPelosi verbally slap the shit out of you; your resignation or impeachment and removal from office; your putting on the orange jumpsuit to match your complexion..endless possibilities.

@realDonaldTrump If that is what you really think, why are you destroying it by holding the citizen's of the US hostage over a temper tantrum?
@realDonaldTrump It is not the MSM that needs restoration, it is the office of the Presidency because of the lying sack of shit now occupying it and holding citizens of the United States hostage.
@realDonaldTrump did you even read what you typed? "many are still in Mexico but can‚Äôt get through our Wall".  So, if there is already a wall there, what is it you are really planning on doing with the 5B+ you are holding the US hostage for?
@SenSanders How much did yours go up?

@realDonaldTrump not as long as you are in office. BTW when are you gonna start chanting "LOCK HER UP" about that little piece of trash you all a daughter? https://t.co/vvMgNGxOWx
@JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews where is the "I would rather eat broken glass and wash it down with gasoline" button?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews and what lies will you be telling today?
@MSNBC Bullshit.. He is just a common, lazy, good for nothing but ridicule, cheetos-stained turd. But that is my opinion of @realDonaldTrump playing at being @POTUS. After multiple deferments, does anyone really think it would go to ANC and look at all of those who died to protect him?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump which lies will he tell this morning?
@amjoyshow Hope it doesn't turn into another "chad" issue.
@DollyParton @Dollywood Would love to Miss Dolly.. just as soon as I figure out how to buy food this week. Love you...
@realDonaldTrump good riddance to bad rubbish. You are next.  Mueller is on his way....
@TheBeatWithAri @nytimes https://t.co/1lHKVjictK
@ananavarro Where have you been lady? People have ALREADY been hurt AND killed. It is more than time for that cheeto stained piece of offal to get the fuck out of the White House. LOCK HIM UP LOCK HIM  UP LOCK HIM UP
@WhiteHouse @FLOTUS WOW is she lucky.. Half a world away from the cheetos stain she left in the White House..
@AnnCoulter If you had your way, legal or not, she would spend the rest of her life banned from the US or in a US prison.
@Alyssa_Milano I waited over 50 years before I told anyone
@StephenKing Not positive, but I believe I have heard that statement as, 	"Denial is not just a river in Egypt." 		The word "just" is not in yours.
@SenFeinstein Excuse me, but why then are you and your colleagues allowing it to happen? If all of you, who are not in the chamber, suddenly appear in the chamber where the voting takes place and raised a ruckus it just may shut it down. You know, civil protest, the 60's and all that.
@WhiteHouse Yeah, your point? Question though, ...How bad did he fuck over the United States this time? AAFA
@AnnCoulter if you close your mouth, you will smell less of it
@StormyDaniels Hopefully not in that order (for either...)..
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I really don't think "Trump" (any of them) and "morals" can be used successfully in the same statement
@SethAbramson I have been following you for a while now and would love to read it. I just wish I could afford a personal copy. Guess I will have yo wait on the local library,
@realDonaldTrump google is your friend: "On August 28, the Government of Puerto Rico officially acknowledged the death toll to be 2,975 people, ranking Maria as one of the deadliest hurricanes in United States history." Just saying.
@tarastrong @realDonaldTrump he IS an insult..
@perlmutations @KellyannePolls Why would you even reply to that lying, alternate truth, talk to a microwave cunt?
@realDonaldTrump If kneeling is so disrespectful, should the guy kneeling in this photo should just stand up and throw Old Glory at the widow instead? Asking for a friend. https://t.co/IszriA08JW
Hey @realDonaldTrump , can you loan me enough money to buy food this week: $50-$75 should do it? Since you have taken office, that is one luxury I can no longer afford.
@Jenapher_B @realDonaldTrump Don't blame me, I tried to get him to run down his mother's leg. Signed, God
@BernieSanders If what you write is true, then maybe it is time for you to sit down and let the younger generation fill the void of your absence. Respectfully.
@yashar and that is a problem why?
@kharyp May a loving Power greater than yourself hold and comfort you tonight, tomorrow, and always. Forever.
RT @Corbinburnsin: This is misleading as fuck. Medicare 4 all is what Obama wanted the ACA to be but had to make concessions for republican‚Ä¶
@TimJGraham Did you fail your high school history classes?
@realDonaldTrump Please... you spend more on golf. For the sake of humanity, resign.
@ananavarro Ma'am, kindly re-read her statement. In almost 2 years, this is the first thing I have ever agreed with a Trump on. I was raised with the ethos, "If you won't write it and sign it, don't say it." The writer is acting cowardly.
@WhiteHouse @WhiteHouseCEA Who are you that you think you can tell these lies over and over and that we will eventually believe you? I have had the same job for over 6 years now. Not one change for the 200 people I work with.
@jamieleecurtis Would love to see this with you, and would happily donate for a chance, but, I am can't even afford to buy food.  Hope it is a GREAT movie (It has you in it, so no doubt there) but I will wait for the movie on TV. Love you.
@WhiteHouse Where? Russia or North Korea? Definitely NOT in my hometown..
@PressSec Have you had your "Oh, fuck, I just broke the law" moment yet? Like cheetos stain himself, can't wait t see you in a one piece jumpsuit. 		Aiding and abetting a traitor is, well, traitorous.
@realDonaldTrump You seem to put a lot of stock in what dictators around the world think of you. Putin - dictator (even though he is called "President"; Kim Jong UN - dictator (even though his title is Chairman) among others A few of us are wondering why. Care to explain?
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo consumer confidence in what? I have to work 2 full time jobs just to have enough money after paying bills so I can buy groceries.
@realDonaldTrump Somehow I knew you would be good for a belly laugh first thing in the morning
@realDonaldTrump Here, let me fix that for you.. Mueller is draining the swamp and you are fighting fighting back. Can't wait to see you in an orange jumpsuit. You fucking TRAITOR.
@realDonaldTrump You are right.. He did not call you an idiot, he called you a fucking idiot you lying fucking idiot.
@PressSec @CNN They have low ratings because all the talk about is trash. You know, the current residents in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec And she is a cunt, so? And, hope you like jail (them men in there are gonna use your hair for shit paper.)
@realDonaldTrump by who?
@realDonaldTrump Best way to do that is resign.
@realDonaldTrump I betcha they are happy, glad and ecstatic that it is below their southern border.
@realDonaldTrump so when are you going to "put out an apology" for infecting humanity with the presence of you and your sewer spewed spawn?
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Dammit.. You made me snork my coffee. Now I have to buy another keyboard. That was funny..
@realDonaldTrump Since ALL the corruption you mention centers around YOU, be assured that at least 658,444,954 people in the US hope it WILL be gotten to the bottom of soon. VERY SOON....Mueller is coming..
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews But they are definitely looking at the train wreck of YOU...
@realDonaldTrump And we have STILL not seen your taxes, so?
@realDonaldTrump Not if you are still called President.
RT @riotwomennn: @PattyArquette @vickyld2281 Each have extremely impressive credentials.  Andrew Weissmann led the DOJ Enron Task Force, wh‚Ä¶
@NancySinatra @SethAbramson he farts?
@realDonaldTrump The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!	Why are you always talking about President Obama?
@cher and what beautiful feet they are..
@krassenstein @Zac_Petkanas well, you just set that up for a, "Wait a second, hold my beer" kinda moment.
@realDonaldTrump You, sir, are a fucking idiot. There is more crime coming from the White House then there is coming from illegal immigration.Fix this NOW you repulsive son of a bitch
@WhiteHouse BULLSHIT
@RepAndyHarrisMD @POTUS fuck that turd bomb you feckless twat
@realDonaldTrump @fema I get talking about the upcoming hurricane season, I really do. My question to you is, ..Why have you not fixed the mess from last season?
@realDonaldTrump hello commander in cheese.. Back to make America grate again?
@realDonaldTrump Can't make money if there is nowhere to sell the product. Did you learn how to make your "deals" at your "university"?
@iamsambee but she is a feckless cunt and her father is a bottle of used douche water. What is the point?
@johncusack love you @johncusack . So, tell us how you really feel..
@realDonaldTrump Look at that.. the sweaty nut-sack is talking about Cox.
@realDonaldTrump YO!  #Cadetbonespurs...  can you name the five that served and died so you could dodge the draft? Oh, and by the way,  #WhereAreTheChildren ?
@PressSec @GenDunford so nice that your child has not been ripped from your arms. but do the world a favor, please ask this directly of @realDonaldTrump you know,  #Cadetbonespurs, #WhereAreTheChildren ?
@WhiteHouse Please ask ths directly of  #Cadetbonespurs - #WhereAreTheChildren

@KellyannePolls Bless your heart.. Let me fix this for you	TRUMP @realDonaldTrump Drove up premiums		TRUMP @realDonaldTrump Made "job locks" worse		TRUMP @realDonaldTrump  **Left more Americansuninsured	There, now people can see the TRUTH instead of the lying bullsh*t that spews from your mouth
@MadamSecretary actually, in life, there are at least 2 guarantees.. birth and death. Some include a third... taxes
@realDonaldTrump You keep yelling ''witch hunt" and "drain the swamp".. you ARE the witch and are drowning in the swamp you created. Don't ya just love karma. By the way, how is Melanie doing?  Was that your side piece while Melania was hospitalized?
@realDonaldTrump if you and your cronies would stop doing illegal and/or stupid things there would be no need for sane, honest people to need to reveal the truth..  just saying
@RepAndyHarrisMD Since you are a real mother too. Happy Mothers' day to you as well
@StephenKing what "boss"? Are you referring to the Cheetos-stained buffoon?
@SenWarren @MickMulvaneyOMB @BetsyDeVosED First volley was fired in 2005. When it became law that student loans could not be included or discharged by bankruptcy.
@StormyDaniels Oh my.. You went for the "T".. I would have stopped at the "C". just saying.
@JimForWiCo about 325 million others as well
@realDonaldTrump WRONG (again) Now IS the time to be thinking and doing about this. Mueller is coming.
@Corbinburnsin @robinthede @TheRundownBET but you said it wrong
@Corbinburnsin @robinthede @TheRundownBET "ALOT" is 2 words.. jsyk
@chrisricewriter I just ate a whole box of Captain Crunch. I am a true cereal killer.
@chrisricewriter did you take the tissues as well? asking for a friend...
@seanspicer Yes, you know the true face of disgrace.. You see it every time you look in  a mirror
@realDonaldTrump were they wearing their pointy white hoods?
@atrupar @MichaelAvenatti @KellyannePolls @PressSec those are nice looking dresses. Shame they represent lipstick on pigs..
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews FU*K no!  Resign cheeto stain. Make the world a better place
@realDonaldTrump Let me fix that for you: 	Is everybody believing what is going on. I can‚Äôt define what a leak is. I illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but don't understand what I did or how serious it is. I lied all over the place to cover it up. I'm either very sick or very dumb. TRUTH
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends great show for those who cannot pass the ID ten T test
@suflyer @jacobrday might want to come pick up the one that has been behind Thirsty's on East Main Street for over a week now. Just saying
@TheEllenShow @Eminem So much for the anonymous part. 11+ here
@SethAbramson seem to be a bit free with the term "person" there.
@EricMcCormack any chance you can let Ms. Messing know her twitter account has been hacked. It is pushing out malware spam. Thank you sir.
@AnneRiceAuthor Aren't you lucky..You don't have to see the insanity. For me, it is like a car accident.. just cant stop watching
@TeaLeoni As I sent to your work husband Tim, YAY !!!
@TimmyDaly @CBS YAY !!!!
@realDonaldTrump we already knew you were a spy.. Giving anymore State secrets to you Russian boyfriend?

@Evan_McMullin Did Donnie cheeto stain @realDonaldTrump arrive with Sarah couldn't tell the truth Sanders @PressSec? Both wearing their liar, liar pants on fire clothing line?
@TheLastWord At least they won't get indigestion from hearing him speak. Pass the Pepto please.
@MSNBC he still has allies? Oh, wait a sec.. you meant his corrupt cronies.
@seanhannity Please stop being a cum stain on humanity
@PressSec has a lot less to do with safety and security of US Citizens and much more to do with him trying to fulfill at least one campaign promise by pandering to his base.
@laurenduca grew up eating them. Not a damn thing wrong with 'em.
@MSNBC I can opt out for free.. It is called delete facebook
@jimmyfallon If you are hosting a show after eating burritos, glad I am not a guest. Phew...the smell is awful.

@BarbraStreisand Did you expect something different from that Cheetos stain?
@jfreewright He is what the bottom feeders feed upon..
@kathygriffin @PresidentShow You will have to work hard to be as obnoxious and toxic as she @KellyannePolls  is. but good luck trying
@realDonaldTrump I would be satisfied with sanctions against you at this point. Mueller blue wave and stormy..
@realDonaldTrump Bitch you couldn't hold your ass with both hands..You have a lot to look forward to.. 2 things to start.. Mueller and the BLUE WAVE. Get ready fucktard
@SethAbramson I was able to follow the link to a (sorry for the expression) wall of text that is not a donation page
@SethAbramson we , as Americans are already paying for @realDonaldTrump 's offenses. Why do we, as Americans, also have to pay for his defense?
@realDonaldTrump You going to fake one for yourself? Or will you present one to John @SenJohnMcCain since he already has the Silver Star Medal, the Legion of Merit, three Bronze Star Medals, another instance of the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart Medal" AFAF
@RepAndyHarrisMD ohhh something to throw at you when next you lie
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @JudgeJeanine Witch Hunt you say? Oh look, I found @TomiLahren
@chrisricewriter and she is probably talking to her microwave as you read this
@chrisricewriter It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
@perlmutations Why in the world would you post this picture before I have had coffee. Only word I have for it is "gross"
@KellyannePolls Did your microwave tell you to say that?
@RepAndyHarrisMD @NIFLA did you take out stock in wire hangers? Because that is going to become a commodity item for use in dark, dank allies.
@laurenduca Fire is good too...
@SarahKSilverman I guess the truth hurts. Poor thing.. His career sucks and there is a empty space where his brain should be. Maybe he should learn to ask "Would you like fries with that?"
@realDonaldTrump Other than the general public, have you pissed on or been pissed on by anyone lately? Or, was Stormy your last?
@realDonaldTrump since you have no intellect, none can be stolen from you. Aren't you lucky...
@WhiteHouse What "record-breaking economic successes already achieved under President Trump" are you referring to?
@perlmutations lipstick on a pig
@PressSec  https://t.co/70msv9V7nm
@LadyWelker hmm. Let's see. Career check; home check; food and clothing check. Husband who loves you dearly (even if he is in the hospital) check; unconditional love from animals you got that too. Please. describe your definition of failing..
@Janefonda gorgeous enough to turn me straight
@JohnLeguizamo damn it.. can't even get that right. what a loser he is
@prattprattpratt was the big one named Mary?
@realDonaldTrump Because you are so fucking nuts, I wonder if this is made in your size. https://t.co/y9tlRFrv40
@realDonaldTrump really nice sentiment coming from a traitor. Thanks
@JoyAnnReid Now he can find out how the other 99% exist
@realDonaldTrump ARE YOU 3? https://t.co/X3ioHotLhL
@realDonaldTrump did you pass them classified information too?
@realDonaldTrump and did you thank your predecessor yet? He can be reached at @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump So is your ass. Care to comment?
@KellyannePolls Good riddance to bad, smelly rubbish. Can't wait for you to follow.
@KeithOlbermann I. too, prefer you do politics. miss your videos
@MadamSecretary @TeaLeoni WOW.. It seems you are finally old enough to buy a beer.. Hope your day is as awesome as you are. Happiest of birthdays to you
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How did you get so brain damaged? Did you slip and bang your head or did your mama hold you by the legs and repeatedly slam your head against a wall trying to knock the stupid out of you?
@realDonaldTrump It is going to be such an amazingly great day when you and your children are arrested and put in jumpsuits to match your hair and skin color. Mueller is coming and there is NOTHING you can do to stop him. Here, try not to think of this face as you try to sleep https://t.co/uAujkHLRHZ
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews  https://t.co/eZSV3oRbxL
@realDonaldTrump I would say bullshit, but this is more appropriate https://t.co/SahM7IIEcP
@PressSec what happens every time you or @realDonaldTrump start speaking: https://t.co/I7IUxhklyK
@realDonaldTrump Yes we can. Anyone without the last name Trump or Kushner would do fine
@AnneRiceAuthor Yes, as a matter of fact, he does.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize a yuge portion of the population of the US of A  think of you as a savage sicko, don't you?
@realDonaldTrump like you and your sons, short bus special
@jfreewright speaking of Mike Flynn.. have you ever noticed how many Russian bots Mike follows..
@realDonaldTrump remember this face as it haunts you nightmares tonight, tomorrow night and for the rest of your natural life https://t.co/iIdjpnru4x
@realDonaldTrump I see.  And what did the survivors of the latest mass shooting in the United Sates have to say to you?
@realDonaldTrump maybe because it was their money. Oh, please stop trying to deflect. Mueller is on your tail feathers now and you trying to make the waters more muddy cannot save you. You can, on the other hand save yourself. Wanna know how?  Just resign and it will become clear.
@PressSec @POTUS Oh my God.. Do you live in the same reality the rest of the world lives in or are you getting your briefings from Kelly Ann's microwaves? I have never read such total and utter bullshit except for @realDonaldTrump's.
@tribelaw Please.. You know damn well it is BOTH
@RepAndyHarrisMD Gee.. It would be nice if you grew a set and took Mr. Cheetos Stain to task. An while you are at it, kindly introduce legislation to...Oh, nevermind...that will never happen
@KellyannePolls Just for you	https://t.co/WxtHMZHtEq
@JustinTrudeau @POTUS Pourquoi appellerais-tu Trump √† ce sujet? Pourquoi ne pas appeler quelqu'un qui se soucie r√©ellement de l'humanit√©? Donald @realDonaldTrump et la famille ne se soucient que d'eux-m√™mes et de la fa√ßon dont cela leur serait profitable
@JustinTrudeau @POTUS Why would you call Trump about it? Why not call someone who actually cares about humanity? Donald @realDonaldTrump and family only care about themselves and how it would benefit them
@CBSIntlTweet @TeaLeoni @TimmyDaly @patinamiller @Primetv_NZ @MadamSecretary can't wait.. Show is awesome sauce..

@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/pQGJmuisUH
@RepAndyHarrisMD so you can lie to us on the phone instead of in person?  Is it Nov 6  yet?
@realDonaldTrump Want to know the best protection for the United States? Mueller. That is the best protection and he is coming for you.
@WhiteHouse In what reality do you think this is true?
@realDonaldTrump Here. let me fix this for you:	Dems want to fix DACA far more than the ass-kissing tRumpites do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2009-10, and they decided to use DACA as a prelude to continued immigration reform. You just don't like non-white people.
@WhiteHouse I am sorry.. Who was it, in particular, yuo were speaking of? Dingleberrydonald himself and his parents or his soon to be 3rd ex-wife and her parents?
@realDonaldTrump that is because people can only collect unemployment for 26 weeks at a time without an extension.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes wait a sec.. weren't  you calling the @NYT "fake news".  Oh, and, what you have stated is NOT what the article states. Try reading it first - or are there too many yuge words in it for you to understand..
@realDonaldTrump Mueller is coming. Is that not enough "due process" for you?
@realDonaldTrump Bullshit. You just couldn't follow it because truth is not one of your abilities. Besides it was too yuge and had too many words for you
@NancySinatra @JoyAnnReid @joncoopertweets I was gonna say anger and hate
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS @foxandfriends Most of the people I know in the military wouldn't piss up his ass if his guts were on fire, because, most of them don't like pussy grabbing draft dodgers.
@WhiteHouse oh, and don't forget.. a crashing stock market
@Rosie wow Rosie.. Your bulge is bigger than his..
@realDonaldTrump fat chance you fat, bald-headed puddle of vulture vomit. https://t.co/eOrGiEWy8F

@Pontifex Sorry, Pope @Pontifex, Jesus was never lost..
@PressSec So how come you haven't mentioned the deaths of others? Carrier, Sears, K-mart etc et. al  Are you really that blindly stupid?
@perlmutations need a hand with that? asking for a friend
@Alyssa_Milano what if it someone is hating the bigot trump?
@realDonaldTrump March is not the only thing coming up fast.. I see Mueller..
@thehill I think you have that a little backwards. Title should read  The Turmoil of Trump's first State of the Union  threatens to distract from FBI investigation
@MarkWarner Yeah.. and people in hell would like to have ice water..
@jacobrday @MyDelmarvaNow sure.. Put 'em on a roof so they can fall or get pushed.
@thehill I have brains enough to know I will be shopping @Lowes instead of your shithole of a store @HomeDepot.
@AP Wait a second.. How did this happen.  We were told by Donald @realDonaldTrump that he defeated ISIS. Is ISIS not defeated?
@DonaldJTrumpJr At least she is able to read. Some of those words are the biggest words, incredible words. Words that have real meanings. Something your daddy @realDonaldTrump has a hard time with.
@realDonaldTrump Carrier.  nuff said
@GovMikeHuckabee you sir are another conservative under nazi trump and a traitor with a temper. Shame on you.
@RVAwonk well that was a vision I did not want in my head.. Thanks for the nightmares

@RepAndyHarrisMD Still can't get it correct. You voted to end the #Trumpshutdown #RepublicanShutDown Stop lying to your constituents.

@PressSec WTF kind of drugs are you on? Verizon, AT&amp;T, Carrier laying off thousands of employees. Sams, Sears and Kmarts closing. And you call this success? You are a culprit under nazi trump.
@PressSec @POTUS You are a culprit under nazi trump. I just listened to both your recording and the REAL, undoctored recording. It is definitely "I", NOT "I'd". You seem to have your head so far up dingleberrydonalds ass, his shit has stuffed your ears
@PressSec WTF kind of drugs are you on? Verizon, AT&amp;T, Carrier laying off thousands of employees. Sams, Sears and Kmarts closing. And you call this success? You are a culprit under nazi trump.
@realDonaldTrump So, when is your next sleep over with Putin?
@realDonaldTrump You have lied so many times. Just what, exactly, do you think would make us believe you now?
@realDonaldTrump They came to you with a plan. You said no and then you blasted out the phrase "shit hole countries". You, sir, are a boil on the ass of humanity that needs to be lanced to end the spread of the vile poison that spews from your face. Resign
@PressSec Oh look..more from the catastrophe under nazi trump who does nothing BUT lie
@realDonaldTrump so many lies of dingleberrydonald being exposed. He doesn't even try to gt it right or correct it when he is caught in the lie. That book is about a mentally deranged occupant of the White House. BTW that book exists, so IT cannot be fake.
@PressSec Oh, we learned something all right.. We learned Dotarddingleberrydonald is a lying racist and you are his lying calamity under nazi trump.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump lying cat under nazi trump.
@AnneRiceAuthor Knowing that you are a woman of extraordinary words, your statement, "Every day that you do not impeach, your country suffers" might have read better as "Every day that you do not impeach, OUR country suffers.. Just a thought.
@AnnCoulter You are a vile cat under nazi trump
@GeorgeTakei I already do. What took you so long?
@realDonaldTrump You cut off the supply of your own cocaine? Damn. that was ballsy
@PressSec @POTUS well that made me snork my milk..
@colbertlateshow If he waits a year or so, he can use the inside information he obtains
@USATODAY Probably had to. Attorneys for him and his family are not cheap
@realDonaldTrump good for them. It will give all those GE, Carrier and AT&amp;T people somewhere to work
@realDonaldTrump good for them. It will give all those GE, Carrier and AT&amp;T people somewhere to work
@yashar Oh dear God.. It looks like she is spawning again..
@AnneRiceAuthor He doesn't feel legitimate because he isn't
@realDonaldTrump the fact that Dotardly Dingleberry Donald colluded with Russia has nothing to do with it, right?
@realDonaldTrump legislature writes the law, president approves the law, courts uphold the law and police enforce the law. Is there some part of that you don't understand?
@realDonaldTrump Extortion now?  Is there no crime you won't commit?
@joncoopertweets lipstick on a pig
@Alyssa_Milano me too
@PressSec c'mon SpewingSarah @PressSec. you know better than that. Tax cut: rich got richer/poor got poorer; ACA (REAL name for Obamacare) end of mandate did not kill it, ISIS still exists, economy is booming only for the rich.
@realDonaldTrump so #DingleberryDonald @realDonaldTrump , since the nasally puss Stephen did not answer the question, I will ask you..	Did #douchedon @DonaldJTrumpJr walk those "Jumos" up to your office on the 26th floor after the talked about meeting?
@PressSec  https://t.co/80GAvliPUS
@PressSec @SenateMajLdr so you are saying you are only 300 days or so old? You look much older and so does turtle face McConnell
@realDonaldTrump so should you #DingleberryDonald
@BetteMidler I cannot afford a copy, may I have yours when you are finished?
@realDonaldTrump the first 13 months of #Donalddingleberry : November of 2016 through December of 2017 unemployment of Americans of African descent dropped 1.1% and you want applause for that? You must be really mentally unstable or not very smart to not realize this was because of @BarackObama
@JarlBystrom #DirtyDonald, ..I would have preferred #DingleberryDonald. To wit: din¬∑gle¬∑ber¬∑ry	ÀàdiNG…ôlÀåberƒì/Submit	nounvulgar slang	1.	US	a foolish or inept person.	2.	a particle of fecal matter attached to the anal hair of an animal.
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @POTUS44 by the way have you said thank you to @POTUS44 yet?
@realDonaldTrump and unless you do something stupid, because of @BarackObama @POTUS44 's policies, it will continue to rise.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you @BarackObama  @POTUS44 for your wisdom of putting in place policies that continue to grow the economy and that may survive @realDonaldTrump
@SalisburyPD wow.. How about getting Phillips Ave done? Asking because they never do
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Mueller, 	Please hurry and remove this from office. 	Thanks.	Yours Truly,	 The Rational Citizens of the United States
@JoyAnnReid @TheLastWord I love you to pieces Ms. Joy, so I have to ask..Why would you "blame" all of America when it is just one group of small minded people seeking to destroy the best that America is or could be?
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs YAY.. most rounds of golf and most vacation days in first year. Those are the 2 greatest.
@realDonaldTrump @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs If this is the case, WHY ARE YOU CONSTANTLY CUTTING VETERAN'S BENEFITS?
@realDonaldTrump Good-bye to really BAD rubbish. Are you cutting his social security and the rest of his benefits?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity thanks but I would rather chew up the inside of a car battery.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls who the fuck did your make-up? I have seen corpses look better
@realDonaldTrump look cockholster, knock it off or go sit in a corner until you learn to play nice
@realDonaldTrump You gonna cover all your lies as well?
@realDonaldTrump Should have never been in Florida to begin with. You may want to stay though as coming back to DC puts you in Mueller range.
@realDonaldTrump The United Sates has foolishly made you president and you have given us nothing but lies and deceit thinking the citizens of the United Sates as fools.
@SheriffClarke Has your penis stopped working or something? If it is not working, there is help available. If it is working, kindly go f yourself.
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump yo cheeto-stain in chief @realDonaldTrump,  lying pie hole @PressSec, and crypt keeper @KellyannePolls here are some facts for you. REAL facts, not alternative facts..
@RealRonHoward wow.. That is some expensive food. I would settle for being able to afford 2 cheeseburgers and a med fry.
@realDonaldTrump How many times are you going to lie today?
@realDonaldTrump smart voters want to put democrats in office be cause they ARE smart. Besides we as Americans are tired of dealing with your f*cked up thinking that you are in charge. We will show you who is really in charge.
@realDonaldTrump You have the nerve.. THE EXACT SAME THING CAN BE SAID FOR THIS COUNTRY.
@realDonaldTrump Well, good that they are coming back. It will give the unemployed steel workers, coal miners and verizon employees somewhere to work since you cost all of them their jobs.
@SheriffClarke Isn't threatening violence against someone in violation of twitter rules?
@PressSec **sarcasm on** Yay.. go white supremacists..**sarcasm off**
@realDonaldTrump Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the American people will face a choice. The world is watching! I fixed it for you. RESIGN
@BetteMidler we can hope to the Goddess 3 is not true
@PressSec This is a satirical tweet? Right?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends In case no one told you, I guess I will: Fox News is FAKE. and they couldn't tell the truth if it was written on cue cards for them
@realDonaldTrump That is enough. I am a US Citizen: GET OUT OF MY FUCKING HOUSE.
@realDonaldTrump I thought extortion and bribery were against the law. BTW has anyone told you that when you drink water, your mouth looks like an asshole? you should stick to straws (they are, after all, the size as Putin's penis) you should be used to sucking on that size by now.
@BarbraStreisand were you even of age to drive it? I think not..
@WhiteHouse Yeah, right. This lie is now a matter of public record. It will be archived like all the rest of this White House's lies, half-truths and alternative facts.
@realDonaldTrump There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem as long as you, the shit-stain in chief, sit in the White House
@realDonaldTrump you are right on that.. we haven't seen anything yet from you. the current economy is the result of @POTUS44 @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump can't wait to hear that you are begging Big Bad Bubba to give you more lube as you bend over forwards. Mueller is coming.
@foxnewspolitics @dcexaminer what do you expect when the current cheeto-stain in chief is nastier than pond scum and more disgusting than re-eaten vomit? betcha anything @realDonaldTrump is pissed off that @BarackObama is "most admired man" for 10th year in a row.
@realDonaldTrump BAD BOY, BAD BOY WHATCHA GONNA DO? WHATCHA GONNA DO WHEN MUELLER COMES FOR YOU..
@AP could it be because NO ONE LIKES HIM??
@JoyAnnReid If the RICO laws kicked in and he and his family lost everything and had to survive on welfare and food stamps. Imagine that..
@PressSec There is a strong commander in chief? Where? Please tell me you are not referring to the scumbag vacationing in Florida AGAIN
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends Mueller. He is coming to get you. Oh what a party that will be!!!
@realDonaldTrump How many will die or go bankrupt first?
@realDonaldTrump Is that why Verizon is laying off workers? Or maybe the steel workers. yeah.. great year
@realDonaldTrump Mueller.
@SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump look at her words..POW... Right in the kisser.
@morgfair and lightening did not strike the building? Shame
@realDonaldTrump You should have been a cum stain on a towel.
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren I will make it simple. I would rather be a snowflake than a drivel spewing cunt like you
@ChrisVanHollen If only I could afford a candle. Merry Christmas.
@Wm_Swadley @FLOTUS @POTUS fun: F**king Us Nightly. so yeah, they be having fun
RT @mcd1018: @FLOTUS @jaketapper @POTUS This is the most dark and depressing Christmas scene I have ever seen.
@realDonaldTrump You are scum. Let no one blow smoke up you ass and tell you different. Is it you goal to destroy everything? Can you not see what oil does to the world?
@mindyfinn @realDonaldTrump give him a second and he will shout, "Hold My Beer". just wait for it.
@realDonaldTrump The Fake President refuses to talk about how Small and Weak his HANDS are. He shows Fake pics just like they report Fox News. Despite only HONEST reporting, we are not doing well - everybody is going to beat us. MANY ARE GETTING ARRESTED. FIXED IT 4U
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews OH SHUT UP YOU WHINY FUCKING CRYBABY
@realDonaldTrump Have you formally thanked a real President for the hard work he did to accomplish that? You know.. @BarackObama @POTUS44
@realDonaldTrump Please step out of your fantasy world.	https://t.co/jtDbDF3law	https://t.co/cPfx5ofzGz	https://t.co/JjhrSFii48	https://t.co/Z297x1l4WM	https://t.co/MRk2FDMsPB...	https://t.co/6cWj6YTA7L...	and fox states you walked back support AFTER losing	https://t.co/2YT9iUWYNV...	Try again
@realDonaldTrump and how much did you take from Putin?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Time to investigate if @RandPaul has been stealing and eating the lead paint @realDonaldTrump was saving for his dessert
@TheLastWord Still NEVER gonna order or eat Papa John's again
@WalshFreedom Joe, Please stop licking the lead paint off the walls.
@WhiteHouse This is a joke right?
@PressSec as cheeto-stain golfs.. yeah the government if full of waste. another example: paying someone to lie to the citizens of the US. You know, your salary and what you continue to do on a daily basis.
@realDonaldTrump 5th largest tax cuts. Can you not even get that right?
@realDonaldTrump I hope when you get to Hell you don't try lying to Satan like you lie to the citizens of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump Damn you flip flop a lot. Yesterday, you hated the UN. Today you are all up their asses thanking them. Can you please make up your mind. Currently, it is like watching a game of pong.
@realDonaldTrump No, the most hated part of the ACA was you continues attempt to end it. If it was so fail, why have so many signed up for it?
@realDonaldTrump If you are endorsing him, he must be a scumbag just like you.
RT @funder: Retweetfest: Tweet this link out in the next 2 hours &amp; we‚Äôll RT you!		Help our organization @TheDemCoalition win back Congress‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump good. I ran out of toilet paper this morning. Oh, wait...you said accomplishments.. I thought you said failures.. Guess I have to o to the store after all.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, where is that money coming from? You increased defense spending and increased the national debt by over 1.5 TRILLION $. You lowered the tax rate on corporations so that money not flowing into the US coffers..What cuts are you going to demand to pay for infrastructure?
@realDonaldTrump the "rage" as you put it is that those companies had that money all along. Like you, they were just Scrooge-like in that they chose to not give in the places that needed it.
@ananavarro what is "a conversation"?
@morgan_murphy I wonder if Pence uses the double headed one with his wife Mother
@feministabulous Please tell me you sent this to @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec .. I am sure they would get a kick out of it
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse How about sending me some of that 5.7 MILLION dollar deduction? I could use it to buy a car battery and some food.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr Since you both will profit so greatly from this "tax cut" could you send some of that excess money to me. I work a full time job and a part time and still don't have enough money to feed myself.
@GeorgeTakei Only on the end of her broom
@WhipHoyer If the house has to re-vote on the bill after making some necessary changes, doesn't that mean that the vote in the senate is null, since the senate voted on something that is non-existent ? Why would the Senate not have to re-vote as well?

@PressSec I am so sorry to burst your bubble, but a little Byrd told me that the first passing in the House was illegal and has to be re-voted on. And you are now saying that the Senate has passed a bill that has not passed the House yet?
5. Will you vote to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to cure the deficits this bill creates, as Paul Ryan and others have indicated they plan to do?	Please answer soon as possible as your re-election may hang in the balance.
@SenatorCollins 	1. What is your net worth?	2. How much do you personally stand to gain financially from the bill?	3. Did you vote for the bill at the urging of your donors?	4. How much will the average person in your district see in temporary tax relief?
@GOPLeader A little "Byrd" just said it has to go back to the House to be re-voted on. Please learn to fact check.
@SteveScalise @POTUS But gee.. It seems as though it has to be re-voted on. Something a little Byrd told me..
@maddow This is what happens when so few review and attempt something so drastic. They fail.

@realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost everything not made up in your twisted, oxygen starved, lead paint filled brain is probably real. How is it gpoing trying to hide from Mueller?
@realDonaldTrump but have you sent your letter of thanks and congratulations to @BarackObama @POTUS44 ?  After all, it is because of HIS hard work and lack of golf outings that helped do this FOR you..
@sahilkapur raised prices on insurance	cut taxes only for his ilk	destroyed the last pristine area of the world	stole Obama's SCOTUS nomination	Put names of un or under-qualified Judges	Killed democracy.  Yeah, great bill.NOT
@realDonaldTrump before the RICO laws get you and take away all your ill gotten gains (you know, money laundering and all: Think Mueller) you may want to start applying to one of those "many beautiful jobs".
@realDonaldTrump Have you sent the thank you letter to @BarackObama @POTUS44 yet? If not, why not get on it now before you claim success for anymore of his work.
@PressSec did you send a letter of thanks to @BarackObama @POTUS44 for the inherited good fortune of his presidency?
@laurenduca  https://t.co/Conn0hSiEk
@laurenduca I would have said Venus: mars was named after a male deity, venus was named for a female. Let him suffer under the thumb of a female instead
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Keep telling yourself those lies.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Have you said thank you to @BarackObama @POTUS44 yet? It was, as you KNOW, his doing.
@realDonaldTrump Have you said thank you to @BarackObama @POTUS44 yet?
@realDonaldTrump And except for the dictators you met with, NOT ONE SOUL would have pissed on you if you if you were right in front of them. Oh, wait, ...
@realDonaldTrump Then why hasn't it happened? @BarackObama @POTUS44 would have had it done (legally, ethically and morally . You are a turd and can't compete.
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @CNBC Thank you @BarackObama @POTUS44 for putting into place policies that continue to make things like this happen. Hope Donald Cheeto-stain keeps his fingers out of it..
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Thank you for the warning. Eating broken glass and washing it down with bleach would be more entertaining
@perlmutations BTW.. you would have my vote
@perlmutations their (says the grammar police)
@PressSec @POTUS The most under-reported?  How much time and money he has spent playing golf and how much wealthier he is since those "fees" have to be paid to him..
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Are you getting your alternate facts from @KellyannePolls again?
@PressSec Bitch.. You just made me snork coffee thru my nose.
@JoyAnnReid @PoliticsNation Isn't it science-based that they were born with the incorrect physiology? Isn't it evidence-based that they have lives filled with more diversity? It seems those who oppose equality of the fetus and the trans-gendered are more vulnerable to suffering from issues of entitlement.
@BetteMidler who fell out of the news?
@realDonaldTrump Quit pretending.. You know you can't read that. You ate too much lead paint.
@realDonaldTrump Dude.. send me some of that shit you are smoking since it is obviously strong enough to make you trip balls.
@WhiteHouse QUIT eating the lead paint off the walls. It is just making you more intelligence deficient than you were yesterday. And for the love of all that is Holy, stop including it as the main spice for all the shit you feed @PressSec @FLOTUS, @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump
@realDonaldTrump Oh, excuse me for a moment. I have a little throw-up left in my mouth after reading that.
@PressSec @POTUS I really wish you would stop eating lead paint.
@PressSec How do you know if @PressSec is lying?	Her mouth is open.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Did you just decide to continue eating the lead paint or is this level of stupidity just a result of Daddy force feeding it to you as an infant and a child?
@TheLastWord Good riddance to bad rubbish. Now if we can just get the rest of the trash out of the White House and both houses of Congress...
@realDonaldTrump I wish we could adjust the size of the font. I would type this in 92 pt. it reads BULLSHIT. YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT WAS YOU ON THE TAPE. YOU KNOW DAMN WELL YOU ARE A PERVERT AND YOU ALSO KNOW DAMN WELL YOU HAD RUSSIAN HELP. STOP LYING.
@HuffPostPol I registered as a republican in 1981. I changed to democrat in Dec 2017. I will never identify as a republican again as long as I remain alive.
@KellyannePolls Really? Standing behind and supporting another racist and his mother? You are a piece of work..
@MyDaughtersArmy does that really say treason for the season? That is priceless
@BetteMidler or as much as.. they just don't want the money as badly
@PressSec You are so full of shit.  It IS @POTUS44 who is responsible for the GREAT things in this nation. It is your puss sucking boss who is trying to ruin it. Try again.
@amjoyshow @NBCNews So do most, or should I say "the most" rational citizens of the United States
@PressSec Please stop doing the citizens of the United States such disservice. You know that the person to be thanking is really @POTUS44 not the loser currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW. Every time you lie you make the world a little bit sicker
@amjoyshow @NBCNews @MSNBC Moore is or wants to be part of the MAGA team. He believes that the last time the US was "great" was during the era of slavery. I would think that would be a motivating factor.
@KellyannePolls @CNN @DailyCaller Oh I see. You can have "alternative facts" but others cannot make errors?  BTW a friend told me tweet you that your make-up is botched. It makes you look like the crypt keeper
@realDonaldTrump even your boy Moore stated the last time the US was great was during the era of slavery. Is that what you are going for again?
@realDonaldTrump @CNN You call for people who make "mistakes" to be fired. Why does that not hold true for you? You did, after all, admit on-air to sexually assaulting and pussy grabbing women. Normal humans  consider those "mistakes in honor and judgment"
@realDonaldTrump That was the smallest "rally" crowd I ever saw.  It was just like your inauguration crowd and your National tree lighting ceremony crowds. I guess tiny hands aren't the only tiny things going for you.
@PressSec Thank you President @BarackObama for putting into motion the changes necessary to achieve this. Now if we can just keep President Cheeto-stain Buffoon from ruining it.
@realDonaldTrump wait a sec.. You were caught cheating and even admitted it. Why have you suffered no severe penalties?
@PressSec winning at what? Losing or being last in the world? No longer a leader in the world? A single country which other countries looked up to?
@SenSanders REALLY? You put the "president" and "think" in the same tweet.. I though better of you Senator since that chunk of lemming shit doesn't know how to think..
@realDonaldTrump Oh look.. The bone-spur disgrace spoke again. Glad I have the volume muted.
@PressSec If dickface @realDonaldTrump doesn't get us all killed first. You know.. all that goading of North Korea
@SethAbramson How about when an alleged rapist is elected president?
@PressSec @POTUS I have determined you are a schmuck's ass-kisser
@realDonaldTrump I have determined you are a schmuck.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends why oh why did the American people elect this idiot?
@realDonaldTrump bull shit
@realDonaldTrump Democrats did not vote for that crap because, unlike you, they have working brain cells. 	Have you signed your letter of resignation yet? It is simple: tweet this statement - I, Donald J. Trump, Knowing that I was never qualified, resign the office of President. Signed, DJT
@PressSec @WSJ It is amazing what happens when a president's plans comes to fruition. Thank you @POTUS44 for your foresight. Shame it couldn't continue with the scum currently occupying the White House.
@PressSec the real Trump effect https://t.co/u5SjNPEqZw
@realDonaldTrump Mueller is on his way. As soon as he gets to you EVERYTHING will be greatness.
@realDonaldTrump Please finish wiping your ass and get off the toilet. All your tweets are smelling of big macs and fish fillets.
@realDonaldTrump we can only wish you had been a miscarriage. BTW I didn't type this tweet
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You know all about taints, doncha...You see on every time you stick your head up your ass. BTW I didn't write this tweet
@realDonaldTrump couldn't decide which to post.. https://t.co/rryiTeRMKF
@realDonaldTrump @ABC wish we could do it with your FAKE presidency.
@realDonaldTrump You are calling someone out for being a liar? That is priceless.
@realDonaldTrump Name one of the "many people"you cheeto-stained dick turd
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Wow.. the crowd there looks bigger than the crowd at the national tree lighting ceremony (and I see only 4 people)
@SethAbramson ha.. you say accidentally, I say with willful intent
@realDonaldTrump and 62 years later, you, and the other soon to be convicts infesting the White House, are trying to change it back.
@WhiteHouse Per the pictures crowd was like the size of Trump's hands....tiny
@EricMcCormack Would love to know when I can see the second season in the United States
@PressSec If you believe half the b*llsh*t you spew, you are one dumb, mother-f*cking c*nt. Your mother and grandmother should be slapping the sh*t outta you for all those lies you tell.
@maddow You "normal"? Bite your tongue.. I would have to go with AMAZINGLY SUPER NORMAL
@realDonaldTrump I believe it is the repukelicans who are soft on crime, not the dems. After all, it is the repukelicans who are stalling your impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump The REAL travesty of justice is that you raped your first wife, kissed and groped women without their permission, have colluded with the 	Russians to undermine the standing of the US all over the world, and are trying to start a nuke war. Resign NOW
@realDonaldTrump This from a pedophilic pussy grabber who likes to get pissed on.. Yeah, right
@realDonaldTrump Hell, You can do that be resigning. Write after me....I, Donald Trump, resign the Office of President. Print that out and sign it. That would make America great again..
@realDonaldTrump WRONG.  You are universally HATED by the MOST people. The ones that matter anyway.
@PressSec @POTUS The only major victory we hope for is him signing his resignation letter.
@thehill and here I gave her credit for being intelligent. My bad. 	My dearest Susan Sarandon .You can't be that much of a fucking idiot. Signed, Humanity.
@realDonaldTrump most of the time I tell wanna be comedians to not quit their day job, but this is so funny we are all asking you to. Please quit your day job.. It is real easy and uses the best words. They are as follows: I quit. Sign it Donald J. Trump. mis-spellings are ok.
@realDonaldTrump No, you are wrong. The last thing we need in Congress is a pedophile. Are you trying to get him elected so you have someone to compare notes with? You are a pervert and deserve to be behind bars. Have you signed your resignation letter yet?
@KamalaHarris not sure if the law changed again (there is or was a bipartisan bill to reform), but federal student loans except in extreme circumstances cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.
@realDonaldTrump CFPB is doing just fine protecting us from scum like you. Have you signed your resignation letter yet?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Who are you trying to grab by the pussy now?
@KellyannePolls just goes to show.. you are as dumb as you look.
@JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump Did you really ask the man who does not know how to think, for his thoughts? You are better than that Miss Joy.
@hasanthehun named for @realDonaldTrump ?
@WhiteHouse FUCK NO
@realDonaldTrump are you sure it wasn't TURD of the year? After all, you ARE a large pile of SH*T and you spew the same from your mouth every chance you get. asking for a friend. So when are you signing the resignation letter? Sooner is much better. MAKE AMERICA SUPER SANE AGAIN
@iamfonda they make condoms and rubber gloves that small? Who woulda thunk it..
@realDonaldTrump as soon as you resign, we will go back to being great. That way, we insure the US is free of at lease one pedophile/rapist/child molester. 	Type this or copy and paste: 	Dear United States of America, 	I resign effective 11/22/2017. 	Truly, 	Donald Trump
@realDonaldTrump That is NOT a winter white house. It is a trump property that we, the citizens of the United States pay you to sleep at. Do you not see how fundamentally WRONG that is?
@realDonaldTrump sort of like treason and pedophilia are killing your presidency?
@realDonaldTrump And so is treason, collusion, sexual assault, rape, money laundering..Should I go on and list the rest of your crimes?
@realDonaldTrump You call LaVar  "a poor man's version of Don King without the hair,"  but you are, have been, and will continue to be "the wealthy man's version of human scum with the hair (plugs). How is it going with that resignation letter?
@PressSec You mean something that was intelligent finally got tweeted from your phone that was also not a lie? Call me surprised
@ladygaga Absolutely STUNNING
@PressSec make sure the turkey says thank you or the pardon may be reversed
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @Varneyco economic boom will happen when you start wearing your orange jumpsuit and take your place in the pen for traitors.
@jfreewright until I scrolled down, I thought that was a reference to a Turmp @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump your ratings are well down as well. Can't wait for you to be suspended. BTW, and afaf do you know how long it will be before you start wearing your orange jumpsuit?
@ananavarro up and reading your post..
@realDonaldTrump "they do not want to disappoint the American public".. good one. You have been disappointing us since you decided to run for office
@realDonaldTrump He was not talking about President Obama. He was referring to the cheeto stained chunk of shit currently residing in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump STFU. You have done things much much worse. Can't wait for your treason trial.. Muller is coming for you. Hope you are nervous..
@RepAdamSchiff easy for him.. look at his hands..
@TheLastWord Is the money for this failed presidency?
@seanhannity @CNN Did I miss you on his show? Cause it sure sounded like you were describing yourself there.
@hasanthehun were you expecting something else from him?
@WhiteHouse I would rather stab my balls with rusty nails.
@PressSec That and Muller's investigation of the treasonous acts perpetrated by your boss and his family. Will show true gratitude when y'all are in prison.
@realDonaldTrump Did your wittle feelwings get hurted? Do you need a safe place?  Maybe if they do eventually wind up in jail they will come and visit you or one of the others currently being investigated for crimes much more serious.
@JoyAnnReid I would have used the phrase "the stink of shit doesn't travel far from the pile", but I guess yours will work as well.
@PressSec You mean in 2018 when you and the rest of the scum associated with cheeto-stain are gone. Yeah, can't wait. Mueller is coming for you
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @VPPressSec @VPComDir @WhiteHouse @uscapitol @PressSec Look at those four turds..... Did someone forget to flush?
@PressSec we are getting closer every day under Mueller's leadership to taking out that cheeto-stain, you, and all the rest of the traitors currently occupying the White House and Congress. Just wait your turn
@realDonaldTrump Who is Bill and why would I want to get anything "into" him?
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune tax the shit out of rich people and others who are making 100K or more per year and the corporations who are paying them.
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune that it would get better. We the people, are  very tired of people like you: you know, those making millions per year that if you get a tax break, you will invest it in the poorer people. We see it for the bulllsh*t it is. If you really want to help the non-wealthy,
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant much less took a vacation or buy some random useless item. How am I supposed to survive? You tax plan was tried by Reagan (my first time voting and I voted for him), both Bushes ( yes, I voted for them as well )on the promise
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune 2/ Why do I have to pay for rich people (75K or higher yearly income) to get richer? And before I get bombarded by trollls, I pay rent, car insurance, utilities and grocery shop buying the least expensive foods (lots of ramen @ $0.25 per serving) available.
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune Lets get it straight @VP, I am the poor working class making 38K per year. I have 17$ in my checking account and 7$ in savings. I live pay check to paycheck. To pay even 25$ more in taxes every week will sink me faster than Trumps ratings.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes this.. coming from the king of weak and ineffective everything? You lying, pussy grabbing,  pedophile. Shame on you... An even bigger shame is that your daddy's cock wasn't weak and ineffective. Please resign.
@MaddowBlog Imagine what else could have been done with that money..So sad..
@APHealthScience @CarlaKJohnson Hate to burst the bubbles of all you drs, but drug replacement therapy is a sham. want to get some1 you know off the shit? lock 'em to a steel radiator with a blanket, a bucket, &amp; fresh water. best way to detox (5 or 6 days) &amp; after that, support services without more drugs. BTDT
@SarahKSilverman He either got caught messing around with Thumbalina and her four sisters, or someone grabbed him by the pu**y is my best guess.
@foxnewspolitics @AlexPappas I think he meant "in the back".. You know, last behind all the other countries in this world.
@KellyannePolls @MyCentralJersey and how did you explain the need to raise their taxes to lower the taxes of corporations, and the top 1% of the wealthiest?
@realDonaldTrump Bless your heart.. You are a special kind of stupid. I can direct you to a place where they will happily give you a wrap around, self-hugging jackets.. Do you need a list and directions?
@realDonaldTrump Have you typed out the phrase "I RESIGN"  and presented it to someone who can fix the United States yet? If yes, success; If no, please get on that. We know you can do it. k thx bye
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I hope your "major statement" includes the words "I RESIGN"
@PressSec and is this what you see before you shove your head up his ass looking for nuggets of wisdom? https://t.co/v1oanyMw8n
@realDonaldTrump nanny nanny boo boo. You smell like doo doo. See.. We can all be childish at times. The difference is, somehow, you got elected president (you know, all that help from butt-buddy Putin) and are supposedly the leader of the free world.
@realDonaldTrump Dude.. Leave it alone. His cock is way bigger than yours. Doubt it? Look at the size of his hands compared to yours..
@realDonaldTrump Oh, you finally made it to Vietnam. Bone spurs weren't hurting? Did you get a chance to see where John @SenJohnMcCain was held prisoner and tortured while you did whatever you did to avoid going to fight?
@JoyAnnReid get 'em Ms Reid...
@kylegriffin1 and he used "there" for "they're" in a different tweet. I love being grammar police. You?
@realDonaldTrump Russia IS, HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND AND ALWAYS WILL be a true American's enemy. If you are wanting to cozy up to Putin, MOVE there. Putin has ONE goal: to rule the world and your job is to keep him from doing so.
@DebraMessing I was going to reply that no one could be that stupid. Then I remembered you were referring to the cheeto-stain himself Donald  @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I bet you wish you were as highly respected and as powerful a representative of his people. Instead you are just a cheeto stain on the ass of humanity.
@MooreSenate YOU DISGUSTING PERVERTE TURD. Shame on you
@foxnewspolitics @AlexPappas Shame it wasn't his jaw.
@WhiteHouse @VP Excuse me. This lie has caused me to get a little throw up in my mouth.
@WhiteHouse You're shitting me right?  That fuckwad has done ziltch for the United States except racking up huge bills to play golf. Quit you lying. We no longer believe you.
@WhiteHouse Thank you @POTUS44 for your legacy
@chelseahandler @ChrisChristie @PhilMurphyNJ And going to the beach.. woo hoo
@realDonaldTrump Sane citizens of the United States don't embrace you or what you stand for. Why should Ed be any different?
@JoyAnnReid You forgot "All of the above"
@JoyAnnReid me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too! me too!
@JoyAnnReid When one potato in a 50# bag is spoiled, all the rest are suspect. I just throw them all away.
@WhiteHouse and we all know how much the Cheeto Stain loves the trickle.. Shame it didn't work for Reagan or Bush or Bush
@realDonaldTrump Please don't take them all at once.. Pace yourself.
@PressSec just remember, no matter how many people want you to, don't take them all at the same time
@JoyAnnReid Laughing at the headline and the Keebler Elf himself..
@DebraMessing On who? Donald? Never mind, I read that wrong..
@PressSec Oh, is this you returning to a former job as a street walker?
@realDonaldTrump nope, you are are getting out of hand and REAL, TRUE US CITIZENS are tired of your bullsh*t. Rogue employee deserves the Nobel Peace Prize
@realDonaldTrump Give up dud.. You are going down.. No amount of deflecting is gonna change that..(yeah, I called him a dud, not a dude).When r u resigning?
@PressSec This coming from the queen of liars?  That's rich.
@Corbinburnsin Are you cra cra? She is an AWESOME actress.. (said no one ever)
@laurenduca which song do you suggest?
@TomiLahren How long before you vomit up some more bullsh*t in defense of the repugnantcan'ts?
@Alyssa_Milano who do you think will be first?
@realDonaldTrump America is.. They are starting the process of arresting your co-conspirators. Have patience.. they will get to you shortly
@realDonaldTrump I will call it like I see it and am no longer gonna pussyfoot around the truth: You, sir, are a liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar.
@JoyAnnReid Nothing about Trump is good.
@AgentHades this should be sent to @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @PressSec and @SHSanders45  just for shits and giggles
@EricMcCormack no offense, but about time. I was beginning to worry. I log in 2 nf every day and search, but only has the first (of hopefully many) seasons
@PressSec @POTUS Ok then.. it is time to call you out for what you are. LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ittg4KQ0GL
@Evan_McMullin You used the word "incorrect"... Why not call it what it really is: LIE. afaf
@realDonaldTrump Oh, look.. You tweeted about a REAL President (and then lied)
@DebraMessing Jared and Don Jr.?  I want to see the cheeto-stain himself indicted...
@hasanthehun Friend told me to write: Pics or it didn't happen.
@dcexaminer I was gonna call you the queen of lies, but queef of lies seems more appropriate.
@KellyannePolls Bitch..You wouldn't know TRUTH if it grabbed you by the pussy..
@chelseahandler There aren't that many Repugnatcan'ts in Congress.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you to number 44: a real President,  @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump why do you continue to whine and complain about this. Fix the REAL PROBLEM and they will probably stand again. Or RESIGN
@BebeNeuwirth @CBS @MadamSecretary one of the saddest, if not the saddest TV episode I have ever watched. Goodbye Nadine.
@Morning_Joe @Eugene_Robinson what character?
@PressSec Do you kiss your family with that lying mouth or just suck the cheeto stains ass with it?
@realDonaldTrump Orange Glo Trump is the gift that keeps on giving for the Democratic Party, a disaster for Repugnantkants. Watch him in action and IMPEACH
@realDonaldTrump Let me correct this for you: It is 46% of you 32% base. Now that is better..
@realDonaldTrump You gonna release your tax files at the same time?
@realDonaldTrump I would rather that than the orange skinned, puss sucking, piss wearing, scumbag Liar in Chief we have now.
@AP Trump was there?
@realDonaldTrump Explain how you get once in a lifetime? Reagan and both Bushes tried it (all failed). Please resign.. You are an embarressing failure
@laurenduca He is not a bull, he is a hog. so here I will fix what is not broken. Ah, his morning bowel movement, time for some fear-mongering hog shit
@WhiteHouse West Wing staff is smart enough to read? Really?  Maybe they should try reading the Constitution.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Russia sent you more. Prove it didn't..I double dog dare you
@realDonaldTrump can't wait for them to prove it true and that you like to get pissed on. One thing to make it better is your resignation in disgrace.doitnow
@realDonaldTrump Do you believe that if you keep telling that LIE, it eventually becomes true?
@DonaldJTrumpJr At least she went there. You had a sore foot (you can't remember which one, but you had a sore foot)
@realDonaldTrump BULLSHIT!
@realDonaldTrump we need 4 of them surrounding you and you spawn
@realDonaldTrump Thank you President @BarackObama for setting this in motion. Horrible to see that the idiot who took over thinks it is his doing.
@laurenduca That is NOT a forehead.. It is a 5 head. or maybe 6 head
@realDonaldTrump Interesting..My health insurance increased by $120 per month because of that stunt. 1st time in 5 years cost has risen. RESIGN please
@realDonaldTrump So you believe the death of humanity by poisoning our waterways in the US is a good thing? You should have run down your mother's leg.
@realDonaldTrump you are going to be known as the president who killed more Americans than any other REAL president in the history of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump and did you come up with that on your own?
@realDonaldTrump Yes. We all agree you are an insane piece of shit. If you hate this countries people so much, please, resign.
@realDonaldTrump At least they stay inside American borders. Not like your businesses. Pence became a paid protester. Your staff uses private email servers.
@KellyannePolls Saw your statement and thought you were writing about the loser-in-chief again..
@realDonaldTrump If he got only one thing done, he is still one up on you. When is the resignation letter going to be signed?
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecondLady If all the people who don't support you (67%) kneel outside the White house to protest you illegitimacy will you resign? Please
@realDonaldTrump Not that I really want you to, if I beg you to stay president, will you say "NO" and resign? asking for a friend
@realDonaldTrump Hopefully 2020 is the number of years that you and your family get for the treason you have committed. What is the resignation date?
@realDonaldTrump Looks like you are talking about your presidency. If you are, what is the resignation date? I wanna have a party.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews I will always trust @NBCNews MORE than whatever trash you spew. Ranking best presidents 1 (best) to 45 (worst) how did you wind up at 162?
@realDonaldTrump Did you give him your resignation date yet?
@LawyerRogelio @politicususa yoo hooo crypt keeper .@KellyannePolls.  was your broom not working?

@AnneRiceAuthor Happy belly button day in advance. May you have many more.
@realDonaldTrump Are you fucking retarded?
@realDonaldTrump what do you mean "you won't fail"? You already did.
@WhiteHouse but when is he signing his resignation. Soon, the world hopes.
@realDonaldTrump Oh good. You will be flying thru the Bermuda Triangle. There is hope yet. When will you be delivering your resignation letter to Congress?
@realDonaldTrump and just to spite you, I hope EVERY SINGLE PLAYER takes a knee to protest. what is your resignation date? Hope it is soon.
@realDonaldTrump but he was still a Loser. You know all about them. When does your resignation tweet get sent out?
@realDonaldTrump Shame it took you 6 days to respond. Please use this phrase in your next tweet..."I, Donald Trump, am loser scum. I quit."
@jimmykimmel (asking for a friend) can you get twitter to limit lard ass cheeto stain to 7? the phrase from him -I QUIT! - would fit perfectly.
@realDonaldTrump but, he lost. You and he are LOSERS. You just have, among other things, smaller hands.
@realDonaldTrump I stand for this country&amp; I stand for our Constitution, but I also kneel to bring attention to the incessant racism you promote. Take a knee
@realDonaldTrump Why the fuck are you worried about athletes when there are 3M or so AMERICAN CITIZENS dying in Puerto Rico? Are you really that fucked up?
@KellyannePolls @Eagles yeah great song. Shame Trump doesn't believe that what it stands for applies to ALL United States citizens.
@realDonaldTrump Are you jealous that more people pay attention to the NFL than attended your inauguration? What a sad little man you are.
@realDonaldTrump Look: If only you read the Constitution, you would know how asinine your tweet is. If you decide to read it afterall, pay attention to 25.
@realDonaldTrump In case no one has ever said it to you before, let me be the first. SHUT UP you slimy piece of sunken whale shit.
@WhiteHouse Bullshit! You are a bunch of lying motherfuckers. This United States citizen is AGAINST the proposal of the cheeto-stain in chief.
@KellyannePolls @POTUS with all the scum in/around the white house, what did you expect? Personally, I think 9% positive is stretching it. He should resign NOW
@realDonaldTrump I guess that puts you at the end of the line you good for nothing, bigoted, POS. You have never "worked" a day in your pitiful existance.
@FoxNews so sorry.. I have a little throw up in my mouth..
@JoyAnnReid work harder? I work 60 hours a week, get paid for 120 at a time and barely have enough to pay rent and car insurance. Food. what's that?
@AnneRiceAuthor TV series? WHEN?
@realDonaldTrump But, will you follow their suggestions and advice or will you do like you always do and fire ne1 who does not do what you tell them to do?
@JoelOsteen God is watching you turn your back on His children.
@KellyannePolls @CNN @FoxNews @POTUS You watched it times 4? Are you f*.*ing insane. Most people didn't want to see one of him.
@KellyannePolls and you with no honor, no dignity, no self respect and a loser for a boss. Want to play some more?
@ananavarro apostrophes for plurals?
@realDonaldTrump was one of them your decision yo resign? No? Then you failed AGAIN
@realDonaldTrump  Do you really hate this picture? https://t.co/sv4hzj7CXP
@realDonaldTrump I just has the displeasure of watching video of your news conference and I have only this to say,  YOU, SIR, ARE A DICKHEAD
@realDonaldTrump At least they had guts enough to take a stand against YOUR racism and the direction YOU are trying to take this country. Please leave.
@perlmutations and here is how Trump was made https://t.co/RpxBrEOJ67
@KellyannePolls SHUT UP YOU EVIL *^(*^*&amp;&amp;_*&amp;(^*&amp;%
@KellyannePolls and you lost all of your humanity, civility, compassion, integrity and common sense on the cheeto stain's watch. Your point?
@KellyannePolls @WSJ Is your microwave talking to you again?
@KellyannePolls @POTUS I would rather be a poll watcher than a pole dancer like you.
@realDonaldTrump you f**g douche.. Please realize: THIS IS YOUR FAULT. Quit golfing and do something about it. Or do you stand w/your daddy &amp; the KKK?
@amjoyshow @Cirincione He called North Korean leadership "unstable". Why did he not use the same term for our current "leadership" i.e.Trump?
you mis-spoke. It is down to 53%. You stated 43%
@realDonaldTrump Bigger is NOT stronger https://t.co/nFBnuD95Gb
@realDonaldTrump And how much did you pay them to root for you?
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I trust @nytimes before you ANY and EVERY day of existence.
@AnneRiceAuthor @RepAdamSchiff Anne Rice for President.
@KellyannePolls How do you know @KellyannePolls is not telling the truth? Her mouth is open...And yes Kellyanus.. your lies have hurt people
@ABCPolitics @KellyannePolls Do you ever tell the fuc**ng truth?
@KellyannePolls did they at least pay you? Where I am, hand is $15 and blow is $50.
@hardball "work vacation" REALLY? A) he does not know what "work" is, and B) having been given everything in life, he is on a perpetual "vacation".
@foxandfriends @KellyannePolls So are you. So is Fox news. So is Trump. What's your point?
@RogerJStoneJr @ananavarro and you know all about absence of experience and lack of talent. You see a shining example every time you look in the mirror.
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump I hope these links work. https://t.co/XihBXUyiX1 and before you yell fake news: https://t.co/ImPqn2YIP0 just to put it in perspective
@JohnLeguizamo @GeorgeTakei I am not George, but I enjoy following you and by the way.. you can dm me anytime.
@romyreiner EVERY waking moment
@realDonaldTrump Good for you.. Gonna tour a coal mine while you are there? Be the canary.
@Scaramucci Sorry you lost your job today.
@realDonaldTrump Have you signed the Russian sanctions bill yet?
@jfreewright whose ass is bigger? His or trumps? asking for a friend..
@jfreewright and gym.. Don't forget the gym.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS c'mon Kellyanne.. you know better. Except for his ass, nothing on trump is big.. Just look at the size of his hands.
@SugarpussLane @GeorgeTakei Liz Liz Liz, ..bless your heart.  I have heard rumors of this type of ignorance, but reading it on Twitter has made my day..
@realDonaldTrump Oh, you finally made it to the bathroom. I thought you may have been suffering from constipation today..
@KellyannePolls Bidet=fancy French word for Kellyanne Conway waterpic
@Scaramucci @GOPChairwoman @GOP @POTUS Did you use that same language with her that you used for the NYTimes interview?
@realDonaldTrump Keep telling yourself that. It may help you sleep at night.
@realDonaldTrump Which flavor is your favorite of koolaid? The cherry or the grape? asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, so you are not golfing today?
@realDonaldTrump The only outdated thing about our government is you.
@realDonaldTrump only fool I see is you
@KeithOlbermann If only he had run down his mother's leg..
@Scaramucci Oh look. The wicked witch, scarecrow, cowardly lion, and tinman in one place. At least no one had their feet on the couch this time.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls Do like Nancy Reagan said many years ago.. JUST SAY NO.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls let's see..remaining alive with the ACA (Obamacare) or death by Trump and his repugnantcan cohorts. Hmm. Tough decision.
@KellyannePolls @SHSanders45 @OMAROSA you forgot "and lie like a rug cause @KellyannePolls  proves you can get away with it. You know,  alternative facts and fake massacres.
@realDonaldTrump You seem to like to complain about the leakers (except for the hookers) but never deny the leaks. What gives?
@perlmutations "We", meaning me, don't call him that. "We" call him - @realDonaldTrump - the cheeto-stained cock-holster in chief. Just clarifying.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, Hey cock-holster @realDonaldTrump, how much did you and family get from Russia again? Story keeps changing, so asking for a friend.
@ananavarro &lt;&lt; 3612 total days in a row. If I can, anyone can. Just saying.
@HardballChris  if they don't is it disobeying a direct order from commander in chief and  and him ordering it an abuse of power?
@HardballChris Trump is commander in chief and stood on deck of USS Gerald R Ford telling military to call congress to repeal ACA,
@realDonaldTrump Hey cock holster donnie boy @realDonaldTrump hopefully, soon, those repugnentkins of which you speak will grow a set and replace you.
@realDonaldTrump Traitor and cock holster donnie boy @realDonaldTrump probably shouldn't call people names any more. There you go  @RepAdamSchiff
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @Scaramucci Do you mean the message of truth past garbage like @KellyannePolls and @realDonaldTrump ? Is that even possible?
@amjoyshow @JohnHMcWhorter @perlmutations @nytimes PERFECT imitation of of @realDonaldTrump. Thank you for the laughs Mr. Perlman
@KellyannePolls @CNN @Scaramucci @jaketapper Instead of taping that fake news/alternative truth "show", how about taping your mouth closed instead?
@realDonaldTrump Oh yeah, repeal and replace you. Reform taxes so you pay some and do work to the infrastructure so you are driven out and never seen again.
@realDonaldTrump Oh Donnie, bless your heart.. Don't you just LOVE auto-correct.
@realDonaldTrump yeah, so, what about it?
@realDonaldTrump Bless your heart.. Ask them to use you as an example of keelhauling.
@realDonaldTrump You are the one asking about pardons. So, who are you pardoning for "LEAKS"? Could it be that Russian hooker?
@realDonaldTrump Unless you name all these people, so many people, as you put it, will think you are lying (AGAIN). Step up and name them or just STFU.
@PressSec @SHSanders45 @POTUS @WhiteHouse Had to throw out that one last alternative fact (lie), huh?
@WhiteHouse bullshit. everyday you are trying to kill 23 million people, pollute the environment and see how many lies you can get away with. LIARS ALL
@realDonaldTrump Don"t forget to brush your teeth when you are finished - that trip to the emergency may not be covered if you get an infection.
@AnneRiceAuthor possibly the person who polishes the silver or brews the coffee. everyone else seems compromised.
@PressSec @POTUS That was the funniest thing I read today. At what club will you be doing the stand up routine.. I gotta get me some tickets
@realDonaldTrump Not if your name is involved
@realDonaldTrump @USGA Sort of like an amateur is leading our country?
@realDonaldTrump You are inaccurate. Approval rating is at 36% or just 46,376,278 US citizens approve of you out of 128,824,246 votes cast.
@amjoyshow You mean the snowflake @realDonaldTrump may melt if he is not in a safe place?
@realDonaldTrump and that has what to do with a hostile foreign enemy committing an act of war using your son?
@realDonaldTrump It would be nicer if it was also when the impeachment starts to save us from the trump disaster
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for the warning
@realDonaldTrump Ooops. There seem to be too many dots in that statement. I think you meant "us" (you, wife # 3, son, daughter, other son, son-in law.)
@realDonaldTrump For you donnie and your entire clan..	BLESS YOUR HEART
@SethAbramson check your date
@PamelaKGilliam8 @WhiteHouse replace "dimms" with "repugnantcan'ts" and you are closer to the real truth
@JulieGem1 @WatchPresTrump @WhiteHouse and see you in person? f**k that
@laurenduca wine? maybe...maybe not. Chocolate? HELL YEAH
@realDonaldTrump With the first death of someone denied healthcare you, and everyone who votes to repeal, become complicit in murder.
@hardball The only thing I expect of Trump and Putin meet tomorrow is Trump getting brown lipped as he removes them from Putin's ass.
@realDonaldTrump You know all about "Crazy" AND "dumb as a rock"..You see it every time you look in a mirror or at your family
@POTUS We do deserve better and will have it better when you are in jail.

@POTUS Relief soon enough (impending impeachment and all)
@realDonaldTrump I guess the only problem with Camp David is you don't make a profit there?
@realDonaldTrump the Rasmussen Poll is like you and used toilet paper.  Full of sh*t...
@realDonaldTrump read the list here: https://t.co/xJRgK8swDA	Not much very newsworthy compared to your collusion w/ enemy Russia and obstruction case(s).

@DollyParton Simply AMAZING.. You are still so awesome. Would love to see you in concert again.

@ananavarro wait a sec.. the only one to ever volunteer (Katniss) survived..
@DollyParton one of my fondest memories is standing in front of you, listening to you sing bluegrass at the 9:30 Club in D.C.
@realDonaldTrump You did have zero chance of winning until you colluded with the Russians and if you hadn't, the world would not be laughing at you. RESIGN
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump his tweets show his level of intelligence. That makes him around age 6 with a briefcase containing launch codes. Crawl back in your crypt
@hardball @HardballChris was he stoned He had to have been. He at least admitted to the secret mtgs and only someone high would have done that.
@realDonaldTrump It will take way too many years for you to "get smart". Maxwell Smart's only enemy was chaos, and you bring enough of that by yourself. QUIT
@realDonaldTrump You say "whatever", but what if they need you to resign.. Would you do it?
@KeithOlbermann You call him a pathetic old man, I call him an unflushed turd.  tomato/tomahto potato/potahto. And it it the world laughing.
@realDonaldTrump best way to do that is resign
@realDonaldTrump WRONG...SAD.. The bigger story is your stupidity and ignorance.
@KellyannePolls Are you really that stupid or do you have to work at it.. Ruining the reputation of the US of A is not how one makes this country great.
@realDonaldTrump How about this, as it is in your power... QUIT, RESIGN, STEP-DOWN, TAKE A LONG WALK OFF A SHORT PIER, SKY DIVE WITH NO 'CHUTE. ANY WILL WORK
@JustinTrudeau Please don't blame the federal government. It is that piece of shit @realDonaldTrump that made that decision. You know he is an asshole..
@JohnLeguizamo @FBI @NSAGov @CIA @NewYorkFBI I think he has always liked working the back channel. He just didn't want his wife to know.
@TheEllenShow I'll cook dinner for you and Portia if you send me..
@PressSec @POTUS shame most of us cannot afford one..
@realDonaldTrump so Donnie boy, how does it feel to be persecuted as a witch?
@realDonaldTrump and the rest of the world is having a hard time with you, so, suck it up buttercup and play the hand you have been dealt.
@realDonaldTrump look.. one more time. U may be president (BAD), but dems had OVER 3 MILLION MORE votes than U. Putin is laughing at U SINCE YOU R A FAILURE.
@hasanthehun that statement from one of the hottest men on the planet is priceless
@FLOTUS well if I am taking time to remember them, at least that is a few seconds I am not thinking about the scum you married..
@POTUS say their names you cowardly piece of cheeto crumb
@realDonaldTrump You have shown great disrespect of our country, the US of A, by shooting off your mouth. What should we do about that?
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to apologize to all those who died for your dodging the draft? SAD COWARD
@realDonaldTrump Since you dodged the draft, does that mean you were not brave? SAD
@chrislhayes Please NO!!! Make it stop...
@realDonaldTrump Who is your cell phone carrier?
@realDonaldTrump the real story is you are an idiot who has committed treason, alienated out allies and spewed filth and hatred for far too long. Resign pls
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine "There is a leaker in the in the White House". Is she standing over Donnie? If so, pay her so she will leave.
@dcexaminer Well look at that.. Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the US...How convenient..
@KellyannePolls @HillaryClinton WTF are you talking about and WHY are you talking about it? Sit down and let the grown ups talk. Better yet, go back to your crypt.
@realDonaldTrump Keep lying like that and even your nose will be bigger than your hands.
@MeetThePress If the leaks are "close" to treason, does that mean what is being leaked about is the "actual" treason? asking for a freind
@realDonaldTrump Same kind of scum you are. If the opinion is different "Beat him up"?
@realDonaldTrump successful in that you sold weapons to the people who blew up the twin towers or insulting our allies? Possible the Paris climate accords?
@realDonaldTrump It is not the media's fault you and your family and your cronies are scum. They are calling it like they and the rest of us see it.
@HallieJackson @NBCNews @NBCNewsPR @NBCNightlyNews @locamama @staceypklein @KellyO @kristindonnelly @kwelkernbc Chicks? REALLY?
@PressSec @POTUS We know you get a salary, but do you get extra bonus money for each extra lie you tell?
@PressSec @POTUS That was a short briefing
@KellyannePolls From the Washington Slimes? Really. Don't you have anything better to do? Line maybe get a mani-pedi. Keep your toes from typing more bs.
@realDonaldTrump I was wondering how long it would be before this LIE was tweeted. Don't you have anything better to do, i.e TELL THE TRUTH?
@realDonaldTrump You mean first on your list won't be your resignation?
@FLOTUS @USArmy Nice that you are finally standing with a REAL man (men)..
@KellyannePolls see.. I can come up with bull shit too..
@KellyannePolls Let's carry it a step further. You had your feet on the citizens furniture so that makes you guilty because your boss Trump is a loser.
@realDonaldTrump No, you did not. You took your family of crooks on a world vacation using U.S. citizen's money instead of your own.
@realDonaldTrump Gallup has you at 39%. I trust Gallup more since anything you "like" is bound to be alternative facts
@IngrahamAngle Ask the same question when our flags fly half-staff.. I dare you.
@jfreewright sorry, can't resist...too funny not to.. https://t.co/hy3DJmvTBl
@KellyannePolls You wouldn't know wisdom if it bit you on the ass. Then again, wisdom would not know where to start..
@hardball @realDonaldTrump Is his continuing use of the below symbol intentional? He uses it all the time https://t.co/Rx96k9dtOa
@Corbinburnsin https://t.co/a9AaVKGYA6
@realDonaldTrump Forget it Donnie... They have an extradition treaty with the United States
@realDonaldTrump HA HA HA. Funny. Normally I would tell the bad jokester to not quit his day job but, in your case, I will make an exception. Please resign.
@realDonaldTrump Don't EVER compare yourself with Former PRESIDENT Obama OR former First Lady Clinton. You are not in their class and never will be.
@realDonaldTrump Were the words "I resign" included?
@PressSec @POTUS Have you no integrity?
@realDonaldTrump @LibertyU wow.. more people there than your inaguration
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews I will wait for a REAL trial before a REAL judge for your REAL impeachment and imprisonment. just saying..
@realDonaldTrump And you continually denying it is your excuse for being a loser.
@realDonaldTrump Did you take the time to announce your resignation? If not, then I won't waste my time.
@KellyannePolls Wish your dad had
@realDonaldTrump Democrats are ashamed. They are ashamed they have to call you Mr. President. After all, you lost the popular vote by more than 2 million.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah.. Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep at night..
@aravosis Nevermind.. He corrected his spelling in the 7:43 am tweet
@aravosis Interesting.. that tweet is still in my feed but at 7:43 am, not 7:14 am. Still that POS needs to go to jail though
@realDonaldTrump You answered it yourself..#FakeNews!
@CR BULLSHIT. Nothing about that orange turd is good
@realDonaldTrump All these tweets from you.. You must be VERY nervous that you are about to be caught and arrested for treason.
@realDonaldTrump Look you treasonous scum.. Give it up.. No one believes you anymore. Can't wait for your arrest  for treason.
@POTUS you probably mentioned it out loud while eating chocolate cake in Florida.
@realDonaldTrump When you delete your twitter account , are in an orange jumpsuit serving a life sentence waiting for your execution as a traitor. maybe then
@realDonaldTrump If we are lucky, he will pick up bags of poodle poop to throw at you. If we are REALLY lucky, you will have your mouth open at the time.
@realDonaldTrump Like your clothing line?
@KellyannePolls @POTUS @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Yo Cryptkeeper..Crawl back into your coffin..Maybe then you will stop watching Faux news.
@realDonaldTrump oh you poor wittle snowfwake.. does the troof hurt much. Putin has some candy for you. Reach in his pocket (your safe place) and grab it.
@DebraMessing Less people to speak out against that turd
@realDonaldTrump As a master with the skill, you know all about defending lies..Where are your tax forms? LIAR/SCUM
@realDonaldTrump Pot and kettle much?
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @TheDemocrats Better question.. Who should we consider the leader of the republican party?
@realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation Thank you for that advanced warning. I guess I will take the time to scrub my toilet after all..Much more enjoyable and informative. FAILURE
@realDonaldTrump BULLSHIT
@realDonaldTrump to keep you from destroying them?. Fuck yeah
@WhiteHouse @FLOTUS Has she moved into the White House yet or are we (the American taxpayers) still funding you marriage separation?
@realDonaldTrump Look you lying cheeto stain.It is more than time you get your facts straight and stop bombarding twitter with your bullshit.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS Bullshit. He has done nothing worth noting in his hopefully last 100 days
@realDonaldTrump wipe your ass and get off the toilet.
@POTUS @SecretarySonny @USDA 3)he had improperly used one of his family business‚Äôs airplanes on campaign for which the Commission fined the sitting governor. Nice choice
@POTUS @SecretarySonny @USDA 2) ruled against Perdue twice, finding that Perdue had taken improper campaign contributions from donors including SunTrust Banks, and that
@POTUS @SecretarySonny @USDA 1) During his governorship, the Georgia State Ethics Commission received thirteen complaints against Perdue. The State Ethics Commission
@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump https://t.co/Ck3YiEDNcz
@realDonaldTrump Are you planning on bombing them too?
@realDonaldTrump better dig deep in your own fucking pocket 'cause I surely don't want to pay for it.
@CR @dbongino Nah.. Cheeto stain is bigger
@realDonaldTrump I call BS on this. You will NEVER win the popular vote. Just like YOU didn't win the electoral vote. Russia won the electoral vote for you.
@realDonaldTrump beat Hillary in what? Fails? Definitely NOT the popular vote
@realDonaldTrump Lying Cheeto Stain.. If it fails, it is because of YOU, the biggest loser..
@realDonaldTrump No, you are WRONG.  The "stupidest idea EVER"  money was supposed to come from Mexico.
@FLOTUS @POTUS @WhiteHouse Who were they?
@POTUS So much more beautiful once your impeachment is over..And EPA is refunded.
@realDonaldTrump Instead of having a wife in New York and you going to your compound in Fl, send the saved TAXPAYER money to Flint MI. Clean H2O is important
@realDonaldTrump You are a fracking idiot. How dare you state that while reopening the coal mines, continuing the Dakota and Keystone pipelines. POLLUTER
@chelseahandler @SarahPalinUSA They're creepy and they'er kookie, mysterious and spookie,  they're all together ewww-kie
@realDonaldTrump Guess that means we don't buy your's or your daughter's  shit anymore..Not that I would ever stoop that low.
@GOPin2020 @Tooda @realDonaldTrump Maybe if Pres stop lying, cheating, stealing, breaking the laws, blaming everyone but himself &amp; aligning with Russia... fixed it 4 u
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt So you can tell MORE lies on a fake tv network?
@realDonaldTrump as a criminal yourself, don't you want someone to protect you? Oh, wait, .. You have the republicans in congress for that..
@realDonaldTrump The Fake Pres (not Real Pres) has gotten even worse since the election. There, I fixed it for you..
@POTUS Is that for the winner of the popular vote and the millions who did not vote for you as well as all the reporters reporting your lies? AFAF
@realDonaldTrump It would be happier if you would release your tax returns/stop lying/stop bombing $hit/stop using orange stain and calling it a tan..
@realDonaldTrump before or after you blow up the world while having a temper tantrum because you did not win the popular vote?
@realDonaldTrump Yo Cheeto Stain.. Just so you know..the issue of your tax returns was never put down.
@realDonaldTrump well, we've looked into it.. It was paid for by the same people who pay for your trips to FL. Individual tax paying citizens of America.
@CR I can't seem to find any of CR's remarks on Trump's bombing of Iraq? err umm Syria?
@realDonaldTrump Why do you continue to post stupid shit on Twitter? You know you are not gonna get the response you want.
@PressSec Isn't this the kind of stuff Camp David is for?
@foxnewspolitics Takes one to know one...
@realDonaldTrump Please ask President Bannon to take away your twitter account
@realDonaldTrump Did you ever apologize for being born?
@realDonaldTrump weren't you the one being leaked on? Remember the golden showers expose'...
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews "me thinks thou doth protest too much." How apropos..Here is something NOT fake: YOU ARE A LYING TRAITOR. GET OUT OF OUR HOUSE
@realDonaldTrump STFU YOU LYING TRAITOR. YOU R A SELL OUT TO THOSE WHO VOTED FOR YOU Can't wait to hold an impeachment party &amp; celebrate your jail sentence.
@BreitbartXM How about they arrest President Bannon and his sidekick first. Then worry about the sancuary city officials. Makes more sense.
@realDonaldTrump sort of like the oil in the Keystone pipeline?  Oh wait, .. that comes from Canada.
@realDonaldTrump because we know it is just another of you lies..
@realDonaldTrump They are a little busy at the moment. They  have more pressing issues to deal with atm. You know presidential sized issues
@realDonaldTrump Actually, I am smiling because you are being shown as the failure you have always been. LOSER..TRAITOR
@realDonaldTrump America was ALREADY great. If you do not think so, why not leave?
@realDonaldTrump So you could not kill millions of people with your healthcare bill so you are going to do it by poisoning the water? SMH
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump drip drip drip..?  More like a shower.
@CR @benshapiro could it be be because everything about this president and his affiliates is criminally scandalous? Sorry I voted for him.
@IvankaTrump How would you suggest supporting them? Maybe do like daddy and send 'em back to where they came from?
@LadyWelker why was your lady neighbor at your house when you were not home?
@WoahitsWelker @LadyWelker see your face book message for my identity. Please do not state it here. It is a secret..
@WoahitsWelker @LadyWelker ok, Now what?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Then quit going to Mar-A-Largo every weekend and be a man: get your wife under control and out of NY and back to DC.
@realDonaldTrump That's it? SAD!! I see more people at the local Kmart on a Tuesday afternoon..
@wrege_e @SnortonParker @JoanaBrumley @OfficialSPGB is that what you see every time you look in a mirror?
@POTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Great! another dog and pony show on a fake news station. SAD!!! Make sure the microwave is not in the room.
@jimmyjamesroz @LadyMAGAMagic @OwnYourWallet @DanScavino @Scavino45 @maddow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump not all: I for one regret I voted Trump
@LadyMAGAMagic @OwnYourWallet @DanScavino @Scavino45 @maddow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump nah.need a non cheetos stained idiot runnng the country
@ROBERTW15943296 @business WRONG..President Bannon and his  Cheetos-stained sidekick are the traitors.  Impeach them both to MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Dear CheetoStain, Yes, we think that can happen If your crypt keeper KAC can believe microwaves spy. You are the only FAKE.
@LadyMAGAMagic @OwnYourWallet @DanScavino @Scavino45 @maddow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and they all voted for the cheeto stain
@DanScavino @maddow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump not until he makes Russia great again first, or so it seems. SAD
@JoyAnnReid @Twitter If they install one, we will never see how much of an idiot the cheeto stain is. He, too, will edit his tweets !!
@GeorgeTakei only 40?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Why are we, the American ppl,  paying 3M of our tax $ for you to play golf every weekend when you contribute none?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I would rather eat broken glass and wash it down with poison.
@realDonaldTrump So, when you are getting a golden shower from one, do you grab her by the pussy?
@POTUS have you grabbed any "by the pussy" lately?
@realDonaldTrump Do you live in this reality? Do you ever tell the truth? Do you know how to tell the truth? SAD
@realDonaldTrump and you know what it is like to be a "complete and total disaster since you have been one since birth..
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thought you may be interested in this. Truth hurts, huh? SAD
@hardball @AprilDRyan what mind are you referring to?
@hardball @PressSec @PeterAlexander another non-answer to a direct question..SAD
@DanScavino If you believe, like cheeto stain does, that Briebart news is real news, I feel sorry for you as well. SAD. Briebart News=FAKE
@realDonaldTrump so few remaining supporters.. ready to resign yet?
@KeithOlbermann https://t.co/FEUut3WRUJ
@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump glad someone captured this before it disappeared forever
@realDonaldTrump is it true that you are doing everything you can to deflect b/c you are guilty of being a traitor? Is that possible?
@BenSasse If there were taps, it was most likely Putin making sure his cheeto stained bitch was behaving.
@KFILE and the Russian psyco-phants running our government will do anything to keep the cheeto stain in power by creating lies to deflect.
@KeithOlbermann nah.. He will wind up as a "boy" bitch in a Federal prison somewhere..
@VP @AP so how, exactly, does that pose a risk to your security?
@Chandra131313 and you tell me to use MY brain? Step away from the koolaid and look at the FACTS. He is a traitor for colluding w/ Putin.
@Chandra131313 @CR @SteveDeaceShow  HE IS THE COCKROACH
@ErnstBoch @KellyannePolls You love this "crypt keeper" eww gross...
@KellyannePolls New meaning of H.U.D.:  helping undo democracy..
@realDonaldTrump NO, IT IS PATHETIC THAT YOU CHOSE SUCH TRASH TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS. YOU AND THE LOT ARE TRAITORS. RESIGN CHEETO STAIN
@BreitbartXM yep..more people to ridicule (vets) and more to kill (military)..
@POTUS Yes, it was historical. Never have so many lies been told in such a short period of time.
@foxnewspolitics For most people, afterglow comes from great sex. President Cheeto stain's sex includes golden showers. REMEMBER?
@WhiteHouse Person posting https://t.co/QkrSqqV3ft do realize America also includes Canada and Mexico?  We are citizens of the US OF A
@WhiteHouse @RepKenBuck Most citizens of the U.S. were optimistic. Then, Bannon and his cheeto-stained side-kick were elected.
@WhiteHouse @SenMajLeader Unify The U.S behind the impeachment of President TRAITOR. Backwards is not a good direction to go though. js
@WhiteHouse @SteveDaines yes, creating coal jobs to pollute the planet even more, totally dumb down the American children &amp; safe from what?
@WhiteHouse @KenCalvert which ones? The promise to kill the planet? The one to get the whole world to hate the U.S.A?
@WhiteHouse @RepJeffDuncan Are you only 40 days old? You look more like 50 so I find it hard to believe your statement.
@WhiteHouse @repdavidkustoff Did we watch the same speech?
@POTUS since you seem to be the biggest nightmare in America at the moment, does that mean you are resigning to free our dreams?
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS Because everyone else thinks he is a cheeto stained idiot.
@realDonaldTrump I would rather eat broken glass and razor blades with a large side of poison.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/gE6PsgHcMO
@POTUS Just because you post it multiple times does not make your statement true. Fake president.
@realDonaldTrump It is NOT fake news, you are a fake president
@POTUS Coward
@realDonaldTrump NO, THE REAL SCANDAL IS THAT YOU ARE A TRAITOR. CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE AN IMPEACHMENT PARTY FOR YOU. RESIGN YOU CHEETO STAIN.
RT @Alifaith55: TRUMP is apparently very ANNOYED by this picture of #PresidentBannon on the cover of Time. 		We can only return the favour‚Ä¶
RT @KeithOlbermann: Attention, #FakePresident @realDonaldTrump: Shut. Your. Fucking. Mouth. https://t.co/PGJUvTdkj4
@realDonaldTrump IS THIS FOR YOUR IMPEACHMENT?
@realDonaldTrump If POTUS doesn't allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a alternate point of view: NO FED FUNDS?
@WoahitsWelker whose mother?
@Corbinburnsin you gotta see this.. True FAIL 	https://t.co/ojGF42duOl
@maddow https://t.co/ojGF42duOl
@KellyannePolls is this another example of "alternative facts"? Or as the majority of non-trumpians calls them...LIES?
@PressSec you gonna tell us more lies?
@realDonaldTrump  But who is on the National Security Council as of 12:01 pm tomorrow?
@MaddowBlog wow.. That looks more real that that fake ass Trump..
@realDonaldTrump  Great job.. Bayer AG was one of 4 companies that helped kill off 1000s of hemophiliacs in the US..
@RealDonldTrunp @CNN Still more trustworthy than you
@KellyannePolls will (can) you provide the Executive Orders by year and number?
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Opinions are like assholes and since you look at one in a mirror everyday, ...
I guess "swamp" is just another euphemism for penis now? #GoldenShowers
