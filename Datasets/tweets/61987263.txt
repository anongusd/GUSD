@kthalacker @adamjohnsonNYC people who witnessed the commotion/aftermath, the police on block, the clerk who said he was glad to see police presence given crime in area, shoplifting, tip jars stolen etc. the store employees at one store confirmed incident, there was video. they couldn't talk on record.
@adamjohnsonNYC @kthalacker fair enough. in future i will take this into consideration. you raise good point. the tabloid media practice of posting mugshots after arrest/ before conviction started when Internet news did. perhaps it should be revisted. mugshots only published for felonies not misdemeanors.
@kthalacker @adamjohnsonNYC as for adversarial sources, it's not always easy to track down person arrested or their lawyer but we do make an effort. victims of crimes are often more vocal. i read your full story and appreciate the time and effort that went into it. thanks.
@kthalacker @adamjohnsonNYC they are not "press releases", it's community alerts. shoplifter story was not from a release, had sources from witnesses, worker on block who'd had tip jar stolen plus context into new bike patrols. mugshot was provided b/c charges were felonies, not misdemeanors

@micahuetricht @jensabella @Alderman_Moreno "It's not a public meeting." It was a mtg to introduce a revised version of a proposed tower.
@TwoCentAlan @BlockClubCHI It was a meeting to talk about a revised version of a tower that had already had at least two prior public meetings. If it had never been introduced before, I could understand a closed door meeting
@basilialukos @BlockClubCHI a revised version of this. https://t.co/fatHKHWoZw
update: meeting still going on but Moreno left. Jumped into an Uber or Lyft so fast I didn't get a pic.  He said, "This was not a public meeting." FWIW topic of mtg is a tower plan I've written about before. Developers showing a revised plan. https://t.co/WBx6jorBIN
