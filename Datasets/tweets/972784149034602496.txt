@academic_degn @EdKrassen The basis and the extent of this is fundamentally different then the act has been used for in the past.

@aharonml123 @GC36054719 @SecPompeo @KingSalman @realDonaldTrump A state sanctioned murder in a fellow NATO nation is something that we should be concerned about. Especially considering this individuals strong ties to the United States.
@GC36054719 @SecPompeo @KingSalman @realDonaldTrump And this is tragic, illegal immigration needs to be controlled. However, the fact remains that the majority of illegals are VISA overstays and that illegal immigration at the border has been declining for years. A wall is not the way to fix this problem.
@GC36054719 @SecPompeo @KingSalman @realDonaldTrump Where was @senatemajldr at? The house passed a bill, the senate refused to vote on it

@GC36054719 @SecPompeo @KingSalman @realDonaldTrump Trump bragged and that he was going to shut down the government then shut down the government. It‚Äôs exactly what he wanted. None of which is relative to #Khashoggi whom @realDonaldTrump has no interest in getting justice for. One side of the legislative branch cannot override him
@SecPompeo How are you going to hold the Saudi regime accountable for the state sanctioned murder of #Khashoggi?
@GC36054719 @SecPompeo @KingSalman The house only has so much power, right now they can‚Äôt even get the government open because of @realDonaldTrump
@SecPompeo @KingSalman What about justice for #Khashoggi?
@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Sure but in the mean time we shouldn‚Äôt be selling you 100 million in weapons
@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump We abide by the Geneva Convention and when we don‚Äôt we hold those individuals accountable.

@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Yes justify your wrongs by pointing out the misgivings of others. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right

@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump So what‚Äôs your story, Saudi didn‚Äôt kill him or they are justified in killing him?
@Scumbagus_Rex @Alotaib661 @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Alright so can Saudi start killing people on American soil? Are our green card holders open season when they travel? How about Americans that travel abroad? Just whatever you don‚Äôt speak out against Saudi Arabia or they are allowed to kill you, no matter where you are?
@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump It is the regime, not the man. They all need to go.
@Alotaib661 @Scumbagus_Rex @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Look I get it, you don‚Äôt want to speak out against @KingSalman because you watched what happened to #JamalKhashoggi after he criticized the regime. But the world knows and @realDonaldTrump won‚Äôt be there to protect the regime forever, 2020 is coming fast

@Alotaib661 @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump I know your government keeps changing their story every week, and that every halfway competent person  understands that it was ordered by @KingSalman. State sanctioned murder on foreign soil cannot go unpunished
@Alotaib661 @USAinKSA @StateDept @KingSalman @SecPompeo As the King who ordered it goes unpunished because @realDonaldTrump is more worried about his arms deal then ensuring human rights
@USAinKSA @StateDept @SecPompeo What about justice for #JamalKhashoggi?

@CKaronka @JackKingston @AOC A lot more than zero Republicans too. My point is both parties have a ton of members taking paychecks despite the government being shutdown. So instead of calling one out individually because he has a man crush he should be calling them all out

@krassenstein Makes you wonder what White Evangelical Christians really stand for if they are OK with someone bragging about committing sexual assault
@greenerytx @splats62 @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump 1. Number two polluter in the World is the United States. 	2. China is not ‚Äúexempt‚Äù until 2030. Educate yourself on how CO2 emissions work and what they agreed to. https://t.co/AQhhIzZvgU

@EdKrassen Instead of we should invest that money into border security options that will actually do something! #NoWall #EndTrumpShutdown
@GOP supporters being proud of the fact that they raised 20 million dollars for a wall that @realDonaldTrump promised Mexico would pay for pretty much sums up the GOP‚Äôs convoluted mentality #NoWall #EndTrumpShutdown
@reif_james @ABC They must proactively choose to do or money gets automatically refunded. Because now it‚Äôs going to a fraud charity because they admitted they had no way to get this money to the federal government and just lied about being able to do so for donations https://t.co/FzWOeSRJ6l
@GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump Where‚Äôs @SenMajLdr at???
@reif_james @ABC No the 20M will be refunded and users have the option to re-donate it into the new go fund me that puts it into a 501c. But that 20M is being sent back to the people that originally donated it. No guarantee all those people re donate. Sounds like it‚Äôs falling apart to me

@GOP ‚ÄúLacks requisite policy knowledge and experience‚Äù... you know who your guy is right???
@JackKingston Or he could just reopen the government?
@AOC @GOP acts like it‚Äôs impossible to overturn a veto, this shutdown for an archaic wall falls on them too #NoWall #EndTheShutdown

@JackKingston No @realDonaldTrump still refuses to reopen the government. He had a bill to sign and he refused to. Plus he asked to receive blame for this shutdown, so I will keep blaming him #NoWall #TrumpShutown
@RepKevinBrady Yes we tax the rich more, but we are still taxing them far less then we have historically. And at a time that we have a huge national deficit that makes no sense

@joncoopertweets An insanely dangerous precedent
@KungFunny @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sure we will see, but if the courts let this stand the Constitution is in crisis. Could Trump then declare a national emergency for immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities? How about for drug policy enforcement? Where does it stop?
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Neither is executive overreach. The Constitution still matters
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS No one believes you and you aren‚Äôt getting your wall. Stop holding the American people hostage for a ridiculous campaign promise that you promised MEXICO WOULD WRITE A CHECK FOR! #NoWall #EndTheTrumpShutdown
@KungFunny @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Maybe not? An obvious Constitutional overreach will be acted on by at least one judge. If not you can just shred the Constitution

@RepBuddyCarter You claim that the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt yet in the two years your party has been in the majority of every branch they have effectively doubled the national deficit. If the GOP remains the majority why is that going to change? #AskBuddy
@Brazilian_bikin @CNN Politics is a like a pendulum, it swings back and forth history has shown us that repeatedly. Couple that with the fact the Dems chose the worst possible candidate to face Trump and this is what you get. But on the sixth America will speak loud and clear about Trump and the GOP
