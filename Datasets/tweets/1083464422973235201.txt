@TrumpinTheShark @GOPChairwoman A child molester? Do you have proof no one else has seen?

@DrLeanaWen Go to hell.
@bradheath @USATODAY So they brought in a convicted liar?
@KateAurthur @TuckerCarlson You‚Äôre a piece of shit Kate.
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow Democrats are the ones who are against free speech just so we‚Äôre clear. https://t.co/GrPYXpbvA2
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow I don‚Äôt even know what that means. Rather than putting words in my mouth and claiming them as fact, maybe you should find where I said those things.
@Josh_Moon Josh, I think you‚Äôre stupid if you think that slightly smaller refunds offsets people keeping more of their hard earned money year-round. You‚Äôre worse at political analysis than sports analysis (and that‚Äôs saying something)
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow I don‚Äôt remember saying or implying either of those things.
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow They were kneeling during the national anthem of the United States. So therefore, they were protesting the United States of America whether they say so or not.
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow Saying fuck you to a white guy named Seth is racist? Odd...
@sethbryan_06 @mattmurphyshow Fuck you Seth!
@beejoeshay @_mackiee @neariahfx @haneenbabee Nah we would hypothetically just be dead. So no problem either way.

@AP Bending the truth? Are you serious? The media and liberal celebrities are LIARS! We know it and they know it.
@aidan_again @CloydRivers Both.
@naijagym Yes.
@Pamela_Yap @FrMatthewLC Say it louder for the liberals that obsessively criticize and insult him no matter what he does in the back
@GQMagazine Hahahaha yet another liberal #FAKEVICTIM
@ABC Y‚Äôall still trying to make him the victim huh?
@andrewklavan Simply put, liberalism is a mental disorder.
@secupp How is capital punishment unjust? You murder someone for no reason and you get murdered. Seems pretty even and just to me.
@Dreamer0fTheDay @realDailyWire He did say no, you can invent your own beliefs but you can‚Äôt invent your own facts.
@Newsweek FAKE
@RealSaavedra She is a foul excuse for a human being. She is an ugly dog who can hardly read.

@JerryDunleavy Hell is a place where there is no reason. Hell is a place where there is no knowledge. Hell is a place where there is no logic. Every time this fool speaks he takes us all closer to hell.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt know Ryan, is it not true? He can tweet against the terrorist regime in Iran whenever he wants for whatever reason he wants. #MAGA
@cananyonecme Liberalism is a mental disorder.
@TheDaleJackson There‚Äôs never any consequences for the way politicians and media behave (slander, willful lying, etc.) but okey dokey.

@DougJones ü§¢ü§ÆI can‚Äôt wait for the day that I vote you out of office.
@Sharon_Moore60 @Digby_C @GOPChairwoman @GOP Well I think having a KKK blackface photo on your med school yearbook page is pretty ignorant.
@Sharon_Moore60 @Digby_C @GOPChairwoman @GOP Well I‚Äôll stick with GOP today rather than KKK VA governor. But you do you Sharon.
@Digby_C @GOPChairwoman @GOP Northam on the other hand, is not as well known and it just was realized that he posed in a picture in blackface with a KKK dressed person and Confederate insignia so mislabeling him a Republican will automatically reflect poorly on Republicans.
@Digby_C @GOPChairwoman @GOP Really, you found that fox might have done this 11 years ago and that‚Äôs your rebuttal? Are you actually that dumb or are you paid to be libtarded? One major difference is that McCain was the most well known republican in the country and he hadn‚Äôt done something abhorrent recently

@rachelnix_poet @reckonalabama Birmingham is not under republican control. Nor is Mobile or Montgomery.
@rachelnix_poet @reckonalabama Nope, areas in AL with most gun deaths are the most liberal.
@StephenKellett7 THEY ARE VICTIMS! They were literally lied about, verbally abused, received death threats, couldn‚Äôt attend school yesterday and have been attacked by a social media mob for days! They did NOTHING WRONG! Quit being a knee-jerk liberal for once and see the truth!
@StephenKellett7 @MattWalshBlog I never had any questions. The Covington boys treated Phillips with more respect than he deserves because they are honorable children of Christ. I have better things to do than judge them and hold up Nathan Phillips a criminal liar. If he‚Äôs who you choose to heroize so be it.
@StephenKellett7 @MattWalshBlog Okay, and the Covington kids behaved as good as one could expect for someone at that age. They acted with more love and maturity than every adult in the video. I judge adults who behave worse than children more than children who behave like children.
@StephenKellett7 @MattWalshBlog Christians should show people respect but it doesn‚Äôt mean you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it. Respect from others is earned and being a liar is the biggest way to lose it. Nathan is a horrible person and deserves to be treated as such. It‚Äôs impressive how much respect was shown to him.
@RealSaavedra The only Israelites she‚Äôs ever defended
Isaiah 5:20 ‚ÄúWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil‚Äù
Liberals have truly ruined our once great country and ripped its heart out (godly morals) completely. We are morally deficient as a country and have no compass for what is right other than what the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù tell us. Truth is dying around us and no one even blinks an eye. https://t.co/ctPXRhc5oM
@PPNYCAction Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil.
@IlhanMN Shut up you stupid, inbreeding liar. Liars burn in hell and this tweet has more levels of lying and misrepresentation than I can count. I hope you know your fake savior Muhammad the rapist won‚Äôt save you from the eternal flames Ilhan.
@gnarmigiana @Falafelhunter @MattWalshBlog @AnnCoulter Because he‚Äôs a liberal and is that simple minded
@HashtagGriswold CNN
@JamesMartinSJ Better question. Why is it James Martin‚Äôs business what they were wearing and why? And why does he feel it‚Äôs his authority to bring into question the students perfectly acceptable choice of hat?
@MattWalshBlog @BillKristol How honorable and noble of your leader
@rezaaslan It was, as it is clearly not backed up by any facts. You may want to get your mental disorder (liberalism) checked on so you can stop hearing things.
@coachbrucepearl Democrats: The party of anti-semitism.
@EvaThom88737624 @Trent_Horn Wrong. No one chanted ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù Eva. Maybe you should know what you‚Äôre talking about before you baselessly accuse students of saying something. You‚Äôre false accusations against people in the faith isn‚Äôt Christlike.
@JamesMartinSJ Please delete this unbelievably idiotic and misguided statement and come to an enlightened, educated conclusion to this incident. Please don‚Äôt ridiculously trash children in the faith while simultaneously holding up this instigating fool and please stop being a knee-jerk liberal.
@britbowen09 @RamsNFL Refs horrible no call(s) directly affected outcome of game. That‚Äôs outrageous for a game of this magnitude. But war eagle anyways haha
@JesusMeza316 @SaintsNOW How did the Vikings season go?
@britbowen09 @RamsNFL It is harder to make a play when you‚Äôre being tackled by a defender not even looking for the ball. The Saints could have been better of course but if the refs made that call, Saints win.
@britbowen09 @RamsNFL *NFL refs
@RaymondArroyo @drewbrees @Saints I‚Äôm with you Raymond. Next year!

@SenSanders So your complaint is that wages are up???
@BuzzFeedNews ZERO journalistic integrity
@KyleCoroneos My favorite Willie Nelson album.
@benshapiro Their credibility is already toast you dumbass. How many times do they have to lie and deceive before you start seeing that their job is to bullshit.
@Vote4milhouse @benfergusonshow Wow, you‚Äôre obviously an incredible original thinker, It‚Äôs not like we heard all that shit spewed on @cnn and the like everyday.
@QHajara @CNN Hahaha you‚Äôre so ignorant, please find a better and more reasonable religion which doesn‚Äôt push such idiotic beliefs as yours.
@steelerluvr61 @glennbeck If we weren‚Äôt a morally bankrupt country arrests would have already been made.
@GayAlienBatman @MatildaSwallows @MrE_2099 @splashy79 @PoliticalKathy Fair point. A lot of factors have led to this degeneration of our culture in this sense. Hopefully those of us who see these problems in our generation will choose to not make the same mistakes. Have a good day sir.
@GayAlienBatman @MatildaSwallows @MrE_2099 @splashy79 @PoliticalKathy Their hopes and feelings don‚Äôt change the facts of the matter though. I personally feel bad for a lot of single mothers. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that their our dire societal consequences to so many children only being raised by their mother.
@GayAlienBatman @MatildaSwallows @MrE_2099 @splashy79 @PoliticalKathy Statistics aren‚Äôt a coincidence and they are reflective of the problem(single-parenting) not the time period. https://t.co/VoTrKaGpRr
@MatildaSwallows @MrE_2099 @splashy79 @PoliticalKathy According to the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, children from single-parent families account for 63 percent of all youth suicides, 70 percent of all teenage pregnancies, 71 percent of all adolescent chemical/substance abuse and 80 percent of all prison inmates.
