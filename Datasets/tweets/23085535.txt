@TailsP42069 @JordanUhl @JuddEisenberg @sultandosamba Cop out non answer. Explain how Israel would defend itself against mass terrorist attacks in your scenario. Israel doesn‚Äôt want to let Hamas commit crimes in the first place in order to try them! That won‚Äôt bring back the scores of victims of attacks!
@TailsP42069 @JordanUhl @JuddEisenberg @sultandosamba It‚Äôs horrible. And hamas is to blame for holding them all hostage. It‚Äôs easy to criticize Israel, but practically what would you have them do? Please propose a solution that keeps Israelis safe while allowing Gazans full freedom of movement.
@TailsP42069 @JordanUhl @JuddEisenberg @sultandosamba Please define genocide. 53 of the 62 killed were confirmed terrorists, in a crowd of thousands. That‚Äôs called precision targeting by the IDF. Where‚Äôs the genocide?
@TailsP42069 @JordanUhl @JuddEisenberg @sultandosamba Hamas is an imminent and lethal safety risk. They are literally attempting to cross the border with weapons in hand in order to slaughters Israelis living just meters from the border. The murders would be instantaneous.

@marcorubio Quoting scripture is nice, but when Moses started to pray as the Egyptians were closing in on him, our Jewish tradition teaches that God yelled at him to stop praying and do something! So stand up and oust a delusional, narcissistic President!
@nytimes No, you didn‚Äôt normalize a Nazi sympathizer. You normalized a NAZI!
@DanScavino @19Vesey @NYRangers Stay away from our Rangers! New Yorkers voted 9 to 1 against that Sexual Offender in Chief you work for and continue to defend. Maybe the Predators would be a more appropriate team to root for!
Pelosi has to go. There can be no tolerance or partisan hypocrisy when it comes to sexual assault.

@senrobportman Taking away their health care to give millions to the top 1% seems like the most sensible next step.
@MooreSenate I agree, it‚Äôs horrible. Doug Jones would allow mothers to abort fetuses that are almost old enough for you to molest!
@SenFeinstein But at least hard-working billionaires can now deduct their private jet expenses!
@MooreSenate Nothing says pro-life like molesting high school girls.
@RoyBlunt @SenateGOP It‚Äôll increase take-home pay marginally for some middle class families, but healthcare premium increases will far outweigh the savings. But at least your 1% donors can deduct their private jet expenses!
