Senators don't get enough shit for the votes they take over and over again to confirm lifetime federal judges who have records of weakening protections for the very people these senators represent.		I will write about this. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Murkowski just voted to confirm Eric Miller too.
Murkowski is the only Republican I could see voting no on Eric Miller. 		Her office told me an hour ago she hadn't indicated how she'd vote.
If (when) Republicans confirm Eric Miller tonight, it's not just a sign they're comfortable with his record of challenging tribal sovereignty. It's a pass to keep doing it.		He'll be a lifetime judge on the 9th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over 427 federally recognized tribes.
@BeefishQ yes
Kevin Cramer of North Dakota just voted to confirm Eric Miller. 		More than 31K American Indians living in his state.
Eric Miller's legal work "has focused on undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal rights." -- the Natl Congress of American Indians + the Native American Rights Fund.		Miller is 43. Lifetime post.
Senate voting now on Miller. 		Curious if any GOPers will vote no on given Miller's awful reputation on tribal issues. My guess is none will oppose him, but watching Murkowski and Cramer.
Dems lining up on the Senate floor to oppose Eric Miller to be a lifetime circuit court judge. He's got a terrible record on tribal issues (see here: https://t.co/Pkizu9lpOz) and his confirmation hearing was a joke: GOP held it when nobody was here. https://t.co/ia1GsSKdev

@CornerVictors I find it very concerning when a major news network hires a partisan political operative, straight outta the WH, to oversee its 2020 presidential coverage. Doesn't matter what party we're talking about.
@LaceyMAnderson @kurtbardella don't give up! we need real journalists out there.
@CornerVictors And unlike Isgur, Stephanopoulos never peddled conspiracy theories. And I'm not aware that he signed NDAs with Clinton like Isgur did with Trump.
@CornerVictors It has been to a degree, yes. I don't think that's good either.		But in George's case, he moved *way* more slowly from politics to journalism. He was an ABC political analyst for years before becoming a host. He did not go from the Clinton WH to being ABC's political director.

@18milesout757 I hear you. 		What I can say about HuffPost is 1) the piece you cited was by an outside blogger, not a HuffPost reporter. Obviously it should have been better vetted, but that wasn't a staff piece. I understand the distinction can be confusing. 2) Our reporters do "real" stories.

@lawhawk @SethAMandel Filling seats left empty because the GOP refused to consider Obama picks is obstruction. Ugly, partisan, crappy, sure. But nobody is adding more seats to these courts to tilt their balance.

@gilmored85 The odds are she'll vote yes. But this issue is very close to home, and Rao's writings on this were pret-ty jarring.
Well this hearing has taken a turn. Attention now on an article Rao wrote defending the concept of dwarf tossing.		Rao: "There was a town in France that banned dwarf throwing..."		Sen. Hirono: "Your article has been been interpreted as you are okay with dwarf tossing."

Sen. Joni Ernst (R), who recently revealed she is a sexual assault survivor, tells Rao her writings on rape and sexual assault "do give me pause. Not just from my own personal experiences, but regarding a message we are sending young women everywhere."
In her confirmation hearing, Rao says re: her controversial writings on sexual assault, race, LGBTQ rights, etc: "There are certainly some sentences and phrases I would never use today."		"It's important to consider the context," she says of writing at Yale in early 90s.

Little update: I confirmed Murkowski's version of #SavannasAct is identical to Heitkamp's from last year. That means it includes real incentives for law enforcement to focus on missing and murdered Native women. (Goodlatte wanted to strip em all out, but he gone now).

@dianefrom_bc @ABlackTweeter @danamo I don't know if it's mandatory, per se, but a major project last year (Reclaiming Native Truth) dug into Americans' perceptions of Native people and looked at how revisionist and distorted school textbooks are on Native history, culture, etc.
@ABlackTweeter @danamo it's appalling
Anyway-- Savanna's Act *should* be one of the easiest bills Congress passes all year. It's badly needed. Bipartisan. Doesn't cost any additional federal money. We'll see if lawmakers can manage it. https://t.co/18S22ovRxM
Why is this bill called #SavannasAct?		It's named for Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-old indigenous woman who was abducted and killed in North Dakota in 2017. She was pregnant and her baby was cut from her womb. Yep.
Savanna's Act would essentially beef up coordination and data collection between all levels of law enforcement -- tribal, local, state and federal -- when it comes to cases involving missing and murdered indigenous women. Data on this is currently terrible and fragmented. https://t.co/UnoOdDwk0M
@svdate yes
Savanna's Act was *this* close to becoming law in the last Congress until former Rep. Bob Goodlatte singlehandedly blocked it.		Murkowski: ‚ÄúThat member is gone. And I‚Äôm still here. And we‚Äôre going to move it early and with some force and enthusiasm.‚Äù üî•https://t.co/18S22ovRxM
I talked to Murkowski yesterday about her bill to do something about this. Even she can't get her arms around how bad this is.		‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know what we don‚Äôt know with this. It is a challenge, at best, to try to understand the extent of the problem." https://t.co/18S22ovRxM
Imagine women and girls in your community just disappearing or being killed. Law enforcement having little or no data on what is going on. Media not paying much attention to their cases.		This is happening to indigenous women. https://t.co/18S22ovRxM

Where is this all heading?		My guess: Pelosi says no to SOTU til Trump agrees to open the govt. Trump agrees to open govt for like 2 weeks so he can do SOTU in the House. Congress accepts. After 2 weeks, Trump caves, agrees to open govt by saying $5B exists elsewhere for wall.

@leftwardbound @Robillard It doesn't call King out directly for much, you're right.
The vote breakdown on today's Steve King/white supremacy resolution.		1 no vote (Bobby Rush, who says it didn't go far enough)		9 didn't vote/weren't present (DesJarlais, Huizenga, Jones, Marino, Mast, Payne, Sensenbrenner, Thompson of MS, Wilson of FL)		https://t.co/JO9ZTP4rxN
@leftwardbound @Robillard FWIW -- Rush and Tim Ryan separately have resolutions to formally censure King. Sounds like Ryan, for one, is gonna push for a vote on his as soon as Weds.
Now what? Dems Bobby Rush + Tim Ryan have separate resolutions to formally censure Steve King. 		Ryan noted he could force a vote on his resolution as soon as Weds, since he intro'd it Monday and it has to sit for 2 days. He's even got an R cosponsor, Dave Joyce of Ohio.
@leftwardbound @Robillard Yeah it names King up top but that's it. Bobby Rush wants a censure (which is an official rebuke).
Here's the full resolution if you wanna read it, introduced by Jim Clyburn....		https://t.co/NpIHyenLzM
@leftwardbound @Robillard yes https://t.co/NpIHyenLzM
FINAL VOTE on resolution condemning Steve King and white supremacy: 424 to 1. 		9 members didn't vote.
Ahead of this vote, Steve King said on the House floor that he knows his colleagues are serious about this issue and adds, "I thought you all knew me well."		"I regret that we are in this place."

So many IHS health care providers are in the awful position of having to keep working without pay as the shutdown drags on. Not only are some really scared about dwindling finances, they're also worried about staff quitting and the hardship it will cause for patients.
One IHS health care provider is currently working with medical assistants "that are obviously ill" and "wearing masks" but can't leave work b/c they're not allowed and no sick leave. 		"It is the height of the flu season."
I'm also hearing from exasperated Indian Health Service health care providers who are being told they have to keep coming to work, without pay, even if they are sick.		They have to come in and prove they are sick. If they can prove it, they can go home. But won't get backpay.
An irate IHS health care provider, working w/o pay during shutdown, emails re: Trump adviser saying shutdown is like an extended vacation.		"Maybe they should put all of em in a room with only 1 bathroom &amp; sandwiches every 8 hours until they can make some decisions.... Bastards."

Bigger tribes that generate money from casinos, like the Cherokee Nation, can get by without IHS funding for longer. CN manages its own major hospital and 8 health centers, and it blends its own money with IHS money. But CN can only do this for so long, too. (5/7) https://t.co/LBR1FfU8QX

@rebeccanagle @KimTallBear @pollysgdaughter I don't dispute that. The point of this piece is to show there's other Native voices out there that aren't mad at EW-- and that that's largely missing from political news coverage of EW + her DNA test.
@MsKellyMHayes @rebeccanagle That's... simply not true. This piece is about political media's coverage of this issue and Native voices missing from the narrative.
@rebeccanagle WaPo story had no Native voices. NYT story had 2 known Native critics of EW, buried a line about some Native leaders backing EW and left the rest to political pundits. The "crickets" is the lack of diverse Native voices being part of political coverage about outrage at EW.
@jfkeeler I'm not saying it's not important. The tribal leaders and Native influencers I talked to said, in their opinions, there are bigger fish to fry. That's their opinion -- and one that I haven't seen reflected much in political coverage of EW.
@rebeccanagle The crickets line comes right after I cite two political stories claiming tribal outrage at Warren. Those stories either featured no Native voices at all, or a Warren critic and a buried Warren backer. That's precisely what the crickets is referring to.
@jfkeeler Not discounting your voice at all! Or other op/eds with similar takes. The point of the piece is to show there's other Native voices out there that aren't mad at EW-- and that that's largely missing from political coverage of EW + her DNA test. Diversity of opinions.

@zz2aa @RomancingNope There are links to some of Warren's critics in the piece.
@RomancingNope That's... not what this story says. 		I'm a white lady who talked to Native leaders and influencers and let them speak for themselves. Every person quoted in there is Native, and nobody is dismissing that there is also anger out there.
@RomancingNope @gthanku No. I'm saying there's lot of voices out there not being heard and there's much more nuance to this story than a monolithic stream of fury at Warren.
@RomancingNope The goal wasn't to find ppl who only liked Warren; I reached out to Native leaders to see what they thought of the news coverage around her DNA test. There was a clear consensus. Is there legit anger out there at Warren? Yes. Is Indian Country collectively outraged? No.
And some Native ppl wondered why Native critics of Warren -- who has been an ally to tribes -- aren't channeling their anger at Trump, whose bullying of Warren and awful treatment of tribes is the core problem. https://t.co/f6EMJmHcds https://t.co/S9vA5Ovva3
Nearly everyone I talked to lamented that what is happening here is Warren‚Äôs personal journey of self-discovery is being being weaponized against Native identity and Native people. https://t.co/f6EMJmHcds https://t.co/aPCgQc2KKe
@RomancingNope I agree with you. It's the cherry picking that's the problem. And in the media coverage of Warren's DNA test + how tribes feel about it, the vast majority of people quoted are the same handful of critics.
Is Warren's DNA test really an issue on the minds of tribal leaders? No. They've got their hands full with serious problems that don't get nearly as much attention. https://t.co/9dV1yjkJHU
@RomancingNope There's a diversity of opinions out there. And there is anger. 		The problem is only a handful of Warren critics are being featured in the news. Based on my reporting, this is not a pressing issue in Indian Country. At all.
Is there legitimate anger at Warren for inflaming complicated issues around Native identity + tribal citizenship vs ancestry, even if unintentional? Yes.		Is Indian Country collectively outraged at Warren over this and focused on it? Absolutely not. https://t.co/f6EMJmHcds
So where is this idea coming from that tribes are furious with Warren?		An unelected official at Cherokee Nation issued a scathing statement about her DNA test. Multiple ppl told me he was only speaking for himself. His statement is no longer online. https://t.co/f6EMJmHcds

@Frabba It expires when this Congress ends. People have to start all over next year. Another round of House/Senate committee hearings, votes, floor votes, etc. That's if someone will even intro this bill again.
I know everyone is focused on the govt shutdown, Mattis, etc. But this is happening too. Just wanted yall to know about this bill, the shit that Native women face &amp; that one retiring GOP congressman is making his blockade of #SavannasAct his final act in Congress. Fin. (14/14)
Congress will adjourn any day now. When it does, this bill will expire. There is still a tiny window of time for this bill to get on the House suspension calendar, but only if Goodlatte lets it go. He's hoping to let this bill quietly die with the congressional session. (13/14)
So, in sum, a single GOP congressman is blocking a bill that would help combat horrifying levels of violence against Native women. It would pass the House if it got a vote. It doesn't cost any additional federal $. But Goodlatte, who is retiring, won't let it go. (12/14)
Goodlatte is blocking this bill b/c he doesn't like that it gives an incentive for DOJ to give law enforcement grants to agencies that want to use this $ to implement #SavannasAct guidelines. He is about to tank the entire bill over this. See here: https://t.co/yNgQkw4i9C (11/14)
Why is Goodlatte blocking #SavannasAct? His office has refused to answer this question all week. Believe me, I have been annoying. Got nada, other than a vague statement on Monday. But I finally figured out yesterday what his problem is. (10/14)
Goodlatte is single-handedly blocking #SavannasAct. How can he do that? He's the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over this bill. If he doesn't want it to move, Paul Ryan won't move it. Now it's going nowhere. (9/14)
Heitkamp's bill sailed through the Senate this month. Unanimous vote. It was expected to sail through the House, too, on the suspension calendar, which expedites votes on bills with broad support. But then it hit a snag. That snag is called Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). (8/14)
So Heitkamp introduced a bill to try to do something about this. It's called #SavannasAct. It trains and incentivizes law enforcement to better handle cases of murdered and missing indigenous women. I wrote about it here. (7/14) https://t.co/PD09uN31HS
The level of violence aimed at Native women is so high in Savanna's state that almost everyone in Indian Country -- ~30K American Indians live in ND -- *personally* knows someone who has gone missing or been murdered. That's according to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). (6/14)
That was August 2017. Today, Savanna's baby is living with her dad and Savanna's story is part of a horrifying statistic. 84% of Native American women experience violence in their lifetime. In some counties, they are murdered at TEN TIMES the national average. (5/14)
The woman confessed to killing Savanna to kidnap her baby. Her boyfriend admitted dumping bloody towels &amp; his own bloody shoes into an apt building trash bin. Days later, some kayakers found Savanna's body in a river. She was wrapped in plastic and duct tape. (4/14)
Her parents called the police. After reports of suspicious behavior by a couple who lived in the same apt building as Savanna, the police got a search warrant &amp; smashed in the door to their apt. They found the woman who lived there with a newborn. It was Savanna's baby. (3/14)
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young Native woman named Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind. She lived in Fargo, North Dakota. She was 22 years old. She was eight months pregnant. And then she disappeared. (2/14)

I haven't seen text, but I'm told the most absurd sticking point in this -- whether lawmakers should have to pay out of pocket when they get sued for sexually harassing and/or discriminating against aides versus taxpayers footing the bill -- is only kinda dealt with.

@hr072 Of course he does. He's a Republican. But as lame as it sounds, the fact that he is saying *anything* about the embarrassingly bad caliber of some of Trump's court picks is a big deal considering GOPers just blindly vote them all thru, all the time.

This bill, which should have been the easiest thing Congress did all year, is stalled largely because the House wants tough punishments when lawmakers sexually harass their staff while Senate Republicans want a weaker bill. https://t.co/PpVfBCtNOu

The independent candidate in this race just dropped out and endorsed Kate Brown.		Coincidence that this happened right after I pubbed my piece? Yes. https://t.co/Kg9JtB4Qx8

Equally weird to Gov. Brown's seat being at risk is that abortion rights are in play in this election b/c of a ballot measure. Brown and her opponent, Buehler, both say they are pro-choice. Little problem with Buehler's record though. https://t.co/Kg9JtB4Qx8 https://t.co/01D922T9GN
One Oregon newspaper endorsed Brown's GOP challenger and argued that voters shouldn‚Äôt factor natl politics into this race. I asked Brown about this.		"Hell no. We need strong leadership to counteract the Trump administration." https://t.co/Kg9JtB4Qx8
Republicans are spending BIG to try to unseat Gov. Kate Brown, with one person in particular driving it: Nike founder Phil Knight. He's given a whopping $2.5M to her opponent + $1M to the RGA. https://t.co/Kg9JtB4Qx8
@DahloMetric @WildesaurausRex I don't really get why Portland has become a place for such awfulness. Maybe because it's so accepting otherwise?
@WildesaurausRex Generally speaking, because it's led by all Dems. The House, Senate and governorship. Nearly all of the US House/Senate folks are Dems too.		Obviously parts of the state are red/purple.
Kate Brown is easily the most progressive governor in the country. In deep blue Oregon. At a time when voter enthusiasm is through the roof.		And she's in trouble. https://t.co/Kg9JtB4Qx8

Quite a turnaround for Gov. Otter, who declared in 2016: "I am not going to entertain any idea to write an executive order and take unilateral action" to expand Medicaid, which he had the power to do then. https://t.co/4MvBmRfTLX
Well this isn't awkward.		The R gov candidate Brad Little, who currently serves with Otter, has dodged ?s about this for mos. He squirmed in last night's debate when pressed on it. Meanwhile the D candidate, Paulette Jordan, strongly backs it.		Why would Otter do this to Little? https://t.co/ltMCgvLj4Y
@ericdemamp I welcome any faith in me, Eric.
The Republican trying to unseat Rep. Cheri Bustos says the postage on the pipe bombs sent to Dems last week seems "woefully insufficient" and the stickers on the guy's van look too new for any of this to be real.		In related news, Bustos has a 99% of winning her race. https://t.co/ri4SoAMSQ7

Debate over. Lots of good, detailed policy questions. I contributed zero analysis. Goodnight. #idpol
Closing statements.		Jordan: Vote for the past, or vote for the future with me.		Little: I will protect Idaho values.		#idpol
Jordan to Little: Why won't you say where you stand on Medicaid expansion?		Little: Something about firefighters and police supporting him.		? #idpol
The moderators of this debate know their shit on policy issues. Impressive watching them press the candidates for details.		That's all I've got right now. #idpol

@DE_Ploribus_Uno you have the WRONG attitude, friend.
