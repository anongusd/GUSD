@jguiffre sure¬†‚Äì I'm focusing here on what was most likely to happen tonight versus what people wanted to believe would happen, and how the discrepancy makes them feel.
I mean, Rs played this masterfully down the stretch. People are bummed Dems didn't take the Senate. Okay, sure. Woulda been great.		But look at the flip: 10 vulnerable, Trump state Senate Ds on the ballot. Senate Rs could've had a 61-seat majority. They won't get close to that.
It's just so readily apparent tonight how much people's feelings about election results are swayed by outlandish expectations. Beto didn't win. Dems won't match a 2010-style Tsunami. And I'm supposed to be depressed because improbable things didn't happen?

@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC Amending the above, I'll further agree BB went a bridge too far in that attribution. if you agree you went a bridge too far in your insinuation that he may have been purposefully disingenuous because he previously worked at the Daily Caller.
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC Bottom line: I will concede I have no idea who made those cardboard signs (and that BB's tweet attributed them to NN "activists") if you concede you have no idea who submitted 1M allegedly fake comments in FCC docket. (2/2)
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC but just as you see track record of T2 opponents false flagging, we have also seen (IMO, over the line) tactics (like blocking Wheeler's car) from T2 supporters.  So I'd argue that creates a track record reasonably consistent with these over-the-line signs (1/2)
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC right - I'm asking why you're attributing fake comments to "anti NN lobbyists." I recognize you say you only "think" that, but you've made the allegation none the less.
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC (Not taking any stance here on existence of fake comments - haven't read relevant posts yet - nor who would be behind them. Just pointing out analogy in attributing Pai 'hood cardboard signs and fake comments to certain groups)
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC You can discuss existence of potential fake comments, but why do you suggest they are from "anti NN lobbyists?" Couldn't they just as plausibly be false flag bots from NN supporters made to discredit anti-T2 crowd? Apologies if I've missed evidence in either direction.
@danielschuman @BrendanBordelon @nathanleamerfcc @AjitPaiFCC Not to jump back on the carousel, but isn't this the same behavior from you? https://t.co/nOqNEFxwE3 https://t.co/YfQ0mCmPa1
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC You don‚Äôt have to believe what he says if you don‚Äôt want to. But I don‚Äôt think you should publicly impugn his motives based in part on your admittedly ‚Äúbig assumptions.‚Äù Again, just my $0.02. You may disagree.
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC He did not ‚Äúsmear all NN supporters.‚Äù Conversely, you have raised the allegation that he personally is spreading falsehoods out of political motivation.
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC Also, we‚Äôve seen video of T2 supporters blocking Wheeler from driving away from his house. Not taking a stance on policy here- just saying it‚Äôs not like T2 supporters haven‚Äôt resorted to (IMO) very aggressive tactics in the past.
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC I get what you‚Äôre saying, but there is also a threshold of willful nefariousness that needs to be met before he‚Äôs accused of being disingenuous, IMO.
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC I haven‚Äôt been online much today so maybe I missed something but how was it a mistake?
@danielschuman @nathanleamerfcc @BrendanBordelon @AjitPaiFCC Brendan is a good dude. No evidence or need to suggest he's any sort of disingenuous.

Is that true? If HIPAA/GLBA security standard is similar to FTC (is it?), then is FCC "reasonable measure" rule really inconsistent w FTC?

@haroldfeld @mattfwood believe I've read a lot of that. Would enjoy a SCOTUS clarification on all of this
@mattfwood @haroldfeld I don't profess to be a lawyer. but is my hair purple right now just because a court might later say it's purple?
@mattfwood I don't really buy your argument on this one, but even so - would you concede that cable cos being CC is consequence of OIO?
@mattfwood obvi, OIO made ISPs common carriers. So what that 9C later said some of them effectively already were CC, given other services?
@dbrakeITIF @pab_PK in theory that could be the new rule, no? FCC just adopts a rule akin to deceptive standard?
@pab_PK @AjitPaiFCC @MOhlhausenFTC perhaps this is the first step in doing so
So if @AjitPaiFCC and @MOhlhausenFTC want to align FCC priv rules with FTC, that means they don't want to repeal FCC rules outright, yes?

@HalSinger is a valid point (though hard to truly know what happened in past.) But if FCC was adamant about vote, could put on mtg agenda
