You people are exhausting.
Ppl assume that because they view everything through a partisan framework with all the sophistication of a concussed goldfish, everyone else must also process current events on the same level. Nah, some of us can read and have principles, thanks.
That’s been a frustration this week. You call out antisemitism on one side and ppl go “oh you’re trying to shift it from one party to another.”		No you unfrozen caveman I’m doing *the opposite* by shifting it out of the left/right debate and showing *how* it manifests on each.
PSA: stop saying “the REAL antisemitism is...”		The point about antisemitism is that it’s not ideologically fixed. It’s a virus that mutates and adapts to whatever form can accomplish what’s needed. All antisemitism is the real antisemitism. https://t.co/y4EmLmU3dc
@CarlPaulus @_Almaqah @Neoavatara @GaelenSchumann @AkivaMCohen @NonWhiteHat This is the point I made back when TNC wrote that piece: the institutions *of which slavery was a part* weren’t dismantled, therefore the govt had obligations toward redress from harms done by the structure in place, which continued after abolition.
@matasar Wyden’s a principled guy
@GPollowitz @karol @MeghanMcCain That’s fair
@DraftRyan2016 @allahpundit no way
@allahpundit Yes in that after all this, there's no way the Minn. Jewish community will want a primary challenge to "from the Jews" so to speak. This give activists an opening to capitalize in a neutral-ish way on frustration with Omar that already exists.

@Neoavatara @_Almaqah And to be clear, saying it's hard doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. But a lot of ppl get tripped up with the Holocaust comparison (TNC did too, iirc, with stuff about the cars to Israel)
@Neoavatara @_Almaqah Right, I'm not arguing against reparations (I praised TNC's essay at the time and implored conservatives to consider the point), I'm saying the return of stolen property isn't a model for compensating unpaid labor, you'd need to create one.
@karol @MeghanMcCain Meghan don't accept this it's a ruse Karol is a Russian bot
@_Almaqah @Neoavatara it's just the return of stolen property

@_Almaqah @Neoavatara Those aren't exactly reparations, it's a settlement over stolen property. My bubby was sent from a German insurance company, for example, that had been making all this money off the accounts of dead people. Bubby wouldn't take the money but donated it funds that aid survivors.

@MaxKennerly It's so frustrating. Dear members of Congress: the point of all political debate should *not* be about creating campaign attack ads! You know, there are actual people affected by policy! But it all falls on deaf ears.

@cjane87 Exactly! I was thinking Ferguson but you’re right that Castille is a better example because of the gun-rights angle that really showed ppl to be hypocrites
7. If it rubs you the wrong way to see Jews stick up for ourselves, you’ve internalized centuries of Jew-hatred and think the status quo—in which Jews can be stepped on without a second thought—is acceptable. It’s not. Shut your mouth and open your ears and listen to us. /fin
6. This began w/Jews being targeted with bigotry from government officials. It ended with the government throwing the Jews under the bus. In the interim was a series of jackasses picking fights with Jews who dared speak up. If you contributed to any of this, time for a gut check.
5. I confess to not even really understanding the impulse, but I would implore ppl who did this to put themselves in our shoes and imagine if it were a member of your community targeted. How much patience would you have for “be nicer to your persecutors”?
4. And one of the things that this practice did was divert the conversation. If you were making Jews’ reaction the story, you were running interference for Jew-hatred. And derailing an important debate on bigotry is a bad use of this platform.
3. I think it’s clear if you go looking for Jews to spit at over antisemitism, and then when they hit back you play the victim, you are likely just a genuinely bad personal. But it’d be better for everyone if you didn’t demonstrate that at times like this.
2. There was a writer at a major pub who writes forcefully on race, so I assumed he’d understand the pain. But he spent two days trolling Jews’ timelines to call them racist for objecting to antisemitism. Knew he could be caustic, but didn’t realize he’s just a complete dirtbag.
1. One of the things that made for stupid unnecessary fights during this Omar saga was the sheer amount of “reaction policing”—ppl whose contributions to the antisemitism debate consisted of telling Jews to just calm down. Perhaps that’s a function of this particular hellsite.

And then also seeing who jumped on the bandwagon to yaskween it--ppl who like to pretend to moderation on here but piggyback on others' dismissal of antisemitism.		I don't think I expected this many cowards among the general population. Not a great sign for our future.
One of the interesting things today was seeing anti-anti-Omar ppl pop into my mentions to tell quibble with this or that--and then seeing that their *only* tweets on Omar through this whole thing were whataboutism to *only* me.		There are some creepy-ass blue checks on this site.
I mean, Democrats are not against an anti-Islamophobia resolution! Nor should they be! How is this even the debate?
Also it's just kinda weird that we're talking about this in either/or terms because does anyone think Pelosi is against calling out Islamophobia too? I get that it's a question in the GOP, but this is not opposition to *recognizing* Islamophobia.		Just have two resolutions!

This sounds like a hot take but is absolutely true. What US presidents needed was Begin and Sharon. What they got was a cautious pragmatist in Bibi.
@politicalmath I just meant it as a joke about existential dread
@politicalmath I am... not curious (tho of course I take your point)
There's a thread--or maybe it's a piece--to be written, going through the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and US diplomacy that explains how what peacemakers really needed was the rightwing ideologue they always wrongly said Bibi was.

No one should ever be forced to "earn" the right to be respected as a human being this way. It's degrading.
There is very clearly a systemic bias against men &amp; women of color in law enforcement. Saying "all lives matter" after a BLM protest was essentially asking minority victims to pretend that bias didn't exist *while they were grieving for a life lost to that bias.* It's obnoxious.
@AlviSalahuddin I've written time and again on here that Islamophobia in the GOP is a major problem that needs to be dealt with. I'm with you!
Insisting on tying Jewish pain to *all other pain* erases Jews from the incident. Insisting on tying Jewish pain to another group's pain suggests Jewish culpability in said pain.		It's very simple, and I don't know why both right and left still need this explained to them.
As I tried explaining to conservatives who pushed the "all lives matter" stuff in response to Black Lives Matter--a group I've defended time and again--when a specific group has been targeted, universalizing and appropriating their pain is obnoxious.

@NathanWurtzel No
@NathanWurtzel When I asked on twitter how his Jewish employees might feel about it he said he’s Jewish and he thought it was a good post
Anyway, my sense is no, they probably won’t: the ppl you’ve stuck your neck out for see it as a one-way street. Two notes:		1. They likely think they it won’t be noticed. It will.		2. They should henceforth be ignored on such matters.

Hypocrisy is part of politics, sure. But plenty of conservative writers have refused to mince words when it came to bigotry on our side, making sure to clearly stand with our friends on the left when they’ve felt targeted by hate.		Will they stand with us, now, publicly?
One thing to watch for: left wing commentators and sites that bill themselves as carefully monitoring bigotry, and which (quite rightly) get upset when, say, Steve King’s comments are reported as “racially charged”. Here’s how Vox has been describing Omar. Will it change? https://t.co/fyDAN9T3OT

“Seth you forgot to turn off the living room lamps again.”		“ISRAEL HAS HYPNOTIZED THE WORLD.”
Whenever Bibi does something that bothers me I, too, shake my fist and shout “Israel has hypnotized the world.” I express my disapproval of Benjamin Netanyahu by saying that AIPAC is bribing Republicans to attack me.
But you can see how she thought it would work. “Opponents of the Iran deal are disloyal paid agents of moneyed Jews. And btw we only hate Netanyahu.”		Literally every left-of-center publication: “Sounds legit.”
This one shows just how deep in the bubble she is. For ten years this is the lie the left has tried to sell—we’re only opposed to Bibi—and there were just so many ppl dumb enough to let them get away with it.

@JMUOSU Exactly. And the truth is AOC and others, when asked to define socialism, just say ‘govt funding of museums’ and stuff like that. Which is bad because she doesn’t know enough, but *good* because she’s not actually calling for gulags
@Conseeervatroll I don’t disagree with any of this
@JMUOSU Agreed. Ironically I think conservatives have thus weakened the ability to scare ppl with “socialism” by doing so, but it doesn’t help when there’s so much gaslighting about “real” socialism from its boosters

@Conseeervatroll Well, *some* members of the party. I’m not responsible for what others call socialism but I am confident she’s wrong in saying 100% of opponents of socialism don’t know what it is
When my family took in Soviet Jewish refugees we used to call them dopey ingrates all the time. What did they know about socialism and antisemitism?
Then I taunt them like AOC’s stans do: Oh you afraid of a little socialism, you snowflake? You scared of a few gulags? You gonna cry like a baby over some mass class liquidation?
@JRPSD @Neoavatara @redsteeze Indeed. I’m very much a squish on immigration but that comes into conflict with a robust welfare state

This is especially true because commentators today seem to have no idea what Jabotinsky really believed. Very, very few people in public life do. They--society at large, too--could use a refresher.

When Begin, Carter and Sadat would meet just the three of them, Begin would only speak first if Sadat asked him to. 		This is, btw, another key point about the legacy of Jabotinsky. *This* was a defining characteristic of Betar: humility.
Carter remembers it too. From his earlier memoirs: https://t.co/rv5VPU0IR0
If this is the end of Bibi’s reign, I will have lots and lots like Motts to say. But in contemplating how *global* Bibi’s status as a statesman became, I think back to Begin’s modesty.

@mckaycoppins @baseballcrank That’s very different from what you said, which was “there are very few conservative media outlets/pundits that haven't gone full MAGA.” Which is just nowhere close to being true. And it massively distorts the picture of what’s happening in conservative media.

@NathanWurtzel That would be better than regular version
@LBC1983 @AG_Conservative She certainly has been at hearings, as I mentioned
Most common responses I’m getting:		“But she had these other bad personal qualities!”		“Why are you sucking up to evil leftists!”		I am eternally grateful for all of your help in proving my point.
@fisherofmeh @AG_Conservative What did you decide
@bronzebarbarian @AG_Conservative This is true
@DAVIDFERNANDES8 @AG_Conservative Longer than that—I think Utah was nearly twenty years ago, no?
@AG_Conservative It sounds like you’re responding to a point I wasn’t making.
@cjane87 She’s very thin skinned and so the discussions don’t get very far *with her*, but it’s undeniable that she puts ideas out there and we all debate them. She drives the conversation, and it’s mostly about policy. We should appreciate that.
@commonsense258 I agree
@ryuryu2949 Check my TL from a couple days ago, I addressed it
@JohnGal26732891 God help us all
@AG_Conservative You’re missing my point: she puts ideas out there and then they get debated
I hope in time it’ll become cool to discuss ideas again. Until then, AOC is basically the only game in town. Of course if that takes more than twelve years then mass extinction comes first. Which is fine too I guess.
It’ll make her effective too, because she stands virtually alone on her side and across the aisle conservatives are too busy adding names to lists like Ryan in The Office. https://t.co/IYPAtP1dEX
Inevitably, when you point this out to *either* side the response is “OH SO YOU THINK IT’S FINE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO DO CRIMES.” Which is stupid, but also dumb. Most behavior at congressional hearings is like the gan bunks at camp. Not AOC’s.
In the Trump era, the right has devolved into competing streams of Enemies List Conservatism, the left Lock Him Up Liberalism, which essentially amounts to pretending to be Mueller but without the knowledge, access, resources or experience.
Allow me a note of appreciation for AOC. She routinely tries to steer the debate back to ideas. I disagree with some (green new deal, opposition to tax abatement for job creators) and agree with others (drivers licenses for illegal immigrants). But at least we’re debating ideas.

@DanielBShapiro yep, a wonderful piece. Also really important to remember that it started as militant Soviet-Jewry advocacy. Misguided but understandable. Current incarnation is inexcusable. It's just racism.

@mmurraypolitics @maggieNYT Medvedev wasn't in charge and everybody knew that, and the incursions in Georgia took place before that.

@LahavHarkov yup, or, as our major donor called it at my graduation ceremony, machane kayitz
@yshollander @MortChristenson @bethanyshondark @DanielBShapiro ah I thought it was Josh Pruzansky. Never mind then, yeah this isn't surprising at all.
@TonkaThompson collusion!
@bethanyshondark @DanielBShapiro No I think this is the other Pruzansky. Unless I'm getting them confused.
@MichaelEHuck lmao
@DanielBShapiro It's the theme: go back and re-read YKH's memoir of a Jewish extremist and you see the same thing, that it's a sort of youthful rebellion, but when they grow up they see the world is much different than their angry teenage minds thought it was.
@DanielBShapiro "Rav Kahane." Oy. I've known Pruzansky a long time and I like him a great deal, but I simply can't wrap my head around this one. I even asked an old friend of mine who was, when younger, a Kahanist, and he thinks it's nuts. He grew up and he says Bibi should too.

Anyhoo what else is going on folks
One time they brought in a recovering addict to speak to the school to scare us off of drugs. Turned out to be my childhood friend’s father. I spent like every weekend at their house. “We had no furniture because I sold it all for drugs. Just ask Seth.”		Please don’t ask Seth.
@AltruistcMystic I’d like to be able to pull off a porkpie hat
That would explain why, when we broke into the school early one morning and the alarms went off, the cops never showed up.
@GPollowitz I’ll have to think. I was kicked out of several, and it’s hard to keep track
My HS was a secret govt experiment wasn’t it
@KNayyeh ...and?
@KNayyeh If it helps, I’ll always be proud of your dad

I think they took it easier on us because they never figured out what the green smoke emanating from the boiler room near the fallout shelter was.

The interesting thing is that if you know your stuff, you can use Jabotinsky to critique the new nationalists on the right. But you’d have to be willing to read a book.
@Yung_Sapling It’s really a wide gap. I go back periodically to refresh
Both right and left get Jabotinsky’s quite nuanced philosophy of nationalism wrong, but the right does so in an attempt to learn, the left does so—almost without exception—as an act of revolt against the very concept of learning itself. Anti-intellectualism as political tribe.

Clinton told Taylor Branch that Bibi was just as agitated by the far right as he was. Obama’s ppl thought Bibi himself is “far right”—which is a genuinely insane thing to think. Hire one non-moron next time and you’ll see the difference.
@bethanyshondark @lsummers3 @ThatSethanyShow Sure
Both Obama and Bill Clinton had a rough go with Bibi, but Clinton got somewhere with the Likud-led coalition in just a couple years because Clinton more or less understood Bibi and had advisers like Dennis Ross. Obama had Rhodes and his bubble, and here we are.

8. If other ppl having different priorities sends you into a rage stroke, politics isn’t for you. Honestly, neither is adulthood. But here we are.		To my friends on the right and the left, who have spent two days acting as if I am your therapist: I’m not. Please get help. /fin
7. I, too, wish liberal voters were actually conservative voters. But here on planet earth, wishing has yet to make it so.		So perhaps—perhaps!—you might be interested in hearing from them why that is? Crazy, I know.
6. “Kamala is very publicly breaking with certain left wing orthodoxy to paint herself as a moderate alternative to the *actual socialists* she’s competing with. This will be an effective strategy.”		“BUT SHE’S REALLY A LIB HOW CAN YOU FALL FOR HER ACT???”		Dude.
5. Now we’re enjoying the other side of the coin. “Kamala will benefit from the fact that voters want moar incarceration.” 		“HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT MASS INCARCERATION AND ENTRENCHED RACIAL BIAS IN POLICING???”		I... don’t? And you know I don’t?
4. Then it was months of “we’re tired of hearing from Trump voters from swing states!”		Okay. I can’t force you to acknowledge the existence of swing voters. But may I humbly suggest that, *strictly as a practical matter,* sticking your fingers in your ears is... not great.
3. I’d relate this to Democrats, who would blow their top at me. “HOW CAN YOU NOT CARE ABOUT HIS MISOGYNY? IT’S A MYTH THAT HILLARY DIDN’T HAVE AN ECONOMIC PROGRAM!” Etc. 		I mean, *I agree.* I was NT and very publicly argued that the “Flight 93” case was nonsense.
2. After Trump was elected, his voters came out of the woodwork to talk to me about it. They felt they didn’t have to keep their heads down anymore I guess. They’d tell me they didn’t pay much attention to the Access Hollywood stuff, but felt ignored by Clinton, esp on economics.
1. It’s fascinating watching a replay of 2016 with roles reversed like some Melissa McCarthy GHOSTBUSTERS reboot. Latest example: the response to explaining voter behavior as if it’s a *justification* of voter behavior.
@morningmoneyben Agree. It's like the pants that no one should ever wear: Take a pass on the pled pants.
@BecketAdams I agree! I'm with you on both the criminal justice stuff and the Catholic bigotry! But I'm not saying *I think she's a centrist.* Voters are stupid, I don't know what to tell you
@BecketAdams That is one question, yes. And to that particular question, the idea that voters wouldn't see her as a centrist-leaning alternative to Bernie, Beto et al is of course silly. She and her opponents will *both* paint her as such, and it'll stick.
@BecketAdams Happy to look at data that shows tough on crime to not be a centrist position among American voters, btw. If there's something Gallup, Harvard et al are missing.
@BecketAdams Gallup finds the same stuff: https://t.co/kx9vEFkYLv
@BecketAdams I mean, when you try to drill down to specific questions you get stuff like this: "Voters are evenly split on whether the criminal justice system is biased against minorities. And a majority (55%) says the criminal justice system is too lenient on crime." https://t.co/GMGEY4FUIV
@BecketAdams You think Harris is akin to Arpaio and Clarke? What's "Harris style tough on crime," and what makes you think it's unpopular?
@scottlincicome @JohnEkdahl See? The workers are being exploited
@Coshoct @BecketAdams I'm just saying, "voters don't like mass incarceration" is... well it's a Take, that's for sure

@yashar @AmoneyResists no jokes allowed on twitter Yashar you know that
@BecketAdams I said she has centrist cred, which is precisely what her tough on crime past and her refusal to jump on the "tear down all walls" bandwagon gives her, hence the trouble she'll have with the party base. Do you think mass incarceration is a fringe position in America? Are you new?

@bdquinn They're all intentional
@RBPundit Compared to Warren? Gillibrand? Beto? Cmon, it's a field of fakes
I think Klobuchar is strong too, and I'm not just saying that because I'm afraid of her
Her personal story, her poise, and her centrist cred make her a general election perfect storm--plus sending a female prosecutor against Trump... it's like she was created in a lab.		But she can't be nominated in a lab, so.
On paper *and* in real life, Harris seems the strongest by a country mile. I wonder if the Dems will nominate someone that makes them long for smoke-filled rooms again, the way many Republicans felt after 2016 primaries.

Obviously they’re not Corbyn. The issue is that they stand there with their hands in their pockets or actively encourage their party’s Corbynization. Minimizing Jews’ concerns may make you feel better but it has the opposite effect on us, so just keep that in mind.
This is why AOC, Bernie Sanders, Ro Khanna and others’ admiration for Corbyn is such an infinitely bigger story than ppl treated it as. Ascendant progressives are not powerless and they are not fringe. (This applies less to Ro Khanna obviously, but worth noting.)

And of course, maybe the top contender in this category: "The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face"
Another example: Tons of great Dylan lyrics, of course. But I've really grown fond of a line of his my dad quoted to us all through my childhood: "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows."		Open your eyes, pay attention to the world around, think for yourself

@mdcohen You mean what I've been doing all along? Thanks, I plan to continue
@_Almaqah Her tweets--plural not singular--were the latest in a long line of antisemitic statements. If you don't think she should be removed from committee, that's fine, that's a legit opinion. But "newcomer" is a dodge, and "Steve King bad" is a dodge.
@YourFavHipster @_Almaqah Problem is, she started again literally after her nonapology on twitter! She can't wait five minutes. But yes I agree that Pelosi's gonna have this headache for a while, I just don't see Pelosi letting it bother her. It clearly doesn't.
@jgrantaddison Absolutely not.		I drank mine.
@YourFavHipster @_Almaqah Yes, agree on that
@_Almaqah I mean, I guess? In the flimsiest possible interpretation? I just don't think "Steve King should apologize" would lead folks to say "glad he's being held accountable"
@RobGeorge @YourFavHipster @_Almaqah This is not true, of course. It *is* the first offense that Pelosi has seen fit to condemn. Not the same thing, very obviously. And even if what you said were true--which it isn't--that's a pretty bad reason. Someone with a history of antisemitism continues being antisemitic.
@_Almaqah She also said it's relevant that Omar's a "newcomer." So she should clarify how long one must be in Congress before being held accountable for antisemitism.
RT @allahpundit: “One woman stopped to snap a selfie in front of the art, which she thought was of pop singer Gloria Estefan” https://t.co/…
@YourFavHipster @_Almaqah Except it's not remotely her first offense. And not putting her on an important committee is not the same thing as demanding she resign.
@ulys_cat @_Almaqah I agree with both points!
@_Almaqah She was asked if Omar would be removed from committee. Her answer is no. I couldn't possibly care less that she's mad about Steve King because so am I--doesn't mean Omar should stay on committee.

@chrislhayes @Yair_Rosenberg As an addendum, I think this @kampeas piece on the differing views between Bibi and the Israeli left on the role of the "shtadlan" is worth keeping handy: https://t.co/noIpn949z6
@MattGertz you just mad you weren't the Republican congressman who did it
@ThatchEffendi @chrislhayes @Yair_Rosenberg Don't tell Twitter Support that we had a civil debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I think it's against the TOS.
@chrislhayes @Yair_Rosenberg Right. I was responding to Chris saying he doesn't think "AIPAC and others have quite grasped just how much they are losing" (they do!) by "say[ing] to liberals "We need to support *that* government with everything we have." (they're not!)
@Yair_Rosenberg @chrislhayes Right, but *Bibi's* moves aren't coming from AIPAC. I'm not arguing Bibi hasn't alienated the left. I'm arguing AIPAC is getting dragged by the leg
@Yair_Rosenberg @chrislhayes Right, which is why they're losing a debate, not shutting one down--and the idea AIPAC is politicizing Israel is nonsense. The two parties may be moving apart on Israel, but it's not because AIPAC is using it as a wedge.
@chrislhayes @Yair_Rosenberg That power's long gone! It simply doesn't exist. It never did to the extent ppl think, but there is no power there, Chris. That's a big part of my point.
@chrislhayes That's not true either! They fought Israel over South Africa, they publicly sparred with Rabin, they sparred multiple times with Bibi, etc etc.
@Yair_Rosenberg @chrislhayes None of that means AIPAC is shutting down US debate on Israel.
@chrislhayes But that's simply untrue. The AIPAC line is a strong US-Israel relationship. Which is why AIPACers were, for example, excluded from Bibi's controversial joint session speech, and privately (including to reporters) raged about it.

@chrislhayes I really don't want to clog up your mentions but ppl were saying I owed you *some* explanation of my tweet and I think they were right. That's the tip of iceberg, anyway. Happy to engage on any of these points if you want.
@chrislhayes It is also worth looking at why the biggest moves and concessions for peace were made by "rightwing" governments--Begin at Camp David, Sharon in Gaza/WB. Even Bibi agreed to redeploy from Hebron. Olmert, old school former Likudnik, offered Abbas a massive deal. Etc.
@chrislhayes It is worth looking at Israeli politics and asking why Labor is struggling to meet the threshold, and every possible Bibi successor from *other parties* initially came from Likud, mostly Bibi's inner circle, and none talk about, say, dividing J'lem (which Bibi has!).
@Mikeworty Truman's my guy but if it takes Madison to beat FDR, so be it
@chrislhayes additionally, AIPAC didn't fire the shots here, and their response was tepid. Nor is AIPAC's mission about specific governmental coalition but about the US-Israel relationship. It is not made up of rightwingers, never has been.
@chrislhayes Briefly: "We need to support *that* government with everything we have" is a straw man; Bibi has reined in the right's excesses more than most ppl seem to know; Israelis elected him for an unprecedented decade straight, so they understand the criticism is of them not merely him.

Now she’s given her would-be supporters no room to maneuver. There’s no doubt that she just leveled an explicit antisemitic smear at a fellow member of Congress. Indeed, even folks on the left who would usually just sit this one out and stay mum are like “holy crap that’s gross.”
Ilhan Omar does this repeatedly. She’s like Trump in that her supporters will go out on a limb for her and then she’ll saw it right off. How many ppl, present company very much included, have egg on their face because they (we) stupidly gave her the benefit of the doubt?
And what’s more, Josh Zeitz is prettay, prettay, pretty left on Israel and criticism of it. Omar’s anti-Semitism is one of the very few things in this world most Jews can actually agree on. It’s remarkable, really. https://t.co/o2sGUsJj83

There is no excuse for writing about what an organization wants while refusing to so much as visit its website where its goals are laid out clearly or quote its founders and leaders, who aren’t media shy. There’s just no plausible claim to ignorance here.
I don’t mean to pile on Costa, but if I didn’t think he had a desire to get the story right I wouldn’t engage with him. WaPo is the best newspaper in the world, with lots of great reporters. Zero of them have reported BDS accurately, or corrected when it’s been explained to them.

@allahpundit Both--John Jr. was a page
@MWC_RS he was a page
@NathanWurtzel No, it was both father and son. John Jr. was page, since age 11.
John Dingell was in the chamber when FDR asked Congress to declare war after Pearl Harbor. He was there when LBJ signed Medicare, and lived to see Obamacare. He led the charge against Anne Gorsuch at EPA, and lived to see her son become a Supreme Court justice. RIP to the Dean.
