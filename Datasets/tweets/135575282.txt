OK that's it. Tip your servers have a good weekend.
OK, some of us have days to get on with. Can we wrap this thing up?
The news here:	Trump says he could extend deadline with China. 	He will sign an emergency declaration to help build walls on the southern border but adds "I didn't need to do this." 	Anything else?
"There is a possibility that I will extend the date." Trump on the March 1 deadline with China.
This is bananas.
Man I'd read a 1000 page Don Dellilo novelization of this Trump event ala the beginning of "Underworld."
So I'm going to bring Pelosi and Schumer into the China deal, Hey there's Bill Barr!
"didn't" sted "don't." https://t.co/oa2xYY3W4I
This press conference is not going to help Trump's legal case on the emergency declaration.
Trump declares a national emergency and also says "I don't need to do this" and could do the wall over a longer time period.
"Let's hear it, NBC."

This is just a free form MAGA rally speech with a national emergency declaration kind of gaffer taped in there.
China is coming here next week, FYI. All of it.
There it is. "I'm going to sign a national emergency."
Nancy Chuck they know it. Walls are good. It's a lie. That's a nice tie, I like that. Border agents are good. Barbed wire is good. China, man I don't know. UK, you know about the Brexit.
"So anyway, what else is going on? What you guys up to this weekend? Oh, right. What are we doing here again? Yeah, emergency or whatever. Lot of murders. And I'll sign that thing. What thing was that? Israel has a wall. Did you know that"
I'm just too tired to riff on Trump's market stuff.

I declare today Friday.
People are not really green eyeshading this. They are more apt to notice a big drop in refunds than a small bump in the weekly pay check.

A near-term recession is absolutely not a sure thing. But if it happens, history will record that we brought in on ourselves by doing very dumb things for bad reasons.

You can list crimes committed by anyone. But undocumented immigrants commit less crimes that U.S. citizens. https://t.co/qsdtV3nnHI
Again, his argument that the wall will pay for itself through the trade deal is not based on reality. And drugs mainly come smuggled through legal ports of entry, so that's not paying for it either.

Drugs including heroin mostly come through legal points of entry, FYI.

Tariffs are central to Trump’s economic policy and he either doesn’t understand or deliberately misrepresents how they work.

I'm not sure if Trump knows that he is making it much harder for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes with all the bashing. Or if it's just more important for him to have a fall guy to blame for stocks.
Another reminder that every time Trump bashes Fed Chair Powell and calls for a rate cut he makes it LESS likely that that will happen. The Fed cannot be seen to kotow to the president. Trump would be more likely to get a Fed pause if he kept quiet.
