One small thing at the risk of harping on Farrakhan–and @callyrgf did a really great job of explaining why there's so much miscommunication on him—the @TamikaDMallory posts about him were from 2018. The recentness was why the fear &amp; disappointment was so fresh for (some) Jews.
Sometimes, during the podcast calling it "drama" risked minimizing the seriousness and the pain, but you articulated a lot of the fear &amp; understanding that many other conversations on @womensmarch miss.
Thanks for the shout-out @callyrgf!!! You did one of the most nuanced, honest discussions about the @womensmarch &amp; anti-Semitism. https://t.co/Hzi6QVqWBT
Also, I am not sure who edited the piece, but it was fairly irresponsible not to include that @nytimes has also reported on the anti-Semitism allegations against the @womensmarch leadership: https://t.co/7QLcvf6mpe
Um... I'm pretty sure the answer is no—and, it is definitely no if you're in an intersectional feminist. (Ironic, considering the women who excuse the anti-Semitism.) https://t.co/ICaYz88uP2

@schraubd 2) I'd rather not see this play out in a Twitter stream. I am more than happy to discuss over email. I think you have it, but feel free to DM me if you don't!
@schraubd 1) This may be a fundamentally disagreement about who upholds white supremacy, but I don't think the fact that I am viewed as white and identify as white means there is any logical way to lump me with white supremacy—a virulent movement with a specific goal, namely my demise
@schraubd White supremacists don't see jews as white. Just because she sees as white and part of an oppressive group doesn't stand against the absolutely critical difference that said group doesn't see us as white and part of them. I'm not going to be dictated by her definition.
Even in a prepared statement to @nytimes, @TamikaDMallory admits she believes Jews are to blame for white supremacy. Does she not realize white supremacists' mantra is "Jews will not replace us?" https://t.co/7QLcvf6mpe https://t.co/eiT9CrQED0

2) There are extremely legitimate criticisms of the history and current manifestations of feminism in ignoring and sacrificing the needs of many oppressed women. Those of us who care about feminism should be scrutinizing our past and our future—and creating a dialogue.
1) Based on this video, it's because it isn't aligned with Tamika Mallory—a woman is pretty receptive to anti-Semitism and homophobia as long as it is voiced by Louis Farrakahn https://t.co/DvRpaE7l3X

3) But an even bigger problem is that @UMich professors are quashing the opportunity for students to develop their own insights and criticisms—which, presumably, what any prof worth their salt should encourage https://t.co/zx3Bo4L7ce
2) That 2 @UMich professors are rescinding study abroad recs just for students who want to go to Israel is clearly hypocritical, as Deutch points out https://t.co/sgHhXTBb9V

RT @AJCGlobal: Why is opposition to Israel increasingly a litmus test on	the “woke” left? @eshire gives her take this week on AJC Passport.
2) @TeenVogue, like many millennial female-focused publications, is shilling what seems "woke" without nuance; here, it's peddling conspiracy theories about Israel but many topics get this treatment. It validates my worries about what's currently the loudest version of feminism. https://t.co/gGvQHfxxrf
1) @TeenVogue deserved praise for refusing to speak down to young women and never doubting they cared about the world. However, to see such an irresponsibly one-sided piece filled with half-truths pretty much kills the respect I had. https://t.co/FYp3lyPVPp

2) I would love to be having the nuanced conversations about what a two-state solution would look like, the problems with the settlements, and how best to secure Palestinian statehood. Unfortunately, the people the @womensmarch has chosen as leaders erase such possibility.
1) Sometimes, people make strong, thoughtful critiques about Israel that make you rethink your core beliefs. Then, there's @TamikaDMallory, who just dismisses the founding of Israel as a "human rights crime." https://t.co/4yUzMkYZPX

2) Conservatives co-opt feminism &amp; it's frustrating as hell. But intersectional feminism is too often a purity test, threatening to take away your "feminist card" if you don't support an environmental/foreign policy/economic view over which 2 feminists can rationally disagree
1) @JessicaValenti is spot-on calling out the problems created by the attempt to make feminism more "friendly," but it's deeply frustrating that she accuses only conservatives of coopting the language of feminism https://t.co/RhneUEDBKr

2) Recognizing the double standard doesn't excuse Israel from criticism or scrutiny—there's room for plenty of both—but it is much easier to not acknowledge it because then you can still pretend that there's not the backdrop of people thinking Israel's existence is dispensable
1) Part of grappling with Gaza is recognizing that Israel is being held to a double standard—and @BretStephensNYT hits that nail on the head https://t.co/ar3xQ7Qm6l https://t.co/LRokkf79hc
4) Thus far, some piece I've found helpful on this front are @washingtonpost's editorial: https://t.co/Ze1rqvzzud) &amp; @Yair_Rosenberg's 13 Inconvenient Truths: https://t.co/0cSMRV33Co
3) If you think being a "good Jew" means looking at the news cycle over the last week, or even the last year, you're missing that the drive for knowledge and willingness to grapple with hard truths are what's actually core to being a "good Jew"
2) Being a "good Jew" means struggling to reconcile the hard realities of Bibi endorsing settlements &amp; the Israeli blockade and Hamas selfishly squandering funds for food, infrastructure &amp; social welfare because they'd rather a Jewish state not exist than a Palestinian one thrive
1) My feed is filled with sentiments that being a "good Jew" means denouncing Israel for what's happening in Gaza. I would counter that being a "good Jew" actually means grappling with the history and the region, struggling to understand a 70+ year conflict

4) That @jonathanweisman only addressed anti-Semitism on the right is part of a growing problem because it is easy &amp; comfortable to ignore it on the left. 		But we just had a Dem DC council member say Jews create bad weather to mess with the capital — and we need to talk about it https://t.co/OL4ZKbDG7D
3) Maybe it was an oversight but @jonathanweisman mischaracterized Jewish orgs as only concerned about Israel when the reality is they not only combat anti-Semitism but xenophobia, racism &amp; other causes. Quick look at @ajc's website shows how wrong he is: https://t.co/XtTGnq19g9
2) But there is actually are larger concern, other than the fact it appears wildly out of touch with reality: @jonathanweisman has only focused on anti-Semitism on the right. He does not think the @ADL_National or @ajc is responding to the anti-Semitism that HE finds problematic

@nytimes 2) I wish more of the journalists trashing @Harpers &amp; Katie Roiphe would not so blithely dispense with or ignore the freedom of the press implications of uniting to mobilize the publishing of a piece whose contents are even known yet
1) So, according to @nytimes reporting, it does not seem clear or necessarily likely that the creators of the Shitty Media Men blog were going to be outed https://t.co/YXe06acra1
@nytopinion 3) The below paragraph in particular indicates not only a gross misreading of Israeli and Palestinian opinions but even more of Israel's actions. This blithe, erroneous characterization of the conflict makes me question the whole of the piece https://t.co/vx6Wf50cvZ
@nytopinion 2) I don't disagree with her assessment that the embassy move may make a two-state solution harder — but (generally left-leaning) threats that anything remotely pro-Israel could hurt a two-state solution has been the boogeyman for decades
1) Goldberg's @nytopinion "Is Liberal Zionism Dead?" poses an interesting question, but glossing over the repeated attempts of reconciliation over the last 7 decades and boils the peace process down to the embassy location does a disservice to all parties https://t.co/UylSzeSbgK

@frankophilia 3) It may not be racist, but at best, it's erroneous to be justifying ways to treat Israel differently from Russia, the U.S., whatever country it is. That framework of treating Israel differently gets a free pass without being questioned too often and by too many good writers
@frankophilia 2) But the flawed framework of analysis is one worth commenting on because so many smart reporters and commentators fall into it: that there's nothing wrong about holding Israel to a much higher standard than the rest of the countries. https://t.co/QRMRnEdAn4
