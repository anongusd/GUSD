Lamont, the undergraduate library at Harvard, was for men only.  Justice Ginsburg, as a 2L, wanted to check a citation.  She asked a guard if he would bring the source to the door, but he would not, so she had to ask a male classmate.  #SCOTUS #RBG

Even though Justice Ginsburg graduated first in her class, Learned Hand would not consider her for a clerkship, since he did not want to swear in front of a lady and also did not want to modify his language.
RT @KannonShanmugam: Honored to have been elected today to the American Law Institute. 	 https://t.co/FbMrMFZgPh
However, a flood of support letters came in, and Ginsburg was able to explain her position in the hearings.  She was confirmed 96-3.
Ginsburg was not a lock for the #SCOTUS nomination. Pres. Clinton apparently said, "The women are against her." This is because she had criticized Roe v. Wade, believing that Roe should have been grounded in equal protection, not privacy.

Justice Ginsburg and her daughter Jane were "the first mother-daughter team in the history of @Harvard_Law."
Griswold was on the selection committee for the D.C. Circuit.  In 1985, he gave a speech singling out three advocates for their role in changing the law: Ginsburg, along with Thurgood Marshall and Charles Houston.
Ginsburg points to a change in Griswold after her #SCOTUS oral argument in Frontiero.  He came up to her after and shook her hand enthusiastically.  She recalls that "from that day forward he was much friendlier."
Griswold also refused Ginsburg's request to graduate from @Harvard_Law, after 2 stellar years there, since her last year would be @ColumbiaLaw. (Later, Harvard offered her the diploma, but she stuck with Columbia. Got an honorary Harvard degree and serenade from Placido Domingo.)
More on this later.  Erwin Griswold plays an interesting role in Justice Ginsburg's story.  He was the @Harvard_Law dean and later SG who asked female 1Ls, including Ginsburg, why she was taking the spot of a man.
Keep in mind that the first female SG was Elena Kagan, more than 30 years later.  And female appellate judges were few.
The Second Circuit was her first choice of court, and she also interviewed for that position.  As a New Yorker, she was hoping to return home.
When President Carter was elected, Justice Ginsburg considered a career move.  Her "dream job" would have been Solicitor General, and she interviewed for the position.
