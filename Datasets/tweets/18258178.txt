Yep. Once again, nails it. I'm trying to get people to understand the phrase "predatory delay". It fits in with other forms of systemic abuse, but is unique to climate change because of the need for immediate action. Looking forward to more posts about solutions. https://t.co/rZ9vWp1cWb
But we also need to understand that the culture needs to be changed, at its very core. We must change the all of it.
We tell boys and then men over and over and over NOT to empathize with women. And then all of a sudden we shout out "HEY MEN, BE AN ALLY!" and "Start understanding women NOW, will you?" I'm not saying we shouldn't do that. Of course we should. We must.
We imply that women cannot should not be understood. That marrying one is a 'ball and chain'. That men should escape to the 'man cave' to get away from women. That the real talks take place in the Board Rooms, where women don't often enter.
But see, we, as a culture, don't teach men and boys this. We put enormous pressure on them NOT to understand things from a women's point of view. We don't get them to read books or see movies with women as heroes. We tell them "don't throw like a girl". https://t.co/4NZcT8DXjb
