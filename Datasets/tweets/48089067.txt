@cfanpnk Right there with you. Set up my #Ergodox EZ at work less than two weeks ago. Only averaging about 20 WPM (thanks to also switching away from QWERTY). But I'm sold on the layering and ergonomic benefits, and I'm confident it'll be worth it in the end. Hang in there! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç

@TabloTV Hey guys, what's the minimum Android requirement? One spot on your site says 4.1, another says 4.2. Thanks!
@TabloTV Pre-order in, looking forward to it!
@TabloTV No worries; presumed as much but did want to offer. Been watching with interest for months, now "following" as 4-tuner grows near.
@TabloTV Excellent! Speak up if you need beta help. IT hw/sw pro, CET, FCC 1st, took products through Part 15 cert... and rural w/no cable.
@TabloTV @Southbark Looking forward to snagging one from the first batch!
