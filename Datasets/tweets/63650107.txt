Her wit and good counsel will be celebrated and remembered for many years to come. My prayers are with her husband and the entire Bush family tonight.”
When the two were married in 1945 one of the greatest partnerships in American history was formed. The late Mrs. Bush was instrumental in her husbands successes as a Congressman, Vice-President and President of the United States and an inspirational figure in her own right.
“I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the Barbara Bush, one of our nations most distinguished First Ladies. Mrs. Bush left an unassailable legacy of public service. She will be remembered as for her steadfast support of her husband George H. W. Bush.

The National Anthem used to be a moment for everyone to put their agenda aside and stand together as Americans.		Such a shame the left has taken this beautiful moment and used it to perpetuate discord, disrespect our nation, and push us all further apart.		https://t.co/dmhPhgEWNt
Veterans play the National Anthem at a rally outside my office. "Resist" protestors tell everyone to "take a knee."		What incredible disrespect for our nation and those who've served—especially in a district home to Camp Pendleton and generations of veterans from all our services https://t.co/EE3Qc8sINb
RT @susancrabtree: .@DarrellIssa Slams 'Resistance' Group Protesters for Taking a Knee During Veterans’ Rally Outside His Office https://t.…
"Democrats, Democrats, you should be ashamed, taking Commie money from Hanoi Jane," the veterans shouted at Democratic protestors gathered across the street. https://t.co/3jx7AtPzOY
Standing with veterans who today made their voices clear: @flipthe49th and the Hollywood front groups protesting outside my office should return the $100,000 check they took from Jane Fonda - a traitor who sided with the enemy and betrayed our soldiers in Vietnam. https://t.co/ZbtkyP3fVB
Plenty of veterans showed up outside my office today to demand @flipthe49th and my opponents return the $100,000 check they took from "Hanoi Jane" Fonda -- a traitor who sold out our POWs in Vietnam and TO THIS DAY says she "isn't proud of America." https://t.co/hF8W0tHtXM
What Jane Fonda did was a slap in the face to every veteran who served our country in Vietnam. It's unconscionable my opponents and their "grassroots" front groups would take $100,000 from her to fund their efforts. We will hold them accountable! 		https://t.co/orw43gFIUK
Never forget → This is who is bankrolling my opponents. The same traitor who said our Vietnam POW's were "hypocrites and liars." What a better way to "celebrate" her birthday than pitching in $5 to fight back her efforts?https://t.co/27CDb2ZsEu https://t.co/qcTP1RaVXZ
I have so little respect for "Hanoi Jane" Fonda after she betrayed our country all those years ago - literally caused prisoners of war to be further punished. So, if the best my opponents can do is come out and have Hanoi Jane put in $100,000 to try and defeat me... I’m OK. https://t.co/gPpS99ZYbY
Joan Fritz gets it right. The "hypocrites and liars" aren't our POWs and veterans -- as Jane Fonda believes -- but the Hollywood elites funding the faux-grassroots groups trying to buy our district. https://t.co/4aZ02ifCCh
My opponents are bought and paid for by "Hanoi Jane" Fonda, a woman who said our POWs returning from Vietnam were "hypocrites and liars" who shouldn't be "hailed as heroes."		Chip in $5 to help fight back this traitor and stand with our veterans! https://t.co/XABEIHPkx4 https://t.co/s30Ykhxm0E
Literal traitors against the United States — like Jane Fonda — who betrayed our POW's and sided with North Vietnam over our men and women in uniform are funding their efforts.		No wonder they refused to disclose their donors until they got caught https://t.co/FyEHcB3nla

It’s obvious that Washington needs more oversight. Oversight leads to reform so that gov’t works for taxpayers – not the other way around.
No Administration is free of scandal. Despite his claims, Pres. Obama is not the exception to the rule.
Obama said "We have not had a major scandal in my Administration." That's as true as his promise to run "most transparent" admin in history
