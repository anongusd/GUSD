Jesus Christ will walk beside you through your Christian path and this is the reason that you should feel hope. 		Please read  Bible verses about hope if you have trouble finding hope in your life. Any scripture on hope that you read can help you find the Light -
you will always have salvation waiting for you. We know this because there is Scripture on hope that tells us this. 		Take comfort in knowing that God the Father is always watching out for you. Christian hope is based on this simple fact. Never in your life will you be alone.
We know that without hope, we have nothing in life. Christian hope is what gets us through, and thanks to Jesus Christ, we have LOTS to hope for because He has promised us glory. It is comforting to know that no matter what troubles you are currently experiencing in your life,

Christmas was not observed in Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire, until about 300 years after Christ‚Äôs death. Its origins cannot be traced back to either the teachings or practices of the earliest Christians.
Although it is difficult to determine the first time anyone celebrated December 25 as Christmas Day, historians are in general agreement that it was sometime during the fourth century. This is an amazingly late date.
adding nine months brings us to the end of March as the most likely time for John‚Äôs birth. Adding another six months (the difference in ages between John and Jesus (Luke 1:35-36)) brings us to the end of September as the likely time of Jesus‚Äô birth.
It was during this time of temple service that Zacharias learned that he and his wife, Elizabeth, would have a child (Luke 1:8-13). After he completed his service and traveled home, Elizabeth conceived (Luke 1:23-24). Assuming John‚Äôs conception took place near the end of June,
Zacharias, was a priest serving in the Jerusalem temple during the course of Abijah (Luke 1:5). Historical calculations indicate this course of service corresponded to June 13-19 in that year ( The Companion Bible , 1974, Appendix 179, p. 200).
Since Elizabeth (John‚Äôs mother) was in her sixth month of pregnancy when Jesus was conceived (Luke 1:24-36), we can determine the approximate time of year Jesus was born if we know when John was born. John‚Äôs father,
If Jesus Christ wasn‚Äôt born on December 25, does the Bible indicate when He was born? The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of Jesus‚Äô birth, based on the conception and birth of John the Baptist.
Given the difficulties and the desire to bring pagans into Christianity,‚Äúthe important fact then which I have asked you to get clearly into your head is that the fixing of the date as December 25th was a compromise with paganism‚Äù (Wm Walsh, The Story of Santa Klaus ,1970, p. 62)
Second, Jesus‚Äô parents came to Bethlehem to register in a Roman census (Luke 2:1-4). Such censuses were not taken in winter, when temperatures often dropped below freezing and roads were in poor condition. Taking a census under such conditions would have been self-defeating.
Similarly, The Interpreter‚Äôs One-Volume Commentary says this passage argues ‚Äúagainst the birth [of Christ] occurring on Dec. 25 since the weather would not have permitted‚Äù shepherds watching over their flocks in the fields at night.
Luke‚Äôs account ‚Äúsuggests that Jesus may have been born in summer or early fall. Since December is cold and rainy in Judea, it is likely the shepherds would have sought shelter for their flocks at night‚Äù (p. 309).
First, we know that shepherds were in the fields watching their flocks at the time of Jesus‚Äô birth (Luke 2:7-8). Shepherds were not in the fields during December. According to Celebrations: The Complete Book of American Holidays ,
WHY CHRISTMAS IS CELEBRATED ON DEC 25th	A careful analysis of Scripture, however, clearly indicates that December 25 couldn‚Äôt be the date for Christ‚Äôs birth. Here are two primary reasons:
2 Timothy 3:16 	All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,		John 17:17 	Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.		Psalm 119:105 	Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.

If you read Bible verses about worry, it will help you understand why it isn't an important emotion. That is more important is that you should pray as a Christian/believer and trust in God instead of worrying as a Christian/believer. Don't let your heart be heavy!
The only thing that worrying will do is ruin your day - the emotion will make things dark. However, if you just open yourself up to the light and love of God, then the idea of "worry" is not something that will bother you.
That verse alone is capable of inspiring an inner peace within a Christian that will prevent so many worries, fears, and even sins. 		If you trust in God, then there is no need to worry about your life. One of the best sayings to live by is "let go and let God."
What does the Bible say about worry? Well, the main thing that you should do is to try to NOT worry. Do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself. This is one of the most powerful scriptures in the Bible and one that you should live by.
PRAY TO KEEP ISRAEL SAFE. PRAY FOR OUR COUNTRY AND OUR MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. PRAY AND ASK GOD FORGIVENESS OF YOUR SINS AND HE WILL FORGIVE YOU. YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD AND HE LOVES YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

Accept that reading the Bible and praying can help you in your times of trouble. Praying to God and working past your problems can help heal the bitter feelings in your life.
If you are trying to move past an event or situation in your life that has left you feeling this way, be sure to read  Bible verses on bitterness 	Although you might not think that this will help at first - believe in yourself and in God.
Turn to God and try to heal your bitterness. 	The Bible is here to help deal with these bitter feelings - there are many Bible verses about bitterness.
There are many ways that Christians/believers can be affected by bitterness. Regret, jealousy, and envy can all lead to feelings of bitterness and to an unhappy life. When a person is bitter, their life doesn't feel worth living. Don't let that happen to you!

He is the only one who you can truly trust, no matter what. And the more you trust Him, the closer to him you can become. 		Read Bible verses about trust if you want to become closer to the Lord. Christian/believers trust is strong - maintain your healthy relationship with God
Your family and your friends are not perfect, but it makes you a better person to believe in trust. 		You should always be careful with who you trust, but you shouldn't live your life in fear. Thankfully, though, you can trust your Heavenly Father without a second thought.
Sometimes it's hard to find trust in such an untrustworthy, disloyal world. It's important to not get hurt, but you also must learn to trust in God. Trusting the Lord should be easy. But it is also important to trust in those you love.

Just remember, you are not alone in this life - God is always with you. Bible verses about faith should fill your soul with song - whenever you are feeling the least bit down, it is a good idea to read a Bible verse about faith.
Use scriptures to reaffirm your faith in God. Meditating upon the Holy Bible can give you all kinds of insights... and helping you understand Faith in God is one benefit you can receive from reading the Bible.
It is the true Faith and what every Christian should aspire to have. Don't let your Faith waver when things in life don't go as planned. We should work hard every day to remember that Jesus Christ is our Savior and God is our Father - we should always have faith in Him.
As Christians, we have to recognize that Faith is perhaps the single most important aspect of Christianity. Without faith in Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, we are are nothing. Faith in God, although it seems easy, will take a lifetime of effort to keep.

Read Bible verses on comfort if you're ever feeling down. Our God loves us and you should hold onto that important truth.	Psalms 9 :9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Your family and your friends (even if they are few and far between), can be a source of comfort. 		Read Bible verses on comfort if you're ever feeling down. Our God loves us and you should hold onto that important truth.
So don't waste your life worrying about being lonely. God will always be there for you, to love you and to protect you. But throughout our lives, we will meet special people who will love us for who we are, so take comfort in that.
From the time we are born until the time we die, all humans seek comfort. We need comfort in ea other &amp; comfort in Christ. We can all take comfort in knowing Jesus loves each of us as if we were His only one. Not only are we loved by God - but we can be loved by ea other, too.

Read  Bible verses about salvation so you can truly understand why Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior - you will discover just how much he loves you through your Christian salvation!
and we should celebrate our salvation every day that we can. Knowing that you are Saved makes life a little easier to live. The awful things that Christians may experience in their life won't matter in the end, not when they are at peace in heaven.
is the best decision you'll ever make. There are a lot of people in this world who do not believe in Christian Salvation - but don't let their negativity affect your joy. 		Jesus Christ has saved all of those who believe in Him. This is such a wonderful gift
Salvation is the most important gift you will ever receive. Becoming a Christian through the free gift of salvation lets you not only live a more peaceful life here on earth but an eternal life in heaven. Accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior

Please read Bible verses on lying if you need help with telling lies. Sometimes it is extremely difficult to tell the truth, but God can give you the courage to do so.
The option to lie should not be a in a believer's life; we should always think of the truth first. We are not made perfect and we are tainted by original Sin. But no matter how imperfect we are, we should always strive to be good people - and this means not lying.
We should always strive to leave honest, open lives that are full of trust and love. But, since we are all human, sometimes it is hard to avoid lying. 		White lies and small omissions are still lies - we should always remember that.
LYING:	The Bible says in James 3:8, "But no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison." The tongue can be the most wicked weapon on earth, so use it wisely and speak your words with caution. As believers, we shouldn't fill our lives with deceit

A day shouldn't go by without us praising God. We may be barely able to comprehend His mercy, but we know that it is there.
We have a powerful and merciful God. He knows we have all fallen short of His glory, but His mercy is incredible. That is why believers need to always be aware of His love and His mercy.
