DHS's Nielsen: "this administration did not create a policy" of separating families at the border. But the facts suggest this is wordplay: the administration absolutely created the recent mass separation situation with a dramatic change in enforcement practices.
DHS's Nielsen calls for rollback of court agreement that requires that children be detained separately, suggests critics have offered up only "open borders" as an alternative.
