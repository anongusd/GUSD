But in America's lithium bomb test in Bikini Atoll, what was supposed to be a 5 megaton explosion turned into a 15 megaton explosion, blowing an island off the map and contaminating MANY people with radiation.
@cantfiggeritout This is a MAJOR environmental threat to all humanity (not just meat eaters) and the entire food chain. Probably not God's punishment for hunters. Also, remember prions are phytoremediated by plants and can enter into vegetables and be passed to new hosts!

@FoaRyan @Lincolneigh @Enviro_Politics @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump One of the things he did was squash the free press and journalism. We believe this is why @JeffFlake made the comparison.

@retrobluecolly @EnviroNews_AK @Defenders @PredatorDefense @wildearthguard @CenterForBioDiv @HumaneSociety @WWF @Earthjustice Due to the electoral college, it didn't matter that 3 million more people voted for Hillary.  Trump still got in.  Quite scandalous, and not the first time this has happened.

@DevonCallaway @YTCreators You may want to explore players like @SekindoLtd that come with an ad tag already baked into the player. It will likely pay MUCH higher than @YTCreators rip-off paltry $1 CPM. For us, it'll be @Brightcove and approaching advertisers directly.

@RealGoodFish Question: WHERE does it say the salmon are red due to radiation? Answer: Nowhere.
@RealGoodFish The fish was a sockeye, tested in November, when they are returning to spawn and red. Anything inaccurate about it now?
@RealGoodFish Why does everyone keep thinking this. The story, if U read it, also covers the 1st CA salmon, testing positive for cesium.
@Susan_Mayer_ Good question. They plan to vitrify it in glass logs -- if they could ever get the vitrification plant built that is.
@reubenesp Sadly, the regulation they are working on killing includes both flaring and venting.
@flugeryl @SovereignAnnie But hey, let's all get on a mountain top and shout "Fake news! Fake news! Fake news!" -- just like The Donald...

@IEnergyLLC @EnviroNews_DC And also, wasn't it just last year that solar was at .06 via EIA #s? Looks like its output doubled in one year?

@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear Because we want 2 know. Please tell us how many particles from Fukushima U have lodged inside?
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear If U get cancer, how will U know where it came from? Do U know how many fallout particles U inhaled from Fuku?
@radiationreason @Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear Oh, good ol' @WSJ -- You mean @RupertMurdoch's company? Interesting character that Rupert.
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear Cancer doesn't come wearing a stamp that tells you where it came from. It's invisible for the most part.
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear When people die from rad from a nuke plant most the time, they have no idea they were exposed.
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear Of course not. But radiation, though sometimes used, is not the preeminent treatment for childhood cancer.
@radiationreason @Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear Yes. And the environment? What about it?
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear Guess time will tell.... (We hope you are right and life expectancy rises)
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear Well, we would choose that over a damn cancer ward any day.
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear And the younger you are when exposed to radiation, the more likely you will die from its effects. Do you agree?
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear Aaaaaaah! We AGREE at last! 😬
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear https://t.co/lj8iLe6MUn
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear You are wrong (again). Life expectancy dropped last year in the US for the 1st time in decades
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear Medical science is of course always advancing. Does that make having cancer any more fun?
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear @WHO Over here in UT kids R breathing radon in homes/schools from cutting into it 4 foundations
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear @WHO No argument. Indoor and outdoor air pollution suck. We've released about 300 films on it.
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear But hey, we're sure radiation, the most carcinogenic thing on the planet doesn't have a thing 2 do w/ it. Right?

@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear but Enlighten us: exactly how does 1 track all cancers when a fallout cloud blankets the earth?
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear well other estimations are even higher.
@radiationreason @Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear well, guess it's you vs IAEA on that one. Humans destroy wildlife everywhere they go.
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear it's on the rise as is cancer worldwide. WHO predicts 50% cancer increase worldwide over 20 yrs. Wonder why?
@Daniel_W_See @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear as we've said, they harnessed PLENTY of power from 9 fast reactors while making their bomb fuel
@Daniel_W_See @moms4nuclear @AtomicAristides yes. And humans have released a gang load more of it!
@Daniel_W_See @radiationreason @moms4nuclear the IAEA said 4K from Chernobyl (even though the lead researcher said 40K) is that credible?
@moms4nuclear it is no damn game that's for sure. But you gotta have a little fun deflecting alternative facts from a gang up of pro-nukers.
@Daniel_W_See @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear yep. Just like good ol' Hanford. No sludge there from spent fuel at all.

@moms4nuclear @Daniel_W_See @AtomicAristides then radon is not your friend
@moms4nuclear @AtomicAristides seemed civil enough to us!
@AtomicAristides oh but it's just so much fun talking to you pro-nukers! Thanks for weighing in! @ MomsForNuclear

@radiationreason @moms4nuclear bogus. Even IEAE said 4K in the 80s ' lead researcher said 40k &amp; committed suicide when IEAE forced a lower #
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear open your eyes that comparing nuclear plant plutonium fallout and medical treatments is a RIDICULOUS analogy.
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear we'd love to film and document it! We know right where you can get high system-wide exposure!
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear no. What you said is radiation doesn't cause disease. Now you admit it does. Make up your mind
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear no offense, but u r old. Children at much higher risk.girls at higher risk. fetuses at extreme risk. Science.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear and probably could get yourself cancer in 4-50 yrs too ;)
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear radiation cancer gestation period 4-50 yrs. Oh, you missed that little inconvenient fact.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear unless you just ate a few particles. Radiation cancer gestation periods are from 4-50 years.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear Awesome! Your approval means the world to us! 👌👋❤❤
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear oh wait? Is cancer a disease? Just checking....
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear next you can tell it to the tens of thousands of children with 2 holes in their heart from Chernobyl cesium.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear well you just denied radiation could ever cause cancer or disease. See what the families say.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear yeah. Like Americium 241, Cesium 134/137, Strontium 90, iodine -- all cancerous and deadly too
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear and you insult the THOUSANDS of Nuclear worker victims and families harmed by the US gov. Sad.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear if you think radiation doesn't cause cancer you're living on Pluto amigo. Sorry, but you are.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear oh right. No disease, but less than a fingernail will kill you! Who's an idiot?
@ANS_Illinois @moms4nuclear yet you give no examples. Watch the first 4 in our 15 part mini-series. You might learn something!
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear Truth.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear exactly, just a spec and ur dead. But didn't you just say it causes no disease at all?
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear drink some radioactive sludge and well see who's full of it.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear drink a cup of Hanford sludge then. less than a fingernail and you'll be dead buddy.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear HA! You had some credibility until that statement., UR an engineer but your no epedimiologist.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear bogus. They harnessed PLENTY of power from the 9 fast reactors there while making bomb fuel.
@Analysgruppen @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear like Arnie Gundersen says: "little orphan Annie" (it's only a day away)
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear or do we not know what we're saying right now? Guess the epidemiologists are full of it right?
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear Afterall, it does kill, cause disease, and birth defects doesn't it?
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear people are smart to fear radiation aren't they?
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear Well, we'll have to put you in touch with our correspondents at Hanford sometime.
@AtomicAristides @Analysgruppen @moms4nuclear oh sure. It doesn't break down or corrode at all right?
@Analysgruppen @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear for 1, spent fuel breaks down to sludge (like at Hanford) is that so hard to understand?
@Analysgruppen @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear you need to look a little farther then we're afraid.
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear would love to see that. Why not put your money where your mouth is?
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear are you willing to irradiate yourself with "higher doese" of radiation to prove to us all how safe it is?
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear maybe. But not as dense as plutonium! :)
@ANS_Illinois @moms4nuclear oh? We have. Many, and have released part of a 6 hr video series with one. Outlandish? Like what?
@Analysgruppen @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear Gen4!? Yeah! Where!? ( oh right, it's only 20-30 yes away)
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear ha! And you sound like a pro-nuke ostrich with its head in the sand.
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear you may try. And if you find us, we will also educate you sir.
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear more helicopter pilots alone died at Chernobly than the horribly wrong #s you gave. how can we trust that?
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear many? Tell that to DOE at Hanford where the DESPARATELY needed vit plant is years away. Some solution.
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear agreed on that point. It is science (don't forget the epidemiological studies - not pretty for nuke industry)
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear still waiting for that nuclear waste solution (oh, that's right. There isn't one!)
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear bull. You need to get your facts straight amigo.
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear oh but why just have nice neat spent fuel when you can have both?! You gotta a solution for either?
@ANS_Illinois @moms4nuclear wacha gonna do with the spent fuel &amp; blended waste? Lets just keep pooping in our own nest with it. What ya say?
@Analysgruppen @AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear sure. Just pile the hot blended sludge up on-site. With WIPP closed wacha gonna do with it?
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear BOTH sectors have serious problems.
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear Just as messy in a commercial reactor when all that hot blended sludge comes out (still ZERO solution 4 that)
@ANS_Illinois @moms4nuclear where does plutonium come from?
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear U don't get bombs with out getting plutonium from power reactors first. Didn't they teach you that in school?
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear radon #2 cause of lung cancer in US, but who cares right? Give 'em more radiation after they're diagnosed!
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear oh you nuke lovers. Such colorful analogies.
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear sorry, but those numbers are HIGHLY inaccurate, and a HUGE insult to radiation's countless victims.
@ANS_Illinois @moms4nuclear where do you think plutonium comes from? Yes, let's all click our fingers and plutonium will magically appear!
@AtomicAristides @moms4nuclear oh? Like what?
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear Ha! now that's a good one. Radiation never hurt a soul right?
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear You call that safe?
@radiationreason @moms4nuclear ONE tank at Hanford holds trillions &amp; trillions of lethal doses of radiation &amp; they've no idea how to control
@moms4nuclear Then you love nuclear bombs and MASSIVE cancer caused worldwide as well correct? An incredible picture to say the least.
@moms4nuclear Paducah was the single largest greenhouse emitter on the ENTIRE PLANET. 4 coal-fired plants to run it, and MASSIVE freon. Low?

@luisbaram Nothing is perfect. Nearly all exploits affect somebody. But no other energy source can kill EVERYBODY in 1 fell swoop.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 We would agree there are problems with it and it's not perfect. But nuke is HIGHLY dangerous to the whole planet.
@luisbaram @blueinmo @eutrapelia7 Both sources foul our nest. There are energy-techs that ruin Earth much less. How about developing those?
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 The Dirty Deadly Front End of Nuclear Power — 15,000 Abandoned Uranium Mines (Pt. 1) - https://t.co/2pdqCsWTGc
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 Let us give you a link, and tell us if you think the nuke biz should clean up its mess before being allowed new ones
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 Nuclear is HIGHLY CO2 intensive. They just don't tell you. Enriching uranium is HIGHLY CO2 intensive as is mining it
@blueinmo @luisbaram @eutrapelia7 "Friendly" nuclear power is a guise for the military industrial complex's bomb fuel business. Little more.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 And we can give you HUNDREDS of basically unknown nuclear catastrophes if you're interested. Nobody accounts for it.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 The article is PURE malarky RE nuclear. There are HUNDREDS of aspects, parts of the waste-stream, unaccounted.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 safer than solar, wind and hydro? Really!? Wow, we have no idea where y'all get this stuff. Very entertaining.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 TEPCO and nuke industry in Japan are run by the Japanese Yakuza -- cool right?
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 @Forbes that is a horrendous comparison. Sorry, it's apples and oranges.
BREAKING NEWS: Nuclear now safer than solar/hydro/wind according to @luisbaram wow, what a revelation! @eutrapelia7
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 we teach 5-yr-olds to clean up their messes b4 making new ones. How about holding nuke industry 2 the same standard?
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 too bad they all forget to account for the 15000 abandoned uranium mines, still poisoning EVERYBODY to this day.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 Fukushima will "get over it"  in, oh, only about another 100 yrs and 100 billion $. And that's just the cleanup.
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 nuclear, the "safest?" was that meant as a joke?
@luisbaram @eutrapelia7 is that what we're supposed to tell all the cancer victims? Just "get over it?" easy to say till it's your family.

@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @WHO @NIH The "science," dating back 50 yrs to the present, clearly shows radiation kills, causes disease &amp; cancer.
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @WHO @NIH "Anti-science?" Please. The 2 agencies R running off a 50 yr old agreement that CLEARLY has HUGE problems

@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @WHO @NIH An organization that pins its numbers to the IAEA. You don't see a conflict or problem with this?
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 The Japanese research on thyroid abnormalities in the area doesn't look pretty (but the cancer won't come for yrs.)
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 We've only JUST hit the beginning of the gestation period. What did they have to track from Fuku before last yr.?
@Daniel_W_See So you defend TEPCO, and your argument is that not a single person has ever died from radiation exposure. Okiedoke then....
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 TEPCO ran cleanup ops via the Yakuza and they got busted doing it by a damn fine journalist. It's NOT a conspiracy.
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 The IEAE's agenda is to pump and pimp out nuclear power around the world. What is your point?
@Cat_B2016 A dirty deadly process from start to finish -- from uranium mining to spent fuel and hot blended nuclear waste, it's not pretty.
@Daniel_W_See People in Philly drank iodine 131 from Fuku in their water. In 20 yrs when cancer shows up will they know where it came from?
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 Do you know the gestation period for radiation-caused cancers is from 4-50 yrs? When did Fukushima happen again?
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 And you continue quoting WHO as if it's a source to be trusted on the dangers of radiation in the environment.
@Daniel_W_See It's not easy. That's the point. You're argument however, seems to be that radiation has not taken a single life - ridiculous!
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 TEPCO is WELL KNOWN for conducting its business through mob relations. Few news cos have the cajones to discuss.
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 Huh! Tell that to BRAVE journalist Tomohiko Suzuki who stung their asses.

@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @WHO @NIH So you're saying radiation is only responsible for saving lives? Not taking lives? Is that your argument?

@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @WHO (of course it's attributed to "lifestyle" factors) Sure, nothing to do with radiation or chemicals at all...
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 Interestingly @WHO predicts a 50% rise in cancer worldwide over next 20 yrs. Anything 2 do w radiation on the lose?
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @JimConca @WHO It's just true. They are in bed, &amp; IAEA's agenda surely isn't health. It's the spread of nuke power.
@Daniel_W_See @JimConca Countless people have been injured and died from radiation on the lose in our environment.
@Daniel_W_See @JimConca Theres so much radiation on the lose in our environment it's not even funny. 15K abandoned uranium mines in US alone
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @JimConca @WHO WHO has even pinned numbers to the IAEA. Very credible.
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 @JimConca @WHO Hmmm great resource. The WHO? Who is as in bed with the nuclear industry as anyone?

@Cat_B2016 @Daniel_W_See Agreed. TEPCO sure didn't.
@eGeert At this point, we see no highlighted "errors" to send to the editor. Thanks for weighing in.
@Daniel_W_See @Cat_B2016 The opening statement in this article is the biggest crock of crap we've ever read! Thanks for sending that over.
@eGeert There is much epidemiological data on the dangers of internal particle emitters in relation to ray-exposure. It is not new research.
@eGeert Brings us back to internal emitters again. Alpha/beta outside the body, less dangerous. Deeply lodged in tissue - different story.
@eGeert Did you know 1/1,000,000th of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer in a human? That's a pretty "low" amount right?
@eGeert Oh, the banana comparison again. Right.... Heard that one!
@eGeert Compared to what? Cesium 137 is not even a naturally occurring element.
@eGeert There were two groups of researchers. One in the U.S. one in Canada. The seawater was reported at .3 becquerels/cb meter
@eGeert Included where? Those increased risk factors certainly weren't included in the news reporting.
@eGeert Also, children are at a much higher risk, female children twice as much, &amp; fetuses many folds more. All facts missed by researchers.
@eGeert From a dose perspective it is the same, but from an epidemiological standpoint, internal particle emitters carry unique risks.

@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Why don't help us out: What was "fake" about the article? Give us a "fake news" passage from our own reporting.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish In reviewing our own article, we see nothing in it that be considered inaccurate, and certainly not "fake."
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Ok. We'll grant you that one.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Just some food for though: We prefer to eat fish containing ZERO radionuclides. How about you?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish We are reviewing all links and sending to the editor.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Lastly, who is talking about the increased risk for children -- and the doubled increase risk for female children?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish We are happy you are testing, though we may not see eye-to-eye on the health risks or safety.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish We are going to send this Tweet conversation to the Editor.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish It is a comparative analogy to dumb it down for readers -- and not a good one.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish We do. But come on and enlighten us anyway!
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Come on the show sometime Mr. Cullen and enlighten us. Would be fun. Have a good one.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish We get it. But it's not fair to equate the risk of internal particle emitters (in fish) to x-rays. Bad analogy.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish An x-ray hits you once. An internal particle emitter can become lodged in tissue &amp; irradiate you for years. Same?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish 1/1,000,000th of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer in a living organism. Sounds pretty risky to us.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Also, who's talking about all the OTHER isotopes making their way over here? R U testing for plutonium? uranium?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Why don't you come on the show and enlighten us then?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Ok. Fair enough. You deserve a voice on EnviroNews about this for sure. We're sending that to the Editor. Thanks.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish There is an "important difference" in risk between rays and internal particle emitters. Who addressed that?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Researchers compared the "risk" to x-rays. Do you understand the difference between x-rays and internal emitters?
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish If you think ANY amount of radiation is "safe," then you are obviously a fake scientist. Good day.
@JayTCullen @girlyratfish Yeah, just like our investigative reports that lead to the opening of AG investigations are fake right? Get real!

@NickWalkerBIO Deal.
@aOhRiver The salmon discovered was last month. Let's see, what color are sockeye in November?
@aOhRiver The article was released with two headlines. The second: 1st Canadian Salmon Tests Positive For #Fukushima Radiation (Cesium 134)
@NickWalkerBIO Yeah, nothing to worry about. It's just like a banana! Let's all put our heads in the sand &amp; pretend Fukushima doesn't exist!
@NickWalkerBIO Lastly, how many of the millions upon millions of fish out there do you think have been tested?
@NickWalkerBIO The plant has been pumping radiation into the sea for over 5 years, so don't worry -- there's plenty more on the way.
@NickWalkerBIO You think it's only cesium 134 that's headed over here? That's what they test for because that's what they can pin to Fuku.
@NickWalkerBIO Yep. Fukushima has only put as much radioactivity into the ocean as is in a banana. You bet buddy. Whatever you say.
@aOhRiver In the article you can also read how the first Canadian sockeye salmon tested positive for cesium 134 last month. Big hype right!?

@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey but you see what we're saying though right in that WY votes count for more than people in MT. Why should it?
@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey to be clear the electoral college only affects elections. It doesn't affect policy toward the state's at all.
@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey BTW, electoral college doesn't effect the President's "pandering" or dealing with states at all.
@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey MT/WY = 3 vote each, but MT has more people. How is this fair? It make's Wyoming citizen's votes count for more.
@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey This is essentially what happens. The electoral college isn't even fair to rural states.
@JimKWeaver @McneelJeffrey Ok. Why should a person in rural Wyoming's vote count for let's say 1.25 people, and someone in NYC .75? Why?

@thepurplegreen To be sure. We're laughing cause you think we're getting "heated"/"frustrated." Our skin's a lot thinker than that over here
@thepurplegreen We already know all this. You actually haven't shown us anything new yet. But thanks for sending over the data.
@thepurplegreen We read it all already. Appreciate that.
@thepurplegreen HA! Makin' us laugh. But a great topic to be sure. Thanks for weighing in.
@thepurplegreen We're not idiots. We get nanos can be made of practically ANYTHING. Applications are endless -- some POTENTIALLY dangerous.
@thepurplegreen We didn't. But it's easy to research that bacteria won't do crap for getting plutonium out of the environment.
@thepurplegreen This one is cool.
@thepurplegreen Well if you've got bacteria that metabolizes plutonium, you definitely have "powerful knowledge" that we don't.
@thepurplegreen You're a scientist right? Anyhow, thanks for weighing in.
@thepurplegreen Seriously!? Once a radioisotope, ALWAYS a radioisotope - until it decays. No metabolic process (we're aware of) changes that
@thepurplegreen Excuse you. We are not as ignorant as you think. We have read ALL the material you sent over, and forwarded it. Thank you.
@thepurplegreen Yes, and we are forwarding them too.
@thepurplegreen But offer another solution: How should they remove the plutonium from Paducah's aquifer?
@thepurplegreen Better safe than sorry is a good approach. We don't want nano-sized plutonium particles floating around in the air.
@thepurplegreen (and obviously we acknowledge inhaling any ultra-fine particulate matter smaller than micron 2.5 can be dangerous)
@sbrinton Thanks for weighing in on that. It would seem the world could really use something like it.
@thepurplegreen Is there 1 study out there linking any kind of nano to disease? Or is it all "potential" at this point? If so, please send.
@thepurplegreen Also, can't nanos be practically anything? While some could be extremely dangerous, others could be passive. Is this wrong?
@thepurplegreen 404 error. Is there data demonstrating where nanos have definitively caused health problems, disease or ecological damage?
@thepurplegreen We do know, and we won't be debating anyone. You bring a proponent and opponent of the tech onto the show. It's called news.
@thepurplegreen Plutonium is a pretty dangerous substance to have floating around in the environment as well, isn't it?
@thepurplegreen That said, give us another way to clean up an oil spill 100% from water, or a way to clean plutonium out of an aquifer.
@thepurplegreen Thank you.
@thepurplegreen Of course. Better safe than sorry. Should have done that one w/ radioactive isotopes, but they KNOW radiation causes cancer.
@thepurplegreen Of course, and we have good people to look at it.
RT @daneyvilla: FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ANYONE https://t.co/3BEy9pPXt5
@thepurplegreen Also, some pretty impressive things in enviro cleanup are being done with them. This would be a great debate for our show!
@thepurplegreen And look, we're not advocating for nanos, but the jury seems to be out on the "potential" dangers.
@thepurplegreen Cool. Send it over.

@thepurplegreen The link U originally sent was not a study. It was full of speculation. We welcome any peer-reviewed science on this 4 sure.
@sbrinton Sure you bet. Are you familiar with the Roy Process? Anything to it? Could it be feasible?

@thepurplegreen Oh we're not. Just having a dialog. Thanks for weighing in on EnviroNews.
@thepurplegreen We're aware of those risks &amp; assumptions but that was far from "research." Plutonium is also very bad to have in an aquifer
