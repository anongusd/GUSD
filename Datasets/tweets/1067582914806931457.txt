@lome2us They all got sucked in.
And YES! He's a treasonous fucker. I think he, and his entire fucking family/ friends fell for it. They all smelled money. The rats completely followed the cheese.
Everyone watches the clown at the circus. Right behind the clown is the actual show. This is what's been happening. We completely focused on the clown, while the real deal was happening right behind him.

Trump was put there to make us look like a joke. We definitely are NOT a joke. He's merely been stupid enough to fall right into place. I'm disappointed in our media for falling for it too. Trump will die in jail, but our national security was the entire story all along
@timmyturmoil Take a deep breath, and realize what we can do/ have done. We got this! Trump is the circus clown put into place by Russia, do distract us and the media away from what's really happening. Behind our backs and right under our noses. Russia is being funded by Turkey, to fuck us up

@scottie_free Hug your family tight. We ALL got played
How many of us have felt like we're living in a bad cartoon? I'm 57 and every day is more dark and comical than the last! Trump was put there as a distraction. Even for our news media. Behind the scenes, Russia and Saudis have been banking and moving nuclear weapons
He's too fucking stupid to be evil.
Trump doesn't really matter. That big, sweaty, orange mess has been the circus clown to take our eyes off of what we should have been watching all along
We all got played. We all took our eyes off of the prize, which is our national security. Trump is merely a distraction. He won't matter at all in the end
@scottie_free Not if we take our focus off of trump and instead put our focus on whose going to stand right the fuck up to Russia right now. Trump is just a distraction
@scottie_free I think he's too stupid to care. He's like a kitten when a string is dangled. He never looked past the string
@scottie_free It's coming if we don't do something now. Right now. Hillary was made to lose because she knows putin. He wanted trump to win. He's stupid and has absolutely no knowledge of foreign policy. He was hand picked. Offer him money and stroke his ego and boom
@scottie_free They made us look away while they picked our pockets
@scottie_free No. Not good. Our safety..our national security has been shifted while we all watched the clown. Russia picked our pockets while we all fight amongst ourselves
@scottie_free And we'll all be dead because we put all our focus on the circus clown, like we all were supposed to
Don't you all see? Trump was put there as a comical distraction! Look past him. He's no longer important. While we all got riled up against him and focused on him, Russia has been continuously moving troops and trucks and arms around. Even our media just covered trump
@scottie_free Yes, but look away from the circus clown and pay attention to what's happening behind him
Read between the lines when you watch the news. Trump divided us, which was exactly what he was supposed to do. He's stupid and useless. It's why he was chosen. Get off focus of him and watch. He was merely chosen as the circus clown to focus on and take our eyes off of reality
Russia's economy is shit compared to ours. Unless they pair up to the Saudis. Trump got played. Russia on state TV is already saying they are at war with the US. They demonstrated their new supersonic nuclear armed missiles. Saying they will launch them next year. That's us!
Everyone...all news, all resisters...look away from the pawn and pay attention to what's quietly been happening behind our (in front of our backs) now!!!
Media, news correspondence, all of us got played. While we were watching the circus animal, Russia has been moving nuclear arms in.
Trump is the circus clown we were all supposed to watch while our pockets were being picked
@funder Lets get off trump. He's a stupid pawn in a shitty chess game. He'll go by the wayside. We wholly need to focus on national security now. Right fucking now

@NYPDONeill. What the absolute horrific hell was that? She has no chair, sits on the floor(what would you do?) And gets attacked? Her terrified crying child, ripped from her arms? Violence ensues and people get hurt. Wth crime did this mother commit?

I know we can't save everyone, but together we are a force. I don't even know her name. I apologize for that. She needs out of rikers and reunited with her terrified baby! Damnit! We are us! We are strong and we are better than this!!

Last year the same thing happened to someone's alpacas, but with a gun. I will NEVER understand cruelty to innocent people, children, or animals! Who the fuck is raising these monsters????
