I abhor the thought that this social chaos will become the new norm. I ask my GOP friends to consider the demographics of this country &amp; decide whether they think the social order they so desperately want to foist on the country will survive in an environment of mob justice.
But if the last, tenuous strands of faith in our already flawed system snap - as they will if Kavanaugh is confirmed tomorrow - then our country will enter a phase where righteous anger, justifiable or not, will dole out punishment and reward.
The point of a professional judiciary is precisely to avoid the foolishness &amp; knee-jerk responses that would otherwise be commonplace, if these types of decisions were left to people whose expertise is in everyday living, not in parsing out complicated legal issues.
Note to GOP: A system of justice must foster &amp; retain legitimacy so that rulings, even those that are unpopular, will be respected. A judicial system that lacks legitimacy leads to desperate people taking matters into their own hands. We do not want this. You ought not want this.

@FatGirlvsWorld The folks at the #whpeacevigil agree the closures have increased in frequency &amp; duration, with less obvious cause. In the absence of hard data I'll combine their anecdotal experience with my own to add this behavior to the list of changes associated with this administration.
@FatGirlvsWorld Also, the street is only closed directly in front of the White House, the rest of Penn. Ave. is open right now, including by the North entrance. It's strange compared to how it's worked for at least the two previous administrations (the limit of my experience by the White House).
@FatGirlvsWorld They don't close Pennsylvania Avenue for Marine One generally. It is usually closed when using the North entrance to the White House, but over the past year the street (or even the entirety of Lafayette Square) has been closed with no evidence of that entrance being used.
@FatGirlvsWorld Yes, the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue is common, but much more so lately, and for longer periods. It's a shame for the tourists!

Agreed, with one caveat.

@anniero2727 100% agree - I am hopeful, however, that the post-Gen-X generations will retain that flexibility longer than their forebears due to being not only inured to change but actually finding comfort in it. I think there is some evidence that this is happening, but only time will tell!
It's also a function of techno-cultural framework. Folks born after 1980 grew up finding comfort in consistent &amp; accelerating change. New or upgraded game systems, phones, computers, social networks - for us stability is, somewhat ironically, defined by the expectation of change. https://t.co/EtNAphoDq5

@BFunk88 It was unclear to me, but I wasn't able to stick around (they are scheduled to be there till 3:30 today). Could be set up for more extensive filming tomorrow (as the streets are scheduled to be closed till 8:30 pm tomorrow).
@BFunk88 I think tomorrow they will be filming further up Wisconsin Ave, as the section between M and P is scheduled to be closed at that time. Today it was the section between M and K (towards the Waterfront).
@BFunk88 I definitely think they are prepping for stunts, and they have the bridge carrying Wisconsin Ave closed off. But just as I was leaving they were using the crane to lower a round black object, a little larger than a bowling ball, gently down into the water.
@Siefmeister Not sure but it wouldn't surprise me. I know they were (are?) filming at Landmark in NOVA as well.

This thread is a well-curated reminder that black bodies, &amp; the minds that inhabit them, are implicitly (&amp; often explicitly) deemed less valuable than, &amp; subject to control by, whites. This gap in value &amp; agency is reified daily by our institutions, whose structures abhor change. https://t.co/bRxGVSEDvH

And while we are at it, save for some ridiculously unfortunate transphobia, the first Crocodile Dundee is a perfect film. The story, structure, and pace blend together to form the most effective romance in the history of cinema. I remain sincere on this point!
It's a crime that Linda Kozlowski didn't get more roles. Her work in both Crocodile Dundee and Crocodile Dundee II is breathtaking. This tweet reads as sarcastic or flippant but I am entirely sincere.

Were it easier to change electoral structures in the US, I would advocate for some variation on a slate-based system for House elections, which would be the best way to ensure representative ratios of the electorate and would ease the path for additional political parties.
This of course will be read as good news for Democrats, but it should be considered good news to any American that believes in free and fair elections. Both major parties have abused the district-drawing process, and that must stop. https://t.co/E4sPolcJl6
Strength comes from sincerity &amp; humility, not the petulant lashing out at those who won't acquiesce to your selfish demands. There are many distasteful ways humans attempt to assert control over the will of others, but none signify congenital weakness so thoroughly as violence.
If you beat a person, you are weak. If you rape a person, you are weak. If you need to threaten or use violence to bend a person to your will, you are weak. That weakness rapidly congeals into a palpable vulnerability that even the strongest fists can't hide.

Ultimately, a lack of representation leads to social &amp; political instability, especially if the population believes they have exhausted political remedies for their concerns. Reduced faith in political institutions is a precursor for social chaos. (5/5)
As a result, Virginia, which is demonstrably a "blue" state based on pure vote totals, nevertheless sends 7 Republicans to the House, but only 4 Democrats. Given this disconnect, it is not surprising people do not feel represented. (4/5)
In my home state of Virginia, a tidal-wave election wherein Democrats had a 9% advantage nevertheless resulted in the Virginia House of Delegates remaining under GOP control. Virginia has similar issues in terms of federal representation in the House. (3/5)
Perhaps more importantly, Trump was elected despite receiving 3 million fewer votes than his opponent, and similar disconnects between the number of votes cast and candidates that actually get elected are becoming rampant at both the federal and local levels. (2/5)
It is also worth noting that, while their is rarely a 1:1 agreement between government action &amp; popular sentiment, a huge proportion of the policies being implemented by Trump et al are not supported by majorities of the affected population. (1/5) https://t.co/knQzcPwer3

Thus it becomes much easier to conclude that Kelly et al are not merely willing to ignore abusive behavior by staff &amp; compatriots, but actively identify with them. Why else would you take the risk &amp; effort to defend someone for whom a long list of replacements is available? (3/3)
So while the defense of Moore was clearly unforgivable, it was possible (if perhaps not entirely plausible) to pass it off as a desperate, cynical strategy to maintain the balance of power in the Senate. There is no such excuse for actively protecting Porter. (2/3)
The extra-upsetting thing here is that, as detestable as it was for so many in the GOP, including Trump, to support Roy Moore, at least there was a Machiavellian logic to the tactic in terms of retaining power. Porter, however, is an easily replaceable staff member! (1/3) https://t.co/Jbic5l3YzE

The political label for a policy (liberal/conservative/moderate/etc) is irrelevant relative to the practical effects of that policy. It is clear that, whether through malice, greed, ignorance, or incompetence, the governing philosophy of Oklahoma is failing its people. (6/6)
Because their goal is to maximize share value or commodity price, instead of the well-being of their constituents, political leaders in places like Oklahoma have corrupted the generally accepted algorithm for governance, i.e., to craft policy for the benefit of the people. (5/6)
Yet this is not what is happening in Oklahoma (nor indeed in much of the US &amp; around the world). Instead, these governments are seeking to maximize the benefit for special interests (like the oil industry) and then asserting that these benefits will devolve to the people. (4/6)
The idea, generally assumed by people in democratic societies, is that the motivator for action is the maximization of benefits for the people who make up those societies, and that there are many ways polices can be designed &amp; implemented to achieve those benefits. (3/6)
It is conceivable that, in an effort to best serve the people, the government of the people would choose to create favorable conditions for industries - like Oklahoma does with oil &amp; gas extraction. This may produce jobs, increased revenues, or other benefits. (2/6)
There spectrum of meritorious political philosophies is broad, and no single perspective has a monopoly on good ideas. However, a political philosophy that favors industry over the polity is doomed to fail that polity. (1/6) https://t.co/j05qUZukWm

Liberals don't have a monopoly on good ideas, nor do conservatives have a monopoly on bad ideas or corruption. Plenty of sensible conservative ideas that are worthy of consideration are being kept from debate because the GOP simply cannot be trusted to govern any longer.
Americans (&amp; I'm at the top of this list) are eager to return to a time when we can sincerely &amp; fairly consider candidates from different parties based on their ideas, not whether or not we fear they will actively loot the nation's economic &amp; cultural wealth for self-enrichment.
Only when you've extricated yourselves from the monolithic, purity-test-laden, white ethno-nationalist pseudo-philosophy of the modern GOP will you be able to compete in the marketplace of ideas again (sans cheating, lying, &amp; undermining core political &amp; social institutions).
Republicans who claim your party left you: it did not. You gave it away in a grab for power in 2010, wittingly ceding control to the faux-grassroots, racially-motivated Tea Party. Those who retain a defensible conservative political philosophy need to abandon the GOP &amp; re-brand.

@reedfrich Ostensibly is such an excellent word! But your sentiment was clear and correct - it is a bizarre thing for people to grow up thinking the flag or any other symbol is more important that the ideals it ostensibly symbolizes. A symbol is meaningless without something to represent!
There's no better expression of being an American than to speak truth to power or, more colloquially, to tell the state to "go fuck itself." People who don't even feel that strongly will express this sentiment from time to time just to reaffirm their freedom to do so.
One type of example that comes up repeatedly is this bizarre notion that we must not (or, to to more fascistic among us, may not) criticize the United States, even though our self-identity as a nation is based largely on our right to do exactly that.
It takes an American to not understand what is to be be American!

Like closing down Lafayette Square to the public &amp; filling it with machine gun-toting officers, Trump's casual demand for the press to be ejected was the sort of authoritarian theater I expect he thinks impresses President Nazarbeyev. He's probably right. https://t.co/IaQ8Spc8MF
Note the factual inconsistency here: "current immigration policy" versus "open borders." This man is a fool and a liar, and those convinced by his haphazardly thrown together "arguments" should be ashamed (but, sadly, many have been conditioned not to be). https://t.co/KekX1bnvlY
@TomCottonAR I'm confused - do the Republicans not control the Senate, the House, and the Presidency? How are the Democrats responsible for any shutdown? Why do you find it so easy to lie to your constituents about your role in gumming-up good faith negotiations resolve the budget issue?
The Secretary of Homeland Security has demonstrated she will happily lie under oath. The scary thing isn't even that she's willing to lie under oath, but that she seems confident that she won't get in trouble for the lying despite how obvious it is. https://t.co/9yEyg5ddFu
