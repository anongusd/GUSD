The projection of racism onto conservatives is just that, projection. The KKK was born out of the democratic party and it was Lincoln who freed the slaves. GOP gave slaves freedom, citizenship, and the right to vote.

History and truth are kryptonite to the modern democratic party platform in America
The 14th amendment which gave citizenship to freed slaves had 94% republican support and 0% democratic support.
The 15th amendment which gave everyone the right to vote was 100% republican support and 0% democrat support.
More Republicans Voted for the Civil Rights Act as a Percentage Than Democrats Did.
@willcollective @skrealestate @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump mugshots and police records are totally opinions and not official records, right?
Democrats want the citizenship question off of the census specifically to gain representation in border states.

@BoonieKane @MurderTownBlues An unconstitutional plan if you ask me. Unelected leadership is bullshit. The problem is more symptomatic than you might want to admit. Flint should have never been this far into bankruptcy to begin with.
@MurderTownBlues @BoonieKane It would have been fine, if it had been treated properly by competent government officials.
@BoonieKane @MurderTownBlues Yes, I am. Legionella naturally occurs. It blooms to risky levels in the water because the water system is serving a much smaller population than it was designed for. This causes low flow rate and stagnant water. Would you like to know more?

@BoonieKane @MurderTownBlues I don't believe in emergency management. We can agree there. Blaming the emergency managers is shortsighted and ignores the long history that lead up to the water crisis.
@BoonieKane @MurderTownBlues Actually they were local decisions made in the water plant. The water itself wasn't toxic, it's that it was not treated for corrosion control. The city was in the situation because it's tax-base moved out and the city went bankrupt.
@BoonieKane @MurderTownBlues I think you are the one with the withdrawn political opinion. Blaming the state governor for local mismanagement that stems from long before his term ever began. Flint is run by fucking morons.

@CBJOHNSON143 @ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch Ditto. The numbers don't lie. Obama lost the 2008 popular vote in the primaries.
@parrotkind @ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch The data confirms Obama lost the popular vote in the 2008 primaries. You cannot rewrite history.
@parrotkind @ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch #WalkAway
@troll_engager I'm well aware - Michigan patriot over here. Obama lost the popular vote in 2008 primary. You can't rewrite history
@parrotkind @ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch Obama lost the popular vote in 2008 primary
@troll_engager Obama lost the popular vote in 2008
@TheFuggle @WaluigiSoap Your lame ass analogy doesn't carry weight. Obama losing the popular vote but winning the nomination is very similar to other instances of candidates winning elections without the popular vote.
@TheFuggle @WaluigiSoap I brought up 2008 to demonstrate that the crying about popular vote is inconsistent. To be clear, those who are against the process would never have gotten Obama as their champion if they had the rules how they wanted.
@TheFuggle @WaluigiSoap enlighten me, since you're such a big thinker
@ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch yea, democrats were unfiar to themselves. Hillary hijacked the DNC and railroaded Bernie Sanders. She siphoned his donations and stole his election data. Donna Brazile wrote all about it in her book. Look up the JFA Joing Funding Agreement.
@TheFuggle @WaluigiSoap You're literally agreeing with me that Obama lost the popular vote.
@ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch Pointing out that losing the primary vote and winning the race doesn't matter to democrats when it's their champion taking the prize. Double standards!
@WaluigiSoap @TheFuggle So you'll agree that democrats rig their own primaries? Shall we look at Arizona democratic primary between Bernie and HRC?
@MichiganDems Michigan Democrats are a failure of an institution. Flint, Saginaw, and Detroit are all SHIT HOLES because of Democratic leadership. Both locally and nationally. You can look at NAFTA or you can look at local policy. No matter where you look, you see democrats ruining America
@MLive SJW vs Bigots
@ChrisKuhi @Scout_Finch Don't hate the player hate the game. For the crazy left they want to change the rules when it suits them while they're also gaming the system the whole time. If there weren't double standards the left wouldn't have standards at all.

@jvfnyc @robleisure @JohnBrennan You're awfully emotional for an adult, the name calling is a sign you're out of your element
@jvfnyc @robleisure @JohnBrennan Russia doing things does not implicate President Trump. Russian agents helped Steele cook up the dossier that the DNC paid for. Your DNC emails were leaked by Seth Rich not Russia. If the hack bothers you maybe HRC shouldn't have hosted her own server out of a bathroom....
@jvfnyc @robleisure @JohnBrennan Paul Manafort is not Donald Trump and the crimes in question happened a long time ago. Remember that Manafort only worked for Trump for 3 months....

@robleisure @jvfnyc @JohnBrennan If you're not familiar with American law there's due process here where someone is presumed innocent until proven guilty. If you think President Trump is guilty of a crime you have to prove it. Special Counsel has presented no evidence of collusion. Stuck on bank fraud from 2000s
@robleisure @jvfnyc @JohnBrennan If you have evidence of collusion I'd be happy to look at it. Do you have any?

@jvfnyc @JohnBrennan Trump was elected fair and square. Brennans petty and partisan rhetoric not to mention repeated leaks of Intel are why he lost his clearance.

So while you can find a loophole to make yourself technically correct. You're missing the point entirely and just skewing numbers to stroke your man
@jwrightNOVA @thehill By all means @jwrightNOVA make a citation and prove me wrong. Obama did not have a single year of GDP growth at 3% or higher.
@ClaytheSchwartz @thehill Read again more slowly. "Obama did not have a single YEAR of GDP growth at 3% or above."

#SethRich, was murdered for exposing the truth behind the fake 'Russian hack.' Seth Rich leaked emails to Wikileaks because he saw what was happening. His leak threatened their entire operation. Bill Binney and VIPS showed that the "hack" was local transfer - not wire tramission.

@juschlln @NBCPolitics Typical liberal fights on emotion alone. I care probably more than you do since I'm working on fixing it and you just want to create outrage and #resist - You'll never be separated from your kids if you don't break the law. There's no reason to break into USA.
@Sagebeguile @DMore0 @MSNBC It's in due process already, if you commit a crime you get locked up - whether you have kids or not. Police take parents away from their children every day in America. Is it only Mexicans that you think should be allowed to violate laws without repercussion?
@Sagebeguile @DMore0 @MSNBC You're having to reach in scope to fudge numbers to work for you. Look at before &amp; after the migrant invite from Merkel. There's a very sharp spike in violent crimes, especially those sexual in nature.

@ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't make laws. That's the role of congress, not the executive branch. This is government 101 so maybe its YOU who is willfully ignorant.
@ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump If you cared about the kids why wait until June 2018 to say something about it. These laws have been on the books since the early 90s. Its the democratic left who's using these kids as political pawns. It's POTUS who's trying to pass immigration reform. Cognitive Dissonance.

@JanoBallesteros @carol_NC66 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump General Flynn was on the transition team and had explicit permission to be communicating with Russian diplomats. It was literally his job.
@BruceElias3 @ElwoodBrew2 @confusedCoyote @DBKay84 @realDonaldTrump he's a good president unless you're wishing for that obama dream of handouts for zero work
@annarjt @ryankelleher85 @confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump You mean like Clinton and McCain working with Russian agents via Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS. You act like you care about Russian interference but you refuse to talk about the real interference and instead focus on made up stories.
@Kentjones17 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Read what you wrote, it doesnt even make sense. Russia dies? Firing who? Mouthing off by saying what?
@confusedCoyote @JoeBlow31581725 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Can't happen, indictments are actions from the DOJ. You would be asking the president to indict himself - cannot happen. President can only be taken up on impeachment.
@Kentjones17 @ElwoodBrew2 @Matthew010914 @realDonaldTrump Steele collected intel from Russian agents to create the Fusion GPS dossier. I'm fine with you being hard on russian influence but you should at least get your facts straight with who did what
@swsharpe3 @confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump That's not what they were doing, that's what Obama was doing with the steele dossier, iran deal and uranium one scandal
@great_jantzitsu @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump wrong, they were acting on behalf of a duly elected president. The constitution grants him all executive action
@rvaughanw @realDonaldTrump who brought up race and when? maybe its you who's the racist - twisting everything everyone says into a victimization
@ElwoodBrew2 @confusedCoyote @rpeterson2317 @tarchill @ryankelleher85 @realDonaldTrump Like it or not she played a very big role on the world stage and her name is all over the troubles our world faces. Liberals HATE when you bring up Obama and Clinton because the dirt they have is insurmountable
@_GuardianAngel8 @ElwoodBrew2 @DBKay84 @confusedCoyote @realDonaldTrump Obama won't get prosecuted, if it comes close he'll get pardoned. Kerry, Clinton, Holder, Strzok, Comey and the rest? Might not get so lucky
@ElwoodBrew2 @Right_This_Ship @confusedCoyote @realDonaldTrump it wasnt normal for Obama to have policies that undermine the American people
@confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @DBKay84 @realDonaldTrump between election day and inauguration day is when you have the transition team doing their business creating a seamless transition for foreign powers around the world. Obama admin knows its winding down and they allow the transition team to do their job
@AlSharptonXXXXL @ryankelleher85 @confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Guarantee they had approval from the active administration at the time. You can't just fly around the world negotiating on behalf of the USA willy nilly

@DayVarcia @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump ask a russian
@ElwoodBrew2 @DBKay84 @confusedCoyote @realDonaldTrump He was saying that after the election was planning on going to continue his foreign pursuits. Obama thought he was the president for life. WRONG.
@CandaceLane53 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump We call it a witch hunt because that's what Obama's administration called the legal challenges to their Fast &amp; Furious scandal. I wish more people knew the meanings behind things.
@ElwoodBrew2 @confusedCoyote @realDonaldTrump Obama administration had granted the transition team the ability to begin conversations. It's normal procedure and process for the transition team to do so, its their job. We should rejoice in the fact that @realDonaldTrump 's approach was 180 degrees different from Obama's
@Toni_is_Trouble @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump fortunately the obama team was just crying out loud there, its not a violation of logan act for a transition team to speak to foreign nations. In fact, it's their job.
@Kentjones17 @ElwoodBrew2 @Matthew010914 @realDonaldTrump they violated his civil rights because they didnt want him to win the presidency
@RandyMa63934481 @realDonaldTrump name one treasonous act, you cant

@LucyAppa @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Example?
@LucyAppa @realDonaldTrump He is, watch the Iran deal. How do you explain North Korea?
@rwhitaker23 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Flynn was working for the government as a legitimate member of the transition team. He had explicit permission to act on behalf of the government. John Kerry is no longer the secretary of state and its illegal to play play diplomat without being a true representative of the USA
@confusedCoyote @rpeterson2317 @tarchill @ryankelleher85 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Left wingers hate when Obama or HRC come up in the conversation. Those two are toxic. But they're still active. Kerry is out selling his iran deal even though he's no longer secretary of state. It's illegal
@BTDK81 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump what illegal doings?
@carol_NC66 @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Kerry is no longer the secretary of state. If you're not a certified diplomat you cannot go travel the world cutting deals on behalf of the USA. It's illegal and it's called the logan act.
@Nonzknows @ryankelleher85 @confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump It's delusional for Kerry to think he's still representing the government. Going around acting like a diplomat. It IS illegal
@confusedCoyote @ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump How can a transition team violate the Logan act when it's literally their job
@ElwoodBrew2 @realDonaldTrump Logan act violations, this isn't trumps  creation and it's not a made up law. Kerry might be the first to seriously violate it.

@Amon_Cornix @Wario_man @VHayek214 @PPact If being sentient is your basis for life then why do we keep elders with dementia around. What about kids born with major problems or disorders that make them a vegetable... are you saying they can be killed without a second thought too? Just poking at your inconsistencies
@Amon_Cornix @Wario_man @VHayek214 @PPact Neither sperm nor an egg alone represent new life. The combination of the two,when the DNA mixes, is when life begins. This is why people say the origin of life is conception.

@Amon_Cornix @Wario_man @VHayek214 @PPact I get why you would want to avoid the word abortion but "pro choice" just means that you support abortion

@VuhJJDentata @bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact if your version of uterine freedom is killing babies then you don't deserve autonomy
@VuhJJDentata @bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact And then you voluntarily entered the conversation before claiming that I'm obsessed with your uterus... even though you joined and brought it up. Clearly you wish SOMEONE cared about your uterus
@VuhJJDentata @bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact I was talking to someone else and you butted into this conversation.
@FBIPortland @BeavertonPolice Will he do something about Epstein or is this just more empty rhetoric from the FBI?
@VuhJJDentata @bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact Your projection invalidates your argument. Instead it makes you look like a manhater. abortion isnt a gender issue at all - it takes both genders to come together and create new life.
@VuhJJDentata @bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact lol no one mentioned gender at all
@VuhJJDentata @Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact You can't debate so you avoid the topic and resort to empty rhetoric. Gotcha. Good luck with that and I hope your morality catches up with you later in life.
@VuhJJDentata @Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact Well you literally said that you don't care about babies...

@VuhJJDentata @Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact In your case I'd allow it because you probably shouldn't be reproducing
@Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact A baby can be born as early as 24 weeks and survive. You're making up science to support your position. Abortion is murdering babies and there's not much you're going to say to convince anyone. You're more ugly on the inside than you are on the outside - and thats saying somethin
@Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact Dude you look like you survived an abortion. You're here being a white knight. Its obvious you hold these views because you're daydreaming about actually getting laid. You don't value life at all; abortion is an insurance policy for sluts who live hedonistic lifestyles.
@bufflax191721 @Wario_man @PPact nice post @bufflax191721
@Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact its you claiming that life begins at delivery rather than conception
@Wario_man @PPact This is where you get to explain to me why an unborn child isnt a person, go on now
@Wario_man @PPact You asked for a citation and I gave it to you.
@Wario_man @bufflax191721 @PPact You're wrong, you dont get to kill someone else just because you want to. The 'my body, my choice' argument falls flat because the baby is literally a different person.
@Wario_man @PPact The CDC reports that there have been over 44 million abortions in the USA since 1970. PP is the #1 abortion clinic.

@CBSNews He's gonna get grilled
@rjd2 That's cool we can leave it here. We'll chat about the next one
@rjd2 "We've never gone bankrupt before so let's keep spending more than we make." Retarded.
@rjd2 How much debt do you have to accrue before the levy breaks? This is retarded logic.
@rjd2 Asking me to do your legwork is poor form - stick to the debate and look up your own data points. If you are going to just play games then you can take a hike. The trade relationship with China has been really bad for a really long time. I am giving you numbers, you ignore them.
@rjd2 How long can you go on spending more than you make? Depends how fat your wallet is and how great the difference in income/cost. The answer is that you can't run a deficit forever. And 500+ billion a year is a monstrous deficit.
@rjd2 Lol what happens to everyone that spends more than they make? Bad things! Bankruptcy for an individual. Defaulting or credit ranking downgrades on your debt for a nation. Greece on the brink. Zimbabwe has runaway inflation and its currency was devalued to zero. Stupid question. https://t.co/bjSfbJ6Q9Z
@rjd2 We have a 20 trillion dollar national debt. It doubled under Obama's term. It's easy to know that spending more than you make is a dead end. Sooner than later we'll be called upon our debt to the central banks.
@rjd2 Fair trade not free trade. We don't want our labor force competing on a level playing field with human rights abusers and slave labor. We must also protect our national security by maintaining steel and aluminum industries here in USA.
@rjd2 If it goes on for a long extended period of time and it if it undermines domestic industries then yes of course. But not always; trade is complex and hinges on the resources and needs of each party. Trade should be reciprocal and a half trillion loss per year is bunk.
@rjd2 Think of it this way... would you like to lose 566 billion a year if it was your own money out of your own pocket?
@rjd2 I also pointed out to you the 500 billion annual deficit when you were asking for "data points." You can quit this conversation but don't pretend that its because the discourse inst substantive enough for you. You're just getting schooled.
@rjd2 Trump and his policy are literally what we're talking about and how this entire conversation started with my replying to your grandstanding about his policy. To bow out now because you don't want to argue about Trump shows you have no idea what you're even on about.
@rjd2 I answered directly. This is not a typical moment in history and there's nothing about this administration that fits historical molds. I called you an idiot because you called Trump stupid. You match the historical definition of an idiot. An uninformed voter doing disservice. https://t.co/cW0W17inaK
@rjd2 Hows 500 billion a year in trade deficit as a hard data point?

@rjd2 It's the common thread of entertainment telling people what to think. The fame and attention turns leads you to detachment from the common people who buy the art that gives you the luxury. It's a symptom of fame that infects almost everyone.
@rjd2 Does anything at all about this current presidency fit the historical trend? Lets watch and see
@rjd2 Creating art for a career is a luxury that very few get to enjoy. Most people are slaving away to make their mortgage payments which are mostly interest.
@rjd2 The US has every right to implement tariffs our defect is out of control. China gets to come to the table and discuss trade relations. Beyond that they're cleaning up their act on other fronts because of the new scrutiny. There might be some downsides but its net positive++++++++
@rjd2 It's not. and I like some of your music but its not much of an intellectual platform to call a guy stupid who's dealing with things you have no idea about
@rjd2 We have our domains and I dont think politics is yours
@rjd2 You bang objects to make sounds and you're calling POTUS stupid? He beat 18 seasoned veteran politicians and won a groundbreaking election that was rigged against him.
@rjd2 All metrics for the economy indicate we're doing great. Its OK for the indexes to be down when its the nasty tech companies that are bringing it down as they sink. RIP Amazon, RIP facebook, RIP twitter, and RIP tesla
