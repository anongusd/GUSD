No questions about human rights in North Korea?
Trump press conference in Vietnam over. Now heading back to D.C.
“I have.” Trump says when asked by @DavidNakamura if he has confronted Kim on Otto Warmbier, but says that “top leadership” in North Korea probably didn’t know about his condition. 		“I don’t believe that he would have allowed it to happen … he felt very badly about it.”
Trump says that the walkout with Kim was "friendly" and that the two leaders shook hands before departing.
Trump comments that he was a “little impressed” by the fact that Michael Cohen admitted that there was “no collusion” with Russia
“I think having a fake hearing like that, and having it in the middle of this very important summit is a very terrible thing,” Trump says about Cohen show.
“I work in radio and TV” says Sean Hannity, as he asks Trump if he is acting like Ronald Reagan by walking away from talks with Kim Jong-Un
Trump says that it was a “productive two days” with Kim Jong-Un but “sometimes you have to walk.”
“We just left Chairman Kim … we thought and I thought that it wasn’t a good thing to be signing anything,” Trump said.

TRUMP: "I have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. President Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein in Iraq ... had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? Those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing..."
Trump on withdrawing from Afghanistan: "I think everybody's tired. We got to get out of these endless wars and bring our folks back home."
