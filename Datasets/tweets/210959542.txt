Keeping a tally of stories that get SCOTUS ruling wrong.  This one suggests, wrongly, that it could impact CA VRA: http://t.co/04jvMDAJpm
VRA Tidbit: in 2011 the CRC drew BOE lines with 3:1 Dem advantage.  @MattRexroad blew that up on last day based on Monterey Sec 5 issue.
Sorry, @johnhrabe no taint to be found in VRA decision, but lots of exposed taint in past decisions.  #taintmaster http://t.co/G0IubA3p0r
SCOTUS ruling has no impact on voting rights act cases in CA - almost all of which are using the state law to abolish at-large elections.
Reporters: remember, Sec 5 counties in 2011 were Merced, Kings, Yuba and Monterey.  BUT... Merced got a bailout.  No longer under Sec 5.
SCOTUS VRA ruling basically says "I'm not saying what you did was wrong, but how you decided where to do it was."
True Dat... MT “@johnmyers: Consider this: CA commission drew virtually entire map starting w/counties affected by provisions SCOTUS nixed”
In 2011 the Bay Area lines were constrained by unwillingness to cross Golden Gate or push south b/c of Monterey Sec 5. That changes for 2021
SCOTUS ruling could make 2021 redraw easier in Central Valley / Central  Coast.  Even Bay Area districts were impacted by Monterey Sec.5.
SCOTUS ruling means methodology for placing Monterey, Yuba, Kings and Merced under Section 5 was unconstitutional.  Won't impact 2011 lines.

In AD46 some may call for recount, but the 35 vote margin in a 6-way race is equivalent to a 140 vote margin in a 2-way race. That's tough.
If your poll has the question mid-way through "would you like to take a bathroom break?" then it is too long.

@tedlieu @johnmyers the gap will go up and down based on where vts are.  My calc (using cty total x Outstanding) isn't perfect, but a guide.

More important to follow a straight freeway line (405) than squiggle through the streets when dividing the Valley.
RT @dphoward: The real Hollywood now includes Burbank.

East Ventura county should be with Santa clarita valley in a senate seat.
Speaker said 405 destroyed van nuys and communities. It is not a divider. The valley is whole.
Arguments over the Valley. Are Glendale, Agoura, Calabasas, Westlake part of the Valley???
Connect those in SFV with SGV along mountains and public lands.
West SFV is 669,000 people if agoura and calabasas included.
West SFV is 669,000 if shouts and calabasas included.
