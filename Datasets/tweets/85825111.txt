@BarbaraAnnRI @IanDon @kathyprojo @ThePublicsRadio Late term abortion is a term most people understand. They also understand that these are only 1% of procedures done and only when the health and welfare of the mother or another catastrophic event may necessitate it. These are infrequent, wrenching procedures and decisions.
@IanDon @kathyprojo @ThePublicsRadio @projo @ABC6 Maybe they should have an actual medical doctor speak to them about the gruesome ,fanciful ‚Äúpartial birth abortion‚Äù term used; which is not real and most certainly  not a medical term or procedure.
@kathyprojo No. Creating hysteria and making preposterous statements which of course, would cause someone to answer ‚Äúno‚Äù. Legitimate surveys  of Americans across the country have consistently shown support for Roe v. Wade.
