@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Oh wow you convinced me. Guess I'll be voting for Trump in 2020. 		Lmao
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP You may not agree but then again YOU and I are not the POUTUS who prefers people that work for him to look good on TV. It's not a lie, it's a reality that's been in place since he took office.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Not sure how my initial comment applied so many racial slurs onto the Majority of America. I'm sorry if you have ever faced or encountered racial discrimination.  		It sucks. America of 2018 should be better than that.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Somehow I became the Democratic party, I was completely unaware I wielded such power!		As my first order of business as head of the Democratic Party,  is to declare that all Fridays henceforth will casual Fridays.

@PoliticallyRig1 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Lmao who's whining?
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Funny cause my initial comment that started this whole back and forth was strictly and observation about a photo. 		Remember when I mentioned context to you?
@US1StrongAgain @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Just what exactly have I parroted? I dont recall voting for Obamacare.  But please continue to apply your disagreements with the entire Democratic party completely on to little individual me.

@US1StrongAgain @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I'm incompetent for not wanting to review the detailed specifics of the Tax revision with you?		I'll admit truthfully,  I did reply back to you but got sidetracked replying to others in this thread.	I forgot about you.		Sorry man.

Republican Voters = diverse, multi ethnic,  multi Religious affiliation 	Republican Leadership = rich old white men
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Never did I once bring up or mention "Quota" or some nonsensical need for one. Your applying so much to just a simple observational Twitter comment. Keep going cause I'm loving it! 		Lmao https://t.co/gY7kUh0rLB

@twann62 @KnyLori @Kay76187003 @Sgperformer @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Why exactly would the black caucus be invited to the GOP and Trump administration celebrating their victory of passing the Tax and Jobs act?  		That makes absolutely no sense. But keep reaching,  I've got free time today and need entertainment.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP So I guess I should abandon all my rational thinking and vote Trump simply because a photo exists of an Old black woman showing him affection? 		Lmao please, before you continue to reply to me, at least pause, apply some critical thinking skills then submit your reply.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Trump replaced nearly his entire appointed cabinet within his first year. It's been well documented that he does hire based on outer appearance because he likes people to look good on TV. Remember Bolton almost didnt make it cause of his  mustache.
@Pseudologichunt @blondi2261 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Yeah man, you nailed it üíØ. My boss was giving me a hard time when I dropped a large fries on the floor. So I got mad and went to Twitter to make observational comments about year old group photos!
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Also everyone who got all worked up over my simple comment seem to all be of one specific political party. 		Hint it's not the Dems being snowflakes. Read the comments in the thread. Then tell me again who needs to grow up.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP My initial comment was a simple observation. You'll find by reading some of the replies in the thread that people have somehow taken offense and became snowflakes all worked up about it.		Guess what,  the majority of those commenting back have applied the implication of racism.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP See this photo is different than the one I initially commented on. I probably wouldn't even make a comment in this one because it's just the Trump family on a stage. They aren't a large non inclusive non diverse group of Political Leadership. Apples are not oranges.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Would you like a participation award since you grandpa lived on a Reservation? 		I have a ton of family living on the Navajo Reservation.  Maybe I should get a participation award too since I spent my youth growing up there.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP No one making me do or say anything. Ever hear of being an individual? Free speech granted to Americans under the 1st ammendment? 		My comments are my own. Not dictated by political party, party beliefs, whatever problems I point out are issues I've observed and researched.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Sorry I dont read source from cable news. Just to be clear that concerns ALL cable news. Just so you dont label me biased or a CNN or MSNBC fanboy.
@DeplorablyUrs2 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Sensitive much? How am I desperate to label or prove an entire ethnic group is racist by leaving a comment on a year old picture on Twitter? 		Keep reaching. I am enjoying my life thank you and take care.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP How am I the Democratic party?  	Lmao somehow my individual comment speaks for an entire political party? If I go outside and shout "Its hot outside", does that mean the Democratic party is commenting on climate change?
@ThisPerson34532 @blondi2261 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Wow I didnt know that You personally were as Rich and well off as the men in the photo. Congratulations on being a multimillionaire!		Why waste your time on Twitter bruh? Not having fun living that life of luxury?
@gallagher_lai @Sgperformer @KarenBeChirico @KnyLori @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP How does my pointing out that the year old Picture has mostly white men calling YOU or anyone a racist?  I've been voting since 2003, I've voted for Republicans, Democrats, and even the occasional Green Party candidate.		The only one improving my life is me. Not the government.
@gallagher_lai @TrishaW04 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP So by pointing out the obvious in a year old photo, its somehow playing the victim card? https://t.co/gquSXZDea8
@gallagher_lai @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Walk away from the Plantation? 		And I'm somehow the racist in this thread? 		Go sit down and read an American History book, if you can't,  have someone help you. The adults are in here talking. This conversation seems way above your level of understanding
@nycfla @blondi2261 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Sorry I already voted. Guess what, I did my research, chose candidates that I best felt were qualified for the position.  Regardless of ethnicity,  or political affiliation. 		And yes I am a smart guy.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP This makes no sense. I didnt have to go to Washington to make a comment about a year old photo. 		This is by far the longest reaching I've come across in this thread.  Thank you for your comment lmao
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Just what exactly does Obama have to do with the comment that I made regarding the photo of the Trump administration celebrating the passing of the Tax and Jobs Act last year?		Context and understanding might be hard to grasp,  but I have faith you will get there.
@klcecotti I guess Kellyanne was having a mild stroke when asked to name more than one right? 		Perhaps you should reach out to the White House and make sure she got some medical attention.
@klcecotti https://t.co/IW5syO69Ur
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP The Democratic party has no influence on my ability to comment about a photo. The picture is also a year old. 	If Trump wanted more diversity within his Administration, he as the Chief Executive has the ability to make changes. A year later and it's mostly all White males.
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Be careful, some people within your Political Party might label you another Pocahontas! 		How does my pointing out the obvious in the photo make me victim? I'm not looking for problems, I'm pointing out the obvious in a photo more than a year old		Republican snowflakes grow up
@jammy33 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Lmao Just what exactly do "Black Rappers" have to do with the comment I left about the year old photo.  		Also fun fact, you will find more diversity among Rappers than you will find in the photo. 		Lmao https://t.co/q3giFI5ACr

@DeplorablyUrs2 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Did you miss the wildebeest cropped out on the far right that proved this photo is not just about Elephants!  		Lmao https://t.co/zRbSnq4dIl
@DeLoachJW @blondi2261 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Carried to the front of the line on litters?		You didnt get the joke about them not having to wait for anything did you lmao. That's okay I had a good laugh.
@suezeecue56 Explain to me how exactly I'M playing the victim card by pointing out the obvious. 		Hey they're more Men than Women in this Photo!	Hey there mostly caucasians present in the Photo!	Hey theres only one American Flag in the photo! 	Why are there only three people with red ties?
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I'm okay with all people, Republicans, Democrats, Americans, non Americans. 		I'm okay with Human beings. Can you comprehend that?		Lol I'll wait, cause I'm sure someone will call me a Speciesist
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I could just as easily pointed out the Gender disparity with the photo as well. Guess what, it reflects the Republican party leaders. 		Meanwhile the Republican voters are a very diverse group. Why does the leadership not accurately reflect the voter base?
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Funny how I leave a little comment which points out the obvious in a photo over a year old, and Republicans are upset and calling me a racist.  I didn't take the photo. I didn't crop the one black person half way out.
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Pay attention to this years midterm candidates.  There is a stark contrast in who is running for Republican seats and who is running for Democratic seats.
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP We are currently in the year 2018, Diversity is reflected within one political party more than the other. If I had collage to compare Democrats to Republicans, what are the odds that Old wealthy white men make up the Republican. They also lack  when it comes to Women.
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Not by the color of their skin, but by their actions and the policy they choose to pursue while in office. Hows that.  Open a History book, look at all the white men who have run this country since its inception.  Some have been great, some have been  bad.
@EmersenLee Yes yes always the counter examples of wealth from the Dems side. Guess what, fun fact Obama and Clinton cant hurt you cause they aren't running for any office. Why always bring them up? What's next Roosevelt? Why can you not accept the comment I made in reference to the photo?
@DeLoachJW @blondi2261 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Good thing Obama and Clinton aren't running. Lol that being the case, why always  ring them up?  It's silly. Also I'm In Az, the only race I'll have I'm impact on is Sinema vs Mcsally.

@babysgramma @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP What's worse is that my comment or observation about the photo is completely accurate in calling out an Administration that fails at diversity.		Republican voters = diversely made up of Americans of multiple ethnicities and Religious beliefs		Republican leadership = old white men
@babysgramma @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Strange comment, considering the photo is of Trump and the GOP celebrating the passing of the Tax and Jobs Act.  Are you implying that you cant grasp context? Lol

@CharlesPritt233 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP So whenever I see a photo, you're saying to not point out the obvious at least if it concerns race right?
@qanonsentme @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP And if you really read my comment, it was in fact pointing out the lack of color. Hard to see color if it's not there right? Lmao
@jamiefhoran @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Guess you missed the bit about the power divide?  Also, I believe there was a lol within my comment, so it's not exactly Shakespearean right?
@gabaldon_a @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP How exactly is this using the race card? Please elaborate.
@TheoWind72 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Lmao I tried to get on the ballot for the Az Senate race but fell short of the required signatures needed. Just because YOU dont see what I'm doing at any given moment, dont think you can assume I'm not involved. Lol
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I do find it amusing that several comments in this thread somehow make me out to be a racist, when I've not stated anything hateful or racist.
@forreal_jason @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP If this is your takeaway from my comment about a lack of diversity within a photo from over a year ago, depicting an administration that has since only become somehow less diverse than a year ago then I cant help you.
@meir_waks @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Snow flex? If you have nothing if value to add to the comments then maybe sit this one out. Go flex in some snow. Lmao
@germadelphia @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Good then tell @realDonaldTrump to stop hiring corrupt scumbags to serve in his cabinet. Also stop trying to convince me of where the @GOP GOP stands when it comes to diversity within the administration. We both know the truth of the situation.
@Mandy71244981 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Not like voter suppression and gerrymandering isn't color based right?
@Mandy71244981 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Plenty of people of color trying to vote in GA dealing with voter suppression, also in North Dakota,  Natives dealing with voter suppression.  Who knows, some of them might actually support Republicans, but we may never know right? Gotta love the @GOP's suppression tactics.
@sarabro69503483 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Actually I probably would have said something to the effect of "wow one black face in a sea of old white men, this group is so representative of the lack diversity within the @GOP, what a great example of the division of power. Lmao

@workinman462 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Think about it, the GOP controlled the House, Senate and took the Judiciary, if they used the same focus they might have been able to eliminate entitlements, pass immigration reform and get that wall. But group think led them to tax cuts and court appointments
@workinman462 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Party leadership consisting primarily of old rich white men is not reflective of the diversity found in Republican voters. I would say it does matter, group think can stall progress and hinder new ideas to the detriment of the country.
