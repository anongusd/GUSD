By developing a cooperation network between numerous attorney generals around the investigation will act as the pre-emption against the possible big business capture of the political space which could potentially render democracy useless. New era, new rules.
Interestingly this has nothing to do with the US politics or the Mueller probe and most likely to investigate malpractices among the rest. The focus is likely to be on big business wheeling &amp; dealings and not on politicians. It is likely to be based in Europe or Australia.
Beauty of this idea is that it will be totally in the public eye. The idea is benefit from the desperation in the relevant circles caused by the necessary optics and atmospherics. More desperation will simply lead to the creation of more evidence. You will forget past scandals.
The groundwork for this mega investigation is already complete as such cases are under investigation in various countries. The idea is to forge an alliance and inquire into operations of this nexus to defend the integrity of democracy and regulatory frameworks. Not if but when.
Apparently, by the mid of this year, we are likely to witness the start of the world's largest investigation at the historically unprecedented scale into the nexus between corrupt politicians, predatory big business, underworld, various intel services,, tech and opinion leaders.

Pakistan is honor bound to keep him safe and sound. But under no obligation to return him before hostilities are officially over. Which means before any thaw in relationship.
A bit surprised by what Indian media is reporting. India says Pakistan should immediately return the captured pilot. In which world that can be done without diplomatic engagement. He is a combatant who was captured on Pakistani soil. India can win him back only thru diplomacy.

I don't see how such strong, forceful case built by Pakistan can be dismissed. If it is I will lose faith in international justice as I am already losing faith in international media which is censoring such an important proceeding. Shameful censorship.
@ImranSaeedKhan1 Even in time of election law of diminishing returns applies. You can escalate, which may lead to full war risking own domain or backtrack after full-blown war hysteria which would harm election prospects further. Better de-escalate quickly when there still is time to shift focus.
@ImranSaeedKhan1 Yeah but that's the issue. They should watch Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson's Anger Management. Should learn to differentiate between useful &amp; useless anger. If nations are to remain rational actors very few options remain on the table. War hysteria doesn't help any of them.

@TheDoc896 But it is. Thanks to Modi's Kashmir policy. No flexibility there. Created more red lines rather than abolishing them. Frankly there is no appetite for any more bloodshed in Pakistan for any part of the world. Our generation has seen more than it's due share of bloodshed.
@TheDoc896 So process of de-radicalizing is on its way. Will take its time but we will get there. Finally I agree that we have to talk. Consider the stupidity of the situation that India has issue with Pakistan &amp; it is talking to every nation in the world except...wait for it.. Pakistan.
@TheDoc896 As for the man you mentioned he's a national. We can disagree with people but can't make them disappear. As for dismantling radicalism one has to do it in a manner that it doesn't create more radicals. That was the fundamental flaw in Gen Musharraf's strategy which cause blowback
@TheDoc896 Second is the existence of people who have militant past or have a militant ideology. Of course we have had that problem for long. That is why we lost over 80 thousand souls to acts of terrorism. But there is no link between the two. And the latter problem is being taken care of.
@TheDoc896 Journalism is just my profession. I am an ordinary man. Yes exposure to policy makers is part of the job description. So I have some insight. May I point out that you are confusing two important nuances. One, it's state's resolute decision to not support militancy of any kind.
@TheDoc896 Your view is based on a hypothesis, right? I am sharing what I know. No material support. Diplomatic and moral yes, political maybe but no material support.
Worst form of intellectual degeneracy is the total collapse of emotional intelligence. When one forgets that the world is watching &amp; ends up making a fool of oneself in hate, anger &amp; obscenity. Painful to watch Indian TV media going through this patch. Closely followed by papers.

@imNirajkushwaha @Qamarcheema But then the precept was reinforced that states have rationality. It is important to remember this.
@imNirajkushwaha @Qamarcheema States are supposed to be rational actors. And I think you're going thru what I went through on day India claimed it carried out surgical strike. A war looked inevitable. 1st time ever I looked at my daughters &amp; asked myself if bringing them into this world was correct decision.
@imNirajkushwaha @Qamarcheema I haven't seen one on their website. Share the link. And I see the complicated situation in India. But what I am saying is it isn't going to help Modi in the election. So basically he can waste his and our time or focus on trying to win.
@imNirajkushwaha @Qamarcheema On Hafiz Saeed let's be frank. What can be done about him? I mean no implicating evidence provided to the courts by India. Can't just kill a man on whims of another nation. All one can do is to restrict his movement &amp; ensure he doesn't have access to any violent means. So done.
@TheDoc896 No physical or financial support to them anymore. I am not saying that we have been angels in the past. But I know where we are at right now. And had India done something to mollify Kashmiris the indigenous hate would have gone down a few notches. Modi has no clue.
@Qamarcheema This is not new. Remember when Clinton was coming to South Asia, an attack took place on Sikhs and foreigners in Kashmir. Later we learned it had nothing to do with Pakistan. So basically the same playbook.
Kabhi shutdown, kabhi emergency.

@PakPakiPakistan And if Modi govt thinks such tactics and Pakistan bashing may help it win the election it is taking an awfully big risk. Can backfire royally.
@PakPakiPakistan I don't think so. One he has very thick skin. Remember for a long time he supported India's cause in Kashmir when New Delhi was not particularly very popular there. Also the mood in India is shifting before the approaching election. An anti-Modi pre-electoral alliance is forming.

Investor needs data, appeal to imagination and some tangible spadework. If you want to pull a country out of economic entropy it all hands on the deck are needed. Can't leave it all to just the man at the top who is obviously killing himself trying to fix things.
Board of Investment needs to develop elaborate plans, crunch numbers, synergize with finance, law ministries &amp; provincial governments. Publish reports, develop presentations for distribution at such fora. Work out rates, profit margins, tax breaks &amp; ways to fit into supply chains
Been saying this for a long time. Need designated technology hubs in the country. Where is its silicon valley. Where are technology incubators. What is the patent policy. All these things matter. Technology investment is fastest route to human development &amp; poverty alleviation.
Get projections, use them on international fora because these are ideal opportunities we get. Also not just hardware. We all use software. Apps. Cloud. What's the consumer potential. How it can simultaneously uplift consumption, human resource development &amp; output. Use numbers.
Here is what I mean when I say technology investment plan. Pakistan can simultaneously be projected as manufacturing hub and a market. How many Pakistanis use imported cellphones, laptops, other devices. There must be data on consumer side. Then tabulate how labor can be useful.

@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Let's face it. India is not secular. It can call itself one. But that won't make it. It can be if u strive to. But as you are not convinced of efficacy of an 80 percent Hindu country electing a Muslim, Christian or Buddhist as PM not too optimistic. As they say gai bhains pani me
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Thank you for making my point for me. So is India an 80 percent Hindu country or a Hindu one? Make your mind. But just so that you know in a secular country, at least in theory, religion is not a demoninator. So any capable man belonging to any community could be PM. Not in India
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan You mean comparing with Pakistan? When did I say Pakistan is a secular country.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Here is a list of all your PMs. Pick one.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan All window dressing. Good for the image. Amount to nothing.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan How many Muslim PMs did you have? Or Christian? Or Buddhist? Or Jewish? Or Zoroastrian?
@amjkuwait I don't agree with most of her worldview. I have my own. But I admire her grit. Pretty impressive.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Presidents don't have power. Only thing you can brag about a Sikh PM. And look what your country did to him. How many other PMs from religious minorities did you have? In parliamentary democracies only PM's post is truly empowered one.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan RSS is basically a fundamentalist organization which is deeply entrenched. I know many people don't. But if it controls your state and your state controls you, it doesn't amount to a secular state. Does it?
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Okay now you need to read history of reformation as well. And the genesis of Church of England.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan What civilization? There is only one civilization. Human civilization. Rest are labels. Also India that you talk about is mere fiction, only existed as a unity as a result of invasions. Minus invaders there's no Indian 'civilization'. Also nations don't divide civilization.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Pray how do you explain Modi/RSS ascendency. It is religion everywhere. You take extraordinary pains to portray your country as secular but is it really? Just in name now. Even secular Congress' leader had to visit temples to prove he is man of the people.
@imNirajkushwaha @MuqarrubAKhan Buddy kindly read up on Two Nation Theory. I was merely objecting to your theory shattered in 1971 bit. Not true. Actually on the contrary if you want to see painful operationalization of it read my following column: https://t.co/Timqt5lP3R

@MuqarrubAKhan Doesn't hurt that he protest on DNC being compromised during 2016 was eventually vindicated. She can be a good candidate if this penitent bit continues.
@MuqarrubAKhan I have said it before that I think by 2020 RSS/Modi will not be a factor. It is identity politics 101. But now she doesn't need it. She rejected KKK/David Duke's support. YPG is not an issue, Assad was. But water under the bridge. Most controversial was gay conversion therapy bit
@MuqarrubAKhan Media is not treating her very well. But doesn't mean she isn't a good candidate. Especially a penitent Gabbard can be gold, whose glimmers we have witnessed recently. A vet, native American, from a minority faith. She has a lot going for her.

Don't know about others I watched over 70 minutes of #SOTU address and liked most of it. Comes down to individual predilections I guess.
@Wattoo045 No you don't have the accurate numbers. Also armies don't produce certain elements in the society, nations do. Which include complacent politicians. When are you going to hold civilian politicians accountable for their complacency when you are constantly talking about army.
@Wattoo045 Well, I can live with your doubts. I can only say what happened. As for your claim about spokesman ask PMO about what PM said about resignation. Also may I say you cannot deflect from the fact that you are asking people to focus on select parts of a verdict that you havent read
@Wattoo045 No. I don't betray confidences. But have you read the entire verdict?
@Wattoo045 Problem is we can celebrate whatever we like against the army but truth is we have lost count of how many have died to save our sorry asses. Political agendas can be legitimate. But only fools forget who is protecting them.
@Wattoo045 It was reported that his resignation letter reached the CM office. A couple of journalists from Lahore who claim to be in the know confirmed it. I am going with that. As for the verdict may I ask have you read the entire text.
Kia baat hai hamaray un Twitterati doston ki jo TLP ko nahi apni sipah ko ziada bara challenge samajhtay hain! Yani asal qisa hi gul.
@Wattoo045 @abbasnasir59 And what you are missing is that while media can pick and choose this judgment is primarily about TLP not state institutions. And state institutions including Army and judiciary were targetted by TLP. If you note that you realize there is wrong spin in media so far.
@Wattoo045 @abbasnasir59 You are mistaking time we are taking in commenting on the judgment as some kind of censorship. It is not. Many of us are busy reading the judgment. Others will soon.

@abbasnasir59 I understand that. I think PTI is learning that things are easier said than done the hard way. But now the issue is it is in govt. We all have stakes in its success and failure whether we see it or not. We can compare this decision with JKT or we can with more recent SS re PAC.
@abbasnasir59 Court could disqualify JKT from holding public offices not from being a free citizen sir. His presence anywhere can technically be considered freedom of movement of a consenting adult :). As for now he holds no public or party office. Aleem Khan did. I think it's a learning curve

There are serious problems with the current administration but an immigration package that gives Trump some semblance of a win on the wall &amp; yet also resolves deeper humanitarian issues like DACA can really help restore the credibility of Congress. Needed a bilateral solution.
I also understand the concern about immigration being used to spread xenophobia. The child separation policy is a hideous scar on our collective conscience. But will a barrier not also put a stop to that too? In other words, a border wall may bring down this xenophobic hysteria.
There's something really Lilliputian about the wall debate. I understand people who say it will not resolve the border issue or that it is not as dire an issue but frankly what's the point of this rather intense pushback. Countries need to control borders. Barriers are important.

I say it not out of interest in or support of the wall but because politics is a lethal weapon and can harm the legacies of great heroes too. America needs Martin Luther King more than it needs a wall or a partisan debate about a wall. Actually the world needs him.

PM is a well-intentioned leader. All other leadership options starting from existing options from the opposition leader to Johnson can create further chaos. She deserves to stay but not as a weak PM. A referendum can fix all that. So advice by Dr Haass is absolutely on the money.
And if for some reason British people have changed their minds on leaving EU, it will be morally reprehensible to go ahead with Brexit. So even in this case, the sanest choice after yesterday's debacle is to consult the people again.
The job of a leader is to see what is not working &amp; fix it. It is plain that PM May's support in parliament continues to weaken because of the Brexit plan issue.

We haven't seen the numbers yet but by common sense standards this round goes to Democrats. Bottom line: people fulfilling their duties, ie federal workers, should not be used as leverage. Also building a barrier may address entry of illegal aliens but not 'humanitarian crisis'.

They all are now looking at the unintended consequences of Trump's victory and scratching their heads.
Netanyahu had already shown his aversion to Democratic rule by bypassing Obama and addressing joint session of Congress. The allies of Indian ruling party in the far right were literally worshipping Donald Trump. Arabs, others were all concerned about Hillary's foreign policy.
They all had better means to do that. That's why Trump's foreign policy is so complicated. Its like playing twister. It might not be wrong that entire village tried to meddle in elections. NY's FBI also helped. Russia's influence thru far right groups was by far most significant. https://t.co/mJqEWR0Yr8
Might I add a bit more? Think that foreign aversion to Hillary, since her State days was so strong that everyone had a stake in her defeat.

As they say talk is cheap. Acting is not. Proliferation of news channels occurred because entertainment industry had collapsed. Now it is coming back to life. Its leading lights should double down creating an aura of stardom instead of making a temporary thing permanent.
That is why there are so many talk shows. Get a set, few cameras, make them talk and boom you make profits. But when actors/stars make themselves available to host some they are doing a disservice to themselves &amp; their industry. We need big stars, making a lot of money acting.
Might I suggest something? I think successful Lollywood (I wish we had a better name for the industry) stars should avoid anchoring talk shows at all cost. Unless it is a telethon for a national cause. Reason? Talk shows are cheapest things to make. Hardly costs a serious dime.

One thing about Erik Prince. His baggage is far bigger than Trump's. There is no reason for POTUS to own that baggage. This lot is only trouble. And does not go off the table. Own it and its your baggage.
Don't know why they didn't airbrush the spot on his nose. Very distracting.

Those who suffer from schizophrenia, bipolar syndrome et al need our utmost empathy because an overwhelming majority of them is of nice people struggling with the impossible. Their suffering is nothing to trifle about. Empathy &amp; respect and no more ill conceived metaphors please.

India and Pakistan should come to terms with their colonial legacy and then ensure that their sacrifices during the first and second world wars are properly acknowledged and celebrated.

People love their national identity. Even where they have to graduate to a multinational identities like the EU you cannot ask them to give up their love for their nation-state. You can encourage them to love both simultaneously until the latter naturally supplants the former.
You can create a nation in the name of faith or race but if it has to progress &amp; evolve with time its constituents keep changing. The reality soon becomes multireligious and multiracial. So confusing nationalism with racism or fanaticism is unimaginative.

Here is a reason why Dems should be wary &amp; a proof that Trump is a media genius. They won house which is no mean feat &amp; are killing it with savvy sound bites. But one credentials issue &amp; one AG firing later camera is back on Trump &amp; Dems' achievement is kinda forgotten.
My thoughts exactly https://t.co/KHQdB5odEF
Shouldn't this day be about Democrats celebrating their victories and charting a course forward rather than a reporter's credentials or Sessions' exit which we knew would happen in any case?
Administration after administration has done this without this kind of dramatic outcry. While presence of characters like Miller is still a concern, and media will not tell you Sessions is Miller's mentor, I can't understand the outrage.
Trump's presser was neither wild nor combative. From Acosta's constant bickering to the doofus who asked Trump why he liked Oprah, as if that was a bad thing, media's performance wasn't anything to be proud of. As for pulling credentials youl'll notice WH is within it's rights.

@MuqarrubAKhan Not really. And it was a fine presser. Media's desire to look combative gets the best of it. Make spectacle of itself.
@MuqarrubAKhan No, there were reports before the midterm that after he'll be asked to step down. The speed with which his resignation was accepted is a proof. Trump said he won't fire Mueller so he won't. Session's is because of he recused himself from investigation. Trump hated it.
@MuqarrubAKhan I don't see a serious challenger.
Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer together make an interesting dynamic. Add John King and you can see electricity flowing.
@MuqarrubAKhan And to the points you raised let me remind you when Dems lost house. They did when they made life difficult for a very popular Democratic President on Yemen in 2013. They finally have been given another chance. They shouldn't blow it with a very popular Republican President.
Whoa! https://t.co/Ggztmh2YBq
@MuqarrubAKhan BTW I am watching recording of Trump press talk. And to tell you it is embarrassing that the media is calling his performance combative. 40 minutes into the presser &amp; I think media made a spectacle of itself. Campaign tactics are not supposed to be discussed after results.
@MuqarrubAKhan Not really. People get tired of the faces they have seen for a long time. Some of her most ferocious critics are democratic. But I have a different view. Change is important but not at the cost of competence, skill or expertise. She is very very very competent.
No idea why so many people criticize Nancy Pelosi so ferociously. She is making perfect sense right now. Personally I just want to look at their faces when they call her Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

And given the many layered polarization in the society if anyone takes a perverse pleasure in what was said they should ask any serious expert on terrorism what Gen Qamar Bajwa alone has done for the country. The answer may help bring them back to their senses.
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi It is. And we have done so more than once. Let's hope this time the state uses gained time to come up with an enduring solution.
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi The only assurance the govt has given is that it will not contest the right of the petitioner to argue a review case. In my view a reversal of judgment is highly unlikely. That's that.
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi No one is reversing the SC verdict. Executive cannot giveaway that kind of assurances. Law provides for review petition. That in any case has to be entertained. But it concerns only technical flaws which in this high profile case are highly unlikely.
@aazarayaz @murtazasolangi Of course not. But we can debate that when we have an apology. Right now we haven't got that either.
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi So my instinct says that given that army is such a disciplined force the bigger issue is narrative. You can do with the rest whatever pleases you. But as someone who works on narrative building on daily basis my lookout is reversal of what was said. Cant happen without  penitence
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi My argument back then was that though there are too many capable ones to replace him a state doesn't just throw away an important commodity like Gen Raheel's popularity which is a useful weapon against incursions. But our teenage impulses always win over. (cont)
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi State must do whatever the law dictates. But I can only share my views there. I don't take pleasure in the fact that my publicly expressed fears are time &amp; again proven right. I was among the tiny minority which was ridiculed when I said Gen Raheel should be given extension(cont)
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi Look, I understand the state's compulsions too. But my only concern here is that something similar happened when Gen Raheel's successor was being chosen. A maulvi started a propaganda that was not taken down and this lot has now weaponized it. (continues).
@AzharMKhan3 @murtazasolangi 1) there is a difference between treason &amp; high treason. 2) anything is better than what we saw. 3) helps to dismantle the narrative weaponizing faith against state.
@zed_q72 @murtazasolangi Is it a rhetorical question or you are asking for my personal opinion? In case it's latter one there is treason &amp; there is high treason. My views on both are in the public sphere. You can look up. I believe in dismantling narratives. A public apology with names accomplishes that.

@OrobaTasnim You mean history of political philosophy or are you asking which philosophers I like? Asking because so far I have managed to defy tying down to one or two names.
@OrobaTasnim @NasimZehra @MehrTarar The first one I have missed. The rest I have gone thru. Is it available in digital copy? Wolpert used to be my favorite back in college days. Not anymore.
@OrobaTasnim I can but where is the space. I have made it a habit to go thru as many books as I can. While list gets very long not everyone of them is worth a mention. And thanks for the titles. I've been read them all. Acemoglu and Robinson's book is one of my favorites of the decade so far.

@MuqarrubAKhan You are too kind.
@OrobaTasnim Somebody recommended this before. My reaction was well another book on the relationship. But now that you have also recommended endorsements are increasing quickly. So I think I will have to take a look. Thanks.
@MuqarrubAKhan I have given ten names. Let me know when you need more.
@MuqarrubAKhan Won't say geniuses. I meant peculiar quirkiness. :)
@MuqarrubAKhan 7) Rise and Kill First by Ronen Bergman, 8) Mr. Trump's Wild Ride by Major Garrett (easily the best book on Trump's White House), 9) Michael Wolff's Fire &amp; Fury (for the vivid language to describe Trump), 10) Gen Hayden's Assault on intelligence, 11) Ben Rhodes' World as it is.
@MuqarrubAKhan 1) A World in Disarray by Richard Haass, 2) if you haven't Kissinger's World Order, 3) Francis Fukuyama's Identity, 4) Facts and Fears by James Clapper, 5) Fukuyama's twin books origins of political order + political order &amp; decay. 6) Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright.
@MuqarrubAKhan Well, one clarification before I start listing names. My columns are 95-99 percent me. I have a peculiar worldview which has been shaped over time. So that's that. But in next two tweets I will try to cover some must read books.
@Mizna_R Thanks. I will.
@MuqarrubAKhan Hey I am not a teacher. I only have friends here. Will be more than willing to recommend names. You'll have to narrow your query though. There are way too many books being written on world politics and Trump. What are you looking for?
And even that is premature even so young man's name came up more than once. Do keep in mind while MBS is seen as impulsive &amp; brash by the world he is very very popular with the country's young population. Especially because they think such a personality makes him immune to clergy https://t.co/TXJZcfgtgc
Media speculation has begun in the west after return of Ahmed bin Abdulaziz to the kingdom. Frankly I don't see him as the potential crown prince. If they were to replace the crown prince they would do it with another son of King Salman. Most likely KBS, ambassador to US.
And those of you I am following can always DM me. I don't have anything against anyone recommending own book either.
Just realized I am done with my weekend reading list. So any book recommendation is most welcome. 2 caveats. I judge a book by it readability &amp; sincerity. Plus point is how current it is. I dont worry about genre as long as you arent recommending floral patterns or knitting books

@imNirajkushwaha Don't worry about that. China is smarter in its flexibility than more are. Pay more attention to its history.
@imNirajkushwaha Pakistan didn't approach IMF in July. It did very recently.
@imNirajkushwaha Also if you forgive I am in the middle of some heavy lifting. Will continue this chat another time. Regards
@imNirajkushwaha Any government which can disregard over 80 percent of its legal tender arbitrarily just to meet populist expectations of do more surgical strikes cannot be trusted. Only good idea was GST. But thanks to your bureaucracy that was lost too. Rest is window dressing.
@imNirajkushwaha Not really mate. Your government is buying foreign policy through defence procurements. Means more spending. And thanks to Rafale the pretense of transparency is gone too. As for his economic success well demonetization did it for me. More on it in next tweet.
@imNirajkushwaha The issue was not CPEC. The markup doesn't start till 2022. And some basic info will be shared. Issue of trust arose with the sudden departure of IMF's chief economist &amp; replacement with lady of Indian origin whose husband is a former IAS officer. Your designs are as big as any.
@imNirajkushwaha It does but only just. And thanks to Modi sarkar's lack of understanding of economic affairs those resources are also depleting rapidly.
@imNirajkushwaha And might I ask if China is trying to overcompensate for Opium wars humiliation as per your own account is your country similarly motivated by own colonial &amp; history of invasions? Come on. We are better than this.
@imNirajkushwaha BRI is a perfectly fine concept. World will love someone to build their infrastructure for them. It is lack of experience that could bring the projects down. Your govt's resistance is not helping the situation. Incidentally how many countries has China invaded in its history?
@imNirajkushwaha 36 percent. Read your own tweet :)
@imNirajkushwaha That's true. Although your constitution's preamble still mentions socialism. But that's not the point. What Modi govt is trying to do is make it Hindutva Populist state. Issue isnt of ideology here (socialism or Hindutva) it is of coercion &amp; fear. That usually brings nations down
@imNirajkushwaha Another myth. China is not a revisionist power. In this case you are. Remember Tibet and all. China views the world through an economic lens not a political one. It is your &amp; my country's obsession with politics that drags it into this sphere.
@imNirajkushwaha Ask yourself this, why does a country like India which has given us economic geniuses like Dr Manmohan Singh, Amartya Seen &amp; Raghuram Rajan has a 'generalist' as a finance minister with only bureaucrats helping him? That's how declines begins. And given ur size it's a big one.
@imNirajkushwaha On top of it you have a govt given to a demonetization like whimsy. I am not hoping that India go down USSR path. Far from it. But remember quality of leadership matters. Thanks to your current leadership the economy is like a dead man walking.
@imNirajkushwaha Err India did not. It prolonged it. Most of NPA is based on borrowed foreign money. When plenty of FDI is available in the market it is okay but it has found new avenues in the US. Also trade war between US China mean liquidity will shrink. So these NPAs will explode like a nuke.
@imNirajkushwaha Its not a wishful thinking on my part. On the contrary. I believe a mammoth like India has effect on everyone. If ur economy declines it may bring world economy down with it. So it is in everyone's interest that India 1st focuses on such matters. Arm races, procurements can wait
@imNirajkushwaha Not concerned about arms race brother. I am looking at the health of international system &amp; India's role in it. It all comes down to wrong priorities. There is concern that your economic marvel is losing it's luster. Non performing assets between 9 &amp; 12 lakh crore. Fix it first.

And in case of Faizabad when things were out of control, state machinery managed the crisis thru dialogue. Then it was accused of collusion. Get this point. You just can't have your cake and eat it too. And I know most of it is lack of emotional education than anything else.
It isn't merely about Faizabad. Remember how entire media, or most media influentials, were demanding action against Lal Masjid. But within hours of operation demand was replaced by portrayal of victimhood. Happened just that in Faizabad. Both times totally abandoned the state.
Some of us will obviously see some conspiracy in his rise. But if you add two &amp; two, you can his spontaneous rise is pretty organic in nature. Instead of conspiracy theories we need to trust &amp; empower the state so that when he marches on Islamabad the govt &amp; state are prepared.
I don't understand the chain sharing of Khadim Rizvi's videos. First you are giving him platform. Negative advertising too is advertising after all. Second, what part of his prominence don't you get? Third, demanding action won't cut it. Same approach emboldened him Faizabad.

Not just conservative media establishment my man. Liberal media too. That's how you enhance a country's soft power. And bring down polarization that damages the core of your smart power.

RT @thehill: JUST IN: Trump says Republicans working on "major tax cut for middle-income people" https://t.co/OWbW1lcLWR https://t.co/yo1g1…
Finally it builds confidence elsewhere that world is not leaderless and that core principles are not abandoned. Simultaneously the kingdom can be asked to introduced checks and balance to ensure that there is no replay &amp; that impulsiveness &amp; genuine concerns don't mingle. Ends.
This has several advantages. One the kingdom knows actions have consequences. Two, it builds trust between media and the administration on foreign policy. Three, it helps the administration in explaining its compulsions to the media without the fear of being directly quoted.
While the administration publicly resumes work with Saudis after some justice is done in the case, mid-ranking officials in the administration and in the intel community should be allowed to leak to the press further steps taken to ensure there's no replay of Khashoggi incident.
Meanwhile, the media and the administration's antithetical approaches may end up undermining either one or both and America's influence abroad. This can easily be remedied.
That brings us to our next challenge. Diplomatic pressure mean that no public announcement, nor even Trump's unpredictable Twitter handle can divulge information of tough love without undermining own efforts to work with the Kingdom or restrain it from further brinkmanship.
The story shouldn't end at the alibi. America needs to be seen as doing enough that hotheadedness of prince does not cause more embarrassing situations &amp; while it must cooperate for now it is not abandoning its principles. Trump has called his approach principled realism at UN.
This will neither help America's cause of ensuring a rule based system, nor administration's self image or America's ability to bailout  allies or foreign investors which seems to be kingdom new status in the future. More needs to be done which presents the US with an opportunity
What happens next is crucial. The nature of alibi is such (&amp; I have my own issues with it) that broader consensus stays with the media's cynicism, not the administration's realism. And that's where media's reporting becomes a critique of Trump administration rather than a prince.
As America moves to reluctantly accept the Saudi alibi and media calls it a cover-up you will recall I did predict a few days back that this is how things would shape up. And will. America's cooperation &amp; media's defiance are both known knowns.

Finally all these highs do not absolve MBS of moral dimensions of this gruesome murder. His head needs to cool off &amp; that can happen thru a shock. He needs to know actions have consequences. And in a way he is already learning that. Western media will not cut him slack any longer
Doesn't mean he isn't an impulsive authoritarian. He is. One who needs watching. Only that Friedman was on the money to identify trends that could potentially transform Muslim world not just Saudi Arabia. In case you haven't noticed IS is hardly an issue in most parts anymore.

You need pressure for that. But you also need contact. Lose contact, practically ostracize and you get one Yemen after the other, one Khashoggi after another. Remember there is too much power &amp; wealth here and the old fanatic guard is waiting to be brought back. Shouldn't combine
So the best way to go is to bring back layers of checks &amp; balances. Only concern is you can't bring back old elite. The ideal solution is to force real multilayered Democratic reforms with real institutions.
The kingdom has too much power &amp; leverage. And then it has too many sidekicks like UAE &amp; GCC which wield remarkable power. House of Saud had devised a set of checks &amp; balances which kept individuals in control. With MBS ascendency everything went flat. And he is early thirties.
This despite the fact that I firmly disapprove of Khashoggi's murder, Yemen humanitarian debacle &amp; inherent intolerance &amp; stupidity of it all. In long run west will have to convince the kingdom to develop institutions, so that no ruler or heir apparent can have this much power.
Doesn't mean Khashoggi was a fanatic. He was a cultured man. But he was also close to previous ruling elite. You don't go from heading an establishment mouthpiece media org into exile for no reason. MBS needs restraints. But the point is it is tribalism not fanaticism.
Connecting Khashoggi with MBS obviously works. What doesn't work is connecting him to 9/11 which was perpetrated by religious fanatics almost kosher to former Intel chief princes close to Khashoggi. While MBS shows a lot of immaturity he's busy shutting that fanatic factory down.

It is sh*tload of money. No country will risk losing it. Too bad this much leverage was wasted on tackling something so horribly stupid.
BTW I get the president's $110 billion argument. Not a very moral argument I grant you. But this administration has officially identified its foreign policy with the realist of school of thought. Trump called it 'principled realism' in his UNGA speech. So this one will slide.
@Aslam_44 Nah. Not that strange. World has known another Khashoggi before. Was quite notorious.
Very serious damage done to the prince's image in the west who was reluctantly accepted as a reformer albeit with many quirks. Now media will look for signs of temper tantrums &amp; anger issues. Not many will comprehend it's symptomatic of tribal psyche. No more room for mistakes.
Important: Saudis show they are putting an effort to come up with a prudent alibi. Also that there is sense of penitence. Time is of essence.	Dilemma: Media will continue to believe &amp; state that alibi was make believe. 	Consequence: Less margin of error for the prince for future.
Personal opinion: Hard to believe that with so much wealth, resources &amp; power crown prince wouldn't know how many bees were buzzing around in consulate at any given time.	Realist view: This has to end &amp; whatever alibi given will have to be accepted on face value. Too much on line
Don't know why Western mediamen are having problem in pronouncing name of Khashoggi. It is pronounced very much like Khashogi. Take 'Kha' of Khaled and 'Shog' from Shogun, add an i. That's it.

@AAshfaq101 More delay you mean? Or are you trying to renegotiate the past?
So while it was a bit late, it wasn't too late. The relative inexperience of the govt notwithstanding, let us remember it hasnt spent even two months in power. Let's show some patience.
We have seen some jitters recently. It is plain that for a very short while things will look spooky, what with dramatic rise in the value of dollar and all. But as you conclude a deal this will begin to subside. Once you get letter of comfort you can explore other instruments too
But that wasn't  finance minister's real test. The actual test comes now. To negotiate the terms that do not crush the common man on the street &amp; yet does discipline the economy. I believe he can achieve that easily. If he does we are looking at only a small detour not a long one
Only fault one can find in the govt's strategy is that it took too long to opt for IMF. Had it decided it earlier foreign currency reserves &amp; market would've been in better state. But no lasting damage is done. Even w/out IMF's conditionalities it had shown resolve to reform.
Answer can be found in govt's own platform. It is not easy to distance oneself from the disdain one has publicly shown to the idea of borrowing. Govt first had to try other options. It did but to no avail. However it didn't need to. It could easily say it did not make this mess.
If you recall the caretaker govt even considered approaching IMF even during its own tenure but thought the better of it. So the point is it was clear by the inauguration that it was the only immediate real option available. Why did the govt delay then? Was it wise to delay it?
A few observations on government's decision to seek an IMF bailout. As I have said it before it was the right call to make. Important point to remember is it was also the assessment of the caretaker govt that the new government will eventually have to go to the fund.

If confirmation was stalled til midterms &amp;Dems had managed to flip the Senate, you would have to make do with a lib-con stalemate at least for two years effectively making highest court ineffective on partisan issues. This concern is bigger than anger against Kavanaugh or Trump.
Having seen the reaction to Kavanaugh confirmation I really struggle to find an example where a nation has come back from such polarization. But credit where credit is due. By getting a conservative judge confirmed Trump has saved Supreme Court from perpetual 4-4 dead heat.

This reads like a one sided charge sheet. Zero credence given to Dr Ford's statements. It is like she sat through the hearing to find fault with the alleged victim's testimony. Some parts might be true but this is not what I know as a neutral arbitrator. Won't affect the outcome. https://t.co/Np7piryria

@DrOsamaSiddique No they were great ideas. Problem is we don't beta test them before implementing. And there is limited effort to sell them to key stakeholders like bureaucracy. One example: devolution. 2nd: 18th amendment &amp; scrapping of concurrent list. Ideally great but lack of prep &amp; ownership
@DrOsamaSiddique slightly concerned about what Bannon calls deconstruction of administrative state. Pakistan is no America. It takes seconds to demolish eons to rebuild. Musharraf learnt it the hard way tht toppling applecart has far-reaching effect. But then I've to keep up hope that IK has will

@DrOsamaSiddique I see point they are trying to make in highlighting this. A hundred thousand not a small amount for a man on street. They are trying to frame debate around lavish spending of their predecessors. Whether media had an inkling of what it was about or how to do it is another matter.

It is time to retire Article 6. You cannot leave such lethal weapons lying around when various sides in a polarized are baying for each other's blood. We have already paid a huge price for tolerating intolerance.
For bringing various factions of disgreeing patriots on the same page we need patience and dialogue. To discourage specific cases of mischief we need fine tuned tools not this.
It is my conclusion after witnessing various power struggles that Article 6 is an inappropriate weapon. I said it during Gen Musharraf's trial and will say it again. In a country which clearly has more than one interpretation of patriotism its use is a recipe for disaster.
When you read the constitution of Pakistan you can see that various tugs of war have left deep marks there. Article 62, 63 in current weaponized form left behind by authoritarianism in alliance with the clergy. Similarly Article 6 by equally reactionary zeal of Democrats.

@pragmatistic Now you are wasting my time. Good bye.
@pragmatistic In the end you have to decide whether you hate Pakistan more than you love your own future generation. If you sow hate you will harvest it. Pakistan learned it the hard way. We have been paying price for past one &amp; half decade. I can only hope you do learn from other's mistakes.
@pragmatistic Nah, we will do whatever we need to do for ourselves not your sake. This is precisely the arrogance PM was referring to. You think you have arrived. Look again bro. World has a much different trajectory.
@pragmatistic Learn from mistakes and up your game. Since when is bureaucratic red tape an excuse to sabotage an idea that can improve millions of lives. And can save lives. If Modi sarkar is better than the previous ones it should perform better in the regard too.
@pragmatistic Only someone devoid of imagination would think that status quo offers breathing space. It only gives breathing space to the elements of intolerance &amp; hate. I have watched with concern how unresolved disputes have rewritten DNA of Indian &amp; Pakistani society. Not a tenable position
@pragmatistic Reading Kautilya? Your entire strategic vision is shaped by his writings. Or derivatives. If you think Pakistan is incapable of tackling its problems well good luck with the day dreaming. Back in 90s India too was ready to airlift its gold for a bailout. We will manage too.
@pragmatistic On the contrary this is ideal time. Stabilizing, formalizing borders go in favor of both sides. First time in years we have a government in Islamabad which has all elements of power united in its support. Modi is quite powerful too. Still time in elections. Peace will be popular.
@pragmatistic Actually Pakistan doesn't have a full plate. Not fuller than India. One common myth on the both sides of border is that the other side will one day collapse. Not going to happen. That status quo argument is a direct manifestation of Kautilya worldview that you were objecting to.
@pragmatistic Today GDP is growing, tomorrow things might be different. Who knows? Same goes for soft power. Right now you have it, tomorrow circumstances might conspire against you. In bad times old unresolved hostilities exacerbate suffering. Resolve now &amp; who knows you may get 1 more friend
@pragmatistic Look I will take skepticism on anything I say any given day for the sake of dialogue. I get your point on status quo &amp; GDP growth. But here is the thing. Time changes &amp; circumstances change. Stability &amp; conflict resolution provide best framework for sustainable GDP growth.

Here is a word of wisdom for the dominant strategic mindset in India. Take it or leave it. Kautilya died in 283 BC. This is 21st century. Stop taking dictates from ghosts of people who died over two millennia ago. You are better than this.
As a student of politics &amp; history I have often wondered what would have happened if India &amp; Pakistan had settled their borders before Sino-Pak border settlement. Could we be close allies? Sadly Modi government has made abundantly clear such a development could never take place.
For me this episode has been instructive. Nations are not poor when they don't have money. They are poor when they have no imagination. India might be a powerhouse of ideas but sadly that creativity &amp; imagination doesn't seem to have even touched its current ruling elite. Shame.
All Pakistanis are with their Prime Minister on the Indian outreach &amp; the Indian reaction. Considering the maddening atmospherics characteristic of South Asian politics it was a valiant effort to build peace. The other side has only displayed poverty of imagination. Their loss.

@myraemacdonald Was listening to Bannon &amp; he claimed Nazism was elitist &amp; that European far right movements are grassroot phenomenon. Hence no threat there. But the fool doesn't realize elitist or not attacks on European Jewish communities are back. Its poison that matters not who administers it
@myraemacdonald The issue is not control. The issue is our ignorance. The poverty of our knowledge is heartbreaking. We record history but our understanding of it all remains negligible. Take the example of neo-Nazis persecuting Jewish people. Millions died &amp; the same poison is back.
@myraemacdonald This is precisely my point. Between 1914 and 1939 world suddenly saw emergence of strange new ideologies. Their true origins are still very confusing. I have looked and looked. It is like some mass hysteria grips humanity &amp; world suddenly decides to go mad.

@MuqarrubAKhan I am a bit wary of qualifiers like east or west. All parts of the world deserve peace.
I am among most vociferous critics of Modi govt since day one. But since there is a chance of peace building I am declaring a moratorium. Hoping the unhinged Indian media can do the same. Only stop hurting Kashmir &amp; get serious about peace. Or else stop pretending you care.
Many like me are closely following Mohan Bhagwat's recent overtures towards minorities. It seems even RSS is trying to find a new pitch toward minorities and opposition. So it seems both India &amp; Pakistan have the right atmospherics to build peace. Should stop blame game though.
The world has permanently changed &amp; cold war mentality has to go. Otherwise human civilization will suffer far more than in any war we have seen before. Perhaps I'll have to write a book to make that point. I may make it my project. But right now India can stop acting so insecure
I m critical of current Indian policy of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds because as a student of history India has a greater destiny than it believes in. It can be a different kind of power. That doesn't divide the world, helps unite it. Not realpolitik. Empathy
For past many years we have heard that Indian govt will like to build relationships before next election in India. Well, 2018 is not that far away. India should show us what it has got. Surely churlish behavior can't be it. So waiting to see if its behavior changes.
There is still time in the UNGA visit so never mind the temper tantrums. I m confident India will come round &amp; the talks will happen. It is in their interest too. If they ever wanted to talk to a fully empowered government in Islamabad with all elements on the same page it is now

@saqikhan Of course nothing is set in stone. It is a quest. And an interesting one at that.  I am at a stage where I am entering into reading of original texts and letting go commentaries that we often encounter. If nothing else it is bound to enrich our minds.
@saqikhan Ancient vedics. Umpteen others. Go back to Kabalist texts. Numerous others.
@saqikhan No of humans. Our imaginations ends with Mesopotamia, Egypt, Indus and a few in Africa &amp; Asia. Human mind can work wonders. Less chance it couldn't evolve organizational principles before. Something seems scrubbed from collective memory &amp; you used the right world: A veil is there
@saqikhan Cyclical as in a loop not the old adage that history repeats itself.
@saqikhan We might if we pay attention to ancient texts. It is a growing fad these days among intellectuals. Remember Asimov's Nightfall. Scriptures and scrolls often capture scientific facts. One question that seems to be re-emerging is about the probable cyclical nature of time &amp; history
@saqikhan Could be language, could be catastrophe like Toba super eruption 75k years ago. But the point is probability would indicate rise and fall  of more civilizations than we know of. Even 75k out of 800k or 350k (the new homo-sapiens life estimate) seems insignificant.
@saqikhan You take 800,000 years since man evolved into current shape and take out this 10,000 (or make it 20 since that was when man was collecting &amp; consuming wild grain) and think about two things. Rest of 780,000 years and the progress in past 100 years. You will see what occupies me.
RT @TheEconomist: Milton Friedman once said “the 19th-century liberal was a radical”. Today many liberals are fearful of changing a system…
@saqikhan That would be if history began 5000 to 10000 years ago. It clearly didn't. We are talking about millions of years of evolution culminating into past 20-30 thousand years.
@LordMasood @ZarrarKhuhro Loved Hopkins' delivery. But that period came much earlier. And thousands of years of intervening period are missing from history books. We have to rely on archeology. But still struggling.
@ZarrarKhuhro @Jamie_Woodward_ No I didn't. But thanks to you following now.
@ZarrarKhuhro Mine too.
One remarkable thing about evolution is this collective amnesia beyond 3-4000 years. Mankind had lived for quite a lot longer. Hard to imagine it never achieved progress before or that it can't recollect all of it now. It's like slate was wiped &amp; now brain hurts thinking about it https://t.co/lCdXZYQgW7
In this stage of transition it is fascinating to see how one half of society acts as if it could wish the other half away. Polarization of course. But wasn't it the actual promise of the transition? To bind the wounds of division. So what's keeping everyone from i?

So caution is compulsory. Again doesn't make him guilty until there is proof but what's the harm in thoroughly examining everything out.
Third what happens if in haste borne out of confirmation bias you end up electing him to one of highest, most powerful permanent positions in country without due diligence &amp; it all turns out to be correct. Like what happens if there is any crime not linked with his libido?
2) If it has remained hidden for this long what is the guarantee there is nothing hiding out there. At 17 he is unlikely to have the power or influence he eventually did acquire. So anything after this becomes easier to hide. Doesn't mean he did anything. Only system seems broken
Innocent until proven guilty. Past political positions too mostly do not matter at this stage. But there are three troubling questions in #Kavanaugh case. 1) How did 6 past FBI background checks missed it? You see true or false at least the accuser believes it. Passed polygraph.

To say no such charge surfaced during vetting processes by FBI for his previous positions won't cut it. This is Supreme Court. Biggest league. Conservatives have a heart. If nature of crime isnt too serious as you propose he will eventually get confirmed. Give her a fair hearing.
Don't. https://t.co/OQU9MhBZQl
In their admirable haste the republicans may end up permanently scarring themselves and this close to the election too. Remember nothing of the sort happened before Gorsuch confirmation. Because he did not have skeletons in the closet. This one seems different. Abort.
Feinstein should release the letter if it doesn't jeopardize accuser's safety. But blame game aside if the senate carries out the vote without resolving the issue and if it passes it will permanently indict the sitting members. Not a risk worth taking right now. Postpone.

This entire China is the next enemy and India is the best ally rhetoric needs time to reflect. Don't be played. Work on those principles. Adopt them. And then preach. Once someone doesn't want to cooperate then we will debate this. No cold war for now please.
Instead of demonizing a country a far better option is to first develop a set of universal principles and then try convincing that country of the vitality of such principles. But in this age of information explosion preaching that which you yourself don't do won't cut it.
As centrists aren't you supposed to inform public discourse rather than become a weapon in it? Question is do we need another cold war? In 3 decades since the cold war things have changed. World has bigger challenges than any state. Climate, overpopulation, hate, automation etc.
CNN seems to be weaponizing the narrative against China with a never ending drip drip of daily stories. That is why the reactionary right is so emboldened. Because the left &amp; the centrists allow them to become weapons of war without even thinking twice about the outcome.

@zoro_r7 Those terms are proposed by Pakistan. Not by IMF. It's called homegrown package. We can always tweak the terms. Ishaq Dar was given massive relief by IMF on tax reforms.
People talk about political cost of going to IMF. Well only the one who has never gone to IMF can throw the stone. Also the political cost of doing nothing or other measures like taking back the tax relief from salaried class might have bigger cost politically in real terms
The idea of bringing back Pakistani wealth stashed abroad, funds for dams, selling public land all are admirable ideas. But when seen with the angle of economic challenges facing us today they will take time to yield results. Need immediate cash &amp; IMF the best option.
