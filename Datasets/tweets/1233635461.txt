@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner i’m not disputing those facts. but the parties have both changed in the last half century. https://t.co/3jWuKGZBZI
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner “see i’m trying to engage you and it’s one insult after another”
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner i don’t think there is a “party of racism”. that’s like saying everyone who voted for trump is racist. don’t fall into that divisive trap. there’s nothing productive about that.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner i’m anything but stupid. but IF black people hate me (which i don’t believe they do) then i would understand the basis for it. i come from a town with slave blocks memorialized on street corners. black folks have the blood of generations of oppressed people in their veins.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner whites don’t need to run around saying “white lives matter” because our institutions already work under the assumption that white lives matter. there’s no reason to bring attention to or fight for something that already exists.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner whites are killed by cops, and that’s a disgusting abuse of power as well. however, they are MUCH more likely to face consequences for it than when it’s a black person. hence the word “impunity” in my original tweet.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner that’s a ridiculous statement to make. @KingTJ_89 has yet to say one negative thing about white people.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner they are only protesting black people being killed by cops because that’s the issue at hand. what’s the question?
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner dreamers aren’t illegal. they were given legal status. when i say “protect dreamers”, i mean don’t reverse a policy that exists and works.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner at what point did i say anything about illegal immigrants?
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner you equating “gang violence” with the police killing civilians more than proves the point.
@BiceBiceboyz @KingTJ_89 @chrisgeidner this very real protest was, and continues to be, about black and brown people being murdered by police with impunity.

@7hozho @elonjames what? of course not. that's a non sequitur. i'm talking about your fallible back and forth with @elonjames re: white people need to step up
@7hozho @elonjames 2. you &amp; i cannot possibly fathom the deep historical pain/experience of black people in this country so we shouldn't speak on it or compare
@7hozho @elonjames 1. globally is a different conversation. in this country, white women are doing just fine generally speaking.

@seaninsjca that kind of generalizing is dangerous. it's not just socialist governments that silence dissent. can we agree on that?

@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss that's easy to say from the safety of the US vs say venezuela where ppl are murdered for dissent
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss the whole system is fucked. but i do respect your opinion and appreciate your polite discourse
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss even ppl who have spprted our troops as translators in conflict zones aren't getting legal status
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss do you know the process to legally become a citizen? 1/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss i don't think ppl who take that risk do so lightly. i think many are trying to escape real horror
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss i do hear you. i just think ppl seeking a better life should be able to find it. 1/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss i also think that pple working and contributing (taxes etc) should have a better way to get legal
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss i don't disagree that there are immigration laws for a reason and they should be followed. 1/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos unless you're proposing we send all murders elsewhere to protect americans. then i would get your argument.
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos but without regard to their status. i fail to see this as a reason to deport ALL ppl here w/o proper docs. 2/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss of course i think violent criminals should be dealt with. 1/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss don't see how a single murder=reason to be against 1000s of ppl who come to escape violence 2/2
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss then i fail to see your argument. but that's ok. we don't need to agree. 1/2
@Baader_Meinhof thank you. was that so hard? i'd recommend just adding the source rather than snark next time.

@Baader_Meinhof i'm asking YOU to back up YOUR statements. don't spew info you can't defend.
@seaninsjca @ArchitectOfKaos @TheBeat_Boss i want to see the statistics. please show me that more murders are done by illegals.
@Baader_Meinhof LOL just putting the word "FACTS" at the top does not make them facts. source please?
