@Recook63Russell @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @POTUS Yep, they're facing military tribunals. Some will be sentenced to life imprisonment in Gitmo or military bases like Ft. Jackson. Some will be executed for treason and sedition like former CIA Director @JohnBrennan. His trial and execution will be publicly broadcast. Lex Rex!
@BarackObama Kissing Michael under the mistletoe
@BarackObama @MichelleObama Barry and Michael.
@BarackObama Per the note you and Michael received at HW Bush's funeral, you'll be tried by a military tribunal and sent to Gitmo for sedition, treason and criminal acts against the republic. You're illegitimate presidency will be nullified. Trump will become 44.
@Tyr0neShulaces Alex, your ignorance is astounding. You obviously haven't researched the FairTax &amp; provide no reasons, stats, studies to prove your point. Read the analysis done by major economists &amp; the book "The FairTax" by Bortz &amp; Linder. It also provides answers to your supposed objections.
@PolitiFact @Tyr0neShulaces @realDonaldTrump Just wait and see as you'll be eating your words. First the military tribunals are now up and running under the leadership of Generals Kelly and Mathis. Brennen's trial and execution will be public. Swamp is drained of all the treasonous, seditious criminals. Then build wall etc.
@Tyr0neShulaces Yeah, we all needed a good laugh as those two corrupt stiffs could barely put a comprehensible sentence together.
@Tyr0neShulaces When I'm in Congress, I'll push for pay cuts and term limits.
@Tyr0neShulaces Bit of a snowflake, soy boy eh?
@ProudResister @Tyr0neShulaces @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump As I write the hammer of justice is coming down upon the corrupt, establishment, Republicrats for their treasonous, seditious crimes against the republic. Lex Lex!
@Tyr0neShulaces The answer to all your economic confusion is: The @FairTaxOfficial (https://t.co/1fUVwKeUr9)
@Tyr0neShulaces In the world most Americans are in the top 1%, so should we all be paying 70% in Fed. Income taxes? I've given you many alternatives to a failed national healthcare system. I lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would work opposed to Obamacare.
@KDKThreadz I saw @libertytarian tweet, so I gather that he's doing better and on the mend?
@gina_hase @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @The_Trump_Train @POTUS I'm having the last laugh as the hammer of justice is now coming down upon the corrupt, Republicrats who've committed treason, sedition and crimes against our republic. Lex Rex! @The_Trump_Train full steam ahead! #Trump2020Landslide
@Recook63Russell @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @POTUS Don't worry, the hammer of justice is being brought down on the corrupt, establishment, Republicrats who've committed treason, sedition and other crimes against the republic. Lex Rex!
@IramiOF I worked in a private prison as a HS English teacher. The Assistant Warden told me that it was set up to fail, as CCA's HQ wouldn't help resolve security breeches. My students of different ethnicity all didn't have a father in the home. The welfare state is destroying the family.
@IramiOF @SenSanders sold out by not contesting the primary results at the DNC. Then being involved in a PAC and owning million dollar homes. Needs to redistribute his wealth to the poor. Prove he's a true Socialist. Put his money where his mouth is.
@IramiOF @realDonaldTrump just signed the most comprehensive prison reform in more than 30 years. He's getting it done. MSM only cared about Dems' Shut Down and their government plantation.
@KateAronoff @IramiOF We are grateful to @POTUS for finally bringing about legal justice in our republic. The corrupt, establishment, Republicrats are now facing military tribunals for sedition, treason and other criminal acts against our great nation. Lex Rex! #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp
@SenSanders @IramiOF How do we pay for all the Socialist goodies? How'd Venezuela work out?
@IramiOF If you're a true Socialist, how about redistributing your wealth to your students &amp; teaching for free or same pay as secretary? You can walk the talk. Compared to the rest of the world, most Americans are in the top 1%. Therefore, we should all pay 70% in taxes. Right?
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Your former boss will be tried for treasonous, seditious and criminal acts. Locked up in Gitmo or executed.

@thehill Dems continue with their obstruction, hypocrisy and lies. Not serious about serving the American people. Only care about retaining power and taking down @realDonaldTrump
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ClemsonFB Dem shutdown prevented the WH kitchen staff from preparing a meal for the Tigers.
@libertytarian Mr. Knight you must be doing better as you recover from your surgery. Praying for you.
@WayneDupreeShow @POTUS needs to make his case to the American public via the SOTU address.
@MSNBC @allinwithchris Where's the Dems? Partying in Puerto Rico with nubile girls and lobbyists. Not serious about serving the American people. Obstructionists and hypocrites.
@dcexaminer Socialist Dem has no clue as to basic economic principles, US History, Government and geopolitics, despite having majored in international relations and minored in economics at a "first class" university, U of Boston.
@SarahPalinUSA @SpeakerPelosi's finances need to be investigated.
@BillClinton @ClintonFdn Bubba can engage in recreational sex along with other Dems &amp; corrupt lobbyists. Puerto Rico allows sex trafficking. @ClintonFdn only gives 10% of it's income.  Clintons are lining their pockets. Pay-for-play. Hattians hate Clintons for doing nothing but involved is pedophilia.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Shutdown on the head of Dems. Especially Chuck and Nancy. Trump gave Donkeys lots of things they want. They refuse, obstructionists. All part of the strategy to defeat deep state and bring criminal and treasonous Republicrats, establishment to justice.
Mr. President Thanks for your work to MAGA. Millions pray for you &amp; your administration. We noticed the notes &amp; reactions to the notes distributed at HW Bush's funeral. We ask you instruct the DOJ to use RICO &amp; anti-trust laws against big tech's censorship of Conservatives.

Americans demand it! Otherwise you will all pay a price politically. Shut down is on the Dems.
real Donald trump
@HillaryClinton You're a Soros and CFR puppet. Know that note you received at HW Bush's funeral indicates that you'll be locked up in Gitmo following the military tribunals.
@vernezze This is extremely interesting that you're moving into a second career as a clinical counselor. This is @MarkPet87871033 from CLM/ALM blog. After I reach the age of 60 in a few years, I plan to return to the US and go into politics.
@gina_hase @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Nope, @The_Trump_Train still going strong as @POTUS continues to MAGA and get things done unlike the obstructionist Republicrats. Military tribunals coming, Gitmo being readied to for VIP prisoners. Ft. Jackson along with other military prisons being made ready to accommodate.
@wenaboo1214 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Nope, just trying to enlighten folks as evidenced by my mostly likes and retweets. Only a few zombie leftists like yourself post ridiculous comments.
@gayle_native1 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Dems spawned KKK (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party)@HillaryClinton loved Grand Wizard, Sen. Byrd. Hillary  uses the 'n" word according to her traveling chef. Dems love Planned Parenthood founder  Sanger who was racist. Spoke at KKK rallies.
@MaryyMaribel @SarahPalinUSA Nope, not a bot. Just a Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist who's trying to enlighten folks. So many people like and retweet my replies.
@thebenbond @thehill @SenTedCruz Prove it with evidence that would be admissible in a court of law.
@ComplicKate @Newsweek Prove it.
@Tyr0neShulaces Watch @JohnStossel debunking your contention on his segment, "Give Me a Break." He cites stats etc.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama Evidence from UBC, University of Toronto, Zogby and Gallup to support your arguments??
@thehill What did the note say that @VP receive at the HW Bush funeral? Why did @POTUS snub him?
@BillKristol Irrelevant neo-con with Trotskyite father. Fired from his own magazine he founded and suffers from Deranged Trump Syndrome. So sad.
@GadSaad Check out the work that XXX-Church does to help those addicted to porn and telling men and women the dangers of porn. Ted Bundy interview prior to execution tells how soft porn was the gateway to his vicious killings of women.
@RealMattCouch @HillaryClinton note received at the HW Bush funeral let her know that the jig is up. Lex Rex! Gitmo awaits!
@thehill @AnnCoulter He, @DrBiden had an interesting reaction to the note they were given at HW Bush's funeral. The jig is up, Joe "foot in mouth, sexual harasser of little girls"Biden @JoeBiden
@donnabrazile He tried, but Dems fled DC for the break. On their head.
@PoliticalKathy @AOC Kathy, I see you in Congress in the future. I know another Chinese-America who'd be a great ally in the House to help us continue to MAGA.
@SenatorDurbin It's on the head of the Dems for shutting down the Federal government. @realDonaldTrump and team were ready to deal, but Donkeys fled DC to enjoy their X-mas and New Year's holiday. @SpeakerPelosi went HI, not serious about governing.
@MSNBC Confused, obstructionist career politician @SpeakerPelosi is a great asset for GOP as they retake House in a huge landslide in 2020.
@amjoyshow @MichaelSteele Sell-out Steele is only a token Republicrat for CNN's failed fake news network. Ratings in the tank. Can't watch them anymore as they tell bold-face lies. Proven over and over again to be biased liars. Ted Turner agrees.
@dcexaminer Knows nothing about economics and international relations, despite the fact they were here majors at the U of Chicago. Boy did her parents waste their money sending the Congresswoman there to study.
@SarahPalinUSA @SpeakerPelosi is a confused, Socialist, obstructionist, wealthy, corrupt, career politician that must be stopped at every corner. Dems made a huge mistake making her their Speaker. She'll help GOP to regain the majority in the House.
@RealOmarNavarro @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney is a two time loser, Republicrat, establishment, cultist, flip-flopper. He is the father of Obamacare and @HillaryClinton is the mother. He's ticked that @realDonaldTrump interviewed him for a position in his administration and then didn't give him a job.
@LifeNewsHQ Follow pro-lifers we need to lobby our Congresspersons to obstruct Dems legislation to further American genocide. Support GOP legislation that protects life.
@JudgeJeanine Foul-mouthed Congressperson, who's behavior is extremely unbecoming for a Muslim woman. Pandering to the leftist Socialist Donkeys.
@politico All dead in the water, except for infrastructure. Blocked by Senate and Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Republicrat @MittRomney needs to be shut down and given useless committee assignments as a freshman Senator.
@dcexaminer Reid needs to be indicted, prosecuted and sent to prison for treasonous and criminal acts against the republic.
@LifeNewsHQ Continue the American genocide.
@Millie__Weaver Donkeys will destroy America with their failed policies. Trump and Senate will block their Socialist, obstructionist, un-American agenda.
@RepWilson Dems will regret electing this confused, corrupt, rich, unhealthy, unfit, obstructionist, Socialist, career politician.
@JudgeJeanine Judge Jeanine for the US @USSupremeCourt to replace Justice Ginsberg.
@HillaryClinton More obstruction, Socialism, deficit spending. Dems could care less for the American people. Most want to line their pockets, commit pedophilia and retain power. Kill babies and enslave minorities through the welfare state. Party of racism and Fascism.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Dems fault as Trump was waiting to deal during the Christmas New Year's break. It's all on you and you all will pay dearly at the polls.
@BarackObama Barry you can play b-ball in the prison courtyard of Gitmo.
@ComplicKate @Newsweek Evidence please. Back up your claims with proof that would be admissible in a court of law.
@Cyn7507 @TheDemCoalition @funder @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @BarackObama Nope, just an awake, articulate, Patriotic, Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama Talking about Christian doctors who already run free clinics and volunteer their time in the US and overseas. Of course they can partner with others. But they're out there and actually doing something to solve the problem.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama So let's get out there and do it! Only rhetoric and no action.
@FreeBeacon @EllenTracy13 Mayor @MikeBloomberg needs to redistribute his wealth like his billionaire leftist buddies to pay for the Paris agreement. Put your money where you mouth is.
@Tin_Tin_in_Tibt @EllenTracy13 Arrest of CFO in Canada due to placing of spy chips in the Huawei cell phones.
@Tyr0neShulaces Congress needs to pass the @FairTaxOfficial
@Tyr0neShulaces FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKeUr9) is the answer.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama I stand corrected as to the spelling. Doesn't negate  that you committed the logical fallacy. Please cite stats, polls (Zogby, Gallup), studies by reputable social scientists from major universities in both the US &amp; Canada to prove your point. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.
@jackhunter74 @AnnCoulter @CurtMills @amconmag He should appoint former Congressman Col. @AllenWest to the new Sec. of DOD
@thehill Investigation of his campaign for violating FEC laws by funneling campaign monies to the caravan. There needs to be indictments, prosecution and Beto along with campaign manager and volunteers need to go to prison.
@politico Plea agreement, rather than face a military tribunal resulted in his execution.
@TIME Fake News or real journalists?
@CNN Leader in Fake News
@Reuters Boycott the televised and live NFL games.

@Newsweek Dean suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome as many do on the left. Help find the cure. Red Pill them.
@MAGAindex @chuckschumer Collusion with the Russians. Should be indicted.
@SarahPalinUSA She studied international relations and economics at Boston U and can't even articulate and explain her views on Socialism and foreign policy. Says a lot about the overpriced education she got at that hard leftist university.
@SenSanders Senator why don't you and your Socialist leftist millionaire and billionaire cronies finance climate change agreement? Put your money where your mouth is an redistribute the wealth!
@SenatorDurbin Your party's fault as @realDonaldTrump and his team stayed in DC ready to deal and y'all fled for vacation. Not serious about serving the interests of the American people. Oust the lot of you in 2020.
@BarackObama We Americans resolve that the military tribunals take place &amp; you, @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @Comey Lynch, Holder, Podesta bros, W, Soros, Mills, Cheney,@AmbassadorRice Mueller, McCabe, @ChelseaClinton Huma, Wasserman-Shultz, @donnabrazile Ohrs, Rosenstein, Storz go to prison.
@dcexaminer Only @maddow show did well. Others all tanked in the ratings.
@LifeNewsHQ @SenKamalaHarris from my home state is a religious intolerant bigot.
@MSNBC Dems fault as @realDonaldTrump and his team stayed in DC to deal, but Donkeys left town. Not serious about protecting the American people. More about furthering their false narratives, ideology and retaining power. They'll lose big time in 2020.
@JudicialWatch Lock up Soros in Gitmo!
@SarahPalinUSA The left are such hypocrites!
@RealOmarNavarro Omar in 2020! Get ready LA District 43 InfoWarriors, true Conservatives, Libertarians, and Constitutionalist to vote and volunteer for his campaign to oust @RepMaxineWaters
@charliekirk11 Why doesn't @SenSanders practice what he preaches and redistribute all his wealth to those he states he fights for? Hypocrite.
@SenFeinstein The Senator from my home state knows full well this is a lie. Vital services continue. Government workers will get their back pay. SS checks are still sent out etc. Trump and team were willing to deal. Dems left town. Shut-down is on their head.
@PoliticalKathy Intolerant, Fascist, leftist, racist, bigots.
@BarackObama Americans all look forward to seeing you and your cronies in Gitmo.
@dcexaminer Religious bigotry and intolerance by the hard left.
@Millie__Weaver InforWarriors, pray for brother @libertytarian successful surgery and recovery.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump The Senator lies as vital services continue during a shut-down. Government workers will get their back pay. SS checks go out etc. Trump &amp; his team stayed in DC over the X-mas break to work out a compromise with Dems. They all left to go home for the holidays. It's on their head.
@peterdaou God is helping us to defeat the Republicrats (eg. @senatemajldr Rep.@PRyan), neocons like @AmbJohnBolton, leftists, Socialists, Communists, @HillaryClinton, @BarackObama @Comey, globalists like Soros, Hollywood, MSM, academia, Fascists, Antiva, BLM et al.

@colbertlateshow @JeffFlake He's returning to his hometown of Snowflake, ironic isn't it?
@Newsweek Dems founded the KKK. Senator Byrd was a Grand Wizard (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.)
@MSNBC @TheLastWord Failed Broadway show and recent documentary. People no longer listen to Mickey. Old news and has been.
@deanbc1 @KAG4All He will and Chuckie will be indicted and serve prison time for criminal and treasonous acts against our republic.
@NPR They will eventually. We can raise funds via tariffs, confiscating Drug Lords along with gangs' illegal money, and withhold financial aid we give to Mexico
@thehill It has rebounded as my wife has reminded me.
@tripgabriel Good Riddance Republicrat, establishment @SpeakerRyan
@JudicialWatch Impeach 43 (Rep of LA District 42)
@LifeNewsHQ Murdering our most vulnerable and innocent Americans is disgusting and contrary to the scientific evidence. Would Planned Parenthood advocate the abortion of Jesus? Founder Sanger was a racist and spoke at KKK rallies re: controlling the black population. Much like evil Hitler.
@SarahPalinUSA No Donkeys would have had Jesus killed via abortion as Herod also tried killings Him. More deranged Trump syndrome. They really are mentally ill.
@dcexaminer @BarackObama promised to work with @realDonaldTrump &amp; help him to be successful. A lie of course &amp; is trying along with former AG Holder trying to undermine @POTUS. He's also trying to take credit for the booming economy as his legacy is being dismantled. @MichelleObama is rude.
@AmericanLedger @Tyr0neShulaces UN should be defunded. Waste of time and money. I participated in MUN for two years and quickly realized that even this simulation revealed the incompetence of the global body. Huge corruption.  Ambassadors live high off the hog, while countrymen starve.
@Tyr0neShulaces Wealthy pay more than 40% of all taxes monies received. Poor pay nothing as do illegal aliens. Dept. of Labor stats. The private sector, churches, foundations, volunteerism, voluntarily giving by liberal Hollywood, Zuckerberg, Turner, Buffet, Bloomberg Bezos, Gates, Oprah et al.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama Cite stats, academic studies polling by Gallup or Zogby. Your ad hominim does nothing to advance your argument. Have you watched LWC's video? You need to do some research before making unsupported remarks.
@nowthisnews @ericaadunbar Stock &amp; trade for Dems to commit election fraud. Operatives along with Huma admitted it on a @Project_Veritas video. JFK &amp; LBJ are prime examples. Dem Bev Harris, election fraud expert analyzed the 2016 General Election &amp; proved that Hillary stole 5 states as did Stanford study.
@Rewire_News @ericaadunbar @AyannaPressley We need more black women in office like @RealCandaceO and Star Parker.
@catchatweetdown @ericaadunbar There's a myriad of well-documented, historically accurate books about the abusive powers by both @BillClinton and @BarackObama's administrations. A google search will provide you with the names. They can all be obtained used in good condition at https://t.co/lG9j5t1I7W
@marthasjones_ @ericaadunbar Why not ask @Oprah to bankroll the college indefinitely?
@CNN Perjured himself in testimony before Congress. Should be prosecuted.
@LifeNewsHQ Pro-death folks would want to murder this precious man as he's in their opinion useless to society. Merely Sanger, racist eugenics population control. Hitler did the same. Planned Parenthood founder spoke at KKK rallies
@Newsweek NO he won't. Trials and tribunals coming in which hundreds of government leaders all the way to top will be indicted, prosecuted and sent to prison. Gitmo, Ft Jackson and other prisons being prepared to house them. Two GOP leaders already have been convicted
@dcexaminer Beto will be indicted, convicted and sent to prison,  along with his campaign manager &amp; other campaign workers for huge FEC law violations. @Project_Veritas exposed all this. Go to their website and check it out.
@ComplicKate @Newsweek Historical eyewitness sources to prove your contention please.
@Tyr0neShulaces @BarackObama Why do Canadians  cross the boarder to healthcare? The long waits. Watch Louder with Crowder's video on Canadian healthcare system. A Canadian, grew up in the Socialist Province of Quebec. I lived in England &amp; know first hand of the failures. Christian docs can run free clinics

@CBSNews Republicrats need to stop playing games as Americans demand that they completely fund the wall!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Programs provided by groups like Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship provide true rehabilitation of prisoners.
@Newsweek It must be a historical piece about the Dems. (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.)
@TheDemCoalition @funder Trials are coming soon. @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @BarackObama &amp; their cronies will be tried, convicted &amp; sent to prison for the rest of their lives for their treasonous &amp; criminal acts. It has already happened in the case of two very high level GOP leaders.
@BBCNews Her creepy lawyer needs to pony up and pay the legal fees. Or Stormy should sue him for $2 million for his legal malpractice.

@amjoyshow @RepMaxineWaters Time to impeach 43! (Congressperson of CA Congressional District 43)
@HillaryClinton @OnwardTogether Soon Hillary, @BillClinton @BarackObama and their cronies will be tried, convicted and sent to prison for the rest of their lives, having committed criminal and treasonous acts against the republic. Justice will finally be done! Lex Rex!
@BarackObama Single payer, socialistic, nationalized healthcare is a huge failure. One needs to only look to Canada and England to see this is true. Competition, tort reform, mobility, clinics run by Christian groups &amp; choice are the true answers. Less government, more freedom.
Hilarious Trump Christmas Parody “It’s The Most Wonderful Time in 8 Year... https://t.co/xnHDN6cYWG via @YouTube
@realDonaldTrump Try to pray for you each week. Thanks for all you're doing for our country! @POTUS it's time to declassify the FISA documents, have DOJ send Clintons, Obama &amp; all their cronies to prison. Also you need to stop the social media censorship with anti-trust laws etc.
@CNN Bubba @BillClinton's good friend. They enjoyed those little girls on his private island. Log shows Clinton flew on the Lolita Express  several times. Pedophiles!
@dcexaminer Uncle "put you foot in the mouth &amp; grabbing little girls" @JoeBiden is a loser for the Dems. Secret Service agents that protected him report that he can't keep his hands to himself. In light of the #MeToo Movement he should be slapped with a sexual harassment lawsuit like Bill.
@SenJeffMerkley Yep, they control the strings of the establishment Republicrats in Congress.
@ChelseaClinton We know that studies show that vaccines don't work. I've experienced it myself. What about the Vaccine Court that pays out millions of dollars every year to those who've been adversely hurt by vaccinations. Read RFK Jr. investigative articles on the subject.
@JudicialWatch Time to impeach 43. (LA 43rd Congressional District) @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro will defeat the corrupt, divisive, hate mongering, confused, wealthy, uncaring, career politician in the next election cycle.
@MarkDice She got a degree from the U of Chicago in international relations and economics? Her rich parents wasted a lot of tuition money on her worthless education.
@AMErikaNGIRL07 All due to the financing by the Betto campaign and globalist George Soros.
@marklevinshow Good riddance Joyless Behar.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Trump is trying to overturn the policy that was begun by @BarackObama
@HillaryClinton How about your seizure like coughing fit on the failed tour with rapist hubby. Looks like y'all will have to cancel as nobody wants nor cares about what you or @BillClinton have to say. Americans do want you both in prison for conspiring with the Russians.
@dcexaminer Foul-mouthed alt leftist Whoppi should leave also. She and Joy could start their own echo chamber show on CNN or @MSNBC
@AMErikaNGIRL07 Socialist nonsense, like Socrates predicted in his classic, "The Republic." Good for the grandfather confronting this young teacher for trying to indoctrinate his grandson with gender fluidity. I'd contact the Principal, Superintendent &amp; School Board and demand that she be fired.
@HillaryClinton Time for @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton and their cronies to go to prison for a myriad of treasonous crimes against our great republic. Lex Rex! 	The list of bodies associated with the Clinton Crime family who've mysterious died. https://t.co/sKmR60lCbK
@dcexaminer Free speech and patriotism triumphs, despite the triggered hard leftist, coddled, whining, cry baby, snowflake, soy boys, Socialist, Donkeys, BLM, Antifa, NAACP race baiters, humorless, unempathetic, and radical 3rd Wave feminists.
I think co-founder Steve Jobs would be very upset with the current CEO John Cook and the direction he's taking his company. For example removing apps from the store and receiving an award from ADL for censoring speech &amp; restricting commerce. Against the US Constitution. Fascist!
@dcexaminer End of Dr. @neiltyson's career.
@dcexaminer Alpha male on left and soy boy, Beta male on the right.
@marklevinshow Need to tell criminal, treasonous Mueller to issue report within a week and face defunding by Congress.
@KathastropheZ Hey they're treated better than Asians regarding acceptable to a university.
@SarahKSilverman State 20 lies in context without editorializing, Sarah. Google Obama and Hillary using pathological liar.
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton Bushes, Clintons and Obamas are cut from the same cloth, family friends and all establishment globalists. I call them Republicrats.
@CNN False narratives. Pick it up at a used bookstore or library sale for a buck just for fictional laughs.
@WashTimes I regretfully voted for the establishment globalist. in a radio interview he said, "if Americans knew what the Bushes have done to this country, they'd take us out and hang us (sic)"
@dcexaminer Time for Holder to be indicted for Fast and Furious amongst other crimes, prosecuted and sent to prison along with all his treasonous, criminal cronies. #LockThemAllUp Lex Rex!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hard leftist tax payer supported fake news organization. Why don't leftist billionaires like Zuckerberg and @BillGates pay for the radio program?
@kolbasovairina2 Picture worth a thousand words. In our PC, snowflake, leftist, safe space, therapy dog, play dough, microaggressions, MeToo movement climate, the intern definitely has a legal case both in criminal and tort law for assault and battery.
@DonaldJTrumpJr HuffPo has lost it's mind going after the Rankin Christmas classic.
@thehill Good riddance RINO @SpeakerRyan . You're obstruction of the Trump agenda along with other establishment Republicrats has been unconscionable. We won't miss your unremarkable leadership of the House.
@thehill Can't believe that Donkeys are keeping this confused, befuddled, ancient, corrupt, hard leftist career politician as their leader.
@Comey #LockComeyUp
@thehill Fake Science at best. Read "Politically Incorrect Global Warming." And watch the documentary, "Climate Hustle." All available at https://t.co/lG9j5t1I7W.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama is trying to take credit for all the great things our President has done. Barry's legacy will be overturned, he'll be reduced to the ash heap of history and imprisoned.
@SarahPalinUSA Suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and Liberalism. As @MarkDice says, "help find the cure." Get some of his great books and T-shirts at his website. Also  check him out on YouTube.
@marklevinshow Amazing that the Clown News Network or Clinton Crime Network actually took a principled stand and fired that fake academic.
@RealJamesWoods Unthinking, zombie indoctrinated millennial snowflakes , who were never taught true American History, values and the Judeo-Christian worldview that has made our nation great.
@thehill He deserve it for trying to meet with Chairman Un and getting him to talk with the ROK's President in an attempt to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. The Fascist Socialist @BarackObama got it for doing absolutely nothing! Worthless prize.
@SarahPalinUSA HE is the reason for the season. (Luke 2)
@WayneDupreeShow Always the narcissist.
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Lobby DOJ to investigate, indict, prosecute and imprison Hillary, Obama, Bill, Huma, Mills, Chelsea, Podesta bros, Lynch, Holder, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Mueller, Ohrs, Stortz, Page et al for treasonous and criminal acts against our republic.
@dbongino Clintons are irrelevant and hated by the American people. Time for them to go to prison. #LockBillandHillaryUp.
@JeffFlake Back to your hometown Snowflake. Ironic isn't it?
@billmaher Evidence Bill, evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that would be admissible in court?? Remember the Burger King ad "where's the beef?" This is what I pose to you. Stop with the false narratives and unfounded slanderous remarks.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Mueller investigation is a nothing burger and absolutely no evidence of Trump or campaign conspiring with Russians @HillaryClinton on the other hand did conspire. @BarackObama wiretapped Trump campaign, which is a 1,000 bigger than Watergate. #LockThemBothUp.
@RealOmarNavarro @WSJ You know those establishment, globalist Republicrats who just wanted to preserve power and the status quo. @SpeakerRyan has to take responsibility for huge losses in the House. Good riddance RINO Ryan.
@SenFeinstein No such thing Senator. Evidence that would be upheld in a court of law??
@SarahPalinUSA #ObamaForPrison2019
@jerome_corsi I wish Larry Klayman had remained at JW as he'd have put  @HillaryClinton @BillClinton in prison a long time ago. @TomFitton bungled the whole thing and many of the cases were dropped. He didn't hire Rep. Bob Barr to prosecute as Mr. Klayman had instructed.
@POTUS continues to MAGA! Closing in on 300 promises kept! Unprecedented in American history! https://t.co/4HCMoF5DCg
@PoliticalKathy Triggered those unthinking snowflakes eh? In a 1988 Multiculturalism class to teach Jr. &amp; Sr. High, I did a presentation on the beliefs of Swedish immigrants as I'm a descendant of one. My classmates didn't  mind as I backed it up with sources. Now scholarship is out the window.
@JJasmith4 @HillaryClinton Read the eyewitness accounts by Secret Service agents, staffers, AK Troopers, Johnny Chung, Larry Nichols, Dick Morris, @peterschweizer @wikileaks @JudicialWatch docs, YouTube, @DineshDSouza @AnnCoulter Rodger Stone, Congressional Record, Senate's 10 yr study, @jerome_corsi et al
@HillaryClinton The true Fascist-Socialist https://t.co/E87yNT8vXc
@HillaryClinton Sec. Clinton, your work is over as it's only a matter of time before the DOJ impanels a Grand Jury, they indict you and all your cronies for treasonous and criminal acts, Prosecutions and prison time will follow when y'all will spending the rest or your lives. #LockThemAllUp!!
@SeanChulo @BillClinton Gave nuclear secrets to PRC as described in the book, "The Year of the Rat".
@BillClinton A true Fascist-Socialist like @BarackObama https://t.co/RuVqcImqYR
@BillClinton For a price of $2,500 come and hear two corrupt leaders (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash. Nichols. "Clinton Chronicles"  D' Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. : Stone. The Clinton's War on Women. et al) who have influenced our world in an adverse way.
@jwarnerwallace I'm wondering if our approach has to shift from an evidential approach as articulated by my law and apologetics prof Dr. Montgomery to a more cultural approach like that of Dr. Francis Shaeffer?
@TheDemCoalition GOP, Constitutionalists, Libertarians and Conservatives would love to have the old, confused, bumbling, lying, corrupt, hyper-partisan, divisive, career politician and player of the politics of identity and destruction as Speaker. It can only mean that GOP will win in landslide!!
@dbongino It seems that all the delayed races in finally tallying up the votes is called for the Donkeys. Mmmm? Possibly some election tampering? DOJ needs to investigate.
@dcexaminer Paid for by George Soro's foundations and Beto's US Senate campaign monies.
@BarackObama @MBK_Alliance Mr. Obama will be going to prison for wiretapping @realDonaldTrump illegally &amp; defrauding the FISA Court (declassified FISA documents). And for conspiracy with @HillaryClinton in Libya &amp; the Arab Spring. Conspiring with AG Holder, Fast &amp; Furious. Barry enjoy the small confinement
@HillaryClinton @HRC All roads lead to prison for you and @BillClinton
@SenGillibrand Mueller needs to be indicted and prosecuted for his involvement in Uranium 1.
@HillaryClinton Hillary you're going to prison for Uranium 1 with Mueller, @ClintonFdn pay-for-play, Benghazi, collusion/conspiracy, election fraud (@wikileaks &amp; evidence from Dem. Bev Harris}, classified e-mails on a private server, conspiring with the PRC (Year of the Rat) and list goes on.
@JohnJamesMI John, I think you should run again. For the House or Senate.
@urbanmode @StormyDaniels Overpriced. Wait until it hits Goodwill or Library sale, so you can get it for a buck
@StormyDaniels Your attorney gave you bad counsel and gives the profession a bad name. Lawyers already have a bad reputation as pond scum. I think you should sue him for malpractice. He used you to get in the limelight and try to make a presidential bid.
@billmaher Once again you make no sense in you're rant. Leftist echo chamber.
@dcexaminer Loss for the people of the Golden State and a Patriot who helped @POTUS MAGA!
@dbongino #LockHerUp for FEC criminal violations.
@JohnKerry @realDonaldTrump Sec. Kerry why are you still trying to conduct US foreign policy with Iran? Don't you know that you don't work at the @StateDept anymore?
@WayneDupreeShow I'd still sue to force the AZ State Attorney General to investigate for possible voter fraud. Or call in Dem Bev Harris, election fraud expert to do some analysis.
@TomFitton #LockHerUp for continued FEC violations and criminal acts.
@MarkDice In this age of triggered snowflakes, @Acosta definitely committed criminal and the tort of assault and battery. Definitely actionable in a court of law. Mr. Acosta is fortunately that he just got his press pass revoked for a time.
@dcexaminer @HillaryClinton will then be running from prison like Eugene Debbs. In fact they share the same political ideology.
@AdamSchiff You want to pursue the false narrative of Russian conspiracy? Absolutely no proof &amp; Special Counsel Mueller has nothing. @Project_Veritas videos of CNN's Van Jones &amp; producers prove that the whole thing's  fake. Investigate Mueller &amp; the @HillaryClinton involvement in Uranium 1.
@JohnJamesMI Thanks for your service. Sorry you didn't win the Senate seat. I posted on social media my support and contributed to your campaign. I wonder if there was any election fraud as I truly expected you to win.
@MichaelAvenatti Incomplete statement of the facts. Didn't you learn IRAC in law school? The man called @TuckerCarlson's daughter a whore. No assault or battery took place. Better go back and review your Barbri notes or Crim Law text.
@MichaelAvenatti Why aren't you helping your client @StormyDaniels? Just using her to propel yourself into the limelight as a potential presidential candidate. Sorry you're already old news &amp; deserve the title of creepy porn lawyer, giving legal profession even a worse rep.
@thebenbond @thehill @SenTedCruz Texans spoke and Betos' career is over. Governor will investigate his campaign for FEC violations. @Project_Veritas undercover video of campaign manager admits that some of the $100 raised was funneled to the Central American caravan.
@nehring_kai @Jim_Jordan Top priorities for Donkeys: get @realDonaldTrump's tax returns, impeach Justice Kavanaugh and continue the nothing burger (admitted by @VanJones68 and CNN producers on @Project_Veritas undercover videos) Russian collusion. Lose big time, in 2020. @POTUS re-elected. MAGA!
@tripgabriel @Acosta He understands that our laws are based upon the Bible. Lawyers studied Blackstone's "Commentaries," which quote Bible extensively. Dr. Montgomery's study, "Law &amp; Gospel: Lawyer's Quest" proves all various branches of law, eg.. criminal, property etc are directly from Scripture.
@Acosta It's been a long time coming. I would have suspended your WH credentials long time ago. Longwinded qs about same thing. Rude &amp; inconsiderate to other reporters.  Nothing to do with !st Amendment, but it's all about you @Project_Veritas undercover video prove CNN is fake.
@CalebJHull Oust corrupt @SenatorMenendez indicted by Obama administration and hung jury at trial, but not acquittal
@elizabethforma @PolisForCO Prediction Warren loses Senate seat. Presidential hopes dashed.
@jaketapper Fake @jaketapper winner of the best Fake News reporter. Congrats!
@Jim_Jordan Rep. @Jim_Jordan will be the new Speaker of the House
@jpodhoretz @hughhewitt John and Tony need to be prosecuted and sent to prison

@AnnCoulter @DykstraDame And hold House
@LeoDiCaprio Make CA Great Again and toss out the hard leftist Dems who are destroying my home state. Organizations, businesses and people like myself have fled in record numbers.
@VanJones68 @AC360 @CNN Not your racist white lash as you said in 2016. According to @prageru video by historian Dr. Carol Swaine and @DineshDSouza documentary, "Hillary's America: Secret History of the Democratic Party," they are the true racists. Check them out.
@JudicialWatch #LockHerUp JW had chance to do so in the early days of her husband's presidency. @TomFitton blew the opportunity to prevent all this treasonous nonsense.
@nytimes 10 gains in House by GOP
@edhenry @FoxNews Fake News from FOX, will have egg on the face at the end of the night
@NPR Punished by voters for doing the right thing.
@FoxNews GOP gains 10 seats in House and 4 in Senate
@TeamCavuto @FoxNews Fake news from FOX
@SarahPalinUSA @BarackObama barely can fill a High School gym. Needs to be indicted, prosecuted and sent to prison for wiretapping Trump campaign. Greater scandal than Watergate. Lobby your elected officials along with Trump to prosecute the treasonous criminal.
@SenGillibrand Retire Senator Gillibrand. New Yorkers deserve better representation in DC
@JohnJamesMI Vote for businessman and vet John James for US Senate to continue to help MAGA!
@HillaryClinton #RedWave2018 GOP picks up 10 in House and 4 in Senate. Left melts down and calls for violence in the streets.
Need a person who truly represents the  43rd. Maxine doesn't even live in the district. Considered unruly in the well of Congress. Violated House rules of decorum. Incoherent &amp; confused when delivering speeches in which she calls for violence &amp; wants impeach with no proof. https://t.co/zxNSRy3Y3i
@llerer @hughhewitt He's a rapist, sexual predator who's been involved with more than 22 scandals ranging from Whitewater, Chinagate ("Year of the Rat"), Pardongate, MENA, @ClintonFdn pay-for-play (Schweizer. Clinton Cash), illegitimate son etc. Time to indict, prosecute &amp; send to prison for life.
@SenWarren Dr. Shiva is the real Indian, who'll Make MA Great Again!. Sen. Warren is a career politician, lobbyist, obstructionist, partisan, divisive player of the politics of identity and destruction. Higher taxes, more big government, more regulations, open borders and less freedom. https://t.co/IfSNP0SrDW
@thehill Beto doesn't represent the values that Texans hold dear. The son of a billionaire who tries to be Hispanic by using the nickname  Beto,  Says he'll work with Trump, but also wants to impeach him. Rep. O' Rourke favors gun control and open borders. Vote @SenTedCruz on Nov. 6th.
@RealSaavedra VP Joe "foot in your mouth and grabber of little girls" Biden can only get 180 people to come and hear him speak. @BarackObama can barely fill a HS gym. @realDonaldTrump gets 10s of 1,000s and the same waiting to get in to the event.
@HillaryClinton Policy was put in place by your former boss @BarackObama and now @realDonaldTrump had to rectify the mess via executive order.
@continetti @hughhewitt GOP will gain 10-15 seats in the House and 4-5 seats in the Senate. #RedWaveRising2018
@BarackObama Obamacare was responsible for the death of my best friend from college's sister.
@SenGillibrand Time for the voters of NY to retire  @SenGillibrand as part of the obstructionist, partisan, divisive, big government, higher taxes, restricting our freedoms, greater regulations, favoring judges who legislate from the bench, killing the innocent unborn &amp; open borders Democrats
@SarahPalinUSA Time for Barak to be indicted, prosecuted and sent to prison for his treasonous criminal acts against our country. Wiretapping the Trump campaign is bigger than Watergate ever was!
@BillKristol Mr. Kristol, the irrelevant neocon, his father a proud Trotskyite  and fired by the magazine he founded.
@SenSanders How's Socialism been working out in other countries? National healthcare in both Britain and Canada is a failure (@prageru)
@AMErikaNGIRL07 @DineshDSouza Known as the deep state. But there are Patriotic members of the Intelligence Community who care about the Constitution and the survival of our republic. They were able to hack various e-mails and give them to @wikileaks. Nothing to do with the Russians (@Project_Veritas)
@Newsweek More than 280 promises kept and counting. Unprecedented in American political history. His ratings are the same as @BarackObama's at this time. Many are walking away from the Democratic plantation of the enslaving welfare state.
@MMFlint Ratings for these late night talk show political hacks are plummeting. I long for the Days of Jay Leno and Johnny Carson. Today's hosts aren't even funny.
@JohnJamesMI @stabenow John @JohnJamesMI for US Senate on November 6th as he'll help our @realDonaldTrump to continue to MAGA!
@dcexaminer Glad Senator @JeffFlake is retiring to his hometown of Snowflake. See how he caved in during the Judge Kavanaugh hearings. No backbone.
@SarahPalinUSA This inarticulate, Socialist, spoiled rich kids needs to have her political career nipped in the bud before it starts. Socialism doesn't work and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't a clue as to how to defend her ideology. Check out the YouTube videos.
@RealOmarNavarro District 43 voters need to oust Ms. Waters and elect a man who'll actually do something to help the people and improve their lives. Vote @RealOmarNavarro on November 6th. MAGA!
@dcexaminer Dems couldn't give a damn about the caravan folks. They just want votes via open borders to retain and increase their power. Let's prevent them from doing so and vote for Conservative Republicans who'll help @realDonaldTrump to continue to MAGA!
@jaketapper Snapshot of his Twitter account shows he followed you guys, late night talk show hosts, Obama and other leftists. He's a registered Democratic. And @Acosta foolishly opened the fake bomb and took a snapshot to post on Twitter. All proof that he isn't a @realDonaldTrump supporter.
@ClintonFdn Watch the documentary, "Clinton Cash" online.
@jaketapper @RepCurbelo Fake Tapper, part of the team at the Fake News Network, known as the  Clinton Criminal Network.
@Morning_Joe @NBCNews @maristpoll All due to Dems, MSM, academia, Hollywood, big tech, leftists, Antifa, BLM, Soros, Socialists, Communists, mindless students, deep state, @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton and all their cronies.
@PattyMurray #RedWaveRising2018 GOP extends their majority in both the House and Senate. Leftist lose their minds, violently riot, destroy property and beat Conservatives, Christians, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and Trump supporters within an inch of their lives.
@SenFeinstein Your party used to favor a wall and securing our borders. Now it's become a power play. Study the life of Caesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers Union. Watch the @prageru video on immigration with @TuckerCarlson
@BarackObama MAGA by increasing the GOP majority in both the House &amp; Senate. #RedWaveRising2018 Donkeys will continue their obstructionist ways, carry on the division of Obama, raise taxes, open our borders, expand the Federal government,  more regulations, Socialistic healthcare etc.
@JohnJamesMI @realDonaldTrump The people of the great state of Michigan need to send @JohnJamesMI to the US Senate as he'll help President Trump to continue to MAGA!
@RealOmarNavarro Voters in District 43 need to retire Maxine. My fellow Californians deserve an elected official in the House who will continue to help @realDonaldTrump MAGA!. Vote @RealOmarNavarro on November 6th!
@Morning_Joe #RedWaveRising2018 Vote Conservative Republican candidates on November 6th!
@HillaryClinton Dem Bev Harris, election fraud expert found that Hillary Clinton stole the election in 5 states, so Trump won the popular vote too. @Project_Veritas exposed the fact that Dems routinely steal elections. Notable examples JFK and LBJ. @wikileaks revealed that HRC stole nomination.
@dcexaminer I thought BS had promised to move to our northern neighbor long ago. She'll love their failed socialized healthcare system and the lack of a Constitutional right to speech. A comedian was brought before a tribunal for a joke he delivered in a set.
@dcexaminer Racist &amp; foolish comments by one of the alt left &amp; fake news' mouthpieces. Vote for Conservative GOP candidates in your districts &amp; states. Make Your State &amp; America Great!  Dems are obstructionists, divisive, want higher taxes, government expansion, less freedom &amp; open borders.
@HillaryClinton You used to support securing our southern border and building a fence. Flip flopper and another power hungry politician. #LockHerUp. Lex Rex!
@HillaryClinton America will vote for Conservatives. GOP gains 10-15 seats in the House &amp; 4-5 seats in the Senate. Dems continue to lose &amp; go the way of the Whigs. We have awakened to the plantation of welfare that Donkeys have created for votes &amp; power. Adios Donkeys &amp; good riddance! #RedWave
@dcexaminer Union that truly could care less about the kids in the public school system, Vouchers, virtual, private, charter and home schooling are the solution.
@JohnJamesMI @stabenow John James for US Senate in Ohio.
@dcexaminer Time for the voters to retire Rep @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer. The good people of my home state CA and NY deserve much better leadership in Congress.
@HillaryClinton @AndrewGillum @DonnaShalala #RedWaveRising2018
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters Fellow Californians in district 43, make sure you vote for Omar Navarro on Nov. 6th. He'll be a great representative for you in DC. Maxine Waters needs to retire and make the way for younger and more innovative leadership who'll Make District 43 Great Again!
@HillaryClinton @EmergeAmerica #RedWaveRising2018 GOP women will win!
@SenGillibrand The good people of NY need to retire Senator Gillibrand  of the party of obstructionists, partisans, division, players of politics of destruction higher taxes, big government, violators of our Constitutional rights, killing the unborn, and those who want the courts to legislate.
@dcexaminer No more Clintons in public office. We've had enough of that crime family that need to go to prison for @ClintonFdn crimes (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.) pay-for-play. All three Clinton's are involved in the family affair.
@HillaryClinton Nowhere contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Author"s widow told us that it's based on the !0 Commandments. Why don't you and your billionaire buddies fund the murdering of innocent babies. Remember the definition of murder from your Yale Criminal Law class?
@HillaryClinton Secret Service agent, Gary Aldrich states in "Unlimited Access" that you have contempt for the Secret Service, use foul language &amp; have frequent angry outbursts. Collaborated by many aides &amp; staffers. In an interview with your traveling chief  he said you use the "n" word a lot.
@SenWarren @PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai is a real Indian not a fake one. He has real and innovative solutions for the opioid crisis and others. Vote Dr. Shiva Independent for US Senate MA. https://t.co/WHNMihJFnZ. https://t.co/T9ohdAnV1C
@MarkDice Fake @jaketapper having self doubts as to whether he believes the  fake news and false narratives he's spewing out.
@MarkDice When will @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @BarackObama and the whole gang be prosecuted and sent to prison for the rest of their lives?? #LockThemAllUp #LexRex
@MarkDice When is former AG Holder going to prison for his program that supplied weapons to Mexican drug cartel members who killed DOA agents.
@MarkDice Isn't it always the way that leftists set-up false flags like this.
@MarkDice Racist and Fascist remarks from useful idiot, Don Lemonhead.
@MarkDice Racist remarks that border on being Fascist.
@MarkDice @ABC Sexual harassment, bordering on pedophilia. Whoopie is sick.
@MarkDice (High pitched voice) "Joker" @brianstelter mouths off as he has a nervous breakdown. Help leftists like @brianstelter find the cure for liberalism.
@MarkDice Sleazy porno lawyer needs to be disbarred for malpractice in his representation of Stormy.
@MarkDice I have as much Indian blood in me as @SenWarren does. Elect Dr. Shiva to the US Senate. The Commonwealth of MA deserves much better representation in DC.
@MarkDice NPC, useful idiot, former CIA intern, Project Mockingbird mouthpiece, Soros puppet working for the Clinton Crime Network.
@MarkDice The Joker losing it.
@MarkDice Beto has disqualified himself in so many ways. He's a leftist that doesn't represent the values of the Lone Star State in any way. Vote @SenTedCruz
@BrianKolfage @MarkDice @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr I've had my account disabled 3 times, with no explanation.
@MarkDice Dr. Thomas Sowell rightfully called @BarackObama a Fascist Socialist. Dr. Sowell indicated that he liked my Tweet.
@MarkDice Lemmings, useful idiots, Donkey zombies, psychotics, demon possessed in some cases, Soros puppets.
@MarkDice To be rebuked by one of the network anchors, Ted Koppel has caused Brian (high pitched voice) "The Joker" @brianstelter to come unhinged like most of the hard and alt left.
@RealMAGASteve @AMErikaNGIRLBOT Illegal meddling with our electoral process by Dems A long history of doing so. Dem Bev Harris, election fraud expert determined that @HillaryClinton stole the election in  5 states. @POTUS  won the popular vote. @BarackObama encouraged illegals to vote. @Project_Veritas
@beccastillo_ @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton @CGIU Watch dog group determined that only 10% of the donations are actually received by those it's intended for. The people of Haiti despise them! Pay-for-play under HRC at the @StateDept (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash)
@dcexaminer Sleezy porno lawyer should be disbarred for how he represented Stormy. Now she has to pay for @realDonaldTrump's legal fees for his incompetence. Another example of the unethical attorney.
@SenGillibrand The Jr. Senator from NY has got to go. The people of the great people of New York deserve better representation in the US Senate.
@AnnCoulter She must have gotten a big fat check for her appearance (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.)

@SarahPalinUSA The good people of the Commonwealth need to retire this woman who pretends to be Cherokee for professional advancement. Time to elect Dr. Shiva for US Senate. MA needs new and innovative leadership. Vote for Shiva on Nov. 6th!
@KamalaHarris Vote for GOP Conservatives to continue to help @POTUS to MAGA! More than 280 promises kept! Unprecedented! I would appeal to my fellow Californians to vote to Make CA Great Again! Bid the Donkeys goodbye and release the Golden State from the enslavement by the Dems.
@FoxNews @SenatorCardin The Senator is wrong. He and other Donkeys are just trying to destroy our nation and culture (@AnnCoulter "Adios America!") They only want the illegal immigrant caravans, who are funded by George Soros to storm our country for their votes.
@JaySekulow Every life is a precious life. Support CareNet and your local pro-life pregnancy centers.
@SenGillibrand The good people of NY need to retire obstructionist, partisan, divisive, players of Identity and the politics of destruction, Sen. Gillibrand along with her fellow Dems. Americans deserve better than these Donkeys. Vote GOP Conservatives on Nov. 6th to continue to MAGA!
@RealOmarNavarro @dbongino @Politicon Time for elderly, confused, corrupt, millionaire, career politician, @RepMaxineWaters to retire. The 43rd needs fresh, new, innovative leadership that will help @realDonaldTrump to continue to MAGA! Vote @RealOmarNavarro  on Nov. 6th.

@thehill His career will end when he loses to @SenTedCruz Beto doesn't represent the values of Texans.
@SarahPalinUSA Rosie needs to move to Canada as she promised. It will be better for her mental health.
@dcexaminer HRC can't run again as she'll be in prison along with her other cronies. #LockThemAllUp
@Newsweek Vote GOP, unless you want the politics of destruction, identity, partisanship, division, obstruction and the undoing of the great strides President Trump has made to improve our economy, restore religious liberties, rights of unborn &amp; appoint judges that won't legislate.
@KamalaHarris Make CA Great Again, vote GOP. Send the Donkeys packing. Californians deserve better representation in Congress. Dems are obstructionists, partisan, divisive, &amp; play the politics of identity and destruction. GOP will help @realDonaldTrump to further his agenda of economic growth.
@PrisonPlanet His response was psychotic and probably he's demon possessed.
@JudgeJeanine Trump needs to fire AG Sessions, appoint @JaySekulow to the position. Then he should appoint @JudgeJeanine or @Judgenap as Special Prosecutor to deal with the treasonous crimes of  @HillaryClinton, @BarackObama Mueller, Huma, Mills, the Orhs, @Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe et al.
@SenWarren The good people of the Commonwealth need to elect Dr. Shiva to the US Senate. He's an immigrant from India, entrepreneur, author, scientist, has four earned degrees from MIT and invented  email. He'll help to Make MA Great Again!
@LindseyGrahamSC #RedWaveRising2018 Increase our majority in the US Senate and House of Representatives and help @realDonaldTrump continue to MAGA!
@SenGillibrand The good people of NY need to retire Senator Gillibrand. New Yorkers deserve better representation in the US Senate.
@SenatorCollins Re-elect Senator Collins for taking a principled stance in voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the  @USSupremeCourt. She understands that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
@RealOmarNavarro My fellow Californians in District 43 need to elect Omar to truly represent the good people of that area. @RepMaxineWaters doesn't live in the district, but in a Hancock Park mansion . Waters needs to retire as she calls for impeachment without any evidence &amp; advocates violence.
@TheLastWord My fellow citizens of the Golden State in @RepAdamSchiff's district need to change leadership. You deserve a rep that won't obstruct, perpetuate false narratives of Russian conspiracy (when FISA documents are declassified lots of Dems will be in trouble).  Dems conspired.
@dcexaminer Let's continue to MAGA and advance @realDonaldTrump's agenda. He's fulfilled over 280 of his promises. Unprecedented in US history. Elect Congressional candidates that will help @POTUS
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams #RedWaveRising2018
@SenSanders Keep endorsing candidates and they'll lose, thereby helping GOP to extend their majorities in Congress. Thanks for your help Bernie.
@MMFlint Latest documentary a big time loser at the box office. Moore should have given away free popcorn to attract an audience, like he gave away free hot dogs for his one-man show on Broadway. Also a big loser at the box office.
@billmaher #RedWaveRising2018
@dscc GOP will increase Senate majority by 4-5 seats. #RedWaveRising2018 Continue to MAGA! @realDonaldTrump has fulfilled over 280 promise thus far. Unprecedented in US history!
@SenGillibrand Retire Senator Gillibrand as the great people deserve better representation in the US Senate.
@HillaryClinton Policy of @BarackObama that @realDonaldTrump has overturned via executive order.  "@TIME lied with their cover story. Not a child that was separated from her mother. Husband told her not to go to the US via a coyote. Fake news!
@HillaryClinton If you want to overturn the great economic successes of the last 20 months, the restoration of religious liberty, protecting the rights of the unborn, cleaning out lobbyists and draining the corrupt DC culture, then elect the partisan, obstructionist, divisive, violent Dems.
Hillary &amp; Bill are going to make a $2,500 a head tour. I doubt Americans really want to pay so much to see 2 criminal &amp; treasonous politicians (22 scandals, eyewitness accounts by Secret Service agents, AR Troopers, businessman Johnny Chung, Larry Nichols, and Dick Morris et al

@jamiedhancock @dallasnews @BetoORourke I would ask Texans to research the websites of both candidates for US Senate. Then decide who best represents you and vote for him on Nov. 6th. I believe Sen.

@Morning_Joe #RedWaveRising2018 MAGA! We keep winning, winning, winning and Donkeys, progressives, alt left, Socialists, Communists, academia, MSM, Hollywood, leftists are all losing their minds. Trump Derangement Syndrome. Help to find the cure.
@dscc #RedWaveRising2018 GOP will gain 10-15 in House and 3-4 in Senate. Donkeys will react violently on the streets resulting in murders.
@foxandfriends There's a good chance that they'll react violently and kill whites, cops, Conservative Congresspersons, Conservative talk show host, Trump supporters et al.
@realDonaldTrump I suggest you appoint Dr. Alan Keyes to be the new Amb. to the UN. He worked under Amb. Jean Kirkpatrick &amp; was a Vice-Counsel to India. He'd play tough with those globalists &amp; Reagan was a great admirer of his. Patriot, Constitutionalist, True  Conservative.
@HillaryClinton Two years of Model @UN as a rep for W. Germany &amp; DK &amp; I came to the realization that the globalist body is a waste of time and money. If I was @realDonaldTrump I'd tell the US Permanent Rep to the UN to prepare everything to exit. Then via executive order withdraw our funding.
@RWitherspoon Research and vote for the  candidate that best represents you. Go to their websites, e-mail or FB message them questions. Go to rallies, speeches and forums etc. Clear choice between continuing to MAGA or undo things and Make America Worse Again. Crucial  for our republic.
@jodikantor @RWitherspoon @billclarkphotos No corroborating evidence for Dr. Ford's testimony. Constitution guarantees on is innocent until proven guilty. Dems used Dr. Ford and then threw her under the bus. Politics of identity partisanship and destruction by the Dems. They will pay dearly at the polls November 6th.
@RWitherspoon Love your films. Showed "Penelope" to my students &amp; we talked about appearances and beauty. I can't wait until November either. As an ex-pat I'll be voting via e-mail. #RedWaveRising2018 Gains for GOP in both the House &amp; Senate.  Ashamed @SenFeinstein is my home states' Senator.
@SethMacFarlane Mr. MacFarlane, no collaborating evidence was presented to support Dr. Ford's testimony. According to the Constitution a person is innocent until proven guilty. Did @BillClinton have the necessary temperament? How about the women who accused him of sexual assault &amp; rape? HRC??
@SowellDaily Thanks for liking my Tweet Dr. @ThomasSowell You're one of my economic heroes along with Dr. Milton Friedman. Love your books on "Basic Economics" and "Marxism." If I was @POTUS, I'd appoint you as one of my economic advisors.
@SarahKSilverman Give it up, Sarah. No collaborating evidence for Dr. Ford's testimony. She's a victim who's been used by the Donkeys. Mainly my home state's @SenFeinstein
@dcexaminer Holder needs to be indicted, prosecuted and sent to prison for Fast and Furious.
@billmaher #RedWaveRising2018 Donkeys will lose big time! I'm embarrassed to admit that @SenFeinstein and Senator @KamalaHarris are representing my home state. #OustFeinsteinandHarris. Make CA Great Again!
@MMFlint No Mikey, nobody wanted to see it as we all know it's merely a propaganda piece. Just like your one-man Broadway show.
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams @foxnewsnight He's a distinguished jurist and scholar who'll be a great addition to the @USSupremeCourt. Listen to @SenatorCollins speech on @SenateFloor
@foxandfriends Despicable behavior by a prof who's inciting violence. Not protected speech. Should be banned for life from Twitter as she's clearly violating their community standards. Will Dorsey follow through on his own rules? Doubt it!
@SarahPalinUSA My fellow Californians need to oust career politician @SenFeinstein. We deserve better representation in DC. She's an obstructionist, partisan, plays identity politics and the politics of destruction.
@MMFlint You're latest film is a dog, much like your Broadway one man show. Should have given free popcorn to lure people into the theaters. No one cares about your highly edited "documentary" that's really leftist propaganda.
@SenGillibrand @cspan Did you believe the women that @BillClinton raped and sexually assaulted? How about @HillaryClinton enabling her husband, a sexual predator and also trying to destroy the women who made the accusations?
@SarahPalinUSA How about suspending her without pay due to her remarks that incite violence against the GOP members of the @senjudiciary committee?
@SarahPalinUSA My fellow Californians in her district need to vote her out.
@SarahPalinUSA New Yorkers deserve better leadership in the US Senate! Not the hard leftist, extreme partisanship, politics of destruction, identity, obstructionism, the expansion of the government, and less freedom,
@SarahPalinUSA A disgrace in my home state. We Californians deserve better leadership. Not the hard leftist  politics of destruction, identity, obstructionism and partisanship.
@SarahPalinUSA According to economist, author, columnist, scholar, educator Dr. Thomas Sowell, Obama is a Fascist Socialist. I totally agree!
@SarahPalinUSA #GovPalinforSenate2022
@SarahPalinUSA We've got to find the cure for Deranged @realDonaldTrump Syndrome. They need to take the red pill.
@SarahPalinUSA Neocon @AmbJohnBolton has got to go. Replace him with Ambassador Alan Keyes (GOP Senate and presidential candidate, Reagan appointee to the UN, Vice-Counsel in India, True Conservative, pro-life, Constitutionalist.)
@SarahPalinUSA What do you expect from US Senate Minority Leader @SenSchumer' s niece?Obstructionist, partisanship and politics of destruction runs in the family.
@SarahPalinUSA The politics of destruction by the Donkeys have been defeated!
@SarahPalinUSA @lisamurkowski I have been lobbying Governor Palin to challenge Senator Murkowski in 2022. Alaskans deserve representation in the US Senate that doesn't play into the partisanship and politics of destruction that's be foisted upon the American people by Democrats. #PalinforSenate2022
@PoliticalKathy True Fascists.
@thedonaldreddit @PoliticalKathy Profiting from the accusations. Used by Donkeys for power grab &amp; politics of destruction.  @SenFeinstein from my home state threw her under the bus. My fellow Californians need to oust her when she's up for re-election. CA Donkeys want to throw her under the bus. Dems eating own.
@PoliticalKathy My Sen, Lindsay Graham surprised me. He's known in SC as a RINO &amp; mentee of Sen McCain. I met him doing an interview at the GOP Elephant Dinner in Columbia, SC. He was watching Alan Keyes, whose campaign I was working for do an interview. He said, "I wish I could talk like that."
@PoliticalKathy My Chinese friends call me an egg. I hope this doesn't trigger and offend you. Hope to see you as one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives someday.
@SusanDFinSD @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You'll be eating them after Nov. 6th. And I'll be laughing.
@SusanDFinSD @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You'll all be eating them after Nov. 6th. And I'll be laughing.
@SusanDFinSD You'll be eating them after Nov. 6th. And I'll be laughing.
@Mariofromthebar @TXFMShark @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Present the evidence, in context without editorializing re: VP Pence, please. Thanks for your response.
@shantelle_y @hellionwolf @Impeach__Now @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @ClintonFdn @wikileaks Unfortunately, people here on social media respond to hashtags and trend it. Ok, let's debate!
@wenaboo1214 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Nope, real person. Remember Hillary and Mueller were involved in giving away 20% of our uranium to Putin and the Russian oligarchs.  Real Russian conspiracy.
@jimmykimmel @RealTracyMorgan Book the @realDonaldTrump or @VP on your show.
@jimmykimmel Continue to MAGA and elect Congresspersons who truly represent the American people. Not those who've ruined our economy, cities, engage in identity politics, divide us, obstruct, encourage violence, censor free speech and engage in the politics of destruction.
@jimmykimmel @kanyewest We miss the days of Johnny Carson, when late night was actually funny. Johnny knew how to do political humor. Not the partisan foul-mouthed, ad hominins of Kimmel, @StephenColbert_ @Trevornoah et al. They all used to be funny. Now just political Donkey hacks.
@jimmykimmel you've got a stable of writers &amp; researchers who got Kavanaugh hearing's facts wrong. Judge has already been interviewed by FBI &amp; doesn't corroborate Dr. Ford's account Her lie detector test, only asked 2 questions. No baseline. FBI has checked out Kavanaugh 6 times.
@SarahPalinUSA I'm ashamed of my home state's @SenFeinstein She's a disgrace to the Golden State. Retire the career politician. Make CA Great Again! Oust the crippling Donkeys!
@SarahPalinUSA Paid Soros stooges.
@SarahPalinUSA 15 minutes of fame and financial gain. Used and abused by the Donkeys much like Norma McCovey was used by the feminists and alt-left to get Roe v Wade ruling.
@SarahPalinUSA This is why we need Governor Palin to run for the US Senate.
@SarahPalinUSA You truly need to run for the US Senate to replace the current RINO in order to help @POTUS continue to MAGA! #PalinforUSSenate
@realDonaldTrump I'm ashamed to say that @SenFeinstein is one of the US Senators from my home state. Disgraceful!. Politics of destruction.
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron He seems to have a bro crush and loves to be in the room with a true Alpha Male. Getting on board the Trump Train. MAGA! Make the World Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump Confronting the globalists who want to enslave, control and destroy our national sovereignty.
@realDonaldTrump Great UN speech! My wife listened to it to help her improve her English fluency. Couldn't have done much better myself. I would've told them that we won't abide by Agenda 21 &amp; revoke our membership to the globalist body indefinitely until they cleaned things up.
@darkestbryde @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump If @realDonaldTrump appoints @JaySekulow as new AG and he can get @JudgeJeanine to be the Special Counsel to prosecute all those treasonous criminals. She's itching to do so. Watch her weekly show.
@JMLesq @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Jeana @POTUS is not above the law as is Obama, Hillary, Bill, Rosenstein, McCabe, @Comey , Mueller, Ohr, Nellie, Podesta, Huma, Mills, Lynch, Holder, Wasserman-Schultz, @NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @SenFeinstein Chelsea, @SenSanders et al.
@MargieGallagh11 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Ad hominins do nothing to further your arguments, Ms. Hillary is a master at letting them fly. I thought she went to Yale Law? Didn't she take a course in evidence?

@wenaboo1214 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Evidence admissible in a court of law please. Ad hominins do nothing to support your "argument."
@gayle_native1 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Manafort tax evasion. @GenFlynn lying to FBI, Cohn lying to FBI. Who's flipping?? Clinton pay-for-play (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash), enabling a rapist (Stone. War on Women.) criminal activity in AK (Nicholes "The Clinton Chronicles") Chinagate (Yr of the Rat) racist (D'Sousa doc).
@SenFeinstein Besides faith and ethics, science is on the side of the pro-life movement. Neonatal medicine, ultrasounds &amp; the Harvard Med School criteria for life prove that the baby is a human being in the womb. Planned Parenthood founder, Sanger was a racist, eugenics &amp; spoke at KKK rallies.
@SenFeinstein Read @JohnRLottJr's seminal book, "More Guns, Less Crime." Available used at https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm. A leftist prof spent ten years trying to disprove his analysis. AND HE COULDN'T!
@SenateDems @SenFeinstein @JeffreyToobin Some of the editorializing and the outlandish statements Mr. Toobin makes as CNN's "Legal Analyst" really makes me wonder if he ever went to law school. If so, where?
@SenFeinstein We all know that Professor Hill's allegations were as Justice Thomas stated, "an electronic lynching, because he was an uppity black Conservative" who wouldn't stay in his place and tow the line.
@SenFeinstein Infrastructure problems due to Democratic leadership.
@SenFeinstein WaPo is well known for its inaccuracies and engaging in fake news. Notably star reporter Bob Woodword. After all it's Jeff Bezo's propagandist mouthpiece to support his leftist agenda. Much like William Randolph Hearst.
@SenFeinstein as a Californian I have long been disappointed with your leadership on our behalf in Washington DC. Dems have ruined my state with high taxes, regulations, and expanded welfare entitlements, which has resulted in the Golden State now having the highest poverty rate.
@SenFeinstein He has the character and qualifications to be a @USSupremeCourt Justice as evidenced by ABA rating, service on the 9th Circuit, prior confirmation, law students and 75 female classmates who stated that he was perfect gentleman.
@SenFeinstein #Obstructionists #ConfirmKavanaughNow #RedWave2018 Bye bye Donkeys!
@SenFeinstein Dr. Ford's testimony is full of holes &amp; she presented no conclusive evidence to support her allegations. Patriotic Americans know this is a circus, as Ford perjured herself like bill @BillClinton. Her yearbook shows she's a promiscuous party animal. 2 men havestated they did it.
@SenFeinstein @SenatorDurbin Sen. Feinstein as a fellow Californian I'm disgusted as to your treatment of Mr. Kavanaugh along with your fellow Dems. The unfairness is despicable as you drag this fine jurist through the mud. I agree with @GrahamBlog &amp; his castigation of the committee members. We know better.
George Soros Sends $246 Million to Pro-Abortion Groups Smearing Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/gqZHyST9A9
@hellionwolf @Impeach__Now @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @ClintonFdn @wikileaks Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not a bot. Can't handle the truth?? Engage in debate, facts, logic and critical thinking.
@Impeach__Now @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Name the high crimes and misdemeanors that Congress could include in articles of impeachment and that the House Managers could bring to the US Senate to find him guilty?? Read Coulter's book, "High Crimes and Misdemeanors" available used on https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm
@SuddenlyStephen @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Oh, but I'll have the last laugh. #RedWaveRising2018 #Trump2020Landslide and #MAGA. Doing it everyday! Thankfully HRC didn't win as we'd have more of O's Socialist, Fascist, globalist, establishment nonsense. She did try to steal 5 states (Dem Bev. Harris election fraud expert )
@Mariofromthebar @TXFMShark @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump He does sometime go to church with VP Pence. They constantly pray before WH meetings. Research it. Reagan, became a Christian after the attempted assassination. But he didn't go to church as it was a real hassle for the congregation and @SecretService to secure the location.
@Mariofromthebar @giovannisconst @rhaton13 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Prove that it's propaganda or a false narrative. Make your argument.
@gina_hase @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump So far one convicted for tax evasion, 2 others for lying to the FBI. @realDonaldTrump? No conspiracy, No high crimes &amp; misdemeanors. Name 5 with legal evidence, in context without editorializing that Mueller could use to indict and prosecute?? Absolutely nothing. Face reality!
@giovannisconst Have you read the Stanford study that confirms this? Also @Project_Veritas exposed the fact that Donkeys steal elections. Notable examples: JFK, LBJ and @HillaryClinton stole the nomination from @SenSanders
@Impeach__Now @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump HRC more than 22 scandals plus, pay for play &amp; @ClintonFdn (Schweiter. Clinton Cash.), Bengazhi, e-mails @WikiLeaks. In league with Chinese (Year of the Rat), Dirty dossier paid for from her campaign &amp; DNC (Declassified FISA docs), election fraud (Dem Bev Harris election expert).
@Mariofromthebar @TXFMShark @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump When he cheated he was an immoral man &amp; committed adultery. Not a C at the time. That's a holdover from the Bush &amp; Obama. He's trying to change it. He's a very young Christian, who needs to grow and be discipled in the faith. He is unpredictable, but keeping his promises MAGA!
@AnnEK04 No stats, studies or proof to support your silly claims on the left.
@SusanDFinSD @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Hilarious! #RedWaveRising2018 Greater majorities in both House and Senate. Kavanaugh confirmed. Economy booming! Trump re-elected 2020 MAGA!!
@Amy_Siskind Evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Cosby did it. No eyewitness evidence re: Judge Kavanaugh. 75 female classmates have come out to state that he was a gentleman, bookish and didn't drink in HS. Dems just want to destroy him as he's @POTUS's pick. Legal evidence is key.
@PressSec Keep up the good work! I was one of the first three persons to work on your dad's 2008 presidential bid in Columbia, SC. I remember seeing you cry as he conceded the SC Primary to McCain. I truly believe that if he'd won, @BarackObama wouldn't have become President.
@SusanDFinSD @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Hilarious!. No I'm not a sow boy, beta male, leftist that would need manpons.
@BeverlyDudik @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Ok, Beverly please provide evidence that passes the test for a courtroom, in context without editorializing.
@TXFMShark @Mariofromthebar @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Everybody makes judgements in life. They should be based on evidence. So please enlighten me with at least five examples, Mario of your charges in context without editorializing.
@HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump These are political predictions and facts based on legal evidence. Not necessarily implication of support for Trump. I voted for Darrell Castle of the Constitution Party in 2016.
@Mariofromthebar @giovannisconst @rhaton13 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump HRC is a pathological liar, criminal, mentally unfit, racist (traveling cook),Fascist, Soros puppet, witch (Bill and Larry Nichols), Socialist, mean, foul mouthed, short tempered (aides, Secret Service), enabler of a rapist (Broaddrick), corrupt (Schweizer "Clinton Cash') etc.
@fran13641 @HillaryClinton @Comey @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Absolutely no  evidence that a prosecutor could use to convict @POTUS of high crimes &amp; misdemeanors as required by our Constitution. Read @AnnCoulter's book by the same name. Overwhelming evidence of crimes, conspiracy, treason for Clintons, Obama etc. (FISA docs, @wikileaks etc)
@BobStone3 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @mike_pence I still pray for the Bushes, Clintons and Obamas. I pretty much didn't vote or support them at all. In fact I found their policies to be destructive to our republic. But I am called to pray for them. So you are called to pray for Trump, even if you hate him.
@PoliticalKathy Kathy, hope to serve together with you in the House of Representatives after you reach the age of 25.
@JudicialWatch My fellow Californians in the  43rd Congressional District Vote for Omar Navaro on Nov. 6th to retire corrupt, unethical @RepMaxineWaters
@TomRtweets @dcexaminer Recall Amb. Hailey. Defund the UN indefinitely. Waste of time and money as they encroach on our national sovereignty.

@SenGillibrand #ConfirmKavanaughNow

@SenateDems No eyewitnesses to confirm her story and 65 female classmates state that Judge Kavanaugh was a perfect gentleman, bookish and didn't drink.
@JudgeJeanine @nytimes @realDonaldTrump I'm advocating that AG Sessions be fired and replaced by @JaySekulow, who could appoint you as the Special Prosecutor.
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @mike_pence Romans tells us to pray for those who have authority over us.
@TheDailyShow Dirty dossier, paid for by @HillaryClinton &amp; DNC. Shopped around by @SenJohnMcCain. Only BuzzFeed would touch it. Basis for FISA warrant for @BarackObama et al to spy on @POTUS &amp; his campaign. Real conspiracy to interfere with our electoral process. Docs to be declassified.
@AnnCoulter Sister Ann, how about using BS or Barbara Streisand instead.
@PoliticalKathy Such a young accomplished woman!. Hope we can serve together in Congress in the future.
@MMFlint How about rapist @BillClinton?
@HillaryClinton But are they the best women for our republic? Remember more government, less freedom and less government, more freedom. Thousands of Conservatives, Christians, Libertarians and Constitutionalists are being censored from social media to interfere with our electoral process.
@TexasTribune @tedcruz @BetoORourke @NBCDFW Texans need to vote for the US Senate candidate who best represents their view on policy and values. There is only one person who does so: Senator Ted Cruz. #ReelectedCruz
@jwarnerwallace Go Bruins!. I was a Poet at Whittier College, but I've always supported UCLA over USC. I was a faculty member at the older USC, University of South Carolina.
@jwarnerwallace looks like some great resources to help us contend for the faith. I studied under Dr. John W. Montgomery in the hay day of the Simon Greenleaf School of Law. Many of the profs like Dr. Hazen left to start the BIOLA program. Now I'm a university teacher in E. Asia.
@ilyamerica @SarahKSilverman @hulu Hey Sarah, how about giving a different perspective and interview one of the scientists who wrote a peer-reviewed article proving scientifically that manmade CO2 emissions aren't such a serious problem. (1300 or them) Come on don't be a science denier.
@mattwilstein @SarahKSilverman Check out Professor Ford's HS yearbooks. She was quite the party animal &amp; a slut. Liked  the game of drinking yourself into a comma. She won't testify, because she'll have to perjure herself. Eyewitnesses don't support her story 65 classmates say he was a gentlemen &amp; a nerd.
@MGMcKendrick @SarahKSilverman Talking about @BillClinton and his accomplice @HillaryClinton
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump Most of the Donkeys in my home state are clowns who're destroying the Golden State with regulations &amp; taxes. Why do some Californians want to separate &amp; create another state? You're not our leaders. Remember this policy started under @BarackObama. So where was the outrage then??
I'd like to call upon all my fellow Conservatives, Constitutionalists, Christians, Libertarians and Patriots to vote for the GOP Conservative in your districts. Volunteer, contribute, call talk show radio and write letters to the editor. #RedWaveRising2018
@RepMarkMeadows Would love to see you as the new Speaker of the House. @Jim_Jordan will make a great Speaker also. Keep up the good fight. I'll be starting a letter campaign to various print media across the country supporting GOP Conservatives.
@TomFitton @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JudicialWatch Tom, why didn't you take care of all this nonsense and send  @HillaryClinton &amp; @BillClinton to prison after Larry Klayman left @JudicialWatch to run for the US Senate in FL? It would have saved our republic from all this mess long ago. You blew the chance by your incompetence.
@dash_bandy @LindseyGrahamSC Senator Graham knows very well that as a House Manager during the @BillClinton impeachment proceedings that he wasn't allowed to completely present all the evidence they had before the @SenateFloor I lobbied for the Senators to find @BillClinton guilty (Colter. High Crimes ..)
@CreechJeff @ZoeTillman @POTUS Sorry, @POTUS won't be impeached. Red Wave will sweep the midterms. @realDonaldTrump re-elected in 2020. @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ClintonFdn Podesta bros, @Comey McCabe, Rosenstein, Ohr, Huma, Lynch, @BarackObama et al will all be prosecuted and sent to prison.

@CarisSevern @iminbeastmode @ZoeTillman Typical leftist ad hominin in pics. Much like @HillaryClinton deplorables comment. Attack the @realDonaldTrump supporter and not the arguments. Oh, yeah you don't have any cogent arguments for you side on the alt-left.
@CNN I've seen it effectively used in the school district where I used to teach. Paddling as the final step of discipline. Call parents and tell them they're welcome to come down and administer it. Have a witness sign a form to certify that abuse didn't take place.
@CNN Will eventually go the way of Wolf's, Omarosa's, Hillary's and Stormy's (when it's released). Buy the fictional accounts for laughs at a library sale or at a used bookstore for a buck. That's what I always do.
@washingtonpost Fact checked by discredited groups like Snopes?
@PrisonPlanet Liberal tears by the fake news being called out.
@MMFlint Are you giving out free popcorn to attract an audience to see your pseudo documentary? Just like giving out hotdogs for your stage production which tanked. Everyone needs to watch the documentary, "Manufacturing Dissent."
@Pontifex Victims of pedophilia at the hands of priests in the RC church.
@HillaryClinton @DrLeanaWen Defund Planned Parenthood as they're on the wrong side of medical science. Committing genocide in the black communities. Leftists, Hollywood, MSM, Donkeys, Hillary and her cronies can fund the group.
@foxandfriends @TomiLahren Resident's of CA 43rd to elect a true leader, with real solutions and who lives in the district. @RealOmarNavarro for Congress on November 6th. Check out his website and compare him to Crazy @RepMaxineWaters

@FoxNews Do a story on @BarackObama brother @ObamaMalik releasing his birth certificate that he was born in Kenya. In a recent speech he admitted this. His book agent &amp; even Barry himself revealed this fact. Relatives in Kenya confirm this. Team of experts determined WH released a fake.
@DebraMessing All the stats stats support the contrary. @POTUS is keeping his promises and MAGA! #RedWave2018 and #Trump2020
@MMFlint Everyone knows you're psedo-documentaries are edited to force your agenda. I predict that you're latest film will be as popular as the stage show. You'll have to give out free popcorn to attract an audience. Watch the doc, "Manufacturing Dissent" which exposes Moore as a fraud.

@HouseGOP GOP needs to truly reform our 4 million word and counting tax code and pass the FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKwviH)
@HillaryClinton Neonatal medicine, Harvard Medical School's criteria for life, ultrasounds all prove that there's a human life in the womb that must be protected. We understand that you support abortion on demand due to the many abortions that you've had.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. President you should endorse @RealOmarNavarro to replace Crazy Max in the 43rd District. We need more true Conservatives from the Left Coast.
@benshapiro generally enjoy your commentary on LWC etc. But I would say that you should avoid using the ad hominin logical fallacy so constantly. You know that it's better to  refrain and just attack the argument.
@FoxBusiness MAGA!

@amjoyshow @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Senators Harris and Booker are grandstanding, whining like kids. It's an embarrassment for the US Senate. Kavanaugh will be confirmed despite their temper tantrums. Not a good way to start on the road to the @WhiteHouse
@SenSanders Sen, HRC stole the nomination from you. No conclusive evidence of voter suppression. Solid evidence by Dem. Bev Harris, election fraud expert that @HillaryClinton stole at least 5 states from @POTUS in the general. Sanford study &amp;  @Project_Veritas confirm Dems engaged in fraud.
@NPR @NPRrelving Bob's book, like Wolf's and Omarosa's books will crash and burn after a week or so. Futile attempt to bring down @POTUS
@WashTimes A study in Britain and Sweden demonstrated that after they legalized abortion, the back alley abortions went up. Neonatal medicine, ultrasounds, and Harvard Medical School's criteria for life proves that there's a human life in the mother's womb.
@BillKristol Never-Trumper, Neocon Bill spouting off nonsense. Wasn't your father a Trotskyite? I've lost total respect for you and your rag.
@SenTedCruz Senator Cruz you need to run your campaign without the hampering of the establishment Bushies et al. Texans want to see the Ted who filibustered Obamacare and read "Green Eggs &amp; Ham." You probably lost the GOP nomination as you allowed neocon Bush types to run your campaign.
@JudicialWatch Under Larry Klayman's leadership we would have dealt with this mess yrs ago. @TomFitton squandered the chance &amp; didn't hire Rep. Bob Barr as lead counsel to prosecute @BillClinton @HillaryClinton and all their cronies. Now we're paying the price. Finally, #LockThemUp! #LexRex!
@realDonaldTrump according to Dr. Pieozenik there's a coup afoot. Amb Bolton &amp; NYT involved. Fire neocon Bolton, replace with Dr. @SebGorka. Fire neocon Amb. Hailey, replace with Amb. ALan Keyes. Defund for 1 yr. Fire AG Sessions, replace with @JaySekulow or @JudgeJeanine
@dcexaminer My former governor neocon @nikkihaley has got to go. Let's defund the UN for at least a year.
@PoliticalKathy This is the last straw and we've all got to resist. Alex has been warning us about this for awhile. Post on Real Video like Inforwars is now doing so.
@KamalaHarris #KavanaughConfirmation
@KamalaHarris Then get your staff to shift through the millions of documents he submitted. You don't like that he's a judge who'll look at the original words like our Founders intended. Interpret rather the usurp the Constitutional powers of the legislator.
@HillaryClinton 1,300 scientific peer-reviewed papers by: climatologists, oceanographers, environmental scientists, atmospheric scientists, meteorologists  etc raise serious doubts as the seriousness of climate change caused by manmade CO2. Founders of the Weather Channel &amp; Greenpeace concur.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. @POTUS Thanks for MAGA each and every day. Need to declassify the documents and have DOJ prosecute @HillaryClinton and all her cronies. #LockHerUp We Americans demand justice! Lex Rex!
@dcexaminer @BecketAdams Time to #LockHimUp Lex Rex!
@HillaryClinton When is are you going to prison along with all your conspiring cronies for crimes and treason. #LockHerUp Americans demand justice! #LexRex.
@MMFlint I'd wager that this psedo-documentary will do as well your show on stage. You'll probably have to give away popcorn to attract theater goers. Watch the excellent documentary, "Manufacturing Dissent." about Mr. Moore.
@KamalaHarris Give it up  @SenKamalaHarris as the highly qualified, Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed. He will do his Constitutional job as a @USSupremeCourt Justice and interpret the Constitution, rather than legislate from the bench.
@PoliticalKathy @LauraLoomer I'm sure he showed it out of context and repeated the long refuted references MSM and other far-left lunatics cite to discredit Mr. Jones.
@Joy_Villa I tweeted some time ago that you should run for Congress. I've some concern that you're an active member of the Scientology cult. From the @infowars interview I thought that you're a Christ follower. LIke Gov. Romney re: Mormonism you must disclose this fact to voters.
@loy593 @realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton is a well documented sexual predator and rapist. Time for him to pay for his crimes and be locked up!
@Corinne4Hillary @realDonaldTrump Long  past the time for Hillary and her cronies to be prosecuted and sent to prison. The list of crimes and treasonous acts are many. @wikileaks, @JudicialWatch along with eyewitness accounts documented in a number of books &amp; documentaries. eg. "Clinton Cash" provide the proof.
@realDonaldTrump When will the DOJ prosecute, HRC, Obama, Bill, Comey, Mueller, Huma, Podesta brothers, Orh, Rosenstein. Lynch, Brennan et al for various crimes and treason?? We Americans demand justice! Lex Rex!
@KrisJenner How is your faith in Jesus reflected in your everyday life? How about your reality show with your girls?
@HillaryClinton You're the one along with your cronies who have conspired with the Russians. Pay-for-pay as Secretary of State, Clinton Foundation (Schweizer. Clinton Cash.) and Uranium I ring a bell? Time to go to prison. #LockHerUp!! Lex Rex!
@antbarberio1 Being a sexual predator, Bubba @BillClinton looks like he wants to rape the singer. His wife @HillaryClinton, known lesbian would love to do the same.
@realDonaldTrump @carlbernstein No one believes the fake news, false narratives, outright lies, conspiracy theories of the MSM. Notable examples, CNN and @MSNBC  Watch @FoxNews and @infowars for the real news.
Arizonians need to get out and vote for Sheriff Joe for US Senate.
Despite the deep state, Donkeys, leftists, academia, MSM, Hollywood, Socialists, Communists, establishment, RINOs, neo-cons, Never-Trumpers, oligarchs, technocrats, military industrial complex, and  globalists all trying to bring down our President;  he's still able to MAGA
@RepMarkMeadows We need Representative Meadows to be the new Speaker of the House. A True Patriot, Constitutionalist, Conservative and Citizen lawmaker.
@GreggJarrett Everyone should read Gregg's book and then lobby all our elected officials to get our judicial system to #LockThemAllUp Lex Rex!!
@GreggJarrett Read the book and lobby our judicial system to #LockThemAllUp!
@GreggJarrett Read the book and lobby all our elected officials to #LOCKTHEMALLUP!
Rep. Jordan I'd like to challenge you along with in Congress, to pass the FairTax to grow our economy even more, eliminate the tyrannical IRS, give us the freedom to spend our hard earned money, save Medicare, Social Security, ,deal with illegal immigration amongst other issues.
@realDonaldTrump The military are enlightened and thoroughly support the President, so they will protect him from the establishment elites who attempt to bring @POTUS down.
@Acosta Mr. Accosta unlike the Fascist alt left that you represent, there have been no calls for violence against the MSM also known as fake news &amp; in your network's case, Clinton News Network. If you're fearful for your personal safety then secure a way to protect yourself. Man up!!
@brianstelter CNN joins the Fascist social media as they violate the 1st Amendment rights of true Conservatives, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and Independents. Huge backlash from freedom loving and patriotic Americans. #ProtectConstitutionalFreedomsfromtheFascists.
@herstinkyhippie @SarahPalinUSA When I was a young lad we did. But Socialism, Islam, atheism, political correctness, postmodernism, relativism and Fascism have replaced what's taught in our public schools now.
@herstinkyhippie @SarahPalinUSA I taught a Citizenship class to legal immigrants and we systematically went through the Constitution line by line
@SarahPalinUSA Politicians, Dems, progressives, academia, MSM and Hollywood generally have no idea re: our history, culture, legal system, the Constitution and other founding documents.
@amjoyshow @NBCNews There's no blue wave. As POTUS's successes are taunted by GOP, we'll see greater gains in both House and Senate!!
@RepSanfordSC Tariffs are the only type of tax allowed by our Constitution, unlike the Federal Income tax (https://t.co/1fUVwKeUr9). They make the trade of American goods fair and competitive. The US is the only country that has little to no tariffs on goods.
@davidhogg111 Correction. Dems, progressives, alt left, Socialists, Communists, globalists, RINOs, establishment, technocrats and oligarchs LOSE!!
@davidhogg111 Political reality is that @POTUS is MAGA. Donkeys will lose midterms &amp; true Conservatives, Libertarians, Patriots, Constitutionalists will take over Congress. Absolutely no blue wave!! Establishment, Socialists, progressives, globalists, technocrats, oligarchs WIN!
@HillaryClinton You've secretly met with Putin. Everything that you and your cronies accuse @POTUS of doing, has been done by y'all. It's long past for you to spend time cooling your heals in prison. #LOCKHERUP
@senorrinhatch @SenJohnMcCain @SenPatRoberts @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander @JohnBoozman @SenDeanHeller @SenCoryGardner @SenatorLankford @BillCassidy I call upon the Senators to  improve our economy to a greater extent and truly reform our Federal taxation system by passing the FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKwviH)
@MiaFarrow @PressSec @POTUS How about 15 lies, in context without editorializing?
@PressSec @POTUS Of course they are a private business and have the right to refuse service. But I'm sure that establishments run by Conservatives wouldn't discriminate according to their workplace and political beliefs.
@davidhogg111 How about not being a hypocrite &amp; invoking the Scriptures to fit your false narratives. Stop with the profanity laced rantings re: anyone who disagrees &amp; attempting to deny them their Constitutional rights of speech &amp; press. Claiming that you all are children is disingenuous.
@davidhogg111 Yes, give us reliable, stats,  facts &amp; evidence to make your case. I thought that you're a great researcher &amp; debater? Then debate Rex Jones! Read @JohnRLottJr's books, "More Guns, Less Crime,"  "Gun Bias." Available used and in good condition from https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm.
@davidhogg111 Hitler youth type Fascist attempts to restrict the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and press. Haven't you studied the US Constitution and taken your required US Government course??
@JordanUhl @davidhogg111 @Bayer @LibertyMutual @Nutrisystem @ChoiceHotels @JennyCraig @Arbys @carsdotcom @Carvana @DIRECTV @Duracell @esurance @JosABank @Honda @IBM @KAYAK @LQ @LincolnMotorCo @mmfa Hitler youth type Fascist attempts to suppress @IngrahamAngle's Constitutional rights of speech and press. #STOPFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 I guess your gun grabbing Fascist friends with millions of dollars are organizing these events. 10% young people at the March with the rest being adults. They could care less about the kids and school safety as they're only concerned about power and retaking Congress.
@RonWyden @davidhogg111 @NRA How about calling for the prosecution of @ClintonFdn regarding pay for play?? (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.)
@RonWyden @davidhogg111 @NRA Fascist witch hunt.
@nowthisnews @davidhogg111 Bullying?? How about Hogg's profanity laced calls for the violation of freedom of speech &amp; press? Pure Hitler youth type Fascism. David's a public figure now, who's open to criticism. Engage in the debate with facts and evidence! Read @JohnRLottJr's book, "More Guns, Less Crime."
@davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle Ms. Ingraham tells the truth unlike the fake news of your buddies at CNN &amp; other MSM outlets. Why don't you present evidence &amp; facts regarding gun control. Aren't you a great researcher and debater?? Debate Rex Jones! Read @JohnRLottJr 's "More Guns, Less Crime" &amp; "Gun Bias."
@delaneytarr @davidhogg111 #STOPFascistGunGrabbers
@Blackbird_write @davidhogg111 @s0ntdesm0tsqui @AHamiltonSpirit @hulu @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @Bayer @RocketMortgage @LibertyMutual @Arbys @TripAdvisor @Nestle @Wayfair Blackbird can't cite 20 examples, in context without editorializing regarding the libelous and slanderous remarks regarding @IngrahamAngle  You shouldn't engage in ad hominims without evidence that would be admissible in a court of law.
@davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle The whining boy, Hogg wants to deprive Laura Ingraham of her freedom of speech and press. He's truly a Hitler youth. Americans see through your scam as a little boy puppet of the gun grabbing Fascists. #STOPGunGrabbingFascists
@davidhogg111 They must be on the side of truth &amp; history. You sadly, young man are not. Your plans will surely backfire as the Donkey's go the way of the Whigs. True Conservatives, Patriots, Libertarians, Constitutionalists &amp;  Populists will be elected during the midterms. Just keep it up.
@davidhogg111 Hogg you play fast and fancy free with the facts. Reliable sources please? Stop the lies and your Fascist attempts to deprive Americans of their 1st and 2nd Amendment Constitutional Rights. Haven't you taken US Government class??
@davidhogg111 @Ryan_Deitsch #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@MuslimIQ @davidhogg111 Also how about the students who represent a Conservative perspective from the  Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School? They've been meeting with lawmakers to get a law passed. What have the gun grabbing Fascist puppets Hogg and his gang done, but to divide our republic??
@davidhogg111 It's quite clear that you're a Fascist from the various pictures posted looking like a Hitler youth. Your profanity laced calls for suppressing free speech is a hallmark of the ideology. How about being a man and debate Rex Jones??
@FoxNews Read @JohnRLottJr seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." All available at https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm.
@FroggyBottomPnd @tedcruz Senator Cruz is a good sport and even poses for pics with those who disagree and oppose him. He allows them to exercise their 1st Amendment rights unlike the Fascist progressive Donkeys.
@foxandfriends Biden's a thug who loves getting grabby with little girls. Secret Service agent compared him to Harvey Weinstein. AG Sessions had to swat his hand away when he went for his granddaughter at his swearing in. Check out the endless videos.
@ananavarro Ana, while these misinformed and useful idiots of the Fascist gun grabbers protested, David Hogg's Conservative classmates have already lobbied Congress and have gotten a bipartisan bill passed. Ignored by MSM as it doesn't fit their fake news and false narratives.
@rachelrose094 Misinformed &amp; useful idiot of the Fascist gun grabbers. Read Dr. @JohnRLottJr's books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." NRA offered a plan to Obama to protect our kids. He refused as his Ideology comes before the students. Some schools are implementing the program anyways.
@RepAdamSchiff Waste of time and Hollywood's money. Conservative students from Parkland, lobbied Congress and actually got a bill passed to address the issue. Where were you Rep. Schiff??
@CBSNews The Conservative and sensible students at Stoneman Douglas High School lobbied Congress and got a bill passed that will actually address the issue. Hogg and his ilk are just protesting, boycotting, making the media rounds and not affecting public policy in any way.
@CNNPolitics The Parkland children and their "adult" supporters are misinformed, useful idiots for the Fascist gun grabbers. Remember what Hitler did to the German people?
@JohnRLottJr Everyone needs to read Dr. John Lott's seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime," and "Gun Bias." Available from https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm.
@KyleKashuv Media darling &amp; hero of the Fascist gun grabbers. Remember what Hitler did to the German people? While Hogg was hogging (pun intended) the limelight, his Conservative, sensible Parkland classmates lobbied Congress to pass a bill that will actually do something to solve the issue.
@KamalaHarris My fellow Californians it's time to drain the left coast of swamp creatures like Kamala and Diane. We deserve better representation in DC to truly MAGA. Enough of the failed policies of the Donkeys, Republicrats and the obstructionist DC establishment!!
@RepWilson #DrainTheSwamp and #OustFrederica
@JoyAnnReid Oh, Joy is this the only platform you have now to spout your ridiculous assessments of the political landscape. I guess so, since your show got cancelled. Nobody cares about what you and others in the MSM have to say anymore. Bye bye.
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Oust the establishment, Donkeys, Republicrats, globalist obstructionists like Ryan, McConnell, McCain, Pelosi, Waters, Schumer, Durbin, Graham, Wasserman-Schultz, Snowe, Bernie, Warren, Feinstein, Harris and all the other swamp creatures in the next election cycle!!
@MMFlint Meanwhile Parkland's Conservative and sensible students have lobbied Congress to actually get a law passed dealing with the issue. These other children and their "adult" supporters are misinformed,  and useful idiots for the gun grabbing Fascists. Hitler did the same thing.
@SarahPalinUSA Run Sarah Run for US Senate. The nation needs you to help @POTUS MAGA!
@TheLastWord Check out the videos and what a Secret Service agent has confirmed that VP Biden gets creepy and grabby with little girls. AG Sessions had to swat his hand away his when he went after his granddaughter. Joe can never be president.
@TheLastWord While Hogg and his fellow drama club members traipse around doing interviews, protest &amp; call for boycotts, sensible Conservative classmates have lobbied Congress to get them to pass a law dealing with the issue. Hogg like to hog (pun intended) the limelight. Misinformed boy.
@HillaryClinton Only a matter of time before Hillary, Bill, Huma, Podesta brothers, Brazile, Chelsea, Mook, Wasserman-Shultz, Comey, Mueller, Obama, Ohr, Lynch, Rosenstein, McCabe et al go to prison for all their criminal &amp; treasonous acts. Send them all to prison! Americans demand it! Lex Rex!
@dcexaminer Amy is ignorant of the gun control issue. Read my SD Union-Tribune Letter &amp;  Dr.@JohnRLottJr's "More Guns, Less Crime." NRA offered Obama a plan to keep our kids safe. He rejected it. Ideology over the lives of our children. Some schools have decided to employ the plan anyways.
@nytimes Join the movement  in defending free speech, #DeleteFacebook
@LucyForLiberty @FreeBeacon Congress should take a pay cut for their terrible performance. Oust the Donkeys and Republicrat, establishment globalists in 2018!
@WashTimes @LarryOConnor Neocon @BillKristol I've totally lost respect for Mr. Kristol.
@trooper2121 @LucyForLiberty Hypocritical Hollywood. Disarm your security!
@PoliticalShort Lock Him Up! He's a criminal. Lex Rex!
@TheLastWord @Lawrence Waste of time and Hollywood's money. Conservative students from Parkland HS have already lobbied to get a bill passed. Hogg and his band of useful idiots for the gun grabbers have done nothing to affect public policy. Just foul-mouthed publicity hogs (pun intended). Bullied self.
@TeaPartyOrg The good people of Speaker Ryan's district need to oust this swamp creature in 2018!
@SarahPalinUSA Palin for Senate
@JudicialWatch Lock Her Up!
@usblm Don't you know that he's been lawyering up due to his illegal wiretapping of candidate Trump? Check it out for yourself.
@RealSaavedra @davidhogg111 Read Dr. @JohnRLottJr books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias" for empirical evidence that gun grabbers are wrong. Available at https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm, used and in good condition.
@AC360 Do nothing, millennial who craves publicity and is having no affect on public policy, unlike Conservative Parkland students. Anderson Cooper and CCN along with other MSM enable the boy.
@ABC Hogg's doing nothing of substance to affect policy. Conservative kids from Parkland are getting it done. MSM ignores them as it doesn't fit their false narratives and fake news.
@BryanDawsonUSA @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 Conservative kids from Parkland are lobbying and getting it down. Bipartisan law passed. March for Our Lives does nothing to affect policy. Waste of time and money of Hollywood leftists.
@axios Profanity laced interview. His interview is removed from Twitter for bullying. Therefore, Hogg is bullying himself. Irrational progressives.
@axios Hogg needs to provide evidence for his libelous statements. Reporters need to challenge him on it. But they're infatuated with him. Gun grabbers are using him to further their agenda. Interview Dr. @JohnRLottJr
@Newsweek Did Hogg take a US Government class? It's required of Seniors and I used to teach it. He's ignorant of our founding documents and it's history. Chalk it up to kids of his generation &amp; poor public schools. Argument for vouchers, charter, private, home schooling &amp; virtual schools.
@RealAlexJones Exactly, so why doesn't he go after himself??
@IngrahamAngle Your video was deleted for violating Twitter standards. It was just their darling, Hogg being interviewed. He is an foul-mouthed inarticulate boy, who prides himself on his debate and researching skills. But doesn't offer evidence, studies or stats to prove his contention.
@LevineJonathan Conceal and carry by trained private citizens will prevent kids from being murdered. Eg. most recent school shooting. NRA offered a plan to do so. Obama refused. Ideology over the kids.
@PrisonPlanet All Americans should read Dr. @JohnRLottJr's books, "More Guns, Less Crime," and "Gun Bias." Available on https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm, used and in good condition.
@RealSaavedra Conservative Parkland students are actually doing something &amp; getting laws passed. Hogg and his ilk are just protesting, organizing boycotts, commenting on issues in which they have no expertise, &amp; making the MSM rounds. Interviews are filled with libelous statements &amp; swearing.
david hogg You talk about researching skills, so check out the Berkley U study about frogs. Be a man debate @RealAlexJones. Why aren't Conservative Parkland students talking about the shooting on MSM? You don't represent them. They're getting laws passed. You just want fame.
@PoliticalKathy When I taught at the University of South Carolina my 1st Amendment rights, academic freedom and the Carolina Creed were violated. I complained to the Vice-Provost and university president. Also I tried filling a legal suit against my boss and the university.
@PoliticalKathy Rapist.
@UberFacts @PoliticalKathy Jay Leno's old "Jay Walking" segment and @MarkDice's CA on the street petitions and interviews prove how Americans' background knowledge has so greatly diminished since I was a kid.
@KamVTV @PoliticalKathy @JoyAnnReid @NRA Joy's show got cancelled. She makes some of the most outrageous statements, no wonder.
@PoliticalKathy They believe that the world was created by a dinosaur throwing an atomic bomb in a volcano. L Ron Hubbard famously said that, "if you want to make money, start a religion."
@PoliticalKathy I think I've got a letter from Barry, when I lobbied against one of many failed Fascist Socialist policies.
@PoliticalKathy My account got disabled for Conservative and Christian comments.
@charliekirk11 @PoliticalKathy Mike @MMFlint in his "documentary" Sicko thinks they have the best healthcare system in the world, but he doesn't go there for his medical needs. Hypocrite!
@JackPosobiec @PoliticalKathy Racist Margaret Sanger's group has contributed to the American holocaust and has destroyed the black community.
@PoliticalKathy Shangdi Zhufu ni. Happy New Year of the Dog.
@PoliticalKathy MSM in US, PRC, Europe and many other countries push the false narratives.
@MikeTokes @PoliticalKathy @AndrewSarega @TheStelian @RealOmarNavarro @AntonioSabatoJr @AjaforCongress @PatriotNotPol My fellow Californians need to get out the vote for these candidates. Drain the Swamp!
@just8anapple @PoliticalKathy 12 students were killed by a knife at a school in China.
@OliverMcGee @PoliticalKathy When are Crooked Hillary, Bubba, Barry, Huma, Comey, McCabe, Podesta bros, Rosenstein, Chelsea, Brennan, Rice, Mills, Lynch, Clapper, Mook, Brazille, Wasserman-Schultz, McCain et al going to prison??
@PoliticalKathy @RealAlexJones Strange. Possible hacking? Oversight? What I've seen here on your Twitter account is that you're a True Conservative, Patriot and retweet Paul Joseph Watson and others on the various @infowars shows.
@JimmyHall3 @PoliticalKathy Donkeys and MSM are clueless re: firearms.
@SarahofSyracuse @PoliticalKathy @StefanMolyneux @REALunBEARables @OwenBenjamin Dr. @JohnRLottJr 's books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias" are must reads!
@PoliticalKathy More young people need to work as campaign volunteers. I worked on Ambassador Keyes and Gov. Huckabee's presidential bids. Sen. Jim DeMint's campaign and two gubernatorial and Congressional campaigns in SC.
@PoliticalKathy From the great Mark Dice's store.
@PoliticalKathy Absolutely needed. IDs required to buy alcohol, travel on an airplane, enter R-rated movies, use of credit card at some stores etc.
@LauraLoomer @PoliticalKathy Why is @HillaryClinton falling sensitive? Further proof that she's ill fit to hold public office. Also long naps, stools needed at events, EMT at campaign stops, seizure, special glasses, falling at 9-11 event, Secret Service agent testimonies, reduced campaign schedule etc.
@TomiLahren @PoliticalKathy Voice of reason in my home state of CA. Keep up the good work. Consider running for public office.
@PoliticalKathy #RecountPA18
@realDonaldTrump @PoliticalKathy I'm watching my home state of CA being run into the ground by the Donkeys. Many companies, organizations and folks like myself have fled the Golden State. I support the New California movement.
@realDonaldTrump @PoliticalKathy NRA offered comprehensive plan to protect our schools. Some are adopting it. Obama refused their help. Ideology over the safety of our kids.
@PoliticalKathy @POTUS Excellent!
@PoliticalKathy #RecountPA
@MikeTokes @PoliticalKathy @GOPChairwoman @GOP Drain the Swamp of the establishment Republicrats like Speaker Ryan, Sen. McCain, Sen. Snowe, Sen. Collins, Majority Leader McConnell, my US Senator Lindsay Graham et al.
@RealRedElephant @PoliticalKathy Fascist, authoritarian violation of the 1st Amendment. Young man should sue the principal for violating his Constitutional rights. Contact @ACLJ
@PoliticalKathy I saw the article on @infowars about Instagram removing your pic. So I went to your Twitter and started following you. Consider running for public office in the future. I plan to run for School Board, SC Senate and Congress in the future. Keep up the good work.
@ananavarro you use the word racist so often that it's void of meaning. We're all racist to some extent. I've experienced it in the black &amp; Korean communities. Stop the ad hominems &amp; attack the arguments. Give us 20 examples of Trump's racism, in context, without editorializing.
@KatyTurNBC @HillaryClinton routinely attended witches covens in CA (Larry Nichols) a racist (traveling chef), foul-mouthed and mean (staff, aides, Secret Service, State Troopers) a corrupt criminal (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.) besides all the unbiblical policies she supports.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @JeffFlake Sen. Flake is a political coward. He can run off his mouth with no consequences like Sen. Corker. Why not run for re-election and continue working with the Republicrat and Donkeys in obstructing @POTUS?? Because you'll lose! #DraintheSwamp
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @SenWarren Excellent she couldn't win and I think the gentleman in prison could beat her in the Senate race. #SendWarrenbacktoPRMA
@BernieSanders @chucktodd Why not buy a stake in the team as you're a multimillionaire? "Populist" sellout and crony-capitalist.
@chucktodd you and the MSM swear all the time. You need to chill. Review your 5th grade English class re: hyperbole, metaphors etc. Also watch the hilarious video, "The Art of the Insult." You could have the filmmaker on your show. @AnnCoulter to give you an English lesson.
@BillClinton Millions of Americans are thankful that your crooked wife lost the election. A great day for our republic to elect a man who's MAGA!
@BillClinton @HillaryClinton Obama, Hillary, DNC, FBI, Soros and others all illegally tried to subvert our electoral process. WikiLeaks showed that Sec. Clinton stole the nomination from Senator Sanders.
@BillClinton Hope you didn't rape any of these girls.
@HillaryClinton @BillClinton Ms. Clinton your comments are laughable as you subverted the Constitution, committed crimes from your days in AR to the present, and treason. Hillary for Prison in 2018!. President Trump promised. Lex Rex!
@BillClinton @ClintonGlobal @HarborSchool I bet you wanted to sexually assault this girl.
@BillClinton Hope you exercise self-control and don't  rape these girls in your program.
@BillClinton @HillaryClinton Crocked Hillary when will you and Bill be going to prison for all your crimes and treason? Americans demand that justice be done and  you and all your cronies cool your heels in a prison cell for the rest of your lives. Lex Rex!
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton Never give to the Clinton Foundation as it's a corrupt organization run by crony-capitalists. Give to reputable groups like Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse or Salvation Army.
@BillClinton @BarackObama Barry is a little younger than me and I would be a far superior president with more administrative experience.
@BillClinton Really? Donkeys are the  party of racism, KKK, eugenics (racist founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger), LBJ, enslaving minorities in the inner city with welfare Andy Jackson, race baiters etc. (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.)
@BillClinton @StephenAtHome Future President, sex addict, crony-capitalist, sexual predator, corrupt criminal and rapist.
@BillClinton How about Mena airport? How about the coke and toga parties you attended while governor? Your admittance to a Little Rock hospital for snorting the nose blow too much? (Larry Nichols and Dick Morris)
@BillClinton NRA offered a comprehensive plan to keep our kids safe, but Obama refused. Ideology over the kids.
@BillClinton Like CNN? The Clinton News Network.
@BillClinton Sorry if you're triggered Mr. President, but it's a well known fact that your corrupt foundation is used for your own greedy crony-capitalistic purposes. You bilked the Haitians out of millions. Why should we believe anything you or Hillary say?  We all know that y'all are liars!
@BillClinton Do you allow your urges as a rapist and sexual predator to go after some of the young female scholars like Monica?
@BillClinton Will you get some virgins in the Virgin Islands??
@BillClinton Obama, his FBI, Sheriff Israel and his department have the blood of those students &amp; teachers on their hands. Despite their criminal negligence, some teachers, administrators and staff had training, permit to conceal &amp; carry firearm they could have minimized the deaths.
@BillClinton Your policies ruined that country.
@BillClinton President Clinton you should have accepted the message that Dr. Graham preached so faithfully. Repent, trust Christ and make HIM Master of your life. Nixon did so at the end of his life.
@BillClinton Wonder why you didn't help the kids in Haiti? They hate you for bilking them as a crony-capitalist. Your foundation is a scam to line your pockets. Hillary used the State Dept. in a pay-for-play manner (Schweiter. Clinton Cash.) It's time for y'all to go to prison.
@jimmykimmel Why not patronize a gay baker, instead of forcing Christians to violate their beliefs and the !st Amendment? Then they are fined and go bankrupt. Interference with commerce.
@jimmykimmel @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump The artist did another painting of a black woman holding the severed head of a white woman. Racist and promoting violence against whites. He also likes spreading sperm on this work. Any on Barak's??
@jimmykimmel @WKCDOGS It's the Year of the Dog in China. Xin Nian Kuaile, gou.
@JasonKander @jimmykimmel @NRA NRA offered a comprehensive plan to keep our  kids safe without costing taxpayers a cent. @BarackObama refused. Ideology over the kids. Barak, his FBI, Sheriff Israel and his department have the blood of the Parkland students and teachers on their hands. Not the NRA or Trump.
@tedlieu @jimmykimmel @SpeakerRyan Read researcher, academic and stats expert @JohnRLottJr's seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias," before passing fascist gun grabber legislation like Hitler and Stalin did.
@jimmykimmel @CNN How about allowing other Parkland students, who are against gun control to voice their opinions?? No the MSM won't do so as it doesn't fit their fascist gun grabber false narratives. Read @JohnRLottJr's seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias."
@jimmykimmel @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney Big mistake, as Gov. Romney's a liberal, establishment, Republicrat, Never Trumper, 2 time loser, flip flopper, and he gave us the template for Obamacare.
@jimmykimmel @Oprah @realDonaldTrump Oprah won't become @POTUS as she has too much baggage. Tonguing Harvey's ear, not condemning him. Sexual scandals @ her elitist S African girls school. Endorsement of New Age book, "The Secret." Giving us @BarackObama Supporting depopulation with Gates, Turner Bloomberg et al.
@jimmykimmel Hilarious.
@jimmykimmel @realDonaldTrump Read @JohnRLottJr 's seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." A leftist academic tried to debunk his analysis over 10 yrs and COULDN'T! Jimmy you should have him on your show.
@jimmykimmel Cute. Used to like "Sesame Street" until they had to go politically correct.
@jimmykimmel @armiehammer @chadwickboseman @salmahayek @Lupita_Nyongo More political rantings like Kimmel's late night talk show. Oscar used to watch @MSNBC &amp; CNN, but got tired of all the fake news. So he switched to FOX News and alternative media.
@jimmykimmel @TheAcademy @ABCNetwork Forgot to say that Oscar holds a Crusader's sword. Wouldn't this be like a firearm? Some Muslims have killed people with this type of weapon. ISIS has beheaded people, like Obama's portrait artist did in a painting. Why not go off on gun control, using alt left talking points?
@davidhogg111 @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Lobby your Congresspersons to support and implement the comprehensive NRA plan to protect our kids in the public schools at no cost to the taxpayer.
@davidhogg111 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @VP Support the NRA's comprehensive plan to protect our kids in the public schools at no cost to the taxpayer.

@BegorFlynn @davidhogg111 Get educated and enlightened by reading Dr. @JohnRLottJr's book, "More Guns, Less Crime." Support the NRA's plan to protect our kids in the public schools at no cost to the taxpayer.
@PatriotJane2 @davidhogg111 Yes vote and oust the Republicrats, establishment, Donkeys, elites in Congress.
@GiselaPerezTV @davidhogg111 @cameron_kasky @Emma4Change @delaneytarr @CBSThisMorning @adrianasdiaz @CBSNews @CBSEveningNews Where's the kids from your school that represent a pro Constitution and Conservative perspective?? MSM squelching free speech and anything that challenges their false narrative and fake news.
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Obama, his FBI, Sheriff Israel, his department and big pharma have the blood of your classmates and teachers on their hands. Not the NRA or Trump. Wake up David!
@davidhogg111 Why not let the NRA to implement it's plan to stop the slaughter at no cost to the taxpayer?? I think you prefer political ideology over the kids.
@sarahchad_ @davidhogg111 Better slogan: #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 I thought that David was so well-spoken and articulate that he didn't have to result to ad hominims and profanity. No evidence, logic, unedited clips or facts to support his claims. Not a good spokesperson for the cause.
@cameron_kasky @davidhogg111 These kids are ill-informed &amp; idealistic. They've been indoctrinated by lots of Fascist Socialist teachers. Hogg prides himself as a debater and researcher, yet presents no facts, unedited clips, or concrete evidence to support his positions. He's scared to debate @RealAlexJones
@CNN @davidhogg111 CNN winner of the People's Choice Fake News Network award for 2018. Congrats!
@davidhogg111 @marcorubio Misspelled "insane." Hey, David how about using some basic research skills you should have learned in elementary school.
@davidhogg111 @marcorubio False narrative and fake news. I thought you did your research David. Didn't you get taught in the public schools how to do research and look at a variety of sources??
@Alyssa_Milano @davidhogg111 #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@MichaelSkolnik @davidhogg111 But if someone besides a teacher had a concealed weapon at these various shootings would have stopped the killings. Use some logic, please.
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump They offered Obama a plan to protect our kids and schools, but he refused. Didn't fit the narrative of his Fascist Socialist policies.
@SunSentinel @davidhogg111 @DonaldJTrumpJr You and the "South Florida Sun Sentinel" are spreading fake news. Read the tweets. @DonaldJTrumpJr  never stated that you're a crisis actor. Same with @RealAlexJones. Otherwise prove it or stop the libelous remarks. #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 @FLGovScott Fake poll. Floridians will rally around Governor Scott as he's got widespread support throughout the state. The Children's Crusade will have little to no effect. #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 David, stop with the false narratives and fake news. Do your research. Read Dr. @JohnRLottJr books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." You state that you look at both sides and pride yourself as a debater and researcher.
@davidhogg111 American will patronize these companies even more. Your boycotts are a failure. Enlightened Americans see through your Fascist gun grabbing and squelching 1st Amendment rights agenda. #StopFascistGunGrabbers

@davidhogg111 @TrueCar #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 NRA offered a comprehensive plan to protect our kids in the public school system. Former WH occupant @BarackObama refused. He put his political ideology ahead of our kids, abreacting  his Constitutional role to protect the citizens of our republic.
@davidhogg111 Supporters: Classical Liberals, Founding Fathers, Libertarians, Patriots, Conservatives, Christians, GOP and Populists. Oppose? Donkeys, leftists, Communists, Socialists, MSM, Hollywood, Republicrats, establishment, elites, ill informed young people and Fascists.
@amjoyshow @davidhogg111 Fake new and false narrative Joy. No wonder your show got cancelled. Do your research.
@davidhogg111 Floridians elect Governor Scott to the US Senate. Mr. Hogg is ill informed &amp; didn't show up at the CNN rehearsed Town Hall. A Parkland student stated in an interview that a producer edited his question to fit their Fascist gun grabbing narrative. No opposing views allowed.

@kharyp @davidhogg111 They need to give equal time to researcher and academic, Dr. @JohnRLottJr to discuss the issue of gun control.
@neiltyson @davidhogg111 Prayer changes hearts and minds. Coming to trust and follow Jesus, transforms a person. God's removal from the public school system as research demonstrates has led to greater violence. Dr. Tyson do the research.
@RVAwonk @davidhogg111 Read Dr. @JohnRLottJr seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." A leftist academic tried to prove his statistical analysis was wrong over a period of 10 years and couldn't.
@davidhogg111 @KyleJeter NRA offered a plan to stop the violence in our schools. Obama refused. Contrary to his Fascist Socialist plan to radically transform America. Now @realDonaldTrump has to clean up his mess.

@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Blood is on the hands of Sheriff Israel, his department, big pharma, Obama and his FBI. Do the research.
@davidhogg111 Waiting to see you on Alex's program. But you're scared like a little boy. He'd mop the floor with you. My students in my Debate class could do the same &amp; English is their 2nd language. Come on your in the big boy, adult world now, so step up to the plate &amp; defend your position.
@davidhogg111 Nope, do your research Dave. Aren't you a great debater and researcher? Go on his show for a debate! Or are you a coward?
@MasEspanglish @davidhogg111 Does play roles on his show for satirical purposes. Never said David was a crisis actor. No clips to prove it. Invited David to debate him, but he's a coward. He knows Alex Jones would mop the floor with him using logic &amp; evidence. My students could do it in their 2nd language.
@davidhogg111 You should watch Infowars as Jones is proven 98%  right. Even MSM has to eventually admit it in articles Attacked by folks such as you, TYT, MSM, Hillary, Obama, YouTube, Google, talk show hosts, Donkeys et al with no clips or evidence. Only ad hominims, logical fallacies &amp; lies.
@davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott Prove it! You pride yourself on having such great research skills. Senator Rubio only got $9,000 dollar from NRA in the last cycle. Hardly owned by them. Trump got nothing. He mostly financed his campaign himself. Donkeys are owned by unions, big pharma, Wall St., Russia etc.
@davidhogg111 Tested by independent labs in CA who have the highest standards to not be snake oil. Silicon Valley &amp; other elites all take the products. Do your research. Only helping @infowars to sell more products. Thanks. How about debating Jones? Scared he'll mop the floor with you?
@davidhogg111 #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@davidhogg111 Yes, oust the Republicrats, establishment and Donkeys in the next election. Elect True Conservative, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and Populists to office.
@rhonda_harbison @davidhogg111 @KCMillerEDU Obama, his FBI, big pharma, Sheriff Israel and his department are the ones who truly have the blood on their hands.

@davidhogg111 @Walmart @DICKS #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@RepTedDeutch @davidhogg111 The Fascist Left directs hatred towards us. Calls for assassination of @POTUS &amp; @VP. Killing of @HouseGOP, whites, Christians, Trump supporters, gun owners, @Conservatives , Libertarians, and Constitutionalists. What happened to "Love Trumps Hate"?
@Lupeppermint @davidhogg111 @Walmart @DICKS @amazon Fascist suppression of free speech, guaranteed in the 1st Amendment. #StopFascistGunGrabbers
@MattxRed @davidhogg111 Don't just pull things out of context to fit your narrative. More to the story.
@davidhogg111 NRA offered plan to save our kids in the public schools from these shootings, without any cost to the taxpayer. Obama refused. He put his Fascist Socialist ideology before country. Check it out for yourself.
@davidhogg111 How about our 1st &amp; 2nd Amendment rights? Don't just get your buddies @ CNN to complain &amp; have us removed from YouTube et al. It violates Constitutional, Contract &amp; Tort law. Do your research, debate with evidence, stats &amp; logic. Don't you have great debating &amp; research skills?
@sarahchad_ @davidhogg111 How about big pharma? The drugs that the shooter was taking contributed. Donkeys, Republicrats, MSM, MDs etc are all in their pocket.
@MattxRed @davidhogg111 NRA offered comprehensive plan to protect our public school kids without taxpayer dollars. Obama refused. Dogma over what's best of America. He, his FBI, Sheriff Israel, his department, &amp; big pharma have the blood of those who died at Parkland on their hands. Not Trump, or NRA!
@EricBoehlert @davidhogg111 He has met with Parkland kids and their parents to do something about the problem. President Trump listens and acts unlike other Presidents. 64% of his agenda has already been achieved. Unprecedented.
@davidhogg111 I must apologize as I misunderstood that you mom worked for CNN. But y'all did take a VIP tour there as she's posted pics Read Dr. Lott's books, "More Guns, Less Crime," &amp; "Gun Bias" for analysis of stats from law enforcement &amp; the FBI your father worked for.
@rhonda_harbison @davidhogg111 @KCMillerEDU Obama's FBI, Sheriff Israel &amp; his department have the blood of those kids and teachers on their hands. A few years ago the NRA offered a comprehensive plan to protect our school kids at no cost to the taxpayers, &amp; @BarackObama refused. The NRA isn't responsible for the shooting.
@davidhogg111 How about letting us Conservatives practice our 1st Amendment rights without interference from your mom's co-workers and your buddies over at CNN, who lobby YouTube to remove videos and spread false narratives and fake news.
@davidhogg111 Stop being a coward &amp; debate  @RealAlexJones. You claim to be such a great debater. Oh, you won't because you have no arguments or facts to support your fascist gun grabbing ideas He'll mop the floor with you. You're a big boy in the adult world, so make your case!
@davidhogg111 @Walmart @DICKS Young David, please get educated on the issue of gun control &amp; read Dr. @JohnRLottJr's seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" &amp; "Gun Bias." A leftist academic tried over 10 yrs to disprove his statistical analysis &amp; COULDN'T! You claim to have researched both sides of the issue.
@davidhogg111 You claim to have debating expertise, but never learned about argumentation supported by evidence &amp; logical fallacies. Like most leftists you engage in ad hominim &amp; other logical fallacies. My debate students could easily defeat you, &amp; English is their 2nd language.
@laurenduca The Oscar goes to....Senator Cory Booker for his best performance by an actor in a Senate hearing. Congrats. @CoryBooker
@SenGillibrand @laurenduca Don't fall for Sen. Gillibrand's false narrative as it's a power grab to deny Constitutionalists, Christians, Libertarians, Classical Liberals, Conservatives, and Trump supporters their 1st Amendment rights of speech, religion &amp; press. Already had my Facebook account disabled.
@LevineJonathan @laurenduca Fake News Network and sexist to boot.
@laurenduca Do the exhaustive investigative reporting and you'll find it's a nothing burger.
@laurenduca @brooklynmuseum Isn't this sexist??
@SenGillibrand @laurenduca Woman's right to kill her baby. Planned Parenthood's founder Sanger was a racist who spoke at KKK rallies about killing black babies. It's destroyed the black community. Science is on the side of the pro-lifers: neonatal care, ultrasounds, &amp; Harvard Med School criteria for life.
@EricHolder @laurenduca All going to prison for conspiracy, obstruction of justice, interference with our electoral process and wiretapping. AG Holder, how about your fast and furious program. You should be locked up too. Lex Rex!
@laurenduca Remember @BarackObama couldn't even make comments at a school without a teleprompter. Obama could read well &amp; deliver the speech. But it was his brilliant speech writers who did the work. They were on Charlie Rose laughing about how they'd written speeches lying about Obamacare.
@laurenduca Really? Give me 20 examples, in context without editorializing. You can't, so don't perpetuate this false narrative and foul mouthed language.
@laurenduca A racist, former KKK Grand Wizard agreeing with POTUS doesn't mean Trump is a racist. It's a logical fallacy. For the real history of politics &amp; racism in the US, watch D' Sousa's doc, "Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party," beginning with Andy Jackson.
@laurenduca Speak for yourself.
@laurenduca It's the Chinese New Year of the Dog.
@SarahEMcBride @laurenduca @BetsyDeVosED Transgender students can go into the women's restroom stalls and shut the door, so girls don't have to see his/her male organ. But if it's @ChrisCuomo's daughter, flash away. Our public schools have more important things to spend our hard earned tax dollars on.
@jareddiamond @laurenduca @30newsletter Hey, Dr. Diamond you never responded to my critique of your article about Noah's Ark. I answered all your arguments.
@laurenduca Prove it with court documents and convictions rather than smears and libel.
@JoyAnnReid @laurenduca Did you see the artist's portrait of a black women holding the severed head of a white women?? Pure racism and incitement of violence against Caucasians.
@JoyAnnReid @laurenduca Read former Secret Service agent Gary Aldrich's book, "Unlimited Access" about the Clinton administration. Available used in good condition at https://t.co/lG9j5t1I7W.
@laurenduca No women have filed papers in a court of law and their stories have been proven to be false. Recent women chastised a publication for falsely reporting that Trump had assaulted her while they dated. More fake news and Deranged Trump Syndrome.
@laurenduca WOW, quite the cocktail!
@Aly_Sheehy @laurenduca NRA offered a comprehensive plan several years ago to protect our schools, but Obama refused. The blood of your classmates and teachers is on the hands of Obama, his FBI, Sheriff Israel and his department.
@JoyAnnReid @laurenduca @NRA Can't demonize the NRA or Sen. Rubio who got $9,000. So he's hardly in their pocket. NRA offered a comprehensive plan to protect our kids with no cost to taxpayers. Obama refused. His FBI, Sheriff Israel &amp;  department have the blood of those students &amp; teachers on their hands.
@laurenduca One day you'll be forced to admit that Trump is one of America's greatest Presidents. 81 major promises &amp; 100 minor ones kept. economy surging, more jobs, lower unemployment in black community, religious freedoms restored, home ownership back up &amp; companies returning to US etc.
@laurenduca Shouldn't MSM be reporting Uranium 1, Russian collusion by Clintons, Podesta, Mueller &amp; Comey? Obstruction of justice &amp; interference with our election process by Obama, his FBI &amp; DOJ?  Obama's FBI, Sheriff Israel &amp; his department's negligence in not preventing Parkland killer?
@laurenduca He apologized Lauren. How about you apologizing for some of your offensive, bigoted, intolerant and hateful statements?
@laurenduca Alive in heaven. CS Lewis wrote that this world are merely, "shadowlands." "For the wages of sin (wrong doings in word, deed &amp; thought) are death (physical &amp; spiritual), but the free gift (can't earn it) of God is eternal life (in heaven &amp; abundant life here) in Christ Jesus."
@AnaMardoll @laurenduca Cite interviews, articles in "Decision" magazine, mailers, web site, print media, movies, or books that support your contention please.
@laurenduca Wrong for people to issue death threats, like left doing so with Trump, Pence, Christians, Conservatives, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Classical Liberals, males, whites, Republicans &amp; Trump supporters. Graham wasn't afraid of homosexuals (definition of homophobia).
@TheOnion @laurenduca LBGT folks need Christ, just as much as anyone in this world. This was Dr. Graham's message that he preached all over the world.
@audreywhiteTX @laurenduca Rev. @BillyGraham didn't fear homosexuals, which is the meaning of homophobia. He loved them, as does God &amp; wanted them to come to Christ, be redeemed &amp; overcome their chosen lifestyle. It's sexual sin like, pornography, adultery, fornication etc.  Read Graham's "Peace with God."
@longlivekcx @laurenduca Read Dr. @JohnRLottJr  seminal books, "More Guns, Less Crime" and "Gun Bias." A leftist academic spent 10 years trying to prove that his analysis was incorrect and couldn't do so.
@laurenduca Hope you had a Happy Birthday. Shangri Kuaile in Mandarin.
@laurenduca Are having trouble with understanding English language semantics and syntax? Remember Bill "Bubba" Clinton, known sexual predator and rapist, couldn't define the word "is." My ESL students could at least do that.
@laurenduca Give us 50 examples in context, without editorializing re: Trump's sexism and how Ivanka is his accomplice. That's right you can't even give us 20. So don't make slanderous remarks with evidence. I think you should stick to beauty tips, dealing with your boyfriend and fashion.
@Emma4Change @laurenduca Why aren't your pro 2nd Amendment classmates allowed to speak out on CNN et al? They don't support the fascist gun grabbers' narrative. Hogg's activist mom deals with VIPs @ CNN. Hmmm. Your classmate was to ask a question at CNN Town Hall, but the producer rewrote his question.
@JenAshleyWright @laurenduca NRA offered a comprehensive plan to protect our kids in the public schools with no cost to the taxpayer, but Obama rejected it. Obama's FBI and Sheriff Israel have the blood of the Parkland students and teachers on their hands. Negligence and they should be prosecuted.
@laurenduca @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 @longlivekcx Complex issue involving: 2nd Amendment, gov. tyranny, postmodernism, relativism, big pharma drugs (MDs, MSM &amp; leaders in their pocket), removal of God from public square, mental health, fatherless homes, social media isolation &amp; lack of parental involvement in their kid's lives.
@laurenduca Your tweet re: @BillyGraham demonstrates an intolerant, religiously bigoted, offensive hate speech. It proves that you know little about Christianity &amp; Rev. Graham. Watch his videos, movies, read his books &amp; "Decision" magazine. I suggest you read, "Peace with God."
@Harvard_Law @ACUConservative @CassSunstein @BV This law school has long departed from the great professors such as Joseph Story and Simon Greenleaf. Don't waste tuition money on this jurisprudential wasteland. Go to Liberty or Regent Law School. In the future study at William Blackstone University.
@mschlapp @ACUConservative She's a disgrace to my home state along with Diane Feinstein. A good Conservative needs to challenge her. How about Carlie?
@marklevinshow @ACUConservative Republicrat, Neocon, globalist, establishment, Never Trumper Senator McCain would have lost big time if but for Trump's endorsement and what does he get for this kindness?

@RepMarkMeadows @ACUConservative @Jim_Jordan @CPAC #RepMeadowsforHouseSpeaker
@mschlapp @ACUConservative Mr. Corn needs to read Dr. John Lott's seminal book, "More Guns, Less Crime." A leftist academic tried for 10 years to refute his research and couldn't. I heard him speak at USC's Federalist Society and had my copy autographed. Another good book is his, "Gun Bias."
@TomFitton @ACUConservative @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Mr. Fitton, why didn't you send the Clintons away a long time ago? Dropped the ball when Larry left to run for US Senate and didn't hire Congressman Bob Barr to take his place. Wasted opportunity and money.
@CPAC @ACUConservative @DavidCornDC David is an intellectual lightweight who has no logical arguments with evidence to support his position. Only deals with logical fallacies.
@mschlapp @ACUConservative @BetsyDeVosED Returning control to our districts, best practices, vouchers, charter schools, virtual schools, homeschooling, private schools, strengthening  our public schools, parental choice, community &amp; parental involvement, eliminate tenure, break teachers unions &amp; merit pay are needed.

@mschlapp @ACUConservative Mitt is a Republicrat, globalist, Neocon, 2 time loser, liberal, former governor, Never Trumper, elitist, establishment, flip flopper,  and architect of Obamacare template. People of Utah deserve leadership like that of the Sen. Orrin Hatch. Big mistake for Trump to endorse him.
@CPAC @ACUConservative @EPAScottPruitt @EPA Standing up to the fake science of the hard leftist climate alarmists.
@CPAC @ACUConservative @Marion_M_Le_Pen All excellent policy positions the need to be pursued here and in Europe.
@mschlapp @ACUConservative @CPAC You guys give into the hard leftist gun grabbers too easily. @DineshDSouza's tweet is taken out of context and he apologized. CPAC seem to be joining the politically incorrect police. You're an embarrassment to millions of True Conservatives, Constitutionalists, Libertarians etc.
@ACUConservative  CPAC are cowards for disinviting Mr. LaPierre due to leftist gun grabbers. The NRA have nothing to do with the various school shootings. They offered Obama rejected  a plan to protect our kids without using any taxpayers monies. Obama &amp; his FBI are to blame.
@MMFlint Mikey, give me 50 examples, in context without editorializing to prove POTUS is a racist. Then watch Dinesh D'Souza's documentary, "Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party," which proves that Donkeys are the true racist party beginning with Andy Jackson.
@MMFlint He needs to get his facts straight. Did he see the press conference held by experts who spent 1,000 hrs examining the "birth certificate" issued by the WH &amp; concluded that it's a fake. Do the necessary research. MSNBC, also like CNN has been proven to be a Fake News network.
@MMFlint Read the JFK files as to MLK Jr's politics? Study US History Mr. Moore and stop you revisionist false historical narratives. (Carson. Basic US History Volumes 1-5) Purchased used in good condition on https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm
@MMFlint You detailed 81 major &amp; 100 minor promises kept, tax cuts, economy rebounding,  less unemployment in black community, home ownership going up again, companies returning to US &amp; creating more jobs, religious liberties restored. greater respect by world leaders etc. Right Michael??
@MMFlint Soros stooges.
@MMFlint Donkeys will lose seats even in my home state of the Left Coast. Nationally they're die like the Whigs. 3rd Parties will replace them. Mike you should like this as you voted Green. GOP is being reformed. All good for our republic.
@MMFlint All paid for by Nazi collaborator ("60 Minutes" interview) George Soros. Even paid mindless students to participate.
@MMFlint Funded by Hungarian billionaire George Soros, who interfered with our electoral process &amp; tried to ferment race and civil war in our streets via Antifa, BLM, radical feminists, Communist and Socialist student groups, MSM, academia et al. Soros has his finger in all of it.
@MMFlint I used to be an unthinking liberal. Disease can be cured by being red pilled. Some are beyond the point of being enlightened.
@MMFlint All laws contain some type of morality based upon a worldview. US foundational principles based upon a Judeo-Christian worldview. Even Jefferson spoke of this important foundation as did other founding fathers. 22,000 laws based upon the Bible and "Blackstone's Commentaries."
@MMFlint Michael, take a poly sci course. No such thing as a democracy. Closest thing might be a town meeting. Our country is a Constitutional Republic. Study the Constitution and US History please.
@MMFlint Poorly argued piece of jurisprudence. Wrote paper in college. Roe spent last yrs of her life fighting against it. Used by feminists.  "The Brethren" details conspiracy of Supreme Ct clerks to get abortion legalized. Abortion contrary to Harvard Med Sch criteria for life etc.
@MMFlint According to your "documentary" how come you don't always go to Cuba to fulfill your healthcare needs? It has the "best system in the world [sic]" in your words. My best friend's sister died due to Obamacare.
@MMFlint Michael, I know you started a walking challenge, but you should go to Cuba as you're not looking well. After all it's the best healthcare system in the world! (documentary, "Sicko").
@chrisrock @MMFlint So strangely haunting. Artist likes to spread sperm on his paintings. Sexually deviant. One depicts a black woman holding a decapitated head of a white one. Racist! "Black Panther" film is Black Supremacist propaganda. Good action scenes.
@MMFlint Red herring and a nothing burger to smear the Israeli PM. Do the research as you fancy yourself on being a "documentarian."
@MMFlint Logical fallacy of emotionalism. Typical of left, who can't make arguments, cite stats, evidence, use logic, to debate the issue. Public schools  failed you. You were a School Board member who did nothing to improve the district you represented. Watch "Manufacturing Dissent."
@MMFlint Read John Lott's book, "More Guns, Less Crime." Interview him. Complex issue involving: postmodernism, relativism, removal of God from schools, 2nd Amendment, mental health, big phama drugs; they're in bed with leaders, MSM &amp; MDs, fatherless families and social media isolation.
@MMFlint Mike, Haven't you read the Steele dossier, WikiLeaks, Nunes memo yet? Matter of time before Obama, Clintons, Chelsea, Huma, Podesta bros, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Mueller, Jarette, Wasserman, Brazile, Mook, Mills, Rice et al will go to jail for obstruction, wiretapping etc.
@ejdickson Ad hominims do nothing to further your argument.
@JoyAnnReid Not really. Donkeys will lose big time in the midterms. Party will cease to exist as a political entity nationally &amp; be replaced by 3rd Parties. GOP is being reformed by Constitutionalists, Libertarians, True Conservatives, &amp; Classical Liberals. All healthy for our republic.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. Fitton squandered the opportunity to put away the Clinton Crime Family years ago. Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch founder, Larry Klayman should be appointed Special Counsel to finish the job.
@HuffPost Planned Parenthood, founded by racist eugenicist Margaret Sanger, has destroyed the black community. Abortion is contrary to science: neonatal medicine, ultrasounds and the Harvard Medical School criteria for life.
@ColombiaMatiz Andres all those tweets were meant for the son of Churchill poser, not Professor Saad. Dr. Gad is much more interesting, utilizes argumentation, some logic, humor, satire etc. There are several areas of agreement according to what I've seen of his tweets &amp; videos.
@SonOfRandolph Yes, I was responding to you rather than Professor Saad, All those tweets were directed towards you.
@JimmyMatho don't appreciate the ad homimin. My distant cousin, Robert E. Lee would never use that kind of language as he was a Christian gentleman,
@alex_amurillo @GadSaad I've been going through his stuff. I thought I was replying to @SonOfRandolph not Professor @GadSaad. As Winston isn't that sophisticated.
@JudgeJeanine Why not?

@GadSaad Fascism will come to the US in the form of Liberalism.
@alex_amurillo @SonOfRandolph @GadSaad @benshapiro @DePaulU @scrowder Ah, you mean his belief in the fairy tale for adults, namely macro-evolution. The religious cult of scientism that requires the greatest leap of faith.
@SonOfRandolph @GadSaad @benshapiro @DePaulU @scrowder You guys actually believe in the fairy tale for adults? The unscientific theory of macro-evolution and the religious cult of scientism.
@SonOfRandolph @KelvinClone @TwitterSupport Do a little research and you'll find out that words in English are ambiguous semantically. Then you might comprehend the meaning of red pilled.
@GadSaad This "scientist" believes in the "fairy tale for adults," namely the religious cult of macro-evolution.
@GadSaad @benshapiro Well you unthinking leftists generally regurgitate the talking points without doing the basic research. By the way, I bet you don't even vote.
@SonOfRandolph @GadSaad @benshapiro @DePaulU @scrowder I think you should have done so before taking them as the side effects you're experiencing explain a lot. Not able to think clearly, make cogent arguments, engaging in logical fallacies, inability to present facts and evidence.
@SonOfRandolph @Zekegerry @theredheadrides @Kindhearted2015 @DineshDSouza @CNN @realDonaldTrump Barak is the true Hitler, Fascist Socialist. Hillary is his evil spawn.
@KelvinClone @SonOfRandolph Yes, Fascism came across the pond in the form of Liberalism. Antifa, BLM, SJWs, academia, MSM, radical feminists, zombie students, Donkeys, elites, establishment, globalists are all prime examples.
@ChurchillCol @SonOfRandolph Heroes of the Fascist Socialist Barak "Barry" Obama.
@SonOfRandolph @GadSaad @benshapiro @DePaulU @scrowder Wake up and get red pilled!! You're in a zombie like state. Do the research. Then use logic, critical thinking, evidence, argumentation and facts or go to your safe space to color, play with legos and cuddle a therapy dog. Sorry I triggered you and you can't handle the shock.

@JeffFlake Sen. Flake, you know that Mueller's investigation has turned up nothing related to POTUS. These indictments reveal the Russian investigation is over. It's time for a real Special Counsel like @Judgenap @JudgeJeanine , Rep. @TGowdySC or Larry Klayman indict Mueller, Comey et al.
@TheView @JoyVBehar Bernie knows that Hillary Clinton stole the nomination from him. He should have asked for a roll call vote at the convention, instead of conceding and betraying his supporters. Dem &amp; election fraud expert Bev Harris proved that HRC stole the general election vote in 5 states.
@JoyVBehar Might be slapped with a lawsuit by the Nixon Family &amp; Library. We all know that Rep. Nunes' memo presented proof of crimes 100 times greater than Watergate. Obama, Clintons, Comey, Mueller, Yates, Lynch, Podesta brothers, McCabe, Rosenstein et al are all going to prison. Lex Rex!
@JoyVBehar Save your cash from the bonuses you receive due to the Trump Tax plan and spend it something much more interesting and useful. Like the title of the book, it's all Joy's hot air. Nothing burger.
@RealTimers @JoyVBehar @billmaher Why does Oprah tongue Harvey Weinstein's ear, defend the rapist and sexual predictor along with procuring girls for him??
@RealTimers @JoyVBehar @billmaher Don't worry, I'll get it for a dime at the local library's book sale like I did with all the Clinton books.
@JoyVBehar Both book signings take place at Cosco's toilet paper section. Tells you the value of these 2 books. Read Hillary's "Living History." Clinton insider, Dick Morris corrected all the false narratives in his book, "Rewriting History," as he has the goods on the Clinton Crime Family.
@JoyVBehar Find it at your local library sale, Goodwill book bin or used bookstores for less than a dollar soon. Joy will follow her hero Crooked Hillary to travel around the country and do book signings at the toilet paper section of Cosco. What does that tell you??
@TheView @JoyVBehar @JeffFlake There's no rational, logical discussion about these shootings. Only emotionalism and the call for gun confiscation by the Big Brother state as they did in Australia. Hitler and Stalin did the same thing.
@JoyVBehar Like Hillary's book it'll hit the used book stores, library sales &amp; Goodwill book bin soon where you'll get it for less than a dollar. Hillary's signings took place in the toilet paper section of Cosco.. Joy could do the same. Just about what both books are worth. Save your cash.
@PageSix @JoyVBehar Wait until the book ends up at a library sale or in the Goodwill book bin and get it for 25 cents to a dollar. Then you can use if for kindling to keep you warm during this unusually cold winter. Isn't the earth supposed to be warming??
@TheView @JoyVBehar A real nothing burger. Mueller still hasn't found any evidence to prove that there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Mueller, Clintons, Podesta brothers et al did collude.
@TheView @JoyVBehar @MichaelWolffNYC He's a well-known muckraker like William Randolph Hearst. He's admitted that he couldn't vouch for the book's accuracy and didn't interview a single cabinet member. Bannon was part of the plot to remove Trump per 25th and then take his place.
@TheView @JoyVBehar She might win primaries, but would certainly lose big time to President Donald J. Trump. She really doesn't want the public to vet her and see all the skeletons in her massive closets.
@TheView @JoyVBehar Oprah has too much baggage. Her New Age beliefs and endorsement of "The Secret." Also the fact that she hears voices in her back yard that guide her life. The sexual abuse at her elite girls school in S. Africa. Tonguing Weinstein's ear, defending him and securing women. Etc.
@TheView @JoyVBehar @MeghanMcCain @JeremiahBrent You should invite me on the show as I'd love to banter, debate and mop the floor with y'all. It would be fun and kid's play. Will you take the challenge?
@ABC2020 @JoyVBehar @RoseanneOnABC @therealroseanne @ABC Roseanne's character is a big time Trump supporter. The sister is a supporter of Crooked Hillary, who'll be going to prison for colluding with the Russians, Uranium One, pay-for-play, e-mail server, wiretapping and interfering with our elections. She stole nomination from Bernie.
@TheView @JoyVBehar Read John Lott's seminal book, "More Guns, Less Crime." Australia's law allowed the Big Brother state to forcibly confiscate firearms from citizens just like Hitler &amp; Stalin. A teacher with a concealed weapon could have stopped the shooter, like a guard did at a church shooting.
@JoyVBehar Ms. Behar, to disparage VP Pence &amp; his Christian faith like Howard Stern &amp; comparing it to a mental illness is intolerant, religious bigotry. You'd never make such comments about Oprah and her listening to voices in her back yard along with her combining New Age &amp; "The Secret"
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats Like I've told you many times, you have no cogent arguments to support your position. You only continue to invoke the logical fallacy of ad hominim. Use some critical thinking, evidence and logic or just keep quiet!

@JoyAnnReid Sorry, you're show was cancelled. People like watching Yogi Bear reruns rather than your network's false narratives and fake news. You could work for Twitter as a bot and censor of Christians and Conservatives. Or teach and indoctrinate mindless millennials at Columbia.

@Cernovich Mike, you'd be a great replacement for Trump's Chief of Staff. Gen. Kelly could be reassigned to a more suitable job.
@RealJamesWoods Obama will go to prison for obstruction of justice, conspiracy, treason, sedition, interference with our electoral process, collusion with the Russians and illegal wiretapping. Gitmo would be a great place for him to live out the rest of his days. He's already lawyering.

@billmaher Hey, Bill you know that Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, Comey, Obama, Mueller, Ohr, Peter, his lover, Huma, Wasserman, Brazile, McCabe, Clapper, Brennen, Rosenstein, Yates et al are all going to prison for conspiracy to interfere with our election process and obstruction of justice.
@THEHermanCain This is a ridiculous race baiting, racist and offensive comment.
@FoxNews Tranny's can just use the toilet and close the stall door in either men's or women's restrooms. CNN's Chris Cuomo wants his daughter to be exposed to a transgender's penis while using the restroom. Sick.
@realDonaldTrump Please Mr. President keep you campaign promise about illegal immigration, including the DACA memo signed by Obama's HS Sec. Napolitano who refused to enforce the law. Many DACA folks completed fraudulent paperwork (another crime), over 30 yrs old and never went to college.
@Lawrence Lawrence, please how about doing some real investigative journalism and talk about the conspiracy to influence our elections by Obama, Hillary, Podesta, Huma, Mook, Wasserman, Brazile, McCabe, Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, Ohr, Peter and his lover et al. They're all going to jail!!
@TheLastWord @Lawrence @maddow She admitted that she never had contact with @POTUS Investigate and present proof before making libelous remarks. I'd sue @MSNBC and put you guys out of business once and for all. Nominated for the People's Choice Fake News Award 2018. Sorry, CNN beat you guys out.
@JoyAnnReid These things can best be addressed and dealt with effectively by faith based charities, like Harvest Hope in SC.
@NBCOlympics @ATT @PGeveryday @USAA @verizon Go Team USA!!
@MaddowBlog More fake news. How about investigating the $150,000 paid by Clinton and DNC for Steele dirty dossier to interfere with our elections and wiretap Trump Campaign and others? Only Buzzfeed ran it. Why didn't MSNBC? Because it's a fake "nothing burger" It's available online to read.
@jimmykimmel @tomhanks More alt left propaganda like the movies the fascist socialist Nazis made.
@jimmykimmel Offensive, intolerant, and bigoted towards people of various religions and Christianity. Your monologues and skits have become merely humorless political Media Matters talking points. Millions miss the days of witty, satirical, timely and sometimes political humor of Johnny.
@jimmykimmel your religious bigotry, intolerance of Christians isn't that funny. Also it's quite offensive to others who share the various religions you mentioned. The cake compared to Elton's costume was funny. But you like Colbert and Noah, have become alt left political hacks.
@Morning_Joe Fake poll like the general elections. Sample? Question(s) posed? Basic methodology? Funny thing is that his approval rating is the same as Obama's despite, all the opposition or attacks. By the way Barry is lawyering up to avoid prison for treason.
@wmmII88 @DonaldJTrumpJr Mook, Wasserman and others in the DNC also need to be prosecuted and sent to jail! Lex Rex!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don Jr, I think your father should ask AG Sessions resign (he's been compromised) &amp; appoint Rep. Trey Gowdy AG. Then he can appoint @Judgenap @JudgeJeanine or Jay Sekalow to prosecute the treasonous acts of Obama, Clintons, Comey, Mueller, Podesta, Huma, McCabe, Rosenstein et al
@SarahPalinUSA Gov. Palin, as I've tweeted many times, I and many of my fellow Americans would love to have you run for the US Senate seat in Alaska. We need True Conservatives, Populists, Constitutionalists, evangelicals and Classical Liberals in that body to help and not obstruct @POTUS MAGA!
@GrahamBlog Retire from the US Senate or thousands upon thousands of my South Carolinians will fire you at the polls. We can no longer tolerate a Republicrat,, obstructionist, @SenJohnMcCain puppet, globalist, Neocon, big government Senator representing our great state.
Time for @LindseyGrahamSC to go. He's a member of the Gang of 6, Neocon, Republicrat, obstructionist and big government Republican. I call upon my fellow South Carolinians to oust him in the next election. Drain the Swamp and MAGA!
@SecularAnglo @McCormack2006 @EyalL @patcondell Impossible, because secularism or humanism is a kind of religion. How's that worked for you in the public square? 40 positive examples?
@SecularAnglo @McCormack2006 @EyalL @patcondell The sublime nature of my Churchill comment was lost on you. Separation of church and state a myth. Nowhere in the Constitution. Study the writings of our founding fathers, even Jefferson and Franklin. Defend your worldview and its intersection with the public square.
@crampell @JoyAnnReid The Fed  wants to raise interest rates more than during the Obama administration and brokerage houses like Goldman Sachs caused the markets to go down. They hate Trump with a passion and would rather take our economy down rather than allow POTUS be successful.
@Acosta @JoyAnnReid Jim, Congrats on receiving the People's Choice Fake News Reporter Award of 2018. Quite the honor. Keep doing what you're doing and next year you'll win again.
@GideonResnick @JoyAnnReid Rapist Bill Clinton??
@MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid #RepublicratsandDemsLoveHugeDeficits
@JoyAnnReid Clintons and Obama and all their cronies are off to prison. Finally justice will be done!! We are a nation of laws and no one is above them. Not even, Bill, Hillary and Barak. A good time for them to cool their heals, write &amp; reflect on all their criminal corruption and repent.
@RBReich @JoyAnnReid Treasonous acts by Obama, Clintons, Huma, Comey, Lynch, Rice, Jarret, Mills, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Wasserman, Mook, Podesta et al. They're all going to prison for the rest of their lives! Lex Rex! Barak is already lawyering up.
@EdJoyce @JoyAnnReid @keithboykin @RepJeffries Treasonous acts by Obama, Hillary, Bill, Podesta, Huma, Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Yates, Rice, Mills, Wasserman, Mook, Lynch et al. Lock them all up!! Lex Rex!. Barak is now lawyering up.
@MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid How about reporting on how Obama, Mueller, Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, Huma, McCabe, Yates, Podesta brothers, Comey, Lynch, Holder, Rosenstein, Wasserman, Ohr, Mills, Rice, Clapper, Brennon, Mook et al are all going to prison for treason, obstruction of justice, corruption etc.
@JoyAnnReid Sour grapes. She was frustrated about getting walled off from POTUS by General Kelly. He's got to go as he is an establishment, globalist.
@JoyAnnReid Rapist Bill Clinton??
@JoyAnnReid Hard to keep up with all your false narratives and fake news contained in your tweets. You guys have been defeated and nobody cares about MSM anymore. Proven time and time again to lie, lie and lie again.
@davidaxelrod @JoyAnnReid Hey Axelrod, your comrade, Barak is going to jail for treason, obstruction of justice, collusion with the Russians, wiretapping, interference with the electoral process and other crimes. He's already lawyering up. Thousand times greater than Watergate!!
@JoyAnnReid No, Joy just a pack of lies.
@JoyAnnReid Nope, get your facts straight. Donkeys from Obama, Hillary to their DOJ, FBI and NSA committed treason, obstructed justice, wiretapped, colluded with the Russians and interfered with our electoral process. Lock them all up! Lex Rex!
@JoyAnnReid Pro-life, religious liberty, free markets, beneficial trade deals, more jobs, return of companies from overseas, tax cuts, revitalizing the inner cities, less regulations, affordable energy, anti-globalism, opposing the fake science of climate change, secure borders etc. Dems??
@JoyAnnReid @thedailybeast Democratic Party will die and go the way of the Whigs. Replaced by 3rd Parties. GOP is being reformed by Populists, Constitutionalists, Libertarians, True Conservatives and Classical Liberals. Republicrats &amp; Donkeys will lost big time in midterms!
@RevDrBarber @JoyAnnReid Check out the economic indicators, lowest black unemployment ever! Look at HUD Secretary Dr. Carson's plan. Donkeys have used the black community for votes, they don't care. Their policies have ruined our cities. Racists! (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: Secret History of Dems)
@tedlieu @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump You didn't read it. Go back and actually do the necessary research. You like to lie and perpetuate false narratives and fake news. FYI you're all losing the battle and had better jump on the train or move out the way.
@RVAwonk @JoyAnnReid All discredited &amp; there's been no papers filed in the courts. Lawyers paid women to lie about him. Smear campaign to discredit POTUS. Enlightened Americans know better &amp; don't believe MSM, Dems, Republicrats, globalists, establishment, special interests, oligarchs, &amp; technocrats
@TeaPainUSA @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Raised by Communists (Dreams of My Real Father), influenced by Islam in Indonesia, Alinsky disciple like Hillary (Alinsky. Rules for Radicals.). First homosexual in the WH (Corsi. Obama Nation). Extremely corrupt (Malkin. Culture of Corruption.) and committed treason (Nunes memo)
@kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid The American people want to know why Hillary enabled her rapist husband?? Also how mostly Dems used taxpayer money to pay off sexual harassment victims. Why does Biden grope little girls in photo ops? Watch videos online.
@JoyAnnReid Loved Octavia in "The Help." Donkeys are the party of racism, KKK, racist Margaret Sanger, Andy Jackson. (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.) First blacks elected to Congress were all Conservative Republicans. Dem policies enslave minorities.
@SecularAnglo @McCormack2006 @EyalL @patcondell Yep, just as I thought you've got nothing to say. Secularists generally couldn't make a cogent, logical argument to save their lives. Few have the critical thinking skills to debate. This is why Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Classical Liberals, True Conservatives are winning.
@cnnbrk Well deserved for a very interesting series that mirrored what's happened with the corrupt Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations.
@KidsPress @ChelseaClinton Chelsea, you'll have lots of time to continue with your writing career while cooling your heals in prison with your folks. (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.)
@Slate Senator Hatch is a true patriot and Conservative. He's had a distinguished career in the US Senate. He will be missed. Hopefully he won't be replaced by the Trump bashing, liberal, flip flopper, liberal, globalist, establishment Republicrat, Mitt.
@nypost Rocket man has really put on a lot of weight!
@ocregister Donkeys under the leadership of Governor "moonbeam" Brown continue to run my home state. Support the New California movement. #SaveCASeparateNewCA
@billmaher @realDonaldTrump Hey Bill, he's got a higher IQ than you and can digest tons of reading material at one time. How about you? You just repeat the same ole talking points, hardly making any logical or cogent arguments to support your views. Didn't you ever take logic in school?
@latimes Trump can tell the federal judge to try and enforce his decision and continue with his crackdown plan.
@TheLastWord The good people of NY need to oust her &amp; replace with a True Conservative woman who'll MAGA!! Donkeys are obstructionists, Trump haters, baby killers, fascists, race baiters, welfare state enslavers, deficit spending lovers who have no message and will lose big time in midterms
@WSJ Oprah is  Weinstein's buddy and likes to tongue his ear. Accused of securing women for him to rape. She's a member of the billionaire club with Gates, Turner, Rockefeller, Buffet et al who want to depopulate the world.  Too many skeletons in her closet to run for POTUS.
@dcexaminer A corrupt, Neocon, radical feminist, Socialist, Alinsky disciple, psychopath, rapist enabler, crony-capitalist, racist, sexist, establishment, globalist, foul-mouthed, election stealer, criminal, Soros supported, power hungry whiner is truly her role model??
@WilliamShatner I totally agree with you Captain Kirk. Great tweet.
@CBSNews Omarosa is sour grapes because she got fired. But in her defense, she was denied access to the @POTUS via General Kelly.
@dcexaminer Mr. Schiff is the one who truly lacks character as he lies, perpetuates false narratives and fake news. My fellow Californians in Rep. Schiff's district oust him in the midterms. You deserve better leadership and he's a disgrace to our Golden State.
Rob Reiner received an award that he paid for at a scripted ceremony. He's a hypocrite! He'll not get into the thick of the Civil War. No "meathead" lives in a gated community with bodyguards who have guns. I'd like to see him with his comrades such as Socialists, BLM &amp; Antifa.
@Ashley_Rosa21 Amen and Amen
@Rachel_Taylor18 Thanks for following me. I hope you'll find my tweets to be informative and interesting. I'm following you now. You look like an Asian, young woman who's a patriot and want to MAGA!
@CNN Sorry, former CIA intern Anderson, your buddies whom you protect are all going to jail. Lex Rex!
@CNN Sorry Clinton News Network, winner of the People's Choice Fake News Network award for 2018, your buddies Clintons, Obama and their cronies in the FBI and DOJ are all going to prison. Lex Rex!
@thehill They're fascists who don't care about the kids, only power and money.
@MaddowBlog Read the memo Rachel and the redacted FISA document on the Office of National Intelligence's web site. Stop with the fake news and false narratives. I'd suggest everyone watch classic reruns of Yogi Bear instead of @maddow   &amp; @MSNBC shows. It's a much better use of your time.
@JoyAnnReid What do Donkeys stand for? Impeach or assassinate Trump, obstruction, expansion of government, higher deficits, killing babies, radical feminism, Socialism, fascism, open borders, political correctness, BLM, race baiting, division, intolerance, hatred and destruction of family.
@latimes Los Angeles Rescue Mission, Salvation Army, World Impact and Fred Jordan Mission are doing the work based on faith to truly help the homeless. Government can't do an effective job! Please give your charitable donations to these groups. You can find their web sites online.
@NancyPelosi Ms. Pelosi, please for the sake of your party and your district, resign!. Your leadership is hurting the Dems. Your speeches and interviews eg. CNN with Chris Cuomo demonstrate that your mental faculties are going.
@dcexaminer What planet is Sen. Feinstein living on?? She's a disgrace to my home state of CA. Fellow Californians oust her in the next election cycle! Donkey's have destroyed my beloved state and the rest of our republic. Americans, go online and read the dirty dossier for yourself.
@JustinTrudeau Globalist Trudeau is trying to make himself relevant by kissing up to POTUS. Saw multicolored socks, a bit immature sir. EU continues to lose power as countries abandon them and assert their sovereignty. Globalist elites like Soros hate it.
@ladailynews @ocregister Great to see pics of our USA athletes over here in the PRC. Go Team USA!!
@SenateGOP @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Can a True Socialist and True Conservative come to any agreement without one almost totally selling out? If they're both Republicrat establishment they can. "Not a dime's worth of difference" (Strang. None Dare Call It Conspiracy.)
@JeffFlake Senator Flake, thanks for putting country before party (Republicrats, establishment) in voting against greater debt.
@SecularAnglo @McCormack2006 @EyalL @patcondell Best you can do? Present your arguments against mine. Yeah, that's what I thought, like most secularists, you have none. All you can do is denigrate a great Conservative like PM Winston Churchill giving the British gesture, "F**k you!"
@CBSNews Politically incorrect, fascist, race baiters strike again. Read either classic? "To Kill a Mockingbird"- a white honest lawyer stands against racism in defending a black man who's wrongfully accused of raping a white girl. "Huckleberry Finn"  he questions if slavery is right.
@thehill Todd, still living in the alternate reality and echo chamber that is filled with fake news and false narratives.
@Education4Libs @LucyForLiberty @NancyPelosi supports the killing of babies before they're born. Future women. This is destroying the black community. Planned Parenthood was founded by racist Margaret Sanger who spoke at KKK rallies. Rep. Pelosi a big supporter.

@Lawrence @TheLastWord #DemsandRepublicratsLoveHugeDeficits
@MattJonesRadio If we don't like the way POTUS handles the deficit problem, then hold his feet to the fire. Write, call, e-mail, Tweet him and his economic team. We need to threaten Republicrats and Donkeys with being ousted if they don't do the people's work in Congress.
@NBCNews Per Nunes memo &amp; the redacted document on Office of National Intelligence web site Obama, Hillary, Wasserman, Ohr, Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Lynch et al are all going to prison for treason and other criminal acts against the republic and its electoral process. Lex Rex!
@Jordan_Milam @Lawrence #AmericanCitizensHaveDreams
@JoyAnnReid Come on Joy. Don't you have anything new to parrot besides the same ole leftist, Media Matters talking points about class warfare and the evils of the free-market? It's so boring and causes your network to continue to tank in the ratings.
@TheLastWord @Lawrence Why watch anything on MSNBC as they're part of the MSM Fake News Networks? Enjoy some down time watching classic Yogi Bear reruns. Then go to the Real News with David Knight program online.
@NBCNews @mitchellreports @MSNBC How about Biden's fondling of young girls during photo ops. Lots of video proof out there. Secret Service agent states that it's almost like Harvey Weinstein. "Say it isn't so, Joe."
@marcps Dr. @SebGorka wasn't fired. He quit! Do the research.
@KamalaHarris @LittleMissFlint Get multi-millionaire Mike Moore to finance the fixing of his hometown's water crisis. He won't as he's a crony-capitalism, psydo-documentarian (documentary "Manufacturing Dissent.)
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton Afraid to return to Haiti where you bilked them of $2 BILLION in their time of need? They'll beat you to a pulp for your uncaring, money-grubbing crony-capitalism. Go to Jail where you belong with others at the corrupt entity known as the @ClintonFdn
@FoxNews Clintons et al don't pass GO. Go directly to jail!
@colbertlateshow Continue to perpetuate fake science &amp; false narratives. Have staff research: "Politically Incorrect Global Warming," bk "Climate Hustle" doc, some of the 1,300 peer-reviewed papers raising doubts as to climate change seriousness, "Friends of Science" report, Climategate e-mails.
@GOPChairwoman Like the Clintons he talks out of both sides of his mouth and says whatever the audience wants to hear. No moral compass.
@SenJeffMerkley @maddow @MSNBC Why go on a show that no one watches and the network has lower ratings than reruns of Yogi Bear? Watching classic cartoons is a better use of your leisure time.
@ava Donkeys, teacher unions, social progressives, LGBT activists, radical feminists, Marxists, macro-evolutionists et al could care less about our public schools. They only want power, money and to force their agenda down children's throats.
@freedomcaucus @FreedomWorks Republicrats and Donkeys will pay dearly at the polls as we continue to Drain the Swamp and MAGA1
@SenBooker @realDonaldTrump Sen. Cory, how about criticizing the French President for their military parades on Bastille Day? I observed it in Strasbourg, FR one summer.
@RepMarkMeadows @FreedomWorks Rep. Meadows thanks for your hard work in Congress in fighting for freedom and MAGA! Congressman, you need to replace Neocon, Republicrat Ryan as Speaker.
@colbertlateshow Hey Stephen, how about reading the FISA memo word for word during your monologue without comment? Dare you!! Might improve your ratings.
@RepMattGaetz Read it along with the redacted FISA document on the Office of National Intelligence's web site. Thanks for all your great work Congressman in fighting for our republic and MAGA!
@JoyAnnReid How about the military parade in France every Bastille Day? I was there one summer.

@4YrsToday To advocate violence and a savage attack against a sitting US Senator over political differences reflects a barbarian, intolerant, fascist and lawless worldview.

@Brendan_Noble #RepublicratsandDemsWantHugeDeficiets
@BetteMidler Ms. Midler, you're calling for the savage attack of a US Senator by a person who doesn't agree with his politics. Barbarian and contrary to our traditions of laws.
@vickscan @realDonaldTrump #RepublicratsandDemsWantHugeDeficiets
@SenatorMenendez Senator, I thought you were on your way to prison for corruption. Why are you still in the US Senate? Resign or be humiliated and defeated in the next election.
@ChrisJZullo Read the works from the economists from the Austrian School, Dr. Thomas Sowell or Dr. Milton Friedman.
@MarkDice Hope to join Sen. Paul, who's a True Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Republican, Evangelical, Patriot in Congress in the future to fight for our great republic. Go Dr. Paul Go!
@chrislhayes Go back and check your facts, so you don't continually perpetuate fake news and false narratives. Nobody cares about the MSM's "attempts" to be journalists. I can't even watch @MSNBC anymore as it's just an echo chamber where like-minded guests, wink, chortle, and smugly agree.
@RichardDawkins @McCormack2006 Richard believes that we were seeded by UFO aliens to explain human origins (documentary "No Intelligence Required.") Talk about needing to study some physics. Dawkins' religion is irrational and unscientific (Wilson. Crash Go the Gods.)
@SecularAnglo @McCormack2006 @EyalL @patcondell From goo to you.  You truly believe that you're a monkey's uncle? Why won't airlines allow a person to buy a seat next to them for their distant cousin Bonzo?
@tarun26atheist @McCormack2006 Be intellectually open-minded and tolerant by reading, Josh McDowell's seminal one volume, "New Evidence That Demands a Verdict." It's available used for a good price on https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm
@RichardDawkins @McCormack2006 Professor Dawkins, firstly cite your stats from reliable sources. Secondly, read academic and researcher, John Lott's seminal book, "More Guns, Less Crime" before spouting gun control nonsense. Prof. tried to discredit him over ten years of analysis and COULDN'T1
@fangpusskins @ClaraJeffery Not a bot, Ms. Davis. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen!. Engage in debate, evidence, facts, stats, logic, critical thinking, not ad hominim and other logical fallacies.
@thehill One of the many crimes committed by Hillary which she needs to pay for. #LockHerUp2018
@thehill I completely agree with the Freedom Caucus and hope someday to join them in serving our great republic in Congress.
@DavidCornDC @elonmusk Mr. Musk is rejecting the globalist, establishment, Socialist, oligarch, technocrat, crony-capitalist worldview that seeks to enslave humanity.
@KTLA A judge who's read the Constitution and doesn't legislate from the bench. A true role model.
@thehill President Bush has absolutely no evidence to support his false narrative, just like Robert Mueller's year long investigation and waste of our money.
@macadee @Lawrence Present evidence that would be acceptable in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt before making libelous statements.
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Amen and Amen! Remember watching you and Curtis Wilson on an AM show in Columbia, SC before going to work. You've come a long way to the premier mainstream media network that can be trusted.
@ClaraJeffery Pelosi, Green, Wilson, Waters et al are going to be ousted. Donkeys need new, fresh leadership, not these incoherent dinosaurs.
@foxandfriends I'd probably be sleeping after 8 hours of Nancy Pelosi's incoherent rants too.
@politico What a sexist pictorial remark!!
@CNN Time for Pelosi to sit down, be quiet, resign and return to her SF Swamp. Her speeches and interviews eg. with CNN Chris Cuomo demonstrate that she's losing her mental faculties. Donkeys need new, fresh leadership, not the old dinosaurs that they have now.
@Nigel_Farage When will Soros be arrested and tried for treason and crimes against humanity??
@FoxNews @BarackObama Nunes memo leads to Obama and Hillary's criminal acts of conspiracy, treason and sedition. They'll be in prison before next year.
@CNN France has a military parade on Bastille Day which I've observed, which happens to also be my birthday.
@thehill Neocon Republicrat Senator McCain should retire. If Trump didn't endorse him in the last election, he would have surely lost. How does he repay our president for his favor and kindness.
@AP Read Rodger Stone's excellent book, "Bush Crime Family" available used and in good condition at https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm.
@ABC She's still going? Who cares? Only the fake news. Donkeys must cut her loose and replace with some younger and more coherent leadership that's not losing it.
@LeaveEUOfficial #ArrestSorosforTreason
@Pontifex Pope Francis, how about the pedophile priests, and the participants of the homosexual orgy at the Vatican whom you pardoned?
@Pontifex As an evangelical who is skeptical of global warming/climate change due to the 1,300 peer-reviewed scientific articles by climate experts who raise doubts plus other scientific evidence, not a true Christian?
@TheDailyShow Sorry Trevor, you were nominated, but didn't win the People's Choice Fake News Award's Entertainer of the Year. Fellow hard leftist Stephen Colbert snagged it.
@Morning_Joe Invite me on your show. It would be loads of fun to mop the floor with you Congressman. You're kids play.
@JoeNBC Joe, there's no Russian collusion. NO evidence whatsoever!. FISA document and Nunes memo show that DOJ, FBI, Comey, Mueller, Obama, Clintons, Fusion GPS, Podesta, Mook Brazile, Wasserman, Lynch, Steele et al all conspired and committed treason and sedition. Worse than Watergate!!
@CNN There's no Dreamer act or law. It was defeated as a bill in Congress &amp; will be so again. DACA was enacted when HS Sec. Janet Napolitano's memo didn't enforce the immigration laws in her memo. Many DACA beneficiaries never went to college,  over 30 yrs old &amp; filled fake papers.
@SeashoreMary @perfectsliders "Atlantic Monthly" and other MSM outlets have posted it. The House of Reps posted it too. Just Google it. Office of National Intelligence's web site has the redacted FISA document. Explosive and damning. People will go to jail. Lex Rex!
@csuf Great school! My alma mater where I did my teaching credential in Secondary Level Social Studies. Now a university teacher in the USA and PRC. Go Titans!!
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton @BarbadosToday Do you dare go back to Haiti after bilking them of $2 billion? They hate you there for your greedy crony capitalism.
@USATODAY Joe "foot in the mouth, groper of little girls" Biden is irrelevant. No one listens to his nonsense anymore.
@politico Nope, Donkeys are finished and will die like the Whigs did. Replaced by 3rd Parties and a reformed GOP. Great for our republic!
@CNN NAFTA is finished! Good riddance.
@tedlieu @UCLA Who cares as Pelosi and the bicoastal Donkeys are finished like the Whigs. 3rd Parties will replace them along with a reformed GOP.  Great for our Republic!
@CNNPolitics Joe misses his photo ops as he gropes little girls. Watch the tons of videos online. Secret Service agent says he's almost like Harv. Weinstein. Prosecuted him.
@SarahPalinUSA Run, Sarah, Run!!
@SenWarren Sign up and put your money where your mouth is. Drop your Senate health insurance coverage. That's what I thought! You're a hypocrite. Enjoy your retirement as we Drain the Swamp of Dems, obstructionists, liars, Republicrats, leftists &amp; intolerant, bigoted  fascists in Congress.
@KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi Really, who cares! Pelosi is out the door and her rants won't accomplish anything. No one believes her.
@RepAdamSchiff #CAforOustingRepSchiffin2018
@RepMarkMeadows Congressman Meadows, we need you to replace Republicrat Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House to MAGA!!
@KamalaHarris I will run and win as a True Conservative, Moral Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Evangelical, heterosexual, educator, Classical Liberal Republican to counter everything you stand for Senator. And I'm already doing so as a member of the real resistance.
@HillaryClinton Tune in as you go to jail along with Bill, Chelsea, Huma, Podesta boys, Comey, Lynch, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Ohr, Rep. Wasserman, Mook, Obama et al. Enjoy yourself with your cellmate and new girlfriend!
@RepAdamSchiff Hey Adam, you know that you colluded with the Clintons re: FBI investigation. Resign from your seat immediately or be defeated and humiliated in the midterms. All your lies and corruption will be brought out in the campaign. My fellow Californians oust this man! Drain the Swamp!!
@JoyAnnReid Dear Joy, Many DACA beneficiaries completed fraudulent paperwork are over age of 30 and never went to college. Do the journalist research and report on it instead of your false narratives and fake news. No one trusts you in MSM anymore.
@SenDuckworth How about Hillary, Obama, Lynch, Comey, Mueller, Bill, Biden, Gore, HW, W, Holder et al who all swore to uphold the Constitution and subverted it?
@TheDemocrats I could have used the extra money when I was a public school teacher in SC.
@SenKamalaHarris I'm afraid Pelosi will collapse as she rants and raves while making incoherent statements on the floor. Check out  her speeches and interviews as proof she's losing it. Still thinks W is president and colluding with Russians. Can't Donkeys do better with younger leadership?
@thehill Obama needs to not pass Go and go to jail.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President fire Fed Chairperson and put in a true free market, capitalist who wants to MAGA. Use executive order to eliminate Fed like JFK attempted to do. Ask Congress to issue Greenbacks or silver certificates again. We know Goldman Sachs et al manipulated the stock market.
@SenWarren One of the few examples you can point to in order to make your case. How about 100,000 out of the 1.8 million DACA beneficiaries? Few went to college, many completed fraudulent paperwork, which is another crime &amp; most over age of 30. How about you falsifying heritage to get job?
@TheDailyShow Wow you really think Trump's a dictator. Provide 50 examples, in context with editorializing. France has a military parade on Bastille Day. I've seen it. No wonder your show is tanking. We need reasonable liberal  former host John Stewart back. He was interesting and funny.
@JudgeJeanine In front of the People's House. I must admit that I have a little crush on you Judge. Love your show! I'm going to recommend that POTUS  ask AG Sessions to resign, replace with Rep. Gowdy, then appoint you or @Judgenap to be Special Prosecutor to pursue what's in Nunes' memo
@RepWilson @NancyPelosi Pelosi's speeches, interviews etc. indicate she's losing it and needs to retire. Can't Donkeys find better and younger leadership? Representatives Frederica Wilson &amp; Waters all need to go. Replace them with Conservative women who'll MAGA! Dems and Republicrats will lose midterms.
@NBCNews My cousin's alma mater, in Arizona had him commit bestiality with a pig to join a frat. Sick perversion!
Everyone go to read the "Atlantic Monthly" or other MSM postings of Nunes memo. It's explosive and names the names of those who've committed criminal acts, treason and sedition. House of Rep web site has it with the legal &amp; Constitutional justification for its release by Trump.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats Ad hominims do nothing to further your argument. Debate, proof, &amp; logic isn't too much to ask for. Read scholar &amp; academic, John Lott's book, "More Guns, Less Crime" as he presents the empirical data to prove his point. Leftist academic tried 10 yrs to prove him wrong. Couldn't!
@BillClinton Why would they invite you to do ANYTHING? Mr. Clinton you're just a crony-capitalist, pretending to care about the poor and less fortunate. Your academy award wining performances are tremendous. Don't pass go and go directly to jail, sir.
@BillClinton Mr. President, no one's interested in your Foundation due to the massive corruption and criminal activities. eg. pay-for-play and bilking Haiti out of $2 billion in aid monies (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.) Time you, Ms. Clinton, Chelsea et al to cool your heals in prison.
Mikey Moore's People's SOTU address is Alinsky, Socialist, Underground, Antifa dogma. Stop being a poser and get out there with your Antifa comrades (the real fascists) and kick some white butt. Seen doc. "Manufactoring Dissent" exposing you for the fraud you are?
@JoeNBC We know you're jealous of Trump &amp; think you should be POTUS or at least his VP. Get over it, smell the coffee! How do you know what's in the Nunes memo? Has it been illegally leaked to you or do you believe Adam's lies? FBI Director wants it released. Dems will be brought down.
@imillhiser Ian you need to study US history and you'll discover that the Donkeys are the real racists. Long history since Andy Jackson. Watch Dinesh D 'Sousa's documentary, "Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party."
@CNN Donkeys are obstructionists and shutdown the government. They will be ousted in the midterms. Bicoastal party will die like Whigs and be replaced by 3rd Parties. Great for our republic!!
@nytimes Zuckerberg's a technocrat fascist. He bans free speech and ads on Facebook. Boycott Facebook! Use other forms of social media.
@MSNBC I greatly admire John and Bobby. Joe III is NO JFK nor RFK!
@EPA @POTUS Y'all are doing a great job at the EPA!
@RepJoeKennedy Joe, give it up as you'll never become president. I admire your grandfather and great-uncle. But you're no JFK nor RFK. Have you examined the government's economic numbers?
@thehill Trump will meet Putin to play hard ball with him. But you all trapped in the disease of Trump Derangement Syndrome and think he's his puppet. No evidence. Hillary and the gang have been colluding with them, eg. Uranium 1.
@NPR Used to like his show until he began spreading the dogma of macro-evolution. It's contrary to the fossil record, geology, astronomy, information systems, genetics, biochemistry, zoology etc. He perpetuates the fake alarmist science of climate change. Afraid to debate experts.
@RealJamesWoods Joe will never become President. He's no JFK nor RFK!
@CNNPolitics Jones is a racist and so is his party (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.) His former boss is going to jail for treason, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, violating the US Constitution etc. He'll spend the remainder of his life in Gitmo.
@WSJ Enables rapist husband and trashes his accusers. Hypocrite. Lock Her Up!!
@KamalaHarris He didn't equate them. Read the speech, Sen. My home state, CA now a sanctuary state. Donkeys keep running my state into the ground. So many of us, companies and organizations have fled. You're are finished. Bicoastal party. 3rd Parties will replace. Republicrats ousted too.
@NPR Send the treasonous, criminal, seditious, colluders etc. Clintons, Obama, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein et al to prison their for the rest of their lives. Lex Rex!
@WhitfordBradley Stormy denied she had sex with Trump. He's not racist as his employees, staff, friends and even some enemies will attest. Prove it with 40 examples, in context without editorializing. No collusion. Clintons, Podestas, Huma, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Obama all colluded.
@JoyAnnReid Not a bot. Just trying to keep it real and counter your false narratives and fake news.
@JohnJamesMI Elect John James to the  US Senate!! I heartily endorse him as he'll help to MAGA!!
@TheDemocrats Prove it with stats and government numbers. Stop perpetuating fake news and false narratives. Donkeys are finished and will die like Whigs. Replaced by 3rd Parties. Great for our republic!
@SarahPalinUSA Cuomo fake news anchor. Sarah, run for US Senate to help MAGA. Trump will campaign for you as you were one of his early supporters.
@CBSNews Maxine will be replaced by Omar, who actually lives and grew up in the district. Unlike Rep. Waters who lives in a million dollar mansion in Hancock Park.
@JoyAnnReid Quote it in context Joy. He's referring to MS-13 gang members who chop up their victims.
@JudgeJeanine Hollywood celebrities should keep their mouth's shut, unless they can make cogent arguments and provide evidence from stats and studies. Love you Judge, your smart and beautiful. Should be serving in Trump administration to help MAGA. Know Trump loves your show.
@HuffPost Republicrat Mitch will be ousted. Drain the Swamp!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @NBCNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump My fellow South Carolinians we need to send Republicrat and Neocon Senator Lindsey Graham packing. Replace him with Pastor Mark Burns or former Senator Jim DeMInt. MAGA! Drain the Swamp!
@FOXLA Send Clintons, Obama, Huma, Podesta brothers, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein et al to serve out the remainder of their days. Lex Rex!!
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr From my great state of SC. Doesn't care about blacks in his district. Continues policies that destroy the black community. eg Planned Parenthood, founded by racist Margaret Sanger who spoke at KKK rallies (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.)
@politico Rep. Kennedy is affected by Trump Derangement Syndrome. Hasn't read speech and looked at government economic numbers. Disgraces grandfather and great-uncles' legacy as they lowered taxes, stood up to Soviets and tried to end Fed. Similar to Trump.
@SenBlumenthal Senator, get your facts straight!! No such thing as Dreamers as act was defeated in Congress. Many completed fraudulent paperwork (criminal act), many over age of 30, few went to college. Illegal aliens. @DHS Sec. Napolitano under criminal Obama deterred acting and enforcing law.
@TheDailyShow No such thing as Dreamers as the act was voted down in Congress. They're illegal aliens: many completed fraudulent paperwork, over age of 30 and few went to college. @DHSgov Sec. Napolitano just deterred enforcing the law with memo. Get your facts straight Trevor!!
@CNNPolitics Great hero to escape from PRK and now helping other escapees. I salute you sir.
@senrobportman Like Speaker Gingrich and GOP's Welfare to Work plan. Clinton shrewdly tested the political winds and signed it into law. Why was William Jefferson Clinton successful? GOP!
@JoyAnnReid So what Joy! @ClintonFdn was a pay-for-play criminal scheme from which Clintons et al got millions (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.) They're all going to jail. Lex Rex!
Great address by POTUS. Positive, upbeat &amp; stated facts about our economy &amp; how MAGA. Has nothing to do with Barak. He'll be going to prison along with Clintons, Podestas, Huma, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Wasserman et al. Lock Them Up! Kennedy has Trump Deranged Syndrom.
Minority Leader Chuckie, is crying in the well of the Senate and stating a false narrative invented by Rep. Schiff. Sen. Durbin makes up things, why not Adam? Donkeys are finished! Clintons, Mueller, Huma, Podesta bros, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Rosenstein et al all going to prison.
@mariashriver Loved your uncles John &amp; Bobby. They're like Trump. Lowered taxes, tried to end Fed, stood up to Soviets. Bobby helped JFK to MAG. Told MLK Jr. to fire Communists in his ranks. JFK files posted on National Archives' site prove that LBJ ordered hit. AG RFK was ready to prosecute.
@MSNBC @Lawrence Lawrence's more fake news and false narratives. Probably didn't even read address and hasn't looked at the government numbers regarding economy's great improvements. MSNBC keep getting beaten by Yogi Bear reruns. Nobody listens to them anymore.
@NPR Continue to ruin MA with your policies. Build on Gov. Mitt's Romneycare. Template for Obamacare. Mitt should lose bid for US Senate UT. Total Republicrat.
@usatodayDC Kennedy's false narratives. Should study grandfather and great-uncle's legacies. Similar to Trump's.
@HuffPost Rep. Joe Kenney III's false narrative. Didn't read POTUS's SOTU address. Hasn't looked at government numbers re: our economy. Merely same old Donkey talking points. Disgrace to grandfather and great-uncles' legacies. Well never become President. Dems will go way of the Whigs.
@CNNPolitics Joe Kennedy III is out of touch wt reality. Hasn't looked at gov. #s re: economy. Disgrace to JFK &amp; RFK's legacies. Admire JFK for trying to end Fed, tax cuts, stood up to Soviets etc. RFK helped bro to MAG. Warned MLK Jr. to distance himself from Communists. Check out JFK files.
@TwitterGov Rep. Kennedy is delusional. Disgrace to grandfather &amp; great-uncle's legacy. Admirer of JFK for cutting taxes, tough on USSR along wt RFK, tried to end Fed etc. Killed by LBJ order as files prove. Bobby helped brother to MAG. Warned MLK Jr. to distance himself from Communists etc.
@SeashoreMary @perfectsliders Congress voted to declassify and release it. President will approve. Donkeys are craping in their pants. Rep. Schiff tried to get out a fake one. He's out of office and he's a disgrace to my home state of CA.
@mmgonline @thehill I told you Mindset they retract &amp; expand. It's the cycle of nature. Fake science provided by  scientists &amp; uncredentialed Hollywood types. UNIPCC member Dr. Einhoffer said that it's so politicized and has little to do with science or environment. Founder of Greenpeace concurs.
@SBALinda @PressSec @FoxBusiness @MariaBartiromo Linda and Sarah keep up the great work in MAGA!!
@RepAdamSchiff Hey Adam, you Donkeys are finished as a political party. Replaced by 3rd Parties which will be great for our republic. Obama, Clintons, Huma, Podesta brothers, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein et al will all be going to prison. Lex Rex!! Lock Them All Up!!! Drain the Swamp!!!
@JoyAnnReid Compared to Bill, Hillary and Barak he's light years better as a role model. Just keeping it real. They are all criminals along with  their cronies who'lll be going to prison. Finally justice will be done! Lex Rex! Lock Them Up!!
@RepWilson Rep. Wilson, dust off the ole resume as Donkeys are finished. #DemPartyDiesLikeWhigs Replaced by 3rd Parties. Great for our republic!! Dems and Republicrats will lose in midterms. Obama, Clintons, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Lynch, Podestas et al all going to prison.
@foxandfriends Sour grapes, Trump haters and obstructionists who don't want to MAGA. Many Donkeys will lose at the midterms along with Republicrats. The swamp is being drained. Clintons, Obama, Comey, Podestas, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, Lynch, McCain et al will be going to jail.
Minority Leader Chuckie, is crying in the well of the Senate and stating a false narrative invented by Rep. Schiff. Sen. Durbin makes up things, why not Adam? Donkeys are finished! Clintons, Mueller, Huma, Podesta bros, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Rosenstein et al all going to prison.
@publicpolicyman Also lobby Congress to pass the FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKwviH).
@FoxBusiness @Varneyco Unhinged Trump Syndrome.
@ocregister Gov. Brown along with other Donkeys continue to run my home state into the ground.  Many Californians, such as myself, businesses and organizations flee the Left Coast. Support the New California move.
@SarahPalinUSA Run for US Senate, Governor Palin.
@JoyAnnReid Joy, please be original &amp; stop with the Media Matters talking points. When memo is released Hillary, Obama, Comey, Mueller, Podesta, Huma, Bill, Lynch, McCabe, Rosenstein et al will all be going to prison. Real collusion, treason and conspiracy to interfere with our elections.
@RepMarkMeadows @RepJeffDuncan Congressman Meadows, I'd like you replace Republicrat Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House.
@RepJeffDuncan @nikkihaley Trump needs to recall Ambassador Haley and defund UN for at least a year. Europe, technocrats, oligarchs, Hollywood, billionaires can fund it.
@Betweenthehedge @RepJeffDuncan @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Republicrat, Neocon Senator Graham must be ousted. Part of the Gang of 6 &amp; formerly Gang of 8 re: immigration. Protégée of  Republicrat, Neocon, Sen McCain, who was involved in circulating fake dossier. Draft Pastor Mark Burns to take his seat of former US Senator Jim DeMint.
@RepJeffDuncan Rep. Duncan, you should visit my alma mater, CIU and speak in chapel about being a Christian in public service.
@SpeakerRyan @RepJeffDuncan Republicrat Speaker Ryan needs to go. Replace him with Representative Mark Meadows!
@MaryCaitlinByrd @RepJeffDuncan We have a great delegation representing the Palmetto State. Need to oust Jim Clyburn and get a true Conservative to take his place to help MAGA!!
@RepJeffDuncan #DemsDreamersShutdown
@RepJeffDuncan Congressman Duncan, how about building upon the great tax cut law &amp; help to get the FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKwviH) passed. It's a national sales tax on new goods services. Eliminates IRS, Fed Income taxes, withholdings, filings, paying accountants to file.
@RepJeffDuncan Brother Jeff, totally agree! Glad to see that you follow me and enjoy my Tweets. Thanks for your leadership representing us South Carolinians. I hope to take Rep. Wilson's place in Congress, if he hasn't already retired by that time.
@thehill McCabe, Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, Hillary, Huma, Podesta, Obama, Bill, Chelsea, Lynch et al are all going to prison for treason, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, perjury and other crimes against the US and the electoral process
@UKMoments Why doesn't Hillary return to the woods? Read from a book of fiction. Author couldn't vouch for authenticity and didn't interview anyone in cabinet. She'll be going to prison soon along with Mueller, Comey, McNabe, Lynch, Bill, Podesta bros, Huma, Rosenstein et al. Lex Rex.
@Franklin_Graham @Joy_Villa Long-time pro-lifer myself. Joy should run for Congress in FL. We need women such as herself. Sign Franklin's petition that "I have hope in America, because of Jesus Christ."
@thehill Cook's 97% consensus is incorrect as demonstrated by Friends of Science's analysis. 9 inaccuracies in Gore's doc. eg. Mann Hockey Stick according to Dr. Jake Herbert. 1,300 peer-reviewed papers by climate scientist prove that alarmists are wrong. Watch doc. "Climate Hustle." etc.
@mmgonline @thehill I presented the evidence about the expanding and contracting of the polar regions. Research it for yourself.
@CNN Muckraker and couldn't vouch for the truth of this book. Didn't interview any cabinet members. Bannon exposed as the traitor who tried to oust Trump via the 25th. Fired from WH position and @BreitbartNews !
@thehill Satellite photos and an expedition to the polar caps showed that they've increased. At times they contract. True science not the climate changer fake science alarmists.
@Morning_Joe How about election expert &amp; Dem Bev Harris? Dr. Pieznecik (inspiration for Clancy's books, CIA operative and former Deputy Secretary of State, psychiatrist served in 5 Presidential administrations), Danney Williams? Juanita Broadrick? Rodger Stone, 1st campaign manager for Trump?
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe #DemsDreamersShutdown
@nytmike @Morning_Joe @Comey Comey, Mueller, Hillary, Lynch, Obama et al are all going to jail. Barak is retaining legal counsel. Thought Sec. Clinton would win and continue the cover-up. Greater than Watergate! Lex Rex!!
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe @Sen_JoeManchin Should retire as he'll be humiliated and defeated in the election. Retire and return to the swamp in IL Senator.
@Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Why do you use this term that was coined by the CIA re: JFK assassination. Go to the National Archives website and find out that we've been vindicated. Revealed that MLK Jr. was a Communist. Do your job and report it Mika and Joe!
@Morning_Joe @TimRyan 81 major promises and 100 minor ones already kept. Even my hero Ronald Reagan wasn't able to get some much accomplished in 1 year. He has the same approval ratings as Obama did at this time.
@Morning_Joe @TIME "Time" isn't a true mag anymore. A leftist mouthpiece. Naming Hilary's book, "What Happened?" as the best non-fiction book of the year? It's more like pure fiction! She was relegated to the toilet paper section of Cosco at book signing. I'll get it for a buck from library sale.
@Morning_Joe @TIME @POTUS owned Davos!. Oligarchs, globalists, elites and technocrats aren't happy. Business leaders are and with invest in the US to MAGA!!
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe @LACaldwellDC Big mistake. But Dems and Dreamers are idiots, because they want more. Donkeys will die as a political party like the Whigs. Good riddance. Republicrats will be ousted also, like Ryan, McCain, Graham and McConnell. 3rd parties will replace Dems, which is great for our republic!
@JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Cite specific sections of the US Constitution that POTUS is violating. I think you need to read it. Didn't you take an oath to defend it when you were in Congress. How about the intern who was mysteriously found dead in your office?
@tribelaw @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Mr. Tribe, as many Congresspersons have stated the Nunez's memo has the explosive info that will bring down Obama, Mueller, DNC, Hillary, Comey, Rosenstein et al for treason, obstruction of justice and interference with our electoral process. The real colluders with the Russians.
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe Business leaders will invest in America. Globalists, elites, technocrats, oligarchs like Soros aren't happy. Globalism is over! The leaders and journalists were in awe when a true Alpha male entered the room!
@JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Check out the redacted FISA Ct document posted on the Office of National Intelligence's website. Rep. Nunez's memo reveals the redacted info. Obama, Comey, Rosenstein, Lynch, Mueller, Clintons et all will all go to prison. Lex Rex!! Barak now retaining legal counsel.
@Morning_Joe Congrats to both you and Mika in winning the People's Choice for Fake News anchors. Quite the honor. @MSNBC behind Nick at Night in the ratings. No one believes your fake news. Armchair psychiatry condemned by the APA. Violates the Goldwater rule.
@JeffFlake Sen. you're smart to leave public life as you'd definitely lose the election. POTUS's accomplishments are unprecedented, better than my hero Ronald Reagan in 1 yr. @realDonaldTrump's approval ratings are the same as Obama's at this time, despite all the opposition.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Rep. Schiff, the Dems are putting their very survival ahead of the country. You all don't want the Nunez memo giving the redacted details from the document released on the Office of National Intelligence website.  Obama, Comey, Mueller, Lynch Clintons et al will go to prison.
@SenGillibrand Science is on the side of the pro-lifers. Harvard Medical School's criteria for life, neonatal medicine &amp; ultrasounds. It's  murder of innocent babies. Planned Parenthood founded by racist Sanger, is destroying the black community. They sell aborted baby parts (Project Veritas).
@TheDemocrats Cite the passage(s) in the Constitution for us Donkeys!!
@JudgeJeanine Smart &amp; beautiful. AG Sessions needs to appoint you as Special Counsel to prosecute Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, Podesta, Huma, Obama, Comey, Mueller, Lynch, Holder et al. Lex Rex. Rep. Nunez memo along with the already redacted FISA Court document will send these criminals to jail.
@foxandfriends My home state of CA's public schools have also become leftist laboratories that turn out unthinking students without the basic skills. In college, more Marxist indoctrination. I know as I taught in CA  as this was taking a turn for the worse. Big difference when I was a kid.
@CNN Another celebrity who knows nothing about politics &amp; repeats the lies of  Durbin, who did the same after a private meeting with  @BarackObama . Everyone else denies that POTUS used those words. False narrative &amp; fake news from the winner of People's Choice Fake News Network, CNN
@JoyAnnReid No matter who responds to the SOTU address, it'll be the same sorry lies, false narrative &amp; fake news talking points. Obama et al are about to go down for treason. Rep. Nunez FISA memo. Redacted report on Office of National Intelligence website. Trump should declassify in speech.
@ClintonFdn Violates charity laws, IRS regulations, pay-for-play abuse of power, bilking of Haitian people to the tune of $2 billion dollars by the @BillClinton @@HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton crime family. (Cossi. WND articles, and Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.) These crooks are going to jail!
@AlanDersh Did you see the photo of Obama with Farrakhan? The photographer admitted that he suppressed it as he thought it would hurt his political career.
@realDonaldTrump Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Van Jones can't be confused with the facts as it's contrary to their worldview. Thanks, Mr. President for getting more done in your first year than my hero Reagan did.
@SeashoreMary @perfectsliders I has to be released as it's classified &amp; it names, names, such as Obama. House votes on releasing it to the public  Monday. The redacted FISA document for the background is on the Office of National Intelligence's website, which Rep. Schiff (D) from CA says we can't understand.
@cher Used to love you on the old Sonny and Cher show. And some of your movies too. But to lecture Press Sec. Sanders as to how she dresses is laughable. She's not a part of a Mormon cult. Remember some of the really outrageous costumes you've worn over the years? Really?
@realDonaldTrump Chuckie lost big time! Don't let Miller sell you down the river by not fulfilling promise to not grant DACA beneficiaries amnesty or citizenship. Revoke Napolitano memo! No law in place! Get wall built now! Use foreign aid to Mexico to start funding it.
@HillaryClinton So how about Juanita Broadrick who was raped by your husband? How about Sally Miller? Paula Jones? Why do you enable and cover up for his disgusting behavior, similar to your buddy Weinstein? Hypocrite. You're going to jail, so you'll be someone else's bitch.
@MrSebastienB What things has @RealAlexJones that's not true? He admits when he's wrong. Don't parrot Dems, HRC, Obama, MSM, late night talk show hosts' et al fake news and false narratives without proof. His reports along with interviews break tomorrow's news today. Dare you check it out.
@CNN Another fake poll. Won't you guys at CNN ever learn?
@CNN Bernie's a Socialist who sold out to endorse Hillary, even though she stole the nomination. His wife ran a VT college into the ground &amp; was fired. Sen Sanders has million dollar homes and a PAC that receives corporate funding that he decried. Hypocrite!
@CNN Oprah has too many skeletons &amp; pic shows her frenching Weinstein's ear. Biden has countless videos of him groping little girls; AG Sessions had to slap away his hand when he was trying so with his granddaughter. Secret Service agent states that Biden is similar to Weinstein.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Read RFK Jr's article citing study about mercury in vacs. Whistleblower in FDA exposed their cover-up and collusion with vac companies. My close friend died from flu shot. Read inserts for vacs which include side effect, DEATH. Elites and many medical professionals don't vac.
@AnnEK04 Present hard core studies &amp; evidence to support your contention. Read researcher &amp; prof Jon Trots seminal book, "More Gun, Less Crime." Leftist prof tried to refute his findings over ten years. He couldn't do it. Abortion an American holocaust. Has destroyed the black community.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats I do give regularly to the  Oliver Gospel Mission, Salvation Army and Samaritans Purse. @ClintonFdn bilked Haitians $2 billion. They despise them down there. Clintons and their cronies are evil, heartless, soulless, money grubbers. Going to jail (Clinton Cash doc. and book).
@NBCPolitics Mueller involved in Russian collusion, Uranium 1, Fusion GPS and possible obstruction of justice as deleted texts, Nunez memo giving the details of the redacted FISO report on the Office of National Intelligence website.
@perfectsliders I've already skimmed through the background info found on the Office of National Intelligence's website which is the FISA court memo. Rep. Nunez's memo gives the redacted information. Check it out.
@CNN CNN  reporters and staff need to read the background in redacted report posted on the Office of National Intelligence website. Nunez memo details missing blanks. All hell is going to break lose as indictments, prosecutions &amp; jail time is handed down to Obama, Comey, Mueller etc.
@RepAdamSchiff Rep. Schiff, POTUS told Davos attendees what he promised &amp; we Americans support this. We've seen the tangible results which he outlined. Did you watch the speech? Get on board. or be left behind. Can't wait to see you ousted in the midterms along with other Dems &amp; Republicrats.
@SenateGOP Go even rather to stimulate our economy and pass the FairTax (https://t.co/1fUVwKwviH). Also consult with Citizens Against Government Waste to make the necessary cuts. Don't add unrelated pork belly riders to bills. Expose Donkeys when they do so.
@EdKrassen @BillClinton He does &amp; gives his own funds to help, while the @ClintonFdn bilked Haitians out of $2 billion for their own benefit. Mention their names &amp; the people will want to punch you out. Trump helped finance Sen. Rand Paul MD's mission trips to restore Haitian's eyesight's. Clintons?
@BillClinton President Clinton, you and the family are going to prison. You can't avoid justice anymore. Lex Rex!! Enjoy your extended vacation in a cell with another Bubba, who'll make you his girlfriend. I do pray for you &amp; hope you'll repent and Prison Fellowship will be able to help you.
@tj_lsudad @amjoyshow Obama was a hypocrite as he pushed climate change based on fake science. (97% consensus is  0.5% based on expert analysis by Friends of Science; 1,300 peer-reviewed expert papers raise doubts re: problem etc.) His travels left huge carbon footprints especially travels to HI.
@amjoyshow Ms. Reid, really this is trivial news eg. 2 scoops of ice cream, drinking water, hand signals etc. Donates salary to @USTreasury &amp; @usedgov Hoover last to do this. Report news of, redacted memo from Office of National Intelligence on website &amp; Nunez details? Sure you can get it.
@Okibutt @realDonaldTrump Dr. Lee who's not licensed to practice in CT has never examined POTUS face to face or administered any psychometrics. She's been condemned by the APA and Yale University has distanced themselves from her. She violated the Goldwater rule and professional ethics.
@BarbaraNavarro @airbagmoments Oh, you're a psychiatrist who's examined HUD Sec. Ben Carson MD? Armchair psychiatry condemned by APA. Violates the Goldwater rule and professional ethics.
@JeffreyGuterman Fire Dr. Lee for violating professional ethics, namely the Goldwater rule. APA condemns armchair "psychiatry." She's also not licensed to practice in CT.
@Scherazad100 @RobertAngelo @JoyAnnReid Professor Lee not licensed in CT to practice. Violated Goldwater rule and APA condemns armchair "psychiatry." Trump scored perfect score on cognitive test by physician who also served Obama.
@TeaPartyOrg Lock them Up!
@kylegriffin1 Contributing to censorship. Neutrality is a false narrative. Wake-up and oust your governor Montanans!
@MsPackyetti Millions of us Americans are feed up with the Donkey's identity politics. It's a failed strategy. They'll lose big time in the midterms. We'll oust Republicrats too. Drain the Swamp! MAGA!
@SoCalSports4You @NBCLA Go @Lakers!!
@THEHermanCain Prime example of the logical conclusion of Socialism. Supported you for president and heard you speak at the National FairTax conference in Atlanta.
@RealJamesWoods When I and 20,000 people protested the film, "The Temptation of Christ"  at Universal Studios, we cleaned everything up. The police remarked that it was unusual for protestors to do so. MSM didn't cover it.
@SenKamalaHarris Sen. Harris, get your facts right as it's 3 million whom you Donkeys need to survive according to Hillary's Campaign Communications Director in a memo.
@SenatorTimScott Amen brother! Winthrop University study demonstrates that public schools would greatly benefit from vouchers.
@WhiteHouse 81 major and 100 minor promises kept! Unprecedented1
@SenWarren Your party's rule and policies ruined Puerto Rico as they have in our inner cities.
@TheNewSchool @CTZNWELL Unemployed QB who doesn't vote should do something tangible with his millions to help the  people trapped in the inner cities that have been destroyed by Dem policies. Former player Jim Brown is and has been doing something.
@PublicSeminar @TheNewSchool @MerriamWebster Gay commentator and author Milo makes case that support of radical feminism according to the gold standard Pew research has declined drastically. Feminists align with Muslims who oppress women.
@cynthialawson @TheNewSchool @FinchelsteinF APA condemns armchair "psychiatry" Yale prof isn't licensed to practice in CT.
@TheNewSchool @FinchelsteinF Scored 30 out of 30 on the cognitive test administered by Obama's excellent physician. Another loss for the alt left, Republicrats, Never Trumpers,, MSM, Dems, Antifa, BLM, academia, feminists and hard leftist students.
@TheNewSchool @NewSchoolHealth Flu shots are only have a 10% rate of success. Every time I got a shot, I get the flu. My close friend died from it.
@BlueKomand @pink_lady56 @Flowerp94313730 Some place called New School where she teaches digital storytelling. More properly framed as how to perpetuate false narratives on social media.
jennifer begeal  an alt leftist who has no proof supporting her belief in abortion on demand. The Harvard Med School criteria for life, ultrasounds &amp; neonatal medicine all prove that she's on the wrong side of science. She wants to deny !st Amendment rts to anyone who disagrees.
@NBCLA My youngest sister's alma mater. Great school! I attended rival Whittier College. Another great independent private liberals arts college.
@mashable Check out the film, "Born in China" as it's got a great story about a baby panda and her mom.
@SarahPalinUSA Run, Sarah, Run for Alaska's US Senate seat. We need you to help advance President Trump's agenda and MAGA!!
@JohnJamesMI I heartily endorse Mr. James for the US Senate. And I encourage the great people of Michigan to give and join his campaign. Elect John to help Trump continue to MAGA!! Mark Peter, MA University English, Film, Culture &amp; Debate instructor
@SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan, I thought you were going to resign, since you saw the writing on the wall, rather than being humiliated and losing your seat or at least Speakership after midterms. Millions of us Americans want all the establishment, globalist, Republicat obstructionists to go!
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams Juan, you're a liberal Dem who I really respect. Watched you with Hugh Hewitt together yrs ago. Totally agree with your stand on vouchers. Don't worry POTUS will hit a homerun!
@IngrahamAngle Comey, Mueller et al are going to prison for collusion, treason and obstruction of justice. Laughable that he's teaching an ethics course at his alma mater, William and Mary College. Also alma mater of our 3rd president Thomas Jefferson. Tom would be spinning in his grave.
@CNN The more I learn about the globalist, Republicrat Bush family, the more I lose what little respect I ever had for them. Regret my vote for Poppie (HW), but worked for Dr. Alan Keyes' 2000 presidential bid. In general voted for Constitution both times (Stone. Bush Crime Family.)
@VP I hope to travel to Israel with my wife to see the biblical sites and where Jesus walked someday. Jerusalem to be the new home of our new embassy.
@SenWarren Ms. Pocahontas, sorry actually you have no Native American blood. Your ancestors involved in rounding them up during Trail of Tears. Why are you asking MA residents to sign-up for the failed healthcare plan of Republicrat Gov. Mitt Romney, which was the template for Obamacare?
@AP When will AP investigate real Russian collusion re: fake dossier &amp; Uranium I:  GPS Fusion Company, Steele, Clintons, Podesta, Mueller, Comey et al? Smoking gun memo will be released to the public. Heads will roll and people will go to prison!!
@CNN CNN's president fired &amp; some reporters admitted on air that the whole Russian collusion was a total lie &amp; hoax. Need to investigate the real collusion re: U 1 involving @ClintonFdn @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton @johnpodesta &amp; Mueller. Comey &amp; Mueller protected HRC.
Donkeys lost &amp; got nothing from the #DemDreamerShutdown. Trump was willing to negotiate a pathway to citizenship for 800,000 and make it easier for others to become legal citizens. Lost opportunity. Dems will lose in midterms &amp; die like Whigs. 3rd Parties will take their place.
@KristiMac2014 I see that you're a figure skating fan and probably participate in the sport. Also you follow the hard left. I follow both sides and debate. Your ad hominins really don't advance your arguments. Use evidence, academic studies, stats, and logic to make your points.
@KristiMac2014 March for Life had more participants, but MSM ignored them due to their racist, materialist, leftist, unscientific, fake medicine, fascist beliefs in abortion. The pussy hat feminists are in the same boat.
@Alyssa_Milano @KristiMac2014 Alyssa, loved you in the show "Who's the Boss" with "Taxi" alum Tony Danza. I always cringe when hard leftist celebrities try to make arguments without evidence, academic studies, or logic to support their opinions. Ad hominins are the most common logical fallacies.
@SenateDems @SenSchumer Watch during the midterms as Dems lose big league. Headline: "Donkeys Die as a Party, Go the Way of the Whigs!" Dreamers are losing sympathy from millions of Americans, who are sick of paying billions for non-citizens. 	#DemsDreamersShutdown
@JohnCornyn Dems will be hurt in all the states along with Republicrats. We Americans are going to fire all those neocon, progressive, Never-Trumpers, Socialist, globalist, establishment, crony capitalist, banking and special interest puppets in Congress!
@ChinaDailyUSA Happy New Year of the Dog Everyone!
@mattmfm @clairecmc #DemsDreamersShutdown will pay dearly at the polls this year. Donkeys will go the way of the Whigs. Replaced by 3rd Parties and a New GOP. Great for our republic!!
@rmayemsinger Why do you ally yourself with the oppressive religion of Islam and think it's so virtuous to wear a covering?
@TIME Congrats on receiving the Fake News Award.
@RepJoeKennedy @POTUS Don't make accusations without proof that would hold up in a court of law. You're perpetuating the talking points of the Donkeys, leftist, Antifa, BLM, feminists, Hollywood, MSM, academia, zombie students which are all false narratives and fake news.
@CBSNews True scientist as he dared to defy the religion and fake science of global warming/climate change. 1,300 peer-reviewed papers by climate scientists agree.
@LakerGirls @Lakers are my team since the days of @MagicJohnson
@SebGorka @Nigel_Farage @BarackObama Lock Him Up! You should be back in the WH helping POTUS to MAGA.
@SheriffClarke Lock the all up!! You should be in appointed to the DHS or FBI.
@VP @netanyahu Honoring the Abrahamic Covenant!
@marcorubio Lincoln quoted this Scripture also.
@GovMikeHuckabee @DonaldJTrumpJr Dems will pay dearly at the polls in the midterms. Dreamers losing the sympathy of millions of Americans. Dems need illegal aliens to keep alive as HRC Campaign Communications Director revealed in a memo. Donkeys will die like the Whigs. Replaced by 3rd Parties &amp; a reformed GOP.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @adamschiff #DemsDreamersShutdown
@DonaldJTrumpJr Love your Dad as he's MAGA! Pray for him and others in the adm. Also pry the Republicrats like my Sen. Lindsay Graham. Should fire globalists McMaster, Kelly &amp; Tillerson. Appoint Dr. Alan Keyes to State, Dr. Steve Pieczenik to NSA &amp; Mike Cernovich Chief of Staff
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Love smart &amp; beautiful Judge Jeanine. Trump should ask AG Sessions to appoint you as Special Prosecutor to investigate &amp; indict re: Russian collusion, fake dossier, U 1, wiretapping @BarackObama  @ClintonFdn @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton @johnpodesta Mueller et al.
@KristiMac2014 @thespybrief How about the, @BillClinton @HillaryClinton, @johnpodesta and Mueller's true collusion with the Russians via the fake dossier.
@colbertlateshow Stephen, Congratulations  on receiving the People's Choice Fake News Award's Best Entertainer of the Year Award!!!
@StephenColbert_ @realDonaldTrump Crude, Junior High, potty mouth humor. How immature, Stephen. I used to think you were pretty articulate.
@StephenColbert_ How about those fake polls that you and your cronies relied upon and thought that Crooked Hillary would be Madam President?  Remember the "Newsweek" cover featuring the false narrative?
@StephenColbert_ Provide 50 examples, in context without editorializing or shut up. Can't lie and then hide behind the curtain of comedy like disgraced Al Franken.
@StephenColbert_ When will you apologize and retract your statements about the fake dossier and Russian collusion?  Do a monologue about Podesta, Clintons, Mueller and others re: Russian collusion. You're just a mouthpiece for fake news and false narratives. Ratings will tank.
@colbertlateshow Colbert was funnier during his news satire on Comedy Central. Would have loved to be on his show when I run for Congress. Needs to apologize and retract statements about the fake dossier and Russian collusion. Just uninformed political ranting.
@FoxNews @LukasMikelionis Illegitimate Senator from AL due to election fraud. Judge Moore suing. AL courts told county officials to not keep records to compare against voting machine tallies. Watched returns, one county suddenly flipped. It was carried by Trump overwhelmingly.
@SarahPalinUSA Run, Sarah, Run for US Senate!!
@SenJohnThune #DemsDreamersShutdown.
Let's get a #DemsDreamersShutDown going. Dems will pay at the midterm polls. Dreamers will lose sympathy from millions of Americans for their part in the Shutdown.
@dorthey2750 @SenCortezMasto @RepGutierrez @LindseyGrahamSC I mean anti-establishment, Populists, Libertarians, Classical Liberals, Constitutionalists, True Conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul.
@SarahPalinUSA Gov. Palin I'd like you to consider running for the US Senate seat in AK. We need more people in the Senate to further President Trump's agenda. MAGA!! Drain the Swamp!!
@JimDeMintI worked on your campaigns for the US Senate and met you at an event to support Mrs. Shealy for SC Senate. I told you how I appreciated your work &amp; to continue standing up to GOP leadership. I'd like you to consider running against Sen. Graham, if Pastor Burns doesn't.
@RepGutierrez @MoveOn @SenBooker @SenSanders @SenKamalaHarris @RepJoeKennedy MoveOn, funded by billionaire George Soros. His NGOs in  Hungary are under investigation. PM has issued a warrant for his arrest as has Russia. He interfered in the Ukraine &amp; brought Bank of Britain down. Nazi collaborator (60 minutes interview) Funded BLM &amp; Antifa. Lock him up!
@KamalaHarris @RepGutierrez I'm sympathetic with the New CA movement as Dems continue to destroy my home state. Dems will pay dearly for shutdown in the midterms. Dreamers are losing the sympathy of millions of Americans who are fed up with providing welfare for non-citizens. MAGA!!
@SenCortezMasto @RepGutierrez @LindseyGrahamSC My Senator, Republicrat neocon Lindsay Graham will be ousted in the next election. Fellow South Carolinians, vote him out of office. We deserve better leadership from the Palmetto State. Draft Pastor Mark Burns or former Senator Jim DeMint to replace him. Drain the Swamp! MAGA!!
@RepGutierrez @CNN @BrookeBCNN Mexico has a wall bigger and better than the one Trump proposes to keep out Salvadorians, Guatemalans and others from Central Americans. We helped to pay for it. Why can't we defend our borders like every other nation? Dems want illegal aliens for votes, otherwise they'll die.
@RepGutierrez Many Dreamers completed fraudulent paperwork, didn't ever go to college and are over the age of 30 years old. So disingenuous!
@NancyPelosi @RepGutierrez Your party and Dreamers will pay dearly for the DonkeyDreamersShutdown. Millions of us Americans will punish Dems and Republicrats by turning you out at the polls. Bye Bye! Drain the Swamp. MAGA!!
@RepGutierrez @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos Dems will pay for the shutdown along with Dreamers as they lose sympathy and the support of millions of Americans. We will oust not only Dems, but Republicrats like, McConnell, Ryan, McCain and Graham as well. Drain the swamp and MAGA!!
@RepGutierrez @DickDurbin Rep. Gutierrez, please stop the false narrative that POTUS is racist, bc he won't give into ur party's demands. HRC's Communications Director's memo reveals that Dems need illegal aliens to survive. LBJ was truly racist &amp; ur party has racist history (D'Sousa. Hillary's America..)
@U2 Lost all respect for you guys as your video calls POTUS racist and a Nazi wt no proof. Take a poly sci class and learn the terms. Bono  gives 1% of his charity monies to those who need it. Keeps rest. Clinton Fdn gives little more. Claims to be Christian. Materialist hypocrite.
Lost respect for Bono, due to music video calling @realDonaldTrump racist &amp; Nazi, inciting violence etc with no evidence. Claims to be a Christian, but according to "Daily Mail" only gives 1% charity monies to those in need. At least @ClintonFdn gives a little bit more. Hypocrite
@HillaryClinton Nothing but feminist fascists, who want to kill babies and future women. Uninspiring. Generation Z is rejecting all these false narratives and fake news. Unlike millennials: get useful degrees, work, don't live with folks, protest for worthy causes, Conservative and Christians.
@murrelljw @HouseDemocrats @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @ChelseaClinton @HumaAbedin @BarackObama @johnpodesta Mueller, Comey, and others are all going to prison for treason and collusion with the Russians, pay-for-play and  @ClintonFdn  corruption (Schweitzer. Clinton Cash.)
@JohnJamesMI @FoxNews Brother John, just contributed to your campaign. We need more conservative patriots like yourself to serve with my US Senator Tim Scott. I'm trying to get Pastor Mark Burns to run to replace RINO Republicrat Sen. Lindsay Graham. Hope to serve in the House in the future myself.
@angela_rye My Senator is called "Uncle Tom" "sellout" etc. by the black community due to his Conservatism. Black Caucus won't let him attend mtgs. Racism and bigotry! Proves many progressives &amp; Dems are the true racists. (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: Secret History of the Democratic Party)
@angela_rye @GDouglasJones Mr. Jones is the illegitimate US Senator from AL due to voter fraud. Reason Judge Moore is suing. Watched election results &amp; suddenly a county flipped. It was carried by Trump overwhelmingly. Cts mandated that counties couldn't keep records of voting machines to check for fraud.
@angela_rye HUD Sec. Dr. Carson grew up in abject poverty in Detroit. He understands what's needed to help inner city poor. Charities, churches, faith based organizations &amp; private sector are more effective than DC. eg. Perkins Harrambee House in Pasadena, CA. Reason for HUD budget cuts.
@angela_rye It's okay to say "Merry Christmas" again.
@angela_rye Hardy congrats to your grandmother! She'd be a fascinating person to talk to regarding all her experiences over these past 100 years. What's her secret as to how she's lived for a century?
@angela_rye Several years ago Oprah met with Turner, Gates and Rockefeller, "Happy Billionaires Club" to discuss depopulation of the world which was even reported in MSM. Good human being? Absolutely not! Check it out.
@angela_rye Did you see photo Oprah Frenching her bud Weinstein?
@OnPointRadio @angela_rye Oprah won't run for POTUS as she has too many skeletons. Talks about sexual harassment and rape, but won't condemn her rapist, pedophile buddy Harv Weinstein. Photo of her tonguing his ear.
@angela_rye Racist and bigoted remark levied against white evangelicals. He reads KJV, which you probably also use.
@BrennanCenter @angela_rye King lifted parts of pastor's '52 GOP Convention speech for his "I Have a Dream" on the  Mall. 10 yr review of his papers, speeches &amp; dissertation at U. of Chicago showed he plagiarized. Note was placed on his PhD thesis stating so. Mrs. King  briefed &amp; said nothing in response.
@gregorycendana @angela_rye @StrategicIMPACT @UNITEDWEDREAM Go to the National Archives website for some very interesting info about MLK Jr. Check it out.
@BrookeBCNN @angela_rye @realDonaldTrump Hillary's racist! Likes to liberally use the "n" word according to her traveling chef. Bill commented that years ago Obama would be carrying your suitcases. Racist family!! Dems have long history of racism. (D'Sousa. Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party.)
@angela_rye How will it contribute to less racism? How do you assess for tangible results?
@rashadrobinson @angela_rye Huffington Post? Even founder Arianna left due to their terrible reporting. Fake news. Do you quote Southern Poverty Center's biased stats?
@Kaepernick7 @angela_rye @StephenCurry30 Unemployed QB for the knee controversy . Contributed to Americans abandoning the NFL. Record loss of attendance at games. I won't watch NFL ever again. Colin doesn't even vote. Fans flames of racism. Should do something constructive to fight racism, through his own foundation.
@Joy_Villa @adoption Longtime pro-life. Protested to shut down the last abortionist in my hometown, CA. Helped found a pro-life group. Attended many rallies in SC. Heard Norma McCovey (Roe) talk about how feminists used her. She became a Christian and fought for the pro-life cause until her death.
@pastormarkburns @Joy_Villa Pastor Burns, you need to challenge Republicrat Sen. Lindsay Graham for his seat. We've been trying to get rid of him for years. As a South Carolinian, I'll do what I can to help from the other side of the world. We need people like you and Joy serving in our Congress to MAGA!
@Joy_Villa So many black conservatives face this intolerance and bigotry. Eg. my best friend from college. Ambassador Alan Keyes PhD was ignored by the MSM during his 2000 run for the GOP presidential nomination. It was my great honor to work as a volunteer for his campaign.
@Joy_Villa @realDonaldTrump Amen sister, amen!
@Joy_Villa Such a shame that we receive such hatred from the progressive leftists. They've been brainwashed by the MSM, Hollywood, and academia. Need to pray for our enemies.
@Joy_Villa @davidbeckam8 @Goyard Great to remain friends with your ex's. One of mine even came to my wedding. Pray that see too will find a great man to marry as she deserves it!
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Read Verna Sharav's articles as she exposed widespread corruption in vac industry. She found decades of fraudulent activity. Conflicts of interest, violations of ethics &amp; requirements of science: transparency, full disclosure &amp; sharing data for independent scientific assessment.
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton Read Verna Sharav's articles exposing the widespread corruption within the vac industry. She uncovered decades of fraud. Conflicts of interest &amp; violations of ethics &amp; scientific requirements of transparency, full disclosure &amp; sharing data for independent scientific assessment.
@murrelljw @HouseDemocrats Project Veritas' sting proved that Dems' business is stealing elections. #1 aide to Hill, Huma confirmed this in the video. Notable examples are JFK &amp; LBJ. Actually, big fan of Kennedy for cutting taxes and trying to eliminate the Fed. Expert Bev Harris proved HRC stole 5 states.
@ajoneida Who ruled Puerto Rico? How about Chicago? etc. All Democrats whose failed policies destroyed them! Especially the African-American community. Have observed this first hand in Compton, CA.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats Just stating the facts and not trying to toot my horn, Miss Charlotte.
@Bakari_Sellers @ajoneida Millions will oust the establishment Republicrats in the midterms. We want true Conservatives, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and Classical Liberals to help MAGA!!
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats Sorry, I triggered you Charlotte. Just asked for specific sections from the Constitution to support your arguments.
@WhiteHouse Long-time pro-lifer. I've protested &amp; we shut-down the remaining abortionist in my hometown. Took part in SC rallies &amp; heard Norma McCovey (Roe). Spoke of how the feminists used her. She became a Christian and then fought for the pro-life cause. Thx Mr. President for your speech.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Mr. President, don't allow the Republicrats to compromise re:  2.6 million DACA (USA TODAY) beneficiaries. Dems need the votes to survive as HRC's Campaign Communications Director's memo reveals. Tell DHS Sec. Nielsen to reverse the memo. Why take it to the cts?, It's not a law!
@thehill @JohnCornyn Mr. Jones is the illegitimate senator from AL. Voter fraud, so Judge Moore is suing.  Watched returns &amp; I saw one county flip, which Trump carried in the election by a huge margin.  Chief Justice Moore was smeared with no evidence of wrong doing. As my letter in USA TODAY proved.
@JohnCornyn Millions will oust establishment Republicrats  in the midterms. Obstructing POTUS agenda eg. the wall. Donkeys need the 2.6 million DACA (USA TODAY) beneficiaries to survive as a party. To be replaced by Green, Libertarian, Constitution &amp; Reform Parties. Healthy for the republic.
@HillaryClinton Ms. Clinton, you &amp; your cronies along with Obama's are going to jail for the fake dossier/ wiretapping. You for the server, Clinton Foundation pay for play (Schweitzer. "Clinton Cash." &amp; Corsi's WDN.) along with 22 other criminal acts (Judicial Watch). Like Watergate!! Lex Rex!!
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer Americans will oust establishment Republicrats in the midterms. OBSTRUCTION! Shutdown gov. at your peril. Dems need the 2.6 million DACA (USA TODAY) beneficiaries to prevent their death as a party like the Whigs. HRC's  Campaign Communications Director's memo confirmed this.
@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @RepMarthaRoby Americans will oust the establishment Republicrats, like Ryan in the midterms. They obstruct the Trump agenda, eg. the wall. Dems need the 2.6 million DACA (USA TODAY)  beneficiaries of the DHS memo to not die as party like the Whigs. HRC's Comm Director's memo confirms this.
@amjoyshow You really trust these fake polls?. Sample taken? Questions posed? Methodology? World leaders fawn over POTUS, even leftist, globalist President of France wants to get in good with the true Alpha Male of the free world. My wife's BFF from college in PRC told me Xi kisses his ass.
@KensingtonRoyal @ObamaFoundation @BBCRadio4 @BarackObama Harry's got a man crush, which we know you like. (Corsi. Obama Nation.)
@ObamaFoundation @BarackObama Mr. Obama, in 2018 you'll be indicted, prosecuted and put in prison for illegally wiretapping. 1st occupant of the WH to be found guilty of a felony. All your  friends &amp; expensive lawyers can't get you out of this one. Enjoy cooling your heels in a cell.
@ObamaFoundation Even fellow liberals don't want your center in the neighborhood. Regressive. We know the foundation is modeled after the corrupt Clinton Foundation. Dr. Jerome Corsi has investigated it  as have others. Read Dr. Corsi's NYTimes bestseller, "Obama Nation" @ https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm
@RobertW0359 @timkaine Vote Republicrats out and keep true Conservatives, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Populists in to MAGA. Millions will do so in the midterms. Count on it!!
@timkaine Sen. Kaine, you and Dems need to stop the obstruction. We know the Sen. Durbin lied as he did after an Obama mtg. Get on board the Trump train or get left behind and lose more seats in Congress. Americans will oust all the Republicrats during the midterms. Count on it.
@TheDemocrats Donkeys and other establishment Republicrats will lose big time in the midterms. Dems as a party are on their last gasp and will surely die like the Whigs. Replaced by Green, Reform, Libertarian and Constitution Parties. GOP is being reformed. All good for our republic.
@ObamaFoundation Even liberals don't want the Obama Presidential Center in the neighborhood.
@TheDemocrats DOJ and FBI under Obama were in collusion with the Clintons to prevent prosecution. Remember AG Lynch's meeting with Bill? Heard the tape and Secret Service agent collaborates that collusion took place. Drain the swamp and lock them all up!
@ananavarro The traitor Bannon brought in the generals and other establishment Republicrats in a plot to invoke the 25th to oust POTUS. Exposed and ousted himself. Steve's huge ego lead him to believe he could replace Trump. And that evangelicals would support him. He's now irrelevant.
Jake, it was a drunken neighbor who's responsible according to news reports. Here's something you and your staff can investigate. Were the Moore accusers paid by Dem operatives like in the case of Trump's? Check it out if you're a real journalist or just fake news. https://t.co/geXBcfn79p
News reports indicate that it was a drunken neighbor who started the fire. You wonder if Moore's accusers were paid by Dem operatives like they did with Trump's accusers. Just saying. https://t.co/POViQGpB9D
@palmeritulin1 @HouseDemocrats Republicrats controlled by globalists, big corporations, big pharma etc. Oust them all in midterms. Trump will continue to MAGA! Economy on total upswing!!
@TessDeco @HouseDemocrats Oust the Republicrats in the midterms!!
@helensita57 @HouseDemocrats Nope, Republicrats will be ousted in midterms. Donkeys will go way of Whigs and die. Constitution, Libertarian, Green and Reform Parties will replace them. E-mail by former Hillary campaign Communications Director states need DACA and illegals' votes to stay in power. Bye bye!
@LynnRN54 @HouseDemocrats Amen and Amen sister!!!
@Ykati @jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Sorry not a bot like the ones Twitter uses to censor Conservatives, Christians, Trump supporters, Libertarians, Classical Liberals, and Constitutionalists. Matter of time before I get censored by the fascists like I did on Facebook.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats Great, you're one of the few. Probably your public education hadn't been completely taken over by hard leftist, fascist progressives at the time.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats So you memorized the preamble in 8th grade. Cite specific parts  that Trump is violating. I taught Citizenship classes to immigrants, so they could become citizens. We covered it word by word. I constantly refer to my pocket one when leftists perpetuate false narratives about it.
@murrelljw @HouseDemocrats Check WikiLeaks. Project Veritas exposed the fact that Dems engage in election fraud. Huma admitted it also. Stanford study along with Dem and election fraud expert Bev Harris proved that Hillary stole at least 5 states. We know she stole nomination from Bernie via WikiLeaks.
@SenatorTimScott Sen. Scott as my US Senator thanks for your leadership. Keep up the good work despite the racist remarks from the black community directed your way.
@AnnCoulter Cited you book "High Crimes and Misdemeanor to argue against this illogical call to impeach POTUS without any grounds whatsoever.
@BryanFeci @SenateGOP @SenatorTimScott @SenatorLankford @TheAtlantic Constitutionalists, Populists, Libertarians, true Conservatives, Blue Dog Dems will oust the Republicrats in midterms. No grounds to impeach POTUS (Coulter High Crimes and Misdemeanors) Donkeys will die like Whigs &amp; replaced by Green, Reform, Libertarian and Constitution Parties.
@manofmesa @SenateGOP @SenatorTimScott @SenatorLankford @TheAtlantic The establishment, globalist Republicrats are the big problem.
@sandrafornow @SenateGOP @SenatorTimScott @SenatorLankford @TheAtlantic Net Neutrality is a ruse to censor our 1st Amendment freedoms of speech and expression. The Project Veritas sting revealed that Twitter is purposely censoring Christians, Trump supporters, Constitutionalists, Libertarians, and Conservatives.
@SenateGOP @SenatorTimScott @SenatorLankford @TheAtlantic Remember his words that we shouldn't judge a person by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.
@murrelljw @HouseDemocrats Many dreamers completed fraudulent paperwork, never went to college &amp; over the age of 30. Dems  about them as  don't Hillary's former Campaign Communications Director memo said that they only need illegal aliens for the votes. Obama told them to vote in the last election.
@PlaceCharlies @HouseDemocrats He does understand. Do you? Have you ever read the US Constitution? Most Americans and lawmakers haven't.
@HouseDemocrats Republicrats have huge power in both Houses of Congress. Dems couldn't care less about DACA. Hillary's Campaign Communication Director's memo reveals that they only want illegal aliens for the votes. Otherwise they're finished!
@ajoneida @timkaine @DavidBegnaud @CNNPolitics Donkey's were responsible for the miss prior to the hurricane.
@timkaine Franklin Graham's Samaritan Purse is a good charity to contribute to help the good people of Puerto Rico. Don't give to the Clinton Foundation, which bilked Haiti of $2 billion. They hate the Clintons down there. POTUS helped to finance Sen. Paul's medical missions trip there.
@timkaine Remember, Sen. Kaine that the Donkeys are responsible for the mess that Puerto Rico got into prior to the hurricane.
@Rosie310501 @JoyAnnReid The logical fallacy of ad hominin does nothing to further your argument.
@PatriciaLWilso6 @JoyAnnReid Hillary would periodically attend witch's coven meeting in CA according to Bill and Clinton insider Larry Nichols.
@DrDourbine @JoyAnnReid Seriously, does HRC have ANY moral authority? Been following the Clintons for yrs. Wasn't Bill the 1st black prez? More than 22 scandals since AR. Tons of proof from eyewitness accounts, insiders  Larry Nichols, Dick Morris, docs, books, WikiLeaks, Project Veritas, experts etc..
@SailormanLarry @JoyAnnReid That's right. Pure virtue signaling by postmodernists who if they're true to their worldview have absolutely no right to judge or criticize others.
@dodi70 @JoyAnnReid @BravenakBlog @VP @WhiteHouse @charlesharriso5 Does Jesse Jackson pastor a church?
@KevinCWilliams4 @JoyAnnReid Do the "Reverends"  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who fan the flames of racism represent the black community?
@JoyAnnReid Reid's comments are nonsense &amp; a continuation of the false narratives and fake news. POTUS met with MLK Jr's eldest to discuss how to make sure Africans-Americans aren't denied voting rt. MLK Jr's niece, a pastor is a big Trump supporter. In SC Pastor Burns also a huge supporter
@BillGates Serious climate change is a myth. Analysis of Cook's 97% consensus is only 0.5%. 1,500 peer-reviewed studies, articles by climate experts raise doubts. 9 errors in Gore's film. 50 factors contribute to climate change. Actually shortage of CO2. Trillions in taxes will do little.
@AdamSchiffCA Nobody trusts you or the other Donkeys due to the Russian collusion hoax that you tried to foist on Americans. We know that you and others in your failed party that will be destroyed the midterms could care less about DACA as the memo states you need illegals for the votes. Bye
@SenSanders Millions of awake Americans  see behind the Wizard of Oz curtains and we all know this is a move to restrict freedom of speech and expression. The  revelations from Twitter's people  show that they are trying to censor Conservatives, Libertarians, Christians &amp; Constitutionalists
@taylorswift13 My students in PRC are big fans. I tell them to listen to your songs to help improve their English. At the school speech, song &amp; drama competition some of my kids sang, "Wildest Dreams." In my wrap-up speech I thought you'd be proud of their excellent performance.
@GrantDevereaux @SunshineLK10 @NCBrianRinehart @LuvAmerica2016 @HillaryClinton MSM admits Russian collusion all fake news and hoax. Mueller has yet to come up with any evidence. He'll be jailed for U 1. Dem. Bev Harris proved that Hillary stole election in 5 states. Project Veritas stung Donkeys as they admitted that stealing elections was their business.
@rat_conspiracy @MannarinoJoey @HillaryClinton HRC didn't win popular vote as the analysis by Dem and election fraud expert Bev Harris proved. Ms Clinton stole the election in 5 states. Project Veritas exposed Donkey operatives who said Dems are in business of stealing elections as did Huma. JFK and LBJ are notable examples.
@HillaryClinton Using the words of MLK Jr. to whine and complain about Trump? Gender politics, ad hominins, race baiting, virtue signaling, blame shifting, fake news, false narratives, lies and your pen pal, mentor Alinsky's playbook along with Soviet tactics are so old and tiring. Give it up!!
@amjoyshow Bannon the true traitor. Brought generals, establishment Republicrat, Never-Trumpers into WH. Architect of  25th to oust POTUS. His ego propelled him to think that he could replace POTUS. Delusional in thinking evangelicals would support him. Fired from Breitbart. Now irrelevant
@JLangWood @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi Like to hear your facts if you have any to support your perspective. The same donkey talking pts, Alinsky and Soviet playbooks, racism, gender politics, virtue signaling, armchair psychiatry, false narratives, fake news and outright lies are getting really tiring.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Why problematic??
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Read RFK Jr's article re: mercury in vacs from recent study. Friend died from flu shot. Told CVS nurse I'd never get a flu shot ever again. Always got case of bad flu when I did. Studies  cited don't compare non-vac to vac kids. Invalid. Only 1 had credibility. Read vac inserts.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Academic tried 10 yrs to prove that Lott's bk "More Guns, Less Crime" was wrong. Couldn't do it!! Wrote updated edition from the 1st edition that I have. Read it and then pop off.
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton Not online, research found in books and peer-reviewed journals.
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton Logically, each of our postmodern "truths" have = weight, so you can't criticize anyone. I can as I use facts, evidence &amp; have an objective source of truth based on historical, legal, literary, personal, scientific, &amp; logical proof (McDowell. New Evidence That Demands a Verdict.)
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton Typical response when you have no facts and evidence to logically debate your pt. Logical fallacy of ad hominins do nothing to advance your argument.
@JoeNBC Leaked Hillary Campaign Communications Director memo reveals what we all knew. Donkeys want DACA and illegals for votes. Dems will die like Whigs. Bicoastal party replaced by Greens, Reform, Libertarians and the Constitution Party. Republicrats will be ousted in midterms. Bye.
@timkaine Mexico has a wall on their southern border, which we helped to pay for to prevent Guatemalans,  Salvadorians, and others in Central America from entering. Wife's university BFF told me Chinese are being restricted from immigrating to Canada. Why can't we do same as our neighbors?
@jake0149 @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @GreenPartyUS @DemSocialists @4aPeoplesParty False narratives, racism, virtue signaling, gender politics, self-righteousness and obstruction by Dems right from Alinsky's bk "Rules for Radicals," Hill's mentor &amp; subject of Sr. thesis @ Wellesley. Leftist Harvard Law prof says that donkeys are doing the same as Soviets.
@StegallNan @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @GOP Pelosi in speeches and public appearances proves she's a racist and needs to retire and many of her ramblings demonstrate that she must retire and let younger leadership take reigns of the donkeys. Rep. Waters is just as bad.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi Wake up and smell the coffee! No collusion, fake news, hoax as MSM has admitted. Now false narrative is Trump's mental incapacity. Violates Goldwater rule and professional ethics. APA condemns armchair psychiatry for political gain. Y'all are &amp; will lose the dominant narrative.
@maddow POTUS has every rt to refuse Mueller. He'll trap Trump like Gen. Flynn was by FBI. FBI colluded with Clinton. Comey, Mueller, Rosenberg etc. all need to go to jail for Uranium 1. Obama cronies in FBI &amp; DOJ need to be fired.
RT @maddow: New from @PeteWilliamsNBC --		https://t.co/gJALg2FbKw
@AbbyMartin . No evidence. Commies, Antifa, BLM, Clintons, globalists, oligarchy, technocrats, Soros,, MSM all want fascist enslavement.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Conflict of interests. Sample sizes? Longitudianal studies? flawed methodology and collusion with big pharma who make the vaccines.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Katja has nothing to say. Only that it's been debunked several times with no evidence from science. And that I'm a fanatic. Sad.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Afraid science isn't on your side? Don't retreat to safe place. Make the case with scientific evidence that vaccinated kids are healthier.
@ABC Sen. Corker's career is over. Now he retreats into the swamp from wince he came. TN voters would have recalled him anyways.
@FoxNews Dems are finished. Lost every election thus far. Bicoastal party, will die like Whigs. 3rd Parties, like Green and Reform will fill vacuum.
@MMFlint Mikey, only achieved 49% of box office potential. Not a smash. POTUS is already a spectacular hit. Look beyond MSM propaganda for results.
@RepWilson Little girl can rock the hat, you not so much Rep. Wilson.

@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Come on cite the peer reviewed studies by public health experts. Read the side affects, death, autisim etc.
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton She's just an ordinary American peddling an unscientific idea &amp; working for a corrupt foundation that used watered down vaccines worldwide.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Read the study and then debunk it as you're a public health expert, right?
@Lionkatja @jamiereeves1974 @ChelseaClinton Not a fanatic. An enlightened, awake, patriot who challenges the status quo with logic, evidence, facts and truth. Try doing the same.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton I did. Obviously haven't read the entire study &amp; please cite the studies debunking it. The ball's in your court, scary. Note Chelsea's mute.
@Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Still triggered by the vaccine study I cited? Did you read it? You can now go to your safe space and color, then you'll feel better.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Sorry you're both triggered &amp; it blows your worldview. Science does that from time to time as it's always changing. Provide your proof.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Your statement carries no scientific weight as you cite no studies by public health experts debunking it.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Cite your peer-reviewed studies debunking it. Then try to make an informed comment.
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton So what, prove it with peer-reviewed studies by public health experts before commenting. It's a logical fallacy of poisoning the well
@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton So what use scientific evidence, peer-reviewed studies by public health experts to prove your contention before commenting.

@jamiereeves1974 @Lionkatja @ChelseaClinton Read the study and then make your comments.
@realDonaldTrump Americans are tired of Mike at al. They are leftist, fascist, globalist. His show only made 49% potential income. Free hotdogs not enough.

@KodePoet @Morning_Joe @PressSec @MSNBC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Obama was leading us on the fascist socialist pathway of destruction. Hill would've been a 3rd term. Globalist, establishment Republicrats.
@KodePoet Better study US History (Marshal. The Light and Glory) Founders' letters. Even Franklin and Jefferson. Look at Supreme Ct decisions too.
@KodePoet You believe that the news, controlled by the British gov. is truthful? Don't be naïve. Do your own research, compare,  and critical thinking
@KodePoet @BBCWorld Tony, ad hominims do nothing to further your case. Use evidence, logic, and reasoning. Not logical fallacies.
@KodePoet @JoeNBC @HillaryClinton In reality, Clinton's pay-for-play with Russians. Podesta too. Mueller in trouble. Fake dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary, broke 13 laws.
@KodePoet @RepDianaDeGette @HouseDemocrats The globalist, establishment, Keynesian, progessive Brookings Institute's study admits Dem's narrative is wrong. Deficit metric is way off

@WhiteHouse Like the plan, but even better would be to pass the FairTax (www.fairtax). No IRS, tax forms, keep entire paycheck, save Medicare and SS.
@Amy_Siskind Hillary is mentally and physically unfit to be POTUS (Secret Service, Obamas, Morris, Nichols, State Troopers, FBI agent, aides, &amp; Bill)
@Amy_Siskind Rep. Wilson lied and listened in on a private conversation. No class. She's gone in 2018. Why the cowboy hats? She's from FL not TX. Silly!
@Amy_Siskind Hillary for Prison. Lex Rex!
@Amy_Siskind More false narratives from McCain and Siskind
@Amy_Siskind Stop running off at the mouth and make your point with hard evidence. Progressives can't engage in debate and logic. Only know ad hominems.
@Amy_Siskind Amy real class. Don't you have a college education? Can't you express yourself better than the criminals I used to teach in prison?
@Amy_Siskind How about the Clinton Foundation bilking the Haitians? They hate the Clintons there.
@Amy_Siskind Did you get triggered  snowflake? Ohhh poor baby. You can be comfy and color in your safe zone.
@Amy_Siskind Amy, how about giving us 40 examples, in context, without editorializing as to Trump's incompetence and a tryant. Right from Saul's play bk

@RepWilson Please stop with the hats as you live in FL, not a TX cowgirl. Stop the implied POTUS death threats. Words have consequences.
@RepWilson @HouseGOP Ms. Wilson, have you read the plan? Or are you merely giving us the sorry old Dem. talking pts. Present evidence from the proposal, please.
@latimes I remember. Go Dodger blue and win one for LA!!!
@TheEconomist Che was a brutal murderer due to his theistic radical Communist ideology.
@CThunder @AP I wouldn't give a dime to any of these guys. None of them can be trusted, especially Bubba. Give to a reliable group, Samaritans Purse.

@TheEconomist Leftist, Socialist, Communist, Antifa, BLM, progressives are the real fascists.

@KTLA My hometown. Defund the group. Let Hollywood, feminists, Soros, Turner, Gates, Clintons, Zuckerberg, Gore, Sanders, Warren, Buffet fund it.
@WSJ Still dividing our republic and fanning the flames of racism after all these years. After all that's what justifies their existence.
@latimes Read Stone's book on the JFK assassination, available at https://t.co/lG9j5sK6Jm
@TIME Seriously, is this really news of any consequence? Investigate the Clintons, Podesta, Comey, Huma, Lynch and Holder for criminal action.
@realDonaldTrump Another fake poll like those of the presidential campaign. ABC can't be trusted as they spead false narratives.
@USATODAY Bannon is correct as to the havac that he's laid on our country. Poppie will vouch for him. But Bubba and Barry are far more corrupt.
@Bush41 @HillaryClinton @TAMU @BillClinton @GeorgeHWBush @CarterLibrary @TheAlabamaBand @CassadeePope @YolandaAdams These men have collectively ruined our republic and should all be prosecuted for crimes and treason. Lock them all up!

@browardpolitics @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump Congresswoman Wilson needs to lose the hat. Not a flattering look.
@RepWilson @RepRobinKelly Rep. Wilson lied about POTUS. Listen to the Gold Star mom's released tape of call. Pure Deranged Trump Syndrome! She'll lose in 2018!
