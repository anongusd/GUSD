.@AFSCME prez: Before, "there was a disconnect between the union &amp; some of our members or potential members... We relied too much on social media‚Ä¶ Nothing takes the place of talking...1-on-1, looking them dead in the eye, but most importantly listening to what they have to say"
.@NEAToday vice president @BeckyPringle: Before Janus, "We‚Äôd already begun to discuss changing from a service organization to building what we call a culture of organizing, getting back to our roots"; many NEA leaders "didn‚Äôt know what that was"
.@MaryKayHenry: part of SEIU response to threat of public sector "right-to-work" was to "double down on organizing &amp; helping public service members understand why low-wage private sector work was undermining our standard of living and our ability to change things for the better"

Last year's precedent-setting California Supreme Court ruling doesn't address collective bargaining, but it threatens existing gig business models by making it harder to claim workers aren't employees eligible for protections like minimum wage and overtime https://t.co/ZSix1FfUga
&amp; federal law generally pre-empts states/cities from regulating/requiring collective bargaining for workers that are employees under federal labor law, but there's precedent for a state creating bargaining rights for workers (farmworkers) that are excluded from federal labor law.
Context: Federal law dictates who's an employee for the purpose of unionizing under federal labor law (or demanding pay under federal employment law), but states can set their own standards for who's an employee eligible for minimum wage/overtime/breaks and such under state law

Tactics like restaurant servers taking break at once to confront a boss may be protected by law; help organizers test and advance workers' capacity to mobilize co-workers; can be disruptive or embarrassing for company; &amp; effectively threaten escalation to more aggressive actions
RT @Cato_of_Utica: @josheidelson small actions breed confidence and build to bigger actions.
Some commenting on hour-long Slate Slack Strike may not realize that collectively briefly stopping work - e.g. for a few minutes to go confront your boss or huddle as a group- or stopping certain tasks - e.g. by stringently observing oft-ignored safety rules - are age-old tactics
