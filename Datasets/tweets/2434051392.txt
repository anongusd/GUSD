Via @prioritiesUSA:  	Congressional Dems position of fighting to re-open the government w/o funding for a border wall is right on both the policy &amp; the politics. Democrats should stand strong in the face of Trump’s hostage-taking w/the knowledge the American ppl are on their side
It’s your prerogative not to go early. It’s your choice to wait and see what happens, make a little money etc, but we can’t act like SOME folks [not all for sure], but we cannot act like some folks haven’t asked ppl and they have said “not right now.”
Again if you’re principal is running for President, the office is not where the action or the power is. That being said...we [POC] also have to be honest about the fact that we know we have options this cycle and a # of folks are declining to go out on the trail early. 🤷🏾‍♀️...
I think we will see at least 1 campaign manager who is a POC &amp; a # of POC/WOC in spokespeople &amp; top political positions. It’s still early, but we do have to hold folks accountable...Now, I don’t want to discount the importance of POC Chiefs on the official side, but...
.@JessLivMo is right about the need to prioritize diversity esp WOC for top campaign positions. This cycle, a few POC in mid-level positions won’t cut it, but I do think a lot of the presidential hopefuls are really working to lock in top talent. SOME more than others.
@JessLivMo OOOOOO WEEEEE THE TEA HERE IS 🔥. I keep telling folks not to leap for joy when it could be all the POC are on the official side and not the campaign. The official side while your principal is running for President is like working for Beyoncé, but staying in nyc during OTR 2.

@neeratanden @janekleeb @v2aggie2 Nope you’re right Neera! DCCC didn’t spend in Kendra Horn’s race, but a Bloomberg PAC did. They spent 400k on ads. My point is, outside help matters when the candidate isn’t bankrolling their own camp and could have helped Kara  and maybe a few others win.
@janekleeb @neeratanden @v2aggie2 Jumping in to say the DCCC spent $0 in NE-02. I was on the ground and saw the state party’s efforts first hand, but it didn’t help that the DCCC added the race to the red to blue list but spent no $$. It was winnable.

You don’t give anyone the ability to hold microphone during Q&amp;A. You hold the microphone for the questioner. Mother Oprah taught us that.

Dr. Ford’s courage was powerful, it was infectious and courageous. Prior to her testimony her courage inspired me to tell my own story of a college rape. Unfortunately, many  Senate Republicans just seem not to care. I mean these were the people that stand and stood by Trump...
After public pressure, she got her day - but instead of a fair hearing...she got a trial. Dr. Ford bravely stood before the world and told a truth far too many of us know all too well. She detailed how she was violated, how it affected her and why she felt the need to speak up...
Instead, many Republicans in the Senate embarked on a campaign to discredit and undermine the intelligence and experience of the first woman to come forward, Dr. Ford. They attempted to paint her truth as being a mere pawn of Senate Democrats....
Surely, everyone - regardless of party - would step back given these allegations, call for an FBI investigation and call the appropriate individuals to testify (under oath) before the Senate Judiciary Committee. This wasn’t what happened...

LASTLY IF THE GOP WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPTICS MAYBE THEY SHOULD ELECT MORE WOMEN AND THEN ADD THEM TO THE COMMITTEE. You don’t get to call someone else in to do your job though. That’s crazy.
Last time I checked there are Dems on the committee who also happen to be white men and they don’t seem to need someone else to ask questions for them. 🗣🗣
The craziest thing about all of this to me is Republicans are literally telling us they don’t know how not to be insensitive misogynistic bullies and they don’t feel comfortable at least trying to do their damn jobs. Let’s not act like this is acceptable....
The Republicans of the Senate Judiciary Committee are a bunch of internet bullies. They are cowards. It’s preposterous that they have to bring in outside counsel to ask Dr. Ford questions tomorrow. DR FORD IS NOT ON TRIAL!...

Lest we continue to defile the life of #MollieTibbets with racist garbage some folks think is politically expedient that does nothing to address the root cause of the issue. Just stop.
That logic is asinine, archaic and flawed. I’d love if we could have a real conversation about how women’s lives are literally in danger because some men do not know how to check their egos. How many more women have to die before we can address this?...
Her murderer actually might not even be undocumented. Regardless it is problematic for people to characterize an entire community based off the actions of one person. The majority of mass shootings in America are carried out by white men. So are we going to round them all up?...
Mollie Tibbetts was murdered b/c she told a man to leave her alone while she was jogging. Her murderer happens to be undocumented. This isn’t about border security. This is about toxic masculinity. Mollie Tibbetts lost her life b/c a man couldn’t take her saying no. Full stop.

All of this is dangerous. The way some have chosen to take white supremacist ideology &amp; elevate it as though it’s a new phenomenon challenging our conventional thinking. The way some have gone through great lengths to explain away the erratic &amp; baseless behavior by the president
I’m pained by the ways in which reporters, hosts &amp; professional politicos have “normalized economic anxiety” in attempts to make sense of racism. I’m really struck by the idea that the president &amp; his supporters ? truth b/c it’s par for the course for what his supporters believe.
It’s shocking to me the lengths folks will go through to normalize what’s happening under the rmbrells of “making sense of it all”. As a great speaker once said, “normal is dangerous.” And I would venture to say, just because it’s normal, it doesn’t make it right.

I will be asking the @HouseDemocrats that they consider an intern policy that incorporates the voices of kids who navigate their communities daily  while under the threat of gun violence. Those young people matter too...And pissed I even have to say that.
So it really bothers me when time &amp; time again folks act like the students from Parkland were the first kids who experienced a tragedy that decided stand up and demand change in their communities. It’s like the young folks in Ferguson, Baltimore, Baton Rouge, DC etc  don’t exist.
I love the Parkland students. Everyday their perseverance encourages me. But I also love them b/c they have been good at talking about their privilege and bringing other students whom don’t get town halls and Harvard invites to the table.

So all in all, Dems have a strategy, it's just not a solid media strategy. Should they get one? Hell yeah. But make no mistake, I believe the blue wave is still coming.
Dems are actually running FOR things in the midterms. Some folks are unaware b/c Dems aren't getting on or running robust digital campaigns talking abt what they are doing. So the national narrative is being ceded to the folks that really don't know what they are talking about.
It's false that Dems across the country are running "against trump," but folks believe it's true because all they do is watch tv and listen to pundits who are so far away from the strategy around midterm races ("not  me though" said the black cat!).
Persuadable voters also want someone that is going to do their job; they want results. Don Bacon &amp; many republicans like him have failed their constituents. The one thing they did was a tax bill to appease their wealthy donors. If Dems are making that case, we are in the game.
Y'all...if folks knock on doors &amp; remind voters about how Bacon voted for a tax cut that benefited corporations NOT voters in the 2nd district &amp; how he just voted to make it easier for folks to be discriminated against when seeking auto loans...

We can’t do that and think we can still credibly sit at the peacemaking table. Good friends give you tough love when you need it. Today, US officials SHOULD have tough love for the Israeli government. Unfortunately far too many people are silent.
Now... US has sought to be a credible broker of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Any last BIT of that evaporated today when from the WH press podium to the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem today US officials parroted talking points from the Israeli government.

I’m going to remember this the next time I miss a flight, but there is a mechanical issue and my plane is still at the gate. “I know letting me on this plane is an accepted practice...open the doors please.”
The demotion occurred because our plane was still sitting on the gate while the mechanical issue was being figured out. So...someone inside the terminal decided they should open the doors and let everyone who was not on time for the flight on the plane. https://t.co/2jBbbpuFae
I think my face cracked. Now the lady in 2B who was also being demoted, she did not take it as well as I did. Also...The flight attendants were blown 😭😂 as I’m walking back they are like “where are you going?” I’m like “14C😖.”

But also don’t let anyone (because friends, family and folks that mean well also struggle with authenticity) try to put you in a box and tell you what is “appropriate.” Let’s strive to live boxless...there, the opportunities are endless. (END) https://t.co/pLmCqtCqkF
I stopped looking for validation long ago from folks who didn’t think I belonged in the first place. Don’t let the non-melanated proverbial majority (proverbial b/c people of color are the actual global majority) tell you what’s “acceptable.” You will be left out every time.
See when someone says my XYZ isn’t “professional” what I hear is that they are uncomfortable with what I’m doing b/c they aren’t actually comfortable w/themselves. They wonder how I have the audacity to authentically show up every day meanwhile they are tossing on a mask from 9-5
But you show up as K. Ashley because someone impressed upon you long ago that Keisha wasn’t acceptable enough for the office. 😮🤐
Nah. I’m completely comfortable with my authentic self. I have no problem showing up authentically as Symone and delivering. The problem is most of y’all aren’t comfortable. Some of y’all keep showing up as K. Ashely when your name is really Keisha.
So I’m fully aware that when I show up curvy, with a low cut, a bold lip, an oversized bow, amazing nails &amp; a chilling analysis...people don’t know how to take it. B/c I am not “supposed” to be able to give you solid political commentary with a bedazzled nail right?
*spoler alert* there aren’t a lot of black women on cable news. 🤭🤫
B4 my 1st contract, I had an agent tell me I wasn’t “palatable enough for cable tv” &amp; another said I needed voice lessons because I didn’t “sound professional enough.” Translation: I didn’t look or sound like any of the women they were used to seeing on tv.
When someone tells me my nails, the dress or blouse I wore or my hair is “unprofessional,” I find what they are really saying is it is out of the norm for what they are used to seeing on cable news.

Although I feel like the plane is kind of like the quiet car. So I only ever use its powers for can’t wait situations. Today, I’m getting the “tea” that couldn’t wait until I landed.

@scribeofsolomon @sallykohn Because they were. 😑
Dr. King was a radical revolutionary Whom the gov’t labeled a terrorist. He was tactical, a protester and today we remember he was assassinated in the midst of his willingness to tackle the issue of economics and equity. Don’t let the masses water down his work. ✊🏾

3) Trump and the Republican Party are playing games with the lives of DACA recipients. We need to continue to elevate the voices of undocumented folks and push for a legislative remedy for them.
2) #StephonClark was executed by officers serving in the Sacramento Police Department. He didn’t have to die. In the aftermath of his death, young Black folks in Sacramento are organizing and demanding change. We should all stand with and support them.
PSA: 1) what happened in Gaza this weekend should be unacceptable to anyone who stands on the side of justice. The State attacked and murdered protesters. If it was happening anywhere else, folks in the West would have something to say about it.
