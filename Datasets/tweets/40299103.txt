Pro-life Republicans will welcome Catholics & Hispanic voters who we have been working for throughout the #Obama oppression. #contraceptives
#Obama was worried that the economy and his record would be the issues in the fall. So he doubles down against two groups that supported him
Democrats & #Obama stuck a knife in Catholics which includes a lot of Hispanic voters. Smoke & mirrors don't hide who pays 4 #contraceptives
Insurance Co's do not give services away. #Obama thinks if it is not listed on the bill Catholics will be ok with paying for #contraceptives
#Obama clarified how out of touch he & his admin are with working Americans. Small bus owners know if it is included, they're paying for it.
#Obama Total lack of understanding of business. Insurance cos will provide #contraceptives service, but they won't build it into the fees..

In Smith's senate seat, Republicans are unsure of who their candidate might be.  There are no big names coming forward.

Finley and the other Clayton guys are probably out.  Republicans are keeping their choices close to the vest so far.
Stacy Newman is the party loyalist with support from Clayton township.  But probably not enough to win without the Hadley committeewoman

But wait.  Dems have proportional voting so since Hadley makes up most of 73rd, Hadley committeeman and woman get about 2/3 of the vote.
