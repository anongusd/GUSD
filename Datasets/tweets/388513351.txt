Senator Cotton- when the Russians interfere in your election in 2020 because Putin is not a registered R--hope u handle with good humor
How on earth would AG Sessions not have received a briefing on the Russia hacking? Did he not ask for one? Decline it?
Senator King has been consistently good in these hearings. And he seems to be throwing Sessions off his game a little.
Senator Heinrich came to play ball today.
This faux outrage from Sessions about Comey handling of Clinton emails is really hard to take.
Two meetings between @BarackObama and Comey.  Second was to say goodbye. Neither made Comey feel uncomfortable per his testimony
trump team VIP https://t.co/Hrq3mvWWPf
Why is it that Sessions felt this was on Comey to prevent the conversation from going down a dangerous road and not @realDonaldTrump?
Yes thank you we know everyone departed the meeting. That is the problem.
RT @HotlineJosh: Warner's a great questioner -- brief, to the point, with minimal grandstanding.
Sessions bumbled over the pardons question.  Perhaps not surprising but he definitely didn't rule out pardons.

Don't miss the irony that in open under oath hearing, GOP hardest hit at Comey is "why didn't u stand up for yourself in the moment"

The FBI Director would be a part of meetings with most Presidents regarding protecting US from ongoing efforts of foreign adversary.
Details of orchestration of release of memo contents show how concerned Comey was that there was not a special prosecutor at that time

If info is unclassified vs classified harder for any POTUS to block it/prevent from circulation/ release
On oval mtg "Something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word"  spider sense was right.
As questions come up on status of Russia investigation, FBI investigation important to remember Comey hasn't been in job for a month.
Burr wanted Comey to refute dossier. He didn't. Most interesting point so far.
Not surprising Comey colors within lines on obstruction of justice q about Flynn. But did call "disturbing"
Early release of detailed testimony left time for Comey to get some things off his chest about 1. trump team defaming him 2. FBI family
Burr after Comey firing: "SENATOR RICHARD BURR: ‚ÄúI am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey‚Äôs termination..."
Wrote a piece for CNN on the nomination of Wray. 1. Qualified 2. Valid qs on bridge gate, donations and law firm 3. Deserves fair hearing https://t.co/PWIBP49diu
One of the harder qs for Comey is why he didn't share concerns with high level at DOJ. My bet is he expects that one and is ready.
2 qs unlikely to have answers on today. 1. Current details on Russia investigation. 2. Whether Comey thinks his firing obstructed justice.
Why didn't Comey give @realDonaldTrump a clean slate? Because it is entirely possible he could be under investigation before process done.
