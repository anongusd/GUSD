@SpeakerPelosi Y’all need to leave President @realDonaldTrump alone and let him do his job as President. My Lord and My God I hope for patients for President Trump becomes if I was President I would want to choke the life out of a few Democratics...
@dollyslibrary Is there a list of Imagination Library Facebook pages for each county in TN?
@eugenegu https://t.co/ji2AN6cNsp you should watch this...
@caitlinnowens Maybe if the damn Democratic Party would let Trump get this Wall/Fence finished we wouldn’t have this issue The US most definitely wouldn’t have allegations like this if the wall was finished and it’s probably false allegations anyway!
@BernieSanders Sam Walton and family worked for their money and has an organization for education/environment sounds like an awesome family to me...
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You sure are making a lot of people mad...
@BernieSanders You and your party think we don’t need a wall/fence but maybe just border security The thing is you can’t have one without the other and that’s that It’s Amazing how other Countries have wall/fence but the Democratic Party is like where good no need
@BernieSanders When you say "Us" you mean the Democrat Party or the people of the United States and if your for the people you should be for the Wall/Fence as well as Border Security.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, you’re such an evil snake why can’t you see we need both the wall-fence &amp; border security. You don’t care about the American people. You just care about getting a fat check every week. You really do make me sick.
@gracenapolitano Are you Serious! Mrs. Grace Napolitano you and Mrs. Pelosi need to get off ya'll high horse and stand with the President to Make America Great Again... Because you, and Pelosi and the rest of the Democrat Party are full of themselves... Help the People and not Yourself!
@WhiteHouse, @realDonaldTrump,  Why don't we go with the EL CHAPO Act to get this wall/fence built and get her done however I don't think It should have that title though  Let the Mexico drug criminals pay for border security...
@IvankaTrump Why don't we go with the EL CHAPO Act to get this wall/fence built and get her done however I don't think It should have that title though  Let the Mexico drug criminals pay for border security...
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi you’re an ass for not supporting Trump on getting the wall/fence built We need both the wall/fence and a great border security you can’t have one without the other If Obama requested everything Trump is requesting you wouldn’t hesitate a second
@SpeakerPelosi Yeah, and the American people also said that you need to get off your high horse and let Trump get this Wall/Fence up...
@RepRaulGrijalva The wire needs to stay maybe remove the lowest half if the wire was not there they would just climb over. Make America Great Again!
@staceyabrams I think that Pelosi needs to help Trump to get this       wall/fence up You can’t have a reliable border security without a wall/fence and you can’t have a reliable wall/fence without border security it works hand in hand....
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi We need both border security and the wall. Neither one will work without the other. Why is it that other countries can protect their country with both wall and security but we can’t. That’s Stupid as Hell!
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Should I go on?
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi More Americans are employed now than ever before in our history.
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi 4 million new jobs have been created since the election, and more than 3.5 million since Trump took office.
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Let’s see... Trump has worked on	 Jobs in America 4 million new jobs have been created since the election, and more than 3.5 million since Trump took office	More Americans are employed now than ever before in our history Jobless claims at lowest level in nearly 5 Decades...
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Let’s see... Trump has worked on Economic Growth	•4.2 percent growth in the second quarter of 2018.	•For the first time in more than a decade, growth is projected to exceed 3 percent over the calendar year.
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi By the way Trump is by far better than Hillary thank god she didn’t become president! Trump has created more jobs and made it that there are less unemployed people in the US. My goodness he has done a bunch for the US.
@saknama @LoseyLaurice @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Its more of a joke but it seems that way Pelosi doesnt seem to want to work with Trump We need a wall and better boarder security and Pelosi will not have it Also how dear her try to leave while the shutdown was going on She doesn’t care! If you think she does your sadly mistaken
@IceCubesLemon @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi It seems that way Pelosi doesn’t seem to want to work with Trump We need a wall and better boarder security and Pelosi will not have it Also how dear her try to leave while the shutdown was going on She doesn’t care!	If you think she does your sadly mistaken
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi It is very disgraceful... That Trump has tried to work with @SpeakerPelosi and her people but she doesn’t want Trump succeed as President. We would need a wall of officers like the game “Red Rover” and that right there is stupid. This photo sums it up... https://t.co/D6bvyqZ7XW
@KellyannePolls But how many people/vehicles pass  through the Mexican/US  border with out being caught that has drugs/guns... hundreds! We need a Wall! What makes it alright that other countries can protect themselves with a wall but we can’t! RT Please
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Oh, shut up Trump has created more jobs than any Democratic has and has made it so there is less unemployed people And Pelosi and some of her Democratic Party keeps him from doing the things that he said he would do just look how Pelosi been acting
@realDonaldTrump The Wall/Fence needs to be Hot-wired and Solar Powered both the Wall/Fence and the barbwire The razor barbwire needs to be on US side so they may not be able to see it from their side also the wall/fence needs to be razor sharp edges just a thought RT me back
@realDonaldTrump I just had a brain fart LOL! The Wall/Fence needs to be HotWired, but I read that some of them are tunneling underground. We need some razor barbwire on the tops of the fence/wall and also on the ground. If the fence/wall is metal it needs to be sharp edges.
https://t.co/sGPxoYOExL                             I watched this a minute ago and Ted Cruz also knows how important the wall is for our boarder... Watch the whole thing...
@chucknorris How would you keep illegals out of our Country... We need some kind of wall/fence. I saw you when George Bush became Gov. of Texas n you had to pet armadillos that you brought up on stage. N you had some of your students do some karate on stage.
@SpeakerPelosi Please Respond Why Won't You Let Trump Have The Wall?	Check this out...	https://t.co/SjPI5C30tJ	Ya'll really haven't changed much since then. Tons of illegal are still storming into our County and it really doesn't look like you really care a dame.
@BernieSanders I want to know Why Don't you want a Wall/Fence?
@UROCKlive1 @realDonaldTrump Really? @UROCKlive1 He brought back tons of jobs there is less unemployed. He’s trying to keep illegals from coming in that’s bringing in drugs, guns, murderers, rapists, gangs, diseases. And there is a ton more he has done for the good for our country...
@TheDemocrats The thing is the fetus is not a part of her body the fetus is it's own person, it's just attached to the woman's body temp...
@laurawbush Mrs. Bush I don’t understand Democratic’s why can’t they see that we need the boarder wall/fencing. Tons of illegals are walking though bring drugs, guns, illnesses, rapists, and murderers. I just don’t understand it...
@SpeakerPelosi I just read that you’re roughly worth 120 million. So why don’t you just be a doll and give Trump the money to get the wall done. I don’t understand Democratic’s. I’ll keep praying for you and the rest of the government to do the right thing...
@SpeakerPelosi President Clinton, President Bush Jr., President Obama has worked on putting up a border wall/fencing may I please ask why your not letting President Trump for fill this very important task? It’s a simple question. I’m pretty sure you’re not going to reply back tho
@SenSanders Bernie Sanders Net Worth is 2million $$$ that’s what the internet says... So maybe every Sen. can pitch in for this wall that needs to be built....
