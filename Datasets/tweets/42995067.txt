@neeratanden @DLeonhardt @Michaelander45 @DemFromCT Because the senators running for President who identify as supporters of Medicare of All are referring to their cosponsorship of the Sanders bill. https://t.co/BBW1b0k3MP
@DLeonhardt @Michaelander45 @DemFromCT I think for the purposes of the primary, the definition of "Medicare for All" will be the Bernie bill.
@Michaelander45 @DLeonhardt @DemFromCT If there are policy reasons people want to object to Medicare for All, that's fine and reasonable. But let's not talk ourselves out of a robust discussion for fear of how something will play politically in an election almost two years away.
@DLeonhardt Yes, in many respects. But the question misses my point, which is: it's bad to cede fights or fail to advance proposals based on preemptive guesses about political fallout. The guess is often wrong &amp; more than that, the next election shd not always be the foremost consideration
@GregJKrieg @daveweigel Judicial reform probably, when the time comes. But for now, I need you people to know what I am referring to.
@daveweigel Does this mean Schultz supports Court expansion? If so, I will revisit my take on his candidacy
Trump wasnt serious at all about policy in '16 &amp; pundits acted like the joke was on Dems for thinking policy mattered. Now the pundits are predicting Trump will be able to weaponize Medicare-for-all. We should be so lucky to debate medical loss-ratio in the fall of '20 with Trump
Obama worked within the system and preserved private insurance with the ACA and the GOP still decried it as socialism. Any further reform, however incremental, is bound to be controversial at first too. So may as well go big &amp; argue the issue in moral terms, not political ones.
@DemFromCT @DLeonhardt Hillary touted a public option in 2016. That is not novel. It should be the floor. Let's have a real discussion about going all the way to single-payer.
@DemFromCT @DLeonhardt An 18-month primary process strikes me as as good a time as any to be aspirational in our policy debates. Leave the compromising for governing. But dont short-circuit the conversation at the beginning.
@DLeonhardt This reminds me of when you said we shouldn't fight Kavanaugh. Maybe we should just fight for what we believe in, try to convince the public of it, and see how the politics shakes out after that.

@chrislhayes Building support for *procedural* reforms to make our system more democratic (automatic voter registration, giving DC/PR representation, campaign finance reform, Court reform) is as important as Green New Deal, Medicare for All, etc. The former unlocks the latter.
@chrislhayes Instead of pressuring the field to make zero-sum decision abt what mission-critical priority to emphasize above rest, another approach is to build consensus for undoing elements of countermajoritarianism - like the filibuster - so next POTUS' agenda neednt be reduced to one item

In conclusion, Dem primary voters shouldnt make some pundit-driven judgment about "who can best beat Trump." They shd follow their heart &amp; vote for someone who inspires. Because the same quality that inspires caucusgoers will enable them to transcend Trump attacks in the general
This type of person can talk about economic inequality or universal health care and have it actually break through because the messenger is authentic and intriguing enough from a storytelling standpoint to exert their own gravitational pull on the media cycle - away from Trump.
A nominee best situated to be able to ignore Trump is one who commands a media ecosystem apart from Trump. Whose life story is inherently fascinating enough to draw endless human-interest stories. Whose social media videos in the car or carving flank steak are deemed interesting
This is why I tend to think that the theory that "all Democrats need to do is nominate a bland, inoffensive guy and let Trump beat himself" is wrong. An uninteresting character is most susceptible to being sucked into the vortex because they cannot command attention on their own
Especially with Trump as the sitting President, and much of the media taking view that "if the President says it, it must be taken as news," it will not be easy to avoid being sucked into Trump's vortex - no matter what a candidate promises themselves at the start of the race.
You can give a thoughtful speech documenting Trump's many examples of acting racist. But at his evening rally, he will - with no supporting evidence - simply call you a racist back. And the next day's stories will read "Candidates trade barbs".
This creates a sugar high of satisfaction - a false sensation of being on offense for once, rather than being on defense about some contrived controversy. But the joke is on you, because in reverting to an exchange of salvos, you are playing Trump's game.
But - aha! - guess how the Dem nominee in this scenario can reassert control over their news destiny. It turns out the rollout of an expanded EITC does not get anyone on the assignment desk's attention, but firing back at Trump at does.
This is how contrived - or overblown - controversies are born. In time, the Dem realizes that rollouts on expanded EITC wont cut it, and will leave the network correspondent traveling with them forced to come up with some new hook to talk about, say, emails, or DNA tests, again
Because the "A block" segment in this scenario was rightfully hard-hitting on Trump for making racist comments about a judge, any producer feels compelled to then have an equally hard-hitting segment on the Dem nominee even if they didnt do anything remotely as controversial
No cable news producer will devote their "A block" to a report on Trump attacking Judge Curiel for being Mexican-American and then pivot to a straighthforward package about the Democratic nominee's plan to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit.
The challenge is, it is extremely difficult to be more newsworthy than Trump - with his provocative-by-design utterances- on any given day. This makes it difficult for even laserlike focus on strictly policy-focused messages - like preexisting conditions- to "win the day"
After 16, no one thinks holding up a mirror to Trump - or engaging him tit for tat- is a winning strategy. However, sticking to a plan of ignoring Trump is a lot harder in a one-on-one matchup than for House challengers running individualized races

@ChuckLane1 @archibaldcrane @jbendery There is not. The second nominee from Minnesota is a Republican.
@ChuckLane1 @archibaldcrane @jbendery This is a fine argument if you want to make it. I don't buy it at all - at most, Dems bought themselves 48 hours extra back home - but you can argue it. But so far you have been defending the deal by invoking the qualifications of nominees who aren't even part of it.
@ChuckLane1 @archibaldcrane @jbendery Even if you want to define Nancy Brasel as something other than a "Trumo judge," the headline is still accurate as written.
@ChuckLane1 @archibaldcrane @jbendery I still do not know what point you are making. The criticism of the deal pertains to whether it is wise for Dems to consent to allowing McConnell to collapse a process that would normally take several weeks of floor time into two days.
@archibaldcrane @ChuckLane1 @jbendery No offense but pretty sure Jen Bendery, who has written more about the judicial wars in the Senate during the Trump era than just about anyone, knows more about these nominees than either of you guys do.
#Basta indeed.	https://t.co/LNGrB9f6ge
@ChuckLane1 @rickhasen @SenSchumer Yes, Klobuchar tweeted out her enthusiasm about getting Brasel through last night, and has been urging a consent agreement like this since earlier this summer. That doesn't change it was an awful, lopsided deal that will now open up floor time for far more heinous picks.
@ChuckLane1 @rickhasen @SenSchumer That would have nothing to do with a decision to fast track this separate set of noms. By their own admission, they cut this deal simply to get home sooner.

@speechboy71 Tobacco bill. McCain-Feingold. Immigration reform. Torture ban. Those are four examples right there, even excluding the climate issue that was the main complaint of @drvox
@speechboy71 @drvox I think @drvox correctly identifies issues w/DC media &amp; what it rewards:	A) Accessibility/charm	B) Gestures of bipartisanship	Sometimes this fetishizes superficial centrism from genial sorts (see Collins,Corker). But Kennedy/McCain actually defied their party &amp; legislated boldly
@speechboy71 Getting reelected is how you put yourself in position to achieve stuff. I judge McCain on the fact that he personally willed a meaningful immigration bill to passage in 2013, not that he said "build the dang fence" in an ad in 2010.
@speechboy71 Agree to disagree. If he never returned to it after '10, I would agree the '05 bravery on the issue was an aberration. That is what happened with Rubio. He stuck his neck out in '13 as a play for '16, then regretted it and has abandoned the issue. But McCain went back to the well
@speechboy71 There has never, in recent years, been a time when it didnt take political guts for a GOPer to urge a path to citizenship. McCain urged it in '05 w/Kennedy, took steps to survive primary at height of Tea Party then sought Schumer out in '13. He showed his true north on the issue
@speechboy71 I obviously wont defend endorsing Trump but think that is a non sequitur. Did he push for immigration reform - twice - when doing so made him a villain to conservative talk radio? Yes.
@speechboy71 @joshgreenman @drvox He walked away from immigration to get reelected in 2010 but then returned to it in 2013. He succeeded in passing it out of the Senate that year when it was against party orthodoxy as evidenced by the House's refusal to even consider the Senate-passed bill.

If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, he will vote to overturn Roe and no one who holds themselves out to be a Democrat should be a party to that.
There are 70+ House districts that are more Dem-leaning than #OH12, and there are 20+ states that will end up banning abortion if Brett Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court and has the chance to rule on Roe.

@jadler1969 @cdkang76 I do not think the hearing will move much except insofar as a nominee uses them to disprove that Trump's litmus tests are controlling. If you dont want to answer such questions, fine. But then we revert to what Trump has already told us.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 If you scroll to the top of this thread, I think you will see we could not be more upfront. Our position is clear: every name on Trump shortlist should be opposed today based on Trump's own words about how they would rule on ACA and Roe.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 Pretending any of these shortlisters are arriving at a hearing with an open mind on the issues is exactly the type of judicial confirmation kabuki that Democratic senators better not indulge.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 A nominee may not answer about ACA and indeed I doubt he/she will. But then a senator will be fully justified in citing that refusal, along with the President's own past statements about how his pick would be guaranteed to vote against ACA, as a basis to oppose. Many will do so
It is the future and we are never going back. It would be typical move for conservatives to rationalize Trump doing it, lock in the Supreme Court for a generation, then try to act like it is not OK for anybody else.	https://t.co/uEv26Nwlaj

@jadler1969 @cdkang76 A) I dont actually consider the process demeaned by the issuance of litmus tests. I hope a 2020 Dem nominee issues them too. I am saying it is already demeaned according to your standards.	B) WH asking these questions is irrelvant, as we all know.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 Trump issued a shortlist and litmus tests. Among those was that he would only nominate judges who viewed ACA differently than Roberts. This means 1) the process is already demeaned and 2) the onus is on nominee to go above and beyond in answering q's on ACA.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 Agree to disagree.
@jadler1969 @DavidGSavage The point is, we have senators acting like respect for "precedent" means something and will be satisfactory reassurance that Roe is not in danger. So David's post is relevant.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 I know you are on record. And I hope a senator on the committee reads from your brief in the setup to a round of questions on ACA at the hearing.
@jadler1969 @DavidGSavage Speaking of disingenuous arguments....
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 When the Trump administration urges confirmation of a justice at the same time it is actively arguing the ACA is unconstitutional in federal court, the two things are bound to collide and it's going to be a thing. Sorry if it offends your sensibilities
@EricColumbus @jadler1969 @cdkang76 Yes by this logic also Republican senators were being "disingenuous" when they pressed Kagan on Heller.
@jadler1969 @cdkang76 Senators fighting tooth and nail to defend ACA would be saps if they help install a judge hostile to the ACA onto the Court, regardless if he is the 4th or 5th vote. They would also be saps to trust Roberts in the face of every future challenge to ACA the right may whip up.

She was outmatched by Tapper, whose questioning cornered her into making the absurd claims that Roberts hasnt been hostile to Roe since joining the Court and that Gorsuch may end up being a vote to uphold Roe. She just turned the heat up on herself by several orders of magnitude.
She dusted off the same talking points she's used about Roe on every SCOTUS pick since Roberts. But those work less well when a) the vacancy happens to be the deciding seat on Roe and b) Trump has said the quiet part out loud about only picking anti-Roe judges.
Most senators in the hot seat like Sen. Collins is on Trump's SCOTUS pick would shun the Sunday shows, let alone do two of them. But she is so used to being able to hoodwink people about being a moderate for two decades that she confidently strode out to make the rounds.

Jake Tapper is doing a great job pressing Collins on Roe.
Susan Collins to @jaketapper: "The President told me he would not ask that question" about Roe.	He doesnt need to, Susan Collins. The Federalist Society picked the list for Trump because they already know which judges are anti-Roe.
Let's stop pretending any of this is on the level, Susan Collins. This is the seat that will decide the fate of Roe and TRUMP ALREADY TOLD US HE WOULD ONLY PICK ANTI-ROE JUDGES. BELIEVE HIM. (6/6)
Earlier this week, Collins did urge Trump to look off his list at new names. She needs to stick to that. If Trump reverts to someone on his list, Collins can't act like she is reserving judgment and will "wait to hear what the nominee says in the hearing." (5/6)
If Collins claims to support Roe, the ONLY acceptable answer for her is that she will reject anyone on Trump's list because all of those people are ones the Federalist Society told Trump counsel Don McGahn, wink-wink, will satisfy the Roe litmus test. (4/6)
This is word salad. Donald Trump told us OVER AND OVER AGAIN during the campaign he would only appoint judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade. We should believe him. (3/6)
She will almost certainly claim that she considers Roe a "precedent" and she wants a "judge who respects precedent." She may also add she considers Roe "settled law." (2/6)
Susan Collins is on two Sunday news shows, @ThisWeekABC and @CNNSotu. She will obviously be pressed on her views on Roe when it comes to Trump's upcoming nominee. (1/6)

@joshgerstein @blakehounshell @Shawna Yes. The theory might be that you'd use the Feb 8 deadline as the leverage to get the House to vote on a potential Senate-passed DACA fix. But there would be no guarantees of course
@Shawna @chuckschumer None of this binds the House, however, so I still think Dems should be skeptical of this as the solution.
@Shawna @blakehounshell You could write the vote agreement however you wanted. It could theoretically include a fixed window for debating DACA if motion to proceed was agreed to.
@blakehounshell @Shawna You could theoretically come up with a vote agreement that you would UC that would stack a cloture vote on a CR, final passage on a CR and a motion to proceed on DACA fix.

@SeanMcElwee I think Obama decision to draw dividing line at 250k, hard as it was to live by in terms of finding revenue for progressive priorities, isolated the issue of who was "rich" to a small % of people and made it easier for upper-middle class suburbanites to be fine with Dems on taxes
@SeanMcElwee Nice piece. Thorny question always was what happens w/ these voters if a Dem nominee were to explicitly blow off Obama pledge of holding &lt;$250K folks harmless. But now that GOP has willingly made itself the party of raising taxes on these voters, life becomes a lot easier

Three q's for those saying tax bill will still be rushed next wk:	1 Couldnt rushing get hard if some rank &amp; filers (Collins, CA GOPers) are spooked?	2 Isnt rushing politically unwise given bill's unpopularity?	3 Isnt it hypocritical to not wait for Jones given Garland Standard?

@alexanderbolton Past examples are unique to the state. With Alabama, counties are due to report by Dec 22. State officials say delays may push certification to Dec 26. But even then swearing-in wld only slip to Jan if Senate is adjourned already or ... funny business  https://t.co/JbeJRBw5A4
@alexanderbolton 16 days was a product of how long it took Mass to certify, not a Senate rule. McConnell himself said in November he expected AL winner to be certified Dec 23
@alexanderbolton So I don't think McConnell is actually saying that (yet). I think he is reasoning tax will be done by Christmas, which will end the session, ergo Strange is here til the end of session. But if they take past Christmas all bets off
@alexanderbolton At that point, it would be complete funny business to keep Jones from being seated. That is longer than when Alabama officials said they expect to be able to certify
@alexanderbolton I said if the tax schedule slips. The end of the current session is only about two weeks from now. If it takes longer than that for a conference report, Jones will be a factor.
In the event of a Jones win tonight, the pressure on Susan Collins over the tax plan becomes enormous. She'd be the deciding vote if the schedule slips enough
