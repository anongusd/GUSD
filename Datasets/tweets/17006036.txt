Michael Liburdi, the anti-choice extremist supported by @SenatorSinema, has an EXTENSIVE record of opposing #ReproFreedom. He acted as chairman of the AZ "Right to Life" PAC for 5 yrs &amp; helped AZ Gov Ducey pass a law requiring women to justify their reason for having an abortion.
.@SenatorSinema was elected last year in large part due to a wave powered by women voters who wanted to put a check on this anti-choice administration. You can’t claim you are an advocate of women while elevating right-wing judges who will inflict long-term damage to our cause.
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and anti-choice activists are stacking the courts with far right-wing judges that will strip away our rights. @SenateDems should be doing EVERYTHING they can to stop it—but instead, @SenatorSinema is trying to elevate an anti-choice extremist judge.
