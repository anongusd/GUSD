Lovely cold snowy morning in NYC.  But it’s warm in the Village at the VID Petitioning Kickoff Breakfast where we honored Keen Berger who is retiring as District Leader.  Thank you Keen for all you have done for progressive democratic politics. https://t.co/ob6PuTusRz

At Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS in #Parkland, one year ago, 17 students and educators lost their lives. This year we held the first hearing on gun violence in 8 years, and yesterday we advanced #HR8, the first major gun legislation in decades. Elections matter.
Congratulations @yuhline! Proud to see you representing NYC. https://t.co/CoHRMkQPub
It has been 8 years since Congress last held a hearing on gun violence. 8 long years. 1000s of deaths. This week we change that.  		Together we knocked doors and made calls. Elections matter. Voting matters. Volunteering makes a difference.
Elections matter. After nearly a decade of silence from Congress, I’m calling a hearing on preventing gun violence next week. #TimetoAct 		https://t.co/UerhIgKkFZ

Republicans' repeated attempts to undermine &amp; interfere with Mueller probe show they aren't fit to hold office. Americans will remember and vote on November 6!
Republicans are playing games-spending days creating a spectacle of FBI agents’ personal lives to boost their thin claims of bias, but shutting down any efforts that don’t serve their goal: undermining the Mueller investigation (19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas to date)
I’m told there is no time for hearings on separated families or Russia’s influence on the 2016 election. But Trump Republicans can spend today involving themselves in an FBI agent’s personal life.
Trump’s nominee for #SCOTUS Kavanaugh threatens hard won rights &amp; decades of progress: Roe v Wade, healthcare for millions, civil rights, enviro regs, campaign finance reform. This is the battle not just of our lifetimes, but of generations to come. #SaveSCOTUS #WhatsAtStake
This #IndependenceDay, I’m reflecting on how we ever better implement &amp; protect the ideals of equality our nation was founded upon. Together, we can ensure the promise of freedom truly reaches all.

Republicans in Congress refuse to let us vote on real gun control. Taking back the House is the only way to get the change we need. Proud to join the #MarchForOurLives with some many of my fellow Democrats in NYC today. https://t.co/oXH8FRsa5Q
Congressional Republicans refuse to stand up for the Special Counsel &amp; an independent investigation. Change requires taking back the House!
Thank you to everyone who volunteered this weekend to petition for my re-election.  It was great to see everyone from @villagedemocrat  @cfdnyc and Downtown Progressive Democrats. https://t.co/rusR6ScYKl
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter was a fierce advocate, a trailblazer and a dear friend. She will be missed.
The young people who took part in #NationalSchoolWalkout are very clear on their next step: Vote to make change this November and every election after. All I can say is YES. Listen to these kids.
Today’s #NationalSchoolWalkout shows the best of our democracy. I have the deepest respect and honor the students protesting gun violence &amp; demanding change. Congress needs to step up &amp; hear them.
As the final votes are counted, congratulations to @ConorLambPA. #PA18 shows that we can take back the House &amp; move forward on a people, not corporation, focused agenda

Answer is ZERO. No Republicans will vote #investigatetrump. America is watching-history will judge. We see you. #ResolutionofInquiry #truth
Both amendments to expand reach of #ResolutionofInquiry failed on party lines. Not surprising but sad-Will ONE Republican stand for #truth?
Vote on #ResolutionofInquiry coming soon. All eyes on @HouseJudiciary #Republicans to #PROVEIT if you want the #truth!
Debate is still going on re: #ResolutionofInquiry -- it's pretty simple, #Republicans. Vote YES, get the #facts. #truth
No, it's about #nationalsecurity and getting #thetruth. Shame that you think of this as a game. https://t.co/wosUuZ7UBb
Republicans still pretending to be outraged anytime a Democrat says anything bad ab @realDonaldTrump. Real outrage is refusal to get facts.
Now GOP @SteveKingIA claims can't support #ResolutionofInquiry because based on innuendo &amp; rumors, not facts. FACTS are what we are seeking.
.@mattgaetz says: Get over it, #Democrats, the people have spoken &amp; elected Trump. What? Does he remember popular vote count? #DoYourJob
.@Rep_Matt_Gaetz saying asking any questions is prejudging the outcome. Awfully defensive. #ResolutionofInquiry
RT @iSheyman: Thank you to @MoveOn members and allies for making your voice heard. https://t.co/6Nk5DaLWR1
Amazing supporters of #ResolutionofInquiry stayed all day and are making their voices heard as Republicans pretend nothing to see here! TY!
Republicans keep insisting this is biz as usual+no need to act. America disagrees! Over 835,000 signatures say support #ResolutionofInquiry
Proper oversight is not "encouraging" government to do its job, @RepGoodlatte. It's doing ours. #ResolutionofInquiry
Agree, @JacksonLeeTX18-There is smoke AND fire. We must do our jobs.
But @DarrellIssa won't even commit to including all questions from #ResolutionofInquiry in his "draft letter" in response to @RepTedDeutch
.@DarrellIssa saying he won't vote YES b/c he will do letters to @TheJusticeDept. We have done that. It has failed. #ResolutionofInquiry
The House has so far abrogated its responsibility to do meaningful oversight. It's time to do our duty. #ResolutionofInquiry
Every day #Democrats asking for info on #Trumprussia &amp; biz conflicts. We have been met with deafening silence from our colleagues.
.@RepJohnConyers "History will judge us" Members of Congress took an oath. #DoYourJob
What are you afraid of @RepGoodlatte? It's our job and responsibility to oversee @TheJusticeDept &amp; investigate. Get answers now.
.@RepGoodlatte saying he intends to ask @TheJusticeDept for info. Enough empty words-If you want info, vote YES on #ResolutionofInquiry
#ResolutionofInquiry up for a vote now.  Republicans don't want to get information &amp; answers to #Congress. Complicit #Trumprussia https://t.co/VuvSfegFCt

If you are watching @HouseJudiciary hearing, Republicans playing games with the votes. That's on top of delaying #ResolutionofInquiry vote!
Crowds still line the hallway but Republicans won't let anymore people in. Power play won't work-all still watching. #ResolutionofInquiry
Republicans keeping doors shut and people in hallway while leaving first row blocked off and EMPTY.  Let them in!! #ResolutionofInquiry

RT! Today's the day @HouseJudiciary Republicans have to take stand on #investigatetrump. MUST VOTE YES on #ResolutionofInquiry. #DoYourJob
My #ResolutionofInquiry will force the Republicans to choose: investigate or to bury heads in sand. We will hold them accountable. END
Republicans are so scared they are trying to cover up the hearing by scheduling it the same day as Trump’s first Congressional address 7/8
What the Republicans do will be key – are they willing to stand up for USA &amp; constitution, or will they be complicit in Trump’s deceit? 6/8
Before Republicans are able to vote in Committee tomorrow there will have to be a debate. Can Republicans vote no with a straight face? 5/8
A #ResolutionofInquiry CANNOT be sidelined or ignored. It MUST be voted on – either in committee (Judiciary) or on the House Floor. 4/8
My pending #ResolutionofInquiry demands info from the DOJ &amp; FBI on 2 main areas: all White House Russian ties and any business conflicts 3/8
A #ResolutionofInquiry is a privileged motion in the House that demands certain information from the Executive Branch.  2/8
1/8 Let's take a moment to discuss what a #ResolutionofInquiry is, and why you should be paying attention to how the Republicans handle it
My #ResolutionofInquiry gets info out of  AG Sessions &amp; @TheJusticeDept hands alone &amp; gets Congress what we need to #investigatetrump. TUES!
AG Sessions moved fast: Few profited more immediately from Donald Trump’s election than the private-prison industry" https://t.co/92ZyqqT4y9
