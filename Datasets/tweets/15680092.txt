@colewagoner Again, they can do it all they want. I can consider it sad, amusing, what have you. Any other season I wouldn't.
@colewagoner Which I said was ok, just a bit sad. I trolled Auburn in 2013, but Bama didn't lose to Florida State as well.
@colewagoner They is just We when referring to another group of people. So still don't see the problem with what I said.
@colewagoner So that would render your catchphrase #wenatty useless since you don't play or coach for Oregon.
@colewagoner I don't so much have a problem with it (rivalry and all) but they lost to both natty game teams this year, so it's a bit sad.
Clemson, now you have to go to the White House and meet Donald Trump, so did you really win, really?
