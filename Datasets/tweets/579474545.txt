@RonaldKlain @DemFromCT @washingtonpost @PostOpinions I think we point out that BILLIONS to farmers whose crops are rotting because of Trump's trade war is also Socialism - it's just that it is popular with his base.
@RadioFreeTom @HamptonStevens @MarkSZaidEsq @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y I'm using the blocking feature quite a bit - especially on folks like this.

@marcorubio Cool. Now do the #TrumpCrimeFamily
@BeschlossDC Stealing this to use until he's gone.
@realDonaldTrump 93% of a shrinking party. No 52% approval - not close.
@realDonaldTrump You're not negotiating, you're being taken for a ride, you've received NOTHING. The reason there have been no launches is because the facility collapsed BEFORE you first talked to him. He CAN'T launch not that he DECIDED stop.
@realDonaldTrump Just to show that once again, you've NEVER had an original idea - here's NIXON'S 4th of July at the Lincoln Memorial: https://t.co/YDpIOEuEYo
@BeschlossDC @GlennKesslerWP Proof that Trump hasn't had a single original idea in his life.

@StephenKing Victim-in-Chief.
@realDonaldTrump This is sickening.
@smerconish @CNN I’d argue that the women brought here then forced into sex (which he had to know) didn’t deserve this. Misdemeanor? Only because the law was written to protect men. Without customers trafficking would stop.

@MollyJongFast https://t.co/ZjCIEbA8Fw
@SykesCharlie This is going to get worse before it gets better. My question is does he go to the White House for a celebration dinner in light of the charges and that these women are sex trafficking victims? Trump has already proclaimed his innocence.

@WhiteHouse @GOP Oh like Trump championing the death penalty for under age boys - who turned out to be innocent? Like THAT?
@spmurphy10 @GOP there has been similar fencing there for DECADES. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, this is REPLACEMENT fencing - they know, they contract it out. don't believe us, look on Google Earth, you can see the barrier there over the decades.
@WeddleLance @GOP @LindaSuhler This isn't a fence they are building - there has been a fencing there for DECADES. According to the Army Corp of Engineers, this is a REPLACEMENT fence. He's lying to you. Check it out on Google Earth, you can see the fencing. https://t.co/TTdHCJJbft
@GOP This is NOT new wall. This was filmed MONTHS ago it's in Santa Teresa, NM - anyone can go on to Google Earth and see the fencing has been there for DECADES. The Army Corps of Engineers also says this is replacement fencing. https://t.co/GOuHDwSO6p
@GOPChairwoman What about Steve King and Kevin McCarthy? don't you run the GOP not the DNC?
@GOPChairwoman Why do YOU care? You guys are funded by Russians &amp; the Koch Brothers.
@realDonaldTrump I just had a look - this is simply a replacement fence according to the Army Corps of Engineers. Anyone can go on to Google Earth and survey the area around Santa Teresa, NM and see the fencing that has been there for decades. This was filmed months ago.

@thomaskaine5 ONLY if your health plan covers it. Many do. You can check your plan from the Silver Sneakers website.
@Green_Footballs It's crickets over there.
@soledadobrien @Lawrence True. It also must be mentioned that this demonstrates that law enforcement can investigate and differentiate a false claim from a legitimate one. I hope he gets the mental health treatment he obviously needs.
@SykesCharlie It has to be that he is mentally ill. this also shows that law enforcement can discren a false claim from a legitimate one.
@CharlesPPierce @Lawrence This demonstrates that law enforcement is pretty good at identifying a fake claim - that needs to be pointed out however, the fact that a MAGA had means and opportunity to MURDER members of Congress and the press needs wall to wall coverage.
@AnnCoulter Sorry to disappoint you but this instance shows that law enforcement is able to catch a fake.

@Green_Footballs @realDonaldTrump Charles - agreed. Do you know the location - because I want everyone to post the Google Earth images showing the previous barrier.

@GOPChairwoman You sure are scoldy. Many people have been told by family they are X when in fact they are not. That isn’t a lie that’s a family member unclear of the history. In her case, she’s correct genetically - the family just didn’t know when. AncestryDNA has made a business from this.
@StopTheHIT @SenCoryGardner No.
@RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @DavidAFrench THE. BEDFORD. INCIDENT. Yes.
@brithume So if your parent tells you you’re X, you claim you’re X and later find out they were wrong that’s a problem? Someone call AncestryDNA because there’s a HELL of a lot of Americans discovering just that.

@RadioFreeTom @nfljunky1013 @TheRickWilson I agree, it all about obscuring the issue. The sad thing is - this is a tragedy for families who experience this. The loudest voices out there probably know someone who has had to do this but were told the baby was "stillborn" to avoid the backlash.

@MontlakeMan The minute it’s born? That’s called BIRTH. You have no idea what you’re talking about and the tragedy for the parents. You likely know someone where this happened and were told the child was stillborn because of the stigma.
@MSNBC But he lost - the American people overwhelmingly did not elect him. That’s the problem.
@revrrlewis @AOC Poor Tammy. She’s had plastic surgery, died her hair and sold her soul to try to catch the last gasp of the Tea Party nutjob bus and missed. It’s sad really.
@davidjoachim @williamlegate Perfect.
@TheRickWilson I believe people of good will can find a way to disagree on policies/ideas and still move forward. We still have a lot of work ahead to clean up the mess that is Trumpism including removing Members of both the House and Senate, ferreting out those who were hired and more.

@LibertyRinging @TheRickWilson Yes. He. Did. It's in writing on his campaign page "It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year." That means bank transfer. https://t.co/lvme8r6oCk

@isaiasworld Let's save this tweet for later. Why do you suppose that for TWO YEARS Republicans did not give him his wall - if fact, they never brought it to a vote? Because they don't want it either. PS How many bills have Dems passed since Jan 3? Hardly do nothing.

@MollyJongFast @TheRickWilson Yep.

@SpeakerPelosi @Kris_Sacrebleu @realDonaldTrump Stand firm. We can't keep being held hostage by Trump. He will continue to shut the government down every time he doesn't get his way if we deliver him a wall - those relying on paychecks can't continue to be pawns to his demands.
@abbydphillip He resents women so much - unbelievable.

@AriFleischer Trump &amp; McConnell own this. We have Federal workers in bread lines, unable to receive their chemo, unable to fill their gas tanks, unable to pay for daycare for their children to come to work for ZERO dollars. They could open the government, but they REFUSE.
@realDonaldTrump Good news on Rx drug costs! YOU just said they've been lowered. I KNOW THAT IS A LIE. Just picked up after insurance: off patent, generic $1,600 up from $50 for the BRAND NAME under Obama. Another: $460, $293 after discount from manufacturer. So much winning.
@realDonaldTrump Historic amounts of corruption. Historic number of indictments. Historic number of resignations. Historic debt. Historic loss of confidence. Yeah, the winning is killing us.
@realDonaldTrump Laughing - they are going UNDER the barrier. So OBVIOUSLY a wall isn't the solution.
@realDonaldTrump The wall is NOT under construction. There is no money that has been allocated to build it. If the wall is under construction, why is the government closed?
@realDonaldTrump NO - you showing TECH proves that is the way to do it - NO WALL.

@realDonaldTrump YOU. AREN'T. BUILDING. WALL. It's not happening. The only wall being built is from Obama era appropriations. The money was allocated to you haven't spent the money given to YOU.
@realDonaldTrump Sadly, most of the people in that video aren't being paid.

@GOPChairwoman Phony dossier? Nearly every item in the document has proven true. Remember Allen Weisselberg has been given immunity. You're on a sinking ship. Google those members of the Nixon cabal and what happened with their careers.
@johncardillo You claiming this doesn't make it true. A quick look at the timeline indicates your claim is a LIE. PS Weisselberg has also given testimony - that likely backs up Cohen. AND if he lies again, he goes to jail for a longer period.

@realDonaldTrump YOU DO NOT SET INTEREST RATES.
@realDonaldTrump Pence says you make claims like "other Presidents told me they wished they built a wall" because you just don't know any better. How long is he staying? https://t.co/5EY3JKOEfu
@realDonaldTrump No. Farmers are filing for bankruptcy. Those trade partners aren't coming back for decades - meanwhile your buddy Putin is selling soybeans and chicken to China - maybe that was the point, to help Russia.
And he wants BILLIONS because he doesn't know better? NO. ToddlerInChief can go home. https://t.co/KxnIywsaVY
We've gone from "former POTUS told me they wished THEY built a wall" to Pence saying it was Trump's "IMPRESSION" from previous administrations. WHAT?
@adamcbest Yeah he's a Dem for healthcare but that is about it. Not that I don't appreciate the healthcare vote but come on.

@CharlesMBlow @Oooooo_Donna BECAUSE NO ONE IS STOPPING HIM.
@realDonaldTrump YOU need to get permission from congress to spend money. You can declare a crisis but they don't have to give you money. Guaranteed impeachment supported by GOP Senators if you try this. They won't want to allow Dems to have it - which they will if you do.
@realDonaldTrump YOU created the humanitarian crisis. YOU. If we want to solve it we have to remove YOU - not build a stupid wall that was simply a rhetorical device to make you remember to race bait during your rallies.
