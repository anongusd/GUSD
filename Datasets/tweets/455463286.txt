#NCFA briefed Army leaders Jan. 27, expects a fuller discussion in coming days, but also expects pushback in cost of recommendations
#NCFA says retaining an 11th CAB in Korea would cost $1.9 billion but presses that it is very important to have
To offset extra costs in Guard keeping Apaches, #NCFA recommends Guard only get 2 Black Hawk battalions instead of 4 &amp;Army slow down BH buys
To keep Apaches in Guard, #NCFA estimates operating cost would go up $165 million per year, with a one time cost of $420 million.
#NCFA says keeping Apaches in Guard helps integrate the regular Army and the Guard, which was commission's goal
#NCFA recommends 4 Apache battalions in Guard, 20 in active Army. Only 18 helos per Guard battalion vs 24 in regular Army battalions
RT @JenJudson: #NCFA says 980,000 troops is as low as total Army can go.
#NCFA says it wants an armored brigade combat team in Europe &amp; would keep the 11th combat aviation brigade in Korea.
RT @JenJudson: #NCFA says combat training center rotations should increase for Guard but not at expense of active Army training.
Among #NCFA recommendations: start pilot prgm to recruit as one Army, consolidate all marketing &amp; switch to single personnel and pay system
The #NCFA hard copy report is legit. Includes 63 individual recommendations in 208 pages. https://t.co/OszLmLgWlB
#NCFA Vice Chair Thomas Lamont says overall report theme is "we are one Army... We will strive to maintain that whatever we do."

Gen. Perkins: The more budgets are constrained, the more important a good AOC is. Priorities and vision very important #AUSA2014
Gen. Perkins of @TRADOC - We don't want the #Army to innovate in fits and starts because of a constrained budget. #AUSA2014
