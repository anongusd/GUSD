We may have avoided another shutdown, but federal contractors still desperately need the back pay that they’ve been denied.

Eight days after the AFL-CIO was formed in 1955, a young John Dingell swore an oath and took his seat in Congress. He spent every day after fighting for working people. Today, America lost a great statesman, the labor movement lost an unwavering ally, and I lost a dear friend.
If the president wants to talk about the working class, he can start by approving federal contractors’ back pay and funding the government.
The truth is that working people have faced two years of White House attacks on our livelihoods, our rights on the job, and our fundamental dignity.

Instead, @senatemajldr and his conference have chosen to deploy political gamesmanship in place of real solutions. Working people are sick and tired of being used as pawns. Until these politicians do their jobs, they can expect to hear from us in the streets and in their offices.
Senate Republicans just denied 800,000 people the chance to go to work and begin putting their lives back in order. @SenSchumer's proposal would have immediately reopened the government, freeing federal workers from the handful of partisan ideologues who are holding them hostage.

3 out of 4: That’s how many of the workers who joined unions last year are under the age of 34. #BLS #1u
Key #BLS union data trends:		✅Thousands of workers in "right to work" states joining unions		✅Workers organizing across sectors		✅Young workers driving growth		✅Professionals and information industry workers on the rise
#BLS shows union membership rose 262,000 last year - a positive trend, but our growing movement of working people isn't simply measured by numbers on a page. #1u

.@realDonaldTrump should use his office to help us raise wages, strengthen unions &amp; give all workers a better life. We'll take it from there
Changing the rules of our economy won't be easy. We face long odds. But nothing is set in stone. The future is ours to shape.
Every worker, deserves a job &amp; the power to make it a good job, to bargain for higher wages, safe working conditions and retirement security
We'll never solve the problems in our economy unless every worker has the power to bargain. Nothing else raises wages better or more fairly.
#EqualPayDay is not a celebration, it's a reminder of how imbalances in our economy cause real pain. Even more for women of color.
