In neither the committee’s investigation nor in the supplemental background investigation conducted by the FBI was there ANY evidence to substantiate or corroborate any of the allegations.
Committee investigators spoke with 45 individuals and took 25 written statements relating to the various allegations made in the course of the #SCOTUS confirmation process.

"It is illegal to make materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements to Congressional investigators. It is illegal to obstruct Committee investigations."—Chairman @ChuckGrassley

"The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know."—Chairman @ChuckGrassley
"Committee investigations in support of the judicial nomination process are an essential part of the Committee’s constitutional role."—Chairman @ChuckGrassley
Ms. Munro-Leighton confessed to Committee investigators that (1) she “just wanted to get attention”; (2) “it was a tactic”; and (3) “that was just a ploy.” Potential violations of federal law include 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 (materially false statements) and 1505 (obstruction).
Under questioning by Committee investigators, Ms. Munro-Leighton admitted, contrary to her prior claims, that she had not been sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh and was not the author of the original “Jane Doe” letter.

In subsequent interviews, Avenatti likewise cast serious doubt on or contradicted the allegations while insisting that he had thoroughly vetted his client.
Swetnick made her allegations in a sworn statement to the committee on September 26. In an October 1 interview with NBC News, however, Swetnick specifically and explicitly back-tracked or contradicted key parts of her sworn statement on these and other allegations.
...the lack of substantiating or corroborating evidence, and the overarching and serious credibility problems pervading the presentation of these allegations.
The referral methodically details the issues with Swetnick’s allegations as relayed by Avenatti, the immediate diversion of committee resources to investigate those allegations, the subsequent contradictions by both Swetnick and Avenatti,...
The letter notes potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001 and 1505, which respectively define the federal criminal offenses of conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress.
"I don’t take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.”—@ChuckGrassley
"It also wastes time and resources for destructive reasons. Thankfully, the law prohibits such false statements to Congress and obstruction of congressional committee investigations. For the law to work, we can’t just brush aside potential violations."—@ChuckGrassley
“But in the heat of partisan moments, some do try to knowingly mislead the committee. That’s unfair to my colleagues, the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth. It stifles our ability to work on legitimate lines of inquiry."—@ChuckGrassley
“When a well-meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee’s work, I take it seriously. It takes courage to come forward, especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma. I’m grateful for those who find that courage.”—@ChuckGrassley

The multitude of allegations against him have been proven false. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this exceptional nominee.
It would be a travesty if the Senate did not confirm the most qualified nominee in our nation’s history.
I’m sorry for what the Kavanaugh family went through the last several weeks. We should all admire Judge Kavanaugh’s willingness to serve his country despite the way he’s been treated.
I’m pleased to support Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
Thirty-one years after the Senate Democrats’ treatment of Robert Bork, their playbook remains the same. For the left-wing, advice and consent has become search and destroy.
The Democrat strategy used against Judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear, they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and thorough this process is.
There is simply no reason to deny Judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us.
Nothing an investigator, including career FBI special agents, does will ever be good enough to satisfy the Democrat leadership in Washington, who staked out opposition to Judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominated.
There’s also no contemporaneous evidence. This investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaugh’s 25 years of public service.
These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations.
There’s nothing in the supplemental FBI background-investigation report that we didn’t already know.
The FBI interviewed 10 more people related to the latest credible sexual-assault allegations. And the FBI confirmed what the Senate investigators already concluded.
Our more than 20 committee staff members have worked night and day over the last many weeks, tracking down virtually all leads. And at the request of undecided members, the FBI re-opened Judge Kavanaugh’s background investigation for another week.
In addition to the prior 6 FBI full-field background investigations with the interviews of nearly 150 people who have known Judge Kavanaugh his entire life, the Committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received.
We have thoroughly investigated Judge Kavanaugh’s background.
The consensus is that this burden wasn’t met.
It’s a fundamental aspect of fairness and due process that the accuser have the burden of proving allegations.  Judge Kavanaugh was publicly accused of a crime, and his reputation and livelihood were at stake. It was only fair that his accuser had the burden of proof.
It’s true that confirmation hearings aren’t a trial. But trials have rules based on common-sense notions of fairness and due process, not the other way around.
As promised, I provided a safe, comfortable, and dignified forum for Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford was sincere in her testimony, as was Judge Kavanaugh, who emphatically denied the allegations.
Dr. Ford requested the opportunity to tell her story to the Senate Judiciary Committee. After a lot of foot-dragging by Dr. Ford’s attorneys, they finally agreed to a public hearing.
It wasn’t until those news reports on September 16 that I learned of Dr. Ford’s identity. This was an outrage. The political motives behind the Democrats’ actions are obvious to everyone.
It wasn’t until September 13—nearly seven weeks after the Ranking Member received these allegations and on the eve of a confirmation vote—that the Ranking Member referred them to the FBI.  And somehow, they were leaked to the press.
Keeping the July 30 letter secret deprived senators of having all the facts before them on this nomination.
And there were no questions about these allegations among the 1,300 written questions sent to Judge Kavanaugh after the hearing.  This amounts to more written questions submitted after a hearing to all Supreme Court nominees combined.
Judiciary Committee members could’ve asked Judge Kavanaugh about this in the closed session of the hearing, which the Ranking Member didn’t attend.
Senators could’ve asked Judge Kavanaugh about the allegations during his 32 hours of testimony over the course of three days.
The Ranking Member’s staff could’ve raised them with Judge Kavanaugh during a background investigation follow-up call in late August.
She could’ve discussed them with Judge Kavanaugh during their private meeting on August 20—a meeting which took place after her staff had sent Dr. Ford to Democratic lawyers—or shared them with 64 of her colleagues who also met with him.
The Ranking Member had numerous opportunities to raise these allegations with Judge Kavanaugh personally.
The Ranking Member shamefully sat on these allegations for nearly seven weeks, only to reveal them at the eleventh hour when it appeared Judge Kavanaugh was headed towards confirmation.
Instead of referring Dr. Ford to the FBI or sharing these allegations with her colleagues—either of which would’ve respected and preserved Dr. Ford’s confidentiality as she requested—the Ranking Member referred Dr. Ford to Democratic-activist attorneys...
In July, the Ranking Member received a letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford alleging that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school 36 years ago.

WSJ: Friend of Dr. Ford Felt Pressure to Revisit Statement #SCOTUS https://t.co/Gd1xFC4UYA
Some of my colleagues accused Judge Kavanaugh of committing perjury. For that false claim The Washington Post fact-checker awarded my colleague three Pinocchios.
Judge Kavanaugh’s antagonizers couldn’t land a punch on him during his three days of testimony. Even when they made false or misleading arguments, they couldn’t touch him.
Judge Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours over the course of three days. Judge Kavanaugh showed the nation exactly why he deserves to be on the Supreme Court.
This is on top of the 307 judicial opinions he authored. Despite Democrats’ efforts to bury the Committee in even more paperwork, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a timely four-day hearing on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination last month.
I oversaw the most transparent confirmation process in Senate history. Senators had access to more than 500,000 pages of judicial writings, publications, and documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s Executive Branch service.
Another member of the Committee revealed the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats could hold the vacancy open for two years if they defeated Judge Kavanaugh and took control of the Senate in the midterm elections.
One member of my Committee said that those who vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh would be “complicit in evil.”
Even before he knew the President’s nominee, the Minority Leader said he was opposed to all twenty-five well qualified potential nominees listed.
The fix was in from the beginning. Before the ink was dry on the nomination, the Minority Leader announced that he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with everything he’s got.
The conduct of the left-wing, dark money groups and their allies in this body have shamed us all.
What left-wing groups and their Democratic allies have done to Judge Kavanaugh is nothing short of monstrous.
Even the American Bar Association, which the Democrats say is the “gold standard”, gave them their unanimously well-qualified rating.
Before left-wing outside groups and Democratic leaders had him in their sights, Judge Kavanaugh possessed an impeccable reputation and was held in high esteem by the bench and bar alike.
This should’ve been a respectable and dignified confirmation process. In a previous era, this highly qualified nominee would’ve received unanimous support in the Senate.
He has been a law professor at three prestigious law schools and a mentor to dozens of judicial law clerks.
Judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar of his community and the legal profession. He serves underprivileged communities, coaches girls’ basketball, and is a lector at his church. He has shown a deep commitment to preparing young lawyers for their careers.

Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there ever a whiff of ANY issue – at all – related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse. 2/2
As part of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to #SCOTUS, the FBI conducted its SIXTH full-field background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh since 1993. As part of these 6 prior FBI investigations, the FBI interviewed nearly 150 different people who know Judge Kavanaugh personally. 1/2
In the texts, there’s no suggestion that Judge Kavanaugh made any effort to conceal anything or press anyone to say something untrue. This is just the latest ridiculous attempt to smear Judge Kavanaugh's good name. 6/6
It seems perfectly sensible and predictable for Judge Kavanaugh’s associates to engage with Yale friends about rumors given the numerous unsubstantiated allegations that have been picked up by media throughout this process. 5/6
Separately, it just doesn't make sense to refer conversations between old classmates about a news story to the FBI—and Sen. Blumenthal certainly knows that. 4/6
Committee investigators advised Senator Blumenthal’s staff that they could contact the FBI to pass along that information if they thought it was necessary. Whether Senator Blumenthal’s staff chose to do that was up to them. 3/6
Shortly before Friday’s committee meeting began, Senator Blumenthal’s office forwarded ten emails to the Chairman’s office originally from Ms. Berchem. They were immediately passed to Chairman Grassley’s oversight and investigations team for review. 2/6
The texts from Ms. Berchem do not appear relevant or contradictory to Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony. This appears to be another last-ditch effort to derail the nomination with baseless innuendo by Democrats who have already decided to vote no. 1/6 https://t.co/PoW9pug45N

Attorney General Janet Reno said, “I have come to believe—after much reflection and great reluctance—that [the statute] is structurally flawed and those flaws cannot be corrected within our constitutional framework” https://t.co/bqRbJk3FCo
Then-Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder testified before Congress that the law was “too flawed to be renewed.” https://t.co/2RQ2zyzTOD
With no appetite to renew the authorities of an unchecked prosecutor, Congress allowed the statute to lapse in 1999. This was the bipartisan consensus in Congress at the time.
FACT: The independent counsel law considered in Morrison lapsed nearly twenty years ago. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing

Wittes of @lawfareblog: [Kavanaugh]’s specific proposal bears attention today by those who are interested in how Kavanaugh might respond to the Office of Special Counsel in the age of Trump. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/L9CZ4dsNde
Wittes of @lawfareblog: The far more salient fact is that Kavanaugh has articulated a vision of a legitimate and appropriate investigation under our constitutional scheme. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/L9CZ4dsNde
Benjamin Wittes of @lawfareblog notes in July 2018 that Kavanaugh “made the then-unpopular case that some independent counsel law remained necessary.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing  https://t.co/L9CZ4dsNde
In 1999, Sen. Durbin said “Our form of government is grounded on the premise that unchecked power is tyranny. The independent counsel is unchecked, unbridled, unrestrained, and unaccountable.” #SCOTUS https://t.co/91HQYzcBNL
Jonathan Turley: special counsels are an entirely different creature [than independent counsels]. It is important lawmakers recognize... differences before making assumptions that Kavanaugh would automatically deem Mueller’s investigation unconstitutional. https://t.co/JEuX6QblIv

FACT: Morrison v. Olson and the old independent counsel statute have been criticized by legal experts from across the ideological spectrum. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
Justice Ginsburg during her ’93 hearing: A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process. #SCOTUS

Judge Kavanaugh is deeply invested in individual liberty by strictly preserving the constitutional structure adopted by the Framers #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
Judge Kavanaugh has faithfully applied #SCOTUS precedent to claims brought under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act but refuses to permit litigants to invoke religious liberty as a way to avoid valid legal rules. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
In Newdow v. Roberts, Judge Kavanaugh asserted that prayers &amp; religious phrases are “deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition” and as long as they are phrases that “are not (seeking to convert) or otherwise exploitative,” they withstand constitutional scrutiny. #SCOTUS
Judge Kavanaugh: Separation of powers ensure there are checks on the branches [of government.] #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing

Bruce Lindsey was one of President Clinton’s closest advisors. Bruce Lindsey was also primarily responsible for reviewing the Kagan documents in 2010. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
In 2010, Bruce Lindsey reviewed Justice Kagan’s records before being sent to the Senate. He was the national campaign dir. of Pres. Clinton’s 1992 campaign &amp; CEO of the Clinton Foundation for 10 yrs. He also worked w/ Kagan in the Clinton WH. #SCOTUS https://t.co/tDeiUBM0wC
In 2009, Justice Sotomayor’s records were first reviewed by an outside lawyer, Leslie Kiernan, who represented Obama campaign manager David Plouffe and fmr. Rep. Charlie Rangle. She later became Deputy WH Counsel in the Obama admin. https://t.co/tDeiUBM0wC
This process follows a precedent set during the 2010 nomination of Elena Kagan. Document production from her years in the Clinton White House was supervised by Bruce Lindsey, whose White House tenure overlapped with Kagan’s.  https://t.co/tDeiUBM0wC

@maziehirono .@WSJ: The Obama administration produced no documents – none – from Justice Kagan’s hears in the Solicitor General’s office… The staff secretary’s documents are much less relevant to legal matters than those from the SG’s office. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/tDeiUBM0wC
“…I pushed for federal officials to significantly expedite the public disclosure process under federal law, so that all Americans have online access to more than 290,000 pages of these records right now on the Judiciary Committee website.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
"Every one of these more than 483,000 pages of Executive Branch records are available to any senator, anytime, 24/7.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“And we received just shy of half a million pages of emails and other documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s service as an executive branch lawyer—which is more than we received for the last five Supreme Court nominees combined." #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“These add up to more than 27,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s record already available to the American people.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
"He submitted more than 17,000 pages of speeches, articles, and other material to the committee along with his 120-page written response to the Senate Questionnaire—the most robust ever submitted to a Supreme Court nominees.” #SCOTUS
“And he has criticized those who substitute their own judgments about what a statute should say for what the statute actually says.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“A review of Judge Kavanaugh’s extensive record demonstrates a deep commitment to the rule of law. He has written eloquently that both judges and federal agencies are bound by the laws Congress enacts.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“The American Bar Association, whose assessment Democratic leaders have called the “gold standard” of judicial evaluations, rated Judge Kavanaugh unanimously well-qualified.”
“He has one of the most impressive records for a lower court judge in the Supreme Court. In at least a dozen separate cases, the Supreme Court adopted positions advanced by Judge Kavanaugh.”
"Judge Kavanaugh is a graduate of Yale Law School. He clerked for three federal judges, including the man he is nominated to replace. He spent all but three years of his career in public service and has served as a judge for twelve years on the D.C. Circuit...” #SCOTUS
Chairman @ChuckGrassley: Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees – if not the most qualified nominee –I have seen. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“I expect Judge Kavanaugh will follow the example set by Ginsburg, and all the nominees that followed her, that a nominee should offer “no hints, no forecasts, no previews” on how they will vote.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
"Seeking assurances from a nominee on how he will vote in certain cases or how he views certain precedent undermines judicial independence and essentially asks for a promise in exchange for a confirmation vote." #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
"This is the reason why all Supreme Court nominees since Ginsburg have declined to offer their personal opinions on the correctness of precedent." #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“…the American people don’t want their judges to pick sides before they hear a case. They want a judge who rules based upon what the law commands.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“Judges must leave the lawmaking to Congress.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“A good judge never bases decisions on his preferred policy preferences.”
“Our legal system’s success is built on judges accepting that their role is limited to deciding cases and controversies. A good judge exercises humility and makes decisions according to the specific facts of the case and according to the law.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“The Framers intended for the Judiciary to be immune from the political pressures the other two branches face. That is so that judges would decide cases according to the law and not according to popular opinion.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
“We are here this week to hear from Brett Kavanaugh, to hear about his exceptional qualifications, his record of dedication to the rule of law, and his demonstrated independence and his appreciation of the importance of the separation of powers.” #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
Chairman @ChuckGrassley: One of the Senate’s most solemn constitutional duties is to provide advice and consent to the President on his nominations of Supreme Court justices. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing

The Democratic Minority is forced to resort to phony process complaints because they have no objections to Judge Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, character or qualifications. #DesperateDelayTactics #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
.@wsj: Democrats are also griping that Chairman @ChuckGrassley isn’t seeking all of the documents from Mr. Kavanaugh’s years as staff secretary to Mr. Bush. But nearly all of these are irrelevant to how Judge Kavanugh would rule on the High Court. #SCOTUS https://t.co/tDeiUBM0wC
In 2009, then-Chairman, @SenatorLeahy explained that Justice Sotomayor’s judicial record “is the best indication of her judicial philosophy. We do not have to imagine what kind of a judge she will be because we see what kind of a judge she has been.” #SCOTUS

As then-Chairman @SenatorLeahy said in 2009 with respect to Sotomayor’s nomination, judicial record is the most relevant part of a nominee’s record. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing
The document disclosure process for Justice Kagan’s nomination doesn’t support the Democrats’ request for Judge Kavanaugh’s staff secretary documents. #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearing

Chairman @ChuckGrassley: Indeed, the Senate Democrats demanded the search of every page of every email and every other record from every one of the hundreds of White House staffers who came and went during every one of the eight years of the Bush Administration.
Chairman @ChuckGrassley: This argument is ridiculous on its face. And the American people aren’t buying it.

@ChuckGrassley "...the process will be as fair and transparent as I can make it. That has been my approach during my nearly 38 years in the Senate, and I will not change that." -Chairman @ChuckGrassley on the #SCOTUS confirmation process
@ChuckGrassley "I don’t want judges who decide cases based on whether the results are liberal or conservative. Judges should rule according to the law, no matter what their views of the policy outcomes are." -@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley "Justices have a way of surprising us. Who could have predicted that Justice Scalia would strike down a ban on flag-burning? It’s a fool’s errand to try to predict how a justice will rule on a hypothetical future case." -@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley "The President’s [ #SCOTUS ] selection process is the most transparent in history. To my knowledge no other Presidential candidate has ever done that. He issued a list of potential Supreme Court nominees directly to the American people during his 2016 campaign." -@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley "I’m optimistic that the person the President nominates tonight will be highly qualified and committed to the rule of law. I’m optimistic because President Trump already appointed one such Supreme Court Justice: Neil Gorsuch." -@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley "Justice Kennedy left an important legacy of more than three decades on the Supreme Court. I voted for his confirmation thirty years ago. ... I hope Justice Kennedy’s successor carries forward this legacy." -@ChuckGrassley

ROBERTS: "I think it's vitally important that nominees, to use Justice Ginsburg's words, ‘no hints, no forecasts, no previews.’" #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXny51ic
BREYER: "…matters of enormous controversy...I do not think I should go into those for the reason that those are likely to be the subject of litigation in front of the Court" #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXny51ic
SOTOMAYOR: “…the process of judging is a process of keeping an open mind. It's the process of not coming to a decision w a prejudgment ever of an outcome...&amp; then making a decision that’s limited to what the law says on the facts before the judge” #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXny51ic
BREYER: "…there is nothing more important to a judge than to have an open mind and to listen carefully to the arguments...I do not want to predict or commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court." #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXnxNpTC
SOTOMAYOR: "…opining on a hypothetical is very, very difficult for a judge to do. And as a potential justice on the Supreme Court...I can't engage in a question that involves hypotheses." #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXny51ic

KAGAN: “…inappropriate for a nominee to ever give any indication of how she would rule in a case that would come before the Court. And I think, too, it would be inappropriate to do so in a somewhat veiled manner by essentially grading past cases.” #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXnxNpTC

GINSBURG: "A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process." #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXnxNpTC
GINSBURG: "Judges in our system are bound to decide concrete cases, not abstract issues; each case is based on particular facts and its decision should turn on those facts and the governing law, stated and explained in light of the particular arguments..." https://t.co/qWbXny51ic
GINSBURG: "…it would be wrong for me to say or preview in this legislative chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide" #SCOTUS https://t.co/qWbXny51ic
