In the meantime, it looks like I'll be going to Charlotte!
Hell, if this Obama endorsement shit doesn't work out, Tanman's ready to endorse Ron Paul and run as a libertarian. Stay tuned.

Tanman wondering why the hell Frenchman's incessantly calling him when he's busy photo-oping. Could it be this: http://bit.ly/crYQEk #sayfie
Tanman vetoed Shands $$ cuz he's a 'Nole and LittleM's a Gator--at least that's what he told FSU Booster Club in a fundrasing call. #sayfie
Tanman briefly thought about suing BP for a few hundred million, but then remembered how bad he is at reading "all that law stuff." #sayfie
@GOPMichael wassup biznatch? Tell your gal Sharon that Tanman is none too happy with the letter she sent out tonight. #sayfie
MysteryDonor swung by the mansion earlier to kick the shit with Tanman. Tanman didn't seem as chatty as past visits, though. #sayfie
Michelle made things worse when she reminded Tanman of how great it was back when the campaign essentially paid no rent at RPOF HQ #sayfie
Tanman spontaneously burst into tears today when he reminisced on the good old days of Bigmouth  taking his campaign out for steak. #sayfie
Heck, Tanman is even spooked by the blue lights atop the Yukon the FDLE drives us around in. This aint a joke! Messed up, yo. #sayfie
Tanman's been acting like such a crazy bitch since Bigmouth's arrest, that Michelle is considering flying in the Frenchman for help. #sayfie
Since Tanman heard of Bigmouth's arrest, I've been running on high, duct taped to a ceiling fan as he lays whimpering below. FML! #sayfie
Aaaaahhhh!!!!!! #sayfie
@GOPMichael bro you have no idea how relieved I am that Arlene is someone else's problem. Wutzhername and Michelle combined aren't as bad.
All I can say to the poor schlubs at LexLuthor's camp who have Arlene and her tantrums to deal with: good fuckin luck! #sayfie
Tanman pleased Arlene joined LexLuthor's camp. She'll wreak havoc and make things easier for Tanman's buds running HowdyDoody's camp #sayfie
Tanman tired from campaigning over the long weekend, so he's getting to bed early so he can campaign some more during the work week. #sayfie
Oui oui madmoiselle RT: @KaylaAnderson @CCristFan would Frenchman be LeMieux?
Frenchman called Tanman to say hi. Both started laughing when Tanman asked Frenchman if he was raising money for LittleM. #sayfie
Sorry Jeff, Tanman and Bigmouth were going to double-cross you, but decided not to. (actually, LittleM decided for them) #sayfie
All this Sestak news coverage reminds me of when Chairman Bigmouth offered LittleM support for AG if he didnt run against Tanman. #sayfie
@thatJgirl Yo, Im a fan. I cant support anyone. I just want Tanman to win so Im not destined to keep him cool at Green Iguana karaoke nights
Frenchman called Tanman up and asked him WTF was up with the 3-day gays in military flip-flop. ....Uh yea, they still talk. Duh! #sayfie
Headed to Louisiana where Tanman and Obama will hug and discuss Meek. Oh, and pretend to be doing something about the oil spill. #sayfie
Tanman met with officials yesterday to discuss threat of hurricanes or "those big photo ops from God" as he likes to call them. #sayfie
Surprised Tanman's now against 'Don't ask don't tell,' since that has been his own policy on just about every issue his whole life. #sayfie
Looks like Michelle's not happy with my posts lately. She's trying to replace me with a $12 box fan! http://tweetphoto.com/24035016 #sayfie
@GOPMichael Michelle already has an election kit that has all that stuff, but it's for Tanman. She just needs her gum and she's good #sayfie
@GOPMichael mind you, Michelle's hissy fits aren't as bad as Arlene's from back in the day, but fuckin hilarious regardless. #sayfie
@GOPMichael speaking of bubblegum, Tanman's campaign went into crisis mode the other day when Michelle broke a nail. #sayfie
Fo sho, biznatch! RT @GOPMichael: People that make fake Twitter accounts to attack someone ... are pathetic!
Since BP is paying for Visit FL ads, Tanman is trying to figure out how he can star in them like Arnold stars in the Visit CA ads. #sayfie
Wondering why Tanman turned red and started acting all weird when the MSNBC reporter mentioned something about a "plug." #sayfie
@Eric_Jotkoff be fair to Tanman. This oil spill is a top priority... It's not every day such a photo op-rich crisis presents itself. #sayfie
Tanman relieved oil spill isn't plugged yet so he can continue acting like he cares about something other than his senate campaign. #sayfie
Since oil spill is plugged, Tanman's considering amemdments to ban FL's rampant asassinations, witch hunts, and tar-n-featherings. #sayfie
Thanks for the #ff, yo!  @SunshineEmpire @HeathWhiteaker @texasrv @joefuckingbiden #sayfie
Tanman and I visited union thugs today. Douchebags wouldn't set me up in front of the podium because I'm not "union made." #sayfie
Tanman giddy about new addition to the campaign. Not only is Johnson an actual strategist, but he can exhange fashion tips w him too #sayfie
Tanman reads polls like a fortune teller reads palms-there's no future if he calls oil drilling special session.http://bit.ly/c3VcQk #sayfie
George Soros ignoring Tanman's calls after Bloomberg declined to be Tanman's campaign billionaire sugar daddy. #sayfie
Tanman outraged Bloomberg won't support him. Vows to personally boycott NYC....except for fundraisers and Liza concerts, of course. #sayfie
So Tanman woke up all paranoid today. Any sound or sudden movement spooks him. The word "specter" makes him break out in hives. #sayfie
Uh-oh, AP just called the race for Sestak. Looks like I'll be running on high all night. #sayfie
Looks like it's going to be a long night for Tanman. The Tea Party victory in KY has him on his 4th Appletini, and there still PA. #sayfie
Tanman extremely concerned and preoccupied with Specter race all the way up in PA. Tar balls in Key West? Not so much. #sayfie
Tanman has tried calling Blumenthal at least 50 times to ask him how he was able to get away with lying about his record for 20 yrs. #sayfie
Tanman only got one good bump, which is much less than he used to get at the Green Iguana: http://bit.ly/chow2w #sayfie #flsen
No sign of Weasel face but he sent his strategist: http://bit.ly/cfruDq RT @BGarnFL @CCristFan has Robert Wexler arrived yet? #sayfie #flsen
Why would they support him? Tanman noticed @FFCR chairman hasn't said anything positive about Little M or negative about him. So... #rpof
Tanman was telling me today he really hopes that he can still convince the @FFCR and @FFYR chairmen to support him #sayfie #rpof
...Meanwhile Tanman's running me ragged and my blades havent been cleaned in weeks. If I break, it's bye bye Michelle! I miss Eikey. #sayfie
"Like, omagosh! That is so not true and junk!" --Michelle's response to Tanman after he asked her about this: http://bit.ly/cyZoVq #sayfie
Tanman agrees. RT @joefuckingbiden: Ron Jeremy Great porn actor terrible basketball coach. #celtics
Tanman in a bind: supporting the "I-4 Corridor #Magic" will piss off his Democrat donors in Boston. Oh the conundrums of governing. #sayfie
I'm the Tanman's fan, but at the same time #imnotafan
Next campaign event: bra burning fundraiser at Green Iguana to celebrate Tanman's independence and the end of his "living a lie." #sayfie
A heckler was just carried out by Tanman's old Green Iguana posse. #sayfie
Some of us do. RT @SaintPetersblog: @charliecristfl bellows out 'We like Mike' as @michelletodd introduces Senator Fasano. #sayfie
Peter Nehr is here too. Looks like Tanman has the full support of the Florida Legislature's Creepy Dudes Caucus. #sayfie
I'm all set up and blowing! RT @SaintPetersblog: Chants of Charlie, Charlie beginning. The Tanman is in the building. #sayfie #flsen
Big day for Tanman. Grand opening of his lingerie shop-turned campaign headquarters. Ooh! Fasano's here just like the good old days! #sayfie
Now that Tanman finally admitted he spent last 4 years living a lie, I wonder when he'll admit to that other lie he's been living. #sayfie
#FF @shitmygovsays @joefuckingbiden @boteleprompter @demonsheep @monkeyonloose @CCristFan (that's right, bitches! I #FF'd myself!) #sayfie
During one of their creepy private swimming meetings, Bigmouth asked Tanman if he would appoint him chairman of the "IPOF." #sayfie
Tanman not picking up donors' calls out of fear that Rahm Emanuel will get a busy signal when he calls to "wish him well." #sayfie
Tanman freaked out when he heard some picture of him sold on eBay for $7k. He calmed down when he was told it was only a painting. #sayfie
Tanman giddy about his special session on drilling. It's a photo-op, taxpayers pay for it, and it accomplishes nothing. It's so him! #sayfie
Given how Tanman has screwed Florida it is only appropriate that his campaign gussey up in a lingerie store. #sayfie
Tanman opens his campaign headquarters in an old lingerie shop. More evidence Wutzhername is running things http://yfrog.com/7e60aaj #sayfie
Tanman just called Utah Senator Bob Bennett and invited him to Florida for an "independent" discussion: http://bit.ly/9eSJHG #utgop
Tanman ate dozens of oysters today while visiting fishermen. This will have zero effect on him and Wutzhername tonight. Just saying. #sayfie
Tanman apparently likes being around Seamen RT @charliecristfl: meeting with some of FL's Fisherman and Oysterman in Panhandle today #sayfie

Tanman has finally made a firm decision. He'll call oil drilling special session... as soon as he decides what his position will be. #sayfie

@bsfarrington, (or should I call you Brenda?) I've said many things on here that others would probably delete. Me? I don't give a shit.
Fasano just called Tanman all flustered demanding to know why he'd take Sen. Dean on a plane ride to see oil slick and not him. #sayfie
Dorworth went to the Kentucky Derby? I guess Chairman Bigmouth's RPOF AmEx card number must still be active. http://tl.gd/14prpb #sayfie
Tanman just fuckin called me "The People's Fan." Since when are "the people" a bunch of sweaty greasy orange Greeks needing a fan? #sayfie

RT @joefuckingbiden: Good fucking Morning , Mondays Suck. Days like this I wish I was an illegal alien on welfare. Sleep til noon no trabajo
Tanman loves Miami fundraisers. Only down side: having to stay at Wutzhername's place. Being so close to SoBe sux. #socloseyetsofar #sayfie
Tanman spent all weekend drinking in South Florida, trying to cope with the loss of Frenchman's support. http://bit.ly/biyTS5 #sayfie
Tanman called gov mansion to make sure his bidet is working properly. I guess Wutzhername wont be joining Tanman in Tally this week. #sayfie
Tanman changing his religious affiliation from Methodist to the heretofore nonexistent "People's Church of Open Theology." #sayfie
1 of Tanman's bodyguards cracked this joke about the race: "Charlie's always wanted to be in a 3-way with 2 other guys." No comment. #sayfie
@bsfarrington I hope you didn't include me in the car crash pictures. You know Tanman's policy regarding "spontaneous" photo-ops. #sayfie
Tanman happy he was able to help guy in flipped over car. Nothing is more comforting to an accident victim than a roadside photo-op. #sayfie
Tanman always says "Balido has a nice ascot." It's cool to finally put a face to the name. #sayfie
If any1 sees Ms Rotunda here at 101 & she wants a private tour of gov mansion, hit me up. Tanman took sleep pill 2night so he's out. #sayfie

Shit, with Eikey gone who the hell is going to clean my blades and feed me my WD-40? With Tanman running me nonstop I'm in trouble. #sayfie
Tanman said he's going 2 caucus w "the people" or some bullshit like that. Isnt the People's Party the communists in some countries? #sayfie

Big day for Tanman, not because of big announcement, but because he'll have to publicly kiss Wutzhername for 1st time since wedding #sayfie
What's the big deal? Tanman was only calling Rahm to discuss what color workout tights he would recommend for him.  #sayfie #flsen
When angry GOP donors demand refunds, Tanman will accuse them of hampering FL's recovery, since hiring campaign staff reduces unemployment.
Seems theres more media showing up to Tanman's event tomorrow than supporters. Eikey planning to bus ppl in from Broward & South Bch #sayfie
I'm scared. People keep saying that shit is about to hit me. #sayfie #flsen
Kottkamp told Tanman he'll resign as LG if he switches to Independent. Now Wutzhername is suddenly obsessed with the movie Evita. #sayfie
@FtLauderDaniel leave Tanman alone. He was sexually confused for a while and that passed. Now he's politically confused. That too will pass.
Tanman asked if I'd stay with him as an independent. I was like, "bitch, I'm a fan. I don't vote or care." He said, "My kinda guy!" #sayfie
