@CBSNews You can love your country as we all do however in that presidential sitting you must not just think of yourself. We are of many out here looking at you to fix this but its you who is controlling it with Russia already helping you &amp; Snowden 100% Truth We deserve better SIR

@McFaul Wow
@taylorswift13 Will you help? You seem to get things done quickly..
And Trump should tweet himself the American people deserve the truth
If you stop it will not. They need to know this will not go away as before and I will not continue to live under others who could care less about any of us! #StandUp #1Voice  There's a select group of ones who deserve someone to step up and fix this. My platform = Your platform

I could run for president be totally true to myself and the ones who hear me and win even with my mistakes and oppression that was forced upon many like me. I'm a voice for many who don't and won't stand up for themselves.
