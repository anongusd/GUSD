@MuellerSheWrote, @sengraham2016 is going to give himself a stroke or heart attack. O.O  If he gets through this day without that or a physical altercation, I will be really surprised.
@MuellerSheWrote I don't know, man. I'm feeling real conflicted and confused. They're both making me cry, and in the end, I'm grieving for our people. Because this is where we are.

@MuellerSheWrote, IT'S MONDAY!!!
Dear Southern Jesus,	Thank you dear dear Lord for this sweet, warm banana puddin'. The sole reason I go to family reunions. Your sweet, creamy grace rolleth down upon my tongue and blesseth me until the pan is empty. 	O-men_____.
@dvorakoelling Heroine.
#WhyIDidntReport because I was an awkward 13yo and thought I was special because a grown man was interested in me. Because I thought I was the only one. Because I was a lonely child. Because I didn't foresee the 16 year old girl who he would rape years later. #MeToo
@MuellerSheWrote I am overwhelmed by the bravery and patriotism of #DrChristineBlaseyFord look at the HUGE sacrifice she is making for us all. She is as good as a martyr. #WhyIDidntReport #KavanaughConfirmationHearing #MeToo #VoteNoToKavanaugh
#WhyIDidntReport because I didn't have anywhere else to go.
@MuellerSheWrote What a POS. That's infuriating. He's trash, and I'm sorry he said that to you.
#WhyIDidntReport Because I knew it would end the relationship I was in. #MeToo
#WhyIDidntReport, I wasn't injured enough, and he didn't text or write down an admission that he did it. The domestic and sexual violence office told me it would never go anywhere. The moral of the story: make sure you have the person who assaults you put it in writing. #MeToo
@realDonaldTrump Except for @SenJohnMcCain ???

@MuellerSheWrote here's an idea you can sell! Get Lyft, uber, or individuals to give discounted or free rides to voting locations. This is something groups could organize themselves, but if uber got on that... total win. @Uber @Uber_Support @lyft #FlipItBlue
@MuellerSheWrote You're talking to me. Eh-woah. I love you guys. I'm out in the woods of Tennessee, drowning in a sea of red. Yall keep away the disillusionment, and give me much needed hope.

Much like the Russian fb ads he paid for, @realDonaldTrump's purpose is to sew discord amongst the American people. While we are divided, he joins the Russians in holding our species hostage with nuclear power. He won't just go away. He has to be stopped. #GoVoteTN #ImpeachTrump
@MuellerSheWrote, if this sanctions bill hearing says anything, I think it says the US is afraid of Russia's nuclear power. Is the Trump administration acting out of greed or fear? Is that what the citizens don't know? #imafraid #apocalypse #RussiaInvestigation #makeitbetter
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump You know why this is stupid af? Bc you do NOTHING about the young and able nazis. Bc you let them powder your ass via the NRA. Nice attempt at grabbing some praise, "Hey look you guys! We aren't bumbling, immoral assholes! We're deporting a white!"#pathetic #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
She's a hypocrite. Probably too self-absorbed to even remember doing it. I see a lot of #metoo folks defending her. I'm a #metoo folk, but it is a black or white issue. No means no. Pedophilia is wrong always. We can't be Grey to make ourselves feel better about being duped. https://t.co/NbzY4B1gLq
