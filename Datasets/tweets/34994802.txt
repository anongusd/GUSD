Now to go see how many followers i chased away
AND DONE
Gradually, I drifted off to sleep, pranging ducks on the wing and getting off spectacular hip shots.
Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.  The greatest Christmas gift I had ever received or would ever receive.
All was right with the world.  Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.Is that beautiful!
That Christmas would live in our memories as the Christmas when we were introduced to Chinese turkey.
But you see...  What?It's smiling at me.Okay?Beautiful!
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.Oh, I'm sorry.It's a beautiful duck.It really is.
No! Not, “ra ra ra ra ra.” “La la la la la.”  Sing like this:again.Stop!Sing something else.No!Stop!
Gone. All gone.  All right. Everybody upstairs.Get dressed.We are going out to eat.
All gone. No turkey. No turkey sandwiches.  No turkey salad. No turkey gravy, turkey hash, turkey à la king or gallons of turkey soup.
The heavenly aroma still hung heavy in the house. But it was gone.
the most unthinkable disasters descend upon us.  Oh, turkey!Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!
Sometimes at the height of our reveries, when our joy is at its zenith when all is most right with the world...
I had pulled it off! But I left my gun outside.When you get dressed you can go out and get your gun.Hold that on there.Life is like that.
You'll get worms!But what about my glasses?You can wear the old ones with the crack in them until we get you some new ones.
You stay away from that turkey! It's got an hour to cook.
Those icicles have been known to kill people.What's going on up there? - Nothing. We'll be right down.
And I tried to get out of the way, but I There, see, it's just a little bump.You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.
Wake up, Randy.Oh, God.It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.
There was this icicle and it fell off the garage and it hit me.What is it? - No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.
It would work. It had to work. Quickly, I whipped up some tears.  What's the matter, honey? What happened?What happened? Let me see that.
Randomly, my mind evolved a spectacular plot.  Let's see, an icicle!  Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!
Stop!Oh, no!Oh, no! Pulverized.  For a moment I thought, I'll fake it. They'll never know the lens is gone!
Few things brought such swift and terrible retribution on a kid as a pair of busted glasses
She hadn't seen! She didn't know!My eye's all right. The BB must've hit my glasses.  My glasses! Oh, no!  Where are my glasses?
You'll shoot your eye out, you'll shoot your eye out!  Ralphie, you be careful out there. Don't shoot your eye out!
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!  You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
A bona fide garley turkicanus freak. A few days before Christmas his eyes would begin to gleam with a wild and ravenous light.
Now it is well known throughout the Midwest that the old man is a turkey junkie.
Don't shoot any animals or birds! - Except the Bumpuses' dogs!Be careful, Ralphie!
I had one when I was eight years old.What if he hurts himself? Ralphie, your coat!
But outside.I still say those things are dangerous.Put on your galoshes and your coat. It's cold out.
Don't. They run all over.Close her up. Close it up.Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?Sure. - Okay.
Oh, it was beautiful. I could hardly wait to try it out.  Do you know how to load it?That's right.Be careful.
Why don't you go check it out?What did we put over there, honey?Santa Claus probably put it.
That's funny.What's that over there behind the desk?Where?Behind the desk, against the wall over there.
Did you get everything you wanted?Well, almost. – Almost?Well, that's life.Well, there's always next Christmas.
It's not good either, but...  You want a sip? – No, you don't.Did you have a nice Christmas?Yeah, pretty nice.
Who's going to clean the papers up? - Not me.Randy did it last year. - Well, he can do it again. You know, this wine is not bad.
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits. Go on and take it off.Take it off!Will you look at that mess?
Are you happy wearing that?Do you want to take it off?You tell the kid to take it off
Shut up, Randy.He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.He does not! – He does, too.He looks like a pink nightmare.
That is the most precious thing I've ever seen in my life.
could easily make life at Warren G. Harding School a veritable hell.  Isn't that cute?
Come down here so I can see you better.I just hoped Flick would never spot them as the word of this humiliation
Right now!Immediately my feet began to sweat as those two fluffy little bunnies with the blue button eyes stared sappily up at me.
Do you like it? – Yes, very much. Very much.Ralphie.We're waiting.Oh, come on, Mom.
Only one way to find out, isn't there?Well, it's a blue ball!It's a bowling ball.Thank you, darling.
And this is for Daddy.Here.From me to you.Thanks a lot.I wonder what it could be?
While Ralphie is changing, I'm going to play Santa Claus.Now, let me see what can I find. I see something! Randy. This is for you, honey.
I don't want to!Go upstairs right now and try on that present! She went to all that trouble to make it! Now go on.
She just always gives you the nicest things, Ralphie.Oh, isn't that sweet? Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...
Aunt Clara had for years labored under the delusion that I was not only perpetually four years old, but also a girl.
I don't want to.Ralphie, show everybody what Aunt Clara gave you.
Didn't I get a tie this year?A zeppelin! - A can of Simonize.Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you? Show everybody.
Christmas had come. Officially. We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you right over there.She always sends you such wonderful presents.
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.Come on, Ralphie. - Who should I start with?Well, give Randy a present.
Randy, no. Wait for Christmas to start, honey.I want to play Santa!Well, wait a minute, Randy.He played Santa last year, didn't he?
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!Does this raise?Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas, you two.
Santa Claus had come!  Wow! A truck! That's mine!Wow, look over here! That's mine!What's in here?It's hard.
All right, you two, upstairs.Go on the double, on the double.Okay, let's get them.Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells a little while ago, going up the other side of the street.
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up this house just because some boys weren't in bed when he came by.
It's just... Let me get it fixed. That's all right.  Perfect.Oh, goodness, look at the time.
That star is crooked.That star is perfectly straight.Oh, you've got to be careful. – I am.
Oh, Ralph.My, isn't that pretty?That son of a gun.Yeah. No.
A fuse is out.The old man could replace fuses quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.  He bought them by the gross.
I'm not color blind, either.There, see, I told you it was green.Hold it! Don't anybody move!Hold it right there!
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.Oh, don't tell me what color it is.I'm not color blind.
Bye, Chris.That's fine.Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!Well, the green string is out.
Don't worry, he knows.He always knows.Merry Christmas.Okay, down you go.
Well, did you see Santa Claus?Did you tell him what you wanted for Christmas?Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy all year?No.
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.Merry Christmas.Ho Ho HoooI'll see you in Oz, folks.
I want an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle.
Okay, get him out of here.A football! Oh, no. What was I doing? Wake up, stupid, wake up!
How about a nice football?Football. What's a football?  Without conscious will, my voice squeaked out: Football.
My mind had gone blank. Frantically I tried to remember what it was I I was blowing it, blowing it.
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people waiting here, so get going!What do you want for Christmas, little boy?
Come on, kid.Come on up.And what's your name, little boy?Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!
Santa can't wait all night.Come on up on Santa's lap.Get moving, kid.Quit dragging your feet.Get him out of here.
Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00 and our store is closing. 9:00! Great Scott! The store is gonna close!
Get him off my lap.Quick, get me a towel.I hate the smell of tapioca.
There's a wet one. And what's your name, little boy?Billy.Come on, Randy.And what do you want for Christmas, Billy? A toy truck?
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute past 9:00, he can kiss my foot. Come on up on Santa's lap.
I like the Tin Man.
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.My pretty What a tasty little boy.Don't bother me. I'm thinking.I like The Wizard of Oz.
I like Santa. Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers. Moments before zero hour, it did not pay to take chances.
Come on.The line waiting to see Santa stretched all the way back to Terre Haute! And I was at the end of it.
We're going up to see Santa. The line ends here. It begins there.Merry Christmas!Come on, come up, boys and girls. Hurry up.
Come on. Let's go.Young man.Hey, kid. Just where do you think you're going?
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him. We'll see you later, okay? Stay together, you hear? And don't get lost.
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.
Come on, Ralphie.Merry Christmas!Come on, Randy, hurry up.Ralphie, look over there.
There he is!Santa!Have you been a good boy? Have you?Can we go now? Can we go? - Yes, we can go now.
Mom, this is just the same old dumb parade as last year.Ralphie, will you please calm down. – Mom  Hush! - Shut up, Ralphie!
The store's going to close soon and Santa will be gone.Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace. Just be still!
Santa!Yeah, I'll ask Santa.Of course! Santa. The big man. The head honcho. The connection.  My mother had slipped up this time.  Mickey
was pushed out of my mind as I struggled for a way out of the impenetrable BB gun web in which my mother had me trapped.
Strange. Even something as monumental as "The Scut Farkus Affair" as it came to be known...
From then on, things were different between me and my mother.  More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe. But Bears, never.
I slowly began to realize I was not about to be destroyed.  The Chicago Bears. The terror of the midway.
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had. He'll freeze his keister off out there.
You know how boys are.I gave him a talking to.I see that the Bears are playing Green Bay on Sunday.Oh, yeah.
Now try not to do that anymore.So what else happened today?Nothing much.Ralphie had a fight.A fight?What kind of a fight?
Where's your glasses?Did you lose your glasses again?Ralphie.Remember, you left these on the radio again.
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!Hey, come on, what's for dinner? I'm starving to death.Well, what happened today?
Get out of here!Go on home, you mangy mutts. Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...  Hey, Bumpus!
I heard the car roar up the driveway, and a wave of terror broke over me.He'll know what I said, the awful things that I said.
You would?Here you go.All right?I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.
Yes, he is, too.No, he's not.I promise you Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.Why don't you come out of there?Would you like some milk?
Almost time for my father to come home from work.  What's the matter? What you crying for?Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.No, he's not.
Here, dry off.All right, calm down.All right. Now go lie down.The light was getting purple and soft outside.
Settle down.I want you to go in there and lie down in your room for a while.Ralphie, just settle down.
We're going home. Come on.Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.Put your head down in here. Come on, get down in here.
I became conscious that a steady torrent of obscenities...and swearing of all kinds was pouring out of me as I screamed.Ralphie!
Did you hear what he said?I have since heard of people under extreme duress speaking in strange tongues.
Something had happened. A fuse blew and I had gone out of my skull.  I'm telling my dad!Hey, Ralphie!Beat him up! Beat him up!
Deep in the recesses of my brain a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on. Cry!
Listen, jerk. When I tell you to come, you better come! What? Are you going to cry now?
Hey, four-eyes!How'd you like your snowball sandwich?Maybe you'd like another one!
I was surrounded by happier kids who were all going to get what they wanted for Christmas.
These multiplication questions were most missed in our last math test.Would you answer in unison, please?
Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?
My mother must have gotten to Miss Shields.  There could be no other explanation.  You'll shoot your eye out. You'll shoot your eye out.
However, I was disappointed in the margins.This is it. “C+"? No, it can't be. C+? C+!Oh, no!  "You'll shoot your eye out"?
All right, class. I have your Christmas themes for you. I'm pleased. In general, you did very well.
I left Flick to certain annihilation. But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.  Uncle! Uncle!
Who, me?No, your Aunt Tilly. - Yeah, you. Get over here!
I can't now, Grover. I've gotta go see Miss Shields.Hey, come here! Get over here!Come on, you! Hey, come here!You! Come here!
Ordinarily, if Dill so much as said "hi" to you, you felt great warm inside. But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun. – A Flit gun?Stop right there!
Know what I'm getting my old man for Christmas?What? – A rose that squirts.People come to smell it, it squirts them.
Now I could never be sure &gt;but I thought that I heard the sound of taps being played gently.
Later that night, alone in the backyard he buried it next to the garage.
With as much dignity as he could muster the old man gathered up the sad of his shattered major award.
The old man stood quivering with fury stammering as he tried to come up with a real crusher. All he got out was: Not a finger!
Now it was out.Get the glue.We're out of glue.You used up all the glue on purpose!
Jealous because I won.That's ridiculous! Jealous?Jealous of what?That is the ugliest lamp I have ever seen in my entire life!
I broke your lamp.Don't you touch that!You were always jealous of this lamp.Jealous of a plastic leg?Jealous!
What was that? What happened?What happened?What broke?I don't know what happened.I was watering my plant and...
You filthy system!I hate it!Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!What happened next was a family controversy for years.
Son of a bitch!I went out to face the world again.Wiser.Red cabbage?No, that's for tomorrow night. You love red cabbage, Ralphie.
Every pore vibrated.It was almost clear.Yes!Ovaltine?A crummy commercial?
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!I'll be right out, for crying out loud!Almost there! My fingers flew.My mind was a steel trap.
I was getting closer now. The tension was terrible. What was it? The fate of the planet may hang in the balance.
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!
What was Little Orphan Annie trying to say? Be sure to what?  Ralphie! Randy has got to go! Will you please come out?
be right down, Ma.Gee whiz.“T. O.”  Be sure to." Be sure to what?
Ah! "B." I went to the next."E." The first word is "be"!"S." It was coming easier now. "U."Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.
Ninety seconds later I'm in the only room in the house where a boy of nine can sit in privacy and decode.
That's a message from Annie herself. Remember, don't tell anyone.
Pierre was in great voice tonight. I could tell that tonight's message was really important.3. 25.
Set your pins to B-2. Here is the message.12. 1 1. 2I am in my first secret meeting.25. 14. 1 1. 18 16. 23
Remember, kids, only members of Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message. Remember, Annie is depending on you.
Now it's time for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle.
Listen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of The Black Pirate Ship.
Honors and benefits. Already at the age of nine.Come on. Let's get on with it.I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.
and is entitled to all the honors and benefits occurring thereto.”  Signed, Little Orphan Annie.  Countersigned, Pierre Andre!  In ink!
All right! Be it known to all that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed a member of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle
was about to pay off. I got it. “Master Ralph Parker.” My decoder pen!
The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine, in order to get the Ovaltine inner seal to send off for Little Orphan Annie secret decoder pen,
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.Merry Christmas.Happy New Year.You can take your seat now, Ralph.
I just thought that you'd be getting tired of the same old stuff. Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.
Thank you, Flick.Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.
I'll never forgive myself. - Thanks, Mom.I told you not to use Lifebuoy.I feel awfulThank you, HeatherMerry Christmas. - Merry Christmas
What brought you to this?Soap poisoning.Oh, how could we do it?I'll manage to get along, somehow.
Ralph, please tell us no matter how it hurts. What did we do?Look, I can't.Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.
Blind? Oh, my God!Ralph, is it something we did?What brought you to this lonely state?
Why, it's Ralph! Well, come on in, Ralph. Where've you been?Why, he's carrying a cane!What is it, Ralph? What happened?Why, he's blind!
that he would be stricken blind before he reached 21. And then they'd be sorry.
Three blocks away, Schwartz was getting his. There has never been a kid who didn't believe vaguely but insistently,
I'll come in, and if any lights are on Don't you give me that look! You're gonna get it!
Get right into bed, and I don't want to see any lights on. You are being punished, so no comic book reading!
Another shot of mysterious, inexorable, official justice.Rinse out and go to bed. Am I glad you finished your homework!
Do you know where he heard it?Probably from his father.No! He heard it from your son!What?What'd I do, Mom?Why? I didn't do nothing!
Schwartz!I see.Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.Mrs. Schwartz, do you know what Ralph just said?No.He said...Not that!Yes, that.
It was his true medium. A master. But I chickened out. And I blurted out the first name that came to mind.
might work in oils or clay.
Now I had heard that word at least 10 times a day from my old man. My father worked in profanity the way other artists
You ready to tell me?All right. Where did you hear that word?
Heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness. Lifebuoy, on the other hand...
My personal preference is for Lux, but I found Palmolive had a nice piquant, after-dinner flavor.
Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.
No. What?I'll tell you what he said. Randy!Ralphie!
Mere child's play compared to what surely awaited me.  Everything go all right?Eight minutes.Do you know what your son just said?
What would it be? The guillotine? Hanging?  The chair? The rack? The Chinese water torture?
What did you say?That's what I thought you said.Get in the car.Go on.It was all over. I was dead.
Only I didn't say "fudge." I said the word. The big one. The queen mother of dirty words. The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.
Oh, fudge!
For one brief moment I saw all the bolts silhouetted against the lights of the traffic. And then they were gone.
There it is. That son of a gun. I'm gonna get that dirty There we go.
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.There's four of them. And we got it!
Yeah, that's it. Here. Hold this. No, not that way. Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.How? – Like this.
Mom says I should help.Okay, sit down here. Squat down.
It was the first time that it had been suggested that I go help my father with anything.  What are you doing here
Ralphie, why don't you go help your father?Really? Can I? - Yes.Watch the traffic, there. - Okay.
My old man's spare tires were actually only tires in the academic sense. were round. They had once been made of rubber.
Four minutes!Time me.Actually, my old man loved it. He always saw himself in the pits at the Indianapolis Speedway in the 500.
This is a very nice tree.I'll throw in some rope and tie it to your car for you.You got a deal.Deal.Damn it. Blow out!Not again.
You know, Dew Lock just bought one of those brand new green plastic trees. Darn thing looks like it was made out of green pipe cleaners.
The old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader and he was twice as shrewd.
This isn't one of those trees that all the needles falls off, is it?No, that's them balsams.
How much? – I'll knock off $2 because I can see you're a man who knows his trees.
Wait'll the dogs see that one. - Don't you think it's a little large?Listen, Christmas only comes once a year. Why not?
Well, you just put it in the corner.Haven't you got a big tree? – Hell, this ain't no tree.Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.
Okay. Now here's a tree.This here is a tree.That's a little skimpy in the front.
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree than this here tree.This here tree is built to last.Ain't no needles coming off this here tree
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.You folks looking for a tree? We got 300 trees.This is the Christmas tree emporium of the entire Midwest
folklore of Cleveland Street to this very day.  Don't want to waste electricity.Don't want to waste electricity.”
My mother was about to make another brilliant maneuver in the legendary battle of the lamp. The epic struggle which followed lives in the
Come on, you guys. Get in the car. Get in the car. If we don't hurry we're going to miss all the good trees!
Well, you can take your seat now.Take your seat.
Ralph, an “A+.” My Ralph! Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud. A+”!  Is there something you want, Ralph?I'm just turning in my theme.
A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time.” Sheer poetry.
Ralphie Parker. The theme I've been waiting for all my life. Listen to this sentence.
Oh, I should weep if I have to read one more “F”!
You call this a paragraph? Margins! Margins! “F”! My life's work down the drain. A semicolon, you dolt! A period.  “F”!
would excuse me from theme writing for the rest of my natural life.
I knew I was handing Miss Shields a masterpiece. Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,
Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time. Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.  I could still taste it.  Hey, you turned the light off
Holy smokes, it was 6:45. Only one thing that could've dragged me away from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.
The symbol of the old man's victory.  Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.Isn't it about time for somebody's favorite radio program?
The entire neighborhood was turned on.  You should see what it looks like from out here!It could be seen up and down Cleveland Street.
It is a lamp, you nincompoop. But it's a major award.I won it.Damn, hell, you say you won it? - Yeah.Mind power, Sweed, mind power.
It's a major award.A major award?Shucks, I wouldn't have known that. It looks like a lamp.
Right there. That's wonderful.Parker, what is that?Don't bother me now. Can't you see I'm busy?Yeah, but what is that? –
Move it a little bit to the right. A little that way. Just a little... More to the right. More. That's it. No, stop!
Turn off all the lights.I wanna see what it looks like from the street.I'll go get the dining room. - Couldn't we talk this over?
Look at that! Will you look at that?Isn't that glorious?It's indescribably beautiful. It reminds me of the Fourth of July!
Well, let's see.The snap of a few sparks, a quick whiff of ozone and the lamp blazed forth in unparalleled glory.
Honey? - No. It's all right.Let's see...This goes to the radio and this goes to the Well, it's just one too many.
The old man's eyes boggled overcome by art.  I know just the place for it. Right in the middle of our front room window!
This is a lamp.It was indeed a lamp.  Isn't that great? What a great lamp!I don't know.Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.
Ralphie! My mother was trying to insinuate herself between us and the statue.  Holy smoke, would you… Do you know what this is?
Well, it's a leg.You know, like in a statue.Statue?Yeah, statue!Yeah, statue!
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.Would you look at that? - What?Would you look at that?What is it?It's a leg!But what is it?
Oh, yeah.Here we go.They did a job on this, you know?No, here, Ralph, hold this.There could be anything in there!Maybe they forgot
Merry Christmas.Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie. Go on.Fra-gee-ley.”  That must be Italian. – I think that says “fragile.”
Right.Here, bring it right in, fellas. That's it. Here we go.A little more. Little more.That's it.Watch the lady. Thanks a lot, guys
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here. Move your tails.Bring it right on in. Right here. Bring it ahead. Straight ahead. That's right.
All right, sign here. - Yeah. Well, what is it?I don't know.What's in it?Here. Bring it in.
Show me how the piggies eat.Be a good boy. Show Mommy how the piggies eat.Oh, my.Mommy's little piggy.It's here.Are you Parker?
My mother was more subtle.How do the little piggies go?That's right. Oink, oink.Now, show me how the piggies eat. This is your trough
All right. I'll get that kid to eat. Where's my screwdriver and plumber's helper? I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.
Can I please have some more?My mother had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.Meatloaf Meatloaf, double beetloaf. I hate meatloaf
Stop playing with your food, or I'll give you something to cry about.You better stop fooling around with it and eat it or you'll be sorry
Starving people would be happy to have that.Can I have some more red cabbage?
My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily in over three years.Oh, Randy, don't play with your food, eat it!
Yeah, well. How about eating? I'm starving to death.Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.Every family has a kid who won't eat.
They could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean I didn't expect they were going to send the whole damn bowling alley.
How are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight?
Or it could be a bowling alley.A guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley.
You know, maybe it'll be one of those Spanish adobe houses down in Coral Serves you right, you smelly buggers.
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me. It's my gift.
He said the telegram was late, the prize was already there he was going to send it on tonight.
What does this mean here?It means it's coming tonight!I called Ernie McClosky at the freight depot.
Hey, look at that. Look at that. A Western Union telegram. Tonight, he's coming tonight. Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!
I won!I won!
And they ignored every other human being on earth but my old man.
The Bumpus hounds. Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, had at least 785 smelly hound dogs.
I've won! I've won!
Oh, rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil with such feverish fluidity.
I don't think that a football's a very good Christmas present.
I think that everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun. They're very good for Christmas.
What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time.Wow, that's great.
No matter. Today I had serious work to do.What I want for Christmas.
Weeks ago I had sent away for my Little Orphan Annie secret society decoder pen. Oh, skunked again.
In the jungles of kid-dom, the mind switches gears rapidly.
INTERMISSION
In our world, you were either a bully, a toady or one of the nameless rabble of victims.All right.Who's next?
Randy lay there like a slug. It was his only defense.Say “uncle.”Uncle!Louder!
Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady. Mean. Rotten. His lips curled over his green teeth.
Scut Farkus, staring out at us with his yellow eyes. He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes.
Scut Farkus!Scut Farkus! What a rotten name. We were trapped. There he stood, between us and the alley.
Did it hurt, Flick?No. I never felt a thing. It just caught me off-guard.You sure were bawling.I never bawled!Baloney.
Boy, did you see how it stuck?
and everything would work out, somehow.
knew that when Miss Shields read my magnificent, eloquent theme that she would sympathize with my plight
I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of black cave of doom.I
And I want it handed in tomorrow morning...
“What I want for Christmas.”The clouds lifted.
Now, boys and girls, I'm going to give you an assignment. I want you to write a theme.
Adults love to say things like that. But kids know better. We knew darn well it was always better not to get caught.
That's all I'm going to say about poor Flick.
Now, don't you feel terrible? Don't you feel remorse for what you have done?
guilt you feel is far worse than any punishment you might receive.
Now, I know that some of you put Flick up to this. But, he has refused to say who. But those who did it know their blame. And I'm sure the
Yes, Esther Jane? Oh, my!Holy cow, it's the fire department! Wow, it's the cops!
He was at recess, wasn't he? Ralphie, do you know where Flick is? I said has anyone seen Flick?
Where's Flick? Has anyone seen Flick?Flick? Flick who?
What are we going to do? - I don't know! The bell rang!
Ralphie, come back!  Come back! Don't leave me! Come back! - But the bell rang!
Jeez! It really works!Look at him!
This is nothing. Thtuck? Thtuck!Thtuck! Thtuck!
Flick's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer. There was no going back now.
All right, all right.Go on, smart ass, and do it! - I'm going!
Schwartz created a slight breach of etiquette by skipping the triple-dare and going right for the throat.
I triple dog-dare you!
And finally, the coup de grâce of all dares the sinister triple dog-dare!
Now it was serious. A double dog-dare. What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?
That's 'cause you know it will stick!You're full of it.Well, I double dog-dare you!
Are you kidding? Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?That's dumb.
Well, I double-dare you.The exact exchange and nuance of phrase in this ritual is very important.
Says who? - Says me.
You're full of beans and so's your old man.
Open your books to Page 32. And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...
Good morning, class. Good morning, Miss Shields.
Miss Shields! All right, everyone take your seats, please.
Get up. Sit up. Come on.You're okay. Come on, let's go.Come on, you're all right!
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.I can't get up!Come on.
Come on, guys, wait up!Come on, guys!Come on, guys, wait up!I can't get up!I can't get up!Help!I can't get out! Help me!
and the fire department had to come to get the guy's tongue off the track because he couldn't get it off.
He knows because he once saw a guy stick his tongue to a railroad track on a bet
Baloney. What would your old man know about anything?
and he says it will freeze right to the pole just like I told you.
Hey, listen, smart ass. I asked my old man about sticking your tongue to metal light poles in winter
What does it look like I'm doing? Picking goobers?
Hey, Flick! Wait up. Wait up!So what are you doing?
Well, put your arms down when you get to school.
I can't put my arms down!
Just wait, Ralph!My kid brother looked like a tick about to pop.What?What is it?What is it?What is it?
Preparing to go to school was like getting ready for extended deep-sea diving. Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
In the heat of battle, my father wove a tapestry of obscenity that as far as we know is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan.
Who the hell turned it all the way down again? Blasted!
Hold it!It's a clinker! That blasted, stupid furnace. Dadgummit! Damn skates! For Chripe's sake, open up the damper, will you?
That son of a bitch would freeze up in the middle of summer on the Equator!
Some men are Baptists, others Catholics. My father was an Oldsmobile man.
Well, son, you saved us! We were goners for sure! And you saved us!Oldsmobile! A pile of junk! That damned Olds is froze up again!
Adiós, Bart. But if you do come back, you'll be pushing up daisies! And don't you forget it!
Okay, Ralphie! You win this time, but we'll be back!
Well, I think I better have a look here.Oh, no! It's OI' Blue! Oh, no!Cheese it, boys!There's another one! He's a dead-eye, ain't he?
Well, just me and my trusty old Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle. Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.
Don't worry, Dad. As long as I got OI' Blue. What've we got here, folks?Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.
Save us, Ralphie! I just knew those bad guys would be coming for us in the end!
where only you, and you alone, stand between your tiny huddled family and insensate evil.
Mothers know nothing about creeping marauders burrowing through the snow toward the kitchen
BB guns are dangerous. I don't want anyone shooting his eye out. Randy, will you eat? There are starving people in China.
I couldn't believe my own ears. Tinkertoys? She'd never buy it.
I was just kidding, even though Flick is getting one. I'd just like some Tinkertoys.
But such was my mania, my desire for a Red Ryder carbine that I immediately began to rebuild the dike.
That deadly phrase uttered many times before by hundreds of mothers was not surmountable by any means known to kid-dom.
Oh, no! It was the classic mother-BB gun block. "You'll shoot your eye out."
No. Shoot your eye out.
Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.I want an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle.
Ralphie, what would you like for Christmas?
Round one was over. Parents, one. Kids, zip.  I could feel the Christmas noose beginning to tighten. Maybe what happened next was inevitable
Hurry up, you're going to be late for school.   Yeah. I'm running late already.
A new furnace.   That's a good one, Dad.   My old man was one of the most feared furnace-fighters in northern Indiana.
Casually, I switched tactics.  Hey, Dad! I'll bet you'll never guess what I got you for Christmas.
They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears. I could tell that I was in imminent danger of over-playing my hand.
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store.
Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right BB gun hint. It had to be firm, but subtle.
Victor? The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
Name the great characters in American literature.
What kind is it this time?
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles. Could be worth $50,000.
That's another one of your silly puzzles?
Everybody knows that.
How the hell did you know that?
Victor. His name is Victor
What is the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
What do you mean, silly? I mean that's real news. That's not like that politics slop.
They write the silliest things in the newspapers.
On a bet. Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.
Swallowed a yo-yo?
Did you hear about this guy who swallowed a yo-yo?
That's nice.Ralphie, on the double!
“Four Eyes” Shottenhoffer, a utility infielder. Got a whole damned team of utility infielders.
Well, for Chripes sake, the Sox traded Bullfrog the only player they've got, for Shottenhoffer.
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.   What's that?
My mother, grabbing for her copy of Look magazine would find herself cleverly trapped into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.
Ralphie! Randy! Down here in two minutes! And I mean two minutes!   Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!   Cut it out.
the Red Ryder range model air rifle indelibly into my parents' subconscious.
My fevered brain seethed with the effort of trying to come up with the infinitely subtle devices necessary to implant
For weeks, I had been scheming to get my mitts on one of these fearsome blue-steel beauties.
In his hand was the knurled stock of as coolly deadly-looking a piece of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.
And there he is. Red Ryder himself.
Wow, there it is. The holy grail of Christmas gifts.  The Red Ryder 200-shot range model air rifle.
First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff, jostled in wonderment before a golden tinkling display of mechanized, electronic joy.
Higbees' corner window was traditionally a high-water mark of the pre-Christmas season.
Downtown Hohman was prepared for its yearly bacchanalia of peace on earth and good will to men.
But no matter. Christmas was on its way. Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas around which the entire kid year revolved.
How could I ever forget it And there I am, with that dumb round face and that stupid stocking cap.
Ah, there it is. My house. And good old Cleveland Street

it seems we've waited so long to start fighting the social agenda of the liberals. Why don't others see what the libs want is unsustainable.
and any individual who opposes liberal programs are immediately labeled as a member of those classes.
Virtual classes of people (capitalists, racists, militants, and war mongers) emerge as the villains
All of the ills of society are brought up, and individuals characterized by wrong thinking are blamed.
Liberals want to change the mindset of the masses using education to teach their kind of "right" thinking,
The liberals employ social engineering approaches in their war using energy, ecology, and race as the banners under which they organize.
