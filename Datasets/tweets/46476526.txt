Good for you, Kate. To enjoy being by yourself is an art because you don‚Äôt need someone else for your happiness. It is great for confidence lessons anxiety.

As of 2019, there are 3.48 billion social media users. I suspected this in 2009  If you are in business, you MUST be on LinkedIn and Twitter; even Facebook. People need to get to know you, form a relationship and trust you. Social Media is a way of building a client list! https://t.co/qYs6hrqwKj
There was confusion of what software was, especially a product that could benefit the masses.  Many people thought software was just fluff.  It was not until standards like Microsoft Windows and Adobe PDF format that standardized "the system" that made "software."
Time changed fast when people now see "software" as the most valuable, albeit intangible, asset, where it used to be the "hardware" that ruled the day. The reason for the shift?  Remember when there were Atari, Commodore 64, Tandy, IBM...?
People questioned me about the value of Twitter. Are you kidding me? I have met the most wonderful people here. Today would not be complete with thanking Alex Marty (@Alphaomega24 who has made such a difference in my life. I could not have gotten thru the last year without him.

Gratitude is an emotion similar to appreciation that most people are familiar with. What many people don‚Äôtnknow is gratitude plays an important role in several historical movements &amp; gratitude is now becoming an important part of psychology research.
Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously. And because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include all things in your gratitude.‚Äù		‚Äï Ralph Waldo Emerson

Crises marked by anxiety, doubt &amp; despair have been periods of personal unrest that occur when a person is sufficiently unsettled to have an opportunity for personal growth. We must see our feelings of uneasiness as our chance for choosing growth or fear.
All things, even the deepest sorrow or the most profound happiness are all temporary. Hope is fuel for the soul, without hope, forward motion ceases.
‚ÄúA virtuos woman is not moved by big names and flamboyance, but only by people of profound wisdom and integrity.

We are born as babies and we control  only two things. They are	what we take in and what we put out. As we progress through life, we add to what we control and what we do not control. So, my question is, when we can have control, why do we allow others to control and us? https://t.co/5cx8RkUBc3
