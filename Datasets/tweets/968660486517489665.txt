@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump When it comes down to it, I am for allowing many of these economic refugees in. I don't necessarily agree low skilled labor is bad for the economy, and I think helping people is good. I would prefer refugees from war torn areas. The root problem is the cartels and bad employers.
@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump But yes, I am for moving money in the budget from overseas security operations to border security operations, which might involve retrained military or new hires. Particularly at ports and to deal with overstays.
@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump A major issue is the burden on immigration courts. When someone is on U.S. soil and claims asylum they have a right to be heard. If we stop them before they get here, they can't claim the same way. Repubs. say 80%ish of claims fail, while many who claim find black market jobs.
@RepDeSaulnier @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I truly hope you believe it will get past a veto, but I highly doubt it will.
@RepDeSaulnier @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rep DeSaulnier, how can you really think this matters? I am all for Congress being in control of the ship of state, but if you're focused on measures which won't get past a veto, I genuinely don't understand how Congress can lead. #Symbolic #Veto #Gridlock #RandPaul #KY #CA
@mauradolan Thanks for your story on the California Supreme Court ruling regarding the elimination of the airtime benefit. https://t.co/iZxlpnjv24 #California #LATimes #Pensions #Budget #News #SupremeCourt
@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump Fentanyl overdoses killed 70,000 people in 2017 and that is labelled an international crisis. Why aren't the appx. 30% of women making the trip being sexually assaulted as much of a crisis? They should be. If they don't believe they can cross, they won't pay rapists to take them.
@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump I think 500,000 people apprehended at the Southern Border is unfairly represented as a "low" number. I understand it's trending downward. If Congress voted for physical barriers under Obama why can't that be what's working? It could be other things. What do you think it is?
@GeistPoliti @realDonaldTrump Lol fair enough, but I do want to point out that POTUS makes a financial argument for the wall. He argues that the long term economic impact of having less low skilled workers in the economy, less drugs, less human trafficking, etc. will make the wall a financial investment.

@Narcomania Happy to second the notion that relying on sex for clicks is wrong and mocking criminals is low brow.
@Narcomania Normal, but do you support it? I mean to me, contraband into prisons is bad. Maybe you see it as a non issue, but particularly in regards to coordination amongst criminal networks and providing hard drugs to addicts I see it as serious. Like I said, the weed I see as unimportant.
@TwitterGaming @Halo for sure
@Narcomania Right, so I take it you may disagree with me, but I believe she should have been punished and jail time may have been totally appropriate. Frankly, I'm for allowing prisoners to smoke legal weed, sounds like reform. To me it's all about the act of smuggling and the cell phone.
@Narcomania Reading this headline I struggle to see how you see this as punishment for weed and not punishment for contraband smuggling. To me prisoner cell phone use is particularly punishable, as it allows crime networks to influence the world outside prison. Will read the full story.

@RepSchneider Lol oh is 240 yes votes, mostly @HouseDemocrats and 190 no votes, mostly @HouseGOP bipartisan now?
@RepShalala You're touting this bill passing the house as a victory, but if you were honest, you would admit this bill has no chance of being made law. It will not pass The Senate full stop. You are wasting legislative time.
@FiveThirtyEight A waste of time by the @HouseDemocrats . The chances of it passing a veto are slim to none.

@TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats Yet it's clearly bipartisan in name only. 8ish @HouseGOP members voted for it. Would love to see their response as to whether: A. this bill is truly bipartisan and B.

@moore3t1 @chinghizm @tedlieu I personally disapprove of Congress very much. They refuse to debate on substance and are merely partisan mouthpieces of national organizations rather mouthpieces of diverse constituencies.
@moore3t1 @chinghizm @tedlieu I'm not disputing that point at all. Of course the framers expected The President would need to uphold the law, and set the bar of impeachment at high misdemeanor crimes. I simply believe that they expected Congress to hold ethics above partisanship, impeachment then indictment.
@RepDeSaulnier As you can see #HR8 is a sharply partisan bill. It is highly unlikely to pass the Senate. It is unfortunate that you are wasting your time as a congressperson on symbolic rather than practical measures. It's as if Apple only released concept art for new phones.
@its_outta_here @tedlieu @Julie_0608x @realDonaldTrump I frankly don't agree we have seen enough evidence - An independent voter.
@Bella_Davis @tedlieu On that same note, nothing in the Constitution says the President can't pardon himself. Things that aren't explicitly prohibited in the Constitution may nonetheless be arguably prohibited by implication.
@chinghizm @tedlieu On that same note, nothing in the Constitution says the President can't pardon himself. Things that aren't explicitly prohibited in the Constitution may nonetheless be arguably prohibited by implication. So this trendy form of debate is not more than inconsistent farce to me

@brianschatz It's just very unclear to me how you appropriated the money. If you were sufficiently broad saying, for example, "this is money for all military construction" then I don't agree with the implication that there's a problem with this emergency. Where is the money coming from?

@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier @realDonaldTrump Smart wall sounds fine with me, and btw is in  line with POTUS' campaign promises when he promised sensors which would detect tunneling below the wall. Another partisan talking point is "he said Mexico would pay for it!" Yes, eventually, not immediately or no wall is built...
@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier To me that idea of illegal immigration statistics being at a 20 year low is a Democratic talking point and thoroughly misleading. 500,000 people were apprehended at the Southern border alone last year. Do you genuinely think that's not a ton of people?
@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier At the least, a border wall will partially allow us to further control our immigration system. That is an admirable goal that doesn't deserve dismissal as "racist." It's putatively bipartisan, but The Democrats see a campaign issue so they're refusing to move the issue forward.
@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier Additionally, I thoroughly agree that a wall won't fix our immigration and trade system but partisan reps &amp; The Democrats have not publicized an alternative plan and have disappointed me greatly in not overcoming the very low bar set by POTUS in his border security plan.
@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier Informed speculation on my part is that it's coming from funds Congress appropriated The Executive for "military construction" that was earmarked for military housing but earmarked by The Executive and not The Congress, and therefore The Executive can easily change its mind.
@DudekLinda @RepDeSaulnier Hm ok....well save this tweet, because if it gets vetoed and then doesn't get past the veto it's a big ol' waste of time that could be spent pushing bipartisan measures or moving away from partisanship.
@GeistPoliti @RepDeSaulnier Interesting take but I doubt it will erode much of his political currency. I'm an Independent and POTUS was my 4th choice for Pres behind 3rd parties, and I think he's on the right side of this issue. The bar for emergencies is very low, and it seems he's taking legal funds.

More like probably it won't, longshot it will. I am open to being wrong, what makes you think it will overcome the veto, do you have a source?

@JussieSmollett Hi Jussie, I want to let you know that I am unsure of your guilt, and just as many were quick to judge the guilt of those who attacked you without knowing the full picture, they are rushing to judge you. Innocent until PROVEN guilty. If you are guilty, apologize!
@DrJillStein Why can't there be a public and respectable Green Party poll on the issue? Should be done in cases like this, and in many others and it would elevate the standing of the @GreenPartyUS and likely wouldn't be prohibitively expensive. #pollthepeople

@Dylan_Sipes89 @birbigs @TuckerCarlson Hey I'll admit Tucker Carlson does the exact same thing often. But anytime someone talks over someone else I call it a monologue, not a debate.

https://t.co/TsztLx3H4U @TuckerCarlson Opportunity to talk about a credible hate crime. Bring on the victims! Get ahead of this one. Not good optics for those who want to frame hate crimes as a crime solely perpetrated by angry white fat old men.
@birbigs Uh well idk, this Dutch historian, though he makes points I find compelling, does talk over @TuckerCarlson pretty frequently. I would say it was more a monologue than a debate. Maybe an interesting monologue, but not a debate. Also, what does this prove about Tucker's debating?

@micahh64 https://t.co/ljZOwViVpS Hey Micah, at minute 48 a reporter says something like "it appears American taxpayers will have to pay for the wall," and POTUS explains wall will be built then Mexico will reimburse. Granted the campaign was over, but partially proves my point.
@steveo Lol jk
@steveo FUCK YOU STEVE-O
@cmilburn586 @micahh64 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris Right, so actually Chris, I think Micah has a point, which is that Donald Trump has YET to get Mexico to pay for the wall, but he is working on it.
@micahh64 @cmilburn586 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris Also, Micah, do you think he could have secured wall funding without Democratic support?
@micahh64 @cmilburn586 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris Micah I'm curious what your opinion is on the other "emergencies" that are on the books...do you consider them genuine emergencies for the American people? What's the difference? I don't see it. If anything an insecure border is more of an emergency than any other imo.
@micahh64 @cmilburn586 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris I agree with you Micah that the trade deal has yet to be approved by Congress, but I am fairly certain he said the wall would be built immediately, and funding would come from Mexico eventually, not that the wall wouldn't be built unless Mexico paid for it.

@micahh64 @cmilburn586 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris The promise was also that the wall would be built even if Mexico wouldn't pay at first.		500,000 people caught may be the lowest in years but is not a low number
@micahh64 @cmilburn586 @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris Micah it's not accurate to say that GOP control of the House and Senate meant they could pass anything they wanted. There weren't over 60 votes in the Senate for the wall.
@kaehvogel @goldblum_zeno @KamalaHarris This has been in the national conversation, so people have been batting eyes imo. Also, national emergencies aren't things you legally "have to do"
@micahh64 @KamalaHarris Micah I get it, but having to do something is not the standard for national emergencies. Name a national emergency of the many still standing we absolutely had to declare, I'll wait.

@RepDeSaulnier Mr. DeSaulnier, I encourage you to fully review all national emergencies which currently stand, which in my opinion make you seem inconsistent on the issue of national emergencies
@chrislhayes Somehow people always forget that in his campaign promises he said he would build the wall regardless of how negotiations with Mexico went and that he would at some point have gotten enough money from them otherwise that it would have offset it. He is already making this argument
@BarbaraBoxer I wouldn't be opposed to it policy wise, but Democrats have a lot of work to do to sway independents and I think they really don't realize it.
@seanhannity @TheDemocrats are willing to sell out their animosity towards rape culture simply because @realDonaldTrump supports something. Terrorism is no national emergency if the southern border isn't an emergency! (Bet they won't answer your Q)
@seanhannity Yes, because the bar is low for national emergencies. Terrorism is currently an emergency, yet the number of people killed by terrorists vs. the number of women raped at the southern border suggest the southern border is the emergency. We need legislation on national emergencies.
What everyone in power misses is the deep dissatisfaction of the general population with the elite. We see right through their attempts to brainwash us (and yours INFOWARS) and we vote for whoever will unseat them. That's why the House flips. That's why DT is POTUS
@allidoisowen I think @TheDemocrats taking the house was the best thing possible to happen to GOP prospects in 2020. What better to boost a self important media that has been running with menial procedural changes in unfinished cases for 3 years than the idea it might be working?
@dhart2001 @KamalaHarris I don't believe that, what's your best evidence? I'll look into it. Do you have proof? How do you know didn't expect to keep his promises if he was elected even though he didn't expect to win? Didn't the campaign lower the value of his brand until he won? Congress resp. 4 shutdwn
@latimespolitics A true reflection of America :)
@belikethecoolk1 @ValKHeadley @KamalaHarris Even if that were true, it wouldn't be an argument against what either of us said. The question is, are campaign promises more than "vanity projects"? The answer to me is YES. The people who voted for President Trump voted for the wall, and it is THEIR PROJECT too.
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein I think the fact that we caught a few hundred thousand people, and know that over a third of the women in that few hundred thousand we know of were raped, is a crisis, and in fact more of an emergency than terror is in the US
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein If you want my opinion further please answer any of the questions I asked you.
Either terrorism isn't a national emergency and neither is the southern border, or both are, or the southern border is and terrorism isn't, solely taking the number of people hurt as the factor. Open to having my mind changed. https://t.co/njT8jYDPAM #CMV #Immigration #USA
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein Also I'm happy to respectfully end the conversation here but you haven't changed my mind. Please feel free to DM me at any time. Cheers! #Policy #Emergency #Immigration #Terrorism #Debate #Facts #Hearsay #USA #PresidentTrump
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein Look, I saw those reports about Sicario, and they're speculation. Can you show me proof that isn't hearsay? Anyway, it's unimportant. What is important is consistency in policy. Terrorism isn't an emergency, or the southern border is, purely taking the number hurt as the factor.
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein Did you note that they didn't include the number of actual illegal immigrants at the Southern Border, I would argue, because it's such a large number? A decrease in your income from $1 billion to 500 mill may be the lowest in years, but is a lot of money. https://t.co/njT8jYDPAM
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein Granted, I have no data to back me up. Please, if you disagree, I am open to being convinced. I believe more people are hurt crossing the border than are hurt by terrorism. I believe terrorism has been declared a national emergency. Therefore, illogical to say no border emrgncy.
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein Which are more people hurt by? Terrorism or the illegal southern border crossing. More are raped, die, or enslaved through the southern border. Why then should terrorism be an emergency but the southern border not? Should neither be emergencies? Or as I contend, both?
@cinema13 @SenFeinstein That's beside the point. The point is, there are less terrorist incidents that illegal border crossings. Comparable numbers of people die, probably more in perilous border crossing that in terrorist attacks. Southern border has human trafficking of children. It is a crisis.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump President Trump has before demonstrated evidence to a counter hypothesis: He prefers things to be done legislatively. #Dreamer Congress WILL NOT come together in meaningful bipartisan ways on border security. There are national emergencies of much less "emergency" like character.
@SenFeinstein The number of illegal migrations occurring at the southern border, where very many people experience brutal crime, is much higher than the number of terrorist attacks or people who have been hurt by them. Yet terrorism is still a national emergency. Be consistent!
@JoeNBC No, it's a win. Corporate welfare should be ended. No city should make the sweetheart deal New York made, as a matter of principal.

@Avivalicious @JarranSainsbury In my perfect world women who wanted to remove a fetus would then give up responsibility for it and it would go to hospital care, to allow for men who are involved and may really care to take the child after the hospital care or to place the child into well funded foster care
@GIWilson5077 @KamalaHarris Can I ask you what you think the difference is between the government telling women (or men btw) they can't use their bodies to choose to jaywalk across the street and telling them they can't use them to abort a potential life?

Genuine Q. Both seem to me like bodily restrictions.
@Avivalicious @JarranSainsbury Oh and sorry to blow you up, I just find this important and interesting...do you really think laws shouldn't have moral beliefs behind them? How should we decide which laws to make then?
@Avivalicious @JarranSainsbury Also, another example that might make my point: The government tells me I can't use my body to shoot someone. They do that in part to protect people, but also in part because it's wrong to hurt someone. So what's the difference between that and hurting a fetus? They're not human?
@Avivalicious @JarranSainsbury So for me, I'm a vegan, and I generally believe in the principle that causing pain is wrong. Can you speak to that at all? I think causing pain to animals is wrong, and to fetuses. Do you think the pain of the fetus matters?

@gigijensenshow @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi So it would be right? If she resigns, CA gets a new Dem Senator, she looks more pro worker, and she distinguishes herself from all the other Sens. taking time away from their Senate job. Plus makes DT look bad for campaigning in office.
@MaureenRamsden2 @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi True! But shouldn't she be distinguishing herself from other candidates? If she runs pro worker and says "that's why I'm devoting myself to only one full time job" it makes sense. Plus why not build the @TheDemocrats bench &amp; make DT look bad for running in office?

@gigijensenshow @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi Of coure you're aware that the new CA government would appoint a Democratic Senator in her place?
@gigijensenshow @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi What about it do you disagree with?
@SenKamalaHarris Sen. Harris, as your constituent, please resign. If you and any Sen with a Dem. government at home resigned, it would give you more time to campaign while building @TheDemocrats bench. Why would you instead devote yourself to 2 full time jobs? Reelection no prob.
@MaureenRamsden2 @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi Hi, I'm a constituent of Sen. Harris who believes she should resign her office since she's running for President. I don't think she should hold 2 full time jobs (no one should) and I don't think she can represent CA when she's seeking to represent the entire USA. Do you agree?

@Partisangirl Do you have an answer to claims that Maduro seized power or no?
@benjamingedan @latimes But it can facilitate order and peace during a turbulent time. Perhaps an international summit between them, a debate of some form, something like that would be good. It is also important to lay the facts out clearly on the issue.
@TulsiGabbard That being said, we should offer aid and assistance (not weapons) to certain sides. Perhaps invite both Presidents to a debate here in the U.S? Perhaps hosting refugees? There are ways we can positively influence the situation without warfare and without turning a blind eye.
@codepink Wait what? There is no coup going on that I'm aware of, rather an uprising of the people. Democracy in action is not a coup, if done with the people's consent it's their right. What on Earth makes you think the U.S. is forcing regime change?
@FletcherAntoin I don't think that's a fair comparison.
@SarahSmith4WA I agree, no war. But I do believe that we should listen to the majority there and help create peace and order in a kind and considerate way. That may involve speaking out about the situation and educating ourselves on it, but certainly no war and no weapons. Maybe refugee status

@RepDeSaulnier @KTVU Rep. DeSaulnier, as a constituent of yours, I urge you to approach the idea of a wall in good faith, rather than dismissing it offhand. I believe you should demonstrate your willingness to listen to experts, and that if experts recommend a wall, you should support it.
@SenFeinstein Please pressure @SenKamalaHarris to resign from the U.S. Senate. A new Democrat will likely take her place and she will be able to fully focus on her campaign.
@SenKamalaHarris Please resign from the U.S. Senate.
@SenFeinstein Please pressure @SenKamalaHarris to resign her position as Senator if she decides to run for President. She should be committed to one full time job, not two.
@SenKamalaHarris Please resign along with all your @SenateDems colleagues who are running for President if you decide to run. This will put new blood in the Senate, further building the Democratic bench, and demonstrate your commitment to 1 job, rather than a split between 2.
@RepDeSaulnier Please author a bill which gives clean funding to a border wall and then proceed to vote it down in the House, thus demonstrating to @realDonaldTrump there is not popular support in the House for the wall.
@timkaine I absolutely doubt whether you are willing to invest in border security. You were running mate for Clinton and she is in many people's minds for open borders. I have not heard any Democrat argue for their alternative border security plan.
@FoxNewsSunday Panel: To what extent are Tea Party and Libertarian leaders celebrating this Ayn Rand style government shutdown (if at all)? Will making the country poorer have a similar theoretical energizing power to the Socialist wing of the Left? Is the President's base happy?

@Millie__Weaver I would like you to do more reporting on Tony West, the brother in law of Kamala Harris. Why did he start working at Uber right after his former boss Eric Holder finished investigating them (Wikipedia)? Why is Harris anti Catholic (?) if he went to Bellarmine?
https://t.co/C8mGvcum2r Meena Harris (Harvard Law) also runs this clothing company, which sells expensive clothing that raises money for Progressive causes.
Also potentially responsible for the hilarious "I'm just chillin' in Cedar Rapids" Snapchat, as Meena Harris on January 26 2016 on her public Facebook profile said she was "teaching her mom how to Snapchat" then posts a picture of Maya and Hillary.
https://t.co/qvDMalJoXP "Stanford Law Review was one of the most relevant experiences I had at law school, one that I actually draw on now. It involved managing really smart law students and trying to motivate them to do things but not because they were getting paid." UBER LEGAL
Interestingly enough, his "daughter" is really Maya's by another man. Maybe that's why she's protesting Uber (covertly?) in the Business Insider article.
Status above publicly liked by Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark.
July 27, 2016 from Meena Harris on her public Facebook page "My mom is sitting on the stage right now during Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention. I'm so damn proud of this woman. These women"

His daughter now works at Facebook.
https://t.co/s4E5RXpnS6 His daughter protesting tech companies outsourcing their labor to 3rd party contractors while paying them miserly wages and not providing benefits as her dad works as chief counsel for Uber is absolutely priceless.

@KamalaHarris I absolutely agree you should vote, and should vote far more often on bills that will likely be vetoed, but the question should be from a practical standpoint: Will you override the veto? If not, vote anyway, but write new bills.

@Halo @HCS Stoked to be watching the first tournament of this year! https://t.co/PqNi2MOZ2u #Halo #HaloClassic
@SenFeinstein Ok, so do you have some kind of solution to visa overstays? Are you saying that a border wall was an attempt to prevent visa overstays? A border wall is a partial solution to a totally separate problem in the immigration picture.
@SenTinaSmith Yup. Would be nice if you would hold a vote to bypass the President's veto (but you can't be bipartisan enough to do so) or compromised rather than play the blame game because you can't write a spending bill that will get past the President.
@louis2nd @toots717 @SenFeinstein And actually it was 2008-2010 when Obama passed the ACA
@louis2nd @toots717 @SenFeinstein Hey Lou, I agree that's true, but I also know that without 60 votes nothing can pass the Senate, so in fact Republicans haven't had the ability to pass any bill they want through Congress. That's correct, isn't it?
@SenatorLeahy I am happy that @realDonaldTrump is forcing you to address border security, and I still have not seen a Democrat besides @SenatorDurbin present an actual border security alternative. Scanners at ports of entry for cars are good ideas, what else is there? Beat Trump's argument.
@SenatorLeahy Well then why haven't you passed a bipartisan border security fix or immigration reform bill? If you have such bipartisan appropriation bills then bypass the veto, if you can't I suspect you have less bipartisan support than you suggest.
@louis2nd @toots717 @SenFeinstein I saw. However this is just an identification of the problem. I haven't read the bill, have you? What Democrats should do is talk about what they would like to change, how they plan to change it, and why they think their solution will work. Not hard to be better than Trump.
@louis2nd @toots717 @SenFeinstein Hi Lou, talking about this is how Democrats can win this conversation in the public with independents like me. However, identifying the problem and legislating solutions are two different things. A wall is a bona fide doable partial solution. Democrats can probably outdo it.
@louis2nd @toots717 @SenFeinstein Hi Lou, I never said Congress didn't allocate money for border security. However, I do believe that what they're currently doing is not working well enough and they should improve the strategy.
@JENNIWOWW @NaturallyWoww Your skin has nothing to do with it.
@toots717 @SenFeinstein I hope that's true, but I haven't seen it. I even have been watching floor debates which stream online for the House and the Senate and I don't see them discussing it with each other. I also haven't seen the base of The Democrats arguing for a plan they feel is better.
@toots717 @SenFeinstein They should be publicly arguing that their border security plan is superior to President Trump's and presenting the reasons why.
@toots717 @SenFeinstein I hope they have solutions but I disagree that they have in any way been presenting those solutions to the people. If you look at their social media accounts (of which I follow many) I solely see arguments that Trump is responsible for the shut down and Federal workers need help.
@toots717 @SenFeinstein Hi JT, I never said a wall would solve those problems. I think border security is an important issue that Democrats need to present solutions to rather than avoiding the issue by solely talking about Federal workers.
@SenFeinstein Still a lot of people. Additionally, we need to address drugs, visa overstays, weapons, etc. Let's do that now.
@JimMoorse1 @thedirtywop83 @amyklobuchar Hi Jim, why do you think Democrats think the current system is good? I thought polls show people are very dissatisfied with the government. Can you demonstrate any evidence that people believe the current system works well?
@senatemajldr not holding votes is cowardly
@JimMoorse1 @thedirtywop83 @amyklobuchar Hey Jim, I think people who are against voter id believe voter id is used to prevent black people from voting, rather than to prevent illegal immigrants from voting. Thanks to both of you for sharing your opinions. Hopefully you're able to learn from each other.
@thedirtywop83 @JimMoorse1 @amyklobuchar Hi, I do pay attention to quite a bit of media. Not just right wing sources! In fact much more left wing sources than anything.
@BettyMcCollum04 You are wasting your time with this bill and it's upsetting. Rather than speaking on the floor you should be negotiating your heart out and offering a compromise.
@realDonaldTrump Stay strong.
@chrislhayes I'm not sure a ton of illegal immigration is not actually an emergency.
@tribelaw Very interesting, can you elaborate on what you think the case would look like? Tweets like this are exactly why I follow you.
@AdamSerrano #congrats
@JoyAnnReid @senatemajldr It's important to ask whether the bill would also pass a veto. Is there enough support for these bills to overrule The President? If so, I'm all for The Congress flexing their muscle for once.
@brianklaas @Acosta Journalists have far bigger threats around the world, and the President's son has seen an embrace by the establishment of disgusting violent rhetoric towards his own father. Kathy Griffin's beheaded Trump, Madonna saying she's thought of bombing The White House. Be against both.
@amyklobuchar The Democrats' response to @realDonaldTrump raising #bordersecurity issues can not be "Federal workers must get paid," which is to totally avoid the topic. Independents like me want to know where you stand. This shutdown has been a major win for President Trump for me.
@amyklobuchar Then it's time to compromise. Start outlining your plan for border security and explain why your alternative to a wall is better.

@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Bipartisan funding legislation which can pass a veto is necessary or compromise. Small government Republicans win when the government is shut down, not big government Democrats.
@marcorubio I just watched your speech on the Senate floor. Thanks for giving such an impassioned talk about something you believe in. I think that order of priorities matter, and that passing a funding bill should be priority 1. Please pressure Leader McConnell to hold debate.

@CoachAaronBrice @KamalaHarris Ok. I don't think you're addressing my point directly, and I agree with you people don't think that.
@KamalaHarris I disagree, I think we need to instill in our people a respect for the law as it stood at the time they violated it. We shouldn't encourage a disrespect for the law.

@SenKamalaHarris Pressure @senatemajldr if it's bipartisan enough to get past the veto then you have your bill. I still have yet to see you post an alternative border security plan. I wish I could believe your alternative was smarter than a physical barrier, but I haven't seen your alternative.
@KenKulig @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @iamjohnoliver To be honest, I usually take it story by story.

I know no one advocating for a police state.
@SenBobCasey Senator Casey I think you should work out a veto proof measure that will over rule the President's veto in a bipartisan manner or you should discuss substantive ways in which you would like to approach border security.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I agree that you should hold a meeting with leaders from other countries to address the flow of migrants they're sending our way.
@RepBarbaraLee I respectfully disagree. I think far better to talk about goals both sides of the partisan divide have in common and to talk about legislation you would like to pass than to say the other side has hateful lunatics in it.

@realDonaldTrump please keep the shutdown going until Democrats bring into the public their border security alternatives, which have been extremely non specific.
@SenFeinstein That's still a lot of people who were apprehended. There are also drugs and guns moving that we don't catch. There is an illicit business of getting people across the border quietly. It funds criminal orgs. We should stop it. How are we going to do so? Are you saying we shouldn't

Anyone can write it, but only members of Congress can introduce legislation."
@Allidoisphillip @allidoisowen @realDonaldTrump As to the Fed and interest rates, I'm not sure why you think that's so unimportant to the economy...
@Allidoisphillip @allidoisowen @realDonaldTrump No Phillip, I'm sorry, that's not true, legislators author bills that are sent to the President, the President may use the bully pulpit to influence that process but the bills and regulations Congress passes and sends to the President are determined by Congress.

@KamalaHarris Still haven't seen you talk about your alternative for border security.
@SenatorDurbin Isn't this a way for you to avoid the issue of border security? The question I have is whether the border security package currently offered is or isn't sufficient, and why, not what happens during a shutdown. Congress took a risk by failing to pass the sufficient bill in time.
@KamalaHarris You're still not making your argument for what you think border security looks like. Why not?
@realDonaldTrump Hi President Trump. I didn't vote for you but you actually are my favorite President in my life. Obama was ok but he involved us in foreign wars, maybe illegally. I hope you feel better if you're feeling bad, but you're tough. Good luck and Merry Xmas.

@donutsuperfan @AndyRichter The only thing I've seen from my Senator is "people will lose paychecks over Xmas" as an argument supposedly relevant to the border security issue. That's not a focus on the issue. She needs to talk about her plan for border security.
@donutsuperfan @AndyRichter Yeah most definitely! Look, the message from Democrats has been "no wall" not "here's what's better than a wall." Border security is supposedly a bipartisan issue, unless Democrats really are for "open borders." So instead of saying "walls suck" say "here's what's better."

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse This doesn't seem like a good way to debate. Calling your opponent names isn't a sound strategy and makes you seem petty, a la @realDonaldTrump. At least be humorous. Also, if this is a fight over border security, why not talk about how your plans offer sufficient border security

@neauxluh @HillaryClinton Lol I'm pretty sure that wouldn't work.
@HillaryClinton Sen. Clinton you're best able to serve the American people by talking about solutions to these problems. Those are most likely bills in Congress. Please add pressure on bills you support to address this problem.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Senator please talk about the bill you're going to introduce or that you support to address this issue. Also, please use more facts in this debate and directly address your opponents arguments. Please highlight arguments you don't agree with and why.
@NAACP Guess I won't be getting birthday wishes :(
@CNN Stephen Miller's grandstanding over whether the President will veto the spending bills to get the border wall allows The President to negotiate over the airwaves when he should be negotiating with the members of Congress in person. Please stop giving coverage to speculation.
@JoeNBC I really disagree, show me the same poll but with the word "illegal" in front of immigration and watch the numbers change. @realDonaldTrump ran on the platform of letting people in legally. "big beautiful door" Republicans elected him on that.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Funnier tweet would be: "and for an equally ridiculous proposition I'm proposing a bill which will shut down the President's Twitter account."
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump This tweet is just meant to ridicule the President instead of meeting him in debate. If you find the tweet ridiculous and unworthy of debate you're better off not debating it. Your time is better spent introducing and supporting bills. Why not one that will shore up free speech?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Sen. Schumer please also give ground to your Republican colleagues and admit where the #ACA has room to improve. Talking about how only you hold the reasonable ground and anyone else is in bad faith is not a good starting point for debate. I'm sure healthcare can still improve.

@FoxNews Your National Enquirer story was boring. I didn't trust them in the first place. They were already known to be in President Trump's pocket. It maybe deserved 30 seconds confirming what was already known, not a panel.

@SenKamalaHarris This is your chance to talk about healthcare legislation you support or are writing, don't waste it by using it to gridlock Washington by screaming expletives at Republicans please - A constituent.
@SenSchumer I just wish your goal wasn't to talk crap on Republicans and instead to argue against their reasoning in good faith.
@NaggingNurse @brianschatz True, but Supreme Court ruled it Constitutional recently. Even if they quickly change their mind, best thing a SENATOR can do is legislate.
@PalmerReport But way to foster conversation? You really think I don't know what the Supreme Court is? Or you just want to make me seem dumb cuz your point doesn't make sense....
@PalmerReport You're upset because I'm saying a ruling that actually happened actually happened? I'm not saying I agree with it or that it's the correct ruling, but Obamacare actually was ruled unconstitutional. Just because the Supreme Court might overturn it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
@PalmerReport https://t.co/kOct7NorPi uhhh except the "stunt like ruling" was because the individual mandate was ruled unconstitutional the whole law is now unconstitutional. So a Federal judge did rule Obamacare unconstitutional, just like with the travel ban. An appeal doesn't change that.
@SenSchumer Just talk about healthcare bills you plan on introducing. That's your job. Your job isn't to criticize the other branches of government in lieu of providing legislative solutions.
@brianschatz Republicans want less government full stop, that doesn't mean reasonable legislation to improve healthcare won't pass both houses. If you're serious about Republicans you should quote some which have demonstrated your point and make them suffer the political embarrassment.
@brianschatz Isn't this an opportunity to talk about legislation that you plan to introduce in order to improve healthcare even though Obamacare will likely be ruled Constitutional (again)?

@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor And kudos to you for debating, thanks for your time. Sorry if anything I said came across as disrespectful, I just blow off steam while debating by trying to be funny.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Look, I think where I want to end this conversation is that we should both call our congressperson and tell them we both want secure borders in the most humane and efficient way. We both want legitimate refugees to be admitted as quickly as possible. We both want reform. Cheers
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor All of those people should be prosecuted and removed from their posts.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Fair point and I have never heard that covered. However, not every child will hold out its hands and scream mama and some proof should be required of parentage before we hand kids to people. What do you suggest instead? Slow movement is bad in government, quick dna tests are not.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok I grant you that it was used to justify the child separation policy 9ish months ago.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok fine, well then let's just agree that we should secure the border in the most humane, cost effective way possible. I think you're probably correct no one thinks this, but I would wager a wall is an effective solution for many parts of the border right now.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol right ok, so I guess some amount of sex trafficking is ok is your argument? I'm pretty sure you agree with what I said. I didn't say that is why we should build a wall (code for having a secure border btw), just one reason among many
@MollyJongFast Uh for no reason? The reason was to prevent their parents from coming here illegally, as a deterrent, if I remember correctly.
@rezaaslan Lol meanwhile also many liberals who like these posts "hateful rhetoric is awful and we should all stop using it." OMG SEND THE SHITSTAINS TO PRISON. Name calling is not a sign of intelligence.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Drugs and weapons, going both directions, are major problems too.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor And like I said, one incident is tragic and is one too many.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Can I just say that I literally go through every MSM video on Youtube most days and dislike most of them for their crappy editorializing and never once have I seen any of them talk about sex trafficking?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok and I'm not advocating for getting rid of that law, but I do think it's wrong that people who have no rightful claim to asylum stay here for 2 years and put down roots and begin families where their children are citizens, thus forcing us to drive them apart to follow the law.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Sounds great to me! I want the most effective border control. I don't need a wall where it won't help, nor would I support it. And I don't support petty spiteful votes.
@stengel But without the intent to commit it the felony is much less serious
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor I would like that law to be enforced.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor And if the quote doesn't exist, then I say to you, I believe it's far more likely we have a law which says "You can not cross the border illegally"
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok, which 90% do not meet.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Or are you arguing that we should keep things the way they are, and if so, specifically, why should we do that when we know people are crossing illegally without our knowledge and that humans, drugs and weapons are trafficked this way?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor What is your better solution, do you have one??
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok so say I accept you're right and that nothing is ever perfect. Do you have a solution that will be more effective than a physical barrier? What is so insane about something less than 1% of the military budget? Is the Great Wall of China inhumane?? Walls keep people out.
@SenTinaSmith @SenJeffMerkley @maziehirono @RepJudyChu @RepBetoORourke Hopefully you'll also be sharing your planned legislative response.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok so would it be difficult to prove your point? I'm just asking you to show me the direct quote which says that "you can come in the country illegally if XYZ and no one is allowed to even try to stop you" or something like that in our law. If it exists I'll call to enforce it.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor It's not a straw man, I'm genuinely asking. How do you want us to address the fact that it's possible to cross our border without our knowledge as a nation?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Yeah yeah, I'm a racist because I don't want child sex trafficking or drug trafficking to occur through a porous border and so I think a barrier at the border is a good idea and somehow that means I hate black people.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor What's yours? A porous border?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Sex crimes are vastly underreported. Anyway, even one incident is one too many! We're talking about protecting black and brown kids, who's the racist now?? My solution is to stop all people from crossing the border illegally, and funding and reforming the asylum process.
@tribelaw Not impeaching a criminal President cuts out the heart of Democracy and we haven't impeached criminal Presidents for quite some time now.
@tribelaw Yes they can and impeachment is the method by which they were supposed to have that shield removed.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor You definitely gave me a biased source which didn't show me the U.S. code I'm looking for. Where in the U.S. code does it say anyone can cross the border as long as they plan to apply for asylum?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Uhh you realize this is for refugees?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor / You label me as someone evil. Peace, think about your strategy because you haven't changed my mind and basically argued for an open border, with ICE enforcement later, and no consequences for drug and human trafficking. What is your solution for border security?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol whatever, so basically it's evil and racist to want the border laws as I understand them to be enforced. Instead of educating me by showing me the law you says exists or addressing my point about stopping child sex trafficking and drug trafficking (something we should stop) /
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol ok well I'm sorry I think you're wrong and I have no idea how to convince you if you really think that all parties are solely emblematic of the crazy fringes of their party.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Just show me the law then. I think it's possible it works another way. Maybe a holding facility that's under international law, idk.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Show me a law that says you can come in the country legally without permission if you're seeking asylum! I'm willing to admit I'm wrong! Can you prove you're right???
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor I'm defending reasonable debate, not labeling your opponent as evil just because you don't agree with them!
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor I'm not defending corruption! I'm defending following the laws, not breaking it! Racism is bad! I agree!
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor But I know that the argument is EVERYONE WHO DOESN"T AGREE WITH ME IS A RACIST REEEEEEEEE
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol no, that's not how it works. Big umbrella parties have crazy people in them, and just because they're there doesn't mean the whole party is corrupted by them.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor As I understand it, the law is you can't cross the border without permission. I would like that law to be enforced! Bring all the black and brown people you want in! 1 million people come in legally a year! Just come in legally!
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol do you think my goal is to pull the wool over your eyes so I can implement a racist agenda? So funny that you think someone out there is trying to fool you. It's fair to ask that laws be enforced or changed.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Look some people are racist in the GOP and I don't support separating kids from their families, which is totally separate from keeping people out of the country who have no right to be here. Simple question: If you have no right to be in this country is it wrong to be here?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Yeah yeah, everyone in the GOP is racist I get it.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Ok so you support ICE deportations.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Latin tweets, nice. Anyway, do you really not get my point? The goal is to stop people from coming here illegally, not prevent people from getting a better life. If someone comes here and stays and has no right to, that's still illegal and I think it should be.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Look like I said I don't know the law. Show me the law that says you can't stop people from crossing the border if they're seeking asylum and I'll say you're right, I'm not trying to twist anything.
@ontskate @IndyaMoore I'm sorry was the point that "murder is bad?" Because we all know.
@ontskate @IndyaMoore I know people want to murder black trans women. None of those people saw this tweet. Even if they did it wouldn't stop them. There aren't a lot of people out there advocating for murder. If they do exist, they aren't doing so with support, everyone thinks murder is bad.
@ontskate @IndyaMoore Do you really think that telling a murderer murder is bad stops them?
@ontskate @IndyaMoore Lol that was not my point. Do you really think tweets prevent murderers from murdering?
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor I'm totally cool with people applying for asylum, and I want those who are qualified to get in as quickly as possible, but those who don't qualify for it are ruining it for everyone else.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor If you're saying well "deport more people then!" I say ICE IS RACIST HOW DARE YOU SUPPORT THEM
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor By the way the goal isn't to stop asylum seekers, it's to stop those who are gaming the system and aren't qualified for asylum.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor If you're telling me the U.S.A. isn't following the law, they should have to follow the law. I'm consistent. Anyway, I care far more about preventing child trafficking and drug trafficking, which doesn't involve asylum claims. Barriers keep those people out.
@SniffitSnippets @mradamtaylor Lol right everyone who wants the laws to be followed is a RACIST.

@slpng_giants @FoxNews I really don't agree that Fox News demonstrates bigotry.
@mradamtaylor What is a better solution for border security than a physical barrier?
@mradamtaylor A physical barrier is definitely more likely to keep people out at a higher rate than no barrier, right?
@mradamtaylor I don't see why a wall wouldn't work. If people the moment they're in this country can apply for asylum and stay much longer, and that's expensive, why wouldn't we want to lower the cost by keeping those people out, many of whom are drug dealers and human traffickers?
@chrislhayes @jaketapper I wonder if you realize the level of incompetence that the members of Congress who come on your show to be political pundits are demonstrating. They should make your show with CSpan clips of them making arguments in Congress. Their job is to legislate.
@JuddApatow I get that you have strong political beliefs, but if you could replace the "hahah Trump is failing tweets" with "here's my insight on a movie" tweets I would enjoy following you more.
@chrislhayes You should want him too if you're referring to the President, since it's basically all MSNBC talks about these days, even though the world still exists and has problems and major developments. "TODAY, AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE IN THE RUSSIA PROBE AND TWEETS!!	"
@robreiner I don't find that surprising. Bush and Obama were arguably criminal but the majority of citizens didn't push for impeachment.
@krassenstein Sorry but if the intent to commit the crime wasn't there for the President then you won't convince his supporters that he's bad. It doesn't make sense for a new politician to have a full grasp of campaign finance laws especially if their lawyer is giving bad advice.
@maddow Calling the President stupid isn't a great way to seem unbiased.
@KamalaHarris You should talk about how you do support the idea of border security and what you'll offer in return. You're encouraging your supporters to support gridlock.

@tribelaw Lol pretty sure they would have assumed the President would have been impeached.
@TobySinbad @SusieusMaximus @evan_greer Also that's like saying criticizing art doesn't involve criticizing the artist. Lol it's just so obviously wrong that if you call what someone says stupid you're calling them stupid in that moment.
@TobySinbad @SusieusMaximus @evan_greer And actually what I'm saying is that I prioritize the action of saying something offensive with good intent over the action of censoring someone with good intent.
@TobySinbad @SusieusMaximus @evan_greer I'm sorry but the world doesn't have to change because someone has a disease. Trauma is a mental disorder. If someone has the flu they don't have the right to expect the world to stop and reorder itself so they can still go out to a comedy show. They get better, they rejoin.
@TobySinbad @evan_greer There are still laws.
@TobySinbad @evan_greer Also lol, rapists don't hear a comedian telling a rape joke and go "rape is ok"
@TobySinbad @evan_greer The point of a joke is to trivialize and mock. Rape jokes aren't equivalent to condoning rape, they're just meant to be funny. All topics are open to conversation including murder and genocide.
@TobySinbad @evan_greer No, if you can't handle hearing people expressing an idea that's a problem with you, not them. It's ok to take offense when someone is trying to hurt you, but jokes aren't meant to do that. Jokes make some people laugh, not all people, and you have to learn what misses to hit.
@SusieusMaximus @TobySinbad @evan_greer rape is better* 		anyway lol, thanks for the sarcasm, sure it convinces a lot of people?
@SusieusMaximus @TobySinbad @evan_greer Name calling won't get a response, my point was that OP is more focused on joke policing rape jokes that on rape in this tweet and that's bad prioritization, not that OP thinks rape is worse than those jokes. I'm appealing to OP knowing rape is worse.
@TobySinbad @evan_greer Anyway tuning out now, will continue to think joke policing sucks and that jokes aren't what's causing rape.
@TobySinbad @evan_greer No one said rapists were the intended audience but way to reframe my actual argument in a way that made it easier for you to dismiss?
@TobySinbad Dumb speech shouldn't be anyone's focus unless it comes from someone in power.
@TobySinbad Also, rape is wrong. Far more wrong than a bad joke. Jokes have the intention of making people happy. Rape has the intention of taking away someone's autonomy. They're way different and free speech is awesome and means people are going to say tasteless things with good intent.
@TobySinbad Yeah you missed the part where I asked for someone to try to convince me with arguments rather than formatting.
@SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein What does Yemen have to do with farms? Such crap to have those in one bill.

@evan_greer Also how does it make your point more intelligent to just repeat it over and over? It's like you're trying to be trendy instead of make a point.
@evan_greer Joke policing doesn't make sense to me. Just let people make crappy jokes if they want to, it's not even a big deal and policing jokes doesn't stop prison rape imo. I agree that prison rape sucks and that criminals should't be allowed to get away with crime in prison.
@StephenKing He also said that he would build the wall no matter what and that if we paid the costs up front that he would recoup the costs from Mexico later. So your tweet could have been more complete, but I get that you just want to hate Donald Trump instead of helping.

@allidoisowen Because we know that no substantive questions are likely to happen?
@seungminkim Why don't we just break it apart into pieces? I don't understand these broad based bills where congress people support 50% of it and then fight over the other 50%. Just pass the 100% of it you support in a new smaller bill.

@GalaxyPodcast @kbaxter11 Would definitely appreciate insight on the thought process behind setting friendlies up. Are we looking at marketing, dominating a team using our system, trying our system against a tough challenging system, establishing FO relationships for trades... Thanks for responding!
@GalaxyPodcast @kbaxter11 So that means it's probably not set right? Any idea whether they're considering going abroad to pull some Zlatan crowds and build the Galaxy brand? Or do you think we'll see a mostly local calendar like this year?

@allidoisowen Such civility
@MichaelSkolnik You think the answer to a slight towards journalism is to eliminate journalism from that venue??? I mean come on.
@MichaelSkolnik Lol no way. What they should do is meet together before the press briefing and figure out how to coordinate their questions to back the Press Secretary into corners. Instead they'll all ask variations of the same question on whichever hotbutton issue comes up.
@allidoisowen @Acosta @realDonaldTrump Lol nah
@JuddLegum What part of the President asking for the resignation of someone is his cabinet is a Constitutional crisis? I genuinely don't understand.
@StephenAtHome Are we? I'm not convinced this next choice is going to be awful.
@JoeNBC Nah, that's speculative.
@KamalaHarris It's not clear to me that that is what he'll actually do. Many of us want certain political ends without compromising our ethics to get them. Be civil
@Acosta Well honestly then be more civil and ask smarter questions. Plan your questions with the rest of the press corp.
@Acosta I believe it's true that they will never tolerate it, although it's totally clear that there was no foul intent or even placing of hands on your part. However, the thread gives other reasons for revoking your pass you did not address.
@ChrisMegerian @Acosta Does the White House have the solve power of granting and revoking press passes? If so, I see no problem in their choosing to only allow access to the reporters they can be civil with.
@ChrisMegerian @Acosta Well actually @PressSec gave multiple reasons for suspending the pass, others being that Acosta did not give his colleagues an opportunity to ask questions and that @CNN is proud of how their employee behaved. Acosta certainly held up the conference in a rude manner.
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris Let's also remember that as we assure ourselves that the law is followed, that @realDonaldTrump is within his rights to ask that Jeff Sessions resigns.
@allidoisowen Ah such civility
@chrislhayes @maddow Which Representatives and Senators said they wouldn't support the removal of Jeff Sessions?

@Lexialex Diversity in thought comes from quite a bit more than skin color.
@Lexialex Anyway, calling people ignorant online isn't a great way to get them to do what you want them to do, or very convincing. It just makes you seem mean and irrational. Have you tried to convince me of anything yet or just been upset at me for not agreeing with you completely?
@Lexialex Lol way to move the goal posts on that one. Feel free to admit that a huge multitude of my tweets relate to preventing sexual harassment and that you were wrong. Maybe that's a level of humility I shouldn't expect from you.
@LiaBoBia @Lexialex Which is a good thing. But I just think it seems kind of easy for a system like that to turn into a "cool kids club." It's not clear whether there are any checks on the system or not to prevent something like that. Look how quickly she assumed I supported sexual harassers.
@Lexialex Also, in case you thought I was defending people who abuse or sexually harass, I wasn't. I was concerned that your system has flaws in it which could lead to someone being labeled in a way they don't deserve, which is something we should all be against. Do you care about that?
@Lexialex Lol you seem nice. Did you happen to go through my timeline or no?
@Lexialex This just seems like McCarthyism to me. I guess it could work well and I don't think it has bad motivation, but systems like this are how people in Hollywood were originally blacklisted unfairly, no? Is that something you've considered?

@markrmeyer @Millie__Weaver Indeed I do have a point. It's to reflect your own lack of thought back at you!

Bad take

@samsmith Disgusting. Look into veganism
@LATimesTVLloyd To combat the phenomenon you're identifying we need to A. Stop promoting things with serious negative consequences (meat, drugs, and militaries are major ones) and start promoting skepticism, reason and education with the same popular fervor.
@LATimesTVLloyd IMHO people like to stick it to those they brand as evil and are willing to brand someone as evil with little thought. Their actions in order to "stick it to the man" are often poorly thought out and as bad as the "evil" they're resisting.
If you're not a vegan and say you care about global warming, please consider cutting animal products out of your life. Animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of methane emissions and environmental degradation. Methane is more harmful than C02. #IPCC #GlobalWarming
@AdamBandt If you care, you should promote veganism. It's the individual's greatest weapon towards making an impact on this issue other than voting.
@guardian If you care, you should promote veganism. The UN itself argues that it's one of the most feasible ways to combat climate change. To be anything other than vegan is pretty irresponsible at this point, considering the impact animal ag has on the environment and emissions.
@CarolineLucas Individuals who care about this issue can best do their part by eating vegan. It's a fact and also what the UN recommends. If you want to show you care about this issue you should look into and promote veganism.
@markdreyfusQCMP @ScottMorrisonMP Promote veganism, it's the best way to reduce emissions. Not eating vegan is very selfish at this point, until the trend away from global climate change is reversed it may as well be called evil.
@RobGMacfarlane It is an actual fact that eating at @McDonalds or most other restaurants is EVIL because it contributes SO MUCH towards global climate change. Grossly irresponsible businesses like them should be ashamed.
@RobGMacfarlane Promote veganism, that's literally the easiest and best prescription for individual action on this crucial issue.
@poniewozik Just talk to the vegans, we've been doing our part for years.
@Evan_McMullin I mean I get this is a leading question meant to take us away from that type of politics, but I do think a positive call that could come out of this is for strong anti-corruption measures. It's an issue with bipartisan support, I hope it leads to more prosecution.

@TuckerCarlson Steyn was very cynical about the left on your show. I don't believe that the left approves of propaganda style tactics if they're in the left's favor. They simply believe that hateful words are wrong enough to stifle. Hateful being a fluid definition.
@greta I also would like reporters to stand up for what's right even in the face of criminal prosecution, the exposure of the truth should occur even if there are legal consequences. Reporters must be brave.
@greta I completely agree, the idea of news organizations not being beacons of transparency is troubling, especially if they use anonymous sources.

@ExDemLatina @Data_Orbital @AZGOP @dougducey @dg4az @CoconinoDems Anyway if you have proof, I'm all ears. Does anyone who supports government programs automatically become socialist, or just if they're schools and hospitals? I take it supporting the military welfare state many people take advantage of isn't socialist simply because they kill?
@ExDemLatina @Data_Orbital @AZGOP @dougducey @dg4az @CoconinoDems I think he would deny that claim and that you have little evidence it's true. However, he does support public programs that seem well thought out. So he is for bigger government and not a racist libertarian anarchist state like the far right is. He is not a socialist.
@Data_Orbital @AZGOP @dougducey @dg4az I can say on behalf of @CoconinoDems  and myself that we're supporting @dg4az. Ducey seems ok, but not vocally anti Trump, and therefore not representative of me.

@AZGal4Freedom @WendyRogersAZ Wendy Rogers another weakness of yours is that your background and what you've done for this community is very unclear. At least @RepOHalleran has demonstrated some resume! Also, the way you launched your ad was patently dishonest. You are running a fearmongering campaign.

@WendyRogersAZ Anyone else notice how she used no actual quotes from @RepOHalleran? Show me any proof you have he is for open borders, amnesty or even impeaching the President. He is a former Republican and probably much more centrist than you give him credit for.
@WendyRogersAZ Politics of fear again! Where is your positive message? @RepOHalleran the only criticism I somewhat agree with is that you are not very vocal and should be moreso on the positions you have. Many of us in the majority now and in the one that elected you want to see you be bold!

@ryanberdan @JoeAlv @ClassySteveT @LAGalaxy @StubHubCenter It's not for the purpose of making them feel better but rather the purpose of the team being apolitical. I don't want there to be homophobia night, or guns night, or white people night in the more extreme places in the USA either. Make sense? I don't agree with homophobia.
@ClassySteveT @JoeAlv @LAGalaxy @StubHubCenter I don't think there's anything specific you can point to that's evidence I'm crazy...can you?
@ClassySteveT @JoeAlv @LAGalaxy @StubHubCenter Then why are you defending yourself? I didn't say you were a homophobe. There are homophobes who like the Galaxy I'm sure.
@JoeAlv @ClassySteveT @LAGalaxy @StubHubCenter I'm bi and I like the LA Galaxy a lot, but I wonder if this is too political for the team. Maybe Pride night should be sponsored by ACB or LARS so homophobes or Christians don't feel excluded from the team but still get the message.

@BeatsByDomingo @PetraPauline @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I don't understand how that answers my question, sorry. Remember I asked whether it makes North Korea's bargaining power higher if the American people don't believe in Pres. Trump, not if his staff believes in him. Did you really answer my question?

@Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump Did you hear that on John Oliver too? Funny segment for sure. 		Also, do you think that punishing corruption should be bipartisan?

@DrMcKuKu @kwilli1046 Did you reply directly to my question?
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Is it reasonable to assume that a large group of liberal lawyers are probably going to fight these cases? Or that if details come out supporting your claim that this is happening EVERY time without cause there will be public outrage?
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch I can't comment on these cases because I couldn't name even one specifically. I don't actually know specifics on any case where a child was separated from their family, and I don't even know where I can find statistics that keep track of how often things like that happen.
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Appearances are definitely shaped by framing. We agree on a lot of fundamentals. We shouldn't be cruel. We shouldn't separate families. We should keep track of children in our protective services.
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch The article says they denied having a blanket policy of separating children from their families, right?
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Oh ok, but are you sure that's the full stop context of the policy? I would like to read the policy if I can. Have you already? If you could let me know where I could find more info I would appreciate it. It seems like you quoted Sessions but from an interview?
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Otherwise, you might be arguing to keep children with traffickers so parents stay with their children. Tough trade off to request when people crossing the border may have means of escaping abuse and war not involving illegal action. I say secure border, while accepting refugees.
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Don't you think some traffickers come across the border without papers and try to claim asylum while bringing children they claim are theirs but aren't really? That's a policy framing that removes cruel intent to me, and certainly it's appropriate to take those kids away. Right?
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch I think it isn't clear that it's intentionally cruel. Some people see illegal immigration more as a pathway for bad actors than asylum seekers. It could be natural &amp; encourageable to make life more difficult for human traffickers or drug dealers. But I agree, cruelty is bad.
@USWeatherExpert @ChuziChips @timmaay @runzwithknives @KurtaAnn @EagleWheelBike @JamesMartinSJ So then did this become an agreement between two voters to both shrink the size of the military and lower the number of abortions? Because I can get on board with that! But I would really rather have very strong defense and no offense re military.
@davewoody12 @JeanDuma1 @t_casabianca @JamesMartinSJ @ldevilloutreys @OHFScratch Hmm it seems to me like both are complex situations and well meaning people can fall on both sides of each argument, don't you think? Children being separated at the border seems bad, but we write the laws. Must be some reason for the policy? To prevent human trafficking?
@DrMcKuKu @kwilli1046 It's a hotly debated fact, even so. That's a lot of confusion and hate that really makes it difficult for people to cross over the aisles or to see it from someone else's perspective, don't you think? I agree abortion should be avoided, but I don't know for sure it's murder...
@BobSumm42304678 @a_cluck @kwilli1046 Wow that's really interesting! I guess you know that U2 isn't from the USA though. 		Why do you think that Putin has all that information? Also, what would it look like if people in WASH weren't walking on eggshells re Putin?
@GTMGQ @ivansargent1 @ElizabetGood @kwilli1046 @capshawjw I think Christians argue over whether there will be a rapture or armageddon right? Don't some think Revelations was a prophecy regarding the Roman empire.
@KevinStafford5 @kwilli1046 So, I still don't understand why you think that. Here in the U.S. free speech is available to all, but it is widely disavowed when people use their freedom to be mean or hurtful. Do you think that means we generally want there to be mean and hurtful speech? See what I mean?
@wayjones @kwilli1046 Why is a morning after pill less wrong than an abortion?
@FrankSt32644819 @kwilli1046 I generally feel that teaching young people about religion is semi harmful to them, because children believe lies so easily. If you're a Christian, I wonder how you feel about young Muslim children being taught the Koran is true from a young age. Is it good or bad for them?
@zahadoom @kwilli1046 I don't think people see abortion as a positive as much as pro choice supporters see abortion as a right. Much like I have the right to use mean free speech, but shouldn't. Don't you think? It's very rare to see someone genuinely happy a baby or fetus died.
@KevinStafford5 @kwilli1046 Do you think that making something legal is the same thing as sanctioning it? I definitely don't, do you? #Irelandabortion
@Mark11591233 @kwilli1046 @S_Cooper0404 I would say that could be the case! Just guessing. But I also think most popes are political and that this has probably been a movement that has been influenced by a lot, including 30 years of domestic rallies in Ireland. #Irelandabortion

@lendmeflight @MMFlint That might be true, but it doesn't change the overall point. When someone gives you a contract and you agree to represent their company, it's perfectly normal to expect that while you are representing their company, you do as they ask. Maybe that's not right, but it's normal.

I suggest you do a poll to see how many people want employees to demonstrate on the job while those people are trying to make use of the employee's company. Do I want the cashiers to take a 5 minute moment of silence before handing me my change because of food insecurity? Maybe
@latimespolitics If you write about the NFL policy I hope you write about how COMPLETELY NORMAL it is to mandate an employee's political conduct. You can't wear pro-life or pro-choice buttons while working at Disneyland, can you?! Rarely are front facing employees allowed to.
@MMFlint You're wrong. It's totally NORMAL BUSINESS AS USUAL for a business to mandate what their employees can and can't do. Would you argue that a Disneyland character in costume should be allowed to wear pro-life buttons with fetuses on them? I would be surprised, like this tweet if so
@Sirfoodalot @sarahemclaugh I don't think President Trump's followers are the only reason the NFL is losing business. The idea that this is some government overreach is still ridiculous. However, of course his statements impact their business and I am interested in seeing their business metrics too.
@JarrettHill @NFL You left out animals. #leather
@LaFemme_Negrita @JarrettHill @NFL You're wrong.
@JarrettHill @NFL Scandal free is a foolish stance to take regarding President Barack Obama. See Edward Snowden, hiring Hillary Clinton as S.O.S., illegal droning, and his representations of the ACA. President Trump is not good, but this is an unwarranted race card again.
@JarrettHill I accuse you of playing the race card without cause. It's totally appropriate to control a person's image while they are contractually representing a brand. Do you think the mascots at Disneyland should have a right to wear a pro life button on their costume??
@JarrettHill It's good to protest unwarranted discrimination. The idea that the @NFL players are entitled to bring political debate to the field seems very wrong. Sports are generally meant to be escapism without artistic or political undertones. This policy is good for business.
@JarrettHill I didn't realize that when I'm working retail at Vons I should be allowed to tell every customer who checks out at my counter how to vote on abortion, homosexuality etc. Cool! Should make for a fun and friendly work environment. #sarcasm #notracist #goodbusiness
@sarahemclaugh I don't agree with your implication that those authoritarian countries bear a resemblance to the USA now, particularly because if that happened in those countries it would likely be due to government mandate, not good business sense. I think this is a poor thought experiment.
@SenFeinstein I don't think it's clear there's a lack of compassion. Felonies should come with consequences. That is still the apparent majority opinion. You should call for making our asylum process more efficient rather than being partisan. Why paint our fellow citizens as enemies?
@joelrubin Thanks for writing that article on the Mexican mafia in LA Jails. It's important that our jails are a place where criminality ceases rather than festers. I hope @LATpoliticsCA discusses the methods used by the jailed to foster criminality and the best ways to stop them
@SteveBradford I am a constituent and you are losing my favor by using the limited time you have to engage the public to A. express your own opinion rather than ask the opinion of your constituents and B. to comment on something as inane as the NFL. #politics #LA #NFL #publicrelations #vote
@LATkarenkaplan @AmericanCancer @CDCgov @theNCI @JournalCancer Thanks for the article! Generally I would appreciate more coverage of the factors influencing cancer beyond race and gender. What lifestyle choices influence cancer besides unhealthy eating and smoking? City of residence? #LATimes #Cancer #Reader
@RepMaxineWaters @JerryBrownGov @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SteveBradford @AsmAutumnBurke Please make clear to your staff and the public you do not support propping up the Kim regime in North Korea. Kim Jong Un and his regime should face legal scrutiny for their slave camps.
@latimespolitics Also, if the U.S. is prepared to prop up the Kim Regime, does that mean we won't support any kind of international criminal action against Kim Jong Un? Seems like an unpopular stance for a pres. who has already taken flack for supporting torture. #politics #usa
@latimespolitics What do we know about how current economic sanctions against NK are affecting the avg. resident of the country? How choked is the economy and what stands to improve quickly with increased NK and SK cooperation? #Politics #LATimes
@TracyKWilkinson What have the effects of the Iran deal been on the Iranian economy so far? Are average citizens seeing an improvement in quality of life traceable to the accord? Also, has there been a shift in Rouhani and Khamenei's dynamic? #Iran #LATimes @RepMaxineWaters
@BinghamDb Hope you express yourself prior to the upcoming match. Would be good to hear your thoughts on @SJEarthquakes and how you feel going into this match, especially if it will pump up the crowd. @LAGalaxy @LARiotSquad @AdamSerrano @kbaxter11  @latimessports #LAGalaxy #Rival

@OlaKamara another goal this season?!?! Nice!!
@BinghamDb Glad you had a shut out today. It's a chance to get comfortable. Enjoy! Keep up the hard work #LAGalaxy
@Emaboateng Crucial player as always. Way to go! #LAGalaxy
@nabihbulos @TamerELG @chrislhayes See this is what I want discussed in mainstream media.
@SteveBradford Maybe next you'll do something to partner with the people working to make our communities more healthy. Maybe a sports team or a farmer's market.
@SteveBradford Congrats on scoring community engagement points. Keep it up. #Politics
@RealOmarNavarro
@latimes @RepMaxineWaters @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @AsmAutumnBurke @SteveBradford I would like more discussion from you on out of state housing vouchers for homeless people. Sending homeless and funds seems like a lower cost long term solution vs. building housing.
@fidmart85 @Ibra_official
@Ibra_official You promised us trophies and your chance to deliver is coming up. The @opencup is already on, it's a ticket to @TheChampions, and it's the trophy we have the least of. I hope you're ready for June 6th.
@latimespolitics https://t.co/ZNq8hkqIE1 I'd like to hear more about this bipartisan legislation and hear how our local house members are likely to vote on it, as well as to see their statements on the bill. @RepMaxineWaters #LATimes #LATReaders
@LAGalaxy @Ba66io Enjoy that plant based cake!
@jaketapper Why are you highlighting things like typos? Don't you have real issues to cover like the election in Venezuela or the new government in Iraq? 		What about policy discussions like the cutting edge research on reducing gun violence or studies on gun violence from unis. abroad?
@RealOmarNavarro @guerrero_cpa I wish you weren't always so light on specifics. Twitter isn't a good venue for making thought out rational arguments for other candidates.
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMaxineWaters Who do you endorse for Governor and why? I bet @RepMaxineWaters won't answer. #CAGov
@caseytolan @latimes @sfchronicle @sacbee_news @mercnews @EastBayTimes @philwillon
@chrislhayes I just think you should let this go through the court first, rather than defaming someone's character even based on good speculation. Why waste time on speculation? Show me more real news. You could have told me who the new president of Iraq is.
@philwillon I would be pretty surprised to see high voter turnout for the primary. There's not much time for a John Cox endorsement to turn the apathy and defeatism I've seen among CA Republicans. Is a 1% increase in turnout major? Arguably. But there's not much time until he's eliminated.
@geniesaisquoi @RepMaxineWaters Who do you endorse for Governor and why?
@cwillott @ORContraCosta @RepMaxineWaters Who do you endorse in the California Governor's race?
@MattGourley @GavinNewsom has the best knee scarves though
@philwillon Thanks for the coverage of the Governor's race. Do you think this will have a major or minor impact on voter engagement in this year's Gubernatorial contest?
https://t.co/ppBH7hza3n @chrislhayes How do you know this isn't just an effort to be fiscally responsible w/ the PO by increasing their revenue?? The facts of this story took 20 seconds to convey. The speculation wastes time that could go to major stories, like Iraq and Venezuela
@LAGalaxyII Go get 'em!
@SteveBradford Please advise your staff you do not support $5,000,000,000 for less than 10,000 homes. Berkeley's way isn't best. Far more can be built. #California #Senate #RedTape #Politics #Governor

@RepMaxineWaters Representative Waters, I do not believe this tweet is worthy of the decorum of your office. I hope you impeach @realDonaldTrump based on real, provable, open evidence. All presidents, including OBAMA, CLINTON, and BUSH should be held to incredible scrutiny and prosecuted.
