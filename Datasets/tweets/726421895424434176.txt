@Kusselman @papabearnc @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings Kathleen, I was there, no collusion. Not one strand of evidence, read the FiSA memos. They only have the dossier and a reference to yahoo news. (Mind u they leaked the same info to yahoo) when Democrats see this they will say he is still guilty because they know it. #Delusional
@KarenLWms @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings I beg to differ as I did data analysis for the campaign and saw first hand what happened. The facts I laid out were not disproven. Comey lied on fox, said that the dossier was a minimal part when in fact it was the whole application. I read through over 100 pages of it myself.
@KarenLWms @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings Ummm...she bought the Russia dossier from Christopher steel then weaponized the justice department to spy on an American. The entire FISA application was an unverified dossier and they didnt tell the court DNC paid for it. Also, sold 1/4 of U.S. uranium to Russia...Uranium One.
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings All the evidence points to Clinton colluding, so yes please release. Then you can spin the narrative to a different subject. #munches #popcorn

@brooke1544 @JrLawrenceG @Orvieto2016 Hegimon countries have an affect on the rest of the world; that's my point
@JrLawrenceG @brooke1544 @Orvieto2016 I introduced gay marriage as a means of stating that the rest of the world follows what the u.s. does. I know...my brother is vice president of a small country; that's how they do things. The numbers you provided only account for legal abortions btw.
@brooke1544 @JrLawrenceG @Orvieto2016 Actually, american politics lead the way. So the net affect is global. I.e. Gay marriage, etc. Also regardless of the fact, your point does not touch base on the nucleus of my argument.
@Cerrito321 @Orvieto2016 She is actually conservative now....not previously...she has been on this path since she left. This is exactly why she left...the baby killing..
@kashleybell @Orvieto2016 Now your being childish and are putting words in my mouth. Your  response is that she lied....my original counter was that your article  does not discredit the thesis. [The actual issue which involves the quota argument] but whatever....good day
@kashleybell @Orvieto2016 I love it how people dish out insults instead of sources...lol...since you can't have a conversation like an adult....good day
@JrLawrenceG @Orvieto2016 That's worldwide, in America, your looking at 60 million, planned parenthood is responsible for 8.
@kashleybell @Orvieto2016 Just because you say so? I would love to believe you, but I have not found anything that collaborates what you say. Care to share if you have something?
@JrLawrenceG @Orvieto2016 I appreciate your input; however, we should not judge by what they say, instead, let's judge by what they do. Since roe v wade, 1.5 billion abortions worldwide. 8.2 million was planned parenthood. So far, 235k this year alone by them.
@kashleybell @Orvieto2016 I have read that before, it does not discredit the thesis.
@Orvieto2016 That was an interview, not just a youtube video.  There were multiple btw. There are also books on it. Fact of the matter is, that more money is made by killing babies, than bringing them to the world. (That is irrefutable) they run Planned Parenthood like a business...kill=money
@Orvieto2016 Looking at grammar won't make your argument any stronger.... hearing it from a person that ran planned parenthood, their goal is to kill babies because it makes more money....

@sistersofresis3 @JimSniffen @ashtonpittman @SpeakerRyan Um...he doubled national debt..
@ProudSkeptic @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump It was a combination, we also lost thousands of factories due to the gold standard NAFTA and I'm aware, I was at JPMORGAN at the time. Problem was that smaller banks did not have the capital to keep on deposit and compete,  that's why they all failed.
@ProudSkeptic @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump We got through Ww1, Ww2, etc. etc. and this has never happened. Many factors contributed to the economy, prime mortgage lending is ontop, NAFTA, etc. Combine that with the job killing regulations within Dodd Frank and you have a mess. The smaller banks could not compete and died
@ProudSkeptic @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Oh yea... you mean doubling the national debt...his stimulus package included giving everyone free money thinking people would PAY BILLS instead... shopping
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Oh yes, great reasoning...Obama never came close in his eight years and it's a year after he leaves, that a positive economy is due to his job killing regulations...good one...

@my98centsshort @nytimes There are only 2 conditions for maintaining security clearance when you retire from service. 1. You are actively involved in current government projects as a contractor. 2. Your advice is requested by your successors so new people can listen to you.
@my98centsshort @nytimes If you bothered to read through the IG report, they clearly had the objective to clear her prior to investigating her,

@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Their endgame is to increase the number of reps based on proportionality...specifically illegals. See even if they vote, it does not make a difference if they live in blue states. But when you expand the population count in those states, there the political scene changes
@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Democrats don't care if what they do hurts the country,  as long as it opposes @realDonaldTrump . That is why they will inevitably fail...
@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump They just need crap to stick to him because they don't have an agenda to run on. This is now why they are the ones saying they will "drain the swamp" LMAO!!ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Well it all came to bite her in the ass. All the studies show people were not enthusiastic about voting for her. Add the "guarantee" that she would win =then why vote. She also bought all the air time and we had no choice but to go digital. She screwed herself
@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You have the 1st Amendment until a Democrat doesn't agree with what your saying...then its obscene.
@James42Smooth @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I told the campaign he would win. Many thought my numbers were just wrong.

And to insult the electorate....you got what you deserved for screwing sanders... all my analysis pointed to him winning by a landslide.
@VinMerchant @danielstrauser @munson15fan @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I appreciate the candid dialogue. Allot of people just have hateful things to write. I see your point, there is logic there. However, I think the sheer magnitude of how extensive this cut is, will make America the top place to invest in the world. I think this offsets your logic.
@BusinessMODERN @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @GOP Gotcha, so 700B somehow equals an extra 10 trillion. (Just in his first term) Also, somehow your logic is that because of this,  "Trumpsters"....half the country know nothing...lol
@Voteforthefrig @munson15fan @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Sir, I compared the economy when he got it and when he left it.

@VinMerchant @danielstrauser @munson15fan @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Checking accounts. High rates is a tremendous sign of economic growth. I need to follow the Fed with extreme scrutiny in order to do my job.
@VinMerchant @danielstrauser @munson15fan @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump They lower revenue and when done to this extent, will lead to massive reinvestment which in turn actually increase revenue.

@cvillegirl @PrairyFyre @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Do the math please. Obama increased national debt 100% in the first 4 years alone. This would mean at least 20 percent increase for Trump in year one...this is false.

@pythagoreanism @Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump The poor do not create jobs sir
@Gerrianne1948 @trh @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump Obama DOUBLED the national debt. His regulations killed job growth and the economy. Amongst the many Dodd Frank, given that smaller banks could not compete. This is why we lost over 2000 banks.
@Gerrianne1948 @pythagoreanism @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump Madam all you have seen is a partial tax bill, the finished product is substantially more generous
@DeficitOwls @pythagoreanism @Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump It's not that simple, if your a business owner, you need the help, but you dont have enough, your not going to hire, your going to try to keep the shareholders happy which entails keeping administrative costs down. If u have the $, u will expand, there we find job growth
@Gerrianne1948 @trh @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump Madam, every comment I have written is accurate, I myself have benefitted from the tax cuts and your response basically states "no it's not", since we can't have a conversation like adults, good day.
@Civildebate2017 @Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump My point's exactly
@trh @Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump Hate to break it to you, but Obama doubled the national debt. He basically accumulated debt in 8 years that every other president occumilated in 200 years. Also, those numbers are false because it does not take into account new investment which is the entire point to the tax cuts
@pythagoreanism @Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump Sir, companies are coming back, the concept of a Christmas bonus has been reintroduced (it was long dead in America, I know from experience) the working class has standard deduction x2, the child care credit x2, whom does this benefit the average you and I..

We are heading back to the America where people can live from interest. This is part of the massive result of deregulation. Regulation is what kills the middle class
@Gerrianne1948 @Johnvalentino43 @realDonaldTrump That was phase 1 of tax cuts...more to come...also why not make America the place to invest in the world? the place where there is substantial job growth?

@dreamloverepeat @realDonaldTrump Nicole, Comey implied it in his tweet.
@Jeannine8Carol @spreadkindnez @GOP I'm merely stating that hospitals charge an obscene amount of money to insurance companies. Even for a mere bed [not including meds or tratment] they bill thousands of dollars. This trickles down to you and I whom pay the monthly fee to be covered amongst other things
