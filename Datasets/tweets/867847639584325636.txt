@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas Anyway, thanks for engaging. Appreciate your point of view.
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas Maybe add other mechanisms less harmful than shutdowns to push lawmakers to act.
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas And that‚Äôs ok, Democracy is messy. But IMO we shouldn‚Äôt be shy a about fixing it. Most solutions have drawbacks/trade offs. So let‚Äôs discuss how to address them. Maybe time limit it so there is no risk of appropriations falling by the wayside for many years.
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas True. Heading into a meeting so I‚Äôll try to explain where I was going quickly. I suspect we wouldn‚Äôt design the process we have now if neutral parties were given full information to design the smartest process. It‚Äôs far from perfect.
@TheJoshCaplan And yet, with auto CR in place there would have been no shutdown. I‚Äôm pretty sure lawmakers would still be working to fund their priories.
@TheJoshCaplan I agree there is a major politics problem. But I think our current process has failed over time and under many political conditions and combinations of power. It could be improved.		Yes, treat the underlying disease. But until that‚Äôs cured do what you can do reduce the harm.
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas To your point about authorization, would you support shutting down unauthorized programs until they are reauthorized?
@TheJoshCaplan I‚Äôm curious if there is any real world experience or data supporting the idea that normal approps would stop. Seems like a lot of priorities to fund every year. Recent spending deals have had large bipartisan margins.
@TheJoshCaplan On the politics, there was wide agreement on all bills but homeland. Yet we still had a the longest shutdown in history. Do we want a system where a handful of actors can shutdown the government?
@TheJoshCaplan Do you agree an auto CR would end shutdowns? Seems like there is a process fix. It just comes with drawbacks that you don‚Äôt think are worth it?
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas Recent spending deals have passed with large margins in both chambers. I‚Äôm not sure we have good reason to believe this will half just because of an auto CR. /end
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas Probability of damaging events is legit to ask. Same Q could be asked about lawmakers halting annual appropriations (seems like the chief objection). Do we have any evidence/experience to suggest this would happen? Lawmakers have priorities to fund every year. 5/
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas I‚Äôm not saying an auto CR is a perfect solution in isolation. But it seems like it would signal an end to shutdowns and many objections I‚Äôve seen could be addressed. 4/
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas After the experience of this shutdown contractors and employees may ask for higher compensation for the same workload/talent/experience level because of the risk of future shutdowns. That delta is waste. 3/
@mccanned @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein @MayaMacGuineas But it doesn‚Äôt take a shutdown for the possibility of one to produce waste/inefficiency. Every time we approach expiring appropriations federal agencies, contractors, employees, etc.. have to plan for a potential shutdown. 2/

@mjves To your point about peoples‚Äô voice. People don‚Äôt like shutdowns.
@mjves An auto CR is just a change in default from the current auto shutdown.		Imagine auto CR were the status quo and you were concerned that Congress was not active enough in appropriating. Would you suggest we change the default to a shutdown?
@mjves I‚Äôm not sure I understand the comparison of BCA caps to an auto CR. The BCA caps are more analogous to a shutdown. If Congress fails to act, we have a result we don‚Äôt like. The default is damaging to the causes you names above.

@mjves I‚Äôd be interested to know if there is a state/country that has tried it and found it to be a disaster. I think it is possible for lawmakers to design one that is better than the status quo.
Ever see a House build a wall and lift a ceiling at the same time? https://t.co/yC2ciUr01i
@KellyNFP @BBKogan @WilliamGale2 Thank you @kellyNFP! I suspect there is a lot of political will to do something to reduce the liklihood of or eliminate shutdowns and I would be glad if lawmakers passed something that is better than the status quo.
@BBKogan @WilliamGale2 @mettlinger I wouldn't sunset the code every year (an extenders nightmare!), but I would do more to put the tax expenditures that have similar goals/effects to spending programs in competition with them during the budget process. Lots in education and health care, for example.
@WilliamGale2 That's what I was going to say! (I said it to several people earlier today, I promise).
@BBKogan @WilliamGale2 71 votes in the Senate for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. I find it hard to believe Ds coudn't find votes for increases with unified control.		Re: autopilot issue - I think you could add other mechanisms that would help motivate lawmakers.		https://t.co/mGtNS2QzHB
@BBKogan @WilliamGale2 Thanks, I recognize and understand your concerns. I think smart people could get together and design something that's an improvement on the status quo and balances the benefits of avoiding shutdowns with the risks of discretionary autopilot.
@BBKogan For example, the Warner bill uses a GDP% increase if no appropriations bill were if funding was there but no approps bill passed for a program in the previous fiscal year. Feel free to DM me if that's better.
@BBKogan Hey @BBKogan - Your point about automatic and compounding real cuts is well taken. Is there a version of an auto CR that would have the benefits of avoiding shutdowns while not having the issue you identify here?
@BudgetBen They already skip the approps process on a regular basis for extended periods. Avg of 5 CRs per year in the last 20 years. Lots of waste just planning for potential shutdowns as each deadline approaches + actual shutdowns.
@ShaiAkabas That‚Äôs true, but I think behavioral economists would tell us to set smart defaults. Short-term CR not ideal but much preferable to extended shutdown.

@Brian_Riedl In fact this is similar to a common argument from folks debunking claims from the left that ‚Äúwe were fine we high marginal tax rates mid-20th century.‚Äù The retort is ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt really that high because of deductions/loopholes.‚Äù Can‚Äôt have it both ways. /over
@Brian_Riedl If you know you have enough deductions/loopholes, you wouldn‚Äôt have actually been experiencing the 70% marginal rate. Mom takes $7 and hands you back $3 (or more depending on what we‚Äôre counting). You know you‚Äôre getting $3 back. Disingenuous to ignore this. 3/
@Brian_Riedl Back of envelope of course. At 7m Even if 0 tax rate below 255k, actual experience of paying 70% above would result in effective tax rate of 67%. Not precisely the marginal dollar but good evidence that few rich would have ever worried about actually paying much at 70% rate 2/
@Brian_Riedl I‚Äôm talking about the marginal dollar. Top .01% avg income of ~7m (using 2005 dollars per CBO doc above), minimum of 1.8m. 70% kicked in at 255k (moved to 2005 $). Total effective income tax rate ~21%, all taxes ~40%. 1/
@Brian_Riedl The pre-Reagan point doesn‚Äôt make sense either. 70% kicked in around 108k. The effective tax rate for the top .01% (presumably almost all income above 108k) was around 40%. Knowledge of deductions/loopholes means few actually faced 70% rate.		https://t.co/PxFYsPvdb4
@Brian_Riedl @mauldin006 And anyone who is unaware of their marginal tax rate until it is collected.. is also likely low income.
@Brian_Riedl @mauldin006 And anyone regardless of age who accepts $10 for household labor is relatively low income.
@Brian_Riedl @mauldin006 The assumption is in the description. The annual income for a child doing chores is low. Ask 100 reasonable observers that Q and 100 would agree.
@Brian_Riedl @mauldin006 Has anyone argued for a 70% rate for the low income?? It‚Äôs a total straw man.

@paulwinfree @kasie Final Senate tax law vote - https://t.co/nWH7ckGM5a
@paulwinfree .@kasie - @paulwinfree is right, although I would clarify that the tax bill could not include a statutory PAYGO waiver because it would have opened up the bill to a 60-vote point of order. Senate GOP only had (and only needed because of reconciliation) 51 votes to pass tax law.

@MarcGoldwein @econwonk @StevenTDennis Agree. And agree on subsidies mostly. But there is a long history of meaningful gov and gov supported R&amp;D. Even w/a carbon tax it could make sense. For example, consider a public hybrid tech breakthrough available to all carmakers vs. a private patented one. Time is short.
@MarcGoldwein @econwonk @StevenTDennis When you have such a substantial pro-car policy structure/history/culture, you can‚Äôt really ignore that when handing out R&amp;D $ or designing incentives to address climate change.
@MarcGoldwein @econwonk @StevenTDennis Generally agree w/you on neutrality in a theoretical sense. But insisting on neutrality in a policy area that is a tiny slice of much more impactful policy choices is like doing calorie counts for only your afternoon snack. Makes no diff if you ignore 3 main meals.
@MarcGoldwein @econwonk @StevenTDennis Think about writing the non R&amp;D changes to federal/state/local laws/regs to attempt to make gov neutral. Tariffs, land use/zoning &amp; neighborhood/urban design, direct tax credits, indirect tax credits (manufacturing, parking, etc..), infrastructure.. Not sure it is worth trying.
@MarcGoldwein @econwonk @StevenTDennis Thinking about what it would mean for gov to attempt to be 100% tech neutral. Does it make sense to ask for this standard in one policy arena and not others? Think about the hybrid cars vs. bikes example. 1/2

@GideonResnick What does that mean? You need 218 to pass a bill and 218 to pass the rule that would waive PAYGO. Presumably if there are 218 to pass a deficit increasing version of Medicare for All there are 218 for the rule. How does a commitment to waive it change this math?

@RyanLEllis @Brian_Riedl @lenburman @brendanmdunn @StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein The same principle applies at any tax or spending level. Taxpayers should pay for the size of gov they want. This is especially true when spending is mostly consumption. As @lenburman pointed out, decoupling tax levels from spending levels causes people to want ‚¨ÜÔ∏è spending.
@lenburman @Brian_Riedl @brendanmdunn @StevenTDennis @RyanLEllis @MarcGoldwein It is not ‚Äúa lot to ask of taxpayers‚Äù to ask them to pay for the spending that is going out the door. As long as baseline spending &gt; baseline revenue than we shouldn‚Äôt be cutting taxes. If people want lower taxes they should demand lower spending, not give their kids the bill.
@MarcGoldwein Maybe an inefficient source of revenue in isolation but an efficient policy choice as it brings in some revenue, addresses multiple externalities, and can replace either debt or taxes on things we want more of, like income.

@BudgetBen @Brian_Riedl Again, not endorsing, but health savings and revenue are fungible. In theory the smartest health savings can pay for coverage expansion now and reap net deficit reduction over the long term as savings compound.
@Brian_Riedl @BudgetBen Also, for @BudgetBen‚Äôs standard, Ds not need refuse health care savings, only insist that those be used for coverage/benefit expansion and not deficit reduction until TCJA is repealed. (Not endorsing, explaining)
@Brian_Riedl @BudgetBen Deficits are not ‚Äúcaused‚Äù by taxes or spending. It‚Äôs the gap. Historical averages for revenue and spending are just that, historical. Look at the revealed preference for high spending from both parties.
@kpomerleau I agree that if someone says they will repeal TCJA we should take them at their word until we have reason to believe differently. What I was trying to suggest was that there will be legislative efforts labeled TCJA repeal that will not be plain repeal.
@kpomerleau I think so, The House passed full repeal on 1/19/11. But I'm not sure what the point of pointing that out is. Politicians often say things that are less than true. It is true about ACA and TCJA.
@kpomerleau Do you mean include repeal in their budget resolution but only count the parts of repeal that are convenient for making the numbers add up?
RT @RyanLEllis: @JimPethokoukis all about pre-tax cut revenue baseline vs. post-tax cut revenue baseline.

Thus, the @RulesReps set up a rule with self-executing amendments for each bill that exclude the costs from the #PAYGO scorecard. W/o these waivers, if these bills were signed into law, there would automatic spending cuts at the end of the year to offset the costs. 2/7

@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Enjoy! Grocery time for me. Pleasureü§∫ budget w/you.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen We‚Äôve done approps bills on time 4 times in 40+ years. Avg. of 5 CRs in the last twenty.		Our entire constitutional system is supposed to peacefully resolve intense disagreements. If everyone agreed precisely all the time we wouldn‚Äôt even need gov.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Also ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt agree‚Äù is not a fair answer as it leaves time and content detail. It can be said about any difficult policy problem. Doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt work on solutions.		I will give you that disagreement on tough issues is a higher order problem than process.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen I hear you, it seems now you are arguing on the difficulty of finding an agreeable solution to the process problem. I was taking issue with your statement ‚Äúprocess is not the problem, R tax cuts are.‚Äù Clearly we have process problems aside from tax cuts.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen But now we agree there is a process problem.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Right, let‚Äôs not have a silly system. CRs   have negative consequences. A system that is designed to fail early on can ultimately succeed but what not have a better system? A car with faulty breaks can get you to your destination but why not fix it?
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Right, and meanwhile the pizza place has bought the cheese, dough, started to assemble, etc.. Called the delivery driver to get ready. But WAIT!!! 41 don‚Äôt like that place and threaten not to pay if they show up. Scrap the üçï, start over. It‚Äôs wasteful.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen See my pizza example. When you set up a negotiation process with early rounds that exclude individuals or groups with veto power the process will gridlock and/or take longer more often. No one would design the process we have.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Get 101 people together to order pizza. Set 1 aside. Set a 51 vote threshold to pick the place and # number of pies. Set a 60 vote plus signature of the 1 to pick toppings and pay once pizza arrives. Isn‚Äôt that obviously set up to exacerbate consequences of conflict?
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen We routinely have bills passing with large bipartisan majorities. Clearly we can agree. But even if agreement is possible there are systems that can stretch it out and systems that can smooth it.		FYI not arguing for 51 vote approps, pointing to gap.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen I cannot remember reading or hearing an argument that addresses why the old process ought to work given these new realities. Even if the fiscal outlook where much better we‚Äôd still have components that make effective governing harder than it needs to be.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Lots of folks make the argument that the process used to work. But we didn‚Äôt have a 60 vote Senate, increased frequency of chamber flipping, and parties more neatly sorted by ideology.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen What have a debt limit completely separated from the tax and spending decisions that change it?
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Why 51 votes for BR that is supposed to set topline levels but 60 + POTUS for actually doing appropriations? It‚Äôs an clear recipe for gridlock.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen For example, why are we in session 3 of the last 8 weeks of the fiscal year? This is the equivalent of planning vacation (or a far off job) to happen during finals week every year.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Still many problems with the budget process. Deadlines hardly ever met, too many CRs, etc.. ultimately politicians make decisions but there are some obvious flaws and deadlines aren‚Äôt met under any combination of power.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen But set that aside for a moment. Let‚Äôs pretend the Bush tax cuts never happened and we have a more sustainable outlook.
@BBKogan @JtRametta @BudgetBen Process can‚Äôt replace political, but we could make improvements to make sustainable long-term fiscal policy making more likely.
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis Agree it is largely theoretical but still a useful framework. Whether we can easily list them out or not we have a collective list of public policy priorities expressed in the budget (and rules). Even w/incomplete/imperfect information we can fill in the holes through politics.
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis But this is politically almost impossible as it is too hard to explain.
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis Can also take it a lot further and attempt to compare vastly different policy areas by quantifynig all effects in $$ and focusing on best cost/benefit up to the point where the diminishing marginal return matches the next tool and keep gonig down the list..
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis Sounds like we're agreeing. Ideally you have a matrix of goals within a broad area (like higher ed) and policy tools with an efficiency ranking $1 of each tool toward each goal. Rank goals, rank tools, consider complexity/administration, and make policy.
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis For example, if lawmakers want X quantity of positive externality support and Y of redistribution, a lot of these are going to get you some of both. Even if individual justifications, they end up serving multiple shared goals/effects.
@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis Your point is well taken but they are not silos. Nearly all have significant overlapping impacts whether it is the primary intent or not. Here is a good paper on portfolio budgeting using higher ed as an example - https://t.co/T3wvIoBxXb

@paulwinfree Challenging to have opening offers, negotiate a budget deal, then do approps in one year. This is where ideas like moving the fiscal year and biennial (know how you feel) look like complementary pieces that help create space for more thoughtful process.
@paulwinfree Gets complicated w/timing of POTUS budget. But maybe we could have a much smaller POTUS budget focused on fiscal goals earlier in the year w/o all the programmatic detail (could still come later).
@paulwinfree Doesn‚Äôt make sense to have appropriators do all that work and then change the level at the end. Also obscures how spending choices are connected to fiscal situation.
@paulwinfree I think we agree, theater is important for lawmakers &amp; BR can be opening offer. Makes sense to negotiate the overall budget on the front end before starting approps to facilitate trade offs in discretionary, mandatory, &amp; revenue &amp; look at fiscal picture. Hard to do, but shld try.
@paulwinfree Need POTUS (or 2/3 in both chambers) for approps bills, caps or no caps.
@paulwinfree We put these out as a menu for lawmakers to think about, but many make more sense when combined.		This one makes sense with making budget a law. Chambers do their budget, POTUS stakes out position, then negotiate and sign the final product into law. Can be a backup process also. https://t.co/xYPmUY9Rc7
@paulwinfree The current budget resolution has become meaningless in terms of the fiscal goal it sets out. Real budgeting is done in these two-year laws. Makes sense to ask lawmakers to consider the big picture when changing caps. Can keep resolutions to let parties lay out their plans.
@paulwinfree To your point about reasonable expectations of lawmakers - It‚Äôs not too much to ask them to do a comprehensive budget that is at least somewhat binding. Lots of countries and states do it.
@paulwinfree Agree baseline is not perfect. We have some ideas to fix it - https://t.co/dIB1BzfzA9
@paulwinfree I think 60 is the new reality and changing that is much bigger than budget process. Point is the threshold for topline and approps should be the same.
@paulwinfree They have voted on toplines before approps bills in the three two-year cap deals. You could argue members had some window into omnibuses in year 1 because of approps work already done. But year 2 is blind.
@paulwinfree Agree they should not avoid doing a budget this year: #wheresthebudget		I was getting at public pressure more so than internal caucus pressure.
@paulwinfree Yes but this would also include 302(a).
@paulwinfree Shorter: If you need POTUS and 60 in Senate to pass approps, you need them for 302(a) sooner or later. Sooner makes sense.
@paulwinfree @BudgetHawks There can be a second choice process if negotiations yield nothing by date X. 		Should try to get agreement on approps topline from all w/veto power before starting approps. If not, POTUS or Senate minority will hold up approps bills until they like topline.
@paulwinfree This is a fair point. However, I think there is something to be said for the ‚Äúdo your job‚Äù pressure of being on the budget committee. Putting leadership there places extra accountability on them when there is no budget. Should be paired w/others that elevate budget relevance.
@paulwinfree Gen com #3 - There can be significant interaction effects, both affecting the process and in getting the political coalition for reform.
@paulwinfree Gen com #2 cont‚Äôd - Therefore it makes sense to put forward a variety of ideas so lawmaker factions can sort through the combination that can get broad consensus for passage, even if they disagree about what it will do.
@paulwinfree General comment #2 - Major budget process reforms have typically passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Often different factions believe the changes will lead to results beneficial to them. Consensus for reform, but not its impacts.

@paulwinfree General comment - There are many things that Congress can already do do that it is nonetheless appropriate to ask lawmakers to do. One way to do so is to ask for process changes as commitment devices. Doesn‚Äôt have to be ironclad to be worthwhile.
@paulwinfree @BudgetHawks Thank you @paulwinfree for taking the time to give your thoughts on these BP reform ideas. I will give a general comment or two and then try to respond to your comments individually where it makes sense.
@paulwinfree Keep going! I will wait to respond.
@BudgetBen Items to help look at LT certainly could and should be there. But if that's not possible there is still a lot to be done to address the other problems (see link) above that would be worthwhile.
@BudgetBen @paulwinfree I don‚Äôt think the BB=&gt;better long-term fiscal situation claim was made in this thread. Long-term debt is a major problem that I focus on but I also believe in a better budget process to address many other problems. https://t.co/DHwabZq0Mm
@BudgetBen @paulwinfree The criteria should be whether it is likely to be a marginally better system. The one we have is so clearly broken it is worth trying a new approach. Not a magic bullet. We should also attempt to fix political system issues, but a different question.
@paulwinfree There‚Äôs nothing holy about the current budget process. It‚Äôs an arbitrary system designed by lawmakers decades ago. Hard to believe anything designed in 1974 couldn‚Äôt be improved upon in 2018. The world is quite different.
@paulwinfree But I think it‚Äôs not inconsistent to recognize that larger and more complex political issues are a more significant cause of budget problems than the process while still believing we can make the process better than it is.
@paulwinfree If one believes that budget process changes will have no impact, then of course biennial budgeting will have no impact.
@paulwinfree I think the idea that budget process changes alone will certainly cause regular/responsible budgeting is a straw man that takes away from the more nuanced discussion of making improvements at the margin.
@paulwinfree Bottom line is members know budget resolutions have become irrelevant to achieving the goals they set out. They do a major budget law every two years. Might as well make that the budget. This would not preclude parties/chambers putting forward their own budgets more often.
@paulwinfree I think my answer to this is that the frequency of a deadline matters less than what is required by the deadline and how it is enforced. If biennial helps get members on board w/additional reforms it could help. If frequency drives action, why not budget every quarter?
@paulwinfree For those following along, here are some of @BudgetHawks ideas to strengthen the budget resolution - https://t.co/9Ia42c5OEF		Here is our broader list of reform ideas - https://t.co/KcT4yBLwxX
@paulwinfree Elections are ultimately the deadlines and we almost never see lawmakers pass two budgets between elections. Recognizing this reality and designing a smarter process around it could help. But it‚Äôs not a silver bullet &amp; ultimately no process reform can solve political conflict. 4/
@paulwinfree However they have shown the ability to pass major budget legislation every two years. Combined w/other reforms that would make the budget more meaningful, moving to a two-year cycle could help push toward more consistent &amp; thoughtful budgeting than we currently do. 3/
@paulwinfree Congress could rewrite the process so that they do a new budget every month. But they wouldn‚Äôt follow it.		Under the current process Congress occasionally passes a budget &amp; then immediately starts working on legislation moving away from the purported fiscal goal. 2/
@paulwinfree You are certainly correct that moving to a two-year cycle formally will not solve political disagreements. My point is that scheduled frequency of budgeting does not correlate with meaningful budgeting. 1/

@BudgetBen And of course it also misses any future technical corrections bill.
Including interest that spending boost would cost $1.9 trillion, similar to the tax bill. Except if the tax bill were extended, there would be an additional $650 billion in costs. Same order of magnitude for sure, but tax bill significantly larger under current policy.
.@SenWhitehouse says we need to bring all levers that increase debt into the federal budgeting process as part of reform, including mandatory spending and tax expenditures.

@MattVallone Ah, a debate worth having for sure. I think balance of power between leadership vs. rank and file, committee structure, etc.. are changes that might be on a different level of difficulty than budget process, though related.
@MattVallone Expirations of previous two-year deals and timing of fiscal year work against this as well. We are in a pattern and it would be worth a shot to "reset" and try to structure in a smarter way.
@MattVallone It could, but current process does not help. Why not have a process that facilitates it instead of working against it? For example, deadlines and content/structure of POTUS and congressional budgets aren't designed for this.
@MattVallone Why not at least try to get 60 in Senate, 218 in House, and POTUS to agree on topline (or preferably a fiscal goal) BEFORE approps season starts? Can have a fallback, but current system was not designed for 60 threshold in Senate and makes little sense with it.
@MattVallone To drill down on one example, it's a best budgeting/negotiation best practice to get all players with veto power talking at the beginning. Surely leadership doesn't prefer to negotiate 302(a)s after doing an entire approps season with a # everyone knows is not final. 1/2
@MattVallone We've had essentially the same process for more than 40 years. On time completion less than 10%. More than 100 CRs in the past 20 years. Not to mention policy outcomes. Asking for reform shouldn't be an excuse/distraction, but the range of changes worth trying is large.
@MattVallone It is a tough issue no doubt. Leadership is powerful, but not all-powerful and over time has incentives for a smoother process. Policy outcomes is a case by case basis of course. Repeated CRs, omnis, shutdowns, etc.. isn't good for the majority.
@MattVallone Lawmakers are humans just like the rest of us and decision architecture matters even if we retain the ultimate power to choose.  /end
@MattVallone Political actors will decide policy at the end of the day. Just like we all choose what to eat and how much to excercise. If you want to lose weight and yet you have a recurring delivery of fresh donuts every morning, maybe cancel it? Switch it to every other day. DO SOMETHING.
@MattVallone Lawmakers ought to go big and build a new process that makes sense and pushes toward more responsible fiscal outcomes. At a minimum they could make changes so that process doesn‚Äôt make success difficult. Here are a few ideas - https://t.co/KcT4yBLwxX
@MattVallone Vote-a-rama is hated by many lawmakers and staff and an impediment to doing budget resolution. Why not limit it? Require amendments to be submitted two days in advance so they can be read/understood?
@MattVallone In part because the budget resolution is too weak, it has become a joke to many lawmakers. It allows them to say they support X goal and then vote on Y policies that go directly against the goal.
@MattVallone Elections are every two years. Budget resolutions are supposed to be done every year but rarely are done in election years. Lawmakers recognize this and have done three two-year deals in a row.
@MattVallone Congressional budget resolution that is supposed to set top lines needs 51 votes in Senate and no POTUS signature. Approps bills need 60 and POTUS approval (or 2/3s). Senate minority &amp; POTUS incentivized to block approps if no agreement on top lines.
@MattVallone For example, 4-6 weeks of recess followed by 3-4 weeks to finish funding gov (usually many other issues) seems like questionable workflow design. Deadline one month before Eday incentivizes optimistic lawmakers to push for CRs with hope of more power later. 3/
@MattVallone Additionally, budget process reform should not be judged on an immediate improvement in meeting deadlines, fiscal outcomes, etc.. but whether the new process is better than the old one over many years. The process can't control politics, but it could be improved. 2/
@MattVallone I'd argue there are aspects of the current budget process that haven't consistently worked well under any combination of power. Calling for reform can't be an excuse for not doing your job, but that doesn't mean reform couldn't help. 1/

@ernietedeschi @econwonk Indeed, and even longer for lawmakers to come to an agreement. A smart trigger acts faster than Congress.
@econwonk @ernietedeschi The purpose is not to increase taxes in a recession. It is to increase taxes when overly optimistic claims about growth do not come true. It is inconsistent to push magical growth assumptions, oppose a trigger, and oppose following JCT score.

@ScottElliotG I suppose what I'm getting at is that the uncertainty delta between a trigger and no trigger is smaller than it appears. A trigger makes part of the implicit political trigger explicit.

@ScottElliotG With elections every two years and waves happening more and more, is there much certainty that a large narrowly passed deficit financed rate cut will stick anyway?

@TheJoshCaplan @SethHanlon @sahilkapur I'm not excusing anything or saying we would have had bipar situation if there was more fiscal space. I was there working for the policy co-chair of the Blue Dogs. Getting to 60  and 218 for stimulus was not just a matter of GOP opposition.
@TheJoshCaplan @SethHanlon @sahilkapur I think that's a false dichotomy. Hard to know how the votes would have landed but all else equal better to have more fiscal space going into a recession. Certainly some moderate heartburn on size of initial stimulus as well.
@SethHanlon @sahilkapur You can imagine ways to structure it that would help avoid a big tax bump in a steep recession.
@SethHanlon @sahilkapur Another way to view it is that if the early 2000s tax cuts had such a trigger, it would have gone off earlier and we would have had more fiscal space to fight the great recession.

@BenDAvanzo Can you explain or point me in the right direction? Haven't followed as closely in recent years. Looks like the amd changes the ACA directly
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks @USCBO You still look at the overall bill and decide if the fund cuts are worth it, but this amendment makes the bill better IMO. 11/11
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks @USCBO In the case of this specific amendment, it finds money for the fund by cutting it less than the original bill. 10/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks @USCBO So if it is worthwhile then find the $$ to do it (which ACA did). 9/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks I don't think if you ask @USCBO to look at the long-term budget impact of spending in the fund they would find that it offsets itself. 8/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks Meaning that we should do health programs if they are effective and be willing to find the $$ through taxes or cuts in spending elsewhere 7/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks At the same time we should be realistic about any budget impacts they do have and not count savings unless the evidence base is there. 6/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks In general my view is that these investments should be done if they meet a cost/benefit test that is much broader than the budget impact. 5/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks And/or focus on specific programs that are only a fraction of what the prevention and public health fund is spent on... 4/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks The publications I have seen that claim large savings usually ignore the increased costs from people living longer, etc.. 3/
@BenDAvanzo @repgregwalden @HouseCommerce @HouseDemocrats @BudgetHawks But I haven't seen evidence to suggest that $1 in prevention/public health leads to $1 in savings in the federal budget. 2/

@ChrisVanHollen @OMBPress @POTUS @BudgetHawks However, @ChrisVanHollen and Mulvaney agreed debt should be addressed &amp; @ChrisVanHollen said Mulvaney has had a rep as a straight shooter.
