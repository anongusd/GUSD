@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Tell me why veterans cannot get treatment for mental health? Then we wonder why we have Gun violence. We could debate healthcare and other taxation‚Äôs that where suppose to make life better, but made Politicians lives better behind their gated homes.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople There are millions of those stories. How about telling me why welfare is abused so much that when people honestly need it, the system has been played by able bodied people, that those in need can‚Äôt get ANYTHING. when they do it‚Äôs embarrassing.

@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople So here we go. When someone doesn‚Äôt like getting debated we look for grammatical errors lol. Typical of those that are ‚Äúsmarter than the average‚Äù American like Yogi LoL. Most average Americans are smarter than a career college brainwashed graduate. IMOJS üòé
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople And there are government programs to help those that truly need medical insurance, BUT OH-Bummer made it a ‚ÄúRight‚Äù for those that Couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfind employment‚Äù. So we extended unemployment Benefits, broadened Title 6 and made welfare benefits unlimited and made the farmer suffer.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Yeah, ole Burn has multiple luxury cars. And yes his Wife is a crook. It runs in the DC bloodline
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Good ole career thief at his best. You do know his wife stole money and is under investigation. I don‚Äôt trust a liar that preaches free stuff while driving luxury cars. Kinda redundant.
@Avenge_mypeople @NanInKansas When jobs left American soil, benefits went with them. They can say what they want, but greedy people and Unions ruined our economy. People aren‚Äôt content with just earning a fair living, we want the Jones life style on a poppers pocket book
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Drop it and get good paying jobs back in the picture. Get these corrupt Unions that used to have the workers best Interest at heart. That‚Äôs what the ‚ÄúDemacratic‚Äù party used to be, the working class people. Now unions are just as corrupt as Washington.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople See that‚Äôs how ‚Äúeducated‚Äù you are. My company is self insured. The employees pay into an account and the company puts In the rest. Not everyone goes through those companies you reference. Health care in America is all scam. What I pay for a procedure isn‚Äôt what someone else pays
@Avenge_mypeople @NanInKansas The ACA dubbed my companies plan a ‚ÄúCadillac‚Äù plan. My plan was taxed, and our cost doubled. With the Trump tax cuts, my paycheck has went up to about pre-ACA amount. This health care for all is a scam. These people that think it‚Äôs a right need to burden the cost.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Again. Educate people on how to work. Debating with a know it all proves how dumb I am for even engaging with you. Healthcare for all. What a scam. Walk on by Felicia
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople I‚Äôve had health care for 26 years because I a job that offers it. This health care for all is bull. Want benefits, get a job that offers them. Don‚Äôt tax me more because others want something for nothing. Work for it. Don‚Äôt give me that guilt trip.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople Yeah, right. Science has gotten me my 6 figure job. BULL. Hard work and Finding employment that other see as ‚Äúbelow‚Äù them is what‚Äôs gotten me forward. Science is a joke.
@NanInKansas @Avenge_mypeople It‚Äôs 2018, voting should be an exact science. Guest ‚Äúscientists‚Äù get it wrong as well lol. Lesser educated, doesn‚Äôt always mean squat.
