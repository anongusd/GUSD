@Olivianuzzi That's supposed to happen before the big meeting, not afterwards. As usual the only  thing this President is capable of doing is drumming up publicity. Actual diplomacy? Not so much. What a waste of time...

@k_chris1 @uzererr @greta I'm old enough to remember that news comes in forms other than television channels devoted mostly to commentary.

@ArtSchnurple @sarahkendzior It's what a lot of people are saying, because it's obvious.
@EdKrassen #ImpeachTheMotherfuckersPlural
@RealSaavedra Yeah, this is America! No one has to apologize for being an asshole, being an asshole is a God given right.
@MalcolmNance @FBI He's Waiting for his 9/11 to happen, he thinks it's the only way to get his ratings back up, like it did for Bush.
@roflinds @ProudResister Goodnight, hope you don't wake up to a shit show.
@MalcolmNance We always knew why.

@meganamram Hell yeah
@StevenBeschloss @blueIndycat Manafort was banking on Trump not finishing out his term.
@ida_skibenes He doubled the rates at Mar-A-Lago the first week he was President.   Execs are openly bribing the president by getting rooms at his DC hotel.  He's getting paid and he don't give a fuck who knows.  #ImpeachTheMF
@nachosarah @realDonaldTrump I'm used to hearing that old ignorant conservative canard "derp derp, gee it's so cold, what happened to global warming" every winter from dumb fools who don't know the difference between climate and weather.  But to hear it every winter from the president?  Not next winter!
@ruffnerr @adrikasdream @adamcbest That wall at the Alamo didn't work very well.
@elianayjohnson Art of the Deal indeed.
@Stop_Trump20 The bear has always been there with tRump, we need to take down tRump AND the bear.
@SundaeLee Trump is perfectly okay with less security, because he is hoping for another 9/11. He thinks a terrorist attack would improve his approval ratings the same way it did with Bush. So why would he want to prevent that?
@SteveKingIA @Bencjacobs @realDonaldTrump So what you are saying is that this wall is symbolic, not practical? We're shutting down the government for an ineffectual symbol? If it is ever built, it will stand as a monument to hubris and narcissism and people on both sides of the border will see it as nothing else.
@1pissedPolack I like to say gezundheit cuz it's a funny word that I can't actually spell

@nprmusic Hi how is your night so far?
@instagram suspended the new instagram account I created for my band 76 and who knows why? I posted like five 20-year old album covers and that was it. @spotify says I need an instagram account to be able to claim the rights to my band name so I'm sure i'll get denied yet again.

@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump I've been telling my Trump-loving mother for years, literal years PLURAL, at this point, and she just shrugs it off, turns on some Rush Limbaugh on the radio, the two-minutes hate that is Fox News and that gives her enough wherewithal and flat earth logic to ignore reality.

@grantstern If it was Chelsea Clinton who was buddies with El Chapo's dirty mobbed up banker the right would shit a brick and we'd never hear the end of it. But since this isn't out of character for Don Jr. we'll all just collectively shrug it off as business as usual.

@funder Republicans haven't lost a close election in Georgia since before 2002 and I fear they won't lose this one either. Ever since #Diebold helped steal the governor's and Senate seats the @GOP has been emboldened to do it every election with zero consequences.
@LogsdailD The only Republican I will vote for is the one who vows to vote for impeachment. But the @GOP is too chickenshit to do anything about the wannabe gangster they helped put into power and every republican candidate has been mute. So, now we must vote them in to oblivion.

@pwnallthethings What is interesting is to look at the few countries in the New World that don't have birthright citizenship and see *why* and *when* they changed their laws to do away with jus soli now that Trump wants to drag the US back in to Old World too.
@pwnallthethings It should be noted that birthright citizenship isn't unique to the United States, but is right found throughout the New World. It is the most original of American rights, it is *so* American that it predates the U.S. by centuries.
@shearm @realDonaldTrump "Fear of immigration" is the driving force behind this wannabe president. Hell his 'issues' page on his website only had the single issue on the page for the first month of his candidacy because his ignorant followers are it up like it was the 1990's or something.

@davidfrum Yeah, It's harder to investigate once you quit getting your loans from legit banks and start getting them from Russian mobsters instead.
@thehill @realDonaldTrump "Republicans believe in the rule of law" is the greatest lie in 21st century American politics. It's laughable when not one @GOP voter gives a shit that Kavanaugh lies to Congress or that @realDonaldTrump is a wanna-be mobster involved in organized crime.

@4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump So you are saying he knows better than anyone how unreliable a source can be.
@realDonaldTrump Just like when The President says "FAKE news", so too when he says news is"fiction" one should just read that he saying "BAD news". Yes sir, you are bad news, so the news reports will reflect that reality. Quit doing shitty thing and there will be less BAD news to report.

@kilroymcspunk @realDonaldTrump An actual Russian #SpaceForce doesn't have to actually be created, but money can still be thrown at it, and then another gangster oligarch can be made rich and Putin can take his cut. 		No doubt Trump thinks he'll do the same, thing but I doubt he'll be able to make it that far.
Trump loves breaking treaties so no wonder he's chomping at the bit to create this #SpaceForce even though the 1967 Outer Space Treaty forbids it.		If Obama had signed a treaty promising to "ignore the water crisis in Flint", Trump would fix the crisis just to spite everyone.

@ZERTZ_86 Fuckin' sleezy, @foxnews Oh sure, y'all are gonna remove the tweet, like the coward pretend journalists you are.  Gonna issue a retraction?  Nah, that's what real journalists do. @foxnews is just an entertainment channel that sits in for @realDonaldTrump's intel briefings.
@MollyMcKew They're wannabe mobsters who got caught up and used by real mobsters, and they barely know how to MS Word, no wonder they were such easy marks. They managed to bumble their way in to the Presidency and their usefulness to the mob is up as spotlight shine down on their operations.
@AnaSwanson Pretty much every single "problem" @realDonaldTrump is trying to "solve" are problems pretty much from the 80's and the 90's.  His base hasn't moved on from them, and neither has he.  Angry @foxnews feeds the paranoia and fear and their viewers live in a different detached world.

@tempora_magda There's others who think Brexit is great:		Vladimir Putin (proven mobster)	Cambridge Analytica (proven troll)	Donald Trump (proven to repeat anything his russian handlers give him)
So I have three theories why @lafourcade is quoting an obscure @TMBG song.		1. Both songs are referencing a third older song.		2. @lafourcade is a @TMBG fan, she is musically prolific and influenced by American alternative		3. la coincidencia extrana
Compare: @TMBG Mr. Xcitement 2001 https://t.co/ZdXGKa0CRx		To: Natalia @lafourcade https://t.co/5kxsVEo9OO at about 2:20 in to the song (which is one of the best on that album.)		#CafeConPan
I refuse to believe it is una coincidencia that @TMBG sings "cafe con pan... cafe con pan..." in their 2001 song 'Mr. Xcitement' pretty much in the same way that Natalia @lafourcade would sing "cafe con pan.. cafe con pan..." 16 years later in "Mi Tierra Veracruzana"
