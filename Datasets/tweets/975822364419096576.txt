This is false. Gorsuch is equally conservative, but didn't face the opposition Kavanaugh has. This has less to do w/ Kavanaugh replacing a swing vote &amp; more to do with the fact that he committed sexual assault. Sexual assault, by the way, is a bipartisan sin. https://t.co/29DbiBUzem

Probably what happened, in my uneducated, uninformed view: Kavanaugh was drunk when he assaulted Dr. Ford, so he has no memory of it whatsoever.
