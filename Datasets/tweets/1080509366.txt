The state of our union IS strong! #SOTU
"our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote.  To speak out." #SOTU

"When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer" #SOTU

So true: "doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities" #SOTU

We shouldn’t be asking hardworking men and women to work for poverty wages to make up for the fiscal deficit Illinois faces.
#RightToWork zones will depress wages across the state by incentivizing companies to towns where they can pay lower wages and fewer benefits
Gov. Rauner’s #RightToWork zones would drag all corners of Illinois into a race to the bottom.
