the first time I met this dog, he barked like crazy at me. This goes for the second and third time as well. There has not been a fourth. I don’t blame him. He’s a fugitive. On the lam, he’s wanted in Alabama but holed up in a safe house in one of the two Carolinas @AnnCoulter https://t.co/MM9HVHsiY2

@AnnCoulter ive actually read julian's book. he's a boring, milktoast low key guy...i'm sure he'll outcharisma 40 other contenders and then TRUMP
when you have A dirty room in your house, you dont have a clean house. thats our illegal immigration problem		these Dreamers are not victims of circumstance, my friends, but perpetrators of a SCAM! @TuckerCarlson
when you have a dirty room in your house, you dont have a clean house. thats our immigration problem. Alabama passed a law to have a census of schools, the turnout rate dropped significantly. these Dreamers are not victims of circumstance, but perpetrators of a SCAM! @AnnCoulter
@AnnCoulter i'd rather see Sotomayor go. she wouldnt even use the term "illegal" immigrant. her allegiance is to her immigrant family, not the US Constitution. WHERE'S THE RULE OF LAW? @realDonaldTrump
