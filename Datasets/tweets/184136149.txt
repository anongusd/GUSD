4 Dem SCOTUS justices are as political/results-oriented as any ever. No way they give Trump a win. More likely, he loses Kennedy or Roberts
.. so some in admin argue to just fight current hand out asap
No matter how narrowly a new EO was drafted, it would inevitably inspire more legal challenges &amp; admin would be right back in litigation..
Beyond being uncharacteristic admission of defeat/error, narrower EO runs risk of being tied up right back in court.
Despite CW, don't discount the prospect of a re-drafted EO. Best-case legal outcomes for POTUS now would take a long time
Question: has General Flynn hired a private attorney?
I think in this case, the Professor is expressing a (minority) legal view that isn't germane to the immediate realities POTUS faces https://t.co/PKTVyPTunV

Republicans who savaged Comey in July for bad judgment now turning him into some paragon of good judgment &amp; prosecutorial purity.
Comey's July behavior was no more proper than this. Team Clinton's praise for him then was pure politics. Now they are semi-stuck w/him
Beyond it being 10 days pre-elex, FBI/DOJ shouldn't be talking about probes, ongoing or possible, anywhere publicly but in court.
Comey presumably is asking himself why he is getting such vast bipartisan condemnation for his judgment. Or, shockingly, maybe he isn't
