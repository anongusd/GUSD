Questions for #Cohen: Any corroboration of your speakerphone conv w Trump &amp; Stone? Ever been to Prague? Did Sekulow et al make your testimony false? Why did Trump deal only with Deutsche Bk? Did Trump submit false documents to get Buff Bills' loan? Who else discussed Stormy deal?
Bipartisan incompetence in the questioning at #cohen hearing. All they do is make speeches, and fail to listen to answers or follow up.

One great advantage of @DianeFeinstein 's advanced age is that she is one of the few people left in public life who remembers when abortion was illegal. She vividly recaptures of the horror of those days for women.

@ChuckGrassley is 84. @DianeFeinstein is 85. Both seem a great deal less nimble and aware than their younger colleagues.

Remember, Mueller and a Democratic House can now give Michael Cohen immunity without fear of jeopardizing any prosecution, since he's already pleaded guilty. That means Cohen would have to testify in grand jury and before Congress in public. We will hear more from Cohen.
It may be that the Trump presidency will be divided into pre- and post-August 21, 2018 periods.
Cohen committed crimes "In co-ordination with, and at the direction of" @realDonaldTrump . Thus, President appears to be co-conspirator and/or aider and abettor of a federal crime.
It is outrageous that major national news is taking place in two federal courtrooms right now -- re Michael Cohen and Manafort -- and no cameras are allowed inside. There should be cameras in courtrooms.

Sessions' answer is clearly false. But was it intentionally false? Sessions can't be the one to make that determination.

The problems with the Ninth Circuit's decision. My @NewYorker column.		https://t.co/8L7kKxyADp
9th cir panel rules unanimously against Trump admin and maintains stay of immigration executive order.
9th cir will hand down Trump exc order decision on stay by 5pm PST tonight.
All 3 judges seem to believe that WA AG has standing, but Clifton seems to favor Trump on the merits. (Just a guess . . . )
Judges seem to be asking WA AG for the ways to rule for him. Generally sympathetic to his position.
WA AG lawyer off to weak start on a procedural issue that clearly does not interest the court.
Trump admin lawyer never heard of Pierce, very famous 1925 case which struck down anti-parochial school law.
Trump admin lawyer is getting mauled in the 9th Cir. Doesn't mean govt will lose, but stil . . . #travelban

Yes, Eisenhower was surprised by Warren and Brennan. But that was a long, long time ago.
Don't believe that Presidents are surprised by their #scotus appointments. They get what they want - and #Trump will too.

Can the jury follow all these supposed contradictions? I'm having trouble. #zimmermantrial
Prosecutor seems to be betting his case that contradictions will sink GZ. But are these contradictions so incriminating? #zimmermantrial
Prosecutor exploiting weakest defense claim -- that TM reached for the gun. #zimmermantrial
@jimguillemette It's common.
Claim: Both Martin and Zimmerman were on top at some point? Is that consistent with the evidence? #zimmermantrial
