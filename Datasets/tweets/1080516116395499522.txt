Last weekend, 7 #KS03 federal employees took the time to talk to me in person about how the #shutdown is impacting them &amp; their families. I am working for them &amp; for everyone unrightfully bearing the burden of Washington dysfunction. https://t.co/cEcglRMC9y
A lot of people are asking. We'll share committee assignments as soon as we have them! https://t.co/MfRWc6640K
This morning I was able to testify before the House Committee on Natural Resources about the impact the #shutdown is having in #KS03, #Kansas, and Indian Country. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me, so I may share them with Congress.

Today marks the longest gov. #shutdown in our country‚Äôs history. Real people are being forced to bear the burden of this dysfunction. Tomorrow, I‚Äôm meeting with federal employees in #KS03 who have been impacted to hear directly from them.
Everyone deserves a shot at success. Working with leaders like @LauraKellyKS at all levels of government, we‚Äôll bring more opportunity to everyone in #KS03 and our great state. https://t.co/ScK3WC6Tqc
@patrickjsallee @danielleinkc Thanks for being in touch! Feel free to call our offices too if need be!
@Davis_Hammet YES!
@SSCJoCoKs @RepEileenHorn Well done!
I met with @Rep_Watkins today to explore ways we can work together to benefit the people of Kansas. It is my hope we can find pragmatic solutions to move our state and country forward. #KS02 #KS03 https://t.co/lB6UunAb2J
There are 19K+ federal employees in #KS03 metro area and many more contractors - none of whom are at fault for this #shutdown mess. That's why I fully support the bills that guarantee these hard working people receive full back pay.
I know many people in #KS03 are impacted by the #shutdown. If you're affected, please let me know by DMing here or contacting one of my offices with your #ShutdownStory.
I fully support the bills that guarantee backpay to our federal workers &amp; government contractors. These people need to support their families &amp; we need to make sure they get paid for the important work they do. 	https://t.co/RZD1s3Sule
A sincere thank you to the brave men and women of all our local law enforcement agencies who work hard to keep our #KS03 communities safe every day. 	#LawEnforcementAppreciationDay
@burdett_loomis @MelissaCinOP @sharicedavids @RogerMarshallMD @RonEstesKS @Steve4Kansas @JerryMoran Thanks for pointing this out - it is incorrect. This is boiler plate language that was loaded onto our website. We will remove it. We're still in the process of working out our internship program and will announce as soon as we have more information.
I was able to speak with local representatives of the @AFGENational yesterday to learn more about how the #shutdown is impacting people in #KS03. Our federal workers should not bear the burden of DC's dysfunction. We need to get our employees back to work with their paychecks.
@ej_becker @sharicedavids @KMBZradio @danielleinkc Glad we‚Äôve gotten in touch and I hope to chat with you soon!
More than 19K people in the KC metro are employed by the federal government &amp; many of you are being impacted by the #shutdown. If you're a #KS03 constituent who is furloughed or working w/o pay, I'd like to hear from you. Please DM or comment here.
You trusted me to stop the influence of big money in our gov. &amp; to end the culture of corruption in DC. Those are foundational issues that impact every other issue I‚Äôve talked about - from healthcare to gun violence. That's why I'm co-sponsoring #HR1.		https://t.co/3vgzgjHwWN

@LauraKellyKS @KansasDems Look forward to partnering with you and your team to do great work for our state!
We need to get the government back to work for the people. This package has previously received bipartisan support and I‚Äôm hopeful it is the path forward to ending this shutdown. https://t.co/zAy6H64BWE
