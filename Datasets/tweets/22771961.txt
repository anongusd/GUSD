Trump’s Oval Office address was almost entirely recycled rhetoric from his rallies and immigration speeches.
Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall through the new trade deal. That’s not how the new trade deal works.
In his Oval Office address... Trump is painting undocumented immigrants as criminals. This has not changed since he launched his run for the White House.
One Trump adviser put the stakes for Trump in pretty stark terms. If he doesn't get his wall, this adviser said, "it will absolutely be something that we have to deal with in the reelection... At some point you're either a chief executive or not." https://t.co/iYw7xj2k63
Trump has been reaching out to friends and advisers to ask about national emergency declaration at the border. Several of those folks have told Trump it "probably won't work" from a legal standpoint, I'm told. He is receiving advice that he should do it anyway to please his base.

Trump’s continued talk of a middle class tax cut right before the midterms, like at tonight’s rally in Texas, apppears to be an acknowledgment that the GOP tax cut is not viewed by enough Americans as particularly helpful to them and perhaps more geared toward wealthier folks.

The American Legion heard from a WH staffer who thanked the vets group for its pointed statement strongly urging Trump to issue a proclamation honoring the late Senator John McCain.  WH aides were privately hoping Trump would change his mind on McCain all day long, I'm told.
Moments ago, Trump after all the evening newscasts (on East Coast) finally speaks on McCain in front of the cameras: “Also our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Sen. John McCain...and we very much appreciate everything Sen McCain has done for our country.”
Asked what changed in terms of releasing a traditional presidential statement on the passing of John McCain and why the proclamation was issued today, Sarah Sanders would only say this:  "President’s decision to do and the statement speaks for itself."
RT @cspan: Desk of Senator John McCain in the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/6lYavn3ujf
Make no mistake. The president and his team had every opportunity to get this right. It took nearly 48 hours for WH to do what should have been done Saturday -- issue a full, respectful statement honoring McCain along with a proclamation that orders flags to fly at half-staff.

One way to address the briefing is for reporters to stick together when the press sec cuts somebody off.  Ideally we could and should insist on answers if somebody is cut off. We don't do that as much as we should. Problem is there is so little time and so many pressing q's.
Folks will say because @PressSec doesn't really answer our questions and holds very short briefings that we should do away with these press avails. That would be a terrible mistake. Remember... the non-answers can be as revealing as the answers.
The WH briefings are becoming shorter and more rare. The WH and their allies will blame the press. But there’s no question this WH only believes accountability largely comes by talking to friendly media.
As expected, @PressSec referred questions about her own false statements about Trump Tower meeting to outside legal counsel. Perhaps one of the biggest dodges in briefing room history.
