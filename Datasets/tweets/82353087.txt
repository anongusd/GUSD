@TeriKayS It is not the goal, M'Dear...but the journey.  Be the bell....or some other such nonsense.  You got this! #RedBelle
#GSTweetChat  Well done and thank you!
@SKCkettlebells #GSTweetChat Marvelous insight, thank you!
@icechamber @SKCkettlebells Wowza!
@SKCkettlebells Continue please...how many warm up reps of each bell? Trying to optimize set before fatigue.
@SKCkettlebells #GSTweetChat Thank you...related then...How many reps approx. does it take for you to 'feel' the groove before your set?
@icechamber Thank you! #GSTweetChat
#GSTweetChat  Europeans:  What kind of coaching/judging instructions are given around free arm movement at fixation?
#GSTweetChat  Of all things to correct for snatch...which is MOST important in order to increase reps (besides basic cardio)?

I began the day thinking of how far I have to go.  I ended the day reminding myself of how far I've come. #Lovetolift #RedBelles
@dougseamansCPT Well done Coach!
#Yeticoach: If you ask any twelve Russian coaches which is the right technique they will each say, "My way."  #Doyourownthing #Trystuff
@TeriKayS Yes, Ma'am.  After my snatch set, of course.
First full day of AKA/IUKL judging: tiring but gratifying. With authority comes great responsibility.  (I ended one set early. Yikes!)
@icechamber Thanks from the Colonel!! He's happy with his new technique...and amused by how you knew it was a new PR :-)
@TeriKayS to be of service to your loved ones, you must feel fulfilled.  Honor the fire in your belly while it burns.
I have found the Internet in South Water Caye, Belize!  Shhhh...don't tell :-) (Near Tobacco Reef on Google maps)
@dougseamansCPT You will prevail. Thank you for excellent role modeling.
@TeriKayS Damn!  I'm clearly not friends with the right high drama peeps!!

Called #Vitamix to order a replacement 64oz low profile container.  CustSat is sending me one 4 FREE. Thank you! #BuyVitamix #MadeinUSA
RT @ivandenisov82: The World Record in women's kettlebell snatch. Ks: http://t.co/ree8iGc2pM –Ω–∞ @YouTube
Seriously surprised and delighted by #Vitamix Customer Service and their courtesy #replacementcontainer.  So happy with their product!
Observation: 400 unweighted squats hurts just as much as 40 weighted long bar squats the next day in high heels. Just sayin'
@kettleguard They'll be disappointed when YOU'RE not for sale, personally!  You go!
RT @icechamber: As they say, "the devil is in the details." The smallest technical errors become expensive mistakes as we progress. http://‚Ä¶
Go, @Melswanson24!  You're gonna be EPIC!!!
Go @SVoinar! Have the set of your life!

Your 1RM isn't an indication of your good health. But it says tons about your insecurities. Just sayin'.

Been to two different #FedEx stores in two weeks.  If you want to know why #UPS cleans your clocks, just ask.
Just created a professional account:  @sfinkelmurphy  for all tweets and info IBM.  Follow me there for "work" related!
Not recommending #SaratogaGiftBasketsFail.  Saratoga Salsa delivery too. 10 baskets/3.5 wks lead. All late and no gift msgs.
@Rochelle_JC @Ticketmaster #ticketmasterfail  You block my high-integrity friend, you lose my business too. #Votewithmywallet
Trying to get copies made on #staples.com  Thinking it makes #healthcare.gov look pretty good.  #StaplesFail  Headed to the store. Sigh.
@AskCiti Thanks, JC from TX for the swift assistance.  You've redeemed the bank ;-)  App reinstalled = success!  #twitterservice effective
Performance of #citibank mobile banking is AWFUL.  It's been four days and I can't deposit a damned check!  #onlyrecourseoflittlepeople
@TimeWarnerIntelligentHome isn't.  I pay a lot of money for something poorly conceived and executed.  #timewarner fail
#Verizonfail  FURIOUS with these people. Readback of CS transcript says I should take it up with my bank?  Escalating.  #VerizonLies.
I use this to vent cust sat issues because I'm told brand mgmt via social is something vendors do for customers. #onlyrecourseoflittlepeople
#VerizonFail  Been tracking down a lost payment since 7/2.  VZ and VZwireless have no clue they are the same company.  #heldhostagebygreed
#SouthwestAir fail at Pittsburgh.  Does nobody have the sense to open a boarding pass only line if the one kiosk is down? #treatedlikecattle
I was wrong #BallardDesignsFail.  The first product arrived broken. Made in China.  I should have known better.
#FoodNetwork:  Good call on #PaulaDeen.  That kind of stupid won't be missed.  You'll be doing Americans' health a favor too!
#BallardDesigns thank you for a very nice customer service experience and for correcting the invoice.  I'll shop you again!
#leukemialymphomasociety you do NOT have the right to ask for my zip when I'm unsubscribing.  My donations are my biz, not your mktng opp.
#TimeWarnerIntelligentHome is quiet.  But it scares me.  I know it's just waiting for the time to strike.  Even the panel mocks me at night.
#TimeWarnerIntelligentHome 3rd service time a charm. Slept thru night with no alarm.  Now receiving more love from #TWC than I can stand.
#TimeWarnerIntelligentHomeFail continues.  Last night, after 2nd service call, alarm went off and I burst into tears.  They just pulled up.
#timewarnerintelligenthome isn't.  I should have gotten a dog.
