@Patrioticbeagle @HeloSafety @MelindaFirst100 @AlexineBook @SarahPalinUSA What's the difference? If u can send me to the battlefield at 18, why not voting
@tradewindsirie @TODAYshow But how does enlist at the army at the age of 18?
@Willystyle17 @Samodame @SarahPalinUSA They are insane bro. I landed in Iraq on my 19th bday.
@skycheeks @SarahPalinUSA But they can join the military at 18 like I did. I was 18 when I enlisted
@AlexineBook @SarahPalinUSA I was 18 and I join the military? So I think 18yrs is mature enough
@Samodame @SarahPalinUSA I was 18 when I join the army
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump And Mexico paying for it

@PhilipJWalsh @SarahPalinUSA They are part of America
@SlayKing911 @front_row_seat @GMA @21savage That's their problem bro, they think everybody is on welfare without even knowing them. It's Republican mentality when 90% of them are on one form of welfare

@RepMarkMeadows For the past 2yrs, u are not working with us? So u wanna start working with us today, what happens to the past 2yrs?
@PGRBigRedTrk @seanhannity Then will he speak to the families of those killed in Parkland, Sandy Hook, Aurora-Colorado, and in Las Vegas, just to name a few....

@BreitbartNews And he is not an illegal immigrant. I thought only illegal immigrant do such a crime
@JackKingston Are they killed by an illegal immigrant?? https://t.co/Vi1PHENTeM
@SarahPalinUSA if you call a national emergency for border security you can easily call a national emergency for gun violence. Have you not seen all the mass shootings the last couple yrs? The rise in gun violence? @realDonaldTrump should be careful about his defining of natl emergency.
@Steven_Scibetta @realDonaldTrump They are not killed by immigrant https://t.co/la6mE09Jbz

@JackKingston @AOC U are in love with her,  seriously u follow her like a stalker
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce So American vets have to wait till the border is done? People who served and fought for this country have to wait will be border is all done to be consider
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce When did that law passed? Why many vets are not aware of that? And what kind of mistreatment are they talking about?
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce What is the present administration doing? Remember am dealing with veterans
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Who's fault is that
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce So the border is the only problem American have? Not veterans from the combat zone with a mental problem, one of my friend just took him life on Monday after serving for 20yrs. Veterans homelessness, veterans health care.
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce I love this country with all my heart, that's why I put on the uniform since 1996 and I'm a proud immigrant, we need to stop the fear-mongering, with all due respect to him, his last nite speech is all about putting fear into people heart
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Half of mass shooter have no criminal background.
@Lynn56026169 @GordonGoodall @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Where did I ever mention race, u see your lack of comprehension
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce More American kill by stupid gun than anywhere in world, even more than Iraq and Syria
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Hate will not take u anywhere.
@Lynn56026169 @MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Can you comprehend 1000000 of American who die in the hand of American born citizen
@MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends @Justice4Pierce Parkland Shooter:	Not an immigrant	Tree Of Life Shooter:	Not an immigrant.	Las Vegas Shooter:	Not an immigrant	Borderline Bar &amp; Grill Shooter:	Not an immigrant.	Sandy Hook Shooter:	Not an immigrant.	Charleston Shooter:	Not an immigrant.

@Maccagnano_Life @cybah @realDonaldTrump Am a Patriot America military personnel for 16yrs and am still serving, but I don't support him, instead of  that stupid wall why not veteran mental health, veteran suicide programs, homelessness.
@koushikspeaknow @realDonaldTrump Not true
@GovMikeHuckabee Your are an idiot seriously
@GOP @realDonaldTrump GOP controlled Congress for two years and didn't give Trump a wall. 	Don't blame the Democrats for this.

@JackKingston Good, let him go on, so that will open the chance for our next Democratic president to make gun control an emergency issue.
@PaulBabeuAZ @FoxNews @seanhannity @mamendoza480 @SteveRonnebeck @mroot769 What about the everyday gun violence issue we face? What about the 58 from Vegas, 17 from stoneman Douglas, the 10 from santa fe. The mass shootings have happened and it's always white males with mental health issues. We need to focus on mental health crisis. We need to focus
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN Fake totally fake, he doesn't watch your boring show.

@flapjackjones24 @ChieverJason @votevets @tedlieu @RepTedLieu You are lying to your bone.
@Rirdan @NumbersUSA @MarkSKrikorian U not even making any sense bye
@GPN14 U sound happy about 800,000 families are not getting paid
@LastStand2019 America should “build a wall of steel, a wall as high as Heaven" against the flow of immigrants.--Georgia Gov. Clifford Walker, at a 1924 convention of the Ku Klux Klan, then a powerful force at a time of strain for the white working class.
@MarkSKrikorian @jmeacham Trump is an idiot
@GPN14 If he cared so much about this country, he wouldn't be using 800K federal workers and their families and loved ones as political pawns. And he wouldn't take action that could put millions of American children in jeopardy for their next meal. And Congress is doing their jobs.
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe Thanks and goodnite bro its getting late here on my side of the world away from state.
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe Now my question is should be going after the big fish or the small one? Those hiring them walking free, even know own company knowingly hired many of them.
@natalie_swaner @RepRichHudson That's a lie, i work in a security field.. Just go check on FBI data. Plz if u want our conversation to go be honest don't lie to me. Am not that dumb or naive am very current
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe Yes I came here as a kid, and none of my parents ever applied for any government assistance. Lot of immigrants are very hard working people, yes we have bad people among us but that should not make all of us look bad
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe But u might make a mistake seeing them driving nice car thinking they doing illegal things some of them are very hard working holding more than two jobs
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe I agree most of these issues can be solved if we don't play politics, look at veterans homelessness and the condition at all the VAs hospitals
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe I am an immigrant serve this country for 16yrs and still serving 4 combat tour of duty, all u need to understand not all of us immigrants Are enemy of this country and thousands like me are still serving this country we need compassion
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe I now know u have zero idea about US immigration system people like u are Trump main target who have zero clue about visa processing system and time consume
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe But custom and border patrol admit that more drugs comes through the port of entry
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe I bet you know illegal commit less crime than us natural citizen. And we cannot paint every immigrant and criminal legal or illegal
@4EverHeckman @CBSNews @edokeefe Can gun victims sue congress for doing nothing too?
@natalie_swaner @RepRichHudson But it's ok for us to killed each other? How many American die through Gun violence? We American commit more crime than illegal
@lizpeek @jeremynewberger @BillHemmer There was nothing too interesting in that speech, and nothing too interesting about that speech.

@KatieTa57380065 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer @SenKamalaHarris The U.S. Treasury Department says that the national debt has increased by $2 trillion ($2,000,000,000,000) since President Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017. That's with Republicans in control of the House and Senate. The national debt is now almost $22 trillion.
@KatieTa57380065 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer @SenKamalaHarris Maybe these conservative need reminded that there's over 40,000 homeless veterans in this country AND GI Bill vets are not getting their monthly allowance for over a year due to old computers.  But yeah, let's pump a billion into a ludicrous wall.

@SenateGOP @SenatorCollins Maybe these conservative need reminded that there's over 40,000 homeless veterans in this country AND GI Bill vets are not getting their monthly allowance for over a year due to old computers.  But yeah, let's pump a billion into a ludicrous wall.

@gking505 @newtgingrich Remember u talking to a vet who spend 16yrs of his life in the service. He was too busy impeaching Clinton no time for veterans .
@gking505 @newtgingrich Why should i? What he did for us.why not u tell me as I don't see or know any bill passed during him term as a speaker.
@newtgingrich I wish you did the same for our veterans, stand up for us after deployment, stand up for our health care, fight for us like we did for u.
@ReaganWorld Did u forget those uber drivers too are hard morning people and my of the are veterans too?
@GOP @SteveScalise What is GOP stand for veterans?? Can i guys take same strong stand to see VA funded and no veterans is homeless
@MarkSKrikorian Are u not doing same when one immigrant do something bad? U jump us blaming the whole millions of them
@tjmac48 @SarahPalinUSA @POTUS I dont buy your story
@tjmac48 @SarahPalinUSA Do u even listen to yourself?? What a heartless human u are. So we have to fix immigration first before they take care of us? Are u even listening to yourself, when did u last visit VA and thanks those service men and women?
@bull1063 @SarahPalinUSA Yea i was in there 2000
@bull1063 @SarahPalinUSA I spent 14yrs of my life serving 4 combat tour so u think u love this country more than me?? Left my newborn here to go and fought this country, and u think I hate this country? After 14yrs u still have that feeling i hate America.
@bull1063 @SarahPalinUSA Bruh as a vet who has complained about this very same fake lip service it is good to see someone with your platform speak on it. Keep you ribbons and car stickers If you support us talk to your representative and ask them why we are forgotten about once our service has ended.
@bull1063 @SarahPalinUSA You sound like u never wore that uniform. So we have to wait for the border first before we take care of us who so everything for that country
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA Thanks for your service too combat vet both Iraq and afghan
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA Most American people care less about service men and women. We are the least respected people in society
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA It's demand and supply
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA With all due respect sir why blaming not the big business, even Trump tower have illegal workers till recently. Why leaving those cooperate greed out and going after poor people
@vickilb99 @SarahPalinUSA 70% of the illegal don't cross the Mexico border they come legally and overstay
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA Do we forget 70% of illegals are those who overstay?
@koolisland @SarahPalinUSA Wondering why a combat vet can't get a government grant unless he is disabled and why we reservist are forgotten after combat. I bet u never put on uniform thats why u want the vet to wait till the border is secure
@koolisland @SarahPalinUSA Are u even listening to yourself, so the we the people who put our lives in danger should come last after  when all the dust settle
@vickilb99 @SarahPalinUSA All u can say hopefully. When that borders will be fully secure to think about us. Is it not gonna be too be late. I wish we have same attention like the borders wall
@JayLove79179300 @SarahPalinUSA How about funding veteran health care? We are forgotten ones, after service no one gives rats about us. It's all politic same same
@SarahPalinUSA Why they don't drop bomb to help war veterans, why they don't drop to fund VA. We are the forgotten ones after the service
@Jim_Jordan But nothing for the veterans, lot of veterans are homeless, zero bill to deal with veterans with all kind of problem after deployment

@ibjis where are our imams, are they with their pocket or with the people
Why Gamo  at state house??? Our state house is not build for a Gamo where does so called religious people can come spend the nite there
Jammeh should understand our state house is not a religious lounge where Imams can come a spend the nite there. It's belongs to the people
The mosque at the state house need to go period. Separation of mosques and the state. Gambia belong to every religious beliefs
@TheJamaJack I don't support Gamo idea at state house we should separate religious from the state

@TheJamaJack true and I understand your view on that and I respect the work u doing but this time my tribe is been target by a killer

Instead of expressing condolence to lost family members on 911  "Ex-VP Cheney" takes another opportunity of blaming someone else #Deplorable

@VibeCole @CharleyVox The Trump pushback on "basket of deplorables" fails because Trump leads a deplorable racist movement, Birtherism.

@CharleyVox @chelliehylton f I were you, I would re-evaluate your talking points because right now, they are a failure.
@CharleyVox @chelliehylton She is absolutely correct, but I think it is about 75-80 % of Trump supporters who belong in the deplorable baske
@CharleyVox @chelliehylton Trump is deplorable, his supporters are deplorable, the GOP is deplorable, and the media is deplorable.

Seriously Republicans??	The best person you could find to call Hillary "mentally impaired" was Louie Gohmert??..

@JSpaPatriot @nytimes yeah blame it on him and immigration typical conservative ideology
Trump is either too stupid to know that he is being played by Putin and the Russians or he is indeed working with them.  Am going with both
Donald Trump is such an egomaniac that all it takes to get him to side with Vladimir Putin is a some shallow praise and a little flattery.
Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he's unfit to be our Commander-in-Chief.
Donald Trump is not presidential material and is a pathological narcissistic liar. He is not prepared to be president

There has always been a strain of feminism that measures success as being able to behave like the biggest male assholes.
Pastor Mark Burns along with the rest of the Trump campaign are nothing but liars and frauds. I knew something was up with this Pastor.
Trump and the Truth is like a decorative windmill. They spin &amp; spin &amp; spin &amp; have no  value.

@bgnewman3 @k_mcq he fail to understand America belongs to every race.and white alone will not make him win. Look at his polls in minorities
@bgnewman3 @k_mcq deep in his heart
@bgnewman3 @k_mcq This entire speech is a rich, white man telling a bunch of poor white people that poor brown people are the problem.
@bgnewman3 @k_mcq yes I have the proof
@k_mcq This man is a crazy racist monster and he must be destroyed in November, so no one like him will ever rise again in America. #TrumpAZ
Trump supporters r proof why more Americans need access 2 a good education. "It's terrible, terrible - believe me."
Fox News Poll: 77% believe there should be a system to legalize those here illegally including 66% of GOP.	Only 19% agree with Trump. Wow.
@lindylou_german @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump thank god almighty I don't watch Fox News am smarter and well inform than that
how in the world can trump NOT ASK WHO PAYS FOR THE WALL his supporters are going to be pissed.
I am not happy that this meeting is in private. We are paying for the security. We have right to hear the converstation.
Trump's going there (some say) to really find out if they have a better recipe for the taco bowls currently being served at Trump hotels.
Jan Brewer Is Just As Clueless As Trump Is When Comes To Immigration. Trump So Called "Change" Doesn't Hold Water.
Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans..  I'm just an American.. if you want to be taken seriously lose the hyphen.
I cannot figure how out how Arizona has survived Jan Brewer, Sheriff A-hole and McCain
Jan Brewer, blah blah blah, u want the federal government to protect you but you want smaller government? What do u really want?
Jan Brewer had NO idea NET immigration between US &amp; Mex. is ZERO - &amp; she was Gov of Arizona. Why are Trump people SO FREAKING ILL INFORMED?
Trump followers now see what a phony trump is. They thought he was on their side. Now they saw him schmooze Mexican Pres like he did them.

@DagnyDelinquent @Early__May we the black knows the code language
@ByaWomansHand @ConiamSara @Early__May @FoxNewsInsider @JamilSmith if he is targeting them he should go and face them not 1hr away

@seanhannity @brianstelter Donald Trump is not in Milwaukee. He's in West Bend. Huge difference.
@seanhannity @brianstelter Trump chooses West Bend WI where whites are 98.4% of the pop, to appeal to African Americans. Makes as much sense
@seanhannity @brianstelter Does Trump think we're in Milwaukee? Is that why he's giving a speech about black issues to an all-white audience

Mr. Trump, it's not the voters it's you that keep "shooting yourself in the foot" when you make big mistakes campaigning!😁
I was a trump supporter in the beginning. But the more he opens his mouth, the stupider he sounds and the more he pisses people off.
Donald, I have some news for you. The GOP is done with you. They will be kicking you out of their party any day now.
Donald J. Trump says he "will never, ever forgive" voters if he loses the election.
Trump is sounding desperate now.	Very sad and upset because of having little or no hope : feeling or showing despair

America been exporting its so called "democracy" to other countries through its war of terror. Yet democracy doesn't have a place in US.
Pat Buchanan was instrumental in the Nixon administration in implementing the racist 'Southern Strategy'!!

@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump but does illegal immigrants are here now so what are we going to do with them?
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump he appointed Ombarosa to be his  minorities outreach coordinator who 90 percent of black hate her
@CarlAlpine @OutnumberedFNC can someone remind u that not everyone can enroll in there.
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump but not for trump and his minorities outreach program is death not working
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I know that but since then we never have immigration reform
@davebucknut she will show Americans her tax returns today can trump do same
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump u know I know he cannot win elections without minorities vote. Romney have 64% white still lose
@davebucknut let him show us his tax returns and u will message me with a surprise
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump what did Reagan said about immigration and Muslim and what did trump approach towards them ?
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump but Reagan approach is way different from trump
@davebucknut he is cheating on American for cheap labor that's part of reason he don't want us to see his tax returns
@davebucknut but what did he said about immigrants
@davebucknut are they not here work right now all does people are working
@davebucknut then why he is bring H1B people to work for him. Remember he is a businessman and illegal immigrants is a big thing for them
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump remember he is not a politician so he don't know how to talk to general population
@davebucknut because we are a country of immigrants and we have a heart to feel the pain of people suffering and a country of Christianity
@davebucknut most of them will pay any amount as long as they have chance to stay
@davebucknut now we agreed on something let check all of them and let them follow the law as the rest but deporting them will never happen
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump but he would give Clinton hard time than trump
@davebucknut can pls go to any prison and see for yourself not what u hear from does anti immigrants people
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump but u know trump gonna lose to Clinton
@davebucknut so why can't we give the rest same chance your wife got let do background check on them
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump to be honest Trump is a weak candidate if it's Kasich it's will be different
@davebucknut are does killing done by immigrants?
@davebucknut I deal with immigrants and I know lot about immigration law ones u overstay u are illegal
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump hahhahaha u making me laugh I like your political maturity
@davebucknut pls don't bring that as u know that immigrants committed less crime than natural born like u and me go to New York, Chicago
@davebucknut so what's you Options on them because u know and I know we can't deport them we all knows that, so what's your plan for them?
@davebucknut so why not we give them legal papers so they can't also pay tax and contribute more to the society
@davebucknut why u think only Latinos are illegal
@davebucknut I don't speak Spanish born and raised in the Bronx New York and 12 yrs in the army
@davebucknut we murder each other more than immigrants. Look at FBI data immigrants communities have lowest crime rate
@davebucknut not temporary and the visa she came with disqualified her to work
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump you think so? Remember more republican come against him and democrat against her
@terri3464 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump so why not when the polls are against him they are media cook and rigged
@davebucknut I never hate I can disagree and agree but I never never hate my fellow human I don't have that kind of heart
@davebucknut illegal immigrants

@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash Stacey was one of the welfare queen
@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash it's not him but the congress as they approve every spending
@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash white people received more welfare than blacks
@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash cause why who? And how do we get into that debt
@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash she can't even bring her own people to trump camp. Look at his numbers in black communities
@davebucknut @edwardpalfy @REALStaceyDash to who she is goddess

@edwardpalfy @davebucknut @REALStaceyDash half of us wish to achieve what she does at age of 20

@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter to my understanding u have no clue how immigration system work u are ignorant on that
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter how do someone become legal immigrant
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter if trump is serious about immigration why all his wives are imported
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter she came here as visitor on 1998 over stay she was illegal for over 10yrs
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter why can't we give same chance to the rest so they can also pay tax
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter it's just 2005 she become legal so what's past in there
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter ok why not give same chance to the other to do same
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter the reason it matters is because of Trump's own extremely strict on immigration deportations.
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter am not for her or trump as both of them are loser am an independent

@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter she is the one who said what kind of visa she came with
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter yes I know what kind of visa she come with as she said it
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter we talking about her it's her husband who champion anti immigration while  he married one
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter because I work with immigrant I know every kind of visa I work with Catholic service
@AmberLMcGee98 @AstoriaMannion @AnnCoulter trump playing a game but he knows his wife is an illegal alien and she break all the laws
