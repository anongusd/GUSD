This is why I‚Äôve been warning about the potential privacy downsides of their plan to integrate messaging on Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. Zuckerberg says they‚Äôre doing it to bring encryption across services. But it will ultimately allow Facebook to connect your identities.
Facebook wonders why people don‚Äôt trust them. It‚Äôs because of things like this: Two-factor authentication, which requires a phone number, is something Facebook has recommended as a safety feature. Now they‚Äôre using the phone number for other purposes. https://t.co/K8X2paFLUG

Sandberg frames FB problems as partially PR problems.	"We need to tell our story better," Sandberg says. The person who self-diagnosed her cancer "saved her life. Pretty incredible stuff. And so we're working hard to prevent the bad, but also to let the good stories be told."

Side benefit of encryption and ephemeral messaging for Facebook, or as Zuckerberg calls them, "privacy-first products" -- They don't really have to police the content if it's end-to-end encrypted!

Zuckerberg touts that he will be investing in Instagram shopping, messaging, encryption by default. He says Portal has done "better than expected" but doesn't give any numbers.
IMO, it shows that size = power = $$. Nobody else has the data Facebook has on its users -- so why would advertisers spend their money on something less effective? No other social network has everyone on it, so where can consumers go that's as useful? Doesn't necessarily = love.
Just off the phone with @RichBTIG: 	``It's hard to get people to stop using something they love... Most of Facebook's advertisers have no other place to go with a return on investment this good. This is clear proof."
Growth in the US and Europe. That's a big deal. Advertisers and investors were concerned that these markets had peaked. https://t.co/OF7xKkofp6 https://t.co/maUUjCxjYP
Facebook estimates that around 2.7 billion people now use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger monthly, 2 billion daily. I have a feeling that's the main user number they'll report in the future, as these services get more integrated and as the main app's growth slows.
Earnings also beat by a lot, $2.38 a share, versus the $2.18 per share estimated. That's $6.9 billion in profit.
Big revenue beat for Facebook: $16.91 billion, compared to the $16.39 billion analysts estimated. Shares way up.

@makriese Their privacy argument for doing this: encrypted messaging ‚Äúeasier‚Äù across apps	Outcome of the same move: Facebook knows more about which accounts are yours
And it will be even less clear to the consumer what‚Äôs happening because as the underlying messaging infrastructure becomes the same, they will still feel like they are using separate-branded services.
So the move they are saying will increase privacy, adding encryption across services, also serves to make it clearer to Facebook (and therefore advertising targeting) who is who, in the real world

Zuckerberg's New Year's Resolution: "to host a series of public discussions about the future of technology in society -- the opportunities, the challenges, the hopes, and the anxieties." https://t.co/4nxxuqVVd4
@lexistentiaI Agreed, not a new issue -- the difference is that people who previously welcomed the Facebook app are now wary of it.
Facebook won't say how many deals it has like this. It's hard for consumers to find information about them. Other companies, incl Amazon and Twitter, have pre-install deals too, but Facebook is the one spooking people. Facebook says it doesn't collect app data if you "disable."
These kind of pre-install deals have gone on for years and make Facebook a native, permanent app on some Androids, not just Samsung. Users recently started speaking out about how uncomfortable it makes them, some telling me they'd buy an iPhone just for the option to delete FB.

@Marketstuff99 Can only speak to Bloomberg practices... we brief the company on what we're about to report before we report it, so they have an opportunity to clear things up/say what they need to say pre-publication. If that system fails, we correct the story post-publication.
@Marketstuff99 I do think it's super important to explain to readers how things work technically, and I rely on a network of sources inside and outside the company to help me understand them. If you ever find something dumb in my reporting, tell me!
Companies like Facebook grow from mere ideas into what they are today, developing a strong culture of trying to prove the nonbelievers wrong, motivated by competition + growth. So it's appealing to think in terms of media vs FB, but won't get the company closer to a solution.
The reason is actually a lot simpler. It's that Facebook is powerful now, and it's a reporter's job to keep track of whether FB is delivering on its promises. Stories may not always be perfectly nuanced. That's where FB can help w/ transparency + accuracy about how its biz works.
Other theories I hear from FB employees:	- That reporters are being hard on FB for the clicks	- That the media is trying to shift blame for its own role in 2016 election	- That the media is retaliating for Facebook disrupting their business model 	 https://t.co/voekAkOCX7

Both of these things are fascinating, but especially the second. How will Facebook find people the public will see as neutral/unbiased/fair globally? Will Facebook pay them? Who decides what gets escalated to them? How transparent will the process be? So many questions.

Zuckerberg says "we've changed our services to encourage meaningful social interactions rather than passive consumption." He frames it as doing the right thing even if it hurts engagement. But there are other reasons why engagement has declined... https://t.co/I6btgolHsv

When I talk to people who deleted their Facebook because privacy, THIS is the discomfort that comes up most. Not ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt figure out my sharing settings,‚Äù not ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want FB to sell my data.‚Äù Mostly: ‚ÄúFacebook knows too much about me and it‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù
There are many components of privacy. Facebook talks most about privacy settings (what you share with the public vs smaller circles) and sharing data with third parties. What about the data we share with Facebook? Can we decide what we don‚Äôt want Facebook to know about us?
Saying what doesn‚Äôt happen isn‚Äôt as educational as saying what does. FB sells access to you based on your data. FB‚Äôs business is valuable only because it controls the data. ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt sell data‚Äù distracts from a bigger discomfort: that FB collects too much. https://t.co/vHwvIYpxfL

Zuckerberg makes the case that while we're focusing on the anti-competitive action here etc, we could probably also focus on the fact that limiting developer access to data was what the public wanted FB to do for privacy reasons. https://t.co/HzhJXuJuPX
Facebook's response: "The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context."	They stopped restricting competitors from using the platform as it was an "out-of-date policy" 	https://t.co/TFZMjpGCrO
Why do these emails matter? We expect a business to be competitive right? 	Well, now that Facebook is incredibly globally powerful, there's a risk lawmakers will increase anti-trust scrutiny. How FB deals with competitors is very interesting to them. https://t.co/y9uucgFGfb
Documents show Zuckerberg personally reviewed a small list of strategic competitors that were not allowed to use Facebook to grow in certain ways without his sign-off https://t.co/Ma3CJTJqgY
An update that would continuously provide Facebook your Android text and call log history: 	"This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it." https://t.co/3CmxwISz7L
This is why Facebook ultimately didn't charge developers for access to user data.

He goes on to say they'll enforce policies more strongly w/ competitors. https://t.co/0RK9bouqQE

@guyro @CaseyNewton @Techmeme But it already has been disbanded, according to Facebook. The company told me it‚Äôs no longer operational and that FB is still evaluating what to do for future elections (which may be similar, may not.) Meanwhile, strategic response can handle crises. not true?
@pujalords We‚Äôre in agreement
@pujalords Sandberg does encourage a ‚Äúbad news first‚Äù culture... she is always asking employees to have ‚Äúhard conversations.‚Äù It‚Äôs her reaction to bad news that people fear.
Remember Facebook‚Äôs election War Room, which it showed off to dozens of reporters?	It‚Äôs already disbanded.	The ‚Äústrategic response‚Äù team is the more permanent solution, Facebook says.	https://t.co/7oLhuAVtWB
Sandberg is working on getting new perspectives in her orbit. After Cambridge Analytica, she created the ‚Äústrategic response‚Äù team, which meets her every Friday at 10:30 to tell her about the most pressing crises, during which she can decide or elevate the problem to Zuckerberg. https://t.co/DVnt4I0Tr6
Employees were also concerned about Sandberg playing favorites, to the extent that there‚Äôs a term for them internally: FOS, for ‚ÄúFriend of Sheryl.‚Äù They protect her, she protects them. The memo last week by Elliot Schrage was leaked in part to take the heat off Sandberg.
Ahead of Facebook‚Äôs first congressional hearings in 2017, Sandberg made a trip to DC against the warning of staff, thinking she could make a difference with messaging, sources said. It didn‚Äôt work. https://t.co/AXhysuBhKq
Sandberg is incredibly prepared for all things messaging. Before Davos her team puts together materials on who she might meet and how she should strategically frame her conversations. Employees wondered, where was that level of proactive planning on elections, privacy, etc?

Sheryl Sandberg is a very important partner at the company, Zuckerberg says and "I hope we work together for decades more to come."

Read it all. Esp. for the boardroom stuff: 	Bowles "grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes."
"Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner."
Some reporting gems: "Mr. Cook‚Äôs criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple‚Äôs."
this is a great behind-the-scenes effort by NYT, which sheds light on how unwilling Facebook executives were to face their problems, until they absolutely had to -- and even then, how they worked to massage public perception https://t.co/cksFMfqvmv

Despite increased investment by Facebook to find this kind of activity, federal authorities were the ones that ultimately alerted the company about the latest potential threat from Russia.

Zuckerberg says that they've been "getting better and better" at solving issues like fake accounts, election interference, etc. and that by the end of next year, they'll be "dialed in" to the problem at a higher level. "Even at that point, we're not going to be perfect."
Zuckerberg said in the past that the company rate-limited how much video people could watch passively, because he thought that Facebook is about social interaction, not about passively watching videos. Now he thinks they have the formula right, and can let people watch more.
Shares fell after Zuckerberg said that as user activity moves to video and "stories"/ephemeral sharing, which it doesn't monetize well yet, the company will see slowdown in revenue growth, and 2019 will be another "investment year" as they build that out.
Zuckerberg points out that Watch and IGTV are still "well behind YouTube which is our primary competitor in this space, but they're growing quickly" and as people use more video, it will replace social interactions that monetize better. He never talks about competitors like this.
"Explore is already 20 percent of the time people spend on Instagram, but unlike Feed we haven't built any ads on it yet. So that's an opportunity."

Super interesting call so far. Zuckerberg says he thinks "stories" will eventually be bigger than feed, even if it grew slower on Facebook than he hoped. Now it's ramping up. Revenue growth will slow down while they figure out "stories" ads.

@RichBTIG I'm not -- I'm just looking at the change in the user base number that's actually disclosed. Twitter DAUs may be up, but if they're still disclosing just the percentage change, it's not useful IMO.
Also Twitter is profitable and a more mature business. Snapchat needs to keep growing in order to convince advertisers they should start spending there (since there are still many advertisers who don't, or who see Snap as just for fun creative experiments) https://t.co/tHTE4bqdJX
The same thing happened at Twitter (user base decline, revenue beat estimate) and that stock went way up and Snap stock is declining. Why? TWTR user decline is because the company is cleaning up bots, etc. Snap's is because fewer real people are signing in, especially on Android.
Revenue beat estimates, for $297.7 million compared to the estimated 283.4 million, and the loss is 12 cents, compared to the estimated 14 cents
Snapchat‚Äôs user base is officially shrinking. The company again reported a decline in daily users, to 186 million, and said it predicts a decline in the fourth quarter too.	Q1: 191M	Q2: 188M	Q3: 186M	Q4: another decline predicted

To clarify, it's still true that there won't be ads actually running ON the Portal. But data from Portal (length of calls, frequency of calls) could help target ads on other FB properties, like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger.
Another thing to add, as I'm looking back through my transcript of our interview with the same folks: The data about who you talk to on Portal will help feed ordering of your news feed. It will send Facebook (and apparently advertisers) strong signals about who you're closest to.
Facebook reaches out to @KurtWagner8 to change what they said about using Portal data for ad targeting. They will. https://t.co/KFCYrEhl31	Portal is built on Messenger so all the things that apply to data collection on Messenger seem to apply here.

One thing that will make their enormous task easier to manage: Facebook has been developing relationships with the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors, who can help escalate problems to third-party fact checkers.
@ShiraOvide @dseetharaman @RMac18 YES!! I have a long list of examples of Facebook saying something is "not allowed" -- or that Facebook is "no place for" -- things that are allowed/in place on Facebook. It's a policy, not a guarantee.
@dseetharaman @RMac18 It's in the "coordinating harm" section https://t.co/rZJBohjIXJ	But I also don't remember when it started!
Facebook's blog post now out: https://t.co/WfZdBUU9DU	Still, it's hard for me to imagine that the network of a few third-party fact-checkers would be able to find/rate misinformation on ~100K U.S. polling places. Like putting out a forest fire with buckets of water. https://t.co/dDauuSO302
@RMac18 That was apparently a policy before the 2016 election happened (but obviously wasn't enough to stop things like the text-to-vote misinformation)
Other voter suppression, like falsely saying there are long lines or violence at polling places, will be fact-checked and down-ranked, not banned.
Just off the phone with Facebook, have a little clarification:	The company already banned misinformation on dates, times and locations for voting.	Now ban extends to false methods of voting (like falsely saying you can vote by text) and false info on whether your vote will count.
Facebook is going to ban all misinformation about voting/how to vote, @josephmenn reports. There was a lot of that in the last election (on Twitter, too, with people falsely saying you could text to vote in the US) and it came under scrutiny in Congress https://t.co/nsKoPGC8Kv

Was there tension? "Think about like when you leave anything, there are reasons for leaving. nobody ever leaves a job because everything's awesome,'' Systrom says. ``But in this case there are no hard feelings at all.''
``It didn't feel done by any stretch of the imagination but it felt like it was in orbit, and if we let go and let others take it, it would continue to do very well," Kevin Systrom says of leaving Instagram. For me and Mike it was all about the opportunity to do something new.
at #Wired25 @LaurenGoode tells @kevin he might be the only speaker here who's unemployed. "I'm doing okay," he says, generating laughs.	"Life is full of chapters and the question is how to make the decision to end the chapter." Never thought he'd be doing Instagram 8 years.

@dellcam @MikeIsaac @KurtWagner8 @RMac18 @JPManga @JoshConstine @mcwm @dlberes I was one of the 90M auto-logged out the day of the announcement, but no info taken.
Among the 14M who got their sensitive info scraped in the Facebook hack are all these journalists who cover Facebook/tech, according to their tweets today: @KurtWagner8 @MikeIsaac @RMac18 @JPManga @JoshConstine @mcwm @dlberes
@KenGoldsholl They got "access tokens" to people's facebook pages, which means they were able to access all the data without even logging in.
For those who have asked: I've confirmed with Facebook that the hack did affect people who used two-factor authentication.
Having your personal info stolen is very different than having a password/credit card stolen. You can change those but your life details (the stuff on your FB profile) are going to remain useful to hackers/scrapers for years.  https://t.co/YA231ypg4f https://t.co/AaKeU9caMK
And my colleague @EdLudlow asks about whether this info has been available on the dark web/if they're seeing attackers put it to use.	"We haven't seen any evidence of this being used yet," Rosen says, but emphasizes that they're continuing to work with the FBI.
I asked if there were any patterns in who the attackers were/who they were targeting.	"We are cooperating with the FBI on this matter the FBI have asked us not to discuss who may be behind this attack," Guy Rosen says.
The attack did not include Messenger, Messenger Kids, Oculus, WhatsApp, Instagram or business accounts. And no credit card numbers were visible, according to FB. They're still looking into smaller-scale hacks. Cooperating with FBI, IDC, etc.
400,000 profiles served as the attackers' gateway to the 30 million overall people that were affected. Facebook revealed that for some 14 million people, attackers were able to access sensitive information like location check-in data and recent search history.
Here's the new info: https://t.co/fPJu5VtKW8 https://t.co/bmzQ7JxyWF

The fact that Zuckerberg is reflecting now, on all of the ways Facebook can fix these problems, does not change the way Facebook grew or that the problems exist. But I still think it's helpful to hear him explaining why things are the way they are, and what's next.
Facebook has called the growth "connecting the world" and has called the blind spots the result of "optimism" about humanity. They felt they could fix problems as they came up, and that much of the bad was outweighed by the good.
Zuckerberg is no evil mastermind trying to destroy democracy. But the way Zuckerberg built Facebook empowered engineers to make decisions based on data with an eye towards growth. A lot of things were happening all at once, with little reflection, creating major blind spots.
On Zuckerberg profiles: Zuckerberg saying "we care deeply about this, too" will be unsatisfying to observers who feel that Facebook may not care deeply if the public/media didn't point out the problems and decide that Facebook was responsible for them.  https://t.co/eYlNqVcddC

Rep Lujan makes same point as Sarbanes -- that this is waste of time, that there is no conspiracy against conservatives, that the committee still hasn't done any legislation itself on election meddling or data security -- they haven't even dealt with the Equifax breach.
Rep. Welch asks if the government should come up with a clear consistent rules for all companies to follow, or whether companies should build these rules on their own.	Dorsey dodges the Q of regulation, says he's going to be sharing info and strategy with tech peers.
Rep. Sarbanes explains that this hearing is a distraction. "there's actually a list that republicans have put together of all the investigations that they've been blocking." He reads the list. But "here we are using our precious resources to feed deep state conspiracy theories."
Dorsey, on problems that don't get attention until people tweet them: "in the short term we need to do a better job at prioritizing around the reports that we see and in the longer-term we need to take the burden away from the victim of having to deal with it in the first place"
RT @business: A protester interrupts Jack Dorsey's testimony before being drowned out by "auctioneer in residence" Missouri Rep. Billy Long‚Ä¶
OMG in order to drown out a protester, congressman Billy Long temporarily became an auctioneer. He was great at it. I am impressed.
Scalise: ""i've written algorithms before so if somebody wrote an algortihm that's biased against conservatives i would hope you would find out who those people are" 	I looked up whether Scalise has written algorithms. He was a computer science major apparently.
Woops‚Äî to clarify, he was being asked specifically about whether he knew about the Amnesty International report that called Twitter a toxic place for women
Twitter is a toxic place for women -- are you aware of that? DeGette asks.	"I am aware of that," Dorsey says.
How many content moderators does Twitter employ and how much are they paid?	Jack dodges the Q. "We want to think of this not in terms of people." 	"We'll follow up with you on specific numbers."
First q from Walden hits immediately at Sec. 230 rules that limit Twitter's liability. Walden says Twitter's rules are so unclear, "it's a little like Wizard of Oz and we want to know what's going on behind the curtain." "We use signals, usually hundreds of signals" Jack says.
And now for tech hearing #2. @jack came off as genuine and thoughtful during the first hearing, especially next to Facebook's Sandberg, who is more polished. Can he keep his cool now that the topic is content moderation -- Twitter's worst subject? https://t.co/FgA5cIcrQZ

Just in time for the hearing to conclude, this happens: https://t.co/N1OCy8xDRb
@SmokefaceX it was just their response to a senator Cotton's Q! No opinions from me.
Wikileaks doesn't violate the terms of service for Twitter or Facebook, and therefore has not been banned, the companies say.
And the company response is like: Well, once we see bad things, we do stuff about it. We don't like bad stuff either.	But that's not the big question. The question is, do they know enough about what's going on on their platforms to provide transparency for users in the moment?
A big theme of this hearing: Users don't know what's happening behind the scenes. When an account is suspended, users don't know why. If something becomes popular on a network, users don't know it's because there's a coordinated campaign going on. They don't see bots vs humans.
After Sandberg talks about the company's work with third-party fact checkers, Dorsey says people on the platform do the work naturally: "we have this amazing constituency of journalists globally... and they often do a great job of calling out misinformation."
Sandberg responded that it's not good for anyone on Facebook if there's inauthentic activity. (but that's more of a user experience argument, not a business model argument)
The conversation between Kamala Harris and Sheryl Sandberg got intense. Harris made the point that if higher engagement = higher ad revenue, and contentious/misleading posts = high engagement, then the business model incentives are against fixing these problems.
the hate speech policy that allowed discrimination against black children, since "children" is not a protected class, has changed. "What that was was I think a bad policy that has been changed," Sandberg says. Has it? Don't remember Facebook changing their protected class rules.
Sandberg just used the term "alternative facts."	...
Twitter is down more than 6% as this hearing continues. Theories from @Selina_y_wang:	- The company said it's rethinking some of its business fundamentals	- The company said it can't tell difference between humans and bots	- There has been some talk of regulation at this hearing
Ads that discourage people from voting have "no place on Facebook"	Discriminatory advertising has "no place on Facebook," Sandberg says.	(my commentary here: That just means when people find it Facebook might take it down, but it does NOT mean it's not on Facebook.)
Alex Jones is now done shouting outside and is in the Dirksen hearing room, sitting silently with a furious face, and the cameras are fixated on him, waiting for him to do something disruptive.
@kenromano The hearings can be long! The chairs are old and fluffless. I get it.
Dorsey says it's very difficult to let users know for sure if they're seeing tweets from a real person or a machine. But he says "we are interested in it and we're going to do something along those lines," maybe for tweets from the API.
Sandberg calls for more tips sharing. "the faster we can collaborate, the faster we share those tips with each other, the stronger our collective defense will be" https://t.co/vUul2lnzNy
Sandberg's start is very Sandbergian: giving specific examples of small businesses that thrived on Facebook and people who let each other know they were safe in a natural disaster. It's the whole "Facebook is overall a force for good" argument
Dorsey says his parents are "proud of me, proud of Twitter, and proud of what made it all possible." Twitter is a positive experience for his mom and dad. He's making this testimony very personal.
Dorsey: "I'm someone of very few words and typically very shy" but understand the importance of speaking out now. Reads something he wrote himself about how it's great to have a "simple, free and open exchange" but not proud that it's been "weaponized"
Sandberg and Dorsey were just officially sworn in. I don't think that happened for Zuckerberg. It's not well-advised to lie either way, but it's a great photo opp.
Both Burr and Warner spent a large chunk of opening statements w/ disappointment that Google isn't here working on this. Warner thanks FB &amp; TWTR for work so far: "the era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end. where we go from here though is an open question.

Lots of people telling me they had no idea that sharing their contacts with a developer meant sharing all the data fields in contacts. (home addresses, thumbnail pics, notes...)	People put a lot of trust in companies to make sure that data collection/transfer doesn't go too far.

@SamShetabi No, I mean the notes section of Contacts. When people fill in information about you in their Contacts, there‚Äôs an option to add extra info in the Notes section that doesn‚Äôt fit the other fields. Some people add sensitive info that they don‚Äôt think anyone else will ever see.
When you share contacts permissions with a developer you either give all or nothing. Here‚Äôs what I want:	- Apple should make it default to just sharing people‚Äôs phone # and email w/ apps. 	- you should be able to restrict certain names (a doctor‚Äôs patients, lawyer‚Äôs clients, etc)

I'm sorry, i mean a PROTEST of the Unite the Right event.

Is it Russia? ``we do not have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind this,'' said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy. ``These accounts have engaged in some similar activity and in some cases have connected with known IRA accounts.''
Facebook says these actors coordinated about 30 real-life events over the last year. The company isn't giving details on those events since it's still assessing them/investigating the threat.
Full Facebook blog post about it here https://t.co/clFbeP71Iy		And our story, which will be updated, here: https://t.co/si7icW0q1q
Here's how far the ongoing influence campaign spread: https://t.co/F8AtE5S3Xp
These accounts promoted the Unite the Right event in Washington next week, enlisting support from real people. Facebook wanted to let the public know in part before this protest happened. https://t.co/DPtBKYkDru
Facebook giving more detail now. Says these bad actors were a lot better at covering their tracks than the Russian IRA has been in the past, so they don't know who is coordinating this. They identified 8 pages, 17 FB profiles and 7 Instagram accounts as part of the campaign.
Facebook has found ongoing evidence of an effort to influence the 2018 midterms, the company confirms to me. They plan to give the public more information about it today. Here's NYT report: https://t.co/SgxE9LToM1
@cwarzel I agree that the way it's covered matters, which is why it's important that journalists don't frame the stock drop/slower sales growth and narrower margins for FB as solely related to FB trying to clean up its act. it's actually mostly not because of that. https://t.co/xwJxFGOGUi
Here it is, spelled out in Facebook's SEC filing, the biggest risks to Facebook's future. Note that safety and security spending is not the main concern. It's mostly about 	1. running out of people to add to Facebook	2. investing in new business models that are less certain https://t.co/LbXZnJQkB6
@sukienniko @fmanjoo Well, investors certainly expected Facebook to maintain consistent growth. When Facebook told them they wouldn't, that's when they started to sell. The company has a lot of other growth areas (chat apps, VR..) but none of them as predictable or proven as news feed ads.

@itsandrewjude The reaction isn't this big because of one missed quarter. It's because the company warned that longer-term, revenue growth is going to be slower and expenses are going to be higher.
@decryptsea you're right, it makes it sound like that part is the sacrifice. But Facebook made choices to spend on not just that, but hardware, video content, expansion in AI, etc. Margins aren't just lower because they're spending to fix. They're spending to grow.
You guys. Facebook's big drop is not a reckoning for its societal impact.	That's only part of the story.	The main thing FB has to contend with is that its days of easy growth are over. 	Future $$ is going to come from more experimental, expensive areas.	https://t.co/6QQXwRUzer

@ShiraOvide I enjoyed your "currency headwinds" line and I think I haven't heard that phrase as often since my days covering IBM
@chafkin Thanks Max :)
Down 23% now. I just want to emphasize, Facebook has NEVER fallen this much in response to an earnings report. If this change holds tomorrow, it'll be the biggest post-earnings decline ever
Facebook shares are down now more than 20 percent. 		Another thing investors worry about:	"Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid 30s on a percentage basis."
What's driving that deceleration in revenue? 	CFO says:	1. Currency headwinds	2. focus on promoting new kinds of sharing like "stories"	3. giving people more choices about their privacy
Facebook says that total revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate. "We expect our revenue growth rates to decline by high single digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both q3 and q4" CFO Wehner says.

@sheeraf That'd be great! Without more transparency on that topic, every single page owner is going to think Facebook is down-ranking them, even if they're not. Would love to also know which news sites people rank as "trustworthy."
.@sheeraf and I both tried to understand whether they would give more info around down-ranking of pages for false news. Do the pages know if they've been down-ranked? How much are they affected? They said pages are alerted when their pieces of content are marked false. But ??
I asked a Q about whether they have improved their system to alert fact checkers about fake news, which, last I checked, was an overwhelming list of links with not a lot of logic. FB said they have gotten better at grouping related misinfo for them but a lot of work still to do.
Facebook just held a conference call with reporters which only gleaned new information if you read between the lines on answers. One person asked if they found any Russia-type threats ahead of midterms, they said they're looking and when they find will tell the gov first. So no?

On nonprofits ads: "We‚Äôre not saying all these things are political we just chose to be as inclusive as possible. We‚Äôre not labeling them political ads, we‚Äôre just being as transparent as possible. It gets hard to draw those lines. Saying this is a nonprofit and this isn‚Äôt."
Sheryl Sandberg says putting news in the political ad archive was a very hard decision. "We decided that our goal is transparency. So we are just erring on the side of being more transparent."	Publishers have argued that the move confuses people about what is news vs advocacy

It's worth noting that Apple has criticized Facebook for FB's privacy lapses, which involved a developer gathering friend info from users (allowed at the time) and then sharing with a third party (not allowed at the time). Apple CEO Tim Cook has called privacy a human right.
The developer gets this info in a way that is untracked by Apple. If users turn off a developers' access to contacts info, it just turns off the data faucet, but it doesn't delete what a developer already has. https://t.co/FxNmN4rkFc
Consumers might not fully understand what happens when they share contacts with a developer. The developer can get anything they've stored about those contacts, not just phone numbers. It's job, home address, thumbnail pic, creation &amp; modification date of contact, etc.

@FistfulOfUX Overall usage has really grown! Now they have 800+ people using Instagram monthly, will probably hit 1 billion this year. But it‚Äôs still possible there are people quitting. Just more people joining.
@sa_lil They said they don‚Äôt treat content from influencers any differently than content from friends and family, it‚Äôs all ordered based on the signals for how you interact with it. So if someone comments/likes posts from a certain influencer a lot they‚Äôll probably see them
@richardkendall I think the general solution for capturing things in the moment, chronologically, is Instagram stories, but of course that‚Äôs ephemeral...
@sa_lil They mentioned compelling content, hashtags, follow suggestions, explore... there isn‚Äôt a mechanism for re-sharing posts in feed, but people sometimes DM them to new audiences. (Influencers tell me bots work! Instagram likely doesn‚Äôt like that answer.)
@zackhargett I actually don't know the answer to that one! Copying @juliangutman in case he can help.
@richardkendall They said that they try to diversify the feed, so their preference is to not have you see several posts from the same person in a row. They said that behavior is less frequent now that people post photos all at once in "carousel" format. But yes, live posting doesn't really work.
@Jimmy_Kay_ sponsored posts on Instagram are kinda like they are on Facebook... Instagram is slowly increasing their frequency, and some users may see more frequent ads than others. Also starting to show more frequent ads in insta stories
@cicadaqueen They said that after the algorithm, engagement is way up. So yes, it makes more sense for business to keep it that way. They also say that in reverse chron, people were missing 50% of their friends/family stories. Now they see 90%. But they wouldn't say how they defined that.
@mattprescott Yeah, they would likely tell you to follow more people, or check out the "explore" feed. But I don't follow a lot of celebrities/artists/etc, I like Instagram being about my friends. So I just settle for less content.
@MarceloPLima they recently created a mute function! https://t.co/ncAIsJyv7k But not a snooze, or a "see less." They said they wanted to build it in a way that people would know exactly what they were/weren't getting.
@brownawell People who log in less often will see older posts. The main signals for the feed are interest, timeliness and relationship, those signals are affected by frequency, following and usage. They don't want you to miss your friend's engagement if you didn't log in when it happened.
I'll tell you my main Q: Has the popularity of stories led to a decrease in posts to the main feed?	Their answer: Sorry, we don't break that down. Stories is very popular and engagement for the app overall is up.
@RichBTIG So the three main signals for the feed are interest, timeliness and relationship. They adjust the weighting for these signals based on three other factors: frequency, following and usage. So someone who logs in only once a week or so will see older posts.
@CloudBackup__ Good question. For the last few months, after you're done going through the posts that you follow, Instagram will show you posts you might be interested in. The company says they only do this when you're out of content. Is it that or something else?

My recap: https://t.co/WazYWooeIy
Zuckerberg says, about all of the negative news and critique, "I don't agree with all of it but I think some of it is very fair." He wants FB to be a company seen as taking responsibility first, before pushing that onto its users, "as part of the culture we want to build here."
Why is Facebook always on the defensive? one shareholder asks	"The media just keeps punching Facebook as if it‚Äôs all Facebook‚Äôs fault, which, I don‚Äôt think it is." Suggests more proactive marketing/training.
FB says that just because the board/Zuckerberg voted down all shareholder proposals doesn't mean they don't agree with the ideas. They just don't think it's the right way to implement solutions. A shareholder interrupts and says that's not enough -- engage with your investors.
A q on housing. Facebook says about half the people coming to their Menlo Park HQ aren't coming in cars. It's buses, and then other possible solutions. The Dumbarton corridor, maybe even ferries, that they could invest in. Genentech and Google are thinking the same way.
Zuckerberg says they've been proactively asking people if they want the ads they're served to be informed by other websites and apps they use. "The vast majority say yes," he says. Data collection = better ads = what people want,  he says.
Facebook gets asked about diversity of ideas -- namely, can they please hire more conservatives to protect against bias?	Zuckerberg says he understands the concerns but "I don't think the concerns are necessarily founded." FB is moderated by people following strict guidelines.
The company says they agree with him on diversity and will be making sure to look at diverse candidates for all board member appointments going forward.
Lots of applause in the room. Moving now to Q&amp;A. People get one minute per question. Jesse Jackson is first (on diversity and on elections)
"we're also very focused on being more transparent," Zuckerberg says, after voting down a couple shareholder proposals to increase transparency.
Zuckerberg starts out by talking about all the good Facebook has done. Then says "we didn't do enough to be proactive about how people can abuse these tools as well" and "need to take a broader view of our responsibility." He has said that like 46 times in the last 2 mos.
A fiery meeting so far. Someone already kicked out for interrupting. "Facebook‚Äôs poor stewardship of user data is tantamount to a human rights violation," one investor says. "Scandal is not good for the company's bottom line," another says.

UK official who REALLY wants to interrogate Zuckerberg calls it a "missed opportunity" https://t.co/yHgzdKh63m
To be fair, there was about an hour of questioning and then Zuckerberg had only a few minutes to answer everything. Lots of commotion as the hearing ends with lawmakers unsatisfied about Zuckerberg not getting to their points. He said there'll be another more technical one.
Zuckerberg tries to end the hearing. "You asked for this format for a reason," one of the members says, implying that he wanted to dodge questions.
Zuckerberg totally dodged the Q about whether non-users can opt about Facebook tracking.  "On the security side we think it's important for our community... Were there any other themes?" Changes subject to whether there were any other Cambridge Analyticas.
"I can commit to you here today that we have never and will not make decisions about what content is allowed or how we do ranking on the basis of a political orientation," Zuckerberg says.
He also gave the same stat he gave Congress, that the average person has 8 apps they use to communicate with friends and family. Neglects to mention how many of them are owned by Facebook. (Also not sure where that stat is from)
Zuckerberg answers the monopoly question in part by saying that Facebook advertising helps small businesses grow. That essentially Facebook is helping its potential future competitors by making it easy for them to buy advertising.
FINALLY Zuckerberg gets to answer questions. He starts with his most rehearsed answer, about how the company had to be reactive about what people post, but now with AI they may improve. "Back when I was in my dorm room..."
We're clearly going to get more questions than answers today. The hearing is almost an hour in, and Zuckerberg hasn't had a chance to respond to anything yet.
Member asks Zuckerberg if he'll cooperate with European antitrust authorities, to examine his books and see if Facebook is a monopoly. Should Facebook be able to have WhatsApp and Instagram?
Zuckerberg is getting all the questions first, and then he's going to answer them. Question so far on whether they should break up Facebook, whether Cambridge Analytica is the tip of the iceberg, how people without Facebook accounts opt out of Facebook tracking. Good ones.

@TippingOddsLV Yep. The entire campaign wasn't that expensive... about $100,000 which is nothing compared to what Trump and Clinton spent. https://t.co/gak2iYkZCE	But it's still evidence of a foreign power spending to influence US politics, which is why Congress/Mueller/Facebook care.

Zuckerberg just said the word "nipple" on an earnings call.		He was referring how it's so much easier for AI to detect nudity than it is for AI to detect hate speech.
Of the advertisers that pulled out with the scandal, one is already back and no meaningful change since then, Sandberg says. Overall theme of this call: FB business is not going to stop thriving, despite the problems which they are fixing.
I have heard more bragging about Instagram on this Facebook earnings call than I ever have before. So maybe read my cover story about them, and how they relate to Facebook's growth/business: https://t.co/Qa4W0LL96N
Facebook says, we're not updating this number. But Zuckerberg is focusing on "connections over consumption." We're "not really optimizing the business on time spent."
"We're proud of the ads model we built," Sandberg said. They will strengthen privacy and choice, but makes the argument that an ad-supported business model is "bridging the digital divide" by providing Facebook without charging people.
Zuckerberg starts out the call by explaining all the initiatives for security/privacy/elections. BUT he says, this won't stop Facebook from building a better product. We'll invest even more in that. Translation: this company is going to keep growing.
RT @ShiraOvide: It remains utterly bonkers that Facebook's revenue growth can re-accelerate:	2Q 2017 44.8%	3Q 47.3%	4Q: 47.3%	1Q 18: 49%

@CaseyNewton @benthompson @ShiraOvide @kevinroose Which is part of the trust problem. FB's rhetoric on "hard questions," "global community" and transparency promise quite a lot and almost invite the criticism about whether these are actually hard questions, whether the community is functional and positive, etc.
Using people's data/buying up data sets from data brokers to try to target political messages "is an ethical question, not a legal question." It's technically same as targeting messages about cars. "For many years I never questioned it," Kaiser says.
Kaiser says, imagine if Facebook's users received a type of universal basic income based on the data they provide, and how valuable it is. "Everyone could feed themselves" based on the value of their own data they create by using the Internet.

@Yolo_Tengo @khyl1n awesome! so great.

Zuckerberg says he doesn't think the company had a "legal obligation" to notify the FTC when it found out Cambridge Analytica obtained user information.
Bloomberg's summary so far:	https://t.co/uvj6xTpUpB
Did Facebook threaten to sue the Guardian before they ran their first story on Cambridge Analytica?	"Congressman, I believe there was a specific factual inaccuracy,'' Zuckerberg says
RT @WillOremus: Zuckerberg just said he's "not familiar" with the term "shadow profiles."		That is bullshit of the highest order.
Zuckerberg: "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes."	Rep Lujan makes the point that non-users have no easy way to see that data or say no.
Rep McKinley says opioids are openly sold on FB, even though zuckerberg himself says he is sad about the opioid crisis. "where's the accountability?"	Zuckerberg says even with lots of reviewers, they won't reliably be able to take stuff down fast without AI tools

This is, so far, a more difficult hearing for Zuckerberg. Rep. Eshoo from CA asked Zuckerberg if his personal data was part of the 87 million leaked. Yes, he says.
Think of that similar to how you let apps sync with your phone contacts. That was profiley data, like who your friends are, not Facebook‚Äôs secret sauce for advertisers, which is their system for targeting on your interests/politics/brands you favor/life milestones/location.
Data that developers like Kogan got was different. Facebook wanted to be your gateway to all your apps, to make them all social. So they let you share info on your friends with app developers that used ‚Äúlogin with Facebook‚Äù tool, and you could find them on the app.
@shaneoleary1 Yep, and any time congress asks a q that gets this wrong, it gives Zuckerberg an opportunity to correct them, instead of giving new information.
Here‚Äôs what Facebook does: it charges advertisers to reach you based on any of the things it knows about you from your activity. Then it tells advertisers whether/how their campaigns were successful. Facebook control of the data (not sale of it) is central to the business model.

Why doesn't zuckerberg totally spell out its privacy policies?	Most people don't want to read long legal documents, Zuckerberg says. the longer you make it the fewer people you'll reach.
first Q: "Do you know of any other instances where data was transfered to a third party in breach of facebook's  terms? if so, how many times has that happened?"	Zuckerberg: said they're investigating tens of thousands of apps to make sure. but no new info.

about #DeleteFacebook and advertiser scrutiny... "I don't think there's been any meaningful impact that we've observed. But look, it's not good, we don't want anyone to be unhappy with our services,'' Zuckerberg says
even with the audits,  "We're not going to be able to go out and find every single bad use of data, but what we can do is make it a lot harder for folks to do that going forward.  I think we will be able to uncover a large amount of bad activity that exists."
What do you do to protect your own privacy/what do you advise? "I certainly use a lot of apps. yeah I mean, I'm a power user of the Internet." he advises 2fa, changing passwords regularly...
Are you still the right person to run FB? "Yes. I think life is about learning from mistakes and figuring out what you need to do to move forward," Zuckerberg says.
.@hannahkuchler asks bold q about whether board has discussed Zuckerberg stepping down as chairman. "Not that I'm aware of," he says.
Zuckerberg says he thinks GDPR is very positive and he's going to make the same controls available for users everywhere, not just in Europe
on Zuckerberg's nov '16 comment that fake news affecting the election would be "crazy."	"What I think is clear at this point is it was too flippant -- I should never have referred to it as crazy."
"You should be able to sign into apps and share your public information easily, but anything that also shares other people's information... those should be more restricted." - Zuckerberg
Mark Zuckerberg: ``We didn't take a broad enough view of what our responsibility was and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake.... we're broadening our view of our responsibility."
Mark Zuckerberg opens his media call by talking about YouTube. "We're thinking of everyone there and everyone who is affected by the shooting."
Really important context: Facebook came to the 87 million number by adding up all the unique friends the 270,000 app users had at the time they gave permissions. It's an estimate of worst-case-scenario, not an audit https://t.co/0dxZ3irUEf
This is also huge. ‚ÄúMost people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way.‚Äù https://t.co/MqiY1LzLpS
Facebook is conducting lots of audits of old apps. But there were so many, it'll be very difficult for them to answer the Q: given how easy this was, how many other Cambridge Analytica-level cases are out there?
Just for context: Only about 270,000 people downloaded this personality quiz app. Those people gave information on their friends. That resulted in info on 87 million people, which then got passed to Cambridge Analytica.
"In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people ‚Äî mostly in the US ‚Äî may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica." https://t.co/VsoKYnzODG
Facebook clearing up its terms and data policy to make it clearer (not asking for new rights.) https://t.co/3T6VzGqlMN this was most interesting to me https://t.co/BzkvgDbDwG
So this was a question on Monday and we‚Äôve had 400 questions since then. But I wanted you to know:	https://t.co/tIx3sWHDsk

‚ÄúBoth campaigns spent heavily on Facebook between June and November of 2016,‚Äù  according to paper, citing revenue of $44M for Trump and $28M for Clinton. ‚ÄúBut Trump‚Äôs FB campaigns were more complex than Clinton‚Äôs and better leveraged FB's ability to optimize for outcomes.‚Äù
84 percent of Trump‚Äôs budget asked people on Facebook to take an action, like donating, compared with 56 percent of Clinton‚Äôs.
28% of Trump‚Äôs ad spending was tied to third-party data files on voters, and leveraged a FB tool that helped the campaign show ads to lookalike audiences. Clinton‚Äôs ads aimed for broader audiences, with only 4 percent of her Facebook spend on the lookalike tool.
Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads during the presidential campaign and rapidly tested them to spread those that generated the most Facebook engagement, according to the paper. Clinton ran 66,000 different kinds of ads in the same period.
Scoop: An internal white paper at Facebook shows in detail how Trump's campaign was better at leveraging Facebook's advertising tools than Clinton's campaign. https://t.co/gak2iY3oL6

But just want to clarify that in most cases, it‚Äôs not someone anonymously reaching out to me or @CaseyNewton or @RMac18 or anyone with a bombshell tip/memo. Understanding what‚Äôs going on at these companies is a constant conversation with folks on many sides.
This reaction shows how important it is that we protect the internal people who want to share context about how their companies make decisions, as we work to help the public understand. Talk to me on encrypted messaging. Reach out via DM or email, and then move somewhere safer.
I think it‚Äôs worth explaining something from the journalist side. Most scoops don‚Äôt come from ‚Äúleaks.‚Äù Our jobs would be easier if they did. They come from relationships, the right questions, trust... and from people who want to push their companies to be better.

Facebook says "we don't allow it on the platform/it's against our policies" a lot. But not allowing implies blocking. These ads are purchased via FB's ad-buying site without much intervention. That's why they ask users to report bad ads later for takedown. https://t.co/E5p3LEC6dj

@christiankinney Totally. I do think that whenever problems occur with ads on social, it's a good opportunity to help explain how it works. Just because ads are against an app's rules doesn't mean the company does a good job preventing them from running. Facebook has the same issue.
Side note: this incident again reveals general misunderstanding about how self-serve ads on social work. Snap didn't design/pay for this ad, as Rihanna said. An advertiser ran it through Snap's automated system. And they approved it, which is bad. But not the same as making it.

Evan Spiegel says he likes to have an executive team that operates "just below the boil."	"Like when you heat water, and it's really fucking hot, but it's just below the boil"	Things are intense, but there's also calm, execution, that allows people to work together.
Spiegel said in the beginning of the business, they just focused on the US and Europe in order to get the business to a place where it was sustainable. Now that it seems like it's going strong, "we're much more willing to invest globally."
As he looks towards the future product development, he's looking to "remove friction" from friend communication. If you go for a run, your friends can tell if they look at your Bitmoji on the Snap Map, you don't even have to snap it. More like that.
He was explaining how some of the complaints validate the changes (he's speaking at this Goldman Sachs conference).	Basically, redesign is here to stay, of course.
Evan Spiegel explaining some complaints post-Snapchat redesign: "People are saying `I used to feel like this celebrity was my friend and now they're not my friend anymore.' Exactly. They're not your friend."

Also, GDPR (european privacy law) could impact European daily active users, Sheryl Sandberg says
Facebook says it doesn't think the DAU decline in North America is an "ongoing trend" but that it'll be volatile still given high penetration in the region
"We expect stories are on track to overtake posts and feeds as the most     common way that people share across all social apps" Zuckerberg says
the WSJ and the NYT are examples of trustworthy sites, Zuckerberg said. "most people have confidence that they're high-quality journalists."
Facebook said public content from media etc grew too massively on FB (partially as a result of Facebook's prompting) that it was crowding out posts from friends and family.

Zuckerberg: "Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people's time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day"
Also, how will FB be measuring/benchmarking its new squishy goals for users, like "time well spent" and "meaningful" connections?	As it seems FB is willing to make big changes to its strategy, what is/isn't on the table?	How do Insta/Messenger/Whatsapp fit into revised goals?
For Facebook earnings today, people expect another quarter of record sales. The big Qs are going to come on the call. 	How do the changes to news feed actually affect engagement? 	Is Watch (+ad model) working? 	WhatsApp biz update?	Look at DAU/MAU ratio for engagement trend.

doesn't FB have an obligation to let people know if they were reached by a manipulative foreign power? FB says it's technically difficult
"How much money did you make on the legitimate ads that ran alongside the Russian propaganda?" Companies say they don't have the data.
Russian IRA paid $46,000 pre-election on FB ads, Trump and Clinton together paid upwards of $81 million, Stretch said
Twitter is asked why they don't care if Twitter users are real people. Twitter says anonymity helps people speak freely.
RT @alexstamos: Want to clear up something that came up in the Senate Intel hearing this morning: https://t.co/U1Dvf8VhdP
Also, the questions are much more focused on the broader problem of posts by Russian actors posing as Americans -- not just the ads.
"in the vast majority of cases, where we are on notice of locally illegal content, it has nothing to do with political expression."
Colin Stretch won't deny that Facebook is willing to block political criticism in countries where that's illegal
This hearing is much harsher on the tech companies, with specific qs and examples. Senators came prepared.
Sen. Feinstein: "You bear this responsibility. You created these platforms... you have to be the ones to do something about it. Or we will."
Warner: "Your first presentations were less than sufficient. Candidly, your companies know more about Americans than the US government does"
How does Twitter find bots? We're looking for anomalies, Twitter says. But bots are getting better at appearing real.

This is unusual. Twitter now has beta program that will auto-promote your tweets for $99/month https://t.co/CwX10kSIVv
But because DAU is THE thing they want to use to prove growth, why not say it? Will they eventually have to?
Twitter seems to not want to disclose this number clearly out of fear of comparison with competitors.
My best guess as to what this means: 44 percent of MAU is too high. To get real number you have to think of activity out of top-20 markets.
It is really difficult for anyone to calculate actual DAU number, a priority of the business, without some guessing https://t.co/lkI9WkG5It
@michaelpachter My best bet is, the 44% is too high and we don't want to say the actual number because it will be too easy to compare to competitors

@jandawson @ShiraOvide I'm surprised there weren't more IG questions on the call...
@alexbarinka was this chart doodling achieved on snapchat? very appropriate.
"just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google." burnn. This Q was about Facebook.
Evan: "If you want to be a creative company, you have got to be comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people copy your products"
Spiegel excited to not answer a product Q: "At this point I think we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline."
Snap needed to prove it could hold its own against mounting competition from FB. Numbers show it's gonna be hard. https://t.co/q68DH9dDFS
Snap caters to young people because "frankly they're more interested in trying to use new technology products," Spiegel says.
Interesting. Spiegel says their daily user growth may not be as good because they don't do harmful "growth hacking" like rest of industry
Snap said it signed new contracts for server space with Google and Amazon, reducing their costs. That's a positive. $SNAP
Snap stock has fallen more than 25%, dangerously close to falling below IPO price. Exec comments aren't helping.

Facebook says Whatsapp "status," their version of "stories," has over 175M daily active users https://t.co/G0N0csbekD
Zuckerberg says more than 100M people are in "meaningful" support groups on FB. His goal is 1 billion to "strengthen our social fabric" $FB
Sandberg in interview on fake news/violent video: "We haven't seen any impact on revenue but we take all these issues really seriously."
Sandberg on dropping non-GAAP eps: "investors should evaluate our performance with stock-based compensation included"
Facebook reports revenue beat, says it will no longer report non-GAAP eps, says it now has 1.94 billion monthly users $FB
@sethjberman well that's definitely also a concern, not addressed by this data. how much faster could Snap have grown without IG stories?
@hannahkuchler That said, tons of people using Instagram stories, so apparent success there, at least among my potentially late adopter friends
@hannahkuchler Totally possible!

Twitter continues to report DAU growth in percentages. Up 14% this quarter, the fourth quarterly acceleration. But doesn't give the number.
$TWTR: We've removed a lot of abusive accounts and "as a result, we‚Äôre seeing less abuse reported across the service."
$TWTR: "We continue to expect revenue growth to meaningfully lag audience growth in 2017."
Twitter reports revenue of $548.3M, higher than the $509M expected, but still its first quarterly revenue decline. Earnings beat. Shares up.
Twitter earnings hit in a few mins. Analysts are expecting the company's first overall revenue decline. $TWTR
