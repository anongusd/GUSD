RT @KellieMeyerNews: @RepJimmyGomez @realDonaldTrump Virgin Islands here too.
Which part of our republic did @realDonaldTrump forget to mention?		#PuertoRico.		No surprise. Trump has neglected #PuertoRico throughout his tenure. 		His treatment of US citizens in #PuertoRico will be one of the greatest and most shameful stains on his presidency.		#SOTU
As you listen to @realDonaldTrump talk about antisemitism, please remember he once said:		‚ÄúYou also had some very fine people on both sides.‚Äù		We remember your words. We remember your actions. We won't forget. 		#HeatherHeyer #SOTU https://t.co/wRLuYsR6qI
If we are to stay free, we need to protect the freedoms of others. We need to protect:		‚Ä¢ Women‚Äôs rights	‚Ä¢ LGBTQ+ rights	‚Ä¢ Immigrants' rights		This shouldn't be controversial. This is basic common decency. #SOTU
If @realDonaldTrump was serious about #NationalSecurity, the 1st thing he'd do is LISTEN to his national security advisers.		But #POTUS has shown that he'd rather listen to Vladmir Putin than the heads of the @FBI @CIA @ODNIgov.		That's something that should concern us all. #SOTU
Women of color are most harmed by this administration‚Äôs anti-abortion, anti-woman policies. From clinic closures to abortion coverage bans, women of color are forced to scramble to get the care they need. This is unacceptable. #ProtectAbortionAccess #SOTU
Nobody has done more to undermine protections for patients with #PreExistingConditions than @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans.		Don't you dare try to gaslight us about that, #POTUS		#SOTU
I‚Äôm proud to call these 106 women my colleagues. They are fearless. They are brave. They represent what happens when EVERYONE is involved in the Democratic process. #SOTU
How is @realDonaldTrump going to stand there and rail against undocumented immigrants when his OWN businesses exploited them as workers?		By the way, my #SOTU guest ‚Äî Sandra Diaz ‚Äî was one of those workers. 		Thank you for joining us tonight, Sandra! I‚Äôm inspired by your courage. https://t.co/QaEQz9wczN
Our ‚Äúmoral duty to create an immigration system that protects‚Äù lives DOES NOT include putting children in cages, separating families at the border, and building a wall symbolic of hate. #SOTU
Despite what you heard in the #SOTU, there is no ‚Äúnational crisis.‚Äù 		Undocumented immigration has been decreasing for YEARS and attempted border crossings are at 40-year LOWS. 		The only ‚Äúnational crisis‚Äù was manufactured by this administration.
No investigations?! Our job as Members of Congress is to hold @realDonaldTrump and his administration accountable. It's called Oversight. 		And you can count on @HouseDemocrats to do just that. #SOTU
FACT: The VAST majority of @RealDonaldTrump's $1.5 TRILLION #TaxScam went to millionaires, billionaires, and powerful corporations.		Under the Trump administration, #WorkingFamilies are getting poorer and the rich are just getting richer. 		#SOTU
Some examples of how @realDonaldTrump crippled #WorkingFamilies: 		‚Ä¢ Attacking the #ACA and people with pre-existing conditions. 		‚Ä¢ Forcing 800k federal workers to work without two paychecks. 		‚Ä¢ Pushing #GOPTaxScam that only helps the rich.		This is NOT #ForThePeople. #SOTU
If wages are rising, why can‚Äôt we #RaisetheWage to $15/hour? No one should have to work multiple full-time jobs just to make ends meet. #SOTU
306 days have passed since the start of the #FamilySeparationCrisis.		Thousands of kids remain separated from their parents -- some of whom have been lost in the system. This is choosing anything BUT ‚Äúgreatness.‚Äù #SOTU
#IncomeInequality, #ClimateChange, skyrocketing health care costs, aging infrastructure, and a broken immigration system ‚Äî these are some of the biggest issues facing America.		Will Trump propose real solutions or just feed more red meat to his base? We'll find out soon.		#SOTU

We need to know that these immigrant children are being housed in clean facilities.		We need to know if they have access to quality health services &amp; fair legal representation.		And if @HouseGOP truly cares about children as they claim they do, they‚Äôll join us in this endeavor.
That‚Äôs why today, I‚Äôm calling on @OversightDems and @GOPoversight to hold a hearing into the treatment of these kids in federal custody.		Our constituents deserve transparency and accountability!		They deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered.
Taking in children whose lives are being threatened is a part of our asylum system.	 	It‚Äôs required under international law!	 	#SeparatingFamilies to deter others from exercising their right to seek protection is inexcusable. 		The best place for a child is with their family.
Jeff Sessions says it‚Äôs their fault for coming here ‚Äúillegally.‚Äù	 	But he failed to mention that there's NOTHING illegal about coming to our border &amp; asking for asylum.	 	These families aren‚Äôt necessarily trying to sneak in.	 	They are coming to the border &amp; asking for our help.
Since day 1, @realDonaldTrump has!tried to paint these immigrants as criminals and rapists.		They‚Äôre not.		They‚Äôre people like you and me, except they‚Äôre escaping drug cartels, gang violence &amp; domestic abuse.	 	And there‚Äôs not a shred of evidence #FamilySeparation even works!
We all know they use family separation as a deterrent.	 	Take a minute to think about that, seriously.	 	The @realDonaldTrump administration intentionally hurts children and inflicts trauma to scare their families out of coming here for a better life.
But these children arrived at the Southwest border alone.	 	They weren‚Äôt victims of the president‚Äôs #FamilySeparation policies.		But sadly, there are too many innocent kids out there that have been victimized. Far too many...
We‚Äôve all seen the reports about the 1,475 unaccompanied minors last year.	 	We‚Äôve also heard the trump administration say that‚Äôs entirely untrue.	 	Today we set the record straight.	 	The @realDonaldTrump administration did lose track of these children. This is absolutely true.
Thread:		Our press conference is about to start. We‚Äôre going to address concerns over reports @HHSGov lost track of 1,475 unaccompanied minors last year &amp; tackle an array of immigration issues with @CHIRLA, @Carecen_LA &amp; @KidsPartnership.		Watch it LIVE: https://t.co/hjWmQ7XjFi

Congressional Republicans are complicit with their inability to lead and govern. I remain committed to fighting for a spending bill that reflects the values of the American people. #TrumpShutdown #DREAMActNow
The government shutdown falls squarely on the feet of President @realDonaldTrump &amp; the Republican Majority in Congress. The path was paved ‚Äì brick by brick ‚Äì by Donald Trump‚Äôs decisions &amp; actions that chose hate over love, division over unity, &amp; party over county. #TrumpShutdown
