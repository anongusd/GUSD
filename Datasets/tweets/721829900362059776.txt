@MSNBC I agree with Sen. Durbin, but a 2000 mile wall is not what was requested.  He is avoiding the actual request on the table.
@SenatorCollins I was totally impressed with your speech explaining your research and reasoning for voting for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.  Thank you for sharing it with America!
@KirstenPowers Senator Collins did an excellent job of explaining the reason for her position on judge Kavanaugh on the Senate floor.  I wish more people would truly heard her reasoning explained.
@stonecold2050 Yes I do.
@lkmcgann @voxdotcom @mattyglesias Frankin admitted to his involvement,  Kavanaugh denied his involvement
@mjs_DC @SharonMcGowanDC @Slate The assault victim came forward moths ago. Senator Feinstien waited until the last minute,  which IS suspicious
@julieroginsky Why didn't Ms. Ford come foward when it happened?
@HuntsmanAbby @TheView Congratulations Abby, you will be missed on FOX, you were one of their best!
@MarkZinno Paterno sad he told his boss too
@kilmeade @RepMattGaetz @foxandfriends Yes, if he wants to make America great again!
@foxandfriends This Mayor's behavior is both unacceptable and unpatriotic
@foxandfriends Totally unacceptable!  I am worried that we are losing our country to a very liberal mindset
@KirbySmartUGA I think you need to lay down the law on arrests. Patrick dismissed from the team. Stanley suspended for all next season. You will be better off in the long run &amp; recruiting will be put on notice.
@ericbolling Eric, please remember to wear your flag lapel pin when "on the air!"
@FoxNews @CedricRichmond @SenatorSessions I felt Rep. Richmond's comments to be demeaning and disrespectful to the entire group!

@WSJ How many of the 19 million ended up on Medicaid?
@NFL @dallascowboys @packers @Seahawks @AtlantaFalcons Atlanta has a good shot. You never know until the whistle blows!
@FoxNews @POTUS 	What about Fort Hood, San Bernardino, Orlando, Tennessee all had allegiance to Isis or Bin Laden.  I respectfully disagree
@Reince I find it very disappointing that the Republicans could not have a high level outline on how Obama care would be replaced on day one

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump beat her on the issues, they make a much bigger impact.  Stay out of the gutter you'll be the better man
@FoxNews yes, I agree with the Sheriff!!
@TheTylt The debate was not rigged, Mr. Trump was not prepared, it was embarrassing!  Needs to clean up his act.
@DanaPerino Dana, I would like to commend you on how you handle yourself on TV. You are always cool, calm and collected.  Thanks

@FoxNews Nice job on the National Anthem, proud to be an American! &amp; an ex Marine!!!
@FOX5Atlanta Is'nt Mr. Kaine running for VP of the United States, not Mexico?
@foxandfriends enjoying your show from Atlanta Ga!!
@Veteran4Trump The angry black Trump supporter makes a good points/arguments, choice of language detracts from the message
@FoxBusiness Yes, I agree with Rudy.  Sad day for justice in America!
