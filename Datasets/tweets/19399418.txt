@weatherangel  #tcot agreed.
@ericgrant  #tcot personally, as a man, I am not into men, but I respect the rights of other men to choose partners  that make sense to them
@ericgrant  #tcot and ask them not to recognize institutions between couples they don't agree with.
@ericgrant  #tcot adults get into. However, for those who view marriage as a religious institution, they can go to their religious leaders
@ericgrant  #tcot whomever they want however they want. It makes no sense for  the state to regulate what kinds of contracts consenting
@ericgrant  #tcot  personally, i think marriage is a civil contract and not a religious one, so consenting adults should be able to marry
@ericgrant  #tcot lol... Why not, marry your partner, or marry two partners... It's your life lol

Roll Call: Here is who voted for and against the Obama Stimulus Bill in the House... http://tinyurl.com/ba8pom
@catkeepr  #tcot yes that is true, but the public is fickle, they expect miracles from their messiah, when he does not deliver, oh well...
@ObamaPrez44 @tcot of course we should, in fact that's not enough, we should make it $400k per person, it's the socialist way lol
@r@Fderfler  #tcot wiser words have never been spoken
@catkeepr  #tcot, I don't think Obama can get reelected. Socialist policies have failed everywhere they've been tried, and that's all he has
@catkeepr  #tcot, there is a long period of time between now and eventually... A period of time that is longer than 2 years...
@lgs1958 #tcot working on it, as soon as I get it, shall post it...
@petersonwally  righto, don't forget the part that has been allocated to fight STDs...
@petersonwally  lots of parts... The mall in DC  for starters lol... #tcot
@Genevangelist  #tcot, you got that right... Good news is it shows Obama has no claim to bi-partisanship

@DaveNF2G  #tcot I seriously doubt it... I could be wrong, but I doubt it...
#tcot only good thing to have come out of the Geithner fiasco is that Obama used up a whole lot of political capital...
@Steve_Simon Actually, I think Barack Obama gets that distinction, only difference he never got caught...
@Steve_Simon I agree with you, he is a tax cheat, plain and simple...
@soulhuntre good luck with that one

@azraider #tcot of course wall street likes him, it was under his watch that wall street went under
@curtisgray  I think the media actually sees them as being right for supporting Obama, in their eyes, he can do no wrong... #tcot
#tcot sad reality is that Hatch actually serves on the Senate Committee that oversees the IRS and the Treasury...
@michellemalkin #tcot, hope he doesn't have a heart-attack on the senate floor as a result of his excitement...
@michellemalkin  #TCOT, that's awesome, we might as well get Blago to head the Department of Justice... He's only made a few mistakes
@michellemalkin  #tcot Hatch is an idiot...
@Chopped50ford  #tcot, many are scared to oppose it because if they do, and the economy does improve, they might not get re-elected. wimps
@SenJohnMcCain welcome to twitter... now go oppose timothy geithner and the stimulus bill :-)

@MarkRMatthews Adios... It's been a pleasure
@suzireb very true...
@MarkRMatthews  Lol don't watch TV, but hey, how else do u explain the fact that 69 million people voted for Obama? Simply bizzare...
@MarkRMatthews  Correct. As was shown during the election, folks treat politics like they do American Idol, style over substance
@MarkRMatthews TARP I , talk less of any additions... But they don't seem to care...
@MarkRMatthews on us unlike any we've ever had before. We don't have the capacity to bring our GDP close to anywhere neccessary to pay off
@MarkRMatthews someone , somewhere is eventually going to have to pay for it, and that someone is the US Taxpayer. The are placing a burden
@MarkRMatthews it is horrible. I just don't understand how Bush, Obama and Congress don't realize that money isn't created from thin air.
@MarkRMatthews Challenge is if they are not, then we might as well say goodbye to the republic as it is. National Socialism can't work here
@MarkRMatthews Well, I think if the GOP and Blue Dog Dems stand firm,  there might be hope... If not...  When all is said and done
@MarkRMatthews agreed, but that is why the "stimulus bill" must be defeated for starters... As it contains a huge allocation to that cause
@MarkRMatthews they can think what they want, but it is pushing it to use our money to push a pro-abortion agenda...
@kishau great stuff... Thanks...
@michaelemlong Ethics and Obama ? That's just like saying "fiscal responsibility and the Democratic Party"...
@michaelemlong I agree. As long as they understand that money is NOT going to come from the center for their BS, we should be ok...
