Trump is deep in bed with Putin &amp; a whole host of other Russians, this is a proven fact.	Trumps campaign manager, facing 20 charges, was in regular contact wth Russian secret service during campaign and after the election.	Trump continued to collude through his personal lawyer.
Don’t forget they’ve been hatching this plan for years and years. Putin had to be very good so as not to be obvious re the election interference.	The evidence of this is clear &amp; more clear everyday.	They did attack us, Trump new &amp; did nothing.	He knows now and defends them still.
