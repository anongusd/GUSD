@nutcrake @RepStephMurphy @ricardorossello Nine years living in the island and I‚Äôve seen enough to know the continuous political abuse &amp; lies. mismanagement of US dollars, contributing citizens loosing pensions &amp; retirement benefits, while criminals in prison vote for PR political parties.

@RepStephMurphy @ricardorossello How does a violent criminal who murders an innocent citizen gets the right to vote? Understandable if he is return to society but while serving a life sentence they hold the same right as a tax payer to vote? Contributing working citizens hold those rights. Not criminals in jail.
@RepStephMurphy @ricardorossello There‚Äôs a lot going on that many citizens who live in the states aren‚Äôt aware of the continuous abuse in this island.

@SenGillibrand @CarmenYulinCruz Congress can enact laws but the reality is that it will never stop a violent criminal. Fire arms are sold in many underground markets. Take for example in Puerto Rico. How is it that confiscated fire arms by the PR police end up yearly on the hands of criminals? üßê nice to dream.
@Justicia_PR 3 years for driving under the influence &amp; impacting a citizen with a child?! Are you joking?!  No wonder violent offenders do not fear the judicial system in PR. Your soft in crime &amp; violent offenders are awarded in PR prisons with privileges in exchange for votes in elections.
LEOSA in P.R.! Why is it so complicated to the @PRPDNoticias and the @DSPnoticias respect and understand LEOSA? Is it the poor educational level of PR police? Or not having the adequate understanding in law? Can we have anyone from the @TheJusticeDept educate them? https://t.co/iu5XyRrMtz

@mjean2 is our own working class families who continue to vote for these idiots into office while they attack our schools districts, pensions, &amp; increase our taxes. US Census 2012 with less than 1.3 contributing citizens &amp; over 2.2 million in free housing &amp; food stamps in PR. Shameful!

@FOMBPR 2 million of non contributing citizens who live at the governt expense for generations collection assistance &amp; living off housing at a cost of 2 billion a year at the cost of US tax dollars. Why not cut their budget? @USDA is a temporary assistance prog not long term!

@WKAQ580 Why would you even ask such question? The attacks in recent Hispanics through the states are a clear indication that he holds no remorse or respect for P.R. &amp; yet our P.R. citizens continue to follow &amp; support his inappropriate behavior towards Hispanics. Who is to blame?
@jayfonsecapr He needs no escorts for his vacation especially when this is totally a mismanagement of government funds. These politicians &amp; governt do not display interests to citizens needs but more to political gain and control of power to benefit their needs and own families.

Why would you need more millions?
@DSPnoticias @radioislatv DSP is composed within political favors to oversees local govert PR entities. Yet, the governor allows this ghost agency to overlap others within security. How is DSP funded? If PR governt is utilizing fed governt funds, who authorized these funds?@SenadoPR
@trschatz51 @GarciaManny4 Your media will expose what you allow them to provide our citizens.

@noticel @stevenmnuchin1 did they provided the adequate information in documents with credibility, to convince you to make such modifications? All this was done in less than half a day? You can adjust continuous modifications for them &amp; they will continue to fail the public‚Äôs needs.
@law_melendez Exactly!
@law_melendez You walk into a bank for a business loan &amp; expect success explaining ideas verbally to a loan officer with no support in proposal documents, no research in your business, &amp; no credibility. Will that get you a loan? That‚Äôs how the governt administ in PR likes to negotiate.

@ElNuevoDia Are you kidding me. With the continuous request in fed governt funds and yet, you have no effective strategy to help support the island. Your using funds to patch up areas and have no solutions to obtain a way to generate funds to continue operating. Your crippling PR!
@PuertoFor @NotiUno @fema @Jenniffer2012 @CarmenYulinCruz is this effective governt management? You spend countless hours in resources in areas that don‚Äôt contribute to help society nor the economy &amp; yet, you owe money to the PR police depart? Your political escorts are always paid. The excuse is?
You can cut funds within that area to help support local governt agencies and local labor services. You keep increasing public assistance benefits for people who claim that they can‚Äôt work but then again they drive better vehicles &amp; live better than the contributing citizen. ü§î
@ricardorossello @jayfonsecapr @trschatz51 you issue billions a year in fed funds to keep over 180 million in public assistance with no interest to build programs that will make them contribute back into the economy. Why not target millions in assistance to work &amp; contribute?
@normandoh @CarmenYulinCruz They claim that we have no money, and eliminate bonuses &amp; benefits from contributing citizens. But at the end their own bonuses &amp; increases in salary benefits will never be affected.

@Metro_PR @DSPnoticias @fortalezapr @trschatz51 nothing personal against the gentlemen. however, when we have our citizens being murdered like animals &amp; no efforts are being displayed to reduce crime &amp; protect citizens, its clear Pesquera &amp; the police Commissioner must both go ASAP!
@sierradedorado7 @ricardorossello These violent crimes against our citizens needs to stop. The governor of PR needs help &amp; must make an example of one of these violent offenders. This will not cease until the government acts aggressively towards them. Bring the fight to their back yard. Hit all housing projects.
@NotiUno @trschatz51 @SenadoPR @fortalezapr @CamaraConPR @nytimes our critical violence against our citizens of PR reflects the competence of current political appointees within the PR government. @jayfonsecapr
How can you call your self a proud American citizen when you are against our 2nd Amendment right? Shouldn‚Äôt you be in a mental institution or in another country where guns don‚Äôt exist? Shouldn‚Äôt we hold criminals accountable for their own actions? Or your just absolutely stupid!
@primerahora Thank You Pesquera for the superior support &amp; guarantee in Public Safety to our society.

@TelenoticiasPR MR. Pesquera! Your political influence forced this professional national honored woman representing millions of hard working Puerto Rico woman to step down. Under your safety the violent crimes have triple against our public. Will you step down now? https://t.co/v76WS1cmKG
@TelenoticiasPR @nytimes @CamaraConPR @fortalezapr @DSPnoticias I want to see Pesquera walk around within the recent crime points of our island &amp; by residencial housing projects in live TV at night &amp; demonstrate our public‚Äôs safety. ü§î if he is secured on his comment in TV then no worries.
@lll_jess_lll @PRPDNoticias @trschatz51 PR has one of the brightest &amp; largest law enforcement personnel with the expertise &amp; tools in reducing crime. The issue is the political personnel within not possessing leadership skills and absolutely no problems solving skills.
@primerahora @DSPnoticias and they say that our public is safe? Safe enough to walk around like Pesquera claimed?
@PRPDNoticias @trschatz51 @SenadoPR @fortalezapr @CamaraConPR @nytimes our critical violence against our citizens of PR reflects the competence of current political appointees within the PR government. @jayfonsecapr
@PRPDNoticias This is absolutely beyond sadness to know that our own island is destroying one another. These events in criminal activity must stop. @trschatz51 how is the governor not seeking the federal government to help combat these crimes? This does not reflect public safety for citizens.

@ALT_DOJ I truly embarrassed of our own government with such response towards our society. This is what our our system has become?
@NotiUno Where did this idiot concluded this?! Our public is terrorized because the government of PR doesn‚Äôt have the balls in showing criminals who is in control. The government of PR rather over pay idiots like Pesquera &amp; the new Police Superintendent to stay in office &amp; drink coffee.
@nytimes What!! üò° don‚Äôt spit at our law enforcement honor! No F such thing as he resign/retired. It‚Äôs an obligation he has as a public servant to preserve life. Many agencies have active shooter training within jurisdiction. He failed our citizens &amp; children. He must be judge! üò°üá∫üá∏üò°

@76rooster great idea to have retired vets with experience work security within. However, the very same people in office against our 2nd A bqz of these shootings will not allow it to avoid paying millions for security. But to spend tax millions in legal reaps for criminals like Cruz is okü§î
@NRATV @CNN @DLoesch I want to marry that woman!! üòç
@bluelivesmtr The police department doesn‚Äôt need to answer anything to this guy. He was detain as in protocol with an active shooter. The information part in assuring the schools or public are aware falls under their own jurisdiction. Our law enforcement officer lives are first at all coast.
@Jenniffer2012 why raised utilities to our citizens when your government received millions?! Why are only the small working class citizens who pay contributions being targeted? Do you increase rents yearly to public housing &amp; utilities? Do they pay back to governt the billions in assistance?
@NotiUno What justification is in placed for increase in water? Is it because they have so much water from the continues rains? This is absolutely abusing our citizens.
@NotiUno Let‚Äôs me honest Governor. His political influence placed him on this position &amp; it wasn‚Äôt bqz of his experience. His salary is more than the PR Superintendent who is in charge of the police department &amp; our public‚Äôs safety.
@NotiUno That was just a display of talk from an individual who doesn‚Äôt accept that he has no knowledge in what he is doing. The same when he ran the police department. He drank more coffee out of his office than crimes fighting or helping our the police department.
@NotiUno It‚Äôs exactly what I said before. Pesquera takes authority away from our Police department &amp; of the superintendent of the Police. No absolute leadership, structure, or effective communication between each other. A clear weakness combating crimes against our public.
@NotiUno You pay $248,500 a year to this guy and he can‚Äôt even reduce crimes against our citizens?! He can‚Äôt protect our communities nor display any interest in working with our citizens to hear out community concerns that may help police target crimes areas more effectively. Great job!
@yucahuhijodeat5 @NotiUno I believe it. It‚Äôs a shame that it‚Äôs generated from hard working citizens taxes.
@NotiUno This position in PR is an absolute waste of tax payers dollars that Pesquera holds. We have a police superintendent &amp; why we need another useless person on board doing absolutely nothing for our communities?!
@NotiUno I am sorry Pesquera. But people need to understand when it‚Äôs time to go. You served our citizens of PR &amp; at times in political affairs you need to watch what bores out of your mouth.
@UnivisionPR It‚Äôs embarrassing to know that people fled our island and many still say they can‚Äôt find employment. We have millions of undocumented immigrants who quickly find work &amp; become contributing citizens but our people in PR not being immigrants can‚Äôt find employment? ü§î
@washingtonpost @SenadoPR you should enact this ASAP in PR. This will force the millions of people out of welfare who you maintain in public assistance &amp; free housing who do absolutely nothing to contribute to the islands economy nor their lives. It will save @USDA millions in tax payers dollars
@NotiUno It‚Äôs disgraceful how they just stand in public TV &amp; humiliate our public. They can‚Äôt even lead their own political groups. How they even expect to serve working citizens or even punish violent criminals when they let them control their prison system &amp; public‚Äôs communities.

@ElNuevoDia You formatted areas in where you think will assist in our economy but if you view what you targeted, you still have no security in generating revenue back into the government system of PR.
@Metro_PR They will Administrate the schools but how will you generate continues funding to keep them operating without having to keep on asking the federal government for more money?
@ElNuevoDia The governt of PR loves asking the federal governt for billions yearly. Yet they can‚Äôt implement resources that will help in the long run generate back revenue. You throw away with just investing in but nothing ever comes back in gain to pay back what you owe.ü§î
@radioislatv These are exactly the behaviors that destroys our island. You have people in these areas that have no sense in completing a basic job and yet you make the public pay increases for their incompetence. Are you paying vehicle damages for their horrible service on the streets?

These Police officers sacrifice their lives everyday &amp; yet the government of PR doesn‚Äôt increase their pay, offer good benefits &amp; a well deserved retirement pension.
@cate_long @StevenMufson PR can‚Äôt continue having their own internal people govern the island. We are losing our traditions, respect, &amp; culture as these vultures govern for their own political interests. Our citizens are victims bqz of them. They fail every day in protecting citizens interests n needs.
@bbtorr3 @NotiUno @ricardorossello Your right on the target!! üëçpolitical appointees for favors only being in people who have no problem solving skills. Everything is for political group interest &amp; not of our public‚Äôs needs or problems.
@NotiUno Pesquera your a joke. Your blaming citizens for their behaviors? The governt of PR is sole responsible for these types of behaviors that lead to crimes waves. Yet your governt is absolutely blind to their own creation. You people have a leadership problem &amp; it‚Äôs not the citizens.
@Metro_PR That works both ways üòÅüëç
@TelenoticiasPR The behaviors within these types of demonstrations only display complete ignorance. You can dislike &amp; disapproved in the federal government decisions. but understand that PR will have to pay what they owe &amp; accept any decisions they make as long as we utilize their money üí¥

@SenadoPR @jayfonsecapr this is where we fail our public in PR.

@dbongino We are being careless in our actions with this ongoing debate. This is what many other country‚Äôs expect from us to fight among one another. People voted and it‚Äôs what we got. We must look into our external &amp; internal threats to protecting our great nation and our society. üá∫üá∏
@ASSMCAonline @ricardorossello @BeatrizRossello @fortalezapr Absolutely correct! You also forgot to mention that you spend billions unnecessarily allowing people to live of your governt by food stamps &amp; housing. But then you don‚Äôt look out for the small percentage of hard working people who don‚Äôt live of the governt. Is that fairness?
@dbongino Absolutely right on!! üëçsad how many blame quickly the use of fire arms as if guns walk around society alone randomly targeting civilians. Also interesting that in Florida the governt isn‚Äôt holding Cruz parents accountable of that violent crime. What‚Äôs the parents excuse?
@VoceroPR Truly sad but an urgent must to protect the public‚Äôs interests and avoid any further mismanagement with federal government funds.
@jayfonsecapr This should always be like this in monitoring anything with federal assistance. We have a bad experience in how the government of PR always mismanages funds in areas not authorized.
@trschatz51 It‚Äôs absolutely about time. Let‚Äôs see how much dark will come into light with this investigation.
@UnivisionPR It gets to a sad point in our justicia system to help aid these types of violent criminals in court. Why must we utilize metal health problems as the origins of their behavior? How is this helping our victims?
@NotiUno They better get this without any further delays.
