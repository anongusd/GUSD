Harris gets an immigration ques. from a woman who explains that she’s a junior in college and an undocumented immigrant not protected by DACA. “We’ve got to pass comprehensive immigration reform,” Harris says. (Some context: Congress tried - and failed - to do this in 2013.)

The one tangible sign of progress after today's votes in the Senate was the face-to-face meeting between McConnell and Schumer. Question is whether that meeting leads to anything else or not. "We're talking" is all Schumer would repeatedly say as he left McConnell's office.
Sen. Thom Tills (R-N.C.): “Most of us plan on sticking around until we’ve got something else to vote on, including this weekend.”
Ever-quotable Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) on the shutdown talks: “There are all kind of discussions. You’ve got, you know, people running around, I don’t mean this in a pejorative sense, but like sprayed roaches. They’re everywhere.”
Here's where we are in the Senate when it comes to the shutdown: The Trump and Dem plans to end the shutdown failed, as expected. McConnell and Schumer have met. Unclear yet whether their talk has produced a breakthrough. Lots of uncertainty in R rank and file about next steps.

Republican operatives trying to keep the Senate in GOP hands tell me they are cautiously optimistic about Tuesday. There's talk at the highest levels of the party about gaining one or two seats. 		At the same time, there is nervousness the close races could break the other way.

But the reality still remains that Rs have a much more favorable map. And grabbing away two Dem held seats could very well be the ballgame when it comes to the majority, given the pickups Dems would need to make.
If Dems experience a Sun Belt surge — not out of question given ‘16 numbers/demographic trends — and can pick up AZ/NV/TX and Bredesen wins TN, then Dems could afford to cough up two of their own red state seats and win the majority. Would mark another big moment of realignment.
One possible path to the majority for Senate Dems is to lose ND, hold everything else, and pick up AZ/NV and either TN or TX. 		Still a pretty tough climb to achieve that, to be clear. Would mean holding FL/MO/IN in addition to making gains on conservative turf.

I asked John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator, whether President Trump represented the United States well on his international trip. Here's how he responded (He wouldn't say yes or no, definitively): https://t.co/NA22yqQZaZ
McConnell did not respond to questions about whether he was disappointed in Trump's statements or if Trump represented the United States well on his international trip.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), just now in the Capitol: "As I have said repeatedly, the Russians are not our friends and I entirely agree with the assessment of our intelligence community."
Schumer on Trump comments in Helsinki: “The only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.”
Sen. Lankford (R-Okla.) disagrees w/Pres. Trump in a statement: "There is no evidence that any member of the Trump campaigned worked with Russia during the 2016 election, but there is plenty of evidence that the Russians aggressively attempted to interfere in our election."

Breaking: Trump open to path to citizenship for some ‘dreamers’ in immigration deal. @davidnakamura https://t.co/nxDa82mLyq
Senate is holding final confirmation vote on Brownback and we're back at a familiar spot, 49-49. So Pence will have to beak tie again.
So Pence breaks the 49-49 tie to move the Brownback nomination forward. Final confirmation vote scheduled for 5 pm.
brownback 49-49
Dramatic moment as Senate tries to move forward on Brownback nom to be Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. It's 49-49. McCain's not here. Corker in Davos. Everyone else voted. So looking like Pence will have to come up and break the tie to move it forward.

Republican Sen. Jeff Flake sends Democrat Doug Jones a check for Alabama Senate campaign https://t.co/lxUyMLfRSw
Many mainstream Republican officials -- whether they will say so publicly or not -- increasingly believe Moore is going to defeat Jones in Alabama. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala), who did not vote for Moore, even predicted a Moore victory (!): “It’s the Republicans' to lose."
But McConnell's inability to get the outcome he wanted here clearly shows the limits of his political influence in the Trump era. Now Trump is all in on Alabama and doing the exact opposite of what McConnell initially wanted. And he has a cavalry coming in with him. https://t.co/Ro3vGXq23Q
Sense in McConnell's orbit on Alabama is that he did all he could. Came up with methodical plan to protect the party and drew up last ditch plans for getting behind an alternate candidate. Trump didn't go for it. Neither did Ivey. "It is what it is," is how associates put it.
NRSC not expected to re-enter the Alabama Senate race, per McConnell. Question is what RNC engagement will mean in terms of voter outreach in the final few week of the race.
"The president's going to do what the president's going to do. I have not endorsed Mr. Moore and don't intend to," said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). https://t.co/p51WBOtWh1
Many GOP senators, including McConnell, not inclined today to talk about whether the RNC re-engaging in the Alabama Senate race was a good idea. Collins the rare GOP senator who has flatly said she didn't think they should do it.
