Who do I turn to get help with my disability? I have been trying since about 1975. I got a honorable discharge from the Army with a rank of E-1 with a court martial attached to DD-214. This has caused Hardship in my life
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversaryNo😀 https://t.co/pIsLLQ1VbJ
I got out a E-1 when discharge because the Army build up false accusation against me the Army set traps so I would not get promoted Why
I worked in a E-6 slot as a E-3 the Army made sure I never got that rank or any rank I got demoted instead of promoted 1974 Why?
I have wonder for years why the @USArmy never promoted me the Army did all they could to get me demoted in 1974 while I served in Korea
I wish the Army had given me the honor that was due to me instead of dishonor I worked hard to get nothing while I served in the @USArmy
WHO CARES ANYMORE? IT IS NOT ENOUGH SPACES TO EXPRESS MYSELFI can say one thing I wish the Army didn't make my life so miserable.
