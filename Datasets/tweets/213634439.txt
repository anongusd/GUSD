North Carolina Republicans must stay the course and keep fighting for a stronger and more prosperous North Carolina.
We all know what happened the last time North Carolina Democrats were in power. Hardworking North Carolinians saw their state on the verge of bankruptcy due to budget shortfalls, record high unemployment, and taxes that killed jobs and economic opportunity.
We now know that Governor Cooper and North Carolina General Assembly Democrats have taken a play out of Socialist Bernie Sanders‚Äô playbook to offer everything for free, but no solution for how to pay for these budget-busting policies.

Yesterday, the House voted to #DefundPlannedParenthood &amp; #RepealObamacare. Today, we sent this legislation to @POTUS https://t.co/jrGiPVZsv2
In this @fayobserver piece, I recap the specific case work we assisted #NC02 constituents &amp; #veterans with in 2015. https://t.co/4yu8CEWLRi
The bottom line is that families across #NC02 and the country deserve a truly affordable healthcare plan. It's time to #repealObamacare.
Because of #Obamacare, NC is facing some of the steepest health insurance rates in the country‚Äîwith premium hikes increasing as much as 50%
#OnHisDesk is a repeal of #Obamacare that allows for us to reset the American people on pathway towards a patient-centered alternative.
The Restoring Americans‚Äô Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, #HR3762, will gut #Obamacare and reduce our nation‚Äôs deficit by $516 billion
Today‚Äôs legislation, #HR3762, is the first time ever that a full bill to repeal #Obamacare will head straight to @POTUS.
Today @HouseGOP delivers on 3 big promises: 1) #repealObamacare &amp; put #onhisdesk 2) slash the national deficit 3) #defundPlannedParenthood
As a concealed carry permit holder, I will not allow for our president to trample on our Constitutional right to bear arms. #2ndAmendment
This type of go-at-it-alone behavior has not‚Äîand will not‚Äîbe tolerated. Our right to bear arms is enshrined in our #Constitution.
This time around, @POTUS has zeroed in on restricting our #gunrights and access to guns. We will not stand for this.
@POTUS is, once again, working around Congress to demonstrate a flagrant disregard toward our #2ndAmendment rights.

Glad to be working alongside my friend and #breastcancer survivor, @RepDWSTweets, on the #PALSAct. #BeatCancer
The #PALSAct advocates a 2-year freeze on proposed USPSTF guidance so providers, patients &amp; lawmakers can address differing recommendations.
My bill, the #PALSAct, should move swiftly through the House to eliminate barriers for patients seeking access to life-saving screenings.
But, given the variance in recommendations among women‚Äôs health groups &amp; cancer organizations, the need for the #PALSAct is clear. 2/2

This type of recommendation impairs access to breast cancer screenings and would be detrimental for women's health in this country. (2/2)
If USPSTF‚Äôs proposed changes to breast screening guidelines go into effect, approx 22 million women risk losing access to mammograms. (1/2)
We need to aid women in fight against #breastcancer - even more essential to put measures in place for early detection.

Removal of the 440th Airlift Wing at Pope lacks strategic merit &amp; injects avoidable risks into the readiness of our rapid deployment forces.
This decision takes the "air" out of airborne as planes have been located at Pope since 1954. #FtBragg #440th
The 440th Airlift Wing is the only C-130H model wing in the country the Air Force is choosing to close completely. #FtBragg
Just testified on shortsighted decision the USAF has made to deactivate 440th Airlift Wing located at Pope Army Airfield #FtBragg.
