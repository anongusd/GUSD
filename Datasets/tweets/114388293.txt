Ag is a way of life, for many, it's their livelihood. All in all, it contributes about $25.6B to the economy; when ag prospers, SD prospers. I'm all too familiar with how tough a business it can be, that's why doing right by the industry is so important. https://t.co/ooploVqBHa

We don‚Äôt need more govt. And that‚Äôs an important distinction: ‚ÄúThe Republican candidates for SD governor take opposite sides over creating more state govt boards, commissions &amp; task forces. State AG Jackley plans to use them while Rep. Noem rejects them.‚Äù https://t.co/iQaEZA4YwT
Great to see the Prairie AquaTech expansion in Volga. Innovative companies like this are exactly what we need to recruit to South Dakota, and as governor, my Kickstart the Economy agenda is designed to ensure businesses like this can grow in South Dakota! https://t.co/jSXted1bgp
The ability to be thrifty, to budget, to predict - those are things I've always appreciated about farmers and ranchers. That kind of understanding is something I will bring to the governor's office. https://t.co/2XOGZsKCIi
From historic tax cuts to a Farm Bill that delivered strong crop insurance and livestock disaster programs, I've worked to produce real results for South Dakota. I'll take that same drive with me to the governor's office to deliver big results for South Dakota. https://t.co/qt8Njzo2ZL

Bigger gov rarely produces greater freedom or prosperity. Under my admin, there would be no new boards, no new commissions, &amp; no new blue ribbon task forces.

The avg SD nurse makes $57,010. The avg truck driver makes $40,850. Let's say they get married and have 3 children. Because we doubled the Child Tax Credit, that family would keep another $3,182 of their hard-earned money - a 3.25% increase in take-home pay! #TaxDay https://t.co/hfE9TFAtKI
The average South Dakota police officer would owe $5,096 under the old law on Tax Day. Thanks to our historic tax cuts, the bill drops to just over $4,105, saving $991. Buy a house and the bill could drop even lower! #TaxDay https://t.co/DDglxoMMr5
It‚Äôs #TaxDay and the last time you‚Äôll have to file w/o the benefit of the historic tax cuts we made. But don't wait until next year to see your savings! We crunched the numbers for you.

Empower families. Do more with every taxpayer dollar. Promote civic education. Increase post-secondary affordability. Continue rejecting Common Core. Produce job-holders, not simply degree-holders. Agree? Check out my education proposal - JUST RELEASED! https://t.co/THQYdFc3tn
This Title IX fight with USDA that‚Äôs been going on for months is stupid, unnecessary, &amp; a complete waste of everyone‚Äôs time. It adds nothing to the rodeo experience for the kids involved. I will keep standing with SD 4-H until this nonsense is shut down.  https://t.co/zq8y59gwyK

Before tax reform, low-tax states like SD were being forced to subsidize liberal states like California. I had to fight hard for our low-tax principles as we negotiated the final deal, but I'm proud we got the win. As governor, I'll do the same.

Today is President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs birthday! To celebrate, I wanted to share a few words about the impact he's had on my life - how he's inspired me and influenced the way I view the role of government. Take a look. https://t.co/6OrItPlLow
With the passage of tax reform, SD farmers and ranchers will be seeing some changes. I went through those changes with NewsCenter1 recently. Take a look! https://t.co/ekuIGZUrun

Ellsworth is critical to natl security &amp; an economic engine. Proud to endorse SB40, which will support the base's long-term viability. If elected gov, I'll work w Ellsworth Dev Authority to expand on these efforts, ensuring SD continues to play a major role in defending America.

As governor, I pledge to veto any and all efforts to increase taxes. You've worked hard for your money. The government needs to respect that. https://t.co/fe5Qeqyi2G
Whether you‚Äôre a trafficker, a website that facilitates #humantrafficking, or someone who purchases victims for sex, your activity will have no place in SD. We will strengthen our laws and ensure law enforcement officers have the tools needed to make sure those laws are enforced.
Another very concerning headline. This time, from the @RCJournal: "The number &amp; frequency of crimes committed in Rapid City saw some dramatic increases in 2017..." Grateful for the work of SD law enforcement - especially with crime on the rise like this. https://t.co/VrpUUvROWC
The right to bear arms is a fundamental constitutional freedom. By enacting constitutional carry legislation, we can further protect the #2ndAmendment rights of law-abiding South Dakotans.

SD has pheasant hunting, Custer State Park, Great Plains Zoo, Glacial Lakes, MtRushmore! Loved being part of the excitement when I ran our hunting lodge and ready to be SD's Salesperson in Chief. I commit to always asking what more we can do to attract tourism to SD. #SDOnTheMove https://t.co/DzX90VSRNN
There are two things families should never have to worry about when coming to South Dakota: Safety or their ability to have an incredible time. Both top my priority list. #SDOnTheMove https://t.co/0Qsi001ANV
Tourism is SD's #2 industry. We need to attract the workforce necessary to meet their needs. I've heard from too many that they'd love to stay open for a "shoulder" season, but can't recruit enough workers. We're going to change that. #SDOnTheMove https://t.co/M1tq85GusB

More and more, we're seeing certain voices -often conservative or Christian voices- purposely silenced on our college campuses. These are places where the free expression of ideas should thrive. Free speech is a constitutional right students are entitled to. Proud to back HB1073.

Great news for Walmart's 5,300+ SD employees today. Because of tax reform, they're increasing wages, expanding paid maternity/paternity leave policies, dishing out bonuses, and more. This is the real-life impact of tax reform. https://t.co/qGVsE8Mjjm
South Dakotans work hard for their money. Their tax dollars should be respected. My office's 2016 spending was $190,000 below 2010 levels (when I was elected), and my travel budget has remained consistent the entire time.
This is critical. Too often govt programs perpetuate poverty. Work requirements help reverse that, which is why work requirements (and empowering states to implement requirements) have been central to the reforms I've championed for Medicaid, poverty programs and food stamps. https://t.co/CBk21JEZWc
Breaking this morning &gt;&gt; Raises, bonuses and even better benefits are coming to most Great Western Bank employees as a result of tax reform! And the company will be increasing their community investments. Thrilled to hear this from a South Dakota company! https://t.co/R0sGX8VGjV

Great to be in Brookings yesterday to talk with families about tax reform. With lower rates, the Child Tax Credit doubled, and the first $24,000 a couple makes now tax free, SD families will be stronger! https://t.co/TXR8ZeqlMe

Pres Obama is trying to claim the mantle of defending the middle class yet he refuses to support the jobs bills we are passing in the House.
I hope every American takes note of who supported the Balanced Budget Amendment and who opposed it.
Reaching $15 trillion in debt is a milestone that should strengthen our resolve to fight even harder for spending reforms.

The Senate hasn't approved a budget in over 900 days and 15 different job-creating measures are stuck there as well.
I agree with most folks when they say Washington isn't working.
The low approval ratings we are seeing for Congress as an institution aren't surprising.

Bipartisan objection to Pres. Obama's "jobs plan" is simple to understand. We don't need Stimulus 2.0 - we need to get govt out of the way.

Telling us what you would veto is not leadership, Mr. President.
It might be a smart political move to scare seniors,  but it‚Äôs really nothing more than a shameful stunt at a time when we need leadership.
The President is using his megaphone to frame this debate around the govt not being able to write Social Security checks on August 3rd.
Next week the House will vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment.  I will support bec/ govt should stop spending more money than we have.
Are politicians in Washington so out of touch that they think "compromise" should mean raising taxes on Americans while our economy lags?
The "stimulus" has failed America. We cannot continue to spend money we don't have on schemes that don't work. http://bit.ly/84oIjX

Thank you for all the support on my debt limit vote last night. We can't give the spenders a blank check.  We will fight for real reforms.
I will vote "no" against blindly raising the debt limit because we need real spending cuts & reforms. No more status quo.

No matter what issue faces our nation ($4 gas, crushing debt, etc.), the Democrats first impulse is to raise taxes. That's not the solution.

4-county Lincoln Day Dinner tonight in Winner.  Looking forward to chatting w/  friends from Tripp, Todd, Gregory & Mellette counties.
but they won't put out a credible alternative that cuts our deficit by trillions, reforms the way Washington does business and creates jobs.
The other side will attack this plan with false statements aimed to scare seniors...
I just voted for the plan to cut spending by $6 trillion over 10 years compared to President Obama's budget.
It's going to take more than a speech by the President to convince small business owners and families that we need a tax increase.
What did the Senate and White House do? White House: Issue a veto threat on the bill. Senate: Nothing.
The House passed another bill today to fund the government for a week, fund the troops for the rest of the year and cut spending.
