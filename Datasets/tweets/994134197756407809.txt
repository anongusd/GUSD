If you want to learn the market the best way to do so is to read, watch, and try. Take 10$ and flush it down the drain, use your brain and go for trial and error. Tons of apps allow for testing at these small dollar amounts. Once you get a feel for it all then you can invest.
People who can’t generate their own money hate on those that can. I used to be one of them. I am personally attesting to the fact that you become much less hateful when you take control of your wealth. You can have 5$ and feel rich if it’s 5$ of wealth you personally generated.

@URAnonymous1 Are not*** which unfortunately is a very important correction lol
@URAnonymous1 I believe wholeheartedly that this will solve over the next 4-8 years. People are not so crazy to vote for someone like Beto so long as you don’t put some 80 year old investment banker on the right. We need sensible people with sensible policies more than this “war against dems”
@URAnonymous1 Most of the “leadership” is under scrutiny. The new ones that cozy to Bernie are not all that popular when it comes to a grand scale. Bernie has changed over the years too. Frankly the youth will tout this brand of Democrat but they will never get the votes from the mass.
@URAnonymous1 Well let’s be real, Pelosi is not popular, so promoting that her party “supports” her agenda? Don’t you see what’s really going on? A small percentage of the crusaders believe a word she or even they say. They are all evil fucks like you seem to think. They are stuck.
@URAnonymous1 There are good candidates now. Today. But you won’t acknowledge they even exist. Republicans should clean house too. Just don’t be so biased if you’re truly claiming to be unbiased. If you’re not, then be a right winger and own it. But don’t be a Trojan horse.
@URAnonymous1 Maybe post more things like that. To talk to you sound sensible, but just a glance at your page paints a starkly different picture. Huge contrast in what you present as your views and what you broadcast to social media. Being genuine seems a lost art these days.
@URAnonymous1 If you think your page is going to reach out to people on the left and “bring them to the light” by posting shit like this, try again. All this does is churn up people who are already churned up.
@URAnonymous1 How about you focus on the truly centrist dems and maybe call their office and support them in following a centrist agenda. By focusing on the extreme sides of things, you are only churning extremism unnecessarily. We get it. The media is fucked, who are you talking to?
@URAnonymous1 “The other side” shows your world view better than any of the tweets I have. You complain about how us vs them it is and then perpetuate that its some kind of massive war. Disconnected just like the most extreme of them. There are good people on BOTH sides.
@URAnonymous1 Here we go with the extremism. I’ll take no thanks for 100, Alex.
@URAnonymous1 This is just laughable

@URAnonymous1 Prediction is an essential part to analysis and working in politics so I’m sorry you seriously have to be kidding when you say this is an “issue.” It’s part of the joy of analyzing movement and votes.
@URAnonymous1 Oh heaven forbid they do what they have done for as long as I’ve been alive. You don’t want predictions, don’t watch the news. Easy fix.
@URAnonymous1 How about actually trying to solve this division problem by not being a jerk to everyone except Republicans. It starts at the individual level, friend.
@URAnonymous1 Now you give the whole story lol. Looks like cropped for effect, not cute to me or funny. Just unnecessary party vitriol yet again. Why don’t you talk about anything policy related on your page? You’d rather roast all day, how productive.
@URAnonymous1
The test starts now. Are you peaceful and reasonable? Are you really? Let’s all test it and try to be more human and less political robot. As a centrist independent, I literally beg of you. Move America forward.
This is a season for us to come together and pass legislation. I’m sick and tired of the stonewalling and the fighting. I want real progress. And furthermore I believe despite all their flaws, that congress CAN achieve that. We don’t need half of them arrested first...
If we all, for once in the last 2 years, can stfu about this political war, and all just be against extreme views in ANY field. We would be so much better off. If you love Trump so much, heed his words. That it’s time for peace. It is. Stop fighting it with your ideological digs
I have many friends who are all over the place In almost everywhere thinkable. I have friends on all sides of the aisle, of all shapes sizes colors and orientations. I don’t try to force feed them to vote one way, or act one way. I love them. That’s all this world requires.
You may disagree, you of course should always call out extremism. But the idea of painting a broad stroke on people based on one factor alone is WRONG. Period.
In the US, we choose the representatives based on who fits us best. It is the mixing of ideas and cultural influences that make us such a complex, yet wonderful place to live. Attempting to squelch that by using identity and ideological political war is wrong.
Whack jobs now moving on to how all of the house that won getting arrested. I don’t approve of extreme gestures on either side. Some things are best not speculated on. The guilt or innocence of others based on absolutely nothing is not ok on any side of any aisle.
@URAnonymous1 Proof? News story?

@URAnonymous1 https://t.co/SETdTRyxYE

@URAnonymous1 Where’s the link to this?
@URAnonymous1 No. It’s a balanced show that doesn’t choose to sensor the other side of things. They could get centrists but that would make for boring tv. Talk about wanting to be open minded yet wish you could sensor the voice of the left. Makes you no better.
@URAnonymous1 Where’s fucking sessions? Why aren’t y’all upset about all the predictions this outfit had that is still outstanding 2 years later....you all would bow to this fake entity if asked. So sad.
@URAnonymous1 Jesus h Christ here we go with the new false hope obsession.
@URAnonymous1 This is kind of sketchy, what was the question asked leading up to this. Did he outright ask for recommendations? They can do better than this.
@URAnonymous1 This isn’t that. This is feeding things so that now the population can cling to a long lost fantasy about a shit load of people getting arrested. Shameless manipulation and propaganda
@URAnonymous1 It lasted far less than most events such as this in the past. It didn’t adversely affect much and the republicans responded appropriately with an outright rebuke. I don’t agree that the impact was significant enough to change the outcome. That’s the problem with armchair..

@MikeStuchbery_ Also, the fact that liberals are trying to stamp out the right, proves that the right is correct in your push for Violent communism. However, on the right, no one tells you that you can’t have an opinion. When I had my Obama sticker I had eye rolls. But not abuse. This is wrong.
@MikeStuchbery_ I was a liberal, but when I noticed this pattern of violence I distanced myself greatly. The moment you decide you can’t peacefully disagree w/someone, and respect people who have a difference of opinion—that is the moment we descend into chaos. Stop this before it’s too late.
@MikeStuchbery_ It’s loaded because of peoples inaccurate preconceptions about who makes his base up. The left who claims to be so accepting is actually incredibly close minded to the point where they applaud violence against a kid. This cannot continue. You all have to get ahold of yourselves.
@MikeStuchbery_ Translation: I support the abuse of children based on political differences alone........because it’s “offensive.” Better check yourself for real! I’m really concerned when people start condoning violence based on such insignificant reasoning. You’re deplorable, really.

@rk7979 He’s not even really a republican so much as conservative. But some of his policies are libertarian as hell and I’ve loved libertarian ideas since I was 10 so I’m down with most of them.
@rk7979 I don’t get how they don’t know that absolutely because it’s an empirical fact proven over history. No government is one size fits all in any way. Trial and error is key
@rk7979 Exactly. Norway is tiny. And homogenous. And nationalistic. Of which we really aren’t....Nationalistic slightly but they don’t want that anymore either which is silly lol. But it’s not one size fits all. I’ve studied governments a lot, and for liberals to be so academic...
@rk7979 Yeah, I don’t discredit them because so many topics are speculative, but I also don’t embrace them as a source for myself at this time. Perhaps someday, but so far I haven’t been won over...but I respect what they are trying to do. Transparency must come.
@rk7979 But the structure is different, and you can’t ignore that and proclaim that all policies would work here because we don’t have the same fundamentals. Population, economy, everything is different here. We have to fig out what works. No matter the party
@rk7979 Yeah I wrote him in bc I refused to vote for Hillary but I tried to explain to people how some of his policies wouldn’t work. Too many socialist ideas are theoretical. When you use certain policies from a more stable socialist govt, like Norway...you can get ideas from them.
@rk7979 Speculation is something I’m pretty opposed to just because of the way my brain works. So I pay attention to them, but I take it with a grain of salt. It would be an easy place for someone feeble minded to get lost, which makes it iffy for me. Just my honest opinion.
@rk7979 I’ve been around for a few months, I do the research myself. Don’t like the way they do things... I have Aspergers and non linear posts like there’s drive me bonkers. I just go through leaks and docs on my own instead.
@rk7979 I’ve always known theres a lot of BS in the DNC. After Bernie lost I got triggered 😂 after Trump came along, the right embraced change quickly and the left ostracized and oppressed us. I don’t see how the center dems have a place left anymore. And true progressives don’t either
@rk7979 Agreee!!!! They have seeped into everything. Enough is enough!
@rk7979 Exactly! I have never been afraid of opposing ideas and this pinning teams against each other is total BS. Free thought is best because at the heart of it, we are all decent humans and we will grow together by arguing and thinking for ourselves.

The democrats are now the party of lip Service, hysteria, enforced social justice, war, and close mindedness. In under a decade the party has abandoned its principals one by one until only a shell remains, the party filled with Oscar level acting, and yet no ACTION. #notmyparty
Basically, if something goes viral in the media, the Dems will abandon the foundation they are built on in order to ride the wave. Now, if that’s not concerning regarding the direction of this party, I don’t know what is.
Because of one issue(children separated) she’s about to abandon the entire platform of fair but strong borders in favor of Open Borders...a direct contrast to 2014. Instead of fixing the single issue (immigration) which has been part of platform for 20+ years now....
Now, instead of continuing on the issues Americans care about, Hillary decided to go with what she wrongly assumes is the majority of her base...
Hillary Clinton came out strong against illegal immigration and pro strong borders because it echoed the American voice...
Ready for a ride: in 2014, the most honest campaign focus ever was introduced. One of the main hot topics: Illegal Immigration.

@BigSkippy49 @dukesparents @thecjpearson Maybe like 1 of these people per wing or something—added as part of a security plan. Can see that being an accurate preparedness type thing.
@BigSkippy49 @dukesparents @thecjpearson Not a bad idea, but it doesn’t solve the root problem. So while it’s a solution for jobs, and adds some security potentially, i hope it isn’t the view that something like that would actually stop it from even being attempted.
Why are we not talking to the past shooters that are in jail? Surely at least 1 or 2 would be willing to describe how things played out. Empirically we should be able to asses behavioral patterns and figure out the triggers and thus figure out real solutions.
@dukesparents @thecjpearson Teachers just don’t have the kind of mindset needed to be armed and in a security front. That takes away from their teaching, and in HS a kid could possibly wrestle or steal a gun you never know. I just think it makes things unstable potentially. Not what we need.
@dukesparents @thecjpearson I just don’t think it does anything to even help much with the problem. It’s about as significant a fix as outright gun restriction. Yeah it *might* help put a band aid but it won’t actually fix the underlying issue. So it’s gonna continue.
@SchwabePhillip @thecjpearson I’m a musician so I think playing music is one of the most cathartic and therapeutic things to do when you’re angry. Maybe you say some nasty things, but my god get it out. It feels much better to acknowledge and work through anger rather than to bottle it up and feed it.
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson And I had metal detectors at both HS I went to, not sure why that’s not common. I think that should be done STAT.
@SchwabePhillip @thecjpearson We are desensitized by tv, games, music, people, news, and everything in between. This is a cultural issue along with mental health problems. But a lot of the mental health problems would be solved if we’d just stop perpetuating and accessing so much violence all the time.
@SchwabePhillip @thecjpearson Luckily the only video game I like is space invaders lol
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson What are SROs for?! I’ve had an armed one at every school I’ve attended..
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson And furthermore not ignoring the alerts like the FBI did on the last shooting. That was a horrific chain of mishandling. Multiple issues there.
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson Say someone has been acting strange right? Well they have an alert system, kids ready to go buy guns to do this, if we have all channels legally blocked, and they try multiple ways. Then that could alert authorities and teachers to watch the person more. A record of alerts
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson I’m saying maybe the see something say something could be connected to the programs used at legal shops. Like an alert sort of.
@SchwabePhillip @thecjpearson Children are fucking mean. Teach them kindness. That’s my opinion of why this is happening at its core. People have gotten so mean. Everyone, left right upside down, everyone resorts to anger so quickly. We need to learn to communicate and not be afraid of the “weird kid”
@Pridemizzle @dakota295752 @thecjpearson But being able to run to a sporting goods store and be in and out with a GUN? That doesn’t make much sense to me. We need a warning system, something to keep these people from slipping through the cracks. A lot of guns involved were legal. Through family/ bought etc.
@dakota295752 @Pridemizzle @thecjpearson The best way is to help mentally ill children from being so isolated and full of hatred that they resort to this.
@dakota295752 @Pridemizzle @thecjpearson That’s not how the Waffle House guy stopped a shooter. Completely unarmed man.
@dakota295752 @Pridemizzle @thecjpearson I have said NOTHING provocative. Absolutely nothing.
@dakota295752 @Pridemizzle @thecjpearson Multiple shooters have procured guns legally. Don’t pick and choose to support a narrative. Stop being stubborn, I’m not. I’m being very level headed. This is a multifaceted problem.
@realDonaldTrump  I have some real ideas about this school shooting issue. I think I have an idea that would seriously help. BRIGHL09@yahoo.com if you’d like to hear a level headed idea to take on at least one issue exacerbating this situation. Hint: it’s not guns.
Look, y’all gotta give up your party lines on this fight. Stop yelling. This happened today. We don’t even grieve anymore, we just start yelling at each other about how to fix it. Let’s take the rage and use it for good. #stopthemadness #peace #unity #stopthekilling
@dakota295752 @thecjpearson I’m not claiming to be an expert and if some of these are in place, then great.
@dakota295752 @thecjpearson Also, I think gun owners should be REQUIRED to lock their assault weapons up, anything other than a shotgun or handgun shouldn’t be able to be out in the open of a residence.
@dakota295752 @thecjpearson Metal detectors are good. I’m all about that: gun laws that provide common sense restrictions are needed. I’m not talking about banning this or that. We need a heavy vetting. That’s what I’m calling for. None of this in and out in 30 mins crap.
@thecjpearson Now if those 2 teachers want to be armed, go for it. But don’t expect that to stop this from happening. This is systemic. And a symptom of a great problem not solved by MORE guns.
@thecjpearson 5. We need to come together as a community of Americans and stop clapping and screaming our opinions every time something fucking tragic happens. That’s as bad as saying “thoughts and prayers.” Let’s do something, dammit. Im not against anybody trying to figure this out.
@thecjpearson 2. See something say something is a major issue. It must become a thing. 3. Bullying is also a major cause of this. 4 we need major mental health reform focused on rehabilitation and therapy rather than numbing pharma drugs.
@thecjpearson 1. Arming teachers is just plain stupid. Except a tiny percent of them no one needs that stress and is not suited to kill people. These are teachers not police officers.

@thecjpearson Instead of this, how about offer solutions working with liberals? Instead of allowing this to divide us further every time tragedy strikes, where are the solutions? Stricter gun laws are necessary. Nobody talking about taking away anything. But it’s bigger than guns.

Also, for those who thinks he’s so horribly anti this or hater of that....I think his actions and exuding of lightness proves otherwise. Stop being so triggered by comedy, you’re ruining it! He leaves no stone unturned in comedy, which is not new... :) #pccomedysucks
Special was great...If it weren’t for people like @rickygervais we may all be living in bubbles by now, avoiding each other for fear of offending someone..He used the most ridiculous statements in a funny and  unique way, I think it allows us to calm the fuck down. Kudos!
Did Democrats forget the 2004 election and all the controversy and lies Kerry had surrounding him? I was 14 and even I remember how uneasy he made me feel. He’s been crooked. Don’t expect he’s changed the game now.

@TomiLahren The biggest irony of it all, is it (the policy) is freaking Canadian based. The place all these liberals wanted to move to, Maybe they’re just mad because they got denied. 😂😂😂😂
@kylegriffin1 Yes. The establishment politicians let it get that bad. I’m sure it would be a nightmare, to know how horribly they’ve ALL poisoned us for decades. This ain’t a trump issue, this is an America issue. Fuck these crooks in the White House. Republican, Democrat I don’t care.
@kylegriffin1 Uhhhh soooo you should be angry with Obama? Actually...furious. 8 years to fix it?! Nothing was done. Hmmmm 🤔
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti Best of luck, feel better I hope!
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti No worries, easy to get overzealous on social media, I understand.
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti Personal insults are always very telling of a personality. I insulted your logic alone but have no hate to give to you personally. I like to think we can live in a world where we can have legitimately backed differences in opinion. ✌🏻
Dear Social Media Liberals: Are Fox News insults your only defense? Don’t you realize it’s not useable against the left that left? Of course I am not dumb enough to rely on one media source again. That’d be called insanity. #failedlogic #snowflakescantdebate
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti I’ve now accurately denied your innacurate assumptions 2 times....so, enjoy your day. ✌🏻
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti No. I watch ALL news. I collect and analyze data (SPSS, SRSS, Reuters, CNN, et al.) I study government website coverage. I search old government documents. I think it’s called research last I checked. You should try it. #fail
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti No, I just explained that you are actually completely incorrect in your ignorant assumption. So I was being sarcastic...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@ZuZee0910 @MichaelAvenatti You are making us liberals look bad dear. Please do some research into how your establishment media is screwing you over. I’m just trying to help people see truth. Fox News joke does not = a win. ;)
