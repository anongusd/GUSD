Now you know why my wife left me. 	She said she could not live with a man who knew too much, LMAO.ü§™
Before her, they asked grouchy Groucho Marx why he was always happy.	He said he was not. Every morning on awakening, he had to make a conscious decision to be happy and he was.
She went on to say, if you want a Pepsi, do not settle for a coke. If you want a Caddillac, do not settle for a Ford. Get the idea ?
I DONT KNOW ANY OTHER WAY.		Psychologists used to believe that happiness was the choice between equally attractive alternatives until Dr, Joyce Brothers corrected them.	Dr. Brothers defined happiness as getting EXACTLY what you want. https://t.co/Fb3bXb35fj

He took the bait, pulled the newspaper and knocked the criminal code off the table. When he picked it up to return it to my table, he read the title, looked out the window and saw me holding my Swiss knife in my right hand.
I pulled out my trusty Swiss knife and let it dangle on my financier's gold chain, openly exposing the blade. I wandered out the door and watched thru the window pane, smoking a cigarette slowly.
I apologized saying I did not know he could read. He glared at me. I glared back at him with a slight smile. He huffed and puffed as he returned to his table. I set up a trap for him. I opened my newspaper and placed  my copy of Martin's Criminal Code on it.
Here is how to deal with bullies:	I was reading my morning Globe and Mail at Starbucks [ I know, I know } when a 300 pound moron approached me. He told me I was taking an awful long time to read my personally purchased newspaper. Can I hurry it up so he could read it?

What the Hell are you doing begging on the street? You're an advertising genius.	I listened as he told me how he lost his business partner, his business, his wife and children, his home, his car, his furniture. You poor man, I told him as I handed him a hundred dollar bill.
My lawyer said it could not be done. I insisted he do it or I would find me a law firm that could. Lawyers are supposed to carry out their client's instructions.	Six months later, I encounter the plaintiff on a street corner w ith his hat held out for money begging. I said: HEY.
My litigation lawyer discovered that the plaintiff had been double billing me for development costs over five years. He offered to make a phone call to put the adversary in jail. I said no. He would only learn to be a better fraudster there.	I ordered him to be made homeless.
They teach one in law school the importance of one word, even a period or a comma. The last person who called me wacko decades ago got stuck with a million dollar advertising bill I refused to pay. He sued me and then things got interesting. https://t.co/NClJVS4iYI

Now YOU, you let me go in first as if I'm alone. Then YOU enter and your eyes scan the room for lechers. Without saying a single word, you let men know that I am YOUR woman. And nobody dares to say otherwise under pain of death.
You dunno, she asked me ? Nein, I replied. Well, before I met you, I would walk into a bar and all mens' jaws would drop. So I looked to my date for protection and they all just looked up at the ceiling. Useless wimps.
She was 6 foot 2 inches tall and I'm only 5 foot ten.  She made me look like a Mafioso entering a restaurant. So I asked her over scotch one day what she was doing with a shrimp like me. Her answer told me who I was.

President Nixon devalued the US dollar by 90 % when he freed the price of gold from $35 an ounce. Nobody even noticed. So why not do it again and reduce the National Debt by 90 % ? Get it ? Probably not.  High finance.
The resulting lack of general confidence will destroy stock values on the international stock markets and both house and stock prices will be halved.	Hoard LOONIES and TWOONIES. Do not trust gold as it is overpriced.
I predict a major crash and depression late this year or early next year. We have not experienced such powerful economic forces since 1929. The housing bubble will burst, people will not pay mortgages with principals greater than house market values, no new buyers so KAPUT https://t.co/PVj67SnXcQ
