@sendavidperdue I have a hard time taking you seriously David. You either:	A. Are an idiot	B. Believe that your followers are idiots	C. Are a corrupt, pathetic pawn of corporate greed	D. All of the above
Hey @letskeepitcivil - thanks for the follow!
Significant change is only possible with great upheaval, and we’ve certainly got that. But the journey is scary as hell. Here’s to the day when we’ve all had enough and begin working together to build a better tomorrow. 		The End of the Two-Party System https://t.co/m8ecsIx3yc
@RadioFreeTom Thanks (once again) for standing up for reason. With so many people on both sides looking for any reason to find the worst in one another, please keep inserting civility into every corner of the internet.
@RedTRaccoon Let’s not get too worked up here: you may not like the perceived connotation of “Anglo-American.” But keep in mind “Sheriff” is an English creation - a tradition that the US continues. Also consider that the term is also routinely used in Supreme Court decisions.

@pk_humann @USATODAY Not disagreeing with the fact that it is a Muslim nation, but labeling the article as “this Muslim nation” is a click-bait tactic that plays on prejudice.
@USATODAY This is cheap, gross promotion. Not journalism. “This Muslim Nation”...?Really? You couldn’t have just said Pakistan? 		You’re debasing yourself for clicks, and your insinuation promotes prejudice. 		Purposefully googled article to ID the country. Not rewarding you another click!
@RepMarkMeadows Because this is classified material, Mark. And it’s incomplete and misleading. We’re not nearly as dumb and gullible as you must believe. Either put ALL the information out there (once it has been scrubbed) or be quiet.
Empowering the vote and the voter is only possible when we strip away the corrupt incentives and level the field. https://t.co/F9t6CRffty

I agree with Geoffrey. Our voices will be heard. https://t.co/XZcLDPFSKZ

@iElijahManley Unfortunately your website is down. So, would you mind sharing your views on common core?
@iElijahManley Hi Elijah, I enjoy your passion, but I’m interested to know what your qualifications are that qualify you to effectively work on the school board? Pedagogy and education funding are complex issues (not talking points) that deserve deep consideration and extensive knowledge.
@UnitersCentrist @Sen_JoeManchin @Sen_JoeManchin hit it right on the head. If the Senate can't work together, we all lose. Thankfully there are voices on the inside that are beginning to echo those of us in the center. The blame game has to end:	https://t.co/uSjurJuurF

@GuardianRover Well said. Thanks for offering a voice of reason.
@iElijahManley Alright Elijah, help me out here. I’m interested in hearing how you view the interplay between capitalism and globalization. From an economic definition of globalization it seems to me they rely on one another more than contradict.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @brianstelter @jackiewattles Well quite simply: They need to ask questions and report their findings honestly and COMPLETELY. Unfortunately selective reporting and the creep of subjective views into news stories has led to a pretty severe (and somewhat justified) skepticism of this type of news.

@JenandZen I’m interested to hear more on your take regarding hating those similar to oneself more than the “other”? Seems pretty different than the evidence I see in the world.
@UnitersCentrist I think the differentiating point here is that you can have all the issue you want with the challenges of globalization, but scapegoating the “other” is definitely a misdirected frustration. However - it is an easy target and, as we’ve seen, a common cry for nationalists.
@WalshFreedom @jaketapper This interview was the epitome of our hyper-partisan world. Each playing to their base. Condescension and cheap shots from both sides. Unanswered questions. Uninspired questions. No discussion of policy. Emotions run high and civility dies. Both sides declare victory. Zero Stars.

@MelissaJPeltier @lauferlaw Well said @MelissaJPeltier. Prudence is a virtue.
@JRubinBlogger Insightful. My question is: at what point might it become more personally and politically advantageous for members of the GOP to stand against the President?
@jadimas @Evan_McMullin I agree. We need to stand up for reason and vote for candidates who will put country before party.

Well said @lauferlaw. Divisiveness has become too easy. But, there's a difficult line between resisting and defending. We must use objective reason to defend the truth from hyper-partisanship and avoid buying into the convenient, "morally"-charged arguments. https://t.co/3Xh7zLoNWy
