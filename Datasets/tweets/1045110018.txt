@EPAoig @epaig @EPA @SenDuckworth The Lead and Copper Rule, which failed #Flint families, has not been updated in more than 25 years. 		It is unacceptable that the Trump Administration continues to delay action to update this regulation, which would reduce lead in drinking water.
@EPAoig @epaig @EPA I also continue to push for Congress to pass my legislation, the NO LEAD Act, which would update the outdated federal Lead and Copper Rule to better protect public health. @SenDuckworth also introduced this legislation in the Senate. https://t.co/a0ifNhEQnO
@EPAoig @epaig After the crisis, I pushed Congress to pass the Kildee-Upton law. This bipartisan piece of legislation, signed into law by President Obama, requires the @EPA to immediately notify the public after learning of high levels of lead in drinking water. https://t.co/Oc9hWydLI4
@EPAoig I called for an @EPAIG investigation into what went wrong during the #FlintWaterCrisis so that we know how to prevent a similar crisis from happening again.
As I have said before, the #FlintWaterCrisis was a failure of government at every level.		Justice for Flint families comes in many forms, and the release of the @EPAoig report today is one way to hold those responsible accountable.
Today, we celebrate Nelson Mandela‚Äîan incredible &amp; courageous leader. His perseverance in the face of oppression inspired me and millions around the world. Through it all, his dedication to peace and justice persisted, showing us that hope and love will win. https://t.co/LPXWPLk9jH

The American people deserve judges and #SupremeCourt justices that act independently &amp; respect the rule of law. Judge Kavanaugh was hand-picked by the far-right @FedSoc and is a threat to affordable health care and women's reproductive rights.

@Bethany @DHSgov @HHSGov A federal judge ordered the Trump Administration to reunite children with their families by July 10th (if under 5-years-old) or July 26th (if over the age of 5). @DHSgov &amp; @HHSGov must prioritize the reunification of families to meet these deadlines.
@Bethany @DHSgov @HHSGov On our tour, @Bethany told me that these children who have been separated from their families are experiencing high levels of trauma. The youngest kid I saw today was just 6 mos. old.
@Bethany @DHSgov @HHSGov So far a handful, but clearly not a majority, of the children at @Bethany have been reunited with their families. They are currently working to reunite families with little direction or resources from the Trump Administration. There is little urgency from @HHSgov and @DHSgov.
@Bethany With that said, I remain concerned that the Trump Administration‚Äîincl. @DHSgov &amp; @HHSGov‚Äîdoes not have a coherent plan to quickly reunite children with their families. Facilities like @Bethany are receiving little or no direction from the federal govt. regarding reunification.

.@EPAScottPruitt blocked this study because it would be a ‚Äúpublic relations nightmare.‚Äù Now that it is out, we learned that PFAS is more dangerous than the EPA says it is.

We shouldn't congratulate @RealDonaldTrump on being forced to end his own cruel policy that separates children from their families. Thousands of children have suffered &amp; will forever be scarred by the Trump Administration‚Äôs inhumane separation of families. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Today is #WorldRefugeeDay. The UN Refugee Agency estimates that half the world‚Äôs refugees are children and the way we treat children is a clear mark on our nation's values. President Trump must end his zero-tolerance, child separation policy immediately. #KeepFamiliesTogether
New report shows that health care premiums will skyrocket under #GOPTaxScam. By the numbers:		-$701: average tax cut for working family	$1,520: average premium increase due to Republican repeal of individual mandate		= Michigan families lose, paying $819 more out-of-pocket.

Happy Birthday, @RepTedDeutch! Proud to fight with you to reduce gun violence in America.
4,394,173 Michiganders live with a pre-existing condition. If #Trumpcare had become law, they would have faced discrimination and higher costs. We must work together to expand access to care and lower costs for working families.
Today marks one year since the @HouseGOP tried to push through their dangerous #Trumpcare legislation, which would have kicked millions of Americans off of their health care while raising premiums for other families. https://t.co/ai4AGwqIFR
.@RepHanabusa, Happy Birthday! Grateful for your work protecting our public lands and natural resources.
Harmful PFAS chemicals have been found around military installations across the U.S., contaminating drinking water. Congress recently authorized funds to clean up these areas and the Defense Department must do more to ensure clean drinking water. https://t.co/18i8BFfMMr
On #WorldPressFreedomDay, we celebrate the First Amendment and freedom of the press. Let us also honor the journalists who lost their lives doing their jobs. A free press is crucial to our democracy.

Our first question was from Minnie in Flint. She wanted to know how this bill could affect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 		Unfortunately if this bill passes, the #GOPTaxScam could force huge cuts to these programs, affecting your benefits.

Trump has so far fired:	‚ÜíChief of staff	‚ÜíChief strategist	‚ÜíNat Security Adviser	‚Üí2x Comms Directors	‚ÜíPress Sec	‚ÜíFBI director		#chaos

@POTUS .@POTUS must work with Congress to renegotiate #NAFTA. Our workers deserve #ABetterDeal not a secret one. 6/6
@POTUS Only a transparent process can ensure a fair trade deal with strong, enforceable provisions protecting workers, not corporations. 5/x
@POTUS For far too long, trade deals have benefited corporations. Workers deserve a fair share of the wealth created by their labor. 4/x
@POTUS .@POTUS must open up the #NAFTA renegotiation process. Details matter and American workers need a seat at the table. 3/x
@POTUS I come from Flint, who knows all too well the negative consequences of bad trade deals like #NAFTA that were negotiated in secret. 2/x

As Americans can't we all agree that we should stand shoulder-to-shoulder together against foreign powers trying to influence our elections?
It is not normal (or ok) for an American presidential campaign to be colluding with Russia, a known foreign adversary, to swing an election.

@POTUS @PPFA Simply put, GOP #HealthcareBill is heartless. 		If you want to read the whole bill for yourself, link is here: https://t.co/cwYYYukjP4
@POTUS @PPFA 6) Huge tax breaks for wealthy. GOP #HealthcareBill is a massive giveaway to those at the very top (while you get worse health care) https://t.co/I2vzSmV5Mo
@POTUS @PPFA 5) ends cost-sharing subsidies (meaning higher costs for you. Individuals &amp; families will likely forgo care b/c they can't afford it) https://t.co/q3lB3lYSeu
@POTUS 4) Defunds @PPFA. More than 90% of care they provide is preventive (breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, HIV tests &amp; birth control) https://t.co/l4TN93jdPm
@POTUS 3) in addition to deep cuts, GOP #HealthCareBill turns Medicaid into block grant program. 		"block grant" = underfunded https://t.co/KrgbqpTvus
2) slashes Medicaid (@POTUS promised during campaign he wouldn't do this). About 1.75 million Michiganders on Medicaid. 1 million are kids. https://t.co/ONM4Thky22
