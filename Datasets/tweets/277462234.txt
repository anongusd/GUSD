RT @philwillon: This is less than ideal ... https://t.co/0wHfCugEsQ
@MarySueSays @Delafina777 Yeah, for me it was Xanth, Belgariad and the Shannara books. At least Terry Brooks seems like a not terrible person. Right? Right!?
@Delafina777 Thanks for this. Belgariad/Mallorean was a childhood fave. Also Xanth. God, I had a lot of terrible childhood faves. 		Anyway, much as I loved the series', the ideas they espoused are repulsive.  And you make a good point about how he sugars the pill with snappy writing.
Thread. The Belgariad was the book series that got me to love reading, but it definitely peddles some awful ideas. Besides the racial stereotypes, there's an instance where one of the heroes admits to committing spousal rape and his victim is told by a woman to get over it. https://t.co/Q9eCqybrIw

@bethytrain @APStylebook Sure. Dead-naming is when an entity uses a trans person's name given at birth, rather than the name they've chosen for themselves as part of the transition process. The old name is often called the dead name, because the person with that name doesn't, and never really did, exist.

@cavcrusader @FoxNews @DailyCaller @realDailyWire @CalPoly A student wearing blackface isn't racial? In what universe? I suggest you look up the history of minstrel shows and blackface. It is absolutely racial. 		Not taking the bait on our newsroom. We could stand to be more diverse, but we are also not a publicly funded university.
@cavcrusader @FoxNews @DailyCaller @realDailyWire @CalPoly Also, it's hard not to bring up race when when you have repeat instances of blackface and the dissemination of white supremacist fliers and graffiti.
@cavcrusader @FoxNews @DailyCaller @realDailyWire @CalPoly Because it's a serious demographic outlier to the rest of the state and even the university acknowledges that fact. If you don't see the problem of a university being disproportionately white in a state that very much isn't then I don't think there's anything more to talk about.
@cavcrusader @FoxNews @DailyCaller @realDailyWire @CalPoly Fox reported that Cal Poly was intentionally reducing white student enrollment and that's patently, provably false.
