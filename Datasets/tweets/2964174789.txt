I believe we can strike the right balance between being compassionate‚Äîespecially towards children who were brought here through no fault of their own‚Äîand also being smart by taking steps needed to prevent future illegal immigration. (3/3)
Our nation is long-overdue for commonsense immigration reform, particularly when it comes to providing a path to naturalization for DACA recipients and securing our borders. (2/3)
We should not be separating children migrants from their families. Congress can take action to provide better long-term certainty and consistency on this issue in a way that does not incentivize unauthorized border crossings. (1/3)
