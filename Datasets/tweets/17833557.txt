@Peters_Glen @RBrulle @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @TKKalliokoski @GretaThunberg @pepcanadell @Peters_Glen when you say, "This thinking is the problem," to what are you referring?		I believe the 'problem' is that we're putting too much carbon into the atmosphere. The thinking that you're criticizing is pointing out a fossil fuel alternative is generally making that worse.
@Peters_Glen @RBrulle @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @TKKalliokoski @GretaThunberg @pepcanadell When thinking of carbon emissions and bioenergy, why get distracted by management of the forest from which it came? It's a red herring.		If carbon in a forest is up due to regrowth, great, but that's not to the credit of bioenergy. Bioenergy is just skimming off the net C gains.
@Peters_Glen @RBrulle @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @TKKalliokoski @GretaThunberg @pepcanadell If 'the rules' regulate and impose fees on fossil fuel emissions but not on bioenergy emissions, which are almost always higher (lower energy density + land use impacts) then yeah, actually, I'd say all that unregulated biomass could be assumed to be bad until proven otherwise.
@RBrulle @Peters_Glen @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @TKKalliokoski @GretaThunberg @pepcanadell The bioenergy emissions loophole is practically fixable. So far it has proven politically unfixable.
@Peters_Glen @RBrulle @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @TKKalliokoski @GretaThunberg @pepcanadell It’s broadly sensible to count bioenergy emissions in ‘land use.’ (Can’t double count.) The problem is energy sector emissions are regulated and tracked; but not so for land use. So bioenergy hides energy emissions by shifting them from a regulated sector into an unregulated one.

@jmcurtin @Peters_Glen @RBrulle @TKKalliokoski @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @GretaThunberg When you use genuine wood waste as fuel for bioenergy, instead of trees harvested for the purpose, the climate calculation changes. I've seen this at small scales through the U.S. (very small power plants sited at mills) but have never reported on what's happening in Sweden.
@Peters_Glen @RBrulle @TKKalliokoski @KevinClimate @DrEPihl @GretaThunberg These are talking points.		You're taking trees that would store and continue to absorb C in the absence of a bioenergy industry, and putting their stored C into the atmosphere — followed by pine replanting / hardwood regeneration that would continue to absorb C.		It's a net loss.

Looking for the main climate change impacts in your region?		This shows how the regions are carved up for chapters 18 through 27 of the #NationalClimateAssessment. https://t.co/TbzFEuOBSg https://t.co/daPcV4WRTn
Step 4. Publish the story, then stay on it as you return to Step 2 for another.		By this point you'll be doing more than just localizing an important climate report. You'll be incorporating one of humanity’s great challenges into your coverage.
Remember: Science deniers are liars. Don’t publish or broadcast lies.
Hint: Climate change alone rarely 'creates' a problem. Normally it compounds risks from an existing problem, like flooding or wildfire. And those risks are often compounded by other factors, like homebuilding in areas prone to flood or burn.		Don’t fear this nuance — explain it.
Hint: Include a paragraph or so explaining climate change, including why it’s happening and how it's being addressed. Don't assume this is widely understood — many now take "climate change" to be something political.		Here are some examples from Climate Central joint coverage. https://t.co/814pvLbXyv
Step 3. Produce a story about what you found. Describe the local climate change impact and efforts to adapt. What will happen in the future? What impacts could we avoid? Include info from #NCA4 as well as other sources. Mention other climate impacts if you want, but stay focused.
How? Interview local scientists, community and business groups and elected and government officials. Knock on doors (it's tough but pays off). Submit records requests, analyze data. Attend meetings. Search for sources via @AdaptationForum committee lists. https://t.co/SDoYWhNil9
Step 2. Investigate the impact. (#NCA4 ch 3 thru 17 cover specific topics — read any relevant ones. Ch 28 explains adaptation.)		How are people being affected? What’s being done to help? Is funding allocated sensibly? Are poor neighborhoods excluded? Are residents being informed?
Examples: After reading the “Southwest” chapter, which covers California, a Bay Area reporter might investigate causes of worsening wildfires. A producer in Raleigh may focus on heavy rains. An ag beat reporter in Wisconsin could investigate agricultural pests and rising temps.
Step 1. Read the National Climate Assessment chapter from 18 through 27 that corresponds with your region. These chapters describe regional impacts. Pick an impact that's important in your local area. Investigate it. https://t.co/TbzFEuOBSg
Hint: Let the National Climate Assessment guide you to a story, but your story needn’t be *about* the report or *about* climate change.		A good local climate story is more specific and visceral than that. Rich with context and characters, it's about impacts, solutions and change.
Goal: Investigate efforts to adapt to a local climate change impact. (If you focus only on the impact you'll miss most of the story.)		Whatever you find will be important. Publicly funded adaptation work may be backfiring, or a local initiative may have saved lives during a fire.
(I’m a science journalist with a local news background. I work at @ClimateCentral, a non-advocacy science and news group. During the past year we’ve produced joint local climate science stories with @pnj, @delawareonline, @KQED, @IdahoStatesman, @TucsonStar, @OPB_Sci_Env &amp; more.)
The new federal climate report was released while many journalists were off work.		From a local news perspective, that’s fine. For local climate coverage, in-depth is better than fast.

If it wasn't already obvious why Trump admin dropped huge climate report on Black Friday, read Ch. 29. It explains how to ease the crisis by "replacing conventional, CO2-emitting fossil fuel energy technologies or systems with low- or zero-emissions ones." https://t.co/GiGRhxXpeR
The National Climate Assessment contains an exhaustive chapter explaining how to adapt to climate change, providing real-world examples and noting that "adaptation actions in the United States have increased" — but that much more work is needed. https://t.co/gQNDMk9w6N https://t.co/E87F4CDcrG
What can we do?		More, more, more.		Americans, governments and businesses are tackling climate change by reducing pollution and adapting to changes, but #NCA4 says the work doesn't “yet approach the scale considered necessary to avoid substantial damages.” https://t.co/DopC59OHyD
Warming damages coastal cities, tourism and businesses. “Even in a future with lower greenhouse gas emissions, many communities are expected to suffer financial impacts as chronic high-tide flooding leads to higher costs and lower property values.” — #NCA4 https://t.co/DVmTwzn3Kx
Climate change is truly horrible for farmers.		The National Climate Assessment warns livestock health problems, declines in yields and extreme weather changes here and abroad “threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security, and price stability.” https://t.co/wusPfuIdr8
Even as we have to get better at coping with floods, we have to learn to use less water.		Warming puts more pressure on overburdened water systems, “increasing risks and costs to agriculture, energy production, industry, recreation, and the environment.” https://t.co/EPtNflEK19
We have to overhaul America’s aging and deteriorating infrastructure. #NCA4 warns of strains from climate change, with “potential for cascading impacts that threaten our economy, national security, essential services, and health and well-being.” — #NCA4 https://t.co/Kxbzkn0uSN
Climate change hurts life’s capacity to sustain itself. New federal report warns of “transformative impacts on some ecosystems” unless serious efforts are made to slow warming. It notes some coral reef and sea ice ecosystems are already being devastated. https://t.co/Jc9y5tmZjG
It’s about money as well as wellbeing.		Without “substantial and sustained” work to slow pollution and adapt to changes underway, #NCA4 says warming will “cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth.” https://t.co/WToZ66XjkN
Climate change is an unholy injustice. The new National Climate Assessment says its impacts will “increasingly disrupt Indigenous peoples’ livelihoods and economies, including agriculture and agroforestry, fishing, recreation, and tourism.” https://t.co/DJmzHEySEu
Warming is making us sicker by reducing air quality, aiding disease transmission, fueling disasters and in other ways, #NCA4 notes.		“Older adults, children, low-income communities, and some communities of color are often disproportionately affected.” https://t.co/99YpI8pF6R
Climate change is a threat we brought on ourselves and are making worse through inaction.		#NCA4 notes impacts are already being felt in communities across the U.S., threatening “human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.” https://t.co/hQuVsZmbnY
"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify." https://t.co/zj3EvabIad
Three hints for journalists covering #NCA4:	1. Impacts are felt locally. Look at chapters 18 through 27 for main regional impacts.	2. Don’t let Trump rush you with a Black Friday release. Climate stories need to be told properly.	3. Science deniers are liars. Don’t publish lies.
The #NationalClimateAssessment, cynically released by Trump Admin on Black Friday, shows Americans are becoming aware of climate change and starting to tackle it — but too slowly to protect humanity from unimaginable dangers.		Key takeaways threaded here. https://t.co/TbzFEuOBSg

@KieranSuckling @USATODAY My disinterest in biodiversity?		Goodnight, douchebag. Feel free to ping me when you sober up.
@KieranSuckling @USATODAY I'm not sure why you would expect me to be able to answer this question. Maybe try a linguist? Or a sociologist? Anthropologist? Peter Singer may have thoughts.		I'm too busy trying to keep up with your countless inebriated tweets at me to figure this out for you right now.
@KieranSuckling This is some D-Grade, overwrought, possibly intoxicated straw man bullshit.		These two things are simultaneously true:	1. The article and press release headlines were deceptive.	2. Caring is not a zero sum sum game whereby concern for other creatures lessens concern for humans.
@KieranSuckling You of all people should not pretend to believe that impassioned experts write all their own publicity material. https://t.co/Y54Jkv5g4o
@KieranSuckling @USATODAY When the headline writers for the USA Today story and press release referred to 'male fertility,' they were implying that they were referring to male human fertility.		They don't care about biodiversity.		I'm surprised to have to explain this to you on this website at this hour.
@KieranSuckling @Revkin You may pretend to not understand this, but that's not what the authors of the headlines of the press release or USA Today story wanted us to think.
@KieranSuckling I'd say it's adorable that you think the press release and USA Today article were written out of concern for beetle populations and were crafted to inform on biodiversity and climate change.		Except that I don't believe your counterfeit naivety.

@CNiebling If you want to imagine that Donald Trump wants to help landowners do the right thing by restoring ecologically resilient conditions in forests suffering from decades of fire suppression, you're welcome to do so.		He strikes me as more of a corporate clear-cut kind of guy.
When you allow logging, loggers take the biggest trees — the trees that are most resilient to forest fires. What you leave behind are the shrubs, saplings and other plants that catch fire. California is trying to reduce this fuel through more prescribed burns, but it's expensive.
Overnight Trump addressed the fires killing and displacing Californians.		No sympathy; no support. Just a threatening reiteration of his vague and cockamamy contention that forests should be logged to prevent forest fires. https://t.co/de9QzCxize

Want to understand Trump's call to "tree clear to stop fire spreading?"		Read this👇🏼. The Resilient Federal Forests Act is a cynical attempt to circumvent environmental protections to promote logging "in the name of making forests 'resilient' to fire." https://t.co/y2NvXT4D8j
If you ask the logging industry how to solve an environmental problem, it'll answer, 'More logging.' That's where Trump was coming from with his "tree clear to stop fire spreading" comment.		The water part of that tweet was unrelated, adapted from @westlands_water talking points.
@realDonaldTrump You should ask scientists and fishermen what they think. https://t.co/ZkbE70TD2M
The president would like us to forget that his favored industries are stoking wildfires by belching out pollution.		The science has been clear for years. By increasing temperatures and drying out landscapes, climate change is blowing up wildfire risks. https://t.co/A4VUW4uCiL
Diverting more Delta water for farmers of almonds and other exported California crops (which is what Trump is endorsing, without coming out and saying it) means less water for fish.		Salmon need more water, and they need it in more places. https://t.co/NxDLrw74iC
Research shows the need for more prescribed burns to remove flammable undergrowth. They're guided by models that predict the spread of fires and smoke. "You can either do it on your terms, or you wait for that wildfire to come and it does it on its terms." https://t.co/s2aHXsz6XQ
1. Water left in rivers that reaches the Pacific supports salmon and fishing. That's unrelated to fires.	2. Clearing forests is not a fire solution. Wildfires would be safer if overgrowth was removed. That's most effectively done through controlled burns, which requires funding. https://t.co/9mBC6ieh9d

Takeaway from @qz reporter who has spent a lot of time investigating potential technologies for drawing heat-trapping pollution from atmosphere:		"Trying for carbon capture is better than not trying, esp when EU wouldn't rethink biomass carbon neutrality." https://t.co/tH1mFBR3JY
This @qz piece by @AkshatRathi contains more technical information than I've seen elsewhere about the newly announced efforts underway in Britain to catch carbon dioxide released from the burning of wood at Drax power plant. https://t.co/fERHq45dld
As @Draxnews joins forces in a £400,000 series of experiments to catch carbon dioxide released as wood is burned for energy, here's how it and similar power plants, which are heavily subsidized in Europe as "green," are hurting forests and the climate. https://t.co/EekpRfNDSF
The idea of growing and burning plants for power then burying the CO2 is regarded as one of the great technological hopes for reversing global warming. But the research on "BECCS" shows it would be wildly expensive and harmful. https://t.co/wNtyPETTNq
As western Europe’s biggest power plant burns through American forests to produce coal-free energy, worsening climate change, it has long used promises of “#BECCS” as greenwash. Here’s what happened last time — shortly after this puff piece came out: https://t.co/tLIsbi4tZg https://t.co/w7NqUwK8qw
RT @adamvaughan_uk: @johnupton Drax doesn't know yet who will take the the CO2, which will be stored on its site. So as you say, not necess…
If CO2 is captured by a power plant, that doesn’t necessarily mean it'll be locked out of the atmosphere — that’s extra cost. CO2 may be used to aid in fracking, or other industrial processes, as highlighted in Drax graphic (note “storage + utilization”). https://t.co/7RAbUWGaTw https://t.co/JFlBO5XlaS
As you read vague news about @Draxnews planning a pilot project to test a solvent that may aid in the capture and storage of CO2 from burning wood, remember that this is a company that has been fundamentally dishonest for years about its climate impacts. https://t.co/RRW4rCkJLP
Amid hoopla about @Draxnews's plans to dabble with "BECCS" (burning plant growth for energy, then burying some of the carbon pollution), technical details about pilot aren't available — they're proprietary. Some details may be announced at @IEAGHG 14 in Melbourne in October.
Greenhouse gas emissions spiked at western Europe's largest power plant after it began swapping out coal for wood (most of it from the U.S.).		Now @Draxnews plans to begin capturing a "miniscule fraction" of that pollution in pilot carbon capture project. https://t.co/6qqasenOIx
