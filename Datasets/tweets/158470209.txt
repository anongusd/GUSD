Majority Leader McConnell’s decision to toss aside Senate traditions and override objections from both of the nominee’s home state senators sets an extremely dangerous precedent. https://t.co/zKVJAAvG1s

Andrew Wheeler’s record as Acting @EPA Chief is clear: he has been another champion for the special interests and President Trump’s harmful agenda, not protecting the environment. https://t.co/Lhwafk1S2f

The lack of affordable, quality child care is a national crisis, not only impacting working parents, but our entire economy. Along with my colleague, Rep. @BobbyScott, I’m introducing the Child Care for Working Families Act today to help address this crisis. #ChildCare4All
The #TitleX gag rule would prevent doctors from offering a full range of reproductive health options to the millions of women who trust them to provide the care and services they need. https://t.co/puOyI8XRHM

The concerns I have about the Education Department under Secretary DeVos’ tenure continue to grow every day. We urgently need answers about the Department’s questionable actions. https://t.co/47hTt9J3Rg
The #FakeTrumpEmergency sets an extremely dangerous precedent. Presidents should not be able to circumvent the will of Congress and violate the separation of powers to get their way.

I believe that high-quality, affordable child care should be within reach for every single family in this country. Are you with me? RT if you support my #ChildCare4All plan. https://t.co/skgfRVDW3D
The #FakeTrumpEmergency is the latest example of shocking behavior from President Trump -- he’s not getting what he wants through Congress, and he’s willing to flout the law &amp; Constitution to get it.
All Americans who believe in our Constitution should be outraged by President Trump’s fake emergency. It’s an abuse of power, plain and simple. https://t.co/fGopWhAne9
I’m proud of the #ChildCare4All bill I’m introducing with Rep. @BobbyScott because we should be doing everything we possibly can to ensure child care is within reach for every family. https://t.co/E17CmpW7Ia
Not only will #ChildCare4All benefit families, it will jumpstart our economy, sending 1.6M parents back to work, creating 770K jobs &amp; ensuring child care workers are paid at least a livable wage.
There is no reason high-qualify, affordable child care shouldn’t be a reality for every family. The Child Care for Working Families Act, which I’m introducing with Rep. @BobbyScott, will boost our economy by ensuring each &amp; every family can access child care. #ChildCare4All
The #FakeTrumpEmergency is an outrageous abuse of power, and an attempt to circumvent Congress after we explicitly rejected President Trump’s border wall. We can’t let this stand.
Too many families are struggling to make ends meet because parents are forced to spend so much of their income on child care. It’s time for us to change that. #ChildCare4All

Not only does the #FAMILYAct guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave, it reflects the modern definition of a family and covers every working man and woman in America equally. https://t.co/Za4BlHy1XA
Congress passed a bipartisan compromise that rejected the President’s wasteful border wall. Democrats &amp; many Republicans agree we should invest in smart border security &amp; address humanitarian concerns, but there is no “emergency” &amp; no justification for President Trump’s actions.
President Trump should not have the option to declare an emergency every time he doesn’t get his way. This is an unprecedented, un-American violation of the separation of powers.
I’m horrified that President Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall -- the border wall the majority of Americans oppose &amp; Congress rejected. https://t.co/5ax9CVPXmp
I’m glad we could come together in a bipartisan way to permanently reauthorize the #LWCF, which is responsible for thousands of conservation projects in WA &amp; across the nation. https://t.co/auc8eRHW6d

President Trump isn’t backing down from his agenda of divisiveness and dysfunction, which means we’ve got to fight back harder than ever to defend workers and families. #SOTU https://t.co/9HkUCA5gqP
Despite his claims, President Trump’s actions are making health care more expensive, politicizing women’s health, &amp; giving tax cuts to the wealthy at workers’ expense. His shutdown played politics w/ livelihoods of workers &amp; his wasteful border wall would cost taxpayers billions.
Tonight’s #SOTU was a giant step in the wrong direction. We now know with even more certainty that we can’t count on President Trump to make progress for the American people. It’s up to us to fight back against the Trump agenda and get this country that we love back on track.
People in WA and across the nation are sick &amp; tired of this reality show presidency. After the #SOTU tonight, it’s clearer than ever that President Trump is continuing to pander to extreme base of his party rather than work on policies that help families.
In tonight’s #SOTU, instead of offering a new vision for coming together and ending the chaos in D.C., President Trump chose to double down on his agenda of divisiveness and dysfunction.
I want to hear from you about the real state of our union. Share your thoughts about the critical problems and solutions you’d like to hear in the president’s #SOTU address. https://t.co/lzP9ZyJt1N
The completely unnecessary government shutdown, the attempts to force American taxpayers to pay for his wasteful wall, the shameful attempts to take away health care from families, the dysfunction and conflicts of interest in his cabinet, and the list goes on and on.
While President Trump is expected to claim that the state of our union is strong in his presidential address tonight, I’ve heard from so many of you about how the chaos and dysfunction in D.C. is hurting your families, your communities, and our country’s future.

800,000 workers who still haven’t been paid are waiting on Republicans to finally do the right thing and end the #TrumpShutdown. The GOP could open the government again tomorrow. https://t.co/hApS5ZVpkl
There are many awful consequences to the #TrumpShutdown. This is another one that’s simply unconscionable -- millions of people could lose their homes if this madness continues. https://t.co/G0i07PxGbK
It's beyond unacceptable that the #TrumpShutdown may cause our fire safety officials to be unprepared for the upcoming wildfire season. This is a risk we just can't afford to take. https://t.co/asBqVQB9qo
As the #TrumpShutdown drags on with no end in sight, even more families are finding themselves struggling with food insecurity and turning to local food banks to put food on the table. https://t.co/YLjzvrHeLC
Republican leaders still haven’t ended the shameful #TrumpShutdown. Thousands of hard working people in my state of Washington and hundreds of thousands more across the country are still in limbo, many unable to even pay the rent or buy basic necessities like food.
I believe when women are stronger, our country is stronger, and I’m going to keep fighting every day to make sure women’s health and rights are protected under Roe v. Wade. #Roe46
46 years after the Supreme Court’s historic #RoeVWade decision guaranteed a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices, we’re continuing to fight back with all we have against those who seek to chip away at our health &amp; rights. #ReproRights #Roe46 https://t.co/D2OcBsBFdY
“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” - Dr. King. Service projects are happening across the country this #MLKDay to honor Dr. King’s legacy. I hope you join in serving others today.
New information shows the Trump Administration’s cruel family separation policy may have been even worse than reported, separating thousands more children from their parents. I'm still demanding answers for the families impacted by this heartless policy. https://t.co/kd7upI5PoQ
If Republicans really care about people with pre-existing conditions, it’s time for them to join us to #ProtectOurCare and defend the health care protections that millions of Americans rely on.
Instead of taking action to end the #TrumpShutdown, Senate Republicans attacked women’s health care and tried to ban abortion coverage this week. Now that we’ve defeated this measure, can Republicans finally call a vote to reopen the government? https://t.co/zzqsiIxQUX
Our federal workers shouldn’t be forced to use their retirement savings to pay bills. Republicans need to end the #TrumpShutdown and ensure these hard working Americans get paid again. https://t.co/LYENVPcqiC
Hundreds of thousands of families are still being held hostage by the #TrumpShutdown. I’m continuing to call on Leader McConnell, Senate Republicans, &amp; President Trump to do the right thing for these families and end this shameful shutdown right away. https://t.co/4E5M70yPqg
It’s time for Leader McConnell to stop standing in the way of opening the government. The #TrumpShutdown has gone on for long enough. Do the right thing for the families we represent.
I won’t stop sharing #ShutdownStories from the Americans hurting from the #TrumpShutdown until President Trump and Senate Republicans bring this shameful crisis to an end. https://t.co/RD9ODYKDkE
Yesterday, when Republicans chose to try to attack women's health rather than do their jobs and end the #TrumpShutdown, people across the country saw exactly where the GOP stands. Not with them, not with their families, not with their communities, and certainly not with women.
When we pass the #RaiseTheWage Act and raise the minimum wage to $15/hour, 20 million women will get a raise, including 40% of Black working women &amp; 35% of Latina working women.
I’m outraged that Leader McConnell chose to attack women’s health and attempt to end abortion coverage rather than ending the #TrumpShutdown that is still hurting so many families. https://t.co/TolX5ez7d3
The men &amp; women of the U.S. Coast Guard dedicate their lives to protecting our homeland, our economy, &amp; our environment, &amp; it’s time for President Trump &amp; the GOP to listen to all the members of our federal workforce whose paychecks are being held hostage. https://t.co/6w9qjLmaaf
The #RaiseTheWage Act would give millions of workers, including over 20 million women, a raise, helping them put food on the table, pay the bills, and invest in their families’ futures.
We should be voting to end the #TrumpShutdown, but instead Republicans are planning a vote on a bill that would effectively end abortion and chip away at a woman’s right to make her own health decisions.
Millions of hardworking people in this country go to work full time -- some even holding down multiple jobs -- but are still struggling to make ends meet and pay their bills. #RaiseTheWage
I’ve talked to people scared to death about paying their bills, and others who are leaving their jobs at TSA and other important agencies that keep us safe because they can’t count on the government to deliver their paycheck. It's time for this nightmare to end. #TrumpShutdown
One of the very first steps I’m taking in this new Congress is to introduce the #RaiseTheWage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $15/hour and eliminate the tipped minimum wage. https://t.co/shuShkLeXs
It’s day 26 of the Trump Shutdown, but instead of voting to re-open the government, Leader McConnell is choosing to attack women &amp; vote on a bill that will effectively ban abortion coverage &amp; chip away at health care. We can't let this happen and we have to make our voices heard. https://t.co/vqRBQ71rgq
It’s time for President Trump and the Republicans to listen to the federal workers whose paychecks are being held hostage and bring an end to the terrible #TrumpShutdown right now. https://t.co/844ARshkAS
Instead of allowing us to vote to end the Trump Shutdown, Leader McConnell just scheduled a vote that could come as soon as Friday to ban abortions &amp; chip away at women's health care &amp; constitutional rights. We need to make our voices heard to say that we won't stand for this! https://t.co/IoTAJM5XZf
It’s vitally important that our forestry professionals and firefighters are as prepared as possible for the upcoming fire season, but the #TrumpShutdown is delaying their training and work. https://t.co/A5QYdrGhMu
I’m calling on my Republican colleagues in the Senate to join us and defend the health protections millions of people rely on. #ProtectOurCare
If Republicans meant what they said during the election season when they claimed to support protections for people with pre-existing conditions and affordable health care, they should prove it now. This partisan lawsuit puts all of that and more at risk. https://t.co/pEvyn7pn5Z
The #TrumpShutdown could have serious impacts at the FDA, including a delay in approvals for potentially life-saving medical drugs and devices. This is alarming -- and we need answers. https://t.co/5woBxiiiU1

This is Day 25 of the dysfunctional #TrumpShutdown -- the longest in our nation’s history. Senate Republicans must take immediate action to end this shutdown that is truly shameful.

The #TrumpShutdown is forcing thousands of federal employees to turn to food banks in order to feed their families. This is no way to treat the hardworking people who make our government work. Republican leaders must make this right. https://t.co/tx4CSwNaU8
President Trump: it’s time to stop playing politics with people’s lives. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/OWzPfbim8L
Ending the #TrumpShutdown isn’t complicated. Senate Republicans should take action right now to open the government, just like they did last month. Enough is enough.
A $0 paycheck won’t pay the mortgage or feed the family. Thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, 800,000 Americans are off the job or still going to work without knowing when they’ll be paid. https://t.co/fvt6ZUNDkS

I've heard from furloughed workers who are worried about paying the rent &amp; putting food on the table, from staff at food pantries who may not be able to keep the doors open, and from single parents relying on SNAP benefits.
With no end in sight to the #TrumpShutdown, low-income Americans may be in danger of being evicted from their homes. This is unacceptable -- and if GOP leaders won't act to end the shutdown, they will share the blame for these devastating consequences. https://t.co/Driv8Zr20L

Republican leaders should do the right thing and allow bipartisan votes on funding bills to open the government immediately and stop hurting Americans with this unnecessary shutdown.
President Trump is throwing a temper tantrum because he’s not getting his way, and 800,000 people, their families, and communities are paying the price. https://t.co/9FTb3u0VHd
President Trump is spreading fear, but the facts remain: the government has been shut down for 19 days now because he is demanding taxpayer money for his wasteful wall.

The #TrumpShutdown is hurting hundreds of thousands of workers and the American people and families they serve. It’s time for Republicans to bring this immoral fiasco to an end.
This is President Trump’s shutdown. And the longer Senate Republicans refuse to stand up to him, the more they own it too. It’s time to work with Democrats to end this now. https://t.co/ziNOLmUZIi
A government shutdown of any length is unacceptable, let alone one that lasts “months or years.” President Trump needs to come to his senses right now and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/9ZV9dyiwK7
Republicans in the Senate previously joined with Democrats to vote unanimously to fund the government. They should join us again to end the #TrumpShutdown once and for all.

Remember when President Trump said he’d be “proud” to shut down the government? How can he be proud of hurting hardworking American families like this? #TrumpShutdown
This #TrumpShutdown shouldn’t continue any longer. It’s time for Republicans to work with us to re-open the government without any new funding for President Trump’s disastrous border wall. https://t.co/5BqCMLYo05

The #TrumpShutdown has gone on for long enough. President Trump needs to stop hurting families, stop holding the government hostage, and stop the shutdown he started right now.

Families with bills to pay are being forced to make difficult financial decisions due to the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/kWUnOw31uH

The women and men who make our government work should not be treated like this, with their paychecks being used as political pawns by President Trump &amp; the GOP. It’s up to Republicans to reverse course and work with Democrats to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/9YAFHznpUM
Many federal workers are still going to work each day not knowing when they'll get paid. Now, on top of that, some are worried about losing their paid time off too. The GOP needs to work with us to relieve this stress on families &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/pHZZPZWvWo

It's time for President Trump and Republicans to reverse course and do the right thing for the workers and families affected by the #TrumpShutdown.
President Trump shouldn’t drag this unnecessary government shutdown into the new year. https://t.co/JyP6rInkNv
Democrats will not allow President Trump to waste taxpayer money on a wasteful border wall that he repeatedly pledged Mexico would pay for. It’s simply a non-starter. #TrumpShutdown
Under Republican control of the White House and Congress, this is now the third official government shutdown of 2018. This chaos is no way to run a country. #TrumpShutdown
The #TrumpShutdown was completely avoidable, but President Trump threw a tantrum over his wasteful border wall. He &amp; the GOP must work with Democrats immediately to fully fund the government. https://t.co/9sB8CRrHtC
I’m so angry on behalf of every worker forced to spend the holidays wondering when they’ll get their next paycheck, thanks to the #TrumpShutdown.
The current chaos over a potential #Trumpshutdown is absurd. This is no way to run a country. It's time for President Trump and the GOP to reverse course and do the right thing before needlessly hurting millions of workers and families.
The #FirstStepAct is a true bipartisan accomplishment. It’s clear that both parties see the need for criminal justice reform. Let’s keep up this momentum and build on our progress. https://t.co/SpE02vGIGn

Washington is one of the states most affected by the child care crisis, with 63% of families living in child care deserts. My Child Care for Working Families Act will tackle this issue so every family can afford licensed, quality child care. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/Kjgrf5wZfi
I voted for the #FirstStepAct because our criminal justice system is often unfair, especially to communities of color and low-income Americans. Reform is long overdue. This is a great first step, and I'll keep fighting to build on our progress. https://t.co/PXRv1FF3vy
I'm still standing with survivors and speaking out against Secretary DeVos' #TitleIX rule that would make it easier for schools to avoid their responsibilities when it comes to dealing with sexual harassment and assault on campus. #HandsOffTitleIX
The GOP needs to drop their reckless partisan politics and join Democrats to defend families’ health care.
Due to Republicans’ efforts to sabotage health care, millions of people are now worried about whether they’ll be left without access to affordable health care, and during the holiday season no less.
Despite overwhelming evidence and basic common sense, Secretary DeVos is trying to make the case that it’s not guns in schools that make students unsafe, but rather the true danger is schools’ attempts to fight racism and inappropriate discipline. https://t.co/EpGCDWkdrB
If Republicans believe in protecting people with pre-existing conditions, like they said during the election, they need to step up and join us in working to protect affordable health care for millions of Americans. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/08mxuo9sgO
This is welcome news for 15,000 eligible student loan borrowers, but this problem is far from solved. Secretary DeVos must make this right for the more than 100,000 people who were cheated out of their education and savings. https://t.co/XtpPW8g7ce

It’s up to all of us to #ActOnClimate. Failure is not an option when it comes to our future. https://t.co/pbwG3BZz2A
More than half of Americans live in child care deserts -- areas with little or no access to quality child care. This is a national crisis and it requires our urgent action. Child care should be within reach for every single family. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/rNwyitVyNY
I’m calling on every Republican who claimed to support protections for people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; affordable health care before Election Day to prove it by dropping the partisan politics, and making sure families aren’t hurt by their party’s reckless political games. https://t.co/fiyJBzQh1u
Make your voice heard. Speak out against the Trump Administration’s attack on #TitleIX protections for survivors of campus assault. #HandsOffTitleIX

I’m continuing to call for President Trump to bring our active duty troops home from the border. It’s clear they aren’t there to protect our national security, but to further his hateful agenda.
Child care deserts disproportionately affect Latino families and those who live in rural communities. We must do more to ensure every family can access child care. #ChildCare4All
The Trump Administration is trying to make it harder for survivors to come forward about sexual assault on campus. Add your name to fight back against Betsy DeVos’ new #TitleIX rule. https://t.co/Zv2UmBIv2C
Survivors deserve better than Betsy DeVos’ new #TitleIX rule. Join the fight. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/d3kcUrvMVF
More than half of Americans live in child care deserts, meaning they can't access licensed, affordable child care where they live. My Child Care for Working Families Act would ensure every family can afford high-quality child care. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/Tdjyraxwrh
Use your voice and speak out for survivors. Sign the petition demanding Secretary DeVos listen to survivors of sexual assault and withdraw her proposed new #TitleIX rules. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/eZh4MOXsQc
We called for this deployment to end in November, and once again, I’m joining my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to call on this administration to reverse course and bring our troops home.
President Trump sent our troops to the southern border all to evoke fear and xenophobia — not to serve a genuine national security purpose.

How climate change will impact the Pacific Northwest:	✖️ More severe wildfires, flooding, and natural disasters	✖️ Warmer, drier winters	✖️ Decreased snow, fewer tourism jobs	✖️ Habitat loss for salmon and whales	✖️ Risks to apple and wine industries	#ActOnClimate
For years, Republicans have fought to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, but we've come together, spoken out, and stopped them again and again. In the next Congress, Democrats are in an even better position to defend women’s health from GOP attacks. https://t.co/vnrqwlNWkf
If we’re going to stop Secretary DeVos’ proposed #TitleIX rule, we all need to make our voices heard. Here’s how to stand with survivors of campus assault and join us in the fight. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/P3fqDIpX6n
President Trump and his fellow Republicans continue to deny the science at our nation’s peril. Climate change is not a partisan issue -- it affects all of us.  #ActOnClimate https://t.co/TE1wI9peYT
Instead of continuing to sabotage our health care, Republicans should join us in working together to make it better and more affordable so that every single American can access truly affordable health coverage.	https://t.co/WCMVocB9Gd
The Trump Administration’s new rules allowing employers to opt out of birth control coverage are set to take effect in January. We can’t let this attack on women’s health &amp; rights go unnoticed. https://t.co/TS8qUPra8r
Warmer temperatures. Less snowmelt. Damaged salmon habitats. Increased risk of wildfires. The Pacific Northwest will face all of this and more if we fail to #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/Mf8zhTtPCo
President Trump is once again threatening to shut down the government over the holidays, all because he can’t secure funding for his wasteful border wall. This is a political distraction and there’s absolutely no reason it needs to happen. https://t.co/pbTow7a8F4
We can’t allow survivors’ rights to be rolled back on campus. We demand that Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration rescind their proposed Title IX rule now. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/tp0MHFYCPG
I won’t let the Trump Administration sweep the new climate report under the rug. Climate change is already hurting Washington state and it’s only getting worse. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/od9z84gDmX
We can’t stand for this. After more than a decade of progress, President Trump’s hostility toward health care is causing the number of uninsured children in our country to rise. https://t.co/OqdDh5wbjn
This isn’t a problem we can wait to solve. In the Pacific Northwest, climate change is already at our doorstep, and it’s only going to get worse if we fail to meet this challenge. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/5IwV7TKp2l
I will continue standing with survivors and speaking out against Secretary DeVos’ Title IX proposal until she withdraws it. Join me by making your voice heard now. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/tp0MHFYCPG
It belittles our troops’ sacrifices when we allow them to be used at the border to serve President Trump’s political agenda. I’m calling on the president to end this unnecessary deployment immediately. https://t.co/4xKBtjuGbY
Today is the 30th anniversary of #WorldAIDSDay. An AIDS-free generation is possible if all of us double down now and renew our commitment to eradicating this disease once and for all. https://t.co/Odd8wS98Wn
The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act took an important step forward this week, but there is still so much work to do to fully address our country’s tragic maternal mortality rates. I won’t stop fighting to get this done, and I hope you’re with me.
For us in the Pacific Northwest, climate change is personal. We can’t let President Trump’s fact-twisting stop us from doing everything in our power to combat this crisis. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/QANBUwiW8d
We don’t need troops at the border. We need trained personnel who can assist asylum seekers and provide medical assistance. It’s horrific to see people met with tear gas and chaos instead of compassion.
President Trump’s efforts to sabotage health care are leaving children uninsured. We must fight back against these attacks and ensure all our kids get the care they need. https://t.co/6Z8xUEl3FF
You made your voices heard, and thankfully, my colleagues in the Senate listened to the very real concerns about Thomas Farr. This man’s repugnant record on voting rights should disqualify him from the federal bench. https://t.co/L3EHe0ESeA
This is your chance to stand with survivors of sexual assault and make your voices heard. Let Secretary DeVos know that you oppose her proposed Title IX rule. #HandsOffTitleIX https://t.co/E2APZRLpQF
The Pacific Northwest is already feeling the impacts of climate change and without immediate attention, things will only get worse. We have no time to spare. This crisis requires swift and meaningful action. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/W30kDHTxqE
If Secretary DeVos honestly wants to support survivors of sexual harassment and assault on campus, she will withdraw her flawed Title IX proposal immediately. #HandsOffIX
I voted for the resolution to withdraw U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. This war has cost an untold number of lives, including so many children. This cannot go unaddressed. https://t.co/MTayHbxOLU
I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand with survivors and make their voices heard loud and clear against Secretary DeVos’ proposed #TitleIX rule changes. #HandsOffIX
As Republicans push a final vote on Thomas Farr through the Senate, I remain strongly opposed to his confirmation. His disturbing record of suppressing the minority vote disqualifies him from serving on any court, let alone North Carolina’s highest court. https://t.co/K25gXpkUSy
As climate change threatens the future of the Pacific Northwest, President Trump and his administration are shamefully denying the science behind their own report. #ActOnClimate	https://t.co/ozOMZ5xqE1
Secretary DeVos: Listen to survivors of sexual assault. Withdraw your proposed Title IX rule changes now. https://t.co/jz7oAJgj7r
Thomas Farr has spent his career defending North Carolina’s voter suppression laws. If he were appointed to the federal bench, it would be a huge step back for voting rights.	https://t.co/nQgaHNeGdS
I stand with my colleagues, along with women and survivors everywhere, against Secretary DeVos’ proposed Title IX changes. We must make it easier -- not harder -- for survivors of sexual assault to come forward on campus.
It is beyond unacceptable for mothers and children seeking refuge in our country to be met with tear gas and chaos. This should not be the way we treat people.	https://t.co/ukkvWLMQzK
We should be doing everything we can to support survivors of campus sexual assault. But instead, Secretary DeVos is turning her back on survivors and making it easier for schools to avoid their responsibility to keep students safe.
From increased drought and extreme weather to loss of habitats for salmon and more, climate change is already putting Washington state at risk. We must rise up to meet this urgent challenge. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/zAL3PKax0i
We should be doing all we can to prevent campus sexual assault, but Secretary DeVos’ proposed Title IX guidelines would make it even harder for survivors to come forward and would allow schools to shirk their responsibility to students.
President Trump needs to face reality: climate change is putting our future at risk, and we’re running out of time to solve this crisis. #ActOnClimate
Families seeking refuge in our country should be met with empathy and medical aid—not tear gas and chaos. This is not how we should treat families seeking refuge. https://t.co/SiJL0Iq1ea

Thousands of U.S. troops spent Thanksgiving away from their families yesterday because of President Trump's political stunt. It's time for this unnecessary deployment to end. https://t.co/fjlu2t8ctu

In the wake of Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, more cases like this are sure to arise. I will continue to stand with women to ensure they have the right to make decisions about their own health care. https://t.co/AqVwJaDAEo

I joined the legal fight to stop President Trump from shrinking our national monuments in WA and across the country. These beautiful lands must be protected. #MonumentsForAll
We will not allow sexual assault on college campuses to be swept under the rug. We will not allow women to be forced into silence out of fear. Sec. DeVos’ proposed Title IX rules are unacceptable. #HandsOffIX	https://t.co/jIPcqA5970
The 2018 elections were proof that our voices can make a difference. Now, our work is far from over and we must keep speaking out.

For years women have watched the GOP restrict access to women’s health care, attempt to repeal health care reform, and ram through a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault. 		And on Tuesday, women voted. https://t.co/Ot4bbVf1cx
The Trump Administration this week quietly rolled out rules to make it more difficult for women to access affordable reproductive health care. Women haven’t stopped watching because Election Day has come and gone, and we haven’t stopped fighting, either. https://t.co/ncLPmMhOx9
Republican and Democrat, we should all be able to come together to support legislation to protect the Mueller investigation from interference.

Thank you to @clairecmc, @HeidiHeitkamp, and @JoeforIndiana. You worked hard every single day for your constituents, and you served them so well.

Thank you to everyone who called, knocked and donated to elect Democrats this year. Tuesday’s results would not have been possible without you.
A record number of Democratic women were elected to Congress on Tuesday, and I couldn’t be prouder. I look forward to working with these women to move our country forward.
Congrats, @DrKimSchrier! Can’t wait to welcome you to Congress and work together to serve Washington families.
Your votes, your donations and your hard work made the difference last night -- and your voices can keep making the difference in the fights ahead.

I haven’t given up the fight to stop the president’s #JunkPlans from being sold by insurers. We can’t allow any return to the days when people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage.
Students, parents, and school administrators are opposed to the Department of Education’s plan to weaken sexual assault protections on college campuses. This week, I called on Secretary DeVos to delay implementation and address these concerns.
Senate Republicans this week: 		- Confirmed Judge Kavanaugh	- Voted against protections for people with preexisting conditions	- Dismissed the UN report on global warming. 		The time for electing Democrats is now. #TakeItBack https://t.co/I3a485xiwk
President Trump worked tirelessly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work, he redoubled efforts to sabotage health care. Premiums are going down despite his best efforts. https://t.co/HRpasZrEtZ

Since Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation, I have heard from so many women who want to keep working to prevent anything like this from happening again. It’s inspiring. Keep on fighting.
Confirmation of what we all knew—the White House put limits on the investigation into Judge Kavanaugh to ensure only the facts they wanted would come to light. https://t.co/6eZIg8V5dj
You can’t change the Senate and the House if you aren’t registered to vote! Deadlines are coming up fast. Don’t miss your chance to vote on 11/6. https://t.co/hhWkOaNIVU

I was elected to the Senate in 1992 by women and men who were outraged by the Senate’s treatment of Anita Hill. We're about to see a whole new generation of women elected next month.
We learned these past few weeks how much elections matter, because who is in charge matters. We must do everything we can to elect Democrats, and especially Democratic women in these final weeks before Election Day. Don’t stop fighting!
Women watched the Senate these past few weeks. We saw who stood up for survivors, and who didn’t -- and we won’t forget in November. https://t.co/N8kaQxShRA

After Anita Hill was shamed and put on trial for speaking out, I ran for the United States Senate. If you are waking up wondering what’s next—make calls, donate, VOTE. Put all your energy into electing Democratic women this fall.
To all who organized against Judge Kavanaugh, thank you for your hard work. To all survivors of sexual assault, I see you and I believe you. #BelieveSurvivors
If we rise up now, what happens in November will make the wave of 1992 -- the Year of the Woman -- look like a ripple. Start by donating now to elect @kyrstensinema &amp; @RosenforNevada to the Senate. https://t.co/m5zxaErJBV
We are angry and dispirited right now -- but we are not giving up. We will not forget how Senate Republicans ignored the voices of women and survivors. We will not allow them to silence us now. #KavanaughVote
In 2018, the year of #MeToo, we are not going to sit at home and be quiet. We're not going to stop telling our stories. We will keep fighting until women are believed. And we will make this country a place we are proud of. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/ROAwvBz5ih
Please keep telling your stories. Please keep making your voices heard until the final votes have been cast. #StopKavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh lacks the credibility and temperament needed in a Supreme Court Justice. I will continue to oppose him. Call your Senators, and tell them to #StopKavanaugh and #BelieveSurvivors. https://t.co/WDXgM9howz
We still have time to do this right. We still have time to do better than the Senate did when Anita Hill came forward in 1991. We still have time to give voice to the millions of women and survivors who are counting on us. #BelieveSurvivors
The Senate’s final #KavanaughVote is scheduled to happen tomorrow afternoon. Don’t stop calling. https://t.co/WDXgM9howz
Keep up the fight. We are angry and disappointed -- but we are not giving up. Call your senators at (202) 224-3121 and tell them to do the right thing. #StopKavanaugh
Your voice, your stories, and your calls DO make a difference. Make sure your senators know you expect them to #BelieveSurvivors and #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/WDXgM9howz
Women are watching, and right now they see a President mocking survivors of sexual assault and Senate Republicans planning a vote before a thorough investigation can be completed. 		We won’t forget.
President Trump’s comments at a rally on Tuesday were disgusting. Dr. Ford demonstrated courage and poise while reliving the most traumatic event of her life to a national audience. She should be commended, not mocked. #BelieveSurvivors
Mitch McConnell is racing toward a confirmation vote this week. There’s no time to waste - call your senators now and tell them not to rush this process. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/0JIRpHpB10
The FBI must conduct a serious and thorough investigation before we even consider voting on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. There is no need to rush. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/mOMhGDXOHL
Dr. Ford demonstrated her credibility to the country last week. I believe her and I will keep fighting for her voice to be heard. #BelieveSurvivors
Judge Kavanaugh lied under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. He lied about his past and his knowledge of the accusations against him. That should be enough to disqualify and #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/Ol9h0OeX6m

I watched Dr. Ford with tears in my eyes yesterday. And in the last 24 hours, so many survivors have reached out to me, saying they are crying, dispirited and in disbelief. 		We have a right to these tears, but we also have a duty not to give up.
In 1991, I watched as the Senate failed Anita Hill.	The following year, I ran for Senate and won. I am living proof that if the Senate ignores and dismisses women’s voices, women will rise up. #BelieveSurvivors
In 1991, I and women around the country watched as the Senate failed in its responsibilities when Anita Hill came forward. We cannot make the same mistake again.
Judge Kavanaugh should immediately withdraw from consideration. If he won't, President Trump should pull his nomination. If neither will act, then it's time for Senate Republicans to do the right thing.
I am in awe of Dr. Ford's courage. I had tears in my eyes this morning as she so bravely shared her testimony about being sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh.
Women all over America are watching to see what Senate Republicans will do today and in days ahead -- and we will not forget. #StopKavanaugh
I ran for Senate in 1991 after Anita Hill was attacked and disbelieved to make sure that it would never happen again. Tomorrow is a crucial moment for the Senate to determine how it treats survivors and the messages we send to women and men everywhere. https://t.co/qlv2vcgFNg
Senate Republicans have a choice: 		Listen to Dr. Ford and investigate her allegations accordingly. 		Or rush to a Friday vote and use the hearing just to check a box.		Women everywhere are watching, and won’t forget what they see.
Setting a rushed vote before even hearing from Dr. Ford is absolutely wrong. She should be listened to, not swept aside.	 	But I will not stop doing everything I can to make sure her voice is heard. https://t.co/MdRFQK73MD
Setting a vote for the morning after Dr. Ford’s hearing shows a total lack of regard for Dr. Ford’s testimony and for sexual assault survivors everywhere.
Remember, safe, confidential assistance to sexual assault survivors is available if you are in need of support. Call 1800-656-HOPE, or visit https://t.co/mdKWoMOPQl.
Women sharing their experiences should be listened to and respected. If the GOP get this wrong, there will be massive backlash. https://t.co/TBQCtbSHZ1
When women speak up about sexual assault they should be listened to and supported, not bullied, attacked, or threatened. If you or anyone you know needs help, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline: https://t.co/PI8T7cPXhf
Call your senators, tell them you admire the bravery of women sharing their stories, tell them to treat them with respect, and tell them why you oppose Judge Kavanaugh. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/M3L9RH77AI
To the women and men who have been sexually assaulted, I support you, and I stand with you. If you need help, the National Sexual Assault Hotline is free and confidential: https://t.co/PI8T7cPXhf
When Anita Hill was attacked before the Judiciary Committee in 1991, women remembered. We ran for office--and won--in record numbers. If women are similarly attacked now, women will not be silent.
The way President Trump and some Senate Republicans are treating Dr. Ford is exactly why women and men who have been sexually assaulted are afraid to come forward. If you need help, @RAINN can help: https://t.co/PI8T7cPXhf
Too many Republicans are treating the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh as simply a hiccup on the path to a vote. This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, and we must properly vet whether he is fit to serve.
When women come forward to share their experiences being sexually assaulted, Senate Republicans need to treat them fairly and with respect. https://t.co/muY5FI2P6f
Two out of three sexual assaults go unreported. Dr. Ford is not the first, and she won’t be the last. 		Survivors are watching. What the Senate does now will send a loud message to those considering whether to report an assault.
Here’s my message to sexual assault survivors who read President Trump’s ignorant, insensitive tweets about Dr. Ford and fear no one will help or listen if they come forward:		We are here. We believe you. We will help you. 	https://t.co/43X8LNtF5E
I was inspired to run for Senate because of the way Anita Hill was treated 27 years ago. I will continue to stand by Dr. Ford, and fight to make sure she is treated fairly and with respect.
It may be the weekend, but you can still leave a message for your Senators at (202) 224-3121 to demand a fair hearing of Dr. Ford’s allegations.
Women are disproportionately more likely to be left in dire financial straits after a divorce, and are more likely to face poverty in retirement. We need to look into how pension and retirement funds are allocated during divorce proceedings.
As we fight for fairness and decency for Dr. Ford, it’s so important to remember she is one of many who have survived sexual assault. You are not alone. Here are a few resources that can help. https://t.co/ItXnllf2H2
Dr. Ford has endured so much since coming forward with her allegations about Judge Kavanaugh. She must be treated with fairness and respect, and she must be listened to and believed.
#WhatAreTheyHiding? What don’t they want you to know? These are the questions we’ve been asking throughout the most secretive nomination process in modern times. We still don’t have the answers. https://t.co/BNbX6ptmoz
I want to thank Dr. Ford for her bravery. Before we ask her to go through the difficult experience of publicly sharing her story, we must guarantee her a fair hearing where she will be listened to and believed, rather than interrogated, attacked, or demeaned. https://t.co/jXTwxSfhwg
Transparency is critical to improving health care in the U.S. But it isn’t enough on it’s own, especially when President Trump takes every opportunity to sabotage programs critical to connecting people with affordable health care.
It was an honor to join @MariaCantwell at @PPFA yesterday to stand up for Dr. Ford and stand against Judge Kavanaugh’s record on women’s health. #WhatsatStake https://t.co/ScFGpfmz1i
I want Dr. Ford and all women to know: I believe you and I will fight for you against these horrific attacks -- and millions of women and men will fight for you along with me.
The GOP's attacks on Dr. Ford are sending women a message: if you speak up about being assaulted or harassed by a powerful Republican man, you will pay a price.
The GOP wants Dr. Ford to testify on short notice, without a prior investigation or with other relevant witnesses called, all while she &amp; her family are in hiding from death threats.
I’m proud to be one of the women inspired to run after Anita Hill’s treatment. We must not let history repeat itself. Dr. Ford must receive fair treatment, must be listened to, and must be treated with respect. https://t.co/5U1UIqc41U
I hope the GOP will work with us to ensure Dr. Ford’s fair treatment and a full investigation. But if they do not, I remind them millions of women are watching, and we won’t let this happen again.
We must have a robust and fair investigation into Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh before any testimony before the Judiciary Committee.
A whole lot has changed since Anita Hill testified in 1991 -- but the GOP’s Judiciary Committee members are all still all male and already starting to discredit claims of woman who was assaulted.
Republicans are calling the same plays they did against Anita Hill in 1991—trying to rush to a hearing, during which the survivor is interrogated and maligned, followed by a quick vote. I won’t stand for it.
Republicans are trying to jam through Judge Kavanaugh before a full and fair investigation can be completed, and that is shameful. https://t.co/ed5Z3cRETG
Families and workers in Washington state cannot afford any more of the President’s tariffs. We’re the most trade-dependent state in the U.S., and his misguided trade war has already harmed so many. https://t.co/tsJmqy4Qhx
The idea that Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination would be jammed through given what we know now is almost unthinkable and would be shameful and wrong.
I was inspired to run for the Senate in 1991 when I saw the abhorrent way Anita Hill was treated during the hearings for now-Justice Thomas. We can’t allow the same mistakes to be repeated in 2018.
I believe Professor Ford, and she should know that I and millions of people are standing by her side and stand ready to help however we can. https://t.co/F9KgcIiv3U
Thanks to bipartisan work in the Senate last week, we worked to secure $50 million to invest in the fight against maternal mortality to improve data collection, strengthen investigations into maternal deaths, and expand prevention programs.
As a former preschool teacher, I know the impact early learning and child care can have on young minds. If we pass the Child Care for Working Families Act I introduced last year, both will be in reach for more families. https://t.co/mJ6dk1wvgg
There is no question the Senate Judiciary Committee should not hold a vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation this week.
My gratitude and support go out to Professor Christine Ford, for her bravery in coming forward to share her story of sexual assault.
Judge Kavanaugh would be on on the wrong side of issues that impact working families, patients, women, our environment, and so much more. We need to keep doing all we can to #StopKavanaugh

Today, my daughter texted me because my granddaughters were watching the Judiciary Committee hearings &amp; seeing so many amazing Democratic women &amp; people of color asking the toughest questions of Judge Kavanaugh &amp; helping Congress look just a bit more like the people it serves.
I first ran for the Senate after my daughter and I watched Anita Hill being grilled by an all-male Judiciary Committee that didn’t look anything like me or so many others across the country and that wasn't asking the questions so many of us wanted asked.

The new Title X rules proposed by the Trump Administration would jeopardize healthcare for millions of women, all in an effort to restrict access to information about the full range of reproductive options open to those women.
Yesterday, I wrote to health Secretary Azar requesting that the Trump Administration take a close look at the impacts of their proposed restrictions to #TitleX family planning program.		People and families deserve answers.
Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin next week. Republicans are still keeping documents from his time in the White House under lock and key. It’s outrageous that we are expected to advise and consent with such significant information missing.
Air quality has improved all over Washington state since last week, but there is still a chance wildfire smoke could blow in. Check the air quality where you live before making plans: https://t.co/yKviZvLUcE

President Trump’s multi-front trade war is hitting Washington state cherry growers hard. They need relief, and they need the President to stop with his ill-advised escalations. https://t.co/MaW2OuSnFi
Judge Kavanaugh spent 35 months as Staff Secretary in the Bush White House. He admits to being involved in discussions on choice, same-sex marriage, the powers of the presidency, and more. We have no documents from this period of his professional life.
Studies indicate three out of every five maternal deaths are preventable. The steps taken this week are a start, but further action will be necessary to address this crisis.

The opioid epidemic has hit Washington state hard, as it has in so many other places. I’m glad we have been able to continue to work toward answering families’ call for action in a bipartisan way.

Manafort’s conviction and Cohen’s guilty plea are proof that we must allow the Mueller probe to come to its natural conclusion, wherever that may be. We cannot, and should not, vote for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee until that happens.

I’ll keep saying it: More than any President I’ve seen, President Trump was clear on what he was looking for in a SCOTUS nominee. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh would be the 5th vote to overturn Roe V. Wade and roll back women’s constitutionally protected freedoms.
Yesterday I sent a letter to Chairman Grassley to raise my serious concerns with the timing of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, and the rush to confirm a nominee we know so little about.
You can listen to this guy -- or you can trust women to make their own health care decisions and fight to defeat a Supreme Court nominee who has repeatedly ruled against women’s health care rights. https://t.co/mEP11AvXHN
A president named in a plot to violate campaign finance laws has nominated a SCOTUS justice who could decide if presidents can be charged with a crime. Call your senators to oppose Judge Kavanaugh now.
Do you care about the overwhelming influence of dark money in our elections? Judge Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in the case that green-lit unlimited contributions to Super PACs, essentially allowing mega donors to get around campaign contribution limits.
Judge Kavanaugh's appointment would create a five-vote majority of male justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. This is the biggest threat to women’s constitutionally protected rights in decades. #SaveRoe

The National Archives has been very up front about needing more time to catalogue and release Brett Kavanaugh’s files. Instead of ensuring an open vetting process, Mitch McConnell is trying to push through the nomination without all the facts.

This is not a time for anyone to sit back and watch while the Supreme Court and the future of our nation hangs in the balance. This is a time to make your voice heard loud and clear. Add your name. https://t.co/S4gZOJI9s5
At a time when we should be leading the charge to support the health of women and children across the globe, the Trump Administration sided with corporate special interests. That’s unacceptable. https://t.co/djIDAJCIub
When I first ran for the US Senate, I did it because I didn't see anyone asking the questions that I would have asked. The voices of women nationwide deserve to be heard, and I'm going to keeping doing everything I can to make sure they are. We have to fight back. https://t.co/k6cHLC48zs
In nominating Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump has picked someone who would swing the balance of the Supreme Court for a generation against women, workers, patients, and families. I will oppose this nomination, and I hope you’re with me. https://t.co/oZGjadRm9h
It's more important than ever that we work together to keep making our voices heard that we won't go back and that we will keep shining a spotlight on the Trump-Pence Administration's constant efforts to undermine women's access to reproductive health care.
To see someone who is so seriously mistaken about women's health and so hostile to women's reproductive rights picked to head the Title X family planning program, is incredibly concerning. 	https://t.co/JYIYP5367S
The only thing “extreme” about the court-imposed deadline for reuniting families are the cruel actions of the Trump Administration that made such an order necessary in the first place. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/M0VSRtzpXU
Scott Pruitt should have resigned a long time ago, but the acting EPA Administrator is no friend to the environment—he’s a former lobbyist for the coal industry. We can’t let up on our fight for clean air, clean water, and clean land.
I first got involved in politics to fight politicians who were trying to cut a preschool program my kids counted on. I know so many families continue to struggle to find quality, affordable child care for their children. There is much work left to be done.
I believe our daughters and granddaughters should have the same constitutionally protected reproductive rights women do today. If you agree, now is the time to make your voice heard.
Diversity and equality of opportunity should be central to the mission of higher education. It’s disturbing that the Trump administration would so brazenly attack both. https://t.co/Qp073b3kLq
Don't let the man who insults rape survivors take away your constitutionally protected health care rights. Speak out. https://t.co/xTbkf1JVy9
My heart aches for the women I met at a federal detention center in WA last week. Many are fleeing unfathomable violence in their home countries, and end up behind bars in the United States. It’s unconscionable.
President Trump’s decision to end policies that encourage diversity on college campuses is another reminder of what is at stake with the next SCOTUS pick. So much progress could be undone so quickly.
Now, the health of millions of patients is at stake as President Trump considers who he will pick to fill the SCOTUS vacancy. Every person in this country who cares about access to health care needs to keep making their voices heard. https://t.co/MXfGoAEg8S
President Trump tried again and again to jam his awful Trumpcare bill through Congress—and when he couldn’t do that, he chose to create Trumpcare by sabotaging patients’ care in every way he could.
The vast majority of people believe SCOTUS should uphold Roe v. Wade -- and they deserve a chance to weigh in on the next nominee. No confirmation should take place before the November election.
Happy 4th of July to families in Washington state and across the country! https://t.co/pXiK643Ds2

For the second year in a row, President Trump failed to offer an official presidential proclamation recognizing June as #PrideMonth. I was honored to join @senatorcantwell last week in introducing a Senate resolution to do just that.
GM may be forced to scale back production and cut jobs thanks to the Trump tariffs. These reckless actions will have real consequences in Washington state and nationwide.
Welcome news from a federal judge yesterday ordering the Trump administration to stop arbitrarily detaining asylum seekers. People fleeing horrible violence in their home countries should not be greeted with prison cells. 	https://t.co/Xn9BTcvk79
Friday, I went to a federal detention center in WA, where I met women who were detained after turning themselves in at the southern border. None of these women should be treated as sub human -- that's not what I was taught as a young girl about how we treat people. https://t.co/lkfhcE3xqy
Our constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade are at stake with this next Supreme Court appointment. Women deserve the chance to weigh in through the November election before a nominee is confirmed.	https://t.co/MAtsBkFHI4
If you know anyone who has been sitting on the sidelines and not engaging in our political debates, now is the time to reach out to them, have a conversation, and let them know that they can't afford to sit this one out.
After yet another tragic mass shooting in our country this week, it’s time for Congress to finally act and pass common sense legislation to prevent gun violence.
I believe in the golden rule. Mitch McConnell should do unto others as he has done to himself and wait to confirm any Supreme Court Justice until after the November election.
If anyone still thought they could stay silent, stay home, and stay disengaged--this past week should be a wake-up call. Let’s get to work.
It’s heartbreaking to watch toddlers appear in court alone while they remain separated from their parents. The Trump Administration must immediately reunite these families. #FamiliesBelongTogether 	https://t.co/RWkhZH2bBq

So much is on the line with this next SCOTUS pick: Voting rights. LGBTQ rights. Women’s reproductive rights &amp; freedoms. With the midterm elections just four months away, Republican leaders must wait and give people &amp; families a chance to weigh in. 	https://t.co/1SWybYbgwA
A bright spot this week: Democrats &amp; Republicans agreed to $50 million in funding to begin to address our country's high rates of maternal mortality. Now we need to keep working together to get this bill signed into law &amp; build on the bipartisan progress. 	https://t.co/UNcMM41FIB

I'm so glad we were able to work together and vote to advance this bipartisan bill strengthening career &amp; technical education programs that would help states &amp; local communities maintain a competitive workforce. https://t.co/OsRD3ywE0j
The Supreme Court’s decision this week in #NIFLAvsBecerra was a step back for women’s access to the care they need -- but we can’t let up. We must keep fighting together to defend women’s health and reproductive freedoms.
Earlier this month, I introduced the Workers’ Freedom to Negotiate Act to strengthen workers’ freedom to join unions and negotiate collectively to win better pay and conditions, and I won’t stop fighting to get this done.
The #JANUSvsAFSCME decision is a loss for workers and yet another win for corporate special interests that have spent decades chipping away at workers’ rights and fighting to dismantle unions.
Women want to know if the next Supreme Court justice will uphold their constitutionally protected right to control their own health care decisions, affirmed in Roe v. Wade -- and they overwhelmingly do not want to see that right rolled back.
I hope that Republican leaders go back and look at what they said very recently and give families across the country the opportunity to weigh in, with an election, before moving forward to fill Justice Kennedy's Supreme Court seat.
Spikes in premiums.	Junk insurance plans.	Rolling back coverage for pre-existing conditions.		These are just some of the ways Republicans are trying sabotage health care. We need to keep fighting back.
Studies show the maternal mortality rate is 3-4x higher among black women than white women. It’s unacceptable. That’s why I’ve joined 11 other Senate Democrats in asking the Government Accountability Office to study state efforts to combat deaths caused by or related to pregnancy https://t.co/DPMiYCQH8D
Winning back the Senate in 2018 has never been more urgent — or more possible. We saw what happens when good Democrats compete and voters turn out to the polls: we WIN.
Moms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers and people from all walks of life are understandably angry about Trump’s new zero-tolerance policy. We will keep calling, writing, and tweeting until each and every family is reunited and we know they’re safe.
President Trump and his administration may not care about our public health, our air, or our climate — but families in Washington state and across the country do, and I’m standing with them.
Today and each day moving forward, I will continue to stand with the people of Washington state and the United States, fighting for affordable health care, high-quality education, protections for our environment, and equal rights for all.
The story of so many in our country is one of struggle and sacrifice. It’s about our unrelenting perseverance in the face of adversity and a commitment to invest in future generations. We must never forget that.
Title IX has touched the lives of millions of young women and LGBTQ Americans across our country. On the anniversary of Title IX becoming law, let’s recommit to ensuring everyone has the chance to succeed in athletics and education.
We need to keep pushing hard for answers from President Trump and Health Secretary Azar about what will happen to the more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents—as well as how all children are being treated in detention facilities. 	https://t.co/jVVcVjyJsi
We can’t let up—not for one second. We need to keep sending a message that the Trump Administration’s policy of indefinitely locking up migrant families seeking asylum is cruel, dehumanizing, and in no way represents what so many families in this country fight for every day.
There are many questions that still need answers:	→How separated parents and children are being informed about each other’s safety	→Where they are located	→If the children are being cared for appropriately	→What plans, if any, exist to reunite these families
Since Columbine in 1999, over 210,000 students in more than 200 schools have experienced a campus shooting. In order to keep students safe, we can’t keep turning a blind eye. Now is the time to address the scourge of gun violence.
It is frighteningly clear the Trump administration has absolutely no concern for the well-being of thousands of children whom they have caused great trauma. Families must be reunited and Congress must be provided regular, substantive updates on reunification efforts.

Kindness, respect, and compassion are what makes this country great. Every day I’m going to keep working to make sure these values shine through.
If we can find hope in one thing from yesterday, it’s knowing that all those calls and emails and letters — all of that outcry — got through to the president to change course on one of his most heartless policies yet. But we cannot let up now.
Doctors, insurance commissioners, and medical experts from across the political spectrum agree that President Trump’s latest health care sabotage will drive up patient costs and undermine care for people with pre-existing conditions. We must keep fighting back.
When the President says he’s going to stop the separation of children, what does that mean? Today? Next month? What about the thousands of children who’ve already been removed from their parents? Will they ever see their parents again? #KeepFamiliesTogether
While it’s a good thing President Trump dialed back his systematic abuse of children, it is not enough. Questions remain. Like when will the thousands of children who’ve already been removed from their parents be reunited? 	https://t.co/ypD7u57lOh
Republicans are trying to bring Trumpcare back from the dead by weakening protections and raising costs for patients. When will they join Democrats at the table to finally work together to lower costs and make health care work better instead of sabotaging it?
Let’s be clear — this policy has nothing to do with ensuring patients and families have access the care they need and everything to do with appealing to his extreme Republican donors, special interests, and his base.	https://t.co/7ZXGwDBv9x
The President could end the despicable treatment of kids at the border and #KeepFamiliesTogether with the snap of his fingers. His blame game and downright refusal to do so speaks volumes.
President Trump is cruely choosing to detain innocent children &amp; separate them from their families. This despicable treatment undermines our nation’s values &amp; runs counter to everything so many of us stand for. I urge President Trump to pick up the phone &amp; end this policy today.
Juneteenth marks the day that Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas and announced that the the Civil War had ended and all slaves were now free. While we commemorate today, it’s important we continue to fight for equality every day.
How can anyone listen to this recording and think Trump's family separation policy is acceptable? These innocent children are screaming for their parents because they don’t know when they’ll ever see them again. It is beyond cruel. https://t.co/J4oOj0cwhj
"The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy is responsible for spurring family separations. No law mandates it."	https://t.co/mFejLbV3qB
Let me be clear: there is no law that requires this Administration to rip children from their parents’ arms. But there should be a law that prevents it. That’s why I support the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, that would prohibit separating immigrant children from their parents.
President Trump’s tariffs pose a threat to Washington’s growers and our state’s economy. Instead of alienating our allies and potentially increasing the costs of everyday goods for millions of families, Trump needs to work to address unfair trade.	https://t.co/DQQceBYdEz
President Trump continues to undermine health care at every available opportunity—and Republicans have been right with him the entire time. But when they are ready to put people over partisan politics, Democrats are still at the table ready to get to work on real solutions.
We are one of the few industrialized nations that don’t offer paid family leave. That’s why it’s on us to speak up and encourage pro-family work policies.

Secretary DeVos has continued to put corporate profits ahead of students’ and borrowers’ best interests. If she really wants to help students defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges, she’d better start listening to the student loan-borrowers desperately seeking relief.

Appalling. This isn’t a shelter, this is what a prison looks like. 	https://t.co/MQpA2Of5Fr
Stripping away protections from those with a pre-existing condition, including asthma, depression, pregnancy, diabetes &amp; cancer, would be a cruel step in the wrong direction for our nation. We can’t let Pres. Trump &amp; Republicans to continue to sabotage health care at every turn.
There’s one issue that isn’t being adequately addressed in the halls of Congress: the inability for families to afford high-quality child care. No family should struggle to pay for child care while they work to pay the bills.

Republicans want to go back to the days when insurance companies were free to charge people more money based on their gender, and even deny people coverage entirely because of a pre-existing condition. We have to keep fighting to protect our care.
So many people in Washington state and around the country have said they feel helpless in light of the separation of children at our border. So what can you do? Pressure your Representatives. Join protests. Most importantly, show up and vote for change this in November.

People across the country have spoken loud and clear — they want health care improved, not sabotaged at every turn. If Republicans are ready to put people over partisan politics, Democrats are still at the table and ready to work to fix health care.
While the Trump Administration hyped its drug pricing plan as a big step forward ... it is very clearly not. Where are the big, bold ideas? Instead of a clear plan to address the issue, President Trump gave us a ‘blueprint’ that has more questions than answers.

Women are on the front line of politics, whether it is @MomsDemand fighting for sensible gun laws or @PPFA fighting to protect women’s reproductive rights. And proud to be right there alongside them, fighting for women in Washington state and across the country.
Going back to the days when people w/ a pre-existing condition could be charged more for care isn’t an option. It doesn't have to be this way. I'm still at the table ready to work together on solutions as soon as Republicans are ready to put patients before partisan politics.
The world is watching as President Trump and his administration choose to rip children from their parents seeking asylum from violence and terror. This doesn’t represent our values. And we must fight to take back our democracy in November to prove it.

As midterm elections are approaching, now is the time to show Republicans in Congress that they have a choice: put partisan politics aside and lower health costs for patients, or be held accountable at the ballot box.
Too many hardworking people – especially seniors, women, and people with pre-existing conditions – are now looking at higher premiums and worse coverage. They shouldn’t have to. Democrats and Republicans can still work together to make health care better and more affordable.

Let me be clear: President Trump and VP Pence’s opinions have no place in a woman’s conversations with her doctor about her health care—and women nationwide and I are going to fight this deeply harmful, ideological effort every step of the way.
Across the country, we’ve seen teachers struggle to pay the bills while educating the next generation, and it isn’t right. They’re teaching our future workers, innovators, and business owners -- so investing in them is an investment in our future.

President Trump and VP Pence’s reported scheme to implement a “domestic gag rule” would force doctors who receive family planning funding to censor critical information about the wide range of reproductive services available to women seeking care.

This president’s rhetoric about our immigrant communities is beyond disrespectful. It’s also dangerous. It shouldn’t matter if you identify as a Democrat, Republican, or Independent –– we must all recognize and respect our shared humanity.
Every student in this country deserves to feel safe in the classroom, and I’m going to keep doing everything I can to push this conversation forward and move toward real, common-sense action to stem the tide of gun violence.
When it comes to gun violence in our schools and in our communities, we're facing a public health crisis, and we in Congress have a responsibility to work together to take action to figure out what is going on and how to fix it.
As a mother and as a grandmother, I cannot begin to imagine the heartbreak the families of Santa Fe High School feel in this moment -- no child should have to fear going to school and no parent should have to worry about their child returning home safely from school.

The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among industrialized countries. What’s worse? Rates of maternal death are continuing to increase—especially for women of color. This issue affects women and families across our country, and we need to find solutions.
According to recent studies, black women die from pregnancy-related issues nearly four times as often as white women. It’s unacceptable &amp; it’s preventable. It’s time we take steps toward prioritizing maternal health &amp; collecting better data about threats to new mothers’ lives.

My friend @Maggie_Hassan discusses the critical importance of funding our public education system &amp; why this country’s public officials – especially our Secretary of Education – ought to invest in the success of our schools &amp; our students.	https://t.co/pmPZTjF1mQ
The students, parents, educators, and activists demanding common-sense gun safety laws are not giving up or backing down any time soon. #MarchForOurLives was not a moment -- it’s a movement.
No child or family should have to endure the pain and loss of gun violence.	https://t.co/BIxJjyoRbR
I’m pleased that this spending bill includes many positive measures that will improve the lives of families across Washington state and our country, but we still have so much more work to do. I’m more committed than ever to continuing that fight.	https://t.co/CSjE3KFd35

Nothing is more important than keeping our nation and families safe, and President Trump’s reckless decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military needlessly undermines our national security and values.	https://t.co/Rzyrh1Xi61

As a former preschool teacher, mother, and grandmother, nothing is more important to me than keeping our children safe in schools. No parent should have to fear their child won’t return when they send them to school in the morning. #MarchForOurLives
Tens of thousands of people are joining together across the country to say the time for inaction on gun safety reforms is over. Now is the time for Republicans to work with Democrats to implement universal background checks, ban assault rifles, &amp; fund research into gun violence.
“We cannot just sit here and wait for the next violent event to happen.” These young activists are our future — and I’m excited for what the future holds. 	https://t.co/qpZ1LHZGPb

Investments we make in our children are investments we make in our nation’s future. I hope you’ll join me in continuing the fight to ensure high quality public education for every student in this country.

It’s not a complicated idea: families shouldn’t have to struggle to afford the health care they need. We need to keep working towards making quality, affordable health care a reality for every patient and family in America.
Eight years ago today, @BarackObama signed the #AffordableCareAct into law &amp; since, millions have gained access to health care. We have more work to do to strengthen health care for patients &amp; families, but I’m going to keep fighting to ensure access for everyone in this country.
We should be doing everything we can to ensure that every student can access higher education without the crushing burden of student loan debt. Making college affordable needs to remain a top priority.
Under no circumstances should the Trump Administration be prioritizing the bottom lines of student loan companies over the well-being and financial security of our nation’s students.	https://t.co/LU1tzm1ZmQ
I refuse to believe that Republicans and Democrats can’t come together to enact common sense gun policies that will keep our children, families, and communities safe. We can’t sit by any longer. #MarchForOurLives.	https://t.co/w8zIYCwKAz

When I asked Secretary DeVos if survivors of gun violence, families of victims, or experts on gun safety or mental health will have a voice on President Trump’s gun commission, she couldn’t commit to that. This is unacceptable–their voices need to be heard.https://t.co/DkItk703FP

When it comes to taking meaningful steps to address gun violence, I believe at minimum we should be able to work together to pass universal background checks, which mandate a complete background check on all sales between private parties, at gun shows, and for Internet sales.
No parent should have to worry that their child won’t return home when they send them to school in the morning. We need meaningful reforms to ensure our families are safe from gun violence in their schools. One life lost is too many.

I’m concerned this commission will be just another attempt by the White House to distract from and delay meaningful gun safety action steps, so I’m going to keep asking questions, and I believe students, parents, and teachers deserve answers.
Goals, timeline, who will have a seat at the table, whether the NRA will have power to alter or veto any recommendations -- all of that was up in the air, at least as far as she was willing or able to tell me.
Overall, I was deeply troubled and disappointed by her lack of specificity and detail on a wide variety of important issues I asked her about.
Earlier this week, I met with Education Secretary DeVos to discuss President Trump’s commission on school safety -- a commission she will be leading.	https://t.co/1jOK64R7kV
RT if you agree: Arming our teachers is NOT the answer to our nation’s gun violence epidemic. We need real solutions, including a ban on the sale of assault weapons to civilians. Weapons of war don’t belong in our schools or on our streets.

It’s past time for common sense gun-safety policies to keep our children and communities safer. We could start by outlawing bump stocks, the deadly accessory that enabled the horrendous tragedy we witnessed in Las Vegas.
