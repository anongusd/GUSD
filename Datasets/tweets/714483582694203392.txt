#UnitedMethodistChurches standing up for the Word of God! Time for all Christians to wake up! If you’ve never read the Bible and call yourself a Christian I suggest you read it. “In the beginning was The Word and The Word was with God &amp; The Word was God” - John 1:1 📖🙏✝️

“Evolution is good for globalism. That explains the academic &amp; media hype behind it, as well as why we are not allowed to question it.”	                   - M.S. King
Darwin’s theory of evolution=	1. No evidence	2. Denies God	3. Marx thought the theory was perfect for communism.	4. Attempts to destroy Christianity.	5. I think being created seems more plausible than evolving from some sea slime.

If you claim you are a Christian and you’ve never read The Holy Bible you are a fake Christian. How can you have faith in someone you don’t even know?
Where in the King James Holy Bible does it say to pray to Mary? There is only one way to the Heavenly Father and it’s thru Jesus Christ. You have been deceived Catholics “Come out from her and be ye separate.”
