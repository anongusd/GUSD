There are a lot of people who talk about what they want, but many of them are unwilling to receive it. Many of them are unwilling to work for it.
You can either take the greatness of God that is in you and apply to that greatness to your heart, your soul, your mind, your body, and live a great life, or possess that greatness and let it go to waste making excuses about why things aren’t getting better.

Your attitude, your behavior, and what you say are all matters of what you decided to do. Nobody made you do it.
Not only was greatness placed in you when you first believed in God, but it begins with you the moment you take responsibility for yourself.
The pursuit of happiness is not a guarantee, and what you do with it is your choice. You are responsible for yourself.
God made a way for us to be able to see a future of hope, and for that we are grateful.
We don’t like to consider the work and the effort that is required for the pursuit of happiness because we want everything to be guaranteed. As a society, whether we know it or not, we have become addicted to irresponsibility.
The wealth of this world is shifting sand, and never secure or constant. But God is never-changing, and He has promised that you will never want.		 #qotd #quoteoftheday #totd #thoughtoftheday https://t.co/haoHykOhrq
You are responsible for how you get to happiness. You choose your path and you pursue it, because when you possess it, it will be yours and yours alone.
You have an individual responsibility that if God gave you life, and you have liberty, then to pursue happiness.
The pursuit of happiness seems so simple, but in reality, it is the greatest struggle of every man’s life.
We don’t need to find greatness. We need to turn greatness loose! Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered.

Don’t let the world weigh you down, don’t let critics slow you down, and don’t let burdens bring you down. But let the greatness of God arise in you and let His enemies be scattered!
The greatness that you are looking for is not something that was created by man, it is something that came from almighty God, and when you received Him, He gave it to you.
God knows what is ahead of you and He is preparing you a way through it.

Recognize that the same great God that made the great heavens and this great earth created you.
The Bible says God has numbered the stars and He calls them by name (Psalm 147:4; Isaiah 40:26). What we cannot even count, God knows personally.
Oftentimes we just forget how great God is. Everything God did in the Bible was great. We can’t even begin to put down on paper the number of great things He has done.

We are continuously surrounded by greatness but seldom recognize it. The sun that shines every day is a great thing, but we rarely take the time to acknowledge it.
Times are changing, but God’s Word is not.
Sometimes taking the steps God has laid out for you is easy and sometimes you need God to show you the steps personally. Regardless, I promise you if you ask you will receive and if you seek you shall find, and if you knock, the door shall be open to you.
It is the awesome power of the anointing that makes the immovable come tumbling down.

Struggle does not mean that you are not spiritual, struggle means that you are human. Struggle means that you are alive and breathing.
When you have the anointing and people see the anointing in your life, those who aren’t anointed will resist you.
Many people who regret their sin, but regret doesn’t repent you from sin. You may regret a lot of things, but repentance is when you stop sinning. If you regret, the devil will use shame to get you to do it again, but if you stop and you return to God, you have repented. https://t.co/ZrcmUqCGQV
The anointing does not get you out of trouble. The anointing is the power of God that pulls you through the trouble.

When you repent, you invite the blessings of God to invade your life.
I am thankful that God is faithful and just, and that the “if” is not in Him.
Repentance is absolutely effective. Repentance is not a feeling that gives us confirmation. Repentance is a fact. 1 John 1:9 “If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.”
Everybody needs repentance. 1 John 1:8 says very clearly, “If we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” God commands ALL men everywhere to repent (Acts 17:30).
Repent that your sins may be blotted out. That times of refreshing may come.” Acts 3:19.

When you remember that we are God’s sheep and He is our shepherd, the joy of the Lord begins to fill your heart until you feel like shouting. - @PastorMattHagee
If your mood is connected to the things that are around you, then your mood is going to look like the stock market: up, down, up, down.  - @PastorMattHagee
Joy has nothing to do with circumstance. Joy has to do simply with the abiding presence of God in your life.  - @PastorMattHagee
There are a number of challenges facing each of us. There are enormous economic challenges, political challenges, and spiritual challenges. We can either ignore the giants or, with God's help, face them believing that the God who has never failed before will not fail us now. https://t.co/EdXMOoAgVd

No matter how much independence you strive to achieve in this life, you will never get big enough, strong enough, or capable enough to ever be independent of God (John 15:5).- @PastorMattHagee

It may feel like the same step you took at this time last year, but the one thing that has changed is you. Because God has given you more wisdom, God has made you stronger; God has shown Himself more real and more powerful to you.		#qotd #quoteoftheday https://t.co/tySXLNqeyJ

Regardless of the barrier between you and God’s promise, God has given you a reason to shout. When that time to shout comes, the barrier will fall and God’s promise will be fulfilled (Joshua 6:10-20).- @PastorMattHagee
You may not know something, but our God knows all things and there is not anything that is too difficult for God. - @PastorMattHagee

Restoration does not mean that there will not be resistance. So when struggle comes, remember that the struggle is intended to make you stronger. God knows your tomorrows and He knows how much strength you need to endure the battle that is coming.		#qotd #quoteoftheday https://t.co/8dY732YYfs

When you have unconfessed sin in our life, it quenches your fire. Fire cannot be sustained without a constant refreshing. That is why the Word of God is so important to the believer.
Watch LIVE and worship with us at 11 AM CT at https://t.co/ItitndYjKM as we experience a special Anointing Service at Cornerstone Church.
Until you have a desire for the Holy Spirit, you will not receive the Holy Spirit.
We know right from wrong, but we are willing to mix it, so it is more popular and palatable. You and I have a choice to make. Will we serve the one true God or will we mix the things of this world with our faith?
Your will must yield for God’s will to take over.
Whether you know it or not, and whether you like it or not, you are totally dependent upon God right where you sit. The breath you just breathed, He just gave you.
If you have been praying for years, keep praying. God’s answer is on the way. He who promised is faithful. Don’t quit.
Keep the faith, for they who endure to the end, the same shall be saved (Matthew 24:13).		#qotd #quoteoftheday https://t.co/Sa59U4XTl1
Many of you have been through too much to lose heart. The Bible says weeping endures for the night, but joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5).
We don’t get to fast-forward to the good times. We have to walk through the growing times before we can get to God’s goodness. This means we must make up our minds that we are not going to quit.
We all want to celebrate the “double portion”, but the only way we get there is to persevere so that we can see what God intends .
There is a reward for enduring, but if you are going to endure (James 5:11), you’ve got to make up your mind. Don’t quit.
God is greater than every struggle you are going through. Victory is yours through Christ your Lord!		#qotd #quoteoftheday https://t.co/4pmkM1P2hp
Have you been waiting on the Lord for an answer? Keep waiting because those who wait upon the Lord renew their strength. They shall run and not grow weary, they shall walk, and they shall not faint (Isaiah 40:31).
Have you asked God for something great? Keep asking, because He said He would show you great and mighty things that you know not. (Jeremiah 33:3).
We want God to answer us. He said, “Call upon Me and I will answer you”, “Seek and ye shall find”, “Knock and the door will be opened to you”. He has given us this privilege to do so in prayer, and yet we do not engage in prayer (Matthew 7:7).
We are fasting and praying as we prepare ourselves to be filled up and overflowing by God at this weekend's special anointing service. Join us in experiencing this very special time of breakthrough and blessing. Don't miss it!		Sunday, January 20th @ 8:30 / 11 AM https://t.co/V24SKIPmMy
The Old Testament and the New Testament echo the fact that the Just (those who live rightly with God) will live by faith. You will not do it with your works or any effort of your own; you can only do it with faith.
When you celebrate what God has done, He gives you the ability to celebrate what He is going to do. God is not just the God of yesterday. He is the God of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.		#qotd #quoteoftheday https://t.co/nv0YKcx291
If you follow God through His word, you will see that every time that God demonstrated His power, and every time that He moved mightily, He didn’t do it when men wanted Him to, He did it when he needed to.
I’m so excited about this new book from my friend @johnbevere! #GodWhereAreYouBook will help you find strength and purpose as you navigate difficult seasons. A must read! https://t.co/fpGaJgtuiZ
When the Bible says hold fast without wavering, it means don’t even flinch when it comes to believing what God’s word says it will do. Too many times we hold fast at church, but we start wavering in the parking lot. Why? Because God doesn’t move on our schedule.
God needs you to cast your cares upon Him when the weight of the world is more than you can bear. God did not intend for man to go through this life and carry the load on his own. God will carry it for you if you will trust Him with it.
He is so reliable that from the rising of the sun to the going of the same, His name is worthy to be praised.
“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” Ephesians 2:8-9 https://t.co/krtC5xCRRQ
God is faithful. Don’t you ever forget it. He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
He is faithful to hear use when we pray because Jesus said, “whatever you ask the Father in my name He will do it.”
When you consider how extremely hopeless and how lost you would be without the extreme love of God, it’s enough to give you an extreme cause to give Him an extreme shout of praise.
Don’t ever get between what Jesus is doing and someone’s need. You take them to Jesus, but don’t push them from Him.
You may have turned to the things of this world, but they will never satisfy you. Turn quickly to the cross, and you will never thirst again. -  @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/oMGZdYUdhd
Could Jesus look into your eyes and see enough faith in you to heal someone else?
“Greater things than these shall you do.” How? By the power of the Holy Spirit. @PastorMattHagee
Doubters receive nothing. Who does receive? Those who are extremely committed.
There is no reason for you to put faith in doubt. Believe in a God who can do ALL things.
The only reason that we can go boldly before the throne of grace and receive mercy through prayer in an hour of need is not because of anything we have done, but instead because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross (Ephesians 2: 13). - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/hsAB5LIFdZ
When you have talked to the Lord about what He has done, then start talking to God about what he is going to do.
A prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian. A prayerless church is a weak church. A prayerless nation is a weak nation. A prayerless business is a weak business. You want power with God? Learn to pray.
Prayer is how you maintain spiritual vitality.
The anointing is not a one-time event, won't get you out of trouble, and it's not optional.

If the Son of God needed to pray, don’t you think that we should too? If the disciples knew that they needed to learn to pray, don’t you think we should learn too?
Prayer is learned. That is why the disciples said, “Lord teach us to pray”. You don’t just wake up a prayer warrior, you learn to pray.
We read that the fervent prayer of the righteous avails to much. How much does it avail? Elijah shut off the rain for 3 years and 6 months and then he turned it back on again. How? Prayer. (James 5:16-18).
Whatever gift God has given you, I assure you, when you take what’s in your hand and you put it in God’s hand it will become more than you can ask, think, or imagine.
You want to know what it takes for you to have the opportunity to change the world? Pray.
Let us rejoice in the joy of our salvation as God has given us the triumph over the world, the flesh, and the devil by the precious blood that has redeemed us and washed us white as snow (1 Corinthians 1:18). -  @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/iJaWIchGqo
You may have allowed circumstances and failure to redefine you, you may have quit trying, you may have given up on yourself, but God will never give up on you. You only have to have the courage to try again.
You may feel like what God is asking you to do is impossible, but you need to know that the same "I am" who was with Moses is the same "I am" that is with you.
Prayer is not a monologue. Prayer is dialogue. Prayer is something that must be developed.
God is saying to you as He said to Moses, "It doesn't really matter what you think you are or you are not. The only thing that matters in your life is who I am."
"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." 1 Corinthians 1:18 https://t.co/VxIdzrCcfr
The question when it comes to fasting is not, “Will God move?”, it is, “Will we move in agreement with God”?
How many of you had a dream? Because of failure you've given up on that dream. God wants you to go back to the place where you said you’d never try again. God says, right where you left off is right where we are going to pick it back up.
Child of God, let His love replace your pain and turn aside to see what God can do in you.
His promise for you is “many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all” (Psalms 34:19).
Celebrate who God is and what He has done. Give God thanks and praise for every promise that He has made and kept. Give God thanks and praise for the way He has blessed your life.   - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/0aRgWNRqGU
Child of God, you are not powerless if you will pray.
I want you to hear God’s voice calling deep down inside of you. I want you to stop talking about what you’ve been through and start talking about the One that has a plan for you.
Moses refused to allow bitterness to replace the thirst that he had in his heart for the things of God. Will you?
Don’t you think it’s time we pray? The only individual who has the ability to make a difference in the world you live in is the One who created it back in Genesis, and the only way to speak to Him is when you pray.
Look at what Jesus Christ has done in your life and rejoice in the joy of your salvation! We should then see how when there was not enough, He became a God of more than enough. When we couldn’t find a way, He made a way.  - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/VBvzQhHG4I
The only way you wage war in heavenly places is through the power of prayer.

God loves to show up in desolate places. Some of you may feel like you are walking through a desolate place in your life and you don’t know what good can come out of it. You need to know that God moves in desolate places.
Failure is something God can take, if you’ll give it to Him, and allow all of the things that you wanted to accomplish to be done by His might, by His power, and in His glory.
Moses allowed failure to redefine him. Have you? You don’t need to let failure define you. Failure is not a definition. Failure is nothing more than a stepping-stone that God uses to help you understand who He is and what He can do in your life.
The cross is a place of triumph because no one has ever come to the cross and been rejected.  - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/uqvdaKkZFa
Most people consider prayer to be a drive-through window. It is where they pull up and they don’t have time to stay, but they want to make sure their order gets in and everything gets just to be like they want it before they take off again.
I want you to stop looking at the desert that you are living in and start looking at the Promised Land that’s flowing with milk and honey that he has prepared for you.
Prayer is where God and I have a conversation. Not only do I get the opportunity to speak to Him, but also God very dearly wants to speak to me.
Don’t let failure define you, but you define failure as nothing more than a stepping-stone to your divine destiny.
I am thankful for the power of God. But if I am going to plug into the power of God, I can only go to one place and connect, and that is the cross. - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/Q5lac37OSw
Out of all of the kinds of courage that you can have in this life, the one kind of courage that will serve you well and never fail you is the courage to try again.
Rather than worry about your tomorrow, be thankful unto God and bless His name.

In the book of Judges, we see a parallel of the world we live in today. Judges was a time when people forgot God. Judges was a time of social disorder and political chaos. The dates of the newspapers change, but the headlines of history never do.  - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/4tUD8d9BQc

We live in a world where wrong is now right and right is now wrong, but whose side are you on? Are you on God's side?

The Holy Spirit is not a dictator. He does not come in and overrule your will. He comes in a spirit of peace and calm, and He brings freedom, not bondage (2 Cor. 3:17). @PastorMattHagee

Doubters receive nothing. Who does receive? Those who are extremely committed.
There is no reason for you to put faith in doubt. Believe in a God who can do ALL things.
There is a struggle in you. A power struggle. Something that is always there that you don’t have the strength in your own self to fight it. God wants to do something for you that you cannot do for yourself. God wants to stop sin before sin stops you. - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/RgXn3bLdTn
When you have talked to the Lord about what He has done, then start talking to God about what he is going to do.
A prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian. A prayerless church is a weak church. A prayerless nation is a weak nation. A prayerless business is a weak business. You want power with God? Learn to pray.
Prayer is how you maintain spiritual vitality.
If the Son of God needed to pray, don’t you think that we should too? If the disciples knew that they needed to learn to pray, don’t you think we should learn too?
Child of God, let God’s love replace your pain and turn aside to see what God can do in you. - @PastorMattHagee https://t.co/wacILLkXVz
Prayer is learned. That is why the disciples said, “Lord teach us to pray”. You don’t just wake up a prayer warrior, you learn to pray.
We read that the fervent prayer of the righteous avails to much. How much does it avail? Elijah shut off the rain for 3 years and 6 months and then he turned it back on again. How? Prayer. (James 5:16-18).
Whatever gift God has given you, I assure you, when you take what’s in your hand and you put it in God’s hand it will become more than you can ask, think, or imagine.

You want to know what it takes for you to have the opportunity to change the world? Pray.
In the Word of God, according to James, it says that trials produce patience and when patience has its perfect work; you are going to be perfect and complete, lacking nothing (James 1:4). https://t.co/nWr2AbptKQ
You may have allowed circumstances and failure to redefine you, you may have quit trying, you may have given up on yourself, but God will never give up on you. You only have to have the courage to try again.
You may feel like what God is asking you to do is impossible, but you need to know that the same "I am" who was with Moses is the same "I am" that is with you.
Prayer is not a monologue. Prayer is dialogue. Prayer is something that must be developed.
God is saying to you as He said to Moses, "It doesn't really matter what you think you are or you are not. The only thing that matters in your life is who I am."
What would happen in our lives if we were to expect the unexpected? https://t.co/HoUyuKybPo
The question when it comes to fasting is not, “Will God move?”, it is, “Will we move in agreement with God”?
How many of you had a dream? Because of failure you've given up on that dream. God wants you to go back to the place where you said you’d never try again. God says, right where you left off is right where we are going to pick it back up.
Child of God, let His love replace your pain and turn aside to see what God can do in you.
His promise for you is “many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all” (Psalms 34:19).
They may have taken prayer out of school, but have they taken prayer out of you? You can pray any day, anyway, and any time that you want to, need to, or have to. God did not say wait until the judge says so, He said, “Let the redeemed of the Lord say so” (Psalm 107:2). https://t.co/ync4lpfEZ5
Child of God, you are not powerless if you will pray.
I want you to hear God’s voice calling deep down inside of you. I want you to stop talking about what you’ve been through and start talking about the One that has a plan for you.
Moses refused to allow bitterness to replace the thirst that he had in his heart for the things of God. Will you?

Don’t you think it’s time we pray? The only individual who has the ability to make a difference in the world you live in is the One who created it back in Genesis, and the only way to speak to Him is when you pray.
The only way you wage war in heavenly places is through the power of prayer.
God loves to show up in desolate places. Some of you may feel like you are walking through a desolate place in your life and you don’t know what good can come out of it. You need to know that God moves in desolate places.
Failure is something God can take, if you’ll give it to Him, and allow all of the things that you wanted to accomplish to be done by His might, by His power, and in His glory.
Moses allowed failure to redefine him. Have you? You don’t need to let failure define you. Failure is not a definition. Failure is nothing more than a stepping-stone that God uses to help you understand who He is and what He can do in your life.
God cannot hear you if you are not speaking. Seek God through prayer. David said, “I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and He delivered me from all of my fears.” (Psalm 34:4). https://t.co/mBJCGHW4R4
Most people consider prayer to be a drive-through window. It is where they pull up and they don’t have time to stay, but they want to make sure their order gets in and everything gets just to be like they want it before they take off again.
I want you to stop looking at the desert that you are living in and start looking at the Promised Land that’s flowing with milk and honey that he has prepared for you.
Prayer is where God and I have a conversation. Not only do I get the opportunity to speak to Him, but also God very dearly wants to speak to me.
Don’t let failure define you, but you define failure as nothing more than a stepping-stone to your divine destiny.
During a season of growing pains, if you are willing to take God at His word, seek Him, and do what He asks even when others disagree, God will bless you with blessings that you cannot contain (Malachi 3:10). https://t.co/53FkPiPQxT
Out of all of the kinds of courage that you can have in this life, the one kind of courage that will serve you well and never fail you is the courage to try again.
God looks at the bound and says, I will set you free. You need only to seek Him.
Whatever need you are facing today, I know that God can provide it. Seek Him.
Do not sit in your comfort zone. Be willing to let Jesus take you places you never imagined by seeking Him through prayer.

We know what the Bible says about tithing, God said, “Bring all of the tithes into the storehouse” (Malachi 3:10). When you don’t tithe it is not a financial decision. God says it is a sin (James 4:17).
There are a lot of God’s children that want to be around people who are praising, but they don’t want to lift their hands and praise.

There are a lot of God’s children that want to be around people who are praying but don’t want to work out their salvation and pray (Philippians 2:12).
“Work out your own salvation” (Philippians 2:12). You have to put out the effort to grow.-
When you call upon the Lord, He is faithful to answer. God did not say, “Call upon me and if I am in the mood, I might answer.” God said, “Call upon me, and I WILL answer you and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know” (Jeremiah 33:3). https://t.co/xW7stEtQVC
God will take you from glory to glory to glory to glory.
Let your teacup faith begin to grow so God can do more in your life.
The way we seek the Lord is through prayer.
People ask, “Where is my breakthrough?” God asks, “How long are you going to wait to go to work?”
It is childlike to follow Jesus Christ, and it is childish to resist Him. The more childlike we are, the more we are willing to trust Him with all of our hearts, then the Bible says that He will direct our path (Proverbs 3:6). https://t.co/uAs8nm21MD
People ask, “Where are my miracles?” God asks, “Where is your effort?”
People say, “Where is my blessing?” God says, “Where is your faith?”
When all we do is shout and do not serve, we only have a teacup faith.
There isn’t anything that God cannot do for you!
Answer the knock on the door of your heart, and you’ll step outside into a place where you’re going to have to trust God. https://t.co/Y6aAKR0Sbg
We know that the life that we live is not a life that is void of struggle. When you become a child of God, you don’t get a “get out of jail free” card to avoid trouble. But when you are God’s child, you have an opportunity to succeed despite the struggle.
Your sorrow can turn into dancing and your doubt can turn into joy.
There is truly nothing too hard for God.

When your heart breaks, you need to know it is okay to cry. There is nothing strong about stoicism.
We tell ourselves, “My best is yet to be,” that is because you are not right where God wants you to be. On your way, do everything that God wants you to do.
Until you kick the devil out of your mind, you will never receive what Jesus Christ wants to do in your life.
If you want to be touched by God, then recognize why He sent His son, and allow Him to do His work in your life.
The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few (Luke 10:2). Your church needs you, and you need your church.
Don’t allow fear to keep you from walking into tomorrow because God has not given you a spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). https://t.co/k9Puwfeg5J
Set social media aside and pick up the Word of God and see what God does.
Always consider what God has done and be thankful unto Him and bless His name. Thanksgiving is what opens the windows of Heaven and pours out blessings on your life.
When you have had a good year, give thanks. When it has been a long year, give thanks (1 Thessalonians 5:18).
Rather than whine, lift your hands, raise your voice, and give God thanks for who He is and what He is going to do.
When you realize that you cannot live without Jesus, you are going to develop the patience that gives you the opportunity to be perfect and complete, lacking nothing (James 1:4). https://t.co/lc0r19Jt6L

Be amazed when God’s goodness and mercy follow you.
Be amazed when God listens to every word you whisper in prayer.
You didn’t create today, and you don’t have the promise of tomorrow, but you know who holds tomorrow. Be amazed when God’s loving-kindness and His mercies are renewed, and He gives you another tomorrow.
I challenge you to try this tomorrow: when the alarm clock rings in the morning say, “Praise God!” Why? Because you’re merely amazed that you get to wake up.
It’s a very uncomfortable thing when you start to consider how much God can do in your life and the uncertainty of what you may encounter. You need to know that God is not interested in your comfort, He is interested in your capability. https://t.co/tX10BjcDyD

Thanksgiving is not just an attitude or choice; it is a command (Psalm 34:1).
Think of how far God’s goodness has brought you and be thankful unto Him.
Growth comes through struggle. Why should you count it all joy? Because when you go into a trial, you are entering into a growth spurt (James 1:2). It may not sound like fun, but I assure you that you would rather go through the growth spurt than have your growth stunted. https://t.co/ulc0U5rOL9
Right now, wherever you are, look back at all that God has done in your life and ask yourself if you don’t have a reason to be thankful.

How soon we forget to consider what great things God has done with small beginnings.

The culture may want to change God, but He is immovable, He is unshakeable. He is from everlasting to everlasting; He is the one that we call faithful and true. When we deny Him, He still will not deny us, because He cannot deny Himself.
When you have unconfessed sin in our life, it quenches your fire. Fire cannot be sustained without a constant refreshing. That is why the Word of God is so important to the believer.

We know right from wrong, but we are willing to mix it, so it is more popular and palatable. You and I have a choice to make. Will we serve the one true God or will we mix the things of this world with our faith?
Your will must yield for God’s will to take over.
Whether you know it or not, and whether you like it or not, you are totally dependent upon God right where you sit. The breath you just breathed, He just gave you.
Your ways and your time are not God’s ways and God’s time. You have to be patient and wait on the grace to grow what He has put in you. https://t.co/uBSvtkm7TW
If you have been praying for years, keep praying. God’s answer is on the way. He who promised is faithful. Don’t quit.
Many of you have been through too much to lose heart. The Bible says weeping endures for the night, but joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5).
We don’t get to fast-forward to the good times. We have to walk through the growing times before we can get to God’s goodness. This means we must make up our minds that we are not going to quit.
We all want to celebrate the “double portion”, but the only way we get there is to persevere so that we can see what God intends .
The spirit and the grace to grow come from recognizing what John the Baptist said, “I must decrease that He might increase” (John 3:30). I have to allow myself to become less so that Jesus Christ in me can become more. https://t.co/Bcn0PadKso
There is a reward for enduring, but if you are going to endure (James 5:11), you’ve got to make up your mind. Don’t quit.
Have you been waiting on the Lord for an answer? Keep waiting because those who wait upon the Lord renew their strength. They shall run and not grow weary, they shall walk, and they shall not faint (Isaiah 40:31).
Have you asked God for something great? Keep asking, because He said He would show you great and mighty things that you know not. (Jeremiah 33:3).

We want God to answer us. He said, “Call upon Me and I will answer you”, “Seek and ye shall find”, “Knock and the door will be opened to you”. He has given us this privilege to do so in prayer, and yet we do not engage in prayer (Matthew 7:7).
The Old Testament and the New Testament echo the fact that the Just (those who live rightly with God) will live by faith. You will not do it with your works or any effort of your own; you can only do it with faith.
If you follow God through His word, you will see that every time that God demonstrated His power, and every time that He moved mightily, He didn’t do it when men wanted Him to, He did it when he needed to.
When the Bible says hold fast without wavering, it means don’t even flinch when it comes to believing what God’s word says it will do. Too many times we hold fast at church, but we start wavering in the parking lot. Why? Because God doesn’t move on our schedule.
God needs you to cast your cares upon Him when the weight of the world is more than you can bear. God did not intend for man to go through this life and carry the load on his own. God will carry it for you if you will trust Him with it.
It is grace that grows you (2 Peter 3:18). When we come to growing in Christ, how do we do it? Through faith. Grace is what God gives to you. Faith is what you give to God. https://t.co/Onvsa3uam2
He is so reliable that from the rising of the sun to the going of the same, His name is worthy to be praised.
God is faithful. Don’t you ever forget it. He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
He is faithful to hear use when we pray because Jesus said, “whatever you ask the Father in my name He will do it.”
When you consider how extremely hopeless and how lost you would be without the extreme love of God, it’s enough to give you an extreme cause to give Him an extreme shout of praise.
God extends everything to you through grace. Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in our hour of need.” When it comes to receiving grace, our proper response is to do so with the return of faith (Hebrews 11:6). https://t.co/hgBXRS2eFq
Don’t ever get between what Jesus is doing and someone’s need. You take them to Jesus, but don’t push them from Him.
Could Jesus look into your eyes and see enough faith in you to heal someone else?
Doubters receive nothing. Who does receive? Those who are extremely committed.
There is no reason for you to put faith in doubt. Believe in a God who can do ALL things.
Denial is not a solution. Denial doesn’t change reality. We have to recognize that there are things in each and every one of our lives that God needs to change and the only way it is going to change is if we are willing to confront and turn from it. https://t.co/cqLJlnPDj4

If the Son of God needed to pray, don’t you think that we should too? If the disciples knew that they needed to learn to pray, don’t you think we should learn too?
God’s grace planted you where you are, but it is faith that keeps you there. It takes faith for you to grow. https://t.co/k6behDVMhq
Prayer is learned. That is why the disciples said, “Lord teach us to pray”. You don’t just wake up a prayer warrior, you learn to pray.
From the heights of the Masada to the depths of the Dead Sea and across the wilderness, the land of Israel is breathtaking.		#JubileeTour2018 #Israel https://t.co/QryiWsWTrC
We read that the fervent prayer of the righteous avails to much. How much does it avail? Elijah shut off the rain for 3 years and 6 months and then he turned it back on again. How? Prayer. (James 5:16-18).
Whatever gift God has given you, I assure you, when you take what’s in your hand and you put it in God’s hand it will become more than you can ask, think, or imagine.
You want to know what it takes for you to have the opportunity to change the world? Pray.
Where you’re going, you’ve got all you need because God is your healer, your provider, and your waymaker. https://t.co/wgVwf0QdPO
The day was full of sights from the Herodian Quarter, Via Dolorosa, Western Wall Tunnels to the City of David concluding with a night to honor my Dad at a 60th Anniversary Jubilee Celebration Dinner. It was spectacular!		#JubileeTour2018 #Jerusalem #CityofDavid #celebration https://t.co/GlXBOtRKrD
You may have allowed circumstances and failure to redefine you, you may have quit trying, you may have given up on yourself, but God will never give up on you. You only have to have the courage to try again.
You may feel like what God is asking you to do is impossible, but you need to know that the same "I am" who was with Moses is the same "I am" that is with you.
Prayer is not a monologue. Prayer is dialogue. Prayer is something that must be developed.
God is saying to you as He said to Moses, "It doesn't really matter what you think you are or you are not. The only thing that matters in your life is who I am."
There are a lot of people that get a touch from God but don’t take care of their past, and when things become uncomfortable, they revert to the past. That’s not good enough. Rise! Take up your bed (John 5:2-9) and leave your past behind. https://t.co/8uSIFh762j
Do you worry about trouble for tomorrow before tomorrow even gets here? God is not hemmed in by your wristwatch. God is already in your tomorrow working out your answer before you even know the problem (Matthew 6:34).
From the Mount of Olives to the Garden of Gethsemane and the Pool at Bethesda, the day was filled with significance including a special time of worship and anointing.		#JubileeTour2018 #cityofGod #Israel https://t.co/E37PZuXJHf
The only way you can experience miracles is if you’re willing to endure.
Whenever we see those that we love are hurting, visit without invitation. Go knock on their door, and if all you can do is sit there and say nothing, show them comfort and love and kindness.
The more you are honest with your spouse about what you are facing, the more your relationship will be stronger and grow. Tell them the truth.

Allow the Holy Spirit to do a quiet work in you.
Can we not trust God as we can in the bad as we can in the good? Trust Him in all seasons.
When you believe, you’ll be blessed. However, there is a condition to this belief; you have to behave as you believe.
He sees you. He sees the things you are trying to hide from others. He sees the things you don’t say to anybody else. He knows the heartache you’ve been through. He knows the times you’ve tried and failed. He knows what you want for tomorrow, and He knows what you need. https://t.co/qwbEVf4Cy8
Don’t tell God what you’ve been through, look through the eyes of faith and what you’re going to and understand that there is nothing too hard for God.

Even though it feels like you are beyond repair, God has made a way where there seems to be no way.
Even though you’re desperate today, God sees a day when you will flourish tomorrow.

Jesus crushed the head of the devil when He knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane and said, “Nevertheless not my will but thine be done.”
Jesus crushes the devil when He calls the lame to leap,  the dumb to speak,  the blind to see, and the deaf to hear again.
God saw in Gideon what He could do, not what He was doing (Judges 6:11-12).
So much of the Bible is just considered verses that we can skim through. But whenever you consider them in God’s purpose and His plan, it is a blessing to know that every page of the past is a message to you today. https://t.co/7k9AjXIaOX

From sailing on the Sea of Galilee to walking the streets of Capernaum and Bethsaida, it was a delightful first day on the Diamond Jubilee Tour 2018. I am always so humbled as I experience the places Jesus himself walked.		#JubileeTour2018 #Israel #Jesus https://t.co/vfQs52FjnX
God can bring manna out of Heaven and cause the Sun to stand still while you conquer your enemies.
Ask God to forgive you for being impatient and taking matters into your own hands rather than trusting in Him. Let His Word abide in you.
Stop being impatient and start allowing the Word of God to come alive in your life.

You are who God created you to be. You are not defined by your limitation. You are called and created in the image of a God who is magnificent, awesome, and mighty. https://t.co/fN1cJboiKY
In your due season you’ll recognize that you are not the victim, but the victor.
Only when you abide and persist will you get to your season where the harvest comes. Then you’ll see God fulfill your vision. Then you will see God’s provision.
If you do not abide, He cannot provide (John 15:5).
If you children should scatter, even if they walk away, God will bring them back to the Cross, redemption, and faith.
God is not the author of confusion. Where the power and the presence of the Holy Spirit is, there is freedom, liberty, and unity, and clarity. https://t.co/W5cyFxOGUm
If you go through the shadow of sickness, the Great Physician is the Light of the world, and He destroys that infirmity.
Even though you are going through a storm, the One who rides upon the wings of the storm is with you.
Even though you are going through a dark valley, the Light of the world is walking beside you.
Between the vision and the provision, you have to be patient. How? Abide in the Word. Speak the Word.
God is a righteous judge, and in His righteousness, He has permission to convict us of all things. Yet, in His mercy, God has forgiven us of everything. What a mighty God we serve. https://t.co/rfO0cy2Jh9
You let the Written Word become the Spoken Word and when the world comes up to you, tell it that God has a plan for your future.

Debt is the end result of impatience. You didn’t have the patience to take the time to earn it so you borrowed it and now you can’t pay back what you borrowed.
Your life will spiritually, financially, and emotionally take time to become abundant. Let patience have its perfect work.
Consider all that you have allowed impatience to destroy in your life. Be patient (James 1:4).
Growing fruit takes time. Don’t limit the impact of your fruit. You have to abide. You have to be patient (James 1:4). You cannot get out in front of God. He is the keeper of the vine. He knows when your harvest is coming.
If you’re inhaling and exhaling you’ve got a reason to rejoice.
There is not one problem that you have that God cannot begin to work in your life right where you are. In His sovereignty, He knows your needs. God knows, and God is able. https://t.co/QCK6G3q8qJ

Connect yourself to the Vine,  abide, and let other generations follow you.
The devil is a liar, and Jesus Christ is the great Physician that can conquer every sickness and disease.
You have a decision to make to either allow yourself to be distracted by betrayal, blame, struggle, the past, fear of the future, and by others, or you can decide to be persistent.
On the other side of your struggle, you will be successful (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).
God’s Word is still true. There is no statute of limitations on God’s power. What He has done He can do, and He will do tomorrow. https://t.co/c45IFkQbGY
Do not be distracted by struggle, but press on knowing that you are more than a conqueror through Christ and that He is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
The Bible says that in every conflict you are the conqueror and in every struggle, you have the promise of success.
The bible does not give a believe a promise of life without struggle. Everyone who has ever walked by faith has walked through struggle. The Bible does not give you the promise that you will never know a day of conflict.

A good business requires a persistent businessman. A good marriage requires a persistent spouse. Something in your life may not be perfect, but if you stay with it, it will get better.
There is nothing half-hearted or lukewarm about persistence. Everything that is worth having requires persistence.
Stop waiting and wondering when the time is right. Start believing that God has better things for you tomorrow than you’ve ever known in your past. When Jesus shows up, the time is right! https://t.co/3ihti59n73

Maybe you’ve heavy burdened, but I came to tell you to cast all of your cares on Him who cares for you and lay aside every weight beset you and run with endurance knowing that if God be for you, who can be against you?
Maybe you have been held back, but you’ve got to shake off the heavy bands of other people’s statements in Christ Jesus the Lord.
There is a power in persistence. There is a power in staying focused. There is a power in not becoming distracted.
The God that is inside of you is much greater than the hell that opposes you. https://t.co/BY9viRvxdg
Because you refuse to quit and do not get distracted, you will win the day. Your prayer will be answered, and your need will be met.
When you persist in prayer, you receive what you need, you receive what you do not have, and you receive all that is necessary to be a blessing to those that are in your household.
Whenever you find yourself in a moment of need that you can’t meet, seek and you’ll find, ask and you’ll receive, knock and the door shall be opened.
There is power from persistence. Turn aside from every distraction and everything that will take your focus away from what God would have you accomplish.
If you have faith in God, you’ll understand what it means when I say, the long wait is over. The destiny that God created for you will come to pass. https://t.co/eugNkKDS6p

Many of you know what you need, and you know how to get it, but you have allowed something to distract you from persisting until you have received the answer you have longed for. Do not be distracted.
For everyone that is suffering from a broken heart and wondering how to handle it. See in God’s Word hope, power, and a promise from a God who can make a way that you might recover.
The thing about faith is, God didn’t ask you to understand it, He just asked you to do it.

The only way you wage war in heavenly places is through the power of prayer.
Walk believing that the past is behind you and that tomorrow is a place of victory and know that when you go on your walk, you’re going to meet some people that don’t like the fact that you’re walking. Walk away from the excuses of yesterday and live in the glory of tomorrow. https://t.co/A4F4vzKKpY
God loves to show up in desolate places. Some of you may feel like you are walking through a desolate place in your life and you don’t know what good can come out of it. You need to know that God moves in desolate places.
Failure is something God can take, if you’ll give it to Him, and allow all of the things that you wanted to accomplish to be done by His might, by His power, and in His glory.
Moses allowed failure to redefine him. Have you? You don’t need to let failure define you. Failure is not a definition. Failure is nothing more than a stepping-stone that God uses to help you understand who He is and what He can do in your life.

Most people consider prayer to be a drive-through window. It is where they pull up and they don’t have time to stay, but they want to make sure their order gets in and everything gets just to be like they want it before they take off again.

Prayer is where God and I have a conversation. Not only do I get the opportunity to speak to Him, but also God very dearly wants to speak to me.
Don’t let failure define you, but you define failure as nothing more than a stepping-stone to your divine destiny.
Out of all of the kinds of courage that you can have in this life, the one kind of courage that will serve you well and never fail you is the courage to try again.
When you are an infant in the faith, the Word of God is milk, and as you grow it becomes bread, and as you continue developing it becomes meat. It is alive and powerful, and it gives you everything that you need every time you pick it up. https://t.co/rCBYSwYTFE
There are seasons when God uses a storm. You've just got to get used to that. There are a lot of modern Christians that don't want the struggle to last but a few seconds, but you need to know that struggle is a classroom where God teaches you strength.
The only place you discover God’s power and God’s might is in His Word.
Your circumstance may be greater than your ability, but it’s not greater than God’s ability.
You can overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil when you pick up the Word of God and use it as a two-edged sword in your life.
You’re the one who decides when to take the step after God has instructed you to walk. Walk into the future that God has ordained for you! https://t.co/yMZHj3pbOk

When you fast, you are saying, "I don’t want to become greater; I want You to become greater. I want less of me, and I want more of you." Sometimes that is an easy lyric to sing, but it is a hard line to live.
When you fast, you are demonstrating your appreciation for the Spirit that is in you that is born of God.
Spiritual growing pains come through resistance. When it comes to spiritual growth, it is accelerated not by your comfort, but by your conflict. This is why James says, “Count it all Joy when you fall into various trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.” https://t.co/gfglBgQHHK
Not only is God a masterpiece, but the work of His hands is also masterful. Therefore, God expects you to appreciate His work and not take it for granted.
Not only is God flawless all by Himself, but everything He does is equally without flaw (Matthew 5:48).
God not only does what He does to bring glory to His name, but God expects there to be an appropriate response to His will in your life. (1 Corinthians 10:31).

If you have doubt and depression in your family, the joy of the Lord that makes rich and has no sorrow can be anointed upon your entire household through the power of fasting and prayer.
If you have a sickness that is in your family, fasting, and prayer move the healing touch of God.
God has power. When we fast and pray, God’s power becomes yours.
Do not condemn others, but live by conviction. Show faithfulness rather than using your words or actions to betray God’s work. https://t.co/KvUydT307d
The way that you show the Lord that you are craving Him more than anything else is to deny yourself creature comforts.
Be proactive in your fasting. Be ready in season and out of season, because there will be desperate moments in your future and what you do to prepare yourself today will determine the success that you have tomorrow (Matthew 6:16).
Anytime you speak a word in prayer you need to do so believing (Matthew 21:22).
Certain fasts are for a set time, and there are certain fasts that are until you receive a breakthrough.
You should have been rejected, but Christ was rejected in your place so that you could be brought close to God. God turned His back on His Son so that He could turn and embrace you. You should have died, but Christ died so that you can live. https://t.co/enzdAPgL1D
Fasting done the right way will indeed give you supernatural power.

If fasting doesn’t mean anything to you, it doesn’t mean anything to God. Fasting is not intended to be comfortable. Fasting is intended to cause your flesh to back up that your spirit might go forward.
Fasting according to God’s word brings supernatural force that gives you the results that you desire. Fasting the wrong way according to the scripture yields you nothing.
Impossible is an insult to a God who says all things are possible. Jesus ignores your excuses and says, “Rise” (John 5:2-9). https://t.co/AKxqG4Azv2

The only way to receive God’s almighty power is through a fast. You may be walking under a heavy burden, shame, and despair, or fear of the past. If you want that off of you, then pray and fast.
The only way to overcome your struggles is not through your willpower but by God’s almighty power.
God’s Word has an intended purpose. God’s Word was intended to be declared, not debated. I do not debate whether or not God is a healer, I declare, “God is my healer.” https://t.co/RCYyWLlAv7
If you’ve got a struggle in your heart, in your home, or in your health, then fast and pray because God said, “when you fast I will break the yolk, and I’ll bring you liberty.”
If you are concerned about the culture and the direction of this Nation, then fast and pray.
If you’re oppressed by the past that you can’t forget, then fast and pray.
If you fast according to the Word of God, then you are taking hold of a promise that is alive, powerful, and it is sharper than any two-edged sword.
There is no limit to what God has said that He would do for those who diligently seek Him. He will not fail you. God is a way maker. God can deliver. God is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. Bless His holy name! https://t.co/052WZFzFrR
Your God is the One who created this day. He gave it to you, and He filled you with a dream. It’s not about where you are and what you are going through, it’s about where you are going. Tell the world what kind of God you have!
God’s plan for your dreams is not a source of torment about what might have been, His plan is to empower you with what will be.
Don’t quit your dream at the first sign of trouble. Everyone believes that they have a divine dream and that because they’ve got a divine dream it’s going to be easy sailing, but the first time they struggle, they forfeit. God has a plan for you.
Doubt will kill your dream. If you want to destroy anything that God will ever give you, all you have to say is, “I doubt that” (James 1:6&amp;7).
How do you forget your past hurts? Take it to the cross of Jesus Christ because it is there that He sets you free. The Bible says whom the Son sets free is free indeed (John 8:36). https://t.co/BfB4CG1aMe
Even when the whole world says your dream will never come to pass, if it is a divine dream and you continue believing in it, then God will honor that dream as long as you don’t allow doubt to interfere.
One of the most conceited and arrogant things you could ever do is believe that you already know everything and refuse to ask for advice.
Don’t let ungodly people talk you into behaving like an unbeliever; it will cost you your dream. (Galatians 5:7-8).

Refusal to listen to Godly counsel will ruin your dream. If you want to know how to accomplish the dream of your life, find someone else who has done it and ask them for advice (Proverbs 12:15).
God sees the end from the beginning. We see the here and now. The world saw Joseph in a pit, but God saw him closer to the palace. The word saw Him as Potiphar’s slave; God saw him getting closer to his divine destiny.
When people don’t understand how you act the way you act when you say, “It is well, everything will be alright,” tell them that you are not the one that has to solve this, God is.
Focusing on what you are not can kill your dream. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. God designed you and engineered you to be who you are because He’s the One who planned your destiny.
Don’t you quit on your dream. Give God a chance to show that He can still do the impossible.
If you’re having trouble getting over the hindrance of your history, I declare the Word of the Lord to you today that your past did not come to stay, but it is gone forever. A new thing God is doing in you today. https://t.co/HCb7fINBA3

God already knows what you need; He wants to know if you have the courage to ask Him. He says, “Call on me, and I’ll answer thee and show you great and mighty things that you know not” (Jeremiah 33:3).
Don’t spend your time looking over your shoulder to yesterday to determine what you cannot do tomorrow. Your yesterday is gone, and God has a better tomorrow for you. https://t.co/CD2Lr04UcF
You may not understand what’s going on in your life right now, but God is too wise to be mistaken and too loving to be unkind. Because you know who God is, and what He can do, you can claim “It is well.”
There are times when God gives you a vision of something in your tomorrow that you cannot contain today, but if you believe that the dream given to you by the Lord will come to pass, all things are possible to them that believe.
We're hosting Feast 2018 from October 26th through the 28th! This annual event is a time to celebrate the joy, goodness and many blessings of God. Reminding us what The Feast means. Each evening offers speakers including @PastorJohnHagee, Pastor @MattHagee and @DennisPrager. https://t.co/TmRACA33Oo
God’s promises are specific. God’s promises are personal. God’s promises are yours. God knows the desires of your heart. God knows what you don’t have the courage to tell anyone else.
Are you worried that your dream is impossible? God can do the impossible.
The Bible is your parameter. It is the limitation that is in place for your protection. https://t.co/F0G4AX5WwJ
Are you holding unforgiveness in your heart? You need to let it go and let God revive the dream that He’s placed inside you.
Are you killing the dream that God has for you because you are not obeying His word?
Please mark your calendars and join us as I'll be speaking at Only Believe Ministries in Botkins, Ohio on October 17th at 7 PM.	.	@peterdoseckministries https://t.co/DVioJWzXhG
What is a dream? It is a glimpse of your destiny. If God has you in one hand and your destiny in another, I assure you that your dreams will come true.
We had the privilege of hosting Matt and Laurie Crouch as they recently toured our Sanctuary of Hope. Please join us to take a look behind the scenes and TUNE IN TODAY at 5 PM CT to TBN to watch this episode and experience Sanctuary of Hope. https://t.co/vmjeORDv3c
God’s plan for your life is not hindered by what others have done to you. If you’ll forgive them, your dream will soar into the future and bring with it blessings that you’ve never known before.
Locked inside the pages of God’s Word is a life that you can live beyond limit because It says that all things are possible to them that believe (Mark 9:23). https://t.co/K8gkqQ2HFs
The culture may want to change God, but He is immovable, He is unshakeable. He is from everlasting to everlasting; He is the one that we call faithful and true. When we deny Him, He still will not deny us, because He cannot deny Himself.
When you have unconfessed sin in our life, it quenches your fire. Fire cannot be sustained without a constant refreshing. That is why the Word of God is so important to the believer.
Until you have a desire for the Holy Spirit, you will not receive the Holy Spirit.
We know right from wrong, but we are willing to mix it, so it is more popular and palatable. You and I have a choice to make. Will we serve the one true God or will we mix the things of this world with our faith?
Have the realities of life cut you down to size? Humble yourself and quit trying to reason through the problem on your own. God in His sovereign grace will exalt you in due season. https://t.co/Uynyz4NkHJ
Your will must yield for God’s will to take over.
Whether you know it or not, and whether you like it or not, you are totally dependent upon God right where you sit. The breath you just breathed, He just gave you.
If you have been praying for years, keep praying. God’s answer is on the way. He who promised is faithful. Don’t quit.
Many of you have been through too much to lose heart. The Bible says weeping endures for the night, but joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5).
If you humble yourself before God, your life will have a change in ownership from you to God. When you see what God can do with your life, it will blow your mind. God will take you from ordinary to extraordinary because He is a God that does all things well. https://t.co/3IhXrcNTY3
We don’t get to fast-forward to the good times. We have to walk through the growing times before we can get to God’s goodness. This means we must make up our minds that we are not going to quit.
We all want to celebrate the “double portion”, but the only way we get there is to persevere so that we can see what God intends .
There is a reward for enduring, but if you are going to endure (James 5:11), you’ve got to make up your mind. Don’t quit.

Have you been waiting on the Lord for an answer? Keep waiting because those who wait upon the Lord renew their strength. They shall run and not grow weary, they shall walk, and they shall not faint (Isaiah 40:31).
Have you asked God for something great? Keep asking, because He said He would show you great and mighty things that you know not. (Jeremiah 33:3).
We want God to answer us. He said, “Call upon Me and I will answer you”, “Seek and ye shall find”, “Knock and the door will be opened to you”. He has given us this privilege to do so in prayer, and yet we do not engage in prayer (Matthew 7:7).
The Old Testament and the New Testament echo the fact that the Just (those who live rightly with God) will live by faith. You will not do it with your works or any effort of your own; you can only do it with faith.
Do you have your copy of my dad's NEW BOOK, Earth's Last Empire: The Final Game of Thrones? This is his best book on biblical prophecy yet and so that you can easily understand what the Bible says about the last days. Order now at https://t.co/QLbJN7uZiN. https://t.co/oKkekowTQf
If you follow God through His word, you will see that every time that God demonstrated His power, and every time that He moved mightily, He didn’t do it when men wanted Him to, He did it when he needed to.
You may have endured and achieved, but it was God’s blessings that made the difference in your bottom line. It was not your brilliance; it was His abundance. It was God's spirit (Zechariah 4:6). https://t.co/RVfJof7x5W
When the Bible says hold fast without wavering, it means don’t even flinch when it comes to believing what God’s word says it will do. Too many times we hold fast at church, but we start wavering in the parking lot. Why? Because God doesn’t move on our schedule.
God needs you to cast your cares upon Him when the weight of the world is more than you can bear. God did not intend for man to go through this life and carry the load on his own. God will carry it for you if you will trust Him with it.

He is so reliable that from the rising of the sun to the going of the same, His name is worthy to be praised.
God is faithful. Don’t you ever forget it. He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
Humble yourself before the Lord so that in due season, He will lift you up. God can use you for His supernatural purpose. https://t.co/uD1ZHSUL8e
He is faithful to hear use when we pray because Jesus said, “whatever you ask the Father in my name He will do it.”
When you consider how extremely hopeless and how lost you would be without the extreme love of God, it’s enough to give you an extreme cause to give Him an extreme shout of praise.
Don’t ever get between what Jesus is doing and someone’s need. You take them to Jesus, but don’t push them from Him.
Could Jesus look into your eyes and see enough faith in you to heal someone else?
It doesn’t take a whole lot of light to make a difference in darkness if you are willing to let the light burn (Psalms 119:105). You may not see everything that God is going to do in your life, but you can see the next step if you will let God’s light burn in your life. https://t.co/IyNLwyaUgI
Doubters receive nothing. Who does receive? Those who are extremely committed.
There is no reason for you to put faith in doubt. Believe in a God who can do ALL things.

When you have talked to the Lord about what He has done, then start talking to God about what he is going to do.
A prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian. A prayerless church is a weak church. A prayerless nation is a weak nation. A prayerless business is a weak business. You want power with God? Learn to pray.
You cannot serve for very long in your own strength. Serve in God’s strength through the Holy Spirit, not your own. https://t.co/Dny8cAj3i9
Prayer is how you maintain spiritual vitality.
This Friday on The Difference at 8:30 AM and 3 PM CT on TBN, watch as @KendalHagee and I host @PastorChoco De Jesús, Senior Pastor of New Live Covenant Church. He’ll share what it means to lead an abundant life. https://t.co/bmgTbmMSb9
If the Son of God needed to pray, don’t you think that we should too? If the disciples knew that they needed to learn to pray, don’t you think we should learn too?
Prayer is learned. That is why the disciples said, “Lord teach us to pray”. You don’t just wake up a prayer warrior, you learn to pray.
We read that the fervent prayer of the righteous avails to much. How much does it avail? Elijah shut off the rain for 3 years and 6 months and then he turned it back on again. How? Prayer. (James 5:16-18).
You need the power of the Holy Spirit in your life to live a life with God’s power in it. https://t.co/Z0QKfHg9dk
Whatever gift God has given you, I assure you, when you take what’s in your hand and you put it in God’s hand it will become more than you can ask, think, or imagine.
You want to know what it takes for you to have the opportunity to change the world? Pray.
You may have allowed circumstances and failure to redefine you, you may have quit trying, you may have given up on yourself, but God will never give up on you. You only have to have the courage to try again.
You may feel like what God is asking you to do is impossible, but you need to know that the same "I am" who was with Moses is the same "I am" that is with you.
The Holy Spirit is a gift that God has given to His children that we may feel His presence and His power in our daily life. https://t.co/TPl4wsKHp6
Prayer is not a monologue. Prayer is dialogue. Prayer is something that must be developed.
God is saying to you as He said to Moses, "It doesn't really matter what you think you are or you are not. The only thing that matters in your life is who I am."
How many of you had a dream? Because of failure you've given up on that dream. God wants you to go back to the place where you said you’d never try again. God says, right where you left off is right where we are going to pick it back up.

Child of God, let His love replace your pain and turn aside to see what God can do in you.
His promise for you is “many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all” (Psalms 34:19).
Child of God, you are not powerless if you will pray.
I want you to hear God’s voice calling deep down inside of you. I want you to stop talking about what you’ve been through and start talking about the One that has a plan for you.
Moses refused to allow bitterness to replace the thirst that he had in his heart for the things of God. Will you?
It is imperative to live a victorious and powerful Christian life that you willingly long for and thirst for the Holy Spirit (John 7:37). https://t.co/IzsSezdJ9U
Don’t you think it’s time we pray? The only individual who has the ability to make a difference in the world you live in is the One who created it back in Genesis, and the only way to speak to Him is when you pray.
The only way you wage war in heavenly places is through the power of prayer.

God loves to show up in desolate places. Some of you may feel like you are walking through a desolate place in your life and you don’t know what good can come out of it. You need to know that God moves in desolate places.
Failure is something God can take, if you’ll give it to Him, and allow all of the things that you wanted to accomplish to be done by His might, by His power, and in His glory.
Get comfortably extreme with personal evangelism because the Bible says, “He who wins souls is wise” (Proverbs 11:30). Jesus gave this commandment to all, “Go into all the world and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Tell others what Jesus Christ has done for you. https://t.co/UfCfVFQJC7
Moses allowed failure to redefine him. Have you? You don’t need to let failure define you. Failure is not a definition. Failure is nothing more than a stepping-stone that God uses to help you understand who He is and what He can do in your life.
Most people consider prayer to be a drive-through window. It is where they pull up and they don’t have time to stay, but they want to make sure their order gets in and everything gets just to be like they want it before they take off again.
I want you to stop looking at the desert that you are living in and start looking at the Promised Land that’s flowing with milk and honey that he has prepared for you.
Prayer is where God and I have a conversation. Not only do I get the opportunity to speak to Him, but also God very dearly wants to speak to me.
The only way you get to know somebody is when you talk to them and God has spoken to us through His Word. Just take 15 minutes a day to see what God has to say through His written text and see what exciting things begin to happen in your life. https://t.co/8wximKaUHg
Don’t let failure define you, but you define failure as nothing more than a stepping-stone to your divine destiny.
Out of all of the kinds of courage that you can have in this life, the one kind of courage that will serve you well and never fail you is the courage to try again.

There are seasons when God uses a storm. You've just got to get used to that. There are a lot of modern Christians that don't want the struggle to last but a few seconds, but you need to know that struggle is a classroom where God teaches you strength.
It’s no accident that you are alive in this moment in history. God has a plan for you. Pursue Him, and He will show you great and mighty things.
Whenever you are childlike, the simplest things fill you with wonder. When is the last time you had that simple wonder in the house of God? When is the last time you came to church, and you were just amazed that the presence of God chose to build a throne upon our praises? https://t.co/C9HFVn218S
God may let you go through a fiery trial, but He’ll never leave you there. He will always be with you.
God will always use His power to perform His promise, even when you think that nothing can save you.
God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and He has all the power you’ll ever need. Call upon Him!
Mankind has confused autonomy with omnipotence. God has given us autonomy and independence. But only God is all-powerful.
There will be times in your life when you will tell yourself, “I will NEVER do that again.” But you need to know that God has a plan for you and He wants you to have the courage to try again. You may have failed the first time, but this time, “I Am” goes with you. https://t.co/YSCyhbtmWW
Our God is so rich with power and strength that even when you have no power, He is powerful enough for the both of you.
Everything we have in this life can all be traced back to God’s grace. It is what sustains us and saves us forever. -
It was because of the Cross that we are made to be joint-heirs with Christ. Without the Cross, we are nothing.
Convictions are more powerful than the culture, because one man with convictions based on the Word of God can change the culture for the better.
Child of God it is time to stand up, speak up, and shine for God’s glory. https://t.co/vOATfCYHCa
The Bible is the map for the soul, the compass that leads every child of God to eternal life. Follow it, and you won’t go astray.
We live in a time where confusion runs rampant. Thank heaven we serve a God who doesn’t cause confusion, the One that comforts us.
This life may change all the time, but the thing that should not change in it is your convictions about Jesus Christ.
The Bible is the only thing that will bring you true comfort when you’re afflicted, and true strength when you’re weak.
God’s faithfulness isn’t dependent on your faithfulness. He is the same even when we change, because He is faithful forever.
There is a right and a wrong way to do everything, but following the words of Christ will never lead you astray.
The best way you can show the Lord that you hunger and thirst for righteousness is to deny yourself and submit yourself to His will. Then you will be satisfied.
Don’t wait until trouble strikes to get right with God. Spend time with Him and develop a relationship with Him, and watch as the cares of this life fade away.
God has a plan in your life. You will see God’s miracle-working power in your life if you refuse to lean on your own understand and if you will receive the principles of God’s powerful truth in your life. https://t.co/uhJde3LsR8
A small grain of faith can move mountains of spiritual opposition in a moment if you will live in faith believing.

Any time you say a word in prayer, you need to do so with belief, for without asking in faith believing you will not receive your request
Don’t let reason convince you that what God said isn’t true. Don’t allow doubt to sabotage your faith, but trust in God and know He’ll never lead you astray.

Refuse to let the faults and failures you have experienced in the past limit you from the incredible future God has planned for you.
Child of God, if you are going through a difficult time, recognize that God has already charted the course and your weeping may endure for the night, but your joy cometh in the morning (Psalm 30:5). https://t.co/ISwPaOtf91
Saying “it’s impossible” is an insult to a God who says all things are possible to those that believe. Never quit, but endure and trust in the Lord.
Excuses will be the assassin of your future if you cling to them, but work hard for the Kingdom of God and you will be blessed.
Jesus knows about what you’re facing today. He knows how you’ve struggled with it. But He also has an answer for you, and all you have to do is ask for it.
Stop waiting for an answer from the world, stop worrying about your past, because Jesus has more amazing planned for you tomorrow then you’ve ever experienced.
It is time that we become comfortable with being extreme. Why? No matter what weapon the world wants to use against you, if you’ve got God’s Word inside of you, you can conquer the world, because the God that we serve has overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil. https://t.co/YqaJnP8Bqa
Don’t concern your time waiting for what others have promised to do for you, but instead wait for what Jesus has in store for you, because His gifts are greater than any you can receive.
Don’t worry about what the wicked are doing in this world, but celebrate that God is on His throne and everything will be alright.
How long the problem will last in your life is determined not by how long you look at the problem, but by if you look to the Problem Solver.
God has given you the victory for today, hope for tomorrow, and life for eternity.
You may be going through a hard season. You may be walking through a time in which you don’t understand what God is doing, but remember that the Bible says, “If you are thankful, the peace of God will rule your heart and your mind”  (Colossians 3:15). https://t.co/78YyvKiFJh
Christ has given you victory, He has set you free, and He has given you the ability to do all things. Live with that confidence.
Don’t worry about “when” or “what.” Just celebrate that your Savior has redeemed you.

God is still a Provider, He is still a Way-Maker, and He is still watching over the righteous.
There is nothing in this world so big that God cannot solve it. Don’t keep your head down, but lift it up. Your answer is coming.
God knew where you would be today long before you got here. He is a God who can make a way where there seems to be no way. God is already in your tomorrow. https://t.co/pH70kWaM2G
Our hope is based on what God can do, what He is doing, and what He has done, and no man can take it away.
You will never get to where God wants you in this life without struggle.
Struggle is where Jesus teaches you to stop worrying about the storm and start talking to the one who rides on the wings of the storm.
There will be a season in your life where God uses a storm. But trust in Him, for He calms the winds and the waves with a word.
Our God is the God that can go into your past to erase the pain of your past and make a way for you today. He is the God who is already working out details in your future long before you arrive in your next conflict. https://t.co/2OnO00BHga
You can either look right at your problem, or you can look past your problem to God’s answer and provision.

The only way you can receive the strength of God is through struggle.
It is better to know Jesus and be poor than to be rich in this world and be without Jesus.
Every day that God doesn’t flood the earth like He did with Noah is a day we have experienced God’s grace.
Without Christ, you and I were dead. But in Christ, we live forever.
This world has taken the grace of God for granted, while in reality we couldn’t exist without it.
Considering what Jesus Christ has done, how much He has given, and all that we have received, how can we not live heart, soul, mind, and body every day, everywhere so that the world knows we are in love with Jesus Christ? https://t.co/JgnjVFTJti
Get to know Christ better, because He gave everything He could, even His life, to get to know you better.
Everyone in this world receives everything they have by God’s grace, whether they know it or not.
The Word of God is not always comfortable. But when you are uncomfortable, if you will adhere to it, it’ll make you better.
The church in America today is more concerned with offending the wicked than preaching the truth in love.
The time has come for us to refuse to accommodate those who are walking in the world and to stand up for Jesus Christ who gave us victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil. https://t.co/Per5owQLwZ
The reason that society is crumbling is because we have removed Jesus Christ, its cornerstone, from it.
The Supreme Court doesn’t grant you freedom. The Word of God gives you freedom.
Jesus Christ is this nation’s cornerstone and foundation, and must always be if this nation is to survive.
If the world is to meet the God who is capable of all things, then the church must begin to meet needs and do the Lord’s work.
We live in such a rationed, timed-out day that we think everything starts and stops with the sun rising and the sun setting, but God is not hemmed in by time. He is eternal. https://t.co/rJ9EHx71kD
In this life, the only way you can fail is if you fail to be a witness for Christ in this dark world.
When you begin to spend time in God’s Word and have a conversation with him through His written word, exciting things will happen in your life.
In this nation, we must stop getting along to go along and start speaking up for Jesus Christ.
If we continue to let our lights be hidden, how will those living in darkness see it?
Have you misunderstood someone? From a distance and in a moment you may see one thing, but the reality is there is altogether something else. Don’t judge someone, say a prayer for them and thank God that you don’t have to carry the cross that they have to carry. https://t.co/rsKuJYhOQX
Public schools might’ve taken the Bible out of their classrooms, but there is no excuse for not having it in your home.
The Bible is either absolute or obsolete. It is either everything or nothing. The grass may wither, but the Word of God will endure forever.
If we want to turn this nation around, we need to get our faces back in God’s book and not on Facebook.

You will never be blessed in this life unless you forsake your pride and humble yourself before God.
Because Jesus died on the Cross, you are not a slave to sin. You are free and you have the victory in His name.
Ignoring something never makes it better. It never helps to ignore your problem, but give it to God and watch as He gives you the answer.
Salvation is not a right. It is a privilege and an opportunity.
Circumstances in your life may change so that when you come back to read something that you have read over and over again, this time it is different. When you read the Word, the Word is actually reading you. It is telling you things in your life you need to work on. https://t.co/L4unh6Wg2I
If you die before knowing Christ, it’s too late. You’ve got to receive Him while you live and breathe.
You can’t live without Jesus, because without Him you would face judgment.

Contrary to what you hear in our society, meekness is not weakness. It is a quiet strength.
The challenge is not that the values we hold dear is endangered in our nation. They are endangered in our churches.
If the world rejects you and God is for you, you’ve got everything you will ever need.
Because God is on your side and no man can stand against you, His goodness and mercy will be with you forever.
Don’t ever hang your head when others bash you for being blessed and favored by the Lord.
Be patient, God’s ways are not our ways. God’s time is not our time. When you get impatient with God, do you know that you don’t hurry Him along? God has eternity to wait. Oh, you’ve got a schedule? God doesn’t have a watch! https://t.co/DynxhlsdJT
It is a wonderful thing to be in God’s house, to be in His presence, and to know that He love for you is boundless.
Before the Cross, we were outsiders and nobodies. But now we are royalty as children of the Living God.
Don’t worry about the few things you don’t have and instead thank God for the countless things He has blessed you with.
Just because we in this nation know the Gospel so well doesn’t mean we should take it for granted.
Endure hardness. God will not fail you. God will give you the desires of your heart, you have to trust in Him and know that He didn’t bring you this far to let you down. https://t.co/vRC9rCwIEE
In America, God is not asking any of us to die for our faith yet. He’s just asking for us to live for it.
God’s Word requires that we change our perspective so that we can receive it and be blessed by it.
When the world around you is saturated in fear and afraid to move, you can go to the treasure of God’s Word and find courage.
As powerful as the Word of God is, it will not have any impact on your life until you receive it in faith and then allow it to work in you.
Believe that our God is able. Our God is able to overcome the limitations that others have placed on you. Whatever forecast others have placed on your future, God can cancel it in a second if you’ll put your faith in Him. https://t.co/4TaZmelr41
Believe that through the power of the Word of God, you can drive Satan out of your life.
There is power in God’s Word, and only frailty in the words of man.
Don’t be dependent on man, because they change like the wind. Depend on the Lord, and know that He is faithful to keep His Word.
Nothing will ever work in your life like the Word of God will.
No one can void God’s promise in your life. God says He is here to make sure that His word is protecting, providing, leading, guiding, pushing, dragging, pulling, moving, and it is making a way where there seems to be no way. He has put His word in you and it will come to pass. https://t.co/29G1Vuw5WK
If you listen to the Word of God, you build faith in it. But if you listen to the words of man, you build faith in the world.
The grace of God is able to provide more abundantly and fully than you can ever imagine.
It takes more courage to be humble than it does to be prideful.
Every Sunday you get the change to cast every worry, doubt, and burden upon Jesus and walk out free.
How can you say “it is well” when everything seems to be slipping through your fingers? I can say it is well because God has promised me that He can meet my needs according to His riches and glory. He has promised me that He will be all-sufficient all of the time. https://t.co/vZhQ0Qy4xF

Through the trials and troubles you face, you learn that God is on your side, and that will Him on your side you cannot fail.
God uses the problem you’re facing not to punish you, but to bring you closer to Him.
In the Bible there are 3,000 promises, and each one of them applies to you and to your life.
When you face affliction, take heart for the Bible promises that the Lord will deliver the righteous from their afflictions.

When you set aside time to be with the Lord, to make His your foremost priority, He will bless you.
Money will never give you eternal life. Fame will never give you eternal life. Only Jesus Christ will give you eternal life.
Your attitude when you do something will mean more to God than the actual act will.

Stop complaining and start giving thanks to God and watch as His miracle working power descends upon your life.
Not everything in your life has to be right for you to be thankful and praise the Lord.
God knows more about your problem than you do. Whining to Him about it does not help Him at all.
When you allow God’s word to work in your life, you suddenly discover that you have the ability to do the impossible. You begin to believe that God is not a man that He should lie, and whatever He has promised, God will do it. https://t.co/TuOCI3N9h3
Whining is a waste of time that you could’ve been using to praise the Lord.
Giving thanks to God is what opens up the windows of heaven and showers down blessings upon you.
Jesus didn’t just make your sorrows disappear. He borne them as His own and carried them far far away.

Your identity as a Christian is not found in what you do, but in what Christ has done for you.
You will never enjoy your life to the fullest until you live with the confidence of Christ.
Thank God that none of us are the same as before Christ shed His blood for us.
When God looks at you, He doesn’t see what you deserve to be. He sees you as a child of God through the work of Jesus Christ at Calvary.
It’s true that there is nothing wrong with enjoying the wonderful things that God has created for you in this life, but you don’t get to shirk your responsibility. Greatness comes when you take responsibility. Don't ignore what you should do. It’s time to do it. https://t.co/lBxnTKoehS

Our God is an unconditional God but His promises are conditional on our behavior.

When God puts His Word in you, you have a responsibility. You cannot just take that Word and sit idle; you’ve got to put the Word to work. God is going to come to check on what He has invested in you and He expects a return on investment. God wants to see growth in your life. https://t.co/Qf1OH7gVle
You can’t treat the symptoms of sin. You have to treat the root cause.
The promises in the Word of God give you the opportunity to receive again all that Satan has taken away from you.

God has designed us such that we need to take an active part in our physical, spiritual, and emotional healing.
I assure you if you yield your life to God's by pulling your will back and letting His will push forward, then exceedingly, abundantly, above all you could ask, think, or imagine will be yours. https://t.co/sNyuv1Oep8
Action must first be taken before you qualify for God’s blessings.
The Word of God is good for nothing unless you are willing to act upon it.
You may not know where your answer to your problem is coming from, but God will show you great and mighty things you know not of.
Whenever you look for a word from God, first look in His Word, then stand upon it boldly.

When America has denied the truth of God, we no longer live in a rational nation.

Truth won’t even adjust to you. But if you accept it, truth will adjust you to God’s Will.

In spite of what you are, God will never define you by your occupation. He’ll never define you by your possessions. He’ll never define you by other people’s opinions.
Consider what God has said about you…He said, “I am for you, who can be against you?” (Romans 8:31).
What is it about ideas that we always are willing to believe that somebody else has a better one? What if God has given you the idea the world is waiting to hear?
The problem with our culture is this: Instead of live a life of conviction based on what we believe, we want to live a life of convenience, and then claim our beliefs.
The culture may want to change God, but He is immovable, He is unshakeable. He is from everlasting to everlasting; He is the one that we call faithful and true. When we deny Him, He still will not deny us, because He cannot deny Himself.
We behave like independent agents wanting to negotiate the terms of our deal with God. Yet, He controls ALL things. For us to truly understand what it means to have a God that we can depend on, we have to be dependent upon Him, His goodness, His mercy, and His faithfulness. https://t.co/bNnAFZmQN8
“Jesus said to him, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.” Mark 9:23
He’ll teach you how to give (Malachi 3:8-18). Everything you have, it comes from him. Giving is not something extraordinary; giving is something that God expects. Why? Because he’s the One that has given you everything.
He wants you to sew seed, not just ask Him to bring seed. He’s waiting with hands full on purpose, but the only way it will be yours is if you are willing to work. If you will combine your blood and your sweat.
Comfort does not create quality. You cannot have quality without sacrifice.

“You are of God, Little children and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.” 1 John 4:4
When you threw your hands up and said, “I Quit!”, God said, I can use that. When you decided it was too hard, God said, “In your weakness I am made strong.” When you felt like a failure, He said, “You’re more than a conqueror”. He said, “I’ll use it all.” (2 Corinthians 12:9).
I believe in you, not just because of your potential, but I believe in you because of what I’ve seen God do in others.

“What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his soul?” Mark 8:36
We see the great things that God has used men to create on this earth. They’re just a reflection of the genius of God that has been placed inside of them. I believe that genius is in you.
If we are desperate, we turn to God as a crisis management Father, but if we are dependent we look to Him for all things. We want God to be dependable, but often our desperation is what desires His dependability. God wants you to depend on Him like you depend on your heartbeat. https://t.co/QBChJBtCum
God’s policy is still that we should love the Lord our God with all of our heart, with all of our soul, and with all of our strength (Luke 10:27).

“He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.”1 John 3:8
If you’ve got a problem, bring your excuses to Jesus. Excuses are useless to a God who can do all things.

If you want to be touched by God, then recognize why He sent His Son and allow Him to do His work in your life.

You need to know that humble beginnings always have great endings.
Whatever it is you are facing, you get to make the choice: Do I humble myself and let the Lord allow me to solve this with his help? Or, do I stand in pride and leave out here to face it on my own?
If you'll put yourself under His mighty hand, whatever He has destined you to be, you can become, because the Word of God promises that from there, He will exalt you in due season.
No matter what you are facing today, humble yourself and speak to the mountain and watch God do great and mighty things.
“Likewise, you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the Humble.” 1 Peter 5:5
What does it take to change a city? It takes a church with enough faith to believe that God can change a city. What does it take to change a family? It doesn’t take a revival; it only takes a mom, dad, son, or daughter with enough faith to believe that God can move in their home. https://t.co/W8VPjy178c
In the lives that we live, we recognize that when we humble ourselves, we receive God's blessing.
Suddenly worship is a way you can look through the storm clouds and see that God was riding on those clouds.
I don't need the explanation of why, I just need the hope of what.
How long it lasts, is not a matter of hours. It's not a matter of days, weeks, months, or years. How long the problem lasts is determined by how long you focus on the problem instead of the problem solver. It stops the second you don't look at it and you look through it to Him.
There is not one problem He cannot solve, nor one mountain in your way that He cannot move. There is not one storm you’re going through that He cannot calm. Nothing is impossible for the God that we serve. 		#nothingisimpossible #God #trials #storm #overcome #hope https://t.co/y5q6pIwYEM
God's promises are true. And they are for YOU! They will not explain the storm. They will not explain the why. But they will give you hope in what God can do.
Struggle is the place where He tells you, "No matter what the mountain, faith can move it".
When we see the storms of struggle in our life, we  worry about the clouds, the waves, and the wind, instead of remembering what Psalms 104:3 says: "God makes the clouds His chariot, and He walks on the wings of the wind.” He rides upon the storm!
Perseverance is a unique combination of grit, patience, and effort, which, at times, will require hours of intense endurance and years of patient waiting.
Regardless of the circumstance, regardless of the trial, regardless of the temptation to give up and quit, as long as we have the courage to try again, we can boldly declare, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” 		#courage #faith #God #trials #temptation #overcome #Godsplan https://t.co/ZHvybb3Bam

How can you practice being salt and light every day? How can you make a difference in everything that you have part in? In serving others. Be the light.

“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.” 1 Peter 5:6-7
The strong do, indeed, survive, so long as the strength that they rely on is the strength of the Lord and not their own.
Whenever you have a promise from God, you develop patience, because He promised it and it WILL come to pass.
Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Have faith in God.

Mark 11:23 https://t.co/LqZCw0SFaT
God always has an answer. The problem is not whether or not God has an answer. The problem is are we hearing the answer that He has.
God's primary purpose for His resources in your life is to get them through you, not to you.
Unity requires real work. It requires blood, sweat and tears. Paul said, "I die daily". He knew that he had to sacrifice his will every day if he was going to walk in unity.

Your personal achievements on this earth should not glorify yourself, but should glorify your God.

Don’t envy what others have, but instead remember all that God has done for you.
When you pursue the plans that God has for your life, then you will receive your reward.
God rewards those who diligently seek after Him.
God respects effort, not status or wealth.
You do not own anything you have. You have been entrusted with them by God as a steward of His possessions.
I rejoice because there is a God who has made a plan for me in spite of the difficulties that we are living in. There is a God who has said He will supply all of my needs according to His riches and glory. https://t.co/XENhiaJWPO
We do not work in this world for our glory and gain, but for the Lord’s.
The Bible is a book of self-examination. If you are not willing to confront what’s wrong with you, the Bible won’t ever work for you.
God loved us even when we weren’t worth saving.
Worship is not about you, your preference, or your comfort. It is solely concerned with God Almighty.
Maybe there is a dark day in your bitter past you wish you could erase. If you could get rid of that day, your life would be “perfect”. Let me tell you something, God knows about your yesterdays, and He is working in your todays, and He has plans for your tomorrows. https://t.co/B8109zgn2T
It’s no accident that you are alive in this moment in history. God has a plan for you. Pursue Him, and He will show you great and mighty things.
God may let you go through a fiery trial, but He’ll never leave you there. He will always be with you.
God will always use His power to perform His promise, even when you think that nothing can save you.
God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and He has all the power you’ll ever need. Call upon Him!
Do you want to know what it takes for you to succeed in your life? Courage. Courage to do what’s right when the world has lost its entire moral compass. We live in a world that has no idea about right and wrong, but you still need to have the courage to do right anyway. https://t.co/OPK3Ex9HoH
Mankind has confused autonomy with omnipotence. God has given us autonomy and independence. But only God is all-powerful.
Our God is so rich with power and strength that even when you have no power, He is powerful enough for the both of you.
Everything we have in this life can all be traced back to God’s grace. It is what sustains us and saves us forever. -
It was because of the Cross that we are made to be joint-heirs with Christ. Without the Cross, we are nothing.
In God’s omnipotence and in His sovereignty, the one thing He will not override is your choice. That’s why the Bible says “choose you this day whom you will serve” (Joshua 24:15). https://t.co/LosYi0DfZk
Convictions are more powerful than the culture, because one man with convictions based on the Word of God can change the culture for the better.
The Bible is the map for the soul, the compass that leads every child of God to eternal life. Follow it, and you won’t go astray.
We live in a time where confusion runs rampant. Thank heaven we serve a God who doesn’t cause confusion, the One that comforts us.
This life may change all the time, but the thing that should not change in it is your convictions about Jesus Christ.
You need to know that true beauty, true success is not gained by compliments. True beauty and true success come when you have the confidence and the courage and the contentment to be the person that God created you to be. https://t.co/jLHNaU6S50
The Bible is the only thing that will bring you true comfort when you’re afflicted, and true strength when you’re weak.
God’s faithfulness isn’t dependent on your faithfulness. He is the same even when we change, because He is faithful forever.
There is a right and a wrong way to do everything, but following the words of Christ will never lead you astray.
The best way you can show the Lord that you hunger and thirst for righteousness is to deny yourself and submit yourself to His will. Then you will be satisfied.
We live in a very dangerous age in which we as Christians, who are supposed to live lives of conviction, have decided that our positions are evolving. The bible says, “I am the Lord, I do not change. I am the same yesterday, today, and forever.” (Hebrews 13:8) https://t.co/LY5x5jSGrj
Don’t wait until trouble strikes to get right with God. Spend time with Him and develop a relationship with Him, and watch as the cares of this life fade away.
A small grain of faith can move mountains of spiritual opposition in a moment if you will live in faith believing.
Any time you say a word in prayer, you need to do so with belief, for without asking in faith believing you will not receive your request
Don’t let reason convince you that what God said isn’t true. Don’t allow doubt to sabotage your faith, but trust in God and know He’ll never lead you astray.
Refuse to let the faults and failures you have experienced in the past limit you from the incredible future God has planned for you.
Saying “it’s impossible” is an insult to a God who says all things are possible to those that believe. Never quit, but endure and trust in the Lord.
Excuses will be the assassin of your future if you cling to them, but work hard for the Kingdom of God and you will be blessed.
Jesus knows about what you’re facing today. He knows how you’ve struggled with it. But He also has an answer for you, and all you have to do is ask for it.
God can interpret your tears. God knows when you’re crying because you’re angry or you’re selfish or your heart is broken. When it comes to those broken-hearted tears, here’s what God says, (Psalm 56:8) “Your tears I’ve caught in a bottle, and I have kept a count of them” https://t.co/UtAvZTtQzV
Stop waiting for an answer from the world, stop worrying about your past, because Jesus has more amazing planned for you tomorrow then you’ve ever experienced.
Don’t concern your time waiting for what others have promised to do for you, but instead wait for what Jesus has in store for you, because His gifts are greater than any you can receive.
Don’t worry about what the wicked are doing in this world, but celebrate that God is on His throne and everything will be alright.
How long the problem will last in your life is determined not by how long you look at the problem, but by if you look to the Problem Solver.
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Word made flesh, dwelling among us, believes in you. He doesn’t believe what others are saying about you, He believes in what He created you to be. He doesn’t believe in your past, He buried it in the sea of forgetfulness. https://t.co/LpwBtESp0o
God has given you the victory for today, hope for tomorrow, and life for eternity.
Christ has given you victory, He has set you free, and He has given you the ability to do all things. Live with that confidence.
Don’t worry about “when” or “what.” Just celebrate that your Savior has redeemed you.
God is still a Provider, He is still a Way-Maker, and He is still watching over the righteous.
Have enough faith in God to put what you hold in your hand into His, and see what He does with it. When you do, you'll develop a sense of true confidence and attitude with real potential. https://t.co/BFVYeIA4e5
There is nothing in this world so big that God cannot solve it. Don’t keep your head down, but lift it up. Your answer is coming.
Our hope is based on what God can do, what He is doing, and what He has done, and no man can take it away.
You will never get to where God wants you in this life without struggle.
Struggle is where Jesus teaches you to stop worrying about the storm and start talking to the one who rides on the wings of the storm.
If you can fulfill that command - to put God above all else and others above yourself - then you will find the joy of God's purpose for your life. https://t.co/nddB8ZDzDw
There will be a season in your life where God uses a storm. But trust in Him, for He calms the winds and the waves with a word.
You can either look right at your problem, or you can look past your problem to God’s answer and provision.
God always has an answer for you, even when you have given up.
Don’t get involved in the mess of the world. Let God elevate you to where He wants you to be.
For all that unity creates and brings, it is powerless until you are willing to be unified. You cannot join with others until you are willing to sacrifice of yourself. When Jesus prayed for us, the one thing that he asked God is that we be, Unified. https://t.co/QwmDz7vwg2
The only way you can receive the strength of God is through struggle.

It is better to know Jesus and be poor than to be rich in this world and be without Jesus.
Every day that God doesn’t flood the earth like He did with Noah is a day we have experienced God’s grace.
Without Christ, you and I were dead. But in Christ, we live forever.
I don't know what storm you're going through. I don't know what struggle you're facing. I don't know if it is brand new or if it has been there all of your life. But whatever it is, God is still on His throne and the problem you have is not bigger than the God that you worship. https://t.co/ikiUny2Exn
This world has taken the grace of God for granted, while in reality we couldn’t exist without it.
Get to know Christ better, because He gave everything He could, even His life, to get to know you better.
Everyone in this world receives everything they have by God’s grace, whether they know it or not.
The Word of God is not always comfortable. But when you are uncomfortable, if you will adhere to it, it’ll make you better.
The church in America today is more concerned with offending the wicked than preaching the truth in love.
The reason that society is crumbling is because we have removed Jesus Christ, its cornerstone, from it.
The Supreme Court doesn’t grant you freedom. The Word of God gives you freedom.
Jesus Christ is this nation’s cornerstone and foundation, and must always be if this nation is to survive.
Remember this: We control nothing We are here in the position of management. To pretend that we are the owners disconnects us from God and sends us headfirst on a collision course with God, our provider. We are not here to be in control of money; we are here to manage it. https://t.co/ejidhHFN16
If the world is to meet the God who is capable of all things, then the church must begin to meet needs and do the Lord’s work.
In this life, the only way you can fail is if you fail to be a witness for Christ in this dark world.
When you begin to spend time in God’s Word and have a conversation with him through His written word, exciting things will happen in your life.
In this nation, we must stop getting along to go along and start speaking up for Jesus Christ.
Unlike the world, God has put no limitations on your potential. He made us alive when we were dead. God doesn’t improve your old flesh body. He gives you a new body with unlimited potential. https://t.co/3Yyz8NedJn
If we continue to let our lights be hidden, how will those living in darkness see it?
Public schools might’ve taken the Bible out of their classrooms, but there is no excuse for not having it in your home.
The Bible is either absolute or obsolete. It is either everything or nothing. The grass may wither, but the Word of God will endure forever.
If we want to turn this nation around, we need to get our faces back in God’s book and not on Facebook.
The standard of the Word overcomes your broken heart, it overcomes your past, it overcomes your sickness and disease, and it gives you power to move forward with the knowledge that you are a child of God, and the victory is yours through Christ! https://t.co/ftGPSEu5o4
If we are to see God take this nation back to the roots of our faith, we have to decide to not be ashamed of the Gospel.
You will never be blessed in this life unless you forsake your pride and humble yourself before God.
Because Jesus died on the Cross, you are not a slave to sin. You are free and you have the victory in His name.
Ignoring something never makes it better. It never helps to ignore your problem, but give it to God and watch as He gives you the answer.
Happy Independence Day! Today we celebrate this great nation and give thanks for our freedom. 		#Freedom #July4th #America #USA #Celebrate https://t.co/9T8qohV839
Salvation is not a right. It is a privilege and an opportunity.
If you die before knowing Christ, it’s too late. You’ve got to receive Him while you live and breathe.
You can’t live without Jesus, because without Him you would face judgment.
Truth does not come from inside of you. Truth only comes from God.
Whatever the mind can believe, it can achieve. You can change your life forever the moment you begin to believe that "greater is He that is within you than he that is in the world" (1 John 4:4). https://t.co/zhi28C1uU4
Contrary to what you hear in our society, meekness is not weakness. It is a quiet strength.
The challenge is not that the values we hold dear is endangered in our nation. They are endangered in our churches.
If the world rejects you and God is for you, you’ve got everything you will ever need.
Because God is on your side and no man can stand against you, His goodness and mercy will be with you forever.
Money may be able to buy you a number of things, it might fill your life with plenty of stuff, but what good is that stuff if you are too tormented to enjoy it? Only God can calm your storms and give you peace. Nothing the world offers can do that. https://t.co/PLP1I9wasm
Don’t ever hang your head when others bash you for being blessed and favored by the Lord.
It is a wonderful thing to be in God’s house, to be in His presence, and to know that He love for you is boundless.
Before the Cross, we were outsiders and nobodies. But now we are royalty as children of the Living God.

Don’t worry about the few things you don’t have and instead thank God for the countless things He has blessed you with.
Just because we in this nation know the Gospel so well doesn’t mean we should take it for granted.
In America, God is not asking any of us to die for our faith yet. He’s just asking for us to live for it.
You will not want to miss hearing Pastor John Hagee’s second sermon this Sunday morning titled The New World Order—From Genesis to Earth's Last Empire from his compelling sermon series Earth’s Last Empire. We'll see you here! https://t.co/Gk2S2aethj
God’s Word requires that we change our perspective so that we can receive it and be blessed by it.
When the world around you is saturated in fear and afraid to move, you can go to the treasure of God’s Word and find courage.
Triumph over deception and lies with the truth of Scripture. Triumph over poverty and lack with empowerment and kindness. Triumph over selfishness and greed with sacrifice and giving. Triumph over sorrow with the joy of the Lord, and despair with hope. https://t.co/Ce0qACE6we
As powerful as the Word of God is, it will not have any impact on your life until you receive it in faith and then allow it to work in you.
Believe that through the power of the Word of God, you can drive Satan out of your life.
There is power in God’s Word, and only frailty in the words of man.
Don’t be dependent on man, because they change like the wind. Depend on the Lord, and know that He is faithful to keep His Word.
No government can unseat our God. No scientist can disprove Him. No judge or court can overrule Him. No force on earth can take Him out. Our God is the great God. He is mighty, all-knowing and faithful to the end of the age. https://t.co/ufpJdovgRZ
Nothing will ever work in your life like the Word of God will.
If you listen to the Word of God, you build faith in it. But if you listen to the words of man, you build faith in the world.
The grace of God is able to provide more abundantly and fully than you can ever imagine.
It takes more courage to be humble than it does to be prideful.
There is no trial greater than God's grace. There is no problem that God cannot solve. There is no place where He cannot reach you. There is no wound that God cannot mend. There is no challenge that He can't help you overcome. He is can accomplish everything you ask Him to do. https://t.co/PNLAmRcqzH
Every Sunday you get the change to cast every worry, doubt, and burden upon Jesus and walk out free.
The moral insanity we see in America is not what we were created to do. We were created to glorify Him, not ourselves.
You are a little lower than an angel, not the highest form of an ape. You are fearfully and wonderfully made by a loving God.
The Bible says that pride goes before a fall, and right now modern America is getting ready to fall.
Don’t let the small-minded perspective of other people around you become your limitation. Nothing is too difficult for the God that you serve. No giant is too big for Him, no valley is too large for Him. When you need Him, God will always be your mighty fortress and your refuge. https://t.co/3uJnGMQdS6
If you’re going to put your faith and trust in anyone, put them in God.
I have a forecast of your future. If you humble yourself before God, your life will prosper.
When you depend on the Lord and humble yourself before Him, you will receive more blessings than you can contain.
“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy, I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.” John 10:10
I don’t know what you’re afraid of. I don’t know what paralyzes you and keeps you from moving forward. I don’t know what hinders greatness from coming alive in you. But I assure you, God has already conquered your fears. https://t.co/1YREKp4XRF
Through the trials and troubles you face, you learn that God is on your side, and that will Him on your side you cannot fail.
God uses the problem you’re facing not to punish you, but to bring you closer to Him.
In the Bible there are 3,000 promises, and each one of them applies to you and to your life.
When you face affliction, take heart for the Bible promises that the Lord will deliver the righteous from their afflictions.
Can you imagine what would happen if you would let go of the grudges you’ve been holding on to? Can you imagine how much more peace and joy you would have in your life if you would forgive others? Remember, forgive others because you yourself have already been forgiven. https://t.co/6F6K7HHGlc

Don’t lead yourself because it will only lead to hell. Follow God to heaven.
When you submit to God and resist the devil, then you are more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ.
When you give God your live, you are expected to stop pursuing your natural inclinations and begin to chase after God’s will for your life.
When you set aside time to be with the Lord, to make His your foremost priority, He will bless you.
Money will never give you eternal life. Fame will never give you eternal life. Only Jesus Christ will give you eternal life.
It is the truth of God that sets people free from bondage, heals people of diseases, that can reach into the past and correct what the enemy has done there, that makes your future brighter than anything you’ve ever known. https://t.co/KztffjhRpu
Your attitude when you do something will mean more to God than the actual act will.
Get rid of your murmuring and complaining spirit and allow God to rain down blessings upon you.
Stop complaining and start giving thanks to God and watch as His miracle working power descends upon your life.
Not everything in your life has to be right for you to be thankful and praise the Lord.
Prayer is the most powerful force on the face of the earth. It has conquered nations, saved lives cured disease, liberated the imprisoned and changed the course of history. What do you need to change today? Pray! https://t.co/hNBNF3gBGB
God knows more about your problem than you do. Whining to Him about it does not help Him at all.
Whining is a waste of time that you could’ve been using to praise the Lord.
Giving thanks to God is what opens up the windows of heaven and showers down blessings upon you.
Jesus didn’t just make your sorrows disappear. He borne them as His own and carried them far far away.
God makes a way where there seems to be no way. He is the one who supplies your need, who makes sure you want for nothing. When you face a problem that is as big as a mountain, remind yourself that our God moves mountains and solves problems. https://t.co/wmepJKybNW

“Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.” 1 Timothy 6:12 https://t.co/xJuN42mgqi
Until you know Jesus Christ as your Savior personally, you will never be appreciative and grateful for what He has done for you.
You don’t decide what you are. You are what God created you to be; a person fearfully and wonderfully made.
How well you remember what the Lord has done in the past will determine what the Lord will do for you in the future.
Whenever you consider all that God has done for you in your yesterdays, thank Him for what He will do in all of your tomorrows.
If He is for you, who can be against you? If you fear the unknown, fear not, for the God you serve has conquered all that is unknown. He has defeated the powers of sin and darkness, and nothing is impossible for those that believe in Him. https://t.co/VJ2hxtdjG4
God doesn’t just give us a task and hope that we’ll be able to figure it out. He shows up and He solves our problems.
If God has done something for you in the past, have faith because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever and He will do it again!
God’s hand made everything you possess, everything you have done, and your whole entire future possible.
Let’s go back to the times when families ate around the dinner table, not over Instagram.
The "truth" today in modern American is not truth. America's definition of truth is "whatever you say is true, is true." The Word of God is the standard of truth. If anyone claims they know the truth and it is not based in the Word of God, it is a blatant lie. https://t.co/SJkmnvJygF
You can have confidence that you can call upon the Lord at any time and He is faithful to answer you.

Thank God that none of us are the same as before Christ shed His blood for us.
When God looks at you, He doesn’t see what you deserve to be. He sees you as a child of God through the work of Jesus Christ at Calvary.
When you consider how great God is and all that He has done for you, the only response is celebration.
Our God is an unconditional God but His promises are conditional on our behavior.
God cannot bless you in your known disobedience.
If the enemy attacks you, the Word says no weapon formed against you shall prosper. If Satan attacks your health, remember you are healed by Christ’s wounds. If he attacks your finances, God has promised to meet your every need. In all things and at all times, trust in the Lord. https://t.co/dqHz5qFS0Y
You must believe in Christ in order to be healed.
The Word of God is either absolute or obsolete.
Unbelief is not a mindset or lifestyle. It is sin.
When you receive a Word from the Lord, don’t stand idle. Use it!
There are a lot of people that just want God to pick them up out of trouble and teleport them to the island of wonderful. He never does that. God gives you the strength to overcome your fear and conquer trouble. https://t.co/z0cqYQzYFU
If you’re lost, God is the gentle shepherd who will come to find you. If you’re sick, He’s the God that heals you of all your diseases.
You can’t treat the symptoms of sin. You have to treat the root cause.
The promises in the Word of God give you the opportunity to receive again all that Satan has taken away from you.
Take heart, for you know that whatever struggle or battle you are in will result in your victory.
You will be disappointed when you put your hope in men, but you will never be disappointed by God. https://t.co/8WDRMYqqyM
God has designed us such that we need to take an active part in our physical, spiritual, and emotional healing.
Action must first be taken before you qualify for God’s blessings.
The Word of God is good for nothing unless you are willing to act upon it.
You may not know where your answer to your problem is coming from, but God will show you great and mighty things you know not of.
James says, “Every good and perfect thing comes from above.” Therefore, everything you are, everything that you will ever be, and everything you hope to accomplish all comes in, through, and by Jesus Christ. So there is no other place to look for good and perfect things. https://t.co/pid9Ju1RIC
Whenever you look for a word from God, first look in His Word, then stand upon it boldly.
When the world has given up on you, listen to what God has to say about you.
When God looks at you, He doesn’t see a peasant. He sees royalty.
Don’t whine, but shine, for every trial doesn’t come to stay. They come to pass.
There will be times in your life that do not make any natural sense to you. You may do everything right and suddenly all hell breaks loose. In those seasons, remember you serve a supernatural God, and in spite of your changing circumstances, He will always be near to you. https://t.co/2wx021hyJV
The best motivational speeches are the speeches you give yourself.

America doesn’t have a reasonable culture. It has an insane culture.
In the big moments of your life, give thanks. In the small moments that seem insignificant, give thanks. On the good days, when everything goes right, give thanks.

“Set your minds on things above, not earthly things.” Colossians 3:2 https://t.co/Mv9OE2jqZQ
It takes just as much courage to admit that you have a problem as solving the problem.
God wants you to be a problem-solver, not part of the problem.
It is only through the grace of God that we can do anything He asks us to do.
God knows and sees the potential that is inside you. Use it!
Get the word "if" out of your vocabulary, and start saying, "With God's help and by His grace, I will." Stop listening to the mediocre minds around you, and stay focused on the magnificent thought that "all things are possible in him who believes" (Mark 9:23). https://t.co/VgJXlBtbGB
When you recognize that you can’t live without Jesus, you will know what it means to lack nothing.
You have to face struggle and trials in order to become perfect, complete, and lacking in nothing.
You can either argue about why you’re in a trial or you can thank God that the trial is there to strengthen you.
God will never give you more trouble than what you can handle.
It is in the furnace of struggle where your spiritual strength is increased.
All you have to do is ask for the favor of God and it will be bestowed upon you, because He has promised that.
It’s time that the church in this nation starts putting forth the effort to be the kind of church the Lord wants us to be.
Too often we despair over what we don’t have instead of considering all that God has done for us.
We live in a culture that embraces fables. When you're told you're the gender you feel like, it's a fable. When you're told any two people who love each other is a Biblical marriage, it's a fable.

People don’t come to church for entertainment. They come to church because they feel the presence of God.
“There are a thousand excuses for failure, but there is never a good reason.” -Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Your personal achievements on this earth should not glorify yourself, but should glorify your God.
Don’t envy what others have, but instead remember all that God has done for you.
It doesn’t matter how strong you are, it doesn’t matter how much money you have, it doesn’t matter how wise you are, if you do not put your trust in God you are bound to fail. But when you do, no matter what is in your way, He will make a way where there seems to be no way. https://t.co/KYkBMh14pk
When you pursue the plans that God has for your life, then you will receive your reward.
God rewards those who diligently seek after Him.

God is not waiting to solve your problem. God is waiting on you to take action on your problem to start working.
Faith is a belief in God instead of in ourselves. It may be difficult, but remember, without faith it is impossible to please God.

Has God not been good to you? Has God not made a way where there seemed to be no way?

God will use whatever you setback you endured in your past as a setup for your future success.
You may be feeling like the problem you’re facing is killing you, but as long as you have breath, you have a reason to praise the Lord.
God’s plan is not for you to be harmed, and that you would not receive anything good, but that you will prosper in this life.
It’s no accident that you are alive in this moment in history. God has a plan for you. Pursue Him, and He will show you great and mighty things.
We need to decide if we are going to be the church of God or just another Sunday social club. You can call yourself a church, but if He’s not the head, if He’s not in charge, if He’s not the reason we’re gathering, then all we are is a worship pit stop. https://t.co/VHdBpoz86s
God may let you go through a fiery trial, but He’ll never leave you there. He will always be with you.

The Bible is the map for the soul, the compass that leads every child of God to eternal life. Follow it, and you won’t go astray.

A small grain of faith can move mountains of spiritual opposition in a moment if you will live in faith believing.
Any time you say a word in prayer, you need to do so with belief, for without asking in faith believing you will not receive your request
Don’t let reason convince you that what God said isn’t true. Don’t allow doubt to sabotage your faith, but trust in God and know He’ll never lead you astray.

We live in a society that is suffering from a famine of God’s Word. It’s not because we don’t have access to it. Because we live in America, we have no excuse to not know the truth of the Word. We are not being asked to die for Christ - we are simply asked to live for Him. https://t.co/fMgu7ESG1O

Jesus knows about what you’re facing today. He knows how you’ve struggled with it. But He also has an answer for you, and all you have to do is ask for it.
Stop waiting for an answer from the world, stop worrying about your past, because Jesus has more amazing planned for you tomorrow then you’ve ever experienced.
God is exactly who He said He is. He is the Great Physician, He is the Friend who sticks closer than a brother, He is the one who calms storms, and He is the King of kings and Lord of Lords. He is forever worthy to be praised. https://t.co/dcTzmPCwcJ
Don’t concern your time waiting for what others have promised to do for you, but instead wait for what Jesus has in store for you, because His gifts are greater than any you can receive.
Don’t worry about what the wicked are doing in this world, but celebrate that God is on His throne and everything will be alright.
How long the problem will last in your life is determined not by how long you look at the problem, but by if you look to the Problem Solver.
God has given you the victory for today, hope for tomorrow, and life for eternity.
The only place you can put your trust is with the Lord. You can’t put it will your resources, because they will run out.

Our hope is based on what God can do, what He is doing, and what He has done, and no man can take it away.
You will never get to where God wants you in this life without struggle.

You can have confidence that you can call upon the Lord at any time and He is faithful to answer you.
Your identity as a Christian is not found in what you do, but in what Christ has done for you.
You will never enjoy your life to the fullest until you live with the confidence of Christ.
Thank God that none of us are the same as before Christ shed His blood for us.
When God looks at you, He doesn’t see what you deserve to be. He sees you as a child of God through the work of Jesus Christ at Calvary.

Our God is an unconditional God but His promises are conditional on our behavior.
God cannot bless you in your known disobedience.
You must believe in Christ in order to be healed.
God’s grace gives you the ability to breathe. God’s grace is what sustains you and everything in the world around you. God’s grace is what puts food on your table and a roof over your head. God’s grace is what gives hope to your dreams and hope for your life. https://t.co/GOOSCj0reN
The Word of God is either absolute or obsolete.
Unbelief is not a mindset or lifestyle. It is sin.
When you receive a Word from the Lord, don’t stand idle. Use it!

If you’re lost, God is the gentle shepherd who will come to find you. If you’re sick, He’s the God that heals you of all your diseases.
Don’t seek after the happiness, joy, and peace of the world. They are all self-serving, self-pleasuring emotions. Rather, seek to know the joy that God gives, a joy that abounds in trials and trouble, and a peace that surpasses understanding. https://t.co/RcaSqhCyos
You can’t treat the symptoms of sin. You have to treat the root cause.
The promises in the Word of God give you the opportunity to receive again all that Satan has taken away from you.
Take heart, for you know that whatever struggle or battle you are in will result in your victory.
God has designed us such that we need to take an active part in our physical, spiritual, and emotional healing.

Action must first be taken before you qualify for God’s blessings.
The Word of God is good for nothing unless you are willing to act upon it.
You may not know where your answer to your problem is coming from, but God will show you great and mighty things you know not of.

When America has denied the truth of God, we no longer live in a rational nation.
Truth won’t even adjust to you. But if you accept it, truth will adjust you to God’s Will.
Nobody belongs in heaven, but God has invited all of us to join Him there.
The truth of God doesn’t conform to your reality. It transcends reality.
Christ didn’t say “I know the truth.” He said “I am the truth.”
God said He’d show you great and mighty things that you know not of. Have you been waiting on the Lord for an answer? Keep waiting, for those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. Don’t ever stop believing in the truth of God, regardless of what others say. https://t.co/sAgf8qDVIR
You may believe that you are a little better than a monkey, but God says His children are a little lower than an angel.
The moment you walk outside of God’s Word searching for truth you enter the path to deception.
Be willing to be the person that speaks the truth and light of God’s Word in a world of darkness.
It is a tragedy that in our nation there are laws protecting endangered baby animals but no laws protecting babies in their mother’s womb.
Jesus wore a crown of thorns so you could be free and live as royalty. He bore stripes on His back so that you could be free of sickness. He took your shame so that you could walk in honor before the Lord. How can you not gladly pour your heart out to Him? https://t.co/aI7tJl2EjK
If you go to a church that doesn’t preach the Word of God, you go to a Sunday social club, not the house of God.

Isn't the Lord good? Hasn't He done great things for you and in your life? We give Him all our worship and all our praise today!		#sundaymorning #church
Don’t let the world weigh you down, don’t let trials slow you down, and don’t let burdens bring you down.
God didn’t send you here just to survive. He sent you here to be more than a conqueror through Christ.
God has given you the gifts and talents you have to glorify Him.
Because you are a child of God, you are higher than the highest on earth, and greater than the greatest on earth.
God solves your problem while you are in it, so if you want a problem solved, get in the middle of it!
Our faith is not built on explanations. Our faith is built on promises. https://t.co/XgIMNkmyzE
God may not always deliver you from your trials, but He will always deliver you from your fear.
Courage is the strength to do what you should do, in spite of what you are facing.
Denial is not a problem solving technique. It just makes the problem worse.
It takes just as much courage to admit that you have a problem as solving the problem.
“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” Colossians 3:23 https://t.co/L6AXt0LXRU
God wants you to be a problem-solver, not part of the problem.
It is only through the grace of God that we can do anything He asks us to do.
God knows and sees the potential that is inside you. Use it!
When you recognize that you can’t live without Jesus, you will know what it means to lack nothing.
Don’t hide; shine. Don’t quit; endure. Don’t be fearful; be faithful, because the God who loves you has conquered the world. https://t.co/vFmXgZIv5M
You have to face struggle and trials in order to become perfect, complete, and lacking in nothing.
You can either argue about why you’re in a trial or you can thank God that the trial is there to strengthen you.
God will never give you more trouble than what you can handle.
It is in the furnace of struggle where your spiritual strength is increased.
“Look to the Lord and His strength; seek Him always.” 1 Chronicles 16:11 https://t.co/BCAQPSFZDL
All you have to do is ask for the favor of God and it will be bestowed upon you, because He has promised that.

It’s time that the church in this nation starts putting forth the effort to be the kind of church the Lord wants us to be.
Too often we despair over what we don’t have instead of considering all that God has done for us.
People don’t come to church for entertainment. They come to church because they feel the presence of God.

When you pursue the plans that God has for your life, then you will receive your reward.

We do not work in this world for our glory and gain, but for the Lord’s.
The Bible is a book of self-examination. If you are not willing to confront what’s wrong with you, the Bible won’t ever work for you.
God loved us even when we weren’t worth saving.
Worship is not about you, your preference, or your comfort. It is solely concerned with God Almighty.
You will be disappointed when you put your hope in men, but you will never be disappointed by God.

The church today has made grace and faith complicated, but the reality is faith is simply believing in God.
“ I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Galatians 5:16
The solution to conquering all your fears is to seek the Lord, because He will deliver you.
Don’t concern yourself with what other people have and what you don’t have. Instead, devote yourself to God, and work with what He has given you.

The voice of God is always speaking. The question is; are you listening?
Worship is nothing more than the truth of God's Word set to music.
Nothing in this world should demand your excitement and focus more than Jesus Christ.
Worship has only one focus, and that is Jesus Christ.
You never have to wait to ask God for something. His door is always open.
God has not sent His word to condemn us, but to cleanse us.

If you can take a stand for God, He will take you forward to His provision.
Too often, people are turning their blessings into complaints. Don't whine about them, but glorify God for them.
Righteousness does not come from our culture. It comes from Jesus Christ.
Whenever you receive a Word from the Lord, know that it will never return void. https://t.co/PoAkWm6mbR
Righteousness is not difficult to attain. All you must do is place your trust in Christ, and you will receive His righteousness.
As soon as you cry out in need to God in your trial, His truth will come and set you free.
Jesus is the one who conquers every need and mends every broken heart.
There is only one who can break the chains of addiction, and His name is Jesus Christ.
Don't just be curious about who Christ is. Be convinced that He is the Son of God.
Submit to God, resist the devil, and fight the good fight of faith.
“Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.” John 14:1 https://t.co/m9F9HwuPkp
Demonstrate in your life the triumph that Christ gave to you.
Your commitment to Christ gives you the ability to move mountains of impossibility.
Since we have the spirit of Christ in us, we have the victory and triumph that Christ earned.
The Bible doesn't work because you think it does. It works because it is God-breathed truth.
Nothing has changed since the Bible was completed. It is still wholly true.
Trials are used to strengthen yourself and the brethren in Christ.
While your problem may be bigger than what you can handle, your problem is never bigger than what God can handle. #qotd https://t.co/OnxpcUco3z
It is totally acceptable to use your intuition, your instincts, and the mind God gave you to make decisions. But make sure you submit your carnal mind to the Lord’s spiritual will. https://t.co/i1e9ZZ7TyF
Don't forget that God has, can, and will save you.
Whenever you think Jesus doesn't know about your struggle, remember that He does know, and is praying for you.
God allows the trials in your life to craft you into the person He wants you to be.
Never ever doubt the ability of God to save you from what you are facing.
God will never take the backseat in your life. He is the sole focus.
The only way Satan can steal your joy is if you forfeit it.
Jesus moves your mountains of impossibility and makes a way where there seems to be no way.
There are two types of servants to the Lord; faithful or wicked. Be faithful to God, since He has been faithful to you. https://t.co/BqAO4Tu930
God can exchange your poverty with prosperity.
God doesn't try to win. He's already won.
If you wish to be successful, you need to build your life on the foundation of truth, the Word of God.
You are not in a struggle for success. Christ has already given you the victory.
As soon as you say “Lord I need you,” He will come in and restore everything you have lost.
Your denomination nor your tradition does not make you righteous. The blood of Jesus Christ does.

Whenever the church works together in unity, the world believes in Jesus.
Your identity is not found in what you are, but Whose you are.

Realize that the only opinion that matters in this life is God’s opinion.
Jesus Christ isn’t just the Savior of your soul, but He is also the Lord of your life.
Jesus Christ is not a king or a lord. He is THE King of Kings and THE Lord of Lords.
It is our responsibility to fix what is wrong with America. Not the government, but the people.

Our God is a God of new beginnings, and He will give you a new one if you put your trust in Him.
The good things you receive in this life isn’t a result of luck or fortune, but of God’s unmerited favor.
Because of the promises of Christ, you have everything you will ever need.
"But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." - Hebrews 11:6

Jesus Christ didn’t go to the Cross because we deserved it. He went to the Cross because He loved us.
You may have changed, others may have changed, the world may have changed, but God Almighty will never change.

If all you do is count the ways you can fail, you will never succeed in life.
God’s Word always works.
The problem in our lives is that we do not recognize the power of God’s Word and the emptiness of man’s promises.
Your words are powerful because they can either build up or destroy your faith.
Christ loved you so much that He died for you. Do you love Him enough to live for Him?
God has been working for your good since the day you were born. https://t.co/0CEzXwWKrX
Jesus Christ thought you were so wonderful that He not only saved you, but He set you free.
You don’t need any help defeating Satan, because Christ has already defeated Him.
If you have accepted Jesus, you have everything you will ever need.
You will never receive God’s power as long as you are in argument with Him.
The Word of God is good for nothing unless you act upon it. https://t.co/jJnEJEAtvz
The most powerful thing you can every say is “Yes, Lord.” It may not be comfortable, but it is always good for you.
Even if Jesus touches you only one time, all of your chains and bondages will be destroyed.
Religion makes up rules with God. A relationship with God breaks the rules.

You do not need to go in search of greatness. If you believe in Christ, His greatness is in you. https://t.co/zMi0I9t1oV

The Word of God gives peace in the storm and joy through sorrow.
Our world today suffers from a lack of humility, but God says that the humble are blessed.
If we are to be followers of Christ, we must be content with being called “extreme” by the world.
If you want to know why America is suffering, look at how our society is enamored with ourselves.
It’s not enough to simply know Jesus. You need to constantly be with Him. https://t.co/2r1jZqLDXa
When you are humble, the kingdom of heaven is yours.

Children are not being educated in public schools. They are being indoctrinated.
Our world is not tolerant nor reasonable. It is full of moral insanity.
There is not a single logical reason to deny Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
Righteousness does not come from society. There is no righteousness in society because there is no right or wrong in this society. But, a relationship with Christ is where righteousness comes from.
We’ve become so focused on the details of our life that we forget the big picture: God is in control.
“Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.” Ephesians 6:10 https://t.co/ND7liO6Fhv

There is a name that can break the chains of addiction, and that name is Jesus. There is a name that breaks the yoke of poverty, heals sickness and disease, and that name is Jesus. His name is above every other name and filled with majesty and power.
God wants us to be filled with power, not fear and anxiety.
“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.” James 1:17 https://t.co/lnKalN35WA
Don’t just categorize Jesus as a part of your life. Make Him your life.
When somebody asks you about Jesus, you should make that experience unforgettable, not boring.
When Christ comes into your life, there is no mistaking it. He washes you white as snow and blesses you beyond comprehension.
You are not just one of God’s sitting ducks, waiting for the enemy to attack you. You are here to establish His kingdom on this earth, not to defend yourself from the schemes of the devil. You’re here to gain ground from the Cross of Christ.
Until your goal of worshipping the Lord is giving Him the glory He deserves, your worship is shallow and self-serving.
The main attraction of holidays such as Easter, Christmas, and Thanksgiving should be to remember what God has done for us.

Realize that in your life, you shouldn’t be following your own plan, but God’s plan for your life.
The way God measures success is by evaluating you on what you are willing to do for Him.
When you walk in faith, you progress. When you walk in the flesh, all you do is set yourself up for failure.
When you walk in the will and plan of God, the only result is success.
Press on! Your healing is about to arrive, your answer is on the way, your breakthrough is coming. Do not lie down and accept defeat, but endure. https://t.co/396ZjoM5b5
There is a lesson in every trial you face. Don’t ignore it.

Child of God, the most life changing thing you will ever do is tell the Lord God Almighty “be it unto me according to Your Word. Whatever you have planned for me, do it. However you want to use me, I’m ready.” Recognize that He is in control, and submit to His perfect will. https://t.co/AYSjN9kwpa
Count your blessings, not your burdens.
No matter how many times your circumstances change, the Word of God will always be true.
Believe that all things are possible and let God do something great in your life.
The key to getting God to do big things in your live is to believe that He can do those things.
“When I thought, ‘My foot slips,’ Your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up. When the cares of my heart are many, Your consolations cheer my soul.” Psalms 94:18-19 https://t.co/z69NVrYNqt
You are not entitled to God’s presence, but He has made a way for us to be near to Him.
Christ’s sacrifice is the sacrifice that granted you eternal freedom.
If we do not use our freedom to preserve our freedom, we will lose our freedom.
You are a part of the church triumphant. Don’t let anyone steal your victory.
If you’ll trust in Him, He’ll direct your steps. If you’ll honor Him, He’ll cause you to increase. He said He’d provide your every need according to His riches in glory. Therefore, do not be afraid, for the Lord thy God is with you. https://t.co/n4V6oEsKOf
Praise is the weapon God has given us to fight and endure the schemes of the enemy.
In a constantly changing world, hold fast to the fact that God does not change.
Endure! Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.
Choose not to quit, and endure for the victory is yours in Christ.
God’s delays are not God’s denials. He is faithful to the ends of the earth.
Don’t ever give up on God. He will perform His promise.
We want a 100% dependable God but still maintain our independence. It doesn’t work that way.
When you’re too busy to get to God’s house, you have too much going on.
In order to be more than a conqueror through Christ, you need to clothe yourself in His truth.
The Word of God gives us everything we need for conflict, but also for victory.
Walls of division and hatred are broken in Christ Jesus.
If we stand united in Christ, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us.
Satan uses division to accomplish his work. Be united, and be strong against the enemy’s schemes.

There was only one perfect person: Jesus. Live with faith, and you will please God.
If you don’t have faith, you will never receive God's promises.

The only way to drive the enemy out of your life is to read, speak, and stand upon the Word of God.
God wants to be of service to you. Let Him! #god
God knows exactly what you need. Trust that He is able to provide for you.
God still heals, even though the world says He does not. #truth
Even when doctors don’t know what to do, God does. He is the Great Physician.
You cannot be ignorant of the Word and have its power in your life.
We live in a world obsessed with treating the symptoms of sin, and not the root cause.
The Word of God is the secret to solving all the world’s problems.
You must USE the Word of God for its power to be released. #bible #word
God cannot bless you in your known disobedience. #obey #blessed
The Cross of Christ erases your past and destroys fear. #fear

If we are to return to having a strong church in this nation, we must be committed to teaching the Word.
When it comes to God’s Word, you don’t get to have it your way, but His way.
A church should not only be committed to the Word, but be committed to the believers as well.
Our God is a mountain moving God. Elevate Him, and He will change the world!
Whenever the church works together in unity, the world believes in Jesus.
In a world without hope, we who have been given hope should be a light in this dark world.
The world preaches tolerance, but the truth is they are tolerant of everyone except believers in Christ.
God’s Word is true for every person, everywhere, all the time.
The church has become more insistent on government endorsing our faith than living out our faith.
We don’t need the approval of the Oval Office when we have the approval of the King of kings.

Fight your battles FROM victory - not FOR victory. The victory is yours through Christ the Lord!

You may see something in your life that is impossible, but that is an opportunity for God to show you His power.

This world is fickle. It changes and evolves. Thank heaven we serve a God that doesn’t change.
You can always put your trust in God and be confident that it will never fail.
We do not triumph on earth by force, but by the Cross of Christ.
Refuse to have your light put out by the negativity of others.
We must be the generation that goes to work if we are to keep our liberty.
With freedom comes the opportunity to fight the good fight of faith for Christ.
Crucify your desires, push away your selfish desires, and follow Jesus. He will provide for your needs.
With freedom in Christ, you have the responsibility to follow what is in the Word.
Freedom and liberty in Christ comes with the responsibility of acting like a child of God.
The power of God destroys every evil work of the enemy.
Our only hope for survival in this nation is to turn away from the selfish attitude that dominates our culture.
“Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:1
Apart from the grace of God, you can do nothing.
God is on the throne, He’s in control, and everything is going to be alright.
Your yesterdays are the training ground for your successful future.
God has got a perfect plan for your life.
Recognize that God has favored you, and that He is in control.
Refuse to let fear steal your joy.
God's lovingkindness is better than life itself.
Fear will keep you from enjoying the favor of God in your life.
You cannot worry about what happens to you. You do not control it. You can control how you respond.
Since God is in control, we have nothing to fear.
Our God was, is, and always will be in control.

When your life is so full of you that the Lord can’t fit in, you can’t receive what He wants to deliver.
If you have no appetite for the Word, then you do not crave it as you should. #bible
Until you hunger and thirst for God, you will not receive the purpose and power of the Holy Spirit.
Let us magnify the Lord for the great things He has done today!
When it comes to receiving the Holy Spirit, you have to open your mouth and praise God to receive Him.
We are praying for you, Las Vegas. #prayer #lasvegas https://t.co/YZ8RLE0MX2
I don’t know the size of your problem, but God Almighty does and He is bigger than any problem you face.

There is a discipline to being a disciple of Jesus Christ.
When you know it’s wrong and refuse to do what is right, you have chosen your will over God's will.
Discipline is what powers you to do the right thing even when everyone else is telling you to do the opposite.
You don’t have to beg for the Holy Spirit, just repent.
There is nothing more legitimate, American or Godly that a faithful family.

Only when you are thankful for “today” you will receive God right where you’re at.
God knows more about your problem than you do. Whining to Him will not help your case.
Far too many people wait for things to be right before they are thankful.
Don’t whine, because whining never solves the problem.
Thankfulness is what opens the windows of heaven and pours out God’s blessing upon you.
Always consider what God has done, and be thankful unto Him.
When you’ve had a good year, give thanks. When it’s been a long year, give thanks. In all things, give thanks.
Let us never forget how good God has been to us. #grateful
We have always been, and always will be, one nation under God.
Our God is greater than ALL the leaders of this world.
Today, we need to not forget the goodness of God and to be thankful to Him.
Because He has provided our every need, we should be thankful unto Him and bless HIs name.
God has given you His Word so that the darkness of sin in your life will fade away.

Remember, God didn’t give your children to the school or the state; He gave them to you.
God holds you accountable for how your children are raised, not the school, the state, or the government.
The foundations of the educational system aren’t being destroyed; they have been demolished.
There is no God like our God! He is awesome in all things. Give Him praise today!
It’s time we stop asking God to make us comfortable, and start asking Him to make us courageous.

Stop asking God to take you out of the fight and ask Him to make you more than a conqueror through Christ.
In God’s will is where you want to be.
Doubt nothing, fear nothing, and let God arise in you until this world is shaken for His glory.
One of the greatest tragedies in our world is that we have forgotten the great gift the Bible is in our lives.
Even if we become enemies of the state, our God has promised us that we are still more than conquerors in Christ.
Love your spouse right where they are, just like how Jesus loves you.
Our God is the God that can go into your past and erase the pain.
Rather than worry about tomorrow, be thankful that He has given you another “today.”
We like to magnify our issues and in doing so we rob ourselves of thankfulness.
“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Galatians 5:16
Thankfulness is not just an attitude, but a command.
God does great things with small beginnings.
God makes a solution before you even think about a problem.
When you weren’t worth loving, Jesus loved you enough to die for you.
God judges those who complain.
“Love one another as I have loved you” is a command, not a recommendation.
I don’t care what the government says. God says marriage is between one man and one woman.
“I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in His word I hope.” Psalms 130:5
