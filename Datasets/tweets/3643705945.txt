@philly_carl @CBSNews When a party no longer represents their voters, the voters turn to others
@philly_carl @CBSNews It doesn’t take any form of intellect to understand that. No wonder the Democratic party is frightened. It’s because they know they’re becoming way too radical and an independent candidate who is more center appealing to the Democrats who haven’t lost their mind yet is attractive
@philly_carl @CBSNews He’s just an example of what’s going to happen when both parties start straying from the wants of the people. Especially the Democrats. Someone is going to come in, fill the void, and take those votes.
