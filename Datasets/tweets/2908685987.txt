@CityofJax check these programs track record if the city has had no success with that program why give them more...5 years is more then enough time to change a life or to... all i asked for was a safe place to hold my program for my kids not funds not food just a safe place...
@CityofJax it starts with one child one family...make year around food centers not just summer and stop paying programs to do feeding when the city is paying for the food already  it shouldn't cost to give away food. why do programs get $4,500 to feed kids food the city provides
@CityofJax get more of these children mental health care GED program for parents and children make after school programs that actually works not just sports and dance actual tutoring programs make after hour shelters for teens only.  Make weapon free zones for everyone
@CityofJax most would say I am upset but i am not I just find it funny how I begged to help and they never even looked my way...for free...i had college students ready to help, food set up, clothing after school care, educational  advancements and still to this day nothing

@CityofJax you all say make a change but when we do you all say no because your background no your not dressed up enough no you dont talk like us but you will give it to leaders who can't even articulate their thoughts and goal clearly or speak on the issues..
@CityofJax I have seen like 10 buildingd that you chose not to use but will not donate them to people who are willing to make something out of nothing but u choose not to because of money...somany free programs could be started but you all want to waist money

Breakfast club....tmz......cnn....Control pay attention
Underground rappers are rappers who chose to say no....
Lauren hill...truth.....Pay attention people soon it will all affect us too
Stop allowing them to sending your children messages through moves did you all catch lion king pay attention...
Pay attention...boycott Hollywood,the music industry  stop voting for stupidity stop allowing them to control your thoughts...
Obama helped push this to its limit....
Pay attention they want you love these stars they want you to think rappers are hard core they want to see your kids to disney world
Us daily but we so busy trying not fail we let these things pass fame is kill our babies being the best has changed the hearts of our people
Pay attention (y)M.A that was not her original look they asked her to be harder come harder look at her from old to now they are training
Kevin gates was too much for them to control so they let him jail himself they knew he would bring himself down one kick one call 180 done..
They are going to do what they told they holding you because your still not inline with whats asked of you...
Mos def you went to Africa to get way, he sold out but tried to back out and they locked down where you were...they sold us u dont think
It broke him he is constantly doing what they ask but they still treat him like second hand to jay z ...
Kanye couldnt take that how much comfort do you need after being robbed and you lived ...she had to give herself away to pay for their life
Kim was not robbed she had to pay up count how many years she has been on top ... What truly happen to her will never go on paper..
through verbal hypnosis...do you know what a one hit wonder really is a person who did not agree to Hollywood terms..illuminati...
Pay attention to the shift in the music industry,New world order...kanye,mos def,dave chapple,martin, j cole doing his job making you
Its all real...pay attention people soon it will all affect us....they have trained us to ignore evil through movies,music,politics
On this journey I pray that you all be educated on the price of fame how the government is so full of shit....pizzagate, illuminati,cloning

No job start a business	No education educate yourself	Invest...start with you...

New year's resolution	Education	Invest	Respect.....the key to the future 2017 I challenge everyone to try it...
Educate invest respect.......lets move
Pushing for greatness starts when we understand  is it not about color anymore its about survival of the educated respected invested
If you have a job work that job but start a business, start investing in you....go to college your never to old build a life u can control
In the morning wake up if you don't have your high diploma find a class . Then find something you enjoy doing and start a business....
In the morning wake up if you have a job find something u like to do on the side start a small businessy
Just live and let them play the game....if u have your own you will never have to vote for bullshit....education,respect,invest
Our concern is not trump its us....black white orange we gotta keep pushing ...educate yourself respect yourself and others know your worth
Ask them to read to you, I bet they stumble they don't know the sounds...they don't teach anymore....
If you are in Florida ask your child to write in cursive....I'll wait they don't teach that anymore but the do at private schools
Let's start taking our children out of the public schools and give these private schools our dedication.....
