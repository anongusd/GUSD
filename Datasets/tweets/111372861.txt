@ramak244 In order to successfully touch up any paint it's imperative to use the exact same paint used originally. Any deviation can potentially effect how the color will blend in. Painting the entire wall may be the best option if use of the original paint is not an option.
@ramak244 Thank you for contacting Sherwin Williams. We appreciate your inquiry. Our quart size Color To Go samples are only offered in satin. The original paint used (Pro Kote) is no longer available.
@justlikekand1 We appreciate your inquiry. I am sorry to say we don't offer flat samples. Our Color To Go samples are only manufactured in a Satin sheen. You can always get a dime sized sample from an inconspicuous area on the wall and our stores can custom match that color in a flat paint.

@dejabuss This information is readily available under Product Specifications and PDS for each product if you need to access it in the future. https://t.co/ZmzG6XfLDS Thanks!
@dejabuss Hi! The recoat time is 4 hours in temperatures above 45 degrees &amp; 24-48 hours at temperatures below 45 degrees. The lowest temperature the product can be applied is 35 degrees &amp; the temperature needs to remain at 35 or above for the first 24-48 hours to ensure proper curing.
@shmeyer917 While going with the Super Paint flat tinted to the same color may be the best option, we can't guarantee a successful touch up. The only way to ensure a flawless touch up without seeing any noticeable differences is to use the exact same paint and batch that was used initially.
@shmeyer917 Hi there. The product number desired is no longer available, but (Super Paint Interior Flat) is still available with a different product number. Often products are reformulated to improve the performance standards, when this happens the part numbers often reflect those changes.
@BostonMage Hi! While the Extreme Bond Primer can be applied to wood, we do offer other products such as our Multi-Purpose Oil based primer or the Premium Wall &amp; Wood that would be ideal for the bare crown molding. Once the primer is applied you can then topcoat with a semi-gloss. Thanks!

@CharlesRBlack The store will be able to duplicate the color on the sample. Please keep in mind when touching up it's critical to use the exact same color, sheen and quality of paint as this will limit the chance of seeing the paint being touched up and lack of blending. Happy Painting!
@CharlesRBlack If you don't have the actual paint or formula then it's best to have the color custom matched. You can take to your neighborhood Sherwin Williams store a small sample piece(no smaller than a dime size) of the existing wall from an inconspicuous area and have it custom matched.

Thanks to everyone who participated in our #SWPaintingWeek curb appeal color chat! Good times, great questions. Signing off! / JG
@NYDesignGuy We couldn‚Äôt agree more! Color is all about personal preference. We say go with what speaks to you.
I can't pick just one, @RMD_Designs! Colors from the Historic Collection have a great balance. http://t.co/9dKUsQVu6Z /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@KameronhallHall Pay attention to the colors of nature around the home. Stone, bark, elements from the area. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@The_ArtofSpace I'm a Turkish Delight! My favorite #SherwinWilliams color is Porpoise (SW 7047). /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@RAHomes I think khakis are on their way up. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@RMD_Designs That's one hot fuschia! I'd say go for a softer pink like Socialite (SW 6025) for walls. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@lucky_bex I think khaki is coming back. Grays aren't going away, but I've got room for khaki in my heart. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
Stain the deck 100%, @IxnayOnTheMK. I prefer a semi-transparent stain that allows the wood grain to show through. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@lucky_bex Hey, thanks! Hope you're enjoying the chat! /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@SHURLINE Only paint 1 wall at a time to ensure even, solid color. That way you keep track of what's dry &amp; what's not! /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@RAHomes I owe it to the popularity of recycled surface accents. People are appreciating all the tones that gray offers. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
@TheBoldAbode Shoji White (SW 7042) is beautiful. Honestly, I love every color on that strip! /JG #SWPaintingWeek
Gray might lack on walls, but is great on cabinets, @lucky_bex. Keeping the green? Complement it w/ a cooler gray. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
Thanks, @caversonly1. A warm neutral w/ green tones to keep the integrity of the shade &amp; still match the furnishings. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
RT @MyFixitUpLife: Deep brownish purple is a fun surprise drama neutral. Works with color effortlessly @The_ArtofSpace #SWPaintingWeek  htt‚Ä¶
I say compromise &amp; let them pick one color, @BeazerHomes. Show them color charts &amp; lead them to a thoughtful choice. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
It's so regional, @RAHomes. I tend to pick colors based on the fabric and style of the community./JG #SWPaintingWeek
Great question, @handypaint. I'm really into darker tones this year with a heavy dose of gray in them, especially navy. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
If you're drawn to purples &amp; blues, you should check out Enigma (SW 6018). It's a perfect violet, @DesignItVintage. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
It really doesn't matter! I've done both, @brawlinbaby. It always looks great no matter the architecture. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
Smaller homes take dark colors better, @tammera111. I say follow your heart, as long as your home isn't too large. /JG #SWPaintingWeek
