There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death. (The death rate is still one per person)
Each heart knows its own bitterness,and no one else can fully share its joy. (Only God can see into the hearts of man)

@Vicious_Beauty Couldnt agree more. Fillers suck. #anime #Bleach
@redigits At first its really really similar,but it gets way cool. Jus gotta be patient.
Night twitterverse..see you again. Had fun chatting w other fans of #anime and #Bleach.One of the best things in this world is anime!
@Vicious_Beauty His Hollow and Zampakatou were one being originally.Still some surprises to be had. #anime #Bleach
@redigits Ya.They are to the Cell Games Sage already.Its great.All new looking, and no,repeat..NO FILLER. #anime I rec checkin it out.
@Foshiizzel That would be sweet for sure. But after Ichigo/Aizen battle, how do they top that?  #anime #Bleach

@redigits Who wouldnt,she is hot. He gave it all up to beat Aizen.Musta been so very hard to bury all those emotions. #Bleach #anime
@redigits My friends and I called this one.We thought he was good.We never actually "saw" him do anythin really.  #Bleach #anime
@redigits He did that to say "f" you.A payback when Aizen stopped his sword back long ago. #Bleach #anime
@Vicious_Beauty Aizen is crazy.He still thinks this is a fluke.Ichigo hasnt even went Hallow yet..if he still can.  #Bleach #anime
@Foshiizzel I actually didnt expect Ichigo to be so powerful.How long was he in the inter-dimensional space? I wonder if he is gonna Hallow
