I am encouraged by the enthusiasm for nuclear energy here in Canada and the progress of projects here in Ontario. ... This province shows us a glimpse of the reliable, low-carbon electric grid of the future, Korsnick concludes at #CNA2018. 5/5
In the future, nuclear plants could play different roles than just produce electricity -- they could produce industrial heat, desalinate water or  power remote communities, Korsnick tells #CNA2018 . 4/
For the past 15 years, our average capacity factor across the fleet has been above 90 percent. That is equivalent to producing one-third more power from our plants. #CNA2018 3/
We are optimistic that this Congress will act on legislation to move forward both the Yucca Mountain repository and interim storage of used fuel, Korsnick tells #CNA2018. 2/
