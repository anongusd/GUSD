A lie is still a lie, regardless of the reason behind it. You can say you did it for a good cause but the point is, u still did it.
Every exit is an entrance somewhere else.......i now believe
A boy becomes valuable when a girl drops a tear for him. A girl becomes priceless when a boy drops a tear for her.

The reason y people give up so easily is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have come.
I HAVE TO LEARN THE RULES OF THE GAME AND THEN I WILL PLAY BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE...either i will find a way or i'll make one
The hard times u go through build character, making u a much stronger person......we ghetto boys have character!
If u r lucky enough to get a second chance at something, don't waste it.
I hate people who are constantly nasty to people because they are popular.
@njulius111 true that
@nabimanyaviola i get your point and besides, that's what my intuition has always told me
I believe that everything happens for a reason, even when we ain't wise enough 2 c it so don't give up even though u are at your worst....
I don't give a damn what they say &amp; think.............
Never let the competition define u. Instead, u've 2 define yourself based on a point of view u care deeply about.
Thank GOD i'm nolonger a first year		#i will always praise him
mirror on the wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The young man knows the rules but the old man knows yhe exceptions
FACT: People only wanna see u doing well but not doing better than them.
yo game will attract a certain type, yo looks will attract a certain type but only the real u will attract the real type....a real wo/man
People who hate u are just yo confused admirers who can't figure out the reason y every1 loves u....
Never apologise for your feelings, because when u do, u r apologising for the truth.
I don't regret my past. I just regret the time i wasted with the wrong people...	#BABNAYIAH
To those who judge me on who i talk to, the people i like, the things i waste my time on , my opinions, my appearance, my mistakes. F**k U
Who i was last year,&amp; who iam this year are 2 totally different personalities. Stop getting confused.
Life's too short 2 stress yoself with people who don't even deserve to be an issue in your life......
Good, better, best....never rest until yo good is better &amp; yo better is the best...
To be old &amp; wise, u must first be young &amp; stupid. There are no mistakes in life, just lessons.
This is the magic behind; I work hard &amp; smart &amp; play hard &amp; smart. I reward myself 4 even little achievements.
Self-praise is for losers. Be a winner. Stand for something. Always have class &amp; be humble.
mum....everything is hunky-dory
@aflacaasl_hd hahahaha
There are 2 types of people who r failures in life. Those who don't listen to ANYBODY and those who listen to EVERYBODY
@97fmradiocity @davedash20 @srlmyr play 4 me i should have kissed u by chris brown
HATERS are the people who will broadcast yo failures &amp; whisper your success.
U'll meet 2 kinds of people in life; those that build u up and those that tear u apart but in the end u will thank them all.
Getting back with yo ex is pretty much the same as taking a shower &amp; putting back on your dirty under wear.
Being friends with yo ex shows that u 2 are mature enough to get over the fact that u 2 weren't meant 2 b 2gether.
Oh my GOD!!!!!!!!! http://t.co/hcil4NhB
Be less curious about people and be more curious about ideas.
Success is a sum of small efforts repeated day in day out.
Yo life is anovel, every day is a page, and u have the power to make the story go the way u want it to go.
Iam who iam. I like what i like. I love what i love. I do what i want. Get off my back &amp; deal with it. It's my life not yours.
Don't judge me for my choices when u don't understand my reasons.
When u stop trying to find the right woman &amp;         start becoming the right man, the right woman will find her way to u.
@iKeepItTooReal  that's true...thanx
The only thing standing between u and yo' goal is the bullshit story u keep telling yo' self as to Y u can't achieve it!!!
If u don,t love what u do, u won,t do it with much conviction or passion.
Smart girls open their minds. Easy girls open their legs & foolish ones open their hearts.
RT @BIBLE_Psalms: Why do nations conspire and people plot in vain? - Psalm 2:1 (please retweet)
Sometimes it is not enough to do our best;we must do what is required.
I shd have kissed u, i shd have told u 	Told u just how i feel 	And next time i won't stop, i'll listen to my heart	Cos what i feel is real
Now I am on waplog! http://t.co/qQ4vOZ1Q
Every1 wants what they can't have. If u begin to love what u have, u won't need anything else...
@BrunoIMars y do u like telling naked lies? How many are u following now?
People like to bring your past when your present & future look better than theirs.
Don't lose yourself in the process of loving someone too much, forgetting that u are special too.
