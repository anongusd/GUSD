Approx time VP Pence tells us Trump doesn't want to deal w DACA as part of this deal: 1:30p. Approx time Trump says in TX he's open to "broader" deal that could include DACA: 4p. Elapsed time before POTUS undercuts VPOTUS: 2.5hrs (In between, the wall/DACA deal dies- any wonder?)
On declaring a national emergency, Pence said Trump "believes he has an absolute right" to do it, but hasn't decided yet. "The president is going to get this done one way or another."
Pence pretty handily shot down the Graham effort at a deal that would pair wall $ with legal status for DACA, TPS recipients, saying POTUS has been clear he wants to wait until Supreme Court sustains his decision to end DACA to address that &amp; other issues
“No wall, no deal,” Pence says in briefing at the Capitol. Repeatedly thanks congressional Rs for “standing strong” &amp; says Democrats are stonewalling in negotiations.

Trump called Christine Blasey Ford testimony "compelling" &amp; said she was a "very credible" witness, but also that he hadn't given a bit of thought to replacing Kavanaugh as SCOTUS nominee
Sen Feinstein sounded confused about what happened in Judiciary, like she had expected Flake to make a formal motion to delay the vote &amp; condition his support for Kavanaugh on it. He could have done that, but did not. Flake move was big, but he gave up some of his leverage.
"Somebody's gotta explain this to Trump, so I guess that'll be my job," Sen Graham says sardonically on his way out of Judiciary Committee after this latest turn.
Key question now is whether more Rs will join Flake in insisting on this 1-wk delay for an FBI investigation before the Kavanaugh floor vote. If not, McConnell could still move Kavanaugh to confirmation early next wk
"This is all a gentlemen's &amp; gentleladies' agreement" Grassley says, making key point re what just happened. After much speculation he would change/withhold his vote to approve Kavanaugh's nom, Flake voted YES...Said he'd seek 1wk delay for FBI probe but no guarantee of that

Orrin Hatch: "Gee whiz."
RT @ToluseO: Kavanaugh: "Yes, we drank beer. I liked beer. I still liked beer. We drank beer.... We drank beer, we liked beer."

@emptywheel I think we do disagree. If a president makes a threat, or says things that suggest he is ready to take actions outside the law, reporters need to determine whether he intends to do so. Can also challenge his premise. But failing to do the 1st is not doing the job.
@emptywheel Maybe, &amp; I wasn't there, so dunno exactly how this was worded, but if a person in power suggests that a certain action be taken, however far-fetched or false the premise, I think it's the obligation of reporters w access to that person to ask whether he's going to act accordingly
@emptywheel So no follow-ups are appropriate when the president of the United States makes an unreasonable claim? Ok, I think I get the rules now.
@emptywheel A kind of reporter who wanted to know the actual answer to an important question Trump raised himself last night when he said in front of thousands of people that publishing the op-ed might have been treason. That's what kind.

Trump is defending Ronny Jackson as a "high-quality person," leader, "great doctor," but also appears to be saying he has told him he should consider withdrawing: "I said what do you need it for? So it's totally his decision."
"I like him a lot," Trump said after embracing (bro-hugging?) French President Emmanuel Macron at their news conference. It was a handshake that turned into a two-handed handclasp &amp; then a hug w a hearty thump on the back
