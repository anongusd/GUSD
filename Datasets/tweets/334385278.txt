Key @KamalaHarris 2020 policy agenda, per campaign aides:	-- $2.8 trillion middle class tax cut ("LIFT Act")	-- ~$76B in tax credits for low-income renters	-- Bill to encourage states to reduce cash bail	-- Elections security	-- Reduce racial disparity in childbirth deaths	-- M4A

8. Anyway, sorry for the over-long thread. Hope you read my story about this w/ two other colleagues for more:		https://t.co/cHTcePSJOK
7. Trump admin says it's trying to minimize pain from shutdown as much as possible. &amp; it has kept food stamps, IRS refunds, &amp; more running - help 4 millions		But as some note, you dont have to believe anything corrupt is going on to wonder: "Whose problems get listened to 1st?"
6. Lester Randall, chair of Kickapoo Tribe,  is very worried about health clinics closing if the shutdown continues, or a snowstorm hitting. He's laid off 23 workers, including the entire roads dept.		‚ÄúWe‚Äôre left in the dark with whatever you can read from the news,‚Äù Randall said https://t.co/p11M2H2ZxZ
5. One group whose calls to DC have gone unreturned: The Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas, (pop. 1,600)		Cut off from federal $, the tribe laid off 2/3rds of the local police force, 2 firefighters, &amp; 5 workers in the court system (including the judge). They also halted ~24 scholarships https://t.co/D0iU1iNZUT
4. Big alcohol has been screwed by the shutdown b/c licensing operations are shutdown		But they have 2 calls scheduled w/ Treasury next week to find a solution		Treasury officials told alcohol producers 2 produce data on how theyre being hurt by the shutdown, including lost tax $
3. Mortgage industry honchos were furious when the shutdown forced the IRS to stop processing key lending documents		The chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association called a senior Mnuchin aide for help		Unpaid IRS workers were ordered back to work; the form is now moving
2. When the shutdown began, Alaska's (all GOP) congressional delegation pushed to help ensure the state's cod &amp; pollack industry wouldn't be hurt		The Trump administration found the money, &amp; fisheries in Alaska opened on time w/ approvals &amp; permits
1. On Monday, the nation's biggest farm lobbyist org. vented in private mtgs to Trump's ag secretary about how the shutdown was hurting them		Two days later, the USDA said 2,500 unpaid workers would be summoned back to work to help farmers process paperwork/loans

@mattyglesias @willwilkinson @hamandcheese Yeah I genuinely dont know I'm just looking to see if anyone has definitively answered the q		My guess is if you gave @SvanteMyrick and @sephmurtagh an extra $50M in federal $, they could at the very least create more incentives leading developers to build more cheap units
@willwilkinson @mattyglesias @hamandcheese It just seems like "use federal $ to build affordable units within cities" may be more politically palpable than "change zoning codes so development of luxury condors surges in quiet neighborhoods"
@mattyglesias @hamandcheese @willwilkinson Maybe a dumb q, but has anyone conclusively shown that the problem couldn't be solved with more federal $ for affordable units? Are we sure expanded federal subsidies for non-profit housing developers wouldn't be enough to bolster low-end supply?

The main revelation here is many pundits still feel they could have gone to a better college or gotten some job/promotion if they hadn't been passed over by someone selected allegedly because of his or her race
As for "she won bc she's POC" takes ..		A) Her strongest support was in whiter Astoria		B) Listen to what she herself is saying: ‚ÄúIt would be a huge mistake to just say that this election happened because X demographics live here. That is to absolutely miss the entire point."
Many pundits are saying @Ocasio2018's campaign was "non-ideological," &amp; instead about donors &amp; her race		Wrong for a lot of reasons, but to zero in on one: Not taking from corporations/lobbyists _is_ ideological. The ideology is that elite $ corrupts politics &amp; must be defeated.

@MattBruenig @newroolz Yeah I figured simply targeting one company was unconstitutional, but if they raised the threshold so it only applied to Amazon would that still provoke a challenge?
@newroolz I wonder if there would be legal problems with either approach, tho maybe @MattBruenig knows better than i do
Maybe a dumb q, but why couldn't Seattle just tax Amazon alone? 		The opposition says the problem with the tax is that it hit hundreds of other businesses.		But $13M of the $48M raised by the tax was expected to be paid just by Amazon. 		So why not just target it?
Will just note that even "single-payer" -- the much less popular slogan -- is still polling at 48 to 32 (+16), despite limited support from leading Dem figures.		Kaiser polling puts Obamacare's favorability at +6		Medicare for All at +29 https://t.co/YcB7kPgqNR
@TopherSpiro @MattBruenig @cascamike Maybe there are exceptions, but I think most single-payer true believers admit mentioning the loss of private insurance will lower its polling #s		They're more likely to say it's necessary anyway for the policy -- bargaining power, long-term scourge of private insurers, etc

@heidigroover hi heidi
Just in: Seattle's city council has now repealed the Amazon-opposed head tax, 7-2, reversing course on a measure to fight homelessness they passed less than a month ago amid intense business group pressure
@manticore_night @matthewstoller
Councilor @cmkshama says Ds shouldve waged campaign with thousands of volunteers this summer to win		"Is there a guarantee we would have won? No, of course there's no guarantee. But there was a chance of winning ... with this capitulation, there is no chance."
Very bizarre moment right now where progressive city council members are saying the tax is (a) the right thing to do; (b) necessary to save the lives of hundreds of homeless people ... and (c) the proposal has to be repealed immediately.		A bit hard to get your head around tbh
Council member Lisa Herbold (D) standing firm on repealing tax, despite supporting it:		-- Cites internal polling showing they will lose ballot referenda	-- "The opposition has unlimited resources"	-- "This is not a winnable battle at this time"	-- "It's completely heartbreaking"
Go to the Washington Post, they said; you'll train under the best editors, they said; you'll learn from the sharpest wits and the finest minds, they said ... https://t.co/3hF1n6qouq
One of the speakers talks about how Seattle had demonstrated to the rest of the country that it can stand up to the richest man of the world, Jeff Bezos		But, now, "Make no mistake this is a backroom deal. This is a corporate sell-out."
To recap, for those tuning in:		Last month: Seattle imposed new tax on 600 biggest businesses		Monday: Amid backlash, Seattle's mayor &amp; 7/9 councilors reversed, said they'd repeal the tax today (Tues.)		Right now: Activists make last-ditch push at City Hall to get them to keep it
"The people who are being disruptive are being disruptive because they are angry."		"The system is not working for them, and disrupting it is the only thing they can do. They are desperate, and they are angry, and they have a right to be." https://t.co/LkjQUvS8aq

7 of 9 council members + D mayor now want to repeal the tax.		But @cmkshama, a socialist council member, does not: ‚ÄúI have a newsflash for council members who capitulated to this in lightning speed: this was never going to be easy in the face of mass corporate misinformation"
