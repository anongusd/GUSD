There are lessons here but defaulting to NOT believing is not it.

Also, if all of your analysis of 2020 is by people who are white and male you are doing it wrong and should reevaluate your entire life.
And if we are being serious the Dem party moving to the left is a response to THE VOTERS and not the other way around.
Feel free to ignore all of the "concern" from CONSERVATIVES about how progressive the Dem party is right now. They want us to change so they don't have to vote for the racist but that's not how it works. We aren't going to conform to what Republicans want the Dem party to be.

@IlhanMN Twitter is a dangerous place when you leave things open to interpretation so I totally understand the criticism from that POV but I honestly don't read that tweet like everyone else.  It's a reminder to be careful on here though....
I think this is the second time that one of @IlhanMN 's tweets is being read as antisemitic when you have to really force that interpretation. 		Why are we trying to push this narrative that the Muslim congresswoman is antisemitic?

The Warren story is interesting because it exposes how many reporters covering race and politics have little knowledge of American history. It‚Äôs a requirement. You can‚Äôt cover things when you‚Äôre ignorant of the historical context.
The media is covering it like there is no distinction &amp; it is frustrating because I can‚Äôt be the only one who read about the great migration in school. 		It‚Äôs a problem for Warren but it‚Äôs also not as big of a problem as let‚Äôs say Trump‚Äôs entire campaign leadership being in jail.
As I‚Äôve said from the beginning, Oklahoma‚Äôs history means Warren growing up hearing about her native ancestry is basically how everyone from Oklahoma grew up. This part of the story is NOT the problem. 		The problem is putting it on forms when you previously said you hadn‚Äôt.
1. Every reporter covering this story needs to read about the great migration. If you haven‚Äôt, U don‚Äôt have enough knowledge of history to properly do this analysis. 	2.

What should be clear after the amazing 6 part docuseries is that R. Kelly is a master manipulator (LIKE MOST ABUSERS!) and can be very charming and before you know it you're trapped in the cycle of abuse. 		If #meToo has taught of anything it's that abusers have two faces. 4/
BUT that doesn't mean him abusing 35 year old women is somehow *their* fault because they should've known better. 		That is STILL victim blaming. Stop it. 		3/
Yes, he like underage girls and abuses them but that doesn't mean the adult women he also abuses are to blame in any way for being abused. 		Of course our laws make it more egregious a crime to abuse a child and for good reason 2/
