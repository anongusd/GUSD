@JackPosobiec feel free to link all the times you've denounced Fox News and Breitbart for doing this very thing lmao
@JackPosobiec "Hey, you can't do that! Only we can do that!" -- literally you
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai I rephrased the comment and gave you the benefit of the doubt (since it's GG who claims this and not you) but sure concede if you wish
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai so you can have vibrant and more effective free speech protections while banning overt Nazism?
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai so you concede that isn't the case? because a lot of your colleagues do and you're hinting at it by calling it "authoritarianism"
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai not sure how that relates to protecting free speech and combating Nazism tho
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai I was born an immigrant in my own country of Germany. I'm pretty aware of the racist citizenship laws and lack of birthright citizenship
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai claiming that protecting Nazis is the arbiter to free speech while Black, Indigenous folks can't even protest w/o being attacked is just sad
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai Still has far better free speech rights on every measure compared to the US. Still targets leftists far less than the US
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai I love when liberals compare Black Bloc to literal Nazis...............
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai didn't your colleague flee to Berlin to protect her work on Snowden leaks? lmao . we have better free speech rights in Germany than the US
@ZaidJilani @nooralsibai so Germany is a fascist state for barring overt Nazism?
@ipeker_buse we're also commanded as Muslims to protect other religious folks and their houses of worship, imagery from persecution and destruction
@shar76 @BarackObama people with NPD feel bad for their actions and seek help. they are distressed by their condition which is a criteria for an actual diagnosis
@shar76 @BarackObama wish liberals would stop advancing ableism and stigmatizing those suffering from NPD, other mental health disorders
@JackPosobiec yeah they suck. yet you'll stand by your rapist president like a Filipino Duterte supporter
@dankmtl yeah, as a Kurd this is sad. the region was heavily Kurdish and Armenian but a lot of us turned on our neighbors during the 1915 genocide
@BltProofDiction @dankmtl lmao she does look really Kurdish now that I think about it tho

@Leesghost @Hunterwun @RichardBSpencer @Leesghost I'm at the Appomattox Court House but you're not here? I thought you were a gentlemen but apparently you're a traitor and a liar
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Sounds like you're 1 to 2% Neanderthal and refuse to acknowledge you also came from Africa a while back and just need some sun, less racism
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Roman historians are also all on Wikipedia since you love "sources"
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer CITATION: literally Roman historians. read any of them lmfao
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer why the Nazis stopped at German Jewish grandparents with regards to German "Aryan" ancestry if you recall...
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer my family was French resistance and Catholics... some were also Jews		hate to break it to you, but all Germans have Jewish ancestry, too
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer the Romans also said that German Huns are less than human. Then Nazis thought the Romans liked them. I love fake invented histories!
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer if Wikipedia doesn't work out for ya... let me know if you need an introductory course to reproductive genetics and I might be able to help
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer mom is Kurdish, dad is white French		sounds like I'm also white
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer also... weren't you just bragging about 300,000 dead white people from the North? sounds anti-white or something
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Yes, but having Black family means you're Black? Having a Black friend doesn't? LOL.
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer maybe if I quote Linkin Park, you'll understand the difference between battles and wars?		"But in the end, it doesn't even matter."
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer weird. let me tell my white French family the information
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer might be a really illuminating source to underscore your detached statement

@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Wanna meet up at the Appomattox court house so I can formally surrender? Too soon?
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Wow. Stellar retort. Checkmate. I am defeated.
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer might explain a lot about North Africa but who knows! Let's check Wikipedia?
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer weird how Black Moorish Arabs / Berbers + white Spaniards = light-skinned Arabs
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer I feel like you were trying to be condescending but it just feels like an accurate statement since you probably sourced Wikipedia in college
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Funny how a lot of the first-hand sources in the Wikipedia article for Moors are literally paintings hahahahahahahahaha
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer I feel sorry for any teacher who had to read your term papers lmfao
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer It really isn't. Try checking the references on Wikipedia that are cited? Those are actual sources. Wikipedia is not.
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer Here you go. I sourced a picture of Moors from the Wikipedia page since that's a source according to you: https://t.co/xAr2lHYeNy
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer "Wikipedia is a source."		You failed every writing class in high school, didn't you?
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer I'm not a Christian either yet this is still relevant since we're talking about paintings reflecting historical accounts?
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer also why a lot of Jews fled to Moorish Spain because Muslims offered refuge from murderous crusaders killing them lmfao
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer you didn't present a source. also, Byzantine scholars were fleeing because of the Christian Crusaders sacking Constantinople
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer BROUGHT TO YOU IN PART BY:		"Jesus is white. Just look at the paintings."
@Leesghost @RichardBSpencer You're right. Did you know Jefferson Davis was actually an Arab? Don't trust paintings!

@RichardBSpencer @ReaganBattalion You're also interpreting a parable literally? Do you believe the flock will literally turn into a mustard seed as Jesus(sa) preached?

@CDU: for integration to work, Germans must step up first. I was born an Auslander in my own home. You never accepted me, yet I'm still here
Strange to see Merkel's govt. appeal to the far-right by emphasizing German culture over the constitution. How'd that work out historically?
There's a pretty obvious reason we say "Mensch" instead of "Volk" in Germany. One is German Yiddish, the other tried to genocide them all
