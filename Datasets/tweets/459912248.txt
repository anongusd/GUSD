@Mysicly @foxandfriends All the democrats trying to stop the president previously voted for building a BORDER barrier. They are the ones being petty. Branch out man. Read other news stories or watch Fox news. Give it a chance and educate yourself if you want to report accurately.
@Mysicly WTF?  Dude, you are delusional. Special counsel's office has issued public statement saying that story isn't true. Also, why would the President tell Cohen to lie about something that isn't a crime? It's not illegal to do business with Russia.
@Mysicly The president can close the BORDER if there is a national emergency and the court's can't do squat about that!
@Mysicly Duh, no!  Congress can't do it on their own plus, thus far,  there has been no crime committed by the President.
@Mysicly No one has been convicted of treason or collusion. Crimes they committed had zero to do with Trump. Their crimes are tax problems, lying to FBI, etc. You need to get your news from another source.
