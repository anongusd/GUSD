RT @GHYD_CT: Thank you everyone who attended the #TrinityForum sponsored by @TrinDems and Greater Hartford Young Democrats! Special thanks…
.@GuySmith4CT brought crayons onstage as a metaphor for education funding, an issue he says he will fight for
‘i have been mayor under 5 presidents and 3 governors’ @MayorGanim tells the crowd, regarding his ability to work with other administrations
‘i don’t see how i can work with someone who wants to dismantle public education’ says @jaharrisct when asked about @BetsyDeVos
two other candidates who were invited and unable to attend bring the crowded field to eight.
the debate begins predictably around the state budget. @MaxReiss asks the candidates if they would spend april’s tax revenues or put the ‘windfall’ into the rainy day fund.
six democrats aiming to hold the state’s highest office have taken the stage in the gubernatorial candidate forum
.@ClareKindall reminds the crowd that she was first hired in the AG’s office by @DickBlumenthal
serving in the legislature prior to being elected AG made @AGJepsen and @SenBlumenthal more effective at their job says @WilliamTongCT
‘banks and insurance companies don’t respond to pleases and thank yous, but to pressure and financial exposure’ -@ChrisMatteiCT
.@WilliamTongCT wants to find out how insurance companies exempted ‘risk of collapse’ from coverage of homes with crumbling foundations.
.@pauldoyle4ct says crumbling foundations are the whole state’s problem, not just the individuals directly impacted
.@ChrisMatteiCT would like to open an investigation into the insurance industry’s exempting of crumbling foundation damage from coverage
“when disaster strikes, we all chip in”- @ClareKindall on crumbling foundations in eastern ct
all AG candidates admittedly agree on a lot of the issues
the attorney general candidates are discussing ways the office can protect our civil liberties and immigrant communities from the trump administration
the attorney general candidates begin speaking. both democratic chairs of the judiciary committee are in the race, as well as an assistant attorney general, and a former us attorney.
we learn that @johnblankley2016 has 4.5 grandchildren. not sure just yet how that works...
the next treasurer can be a part of putting pressure on puerto rican debtholders and improve the island’s economy says @arulampalam
divesting from gun manufacturers finds unanimous support from the democrats running for treasurer
do greenwich candidates have a tough time selling themselves across the state? @johnblankley2016 points out that as an immigrant he isn’t your typical greenwich resident
dunkin donuts park is a ‘huge success story’ in hartford, says @ShawnTWooden who oversaw the development of the @GoYardGoats stadium as council president
disagreement between @arulampalam and @ConnecticutDita as to who the likely GOP nominee for treasurer will be. what do you think?
nbc’s @MaxReiss asks @arulampalam if his youth if a liability in this race. relevant question to our interests...
hartford’s pension system was fully paid into each year while @ShawnTWooden was city council president, he tells the audience
with a backround in engineering, @ConnecticutDita wants to ‘make the math add up’ for ct’s perennially underfunded pensions.
not surprisingly, nearly every candidate at our forum has slammed @realDonaldTrump for a variety of harmful policies
.@arulampalam says the first thing our next treasurer must tackle on day one is our unfunded pension obligations. if we don’t, our entire state budget will become debt payments
giving tax breaks to billionaires to spur economic growth is not only an unproven theory, its a disproven theory says @johnblankley2016
.@ConnecticutDita praises outgoing treasurer Denise Nappier in her opening statement
having the shortest commute to trinity campus, hartford’s @arulampalam says his four kids between two and four years old have inspired him to run for office
‘i’m from greenwich, i talk funny, and i know all about finance’ says @johnblankley2016 in his introduction
.@ShawnTWooden identifies as a graduate of @nyulaw, @trinitycollege , and ‘the school of hard knocks’
moving on to the treasurer’s race now at the @TrinDems and @GHYD_CT forum. four democrats are in the race.
‘i am running on my record,’ says @denisemerrillct, on why she should be reelected. points out she was the first SOTS in the country to say no to @kriskobach1787 voting commission.
‘we have seen some tough times, but we are full of connecticut grit’ -@KarenforSOSCT in her closing statement. ‘i believe that we can do much better.’
fun election fact from @denisemerrillct - we are the only state with just town elections. each other state does county elections.
.@karenforsosct says we need to be sure we include town clerks and registrars in the conversation before we move on that issue
.@denisemerrillct says we need to bring early voting to CT like 38 other states do. if texas can, why can’t we?

However, a grandfathered high capacity magazine ban would not have stopped Adam Lanza and his arsenal or future shooters with arsenals (2/3)

Let CT take a leadership role and tell the world that magazines that hold more than 10 rounds have no civilian purpose and no place in CT
With the eyes of the country and the world on our state let us take a stand
