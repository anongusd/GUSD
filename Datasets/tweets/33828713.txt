Thank you Ashley for weighing in.  I appreciate your dedicated advocacy for school libraries. https://t.co/FoNubF9rjJ
@AshleyCooksey2 @librarycherity @ArkansasEd 3. Use your school level plan under Act 930 as a tool for connecting library books and services to improvement strategies and Title IV block grants under the Arkansas ESSA Plan.
@AshleyCooksey2 @librarycherity @ArkansasEd 2. With new standards, the conversation can shift from “3000 books is the minimum required by ADE” to “our students need and deserve 4000, 5000 books”. We can’t achieve excellence by living at the minimum requirements.
@AshleyCooksey2 @librarycherity @ArkansasEd 1. I am sad that you have had to rely on “the minimum” requirement to advocate for budgetary support.
