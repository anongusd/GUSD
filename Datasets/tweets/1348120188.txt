I will not get into politics That's what got the CG not paid in first place congress is just wrong, but their all wrong.
https://t.co/mX8ZweTZyH
5)everyone should save...the gov should have saved their pay. We should not give advice to situation we don't fully understand. My family will be good others will not. We can't just change facts about the situation to fit our agenda. That's what BOTH sides are doing.
3) some have had to use savings due to hurricanes living in natural disaster areas or ya know typical things that happen to folks starting out and well everyone. 4) They signed an OATH and they will  stick to it, like all military. Everyone should save. And they should be paid
Thanks for the economics lesson. Let me give one now. My main concern1)JR enlisted CG families get paid below poverty line and do not yet have luxury of this savings. 2)Many live in high $ of living areas. Their pay is stretched thin (think resorts and ports where folks vacation) https://t.co/i8f9yomIJi

I realize that something needs to be done at the border. I also realize that CBP are not being paid and they are okay with it maybe they take care of their members better. But as an AD Coast Guard wife and mom of 5 I know CG families are hurting. They work on military pay scale https://t.co/IiRUmGU4Sx
Another fair point is that just because it happens to one set of people does not mean it should happen to another set of people. Pay ✔ s should not be held hostage. Also the Coast Guard is not being paid they are only military branch not protected. They protect our borders. https://t.co/E6fsLTaV1T
