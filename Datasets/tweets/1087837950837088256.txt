@estarLA I bet if you were the only conservative and your parents and brothers were democrats you would not be allowed to live. That‚Äôs how leftist roll. Intolerance
@AnnCoulter Are you stumping for a no border democrat to take the WH in 2020?
@CNN Abortionists dimwits/democrats don‚Äôt really care about babies dying. After all, they will kill a full term baby on a whim in New York
@mashable Ram fan here since Roman Gabrielle.We don‚Äôt need Radcliffe
@CNN @RepMaxineWaters Yeah right. Dimwits want open borders while protecting illegals in sanctuary cities who‚Äôve committed heinous crimes. We know who‚Äôs the threat to Americans

@KTLA Has the phony pope noticed the huge wall surrounding the Vatican yet
@EricTrump @TrumpTurnberry I believe if POTUS used the term SECURITY BARRIER instead of wall, Dems. are thwarted from saying SECURITY BARRIERS are immoral or don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs a branding issue
@CNN Lobbyist money = bribes going straight to politicians pockets.democrats and republicans are equal bribery repositories. There are no honest politicians
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Don‚Äôt call it a wall. Use SECURITY BARRIER. NP can‚Äôt say security barriers don‚Äôt work or are immoral.
@RepSwalwell Oh yeah. Let's forget about all the armed guards like the secret service,  police. The average murdered US citizen dont enjoy such protection
