The take away from tonight's CNN Debate was simple.  If you attack Mitt Romney, he's probably going to make you look stupid.
This question was basically an invitation for everyone on the stage to try their best to rattle Romney.  Let's see if anyone can do it.
Did Rick Santorum just subtly call voters stupid?
I wonder how many people at the #OccupyWallStreet protests are watching the CNNDebate on their iPad2's with data plan....
New rule - if you speak out of turn in the debate you have to wear a funny hat.
Are the candidates really afraid to stand behind the 14th Amendment?
I am now 64% sure that this debate is going to end with Rick Perry punching Mitt Romney in the face
If you can't play nice, I swear I will turn this debate around right now!
I honestly forgot what question Rick Perry was answering.
