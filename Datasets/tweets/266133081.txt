Nevada has one of the highest rates of veteran suicide in the country. That is why I'm urging my colleagues to support my legislation that will help provide supportive mental health services to our military heroes fighting invisible injuries. #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek

Pleased to see the Chinese-American World War II Veteran Congressional Gold Medal Act, a bill I cosponsored, pass the Senate. It's important to honor the dedication of Chinese-Americans veterans who sacrificed for our nation at a time when their service went unrecognized by many.

Once again, I was able to stop funding for #YuccaMountain in the conference agreement the Senate just passed. The agreement also included	funds for 4 #NV military construction projects &amp; my provisions to support our veterans &amp; strengthen water security: https://t.co/sEHqAHP38i
That’s why I’m pressing VA Secretary Wilkie to reconsider his position &amp; support legislation I’m pushing to extend disability benefits to our Blue Water veterans for medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. Learn more: https://t.co/iepoijLOCF
The cost of providing the care and benefits we owe to our veterans for their service &amp; sacrifices should not be part of any reasoning to reject legislation that extends disability benefits to our Blue Water Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
Read @RoyBlunt and my piece in @thehill to learn why we're leading the charge in Congress to renew #BrandUSA, a program that encourages travelers from around the world to visit the U.S.: https://t.co/KuH1GZypvW
As a Northern Nevadan myself, I realize how important Truckee Meadows Flood Control Project is for our community, which is why I worked to secure the $181 million in funding it was promised in the reconciled water infrastructure legislation. Read more: https://t.co/V2IXdWpkw5

My office greeted #NV veterans returning home from the #HonorFlight trip to Washington D.C. where they had the chance to visit the national memorials that commemorate the war, or wars, they served in. Thank you to all of Nevada's  veterans for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/yntn6DuGFS
Once again, the U.S. House of Representatives has failed in its relentless pursuit to turn #NV into our nation’s nuclear waste dump. Read about my work to keep funding to revive #YuccaMountain out of the reconciled appropriations bill released today: https://t.co/zGY2NtErRW
I cosponsored the #STARAct to accelerate pediatric cancer research &amp; provide resources to young patients. It's a positive step toward supporting survivors &amp; helping our nation’s top disease fighters develop treatments to save young lives. Learn more here: https://t.co/M6KnS9QnQy

Proud to welcome @VP back to #Nevada today to meet with service members at @NellisAFB.
Always good to catch up w/@jgillanNews3LV. We talked about the message I sent to DOE yesterday: storing weapons-grade plutonium outside of #LasVegas could threaten the health &amp; safety of Nevadans &amp; have a devastating impact on our economy. More here: https://t.co/PD806q7RsJ https://t.co/L3LU5KaI4b
I welcome the announcement from @SecretarySonny that he has declared #HumboldtCounty a disaster area due to wildfires in the region. This opens up additional resources for #NV ranchers and farmers who have lost so much to these blazes.
Thank you to the students with the Close Up Foundation in #LasVegas for asking thoughtful questions during our visit yesterday. Always great to see young people engaged and interested in the legislative process. https://t.co/iJbDpbCoRr
Great to see Rosemary Vassiliadis, the Director of Aviation @LASairport, to discuss the airport's continual growth &amp; how we can work together to promote more domestic and international tourism to NV and support the tens of millions of visitors who travel to #LasVegas each year. https://t.co/1jrmlLHYe2
That’s why I’m strongly opposed to this proposal and am pressing DOE to conduct a full environmental impact analysis before moving forward with any further action. Read more here: https://t.co/X84rnvdR2k
Not only does shipping up to one metric ton of plutonium across the country likely present risks to those living along the proposed transportation routes, storing this material just a few miles from #LasVegas could threaten the health &amp; safety of Nevadans &amp; our tourism economy.
DOE should not move forward with its proposal to store weapons-grade plutonium in #Nevada before fully evaluating the health, safety, and environmental impact that it would have on our state.
Thank you to Larissa and Kristen who traveled from #Nevada with the American Organization of #Nurse Executives to speak with me about nursing workforce development programs &amp; patient access to care. I appreciate your work on behalf of the well-being of Nevadans! https://t.co/Xj48TeCMBV

Thanks to everyone in #Washoe for participating in tonight's telephone town hall meeting.
I was encouraged to see my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives speak in support of our bill, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act Reauthorization, this evening. I will continue working on both sides of the aisle to move #FVPSA through Congress.
Proud to report that the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Know the Lowest Price Act, a bipartisan bill that I co-sponsored to help save Nevadans money by banning a practice that has led to too many patients overpaying for their medications. More here: https://t.co/dJ5fPMFfPO

My legislation offers an effective partnership between veterans &amp; STEM career opportunities in #Nevada, &amp; as a senior member of @VAChair, I look forward to working w/ my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to send it to the President's desk. Read more: https://t.co/XOYCmbXA0q
With the influx of drones, autonomous &amp; electric vehicles &amp; other tech companies in #NV, there is a high demand for STEM specific job requirements. That’s why I was proud to see my legislation – the Supporting Veterans in #STEM Careers Act - pass out of @SenateCommerce today.

This year, DHS acted on my request to change the formula used to determine the UASI grant money that #LasVegas receives. The result? Las Vegas was awarded an additional $2.13 million in UASI funding compared to last year. https://t.co/68M4yJNsVa
DHS notified Congress in May that #LasVegas will receive $5 million from the UASI program to help protect against attacks. For years, I've pushed DHS to change the formula used to determine UASI grant $ to accurately reflect the needs of Las Vegas. https://t.co/VFrKEx2Vut

I wish the many #NV students who headed #BacktoSchool today a productive year. As the husband of a former teacher &amp; father of 4 kids who attended NV's public schools, I know how hard our teachers work &amp; that there are many important players dedicated to helping our kids succeed.

By doubling the #ChildTaxCredit &amp; lowering rates on low-income &amp; middle-class families, #NV families finally have the tax relief they’ve been waiting for. That’s what this new tax law is all about, &amp; it’s why I fought to see that Nevadans keep more of their hard-earned money.
In addition to helping w/ day-to-day costs, the increased #ChildTaxCredit allows families to better plan their futures. For example, Sarah, a single mom living in #NV, used her tax credit to help her &amp; her four children move out of a family shelter &amp; pay rent a year in advance.
As a member of @GOPSenFinance who helped craft the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, I was proud to author the provision that doubled the child tax credit, or increase it from $1,000 to $2,000. This could mean more money to help cover for groceries, school supplies, or diapers. https://t.co/Jfle1jlbWL
Today is #NationalTaxFilingDay &amp; it’s the last time #Nevadans will have to file taxes under the old, broken system. It’s only been a few months since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct became law, &amp; #Nevadans are already benefiting from bigger paychecks, special bonuses &amp; increased benefits.

I'm disappointed that my colleagues across the aisle chose the route of not working on appropriations bills and shutting down the government. More from my speech on the Senate floor during the #SchumerShutdown here: https://t.co/aBRXgl8L3t
VIDEO: I'm frustrated that Congress once again failed to do its job and now #Nevadans are left with the #SchumerShutdown. Maybe it’s time to start facing some pain around here, and that’s why I introduced my #NoBudgetNoPay bill. Watch here: https://t.co/zqP2xii7JQ
TUNE IN: I'm speaking on the U.S. Senate floor about my #NoBudgetNoPay bill. If Congress doesn't do its job, we shouldn't get paid. https://t.co/IlVOXeMFiN
Once again, Washington has lost its mind. It’s shameful what Democrats are doing; an engineered government shutdown at the expense of our troops &amp; their families, our vets &amp; our nation’s most vulnerable children. https://t.co/hmsBCt6Hbj #SchumerShutdown
Let's not forget how Congress got to this point; Democrats have prevented appropriations bills from receiving a vote, which is why we are in this position today. That’s why I have repeatedly introduced my #NoBudgetNoPay bill. Don't shut down the government, do your job.
Interesting. @SenateDems call me, I’ve had 2 bills out for months. #NoBudgetNoPay says if Congress can't do its job, we won't get paid. My #EnsuringPayforOurMilitaryAct guarantees troops get paid during a shutdown. Would like to add more members to both! https://t.co/cZPGYqIiWT
Why are Democrats who are engineering a government shutdown talking about the need for Congress to do its job? I have repeatedly introduced #NoBudgetNoPay to make sure of it. Shutting down the government hurts our troops and our vets. Of course Congress shouldn't get paid.
Rep. Scott Perry's recent comments on the Oct. 1st shooting in Las Vegas are inexcusable. I applaud Sheriff Lombardo's leadership and I fully support our local law enforcement who have been working tirelessly on this investigation.
If @SenateDems shut down the government, our troops will not get paid &amp; #vets will lose too. Too many vets, service members &amp; their families are already living paycheck to paycheck. An engineered shut down by @SenateDems is indefensible &amp; politics at its worst. #SchumerShutdown
.@SenateDems support #CHIP &amp; delaying #Obamacare's ill-conceived #HealthInsuranceTax &amp; #CadillacTax. In fact, my bipartisan measure to permanently repeal the #CadillacTax passed 90-10. So even though Dems support what's in the bill, they're still on board w/the #SchumerShutdown
In addition to funding the Children's Health Insurance Program, this bill delays #Obamacare’s #CadillacTax, which would hurt more than 1 million #Nevadans alone, and the #HealthInsuranceTax in order to prevent Americans from paying even more for their health care #SchumerShutdown
#CHIP serves as a lifeline for thousands of children in #Nevada. If @SenateDems shut down the government today, they are choosing partisanship over continued health care coverage for America’s vulnerable kids and their families. #SchumerShutdown

This is particularly important at a time when nearly 8 in 10 Americans who work full-time live paycheck to paycheck. Nevadans have been waiting for a break, and this is it. For example, this #taxrelief bill includes my and @SenatorTimScott provision to double the #childtaxcredit.
I encourage all #Nevadans to compare your paychecks today to the ones you'll receive in February; they're going to be bigger because our bill allows you to keep more of your hard-earned money.

Whether it’s the single mother in Gardnerville who works full-time or the ambitious entrepreneur in Reno who started a business while going to school, Nevadans throughout the state will benefit from the passage of this historic legislation. https://t.co/bYhNoFxtYo
I know how important it is for #Nevadans to be able to keep more of their paychecks. That’s why I have been fighting - and will continue to fight - to get this bill to the President’s desk.
If you're against this bill, you're against #taxcuts for the middle class because that's what this bill is all about. And if you know that nearly 1/3 of Americans don’t have $500 to cover an emergency expense, then you know how important a few hundred extra dollars are to them.
If you're against this bill, you're against giving #smallbiz the chance to actually get off the ground and hire workers. You’re against giving them a better opportunity to expand, invest, increase wages, and do what they do best: create jobs.
If you're against this bill, you're satisfied with the anemic 2% growth ushered in by the Obama Administration &amp; accept it as the new normal. But I'll never accept it because I know we can do better. We already have seen our economy improve since @POTUS took office.
We are now at a crossroads. We have a chance to change course. We have the opportunity to pass meaningful #taxcuts that will lift middle-class families, our communities, and our economy. Watch my speech on the #TaxCutsandJobsAct here: https://t.co/KR4mznpADW
Under the failed economic policies of the Obama Administration, #Nevadans suffered through 8 years of historically low economic growth. Think about this: in those 8 years, the average economic growth was less than 2 percent. As a result, wages and workers suffered.
Given rising housing and childcare expenses alone, middle-class families in #Nevada and around this country are having a hard time covering day-to-day expenses and planning for their futures. So it’s fair to say that -- in Nevada at least -- the recession has never really ended.
In #NV, real median household income is $7,000 lower today than it was in 2007. At the same time, childcare expenses have skyrocketed. In this country, the average cost for an infant in center-based care can be as high as $17,082 per year. That’s more than a semester at UNLV!
The majority of Americans are not only struggling to get ahead, they’re struggling to just get by. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans who work full-time live paycheck to paycheck. If you live in #NV, you’re more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck than Americans living elsewhere.

@EPA decision to eliminate an overreaching Obama-era rule is a win for Nevada’s mining industry, which helps employ nearly 25,000 workers in our state alone. Proud to have led the congressional effort against this harmful rule. https://t.co/JmYPHw4udf

The @USGAO’s findings are shocking, worrisome &amp; reprehensible. Congress must pass the VA Provider Accountability Act, a bill I intro'd w/@Sen_JoeManchin, to help ensure that #veterans are not at risk of receiving unsafe care from poor-performing providers. https://t.co/JstqA3plHl

BIG NEWS: Updated Senate #taxrelief bill includes my and @SenatorTimScott amendment that increases the child tax credit to $2,000 - that's 1,000 more than current law. Great news for hardworking #NV families and Americans everywhere: https://t.co/Js4sq3UPZP

Nevadans deserve a break, and that’s why I've been fighting to give middle-class families the biggest tax cut possible. The Senate tax relief bill is a positive step toward providing families with the tax relief they desperately need and deserve: https://t.co/jUQltXiFto
In #NV, real median household income is down $7,000 from 10 years ago, childcare expenses are skyrocketing, and families are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck in Nevada than almost anywhere else in the country.
My mom was a school cook and my dad was an auto mechanic, and they told their kids that if they work hard then they too can achieve the American dream. However, too many Nevadans tell me that they think it’s out of reach.
