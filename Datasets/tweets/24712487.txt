@sullivanst We put it in the right mailbox.
RT @sullivanst: @KagroX I like the "properly submitted" for the way it seems to imply, but actually does not, "properly filled out".
Ivanka‚Äôs statement is a categorical denial of any involvement by her father in any part of the process that resulted in Kushner being granted a clearance.		Lowell‚Äôs statement describes (accurately, perhaps) the initial process by which Kushner‚Äôs initial application was denied.
Ivanka said, ‚Äúthe president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband‚Äôs clearance, zero.‚Äù		Lowell said, "his application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process.‚Äù		Very different.
The real problem in the article is here: ‚ÄúLowell... also said that at the time the clearance was granted last year that his client went through a standard process. Ivanka Trump... said the same thing three weeks ago.‚Äù		She did not say the same thing. At all.
Like I said, genius parsing. Lowell‚Äôs statement on Kushner‚Äôs security clearance is 100% correct. It just doesn‚Äôt address how he got the clearance.
Masterful parsing in the Kushner security clearance story from Abbe Lowell: Kushner‚Äôs ‚Äúapplication was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process.‚Äù		Yes, and it failed of that process, later overruled. https://t.co/5R1sUvHKtU

So, you've just learned an important lesson that millions before you have had the chance to learn, too. Everyone has to learn it for themselves, of course. Sometimes it helps to have one of those who came before tell you it's OK, and you can still keep going.
It sucks and they're often dismissive. Even if you're an adult and a subject matter expert.		But also, sometimes you win anyway, and find in the end that you do so with the votes of the same Senator who wasn't nice to you.

It's not hard work to sign documents properly. God forbid he should lift a finger to do the bare minimum required by the office.

It'll be a horrible bottleneck, but unless you've inspected the document and you've SEEN him sign it, you can't accept it.		No more written messages to Congress. You'll have to come to the Hill and sign it before witnesses. Sorry. You brought this on yourself.
There's a lot that gets done in government, by necessity, based on the assumption that the president's written communications are valid.		This "president" gives us every reason to question every document.
Seriously. Stop automatically believing in the existence and validity of Trump documents. Even the Congress--perhaps especially the Congress--should stop simply accepting written communications from "the president" without examination and a vote.
Again, I always question the validity and even the existence of every supposed Trump order or other written communication. I literally never believe in their existence until I see them, and never believe in their validity until they're vetted. You shouldn't either. https://t.co/sgmojsiTFM

@KenAshford It‚Äôs hard to see it on purpose. Because the policy has consistently succeeded in keeping it from coming into focus.
@armandodkos @KenAshford No. But I am saying that it is the policy of the executive branch not to do anything that would establish a clear precedent on the question of who wins in an all-out, pitched battle. They prefer instead to offer to testify voluntarily, but only if any subpoenas are withdrawn.
@KenAshford They do. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it isn‚Äôt DOJ policy, that the question has ever been settled, or that we know how this Court would address it.
I was under the impression that it was always DOJ policy (and probably government-wide policy) not to agree to send cabinet officers, etc. under subpoena, simply in order to prevent separation of powers issues from arising, if at all possible.

If, say, a buddy from Mar-a-Lago, gets wind of this happening (and maybe some inside info on when it might end), he can offer those workers half their wages to come on board, and then he‚Äôs the only company fully staffed &amp; ready to start work when the shutdown ends.
Keep the gov‚Äôt closed, and the contractors who clean gov‚Äôt offices can‚Äôt pay their workers &amp; have no revenue coming in. A month-long shutdown forces them to fold, or at least cut many of their workers loose.
I wonder if Trump was convinced to keep the shutdown going longer in order to drive some federal gov‚Äôt service contractors out of business, so that his cronies could step in and replace the incumbents, perhaps even hiring away the incumbent‚Äôs workers at half-wages.

@AB2kGR @Byebyesugah @Scout_Finch You didn‚Äôt jump to conclusions about the fact that there were young women in the video?
@AB2kGR @Byebyesugah @Scout_Finch We may yet find the same kids appearing in other videos.		In the meantime, I don‚Äôt know how ludicrous the assumption is that they‚Äôe from the same school. Were there a lot of groups there at the time from the Cincinnati area? (Or were we looking at an out-of-market Bengals fan?)
@AB2kGR @Byebyesugah @Scout_Finch I dunno. You can be skeptical, but the evidence you just offered me was pretty easily refuted.		There could be more, and questioning h assumption that they‚Äôre the from the same school counts as something. But it‚Äôs a lot weaker than the winner you thought you were serving.
@AB2kGR @Byebyesugah @Scout_Finch What do we say about the young women plainly visible in close proximity to the verified videos of the CovCath boys, including the ones they circulated themselves, of their school cheers? I can see them and you can, too.

Besides living with the realization that we've actually reached that moment where Trump is issuing orders to the US Armed Forces to exact punishment on his domestic political enemies, you mean? https://t.co/cdn4tSaCpx
And doing what Putin (and other governmental mobsters) want is the price of admission to the "oligarchs" club. You don't get to be one, or get to continue living as one (or at all) if you don't kick up.
The nongovernmental mobsters, of course, were chiefly interested in the money laundering. They threw in backing for the espionage both because changing US sanctions policy would help them launder (and recover) more, and because Putin wanted it.
Imagine having all this intelligence delivered right to your laptop, in the comfort of your own home! It's like Uber, but for espionage and money laundering!
And the dumber and less widely-supported their anti-Obama grievance was, the more in need of cash and fake Russian legitimization they would be, and therefore the more susceptible to Russian mobster advances. Perfect!
They advertised their willingness to do it on the Internet every day. All Russian mobsters who were getting hit with sanctions had to do was read it &amp; they‚Äôd know right away who'd be willing to take cash to undermine America. Er, I mean, further their legitimate political agenda.
Sure, the latter is illegal, and they may even know that.		But like I said, this is the original ‚Äúhate the president more than they love their country‚Äù gang. 		Sarah Sanders stole that line. These people were clear about their interest in doing ANYTHING to undermine Obama.
So the wingnuts come back from their all-expenses-paid trips to Russia, willing to do things as dumb as, say, chanting ‚ÄúRussia is our friend!‚Äù at their Nazi rallies.		Or, just by way of example, launder Russian mob cash into straw donations to Republican candidates.
They enjoy Russian ‚Äúhospitality,‚Äù and by some curious coincidence, also happen to meet highly ‚Äúconnected‚Äù Russians who seem remarkably into sharing their interests, even though no regular Russians really care about home schooling, guns they can‚Äôt get, or Miss Universe.
That left plenty of mobster cash available for wining &amp; dining American wingnuts they ferried to Russia on the thinnest of pretenses. ‚ÄúOh, have a home schooling conference in Moscow!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, have a gun rights conference in Moscow!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, have a Miss Universe pageant in Moscow!"
@MatthewBoedy @C_Stroop Yes. Prominently mentioned in the article I was reading today.
And it was cheap intel to gather, too. No need to have actual agents on the ground in America, reporting back to Moscow what the fracture lines were. Americans were posting that information willingly on the Internet, which meant Russians didn‚Äôt even have to leave home to read it.
It didn‚Äôt take a lot of political sophistication to understand that the American ultra-right were the original ‚Äúhate the president more than they love their country‚Äù gang.		Anything the wingnuts were into was a potential entry point for Russian mobster cash.

@CarlNyberg312 No shit. Then you tried to construct something that would somehow demonstrate that laying the evidentiary groundwork for what you say you‚Äôre arguing for was somehow a display of Democratic fecklessness.		You should fucking drop the act already, Carl.
The mistake you don‚Äôt want to make is seeing a flexible statement like Pelosi made, and coming away with the much more rigid interpretation that impeachment is somehow tied to the contents of the report, or worse, its actual receipt.
Jeff has done a great job explaining what concerned Dems should be saying.		Pelosi said ‚ÄúWe have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report.‚Äù		Trump suppresses the Mueller report? Well, now we‚Äôve seen what happens with it. Time to move.		https://t.co/6n8ohgzW3x
@CarlNyberg312 Trump will argue lots of things. But no, that‚Äôs nonsense. That‚Äôs like arguing that evidence of a crime is exculpatory because you weren‚Äôt punished for the evidence‚Äôs existence.		In fact, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlike‚Äù it. It IS it.
Use this great formulation to help you: 		Pelosi's exact words were "We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report."		https://t.co/6n8ohgzW3x
And you can use the speech to explain why "waiting for the Mueller report" isn't and can't really be the trigger for all your decision-making. Give yourselves room to maneuver, especially if the "report" is suppressed or otherwise delayed. Why would you tie yourselves to it? https://t.co/eArKMhwcxV
@Hesiod2k11 @JoshuaHol @murshedz Which is the same thing as its defeat.
@Hesiod2k11 @JoshuaHol @murshedz It might. Or its defeat in the Senate might render it a nullity, whereas a House resolution can stand on its own. I‚Äôd pass both. Put the text of the resolution in the rule for the bill. One vote does it all.
@Hesiod2k11 @JoshuaHol @murshedz It might not be.		But continued silence is far worse than ‚Äúnot sure if it‚Äôs enough."
@CarlNyberg312 It‚Äôs a statement that there is something less than Congressional consent.		In the absence of any statement from Congress, it‚Äôs too easy to cast silence as consent.
@JoshuaHol @murshedz We all thought a lot of things. Then, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were appointed to the Court that tells you what it will mean when it counts.		There are any number of SCOTUS cases that turn on whether Congressional inaction = tacit approval.		Why leave doubt if you don‚Äôt have to?
@ploeg_ And even Nadler‚Äôs signals aren‚Äôt entirely clear:		"But he is waiting for the Mueller report to determine whether there is "real evidence of serious impeachable offenses that the president has committed.‚Äù https://t.co/n9qPKAxcGS
@ploeg_ Which is, of course, being picked up and repeated by columnists:		It‚Äôs not the time for Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), without waiting for the Mueller report, to announce plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump. https://t.co/wiuNJmqIjs
@ploeg_ But others appear to be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs premature to consider what remedy is appropriate,‚Äù Schiff said. ‚ÄúAfter Bob Mueller issues his report, we ought to see what evidence he produces, before we have any discussions of what the consequences should be.‚Äù
@murshedz @JoshuaHol Emoluments are forbidden "without the consent of Congress.‚Äù		Right now there‚Äôs nothing on the record. A resolution of disapproval erases doubt.
@NicholasSeattle It‚Äôs a solid statement. What I‚Äôm looking for is anticipation of suppression or delay of the report, and giving people an out from that. Early and clear, so no one has to go back and look up the quotes and parse the record.
@DARDYER I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know if Don Jr. knows what he‚Äôs talking about.
Anybody got any reason why the House of Representatives shouldn‚Äôt immediately adopt a resolution disapproving of Trump accepting any foreign emoluments?
@Steverocks35 @jkfecke Or it might not be. Well, that point‚Äôs effectively dispensed with.
@jkfecke @Steverocks35 To who? Even Trump can‚Äôt stop talking about impeachment.
@jkfecke Why point to them after the fact when you can do it now and make things clearer?
@Steverocks35 @jkfecke Why bother wondering? Just take a clearer stance that if such a report is issued and suppressed, that‚Äôs a trigger, period.
@jkfecke I don‚Äôt disagree. But I don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs the message the rest of the caucus is carrying away, nor is it the message the media are distilling. That‚Äôs not her fault, but it needs a lot of work.
@Hesiod2k11 Then you have no problem here.
@Hesiod2k11 Pence knows next to nothing, and you shouldn‚Äôt give him the benefit of the doubt.
@Hesiod2k11 Zzz.
@Hesiod2k11 Right. Like I said, I heard this once at President Ford‚Äôs inaugural ball.
@jkfecke Public pledges to tie impeachment to a report Trump will have the opportunity to suppress isn‚Äôt methodical in the least.
@Hesiod2k11 Everyone remembers President Ford‚Äôs first election.
@Hesiod2k11 I might argue that, if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that the entire party will still be under the cloud of the impeachment.
Look, you don‚Äôt have to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm for impeachment‚Äù if you don‚Äôt want to.		But don‚Äôt set yourself up for never being able to be for impeachment without being accused of hypocrisy or moving the goalposts.
@Hesiod2k11 Yes, nobody would want to run against Captain Charisma.		I think I would actually argue that that‚Äôs a dumb position.
@jkfecke A case.		Mueller has one case. What‚Äôs Mueller doing on emoluments? Nothing. There‚Äôs a case.		Suppressing the report would be another case. But, sorry, you‚Äôre still waiting for the report.		Give yourself a chance. If you don‚Äôt want to commit to a case, don‚Äôt! This position does!
Saying you‚Äôre waiting for ‚Äúthe Muller report‚Äù before deciding on impeachment, but then saying, ‚ÄúWell, the Mueller ‚Äòreport‚Äô is really in the form of his various indictments‚Äù puts you in a bit of a ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall though the USMCA‚Äù situation.
@DARDYER That may be the ultimate outcome. But it doesn't solve the problem of commiting to the release of a "report."
Of course, if Trump suppressed the report, you could impeach him for that. Which proves the point that you didn't need the report after all.		Only you'll be saying it a year after everyone else said it. By which time it will be campaign season, and you'll insist we wait again.
@count_01 Which will only lead to endless questions from the press about why your new call for impeachment without the report isn't hypocritical.
If you publicly commit to "waiting for the Mueller report" before you decide on impeachment, doesn't that make suppressing the report an irresistible play for Trump?
@brianbeutler Is there a House Radio and TV Gallery rule against it?
How dumb is it? Well, you'll literally be involved in a lawsuit over actions that by themselves warrant impeachment, but you'll still be asked by the press whether impeachment would violate your pledge to wait for the report.
Another reason not to "wait for the Mueller report" is that it leaves you pledged to sit in your hands if Trump orders the DOJ to suppress the report.		Can you sue? Sure! But while you're suing, you're still pledged to "waiting." And that's dumb.

@CarlNyberg312 To see if anyone who‚Äôs listening has any idea, so that I can have a quick conversation on it.
@tomdog Well, no. That‚Äôs not actually how it would go. But let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that the Speaker gets the members to agree to vote in support of adopting the https://t.co/cT7LJz96DV list. Fine. Now we need to find members who meet this criterion and who will agree to serve.
@CarlNyberg312 I don‚Äôt see why I can‚Äôt discuss things on Twitter. If you don‚Äôt know the answer, you don‚Äôt know the answer. That‚Äôs OK.
@CarlNyberg312 Is nuclear power $$$ against the rules for these purposes?		Do Republicans have to have zero fossil fuel money, or just Democrats?
@tomdog OK. Now, who decides whether we accept the proposal to use the https://t.co/cT7LJz96DV list?
So you‚Äôre looking for a floor vote on establishing a Green New Deal committee with no members of the minority on it whatsoever.		You can afford to lose no more than 18 Dem votes on the resolution establishing that committee.		Can you do it? https://t.co/X8U1y9PAv1
I suppose we could even be willing to consider trashing the rule book and appointing a committee with no minority representation on it at all. Because let‚Äôs face it, every vote of a Green New Deal committee would end up being along party lines, anyway.		Not a great look, but ok.
And remember, on a relatively small committee of 20 members, 8 or 9 of them are going to be members of the minority.		So I need a minimum of 8 Republicans who don‚Äôt take any fossil fuel money.		Who‚Äôs got that list?
@tomdog OK. Who makes the list?
So, suppose I had the power to give the Green New Deal committee the go-ahead all by myself, and that I did it.		How many seats would that committee have, and who would be on it?		Could you put together a list of, say, 20 names that have no fossil fuel money in the bank?

How do you take the proposal to the House and say you want to put together a committee that will take a shot at saving the world, but as it turns out, it will be comprised of 11 Democrats and zero Republicans?		Under the normal rules, that‚Äôs a real problem. But, ok, not normal.
I‚Äôm not looking to pick a fight about this. I‚Äôd consider it a real triumph if we were able to work out a real process for putting such a thing together.		But how do you put together a committee that has a rule in place before the committee constitutes itself and adopts that rule?

What if he also thinks the permanent, indefinite appropriations that fund the Special Counsel and therefore survive a government shutdown apply only to the now-expired Independent Counsel statute, and gets Trump‚Äôs GAO (which inexplicably OKed his hotel ownership) to agree? https://t.co/lH6iqUokXX
Of course they are. Republicans were elected to do terrible things that suck. And, of course, were recently defeated for having tried it. https://t.co/givmT75PnL
@joeff53 So you still have to have a cloture vote to force an end to debate, in the absence of unanimous consent to end it. Doing that requires a vote, and today, that vote is carried by a simple majority.
@joeff53 Well, a suspension of the rules would require a 2/3 vote. But no, it‚Äôs not a rules change. It‚Äôs just a different interpretation of precedent. Nobody eliminated the cloture rule. They just agreed to interpret it to mean that for nominations, cloture would require a simple majority
That‚Äôs OK. The preceding vote to ‚Äúestablish the precedent‚Äù was total bullshit on the same grounds. https://t.co/ig6Cldr3Rf
As part of the 1975 cloture rules change, the Senate agreed to take an additional vote purporting to unrecognize the precedent they‚Äôd just set in invoking cloture to change the rules by majority vote. https://t.co/jmMIuTMWT6
