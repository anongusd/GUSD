@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN The context was Omar working herself up about the unfairness of having to tiptoe around Jewish sensitivities when she is a victim, and a friendly crowd egging her on and loosening her inhibitions.
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Maybe she has just absorbed a lot of anti-Semitic analyses without keeping track in the front of her brain which parts she can and cannot say in public.
When Omar did her "all about the Benjamins" tweet, I told my colleagues it was a 1.5 out of 10: Small slip, apologize and move on. Her "allegiance to a foreign power" comment is more like a 7/10. https://t.co/ii5zGQTvtC
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Here's the clip. She is talking about Israel: https://t.co/cG1GxVldTo
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Got it. Here is my thumbnail argument about why her comments were so noxious: https://t.co/Gn3MHWgKTs
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Since Omar presents "allegiance to a foreign power" as scandalous on its face, I don't think she sees it the way you do.
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I think we're at an impasse. I think accusing Israel supporters of promoting "allegiance to a foreign power" is an ugly, dangerous, and unfair attack, and I don't think anything Ben Shapiro has said justifies it.
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Because one can have total allegiance to the United States while still believing your country should (for moral and or strategic reasons) maintain a strong alliance with another country.
Ilhan Omar accuses pro-Israel activists of dual loyalty. That's an ugly and dangerous smear. https://t.co/CR7qVR0bUD
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Because he, like all these others do, is arguing for his community to support certain values and policies, not arguing for allegiance to a foreign power.
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN I have not seen Shapiro advocate dual loyalty. I have seen him argue for a set of values and policies that I don't share
@EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN How is it different than liberal Jews who say Republican Jews are betraying their people, or liberal African-Americans who say this about African-American Republicans?
@EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Shapiro's argument for why Jews should vote Republican is the same as other arguments for why ethnic/cultural groups should vote for a party. He is not advocating allegiance to a foreign country at the expense of the US.
@EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN No, Shapiro is not arguing Jews must have "allegiance" to Israel. He is arguing for a set of values and policies.

@EricLevitz @jbouie Therefore, better an orderly retreat in 2019 to a strong climate plan they can/will defend and eventually implement than a panicked flight in 2020.
@EricLevitz @jbouie My take is that the Democrats who endorsed it don't actually realize what they endorsed. They're also not going to want to defend it from Republican attacks or or try to pass it (to the extent it is a thing).
@EricLevitz @jbouie I was referring more to liberal elites. I agree that JG polls well. Unfortunately nobody has figured out how to design a workable one.
@EricLevitz @jbouie I think a lot of liberals support it because they like the label and the concept but don't understand it as anything more than "ambitious climate plan with lots of green jobs."
@EricLevitz @jbouie Like with many ideological categories, there are gray areas where one (i.e. left liberalism) blends into another (socialism.) AOC and Bernie self-identify as socialists, and the Green New Deal reflects their vision. 		I can see other labels as reasonable, too, though.
I think the GOP is probably right to see this as good short-term politics. Long term, as @jbouie suggests, it may backfire on them.
There's a symbiotic relationship between the GOP and the socialist left, which share an interest in raising the profile of socialist pols like AOC and their policies. https://t.co/3HHkjjpK0u

Anyway, FDR's handling of WW2 was correct, as @ChuckLane1 suggests, but it's not the right model for handling climate today. A better model is to look at building on and scaling up Obama's successful green reforms.
@realaxelfoley To be clear, I recognize this is the point you were probably getting at.
@realaxelfoley I think there's a deeper point here in the link between conformity of style and conformity of thought, and how Twitter promotes both.
@HeerJeet FDR was not a dictator, and nobody is calling him that. I'm surprised you're denying he did anything undemocratic. I assumed we all agree now Japanese-American internment, for example, was undemocratic.
@mattyglesias @ChuckLane1 My take is that the real model for action is what Obama did, and which can be ramped up a lot. WW2 is a really bad model.

@mattyglesias It's the premise that any real response to climate change means dismantling capitalism. Pricing carbon is not just insufficient but actually bad. Naomi Klein made this case: https://t.co/RofJKQhC9y
@gelliottmorris @ThePlumLineGS @MattGrossmann Well, if we accept the premise they're "for" the GND, that means they've endorsed something close to the DSA full-scale domestic agenda! Not sure how you measure it, but that would be a huge leftward move.
The green New Deal reflects the premise that the only way to address climate change is socialism. Naomi Klein's 2015 book made that case -- very badly: https://t.co/RofJKQzd16
@gelliottmorris @ThePlumLineGS @MattGrossmann To me the question is whether candidates who co-sponsor this bill can be portrayed by Trump as endorsing it, and whether the MSM accepts this linkage. I wouldn't rule that out.
@ThePlumLineGS @MattGrossmann @gelliottmorris Agree -- that assumes the candidates all wriggle away from it to some degree. If they continue endorsing it without hedging, though, it will literally be their platform.
@MattGrossmann @gelliottmorris *If* the Democratic candidates continue endorsing the Green New Deal, which is basically the whole Sanders domestic agenda (JG, M4A, etc.) that would put them pretty far left of the recent past.

@thomaschattwill Totally agree with that. I'm just saying that, if you take as a given the permanence of known popular culture stories, then it makes perfect sense to diversify them.		But by all means, challenge the premise that we must keep recycling.
@thomaschattwill So, if we are always going to have a large portion of pop culture given over to Batman, Superman, Robin Hood, etc, then either large portions of these stories will be reserved for white men, or we have to alter them.
@thomaschattwill I'm not a fan of the franchising-remaking system. But I guess the answer is, there are certain classic characters/stories in pop culture that will never be dislodged.
@thomaschattwill I find comic books boring and lament their takeover of film, but representation in popular culture stories is a completely understandable desire.

@BenMathisLilley I disagree, because their research does in fact show that urban charters in Massachusetts produce huge learning gains in the schools that would have been expanded by the referendum she opposed.
@BenMathisLilley That sentencing was referring to lottery-based studies, which I think is perfectly clear from context.
@BenMathisLilley What other possible relevance does this research have to the proposal (Question 2) that we're debating?
@BenMathisLilley You're saying they either intentionally unintentionally used a misleading sample that invalidates their conclusion about the effectiveness of urban charters,. That's your basis for challenging their conclusions!
@BenMathisLilley You said they engaged in a "misleading characterizations of the scope of their studies in their Brookings paper, which I don’t believe mentioned that charters which closed or were disorganized weren’t studied.”

@BenMathisLilley Sure, that's fair. Principled opposition to charters can justify making poor kids get worse educations. Likewise, principled opposition to government health insurance can justify repealing the ACA. But that is not warren's stance.
@BenMathisLilley Right, the charge you're making here is a serious survey design error that, if true, would undercut the study's conclusions as the authors themselves have described them.

@BenMathisLilley Right, the proposal was to lift the cap in Boston, where charters have proven highly successful.
My guess is the players would prefer some nice steaks or something they can't get every day, and Trump's notion that they can't appreciate food nicer than McDonald is probably condescending and false. https://t.co/3PyuhE52IS
My concern about Elizabeth Warren: How do you sustain moralistic politics in a world where everybody is compromised? https://t.co/GyHV9dtPXa
@mattyglesias I emphasize both!
@rmc031 Anyway, I am pretty skeptical Boston would end up shorting its fire and police services because they're letting too many poor kids attend charters. But even if this somehow occurred I'd be okay with it.
In September I wrote about all the reasons Elizabeth Warren is great. https://t.co/37CrdYFUPc		Here are a couple things that make me hesitate: https://t.co/GyHV9dceyA
@ErikLoomis For those interested, she has worked previously at a charter school, and also as a traditional public school teacher, in addition to a think-tank and at federal and district-level education agencies. She is currently an analyst.
Here @ErikLoomis reiterates the charge that I am biased on education policy because I have benefitted from my wife's expertise as a policy analyst: https://t.co/gOh5O5WNPQ
@rmc031 I think giving poor students a better education actually should be the highest priority, so I have no problem doing that.
1. Green energy subsidies	2. Expanded public-subsidized health insurance	3. Greater corporate regulation	4. Higher taxes on the rich, lower taxes on the poor		Barack Obama accomplished every one of these.
The specifics of this list reveal the vacuousness of the charge that all recent Democratic presidents have abandoned the FDR legacy: https://t.co/DKp6WrNbva https://t.co/SgefZYecTP
The Warren Native American story is a nothingburger. Here are a couple issues that do give me pause about her (generally very good) candidacy: https://t.co/GyHV9dtPXa
@rmc031 Agree, and it's also true that not everybody opposed to the medical device tax was duped by the medical device industry. I still don't like it when politicians take bad policy stances that align with lobbying campaigns by constituencies they need.
@fawfulfan @BioTurboNick @integrityhound @AmericanCMR @yonderbaby @bayofarizona @BenMathisLilley The study I referenced compares lottery applicants who got into charters to those who didn't. The results are extremely clear: https://t.co/SS1tiGjSwW
@fawfulfan @integrityhound @AmericanCMR @yonderbaby @bayofarizona @BenMathisLilley Is there any evidence at all that could even theoretically cause you to support increasing the charter cap in Massachusetts?
@rmc031 Right. Her position was still, in my opinion, very bad for low income urban students, but good for Warren's political future.
@fawfulfan @integrityhound @AmericanCMR @yonderbaby @bayofarizona @BenMathisLilley Did you read the study of charter performance in Massachusetts that i linked?
@billscher @BenMathisLilley Both sides spent a lot: https://t.co/D1uSGLObM6		The power relationship that concerns here is the impact on Warren's career. teacher unions have far more sway over her than do charter school philanthropists.
I think Elizabeth Warren is overall really good. Here are a couple issues where she's terrible. https://t.co/GyHV9dtPXa
@BenMathisLilley The main question here is her stance on the issue, which strikes me as not only wrong but, based on the research, impossible to justify except on political grounds. Have you read the study?
@BenMathisLilley The donors to the charters schools may be rich, but their interest in this issue is philanthropic, making it quite different than an interest group protecting its own income.
@BenMathisLilley The interest group in this issue that holds power over Warren's political future is the teacher unions. If it was a Republican, the calculus would be different.
@BenMathisLilley Yes, she sided with the group that's most relevant to her political future, harming the interests of poor students in her student according to the absolute best research.

4. If the objection is that a president’s child should not even be named in a joke about a president, that’s a position with which I disagree.
3. The joke was directed at Donald Trump, and specifically, the reported qualities he is looking for in a Chief of Staff. It’s made at his expense, not his son’s. The premise does not assume any deficiencies on Barron’s part.
2. I certainly agree that it’s wrong to make fun of a president’s child (or any child!). However, at the risk of murdering my joke, I think it’s important to note that it was not directed at -- or, in any meaningful sense, about -- Barron Trump.

@JonahNRO @MichaelRStrain Bracket "affirmative action," and the point stands: white people on the whole have more voting power on average than non-whites in the Senate. You're saying that's not a problem at all, and would not be one however large the disparity, correct?
@MichaelRStrain @ChuckLane1 @JonahNRO Not automatically at all. Have you ever read @DLeonhardt ? It's one aspect of political representation.
@JonahNRO @MichaelRStrain You're denying that African-Americans have any shared political interests? Their only interests are those of the state in which they reside? A Black person in Alabama has more in common white white Alabamans than with a black Georgian?
@ChuckLane1 @JonahNRO @MichaelRStrain This is why the column did an aggregate finding. You don't need to go state by state. Many macro-trends have micro-exceptions or confounding instances.
@ChuckLane1 @JonahNRO @MichaelRStrain Race is just one metric. You could analyze by partisanship, but that likewise shows Republicans have greater representation than Democrats
@JonahNRO @MichaelRStrain Got it. Question: is there a level at which differential representation of whites vs. non-whites would become a problem at all, in your view? Could differential population growth increase the disparity to X% such that X is problematically high for your taste?

@EricLevitz Well, I think the question is their argument itself, not the propriety of them making it. They believe these departments are intellectual monocultures with resultant low standards, a problem unlike (or much worse) than flaws in history, poli sci, philosophy, etc
@EricLevitz Economics is a field where you have people with very different ideological beliefs jostling, so papers aren't published *only* for conforming to a single ideology. I don't think that applies to the departments being lampooned here.

@EricLevitz To put it better: maybe, or maybe not, you should have political goals in the final weeks of an election. But that's definitely not a good model for how you should think and speak all the time.
@EricLevitz I mean, if drones are your issue, then i don't have a problem with it. I think the logic of late-stage elections should not be imported to intellectual debate generally.
@EricLevitz I think they believe there is a particular problem in those departments and want to highlight and correct it because they believe in the mission of universities.
@EricLevitz I feel like lots of people on the left object to criticisms of the left without, as you're doing here, objecting to the substance of the argument. "This isn't the biggest problem," "stop helping right-wing narratives" are kinds of arguments that stigmatize self-criticism.
@EricLevitz I also suspect many of the center-left academics in my TL who shared that story have the same belief.

If 1 more GOP Senator joins Flake, there will be an FBI investigation, because otherwise they will lack the votes to confirm Kavanaugh on the floor.		My bet is they get one. https://t.co/dlgRHRO3O8
I see lots of confusion. Here's what just happened. Flake said he won't vote for Kavanaugh on the floor unless there's an FBI investigation. He said others "on his side" (i.e., Republicans) agree with him.		If he has 1 more Republican, he can force the investigation.
Senatorial institutional clubbiness is more bad than good as a political force, IMO. But it is not all bad. And right now it is doing some good.

@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan Not many politicians start out planning to implement bloody Stalinist purges. They conceive of politics in such a way that leads them down that path.
@yeselson @AdamSerwer @BrendanNyhan Yes, the correct course IMO is insisting upon *democratic* norms, which means abolishing the filibuster, pro-democracy voting reforms, etc.
@yeselson @AdamSerwer @BrendanNyhan I agree with that!
@_waleedshahid they were literally in a war
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan and by "define" I mean to the exclusion of all other values -- on which point McElwee is explicit.
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan In any case, whether or not that's the intent, when you define politics as being destruction of your enemies, that's where you wind up, even if it's not where you set out to go at first. By my reading of history, anyway.
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan "through policy," I suppose, but yes.
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan And I read the "there is nothing else" to exclude things like democratic norms.
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan I read that comment as endorsing, among other things, policies that would give Democrats an advantage by literally killing Republicans, which he believes Republicans are already doing to Democrats.
@AdamSerwer @yeselson @BrendanNyhan It's a part of politics. To define it as the *sum* of politics, emphasizing that there's nothing else, chucks aside a lot of important things.

@delong @spooknine I am not planning to spend 6 weeks on this topic. I wrote one tweet and decided to waste time reading my mentions  on a rainy Sunday.
@delong @spooknine Here is a thread on the actual dispute, which is leftist twitter insisting the teaching of Zinn as a primary US history text to high schoolers is either bad/never happens or good/happens https://t.co/o0ltDJej8Q
@delong @spooknine Bling retweeting this kind of attack without even knowing the subject matter it describes, let alone the facts themselves, is the definition of tribalism.
7/ Anyway. Obviously only a small minority of HS history teachers use Zinn as a primary text. I wrote one tweet saying it's a thing that some teachers do, and they shouldn't do it.
6/ is that they keep sharing tweets based on a mistaken assumption I was discussing college. Some of them are reasonable people acting on a mistaken premise.		None of them seem to have come across my repeated tweets explaining that I am not talking about college courses.
5/ Yet another round of people continue to “rebut” my claim by saying this never happens in COLLEGE history courses. I assume they’re right. What’s striking about this…https://t.co/vTTNjQ4euz

2/ I did not mention, though I later noted on several occasions, that I had heard this in reference to high school, not college, history courses.
1/ Yesterday I tweeted out a link to a Slate piece about the problems with using Howard Zinn as a primary history text (as opposed to as a corrective.) I added that I’ve heard from several people that Zinn was used as their primary history text: https://t.co/ER6dAaL5lU

@yeselson @JeffreyASachs @jtlevy Neither are most of the other set pieces I describe. Nor many things that happened after the story came out. So your data is simply not measuring the phenomenon I describe.
@yeselson @JeffreyASachs @jtlevy Exactly. Go through my piece, start with the first anecdote: Omar Mahmood fired from Michigan Daily for writing gentle satire, then his apartment door is vandalized. That episode is not recorded by your data, right? https://t.co/dWyIvy96FB

@yeselson I feel like I've defined it many times before! I just thought that was a timely example of a case that's neither "campus" nor "free speech," and thus illustrates that the lack of a campus free speech problem does not mean there's no problem.
This underscores the point I make in a thread below: there's a problem with the way the left constructs debates over identity that's neither a "free speech" issue nor a "campus" issue https://t.co/CvYPx7v47S https://t.co/fHdIYt6rOl

@jtlevy @soashworth @HeerJeet @JeffreyASachs The data just is not responsive to my analysis. Very few or possibly none of the episodes in my original story would even be recorded by the dataset you describe: https://t.co/dWyIvyqI4b
@mattyglesias @IChotiner Yes, tat would have saved us all a lot of time.

@ProfAmyCohn @CitizenCohn Truly Jon's command of the culture is sweeping.
@cjane87 I agree. I think the author would say he is not blaming the victim, he is arguing (and I find his case heavily overstated) the victim has remedy the problem.
@cjane87 Right, he's saying that aside from paying for it, the victim simply can't be made whole through compensation.
@cjane87 That's the point of his analogy of the car crash victim -- you still have to do the rehab yourself even though you're 0% to blame for being hit by a car.
@cjane87 Yeah, I'm just saying that I think the argument he's attempting is NOT that racism and inequality are the fault of black people, but that being responsible for solving it is not the same as being at fault for their existence...
@cjane87 I agree, and there are a lot of problems -- I'm just saying he was "trying." Lack of acknowledgement of ongoing discrimination is a massive flaw in this piece.

I appreciate the correction here by @dylanmatt https://t.co/KKbrci1p5e
@dylanmatt Yes, I do argue Trump might be, not "is," a Russian asset. Asset is a broad enough term encompassing different gradations of leverage.
Contrary to what @dylanmatt says here, I never wrote, and do not think, Trump is a Russian "agent." I think there is a reasonable chance he is being leveraged, but that is totally different. https://t.co/JbytbuCHjQ
