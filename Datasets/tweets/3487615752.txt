@keith_sowden @jccady @SenJeffMerkley Well, three million more Americans certainly had something different to say.
@JoettaMoonChild @Jacks_Bck @CNN You know that I agree...but Israel did, just yesterday, indict the head of state. That is at least one practice from them that we can adopt
@keith_sowden @SenJeffMerkley Absolutely. Read any polling data. We have already installed fencing where it works. Moreover, even if his crazy emergency declaration is upheld by the courts, the logistical problems &amp; eminent domain court cases will drag this out for decades
@zaptrapped I agree. I am simply saying that if you can’t name the VP, you shouldn’t be voting
@Jacks_Bck @CNN I wasn’t “only” looking at Israel. The discussion was about Israel. There are any number of our “allies” who I believe to be taking advantage of us. During the Six Day War, Israel attacked a U.S. ship &amp; killed 34 Americans (an incidentthat, to this day, has not been explained)
RT @funder: "Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz just made the evolution from plain old creepy behavior to tampering-with-a-witness territory."…
@NJCentrist @Wonce_In_A Let’s be honest...I left the GOP before my first presidential election in 2000. This race to the bottom started 25 years ago. The Bush Years were bad enough, but this iteration of the GOP began with the Tea Party
@realDonaldTrump Yes sir...nothing says, “I’m sorry for discarding our most loyal ally in favor of autocrats” like a golf course
@chrislhayes Do the CPAC attendees get a copy of Mein Kampf in their tote bags?
@CNN I wouldn’t question someone’s loyalty, but I agree that the US is too pro Israel. Looking back on the history of the relationship, Israel has gotten far more from the alliance than have we. I am in no way speaking in terms of religious beliefs...only the secular Israeli govt.
@zaptrapped I think that we can safely say that the era of American Exceptionalism has ended. I will voice an opinion that may not be popular...a very large percentage of this nation is simply too stupid to vote. Half of the voting public can’t name the 3 branches of govt. or the VP.
@GOVTWINE He cheats on a Nobel Prize nomination (which I didn’t even know was possible) and we are just supposed to trust him on his tax returns?

@JoyceWhiteVance Sadly, I believe the odds of Republicans turning on this President are about as likely as you cheering for Auburn!
@nytimes And then pioneered the greatest Presidential Summit flop in American history.
@DetroitLove88 @SashaMinsk1 While I take your point, I believe that Donald Trump &amp; the GOP has sunk to this point gradually...the Congressional elections of ‘94, furthered by the Bush years, &amp; most recently unhinged by the tea party &amp; the “Freedom Caucus.” The upward wealth distribution began with Reagan
@cnalive As a devout Catholic, I say lock them all up. While a single incident is intolerable, the number of victims has fallen by 40% since 1980, &amp; the incidence rate of 4% among clergy is lower than that of Protestant ministers, teachers, or the public.
@RedTRaccoon @zaptrapped He knows that. I think that Ole Man McConnell was around when NC ratified the constitution

@JoyceWhiteVance I haven’t seen evidence that the case has fallen apart
@essenviews Marie Antoinette reincarnated
@joncoopertweets I don’t necessarily disagree, but our framers never intended political factions or the tyranny of the minority on display in the Senate. There was great debate among the framers over the topic of impeachment, but they could never envisioned Congress completely abdicating its role
@sissyroxx There was true American exceptionalism during a post world period in which we rebuilt Europe, fought Communism, generated more than 60% of world GNP, shrunk the disparity of US wealth, made incredible scientific advances, &amp; went to the moon. Today, that phrase is only propaganda!
@MalcolmNance &amp; yet he constantly boasts about the renewed power of the US military. It is ironic that the last time that the US took such a laissez faire attitude regarding Korea, a war broke out &amp; the US was so Ill prepared that nearly ended with the annihilation of the Allied forces
@NathanLerner &amp; he has inspirational ability of the likes of Obama, Reagan, &amp; Bobby Kennedy!
@sissyroxx You tell them, Italy! It must really give the still-living WWII vets a special sense of pride to see that so much American (&amp; Allied) blood was shed to fight an ideology that is now resurgent in their lifetime...in large part championed by the US president &amp; his party!
@GaijinGoombah @MattGertz Oh, I would bet that no citizen of any nation believes him to be the leader of the free world!
@Elle_Kennedy @MattGertz Pick any statistic other than defense spending &amp; you will see that we have a nationwide problem in every area...including our beloved freedom in which we were judged to be the mere 15th freest nation on Earth.

@vardmin @MattGertz Oh, let’s not sell him short. He has found time during his 4 hour workdays to befriend the Filipino autocrat Duerte, Turkey’s Erdogan, and now Brazil’s fascist president Bolsonaro.
@MattGertz The most truly pathetic aspect of this statement is that he truly means it
@realDonaldTrump I believe that Chamberlin made a similar comment about Hitler after his complete appeasement over Czechoslovakia...yet he managed to disgrace himself without making a statement supporting a brutal dictator that murdered a US citizen!
@senatemajldr Wow, I respect your words. Now, however, is the time for you to lead your Caucus to finally rid this nation’s shame. I am no fan of Mike Pence, but I don’t believe that he will continue to make friends of Autocrats &amp; butchers
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I make it a habit to refrain from fascism while watching tv.
@Pontifex The Gospels recount Christ’s similar statement. While I agree that priests who molest children should be prosecuted like any other suspected, the selected outrage is disgusting. Hundreds of Protestant ministers were accused of this very thing 2 DAYS AGO, yet the media is silent

@realDonaldTrump Discredited Cohen? While he is no angel, I believe that the reported number of lies is over 8,000! Moreover, once a team of forensic accountants is up your a**, your lies &amp; frauds will make Cohen seem like a boy scout by comparison
@MSNBC @JoeNBC This latest betrayal of our nation’s citizens...Trump’s declaration that Kim Jong-un was unaware of the brutal beating/murder of Otto Warmbier is the single most disgusting statement by a President in my lifetime. Still more disgusting is the silence of the Republicans. Cowards!
@sissyroxx You see...the life of an ex-pat is the one to live! The people at my last company nearly fired me because my best friend’s uncle happened to see me with our CFO &amp; COO &amp; thought it amusing to send a round of Jameson to our table. They really got mad when I drank mine!
@sissyroxx No kidding...Montana. To your point, we have been destabilizing nearly every Central &amp; South American govt. at one time or another for 100 years
@sissyroxx No kidding. These people were living on some Islands off Panama, &amp; they were living the dream. They bought their own tiny island. Sadly, they were murdered by another expat from Montana
I could go on and on. The point is that we can’t leave decisions about our government to those who know nothing about our government. We have to educate &amp; turn out the vote! For those who wonder why Trump maintains his base...they are found on the wrong side of the data above!
9) During it’s hey-day, over 90% could name all three American Idol judges, but less than 20% could name a single Supreme Court Justice.                              10) 55% could not name the nation that we defeated in the American Revolution.
7) Even after the 9/11 Commission had stated publicly that Saddam Hussein had provided no support to Al Qaeda, 1/2 still insisted he had; 	8)Only 25% can name more than 1 of the 5 freedoms guaranteed by the 1st Amendment but &gt;than 50% can name two members of the Simpson family.
5) Most believe that the 9/11 terrorists came from poverty or were neglected as children despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary;	6) A generation ago presidential speeches were pitched at the level of twelfth graders. Today they are pitched at the level of seventh graders;
2)&lt; 1/2 of us know which nation dropped the atomic bomb;	3) Only one-third know that the Congress, not the President, declares war;	4) Only 30% know that members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and only 25% of us know that Senators serve six-year terms;
vote...perhaps after hearing these stats you will agree. In his book, “Just how Stupid are we: Facing the Truth about the American Voter,” Richard Shenkman finds deeply troubling data:	1) Only two out of five of us can identify the three branches of government
the Dunning Kruger effect stem from this ignorance. As a result, we find ourselves not as slaves to the tyranny of the majority (as Madison feared), but prisoners of the tyranny of the minority (which our founders never conceived). They never intended for the ordinary citizen to

McConnell’s re-elect is a perfect example. This ignorance is reinforced by Fox News...&amp; we’re off to the races!
@NicolleDWallace Let’s apply the “rational human” standard to Cohen &amp; his testimony. While he lied to Congress, he did so for Trump. SDNY has endorsed major parts of his testimony. The truth is now his only rational act. Telling it could reduce his term while lying exposes him to more charges

@USCatholic Why is nobody calling out the anti-Catholicism bigotry of Sens Hirono, Harris, Feinstein, &amp; Durban (himself nominally a Catholic). I was a law student of now Judge Amy Barrett...whose religion Feinstein viscously attacked. Read Jan 4 WSJ &amp; transcripts of hearings
@SenKamalaHarris Are you sure...these kids are Catholic...and we know your bigotry in that area
@TheLastWord I had the greatest respect for Sen Harris, but her hypocrisy is on full display. She has openly attacked Catholicism, so while she may very well be right in her assessment of Trump’s racism...her on-the-record bigotry directed at Catholics makes them equally hateful!

@gaijingirl2004 You are so right. I was a law student of Judge Barrett (Feinstein’s target). She emphasized the need to place one’s oath of office over any religion. She even wrote that in the highly rare event that a judge’s Catholicism couldn’t let them render impartiality, they must recuse!
@sissyroxx I hope you don’t have that horribble socialized vet medicine that will turn Italy into Venezuela
@gaijingirl2004 Dem Sens Hirono, HRris, Feinstein, &amp; Durbin slandered the Catholicism of judicicial nominees. I didn’t want one of the nominees confirmed, either, but not because of their religion. Tulsi Gabbard took on her fellow Dems &amp; defended their Catholicism!

@ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @Abhinary @CardinalDolan @nypost The Mormon Church here in the U.S. is worth more than the global Catholic Church. Catholic Hospital Networks,again, take in far less than Baptist &amp; Methodist. Unless you mean St. Jude, which has made exponential leaps in fighting childhood cancer &amp; doesn’t charge a $!
@Abhinary @ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @CardinalDolan @nypost Which is why we still have over 1.2B members. Do you really expect the Catholic Church, the Church founded by Christ himself to announce its support for abortion tomorrow. What it doesn’t do is hate-anyone. It expresses love &amp; compassion even for those who aren’t Catholic
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 No, I’m well aware that this is a shithole
@ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @Abhinary @CardinalDolan @nypost You are the reason that the Democratic Party is hemorrhaging Catholics. In your hateful, small minded view, women of faith, who, by every other standard would be a Democrat, are not welcome because of your small minded bigotry
@ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @Abhinary @CardinalDolan @nypost Mind boggling evil? So the Pope is  Hitler? I won’t even dignify your cult member comment. Pick up a book, &amp; you’d know that the Church created the separation of Church &amp; State, first suggested the Big Bang theory, &amp; countless other cultural &amp; scientific advancements in the world
@ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @Abhinary @CardinalDolan @nypost While I believe that a a single case of abuse is despicable, the rate of incidence in the Cathiv Church is far lower than in the general population or in popular churches. Do you hate all religions, or just Catholics?
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 This is why I have to get the hell out of here
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 That doesn’t seem democratic
@ngmcclernan @Lollardfish @Abhinary @CardinalDolan @nypost The last time that I read the tax code, the IRS doesn’t have the authority to tax foreign nations. The parishes in this country have to spend countless time raising money. There is no mandatory tything (unlike Mormon &amp; most evangelical churches). Bigots like you wouldn’t know.

@JksKathryn @NewParisite @NancyRog11 @JonClem310 @TulsiGabbard @nikoCSFB @ggreenwald @nbc Also, the KOC is only the latest incident. I was a law student of Amy Barrett. She is a devout Catholic who always stressed the wall between church &amp; state..&amp; said in the rarest case if your morals become an issue, you MUST recuse. Sen Feinstein slandered her Catholicism
@JksKathryn @NewParisite @NancyRog11 @JonClem310 @TulsiGabbard @nikoCSFB @ggreenwald @nbc That is becoming my issue with the party. If a practicing Catholic happens to be a Democrat and pro life, is that horrible? Those I know nor I want to impose our religious views on others...we just don’t want others shoved down our throats.
@JksKathryn @NewParisite @NancyRog11 @JonClem310 @TulsiGabbard @nikoCSFB @ggreenwald @nbc BS-Harris &amp; Hirono used the KOC as a proxy for the Church. They raise $ for charity &amp; drink beer but were made out to sound like NAZIs. I was a student of law professor Barrett whose religion Sen Feinstein slandered. Are you Catholic &amp; do you know our recent treatment by Dems?
@JksKathryn @NewParisite @NancyRog11 @JonClem310 @TulsiGabbard @nikoCSFB @ggreenwald @nbc I know, but the attacks on the KOC were ludicrous. Most members that I know are pro choice. They raise $ for charity &amp; drink beer, but Harris &amp; Hirono made them sound like Nazis. That was the point...they used the KOC as a proxy for the Church because they couldn’t attack it.
@NewParisite @JksKathryn @NancyRog11 @JonClem310 @TulsiGabbard @nikoCSFB @ggreenwald @nbc She isn’t Catholic. I don’t expect nor want to impose my Catholicism on the government. That was the point. Sens. Harris, Hirono, &amp; Feinstein said that Catholics were the only religion that couldn’t impartially apply their oath of office

@DaveStansberry @CoryBooker @StanfordFball @TulsiGabbard @tulsigabbard is the one Democrat to stand up for Catholic Democrat’s...so she is solid in my book
@CoryBooker @StanfordFball I am a liberal Catholic who was a student of Professor Barrett-Comey. She always stressed the importance of separating one’s personal views from their oath of office...and the imperative to recuse if your moral view wouldn’t allow it. She should have been a Justice you wanted!

@AngryandAsian @SashaMinsk1 Again, he rolls into the oval at 11, reads nothing, takes 1 meeting, a 1 hour lunch, &amp; is out by 4. He visits the troops &amp; is more tan than soldiers in the desert. Most presidents age 20 years in office. He looks like he lives in a health spa’

@GOPLeader While I agree, let’s talk about the pot calling the kettle!
@SRuhle @WhiteHouse Probably, “you were right...we didn’t need to waste $200,000 when I could have just as easily shoveled the cow shit”
@TheDemCoalition @jwlarrabee Has anyone even kept count of the number of active criminal investigation active, now?
@JuddApatow @AngelaRaeBoon1 Somebody told him about airplanes
@nytimes Good on her
@trishmc1958 @pvdork @socflyny @davidenrich @realDonaldTrump @DeutscheBank @JesseDrucker @benprotess Sadly, like Alito &amp; Thomas. Kavanaugh has shown himself to be a ideologue. Roberts,however, has emerged as more of a Kennedy.
@CNNSotu @jaketapper @TerryMcAuliffe @GovernorVA Then let’s call out all bigotry-https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@Mimirocah1 The judge will almost certainly slap a gag order...and Mueller can use anything he managed to slip around the gag order against him. Plus, I can’t imagaine that Mueller didn’t presume the behavior, which means that a) he has a solid case, &amp; b) he’s giving him rope to hang himself

@thebling_vote @AssangeMrs Sealed indictments are an everyday part of US Jurisprudence. He is no victim. He timed the release of materials to circumvent the democratic process. Russia’s govt. is one of the world’s most corrupt &amp; yet he never writes dissent.He is a coward &amp; foreign agent!
@katelovesthe80s Fortunately, he can’t abolish the 1st amendment

@tkaz99 Narcissists rarely grasp nuances beyond their own glorification
@TamBrewer1 @markcurtis30 @PrimeMinisterUK @georgegalloway @wikileaks Perhaps because there is a big difference between acting as a journalist &amp; acting as an agent of a hostile nation. Russias’s govt. is among the most corrupt in the world. The number of anti Putin stories published by Assange-0. He is not a journalist. He is an agent of Russia
@julia_doughty Buffett is the one billionaire who carries an economic populist message. As for the rest, fuck them!
@AynRandPaulRyan Fuck both teams..the Rams don’t even deserve to be playing in this game. How bad of a call does it have to be to make the NFL consider instant replay for non-calls
@kittypurrzog I agree, but we also need to call out our own bogotry- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ

@ParryPierce Hey Granny! Don’t worry...this is why we have subpoenas!
@gaelbill @HillaryClinton Did you not read any of the four American news stories that I included? I can include about a dozen more. Despite her hatred, I still held my nose &amp; voted for her. But democrats love to call out bigotry. I am just being honest
@NPR @KathyLeone12 If only they had swept the fires
@JRubinBlogger I agree...&amp; also move out Kamala Harris. Bigotry is bigotry- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@NewYorkGOP @AOC @MaxRose4NY @DelgadoforNY19 @ABrindisiNY The majority of Americans do NOT the wall, &amp; an overwhelming majority oppose a shutdown or emergency declaration to get it. PS-Stop squealing like my 6 year old niece over a 29 year old freshman member of Congress! If her ideas were radical, they wouldn’t be so popular!
@davidhogg111 @Koboxer2380 It couldn’t be the fact that he rolls into the oval at 11, reads nothing, takes 1 meeting, a 1 hr lunch, &amp; rolls out by 4. Other presidents age 20 years in office. Trump looks like he lives in a health spa.
@timkaine I agree, Sen- but let’s call out all bigotry - https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@NikkiHaley So do the people of this nation...you are forever tied to him
@gaelbill @HillaryClinton I can give you as many as you want. Btw, I sucked it up &amp; voted for her in 2016. That doesn’t give her license to bash my faith

@ReadHollyWood @captassrack I was never a scout, but I went to all male schools from 1-12th grade. Is it terrible to have a separate Boy Scouts &amp; Girl Scouts? Not trying to pick fight...just asking.
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Thanks! I apparently scared the kids so bad that we had to sail around St. Simons &amp; back instead. So I saw no ghosts👻
@robreiner @LisaKeel9 Let’s also call out Harris’ anti Catholic hatred- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@robreiner @LisaKeel9 https://t.co/MdSp8L6gEF
@robreiner @LisaKeel9 I agree, but let’s be honest &amp; call out the Democratic Party for its bigotry towards Catholics...also a Klan target - https://t.co/CjG9HwipIx
@JamilSmith @AOC Agreed, but let the party also recognize its bigotry toward Catholics: another Klan target-  https://t.co/MdSp8L6gEF
@jlasher @CatholicNewsSvc @USCCB The Church has always taken a pro life stance. As a Catholic, I have no wish to legislate my beliefs on others. I will give the Church credit for their non-hypocrisy: they are pro life in all cases, anti death penalty in all cases, &amp; vallue human life while alive in all cases
RT @leahmcelrath: So, anyway, the Trump admin admits it stripped THOUSANDS more brown children away from their families than it previously…
@WMCActionNews5 I’d concentrate more on fighting the annexation by Mississippi
@liberalgoddess Far more than half of US inmates are non-violent offenders. We lock up more citizens per capita than int nation in the world...gotta love the land of the free!
@PamKeithFL @MonicaMonicawt1 Absolutely! This abuse of executive power to circumvent the legislature is exactly the scenario for which Madison &amp; Co threw in the impeachment clause. Any Republican who dissents is a coward!

@AngelaRaeBoon1 @SRuhle I was being sarcastic
@AOC He should go, but this party of “inclusion” should also call out its anti Catholic bigotry - https://t.co/fwyNRwBmzs
@realDonaldTrump Much like losing the popular vote by 3M
@davidaxelrod He should go, but so should any Democrat who has shown blatant anti Catholic bigotry - https://t.co/fwyNRwjLaS
@realDonaldTrump Why, I would think you would love his actions
@Eugene_Robinson I agree. But the Democratic Party needs to admit all of its bigotry- https://t.co/fwyNRwBmzs
@DonaldJTrumpJr No, they become president
@KFILE @jaketapper It’s time for the Democratic Party to admit all of its bigotries https://t.co/MdSp8L6gEF

@studentactivism @NancyRog11 Let’s call out this racism, but let’s also call out the bigotry within the Democratic Party towards Catholics https://t.co/MdSp8LnRwd
@kicranston @dsam4a The biggest mystery in politics is why people freely vote against their self interest
@sissyroxx So I was a bit defensive about my sister yesterday. I would give my life for all of my siblings, but she &amp; I share a bond. When Colleen was killed, she was with me 24/7.she led me back to the light!
@kicranston @dsam4a Nobody talks about the multiple weeks or months that you have to spend at a clinic like Mayo or Anderson...and hotel rooms are $300/night...or the multiple airfares that you must pay...or the meals that must be paid for...it is ridiculous
@NathanLerner Run, Beto!
@dsam4a @kicranston Even with insurance, a catastrophic illness can bankrupt you!
@MalcolmNance Malcom, you are the man!
@sissyroxx The worst part is that, while she wasn’t totally innocent, this asshole slipped Molly into her drink. Then he pressured her to get an abortion, then slut shamed her. Then I beat the shit out of him!
@sissyroxx I don’t know what that is, but the ocean is exilerating
@sissyroxx It was a good thing that we fought golden gloves when we were young! He was crying like a baby
@OMGno2trump @JohnHoward333 &amp; that’s only 2 years
@sissyroxx You could be a Russian plant!😀
@sissyroxx Then you are a lucky woman, &amp; he sounds like a great guy (slightly better if he were Irish😊). The only fist fight that I have ever been in was my beating of Alex’s biological father. He just walked away from my sister &amp; slandered her name. If that makes me Patrriarchial..sorry🙄
@sissyroxx I like to think that is the type of marriage &amp; family Colleen &amp; I would have had. As much as I joke, I miss her everyday! You really better not be a bot😊
@sissyroxx The real hero of this story is my brother in law, Jack. It was never even a question for him. Alex is his son, &amp; they share a special bond. He puts my sister &amp; the kids before everything!
@Jennybing53 @ewarren @ChrisSteeleUSNA We can impose a higher wealth tax each year, raise $trillions, &amp; the wealthy’s wealth will just grow at a slower rate. The top 0.01% now own 90% of the wealth. In the 50s, the wealthy, middle, &amp; working class each owned 30%. This isn’t a radical idea. It was in practice until ‘80
@ActionNetworkHQ @The_Oddsmaker The real model should include the Saints!
@mattmfm @NancyRog11 I agree. However, Dems must rid the party of their own bigotry! https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@CNBC She hates Catholics! Is that somehow a foreign plot? Check any major news source!
@CNBC Can we speak of her bigotry &amp; hatred of Catholics? https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@BethLynch2020 @NancyRog11 And more! And she wants to be president? https://t.co/V1FP6qdBQQ
@BethLynch2020 @NancyRog11 Still a bigot! https://t.co/0t3tsI1BLr
@BethLynch2020 @NancyRog11 And a bigot! https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@JennElizabethJ @kicranston @chrislhayes @RalphNortham So while Democrats are rightly calling out this hatred, let them also call out the hatred that exists within it for Catholics...another Klan target. Bigotry is bigotry! https://t.co/fwyNRwBmzs
@davidhogg111 @ChrisSteeleUSNA @RickSantorum @Maria_Butina The Pope should definitely excommunicate his dumb ass!
@CharlesPPierce @NancyRog11 Well, the confederate battle flag still flies in the state’s upper left corner, and the state only ratified the 13th amendment banning slavery about 10 years ago. If we are going to build a wall, let’s wall off Mississippi!
@joncoopertweets If wishes were horses, brother!
@KUTV2News I don’t remember the name now, but the best beer that I have ever had was micro brewed in Utah. Wasatch perhaps?
@AynRandPaulRyan I agree...and Sens Harris, Hirono, Feinstein, &amp; Durbin (himself Catholic), all of whom I greatly respected, have shown just as much hate &amp; bigotry https://t.co/fwyNRwBmzs
@JoeBiden @liberalgoddess Again, no hypocrisy! https://t.co/MdSp8L6gEF
@JoeBiden @liberalgoddess I agree, but I also think that you of all people should call out the Democratic Party for hating Catholics...another Klan target! https://t.co/fwyNRwBmzs
@ewarren @ChrisSteeleUSNA I think that the tax is too low, Senator. We both know that the average annual return is ~11-12%. A five percent tax would still grow their wealth
RT @ewarren: This year the wealthiest top 0.1% in America are projected to owe 3.2% of their wealth in taxes. The bottom 99% are projected…
RT @coleyworld: @GOP Trump’s been in office for 24 of that 100 months.  Which means 76 of those were on Obama’s watch.  But don’t let those…

@cpw_Numenor I enjoy Buffalo!
@adamslily And why is Harris a hypocrite &amp; bigot that hates one of the same groups targeted by the Klan? https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@AngelaRaeBoon1 @SRuhle I try to watch his scripted speeches, &amp; it is as if it triggers a coma. I just hear Charlie Brown’s parents!
@KPNatsFan I had so much respect for Jack. On the plus side, Tiger might throw one of his tantrums &amp; brain Donny w/ his putter
@AngelaRaeBoon1 @SRuhle Oh, I’m sure that’s on the prompter for the SOTU speech!
@Jennybing53 @Resist_TheClown You are one of the few that I have found who appreciates her as much as I do. She has the most brilliant mind of all of them
@BarbaraBoxer While I completely agree, let’s drop the hypocrisy &amp; call out other Dems who hate Catholics (also Klan targets) Sens Harris &amp; Hirono have since joined the bandwagon. https://t.co/MdSp8L6gEF
@Jennybing53 @Resist_TheClown Ok...then I choose Elizabeth Warren

@WestWingReport @ChuckGrassley What kind of fucked up state keeps re-electing this A-hole &amp; Steve King?
@KamalaHarris I hope that she isn’t Catholic
@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx Ok, Doc, how did you manage to get over 10K followers? I have been at this for 2 weeks &amp; have ~120. At this rate, I’ll catch up somewhere around retirement!
@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx Now my nieces are terrified that we are going to see ghosts on our sail👻
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Well, there are occasions in which a court is forced to make a medical decision when a patient isn’t competent, medical proxy forms are ambiguous, etc. Also, it is within its rights to require certain vaccinations
family that took care of the child while she was in college. Then she met an amazing guy who adopted Alex after they married. None of us could imagine our lives w/out Alex. I know that isn’t the typical story, but I am sentimental enough to wish it were
@sissyroxx I’m going to let you in on some family dirty laundry. My sister became pregnant at 17. SHE made the choice to keep it. She never considered another alternative. Granted, I fully understand that her choice was made MUCH easier given that she had a loving &amp; supportive
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Well, I am not a member of the Patriarchy!😊 I’m just a guy wanting to do right by everyone!
@KassandraSeven You’ve met my mother?
@NBCInvestigates @KenDilanianNBC @rwindrem @bpopken At least she had the guts to defend Catholicism when senators of her party of “inclusion” have been slandering it for years! Bigotry is bigotry!
@GeraldFSeib @davidaxelrod I was just a kid, but remember it clearly! Godspeed!
@JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Can we get a psychological exam thrown in?
@cpw_Numenor It should get him impeached. It will be the grossest violation of executive powers in US history. The framers didn’t include emergency powers as a method to circumvent the legislative process or to address an event that you can circle on a calendar!
RT @The_UnSilent_: I’ve met some dumb people in my day, I’m mean some REAL FUCKING MORONS. Not one of them were as stupid as this asshole…
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 In adults, yes...in newborns...not so much.
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I still believe that my grandparent’s house in Savannah is haunted...&amp; I went out of my way to make sure my younger siblings did!
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I agree with you on chemical castration, but what parent in their right mind (or doctor or hospital legal staff) would subject a newborn to a vasectomy? No procedure is 100% safe.
@RepJerryNadler While I agree, let’s not be hypocrites- Mamala Harris hates Catholics...as does the Klan- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@HowardA_Esq Only if we wall off Mississippi
@ron_fournier @kasie Then we need to call out Kamala Harris’ bigotry- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@jimmy_dore @NancyRog11 Or perhaps just for more Catholics- https://t.co/5ARS8kHmkJ
@soledadobrien @joncoopertweets As a Democrat, I am sickened by this photo. But I don’t want to hear one word from an anti-Catholic bigoted critic like Kamala Harris, who espouses the same attitude toward my religion as the Klan! https://t.co/DsIZGjOMRx
@psychdr100 @BexitWesty It’s amazing how someone who has been as politically relevant as my grandmother for over a decade can still find so many ways to publicly make himself an ass
@AngryandAsian @SashaMinsk1 @TomiLahren @AOC I think the Fox photo...which looks like a Himmler family reunion pic...says it all
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Well, what can we do to speed up the process? Carry Rosary beads, Crucifixes, etc? I watch Supernatural. Should we bring in salt, iron, etc?
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 We are definitely going to sail out to that Island today if anyone in my family ever wakes up. I think that he was stuck for at least a decade. You can’t learn to ice sculpt or become a piano virtuoso in a few weeks
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Question that I ask everyone...in the movie, “Groundhog Day,” how long do you think that Bill Murray was stuck there?
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I’ll need to hear more about these angry spirits. Were they angry at you or just pissed in general. Whenever I take someone to Savannah for the 1st time, we go on the haunted pub tour!
@EWTN While I am Democrat, how can the party honestly in good faith rip the governor of Virginia for appearing in a Klan photo while displaying Klan-like, anti Catholic comments by Sens Harris, Hirono, Feinstein, &amp; Durbin?
@cnalive Why is nobody calling out Kamala Harris for her recent anti-Catholic slander? You can throw in those by Hirono, Feinstein, &amp; Durbin...but only she is running for President. Just google the remarks
@RebelScumPixie Maybe that is why I was suspended for 12 hours a few days ago
@JohhnyBowser @DraftKings That would be a cogent argument if there should even had been an OT...which we all know is absolutely not. At least own your luck
@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx Yes, she’s a pseudo ex-pat whose wit &amp; intelligence that I have found rare on here😊☘️

@RebelScumPixie @AryaResists @IMontoyaResists @KamalaHarris @amyklobuchar @PeteButtigieg @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @JulianCastro For all her negative press, Tulsi Gabbard was the only Democrat to call them out. She has my vote https://t.co/DsIZGjOMRx
@RebelScumPixie @AryaResists @IMontoyaResists @KamalaHarris @amyklobuchar @PeteButtigieg @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @JulianCastro And if you aren’t aware of the Knights of Columbus, they are a Catholic philanthropic group that has fought the Klan, racism, &amp; fascism. These Sens used them as a proxy for Catholicism...the faith of the largest # of Americans to give their life for this country
@RebelScumPixie @AryaResists @IMontoyaResists @KamalaHarris @amyklobuchar @PeteButtigieg @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @JulianCastro Is that enough? Please don’t defend their actions as questioning their beliefs on abortion. That can be done w/out slandering one’s faith. This is about the party of “inclusion” saying that all but 1 faith can uphold their oath of office...the BS JFK had to overcome 60 years ago

@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx Oh yeah! I apologize! I have only been doing this Twitter thing for a week or two! She is my best Twitter friend, &amp; we bust each other’s chops. I am 3/4 through the book, &amp; I would like to have a serious convo with you...about both points with which I agree &amp; those I don’t
@realDonaldTrump At a Port of Entry, asshole!
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Tomato Potato...the two are distinctly different! Plus I can’t drink because I am going to fly later!
@Cluelesscomedy3 @historylvrsclub You know what...you are right. My brain is scrambled &amp; saw the #21...and knew the 21st amendment ended prohibition. My bad!
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Ouch...let’s not make this personal...and I’m an Irish Whiskey man...not Scotch
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 And this book doesn’t leave much room for error. I’m sure that I’m guilty of something
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I am not sure. After learning how Herod’s murder of first born sons was less cruel than it was patriarchy tyranny, I’ve basically lost consciousness

@ProudResister Aren’t these the same assholes that used to accuse Democrats of being weak on Russia. I guess that, both domestically &amp; internationally, Republicans are pussies
@historylvrsclub @Cluelesscomedy3 They’re probably flinging snowballs because booze was re-legalized that year
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I don’t give a damn what this says about me, I will always protect my nieces &amp; sister with my life...I would for any family member or friend, but my nieces &amp; I share a bond that, while I thought was special, now makes me feel like a villain after reading this book!
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Damn it. I need to find a Catholic girl with a walkabout soul who will embrace leaving everything to be an ex-pat? Am I being too picky?
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Is your sister married?😊
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 Ironic, because, while I was a cradle Catholic, I became agnostic for years. My journey back to the Church is a story in its own right, but started one night at a rectory with a priest, a bottle of bourbon, &amp; a fascinating discussion on Pascal’s Wager!
@sissyroxx @birdgirl1001 I’m reading this &amp; feeling as if I should turn myself into the police!

@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx Ok...bought it. Am I going to hate myself after reading it?😊
@birdgirl1001 @sissyroxx I’ll be happy to read it. The Catholic Church will never allow female priests. They don’t see that as bigotry. Christ &amp; his apostles were men &amp; the Church won’t change dogma. However, we’re constantly attacked for our reverence to the Virgin Mary. We view her as the perfect human
@NYinLA2121 @Koboxer2380 I laugh when these big tough Republicans cower like little girls before a 29 year old, freshman Congresswoman

@MalcolmNance I don’t drink coffee, but Starbucks has closed down every mom &amp; pop coffee shop in the neighborhood &amp; has apparently quadrupled the price of a cup of coffee. I’ve never spent $1 at Starbucks, but this guy’s penchant for f’ing things up is in his DNA

@Sarah_SKG_1983 1st: BS on white, Christian victimhood. 2nd, Catholicism isn’t represented by a few stupid kids. Catholicism differs greatly from the “Christianity” to which he refers because it teaches that faith alone is not enough: faith must inspire works of kindness &amp; love towards others

@NomikiKonst @NancyRog11 We should increase marginal tax rates, tax net wealth, &amp; impose a huge inheritance tax. The avg. return on the market is 12%; the economy roared under a 91% tax rate in the 1950s, &amp; parents should be allowed to leave their kids a good start in life: not hundreds of millions
@MeghanMcCain Adopt an all encompassing, non-hypocritical pro life position in which you oppose capital punishment &amp; we can talk. Why do conservatives care so much about people before they are born &amp;, in most cases, after they die &amp; yet allow them to live in abject poverty while alive?

The center’s been dragged so far right that you, a billionaire, bitch about paying a 2% wealth tax when it grows by far more than 2% per year
@MSNBC Why? By your argument, Germans had an obligation to support Hitler. Besides, the people didn’t elect him...the Electoral College did. Losing by 3M votes hardly gives one a mandate

@AOC His fight should be with Warren. Her wealth tax will annoy him more. She is proposing a 2% tax on wealth over $1B. The average annual return on the market is ~12%. Forgive me if I don’t cry for a man who pays $2M &amp; still has $998M left (w/out his capital gains)
@sissyroxx @ItsMeCathi @afireinmyveins @HowardSchultz When I’m an ex-pat, I’ll never think about this shithole again. To have our president conspiring against the U.S. is bad, but I won’t live in a nation in which the Saints could be robbed of the Super Bowl by what NFL analysts alreasy say is the 4th worst call in NFL history!
@maddow It takes real skill to use the bully pulpit to turn the nation against you on one of your party’s bedrock issue &amp;, after a 24/7 attack against brown people, invert your support numbers on this issue by 18 points
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump He won’t do it. To your point, there isn’t a court in the US that would allow it. Perhaps more importantly, fewer than 30% of Republicans support an emergency declaration. If he wants an impeachment fight, abuse of executive power will do the trick

@shannoneffects1 @RNRTennessee Ok, my fellow Memphis...what is my problem?
@complainster @metaquest @emzorbit So much for Trump’s, “I should be paying more taxes” BS. The single greatest lies sold to the public over the past 40 years are  that trickle down economics is sound policy &amp; that upward wealth redistribution is fine, but broad redistribution would make us Socialists!
@DonnaGCee @MsLonesomeBlues @BigRedSepulveda @funder The issue here is that GOP office holders. Those people can’t stand Russians...they just believe this president’s innocence w/out question. Once he is gone, Russia will once again be seen by all Americans as the enemy that it is
@ParryPierce @tedlieu Perhaps. Congress (even Republicans) are furious.  Sadly, they only had enough Republic members to gather 58 votes. However, the House is going to hold investigations. That could change minds
@shannoneffects1 @RNRTennessee And what problem do I have?😊
@CarthyNb It’s actually only 0.1%, but it would generate ~ $3T in 5 years. I would actually raise the tax. When you average a 12% gain/year, a 2% tax seems small. I would actually index the tax (with a minimum floor) to the market return. We also need to reinstate the inheritance tax
@metaquest @emzorbit Each of those is sad, but people should be really worried about the Caterpillar $200M hit. Caterpillar is a leading indicator of the general economic performance. 3 days ago it had its biggest earnings miss in a decade, and were lower than market forecasts. YOY rev. was off 4%
@RWPUSA @HillaryClinton @alfranken @KamalaHarris I agree with you about everyone but Harris. She publicly made horrifically slanderous comments about Catholicism. Three other Democratic Senators, but she is running for president. I was a big supporter of hers prior to these comments, but bigotry is bigotry
Over the past 40 years, we have become socialized into believing that the upward distribution of wealth is economically sound and a part of the American ethos. Forgive me if I am not going to cry for a person worth $1B has to pay an annual tax of $2M.
When Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax manages to unite Bloomberg &amp; Eric Trump, she has the right idea. The avg. annual return on the market is~12%. So to hear billionaires cry about paying a 2% wealth tax is laughable. The top 0.01% of the population owns 90% of the nation’s wealth
@NicolleDWallace @matthewamiller And yet he still catches &amp; indicts them. If I ever committed a crime, that man is the last person on earth that I would want after me
@benigma2017 @NancyRog11 I agree with all but Harris. She made patently slanderous comments about Catholicism. It is a shame. I used to greatly admire her. However, bigotry is bigotry.
@coleyworld This from people who support a president who somehow won the EC by 77,000 votes across 3 states. 60% of voters say that they will “definitely not” vote for him again. Nobody other than his base supports him, &amp; there is a 50/50 chance he doesn’t finish his term.
@cenkuygur Truer words...We hear more about Russia today than we did during the Cold War
@mkraju @MaddowBlog This isthe beginning of the end. Even the cowardly Republicans aren’t going to allow him to trash the intelligence community. He refuses to be briefed or to read...yet claims to know more about everything about everybody. He is truly endangering the institutions of our democracy
@ShelbyKStewart How low must your sense of self worth be to seek a job from a man who, on national tv, called you ugly...and accused your father in law of being involved in the JFK assassination?
@matthewjdowd @NancyRog11 Your tweet makes me think of the E.M. Forster quote, “If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country”. Obviously, I am not espousing treason, but the xenophobia that has taken hold of this nation.
@JamieLindsay @pvdork @paulkrugman I completely agree with you. I think that is what we are beginning to see. As baby boomers die off,  Gen Y, Millennials, &amp; Gen Z (all who have a much more selfless &amp; philanthropic view of the world) will begin to transform this society.
@67jewelCDH @finafyr I think that we are getting to the point that he will either resign or be convicted by the Senate. If he pardons his son in the face of overwhelming evidence, he’s done. I think that Republicans are getting sick of him!
@davidhogg111 @NancyRog11 Who in the hell seriously has a problem with a background check to buy a gun? You can’t get a job without a background check. People can’t wait a week to kill someone?

@ScottNGibbs @gaijingirl2004 @CNN @MSNBC Stress her support for religious beliefs. Harris standard Catholics visciously, &amp; she, while a Buddhist, defended the religion of a man that she (nor I) wanted on the bench. That is the very idea that our Founders envisioned.
@JamieLindsay @pvdork @paulkrugman I agree with you. However, it is starting to move leftward again. Young voters are overwhelmingly much farther to the left (&amp; politically engaged than previous younger voters) than their parents, &amp; minorities are voting in larger numbers. Change is coming
@RichardHaass @pvdork This is what is going to bring Trump down first. Republicans won’t tolerate his addled foreign policy. If this continues, Republican Senators will vote to convict if the House impeached. If he closes the govt.  again in 3 weeks, that will be his end.
@MsLonesomeBlues @BigRedSepulveda @funder They can’t delay forever. Ironically, it will be his attacks on his intelligence committee that bring him down first. Even Republicans won’t defend him attacking them...he’s becoming too much of a liability. He won’t finish his term
@JamieLindsay @pvdork @paulkrugman I started at Goldman Sachs. They are scared shitless by Warren. Her wealth tax rates aren’t high enough. Avg. return of stock market is 10-12%. Start with an initial 50% tax, &amp; then tax their wealth at 7 &amp; 9% annually. They can afford it, &amp; their wealth will still grow!
@JamieLindsay @pvdork @paulkrugman We need a constitutional amendment dealing with money in politics...ban paid lobbyists, directed donations, Corp. contributions, PAC money, a lifetime ban on ex members of Congress advocating legislation, &amp; more
@eshaLegal @gaijingirl2004 Does she hate Catholics, also?

Just watched Franklin Graham on Craig Melvern. It absolutely amazes me how a self proclaimed evangelical can lie and practice such hypocrisy! He belies his so called “faith” by constantly making excuses &amp; lying for political issues.
@USCCB Senator Harris, who announced her presidential candidacy, has recently made bigoted &amp; slanderous comments about our faith. Bigotry is bigotry! You should make a very public &amp; pointed condemnation of her hateful speech
@CatholicHerald While I ascribe to many of her policies, Senator Harris, a presidential candidate, has made bigoted &amp; slanderous comments on our faith. Why are you not speaking out?
@AliVelshi and I am an American born Catholic progressive. Regardless of my political leanings, Sen Harris has made slanderous comments and shown intolerance for Catholicism. Why does nobody call her on this bigotry? We only comprise 25% of the electorate. Bigotry is bigotry!
Senator Harris spoke of her faith this weekend, yet she slanders the largest religion in the nation. My once great respect has turned into yet another disappointment in her hypocrisy. Until she acknowledges her bigoted comments &amp; apologizes, she is simply another phony

of faith incapable of discharging the duties of an office. So do I find that teen’s actions deplorable? Of course. However, do I find the comments of these Senators &amp; their bigotry disgusting? Absolutely. I just wonder why their hate is tolerated &amp; ignored by the media.
Moreover, this bigoted practice spits on the constitution. Sen. Harris now wants to be President. As someone I used to respect, I now consider her to be just another bigot. You may agree with her &amp; the other Senators, but, if so, you believe that Catholics are the only people
that, had it been turned around on the Senator’s Judaism, would have caused an outrage. Senator Durbin has also made anti Catholic statements. These Senators’ defenders will say that they are protecting women’s’ rights. However, you can question a record w/out attacking a faith.

Sadly, Catholics are held to a different standard. When JFK made his famous speech 60 years ago in Houston to Protestant ministers, it was thought that the anti Catholic bias had finally been overcome. Sadly, however, the nation’s largest religion has produced 1 president in ~230

Official “doctrine” is that of the Catholic Church. As such, Sens Hirono &amp; Harris used the group as a proxy for Catholicism &amp; made slanderous accusations &amp; comments. Sen. Sasse, realizing the tactic, defended the nominee. As a result of defending the nation’s largest Christian

The sinister issue is the anti Catholic bigotry that continues to exist in our country. In the US Senate, during the same week that the shameful actions took place by the Covington teens, Sen. Hirono (who I once greatly respected), accused Sen. Ben Sasse of holding an alt right
I am a progressive. I am also Catholic. I have made my own peace reconciling my personal, “pro choice” views with the Church’s all encompassing pro life position. Still, I don’t believe that anyone who knows anything about Catholicism expects the Church to change its position.
Moreover, while this in no way absolves these students of their shameful actions, they were not the only group involved...nor even the instigators. Again, this absolves them of nothing. Still, in light of other events, I am left to wonder if something else is at play here.
While the Catholic Church’s pro life position is inviolate, I take serious issue with using teenagers to participate in political rally’s. With all of that said, I hope that everyone can agree that those issuing death threats in response is a much more malicious and hateful act.
Christian religion, teaches that faith alone is not enough to gain God’s Sanctifying Grace. One’s faith must inspire works of kindness, charity, love, etc. The young men in question clearly did not embrace their faith. MAGA hats are also not a part of the Catholic Faith.
The situation involving the recent altercation in Washington D.C. between the Covington Catholic High School students &amp; the Native American man is troubling for many reasons. First, I was appalled by the behavior of these young men. Catholicism, the world’s oldest &amp; original
@ava @gaelbill As a Catholic, I was repulsed by the actions of these teens. Catholicism teaches that, in order to receive Sanctifying Grace, faith is not, itself, enough. It must inspire works of kindness, mercy, love, etc towards others.
@ParryPierce What an A-hole he is. I think that Mueller May have included every single text, email, &amp; other document related to Wikileaks that Stone lies about making. Let’s see how tough he is now that he is staring down 7 felonies!

@sissyroxx @TeamPelosi @Pnwowl You have to admit that it waters down the notion of being an ex-pat if you’re still politically engaged. I would go bohemian Hemingway &amp; never look back!

@taniapdx @JanieOnPolitics @2020fight @shaunking I would also argue the opposite. The removal of immensely qualified clergy in the school has created this type of behavior. Not more than a decade ago, when I attended a similar school, they just beat the shit out of you until you were on your best behavior.
@taniapdx @JanieOnPolitics @2020fight @shaunking Sorry to just respond. The actions of these kids sicken me. However, in order to receive God’s sanctifying Grace, the faith of Catholics’ must also spawn acts of mercy &amp; kindness to others. I do,however, question the wisdom of sending these kids to a pro-life rally
@_alleyoops You really just won’t let it go. The amount of money paid has no correlation to the overall abuse rates within the Church, the general population, &amp;/or Protestant ministers. Have a good night!
@plantfano @arlenparsa @FluffyDoom Well, no system is perfect. Besides, if Brett truly practiced the actual Catholic Faith, he wouldn’t have ended up as such a prick
@_alleyoops Will it make you leave me alone if I say that I will stop attending Mass? Done. I’ll stop.
@_alleyoops Original...but given your enlightenment, you already know the stats &amp; results of multiple studies...while a single case is abominable, the incidence rate among Catholic clergy is less than 1/4th of that in gen pop &amp; 1/2 that of Protestant ministers. Have a good night
@sabrinacayne The Catholic Church as been the target of bigotry throughout this nation’s history. Those assholes aren’t Catholic. Those schools encourage vigorous competition academically &amp; athletically. In that setting, words don’t always cut it!
@_alleyoops And if you have problems with the Church, I suggest you do the same. I don’t see your tweet keeping me out of Mass tomorrow morning.
The Saints got screwed!
@sabrinacayne This is the problem. Many Catholic schools have “modernized” by replacing clergy with lay teachers, relaxing rules. My teachers would have beaten the shit out of those assholes so that they would be too afraid to pull that crap!
@_alleyoops There are far more racist, bigoted evangelicals that display that behavior regularly than the isolated actions of students who obviously don’t know the essence of Catholicism. I am shamed by their actions, but they were not taught that behavior by a Catholic institution
@gnwayland As a Catholic, I am far more disgusted by you at these actions. This, however, is not the fault of the Diocese. Catholicism not only teaches dignity &amp; respect for all life, but also teaches that faith must inspire acts of kindness, charity, &amp; love towards all. They disgraced me
@PepBelle This is what happens when the clergy are replaced with lay teachers. Had we acted even to a remote degree like those smug pricks, we would literally have had the shit beaten out of us...&amp; I am not speaking metaphorically!
@JanieOnPolitics @taniapdx @2020fight @shaunking What is needed is to bring the clergy back into the classrooms. They have the same credentials &amp; aren’t afraid to instill character by beating the shit out of punks like these.
I despise the actions of these assholes more than most, because the school is Catholic. True Catholicism teaches that faith must inspire works of mercy, charity, &amp; love to all. Catholic schools around the world teach this daily. These thugs shame us!#CovingtonCatholicHighSchool
@rifflerunnpool @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If he runs with the Koch Bros &amp; is in the Federalist Society, I am sure that he does hate Pope Francis. He may call himself Catholic &amp; even receive the Sacraments, but he has closed himself to God’s Grace. He isn’t the first &amp; won’t be the last to turn away from the true faith!
@Kenai61 @NoBayouBridge @supmikeclines This is the antithesis of Catholicism’s dogma that faith must also inspire acts of charity, mercy, &amp; love to all people. We should also put the clergy back into schools so that asswipes like these will get the shit beaten out of them
@pstevenson1961 This is what happens when you remove the clergy in favor of lay people. Men of the cloth, with the same degrees, aren’t afraid to beat the shit out of these types of assholes
@grantstern @OccupyDemocrats @RepDebHaaland Debating expulsion? They need to bring in the Jesuits and beat the living shit out of everyone of them!
@jaketapper I’d like to take this opportunity to thank those assholes for giving the Catholic Church an even worse reputation in this country. We believe that faith must produce acts of charity, kindness, &amp; love for all people. I guess you dickheads missed that part
@arlenparsa @FluffyDoom I don’t believe that is the problem, either. The problem didn’t lie in the race of the teachers so much as their abject failure to instill basic Catholic values. Also, had there been Clergy other than lay teachers, they would have literally beaten respect into them
@arlenparsa @FluffyDoom Had Jesuits, Christian Bothers, or another religious order actually ran the school, perpaps they would have taught true Catholic Dogma...and had the shit beaten out of them had they ever acted as they did yesterday!

As a Catholic, I support an iron clad wall between Church &amp; State. However, over this nation’s history, we have been singled out as being unable to separate our faith from our oath. JFK fought this bigotry 60 years ago, &amp; sadly, we still face such slanderous remarks!

@iHarry @cnni @CovCathColonels I am disgusted by the actions of these thugs. However, the notion that the Catholic Church espouses or teaches these beliefs is just as disgusting. Unlike other Xtians, we believe that our faith must inspire acts of kindness, mercy, &amp; love to fellow humans.
@inartic I personally know Amy Barrett. Feinstein attacked her faith for no reason. Amy wrote that any judge should recuse if a decision would pose a major moral conflict. Why, over the past 240 years, are Catholics the only ones who can’t separate their faith from their oath of office?
@JaySekulow It’s not so much all Christian judges as it is specifically Catholic ones. This bigotry runs deep in our nation’s blood. For some reason, many in the population can’t accept that a Catholic can separate their faith from their const. Duty. Kennedy faced this issue 60 years ago
@rifflerunnpool @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And if you made a point about which organization makes a personnunduly biased...it IS the Federalist Society (comprised of many faiths) &amp; not the Catholic Church. Our faith teaches that acts of kindness &amp; service to others is necessary to obtain Grace
@rifflerunnpool @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No, I happen to have gone to law school with Amy Barrett. She actually wrote that if her Catholicism ever truly conflicted with her oath, she would recuse. The issue here is the same old bigoted belief that Catholics alone can’t separate their faith from their oath of office
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I am a devout Catholic &amp; don’t want these judge’s confirmed. You can question a judge’s record w/out attacking their faith. In Amy Barrett’s case, she actually wrote that if she found herself morally at odds with her oath of office, she would recuse.
@frankstucker1 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump While I agree that any instance of sexual abuse is abominable, the incidence rate among Catholic clergy is &lt; 1/4th that of the population &amp; 1/2 that of Protestant ministers. The data is there. That issue has nothinh to do w/ slanderous comments on the nation’s largest religion
@maziehirono And yet you still offer no apology to Catlolics
@realDonaldTrump I understand that it is at 100% with the tooth fairy. Santa was prepared to give you high marks,also, until you tatted him out to the 7 year old!

@egrassva @pvdork As a Catholic, I am disgusted by the behavior of these students. Their actions stand in direct contradiction to Catholic dogma...which teaches that faith alone is not sufficient; that true faith must inspire acts of kindness, charity, tolerance &amp; love towards all.
@MSNBC I’m still confused that he hired a guy to cheat &amp; still finished fifth
@essenviews Hell yes. In an eight minute Oval Office address, he lied 6-7 times. Why give him a platform for propaganda
@psychdr100 @dc_tribune Trump probably has a bottle of holy water, a clove of garlic, and a wooden spike to hold over him. You can’t make it to 130 by taking vitamins
@BillKristol I agree, and while we’re at it, let’s call out Sens Hirono, Harris, Feinstein, &amp; Durbin for their flagrant anti Catholic slurs
@TheDemCoalition @IngrahamAngle @AOC Yeah, it’s toughwhite and rich in America. What frightens me is how few Americans study history: alternate realities, demonization of the media, setting up immigrants as the 5th column, playing the victim, a legislature abdicating...this all happened about 90 years ago in Germany
@MlLedoux Those assholes don’t represent the Church or its dogma. We are taught that our faith must inspire works of kindness to our fellow humans. Through this we receive Grace. I am ashamed that they attend aCatholic school &amp; even moteso if they call themselves Catholic
@BarbMcQuade @umichbball @BadgerMBB Who’s the #1 rated women’s team? That small school in NW Indiana?
@BettyBowers Let’s not condemn an entire school because of one asshole. Let’s also be careful lumping Catholic Schools in with all Christian schools. Catholicism teaches that faith alone is not enough...that faith must inspire acts of charity &amp; love towards each other.  This leads to Grace
@KamalaHarris Dr King loved all people. He didn’t hate Catholics. You are no Dr. King

Bigotry is bigotry https://t.co/RPLSxCYCWT
The writing of Judge Barrett that Senator Feinstein attacked was one that she should embrace...it said that if found in the very rare position that their personal views might skew their position, they should recuse themselves &amp; not impose their beliefs on others!
More Catholics have died in service to this nation than any other religion. Perhaps Sens Hirono, Harris, &amp; Feinstein should remember that when questioning our loyalty to the constitution! #ReligiousBigotry
At the core of Sens Hirono, Harris, &amp; Feinstein lie the same misunderstanding against which Kennedy had to fight 60 years ago...that somehow Catholics aren’t capable of separating their religious beliefs from their const. duty. Why are we alone asked this?#ReligiousBigotry
@hypocriseenow @KamalaHarris @mazieforhawaii I don’t care for most of Trump’s judicial nominees, either...but you can attack their record w/out going after their religion!

@tedlieu Here’s an idea, someone go remind the Senate that there is no actual Senate rule that allows the majority to block a vote. It has become a custom since the 1940s...but not a rule. If 51 Senators want a vote, they can force it. So shove McConnell in a garbage can and end this!
@CNN Nobody really wanted to hear him brag about how his administration is more popular than that of G. Washington
@Sarah_SKG_1983 Good!
@jaketapper Let’s see that revised ‘19 Q1 GDP are going to look
@ChrisMurphyCT My solution for school violence...1960’s style Catholic school for all. It’s not often that you get to see sister Michael Brigid going full on Bruce Lee in the midst of 20 10th graders

@shaunking @diddymcc May be hard to coordinate from ptison...but ok
Can someone point me to the School House Rock video that shows the loudmouth A-hole shutting down the government because neither the people nor Congress want to give $5B for a national defense contract that requires the masonry union?#NoWall
@joncoopertweets They need to boot his cowardly ass out of the leadership
@kasie He’s far from the first. 70% of Senate seats represent 30 % of the population? Madison was afraid of majority tyranny. He could never have imagined a tyranny of the minority. We made ourselves a democracy w/out changing the Republic mechanisms already in place.
@NicolleDWallace @nytimes Oh, I’ve already disliked that sonofabitch for years
@ddale8 @NicolleDWallace I keep flashing back to the Simpsons episode in which Homer didn’t know how to use a touch tone!
@GarrettHaake @HallieJackson @senatemajldr A cowardly man from a cowardly state

@WillieGeist @Captsully My buddies and I get together every 1-2 months to watch that movie &amp; play the drinking game!
@kwelkernbc @POTUS It was beautiful! You should have followed with, “I get that the Ruskie tax code is a bitch. Did they lease you long term or rent by the hour?”!
@thelastpinkcar @essenviews @NanaDavis_46 Oh, they are far too cowardly to take responsibility
@senatemajldr Hey Gramps, did you read today’s polls? &gt; half of the country blames your party for the shutdown, more than half want your stupid wall, &amp; more than 70% oppose the shutdown for which they bale you. Stop being a coward! Your bow has a 37% approval rating. Fix it!
@thelastpinkcar @essenviews @NanaDavis_46 Hey, I’m on you’re side. The sad political political reality, however is that they have the votes to confirm. We would need 2out of 3 of Gardner, Murkowski, or Collins to Break...assuming that no Democrats jump the fence.
@LouisLe85627147 @realDonaldTrump I’ll give you the weight gain, but the three presidents that I remember well...Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr, Obama look like they all aged a decade in their first term!
@thelastpinkcar @essenviews @NanaDavis_46 I’m not saying that he is correct &amp; shouldn’t know it for this new job. I don’t want him on the job...just saying that in private practice or corporate law, the clause rarely presents its. As counsel for Goldman Sachs&amp; St. Jude, I had to drag out my old ConLaw book to brush up

@eketto72 @ayasaurusrex @petmille @dreammaker1951 @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump Annie Moore was her name. A fifteen year old girl from Ireland was the first to step foot on Ellis Island. She was an orphan fleeing the 2nd great potato famine
@realDonaldTrump Meetings, take an hour long lunch hr., have lights out by 4:00. Most men age 20 years in office. You look as if you built a health spa!
@realDonaldTrump This may be ahockvfor a guy who rolls into the oval at 11:00, read nothing, sleep thru 2 mee
@malinablue @MlLedoux Wake me when he makes them up!
@SwampyTrump @MlLedoux @GOP My mom wa right! ANYONEcan grow up to be President!
@maziehirono @MlLedoux @realDonaldTrump And you woul like to end those of Catholics, Senator?
@AdamSchiff @Koboxer2380 I’m actually more disgusted by Lindsay Graham’s opening committee statements...that &amp; the “let’s pitch the wall one more timr”!
@thelastpinkcar @essenviews @NanaDavis_46 I can’t stand this guy, but it isn’t outlandish that he not know ConLaw. He isn’t a federal judge, has spent over half of his career in private practice. Plus, we are in virtually waters here with the Clause and Slappy!
@bresla_linda @KathyLeone12 @TomiLahren @foxnation Is unaware of that? They have Shep Smith...that’s it
@MSNBC Kick them in the ass, Senator!
@nytimes @Robin56362858 Look out, Ole Man McConnell!
@SenatorDurbin @SenWhitehouse Has anyone checked Ole Man McConnell’s pulse? He is nearing 132. I think that he is the man whose wife ran off with Andrew Jackson!
@KassandraSeven I almost feel sorry for him...&amp; I wish House Oversight were grilling him
@Isikoff Oh, Trump cleared the barrier required by our Founders for impeachment in 2017. The problem, debated greatly by the Founders, ended up a political remedy...&amp; they never could have forseen this tribalism!
@ProudResister @rohaniroop I love it, but categorizing Alex Jones as a “journalist” is one hell of a stretch!
@SenKamalaHarris Trying to keep out Catholics, also?
@EdKrassen @finafyr My neighborhood growing was very nice but had $1M+ homes close to high ridden areas. When they would get caught burglarizing, stealing cars, etc, cops wouldn’t arrest them...just took them out of sight &amp; beat them (white, black, brown, etc). Congress should adopt that plan!
@SenJeffMerkley @finafyr Could Trump not found someone from an earlier Republican regime? Was Taft’s guy not available?
@chrislhayes Yeah, I noticed it, too. Another in his world of “unitary executive authority” bs
@DavidPriess @finafyr I’ pretty sure that Putin May have more than a passing interest!
What’s up with Lindsay, a member of the party that is supposed to stand for law &amp; order, taking pot shots at the FBI at the beginning of the confirmation hearings? Is he trying to score early points against Trump &amp; Cruz for 2019’s biggest asshole award?
@Mimirocah1 I just got my 100th...what about me?
@abbydphillip @Cluelesscomedy3 He probably just figured that he’d catch up on the details at the next Klan rally

@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH &amp; our test scores fall yet again!
@nytimes Godspeed!
@keithboykin @MonicaMonicawt1 Seriously, is Monty Burns now running this party?
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Oh, you just know that he will be the first to drop the F-bomb during his own impeachment trial!
@NatashaBertrand He’s like a crazy great uncle in our family who left when I was a baby. 2 decades later, he sends (hand to God) the entire Sinatra collection &amp; has invited himself back to every holiday dinner . He’s a great plumber, but I still utilize my home warranty if the crapper overflows!
@sissyroxx @NatashaBertrand @MaddowBlog Oh, I just like to tease you! I did tell you that I went to all male schools, played sports, have 2 brothers, &amp; am Irish, correct? I curse many times when, in no way, for which thebsituation calls🤭
@sissyroxx @NatashaBertrand @MaddowBlog How, I have a degree in English Literature along with my Finance degree. My emphasis was Creative Writing. My dad always used to tease me (laughingly) that, with an Eng. degree, I could be the most educated bar tender in Memphis😊All that he truly wanted for me was happiness!
@TeodroseFikre @gaijingirl2004 Racism is a funny charge to throw about from a woman who holds such anti-Catholic bigoted views. I used to respect her. Now...let her reap what she does.
@SenatorCollins A compromise? A typical response from you. If he wants his stupid wall, submit it through the legislative process, make his arguments, take a vote, &amp; live with the outcome. You don’t get to shut down the government over a stupid wall unwanted by the majority of US. Do your job!
@hardball Really? There are a few hundred million of the rest of us pissed as well!
@yesitsme111 Great piece of legislation that went the way of the dinosaur. Its repeal was a major cause of the Great Recession of ‘08
@sissyroxx @NatashaBertrand @MaddowBlog “Nary a soul!” You know, when profanities aren’t flying out, you are quite eloquent!😇
@harrylitman @ProfessorShaw But with an incredibly expansive view of executive powers. He played major roles in controversial probes under Reagan/Bush. Dems need to get a sworn declaration not to interfere or hide results (grand jury &amp; intelligence etc) He must also swear to recuse if ethics suggests
@thomaskaine5 @finafyr The hypocrisy of evangelicals smells like no other
@NBCNews So long as they nail him on that burglary charge!
@themaxburns @Robin56362858 I hope that the film continues to roll one in jail!
@gayleelynn @tedcruz What he obviously meant to say is, “nobody within Washington cares about me.” I could buy that one. Texans don’t really care, either, as long as you can say the word, “yea” inside the judiciary committee
@EasttownDems We’re supposed to take the word of a man who allowed “Candidate Trump” to call his wife ugly &amp; suggest that his DAD was behind the JFK assassination? Had he commanded the Alamo, a brown flag would have announced its surrender (ted’s soiled underpants)!
@TheUSASingers @GotJanie Blame the media
@sissyroxx @senatemajldr I doubt that our founders had a round table discussion exploring ways to best drop the F-Bomb, but point taken😊
@Comey Oh, that’s way too big a sound to be simply former Republicans. That’s decent humanity!
@realDonaldTrump Is he the only NATO leader that you have met? We have others, you know...others whose close friendships date back more than 100 years. You could run your talks with them on a pre-paid phone card!
@sissyroxx @senatemajldr Language, Italy🤬😇
@sissyroxx I hope,at least, that you’ve been to the basilica at the vatican. No religion about it. The artistic merit is worth it!
@sissyroxx @C_Stroop It doesn’t even have to be an oath...they can affirm and not swear. The new Senator from Arizona just affirmed her pledge on a law book
@sissyroxx Yes, I understand its definition. We are talking past each other. No big deal. You will always be my, “Italy.”😋
@sissyroxx @C_Stroop They aren’t being called out for it when it is time to take a secular oath of office...at least not by the US Senate
@sissyroxx I completely agree with you! These nominees were deemed, simply on the basis of their religion, unable to carry out their oath of office. That only happens to Catholics
@sissyroxx Dogma has a particular connotation in the Catholic Church, &amp; within the context of the conversation, the meaning was clear. It doesn’t matter. I am the one that found it offensive...not you. I’m no snowflake...I can live through it😊
@sissyroxx But yet no evangelical is asked about his religious beliefs. So how are they covering this latest Trump revelation in Europe? He nearly took a swing at a reporter this morning
@sissyroxx It was a HUGE issue. Nobody thought that this nation would elect a Catholic. Thank God his father was so wealthy!
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs I hear you, but would you vote for an anti-Semite?
@sissyroxx Any religious test be required to hold public office. Still, why are only Catholics singled out. Sen Feinstein said to a judicial nominee, “your dogma is showing.” Imagine the uproar that would explode if someone said to her, “Your Jewness is showing.” &lt;drop the mic&gt;😊
@sissyroxx Campaign, to speak to a stadium full of evangelicals in Houston. He was hammered about whether he would govern via the constitution or take orders from the Pope. He won that audience &amp; the election...but here we are 60 years later &amp; nothing has changed. Our constitution (2/3)
@sissyroxx It largely did. Dig through history to th JFK campaign. He had everything that America wanted in its president...save one. His Catholicism became the single greatest campaign issue that he faced. The turning point happened when JFK, against the advice of everyone in his (1 of 2)
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs Feel better!
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs I think that I’ll just be the kind of expat that turns his back on politics😊
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs It is too detailed to explain via tweet, but let’s just say they aggressively pushed about Catholicism in a way that would be a national scandal had they been speaking of Judaism.
@sissyroxx No, that’s not REALLY the question...because both parties have discriminated. 3, I believe...all Democrats...Al Smith in 1920, Kennedy in ‘60 &amp; John Kerry. Considering that we comprise 25% of the vote, those #s don’t square
@fionawoods46 @irmdaen @ProudResister @gafolicious It bugs the crap out of me...but your point is very sound!
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs Well, in two years, the Russians can roll tanks into our streets...Trump won’t be re-elected. I’m a Beto O’Rourke fan, but people say that he’s not progressive enough. The US can get to where the progressives want...but not in 1 election. O’Rourke inspires like nobody since Obama
@sissyroxx @glangendorf01 @Helenhs Very true. Harris &amp; Hirono made their comments 5 weeks ago. Feinstein gets a bit more slack...her comments were nearly 10 months ago😊
@sissyroxx @Helenhs I thought expats were apolitical😊
@sissyroxx Yes, I think that I read about that scandal somewhere😊 Those 3 senators were making the same ignorant statements that JFK had to answer 60 years ago. We, by far, comprise the largest religion in the US...yet only 1 has been elected President in ~230 years? A statistical outlier?
@irmdaen @gafolicious @ProudResister Oh hell no. The last thing that they want is a critical mind. It is immoral to live in the world’s wealthiest nation &amp; yet have the majority scrape by or live below the poverty line. If we fairly taxed the top 1%, we could fully fund school &amp; pay teachers decently!
@glangendorf01 @sissyroxx @Helenhs In other words, don’t support a Trump re-election bid?😊
@sissyroxx @Helenhs And how do I know that you aren’t one of them...playing the long game!
@gafolicious @irmdaen @ProudResister I hear you! I wonder, however, if it isn’t education that makes the difference. We claim to be the greatest nation on earth, but numbers simply refute that assertion. Our test scores (along with many other metrics) are among the worst in the world. We even ranked #15 in freedom!
@PuppetBalcony @LauriePalmer3 @Jersey_Craig @KAZurcher Technically, she could be prosecuted for that. How in the hell does a Congresswoman from Hawaii get a face to face with Assad? I’m going to re-evaluate my progressive friends as sources of reliable info
@sissyroxx Not at all. I spent many years being agnostic. I don’t even mind people who are anti-religion. I only take offense when the Catholic Church gets singled out for slanderous remarks...as Sens Harris, Feinstein, &amp; Hirono. It disappointed me, because I respected &amp; liked all 3
@realDonaldTrump Crazy would be standing on a world stage and taking the word of an ex KGB agent over that of our intelligence communities
@SenSasse The President is tweeting about militarizing the Southern Border. This President has gone mad. As someone with an appreciation for our institutions, I beg you to stop him
@Morning_Joe Trump tweets that the Southern Border will become militarized
@sissyroxx No, I am the strongest supporter of that separation you will find. Personally, however, it makes me detest her😇
@irmdaen @ProudResister I even read that these A-holes are starting to show up in Canada! When the Canadians become violent, we’re all screwed
@sissyroxx Harris is still anti Catholic
@phuck_dat @MalcolmNance @StephMillerShow This man is insane.
@realDonaldTrump No, read the polls. We don’t, comrade!
@TravisAllen02 I’ll go one further. In addition, let’s start taking the fight to those Russian bastards.
@sissyroxx I do my own research, also...but I am new to this progressive movement. As my friends claimed to be expert progressives, I relied on their testimony. If that meets the legal evidentiary standard to send one to prison, it should serve as a basis of knowledge of a HI Congresswomen!
@irmdaen @ProudResister My friend, we are in for a wild rise!
@sissyroxx So long as they are native born citizens &amp; 35 years old. As we found out in ‘16, literally nothing else matters other than that which is constitutionally mandated...intellectual curiosity, vision, temperament, integrity, honesty, obedience to the law, empathy-they don’t matter
@shybot @NancyRog11 @RickSantorum Oh, I saved it.
@sissyroxx Slacker
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER Absolutely. Granted, I live in TN where it isn’t usually -15 degrees outside, but I’ve always enjoyed cold weather running. To me, heat is the factor that saps the life out of you
@Pegerella @NancyRog11 @realDonaldTrump There you go MAGA maniacs. In the event you can’t read, Trump screwed you yet again
@sissyroxx Perhaps you should run
@sissyroxx YOU are supposed to tell me when I’m walking on dicey political ground! PS-have you read the latest headlines on Trump?
@irmdaen @ProudResister Currently, there are 17 open criminal investigations to which he is connected. Now, the FBI has opened a counterintelligence op on him...on suspicions of being a Russian agent. Most would think that the Republicans would put country above political party...but they do nothing
@irmdaen @ProudResister So you guys are having trouble with these fringe right wing asshole also. Perhaps I’m being overly critical, but the world,while flawed, had its shit together before Trump
@AdamSerwer @realmissbeeswax One can spell
@TopRopeTravis @NancyRog11 Nunes just wants to know how to join up w/King &amp; Friends
@MissNyetTrump Yeah, noticed that,also...I guess he figures he’s losing the “US politician most like Satan” contest to trump &amp; decided to go full on method actor
@irmdaen @ProudResister You mean that, until now, you guys liked him?
@tedlieu @Koboxer2380 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump When he sees the poll numbers, his aides will be begging to reopen. His precious base is melting away
@essenviews She isn’t qualified to run my niece’s piggy bank...let alone the World Bank
@Cluelesscomedy3 @tonyposnanski I find it disgusting, also, but his default instinct is to go low. When I was at Goldman Sachs, they feared her so much because she understood Finance better than they did. Her ability to master complexities will show Trump for the nitwit that he is
@Helenhs @sissyroxx Thanks! Here in TN, we obviously have little visibility into HI members of Congress. I, too, am making a political transformation, &amp; my progressive friends were so sure. I asked the question, “is she the real deal?” I’m sure they are all pretty pissed, now, also.
@Helenhs @sissyroxx I had no idea that this storm of news was breaking around us. The Twitter-verse turned on me. Obviously, a person’s life choice’s (of any kind) are fine with me. This is what I get for listening to others. I’m going to conduct all research personally b/fore commenting on them
@sissyroxx Could possibly break while I was taking the kiddos to dinner &amp; ice skating. So when someone sent me a tweet calling her anti-gay, I just thought that she must have said something back in her past &amp; praised her ability to change. (2/3)
@sissyroxx You have to help me here, Italy. I have a Twitter mob after me over Tulsi Gabbard. Someone posted about hateful speech she gave. Since my Progressive friends love her so, I thought (genuinely) that the scandal was years old. How could I have known that a deluge of info(1 of 2
@PuppetBalcony @LauriePalmer3 @Jersey_Craig @KAZurcher Gabbard was a person that my progressive friends have been pushing. I gave her a cursory look &amp; obviously missed a lot. What did she do w/ Assad?
@Cluelesscomedy3 @tonyposnanski Wait, I am new to Twitter...so I may mis-apologizing. I am apologizing for the news that broke about Rep. Gabbard. I had been told by progressive friends that she was “real deal.” I don’t share those views. As for Trump...fuck him!
@jdawsey1 And he’s still lying in both answers
He wants his long, stupid, ineffectual, crazy expensive wall. Just han. Multiple Federal Judicial Courts &amp; 2 States Attorneys will show you 4 walls you 4 walls. They won’t be as long, but will be effective, keep people out, &amp; have been paid for #ArrestThePresident
@NBCNews You know what Obama had that your guy didn’t/never will? A 65% approval rating &amp; the continued respect &amp; admiration of the nation &amp; world
@ParryPierce @senatemajldr Is “gone to meet his maker” an uncouth answer? Face it which is more likely...the govt. reopens or McConnell reaches 108 yrs
@tonyposnanski @Cluelesscomedy3 Do you know how played that Warren thing will be by next year? We are watching a man in freefall
@RepMaxineWaters I thought that maybe he just liked the pretty colors &amp; trend lines
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hey dumbass...I thought that you Republicans were strict constructionists. If you want your wall, man up &amp; send a bill through the legislative process. Make your case to Congress &amp; the people. Give to get. You’re too much of a coward to do that, so you shut down the govt? Pussy!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Keep ranting...your favorability ratings plunge more each time you do. Good news though...instead of one, long, costly, unbuilt wall, Bob Mueller is going to treat you to four tried but true walls that are paid in full. Plus-round the clock security!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Why, Linsey, drink your sweet tea. You’re having yourself a case of the vapors! PS- If you tell us the spot next to Sen. McCain’s grave where you buried your testicles, I’m sure that some NGO would dig them up &amp; send them home!
@PalmerReport @Cluelesscomedy3 He &amp; Lindsay must be having a case of the Vapors!
@CNN Oh yeah, I’m sure that they just had the hap hap happiest Xmas since Bing Crosby Tao danced with Danny Fucking Kaye
@samstein @ParryPierce While completely invalid &amp; unsound, mathematicians &amp; physicists could find a beautiful symmetry in his logic
@Jersey_Craig @KAZurcher I sincerely apologize. I didn’t catch story that broke her words/beliefs. This was the basis for my tweet. I couldn’t imagine that all my progressive friends could support a bigot...so I thought she had made a few dumb comments many years ago. I would never endorse those beliefs
@EdKrassen @Cluelesscomedy3 @seanhannity Short answer: stupid Nazi fucker
@neal_katyal @ParryPierce No matter how much he loses in the divorce the divorce settlement, he will still be able to wipe his ass with Don’s dirty money
@John_Hudson @agearan @jdawsey1 As much as I dislike this administration, it was time that the US remembered which nation was the superpower. We ARE the ones who should be dictating. As for the insult part, tell them to suck it! Bolton insults people/allies like no American since John Adams in Versailles.
@str8and8long @MonicaMonicawt1 @girlsreallyrule While I am no hawk, the Russians are bad actors that need to be fought with Nyerere revery popular arrow in our quiver. Like it us or not, they are coming for us...&amp; we need to be ready to counter
I am really sorry for offending by words fe:Tulsi Gabbard, I was unaware of what was exposed Fri. . I had been told by progressives that she was solid, so I assumed that the comments were ancient history...&amp; she evolved. I believe in respect,  compassion. &amp; dignity for all people
@CharlieSaidWTF That dumbass couldn’t get through the “Our Father” at Bush Sr’s funeral!
@bungdan Its a sad day when Germans can lecture us about fascism
@GeorgeTakei @BigRedSepulveda I’ll hand it to Shep. He is an actual journalist
@KPNatsFan Sadly, I think that he cares only about the approval of his base
@MalcolmNance Great job this morning!
@Valerie_Resist @Jersey_Craig @KAZurcher I must have missed the remarks that she made. I just know that she has become progressive...&amp; my progressive friends love her. If she made hateful comments, I apologize.
Great point just made on tv. This shutdown CAN’T end with a Declaration of Emergency. It is an incredibly idangerous, extra constitutional move that our founders would NEVER have created. Germany was still a Republic until Hitler seized control during an Emergency Declaration
@tedlieu How fucking desperate do you have to be to even be on that show
@NancyRog11 Be was the one that could have brought about the most change!
@KPNatsFan How big of an ass do you think Trump feels like this morning?
@AmandiOnAir @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateGOP Every GOP member of Congress except a few would still blame the media, &amp; Judge Jeanine would stroke out. Hannity &amp; Carlson would explain why, technically, treason shouldn’t be a crime, &amp; Limbaugh would tell listeners that he’s on hold w/ the Kremlin &amp; will have Putin on our side
@AOC As a part of New Green Deal, add a constitutional amendment 1) banning paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations, eliminate all corporate donations @ PAC $, place a 10 year post congressional ban on Congress members joining lobbying firms or serving on Boards of Directors
@sissyroxx I broke the 100 follower mark! Suck it, Italy😊! JK
@essenviews And this surprises who?
@kathygriffin @lumin8 Sadly, Lindsay isn’t consulted on House committee decisions
@politico Lindsay is having a case of the Vapors!
@JillWineBanks @MalcolmNance @merce2me @LawProfButler @maddow @Lawrence @HechtCs @vegasbanks @robreiner I agree &amp; even called my ConLaw professor at ND to get his opinion. The notes taken by delegates @ the convention say a lot. They only discussed political solutions &amp;  presupposed an objective Senate. They also took for granted the prosecution of a President once outbof office
@Jersey_Craig @KAZurcher People aren’t allowed to evolve &amp; change anymore? This is what I fear...that the progressive wing will become the ideological counterpart to the Tea Party. Why do we care about a person’s past beliefs? They benefit or harm no one. I look at what a person believes today
@SaysHummingbird @KAZurcher Trump runs home to mommy to complain that people are being mean to him. I thought that those assholes at Fox were supposed to be about the flag &amp; patriotism. Had this been Obama, they would be leading marches in the streets!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI Now the Post is reporting that, on five occasions over 2 years, Trump took unprecedented steps to conceal his conversations with Putin...including demanding notes from interpreters &amp; instructing interpreters to keep conversations secret even from Sr. Staff...Asshole!
This just keeps getting better...The Post is reporting that, on 5 occasions spanning 2 years, Trump went through unprecedented measures to keep his conversations with Putin a secret.
Do you think that Trump might be regretting all of the insults of the media right now?
@goatswan Yeah, my two brothers are Delta pilots, &amp; they’ve been told to expect disruptions. Just as well...ATCs already have an incredibly stressful job. I don’t need them any more stressed. I’d like my bros &amp; their passengers landing safely
I think that comparing Arnold to Trump does Arnold a disservice. Before his treason, his heroism &amp; leadership at Saratoga literally kept the Revolution alive. So...before he betrayed his country, at least he saved it first! #BenedictDonald
@PoliticusSarah Obviously untrue, but it doesn’t change the fact that she was a bad candidate who ran a bad campaign. Warren should have always been pushed to run in her stead.
@KroupaBo @FluffyDoom Yes, they did. This will give you another first about which you can brag. If I were someone who cared about you, I’d hope that you were guilty. If not, your bumbling actions made you so stupid and inept that the FBI took an unprecedented action! I’d rather be guilty than stupid!
@AdamParkhomenko @finafyr Congrats on booting his dumb, fat ass out of office
@RedTRaccoon @finafyr Shocker
@RWPUSA @finafyr @ABC The national emergency declaration wasn’t meant to be a tool to bypass Congress. This man already displays autocratic qualities. Senate Republicans-man up! When Congress gave the Chief executive authority to declare an emergency, I’m guessing they assumed that one would exist
@RWPUSA @finafyr @ABC I’m having trouble understanding the Republican position. If Trump wants his stupid wall, Intoduce legislation, discuss, count votes, &amp; live w/ decision. They act as if Trump’s position is a legal or constitutional one. They don’t have votes for the wall, so pass a veto proof CR
@SaysHummingbird @finafyr Cruz &amp; the rest of his Senate Republicans (with a couple exceptions) are a bunch of cowards! Why would they care if Trump sells out the country. They all have their noses in his ass
@mcspocky @finafyr YouTube &amp; other platforms have dropped this asshole. Companies such as You Tube, Facebook, etc, as private companies have no obligation to protect the 1st amendment. They can just drop his dumb ass. It only takes moral courage!
@DrDenaGrayson @finafyr @TSA @realDonaldTrump My two brothers are Delta pilots. Both always spoken of their administration for ATC &amp; TSA agents. Both are flying right now. Now Donald just dialed up to 15 the stress meter of both agencies. 8,000 planes &amp; 1.2M flyers above at all times. Don, it’s on you to land them safely!
@GeorgeTakei @finafyr Oh, I’m taking vacation &amp; throwing a kegger!
@EdKrassen @finafyr There are so many investigations taking place, that it will be like walking into a Chocolate shop...which convictions will be the sweetest!
@TheTweetOfGod @JC_Cali That should be on the tablets!
@mehdirhasan @chrislhayes But still impressive
@dandrezner @KAZurcher Then tell those in his district to boot his Nazi ass out of office
@KassandraSeven @realDonaldTrump Oh, his hillbilly sycophants like him
@Helenhs @sissyroxx Bring it on. RBG can take care of herself. That said, the next president could appoint 2-3 Justices (assuming RBG makes it to 2020)!
@BlaineWHardaway @KAZurcher Oh, without question. These views have now moved into the Republican mainstream. However, I worry about the left. As someone who has actually moved from centrist Republican to progressive SD, I am becoming worried at the lack of tolerance shown to those whose views differ at all
@AynRandPaulRyan @jontester Give me over $40B, &amp; I will secure our borders! For that $, you could announce that you will give $10,000 to 40,000 people that seek legal immigration or asylum at a port of entry. Coyotes, drugs, human trafficking...corner the mkt. until the others are gone
@amvetsupport @KAZurcher Not once in all of those tirades did I see a refutation of the actual charges
@GotJanie God. can you imagine the utter disappointment of Fred Trump. He spent years breaking so many crimes to amass a huge fortune...and most of it was lost bailing out his dumbass son, Donald...who, in turn, would pass on that same dumbass gene to his moronic sons Don Jr &amp; Eric
@gregpmiller The only question now is the response of the Republican Congress. They have the power to end this. However, just as shocking as Trimp’s behavior to Congress has been the unwillingness of Congressional Republicans to act.
@tedlieu @Koboxer2380 Watched your analysis yesterday...great job!
@Lawrence Of all pundits that have spoken, one just irritates the shit out of me. I don’t know her name, but she is your typical ignorant, inbred, Trump voter who, this time, said “Few Americans care about the lives of pencil pushers in DC”. Forget her ignorance. She claims to be Christian
@realDonaldTrump I’ll save the time and ask that you read our constitution. If you want your wall, use the process. Introduce legislation &amp; allow Congress to vote. You are too much of a toddler to do that. You just throw a hissy fit and close the government. Ask your Russian handlers to fund it
@JoyceWhiteVance Great analysis. My ex-fiancé obtained her law degree at Alabama. I went north to ND. She was killed in a n auto accident before you made your tv debut, so I don’t know if she took any classes. I hope that she did.
@lisamurkowski How are you in this party? I was one, also. Now, most are all cowards. Remind Ole Man McConnell that your powers in Article 1. Also, you know that, while having become customized, no actual Senate rule gives the majority leader from blocking a vote. It is time to break the glass!
@maddow I’d just like a time machine so that I could go back and punch Madison in the mouth
@girlsreallyrule I think that’s the guy that was standing next to Oswald when he got shot!
@sissyroxx Well, while apocryphal, remember this quote attributed to Twain, “When I was a boy of 14, I thought my father [mother] was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years”
@sissyroxx And I’m sure that your daughter loves you very much!
@sissyroxx Ok...good! I don’t think their parents would be too happy otherwise😊!
@sissyroxx I love them all equally, but Erin, the middle child, has always had a little extra space in my heart...perhaps because my sis says that she is just like me. William is just hitting the age to show a personality, so I know that we will be big buddies going forward.
@sissyroxx My dad said something similar to me. My bros were naval aviators. My dad said that I think far too independently to ever be in military! I have never been good at just blindly following orders!
@sissyroxx Did I just send a picture of my kids to everyone on Twitter. I hit the button on your page
@sissyroxx They are! I would jump in front of a train for any of them. I had figured that I would have had my own by now, but now I get to be the cool uncle! I know you don’t play favorites, but does one of your kids stand out to you?
@sissyroxx You are more violent than mee😊
@sissyroxx Sent pic of the kids at zoo
@sissyroxx I would love to kick his smug ass
@sissyroxx Hey Italy, you there? Great day at zoo with kids!
@sissyroxx I’m also a little worried that my familial duties are hindering my quest your follower count. The growth rate seems to be slowing. I am 2 short of 100! I need to come up w/ something big. Can you think of a way to exploit the kids😊?
@sissyroxx Watching an Australian documentary on the Russia probe that I found on YouTube. While I am not a violent person at all, I don’t think that I’ve seen a single Trump official/older son/business partner/friend/etc whose ass I would not thoroughly love to kick...especially Don Jr!
@sissyroxx The pancakes were a HUGE success! I may, in fact, be the world’s greatest uncle! Now they are destroying the upstairs! Since I have 4 upstairs bedrooms, I keep one for guests &amp; have allowed the kids to each have a room. We’re going to the zoo in a bit!
@ParryPierce @JoycejohnsonR @MingGao26 Sing it, Granny!
@EdKrassen @finafyr Correction...still is being
@kenolin1 @finafyr Poor man. He has the vapors!
@sissyroxx Geez, the FBI had opened up a counterintelligence probe on the President for being a possible Russian agent. Donald Trump May be the most crooked man to ever live. What an asshole!
@sissyroxx I don’t buy into unemployment stats. It is &lt; 4%, but people are working 3 of those jobs to scrape by. It’s a shame your gang’s not here My nieces &amp; nephew stayed over. I’m making Uncle Matt’s famous pancakes. Today, I’m using orange &amp; pineapple juice to make them!
@sissyroxx If I had that deal, I would pay the tax. During my first 5 years, I averaged 3,400 hours/year. That changed after Colleen was killed. Now, I’m just sitting here on vacation at home b/c I would’ve have lost 2 weeks of  2018 vacation. I talked them into letting me take them now😊
@JohnJHarwood @SaltyLenore So, Fox &amp; Friends, the tax plan is so radical that it was in effect in your lifetime. Did rich people not work hard then?
@NBCNews So now we’re paying racists $69M after firing them. As an attorney, I would love to kick the ass of whoever negotiated her contract. Was there no “morals” clause? We hold the kids in our mailroom to higher ethical standards. What a pathetic bitch!
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump No, he won’t even be on the ballot.
@RepCuellar @HouseBlueDogs Take your sorry ass to the Republican caucus
@ForeverLogical @FluffyDoom @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KUSINews When are we going to kick his old, corrupt ass out of office so the world can go back to normal?
@NBCNews I hope you Iowans are proud!
@ProudResister @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump &amp; she didn’t have an entire network constantly slander the FBI (when they weren’t ignoring the story in favor of anti immigration pieces) I thought that Fox was the “Law &amp; Order” Network. They support all law enforcement except the FBI. How convenient
@Augustus709 @FluffyDoom This is the first instance in my life when I have wanted to see the Patriot Act enforced! I’d love to see a Trump family vacation to Gitmo!

@Helenhs @FluffyDoom @FoxNews Wow, I thought Fox &amp; Hannity were the patriotic network. Taking a knee during the anthem should be a capital offense, but constantly aiding &amp; supporting a man suspected of being a Russian agent is morally righteous? You guys used to hate our enemies. What changed?
@WalshFreedom @finafyr But he still needs to go
@funder @finafyr They probably found out that it was being funded by the missing inauguration $
@NBCNews God bless her &amp; her family!
@AOC @Koboxer2380 I’m still not sure why everyone is so freaked out by you, but it’s a sure sign that you’re on the side of the Angels! Keep kicking them in the ass!
@Goss30Goss @finafyr No, what we need is a constitutional amendment banning laid lobbyists, directed donations, corporate donations, PAC money &amp; a 10 year “no hire/consult” stipulation on lobbying firms hiring frmr. Congressmen. Do that, &amp; no-one will want to stay in Congress more than a term or two
@bryanbehar @pvdork Imagine this same set of circumstances...but pretend that Obama was the president. Lindsay would be having vapors, Hannity would be chugging beta blockers, Limbaugh would be dead, as his pact w/ the devil would be fulfilled, &amp; the Rep. Congress would be marching w/ pitchforks!
@ProudResister @finafyr @realDonaldTrump 65 percent of the nation gets it. What is so stunning are the inbred Republican base that doesn’t care &amp;, in particular, the Republican Congress. Weren’t they the party that always claimed to be tough on Russia? Come on Lindsay...where’s your smug, stupid ass response this time?
@Ginger624 @finafyr Congressional Republicans are even bigger bitches than Trump. For 2 years, they put the interests of this man above those of this nation. No Republican ever again has a leg to stand on while talking politics w/me
@BeSeriousUSA @finafyr @DonaldJTrumpJr We’ll see how smug he is when he’s someone’s bitch in prison playing out inmates’ fantasy fetishes
@RBReich @finafyr Damn, Don. The FBI doesn’t open a counterintelligence probe against my paperboy w/out multiple reviews, many eyes &amp; very solid evidence. To open one against POTUS...my God, I can’t imagine the evidence that they have. And Sanders yet again, makes an ass of herself in response
@krassenstein @finafyr Well, until now, we all took it for granted that our presidents weren’t Russian assets...so I’m right there with you on this guy!
@BigRedSepulveda @SenSchumer @SenateGOP @senatemajldr @CNN @MSNBC @krassenstein @funder @RepSwalwell @tedlieu @MarkWarner He may want to rethink his position after he learns that Trump has been a target of a treason investigation
@ChrisAlbertoLaw @BexitWesty @lachlan I’d like to see one of these assholes try to scam my grandparents. They live in Irand, still haven’t fully accepted my nrother in law even after 3 grandkids due to his English heritage, still want  my brothers &amp; I settle disputes by putting on boxing gloves, &amp; suffer no fools!

@GeoffRBennett @PressSec @nytimes Keep telling yourself that, but the best law enforcement agents in the world disagree. You should be as astonished as the rest of us, &amp; be a Patriot!
@malbertnews @nytimes Make Russia Great Again! The anagram isn’t as catchy, but I’m sure it pays more!
@nytimes We win the Cold War only to have Grandpa sell us out? Gates (Gen. Horatio) should have just stopped the troops, given his sword to Cornwallis, sent the boys home, &amp; given the British directions to Savannah
@PeterHamby Gee, I wonder why that might be. You know, some white males aren’t complete toools, so thanks a lot!
@neeratanden I’m as progressive as it gets, but Harris is overtly bigoted in her anti Catholic bias. She will never have my support!
@maggieNYT Well, let’s be honest...he rolls into the oval at 11:00 am, reads nothing, takes two meetings, &amp; hour lunch, &amp; he’s out by 4:00. How much damage could he really do?
@realDonaldTrump Its not so much the mainstream media. It’s our own law enforcement &amp; intel agencies
@edokeefe We needed an investigation to determine whether Trump poses a national security threat. At the moment, he’s shut down the govt. over s wall. He’s taken Putin &amp; MBS’ word over our intelligence agencies. I think that the verdict’s in!
@nytimes I think that I remember reading that Washington &amp; Jefferson ran into this hiccup...no big deal!
@chrislhayes God, first the walls &amp; now wheels? You just know that it’s just a matter of time until some A-hole demonstrates fire to him. At any moment he will be demanding a massive fire wall to be built across the entire border. He knows oil &amp; gasoline, so those would be the likely suspects
@chrislhayes Chris, love the show &amp; understand the need to enlighten viewers about Steve King. However, could you not borrow terms/phrases from the Catholic Church to do so? Some here in the south are already not fans. &amp; I would rather not give them fodder! Thx!!!
@RepAdamSchiff Make a deal to reopen the government &amp; give him his wall ON THE CONDITION that he gives/makes no les, half truths, tweets, false analogies,hyperbole, or any words. gestures, or any means of communications by anyone in your party to mislead the public at large or individually
@ewarren Senator! I started my career at Goldman Sachs (before I realized I had lost my soul), &amp; you scared the shit out of them like nobody else. They spent millions fighting https://t.co/bHqXHDddeS a finance guy with experience w/ Rep Cohn’s campaigns, I would love to work for you !
@TheLastWord Yep, my grandmother in Ireland has been calling her poor neighbor lady a slut since her husband passed...&amp; Shanny doesn’t have a bit of proof!
@SenFeinstein as someone I greatly respected, I was greatly disturbed by the Jan 4th WSJ article in which you made extremely anti Catholic slurs . I thought that JFK put this bigotry behind us. Until an apology is made, every Catholic Media &amp; diocese in the US will receive copies
@maziehirono As someone for whom I respected, you should know that the orgs providing the most help to federal workers are Catholic Charities &amp; the KOC. You owe a public apology to all Catholics. Every Catholic Media outlet &amp; diocese has everything, &amp; are ready to run the story.
@SenKamalaHarris Senator, as someone rhat I used to respect greatly, I thought that you should know that two of the largest groups helping government workers in distress are Catholic Charities &amp; the KOC (the crazy group with extreme views). You owe an apology to all Catholics
@coachskid32 @SashaHillt @LindseyGrahamSC Because w/out Senator McCain, he is worthless
@LindseyGrahamSC You are a Senator, get your nose out of the President’s asshole!
@DHStokyo @finafyr @WorldBank I didn’t know that you could serve from Federal Prison
@politvidchannel @Robin56362858 There was another political party in the last century who disavowed facts, created alternative truths for their members, went after a minority group as a fifth column, &amp; slowly destroyed all democratic institutions. They had a good 10 year run...then we hanged the Nazi bastards
@Shakestweetz I didn’t know that he was even still alive!
@robreiner @ParryPierce Johnson was remarkably similar to him...they are both assholes rated by all historians among the bottom 2-3 presidents
@Fluffula The whole fucking world is going nuts. Even the Canadians are being infested with right wing thugs
@senatemajldr Hey, grandpa, stop being such a fucking coward. You own this now, &amp; if you don’t act like the leader of a coequal branch of our government, nobody will remember the judiciary achievements. Your legacy will be the cowardice that you showed here. Make the smart choice
@IlhanMN @diddymcc @senatemajldr Mr. Financial genius has already drained $250B out of the economy. Extrapolate that out for a year. It will be the world’s most idiotic &amp; $1T wall. I hope those 77,000 assholes in PA, MI , &amp; WI are proud.
Thanks for following me, Shelby. Tonight marks my 1 week anniversary w/ Twitter. I will try my best to earn your confidence with witty, inciteful, commentary!😊
@ParryPierce @SenJeffMerkley Damn right, Granny! My nephews are spending the night &amp; I’ve been dropping enough F-bombs to make men out of them😊!
@amyklobuchar Can she help me out with parking at the Mayo when I visit? I may as well park in St. Paul!
@MichaelCohen212 @ParryPierce Oh, I’m throwing a kegger, &amp; taking the next day off. I may even fly my grandparents back from Ireland for this. They hate the prick, too!
@ava @diddymcc Like my law professor said, we created a perfect criminal justice system...but then we added people
@SenJeffMerkley @ParryPierce What do you do when your Senators are Red State Trump Sycophants?
@JillWineBanks @allinwithchris @chrislhayes Always a pleasure...and I know Grandad wants to watch you once more before they head back to Ireland
@ggreenwald @diddymcc @politico Maybe that’s why people have thought Democrats to be pussies for two generations. How has the ”Republican Lite” strategy worked out?
@LincolnsBible @ParryPierce Then close your pie hole &amp; open the border
@MSNBC What a fucking asshole!
@ACLU @diddymcc You have to love the party of small government
@DavidCornDC @ParryPierce Yeah, she’s qualified
@SenFeinstein @ParryPierce The entire system is screwed up. My buddy’s wife was born in Europe &amp; went to ND with us. She was given her student visa, &amp; then work visa. They dated for five years before marrying, &amp; she still had to wait years to become a citizen.
@SenBlumenthal I will ask again: did Rudy’s doctor simply forget to read the MRI?
@BarbaraBoxer @ParryPierce Don’t you have to leave the Senate when you hit 100?
@ProudResister @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @Comey My eyes have been wide open for 2 years. We didn’t interact with the Russians this much as we did during the Cold War
@realDonaldTrump Can you imagine the letdown after winning the national championship only to have to go meet this A-hole?
@ShelbyKStewart I think the Nazis used that same labor wage scale. The guy that had your job was hung!
Interesting Bio - Great Potential https://t.co/STAbMcN2v9

@chrislhayes Great article on a true rising star!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, I hear those Texas mosquitos are a bitch
@essenviews And we wonder why we rank &lt;40th in every subject...who believes this crap? Do most vacations take $3B out of the economy?
@CatholicNewsSvc You need to read WSJ article from Jan 4 concerning anti Catholic bigotry from Sens Feinstein, Hirono &amp; Harris. It breaks my heart as I admired all 3. But the attacks were shameful
@sissyroxx Time out...The French work week is 35 hours, workers get 30 paid vacation days per year, &amp; the average work year is 1,400 hours/year? How much is the tax, &amp; where do I sign up?😊
@sissyroxx “Being visited upon”...such European sentence construction 😊
@sissyroxx Typical...the US pumps out more CO2/capita than any nation, our dumbass President pulls us out of the Paris Accord, &amp; France taxes it’s workers. We have an entire political party that denies climate change. Of course, most of them think that the world’s 4,000 yrs old
@sissyroxx You raise children with that mouth?😊
Mike Pompeo should be ashamed of himself. I don’t care about one’s ideology, the US Secretary of State does not go to an autocratic nation to give a speech that insults a former US president. Do we even visit democracies anymore?
Why is it that every time I watch the news, the GOP is up to a nefarious act (corruption, polluting, discriminating, suppressing, etc)? Just once, I’d like to hear, “in a stunning act of selflessness, GOP lawmaker darts into traffic to save a Muslim baby! Here’s Jim w/ sports!”
@sissyroxx I had given up the expat dream when I was getting married, but since my fiancé was killed in a car wreck, I have wanderlust. Is Europe still a safe place to travel around, or will I have to simultaneously fight off the fierce yellow vests &amp; fascist thugs?😊
@sissyroxx What kind of backward, dumbassed state loses a race to acknowledge slavery’s end to the Internet?
@TorresRhodes @mateagold @chrislhayes My brothers have always said that the ATCs have the most difficult job under normal circumstances. Now they’re mad &amp; distracted!
@sissyroxx I will always be grateful to my parents for taking us to great new places &amp; exposing us to other cultures. My unmarried bro. &amp; I travel as often as possible. Iceland is next on our list in a couple of months
@sissyroxx And it’s typical of a pansy assed European movement that you have to coordinate your outfit. 😊
@sissyroxx This is exactly why I want to be an expatriate...so I can insult the US unabashedly. I insult it constantly now...but it’s not as gratifying since I’m still on the team. I need to get out. As far as the movement...any nation that elects Trump is far too stupid to help itself
@sissyroxx Ahhh...you were making a joke. That is funny. I just tweeted or emailed, or texted (I forget) that Mississippi only recently ratified the 13th amendment. I thought for a second that it was you, &amp; you were saying I was wrong. How funny!
@sissyroxx https://t.co/bPHqsU7ORv
I love these GOP pricks already trying to mitigate the damage from Cohen’s upcoming testimony by saying that HE is a liar. These assholes just claimed that 4,000 terrorists were caught at the border last year... &amp; the Trump lie count was at 6,000 at Halloween
@ProudResister @wayoffbroadwayy @GOP @realDonaldTrump No need to explain. Nothing smells quite like evangelical hypocrisy

@PaulaReidCBS @CBSNews That’s ok...Mueller will remind him
@DearAuntCrabby @finafyr @TPM Rock on, RBG!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @Acosta Sadly, Madison could imagine that an absolute moron could lose the popular vote by 3M voters &amp; become president. He couldn’t, however, imagine that legislators could be so cowardly or a group of Americans so ignorant. Still, he’d agree w/ what we call them...Republicans!
@realDonaldTrump Tell us more about the 4,000 terrorists that are pouring in each year. When do the flying monkeys get here? How much did you allocate for the draw bridge, archers, lances, &amp; vats of boiling tar?
@sissyroxx So the government here has been closed for 21 days. Air traffic controllers must work w/out pay. My 2 brothers are Delta pilots. 8,000+ planes &amp; 1M+ passengers up there right now with stressed out ATC. Those two dumbasses will probably fly into each other!
@sissyroxx Now the govt. has been closed down here for 20 days. Air traffic controllers are being made to work w/out pay. My 2 bros. are Delta pilots. Rt now, 8,000+ planes &amp; 1M+ passengers are in the air...with stressed out ATC. My two dumbass brothers will probably fly into each other!
@sissyroxx Look at you busting out, “dystopian”! I truly wonder how many people reading these tweets know it’s definition. PS-I’d stay out of French disputes unless you want the whole nation surrendering to you!🇺🇸
There is no Senate rule that gives the majority leader the right to block a vote. It has just been done for so long that it is treated as a rule. They just need 51 members to vote &amp; 60 to pass the CR. I truly wonder if they know that.
@sissyroxx You’ll love this.  2Xmurder/abduction in WI. 13 year old escaped &amp; perp caught. They focus on the dumbest things. The agent said twice in his 1st sentence that he had no job (like a position now needs filling), &amp; swore to find more charges than double murder, kidnapping, &amp; rape!
@sissyroxx And that clean mouth😊🤭
@sissyroxx I just glanced at your profile. First...thank God you suffer no Nazis. My friendship policy is inclusive, but a man has to draw a line😊 2nd, how cool is it saying that you’re an expat? Hand to God...that is on my bucket list.   I have to try it
@sissyroxx &amp; how in the F did you get more than 8,700 followers? I’ve been on Twitter almost a week and am nearing 100. At this rate, I’ll have to quit my job and share my banter &amp; witty &amp; inciteful satire for two years straight. But after your foul mouth, don’t think I’m above it😊
@sissyroxx Is this the same F-bomb response as earlier or are you in the Vino?
@FoundDemocracy Yep...my grandmother living in Ireland has been calling her neighbor lady a slut since the woman’s husband passed...and Shanny has never had a shred of evidence!

Hey Granny...Happy Friday!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hey, Granny! Happy Friday!
@sissyroxx There are stronger ones that you haven’t already used on me today? I went to all male schools through high school &amp; played two sports in college. Plus...I have 2 brothers, I’m Irish, &amp; spent the week between Xmas &amp; New Years on a bender w/ my grandmother! I think I can take it!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hey dumbass, we’re here because your boy got spooked by Limbaugh. Justify for us how you now oppose the same cr that you supported 2 weeks ago. As for the “national emergency,” I’m going out on a limb &amp; guessing that Congress meant that there actually be one if the law is used!
@Mimirocah1 @CaraOriel @RudyGiuliani Seriously, did Rudy have a stroke that nobody noticed? This guy was once seriously respected
@espiers @NancyRog11 No, he just buried his testicles next to Sen. McCain
@KathyLeone12 That polished melon of frontal lobe that would otherwise be weighted down by hair further impedes his impulse control!
@sissyroxx So, without cursing me, what do Italians think of Trump?😊
@Jennybing53 @MalcolmNance @FoxNews @LouDobbs I hear you. That is how we got into this crazy world in which people don’t believe facts
@sissyroxx Apparently so! You certainly chose quite a rich one
@TheDemCoalition Does nobody care just how huge of a constitutional overreach this would be...struck down or not. When Congress passed this law allowing the chief executive to declare a national emergency...I’m sure that they envisioned that an actual emergency would exist when used
@RBReich @Jennybing53 Which is more sad...the remarks by King or the fact that Congress needed to be urged?
@KassandraSeven Woman of color...absolutely. Anti Catholic bigot...pass on Harris
@Franklin_Graham You’re the asshole that says that it is immoral NOT to support a man who is the antithesis of everything for which Christ stood. “We” aren’t responsible for this train wreck. It’s hypocrites like “you” that can take credit for that
@NBCNews Let’s just hope that tomorrow it’s Trump &amp; McConnell
@NBCNews Wall off Mississippi &amp; I’m on board!
@Billbrowder @SashaMinsk1 Tell them to elect Donald Trump as their president, and we’ll call it even

@MalcolmNance @Jennybing53 @FoxNews @LouDobbs You have to love it when those strict constructionists at Fox hop on the “let’s go full on Fidel” junta train! Assholes.
@TeaPainUSA @txbluinfo Did this man have a stroke that I missed? He was once a respected person
@KUTV2News Is this a trick question? It’s not even a neighborhood emergency. When the flying monkeys show up ( come on...you know that SOMEONE in the White House believed that “no idea is too stupid” crap and suggested to throw those #s into the other b.s. propaganda) take the poll again
@lola_patty @NancyRog11 Has he ever once made a single thing better?
@AmazingDouglass @pvdork I hope that each of those 49 assholes wind up on on his trauma surgical table
@RepSylviaGarcia I hope you came up with something unique like, “As soon as I finish this speech, I’m going to the other chamber to kick McConnell in the ass.” You would be the only human in Congress to string those words together!
@jilevin @sissyroxx Here’s a piece that should make a charming romantic comedy. God bless the USA
@TorontoStar My God, Canada is turning into America. For the sake of your own souls, stop &amp; go back to being nice before it’s too late!
@RWPUSA @Jennybing53 @CNN Here’s a crazy idea, Lindsay.

@hardball @JenniferWexton That will make my two Delta pilot brothers fly more calmly (To tell a family secret-they turn the autopilot on at ~1,000 feet &amp; read the paper until they land)
@sissyroxx You know, there’s a basic decency that even Europeans should observe!✌️
@seungminkim @LindseyGrahamSC Hey Lindsay, let’s wager over who wins that court challenge. I’d suggest wagering testicles, but you either buried yours next to Sen. McCain (who would be disgusted by you now) or gift wrapped them to Trump for Xmas!
@JoyAnnReid @NancyRog11 @senatemajldr He knows this because I think that he was already alive at the constitutional convention
@sissyroxx Watch that dirty mouth, Italy!
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump No kidding...my grandmother. Who lives in Ireland &amp; apparently runs on Zulu time, woke me up at 5:00 am to tell me how worried she is about my two Delta pilot brothers...oh, and to tell me that Trump’s still an asshole!
@chrislhayes Probably delivered by Amazon!
@SRuhle I’ll just take a flyer on this answer, but if you were really serious...you could have had them build AND pay for it
@mateagold @chrislhayes Both of my brothers fly for Delta. ATC is already one of the most stressful jobs that exists. The lives of millions of flyers each day are in the hands of air traffic controllers &amp; the TSA. We shouldn’t put an iota of extra pressure than needed. I like my brothers landing safely
@EWErickson @chucktodd No, as much as I agree with your motives &amp; politics, we don’t elect a king in this nation. Executive powers have expanded to the point of bursting. It is time that Congress reigns those powers back again, &amp; remember why the founders wrote the powers of Congress in Article I
@finafyr @RonLebow @TopRopeTravis I hear you. I know and feel horrible for the countless people he’s made suffer. but it’s also just damned embarrassing!
@chrislhayes I can tell you that they are all still assholes!
@kylegriffin1 @MalcolmNance McSally...I have earned the right to be in the Senate as much as she has. I wonder how it feels knowing everyone in the chamber think her to be a loser!
@essenviews @finafyr I’m pretty sure that Adams showed this kind of courage while presiding over the 1st Senate. McConnell should know, he was already middle aged
@finafyr @RonLebow @TopRopeTravis Good deal...and you are right. Thankfully, these past two years have awakened many people!

@RonLebow @finafyr @TopRopeTravis I still have Irish relatives, &amp; they were telling me how the “Brexit” fight has gotten out of hand. Just in the short time that they were here for the holidays, they were stunned by Trump’s tantrums &amp; behavior! Part of me wanted to go back with them
@JustinTrudeau Are you open to a trade with the U.S.? We will throw in a Vice President, several Congressional members, &amp; a 6th round draft pick!
@joncoopertweets Both of my brothers are Delta pilots. They aren’t crazy about having unpaid TSA agents as their last line of defense!
@nonya_bidniss @Abhinary @kylegriffin1 Oh, I think that we are seeing the beginning of the end
@skrossa @Surfingcity @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris You don’t like Francis? Perhaps it is the years of being beaten by Jesuits, but I’ve liked him. He does seem a bit scatter shot on addressing the abuse scandal. But he is a good man...I believe

@jimsciutto @chrislhayes When you tell people that it is your plan B, it undercuts your argument that things are that urgent
@PattyMurray @ParryPierce You need to pass legislation greatly rolling back executive powers. We don’t elect kings and there is a reason that your powers are written in Article One
@SenSanders You guys need to pass legislation to vastly roll back executive powers. We don’t elect Kong’s!
@jilevin @Jennybing53 For the same reason asshole and cocksucker are
@JoyceWhiteVance Maybe we should give back the sword &amp; retroactively surrender to Mexico and just give the land back
@jaketapper So pointing up to heaven, declaring total victory, &amp; saying that we are comin home “now” means a careful, slow, strategic maneuver in which we stay in country?

@essenviews Oh yeah, this asshole will burn it all down before letting Rush say bad things. Congress needs to revoke the ‘76? that gives the president the authority to declare this kind of emergency unilaterally
@girlsreallyrule In many ways, Pence is worse. With Trump, you get what you see. Pence is a snake. He believes that God meant for him to be president

@KamalaHarris Anti Catholicism should also offend us
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris I apologize for the “you’re not Catholic” remark. I just don’t understand how a Catholic defends those remarks. They should focus on the Fed. Society &amp; his past political activity. He was picked because of his membership in Fed Society...not KOC
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris And you never answered my question about substituting Feinstein’s comment. What if a Senator said, “Your Jewness is showing”?
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris What claim is false?
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Good grief, I was legally following your extreme example. I don’t want that guy on any court, much less Kavanaugh, Alito, or Thomas. But the other Sens were able to ask about Roe w/out dragging in his Catholicism.
@Mimirocah1 We’ve only been kidding up to now...but did the Senate Republicans ACTUALLY sell their souls to the devil. It would explain how McConnell made it to 134 years.

@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Kennedy was grilled over whether he could uphold any US law that came into conflict w/ church doctrine.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris The KOC views are those of the Catholic faith. I don’t even think that Hirono even asked if he would resign from the Federalist Society...which is the group to which he belongs that should concern them.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris If you want to take that incredibly insulting analogy to its extreme, the constitution would protect the fictitious Klan or ISIS member’s religious beliefs. It would probably be the hate crimes &amp; global terrorism that tripped them up. There is no way that you are Catholic
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Hirono is raising the exact same questions that Kennedy had to face 60 years ago. Harris is, again, using the KOC as a proxy for Catholicism. How did the others, who all put Roe at the top of the list, manage to ask about Roe w/o dragging in his Catholicism?
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris You were right. I read the full questionnaire. I don’t want this guy on the bench &amp; I find them more bigoted than I did before. In fact, they were cowards. They attempted to subvert the constitution’s religious test provision by using the KOC as a proxy for the Church.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris The constitution forbids religious tests. A Wiccan could sit before that committee, &amp; they don’t have to defend their religious beliefs or be required to quit any Wiccan group. I can’t believe that a Pentecostal defends your faith, and you won’t.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris A nominee’s judicial record is fair game...as is their opinion on case law. But calling a Catholic charitable org extremist is outrageous. Their positions are those of the Church. Most members I know join to help others &amp; drink beer. God, let’s roll tanks to crush the lawlessness
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris &amp; other than Roberts, I don’t like any sitting on any bench. That doesn’t mean you get to say that the KOC, which has raised more than $1B for Charity, fought prejudice, the Klan, &amp; Fascists, has “extreme views,” &amp; that they must quit if appointed.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris I don’t know to which sound bite you mean?
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris I despise Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh sitting on any court. So why didn’t they grill them about their religious beliefs during the nomination process? Because it would have both violated the Constitution &amp; been incredibly offensive on national tv. Lower court nominations aren’t watched.
@billysastard1 @SplAdamSage @Wonce_In_A @Bhaal_Spawn @Jacob_Rees_Mogg If it were possible, we would give him to you to keep
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Find an example for me in which a Senator was as disrespectful of a nominee’s religion as the statement, “your dogma is showing.” Imagine the outrage (rightly) that would occur if a Senator said, “your Jewness is showing.”
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Your belief as to whether or not it should is irrelevant, because its only the Catholic nominees that are. There has always been an assumption in this nation that Catholics are different. We’re the largest religion in the nation, yet only 1 out of 45 has been Catholic??
@dmeaser @ParryPierce Except what &amp; how much the president knew. Given the tight circle that he trusts, I can’t imagine a scenario in which he didn’t. However, Mueller is spinning off ancillary investigations to other prosecutors while tightening the noose.
@chrislhayes &amp; once again he makes Jefferson look like an asshole!
@SplAdamSage @billysastard1 @Wonce_In_A @Bhaal_Spawn @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Man, those bastards are everywhere... especially social media .They want NATO gone. In the US, states govern elections...even national. They certify results &amp; choose ballot machine. Shockingly, many haven’t increased security since ‘16. Courts are starting to fix gerrymandering
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris “Your dogma is showing” We’vefought bigotry in the US since its founding. Every major religion is anti-(	abortion, but only Catholic nominees have their faith questioned&amp; attacked. JFK fought this in 1960. As the article points out, our constitution prescribes no religious test.
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Six current members of the Supreme Court are Catholic. It seems odd that each confirmation process including these three senators &amp;. on national tv didn’t include questions about religions. I the article Sen Feinstein is quoted as saying to a nominee ( Tweet 2 of 3)
@skrossa @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @KamalaHarris Speaking as a liberal and someone who opposes the judicial record of these nominees...suggesting that a person’s Catholicism trumps one’s duty to the Constitution is bigotry, &amp; one that has existed in this nation since before the Revolution. (Tweet 1 of 2)

@jesuswept50 @Wonce_In_A @KoparaFallsKid @gdgoz I know, right? I actually lobbied to not get a promotion in favor of a guy who was older. Nobody talks about Gen X. As a Millennial, even I am pissed by some of my fellow millennials who believe that they know everything.
@SplAdamSage @billysastard1 @Wonce_In_A @Bhaal_Spawn @Jacob_Rees_Mogg That is true. The situations are similar in many ways. Has there been an investigation to make sure that Russia didn’t play a large role? They are doing all they can to break the Western Alliance...and Trump has become Putin’s lapdog
@billysastard1 @SplAdamSage @Wonce_In_A @Bhaal_Spawn @Jacob_Rees_Mogg The words of a man who has never had to live with Donald Trump as their president. You are also forgetting that he got more than a little help from Russia. You guys should be afraid, also. If you, our closest ally, were in trouble, I seriously don’t know that he would help

@ClydeHaberman @JoeNBC I was hoping against hope that someone would put a pie in his face!
@CaccioppoliMike @NancyRog11 @AOC @BernieSanders They shouldn’t have responded. Had he declared a Ntnl. Emergency, they should’ve, but they should have said that it was below a response &amp; that they’d, again, be passing bills to protect the border &amp; reopen the govt. that Trump won’t sign &amp; for which McConnell won’t allow a vote
@wjcarter @JoeNBC I’m sure the missle crisis warranted a few minutes, as did Nixon’s resignation speech. Reagan did the right thing after the Challenger explosion, &amp; Bush I told us that we were going to war. There may be a few more, but the others that I’ve either seen or read about seem trite
@People4Bernie @NancyRog11 @BernieSanders It’s more systemic. That theory of finance is taught in every Finance &amp; B-School in the nation. (e.g. many profs, over my &amp; others’ arguments, that mortgage backed securities COULDN’T fail). When you indoctrinate that &amp; “your only duty is to the shareholder, what do we expect?
@BoKnowsNews @NancyRog11 They were laughing at the idea of Donald Trump trying to look presidential
@CNN I completely applaud them for doing this. I only wish that it didn’t take a national emergency for people to show charity.
@tedlieu @NancyRog11 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I always feel bad for Shep Smith...a true journalist at Fox
@jesuswept50 @Wonce_In_A @KoparaFallsKid @gdgoz Well, the poor gen X people got shafted. Baby boomers hung aroun/on for so long that companies hired/promoted my generation over them because we were younger &amp; could be paid less
@MSNBC The hypocrisy
@DLeonhardt @NancyRog11 In fact, Nixon only resigned when the Republican Senator, Howard Baker, told him that he no longer had their support.
@DLeonhardt @NancyRog11 Absolutely. Impeachment is a political, not remedy. It will only work if ~30 Republican will vote to convict. When Mueller drops the bomb that he conspired w/, made $w/, a hostile power, Republicans can’t defend that. He’s the target of 17 investigations. Relax &amp; enjoy the show!
@blinkist Absolutely, I am constantly reading multiple books at a time.
@CBCNews Yeah, that will blow up a cooperation agreement
@sissyroxx I love her dearly, but she can be a bad influence! At least my granddad asks before he pours a drink. Those two have been on a 2nd honeymoon for years. Now she’s back in the Brexit fight!
@RepAdamSchiff Hell, I’m impressed he found it. He rolls into work at 11:00 am, reads nothing, takes a 1:00 lunch, &amp; is out by 4:00. Most presidents age 25 yrs, but he looks like he lives at a health spa. He visits troops in December &amp; has a better tan than soldiers in the desert.
@RepAdamSchiff General Patton, a beloved &amp; oft-quoted hero of the far right specifically said, “Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidly of man.” If that doesn’t work, ask the French about the great Maginot &amp; how well it kept out people on the other side. France lasted 6 weeks!
@tedlieu Tell the Republicans to ask the French about the Maginot Line &amp; then to ask them how well a fixed fortification ( like Trump’s wall) worked at keeping out people on the other side? I think that the French lasted all of 6 weeks once the fighting broke out!

@realDonaldTrump Really? Do you always point your finger to Heaven, invoke the memory of brave soldiers &amp; use the word, “Now” when you mean at a slow, measured pace? Your BFF, Erdogan, after hearing of your “consistent” policy, seems oddly upset after learning this had always been your plan!

@Billbrowder @rohaniroop And Federal courts close in a few days
@renato_mariotti @realmissbeeswax Yeah...we are watching the end of a presidency. Even though Manafort’s team accidentally leaked this, Mueller has now linked the campaign to the Kremlin
@Helenhs @sissyroxx I was surprised that Robert even looked into it, seeing that two district court judges &amp; 2-three judge appellate courts unanimously ruled against “Company A.” It must be of great significance
@philosophrob @gaijingirl2004 I don’t know about the others, but Steve Cohen is a very good man &amp; Congressman. He was one of few who had the guts to vote “no” on the Patriot Act, and has introduced articles of impeachment. I have known him since I was a kid &amp; he was a state Senator. He is the real deal
@TheRynheart @Artbeat53 My brothers both fly for Delta &amp; completely support that letter
@MeetThePress @MSNBC @GeoffRBennett I wouldn’t bet on the judiciary approving
@DanRather My granddad was Charlie Flowers, the Ole Miss player. I just watched the 30x30 show on the ‘62 team. Was it that bad...that much hate? Living in Memphis, I fear little has changed internally. That statue should read, “Ole Miss was, and maybe one day will be.”
RT @DanRather: If you are a network executive, do you carry President Trump's speech tomorrow night live? (Point of reference, Pres. Obama…
@CNN @Rene_MarshCNN And we are surprised why?
@PeterTharos @RachBach007 On behalf of the entire US, I apologize for us exporting many of our worst traits across the border. You must feel like I did when my mom forced me near my sister to contract chicken pox at the same time!
@shaunking @NancyRog11 God bless that man
@DeadlineWH @SteveSchmidtSES The most pathetic part of this to me is the arrogance of a guy like Limbaugh threatening the president over the issue. While I detest Trump, he is POTUS. He could and should crush Limbaugh. To have a radio host dictating US policy is embarrassing.
@NBCNews And Mueller wins again. Most impressively, in the 18+ month of his investigation, nobody on his team has leaked a thing. When Roberts took, in my opinion, the unusual step of staying the contempt order to read briefs, he gave both sides a week. Mueller’s was submitted in 2 days!
@YuriThomas99 @ParryPierce @KFILE Dems would have been smarter to say that they booked the time in the event that Trump took the extra-constitutional step of declaring natl. emergency-then just said that they were going to go back to push legislation to reopen govt. Media would have fact checked on their own
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump They will start with a District Court Judge in DC &amp; then, if necessary, the appellate court. Only then will it reach SCOTUS...unless it is fast tracked
RT @essenviews: Networks should demand to see Trump's speech in advance -- and refuse to air it if it's filled with lies, says CNN analyst…
@EddyCornelis @essenviews @vw_ginna Then they should cancel the entire speech
@ezralevin @chrislhayes Trump shut it down, but I agree that now McConnell is now just as guilty. They are losing votes in the House &amp; Senate &amp; soon the number will be reached for a veto override. At that point, McConnell won’t be able to block a vote
@Jim_Jordan This isn’t the first time that Articles of Impeachment against this president have been filed, Congressman. Like the other times, they won’t reach the floorWhy aren’t you being honest? Do you expect debate on the floor?
@washingtonpost @BexitWesty I hear that Grover Cleveland &amp; Chester Arthur were huge fans!
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump I hope so. First, I worry that they will ask themselves, amid the global rise of right wing populism &amp; isolationism, why another Donald Trump won’t be elected. Second) Related to the first point, these nations are too busy fighting off their own right wing populism
@timmyturmoil @finafyr The networks declined to air a 2014 Obama speech...calling it “overtly political.” Are they expecting this idiot to rattle off the 2nd Gettysburg Address? They should make it a game show...where they paintball him every time he lies.
. Sarah Sanders then ups the # to 4,000, &amp; the VP closes by claiming that 10 terrorist arrests per day were being made at the border. Have these people not heard of fact checking? The real # detained? at the border last year? 6! 41 were detained at the Canadian border! The lies!
So this administration just gets to make up numbers &amp; information now? First the President gives the standard, We have terrorists coming through our border. Then Nielsen claims that CDP has stopped “over 3,000 on our southern border
@JoeNBC &amp; people said that Notre Dame was exposed as a fraud by Clemson?
@CNN @julianzelizer @CNNOpinion I’m looking forward to the train wreck. How many, “this administration has accomplished X more than any other, how many references to job growth, &amp; how many, “you can’t impeach someone doing a great job” comments he will make.
@JuliusGoat @NancyRog11 Again, no gift of financial nuance. For an Uber wealthy earner, they are taxed x% on income up a level, y% (where y&lt;x to the next level,  &amp; z% where z&lt;y&lt;x) over the top level. You pay a blended rate x+y+z in which z=75%.  X &amp; Y are lower rates, so nobody pays 75% of their income
@RepSwalwell Saw you again on tv last night. Get justice for us. A 10 week old can be a handful, but cherish the time. You wake up &amp; they’re no longer babies https://t.co/I1A8T23ujA
@AOC Republicans pine for the “good old days,” ,”simpler time,” ,”the way things used to be.” Well, nostalgic friends. welcome to the 1950s. A Republican presidency, real American excellence, and a tax code that minimized wealth inequality &amp; increased wealth for all classes,
@SteveScalise I’ve seen AOC &amp; universal criticism to her plan (a sign that you’ve got something.) Despite girding a period of low wealth inequality &amp; Econ. growth for all, its criticism is that it won’t incentivize us. That criticism defies history. A M.T.C incents workers to maximize wealth
@SteveScalise Republicans always pine for the “good old days,” ,”simpler time,” ,”the way things used to be.” Well, nostalgic friends. welcome to the 1950s. A Republican presidency, real American excellence, and a tax code that minimized wealth inequality &amp; increased wealth for all classes,
@Strandjunker @NancyRog11 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS She qualified via the same “chain birth citizenship” policy that he is now fighting so hard to do away with.
Perhaps most importantly, income equality &amp; education are the answer for hatred &amp; fascism. I just think that we have to understand that people have been socialized for 40 yrs to expect lower taxes. This will take pragmatic persuasion &amp; inspiration. Saving the world’s a big job!
But I’ve run the Macro #s on the tax plan, &amp; it works...if enforced. Medicare for all &amp; green new deal are key, but education is the silver bullet. The test scores posted by the world’s richest nation are a joke. US students can’t fill med, law, eng, &amp; other grad school openings
@MauiBeerGeek Hey, I agree with you. I look at myself. I started as a Republican at Goldman Sachs, &amp; within 5 years I’m general counsel at a non profit &amp; a DS. I just remember the reaction people had to my rapid transformation, &amp; so I have empathy for those who aren’t quite there
@jinxy51 @Jennybing53 @JuliaEAinsley Presidents have used this lever for 1 of 2 reasons...an actual emergency in a time of war, or 2) expediency to transfer funds when Congress is on board. Were he to declare a crisis now, Congress would sue, &amp; the Supreme Court would decide. I wouldn’t bet on team Trump
@nycsouthpaw @emzorbit It won’t. If he is banking on SCOTUS to  back him, I would consider just how important that Chief Justice Roberts considers an independent &amp; coequal Judiciary to be.
@CBCNews He doesn’t mean “offers US Govt information on corruption” so that we can prosecute...he’s offering Donny a self help manual!
@DLind Not to mention the Congress is still supposed to approve all appropriations. I also wouldn’t like my chances with the judiciary. Moreover, the blatant abuse of power exercised in front of the world is just another log to throw on the impeachment fire
@gaijingirl2004 @RevDrBarber That was my point! I’ve pushed a similar tax plan since I left Goldman Sachs. I am all in on the D.S. Agenda, which is amazing considering that I started as a Republican at GS. I guess that I have tolerance for those that aren’t there yet, b/c most don’t evolve as fast as I did
@ParryPierce Thanks, Granny! They made it home. Those are my mom’s parents who actually moved to Newfoundland, raised kids, &amp; moved back to Ireland. My dad’s family is half Irish &amp; half “pan European.” The surname came from the Isle of Mann. My grandparents called a bit ago. They’re home!
@DearAuntCrabby @asmith702 Can I borrow “twatwaffle”? I’ve been laughing for 5 minutes!
RT @Gustof1966: @JohnCornyn Do your job and open the govt. it’s on you and McConnell.
@ParryPierce @KayKosmos Oh, some of that land has belonged to many of those families since we purchased it from Mexico. What price tag do you think that they would place on us?
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Had Washington known this at Yorktown, he would have told DeGrasse to turn the boats around, sent the boys home, punched Jefferson in the mouth, &amp; handed his sword to Cornwallis!
@ParryPierce Granny, I have to tell you, my own grandmother flew back to Ireland today. She doesn’t use Twitter, so you’re going to have to fill the void!
@TweetingYarnie Yarnie, I am new to Twitter and you guys are crucifying me for liking Beto. I know his voting record, but I see a guy in transformation. I started as a Republican working at Goldman Sachs, &amp; now I am now a D.S. He genuinely inspires people. You can’t fake that
@CBSNews @TeamPelosi @CBSSunday I hope you 77,000 voters in Pa, MI, &amp; WI are really proud. You guys want to play rebel &amp; the whole world goes to shit!
@CrabMama That’s what I’ve been saying!
@Craig_543 @SenatorCardin @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Sorry Craig. This may have been his signature issue, but a) He promised that Mexico would pay for it, &amp; b) he lost the vote by 3M...giving his presidency scant legitimacy &amp; absolutely no mandate. The vast majority of us don’t want this stupid wall!

@KayKosmos If this wall weren’t so bad &amp; stupid on so many levels, a part of me would actually like to see them try. There are over 600 land owners in Texas alone who are going to fight this. The topography is such that they’ll need to build hundreds of miles of roads just to get there
@butterfly4u4eva @TeamPelosi @DianneM65725926 The rest of that squared him with the tanning bed place
I’m ok if we want to wall off Mississippi #NoWallEver

@oliverdarcy @MalcolmNance Damn...when you’re throwing that drunk John Tyler in the mix, that’s saying something!
@MSNBC When did the media exchange the term “walk back” for “flip flop”
@NBCNews When’s the last time that we even checked in on Great Britain. They’ve only been our closest ally for 100 years
@MarkHertling @LisaKeel9 Given Trump’s world view, I’m surprised that he doesn’t retroactively surrender to Mexico &amp; give back their territory
@funder @ponytail7100 Oh, I hear that Fillmore convinced  Tyler and both Harrisons
@JustinBrakeNews @kicranston @JustinTrudeau Damn, did Trump slip up across the border?
@kicranston @ChangePolls I know his voting record, but I see a guy who is changing. I know that I did. I started as a Republican working for Goldman Sachs &amp; now I am basically a social democrat (in a span of only a few years). He inspires people like few I’ve seen. Maybe I see the guy I want him to be
@danpfeiffer @ponytail7100 I’d ask for more than 5 minutes
@Amy_Siskind @ponytail7100 His base will all be watching Fox. I would bet a Golden Girls marathon carries the ratings
@ChangePolls @kicranston Wow...that’s a huge number!
@ChangePolls @kicranston The one quote that I would keep in mind is the statement by Ted Cruz’s campaign manager...”I only know that I feel sorry for anyone that has to campaign day to day against Beto O’Rourke. Even die hard Republicans who couldn’t vote for him loved him”
@davidsirota @kicranston Go Bernie!
@danpfeiffer @SaltyLenore Other than the fact that they sound like idiots
@GotJanie No, he can declare his emergency, but there has to actually be an emergency. Congress has to appropriate funds. If he tries to defy them, the courts will decide. There is no way Trump wins in court. It’s also an impeachable offense to add to the list
@cenkuygur The thing that he doesn’t understand is that, even if he declares the emergency, Congress must still approve appropriations. If he tries to use funds earmarked for another project, there is a dollar limit. I don’t know the limit, but I know $5B exceeds it
@gaijingirl2004 @samhwils His hand has been forced every time
@ewarren @nationalgridus @Usw04 Kick them in the ass, Senator!
@JustVoteBlueUSA @gaelbill His base will all be watching on Fox, so I can’t wait to see the network ratings!
@kateveik @cnalive Send it to Sens Hirono, Harris, &amp; Feinstein. They seem to hate Catholics
@GOP2white4me Love the name, badass grandma!
@gaijingirl2004 @RevDrBarber I agree. However, people have been socialized for nearly 3 generations to believe that taxes should be low. So she is going to need friends with financial gravitas...like Warren Buffer
@allinwithchris @AOC You know, for a bit I was of the opinion that she should get her feet wet...but after hearing that she busted out the tax plan that I have long espoused and watching her fellow Democrats jealousy...I say F it, AOC! Do what you have to do
@KamalaHarris As disgusting as your hatred of Catholics
@DearAuntCrabby @LunaLuvgood2017 She is a human wind up doll. Wind herbup and she continuously talks over the interviewer
@samhwils @gaijingirl2004 Because the few that are in place were automatically triggered by Congressional law &amp; beyond the control of the President.  He has done all he can to ease them. They are about to get hit with more
@RevDrBarber @gaijingirl2004 What were our founders considered?
@joshscampbell @PressSec She was pulling out Paul Revere...they come by land, air, and sea! For some reason I dislike her more than Trump. I just can’t respect a person that volunteers to debase themselves so completely. At least Trump is good for an occasional laugh
@Weinsteinlaw @AllForBirds Bob Mueller is still out there about to pull the whole house down. Then they have to choose whether they are recorded in history as being complicit with a hostile power or cut the chord. I promise that they are all looking for a goood enough excuse that the base will be ok with
@cmclymer @AOC Let’s not make the same mistake...it’s not all males. Some of us were raised as humans
@HeidiNBC @Mimirocah1 We all know that it will be a train wreck. He’ll have anthropological evidence that Atilla the Hun &amp; Gingus Kahn poured over the border
@el_gringo_duhal @AOC @60Minutes Its how you frame the conversation. When you make a business case, you don’t worry about the cash outlays. You focus on the return. It is an investment...not an expense
@ddale8 @LouisLe85627147 Yeah, somehow I couldn’t really imagine a phone call between those two
@NoahCRothman @Morning_Joe @esglaude I saw it...we need more debates like it. We have to address the issue one way or another
@sunrisemvmt @AOC I love her, but I hope that she is careful. They can bring a TON of weight down on her. But...if anyone can take it, it is a girl from the Bronx
@bryanbehar I also think that Chief Justice Roberts, while he has conservative personal leanings, is getting tired of Trump’s attacks on the judiciary &amp; is even wary of Kavanaugh. His main concern is the independence of the judiciary-hence his recent rulings
@bryanbehar Sadly, here in Tennessee, the Devil could run on the Republican ticket &amp; be elected. That said, Lamar Alexander is an old timer...not today’s fringe right winger. I have been lighting up his phone &amp; email for days. Our other Senator is a first term lunatic
@bryanbehar There is an old story about a 1st term Dem Congressman on his 1st day ~50 yrs ago. With an older Dem, he saw a Rep Congressman &amp; said, “So that’s the enemy.” The older Congressman turns him, pointed to a Dem Senator, &amp; said, “No. the Senate’s the enemy.” That’s how it used to be
@lisastark351 Chris Wallace busting Sarah Sanders for lying is like the devil checking Hitler’s resume for leaving off Warsaw!

@noahbudin @JamesTaylor_com Very cute dog!
@activist360 Oh, he will definitely try to declare a national emergency. His problem (other than the fact that there is no emergency), is Chief Justice Roberts. Roberts cares deeply about the independence of the judiciary, and won’t care for Trump’s attempt to make the Court his rubber stamp!
@brianstelter The good news is that we all know that he will make an ass of himself
@brianstelter This is literally CBS’s CEOs first day on the job, so I can cut her a bit of slack, However, if he starts lying, they should pull him

@CharlieSaidWTF They have one huge problem...Bob Mueller!
@NBCNews Mueller wins every battle he fights
@CharlieSaidWTF The key word in that sentence is “should.” The problem with impeachment is that it is a political solution. At the moment, Republican Senators will never convict. However, if Mueller shows that he conspired w/, transacted w/, or made $ w/ Russians...Republicans can’t defend that
@MartinHeinrich As if he cares. I’d be shocked if he knew that we had national parks
@Shadumura @MacBethSpeaks @NancyRog11 @SenSanders Again, I’m on your side. Paygo can be overcome. 1/2 the caucus is moderate. That’s reality...for now. The public is shifting left. But we can’t throw bombs. We meet basic needs...win county, council, &amp; state seats. Show why that which benefits the common good benefits them!
@Shadumura @MacBethSpeaks @NancyRog11 @SenSanders Well, history is a bit more nuanced. However, the battle lines are the same. Urbanites &amp; the educated oppose Trump while rural, white, uneducated voters support him. The “Centrists” that you vilify were the key to the largest Democratic popular vote landslide in 50 years in Nov
@MSNBC @AliVelshi And he waited until now to want to call an emergency
@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH Trump will take credit for that, too!

@realDonaldTrump So you want us to believe that we arrested 4,000 terrorists at the border last year and you DIDN’T declare an emergency? Only your base wants this stupid wall, so you have to subvert the democratic process to get it. You are pathetic
@essenviews As my Sen, you should realize the following: He lost the popular vote by 3M votes &amp; thus has only scant legitimacy...much less a mandate, the majority of the US oppose the wall, &amp; only 25% agree that he should keep the govt shut. So stop being a coward &amp; do your job
@krassenstein @LisaKeel9 Plus my grandmother on a daily basis...&amp; she lives in Ireland
@essenviews So we’ve supposedly captured 3,000+ terrorists at the border in the past year, &amp; had hordes of human traffickers &amp; drugs crossing the border at non points of entry...&amp; he didn’t declare a national emergency? What’s changed his mind now? Did NORAD pick up flying monkeys?
@Turnip2020 @realmissbeeswax Classic
@Emolclause @BexitWesty While articles of impeachment today would certainly pass the House, there aren’t enough Republican Senators today to convict him in the trial. If Mueller proves that he conspired w/, transacted w/, profited from a hostile power, even Republicans will dump him
@CharlesPPierce @mcasper10 The great negotiator, ladies &amp; gentleman!
@BillKristol @ponytail7100 Mick Mulvaney lied? This is the asshole from the “freedom” caucus who wants to tell us what is and isn’t right or wrong. Moving forward, Dem or Rep, we need to vastly reign in executive powers. There is a reason that our founders wrote the powers of Congress in Article 1
@BillKristol @ponytail7100 I particularly liked his use of the term, “military eminent domain.” Having passed the Bar in multiple states I can offer the legal translation: “dictatorship.” It is extra-legal. Bill, you forgot 1 trait...the creation of a 5th column (brown immigrants).
@SRuhle @ponytail7100 @kasie We are far past giving voters a free pass. Juries don’t acquit defendants who employ the stupidly defense. We were taught to think critically, ask questions, &amp; to always be skeptical of elected officials. Let’s educate the most vulnerable &amp; remember that facts &amp; truth matter!
@birdman8272 The hypocrisy knows absolutely no limits. Were your poor little delicate feelings hurt, snowflake?
@birdman8272 For cursing in a bar? My grandmother dropped more F-bombs that day ( she broke out the Irish whiskey)
@AdamSchiff @ponytail7100 Are we to believe that John Adams never dropped a curse bomb in theContinental Congress?
@psychdr100 @kittyupatree Gotta love the party of individual liberty! The only thing more ridiculous than making that cowardly threat is listening to it. Why belong to a political party in America that tells you what to believe
@SassyKadiK @kittyupatree The whole DNA thing was a big mistake, but I started my career at Goldman Sachs, &amp; she terrified them. They spent $millions/yr fighting her. I’m not saying she should be president, but she has a brilliant financial mind &amp; has spent her whole life fighting for economic equality!
@Mean_Adam I read a fairly recent article in which 85% of Americans could name all three “Dancing w/the Stars” judge’s, but fewer than 1 in 3 could name a single Supreme Court Justice. So I’m not surprised. Everyone should travel to a) one of the camps &amp; b) an Allied cemetery in NW France
@KayaJones If he had to piss, I’d find the strength to keep living!
@costareports I just heard the President use the term, “Military Eminent Domain.” Having passed the Bar in multiple states, I can say with high confidence that the legal definition of this term is “Dictatorship.” No statute allows for the military enforcement of civil litigation
@TeaPainUSA @ParryPierce I think that he wants to force an impeachment showdown before the Mueller report is published. Employing emergency powers for a fictitious emergency is exactly the kind of act that SHOULD result in removal from office...but Republican Senators are gutless &amp; his base ignorant

@PreetBharara What in the hell has this young woman done other than that drives everyone so crazy? She is a phony because she busted her ass &amp; went to college? Am I less phony because I share her beliefs...even though I started my career at Goldman Sachs &amp; come from an upper middle class home?
@votewright4wyo @diddymcc @SteveScalise I’ll take Ike for 1,000, Alex. Shockingly, the economy prospered for all, the working class was unionized, wages rose across the board, unions helped people, the middle class grew, &amp;, shockingly, the rich remained rich. Some may lose their private jet...I can live with that
@johnpavlovitz @NancyRog11 God bless America!
@JoyceWhiteVance @ParryPierce Of all his transgressions, ratting out Santa to the 7 year old &amp; looking for a tax break on his child’s Boy Scout registration are the two that truly make him special...oh, cursing &amp; going political at the Boy Scout troupe was also a special moment!
@QuancyClayborne @NancyRog11 Oh, I’m the frenzy, the media has forgotten the fact that the $5B is only a down payment. As for question #2, I’d guess close to $5B

@ryangrim @diddymcc I’m Catholic, &amp; every one of us has criticized the Vatican’s handling of the abuse scandal. If they exported any material goods, I would boycott. I still go to Mass nearly everyday. Am I anti-Catholic?
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Their ratings go up when they have an “evil president” against whom to rail. If not, then let’s skip the middleman and negotiate directly w/ Limbaugh &amp; Coulter
@NBCNews I’ll take a wild guess...no
@cenkuygur This madman in the White House is now talking about using “military eminent domain” to quickly build his crazy ass wall. Having passed the Bar in multiple states, I can tell you that the legal term for that is “military dictatorship.” It has no legal basis!
@davidaxelrod @SaltyLenore @realDonaldTrump Now he’s talking about using “military eminent domain” to quickly build his wall. I passed the bar in multiple states, &amp; the legal definition for that term is “military dictatorship.” There is no legal provision to enforce eminent domain!
@JohnFugelsang @pvdork Just go back to the old Howard Stern tapes in which Trump refers to his own daughter a a “fine piece of ass.” Yet Rev. Falwell Jr says that we are immoral if we don’t support this president. Well, call me one immoral motherfucker!
@costareports This is going to the Supreme Court. His public lies about the nature of the emergency may have been enough to piss off Chief Justice Roberts
@MSNBC @ParryPierce I’ll gladly pay for one to wall off Mississippi!
@MalcolmNance Now the president is publicly speaking of “military eminent domain” as a means of building his wall. Having passed the Bar in multiple states, I can tell you that the legal term for that is “dictatorship.”
@AmoneyResists @asmith702 Now he is talking about imposing “military eminent domain.” While I took my law degree to help philanthropic orgs, I did pass the Bar in 6 states. The legal term for “military eminent domain” is “dictatorship.” Our constitution allows for no such thing
@JMyers1971 @Koboxer2380 @senatemajldr Can some sneak in holy water to ensure that he is even still alive?
@jvgraz @NancyRog11 I am not arguing that she should be president, but I started my career at Goldman Sachs (people change), &amp; she was the only person on earth that scared them. She has spent her entire life fighting for economic equality for all people! That should count for something!
@mrjamesob Can you tweet out your website?
@essenviews He’s been reading the best of Casey Stengel
@thomaskaine5 @diddymcc With all due respect to Sen McCain, I think that Lindsay buried his testacles next to him!
@Marmel @NancyRog11 @AOC Three words...”.Investment, not expense.” We have to speak their language. There are already a shortage of US born Med, Law, &amp; other graduate applicants. We all benefit from an educated, humanized society. When they won’t act out of altruistic reasons, rely on their self interest
@OMGno2trump @ParryPierce Damn, how evil do you have to be for Fox to turn on you? They’re still hoping the conspiracy theories are true so that they can book Hitler on Hannity!
@SpicyFiles @ParryPierce @realDonaldTrump I genuinely feel for you, but every serious economist in the world warned of the craziness of his agenda. Truly, families like yours shouldn’t have to pay for his insanity. I am sorry
@Brasilmagic @Koboxer2380 Two words...Bob Mueller
@CNN To quote my mom’s Carly Simon (I think)”Well, it’s too late baby, now it’s too late”
@briantylercohen @NancyRog11 We have to reframe the questions. An expense is a cost forever lost. These are investments...which are still assets.  These are investments on which we will see great returns. When people can’t see the altruistic reasons, show them the economic return!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Then let’s hang on...by next week, it may be made by rainbows &amp; lollipops!
@RepCohen @jonathanchait Hell, his whole campaign started as a gimmick to start a bidding war for “The Apprentice” between NBC &amp; CBS after he learned that NBC was paying a woman more than him!
@JenniferJJacobs @MalcolmNance Oh, you knew that he was going to do that from day 1...the politicization of the officer’s death, the ridiculous misstatement of facts...he’s building his case. Let’s hope against hope that Republicans in Congress &amp; the Conservative appointed Court pony’s up!
@SenatorReid Regardless of who becomes the next President, Congress needs to act to reign in his/her powers. Our founders never intended to invest so much soverign power in a single person. There is a reason that the powers of Congress is outlined in Article I
@Comey That was quite the revisionist view of history. Exactly from where could he glean that view...not in any Western history book (as if he reads)
@SenSanders He’s laying the groundwork for attempting to utilize his emergency powers
@ReneeLibby2 My policy is to always triple the dosage of whatever they prescribe!
@mrjamesob Try living in the South in the US. Mississippi only officially banned slavery a few years ago &amp; still uses the confederate battle flag as the upper left corner of their state flag. If Trump wanted $5B to wall off Mississippi &amp; Alabama, I’d be all over that
comments &amp; apologize. This could be a great opportunity for you to win over an untold number of Catholic voters. There are many, many Democratic Catholics. Stand up for us! Happy New Year!
(the global Catholic media company) was, the Vatican, the US Conference of Bishops press office, &amp; every Arch diocese in the USA. Nobody wants to hurt the party, but the statements in the article are indefensible. If Senator Harris wants to be President, she needs to own the
Catholics &amp; the Knights of Columbus have fought racism, poverty, the Klan &amp; fascism. In fact, more Catholics have died in service to this nation than those of any religion. Anyway, every KOC chapter in the nation has a copy of this article...as does EWTN
after Kennedy’s famous speech in Houston. Evangelicals can’t fall down without meddling in politics, but Catholics can’t be true to an oath of office because of blind loyalty to the Vatican? Clearly bigotry isn’t exclusive to the Republican Party. As the article points out,
It also quoted similar statements made by Senator Feinstein in 2017. As a Democrat, I would take issue with the judicial record of these nominees...but never their faith. I am guessing that you may also be Catholic. I thought that we put this political anti Catholic bias to bed
Still, I would expect a Democratic President to stand up &amp; call out bigotry wherever it is found. In a Jan 4th WSJ article, a Pentecostal writer had to defend the Catholic Church &amp; KOC from slanderous &amp; bigoted remarks made by Senators Hirono &amp; Harris to a judicial nominee.
@JoaquinCastrotx I’m a big fan, &amp; I have followed your career since the Obama administrarion. My family in TX say good things also. I’m strongly inclined to vote for you, and I would never want to cause problems for the Democratic Party.
@AOC If the word “tax” is not preceded with the phrase, “Don’t worry, Dudley’s on it...so you will pay no,” their eyes glaze over &amp; the electrical activity in their brain drops two bulb watt outputs!
@KristyPerano Did you get the email?
@KristyPerano Will do!
Call out bigotry wherever it exists &amp; from whomever it emanates. If Senator Harris wants to be President, she needs to step up and own what she said, and apologize. Our faith teaches forgiveness.
As mentioned in the article, Catholics &amp; the KOC have long fought prejudice, racial injustice. The Klan, &amp; even Fascists. More Catholics have died in service of this nation than those of any other religion. As much as I used to like and respect these Senators, you should
@JoyAnnReid Why has everyone backed off 1/4 WSJ story of a Pentecostal having to defend Catholicism &amp; KOC from the bigotry of Sens Hirono &amp; Harris (both of whom I greatly respected). As a Democrat, I would have challenged the nominee’s judicial record also...but never their faith
@KristyPerano Tell me about saving this family...can I (people) help?
@drvox @AOC It was 90% under the Republican Eisenhower administration. Guess what? The economy worked for every class &amp; income inequality was at its lowest point ever. The rich were still rich. They just had to get by being less rich. To all you Evangelicals, this is also a moral issue
@KatyTurNBC Wait until the question becomes, “How does an 8 lbs baby expel this much”?
@DerekKilmer2 Thanks for following. I am as new to Twitter as you. My boss made me sign up to tweet back to a new hire years ago, but this is really only my 1st week! How is Congress? Make a friend of my guy, Steve Cohen. Happy New Year!
@gaijingirl2004 @AOC He couldn’t do any worse! It’s like making it into the NFL head coaching club...they just keep getting fired by one team &amp; rehired by another
@SenSanders Read 1/4 WSJ article in which a Pentecostal had to defend Catholicism &amp; the KOC against the bigotry of Sens Hirono &amp; Harris. As your follower, I would attack the nominee’s’ judicial record...not their faith. Bigotry is bigotry. Do right &amp; denounce it!
@SenFeinstein read the Jan 4th WSJ article in which a Pentecostal had to defend Catholicism &amp; the KOC. I also read about your remarks. As a Democrat, I would have been horrified by the nominee’s judicial record...not his faith. You owe an apology to all Catholics!
@AOC @gaijingirl2004 Hard earned? Our CEO was canned from his last gig after company valuation fell by 60%, took an 8 figure severance, &amp; was hired by us (apparently my 4 year old nephew wasn’t available), &amp; makes 7 figures + stock options. I would guess that anyone of us could muster &amp; pull that off
nation’s largest religion? As a Democrat, I would challenge the nominee’s judicial background, also. However, she attacked his faith &amp; implied that Catholics can’t uphold an oath of office. Bigotry is bigotry &amp; should be called out! Peace, Superman!
@IreneGentle Hey Superman, here’s a scoop. Read the Jan 4th article in which a Pentecostal had to defend Catholicism &amp; the KOC from Presidential hopeful, Senator Kamala Harris (whom I admired). Why do evangelicals influence everything &amp; she is given a pass for insulting the
While she would have had my full support, I believe that an explanation of her comments is warranted, &amp; that she owes every Catholic an apology. As a person of color, she should know better.
I would wager that more Catholics, as members of the nation’s largest religion, have given their life in service to this nation. My parents taught me that JFK put the anti Catholic bias to bed after his famous speech. Now Senator Harris will almost certainly run for president.
Still, the anti Catholic bigotry in the U.S. is the largest unspoken bias in the nation. As a Democrat, I would take issue with the nominees’ judicial record also. However, to suggest that Catholics alone are incapable of carrying out an oath of office is shocking.
@TorontoStar You should look at the Jan 4th article in which a Pentecostal had to defend the Catholic Faith &amp; KOC from the bigotry of Sens Hirono &amp; Harris...both of whom I admired. The article correctly observed that Catholics have fought bigotry, racism, the Klan , fascism
@Elise_Jordan great job as an analyst. Being from Memphis, it’s great to see a local woman succeed!
@jaketapper Why has nobody mentioned the Jan 4th WSJ article in which a Pentecostal had to defend the Catholic Faith &amp; KOC from the bigotry of Sens Hirono &amp; Harris. As a Dem, I would attack their judicial record. When, however, does the party of inclusion attack a person’s faith?
@Eugene_Robinson Please read the Jan 4 WSJ in which a Pentecostal (of all people) had to defend the Catholic Faith ( my faith)  &amp; KOC against Sens Hirono &amp; Harris...whom I greatly respected) As a journalist with your integrity, I am asking you to speak out against this bigotry
So question the nominee’s background &amp; past rulings all day long. As women of color, however, Sens Hiromo &amp; Harris displayed the worst in hypocrisy &amp; owe an apology to all members of the nation’s largest religion...millions who are Democrats!
We are far more socially &amp; scientifically open than most. Catholic orders educate US students at every academic level. A Catholic priest was even responsible for the Big Bang Theory. Therefore, we can be trusted to distinguish civic oaths of office from our faith.
the media would have exploded (&amp; rightfully so). Catholics &amp; the KOC have fought racism, poverty, discrimination, &amp; even fascism for years. We fight for social justice, education, medical care &amp; human rights in places to which no other organization would go. At the same time,
Apparently it’s fine for politicians to suck up to evangelicals who constantly live as hypocrites...but Catholics can’t be trusted to honor oaths of office? Sen. Feinstein said to a nominee last year, “your dogma is showing.” Had someone said to her, “you’re acting like a Jew,”
@Morning_Joe You should read &amp; discuss the Jan 4th WSJ article in which a Pentecostal (of all people) speaks out against the anti Catholic &amp; KOC bigotry displayed by Sens Hirono &amp; Harris (both of whom I respected). I thought this bigotry ended after Kennedy’s Houston speech.
@KristyPerano Was up at Cornell a month or two ago watching my godson quarterback the football team. I’m only 13 years older than him, but come May. that is one godchild’s life I can cross off the list!😊
@TeamPelosi Is the one on the left Brett Kavanaugh’s senior yearbook?
@senatemajldr Way to wipe Trump’s ass w/ the constitution. You are supposed to be a leader of a coequal branch of govt! What a joke. Apologies to the good people living there, but to quote the Simpsons...”we had quitters in the Revolution, too...we called them... Kentuckians”
@sissyroxx How’s Italy? Today is the Feast of the Epiphany, so I can finally take down the tree &amp; ornaments, sober up, &amp; ship the grandparents back to Ireland this week😊
@cnalive Did you read the Jan 4 WSJ article in which a Pentecostal, of all people defends the Church &amp; KOC against the bigotry of Sens Hiromo &amp; Harris (both of whom I admired greatly). Are we ever going to defend ourselves, or rely on Protestants. This story should be answered!
@mrjamesob Can’t believe I just James on Net. I don’t know a thing about Brexit, but for our nations’ friendship, we will trade Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, &amp; any 3 Fox News anchors of your choice for James. From what I’ve seen, James’ listeners don’t like facts, so this will be a steal!
@CosmicDarrell Thanks for for following me! What do you have to do to get &gt;3,600 followers (only been “active” on here for 5 days...still figuring out the nuances!” Happy New Year to you!
@NBCNews @NBCOUT A delightful, wonderful man! No wonder Trump &amp; Nikki Haley love him!
To my tens (perhaps dozens) of followers, Happy Feast of the Epiphany. Today is the official end of Xmas &amp;, after today, my grandmother’s 9:00 am -11:00 pm binge drinking! Hopefully, my liver can settle down for a long winter’s nap!
@mrjamesob American who can’t believe I’ve never heard you until today. Keep at it. Facts matter!
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton The fact that you need an explanation speaks volumes. If the president wants to keep his promise to you, have him get Mexico to send a check. The vast majority of Americans oppose this stupid wall. Dems have offered billions to enhance border security...not just his crazy wall
@kyrstensinema Nice job taking the oath on the law book!
@SenSchumer Please read the Jan 4 WSJ article re: the anti Catholic statements made by Sens Hirono &amp; Harris (whom I respected greatly). The judge’s judicial record was bad, but not due to their religion/KOC are to blame. To believe Catholics unable to uphold an oath is despicable
@SpeakerPelosi Madam Speaker, propose to the President to reopen the government and hold a national referendum on his wall!
@funder @asmith702 @realDonaldTrump The problem is that impeachment is a political solution. The articles of impeachment would definitely pass, but he would easily survive the Senate trial. When Mueller shows that he lied about/had business dealings/ conspired w/ Russia, even Republicans will dump him
@ddale8 @asmith702 Not to mention that the Trump campaign was also hit with Obama like, civil fines. Most campaigns are.
@novogratz @asmith702 The Republicans are pacing themselves
@AviAhvee @IMontoyaResists Well, we know there isn’t a national emergency...that narrows it down
@PreetBharara @Jennybing53 He dropped dozens of F-bombs during the briefing that he gave before the press conference

@KevasRobert @asmith702 Nice work, Don
@RepJayapal @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Mitch McConnell may be the most to blame of all. This is happening because the president had a temper tantrum because he can’t persuade most Americans to support his stupid wall via the democratic process. Now McConnell is playing Trump’s bitch by not letting the vote be taken
@montrealsimon @lumin8 In other words, Trump voters
@sarahdwire @asmith702 He used the exact same word multiple times while briefing members of Congress hours earlier
@kurteichenwald @asmith702 @peterdaou Well, she wasn’t on the floor of the House when she called him that. I seriously doubt that she is the first Congressperson from either party to drop the MF bomb on Trump. I agree that while acting in official capacity...sitting in the House during the SOTU address
@Jennybing53 Good for them!
Winning hearts &amp; minds wherever he goes! https://t.co/kr8yxYmll8
@Jennybing53 @realDonaldTrump @SpoxDHS @CNN @TSA @senatemajldr @pelosi Speaker Pelosi passed billsto reopen the government...the same exact bills that passed the Senate unanimously 3 weeks ago. Only 1 man responsible for this. Also, the President said that he can declare a national emergency &amp; just do what he wants...so give him the democracy talk
@the_bernie_bro @gaijingirl2004 @KateAronoff Like I said, I think that my grandmother calls him that &amp; she lives in Ireland.

@gaijingirl2004 @ggreenwald So Donald Trump is the one person on earth in the past 40 years to come up with an answer to a question that wasn’t even asked &amp; that only matches up with a still to be released Putin Govt. propaganda campaign? Calculate those odds
@EWTN please read Jan 4th Wall Street Journal article on anti Catholic bigotry by three US Senators. Ironically, it was written by a Pentecostal.
@cnalive Read Jan 4th Wall Street Journal regarding anti Catholic bigotry by 3 US Senators
@SenGillibrand Call out your fellow Senators for appalling anti Catholic bigotry. We are only the largest religion in the nation. Again, Jan 4 WSJ. I thought only Republicans capable of this kind of hatred.
@gaijingirl2004 @ggreenwald I’m not arguing that. However, we know that Putin is about to release a revisionist historical PR campaign that will claim that the USSR invaded Afghanistan in ‘79 because of terrorism. Other than that not yet released campaign, only Trump has made that BS claim. How &amp; why?
@GershKuntzman @AOC @NYDailyNews It was 90% under Eisenhower
@gaijingirl2004 Paine is in the top 5 of my favorite writers. History will never give him the credit that he deserves for his role in winning the Revolution. Washington certainly did!

@paulkrugman @AOC During Eisenhower’s presidency, the highest tax rate was 90%. We can’t stop with income taxes. We need to raise the shit out of both Estate &amp; capital gains taxes. Republicans expect us to work hard unless Daddy leaves us $50M

@SenSanders Denounce the blatant anti Catholic bigotry shown by Sens Hirono &amp; Harris written about in the Jan 4 WSJ article written by, of all people, a Pentecostal! While I am sure that I this judge’s record also, blaming it by slandering his religion &amp; membership in the KOC is sickening
@SenGillibrand Good for you! As a pres. candidate. I also urge you to read the Jan 4 WSJ article written by a Pentecostal re/ the appalling anti Catholic bigotry shown by Sens Hiriono &amp; Harris. Both of whom I used to greatly admire. Bigotry apparently knows no party limits &amp; should be denounced
@MSNBC @lriordanseville @HRappleye Not to mention the DC grand juries...which means that violent offenders will be released

@SenatorDurbin Oh, we’ve got it Senator...but, as a proud Democrat AND Catholic I was shocked by the Jan 4th WSJ article written by a Pentecostal outlining the anti Catholic bigotry shown by Sens Hirono &amp; Harris...two women that, until now, I greatly admired. I guess bigotry crosses party lines
@chrislhayes The thing that really pisses me off is that these assholes associate themselves with Libertarians. While my views have shifted, I was once Libertarian, &amp; we accepted everyone

@RepJayapal @NancyRog11 We should work around it like the Republicans did...Thrusting a purely progressive agenda (as much as I like it) on a population that isn’t yet ready will backfire. Take a page from the tea party...they masked their agenda. It failed b/c it didn’t benefit the people. Ours does!
@thomaskaine5 Even Republicans wouldn’t stand for an emergency declaration when there is no declaration. They’re trying to pretend that he didn’t say that
@AngelaBelcamino Ironically, it was builtto ensure that large states didn’t crush small states. Now, 30% of the population controls 70%. Founders established a Republic w/ no desire for popular vote We amended the constitution to make a democracy w/o restructuring the Republics mechanisms
@owenl But accurate
@JohnFugelsang @NancyRog11 Yeah...they should add a cognitive &amp; behavioral component to his physical

@chrislhayes @NancyRog11 At which part...his addled rants, manic assertion of facts, his threat to suspend the constitution over an emergency that doesn’t exist to build his wall or his revisionist historical justification of the ‘79 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan...that hasn’t yet been floated by Putin
@michelleinbklyn @NancyRog11 If she had, she may be our next president!
@SpeakerPelosi @NancyRog11 As a progressive &amp; a Catholic, I ask you to please say something to Sens Harris &amp; Hirrono about the anti Catholic bigotry they showed while vetting a judge last month. The 1/4 WSJ details the event. I’m sure the judge was awful...not his religion!
@rolandscahill @NancyRog11 True, but I prefer the prior day’s Cabinet’s Room babble, whichichbwas just a completely incoherent rant in which not a single Cabinet nor staff member had the courage to keep him on the rails. He was just making up history as he went!
@rolandscahill @NancyRog11 Yes, but it was more of a manic stream of lies...unlike the Cabinet Room interview which was just a complete meltdown!
@ParryPierce I know...you are the best, Granny!
No other person on the planet has ever offered that explanation. How, then, did a U.S. President offer it BEFORE even Putin has released that revisionist propaganda to the Russian people? The media is breaking the story. I only hope that we grasp its true severity
Does anyone find it coincidental that our President gave an explanation of The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that can only be found in the world in the revisionist resolution that Putin is going to release next month retroactively claiming that they invaded to fight terrorism
@911CORLEBRA777 @asmith702 Is the big bad right wing really that scared of a 29 year old freshman congresswoman who has been seated for 1 day? She did what you asked. She came from a working class family, worked hard, &amp; succeeded in life. Why aren’t you praising her?
@KevasRobert @asmith702 Like my college coach said, they only run trick plays when they know that they aren’t good enough to beat you
@ImpeachBDevos @finafyr @POTUS And defies facts. We have had larger refuge crises multiple times under the Bush &amp; Obama administration. Somehow we survived. Trump has flirted w/ impeachment, but seizing unconstitutional powers...even Republicans can’t defend. Nobody is left to stop him.
@AngrierWHStaff @asmith702 That is exactly what I have been saying!
@JohnDonisi @KiethBarrett And last year Sen. Feinstein attacked Judge Amy Barrett (who I personally know...and is out there) &amp; her Catholicism. Anti Catholic bias is the most unreported bigotry in America. Is it a coincidence that our largest religion has produced only 1 president in 240+ years?
@JohnDonisi @KiethBarrett Yes. I have never been a member but know many Democrats who are. That group has fought the Klan, Hitler, fascism, &amp; has promoted equality for all citizens. That judge’s crazy views aren’t a result of the KOC or the Church.
@essenviews That WOULD result in impeachment &amp; removal
@NathanLerner @FluffyDoom Don’t forget publicly telling a crazy revisionist history of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that is told nowhere (even most of Russia) or in any stories other than one’s recently begun being floated within Putin’s inner circle
@Green_Footballs @FluffyDoom 80% of the nation can’t name a single Supreme Court Justice...why would they understand the Emergency Powers Clause. No Repubublican could defend that, &amp; he would be removed if he seriously suggested it
@JohnDonisi @gagoldfish @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett Yeah...we’re on the same side of this argument. I was, however, shocked to see Sens Hiromo &amp; Harris (both of whom I greatly respected) attacking a judicial nominee’s Catholicism (Jan 4 WSJ). I’m sure that I hated his judicial philosophy, too, but religious bigotry has no place!
@JohnDonisi @gagoldfish @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett I couldn’t agree more...although it isn’t as if the Irish were living a lavish lifestyle. They were considered by most to be on par w/ nonwhites
@JohnDonisi @gagoldfish @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett It was the Irish potato famine of the early 1870s that sparked those laws. The Irish were treated &amp; looked upon as lowly as many look upon Hispanic immigrants today. They may have walled off Ellis Island had this administration been in office
Its all fun &amp; games playing football w/ the nieces &amp; nephews in the house until someone gets stitches (again)! https://t.co/kEbbXSbmoJ
@JohnDonisi @gagoldfish @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett Mom’s 1 &amp; 2 generations ago...one via Newfoundland. Dad’s has been here since early 17th century (some of the few Catholics in the 1600s). Dad’s paternal family, however, is from Isle of Mann. W/o question, however, we were raised Irish Catholic (2 bros &amp; 1 sister).
@Cluelesscomedy3 No, I think that you are right.  I look at how we responded to 9/11&amp; was uplifted. Then the government mucked everything up by invading Iraq. The WWII soldier wasn’t just a military volunteer, they were school teachers, &amp; farmers, &amp; everyday citizens...+ the national war effort
@Cluelesscomedy3 Yes. I do. I often wonder if our generation would have that kind of courage
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs @KimDotcom If he weren’t a coward, he would be willing to go to jail rather than hide out like a coward in an embassy. Many real journalists have willingly gone to jail (not sought cover in a foreign industry) to protect sources. They weren’t afraid to go to jail over their beliefs
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs @KimDotcom So our national intelligence community pushed us to the brink of war with Russia over nothing?
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs So give up his source
@Cluelesscomedy3 They were definitely bad mfrs. I wouldn’t have wanted to cross their path as a NAZI or Fascist!
@SenFeinstein Senator- just read a WSJ article documenting the anti-Catholic bigotry recently expressed by Sens Hirono, Harris &amp; you! Millions is Catholics are Democrats. I had such great respect for all 3 of you. It turns out that you are all classless bigots. Shame on you!
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs I think that it would take courage for him to come out of a cushy embassy and go to jail rather than give up his source
@AriFleischer I hope you run this on your show. I am a progressive democrat who criticizes Fox News for covering up things like this. You can be progressive and Catholic, &amp; their slander is indefensible. Bigotry is bigotry. We shouldn’t engage in hypocrisy. We are the nation’s largest religion
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs Assange, courage? Bigger joke. Real journalists have gone to jail to protect sources. He is a coward. If you have exonerating evidence, make it public. Pleading a coward’s case with me on Twitter doesn’t help him
@SenKamalaHarris Senator, I had such great respect for you &amp; even supported a presidential run until I read your WSJ slander against Catholicism. As a WOC, I you should fight all bigotry. Shame on you! If you have any decency, apologize. I have lost all respect for you!
@maziehirono Senator, had such great respect for you until I read your WSJ slander of Catholicism. You should be ashamed &amp; apologize! Would you rather we be mindless drones like evangelicals who support Trump? You are a bigot!
@gaijingirl2004 @samhwils @AOC @CynthiaNixon @NomikiKonst @SusanSarandon She has a truly brilliant financial mind &amp; I can personally tell you that Wall Street feared her to the tune of millions/year. They never feared Bernie Sanders. We are agreeing on this. I just respect anyone who.scares GS into spending millions to fight you
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs It matters if you have the proof that you claim to have. Robert Mueller is a law &amp; order guy who is the last person on earth influenced by politics. If he is innocent, he will be fine
@gaijingirl2004 @samhwils @AOC @CynthiaNixon @NomikiKonst @SusanSarandon Again, I take your point, &amp; I don’t plan on supporting her presidential campaign. She would make an excellent Treasury or even HUD Secretary. I just don’t believe that her character needs to be impugned
@NOcorruptionUSA @melodijoy @AssangeMrs If he’s innocent, then come out of the embassy.
@AriFleischer Anti Catholic bigotry is the most unspoken prejudice in this nation. I had great respect for both Senators...which is now forever gone. Who would have guessed that two WOC would show such bigotry. I congratulate the author for her defense &amp; for a fine piece!
@chriscereza @Cluelesscomedy3 I agree...perhaps with the exception of Kavanaugh.
@TheRickyDavila @Cluelesscomedy3 That’s my Congressman...getting it done, “Memphis Mafia” style!
@gaijingirl2004 @samhwils @AOC @CynthiaNixon @NomikiKonst @SusanSarandon I’m not arguing that she should be president, but at the same time...is it fair to throw out a lifetime of work over one vote? I just respect her...that’s all
@gaijingirl2004 @MARCANDERSONNWO Not if there is a groundswell of support. We just need to remember that not everyone is there yet. Hell, I was a Republican. People will come around if we show why policies are in their best interest!
@hardball What more does he have to do. Start shaming Republican Senators
@KathyLeone12 I have regurgitation in my valves, &amp; I run marathons...but by all means, follow your cardiologist’s advice
@tedlieu @NancyRog11 @realDonaldTrump You lost the popular vote by 3M votes, &amp; only won by pulling the shadiest inside straight in political history with help from Russia. You haven’t exactly done much to expand your toothless base
@AriFleischer I believe that she is talking about Trump’s folly-a wall from sea to sea.
@girlsreallyrule Cut her some slack, I heard worse from my family on New Years when grandma broke out the Irish whiskey!
@RepAdamSchiff I thought that it was ignorance until I realized that he was parroting Putin’s revision of history
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne Blah Blah Blah
@SenAlexander And as my Senator, you should realize that you have a duty to act as a coequal branch of government. You voted for this two weeks ago! You are already bleeding Senators. I respect you, Senator. We didn’t elect you to obstruct! Show courage!
@CTVNews Damn, you know it’s bad when the Canadians get mean
@AliVelshi @MSNBC All those December graduations flooded the job market
@TSN_Sports Kick their Commie asses!
@CharlieSaidWTF @realDonaldTrump And when Andrew Johnson is in the running, that is sad!
@BexitWesty Am I the only person that REALLY dislikes this woman. It is as if you wind her up, &amp; she just keeps talking
@thehill @Koboxer2380 Good for you, Senator!
@AndrewGillum @SpeakerPelosi Run for something...we need you!
@GotJanie That may have been the most sad &amp; pathetic 3 minutes of a White House press conference that I have seen. Trying to steal the spotlight from a co-equal branch of govt. is bush league!
@SenatorDurbin Its not hhis fault, I think that he may have actually passed away 20 years ago!
@davidsirota @gaijingirl2004 Great piece!
@NoFascistLies @gaijingirl2004 The Republicans ignored paygo to pass their tax cut, so if there is a groundswell for Medicare for all, it won’t matter
@CNNPolitics @gaelbill Did someone change the definition of success while I was asleep?
@RepSwalwell @RepKatieHill @AyannaPressley Even better than the majorority is the cohesion between them!
@kylegriffin1 @Koboxer2380 If we can wall off Mississippi &amp; Alabama, I’m in!
@NicolleDWallace @realDonaldTrump Oh, I’m pretty sure that they had that file on the desktop screen since day 1
@realDonaldTrump How about for justifying the 1980 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan using the Kremlin’s reversion of history. For someone who didn’t collide with Russia, you interact with &amp; defend them more than any president in history! Nobody will miss you if you want to move there!
Be a man, stand up to Limbaugh &amp; Coulter, &amp; open the government! https://t.co/19iCjsk8rg
@Lawrence @CNN I am a practicing Catholic, &amp; will trade him to anyone for a late round future draft pick!
@NicolleDWallace You are our favorite Republican (I worked at Goldman Sachs &amp; used to be one, too) Now I am sliding increasingly left, am general counsel for a 501c3 &amp; sleep like a baby. Hope that you had a great Xmas &amp; New Year!
@realDonaldTrump Stay off Twitter, stand up to Coulter &amp; Limbaugh, &amp; open the government. You’ve already broken your promise...Mexico isn’t paying for a wall ( don’t insult us with the indirect payment via a trade agreement). 800,000 citizens have no job. Be a man &amp; act presidential!
@samhwils @gaijingirl2004 @AOC @CynthiaNixon @NomikiKonst @SusanSarandon Whatever Warren’s flaws may be, she has spent her life working for economic equality. When I was at Goldman Sachs, she truly terrified them. They &amp; all of Wall St. spend millions/yr fighting her. She may not be worthy of being president, she has always fought for us.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump For all his evil, Hitler was much more intelligent than this president. For that matter, so is my 4 eat old nephew that just woke up me!
@CharlieSaidWTF Right there with you, Charlie!
@AOC I’m a Tennessean &amp; a constituent of Rep Cohen. He is a good man &amp; will be a good friend! Keep kicking them in the ass!
@diddymcc @HuffPostPol Wow, after that Oval Office meeting, I wasn’t sure Pence wasn’t just cardboard
@Cluelesscomedy3 Yes, I know of Darby’s Raiders (huge history buff)...spec op group operating out of the Mediterranean theatre
@Cluelesscomedy3 Sorry- Grandmother fed me one too many Bloody Marys yesterday. I fell asleep with phone in hand. The woman is a menace! From the way Trump speaks, we would have been fighting w/ the fascists
@IreneGentle @TorontoStar Oh...and do you have a bunch of toothless idiots as we do here that believe the media to be the enemy of the people?
@rules_speedy Me neither. I’ll ask my 5 year old nephew to help me
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube I have a feeling that Mueller’s report will result in both!
@rules_speedy You would think that a web content based delivery service would anticipate this issue!
@IreneGentle @TorontoStar Ok...what called you to journalism? My mom was a budding journalist before the 4 of us were born. One of my majors at Notre Dame was Eng Lit w/ emphasis in creative writing. I went another way. What do you love&amp; hate about it &amp; do all Canadians believe Americans are batshit crazy
@MARCANDERSONNWO @gaijingirl2004 The Republicans ignored Paygo to pass the tax cut, so it isn’t really an impediment.
@USASOCNews @Cluelesscomedy3 According to our President, they were suckers
@Zioerdal The deplorables
@duty2warn @Jennybing53 Oh, without question. Ridding the nation of him will be more of an exorcism than an impeachment
@adamcbest @Cluelesscomedy3 Oh, now that they have discovered that Reagan supported immigration, they downgraded him from “truly evil” to just “fiscally diabolical w/ human like qualities.”
@RepAdamSchiff @Cluelesscomedy3 I have a law degree. Can I sign up? I will work for free! Rep. Cohen is my Congressman. Not many Tennessean Democrats get to make a difference!
@the_USO @Cluelesscomedy3 Thank you!
@Jim_Jordan @WarrenDavidson Wall off Mississippi &amp; Alabama instead &amp; you have a deal!
@CharlieSaidWTF Oh, he swallowed!
@IreneGentle @TorontoStar I knew there was a reason that Canada was safe and polite!
@SecNielsen You have been offered billions for more agents, technology, etc. you had a $25B deal twice &amp; your boss crawfished on the deal. Nobody trusts him. That’s on him!
@adamcbest @FluffyDoom They want to shrink the size of government small enough to fit in the bedroom
@lynnv378 @FluffyDoom Good on her!

@IreneGentle @TorontoStar Are any of you Superman?

@ohbaby54387697 @Cluelesscomedy3 Good luck! Maybe PJ or Skee will run the campaign!
@NBCNews Good for the Holy Father! While I find any single case of abuse abhorrent, Protestant ministers &amp; the public molests @ a higher rate. The data is public. This Pope can’t “shut it down.” He can only fix the problem...&amp; good on him for not hiding from it
@hardball @RepTimRyan Of course not. Their constituents (justly) don’t want their private border land seized by the government for &amp; the rest of it devalued by a crazy wall
To my 10s of followers...I am only days into this brave new Twitter world, but can I do anything to stop tweets/stories disappearing mid-read only to have them replaced by new ones?
@NYinLA2121 @asmith702 Hey...gas station sushi isn’t bad in a pinch!
@Franklin_Graham As a Catholic, I am used to the hypocrisy of some (certainly not all) evangelists. You however, are a special breed. I know that you don’t think that we read the Bible, but let me take a stab in the dark...Matthew 25:31-42
@Amy_Siskind @asmith702 I think that you would be surprised at how many legal experts agree that a sitting president can be indicted under seal. As a lawyer, I believe that. It stops the statute of limit clock from running down. It is decidedly unclear if he can be prosecuted while in office.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump But you had to enjoy watch a president completely melt down on national tv!
@Janwithay @asmith702 @maydaymindy9 Oh, the monster at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave isn’t going anywhere w/o a fight, &amp; we are 2 years away from a shot at Senate Control...but I feel better than I did yesterday!
@RepCummings @asmith702 Good on you, Congressman! I am one of Rep. Cohen’s constituents from Memphis...a rare blue oasis surrounded by a desert of blue! Best of luck to you, &amp; keep kicking them in the ass for us!

I’m down with you! https://t.co/8cPNBbSwXJ
@Fluffula Yes, my white, upper middle class upbringing was a constant fight for life. Once, my mom dropped us off in a BLUE Range Rover. The indignity of my parents wanting to instill in us appreciation for what we had &amp; the brutality of them making us volunteer to expose us to all people
What guys think of Tim Ryan from Ohio. I’m new to the progressive cause, &amp; he may not be Bernie Sanders, but he’s from Ohio...the part of the country in which Trump has to pull an inside straight flush or has no chance. He certainly has passion
@_waleedshahid @AOC @ryangrim Certainly not John Boehner!
@kampeas @jaketapper I keep going back to what about this young woman, who did what every Republican claims that they want by working hard &amp; being elected to Congress before 30, scares people so much that they spend every waking minute trying to demonize her before she is even seated!

@Jk67Joan @FluffyDoom As a fellow Catholic, I am right there with you. I chalk it up to righteous anger. Can you believe that, during that deranged Cabinet Room diatribe, he actually invoked the Vatican’s name to justify his wall? Our faith embraces refugees, the poor, &amp; the sick
@JohnnyBlkshrt @ShelbyKStewart Hey Jerry, as a Catholic, I know that you don’t think that I know the Bible...but I’ll take a flyer on Matthew 25:31-46
@krassenstein @CarolKl87912520 If #s 2 &amp; 4 are correct, I’ll call it a good year
@Jk67Joan @FluffyDoom I feel bad for saying that, &amp; I wouldn’t if Trump had taken a hard line towards Russia just once!
@SecNielsen Excellent, tender your resignation!
@SecNielsen @DHSgov The pirates...don’t forget the pirates!
@Jk67Joan @FluffyDoom Let his ass enjoy Russia for awhile
@dandrezner @jaketapper Whatever else you think of her, she has fought her entire life for economic equality &amp;, while I was at Goldman Sachs, she scared the shit out of them...making them &amp; every investment bank spend millions fighting her. I know she’s made mistakes, but she’s fought like hell for us
@KUTV2News Does, “who cares,” qualify as an answer?
@brithume @ReaganBattalion No, it is the rest of decent, civilized humanity that takes issue with his character
@SenatorBaldwin Even though I am from Tennessee, we Democrat’s down here rarely experience victory...so congratulations!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston And the wealth just keeps snowballing upwards!
@KathyLeone12 Enjoy!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston It truly is a different, sickening world that they somehow manage to normalize
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Still...if I’m being completely honest...I think from time to time about how much I would be worth had I stayed...I guess that makes me human. I have much more than most &amp; I want to give back
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston No shit...to show the arrogance of Goldman Sachs...they wouldn’t accept clients worth less than $50M. The sad thing is that I don’t think that most everyday people realize just how many people have that kind of wealth &amp; pay a much lower tax rate...if they even pay taxes
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I shouldn’t have let myself get in the situation. I initially saw devising investment strategies/pricing derivatives as an academic puzzle. I liked the challenge. Now I am general counsel for a 501c3 (non-profit), I like myself again, &amp; sleep well at night.
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Oh, nothing used to piss me off more than having a billionaire call me after a bad market day &amp; whine about how much money they had lost
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston It all came to a head when I was already feeling like the world’s biggest POS, &amp; they asked me to implement a strategy that was so aggressive that I had gone to an in-house counsel that I trusted...&amp;, as I knew, it crossed the line. So I refused...they used it anyway...I quit
@cmclymer @MonicaMonicawt1 Who in the hell were the 12%?
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Oh, the poor clients are just trying to have a secure retirement. Granted, I had less respect for our clients as they were all worth hundreds of millions. I have no problem with that in and of itself...it’s the ones that asked me to help them to operate in the “gray” areas
@DemWrite @gaelbill @SenMajLdr No offense to the many good people who live there...but to quote the Simpsons, “Lisa, we had some quitters in the Revolution, too. We called them...Kentuckians”
@NoahCRothman @Elise_Jordan Don’t forget the soybean market whose sales to their single largest supplier have fallen to 0 units/month/qtr/yr/forever
@MikeDorning @ToluseO And this surprises us why?
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I agree...that’s why it’s so hard to reconcile that behavior with a woman who fearlessly goes toe to toe with investment banks who spend millions per year just to fight her
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Wow, we did come from similar backgrounds. I can’t begin to tell you the immoral, unethical, &amp; illegal schemes that I saw go down at Goldman Sachs. Then they just parked their $2B of bailout money on the balance sheet as cash/cash equivalents. That’s when I knew that I had to go
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I hear you...I’m not entirely sure that she’s qualified to be president. Her entire life has been Finance...until she became a Senator. She does have have a brilliant mind, &amp; a lifetime working for economic equality counts for something. She’s only voted w/Trump 13% of the time
@sissyroxx My grandparents still live there, so I’be been eating potatoes since birth. I love Italy. I have visited at least a dozen times. I’ve always had more of a European personality. How long have you been there?
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I believe that we all make mistakes (some admittedly huge), but that we aren’t defined by them. I started at Goldman Sachs as a Republican &amp; 7 years later I am well on the way to Democratic Socialism. I was a very socially liberal Republican &amp; never an asshole, but still...
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I hear what you’re saying, but she has fought Wall Street for working/middle class families &amp; the young her entire life. When I was at Goldman Sachs, she scared the shit out of them. She wants economic equality &amp; has a brilliant financial mind. She would be a great Sec. of Tres.
@sissyroxx I am a Tennessean myself. Since I lost my fiancé in a car accident, I have been seriously considering moving to Ireland. How did you wind up over there?

@funder @Koboxer2380 @TheDemCoalition And Reverend Graham Jr. just yesterday mentioned to evangelicals that it is immoral to support this man!
@sissyroxx So you really are Italian?
@ElastigirlVotes @ShelbyKStewart @MSNBC @tizzywoman @Dobby201765 @LiberalVenom @B52Malmet @TrinityResists @BatmanResist @MatthewWolfff @axidentaliberal @TheSWPrincess @jomareewade At least he isn’t the typical Trump voter that gladly votes against their own self interest
@philosophrob @Liberalthelorax Paygo didn’t stop the Republicans from passing their tax cut. It is an inconvenience...not a deal breaker
@sissyroxx So where in this crazy country do you live?
@SenAlexander It is a great country. Now, Senator, help end this crazy border wall madness. Reinforce walls at ports of entry &amp; utilize tech. The people don’t want the wall or the shutdown...&amp; that crazy diatribe in the Cabinet room didn’t help. Am I the last moderate Republican on earth?
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump He plead guilty to ~16 counts and to acting as a foreign agent. He owed millions to a Russian arms dealer (who aren’t known for keeping an eye on the prime interest borrowing rate) while being campaign manager. Should we just have just released him ROR?
@NBCNews While I am disgusted by the abuses &amp; offer no excuses, Protestant ministers abuse (&amp; cover) at a higher rate. The data is public, yet blame seems to only fall on the Catholic Church. The offenders should be punished to the fullest extent of the law...but people aren’t the Church
@sissyroxx I hear you. No judgments from me. I struggled with my Catholicism (faith) for many years. I finally came to peace with it. If I’m wrong...it won’t really matter. I like that we believe that acts of charity &amp; love for others is necessary. We can’t be evangelical hypocrites!
@realDonaldTrump Then why are you asking us taxpayers to build your idiotic wall?
@CharlesMBlow @MalcolmNance At least it is in plain sight now of Congressional oversight committees
@KatieBoWill @JimLaPorta He’s probably asking where Syria is located...&amp; taking lunch orders
@PatTheBerner Well, the Republicans didn’t let a little thing like paygo stop their massive tax cut. It’s really more of a minor nuisance than a hindrance!
@sissyroxx So, guessing from your page...you’ve left your Italian Catholicism?😇
@dandrezner @finafyr If our CEO had started babbling like he did yesterday, he would be on a 72 hour hold!
@TODAYshow @SashaMinsk1 @NancyPelosi But he supported the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan &amp; if not for those damned bone spurs, would have made a hell of a General!
@sissyroxx One of my three best friends’ last name is Fioranelli. I’ve been a frequent guest for Sunday dinner since childhood. Mrs. Fioranelli makes from scratch &amp; hand rolls her own pasta. Thank God I’m a marathoner or I’d have had heart blockage by 20!
@juliaioffe @rohaniroop She pleaded guilty to espionage &amp; took a cooperation agreement. His detention is clear retribution. State Department policy is to work w/o media when negotiating release of a citizen.
@sissyroxx Oh, I have many close Italian friends...and they seem to have a clinical need to feed as many as possible😊!
@gaelbill Anyone following ppolitics since the 60’s...I want to hear what they say!
@sissyroxx Oh she busts out the corn beef &amp; cabbage &amp; makes the best potato soup that you will ever have!
@essenviews Yeah, they love to claim to be strict constructionists yet don’t read the convention notes. Anti federalists hated lifetime appointments to tyranny. Moreover, judges hold office during “good behavior.” That term was left intentionally vague...leaving its definition to Congress!
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump My great grandmother remembers the economy &amp; wages growing for all, &amp; she &amp; paying  a ~60% income tax. They never complained. As she said, she wanted a community of people who could be well educated, find a good paying job, &amp; be treated with respect. She still does!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I hear you. It seemed a little contrived to me. He seems like the last person on Earth to engage in that behavior. I hope that people don’t buy into it. What’s your opinion of Elizabeth Warren?
@sissyroxx Seriously, growing up in an Irish Catholic family, the holidays (aka drinking) don’t end until the Feast of the Epiphany (Jan 6th) I love my grandmother to drather, but she’s become a bad influence😊
@sissyroxx Well, I’m on vacation until Tuesday...I can probably squeeze one in if my Irish grandmother who is visiting doesn’t keep coming up with new holidays (e.g. Boxing Day) as an excuse to force feed us Irish Whiskey shots!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston True...I think that I have aged 20 years under this presidency!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston You make a great case...definitely one I could strongly support. BTW...what was that report on the news about women being assaulted &amp; paid less during Berne’s last campaign? Anything to it or slander?
@sissyroxx I remember reading “Understanding Power” by him years ago. I loved his writing. I will grab a newer book. Any suggestions?
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Very informative article...and it kills me because he is so damned inspirational. Do you think that Tulsi is ready? I love Bernie but worry about his age...not for campaign related reasons...but that the job may kill him. Presidents age 20 years in office
@Jennybing53 He was probably thinking, “this never happened at Boeing.” The funniest thing about the people in that room is that a) they aren’t Senate confirmed, b) are about to be under congressional investigation, or c) both!
@costareports But he put on one hell of a show in the Cabinet room yesterday. If our CEO had gone on that rant, he’d be on a 72 hour hold
@SenBlumenthal I hear you, Senator, but, thus far, every Cabinet member in this administration has been crooked, &amp; this guy basically wrote an unsolicited amici’s brief.
@GraysonBarnette @IMontoyaResists Its a pretty damned big issue. If he does nothing more than Force mainstream candidates to act, he is a true Patriot!
@costareports After that Cabinet Meeting yesterday (with the weird poster on the table) in which he babbled incoherently, her concerns are well founded
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston One reason that I have hope that he can change is that I did. I started at Goldman Sachs and am now we’ll on my way to Democratic Socialism. Which candidates do you like?
@sissyroxx I will do that. I am an avid reader...and my siblings &amp; friends will attest to my observation that we are becoming a nation of dumb people. 90% of citizens can name every judge on Dancing w/ the Stars but less than 20% can name 1 SCOTUS Justice. And these people vote
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Also, while I definitely agree that Beto isn’t progressive enough yet, he has empathy for others, isn’t a narcissist, &amp; and doesn’t demonize races of people. It’s time to reign in executive power anyway. I see him allowing Congress to exercise their constitutional duties
@sissyroxx You really have to wonder how someone comes to learn that kind of hatred. It escapes me
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I hear what you are saying, and I may be wrong...but I see a man in transformation. Robert Kennedy was on McCarthys staff and ended up marching with Dr. King &amp; Chavez. People can change, &amp; I see a man who truly inspires people. That said, my eyes are wide open as we go forward!
@CBCNews This will be a fair trial!
Could Matt Whitaker had his nose any further up Trump’s a** at that crazy Cabinet meeting yesterday? I especially loved that creepy poster sitting on the table in front of Trump as the Pres ranted. If our CEO devolved into that kind of inane babble, he would be on a 72 hr hold!
@TheLastWord He “would”? Did anyone roll the tape for him after yesterday’s Cabinet meeting?
@sissyroxx Not a problem. They’ll claim that they’re just misunderstood...but those little quirks like white nationalism, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, hate speech, &amp; violence just somehow make me think that I understand more than I want!
@trappercreek @SenJeffMerkley Excellent idea, but with the average donation bringing a 76,000% return &amp; a cushy job waiting for the legislator after office, it truly may take a groundswell of grassroots activism to end this
@DrDenaGrayson The scariest/saddest part of all is that is that she had the talent to do her residency at such an elite institution as the Cleveland Clinic
@ConcernedofTW Oh you have to tell me of the political situation in Great Britain, because we’ve gone batshit crazy over here!
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston I do like Tulsi...she’s great...but I am going to suggest a different candidate who isn’t progressive enough YET (but can get there) and flat out inspires people...Beto
@sissyroxx love the page...I have a bit of an issue with NAZIs &amp; fascists myself. If only all of us felt that way!
@CamilleHarper12 Oh, I don’t believe that it is just talk
@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Oh, I love Bernie. He was my overwhelming choice in ‘16. I am just thinking of him. He will be in his 80s if he wins during his 1st term. That would make him a decade older than our oldest president. I just don’t want to kill the man.
@PhilMickelson Right back at you, Phil! Best of luck this year!
@maziehirono Good luck tomorrow, Senator...kick them in the ass for us!
@RepMaxineWaters congresswoman, I’m a Tennessean &amp; constituent of Rep Cohen. I just want to wish you well &amp; best of luck in the majority! One request...clean up the corruption!
@tedlieu I’m a Tennessean &amp; a constituent of Rep Cohen. Just wanted to say that I enjoy the tweets, wish you good luck in the majority, &amp; ask that you keep kicking them in the ass!
@RepAdamSchiff I’m a Tennessean &amp; a constituent of Rep Cohen. Just want to wish you luck...&amp; ask that you simply uncover the truth!
@maddow Great interview w/ Sen Warren. I remembered why my old firm Goldman Sachs was so afraid of her. She runs intellectual circles around most, &amp; her sincerity is clear. If you have her ear, ask her to just be herself &amp; the youth will respond. No need for staged social media
@ewarren Watched Maddow &amp; remembered why my old firm Goldman Sachs was so afraid of you! Great interview! Just be yourself, &amp; you will run intellectual rings around people...&amp; the public (even youth) will see how much you care! Even though my TN vote will be wasted, It is yours!
@RealJobsWexford Thanks! I will read these! How does the work visa/path to citizenship work?  Does Ireland allow dual citizenship?
Watched Maddow and remembered why my old firm Goldman Sachs was so afraid of Elizabeth Warren. She runs intellectual circles around Trump, has fought for working/middle/class &amp; youth her whole life. She should just be herself &amp; not make dumb social media attempts to court youth
@McFaul @Mimirocah1 That old saying, “Better to remain silent &amp; thought a fool than open one’s mouth &amp; remove all doubt” comes to mind.

@gaijingirl2004 @kicranston Bernie would have destroyed Trump &amp; taken half of his base. Now I only worry about Bernie due to his age (not merely b/c of the # or think that he won’t connect with young voters), but because of the toll that it takes on a person. The presidency aged Obama &amp; Bush 20 years
@David4Progress @kicranston I hear what you are saying, but look at Bobby Kennedy. He started as an attorney on McCarthy’s staff and ended up marching with Dr. King &amp; Cesar Chavez. I still believe that people open to new experiences &amp; information can change &amp; evolve...as did Dr. King &amp; Mr. Chavez!
@sjredmond @finafyr I’d go with either his claim that that the Soviet Union was justified to invade Afghanistan
@essenviews People are just figuring this out?
@SenSherrodBrown Intro Duce a constitutional amendment  eliminating paid lobbyists, directed donations, PAC &amp; corporate lobbying ( with audits to ensure that nothing crooked is taking place) If one thing can unite the citizenry, it’s eliminating corporate control of govt!

@KatyTurNBC In the immortal words of Pinto in Animal House, “Forget it, he’s rolling!”
@EdKrassen @finafyr And he neglected to mention that those walls around the Vatican were 9th &amp; 15th century technology...much less that the Church takes &amp; helps refugees...not lock the gates
@soledadobrien @asmith702 So much babble flowed out of his mouth that the nuclear codes need safe keeping. That was the worst thing - also he’d be a great general (bone spurs!), is most popular Rep. Pres. ever, took credit for spot oil price, &amp; used the Pope to justify wall, &amp; he changed Iran! God help us
@DearAuntCrabby @Abhinary @realDonaldTrump Tell it, Auntie!
@SenKamalaHarris @asmith702 Perhaps mention that Trump’s Folly (aka the wall) would require seizing Native American land. Do we really want to be party to that again?
@Blue_Sunflowers @SenJeffMerkley Agreed, but I think that the idea of a money free Congress could be just as popular in red states. Moreso, perhaps,  as the 501c3 (e.g.)for which I am counsel lobbies on the farm bill, but we can’t make nor direct donations. We have to argue to Congress simply on a bill’s merits.
@trappercreek @SenJeffMerkley I completely agree that it’s a tough road...but there’s a wave of economic populism sweeping blue states...and I think that this is an idea that rank &amp; file red state citizens can get behind...it benefits 95% of the nation
@RealJobsWexford I love hurling! I tell people about it all of the time. So perhaps you can answer...after the Celtic Tiger, what is the cost of living there? I would happily take less money if I didn’t have to eat into my investments...which I want to put in trust for nieces &amp; nephews.
@Blue_Sunflowers @SenJeffMerkley There has been a popular backlash against gerrymandering, &amp; the Republican Party lost 300+ state legislature seats &amp; multiple governorships
@trappercreek @SenJeffMerkley Agreed...but if the court wants to usurp the legislature’s role, a constitutional amendment could fix that problem. I think that it would be tremendously popular within the population
We may need to tax the wealthy. So be it. We’ve done it before. We need to buy into the Dream. Education is the silver bullet for every “ism”! You have the intelligence and stature to lead us forward. My humble opinion is a VP candidate that appeals to people’s emotions-Beto
Medicare and education for all are a national security issue. It is in my best interest to live in a well educated society. We don’t need shrinking life expectancies or foreign engineers &amp; physicists beating us to hypersonic weapons, 5th/6th generation technology, or rail guns
@SenWarren You need to take critics’ knees out. Introduce SR banning paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations. Then introduce a constitutional amendment tackling campaign finance. Make Citizens United irrelevant. Hijack the issues!
@KamalaHarris Make a big splash &amp; introduce SR1 to ban all paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations. Then shoot the moon with a constitutional amendment to address campaign finance. Make Citizens United irrelevant &amp; become a populist hero!
@AOC keep kicking ass &amp; really shake things up. After the bills to reopen, introduce HR2 to ban all paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations. Then shoot the moon and introduce a const. amendment to deal with campaign finance, ridding Corp &amp; PAC $. Make Citizens United irrelevant
@NancyPelosi keep up the good fight, Madam Speaker!
@RepTimRyan Saw you again on tv this morning. The party needs your leadership!
@RepCohen Show them how we do things tomorrow, Memphis Mafia Style!
@SenAlexander Senator. I just watched the president’s rant in which he justified the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This has gotten out of hand. As our senior Senator, let’s end this shutdown...at least on the budgets not pertaining to DHS. We both know that this wall is insane
@RealJobsWexford do you have any jobs for more highly skilled finance/accounting positions. It has always been my dream to move to Ireland. I have visited dozens of times. The USA has become too crazy, my fiancé was killed in a car accident, &amp; I would love a more peaceful life
@POTUS How dare you bring the Vatican into your stupid wall fight.First, that wall is hundreds of years old, and second, the Pope took in refugees &amp; Jews fleeing Nazis...saving 800,000 people. The Pope didn’t ask for money for that service. Shame on you!
Rock on, Granny! https://t.co/habo70Lvum
@SenJeffMerkley Here’s an idea- pass legislation banning all paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations &amp; introduce a constitutional amendment dealing with campaign finance...eliminatinating corporate &amp; PAC money &amp; taking cases like Citizens United out of the Court’s grasp
He laughingly mused what would happen if the Supreme Court expanded his powers, bragged about extorting allies, claimed that Russia &amp; Iran are friends. I have never heard that kind of an incoherent rant - especially from a man who has the launch codes!
Wow, just watched the president’s rant in which he trashed our NATO allies, claimed to be the most popular Republican President ever, praised the Soviet 1980 invasion of Afghanistan, claimed to be a great general, took credit for free market oil prices, &amp; trashed his military
@Jennybing53 God, I am so sorry. That is just awful. Things like your brother &amp; my fiancé are so random &amp; senseless
@KamalaHarris Lost my dad to Cancer. Even with funds &amp; insurance, a catastrophic illness can destroy lives. So while I fully support Medicare for all, let’s take a holistic approach that also addressed the human toll!

@ReneeLibby2 Coulter had further to travel?
@AOC @diddymcc Raise taxes on the wealthy &amp; corporations, end paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations, introduce constitutional amendment to address money &amp; politics...taking cases like Citizens United out of SCOTUS hands

And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."  - I never quote the Bible other than to point out evangelical hypocrisy. So Falwell Jr, this is a strict constructionist reading-the way your judges like them! Point to the part about the wall!
Then they will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, &amp; did not minister to you?' Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you diddn’t do it to the least of these, you did not do it to me.'
For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'
And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
'Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.
And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

@Jennybing53 I am really sorry for your loss as well. As close as I am to my siblings, I can only imagine how hard that is. But I do know what you mean about smiling after dreaming. For me, it’s always about some small little thing that only she and I found funny. How long ago was your loss?
@Jennybing53 She was...both outwardly &amp; inwardly. I dreamt about her during a nap on the sofa earlier. I am so grateful for the time that I have, but I am still struggling to imagining sharing a life with someone else. I date casually, but never seriously
@Jennybing53 It’s especially hard because our families grew up together &amp; were/are close friends. She &amp; I dated since high school. More than “just” a fiancé, she was also just such a great friend who knew me so well.
@Jennybing53 Good on you for helping others...and thank you. Three years have passed, but it’s still tough at times. But I know that she would want me to keep living a full life!

@Jennybing53 Oh, I only know because my fiancé that I lost in a car accident was a resident at the time. While they may make money down the line, residents work ~100 hour weeks &amp; make ~$25K. Thankfully, she wasn’t an anti-Semitic lunatic! She truly wanted to save lives
@Jennybing53 The truly scary part of this story is that she was skilled enough to do her residency at the Cleveland Clinic...one of the top 5 medical facilities in the world...and the top cardiac facility in the world
@Jennybing53 Residents are MDs. While they haven’t passed their final boards, and are supervised by board certified doctors, they are medical doctors. They can write prescriptions, &amp; they perform all procedures, surgeries, etc. as their supervisors. This is how they get trained

@sadydoyle @realmissbeeswax No, I love Senator Warren &amp; believe that she would make an excellent president. If she is the nominee, I will support her 100%.

@melodijoy @AssangeMrs We’ll forget the sexual assault &amp; hacking allegations. He knew it was a crime to release classified documents. His quote  he influenced the 2016 election...”the real victor is the U.S. public.” Who is he to decide that? This nation has been in chaos due to this president.
@RespectableLaw @diddymcc I love Kamala, but I do think that, at times, the prosecutor in her shows. That is why you put her on the ticket with the inspirational candidate, Beto. He is a combination of Obama &amp; Robert Kennedy. That ticket would be amazing, and would obliterate Trump. It puts Texas in play

@Liberalthelorax @PartyofReason @indianaboognish @KochMoney Voters in Idaho, Utah, Maine &amp; Nebraska expanded Medicaid hugely in November. I think that people are kinder than people believe, especially if it saves money. It may have problems in the south, but I think it can be done
@CivArchive @KAZurcher @RuthHHopkins @elegantcoretta Jerry, I absolutely agree with you on that point. My comment (proven also to be wrong) was meant to say that our history with native Americans is shameful and that we need to acknowledge that. However, I was shown a life still being harmed. So we need to better all around
@elegantcoretta @CivArchive @KAZurcher @RuthHHopkins I’m a Memphian, too! Midtowner! Where do you live?
@TimMoses37 @Abhinary I trad the article...about militant Catholics taking “spiritual warfare” to the next level. No need to drop f-bombs.
@diddymcc @HuffPostPol Last week Trump endangered a SEAL team by taking a Selfie. Now he basically laid out the security plan for the Obama residence guarded by the secret service. What’s next? Witness protection locations &amp; names?
@The_Jedster @Wonce_In_A @not_sargon Gen X got screwed in the workplace by baby boomers who refused to retire. There was a great article in Time. Baby Boomers stayed so long past retirement, when they finally left they replaced them with older millennials who had less experience &amp; thus would be paid less
@JP_Quixote @GotJanie @johnpavlovitz He is the last man on earth that I would want on my ass had I broken the law
@AriFleischer That seems a bit one sided. The President gets more than was originally agreed to because of Limbaugh &amp; Coulter. The compromise is the deal to which ALL parties agreed
@NicholsUprising @diddymcc Madison argued for a military tribunal to hear the impeachment trial. Sadly, this is one of the few constitutional areas in which he caved!
@TimMoses37 @Abhinary Tactical rosary beads?
@PartyofReason @indianaboognish @KochMoney Do you mind if I follow you?
@PartyofReason @indianaboognish @KochMoney I work in finance &amp; law. If we make a solid business case, we can sell it. Before we even try, we need to go after paid lobbyists &amp; directed donations. I think all Americans will support that
@TimMoses37 @Abhinary Well if it is written in print, it must be true. If that’s the case, I should let the Pope know that we’re stifling the Blessed Virgin, because the new article alleges that and not a single Catholic on earth is aware
@PartyofReason @indianaboognish @KochMoney I’m not saying that it will be easy, but it it is fight worth undertaking!
@rules_speedy No, I just like to ask!
@PartyofReason @indianaboognish @KochMoney You make the business case. The sstudy has already been done (fundrd by the Koch brothers). To everyone’s surprise, It will save $2T over 10 years. The hard part will fighting off the special interests &amp; lobbyists.
@rules_speedy Hey speedy, can I follow you?
@GOYKSTAR @Sneakybeat22 @UtahDPS @KUTV2News I’m sorry. To where should I move?
@TimMoses37 @Abhinary Yes,it’s much more likely that there’s a secret warrior class of Catholics armed  w/ a huge stockpile of 12th century weapons. Forget that the allegation comes from the writer who is the only person on earth that says the Church is muting the voice of the Blessed Virgin.
@GoldmanSachs @cavs @QuickenLoans @cavsdan I started my career here before I realized I’d sold my soul. Is he mentioning the analyst kickback scheme, the $2B that they just banked from the bailout, insider trading, IPO get rich quick deals for specific clients, etc
@TheRickyDavila Federalist Society
@Jennybing53 Their ratings are in freefall &amp; sponsors are leaving. Maybe they want to shake things up!
@JoeNBC @nytdavidbrooks Sadly, I am not betting on the constitution
@MSNBC Did this administration solicit resumes on the dark web?
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @_LisaGrace_ @realDonaldTrump @GOP This all started under the Reagan. During the 30 years prior, the economy benefitted all because we taxed the shit out of corps. &amp; the wealthy. Income dist.  was far more fair. The wealthy were still wealthy...but the middle/working class were unionized &amp; saw constant wage growth
@pkcapitol @KatyTurNBC @JakeSherman Too bad the majority of Americans don’t want the wall. I’m curious...why are you giving him a pass for lying about Mexico paying for it. Please don’t give the indirect payment bs from the trade agreement.
@elegantcoretta @CivArchive @KAZurcher @RuthHHopkins Fair point. We should make the public more aware. I live in Memphis. TN, &amp; was taught in school that they were friendly. They never got around to telling us how we got the land. The irony of Trump’s wall is that it would take more Native American land.
@indianaboognish @KochMoney Insurance companies are so crooked. My companies group plan charges me far more than 8.6 percent of my salary. I think this plan takes steps...mainly to strengthen the ACA
@KochMoney @indianaboognish What?
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @_LisaGrace_ @realDonaldTrump @GOP You know universities are now running studies to understand this behavior
@indianaboognish @KochMoney Do you not qualify for group or ACA?
@smartdissent @KAZurcher @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateDems They’re just now figuring that out?
@CivArchive @KAZurcher @RuthHHopkins @elegantcoretta I think that we are past atonement. We can only acknowledge that it happened &amp; vow to be better
@realDonaldTrump Is there money to wall off Mississippi &amp; Alabama?
@blackbronze7 @KAZurcher @RuthHHopkins @Tenji95 In fairness to Lincoln, his greatness was his transformation on this issue during the war. While he made that comment at the war’s beginning, he came to believe that the war was Gods wrath for slavery’s evil. We should praise Lincoln for the man he became...a moral leader
@RoKhanna @melodijoy It was good for $1.1T in stock buybacks and no significant CAPEX investment. Quite a few M&amp;A deals were made. If I were Wall Street, I’d triple my lobbyists’ pay. On a side note, I think real worker wages rose by 0.01%. So a worker making $50K will see an extra $50 next year!
@MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr You get some bad press, but I say ypu keep keep kicking them in the ass! I’m a fan. Happy New Year!
@RuthHHopkins @KAZurcher My Irish grandmother is in town. She is not a big fan, either. There were many brutal murders committed against women &amp; children in Ireland, also
@GotJanie @realDonaldTrump But hang on. I just heard our President on tv giving himself an A+ (apparently humility wasn’t a criterion)
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @_LisaGrace_ @realDonaldTrump @GOP I have been saying that for years! It takes real skill to vote so patently against their self interests
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @curiouslefty My God, it is it we’re Satan were building a political platform!

@nytimes Canadian vigilantes? I’d pay money to watch that
@funder @Artbeat53 Oh, I think that they will soon get a hint
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @_LisaGrace_ @realDonaldTrump @GOP Absolutely no credible economist has ever believed in trickle down policies
@JuliaDavisNews I feel safer already
@KUTV2News But sending their kids to college is elitist
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump And now he’s borrowing money from China to pay farmers for the soybeans that China has stopped buying. Don’t get lost in that logic
@maziehirono @Artbeat53 Don’t take his BS, Senator! Fight the good fight! Happy New Year. PS-I am from TN. Please never invite Marsha Blackburn into your home, while the vampire rumors may be unfounded, I’d keep a clove of garlic &amp; holy water handy. Regardless, she is one nasty shrew!
@maziehirono @Artbeat53 The problem is that nobody, even Republicans, have ever believed that building a sea to sea wall is a sane idea. At the San Diego port of entry, authorities say that a reinforcement of a very short span of fence will help. That makes sense. Do that &amp; call it a day
@melodijoy @AssangeMrs The last time I checked, hacking is illegal. Those hacked documents were used to defraud the United States. You make him sound as if he is some naive starry eyed kid. He’s a criminal
@indianaboognish You need to read this closely. While it isn’t, as she readily says, Medicare for all, it does strengthen &amp; increase subsidies on the ACA &amp; lower rates on private insurance companies. Send. Sanders, Gillibrand, Harris&amp; others are co-sponsors. It is a step toward Medicare for all
@AssangeMrs @melodijoy There’s a big difference between free speech &amp; disclosing state secrets to assist a hostile power to undermine our democracy.

@TimMoses37 @Abhinary From the same org. that this week says the Church is trying to “tame Mary’s voice”. I’ve heard my whole life that the Church &amp; its members are hell-bound because we “worship” her. This article is just as asinine. I’ve never once heard of one of these militants...much less met one
@Fluffula I know. I agree with every word that you wrote. I was just pointing out that the hate of these assholes isn’t gender specific!
@Fluffula As a Catholic, I have never met another that even comes within spitting distance of being a white supremecist. Again, the Klan hates Catholics as a fundamental part of their doctrine. We also believe that acts of love &amp; charity towards others must accompany faith.
@Fluffula They’re not really fond of some white men, either. You won’t find many Jews or Catholics at the local Klan rally!
@BetoORourke Right back at you, Congressman!
@9e76a351efa944f @Wonce_In_A @Ocasio2018_ That would be ok were it not for the irreparable ecological damage and the land that would be taken from countless private citizens. Also the overwhelming majority of citizens don’t want it!
@MalcolmNance I’ve only been on Twitter for a short time, but good on you for saying what you do &amp; thank you for your service to our nation! Keep kicking them in the ass!
RT @MalcolmNance: Draft dodging chickenhawk cowards don’t get to call any Generals “failed. “ You failed at manhood. You failed as “leader”…
@SpockResists She scares the shit out of Goldman Sachs, who spends millions fighting her...so whatever her other shortcomings are, good on her for that
@realnecoaslan @diddymcc @cenkuygur @TheYoungTurks It shouldn’t come as a surprise. She was the one Democrat that I was 100% positive was going to run.
@KPNatsFan Happy New Year &amp; Go Cardinals!
@kicranston If that’s the criterion, my grandmother should be the nominee. She’s been feeding us Irish Whiskey shots since it became New Years in County Wexford.
@NBCNews Who do the other 13% blame?
@SenSchumer Right back at you Senator, keep kicking them in the ass! PS- I’m from TN &amp; should warn you about Marsha Blackburn. Don’t turn your back to her, &amp; NEVER invite her in your house! While the Vampire rumors are likely just that, keep a clove of garlic &amp; holy water nearby!
@rolandscahill Someone should remind her that her boss rolls into the oval at 11:00 am, takes 2 meetings, a 1 hour lunch, &amp; is out by 4:00. Most presidents age 20 years. Trump goes to Iraq in Dec. &amp; is more tan than troops posted in the desert!
@siano2020 Love the ticket, but I’d flip it. Beto inspires people like I haven’t seen since Obama. TX is the lowest voting state in the US &amp; he forced the Reps to spend over $100M to win by 3% a red state race expected to draw &lt;6M voters but drew &gt;8M. He raised $75M w/o Corp or PAC money
@AndrewGillum Happy New Year, Mayor!

@SenatorCardin Right back at you Senator! While I am a Tennessean, I’m a fan. On that note, watch Marsha Blackburn. Don’t turn your back to her, &amp; NEVER invite her in to your house. While those vampire rumors are likely just that, I’d keep holy water handy just in case! Happy New Year!
@Brravehart09 @RepCohen That’s my Congressman!
@RepCohen @Abhinary @AdamParkhomenko Happy New Year, Congressman! Keep kicking them in the ass for us...Memphis Mafia style!
@MalcolmNance @NancyRog11 Oh, I’m sure his plan includes archers &amp; vats of boiling oil
@GotJanie @YouTube I started at Goldman Sachs before I realized I’d sold my soul. I know she scared the shit out of them. They spend millions per year just fighting her...so she’s doing something right!
@DearAuntCrabby @ParryPierce @realDonaldTrump The market will be fine. We should worry about the 50% who can’t afford to invest. Real wages haven’t risen in 40 years. 60 yrs. ago the economy roared and everyone benefitted. Did we tax the shit out of corps &amp; the rich...hell yes. They just had to endure being not as rich!
@LindseyGrahamSC Damn, Senator...you only controlled Congress, the White House, SCOTUS, cable news, &amp; the Koch Brothers &amp; couldn’t shove it through. He had 2 deals to get his wall &amp; crawfished both times...as he did on the clean CR. Now you go John Wayne because your guy negotiated in bad faith?
@philosophrob It would depend on her opponent. Trump or any of today’s Republicans...absolutely
@ellievan65 I greatly admired Sen. McCain &amp; mean absolutely no disrespect to him or his family...but did Lindsay bury his testicles next to him?

@SenGillibrand Right back at you, Senator! Even though I’m a Tennessean, I’m a big fan. On that note, some New Years advice. Never turn your back on Marsha Blackburn &amp; NEVER invite her into your home. While I’m sure those Vampire rumors are just that, I’d keep a clove of garlic just to be safe!

@ewarren Right back at you , Senator! PS - I started at Goldman Sachs before I realized that I had sold my soul. They didn’t like you at all, which means that you are wearing the white hat. I work for a 501c3 now &amp; sleep like a baby at night! Keep fighting them for us!

@MSNBC @CNBC Long term yearly gain is ~11-12%. Stocks were trading at ridiculously high multiples &amp; earnings values. Worry about the 1/2 of the nation that can’t afford to be invested. Real wages haven’t risen in 40 years. Once, we taxed the hell out of the wealthy &amp; corps &amp; all prospered!
@CNN Trump will just slap tariffs on those, too
@jules_su @Abhinary And to think...had he just kept his ego in check one single time he could be happily making his fraudulent billions, perhaps do a Saudi reality show, be warmly ogling his daughter w/o press, chugging vodka with Putin in his new Penthouse &amp; asking, “Bob who”?

@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix Not military...just a lifelong recreational sailor. I have family in Savannah, GA, &amp; I keep my boat near there
@realDonaldTrump Way to spread that holiday cheer, Mr. President!
@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix That is exactly the same thing that Mr. Finn said to me. Nevertheless, they are heroes. Your guy fully intended to give his life...and he didn’t hesitate. He was rewarded by getting to see all of the men he saved.
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Washington should have told the French to turn the boats around, told the men to go home, and just given his sword to Cornwallis and called it a day!
@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix That is really cool. You know, if he has that medal around his neck, Trump would have to snap to attention and salute!
@kashanacauley @Fluffula Wasn’t he the Butgermeister from “Santa Claus is Coming to Town”?
@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix Can you imagine the courage that took? There was no time to think or hesitate. That is a hero
@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix And it didn’t kill him?
@JaxsonAgincourt @Artbeat53 @LindseyGrahamSC @NancyPelosi 6 dumbasses &amp; about 9-10 teeth!
@MichaelSteele @kakikahl I am waiting for the litigation in which you become the first modern president to attempt to steal land from Native Americans. It isn’t as if we’ve inconvenienced them in the past (other than the genocide).

@JP_Quixote I’ve been on a political journey my entire life. I started my career at Goldman Sachs, &amp; I felt as if I were working for the devil. I quit to become the counsel for a charity. I have gone from centrist conservative to democratic socialist in the course of about 2 years

@gagoldfish @JohnDonisi @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett I am lucky that my families kept all family trees in the family bible. To this day, my grandmother can tell you the life story of everyone in that bible. Oral tradition is great over a whiskey!
@gagoldfish @JohnDonisi @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett A lot of Irish immigrants arrived in Savannah. It is still has a huge Irish presence...including my grandparents and 2 uncles who moved there. Best St. Patrick’s Party in the country!

@DanLamothe @Cluelesscomedy3 @jaketapper @netflix That is the man. He was a trip. He didn’t really want to talk a lot about that day other than to say that he lost so many friends, and that he was so pissed that he was going to die before he left that gun! He loved Irish whiskey!
@Cluelesscomedy3 @DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix It was! Did you ever get the chance to meet him?
@sarandopolis @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx If I implied or said that it was not intended. I am outspoken in my defense of these poor people! I apologize
@JohnDonisi @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx @KiethBarrett My maternal grandparents came from County Wexford to St. John’s Newfoundland to Tennessee in the 50s where they had my mom &amp; her 5 siblings.

Over time, we amended the constitution to make us a democracy but didn’t change the structure of the Republic. The Senate selection must change to end the rule of the minority
@realDonaldTrump Then sit down &amp; testify with Mueller if you are innocent. He is a law &amp; order guy with no axe to grind
@KamalaHarris I know that he doesn’t care, but among all of the many problems he would face even if he received his funding, he would have to seize native Native American land. Do we want to be party to that again?

@maziehirono He’s a freakin’ Dickens’ character
@Mimirocah1 @JillWineBanks Did the true historical significance hit you at the time?
@StevenBeschloss The founders set up a Republic. They never intended avg. people to vote. We have amended the constitution so that we vote as a democracy, but we never changed the original constraints of the Republic. It wasn’t a big deal until urbanization has now exposed the flaw.

@AlanLCross @KristyPerano Article 1- Congress Makes Laws.                  Article 2- The Chief Executive only enforces them.                                              Ask Senator Sasse for his School House Rock DVDs
@duty2warn Andrew Johnson did to a certain degree. He was a Southern sympathizer after Lincoln’s murder. Congress kept passing acts to punish the South &amp; Johnson kept vetoing. Hence, he was impeached, considered one of the worst 2 presidents, &amp; I’d often compared to Trump
@GOP There would be no problem if we offered humane asylum. Instead, your guy chanted at every MAGA rally that Mexico would pay for a wall. He had the chance to get it in exchange for DACA. He has negotiated in bad faith at every turn...including the clean CR agreed to by all parties
@KPNatsFan pray to those gods to send a few decent middle relievers to the Cardinals!

@KPNatsFan I made a similar wall comment just this morning to my sister. Beto is a once in a generation inspiration. He is the reincarnation of RFK (I hope). I just hope that Sanders people stop attacking
@DanLamothe @jaketapper @netflix I had the honor to meet a Medal of Honor recipient in a bar. It was awarded for his actions at Pearl Harbor...where despite 70+ wounds, he continued to man a 50 caliber gun &amp; shot down 4 planes. He has passed, but at least I had the honor to buy a few Irish whiskeys for a hero!
@VanityFair You are right about the outnumbered part. As for the aggrieved part, we’ll live with it. The key word in that byline is”young.” They have lived through the Tea Party and Donald Trump...which are both in a different world from when I was a young Republican not very long before!
@CNN Is it me...or if we could just cut out the fir right nationalist bullshit, the migrant problem might solve itself. Accomplishing that goal, however, requires a coalition of nations (preferably not right wing nationalists themselves) to defend our way of life.
@BrianKarem @SaltyLenore Brian, I feel your pain. I don’t even recognize that party anymore. For me, it was liberating. I took a hard look at my life, re-examined my Catholicism, quit Goldman Sachs, and now serve as counsel for a 501c3. Centrist -&gt;Progressive in two years! Just be true to yourself!
@SenDuckworth Keep kicking them in the ass, Senator!
@GoldiloxMAGA @KeithBarrett @chloechloe616 @JoaquinCastrotx Let me guess...Christian? Only workers were allowed asylum in Mexico...which is just as/more violent.

@realDonaldTrump Who was the other co-author, the tooth fairy? By your own Bureau of Labor Statistics, real wages(adj. for inflation) grew by 0.1%. So a worker paid $50K per year earns an extra pre tax $50/year? Stop the presses! Real wages for middle/working class have been flat for 40 yrs.

@AOC You too, Sen? What is it about this young woman that makes the GOP (and you) nuts? She did what every conservative claims that they want people to do...she busted her ass, &amp; is in Congress at 29. Passion, talent, &amp; idealism aren’t cheap talk. Enjoy retirement, Senator!

@Brasilmagic @pvdork I especially love the “one of” his mistresses part. Nothing reeks quite like fundamentalist hypocrisy
@hardball I think Ike made that speech just before the Normandy landings!
@NBCNews I love how the media frames things. A conservative study just showed that the health plan would save $2T over 10 yrs. Why aren’t crazy low taxes on the wealthy &amp; corps not called giveaways? We’re giving away our money now. At least under this agenda we would get a lot in return

@VictorWittmann @TyHyCHI @MonicaMonicawt1 @funder Don’t get me wrong...I am not suggesting that we not fight back. The biggest threat that we face is that much of this nation has allowed itself to become uninformed. We have to win the battle for truth &amp; facts.
@lmcclelland63 @SenatorDurbin That brave officer’s murder is horrific, and I have said a Rosary for him &amp; his family. While the life of a single life is too many, a US citizen is 20 X more likely to commit homicide. With ~16,000 murders committed each year, I agree. We need fix the whole thing

@IlhanMN He doesn’t know nor does he care. He knows that the wall, even if funded, wouldn’t be built for decades due to environmental studies &amp; eminent right litigation with countless owners of 1,300 miles of border land in TX alone. This is about his (&amp; base’s)dislike of brown people

@SenSchumer @CuseFootball For those who want this shutdown ended, call the President. There WAS a deal in place agreed to by all parties. Trump got spooked by Limbaugh &amp; Coulter &amp; broke his word. So the Senator is to blame for another party that negotiated in bad faith?

@CarlaSchroder @SenJeffMerkley Both houses had agreed with the President that they would pass &amp;sign a clean CR. The Senate passed it 100-0. It went to the House to be passed.

@KatyTurNBC Then he can use that incremental tax revenue to build his wall
@shooz013 @realDonaldTrump It may not kill children, but after barriers went up in 2006 under the Secure Fence Act, more than 2,000 people were killed in the first year alone. Most were Cartel members, but the fence didn’t stop them. They just killed one another before breaching the Fence
@CNN In TN, they will incarcerate people with pot in their car, but this guy gets to molest half of California?
@citizensamblog @BigRedSepulveda @realDonaldTrump Not to mention that if Congress gave him $100B, he would still spend the next twenty years in court trying to take  1,300 miles of private property under the eminent domain statute. They tried with only 700 miles under the Secure Fence Act in 2006. There are still pending cases.
@JohnFugelsang Give them a break. They have every advantage, own everything, &amp; are 1 SCOTUS Justice away from 24/7 “Give Me that Old Time Religion” on satellite radio...but apparently they are also being targeted by a “War on Christmas.” Radical words like Happy Holidays could bring it all down
@KamalaHarris Is he going to keep it shut down while the government litigates eminent domain cases w/ owners of 1,300 miles of border land in Texas alone? Aren’t there still over 100 cases that have been pending for a decade over the Secure Fence Act...that dealt with ~700 miles?
@kylegriffin1 @MalcolmNance Obviously only because 3 million illegal immigrants voted! Trump is still fighting for an electoral college victory

@GeorgeTakei @BigRedSepulveda The guiding principle has always been that an indictment/trial would be too much of a distraction for the chief executive. Trump doesn’t roll into the oval until 11:00, never reads briefing materials, &amp; is done by 3:00. He can watch Fox &amp; Friends in the Pen!

@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews I am really sorry that you see it that way. I apologize if I came off overly defensive. Living in the south, I hear people insults constantly. At least you were raised in the faith and know of what you speak
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews Christ made Peter the head of the Church. Peter’s successor is the Bishop of Rome (Pope). Until the 16th century, there was only one Christian faith. After the Reformation, thousands of new churches were founded by various men. Ours is still the one founded by Christ
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews If you knew me, you would know that I don’t blindly follow anything. I struggled with my faith since childhood. The story of my acceptance is long &amp; unimportant. I finally answered enough questions &amp; took a leap of faith (very hard). But I am at peace with my choice
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews I agree. More people have died senselessly in God’s name than for any reason. Catholicism was founded by Christ. Has it been corrupted at times by fallible or even evil people? Yes. But through history, in its darkest hours, the church has always been saved...even from itself.

Top income tax - 91%, estates - 70%, &amp; corps at 2x today. 1/3 of workers in unions &amp; the economy roared for all. CEOs made 20X the avg. worker. Today it is 200X. Middle class wages have been flat since 1979.
@CynicalArmyWife @soonergrunt @MalcolmNance @revmagdalen On that point I agree
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews BTW...we have been around for 2000 years. Christ himself founded our church
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews Did you discover a correlation between age and wealth? They force members to give 10-25 percent of their personal wealth to the church. It is ok. You can admit that you don’t like Catholics. Just know that on the subject of wealth...you are wrong
@BernardMcIntyr5 @CBCNews Apparently not. I didn’t conduct the valuation. Facts are facts. They are wealthier
@joshscampbell 4. A president can wet his pants as he tells brave men &amp; women permanently stationed in harm’s way how scary it was when they shut the windows on the plane
@nytimes Less exercise, fast food, &amp; corn syrup replacing sugar
@RWPUSA @MalcolmNance Bush was told of the Gorbachev ousting before Gorbachev. Those last few months of the Soviet Union could have gone much differently
@davidfrum Give them time, he will be implicated in the Lindbergh kidnapping
@AlanBaxter I come from a large Irish family. We look forward to that time more than Xmas. My grandmother tells us about Boxing Day (apparently it’s a real holiday in some nations), which is after  Xmas &amp; involves large quantities of alcohol. Sadly, in my family this continues until Jan 6th
@th3j35t3r @MalcolmNance Interesting that this was taken in Germany...a nation of only 82M...yet took in nearly 1M refugees last year
@robreiner @MalcolmNance If our founders could have seen this man, you really have to wonder if they wouldn’t have just called it a day
@MSNBC @JoeNBC I was appalled at how he politicized this until I remembered his meeting with the Boy Scouts where he cursed &amp; went political...and how he told the 7 year old kid last week that Santa isn’t real. Still, this was sad...even for him
@AndrewGillum Happy Holidays, Mayor! We need you on another ballot!
@CBCNews Is his last name Trump?
@MarkWarner As soon as Trump blocks out the sun, it’s official...he is Monty Burns
@MGolicJR57 Irish chances...straight up?
@Acosta Journalists aren’t paid to be nice or to be used as a propaganda tool. There is a reason yours is the only profession constitutionally protected. Truth matters today more than ever. Keep at it!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Perhaps the new NAFTA deal will indirectly increase the pay

@nytimes @itscaitlinhd As an adoptee, I can promise that the feeling of abandonment stays with you
@AlexRad17 @NBCNews Also, when you call someone an idiot, the insult carries more of a punch when you don’t misspell the word “thought.” You may have meant to use the word, “though.” If so, however, you should really rethink throwing around the “i” word.
@AlexRad17 @NBCNews Yes, I am sure that the Koch brothers conspired with highly esteemed academics &amp; professionals at George Mason in a sinister misinformation campaign...and I am the idiot. Whatever gets you through the day
@NBCNews Maybe this is a product of my 12 years of being beaten by nuns and Jesuits, but this seems fixable. I also hate bullying, but changing a name seems extreme and won’t stop the bullying. By nature, bullies are cowards and insecure. Stand up to them and they back down
@Petlover264 @BigRedSepulveda @DailyMirror We will trade you for President Trump!
@thehill Imagine  if, just for one day, you could just make up and say anything that pops into your mind and pass it off as truth? I would be punched repeatedly and become abruptly single. This man lives this day like Groundhog Day &amp; becomes president.
@NBCNews It is interesting how the media doesn’t mention the report commissioned by, of all people, the Koch brothers. Rather than discredit Medicare for all (as they envisioned), the report stated that Medicare for all would reduce healthcare costs by $2T over 10 years w/o reducing care
@jimsciutto This guy would shame George Costanza
@BigRedSepulveda Sadly, a blanket amnesty was given
@thehill I love AOC, but I understand McCaskill’s confusion. Missouri isn’t a bastion of progressivism. I only pray that AOC can keep her idealism &amp; determination. I have seen DC beat it out of people. But she is a star &amp; scares the hell out of people. That’s a great start!
@NBCNews Pass the clean CR to which everyone originally agreed and open the government
@MSNBC @hardball Anyone who has no pollster, takes no PAC money, and isn’t afraid to drop the F-bomb in front of his wife, kids, and the nation definitely gets my vote!
@cmclymer @Johan_2018_Wave Are they throwing in the cost of the engineering projects needed  to get the steel to the border...or the legal fees to fight the countless court cases that citizens will fight to the Supreme Court when the government tries to seize their land owned since the Mexican War
@SenSanders @Johan_2018_Wave Good luck trying to win an argument with these people using facts. I live in TN. Trust me, it doesn’t work!
@krassenstein @Johan_2018_Wave Let’s be fair. I had a bone spur removed in high school, and it was traumatic having to sit out those two baseball games!
@MLB @JoeNBC Where are the Cardinals fans?
@BeschlossDC Love watching you on Morning Joe &amp; love your books. Which president personally fascinates you the most?
@CNN Maybe he will pull a Churchill and head down to Texas with brick &amp; mortar to build it himself. If he stays on the south side of it, I might be ok with that
@WMM_podcast @SteveSchmidtSES @nytimes The man is the love child of Monty Burns and George Costanza
@tarapalmeri @benyc Is this the same Senator Graham who buried his courage &amp; self respect with Senator McCain?
@waltshaub @BillKristol No kidding. Libertarians are all about open borders
@TulsiPress Congresswoman, I watched you speak on a news show tonight (via YouTube) &amp; was very impressed! Keep up the good fight!
@NBCNews I fully appreciate civil rights legacy possessed by Atlanta, but I would love to see the Saints hold up the Lombardi trophy In Atlanta!
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @POTUS The Con. Convention notes say a lot. The first impeachable offense mentioned was winning office by defrauding electors (voters in today’s world). Mason, Randolph, &amp; Madison then specifically discuss the crime of taking $ from other nations. Madison argued for a trial by tribunal
@Ashley1_Nicole1 @ScottPresler @RepAdamSchiff I am right there with you on the fact that any murder is one too many. My point is just that we shouldn’t be playing on people’s fears by making them believe that illegal immigrants are savages when we are far more likely to be murdered by our spouse or someone that we know
@Pennyvane10 @Csboughn They should be donating their paychecks to charity
@Csboughn So sorry, Chris...my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Thank you for your service to our nation!
@NBCNews At least she is delivering the right message. Granted, it lacked the warmth and kindness of Trump’s “What’s happening in this country is disgraceful...other than that, Merry Xmas.”
@JeffreyGuterman Nice gesture...could have done w/o him politicizing the entire thing by calling us suckers, talking about his stupid wall, lying about Saudi $, &amp; slandering Democrats. This wasn’t a MAGA rally. His pettiness is unbelievable!
@MSNBC @SteveKornacki I understand that the Party is a big tent with room for many ideologies, but this is far too important to destroy each other. If Trump wins this election, not only may he destroy the Republic...but may very well fill 3 more Supreme Court seats...leaving a 7-2 majority
@BernieSanders What makes this even worse...our newest CEO was fired from his last gig for driving their stock price down by 60%, took a $30M severance, and now makes $15M/yr (w/o stock options). Like the NFL coaching group...once you’re in, you will be hired by someone even if you are fired
@Los_H I love it, but I don’t know if any of these will beat the Jeff Saturday/Peyton Manning Mic’d up episode!
@RepCohen As a midtowner, you have had my vote for years and always will! Thank you for representing Memphis being a rare voice of political sanity in this state!
@ScottPresler @RepAdamSchiff https://t.co/iL7RTr4ehY  CATO Institute...hardly a liberal organization. In 2015, of the 785 murders in TX, 709 were committed by citizens &amp; 49 committed by illegal immigrants. Perhaps we should deport citizens
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @POTUS Does this really surprise anyone considering that he served on the board of a company that sold custom toilets for men of “stature”?
@SRuhle Great job! I wish other anchors would spend at least a little more time teaching economics and Finance (I understand that the ways in which a massive corporate tax cut only spur M&amp;A &amp; Stock buy backs is a little dry!) Ari does a great job also! Again, congratulations!
@SenBlumenthal Hoover? He lacked the tools to confront a depression, but history forgets that, while he later changed, he was originally a progressive Republican (ala TR). He also strongly promoted private charity. Trump will be fighting it out in history with Andrew Johnson
@MalcolmNance @AuschwitzMuseum If anyone needs a reminder of the importance of the Western alliance or the danger of right wing nationalism, visit these places. I made a point of visiting these camps and the Allied cemeteries to remind me of both the worst and best of human nature
@KatyTurNBC Congratulations to you &amp; MSNBC!
@JoeNBC Well said, Joe! Yours is the one news show that I record. Your references to Madison are always on point, &amp; you always color today’s issues in the appropriate historical context. You are also the only host that I have seen to hold citizens accountable for not educating ourselves
@amyklobuchar This isn’t my area of expertise...but could Doctors Without Borders help in this situation?
@SenSanders Well said, Senator!
@SenatorDurbin Where is the outrage from the so called “Christians” who continue to support this administration? The hypocrisy is sickening
@KamalaHarris The most insidious part was the almost pathological smirk on her face during the questioning.
@MalcolmNance Props to POTUS for exposing the faces of a covert SEAL team operating in the area. Similar photos taken with President Bush had faces digitally blurred. These brave patriots face enough danger. They shouldn’t have to worry about a politically based Selfie
@CTVNews Good for you, RBG! Talk about the unsinkable Molly Brown!
