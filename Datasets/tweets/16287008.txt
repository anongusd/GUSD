Mission distraction to begin now.
My dad’s surgery was supposed to be at 9, then at 2, then they wheeled him to the OR at 5... only to be delayed until 6:20....
This is the first first day of school that I have missed. I made him promise to send me a picture... I should have asked for a good picture, not a weird cropped picture... but here it is.… https://t.co/w7gK6nZgwn
I want today to end.
Today my dad has surgery. He has cancer. The tumor is on his spine and is eating away at the bone. School starts this week. And our A/C broke. Apparently I am being grumpy. I must refrain from yelling “No SHIT”

We have, it got us no where. @iamnotkowalski talked with you last night
RT @iamnotkowalski: I wonder if @Expedia will ever answer my questions anymore or if I should just do my best to make this a trending topic…
So, after the frustration appeared, yes humans show emotions the @expedia rep hung up on my husband. The money was pulled so it stopped us from booking the trip without mixing airlines or through another company. We never got a straight answer, so here we are stuck.
Then the reps from @Expedia said the flight did not exist. Then it was overbooked. Frustrated we asked to speak to a supervisor. Almost 2 hours on the phone &amp; most of it waiting. No supervisor came. So we asked to speak to another agent, who we then had to re-explain everything
We called @Expedia , and first was told that it was our credit limit that stopped this transaction. And was asked what our credit limit is, which is very rude. Then we were told it was because we mixed airlines, which is an option on the site.
Here is where I am mad. I went to finally book the bundle we have been looking at for a few days on @Expedia I submitted it &amp; it came back to said a lower price. I tried to submit it again &amp; my card was declined. I checked and I had two charges, one for Expedia &amp; one for United.
Just in case you were unaware. https://t.co/Nr5Scacvrz
I forgot to add that the call center customer service representatives for @Expedia are also not very helpful or polite and they changed the reason they couldn’t honor this bundle several times. Then hung up on @iamnotkowalski
Essentially the moral of this evening is @Expedia should not offer bundles they cannot honor, and if its a pending charge for a bundle they cannot honor you are screwed for 72hrs, I mean unless you are made of money, then why are you going through Expedia? @iamnotkowalski
Customer service used to mean something @iamnotkowalski
@reymarblue @iamnotkowalski His angry is amusing sometimes, especially at places that he spends his money. He is dedicated to getting services due.
RT @iamnotkowalski: I think the entire purpose of being put on hold with dead silence is hoping I'll eventually just hang up.

@MissusMelnee I hope she makes it to the end, and we find out the worse trauma she suffered was when an engagement ring got stuck and she almost died
@iamnotkowalski Was a Bears fan, she isn’t loyal, I bet she sleeps with his brother
@MissusMelnee It’s the best part of this season. What kind of trauma is left for her?

I wanna celebrate boobbirthdays
Bye Liz #TheBachelor
Liz is there because doula  doesn't pay as well as dating show hussy #TheBachelor
Oh shut up
RT @ashleyiaco: My facial expressions watching Liz "breakup" with Nick. https://t.co/3oJb0Lpdbw
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee @TheKenChilds better than a sock on banger
@MissusMelnee @NICKSMASHED @TheKenChilds she didn't even have to pop out her boobs, I mean again, I assume she did at the wedding
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee @TheKenChilds in fact...I think she out attentioned whored Corrine
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee @TheKenChilds yea... a bit too much
RT @OliviaCaridi: This whole scene. #TheBachelor https://t.co/N7qpwIygGW
By the way I slept with him, bye
Yup. Fake slaps. Stupid #TheBachelor
Oh oral jokes
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee @TheKenChilds you are a hero
Omg it's a fake slap. Fuck you abc
That was super awkward
@MissusMelnee @NICKSMASHED in my case, he was emotionally abusive and secluded me. I was only allowed to talk to some people. It happens
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee @TheKenChilds true story time. I didn't know I was with a cokehead for almost 8 years.
Omg why is it hard to say... hey I've had sex before
@TheKenChilds I'm all in on this one
I don't know who the top girls are but the bottom two are Corrine and Liz. Liz is the worst though #TheBachelor
This girl just keeps getting more adorable. I'd give her a rose #TheBachelor
Ugh brush your ratty hair Corrine, smooth brushed out hair is in, you are so 2014 #TheBachelor
@NICKSMASHED @TheKenChilds @MissusMelnee who slaps him?
Does Nick not feel the tension? #TheBachelor
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee so me saying Pickle is my best friend is cool because he is a boy?
Clearly Corinne is the classy one.. wait that way mistyped... kla$$y #TheBachelor
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee okay... excuse me while I go change...
@NICKSMASHED I was probably her now that I think about it. I always lived by the when in doubt... whip em out motto
@NICKSMASHED I just can't fathom that she is real.
@rawhidevelvet it's really how I have gotten this far in life
Insecure and crazy. It's like the perfect combo
RT @OliviaCaridi: Corinne wins the challenge. The look on every girl's face. #TheBachelor https://t.co/DIGINOICh8
I'm embarrassed for her. WHERE IS THAT GIRL'S NANNY? #TheBachelor
Omg those are some white thighs
Okay... those are some sad awkward kisses #TheBachelor

Foot in mouth.. whore
Dolphin/Shark is drunk and I love it.
There is more to live than looks Corrine
I did not peg her at the first one to cry
And a Villain emerges #TheBachelor
If there was chemistry then you would be in a relationship dumbass
Can't you just say hi my name is _____ and be normal? Oh wait... it's boring and bad for tv
Wtf weener
Yea Hoxie needs to go
Wait she has homemade maple syrup and is super cute. Yup she is my number one
That was a total "oh god I've slept with her and it was bad" face #TheBachelor
RT @bachelorburnbk: Oh, man. These intros are so awkward. We are hiding under the couch. #TheBachelor https://t.co/UFfPzPKyje
@MissusMelnee I don't think his face is capable of emotion

Seriously, Jojo is the worst
I love that dress
@Lesdoggg I love you 💚 I cannot fathom the hate that these people seem to enjoy so much.
I mean I'm not on Team Luke, well he is the best choice left but I wanna hang out with his grandpa
RT @enews: But will Robby and JoJo talk about why Aaron Rodgers wasn't there for Jordan's hometown date? #TheBachelorette https://t.co/aQ7I…
Those are some moist pits Robby
@rawhidevelvet the higher the hair the closer to God
I seriously think I might have to change the channel, talk about something other than Aaron dammit
Why is she all up on Aaron now, just stop you sound like a groupie
I was excited until I remember she got rid of anyone of quality and all that's left are the stepford husbands.

@rawhidevelvet I'd cry too if I caught mono for nothing
RT @enews: We have a feeling this is what Chase looks like when he's mad/sad/excited/confused etc. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/VkEyqSzg0V
Go back to Pam, Jim... She didn't make you cry
@NICKSMASHED I didn't notice it on the show, make he waxed for the show or something
@NICKSMASHED here, have a Chad snap screenshot to perk this up, he was snapping into a slim Jim https://t.co/7qFdhkl0OL
@NICKSMASHED his snapchat helps me get through the week, I mean if you like whiskey and chain smoking shirtless snaps
Umm guys, that feeling you are feeling isn't love, it's the raging case of mono she is spreading around
@NICKSMASHED that would make this show so much better. Totes ready for Bachelor in Paradise
@NICKSMASHED this was a bad episode of the office with stunt actors. Who thought this was needed? Again Wells was better than these two
This is the most awkward date yet. No one wants to be there
Umm Jojo, you really should look up the definition of the word thrown...
So a two one one date with two no names that don't matter, cool thanks
He is swishing his wine like a bitch who found out she missed a white sale
@rawhidevelvet I miss the drunk Canadian and Chad, these guys are all the same and boring
Okay fine, it really is just me https://t.co/O486DYMtq9
@rawhidevelvet BUT JOJO HE CHEATS AT GO FISH CAUSE HE IS A CELEBRITY
Nice double chin bucco
RT @MissusMelnee: James Taylor, Jordan is Jojo's obsession. Ratting on his crap behavior guarantees you going home. #TheBachelorette
@rawhidevelvet I can't roll my eyes hard enough right now, and she got rid of Wells for this... Ugh
Does Luke remind anyone else of Andy Grammar? Just me? Cool
@rawhidevelvet you just said it made you want him, dammit make up your mind lady
@NICKSMASHED the. He is prepared for her vagina
@NICKSMASHED better than Robby and James Taylor
@NICKSMASHED fine, point taken. But Wells was amazing
RT @allisonpiwo: Me when JoJo didn't give Wells the rose. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/o9u8MDNaH2

But thank fucking goodness limp dick is gone and twelve mile chin
Who the hell is gonna cut their hair now so that they can read gossip magazines?
Just in case you needed a The Chad update he is watching the show, drinking Jack Daniels, chain smoking, and snuggling with his dog Pumpkin
You don't love JoJo
Love https://t.co/UsnjhjKuWG
It's petty and a nonissue is code for, that was a pity rose dumbass
I'd nibble on my cucumbers too
Umm you aren't confronting. You are discussing.
So Jojo without the assholes this season is gonna tank, so here is this article to stir the shit, thanks the producers
Just posted a video https://t.co/byerVeFJ9W
Umm you never talk about your ex in the beginning of a relationship
So, I like Wells, so he is likely the next to be cut and limp dick dude will be here for another couple rounds
So, Vinnie is just there to upkeep the boys
The truth is out, it was the Bachelorette that spread the Zika
@NICKSMASHED @MissusMelnee but they were entertaining. Evan the limp dick dude, is annoying and boring
@autopsy4 sorry, I clearly needed to add Evan the limp dick dude.
Are you fucking kidding me? We lost the drunk Canadian? I want to riot now. You keep the creepo and ditch the drunk.
Can we get rid of the erectile dysfunction guy now?
