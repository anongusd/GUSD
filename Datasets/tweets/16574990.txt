Happy Halloween, What are you doing this fun awesome day :-)
@RugbyJones been trying to speak with me Claudia :-)
@RugbyJones Hi Mr Rugby Jones
I am not giving candy out this year,in fact I haven't done that in 8 years. Maybe next year I will do something fun for everyone.
The High School Football team would even come to get candy and see what was being done for that years jack o'lantern.
Because of what I would do with the pumpkins, the house became a must go to place for the kids.
there was only about  60 kids that came to the house, the last year that I did it, there was over 500 kids come to the house.
I would put a 100 watt bulb in it, it would really make the jack o'lantern shine. The first year I did this,
Years ago every Halloween, I use to give candy out. I also would carve these larger pumpkins and light them with shop light that hangs.

@mrgalen ok I will get one then, and if it gets booted to checked bagage will let yyou know.
@mrgalen oh side note I was an Army Bart, so I know very good about how well made military stuff is ;-)
@mrgalen and it was because of having to much metal
