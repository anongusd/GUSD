(2/2) These negotiations must be in good faith and result in resources to secure our southern border.
(1/2) The short-term CR just announced by @POTUS and agreed to by all parties is the right way forward. It will reopen the government immediately, back pay those impacted and comes with a strong commitment to go to House/Senate conference on the Homeland Security spending bill.
Today, I took to the Senate Floor to urge Members of both parties to come together &amp; work around the clock until we reach a solution that reopens the government &amp; secures the southern border. See my remarks here: https://t.co/KOVEzMRaTh
(4/4) I will continue to work with members of both sides of the aisle and the administration to end this stalemate, open up the government and secure our border.
(3/4) Advancing politically charged messaging bills while our Border Patrol agents, CBP officers and other federal employees are not receiving a paycheck is not negotiating in good faith to solve this issue now.
(2/4) I opposed the temporary measure put forward by Minority Leader @SenSchumer because it fails to address the security and humanitarian crisis we face in our Arizona communities along the border.
(1/4) I voted for a proposal to immediately re-open the gov't, secure our southern border, and provide humanitarian assistance. This compromise plan also would have provided legal status &amp; stability for those covered by DACA &amp; TPS while we work to find a permanent solution.

It's no secret that Senator McCain and the President don't see eye to eye on many things, but in this case, we were all unified to give our heroes what they need to keep us safe.
The NDAA bill signing was about our troops and rebuilding our military, but instead, the media decided again to turn it into controversy on what the President did or didn‚Äôt say, and unfortunately made that the entire focus.
Senator McCain is the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and his leadership and passion for our military this year, and every year, has helped our troops and strengthened our country‚Äôs national security.
We must uphold our responsibility to care for the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our country and our freedoms. 		I have been hard at work in Congress to ensure that the 73,222 veterans who live in #AZ02 receive quality care throughout our district. https://t.co/DzXzGvY973

After 6 months, this tax bill is helping America continue to lead the world in creating opportunities. I will keep looking out for the pocketbooks, paychecks, and hopes of the middle class. I believe the best is yet to come.
Arizonans are even getting relief on their utility bills. The Arizona Public Service requested a $119 million bill reduction for customers. @TEPenergy will also pass on its tax savings to customers in the form of bill credits.
@USTreasury estimated that 90% of Americans would see an increase in their paychecks due to the new lower tax rates‚Äîand those paychecks are finally here. That‚Äôs your money you can use to pay down debts, save for education, or go on vacation.
@BankofAmerica @WellsFargo @uhaul @Walmart are just some of the companies raising wages and increasing benefits for AZ employees.
Wages, especially small business wages, are rising across Arizona. The Phoenix metro area is now the national leader in small business wage growth.	https://t.co/8tXJ5aZeED

Under our OLD system, American taxpayers spent $99 BILLION each year complying with the individual income tax. The new tax code will be simpler. Check out the new calculator the IRS created to make taxes easier for families moving forward. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/gzEVJuSRE9 https://t.co/4GGZXmIk2k
Today's the LAST #TaxDay we file under the 32 year old tax code. Under our new tax code, we lowered individual tax rates so that more Americans will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money. A typical middle income family of 4 in #AZ02 will see a tax cut of $2,148! https://t.co/6g7cPrkEiM
The new tax code is better than our old tax code because it repeals Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate, giving families the freedom to buy the healthcare plan that is right for them. It also provides relief from an Obamacare tax hike affecting the medical expense deduction. #TaxDay https://t.co/pURcUJktJI
Under our old tax code, America had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world‚Äî35%. Under our new code, we slash the rate to 21%. We STOP encouraging companies to shift or leave funds offshore &amp; START encouraging investment here. Businesses are already moving back! https://t.co/GFtbVsZSBp
Today is the LAST DAY we file under the old tax code! Who are the biggest winners under the new code? Hard-working families. Middle-income taxpayers get the largest percentage tax cut, and families making $20,000 to $50,000 will see the largest percentage reductions. #TaxDay https://t.co/iqLAPKP4Sd
The new tax code is better than the old because it gives substantial relief to families. We doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child, plus a $500 tax credit for other dependents. Lower taxes, larger standard deduction &amp; expanded child tax credits = more $ for families. https://t.co/7RyxiOAwJ3

Why is the new tax code better than the old? By nearly doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct effectively offers taxpayers a zero tax rate on more of their income. #TaxDay https://t.co/mibDiZkIOZ

By relocating our embassy to Jerusalem, President Trump fulfilled a promise our country made two decades ago to our ally: formally recognize the Jewish State of Israel‚Äôs undivided capital üáÆüá±#SOTU
Jerusalem is the eternal, undivided capital of Israel. The United States has a sovereign right to determine where we place our US Embassy. üáÆüá± #SOTU
Under President @realdonaldtrump we are destroying ISIS safe havens in Iraq and Syria, and finally standing up to North Korea--as well as revisionist powers like China and Russia. #SOTU
Only 5 of the Army's 58 brigades are combat ready. Less than half of the Navy's aircraft can fly. 80% of the Marine Corps aviation units  lack ready basic aircraft. The Air Force is short 2,000 pilots. We MUST rebuild our military! The #NDAA authorizes the biggest boost in years.
The Opioids epidemic is a nationwide crisis that continues to ravage communities and claim lives in Arizona. Thankful that #POTUS understands we need to crack down on cartels trafficking drugs across the border, and support recovery in our communities.
Both of the recent New York terrorist attackers entered the country as a result of our failed immigration system that favors family connections and randomized selection over merit based values. We have to end #ChainMigration and the #LotteryProgram.
America accepts 1 million immigrants annually, and most are low or unskilled. In fact,  right now only 1 out of every 15 U.S. immigrants enter because of their skills. We must move towards a merit-based immigration system so America can be safe and prosperous. #SOTU
#POTUS is right ‚û°Ô∏è We MUST close loopholes in our immigration system, or else we'll face the same problems again, even if we 100% secure the border. #SOTU
Working w/ #POTUS Congress must get funding &amp; regulatory certainty to expedite the completion of projects like the Sonoran Corridor ($32.2BIL annual impact on our AZ regional economy) &amp; I-11 to enhance transportation &amp; cross border commerce w/Mexico &amp; Canada markets.
In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is "in God we trust." #SOTU
#RealNews: Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct at least 273 companies have announced wage increases, bonuses, or 401(k) match increases--including FedEx, Starbucks, Disney, Verizon &amp; JPMorgan Chase to name a few. #SOTU
#RealNews: Since we passed tax cuts, at least 3 million workers have already received tax cut bonuses ‚Äì many of them thousands of dollars per worker. 90% of Americans will see their paychecks rise next month. #SOTU
#Realnews:   A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half, thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct #SOTU
Real news: The state of our union is STRONG. Our economy is in afterburner. Wages are rising. Unemployment is at at 45 yr low. The stock market is smashing through record highs. Millions of Americans got tax cut bonuses.  #SOTU
