@TheEdMix @TTP_ThatsMe @ansel_daddy @maziehirono You‚Äôre misinformed &amp; could benefit from talking to ppl with a dif view. Reps. Are no more evil than dems. we have different priorities. Reps. support woman‚Äôs rights, doctors recommendations for abortions, but when a baby survives an abortion, the baby shouldn‚Äôt be killed.
@Paintking @sxdoc If this is true... I have a feeling that her local gas station could pull up camera footage to find the real perpetrator. something tells me in a neighborhood that voted her in by 78% - there can‚Äôt be that many ppl who would risk writing that about their beloved rep. Just saying

Her smile is creepy. And I'm sick of how she doesn't take this seriously.  #Debate
All talk. She's been in there for 30 years and now these great ideas??? Where was she when they were talking about Obamacare?
Don't put words in his mouth
She just laughs it all off
Really then why did you mess that up so badly. 3 emails is one thing 33,000 is a whole other ballpark
She doesn't sound sorry
This is not a joke. Stop laughing lady
Special prosecution has needed to be used and she just laughs this off???? This is not a joke lady. His is serious.
Yes the emails. Finally. Thank you!!!!
@rickrack18 exactly!! What about 33,000 lost government documents
She has never gone high. She was he one who released the tapes???? Ugh she's such a horrible woman.
Yes trump!!!!!!!!!
Who cares if he's not politically correct in his words????? I want a president who is going to get things done.  #debate

@megynkelly I am bipolar &amp; upset that we r blaming mental health-it's a moral issue.I would NEVER hurt someone w/ a gun or anything else.

#my2k Army fam.3 kids &amp; house.We do w/out, take no entitlements but look forward to tax season bc of refund. Can we expect less?
#My2K if we fail to compromise what does that mean for military families?
#my2k Obama please compromise. Just because you won doesn't mean that everyone likes or supports all of your ideas.
I don't blame hostess.  This is the problem with unions.
@AnnDRomney @mittromney thank u 4 letting us glimpse the remarkable life  u lead. Ur a great woman w/ great deal of strength &amp; courage.
@MittRomney I was proud to support you. It was a pleasure getting to know you and your lovely family. You are a true role model. Thank you.
@KarlRove @foxnews i don't believe that the only way to make an impact is to win the race. Way to go Romney.
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics I've never been so sad. My heart &amp; prayers go out to America &amp; the beautiful Romney family.
@DanaPerino respect your comments and thankful for your insights. My 13 year old daughter's role model.
@seanhannity bad omen. Gym that Obama played bball in today foreclosed  dun dun dun done.
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics my hispanic army husband voted for the first time and it was for Romney! So excited. So proud.
I trust Karl rove. Just told daughter he's a genius with numbers and politics.
What is the Best Raspberry Ketone Supplement for Weight Loss? http://t.co/9Viya04h
I am very upset that Obama swore. It's even more disturbing than some of his other outrageous statements or even bidens.
You will take the torch
What's the point of American business when you can sit home talk on your gov phone and get paid?
Obama did a good thing by seal team six going in. But leaked details that jeopardized future missions.
What? Is everything a lie Obama? Are you in another reality? Romney lies intelligence lies newspapers lie
@FoxNews luckily for him he's almost out
How is that possible when you fired 250,000 soldiers? More people out of jobs.
@KarlRove he also keeps glancing at his wife with the "can you believe this guy?" Look. Not cool.
Obama is jealous
Nice. Teachers unions are bad news for education.
Amen America. Romney!
You have a plan. Obama has a snide comment.
You didn't let him rattle you.
Mitt you are presidential. And you're making Obama nervous
More backbone.
Beautiful. Obama has no plan
Nice. We can't kill our way out of this mess.
Always nice to start with thanks and humor. God bless you mitt!
@KarlRove @gretawire @fnc if a teacher had student scores get worse over 4 yrs she'd get fired not hired for another 4 years.
@KarlRove fair shot runs counter to his policies for business.
@seanhannity the liberal Obama loving moderator really irks me. She has no right to put her 2 cents in. moderator not a commentator.
@megynkelly Megyn in 4 yrs can you be the female moderator? You would be less biased than candy Crowley.
@seanhannity but why are illegal immigrants getting instate tuition and my brother an Iraq war vet can't?
@MittRomney the voice of Charlie brown teacher is how Obama sounds about deficit. Wah wah wa wa wah wah
@seanhannity @mittromney so is Obama saying that woman who talk about the inequality are complaining?
@megynkelly $4 trillion doesn't add up! Love it. Nice response Romney.
@BretBaier balanced budget Romney knows how to tighten a belt. Obama just wants more money for frivolous spending.
#FNRdebate what about all of the green energy companies that have gone bankrupt? Obama's bad choices
#FNRdebate love Romney. Obama is the liar. Just because he keeps saying it  will never make it true.
@PaulRyanVP Job well done!  If you ever watch the tape, in the first 5 min Biden's jaw is shaking, he was very nervous to debate you.
@KarlRove I thought it was a great debate.  I liked how professional &amp; intelligent Ryan was, but thought Biden was too smug &amp; less informed.
Someone destroyed our Romney/Ryan signs in our front yard today. Fighting back. Bought 7 new signs! Go Romney.
@foxnewspolitics I don't get the impression that Obama really wants to be president again. Did he throw this fight?
@FNInsiders "fighting for jobs". It's nice to know that some1has their priorities straight. &amp; It's not Obama-care. It's Obama-scare-tactics.
@MittRomney too funny! Romantic place with mitt :-) humor is a great way to start. Thanks mitt!
So excited about this debate!
@MittRomney We (Army fam - husb in Afgh) vote Romney! Thank you for ur honesty &amp; courage.We trust YOU because you trust God not govt.
@FoxNews Shame on you Brett and Megyn - that was the US National Anthem.  You stand, put your hand over your heart &amp; show respect.
