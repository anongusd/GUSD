What else do you think we should add?
10. A budget that runs through the end of Trump‚Äôs term in office so our government employees cannot be taken hostage again.
9. Restoration of a full-throated attempt to the funding and promotion of the healthcare exchanges in ACA.
8. Raising the national minimum wage to $12.00
7. Full disaster relief funding for Puerto Rico.
6. The passage and codification of HR1.
5. Ban the use of eminent domain for the purposes of constructing the wall. If landowners want to sell, fine, but if they don‚Äôt government cannot force them to do so.
4. Stephen Miller‚Äôs resignation.
3. The reversal of the tax cuts among the highest income brackets as part of Trump‚Äôs tax proposal.
2. The full DREAM act including permanent codified legal status and a path to citizenship for those under the age of 15 when they entered the country.
Here‚Äôs what Democrats should counter-offer:		1. No more taxpayer money to any property owned by Trump‚Äôs family. If he wants to go to his Florida resort, he can foot the bill for the Secret Service himself.

@nathanshedroff The voting holiday/early voting I think will be an either/or proposition--meaning states will have to do one or the other. Some of these are bigger battles that I think need to be separate from my package.
I'm willing to hear other suggestions, and this is honestly just very basic, simple stuff we can do to improve elections that no one should object to, and those are the suggestions I'm looking for right now. /x
7. Require paper auditing trail and an electronic receipt for all electronic voting.	8. Require electronic voting machines to be independently certified to be up to date on software &amp; security requirements.	9. Allow any voter to opt for a non-electronic ballot if they choose. /10
5. Prohibit any chief election official from overseeing a federal election where they are seeking higher office. 	6. Prohibit any group or organization that distributes misinformation in election material from distributing election material in the next two federal elections.  /9
3. Require every population center above a certain size to have a voting center inside municipal limits with public transportation access.	4. If photo ID is required to vote, an location to obtain a valid photo ID must be available within X miles of every resident of the state /8
2. A precinct can move polling locations twice for federal elections in a ten year span. If additional moves are required due to an expected complication, Congressional approval will be required. /7
Additionally, if a state is shown to have significantly longer wait times at minority-majority precincts then they will be required to take similar actions: increase staff, retrain poll workers and split precincts. /6
If they have a similar violation the following election, they will have to increase staff and/or split precincts in order to reduce wait times for future elections. /5
If a precinct has more than one half-hour where wait times exceed 30 minutes or three half-hours where wait times exceed 20 minutes they will need to provide Congress with a plan to avoid those delays in the subsequent election. /4
1. We need to reduce and ultimately eliminate long wait times at the polls. As such, Congress should require monitoring of wait times at half-hour intervals on a precinct level, and those wait times will be published and audited after the election. /3
Some have suggested restoring the VRA, but I honestly think the VRA may not address some of the issues that we have seen at the polls lately. So, instead, I propose the following reforms. /2
Someone asked me this morning "What's next?" and it got me thinking about what Democrats should do with their new control of the House of Representatives. The answer is clear: Voting rights. /1

Even if the way you vote won't change your life any--your vote may change someone else's life for the better. But know that there are also people who don't want that other person's life to be better, because they see someone else's improvement as a step down for themselves.
What I'm saying is, voting is something that has real value. It's far from perfect and I know it is easy to become disillusioned when the world doesn't match your expectations. But people have given up so much so you can vote and have a voice.
People have given so much for you to be able to exercise the right to vote.	They've given tears.	They've given time	They've given sweat.	They've given blood.	Some have even given their lives.		And some still are working upstream against a society that does not want them to vote.
I'm happy to see how many of you have voted, but more than that I am happy to see how many of you have brought your children with you to participate in the democratic process. A fidelity to civic duty is a great thing to instill in the next generation.

I leave you know with a quote from Fred Rogers, whose neighborhood was hit today with an act of hatred and terrorism. I hope my Jewish followers will forgive me for quoting a gentile, but I feel these words must be heard this evening.
And the best way to do that, is love. Because love is the one commodity in the known universe that expands and grows as it is shared. Love costs us little and gives us so much greatness in return. Let us all be patriots tomorrow and show others just one act of true love.
Americans cannot and will not ever be satisfied with the country we have--to be a true patriotic American you must be actively working to make this country better tomorrow than the country it is today. That is American Patriotism.
The other day President Trump called himself a nationalist, and a lot of people get nationalist and patriotism confused.		Patriotism is pride in your country but American patriotism is a little different. American patriotism is pride in what your country will become.
I don't care how small or how large. Just one act of love. I have around 70,000 followers, imagine for a second what 70,000 acts of love could do. Love given selflessly, without the expectation of repayment or restitution. Because that is the first step to building a better world
Paton said something else. He said "But there is only one thing that has power completely, and this is love. Because when a man loves, he seeks no power, and therefore he has power.‚Äù So that is what I want you to do tomorrow. I want you to do one act of love for a total stranger.
And make no mistake--they are a minority. It may not always feel that way, but there are good people left in this nation and we outnumber those who embrace hatred, embrace fear-mongering and embrace xenophobia and racism.
He says all of this, by the way, while also claiming he wants to unite this nation. But he doesn't want to unite the nation--he wants the nation to unite around him and he doesn't understand this nation. He only understands those who follow him.
And as American thirsts for a President to give them comfort and care, to put away the partisanship and the bickering, instead he goes to rallies and delivers the same hateful, insulting rhetoric for which he became known. Rhetoric that demeans and attacks.
Today marks the 294th time this year four or more people have been shot in a single incident. That's just a couple shy of one for every single day of year.

Today in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and at least three additional handguns shot and killed 11 people at a synagogue during a bris. He wounded at least six others, including four police officers.
In addition to the people he attempted to assassinate, he put countless men and women of the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Secret Service at risk. I wish more people would remember that, as they--not the targets--likely would have been the victims.
Yesterday after days of terror, a man was arrested for sending pipe bombs  to many current and former Democratic politicians, officials and donors, as well as a news network. He was an avid fan of our President and his targets were also targets of the President's twitter ire.
What I do know is that on Wednesday a man walked into a Jeffersontown, Kentucky supermarket--having already been turned away from a predominantly black church--and shot and killed a black man before shooting and killing a black woman in the parking lot.
My heart is broken for America. I mean that. My heart is broken. We have gone through too many terrors, too many tragedies, and all in a matter of days. What is there to do but be broken of heart? This isn't a rhetorical question--I do not know the answers here.

@TeekeeMon @cody_k @Messina2012 @maggieNYT We can multitask, but this issue makes it harder to do so when we have candidates running for the Senate in places with significant Native American populations like Montana, North Dakota, Arizona and Nevada to get turnout in what is shaping up to be a narrow, pivotal election.
@TeekeeMon @cody_k @Messina2012 @maggieNYT All it does is needlessly take oxygen away from issues that desperately need oxygen, alienate ourselves from important allies, and generally serve as a distraction and a punching bag for which pundits and well-meaning people alike can take free swings at.
@TeekeeMon @cody_k @Messina2012 @maggieNYT ...that will do absolutely nothing to prevent the attack or reduce its effectiveness, and will also alienate Native American groups from our party and from our support because of the culturally insensitive manner in which this whole affair is being conducted.
@TeekeeMon @cody_k @Messina2012 @maggieNYT I'd much rather we talk about how Republicans are systematically preventing Native Americans from voting in North Dakota, or one of literally thousands of issues that actually effect people's lives, rather than a misguided and heavily delayed attempt to prevent an attack...
@TeekeeMon @cody_k @Messina2012 @maggieNYT You want to push back on his attacks? Be my guest. Do it when he's making the attacks not two years later, when it takes away oxygen from other issues, including a representation issue for the very people with whom you are claiming heritage.
@Strilaw @flycat636 No one is claiming that man-made climate change "made" this hurricane. Man made climate change is creating warmer waters in the Atlantic Ocean which is increasing storm intensity and the ability of storms to gain power quickly.
Indeed, powerful storms have occurred all throughout history. However, they are becoming increasingly common. Hurricanes are already becoming stronger, larger and more frequent, @Strilaw. These are basic facts. https://t.co/SU6CrpeKV8
Of course. @Strilaw, I am assuming what you meant was "most intense" hurricanes, but your list is limited to hurricanes that made landfall in the continental United States. Of the top ten 'most intense' hurricanes, six are from the last 20 years.
In fact, the six largest hurricanes in the history of the Atlantic in terms of diameter have all occurred in the last 22 years, though part of that may be advancements in satellite technology.
Those are not the two biggest hurricanes in history, Chris. First off, I think you mean 'strongest' because the two largest Atlantic hurricanes have been Olga in 2001 and Sandy in 2012. https://t.co/zZmzJXs35u
@cody_k When have facts ever stopped Donald Trump from making baseless racial attacks?
@TrenceA It's important to note that the only times families were separated before was when it was believed that there was either child trafficking, sexual crimes or drug smuggling involved when they crossed the border. It was not being done as a rule like recent enforcement.

@pobrengpepe Please show me an example of a Democrat who has called for civility, but refused to call out incivility on their own side. I'll wait.
-Sears, which employs 140,000 people, has declared bankruptcy.
-A Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Florida causing widespread devastation including at least 18 deaths, catastrophic damage to an Air Force Base,  and tens of thousands without homes, while the President denies man-made climate change is reality.
-A journalist was killed by the government of another nation, and the President of the United States is denying what our own intelligence has said about the situation.
So, just to recap:	- Children who were forcibly separated from their parents are being given up for adoption rather than reunited with their families.

People are so thirsty for leadership right now that they are drinking the leadership equivalent of motor oil, and you want to blame the problem on us when, for decades, you and others like you have built this environment.
If you don‚Äôt think that politics can solve political problems, why the hell are you in the U.S. Senate, @BenSasse?
You will never find me supporting a lack of civility.		I stand with @MichelleObama. 		But I also will not tolerate hypocrisy.
This should not be taken as permission to lack civility, but rather an opportunity to remain civil while pointing out the massive hypocrisy of those demanding civility whist supporting a man for whom civility is a foreign concept.
If Republicans actually cared about civility in politics, they would have censured President Donald Trump at least 20 times by now.		They only care about civility in-so-much as it can be used to attack Democrats and distract from discussions of policy.
There's nothing more hallow than the words of people who decry what they view as uncivil behavior from those they disagree with while standing in silent support of the most vile incivility that froths from those they agree with.

RT @JamesPMorrison: https://t.co/FBnwyN2TUI
@PicnicPatrick I am not. The article explicitly states they didn't do it as a rule and made efforts to avoid separation, but did do so in some cases.		Which is exactly what I said at the beginning. Find an article saying the separated families for reasons other than health, safety or security.
@PicnicPatrick The news story you cited disagrees with you.
@PicnicPatrick ‚ÄúICE could not devise a safe way where men and children could be in detention together in one facility,‚Äù Fresco said. ‚ÄúIt was deemed too much of a security risk.‚Äù
@PicnicPatrick From your article:		Most fathers and children were released together, often times with an ankle bracelet. Fresco said there were cases where the administration held fathers who were carrying drugs or caught with other contraband who had to be separated from their children.
@PicnicPatrick You should read more than the headline.
@PicnicPatrick If there is a safety or health concern? Yes. I don't think anyone would object to that.
@PicnicPatrick Or was, anyway.
@PicnicPatrick Re-read my original tweet, Patrick. The Obama administration did not separate families with the expressed, stated purpose of discouraging them from requesting asylum, which is what President Trump is doing.
@PicnicPatrick From the article:		Neither Obama nor Democrats created Trump's zero-tolerance policy, which calls for every illegal border crosser to be prosecuted and leads to their children being detained in separate facilities before being shipped to a shelter and eventually a sponsor family.
@PicnicPatrick Not as a rule, as an exception. Thanks for playing.
@fdmfive In most cases it wasn't that. at all. I suggest you actually read the stories of the migrant children who arrived here in 2012.
@PicnicPatrick No, my line is "you can stand there in your wrongness and be wrong." Because, well, you are.
@trogdor8768 There is a world of difference between separating families when you suspect human trafficking and doing it for every single family that crosses the border. So, yeah, it is a lie.
@PicnicPatrick Yes, it is all very true, and very awful.
@trogdor8768 @sistertoldjah I never said it was fine. But there's a difference between reacting to a crisis and creating one. Trump created one by separating children and their parents, all with no intent or plan in place to reunite them. 		Do you understand how that's different?
@PicnicPatrick If you're looking for the words here, Patrick, it was "I was wrong. I apologize."
@trogdor8768 @sistertoldjah Those were children who arrived at the border without supervision, but thanks for playing.
@PicnicPatrick It only happened under President Obama when there was a reason to suspect human trafficking or when there was a safety or health concern. I don't have any objection to that policy.		The Trump administration was doing it every single time.		Why advance this lie?
@PicnicPatrick And there‚Äôs been incivility in politics since there has been politics. I‚Äôm, quite frankly, far more concerned about children being separated from their parents in an attempt to discourage people seeking asylum in the US than I am someone being politely asked to leave a restaurant

@sistertoldjah Why do you continue to spread this lie? Obama Administration did separate children and parents in rare cases due to health and safety concerns. They weren't doing it for every family caught crossing the border like the Trump administration was. Do you understand that's different?

@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I guess that would depend on the conditions of that holding zone, wouldn't it?
@kriDan1 @GaryBateman3 Not advocating that. No one is. ATDs are not catch and release.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio We've had kids attempt suicide in holding, Jeff. Kids. I think that's a problem we created.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Fair is not an unbiased source, and I would not cite them if you want people who disagree with you to read and listen to you.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Actually, I advocate for ATDs, which monitor those seeking asylum and provide them with a case worker so they understand the process. Those see a massive retention rate through the entire process.
@BryanT2050 We can do both. In fact, refugees have a net economic positive impact on American society, which means they actually improve the lives of all, including those American homeless.
@kriDan1 @marcorubio That statistic is completely made up.
@SouRMilow @LisaDNews I'm getting my facts from a memo from Jeff Sessions, who announced a zero tolerance policy earlier this year that requires all families to be detained and separated when they were caught crossing illegally, even if they were requesting asylum with is a legal and human right.
@GaryBateman3 @lisaclanton3 Actually, his administration has a great effect on small business owners, who are not served well by the policies that have helped exasperate the situation of our ever-shrinking middle class.
@SouRMilow @LisaDNews Well, yeah. Because he's the only President who REQUIRED families to be separated as a rule. So of course he's the only one to end the separation requirement, because he's the one who implemented it!
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Let me ask a counter-question and see if you find it just as valid: How many suicides are we going to allow to occur in these facilities before we determine that a better course of action is necessary?
@BryanT2050 Actually, it does. Christianity requires you to give all of yourself in service of the poor, Bryan. By most people's definition, that would be pretty silly.
@SouRMilow @LisaDNews Only in rare cases before Trump instituted a zero tolerance policy earlier this year.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Which is exactly what Trump's plan for handling asylum seekers does. Which is why I am advocating ATDs.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio You don't want to get into a game of hypothetical what-ifs with me. If you want to go down this path, fine. But I'm going to give you a chance to make a more logical counter-argument here.
@sickofallthis1 @GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Plenty. Again, what moderate, mainstream proposal have they shot down? Name one.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Even Obama was not requiring all families who entered the country to be detained. He used ATDs when they were called for and most of the programs were extremely successful.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Certainly there are more humane ways to deal with that percentage than locking everyone up, is all I'm saying.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Well, first off, those who are not here legally are not eligible for "welfare". So, no, we don't. Secondly, a wall doesn't prevent anyone from getting into the U.S. easily. It's a waste of money and everyone knows it.
@lisaclanton3 @GaryBateman3 The context of the tweet I was responding to was immigration. And plenty of people's lives have gotten worse since he's taken power. I hope you'll consider them as well, Lisa.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Was talking about the corporate rates, which were slashed. We were told this would increase would be reinvested into the American worker but it's almost all been invested into stock buy-backs and actual worker take home pay has decreased, not increased.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio They don't have any control over it now, and you better believe I took it up with them at the time.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Can we agree that we should do everything to ensure they have proper council, since that is also key in retention throughout the process? Especially if we are going to split up families again?
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I'm not saying that ATDs should be the only option, but they should be AN option.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I'm not advocating it being applied to the entire population, but in this case there didn't seem to be a ton of pre-screening. Study after study has shown that when people understand the process, they stick around through the process.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Tax reform = massive tax cuts for the upper class, which Democrats did not support and have thus far shown to not accomplish their stated goals.	Border security = wasting money on a wall. Democrats will not support dumping billions of dollars into a wall.		What else do you have?
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio The study I found showed that so long as they had a case worker or legal representation, retention was almost 100%.  The Vera Institute of Justice even included non-citizens with criminal convictions and still had a 91% appearance rate.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio They held up a Supreme Court nomination for an entire year, so I'm not really sure that argument passes the smell test. That said, what non-outrageous things have Democrats not joined Republicans on under Trump?
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Except it wasn't just one program, it was several. Indeed, ATDs received a strong endorsement from TRUMP's DHS.
@lisaclanton3 @GaryBateman3 Anything that actually improves our immigration situation.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio That's across all programs, right? And we know what's included in the programs that work and what's included in the programs that don't. There are several programs that have rates that are basically 100%, right?
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Actually, both international and US law are pretty specific about requiring humane treatment of asylum seekers.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Yeah, people whose only crime is fleeing from violence and seeking a better life for their family should have to "pay" with time in what is, for all intents and purposes, a jail. That does seem really fair to me, Jeff.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio And how often does that happen, especially with full families with children?
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Perhaps if they were consulted, they would be more inclined to be involved.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio Well, first off, that's not an accurate description of what Democrats have done. Secondly, the same thing could be said about Republicans under Obama, and third, when they have opposed Trump's actions it has been ideologically consistent.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio And I think "jails, but for families" isn't a good or a humane plan, either.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I think you mean illusion. And catch and release suggests there is no monitoring, which is not the case either.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I think it's both needlessly expensive and needlessly cruel, especially when there are cheaper just as effective alternatives.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio "Should asylum seekers be released out of detention and into supervised homes with ankle monitoring and a case worker making regular visits before a final verdict on their asylum request is granted but after a credible fear interview is held?" is long, but far more accurate.
@ZacconeMaryann @marcorubio I share your disappointment in his performance. I just don't think he is as bad as Trump. But few people are.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Have no problem with humane group homes. But that's different than tent cities in the middle of the Texas heat.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I'm sure if you phrased the question as "do you think families fleeing violence should be housed in cells or in group homes while awaiting asylum hearing requests" you might get different answers and have a more factually accurate question. My policy isn't 'catch and release'.
@GaryBateman3 @marcorubio That's against both US and international law, and now how asylum works.
@GTLoneWolf88 @iflysims70 @marcorubio I think you mean 2017, and I also think you are woefully incorrect. They're going to need Democrats in order to pass any sort of immigration deal. Everyone knows it.
@GaryBateman3 What has he done, exactly?
@iflysims70 @marcorubio Democrats, by the way, had a legislative fix already drafted before any Republican even admitted this was an issue. It had 49 co-sponsors. Democrats reached to Republicans for support and were turned down at every opportunity.
@ZacconeMaryann @marcorubio I'm not the biggest fan of the Senator, but I would not go that far.
@iflysims70 @marcorubio That's not what he actually said, in context, though. If you want Democrats support, invite Democrats to help you draft it.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio I'm not saying every case is viable for ATDs. I'm saying outright refusing to use them is needlessly cruel and costly to the American taxpayer.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Yes, but that will take time and a lot of money to implement. Certainly we can determine low-flight-risk families and use structured ATDs which will both save us significant sums of money while being more efficient and better for the families involved.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio So, you don't think there's any circumstance that we should use ATDs for people requesting asylum and awaiting review? You realize how expensive that is, and how needlessly cruel it is to these people?
I fear just how many of these stories are out there. https://t.co/GIj5JKiDQr
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Especially when, as I'm sure you know, we are blocking them from entering the country legally.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio Actually, the study I have cited compares various rates and the effectiveness of different ATD programs. The bottom line is that they are effective and cost-efficient and there's no reason to detain every single family seeking asylum who entered the country illegally.
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio So, what you're saying is we already have systems in place to determine who are flight risks and who are not, and so there's no need for a zero tolerance policy that detains all families, which is what the current policy is, yes?
@jkempcpa @iflysims70 @marcorubio They were exactly the type of people we were needlessly separating until mere days ago, yes, you are correct Jeff.
@hollydolly1972 @marcorubio Look into ATDs.
@iflysims70 @marcorubio Republicans cannot agree on immigration reform, and they also refuse to bring Democrats onboard to attempt to negotiate on immigration reform. So, who again is stopping immigration reform? The same people as always. Republicans.
@iflysims70 @marcorubio There were several samples, all which reached the same conclusion, time after time after time.		And I've been outspoken about the need for immigration reform for years. I remember explicitly supporting Senator Lugar's efforts to do so.		And that's not what Schumer said.
@rkhill64 @marcorubio @RealMAGASteve And Obama, who could have handled the child migrant crisis better than he did (and I said as much at the time) was at least not creating more problems by separating families with no clear plan to reunite them. But I'm talking about what we can and should do now.
@rkhill64 @marcorubio @RealMAGASteve No, that's not accurate. We can (and have in the past) use ADTs which are effective, more humane and cheaper than family detention.

Not only are ATDs far less expensive than detention (which can cost over $300 a day, compared to an average of $36/day for the very best ATDs), but they also see extremely high appearance rates (generally over 95%).
The Trump administration will say that detention is the only way to hold and prosecute people who crossed the border illegally (because entry points to the US are being blocked on his orders) but that isn't the truth. The truth is there are many alternatives to detention (ATDs).

@tgriff716 First off, do you think that the media did cover the unaccompanied minor migrant crisis? Because they did, considerably.
@tgriff716 I agree. The situation has been bad for a while. But the Trump White House needlessly made the situation much worse, and they have no plan in place to repair the damage that has been done. Let's focus on solutions, not blame.
@tgriff716 That said, I think his lack of attention to it at the time shows just how hollow his whataboutism is now. I don't have a time machine, do you?
@tgriff716 Without going into too much detail, there's a lot he's leaving out when drawing the comparison. President Obama could have handled the migrant crisis he faced better, no doubt. But it wasn't a crisis of his own creation like the one we face now is.
@TheAnchoress @maggieNYT There was no need for the E.O., all that was needed was Sessions to issue a memo rescinding a previous memo. That's all that needed to happen. 		Also, all this EO does is set up a sure-fire legal battle over the detainment of minors for more than 20 days.
Joe Walsh was a U.S. Congressman between 2011 and 2013. I am unable to locate any bill he introduced or co-sponsored that dealt with this situation. 	https://t.co/7fpBiSWn6z
@WalshFreedom The Obama administration wasn't, as a policy, forcing families to separate when they arrived in the country.		Also: you were a member of Congress between 2011 and 2013. What bills did you introduce during this time frame to deal with this crisis better?
@SenRubioPress Why not work with the Democrats on improving their bill with 49 co-sponsors, instead of introducing your own bill? Why not work with the Democrats who you will need to pass this?
@smithjoel86 @goldengateblond As I said, I think this is a bit different than the tweet, and I wanted to make it clear why I (and others) were frustrated with people correcting the typographical error on the tweet.
@goldengateblond Not every liberal, mind you. But enough to where it was a clear trend. If you are going to cry foul on the small stuff, you have to also cry foul about the big lies, like "illegal immigrants are tied to higher crime rates", when the opposite is reality.
@goldengateblond I think there's a difference between what Chris did here, and what liberals did a few days ago when Trump sent out a tweet that incorrectly spelled "border" and also lied about immigrant crime rates. 		Liberals mocked the typographical error and ignored the lie about immigrants.

You either support taking babies from their mothers or you don't.
@bsniz The Democrats have already been working on a solution for weeks. Why are Republicans not working to improve and pass their solution, which is narrower in scope and only needs a single additional vote to pass?
@BornBlue2Bone @LMBGoodwin @blcartwright @TomCottonAR This is false. You are also defending a policy that separates infants from their mothers, ships them to another state, and has no plan in place to reunite them.

@cturtle31 @blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR That was true, until a few months ago when the Trump White House changed their policy to separate all families who entered the country illegally while at the same time they blocked legal entry points to people seeking asylum.		This is a policy decision.

@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR Okay, so why are you arguing against a bill that does just that? Why not try and improve the bill instead of spreading a lie about the motivations behind the bill or that the bill helps child traffickers? Why waste hours of time debating me about this?
@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR There are times in your life where you will be faced with a moral question that has a right answer and a wrong answer. This is one of those times.
@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR I'm not debating this anymore, Brian. You either support taking infants from their mothers or you don't. I'm against it. Are you in favor or opposed?
@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR My answer is that I'll support the President who doesn't create policies that needlessly separates mothers and their children. You support the guy who intentionally made a policy decision to separate infants from their mothers in order to make a point, Brian. Live with that.
@rideforthebrand @sciencecatlady @blcartwright @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR Now, why do you support taking infants from their mothers?
@rideforthebrand @sciencecatlady @blcartwright @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR Because I don't have a damned time machine to go fix what happened then, which I also spoke up about at the time. I can only fix what's happening now, which is far worse than anything that happened then. In part because it's something we chose to do.
@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR No, it is not the law. At all. This is a policy decision made by the Trump White House. Repeating a lie doesn't make it true.
@rideforthebrand This is exactly what they are doing, according to their own words, memorandums, and reporting from all sorts of sources.
@blcartwright @sciencecatlady @rideforthebrand @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR In extremely rare cases, where child trafficking was suspected.
@rideforthebrand @sciencecatlady @blcartwright @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR No, we weren't. Not as a rule for every single family that entered, only when child trafficking was suspected. This is a new policy, which I can provide several links to support.		Why do you support taking infants from mothers?
@blcartwright @meghanknorton @FelineAdvoCat @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR I prefer a President who doesn't take infants away from their mothers, ship them to another state to be placed in 'tender age camps' and who has no plan to reunite the mother and the child.		Why do you support that policy, Brian?
@Barbara51198335 Because you avoided my question the last time around, I thought maybe you didn't hear me.
So, you're okay with stripping an infant from their parent, shipping them to a 'tender age camp' in another state with no plan to reunite the mother and child? Because that's what the Trump administration is doing, right now. https://t.co/RnihvefG10
@rideforthebrand @blcartwright @sciencecatlady @LMBGoodwin @TomCottonAR Clinton, Bush and Obama were not intentionally separating families unless there was a reason to suspect the children were victims of child trafficking. They weren't blocking people from seeking asylum. Trump is doing it as a matter of policy for all families.
This is a person who thinks it is okay to take a baby away from the child's mother, ship them to another state where they are placed in a 'tender age' camp, all with absolutely no plan in place to reunite the child and mother. https://t.co/5n7NCd1q6M

@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR It prohibits them from a specific inhumane punishment: separating families, for that purpose. In part because the Trump Administration's own internal documents say it is not working.		Also, it's just plain heartless.
@DragonEmpressEn @blcartwright @TomCottonAR This is a policy decision, not a law.

@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR Yes. This has been well documented.
@DragonEmpressEn @blcartwright @TomCottonAR No, it doesn't, and it requires additional funding, which creates a whole host of other issues. Senator Cruz would be better served helping improve the bill with 49 co-sponsors then playing politics and starting from scratch.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR https://t.co/JfdprX6jNi
@DragonEmpressEn @blcartwright @TomCottonAR It's not a bureaucratic failure. It's a policy decision to have a zero tolerance and require separation for all families who entered illegally when the only reason they are entering illegally is because we are blocking access to locations where they can request asylum.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR See, again, your hatred is shining through. When you want to have a serious conversation, let me know. I'm done with this petty nonsense.
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR https://t.co/62oYA0Ogld
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR I'm not going to debate you about Obama's legacy. It's incredibly off-topic for our discussion.
@MrMeseeks02 @TomCottonAR You should re-read what you wrote. Goodbye!
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR And there are many situations where we have similar situations and we have policies and procedures in place to deal with them when they occur. That seems like a simple fix, not "protecting child traffickers", does it not?
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR You're still tweeting hateful things about President Obama and he's not been in office for almost a year and a half, Kieth. You're not exactly helping your case here. How about we both agree that we should judge each other on what we say and do, not people who agree with us?
@DragonEmpressEn @blcartwright @TomCottonAR So, you think that we should separate parents from children with no plans to reunite them?
@MrsMHL1 @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR Yes, they are.
@MrMeseeks02 @TomCottonAR Sure we do. It's also a legal and human right. Once you actually know what you are talking about, come back and speak with me. Until then, please let me talk to people who are being respectful.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR So, we've gone from none to some. Can't we just agree that there are people who do this regardless of side and I will agree to not hold them against you if you do not use them as an excuse to discount my perspective. I've been nothing but polite, respectful and patient.
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR Credible suspicion is not a high hurdle. And the law does not require them to be admitted to the United States, just not separated while they request asylum.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR So, if I provide an example of a float in a parade in 2014 that featured an effigy of Obama with a noose around his neck, you would cede that point?
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR so, if I find an example of someone in jail for a parking ticket, you'll cede the point?
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR It was a live interview!
@blcartwright @TomCottonAR Indeed. The law is pretty narrowly tailored to deal with the current issue of families being needlessly divided by a policy decision made by the Trump White House.
@DragonEmpressEn @blcartwright @TomCottonAR (that's not what the legislation actually says)
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR So, you won't listen to words from members of his own cabinet?
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR And you think no one on your side did anything like that to President Obama?
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR Jail time is not a required penalty for illegal entry. But how about trespassing?
@DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR Please show me where in the text it says anything resembling that. I'll wait.
@MrMeseeks02 @TomCottonAR They are requesting asylum, which is legal. 		Unlike your character on that absurd television program my grandson watches, you don't seem to actually be helpful or knowledgeable.
@NuruPoExcep @skphillips1982 @al2_bob @TomCottonAR Mexico or Belize may not be able to provide them refuge from the groups that they are fleeing from. What's more, requesting asylum is both their legal right and a human right.
@blcartwright @DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR So you don't think, absent reason for separation, families should stay together?
@blcartwright @NuruPoExcep @al2_bob @TomCottonAR Again, illegal entry is a misdemeanor. Should we take children from everyone who gets a speeding ticket and ship them to another state?
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR They are. We are blocking them from entering the ports. I've provided several sources, including Texas Monthly, documenting this case, many of which have raw video of the exchanges.
@blcartwright @TomCottonAR This is just about separating the parties, not detaining them, Brian. This bill does not prohibit detaining those who entered the country illegally, it just prohibits the families from be separated while they are processed.		They're only entering illegally to request asylum.
@DragonEmpressEn @MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR Okay, so do you think if you get a parking ticket your kids should be taken away and shipped to another state with no plan to reunite them to you?
@sw62811643 And we have methods in place to find and uncover that. They also make up less than 1% of all border crossings featuring adults and children. Less than a percentage point. Certainly you can understand this is overkill?
@DragonEmpressEn @TomCottonAR Well, it's a misdemeanor. When you are caught with a broken taillight are your children taken away from you and shipped to another state before you ever see a judge?
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR Please show me where I've done that. I'll wait.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR I presented two unedited videos of White House officials talking.
@NuruPoExcep @skphillips1982 @al2_bob @TomCottonAR A number of these people are not coming from Mexico but from Guatemala and El Salvador.
@MrMeseeks02 @TomCottonAR Plenty of the parents have paperwork, and there are several other methods to determine parental linage.
@amaiocco314 @TomCottonAR You're throwing children overboard because you think less than a fraction of a percentage of their parents may be criminals.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR And here's a story with memos from Trump's own DHS department outlining how that is not working: https://t.co/68p0LHdXba
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR Here is video of Jeff Sessions on FoxNews also saying it is being used as a deterrent, not as a response to human trafficking. https://t.co/fdIKOXp18k
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR I mean, they brought receipts, specifically notes from the meeting. Also, here's video of John Kelly in 2017 saying they are considering using this policy as a deterrent: https://t.co/7PcbIG0Lng
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR Now, before you say anything else, I want you to think about all the things you believed about Obama.
@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR Yes, I do. Because they've been talking about doing this in an attempt to discourage people from requesting asylum since the earliest days of his Presidency. https://t.co/lc1MogzQlk

@KiethMessinger @upsidedwnworld @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR The President is largely known to ignore his intelligence reports.

@MrsMHL1 @1kathyr @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR Here's a thread of stories about it:	https://t.co/u1QKlQNIYe
@NuruPoExcep @skphillips1982 @al2_bob @TomCottonAR We can have that debate. In the meantime, we shouldn't be separating children and parents for no reason.
@MrsMHL1 @1kathyr @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR Those places are being blocked.
@NuruPoExcep @skphillips1982 @al2_bob @TomCottonAR Yeah, they are. I've provided several links, and independent observers have witnessed and reported it as well. That's WHY there are so many families seeking asylum that are crossing illegally.
@MrsMHL1 @C_L_G_S @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR Yes, I used inexact language when I said U.S. soil. But you were incorrect that they can request asylum at consulates, which is something you insisted multiple times.
@NuruPoExcep @skphillips1982 @al2_bob @TomCottonAR The legal border crossings are being blocked, which is why they are entering illegally. We've already discussed this.
@MrsMHL1 @C_L_G_S @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR The law says "physically present in the United States". By legal definition, this does not include Embassies or Consulates. Please ask a lawyer, they will confirm. https://t.co/9TAQMbBP5H
@KiethMessinger @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR I've seen no effort to do that. But again, Obama wasn't separating families. He was dealing with a crisis of children arriving at the border without parents or guardians. You understand how the situations are different, yes?
@MrsMHL1 @C_L_G_S @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR You cannot request asylum unless you are on U.S. Soil.
@skphillips1982 @NuruPoExcep @al2_bob @TomCottonAR Only applies when child trafficking is suspected, Shannon. No requirement to do this for children traveling with a parent or guardian unless human trafficking is suspected.

@MrsMHL1 @C_L_G_S @bookerbmo @TomCottonAR The current policy is to separate all families even when there is proof of a familial relationship.
@amaiocco314 @TomCottonAR I‚Äôm willing to hear suggestions to improve detection. But separating all families as a rule is not humane.
@C_L_G_S @bookerbmo @MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR Because they are separating all families.
@NuruPoExcep @al2_bob @TomCottonAR No, the current administration is separating all families who entered illegally even when there is no evidence of trafficking.
@KiethMessinger @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR They are separating everyone from their children with the stated purpose of discouraging people from exercising their legal and human right to request asylum.
@KiethMessinger @AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR Which is why we have procedures in place to identify and separate cases where this is suspected. Which we have been doing for years.
@ed46510525 @AddieWoolf @TomCottonAR You understand that illegal entry is a misdemeanor, not a felony, right?

@ed46510525 @AddieWoolf @TomCottonAR I provided the text of the legislation Senator Cotton was talking about that directly contradicts what Senator Cotton had claimed about said legislation.
@bookerbmo @MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR Because the Trump Administration has made it clear that this is a zero tolerance policy that is happening to every single family that is crossing the border.
@KeepTexasRed7 @TomCottonAR Please point out to me the section of S. 3036 where that language appears. I will wait.
@WerIstDeinPa @TomCottonAR I'm always open to hear ways to improve. I'm not sure how separating children from their families helps children.
@MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR What is happening right now is that families with proof that the children are their own are being separated as part of the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy.
@lawrence_s There is some evidence to suggest that a few bad actors are, in this case, using children to try and gain entry to the United States. Which is why we have procedures in place to identify and prevent this from happening. Those can always be improved and I'm happy to hear proposals
@WerIstDeinPa @TomCottonAR It has been the policy for years to separate children from adults during credible cases of child trafficking, Abe. So, no, we won't.
@Reddened64 @TomCottonAR https://t.co/GLP5HAdAW2
@MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR Again, what is happening right now is that all families entering the United States and requesting asylum are being separated. Would you like me to provide you with several White House officials saying just that?
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur I have no problem with temporarily housing someone in detention facilities, provided they are not tent cities like the ones erected in Texas. But mostly I don't want children needlessly and cruelly separated from their parents.
@toxicmale13 @TomCottonAR Please tell me which section of the bill requires catch and release. I will wait patiently.
@MrsMHL1 @TomCottonAR What is happening right now is that the Trump Administration has instituted a zero-tolerance policy and is splitting up all adults and children, not just cases of suspected child trafficking.
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur (also, it's unclear they can adjust the 20 day window, since it was the result of a court settlement)
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur In part because they don't want to get in a funding battle and in part because they don't want indefinite detention of children and families. Children and families can be monitored while their cases proceed without being detained. You certainly know this.
Well, this was ill-advised. https://t.co/YSuZvxdYFl
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur Nothing in S. 3036 prevents that from occurring. Indeed, the provisions in the bill actually ensure that the family is kept together.
@Garner4Senate There's nothing in S. 3036 that does that, Senator.
@girlinseattle Here is that text: https://t.co/fHyoilFYv8
@TomCottonAR You just described S. 3036, Senator. That's exactly what the bill does.
@GemiknightPress @TomCottonAR If you don't read something and then claim to know its contents, that itself is a lie, is it not?
@jeanmurphy09 Yes, @OrrinHatch should of course sign on to S. 3036. This letter does not preclude such an action and, in fact, assumes that a bill will be produced and approved by the Senate.
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur If child trafficking is suspect, there are several tell-tale signs. We've been doing this for ages. If you have suggestions on how to improve our ability to identify the fraction of a percentage of border crossings that involve minors traveling with adults, I'm all ears.
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur The current issue with with families with children who are requesting asylum. We are blocking entry points where they can legally request asylum, so they are entering the country illegally. Then we are prosecuting them with a zero-tolerance policy, which is separating families.
@AllIn4DJT @TomCottonAR And, again, we have been dealing with that for an extended period of time and the bill Senator Cotton is lying about has text that is explicitly designed to deal with this known issue, which is less than 1% of all adults traveling with children across the border.
@bohmbawerk1 @sahilkapur You ask basic fact-finding questions, which are part of the process of requesting asylum anyway. This is something we have already done for years and years and years.
@RestiveRabble @thenigel @caroline_crane @JacquesCalonne @TomCottonAR The text of S. 3036 has a provision to address this specific issue: https://t.co/qVa6jDxDS2
@craigzimmerman6 @TomCottonAR Except, the text of S. 3036 carves out a clear exception for suspected child trafficking. https://t.co/5uu4h1LvEF

@sahilkapur Well, he's not a big fan of what he imagines the Feinstein bill says. His statements do not match the actual text of the bill. This is a deliberate misinformation campaign. Here's the text from the actual bill concerning child trafficking. https://t.co/1iMCAVjhn5

@dmartosko @dcbigjohn As you may recall at the time there was a crisis where children were being sent to the border alone by parents. This is what Secretary Clinton was responding to, not the Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy that needlessly and viciously separates families.
@dmartosko @dcbigjohn He never said you did. He was pointing out the silliness of bringing up Clinton's 2014 words in the current context. For the record, she was talking about unaccompanied minors arriving at the border, and was not advocating separating children from their parents.
@SpicyKeo @hernandezlg @JesseRodriguez But good luck convincing voters they should be against a law because it contains the phrase "there is a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families and children." I'm sure that will go well.
@SpicyKeo @hernandezlg @JesseRodriguez What is clear to me is that creating a separate bill rather than trying to improve the already existing bill with 49 co-sponsors is playing politics and trying to divide the two parties so nothing gets done, the exact thing Senator Cruz claimed to be against.
@SpicyKeo @hernandezlg @JesseRodriguez Such a definition in the bill does not do anything to prevent the government from reasonable detention. And if that's the only problem with the bill, Ted Cruz should offer significant GOP support (if he can--he doesn't have many friends) to make that modification.
@SpicyKeo @hernandezlg @JesseRodriguez That section of the bill is just laying out the thought process behind said bill, Randall. It does not require families not be detained, only that we should presume that detention is not good for families. Do you disagree with that statement?

@jimjimzen @paleofuture That is for "unaccompanied" aliens, Jim. Meaning minors who arrived here without an adult.
@jonniker It's not irrelevant to millions of people of faith who look to the scripture to decide what is morally sound.
@jonniker He cited the Bible because there were already Christian groups--including his own Church--coming out against the policy and he was defending the administration's actions from that attack.		He did so exceptionally poorly, but it was clearly his intent.
@jonniker I am the last to defend this administration for anything; however in this case it seems they've only cited the Bible when asked "how can you, as a self-proclaimed Christian, support such a policy?"
@jonniker For some people, that means turning to their church, or to the text. For other people, it means something different. We all have to make individual choices of what laws we find morally sound, which is the argument that is taking place here.
@jonniker I don't think it has been used to justify the legality of the direction (it's not a law), only rather to defend personal support for the actions therein, which, of course, is a personal decision not a legal one. I can use my moral compass to decide which laws are just.
@DocFletchLXG I'm merely trying to get people to ask the very question I asked you of themselves, friend. I think it's a question we don't listen to very much these days.
For every Bible verse you can cite to support this abhorrent inhumane policy decision by the Trump Administration to separate families, I can cite dozens telling you to do the exact opposite.		But it's not my judgment you should be worried about here.
He will answer them, ‚ÄòAmen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.‚Äô And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.‚Äù
Then they will answer and say, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and not minister to your needs?‚Äô
For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.‚Äô
Then he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
And the king will say to them in reply, ‚ÄòAmen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.‚Äô
Then the righteous will answer him and say, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?‚Äô
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.‚Äô
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Then the king will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

During World War II, 110,000 Japanese-Americans were placed in concentration camps inside of the United States, including 30,000 children.
This followed a century where children could be taken from their parents and sold into a life time of bondage, often never to see one another again.
For almost a century the United States forced Native American children into boarding schools in order to 'assimilate' them into our culture. That meant taking them from the only world they ever knew and stripping them of their language, their history and even their names.

Good morning and Happy Father's Day, @senrobportman. I see you touting several bipartisan bills in the Senate on your feed this morning. I am hoping you will help me and others make S.3036 a bipartisan bill and help end this inhumane separation of families at our Southern Border.
Good morning, Senator and Happy Father's Day. My understanding is that S.3036, a bill aimed at stopping the needless and senseless separation of families at our southern border, could use some of that bipartisan support you brag about. Can we count on you? https://t.co/wmNLlUm5OH
@lawnav How is this helping, George?
Good morning and Happy Father's Day @SenSasse @BenSasse. I was hoping you might explain to myself and my followers why you have not yet co-sponsored S.3036, which seeks to end the needless and heartless separation of families at our borders? Thank you in advance.
Unfortunately, @SenatorFischer, right now many fathers are needlessly separated from their families. My understanding is S. 3036 can stop this and needs co-sponsors. I am wondering what it would take for you to sign on to this proposal? https://t.co/xo0d7F2f1j
@emilyrmurtagh If you are able, and can reach out to her office by phone (or in person if you can) and ask why she has not co-sponsored the legislation, I would love to pass that answer along to my followers.
@cultofpolitics @SenatorWicker I am asking the question to the Senator honestly, and hoping for an honest answer.
@emilyrmurtagh I know. This is very tough. Are you also a Downeaster?
@bethmeacham Be sure to call (or better yet visit) one of his offices tomorrow, Beth. If you can get an honest answer as to why he has not co-sponsored S. 3036, I would be more than happy to share that answer with my followers.
I agree, @SenHydeSmith. Which is why I am so upset about the children at our southern border who are being needlessly stripped from their families and locked away. Surely with this sentiment you agree and will co-sponsor S. 3036, will you not? https://t.co/G6JS4oaQ1N
@emilyrmurtagh @SenatorCollins Come now, Emily. Let's allow the Senator at least the chance to respond.
Does supporting our President's programs include supporting the unnecessary and inhumane separation of families at our border, @SenatorWicker? I cannot imagine this abhorrent policy being something that you believe reflects Mississippi values. https://t.co/pkvYa1QCx6

Good morning, @SenatorCollins. I was hoping, as a resident of your neighboring state with many friends across the border, if you could help explain to us why you are not a co-sponsor of S. 3036. I'm sure your fellow Downeasters will appreciate an answer, as will I.

Good morning, @SenCoryGardner . It is my understanding that S. 3036, which seeks to end the needless separation of families at our border, could use some bipartisan support. Perhaps you could prove the Lugar Center right for us this morning? https://t.co/t7Wuc9Svjt
Good morning, Senator @JeffFlake. I have heard you many times talking about how your party will not stand up to President Trump. Perhaps signing on to S.3036 and saying loud and clear that separating families is wrong would be an opportunity to lead by example for your party?
A Happy Father's Day to him from me as well, Senator. Unfortunately, many father's are currently needlessly separated from their children. Can you explain why you have not yet co-sponsored S.3036 to stop this from happening? @LisaForSenate https://t.co/uQOibw4ibi

Happy Father's Day, @SenDougJones @DougJones. Many of us here worked hard to help get you elected in Alabama. I was wondering if you could advise us why you have not yet signed on to cosponsor S.3036. I'm sure my Alabamian followers will appreciate it as well.
Good morning, @SenatorHeitkamp @HeidiHeitkamp. I was wondering if you would explain why you have not yet signed on to co-sponsor S.3036. I am curious, and I'm sure my North Dakotan followers will appreciate it.
Good morning, @SenDonnelly. I was wondering if you could explain to me why you are not co-sponsoring S.3036. I have many followers from the great state of Indiana, a state where I attended college. I'm hoping you might have an answer for me and those followers, please.

This policy could end tomorrow. But if we sit back and do nothing, then we are complicit in this vulgar act.		And my God have mercy on us all.
So friends, I ask you today, tomorrow, and until this petty policy, this malicious mandate has come to a close to make it clear to your Congressman, your Senators, your neighbors, your friends, your acquaintances, your enemies and your allies that this cannot be who we are.
If we are to be leaders of this world--if we are to be fathers of civilization on this Father's Day, we must remember what it means to be a father, the be a leader. We must also remember our most sacred of bonds: Our shared humanity will all of our neighbors.
That's for those of you Christians defending this practice. As if "love one another as I have loved you" wasn't enough of a clue.
"Woe to those who enact unjust decrees, who compose oppressive legislation to deny justice to the weak and to cheat the humblest of my people of fair judgement, to make widows their prey and to rob the orphan." - Isaiah 10:1-2.
For those who seek solace in this barbaric abomination in Romans 13:1, let me first state the obvious: St. Paul's letter was not to the Roman authorities, but rather the Roman people. Fidelity to the law is not an excuse when you are universally making and enforcing that law.
For all the administrations talk of the rule of law, it must be noted that there is no law, no code, nothing outside of the orders of this administration--orders that could be very easily rescinded--that is forcing this inhumane action.
I can't help thinking of the mother who can't hold her infant, the child who is scared of the dark with no one to comfort him, the siblings torn apart by a cruel and completely unnecessary action that is just, for the lack of a better word, wrong. It is wrong on every level.
Today is Father's Day, and while we try and celebrate the fathers in our lives, I can only think of the fathers who have been forcibly separated from their children for no other crime than seeking out a better life for their family.

America's greatness is that it doesn't matter where you are from or who your parents are, so long as you are working for our shared future.
You can't find America's greatness by gazing to the past with nostalgic eyes. America's greatness can only be found by looking to the future

If you want to see America's greatness, look at the response from men and women around the country all wanting to do SOMETHING to help out.

America's greatness has always come from our people &amp; their desire to leave a better world for the next generation and the generation after.

The answer to America's greatness doesn't lie in a nostalgia for a past that never existed, but in our great unwritten future.
The journey has led to us to virtually eliminating small pox and polio. It led us over the Rocky Mountains and it took us to the stars.
America's greatness has always come from eyes firmly fixated onto the future, into what lies next in this journey we are on.
America's wasn't--isn't great because we built cars or dug coal. America's greatness doesn't come from the things that we create.
He would have you believe that our greatness lies somewhere in our past--but our past is rife with conflict and war, heartache and hypocrisy
Greatness is not defined by the respect of other nations. America's greatness has always been defines by Americans, not our neighbors.
America is not defined by what we produce or our standing in the rest of the world in various statistical categories.
The thing that bothers me most about Donald Trump is he has a total lack of understand about what made--and makes--America great.

@DavidSPJM No, that's not what the order said, at all. It said that Cuban migrants will be treated like migrants from any other country.
We split the atom. We went to the moon. We sequenced DNA.		We can do great things. Which also means we have the power to undo awful things.

The Word of the Lord.
He answered, ‚ÄúThe one who treated him with mercy.‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúGo and do likewise.‚Äù
Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robbers‚Äô victim?‚Äù
If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.‚Äô
The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, ‚ÄòTake care of him.
Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him.
He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them.
But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.
Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
‚ÄúA man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.
But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus, ‚ÄúAnd who is my neighbor?‚Äù
He replied to him, ‚ÄúYou have answered correctly; do this and you will live.‚Äù
with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.
He said in reply, ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being,
Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúWhat is written in the law? How do you read it?‚Äù
There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said, ‚ÄúTeacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

I don't know how the government fixes that.
It's why grocery stores are no longer local markets, but large, national mega-chains with the same options and layouts across the nation.
It's why we have Wal-Marts and not six or seven local small businesses serving the functions that Wal-Marts once provided.
Americans have, for better or worse, chosen cheap and fast. This, more than anything else, has created our economic woes.
There's an old saying in economics: Something can be cheap and good, good and fast or fast and cheap but it can not be all three.
Republicans will tell you that is because of the minimum wage increases, but it's not. It's just cheaper to have a computer than a human.
We've already seen automation come for jobs at airports and grocery stores. Fast food restaurants are next.
And Democrats should be worried about automation, because it is coming for low income jobs, minimum wage jobs next.
But I don't think I heard any Democrat talk about that, or cite that study, in the entire 2016 election. SOURCE: https://t.co/viNTBOeh6b
According to a study conducted by Ball State University, only 13% of American jobs were lost due to trade, compared to 88% from robotics.
Immigrants and outsourcing cost Americans jobs, but automation and mega-corporations cost far more middle class jobs than immigrants.
I think our message has been lost, and in the absence of an alternative message, people listened to anyone willing to fill that void.
Local government is where most of the decisions that you face every day happen, and right now Democrats seem to care less about them.

We can be a beacon of hope for the world, a place where anything can happen. Or we can close our doors. But we can't do both.
Why do we want to say no? Because it makes us FEEL less safe. Not because it actually makes us less safe. It doesn't. It actually helps us.
And some of these people, a small percentage, want a better life and they want it here in the United States. And we want to say no.
These people are caught in a battle between a dictator who uses chemical weapons against his own people and fundamental terrorists.
And governors--Democrats and Republicans--across this nation are letting fear a darkness into their hearts.
Thanksgiving is a time of giving thanks and sharing food and being generous to the people who come to our shores seeking a better life.

Fear can cause hatred, on both sides of the equation. Fear can make you blind to all that isn't right before your face
Hatred is almost always easier than love, because love requires patience, obedience, forgiveness and sacrifice. Hatred only requires passion

A few years ago scientists did a study where they studies which areas of the brain were most heavily used during different emotions.

.@mcdanell99 neither does the funding for Planned Parenthood. Keep up.
@AuburnElvis I'm talking about specific arguments used, not general support. Don't try and dumb me down. Not today.
@AuburnElvis No, it's not. I was talking about the logic applied. Applying the Democrats logic to abortion does not work.
@AuburnElvis That doesn't make any sense.
@Coyotecom @CLE4life216 I believe the final one was out of bullets as well, but I am not positive.
@Coyotecom @CLE4life216 One was in a car that got stuck in the grass. Another was a cop (again)
@Coyotecom @CLE4life216 That article lists one that was a cop. One that was a feud shooting between two families. One was out of bullets.
@Coyotecom So, I'm going to have to do this one by one, eh?
@Coyotecom @CLE4life216 You are aware that list has been debunked thoroughly, right?
If we have to wait until an appropriate time passes from a mass shooting event to discuss gun control, we would never discuss gun control.
.@CLE4life216 Then Amend the Constitution.
@therealsford @WillMcAvoyACN "guns don't kill people... but we should defund Planned Parenthood."
.@CLE4life216 @GrahamPaisley No one in this conversation is advocating banning firearms. Get a better argument, then come talk to me.
.@CLE4life216 The Republican Party is. Right now. And have been for some time.
.@CLE4life216 That said, unlike abortion, no one is seriously advocating for a blanket ban on firearms.
.@CLE4life216 How many mass shooting events have been stopped by a good guy with a gun, again?
.@CLE4life216 Abortion is legal. You don't like it, amend the Constitution. Until then, stop targeting groups that provide a legal service.
.@CLE4life216 But that's not what I meant, and I'm pretty sure you understand that.
.@CLE4life216 And guns, far too often, are not used in defense but in acts of violence against others.
.@CLE4life216 Abortion also saves people's lives and prevents children from being raised by families that cannot afford to have them.
Imagine if Republicans applied the same logic to gun control as they do to abortion control.

@soonerzen14 Maybe when presented alone, but I presented it in context with overall suicides.
@cburchie Yes, because I was never known for my speeches or long diatribes during my term in office. Want to hear about our national parks?
@soonerzen14 The point is that this issue continues, daily, and we aren't doing anything to stop it.
@soonerzen14 But I think it is the size of the issue itself that makes it seem insurmountable, not the 'every day' part of it.
@soonerzen14 I disagree, but I understand. The per day amount is designed to show the scope of the issue for sure.
@TFox Additionally, I like it, so I will continue to do so. That said, I encourage you to unfollow me if you don't like it. That's fine.
@TFox I'm sorry you don't care for it, but I've been told repeatedly by a number of followers that they enjoy it and they ask me to continue
@TFox There's no right or wrong way to tweet anyway, and I was making a larger point I thought people should see.
@TFox No offense, Thomas, but I'm not going to take advice on how to tweet from someone with eight followers.
@TFox Sometimes you have to talk a lot to get people's attention, and not everyone has a clean of a feed as you.
@TFox I tweet a lot. I even put that in my description.
@soonerzen14 I think the opposite. I think that it makes it clear that if you can change one or two people a day, you can make a difference.

@kieranbullen Furthermore, eliminating cheap and plentiful access to guns would go quite nicely with strain theory.
@kieranbullen Except you have to also look at the base income level in order to make any logic of Strain theory.
@essobi I don't know if it will lower attempted suicides, but it will lower successful suicides. That's the point.
@kieranbullen And a much worse economy.
@kieranbullen I mean GDP per capita.
I find my self consistently amazed at the sheer volume of people who believe that we are only capable of doing one thing at a time.
.@essobi No one, and I mean no one that argues for gun control is arguing against higher mental health standards.
.@essobi We'll never be able to fully prevent either, but if we only focus on one, our progress will be stagnant.
.@essobi You're ignoring the reality: we have a mental health issue and we have a firearm issue.
.@essobi I say we have both.
.@MrLAJackson Meaning the right to own A gun. Not any gun.
.@MrLAJackson It does not say "The right to bear whatever arms you want under any circumstances", it says "the right to bear arms".
.@MrLAJackson I am following the second amendment. You seem to be ignoring that. It doesn't say what you think it says.
.@essobi We can do both at once.
.@MrLAJackson Or an automatic rifle? Or countless other firearms?
.@MrLAJackson Then why can I not go to a gun store and buy a bazooka?
@jacobwm I didn't say possession in a crime, I said illegal possession. There's a huge difference.
@essobi Inact high penalties for illegal possession, double them if they are used in a crime, quadruple them if it is a violent crime.
.@MrLAJackson @invisiblemaps The second amendment says I cannot ban guns, it doesn't say I cannot regulate them.
.@essobi Because you can go to Normal, Ill. and buy all the firearms you want.
.@MrLAJackson My interpretation is this: You cannot completely ban firearms. But you can regulate them heavily.
.@MrLAJackson And we don't agree on the meaning of the second amendment, because I believe it does give the right to regulate firearms.
.@MrLAJackson That's not what I asked. I asked you to make a logical case on why we shouldn't regulate guns like we regulate speech.
@jacobwm Yes, and part of any sensible gun control proposal would be far tougher penalties for illegal possession of a firearm.
.@essobi ...has less than half the murder rate of the United States. So while you may 'feel' like gun control works, I KNOW it does.
.@essobi You may not 'feel' like gun control is effective, but every nation with a comparable socioeconomic climate to the United States...
.@essobi The evidence from around the world disagrees with you there as well.
.@MrLAJackson Again, a logical argument, based in facts, not your interpretation of the Constitution.
.@MrLAJackson Provide to me a logical argument why we should be able to limit free speech but not firearm ownership.
.@MrLAJackson You're entitled to your open opinion. Now back it up with facts.
@Jeff_Sharon @essobi There's actually three: suicides, accidental killings and homicides. Suicides are the most ignored.
@ethanling @essobi Yes, because women are far less likely to both attempt suicide and use a firearm to do so.
.@MrLAJackson As someone who has been shot, I think I'm fully qualified to talk about firearm issues.
.@essobi In short, statistics disagree with you.
.@essobi Survival rate for other methods of attempted suicide is greater than 50% Survival rates for attempted firearm suicides is below 10%
.@essobi There are thousands of suicide survivors who would strongly disagree with your first point.
@Mamma_Monkey On the other hand, females are more likely to choose pills then men, though men are four times more likely to commit suicide
.@Mamma_Monkey Suicides by pills make up a significant amount, around 6,599 in 2011. But a far cry from the 19,392 firearm suicides.
.@essobi 781 suicides in 2011 from "a fall". 19,392 from a firearm. We don't have an epidemic of people jumping off bridges.
Firearms make suicide attempts far more likely to be successful, and far to often it is young people seeking escape from a temporary problem
That's not because guns make people suicidal. It's because suicide attempts with a firearm almost always end in death.
Something lost in the gun control debate far too often is that over half of all American suicides are committed with a firearm.
@kieranbullen But Norwegian gun laws are designed to protect gun ownership for hunters and sports shooters, not for protection.
@kieranbullen Norway is a largely rural country, so you would expect a low murder rate to begin with, mind you.
@kieranbullen And every single nation outside of the US of comparable economic status has stricter gun control laws than the United States.
@kieranbullen Every single nation of comparable economic status to the United States has less than half the murder rate of the US.
@kieranbullen ...not only to reduce accidental shootings, but homicides as well.
@kieranbullen Or the idea that common sense gun regulations, like requiring someone who owns a gun knows how to use a gun are shown...
@kieranbullen Or the fact that the United States has twice the murder rate of any country of comparable economic status.
@kieranbullen How about Australia and New Zealand, which passed gun control laws and saw their murder rates drop significantly?
@jacobwm Let's start with expanded background checks, which 90% of Americans approve of, and go from there.
Well I CANNOT ACCEPT THAT
The other option is to simply accept that the price of the freedom to bear arms is every four months a madmen will go on a rampage shooting.
Certainly we can make the same concessions we have made with the first amendment to the second amendment and be just as free.
We've done all these things, and some of them for better reasons than others, because these are limitations that just make sense.
We have seen, throughout this country, protestors thrown out of public buildings for doing nothing more than speaking or sitting silently.
We limit where people can talk, when they can talk on public grounds through permits and other laws.
You cannot, for example, say something that would cause imminent lawless action, such as inciting a riot, without the fear of legal penalty.
We have freedom of speech, but we also have limits to that speech if there is conclusive evidence that speech would harm someone.
Three Presidents, Once Speech: http://t.co/x2uzCYfs44 via @youtube
.@ian_Wright Clubs, hammers, etc. accounted for 496 out of 12,664 murders in 2012. Your stat is imaginary.
.@ian_Wright http://t.co/NgkIysEEWs
.@ian_Wright That's simply not true. Two of every three murders in the United States are committed with a firearm.
@ian_Wright I am fully aware of the how the Constitution works, and the limitations on free speech that do exist.
.@CaptainAnjos Words also have the advantage of not killing anyone directly.
@ian_Wright For example, you have the right to gather, but after a string of fires in nightclubs there was a huge firecode crackdown.
@ian_Wright If it continued to happen, yes, I imagine there would be.
@ian_Wright We have sensible speech control. You can't yell fire in a crowded theater.
My support of sensible gun control has absolutely nothing to do with politics.
I'm not entirely sure how wanting safer conditions for all Americans is politicizing a situation.
Goodnight, and God Bless Everyone.
We will never forget that mankind is capable of great horror. Let us also never forget that we are capable of a far greater love.
We can face darkness with light, fear with bravery, hate with love. These are skills we possess. We should use them more.
@archiearchive @Aitch_El Thank you for proving my point.
@Crommunist Thank you. We can do that tomorrow, I think.
"But I say this to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." - Matthew 5:44.
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me. Matthew 25: 35
That's what we should never forget. That's what we need to remember.
For many of us, 9/11 may be the greatest tragedy of our lifetime. Let us not forget that when faced with darkness, we chose love.
We remember the anger and the fear, and we forget that, if only for a brief time, our strangers were our friends and we were all in pain.
But what I am already seeing is that we remember the horror but forget that the horror was overwhelmed by acts of love and kindness.
We can remember the pain, the fear, the suffering, the horror. I don't think there's any risk of us forgetting that.
Let's never forget the men and women who, in the face of certain death, ensured that others would be safe.
Let's never forget the men and women who ran into the fire in order to save their fellow man, and never forget the sacrifices they made.
Let's never forget the people of Gander, Newfoundland, who let strangers into their homes as they were stranded.
Let's never forget the acts of bravery, of compassion, of love, of caring that we saw throughout the nation and yes the world.
When we say "never forget", let us chose to remember not the horrible acts, but rather how we responded to these horrible challenges.

@andreweplotkin Oh, I didn't think that.
@andreweplotkin this is more a reaction to the gun bill failing than Boston.
@andreweplotkin I had planned this before Boston.
@marianaarechiga The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They regulate the sales of these items.
@andreweplotkin People may do the job without a leader in charge, but I can't imagine a company going without a CEO for 7 years.
@andreweplotkin There are several articles out there about the troubles facing the ATF.
@andreweplotkin I'm not asking for them to confirm the nominee, I'm asking them to have a HEARING for the nominee.
@andreweplotkin ...instead of attempting to do two jobs at once. It allows for reforms to be made easier
@andreweplotkin It allows for changes to be made in operations and allows the nominee to focus on his job...
@DanCas2 The Senate has the right to confirm executive appointments.
If B. Todd Jones isn't the right man for the job, let's find out. But let's stop dragging our feet in the sand.
I encourage each and every one of you to contact your Senators and ask for a hearing date for B. Todd Jones.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been without a director since 2006, when the Senate added confirmation requirement.
President Obama nominated B. Todd Jones to become the director of the ATF in January. A hearing has not been scheduled.
Maybe now @Sen_JoeManchin can join me in trying to get a hearing date for B. Todd Jones.
.@Sen_JoeManchin admitted his bill to expand background checks for firearms will fail on the floor of the Senate. http://t.co/vBiB4Ig7vT
@katrix110 I meant to write Senators. Only the Senate confirms the head of the ATF.
@BlueWaterDays That doesn't mean we cannot do our best to reduce it, Gary. To surrender our desire to is to give up what makes us human.
I hope to wake up and find that you have all contacted your Senators and asked them the same questions I've been asking.
Anyway, with that, I wish you a good night. God Bless. I love you all.
I have to say, I'm amazed at the number of Senators who do not follow a single person on twitter. They don't get it, I guess.
I will retweet any responses I get from the US Senators, to let you know who responds and what they say.
I know I filled up your feeds this evening, and I'm sorry if that upsets you. But if you expect any less, you should follow someone else.
If you oppose a nominee because they are not good for the job, that's why we have hearings in the Senate.
B. Todd Jones has been nominated since January, and the Senate has not even scheduled his hearing, as the ATF struggles without leadership.
I want to point out that I was not asking any Senator to support the nominee, simply asking them to support holding hearings for the nominee
However, at least Bush's nominee got a hearing. President Obama's nominees have been unable to even obtain a hearing.
The Senate has been without a head since 2006. George W. Bush's nominee was held by members of his own party for two years.
I have sent a tweet to every member of the Senate asking if they will support hearings for ATF nominee B. Todd Jones.
@theblackkestrel Right.
@pat_schernekau Tweet softly and carry a big stick.
Finally, @RonWyden, last of the rollcall. No ATF head since 2006. Will you support hearings for B. Todd Jones?

@WilliamKramer Yeah, but you're down the road from all their offices.

This evening I will send a tweet to every member of the U.S. Senate asking them to commit to a date for the ATF confirmation hearings.
@mycoskie It's based on tax laws. Was originally part of the Treasury Department.
It's not that they won't confirm a head of the ATF, it's that they will not even consider naming a head to the ATF.
B. Todd Jones was nominated in January to headThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He still does not have a hearing date
I don't think it's wrong to suggest that we need a head of The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
@adamzwiner Saying is equally Democrats and Republicans here is disingenuous.  http://t.co/zIL72Wl7uv
@adamzwiner Not exactly. Bush's nomination was blocked by three Republican Senators. http://t.co/WVGkiAKcDv
Senate has refused to confirm any nominee to head the The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives since requiring confirmation.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not currently have a director, and has not since 2006.

I do not know what could bring someone to do the things that were done today. I'm not sure I will ever understand it.
We cannot forget that the good people of the world outnumber the bad people, and it isn't even a close batter. We outnumber them.
We must do our best to exemplify those qualities, the qualities that make us great, not just today but everyday.
For every example of evil in the world, there are hundreds of examples of the pure goodness the lies inside of each of us.
We can be angry. We can be fearful. But we cannot let these emotions take hold and harden our hearts.

@al13nrav3n Since you're the first person to mention Lincoln, I'm not sure what exactly you're talking about here.

@al13nrav3n Wrongly. You want to rebel against authority? There are better symbols for that. Like James Dean.
.@fubar2u_2000 @ThatDouche Yes. Specifically, the right to own people as property.
@Glenn_OBX I'm going to need to do some research to respond to those claims. I'm not familiar with that incident.
@ThatDouche The Confederate Flag represents one thing and one thing alone.
@ThatDouche The American flag can represent many things, some great, some not so great. No one denies our past sins.
@Glenn_OBX No, but then again, we also didn't have a democratic process to make our voices heard without war, now did we?
@Glenn_OBX Not to mention the federal prosecutors that filed treason charges against the Confederate military leaders.
@Glenn_OBX Again, James Madison, Andrew Jackson and the United States Congress that readmitted them to the Union disagreed.
@ThatDouche Only one is nothing but distasteful, Andrew, and I think you know that and are just trying to be provocative.
@Glenn_OBX They were Americans, and they sure wanted to be Americans after the war was over.
@Glenn_OBX And if Congress has the power to admit states into the Union, surely exiting the Union must come with Congressional approval.
@Glenn_OBX So, by the way, does Andrew Jackson.
@Glenn_OBX James Madison disagrees with you.
@ThatDouche What is your point, because you're not really making one.
@timoteohines That's the second most foolish thing you can do.
@Glenn_OBX "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them...."
@Glenn_OBX Several prominent Confederates were indicted for treason, but they were given a blanket pardon by Andrew Johnson.
@Christian__Amy I don't think anyone denies it, just thinks it's history.
@Glenn_OBX It was treason.
@Christian__Amy Democrats became the party of integration in 1964 and have been so ever since.
@Glenn_OBX They don't even know their own history they claim to be celebrating.
The only thing more foolish than displaying a Confederate Flag is doing so in West Virginia or Indiana or Ohio...
@Christian__Amy How many modern Democrats do you know that were old enough to be members of a political party in 1950?
@ThatDouche And my point is this flag was created with the sole purpose of flying while committing treason so you could own people.
@Christian__Amy A lot has changed since the 1950s.
@ThatDouche It wasn't flown exclusively for that.
@bobdoty Treason, in the 1860s.
@ThatDouche I don't think the American flag was ever flown for the side of a war that was fighting to maintain their right to own people.
The South and the Southern people have a rich cultural history, and they would be well served by finding a better symbol to unite behind.
The Confederate Flag was used by protesters opposing desegregation in the 1950s, and in support of "Jim Crow laws".
The Confederate Flag is a symbol of treason. Treason in the name of treating human beings like pieces of property.
@GusCahill Sure it does. An armed but untrained civilian has never taken out a person committing a mass fatality incident.
@yareunot 1. injured, not dead. 2. No one's talking about banning guns.
@EdwardsOhio Yes. It's in one of my followup tweets.
.@vongillern @WillMcAvoyACN How many guns does one usually need to defeat an atomic bomb?
@Bsilverstrim77 @q00u The rest of the first world.
@mhessing I'm not talking about media coverage. There's never been an active shooter/stabber stopped by an untrained civilian.
@q00u @peterribilita Evidence, not anecdotes .
.@GusCahill How many mass shootings/stabbings have been stopped by an untrained civilian with a gun? Answer: None.
@q00u @peterribilita Additionally, no one is saying anything about banning guns, simply restricting access to some guns.
@q00u @peterribilita There's no evidence to support that claim.
.@JRubinBlogger You know what I hate? People who say "liberal" or "conservative" when they mean "political".

@nekware @Ademir818 There have been several studies that have shown this. I've cited a couple others earlier.
@nekware @Ademir818 Not sure about the head, but, the chest, yes. http://t.co/4UNbRbTmjo
@Daniel_Averill @EarthBadge Who goes hunting with a handgun, or an AR-15?
.@Ademir818 My point was simply this: you're much more likely to survive a stabbing than a shooting. That's a fact.
.@Ademir818 Your argument was that people can survive getting shot. I'm aware. I'm one of them.
.@Ademir818 Actually, you're arguing a point no one made the counterargument to.
@comebackshane @Daniel_Averill http://t.co/1jXrXQYk15
.@MrsSaraJTeece Now, the implication was that you are far more likely to survive a stabbing than a gunshot. Which is a fact.
.@MrsSaraJTeece The word you're looking for is implied, not implicated. Unless you thought I was showing someone to be involved in a crime.
@WOGFilm Because they know they won't get any traction on handguns.
.@MrsSaraJTeece Where did I say knives don't kill people?
.@Ja_Mor You are far more likely to survive an intentional stabbing than an intentional shooting. That's the point, James.
.@Ja_Mor That said, the mortality rate and severity of injuries with gunshots is significantly higher than stab wounds.
.@Ja_Mor I didn't say that. I said that no one died in the mass stabbing event that occurred in Texas today.

.@Daniel_Averill The Journal of Trauma did a study. Found the mortality rate for gunshots at 22%, stabbings at 4%.
@BClark87 Am I ever not?
@BClark87 No one died, and no one is saying ban all guns.
17 people were injured in a stabbing spree in Texas today. I am able to use injured instead of killed because the suspect didn't have a gun.
