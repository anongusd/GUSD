@CammilleJ Yea lol
@jeffpearlman This really isn’t a debate. First Ballot guaranteed
@hoopshype Lawson&gt;Larkin
@ChiTown_Eazy That’s a direct threat from Drake. But Push still continued. Don’t make threats and then sit in silence.
@A_Hahdee @Sam_Vecenie @SeanDeveney The addition of Hayward and Kyrie makes them better with or without Jaylen. No? And adding an elite rim protector (potentially) is really a bonus.
@Sam_Vecenie @SeanDeveney @A_Hahdee With or without Jaylen the Celtics will be in the Finals next year. It reallly isn’t a bad idea at all when you put that into perspective.
@YahooFinance @CNBC An article on Amare but y’all put a pic of Chris Paul. Wtf!!??
@NerdNumbers Coordinated doesn’t mean you’re a top athlete and yes Kevin is not an above average one. Along with Aldridge and the ZBos of the world. Nothing racist about it
@WaqasIrfan786 @CryptoInsiderX My man
@CryptoInsiderX hey bro which site shows this info you're displaying
@AndrewDBailey Are u suggesting somehow Jimmer is a better player than Ty
@HerringtonNBA Jameer might have a few up on Mack
@RealDealBeal23 Naw bro.. Had @Keefmorris simply ran Kyrie off the 3pt line yall woulda won
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @boogiecousins Deandre has, so he better than Cosuins too? Of course not, so that argument doesn't work.
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @boogiecousins Rudy's awesome for what he is.. He just isn't capable of doing the things Boog does on an average night. It'll be ok once you accept Rudy for who he is. Clearly Boog is better than what u thought
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @boogiecousins Def not the same thing.. But a 200% healthy can't produce at Boogie's level
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Just as @boogiecousins was proving to all these dudes he's clearly the best Center in the league the bullshit happens smh. Get well soon big dog
@jcy0521 @Anchor_Taylor @King_Yunn @streetsdiscip1e Bro. That dude is really lost 😂😂😂😂
@Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @King_Yunn @streetsdiscip1e Dawg what😂😂😂.. that was AFTER Kyrie put them up 3. Game was already over
@jcy0521 @Anchor_Taylor @King_Yunn @streetsdiscip1e He has no clue what he’s talking about. At all!!
@jcy0521 @Anchor_Taylor @King_Yunn @streetsdiscip1e Exactly. What?????
@King_Yunn @Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e I don’t. I just said Bron cup game is elite why would I contradict myself
@King_Yunn @Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e Kyrie made the most important shot in cavs history. That moment mattered more than any other moment ever in that whole franchise. And Kyrie was the one with the ball. Think on that
@King_Yunn @Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e When did I say every game? When it mattered most Kyrie was the guy. Therefore we can’t have a conversation if u don’t even understand what that means lol. Carry on bro
@King_Yunn @Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e Obviously
@King_Yunn @Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e Melo's ISO, 1,2,3 dribble game has been elite from the start. Bron stunk early on, still isnt that comfy thats why Kyrie was the closer. Didn't even get a post game until after the Dallas finals. His shot selection and cup game is elite. Hence why he's so efficient.
@Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e Not saying Melo is a better scorer than Bron. I’m saying if one guy scores more he’s automatically the better scorer is a myth. Bron is extremely efficient, Melo has more tools in box. Depends on how ppl define better scorer
@Anchor_Taylor @jcy0521 @streetsdiscip1e Take into account some ppl just play more games and therefore score more points as a result.. Karl Malone aint a better scorer than Kobe, dude just didnt miss a game in his life.
@TheRenderNBA Pop's non reaction should tell u chances are it wasn't a foul
@chryspto Yo bro. What does it mean to trade let’s say for instance ICX/BTC for ICX/ETH? I guess it means it’ll value ICX in either BTC or ETH? How do I value them to see what will benefit me most?
@RtcCoinz @RNR_0 Indeed. Thanks
@RtcCoinz @RNR_0 Thanks for the insight bro. Are any of the banks actually using Ripple yet?
@chryspto Thanks man!
@chryspto Hey man. Def a noob here, just want to know the best resources for researching coins and how would I get news on all new white papers that become available
@RNR_0 I’m probably a normie but I would like to learn about how stuff works. What’s wrong with buying XRP?
@Genius Wale said that
@TheRenderNBA I mean he does. They are designed plays
@NBA_Buckets Russ stinks
@shamshammgod Absolutely. Presti prob did see it as a worst case scenario. Sitting in Sam's seat you're just hopeful Russ's ability to get in the paint combined with PG n Melo catch n shoot ability would be a great fit, They just dont play that way and they all deserve blame IMO. Donovan too.
@shamshammgod Most GMs league wide would have pulled the trigger on PG and Melo deals in Presti's place, no? i don't think Russ is all to blame but if he was smarter they'd win a lot more games IMO. His decisions on the court are easily among the worst in basketball
@shamshammgod This is a bad take man.. He is fully capable of moving without the ball &amp; setting screens just like everyone else. You can ask any player to do anything the team needs and for the sake of winning they should do it.
@bballbreakdown @OfficialNBARefs we need answers
@TrolldenState If you can’t even acknowledge that he saw the kid then that’s an even bigger problem
@TrolldenState @d1pat_ @shellsjr13 @LetsGoWarriors @1kJevon How u know if he signs autographs after games or not what you his publicist lol. He probably does it all the time I’ve personally seen it. This day he just got caught being a dick. Don’t make excuses for him the shit happens
@TrolldenState @d1pat_ @shellsjr13 @LetsGoWarriors @1kJevon He was CLEARLY ignoring him on purpose. Don’t be that guy who turns a blind eye to shit just because you like someone
@TrolldenState @d1pat_ @shellsjr13 @LetsGoWarriors @1kJevon Please dude. Nobody waits in line for an from autograph Steph that area would be super crowded. He chose to look like an asshole and ignore the kid. And do not kid yourself, there is no bus leaving without Steph Curry on it
@SLAMonline Then put up a real image of the kid!
@jtylerconway If KD 6’9 then Tyson Chandler not 7 feet. https://t.co/87V1ltJnw9
@JoshEberley Peek Mike Miller!
@PaulHeadleyNBA Lol yea I’m with u on that
@PaulHeadleyNBA Or maybe he was never allowed to coach his way and that was the problem
@RiskyRoss22 @damanr Dude goes 1-7 in the 4th quarter and somehow it’s Melos fault. Truly insane https://t.co/0WAcF8rdzu
@RiskyRoss22 @damanr It shouldn’t be this hard for him he’s too good. It’s simple, make good decisions with the basketball. He’s not doing that and thats his fault
@RiskyRoss22 @damanr This is really no excuse for Russ playing like shit. If he’s himself they win games
@JRAM_91 Melo is actually a threat. Russ doesn’t know when and when not too shoot. He’s the problem
@NBA_Math Could you explain TPA for me
@AndrewDBailey @tribjazz Agreed
@AndrewDBailey @tribjazz Kyrie in cavs?
@AndrewDBailey @tribjazz Insert any naturally good volume scorer you want in this case
@AndrewDBailey @tribjazz Why is ok for him but others get criticized. Even tho their teams need them to do the same thing
@DaveDuFourNBA Kind words. That’s saying he’s Hall of Fame bound
@all_metelite He can't shoot that's crystal clear. He's effective because he is capable of all those things and he's a giant PG. That helps him a lot!
@all_metelite You're sadly mistaken if you size and length matters. Ben Simmons is not the same guy if he was 6'2.
@all_metelite Rondo ain't 6'10 or finishing thru &amp; and above people at the rim
@HoopsReference Don't forget Kris Middleton
@HoopsMetrOX Uni*
@HoopsMetrOX Willing to bet he’s had more than 1 triple double in a Sac imo
@HoopsMetrOX If this type of production doesn’t contribute to winning I really don’t know what does https://t.co/w59amMj68O
@HoopsMetrOX He hasn’t won anything was my point. They were swept
@HoopsMetrOX How can AD be so high and he hasn’t won anything at all. Do you have separate W-L logics based on who the player is. This is inconsistent
@HoopsMetrOX So is Jokic better than Anthony Davis? Last question before I laugh myself to sleep
@HoopsMetrOX Emotions, W-L records cant be valid reasons for underating a guy. Emotional guys win and and Ws and Ls are on the organization as a whole
@HoopsMetrOX He had more help than Boogie ever has.. but that’s deflecting the point that boogie emotions ain’t got nothing to do with the kings winning
@HoopsMetrOX Bro emotions or not, Kings aren’t winning anything. That’s a weak excuse. Russ and Dray emotional AF and they win cuz they on good teams.
@HoopsMetrOX If Rudy,Jokic,Gasol,Joel miss the playoffs and they perform as expected or exceed expectations they aren’t any less of a player than last yr
@HoopsMetrOX Cool. But again, no chance any other C’s make the playoffs on that team. It’s unfair to penalize any 1 person for that. It’s a team game man
@HoopsMetrOX Which is why it’s unfair to judge boogie based on that bcuz anyone can be in that situation. Not his fault nor would it be anyone else’s
@HoopsMetrOX Teams are much better than a decade ago. But since u think it’s debatable with LBJ there’s no chance Rudy,Jokic,Gasol gets them there.
@HoopsMetrOX I don’t think so man. I think you punish guys for being on bad teams. Lebron James couldn’t take the kings to the playoffs.
@HoopsMetrOX Again tho, Jokic has a better team of course they’ll win more. Boogie production outweighs all of theirs. Marc will never avg even a dbl dbl
@HoopsMetrOX And yea not sure about the IT Boogie thing but it could be true
@HoopsMetrOX But they are your rankings we just asses the game differently
@HoopsMetrOX But what has Jokic won? Gobert made the playoffs once. Gasol is solid but doesn’t dominate. And all of their teams are better. Unfair IMO
@HoopsMetrOX Like don’t trade away IT. Don’t draft Mclemore, fredette, not giving up on Whiteside. We wouldn’t be having this convo
@HoopsMetrOX He could sure. Uplifting ain’t gon get sac into the playoffs tho. I think making good front office decisions is far more important to a team
@HoopsMetrOX I appreciate everyone for who they are. Be a star in your role and you have value. Don’t do well in your role then you should be replaced
@HoopsMetrOX Put him around quality guys and the wins will come. As it will and has with other guys who were/are stuck on bad teams
@HoopsMetrOX Because it’s a team sport. Everyone has to perform in order for a team to play well. Players Coaches Front Offices all are involved
@HoopsMetrOX And his teams are a deflection of the point that he is clearly better than the 5th best C.. Nobody dominates the way he does, that matters
@HoopsMetrOX Bad teams have bad splits thats a given. I'd imagine the consensus would agree his teams have not been good. They'd win if they were good
@HoopsMetrOX The fact that you mentioned the 4 mins he wasnt on the court last night as an indication of anything really makes me question your logic
@HoopsMetrOX Because they're not even a lock for the playoffs with him and AD. That's how i know this team, or any team he's been on have not been good
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @The94FeetReport His teammates arent that good. Never have been. that ain't on him. His value is in the sheer domiance he displays which only Joel can match
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @The94FeetReport Joking or no? This can't be what confirms your 5th best C assertion.
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @The94FeetReport Yo Patrick, just checking back to see if you still think there are any C's better than Boogie. Let alone 4 of them my God!
@HoopsReference Carmelo will by default score more points than Paul George this season regardless of what Option people classify them as
@ralxigh @DaneMooreNBA Smh he could be so much better
@TDEjoey @KellyScaletta If I recall correctly Kelly’s rankings sure had him atleast top 2
@TDEjoey @KellyScaletta Well aware of Jokics impact. I’m a fan, just disagree with this whole best big talk. He’s doing nothing to support that notion
@KellyScaletta Course it won’t. Neither will Melo’s once PG &amp; Russ start to make their shots
@KellyScaletta Fantastic. Is that why his PER is below 5. Best big indeed
@KellyScaletta Meanwhile Super Jokic is running away with the best big man award
@Mark_Wahlen So you saw his O was the only thing working 2nd half. Ball movement doesn’t guarantee others will make shots. They just gotta do better
@Mark_Wahlen Not probably. Nothing was working. They were down 20 and iso ball got them within single digits. Go watch
@Mark_Wahlen They literally had nothing else going for them
@Angelico_Chavez @SpiritAirlines Bout to take a knee in protest in front of TSA if I ever get there ✊🏾
@Angelico_Chavez @SpiritAirlines 😂😂 they trash dawg
@JoshEberley @NekiasNBA Why can’t it be that he’s not as good as stat twitter thinks he is and that be it
How is @SpiritAirlines the only Airline in MBJ Airport with ALL of their servers down. You guys have got to do better. Please fix this mess!
@AndrewDBailey @samesfandiari @DentonReports Identical to Jokic's PER thus far
@KellyScaletta Where exactly is he?
@JoshEberley anybody seen Jokic
@CarolinaSwoll @FredKatz he was more efficient than the other 2 dudes mentioned
@SteadyLosing You can't place Paul struggling today on Melo. They played like trash, Paul &amp; Russ struggling is on them
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump It’s “mettle” bro. I see why you had to plagiarize
@PaulHeadleyNBA Why do ppl question whether DH is Hall of Fame bound? Melo is pretty much a lock. That has to say something bout careers
@JoshEberley So why act like it's a foregone conclusion? Longevity matters in "careers". TMAC had more ALL NBA 1st teams, Melo career still better
@JoshEberley This is interesting being as tho Melo's a HOF lock and people are questioning whether or not DH even gets in
@FloodEmpire @JoshEberley He went to the Conf Finals in Denver.. Doing research before speaking usually works out well for people
@NerdNumbers @lovethoseknicks I can almost guarantee he doesn't create 20+ shots a game on his own.. However many it is it's more on the coaching than anything else
@AndrewDBailey His limitations really stood out tonight
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Nah it just reassures whats already evident. He can dunk and lay the ball up with high efficiency. Just like plenty other guys as I've said
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball That proves nada. DJ the highest rated O player in the league. He better than AD on O? Some stats have value and some are complete trash
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Decent is atleast 70% but you just described AD, Porzingis, Whiteside, S. Adams, Karl Towns, and KD just off the top of my head
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball When u initially said screen I'm thinking literally screen. U don't always set screens to roll to the rim so your arguments confusing
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Thats called being more of a lob threat than someone, not the screen per say. And I could argue other ppl have that same impact rim rollin
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Not sure what Rudy or anyone's shooting %'s have to do with setting a quality screen
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball You are losing me.. I thought we were talking bigs setting screens which create opportunities. Which Rudy and plenty others do well.
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball You can insert any big who either has long arms, jumps high, has a good decent player passing and good shooters it works the same way
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Easily. When Capela screens and starts rolling to the rim the flood gates open. Simply bcuz the D has to decide give up a lob or 3
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball I watch a ton.. I know he's great at it but i question the whole best in the league thing based on that stat thats all
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball And to your other point yes perimeter guys benefit from his screens but that can be said for a ton of guys in the league
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball That could very well be the case with plenty guys who set great screens
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Yea I can't buy that. What if those screen opportunities come but the guy doesn't make the shot. No assist is created so no credit is given
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Just clarify I initially stated with the ball in his hands, i left his passing out by mistake but yea im well aware of the intangibles
@tombguedes @TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Def a good passer. Not sure how u measure being the best screener in the league but he does that well too as well work for the xtra poss
@TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball Not arguing what he needs to do. He's very effective as is. I disagree with you thinking he's good at anything on O other than rim rolling
@TyroneisMaximus @HPbasketball He can roll to the rim and will attract a lot of attention doing so.. outside of that he does nothing well with the ball in his hands
@TyroneisMaximus @lonzoland @RiskyRoss22 @HPbasketball prime example of how some stats can REALLY confuse some people
@NerdNumbers The team who scores the most points win 100% of the time
@twblanchard You've had your troll moments lol but u cool too man
@twblanchard Those the same ppl that didn't give him all NBA accolades I ain't surprised lol. And he came mid season give me a break lol
@twblanchard It starts at the top
@twblanchard Never once has his front office drafted a player that's relevant today other than IT who they traded away
@twblanchard And when I say several atleast 15-20 games a season since he's been in the league
@twblanchard I've seen Rudy several times. I gamble on the NBA for a living I see everyone it's all I do. Just never watched a Utah sac game
@twblanchard Nah bro. It's never 1 guys fault why a team doesn't win. Too many players coaches front offices make up an entire team. With Utah he would
@twblanchard I can watch and nothing I just said will change. Nothing. All those things I named he's legit better at
@twblanchard Rudy is better at protecting the basket and catching lobs
@twblanchard Boogie is better than him at FT shooting, generating FTs, steal rates, 1:1 matchups leaguewide, passing, dribbling, 3's, I can go on
@twblanchard These are the stats u been bringing up all day. How is he not on his level then explain to me
@twblanchard  https://t.co/bI9Mw2tZEH
@twblanchard I agree he is better than DJ. We're moving on from that. But either your logic works for both DJ and Rudy or neither of them
@twblanchard Rudy can't be the goat and DJ not be right behind him based on "your" logic.
@twblanchard We talking the inconsistency of your logic. Rudy is&gt;DJ. But for the reasons u said Rudy&gt;everyone else the same logic can be said about DJ
@twblanchard If your arguments aren't consistent then you can't convince anyone what you're saying isnt just pure bias
@twblanchard How can 1 argument work for the guy you're a fan of and not a guy who's style of play, stats and accolades all mirror? Makes no sense man
@twblanchard DJ is the exact same dude Rudy is.. so why isn't DJ better than all those guys u names who shoot inefficient shots and didn't make all NBA
@twblanchard You not being consistent. U said Rudy the best bcuz of his O &amp; D ratings, he all NBA all he do is dunk and he don't take inefficient shots.
@twblanchard You think DJ is better than everyone except Rudy man your judgement is officially in question
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Gotta lay off the Rudy juice bro the side effects are starting to take over
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Is his middle initial a V or something
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Aww man. Yea I'm think I'm good bro. Rudy # 1 DJ # 2. Enough said
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Naw man. If they're on chances are there's a much better game on at the time
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Yikes. Then clearly Deandre Jordan is better as well. He must be 2nd best big in league in your opinion. All NBA, only dunk, rim protect
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Well if he gets outplayed that says a lot but I usually reserve comment on things I didn't see. I just know what I know
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports 😂😂 @ nobody dunks like Rudy. So you think if he added an actual touch, some playmaking skills, a tre ball perhaps he wouldn't be better?
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Rudy's an ALL WORLD rim protector. An elite rebounder and lob catcher.. Boogie simply can do more on a basketball court than he can. Sorry
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Clearly all u gotta do is do nothing else except get put backs and catch lobs at a high rate and u at the top of the league
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports So i really dont care about O ratings.. Deandre Jordan is rated #1 and that means absolutely nothing to me. He nor Rudy is that good
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports We can just throw that out. Plenty players are capable of making all nba. Make the playoffs, be likable, have good stats u have a shot
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports So just curious before I continue on. Is that your bar? Make an all NBA team over someone and you're better?
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Boogie has things to his game that has a ton of value that don't show up in the stats so he too has immeasurables as u cal it
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports His team made the playoffs. And they would have with boogie there. And sac would not have with him there. Real simple
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports All stats do not say he is better. He is better at some things but Boogie is better a lot more things than he is.
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports I say that to say you can't tell anyone that these set of metrics work in X's favor so X is better than Y. It just doesn't work that way
@twblanchard @il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Nobody with an NBA background relys solely on stats.. Stats help but you need to be able to watch games and articlate whats going on
@jeffmorgan7 @devendudharni @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports @ me when you're serious
@devendudharni @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports But that's not the only thing boogie is better than him at bro
@il_slinky @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports No they don't
@devendudharni @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Then what do you mean. I can think of a ton of examples of guys who lose and are better than others guys on winning teams.
@devendudharni @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports You just basically asked why try if you're not winning games
@devendudharni @remy_bennett1 @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Regardless winning games doesn't determine who is the better basketball player
@OFK_Aaron @portlandians1 @colincampbell Good shit bro
@jstar79 @colincampbell yep i got that part.. just didnt know his room had 20 windows
@trentjbrooks @colincampbell sheesh.. yea that place is huge
@drewkendaljones @colincampbell Understood now, thanks bro
@bankruptspurs @colincampbell Not at all, you should see the size of the rock I live under.
@colincampbell Hey Colin.. anyone know how or why they're are two broken windows?
@HoopsMetrOX @Brian_So_Jazzed @Lockedonsports Lol aww man. I have to actually watch someone play to judge. Although the Bill Russell O clips I've seen look awful lol but i respect the OG
@HoopsMetrOX @Brian_So_Jazzed @Lockedonsports I can't think of a great defensive guy ever being better than an elite offensive guy. Perhaps you do? Other than this case obviously
@HoopsMetrOX @Brian_So_Jazzed @Lockedonsports We can say that a lot of things on the court tho man
@Brian_So_Jazzed @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports There's been a TON of awesome guys who couldn't win because they were in bad situations tho. Unfair to fault/credit one guy for W's/L's.
@HoopsMetrOX @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @Lockedonsports @The94FeetReport checking this out now
@HoopsMetrOX @jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @Lockedonsports Yea Sac realized the overall product on the floor wasn't producing. May as click reset and trade one of the better players in the league
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Merely stating reasons why rim rolling can be easy. Never once said all apply to your boy. Although it certainly could as is for many guys
@jalerwill @jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Maybe its me but its never 1 players fault why mobs don't make the playoffs. I mean theres Front offices, coaches, teammates all are present
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports It's not that. Long arms, bounce, a good passer, shooters on the floor make it easy for guys with certain physical gifts
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Rolling to the rim absolutely. As is Capela, Tyson and DJ along with others
@jeffmorgan7 @SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports This tells me nothing. We all agree he's the best defensive big and can rim roll. What else is there? I must be missing something
@SirDalihan @HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports What offensive potential? He can rim roll on offense. That's it. Nobody gets "potential" boost. You're either good at something or not.
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Lol Idk man. Plenty guys run hard to the rim &amp; catch lobs easily. What determines the best. Highest jumper? Having good passes mean a lot
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports Alright so he's the best defensive big and he has value like many others rolling to the rim. Anything else I'm missing?
@HoopsMetrOX @Lockedonsports So you guys feel Gobert is better mainly because of his impact of the defensive end?
@KellyScaletta Looks a little winded after all these buckets
@tim_cato Full interview? Particarlly interested in the next question
@FredKatz Full interview up anywhere?!
@PaulHeadleyNBA Oh ok that makes sense
@PaulHeadleyNBA I get it's just a poll but nobody should make decisions based on numbers alone.
@AlexKennedyNBA Is the game coming on league pass?
@YoungNBA Do you know if it's available via league pass
@Patrick_Fenelon Exception: Carmelo
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein Melo is a good catch and shoot guy bro. He isn't just an ISO guy.. Playing with those guys will just make his looks easier and vice versa
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein He's not coming over expecting to be NY Melo. Like PG isn't gonna be Pacer PG. An injury to any of the key guys will be bad for them
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein He was really good.. I just don't think the Kanter/PP duo is better for OKC than PP/Melo
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein I'm pretty sure Melo will be that. PP can be too. But you cant give Russ/PG rest and rely on PP to score for you. Melo helps, ask Sam Presti
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein Late or early really.. More space for Russ to have driving lanes will never be a bad thing
@jordandan53 @JacobEGoldstein Indeed. Pat isn't the player Melo is tho. Pat will provide value for them and you can play him late at the 5 where as you couldn't with Enes
@JacobEGoldstein @jordandan53 agreed
@JacobEGoldstein @jordandan53 Gotcha. Might be enough shots for all 3 really. Not sure who else can score on the team? Melo gives Russ/PG more space to work with as well
@JacobEGoldstein @jordandan53 Just curious, you justy "like them" without Melo or you think they're a better team without him?
@chode12345 @daldridgetnt @NBAonTNT @russwest44 @wojespn That would be kinda lame of him bro... "I'd rather have an early vacation than compete in the Finals"... But hey maybe you're right
@chode12345 @daldridgetnt @NBAonTNT @russwest44 @wojespn Why would Bron leave guaranteed Final's/ECF appearances to lose to the Warriors even earlier
@NBA_Math Shane Battier or James Jones on one of those Heat mobs
@Tjonessltrib Not entirely sold but will be interesting to see. Preciate the thought
@Tjonessltrib So Bron plays point? If so, why not crowder over wade? Defends and spaces the floor better. Just wondering
@Tjonessltrib Him and drose starting (til IT gets back) would do nothing for Brons drive and kick game. JR much better fit
@bwp2727 @joelmama @NESNFuel @NESN Due it?
@NerdNumbers He'll be getting wide open looks like never before. His jumper isn't going anywhere regardless of age
@NerdNumbers So you're smarter than Sam Presti?
@BradBallisLife @Ballislife Melo can score from all over
@Patrick_Fenelon @DerekJamesNBA @NAPRegulators Well Robeson can't play late because he can't make even a free throw. Melo helps just being in the floor
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA For sure bro! I hope Melo don't let me down haha
@SnottieDrippen I think you're pretty reasonable bro this is why I'm asking. But am I tripping here? https://t.co/Rtx26XZkp5
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Time will show you. Til then peace bro ✌🏽
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA He's better than every option each of those teams has at that position at shooting. good is good enough
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Playing with hous, okc, por any of them ALL he needs to do is spot up being as tho he'll be gifted open looks every night
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA You and I can find several clips online of him doing just that in an NBA uniform. All you have to do is be able to shoot are kidding me
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Bro you're tripping. Olympics he does just that. I'm starting to question whether you actually believe what you're saying.
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA 2) like what is it about a guy who can clearly shoot that says he can't be valuable as a spot up shooter and floor spacer as 3/4th option
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA 1) Is that hard to understand what any player is capable of regardless of old situations in the past just knowing his talents?
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Minutes has literally zero to do with what type of players are on the court with u bro. Like zero. Your role changes, you have to know that
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA In NY. You're pretending like he can't get the same looks Olympic Melo does playing with guys who can create
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Their O is fine with dame and CJ with Nurk rolling to the rim. Melo doesn't need to ISO to have an impact. His talent spaces the floor
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA He's good at what they need him to do to improve as a team. That's make more shots than Moe Al and Evan. That has to account for something
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA If barely means an extra 3-5 wins that means a lot. Okc will likely see the same type of increase. Agreed nothing's easy tho
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA If the trade happens blazers get better. Utah, LAC and Memphis got worst. None of this tells me blazers aren't getting in
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA They never stop anyone as is and make the playoffs tho. Outscoring them in the reg season will be tough to do for the majority of the NBAo
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA No question they'll give up a ton. Just not entirely sure there are many teams that can stop them. Def wanna see who they give up tho
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Fringe being in the 7,8,9 range? They're there now. With Melo that's a scary lineup to guard. 4-5 WC teams can legit outscore them
@BradyKlopferNBA @YoungNBA Well if you're a Portland fan you wouldn't have to question whether your team would make the playoffs or not
@JoshEberley Both get better. He's demonstrated he can play with people better than him. Make the uncontested shots he'll be gifted is all he has to do
@CBSSportsNBA @MattMooreCBS Must have been 2 Andrew Boguts in Free Agency
@Chuck1one @Sixringofsteel @TommyBeer He hasn't played a game it still doesn't make sense
@Jaelin_Taylor @KellyScaletta DJ disrupts team chemistry because he can't be on the floor late in games due to his horrid FTs
@KellyScaletta He'd be 2nd on the team in scoring easily. He's just far too good of a scorer to be bad on a team with creators like Paul and Harden
@heylarry21 @NerdNumbers Peak McGrady&gt;Melo. But clearly Melo's career has been better. Injuries hurt MAC's. Melo hasn't had a season under 20per. And won more games
@NerdNumbers @heylarry21 Agreed
@NerdNumbers @heylarry21 Naw bro. Melo's NBA career is better than TMACs. He's getting in with or without Olympics and NCAA
@JoshEberley at their peak melo was a better shooter, better at staying on the floor and willing his teams to wins. McGrady has his advantages as well
@JoshEberley mcgrady ball handling &amp; playmaking.. melo better shooter. equal scorers &amp; rebounders.. melo durable, won more games and had better career
@AdamJosephSport He'll be guarded by teams 3rd best player in games. Too much Olympic evidence of him thriving to suggest he can't fit
@JoshEberley Ryan Anderson did this in the playoffs.. you can't pretend anything Melo looks like this https://t.co/xOiI5QFUDj
@AmericanNumbers That hard to imagine he'll accept his role as 3rd option? Where most of his shots will be catch n shoot where he's very good at
@KeithSmithNBA Preciate it
@OMaroneyNBA if harden and curry both got super max deals how is hardens worth more. Did curry take less?
@KeithSmithNBA did curry take less money? How is hardens deal that much more than his?
@MBohlin247 You wouldn't happen to know how harden received more of a max than curry given neither took less money
@JameelHassan_ Got work for u bro.. DM when u get a chance

@JustRight4B yea man them refs got a tuff job
@JustRight4B Precisely.. U know I've always been a supporter of the clever veteran moves.
Ok so I"m rooting for OKC but fouls get missed all the time.. OKC and the fans have to get over it
@NIX1331_ lol im surprised he hasn't announced his retirement
@NIX1331_ Yea dawg need to get his mind rite
@NIX1331_ Hahahaa! Man RIP BDiddy
@NIX1331_ U just said it. "HE" thinks he should let Bron ball dominate, thats his fault. Nothing is stopping him from doin him, cept him!
@NIX1331_ What does Bron do that makes it tuff for Dwade not be himself? Russ plays like he da best player n the league with KD out there
@FreshMenDuce @NIX1331_ It could be, but if he playing there are really no excuses. DWade not making any
@NIX1331_ Oh u kno ima say Melo gon cook with anybody on the court til proven otherwise lol
@NIX1331_ he has had plenty Dwade games with Bron tho, this year and last year. Bron not holdin him back, there are plenty shots to go round
@NIX1331_ i think its a team sport and everyone deserves blame, but DWade needs to play like DWade, its nobodies fault but his he not
@MrCoalitionIntL lls
@MrCoalitionIntL @SportscenterDre LOL @ HIV.. U wrong dawg!

@MrCoalitionIntL @NIX1331_ haha he do do that, but PL got more money than glassmanor does. Frog n nem was bout 2 b out of a job
This summer if we wanna play more than 4 games itll cost a lil more. If u got a 10 mob team 40 per person aint nothin
The MNCPP payed for most the league last year as part of the ongoing safe summer league joint
Fall joint it was all on the teams to try n save da rec frm being closed, this time around if we wanna play more than 4 games it'll cost us
The fall was all on the teams to keep the manor from being shut down
Last summer it was only a 100 because the MNCPP paid for the bulk of it as part of the safe summer league
@SonnyMHoffa what about the one's who do both
@Smilez711 @juscallmeace @Hys_thaQB Yall b safe out there

@NIX1331_ Agreed! I thank u for ur time
@juscallmeace @NIX1331_ I said its not what it used 2 be and thats the only place he has lost a step. "Step" does not suggest he "can't"
@NIX1331_ So Ace can stop rappin me up lol can you please shed sum light on kobe's cup game now compared to what it used to be.
@juscallmeace maybe not to you but his rack game aint what it used to be
@juscallmeace dont get me wrong he can finish but he just older and thats the only place where he has lost a step
@juscallmeace Kobe's more skilled but is strictly a perimeter player now. He's missing that elite ability to finish above/around the rim
@SonnyMHoffa Naw not today bruh.. Prolly late night 2moro
@juscallmeace Bron better than KD. And "right now" he better than Kobe. But not the Kobe we all grew up watching
@juscallmeace Greatness/Legacy how many rings u win.. The better bball player, i determine by who has the most strengths and weaknesses
RT @ImDrDuncan: In the minds of #6 fans...."if he gets one ring he's better than Kobe" Smdh
