@ananavarro Congratulations

@sheriw1965 @ABC It's late here, I read it 5 times. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who couldn't translate his gibberish. #grammer
@chelseahandler @LeahRemini Not once did he say ..... I do not recall. Refreshing!
@JerryHervey @TrumpsareNazis @gtconway3d I noticed that too. They seem scared so they went on the attack.
@RavMABAY Truth!
@thehill Here's what I saw @Jim_Jordan not ONE republican congressman tried to defend Trump. Michael Cohen lied and cheated, he's going to prison to pay for his crimes. He also was MAN enough to testify before the country and APOLOGIZE to the country for the wrongs he committed.
RT @joshuamahony: I don’t care your political party, or your faith in Cohen’s words. I’ve never heard someone say this before in testimony…
@DavidCornDC @MrJonCryer Not surprised or shocked.....just disgusted.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Y'all are just mad that he's not lying for Trump anymore. I found him incredibly humbled and he spoke with a desire to right his wrongs. Funny how not one GOP congressman defended Trump. Food for thought.

Where is the phone dump? Who talked/threatened him? #SmileyFaceKillers
@susan1215 I didn't like the police chiefs attitude, and didn't buy his tidal pool theory. The autopsy said he had mud and stones in his nasal passages which more than likely indicates dragging by the feet.
@EMauraA I agree, I wonder how hard it is for the family to request or perhaps pay for an independent autopsy.
I feel so badly for these families. Heartbreaking #SmileyFaceKillers
