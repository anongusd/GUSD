Up to 45,000 Wisconsin voters were blocked from voting in 2016 because of the state's voter ID law. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes. https://t.co/gwQmsYUvFx #NoVoterIDLaws
A federal judge has found Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in contempt of court for failing to uphold the voting rights of residents who were blocked from registering to vote in the 2016 presidential election. https://t.co/w2wPPSafXk
Congrats to NJ on passing #AutomaticVoterRegistration. “We stand in stark contrast to President Trump and others, whose only interest lays in restricting voting rights and suppressing voters’ voices,” @GovMurphy said. “New Jersey will not go backwards.” https://t.co/JqwLkphTU3
States are finally making voter registration more accessible to get young people to the polls. Following in OR's footsteps, CA is now the 2nd state to implement #AutomaticVoterRegistration, automatically preregistering eligible 16 year olds to vote. https://t.co/8lBym4ok6A #AVR
“What compelling government interest is served by felon disenfranchisement? Enhanced public safety? How? Is it to fine-tune the quality of the electorate? This is not a legitimate government objective for elected officials to pursue." https://t.co/WqOMo21OYV
While the White House continues to spew their voter fraud lies, states are making real progress and expanding access to the ballot box. https://t.co/N1gRtpXRXt via @briantashman &amp; @aclu #AVR #AutomaticVoterRegistration
"The passage of automatic voter registration in Washington is especially worthy of celebration. AVR dramatically simplifies the registration process, signing up citizens to vote when they interact with a state agency, unless they opt out." https://t.co/fAGkr5TxpH #AVR
Info from the 1940 Census was secretly used in the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. The abuse of data from that census has fueled fears about a #CitizenshipQuestion on the 2020 census. https://t.co/QRyUGJeBAZ
After years of @GOP attempts to restrict access to the ballot, Dems are now pushing more assertively to protect voting rights. According to the @BrennanCenter, 514 bills to expand voting access have been introduced this year in 41 states. https://t.co/hECYTiUw08
While the @NRA lies, experts have found that #AutomaticVoterRegistration actually drastically increases voter turnout and makes elections more secure. Join us at https://t.co/Fnl0Mt2LRY to keep pushing more states to adopt #AVR laws.	 https://t.co/nu5QsfDDmt #FightFearWithFacts
Questioning the citizenship of every person on the Census is unconstitutional because it would undermine the govt's constitutional responsibility to count every person living in the U.S. every 10 years. We will continue to fight Trump on this effort. https://t.co/NfK5qI531b
Congratulations to Maryland on becoming the latest state to pass #AutomaticVoterRegistration! AVR is secure, it is accurate, it saves money, and the technology needed for it is already in place. https://t.co/4aN7A9ax81
The @GOP Congress has failed in limiting dark money - so now states are taking up the fight for clean elections. If 2017 is any indication of what’s to come, 2018 promises to be a tougher year for deceptive political advertising. We must stay vigilant. https://t.co/ymUGpPaPP2
A new @BrennanCenter report predicts that a Democratic takeover of the House is going to be very tough, with @GOP gerrymandering to blame. Let’s re-double our efforts - join our fight against #gerrymandering here: https://t.co/emJyDp2qZv https://t.co/4YNJcMeRsy #RedToBlue
