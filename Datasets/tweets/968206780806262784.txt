@redhead_ana @davidhogg111 What‚Äôs tough is that Obama‚Äôs campaign information stays with his campaign and cannot transfer it to the DNC while the republicans have been gathering data since the 2012 election as a party.

@redhead_ana @davidhogg111 Yes. Voting patterns show that districts flip during midterms of presidencies. When obama was in office they went red. Trump is in office now so they turn blue. It‚Äôs cyclical and happens all the time. In no way have millennial voting percentages risen nor registration
