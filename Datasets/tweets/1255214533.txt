This poll is the first poll without Rob Wittman, and @EdWGillespie was not able to gain much, if anything @CoreyStewartVA gained.
62% of the people who don't know @CoreyStewartVA. As they are educated on Stewart &amp; his positions, they will break his way, as poll suggests
@CoreyStewartVA was at 4% in the last poll in December - he is now up 9%! @EdWGillespie was at 24% in December - he is  only +1%.
@CoreyStewartVA is a strong #2 now, with zero dollars spent on TV. He is at a nice 13% - way higher than any one other than @EdWGillespie
@EdWGillespie ran for senate with tens of millions of dollars spent - did not seal the deal last time. This poll shows a similar trajectory.
@EdWGillespie has an almost 73% name ID, yet only 25% of the people who know him support him. Unfavorables are 13% - largest in the field.
