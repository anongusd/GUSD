@michellemalkin @miss9afi @Imamofpeace M: Please be sure to notice us the outcome.   I'm beyond shocked to read this.  No  country outside the US as any right over Americans,  we answer to No One.
@BernieSanders Fortunately for Americans,  you nor any other democratic socialist can dictate what will and will not be.  You won't control corporations,  not you not AOC.  Too bad Bernie.
I love this! https://t.co/iWoo06GAft
The real Democratic agenda.  Cuomo may end up on AOC's list!! https://t.co/NBt7AIBS2k via @dailycaller
Cohen wanted pity but looked foolish, blamed Trump &amp; wanted hatred projected towards him, also failed.  After prison, Cohen will be avoided like the plaque. https://t.co/hjABkBpFUs via @dailycaller
@RoKhanna You have nothing but heresy, only words from a convicted felon.  Trump is too smart to let a  bunch of losers take him down.
@Ilhan He will never be Impeached,  especially not by You or any other Democrat.
@RepCummings a truly inspirational speech you gave to Michael Cohen.  Heart felt and humble, without judgement or vicious attacks.  You stated you hope he learns from his mistakes, that is all we as humans can do,  learn and not repeat our mistakes.
The Democrats used Cohen to suck out every ounce of personal financial information as far back as possible. Cohen was kicked and bitch slapped by politicians. He is so naive. He thinks now he is important, he is a bigger loser than before his testimony.
Just how low will your enemy go to destroy every aspect of your life?  Watch the Cohen hearings.
M. Cohen may spend only a year or less in prison,  we don't know.  He has alienated important people that could have helped him get back on his feet if he would have only shut up about Trump.
AOC just had to get in her dig of Trump's golf course acourse and his money.  Total irrelevant to this case.  Such Wealth Envy and misunderstanding of basic financial economics 101. https://t.co/3fdVfrLYvE
@ACTBrigitte Let's open our minds, I won't discriminate against persons and their belief systems. The problem is their hated of America and what we stand for.  Instead of celebrating their successes, they proliferate hatred, progressing towards vicious attacks and murder of the innocent.
@AOC Shadily is not a word in the English language.   You can't make up words like you make up your pretend and make believe reality.
@LivPsy Can you tell me where they were last lost?
@dbongino Good luck with that,  it will never happen.   After listening to  Cohen apologize on and on, I will never apologize again,  or show mumbling weakness.  It's really pitiful.
@AOCpress AOC, your calling yourself illiterate?
@kwilli1046 Throw him my filet mignon left overs and run.
@DiogenesDeems @desiderioDC And really,  who cares?  What does it matter now.  It's over.  He was Trump's personal attorney,  I'm sure he was good at his job.
@DiogenesDeems @desiderioDC Re-read my tweet, I said was.  He made mistakes but so did numerous others with the Mueller investigation.  Very smart, capable people.
@ScottPresler @angelics44 I'm going to jail to meet new friends. But I dont want these new friends,  somebody please wake me up from this nightmare.
@gtconway3d @TR_UK_GIRL So what, the check means nothing. Could be payment for 100s of items.
@ASavageNation No it doesn't.  Cohen wants to take Trump to jail with him.   Cohen should have kept his mouth shut.
@DiogenesDeems @desiderioDC He was the best and probably still is a good attorney,  but disbarred.  Cohen talked and got himself in trouble,  no one else.  Trump said nothing to investigators and he's not going to jail.
@officialmcafee I need a President with 100%  brain capacity, fully functioning, no threat of getting lost in thought.
@officialmcafee Isn't that what Satan promises?
@officialmcafee Your wife is holding her breath and praying you keep the boat in the water.
@officialmcafee Because he doesn't have any interest in Crypto.
@officialmcafee I recommend researching their credentials.  Could be a dishwasher.
@officialmcafee @theemrsmcafee Scary!!!
@officialmcafee John:  Do you prefer drugs that make you mellow or make you hyper?
@officialmcafee The German shepherd is beautiful,  beautiful.   Best dogs in the world.
@officialmcafee John:  Stick to good wholesome illegal drugs. People on bathsalts have been known to eat human flesh, viciously tearing it off with their teeth.
@officialmcafee Who is he to even ask?  He doesn't own or control Twitter, like AOC!!!😫🙃🤪
@Ilhan Newsflash:  You will Never, ever make any laws for the land of America.  Maybe for your country, not ours.
@MichaelCohen212 Michael:  Your an attorney, or you were.  What compelled you to speak?  You should know better.  All persons who spoke to Muellers team  are indicted.  Trump did not.  Law 101, never talk to police, investigators,  etc......
@ChuyForCongress please go back to Mexico, you are a disgrace to this country.  President Trump is in no way racist.  Watched your pathetic House speech to protest building the wall.  America doesn't want or need people like you.
@IntThings If you have no dedication,  your an insult to yourself and quite sure only your parents believe in you, Maybe!
@JDiamond1 Cohen will tell his mommy that Trump was mean to him and now he has to go to jail.		To friggin bad.  It's over, Mueller has nothing on Trump.
@AdamSerwer It all Heresay,  Prove it!
@cmclymer No body is talking about TRANSGENDERS, AND NO BODY IS INTERESTED IN YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS.
@desiderioDC "Cohen says"?   Nothing but misdirected heresy.  He a desperate has been, no longer an attorney who will be making new friends in prison.  Go visit him.
@davidgura Who cares?   No one cares about his loyalty,  he's not your boyfriend?  He's President and doing a great job for our country.
@WajahatAli What do you know for sure? Absolutely nothing.  You know only what the rest of us know and that, Cohen's going to jail and our Presidents Not!
@TimOBrien Like Hillary says, "What does it matter"?  It doesn't.   Trump's not going to jail.
@Yascha_Mounk Repent?  Get real!  Trump supporters love our President, he's not the man going to jail.  Cohen is desperate and he can say whatever he wants,  We will Never Turn our backs on him ; CHUMP!
@Abujafactor @Effgroundforces @SAPoliceService I'm not married and I would say "Have a safe trip".  That's what we do in America.  And, if I were married,  he would have to make an tremendous amount of money to move to 3rd world country.   Pretty sure they don't pay well.
@GeorgeW66827112 @AOC There is no fast food worker worth $15 hr.  The job takes absolutely no skills or knowledge whatsoever and anyone with a brain can do the job.  A person quits, another is hired in half an hour.
@GeorgeW66827112 @AOC CEO of Walt Disney earns $34 million dollars per year.  He makes the company  over 3 billion dollars per year.  Is he worth, in the marketplace $34 million?  Answer:  Of course.
@Abujafactor @Effgroundforces @SAPoliceService I'm fearless, not stupid.
@ECHOtheCALL @godisgood1961 Like OK, so like red lipstick,  like yeah, I wear it.  On my nose like sometimes because I can't see my lips like, I like am clueless. Like?
@Abujafactor @Effgroundforces @SAPoliceService I'm guessing it's the mans job and his boss whose slapping him.  He can quit and walk away.
@kwilli1046 I really want one of those.
@Abujafactor @Effgroundforces @SAPoliceService You will never see me in Nigeria!  Or any other 3rd world country.
@Effgroundforces @Abujafactor @SAPoliceService There is no person on the face of this earth who would slap me and not feel the repercussions.
To D. Jesus Chuy Garcia-Ill, Mexican born representative,  I say, you have no right insulting our president and I hope you continue to personally experience the joy of illegal aliens entering and living in Illinois, which "helps the human beings who are not a National Emergency"!
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 Funny thing about Heresay,  it's just that; your word against another's.
@AOCpress Does that mean your boyfriend will have to pay your tax?  What next AOC, tax babies with high IQ's?
@AOC Jobs that employ undereducated people with high turnover; the employee does Not add value to the market place and should not be paid the same as a college graduate who spent years working and going to school.  I know, I was one of them AOC.

@kilmeade @RepKinzinger Thank you for your brutally, factual honesty.
@AMike4761 Jenna has children and loves them and feels blessed,  privileged to have them.
Watching arguments &amp; final votes. House of representatives,  terminating border emergency declaration. The Democrats are in extreme denial.  They need to experience the adversity brought on by the entrance of illegal aliens in US.  Let them feel the pain of their denial.
What's the reason Hillary Clinton is on a mission to blame everyone who listens for her Failure of winning the Presidency?  Because she has never failed at securing a significant positional event.  Thus, she refuses to accept it and she really hates it.
@BernieSanders Americans WILL NEVER pay for people's financial mistakes. It's ludicrous to ask us.  We are not responsible and we refuse to pay.  We already have to subsidize welfare benefits and illegal aliens fees and costs.  Fight back America.
@BernieSanders Americans in no way will bail out students who decided to choose expensive Universities versus less costly.  It's comparable to asking us to bail out people in credit card debt.   No, no way,  no way in H2H.

@Solmemes1 People that support AOC and the liberal agenda,  without admitting they are political are ones doing the unfollowing.
@Talkmaster Transgenderism was listed in the DSM ( Diagnostic Statistics Manual) for mental health professionals as a disorder as was homosexuality.  Both have been reclassified.
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC Let me add:  Chile has meat in it!  Hypocrite.
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC Newsflash:  Billionaires don't cook for themselves,  nor do they clean, drive, or pay bills.  They pay people to do the stuff they don't like to do.

@AMike4761 Is that because it is now considered a hate crime to speak out against Muslims and Islam?  No one wants to go to jail.  People are now scared and frozen with fear.

@SenSanders FMLA has been in affect for almost 20 years.  12 weeks of leave are federal available, for paid or unpaid leave.  If you have time available,  you use it to be paid.  Ivanka Trump is currently working to help approve paid leave for FMLA.

President Trump Maga Rally in Texas:  AMERICA FIRST!
Watching CA, Arizona and Texas citizens vote for open borders stirs feelings of "Fine, let them have as many illegal aliens as possible".  Liberals everywhere want free socialist benefits and illegal aliens to share them with.  Are we doomed?

@Redtowel4 Cars are expensive! The attitude of the younger generation right now;  I don't care, it's not my problem,  my parents, (family, government) will pay for it. I have nothing in life, no job,  no school, I want Socialism.  This is hard working people's biggest challenge.

@factsionary Totally disagree with that logic.  People change and grow daily.  What made one happy yesterday can be old news today.  Divorce is a perfect example.  People get married; they are happy and in love. Ten years later,  this no longer applies. Think Jeff Bezos.

@AOC Now your sounding like a Conspiracy theorist AOC.  The man is out to get you.  You have an excellent salary,  now Netflix opportunities which you will receive monies.  Looks like your on your way to the American dream.
@TonyAtamanuik @AOC You whining cry baby victim.  People growing up in extreme poverty,  illiterate have gone on to do great things. Go to school, read, invest in yourself to get ahead.  Millions of people do and don't demand the Government give them more money.
@Talkmaster Hate Condos, hate Florida,  but you're OK Neal!
@PsychologyDoc Meningitis?

@boxersforlife @smalltownandrew I cant locate this detailed information.   Where is it anyone????? Please!  Thank you.
@HillaryClinton HILLARY:  Where are you getting your statistics?  We have the most advanced medical care for mother and new born than any other country in the world.  The only threat to newborns is Democrats trying to abort them during/before/after birth.
@AOC AOC:  If you care, help the homeless,  Stop late term abortion from moving forward,  work with the Trump administration to ensure a safe, legal immigration system so we the taxpayers don't go bankrupt supporting illegals.

@gatewaypundit @humastacklebox @BarackObama You're not lying if in your mind you really believe what you're saying.  You are considered confused, and disassociated with reality.
@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump Nancy:  You are out of touch with Americans.  Trump spoke the truth and you continually denying the facts does not make you correct.  You're living in a world only in your head called Nancy's make believe house.  Americans love President Trump:  Accept it!
@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump Nancy:  I think you forgot your glasses and hearing aids.
@Sniper64286433 She said her dad lost his coat while hitchhiking in the rain.  And President Trump caused all problems in the world and she won the Governor race in GA and Trump took it away.
@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams Nancy:  You and the Democrats cause conflict and non unity with all Americans.  You choose to rebel against President Trump's welcoming invitation to work together just so YOU can attempt to control the masses.

@In_communicado_ @JackPosobiec He lied to Mueller!  He witness tampered. That's why he's arrested.  I urge you to read for yourself the 24 page indictment document. It's on here.
@In_communicado_ @JackPosobiec Thanks!
@JackPosobiec I read it.  He is guilty.  He lied and underestimated FBI's Mueller(s) team.  He was heavily involved with trying to get stolen HC email information out to public. It was illegal and now he will go to prison. Was it worth it?  NO!
@TimRunsHisMouth Notice the Indictment wasn't yet signed by Mueller, so a person in his organization is responsible for the leak.
@JackPosobiec It's unusual this indictment document was made public and not sealed by the court. Once public, a federal warrant was issued for Stones arrest.  CNN could have been tipped off during any part of the process.
@TomFitton The stolen emails release did nothing to harm Clinton. The people involved are now all facing time in prison. FBI Comey did more harm to Clinton. After reading, Mueller has due cause to investigate.
After reading entire 24 page Stone indictment,  Stone is guilty. He made mistakes talking to Mueller,  answering questions, and Underestimating Mueller. Finally.  involvement in illegal activity revolving from stolen Clinton emails.  A must read.
@politicalHEDGE We don't know that yet.  Organization 1, person 1 and 2 are not identifiable.

@TheTrumpLady Allows!  I'm stunned she uses these words.  She is describing slavery. How could people vote her into office?
@RealSaavedra She truly doesn't belong in the United States. It's hypocritical of her to blast ambition when she ran for Congress, which is a big step up from her last job.

@dbongino @1AOrtiz Can you imagine an average citizen trying to beat allegations or false charges from FBI?  They would lose. President of US, most powerful man in the world has been fighting them for almost 2 years, working to clear his name of falsehoods.
@JohnCooper0610 @EddieDonovan President Clinton created requirements for welfare recipients mandating work requirements,  limiting time allowed to receive entitlements.  Obviously,  this no longer applies.
@glitzandglamma @AMike4761 What's the reason people aren't boycotting this statue?  New Yorkers hate Trump, and condemn him yet an Islamic country puts up a statue praising their God in an American city and American citizens take no action!  Unacceptable!
@AMike4761 New Yorkers have become complete atheists who no longer believe in America,  or our Christian God.  Their belief is in nothing but liberalism and a motto of: to each his own, not our problem, we stand for nothing!
@FiveRights People should really think about quitting Facebook.  Try not using for a week, then 2 and so forth.  Wean yourself off.  A major accomplishment!
Teachers in LA, CA prepare to strike on Monday.  They request more money, smaller classrooms, etc.  Meanwhile,  new CA Governor prepares to budget hundreds of millions of dollars for illegal aliens housing and Medicare until age 26.  Great place to live!
Example of highly esteemed icoming  Congress. We have clueless, disrespectful new members bringing  nothing productive to our nation. https://t.co/IMsdZSkjzv via @dailycaller
Any explanation as to why some leaders wish to completely destroy their countries?  https://t.co/dhSwjLOrRz
Pelosi so out of touch with real world happenings.  Wants to fix roads to facilitate immigration. https://t.co/IwO0MvKQs5
CA new Governor,  Newsom proposed $144 billion for education,  health care for illegals.  Nothing about helping the homeless or victims of fire damage, etc.  Great job liberals.
@SpeakerPelosi Talk about the Devastating effects of unwanted illegal aliens continuing to bombard the US, costing tax payers millions of dollars each year.
@SpeakerPelosi We want a border wall Nancy.  Until you say yes, Trump will tell you No!  He will win!
@SenSanders Why are there so many homeless people/vets/families living on the streets.  Why do car prices and housing costs continue to go up our pay checks seems to stay stagnet?
Love It! https://t.co/Ida2IWVhVY via @MailOnline

@gatewaypundit The one sure way to sway more democratic leaders approval for wall funding is for them to experience first hand, profoundly adverse and unpleasant effects of illegal immigration. Sad but true.
Take from the rich to pay for the illegal. https://t.co/CXQKIcADrq
And Deblasio followed followed suit immediately after Newsom. Now, CA and NY give free medical to illegal aliens.  https://t.co/aXEy5tLEGE #FoxNews

@bennyjohnson @imagineworldone She's already a politician!  While Cooper is talking one point, she changes direction completely and puts focus on Trump lying.  That is not a learned skill, it's a maneuver innate to con artist.
@RodStryker I am shocked!  I can't believe the movement has spread so quickly.  And no Mayor or Governor will step up and ask them to go into a mosque.  All New Yorkers are being forced to watch and listen to Islam.  Congratulations liberals.
@Backler21 Yes they are.  Operative word(s) state the truth in a phrase.  She would be welcomed in Muslim only countries, specifically Iran.  Iran threatens Isreal in front of the world.   How many other countries actually make global warnings in front of media?
@IsraelUSAforevr @RodStryker Ms. Sarsour is filled with and expresses an extreme hatred for one class of people; Jewish people. She is toxic to all our countries and should be refused a platform to spread her disease. What have innocent Jewish people done to hurt her, and continually pay this price?
@PatVPeters Americans have always welcomed immigrants.  Like to think of ourselves as open minded, not prejudiced.  Hopefully, new muslim congress women will work only for their country and put it first.  We must be a priority,  if not, we will push for their quick exit.
@ConservaCrenson @The_Trump_Train I'm sure you did.

@Farberyanki @TheTestyTarheel And America loves Israel!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy:  You are a hypocrite!  You state it's immoral for the US border with Mexico,  then you you claim to want to Protect our borders.  What you want is complete control over our country, that Will NEVER HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE TIME!

@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer: You have, on numerous occasions,  stated you want the Border Wall.  Stop making this about your hatred for President Trump.  You know the BW is needed.  Give Trump the money, help the American people,  and your family protect themselves.
@SenSanders Bernie: You said climate change is largest crisis? Billionaires are a rare breed and have Nothing to do with our Political Process. Politics have involved corruptions since they're inception.  Look at 2018 midterms,  Democrats cheated to a win in numerous states!
@RodStryker @moosemuffinn NP is so out of touch with the real world.  Let's hope she and her constituents get to experience first hand the joy of law abiding illegal aliens in sanctuary cities.
@bluelivesmtr @facebook @TomiLahren Really think about quitting Facebook. It is so outdated and blase'. FB continues to segregate and block conservative news.  Is it so important can't live without?
@ZNEWSNET Angelina Jolie as President:  Open borders to all persons all over the world.  Free housing, food, health care to all peoples unable to help themselves.  Tremendous outpouring of monies to third world countries and those in conflict, war.  She is anti gun.  What else?
@StevCia Shut the fuck up
@StevCia My source is OAN.  Your article is close to 8.
@christina300949 @AmyMek @emtee2355 I was replying to the video.  The officers are carrying guns.
@mommags2579 @The_Trump_Train Newsflash:  Trump wasn't President 5 years ago, guess who was President?  Are you a Democrat or relative of Ms. Cortez?
@christina300949 @AmyMek @emtee2355 Can they use them?  I've never seen an officer carry or use them.  This is why migrants attack. Is it specialty officers?
How often do we hear media coverage of an illegal alien attacking an important democratic representative? Never!  Are they so protected from vicious criminals? They drive the roads, shop in local stores? If they experience repercussions of illegals, will they want a border wall?
For younger generations of people who haven't studied history, birth control use to be illegal, see Griswold vs. Connecticut. Woman have fought for and won many basic human rights. Let's stay on track and strive for human decency and betterment of all human beings.
@charliekirk11 @Olerose Easy answer,  because President Trump wants it.  No other reason.
@ElianaBenador @deplorablemix @AppSame No excuse for this monstrosity,  however,  life reality, young beautiful women need to stay away from mainly Muslims countries.  Rethink your vacation plans, your life depends on it.
@CB618444 @Sniper64286433 This has become a World Wide Phenomenon; political/legal representatives allowing criminals to go free, citing innocence while legal, law abiding citizens are blamed and denied rights under our laws. EU and UK citizens are fined, jailed for speaking out. US is not there yet!
@The_Trump_Train Chuck Schumer, years ago, requested over 6 billion dollars for a border wall.  He was prepared to challenge those who believed we didn't need a wall.
@FrontierAviator @JimmyCoyoteLoco My vote for Melania is not only because she has the difficult job of being first lady, but because she endured, overcame several scandals with Trump's indescretions.  She forgave and moved forward.
@AmyMek @emtee2355 It's probably best the officers don't carry guns, the refugees would just take them and use them on the police.
@MichaelDelauzon There's not a ma am bone in his/her body.  Should have called the police.
8 million illegal immigrants tried to buy guns this year, they were all denied.
@JMReflectionsof @avibebert @FLOTUS Melania could wear a plastic bag and still look bett than Mrs. M.O.
@Frankmacc @TheaDickinson @koalameetseagle Free will, freedom of choice. People make wrong decisions and bad choices. Then they expect others to help them,  which we do.

@Frankmacc @TheaDickinson @koalameetseagle Distribution of what?
@IDF I love it!
@Rise1Soar2BFree @EricKlemstein Where is this place?
@IDF I love you.  IDF: You are so on target with a take no prisoners action mentality.
@ActivePatriots Nancy Pelosi needs to read this article.   Banning the ability to acquire guns will not stop an illegal gun import into our country.
@TheaDickinson @koalameetseagle We have the exact same problems in America.  The homeless population is steadily increasing while we import illegal aliens from numerous countries.  We give non citizens food, housing, schooling and free medical.

@SenSanders Bernie did you forget Bill Clinton shut down the government?  Twice!
@NancyPelosi Nancy:  Remember when Bill Clinton shut down the Government?  He wanted monies to help Americans pay for Medicare and health?  Trump is assuring Americans stay safe.
@MeghanMcCain Ms. M.  Bill is not an emotional wreck, but a "to the point " factual realist.  So get over it. We need non emotional men.  Women can be to over emotional and it's boring and pathetic at times.

@thehill Let's all keep in mind,  Mattis is not the President.   Trump has his reasons for withdrawal, so right or wrong, Mattis must accept his decision.  Mattis stayed with Obama and other presidents until he was fired, so his decision to leave is personal.
@AnnCoulter Ann:  You continually flip flop when voicing your opinion with regards to Trump's actions/inactions. You can't hate and attack then like and encourage.
@greggpeg7 @ActivePatriots Watch American shows; Police Women of Dallas, Memphis,  etc., women are trained to kick butt, all butt.  Those women videoed haven't been trained to take on men bigger than themselves.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You have lost your thinking abilities Nancy.  Americans Want the wall.  You are so wrong.  You want illegals in this country.  Trump must protect us with a border wall.  How dare you say immoral and ineffective.  Wake up liberals,  here's proof.  Nancy Pelosi hates you.
@ActivePatriots Where are their guns? It's insanely stupid for police offers not to have weapons; guns, especially women.  Criminals know this and males can take out a woman easily.
@CarnesDaniel @Woke2008 Michael Savage thinks the monies will have to be given back to those giving.
@ASavageNation The prisons are so over crowded with illegals and violent criminals, Trump had to agree to release non violent criminals.  Meaning, non murders, etc.
@AMike4761 I think Trump was attacked by millions wanting the wall and not satisfied with his caving to Pelosi.  He must do whatever it takes to build the wall.
@NancyPelosi Nancy:  The definition of cruelty is allowing and fighting for illegal aliens freedoms in our country and ignoring the massive number of homeless people,  especially in San Francisco.  That's CRUELTY!
@TXwarriorGiGi @moosemuffinn I predict Nancy Pelosi and Democrats will refuse to allow any private monies raised for wall be used for the wall.  She will find a way.

@SenWarren Yes it's sad an innocent child died because her illegal alien parents chose to drag her 1000s of miles cross country. What about our people/children/families who are killed by illegals, never a sad comment from you EW regarding their deaths. Nor from HC or any other liberal.

@gr8tjude_08 If Nancy is successful and Democrats remove the law for border security, allowing thousands of illegal aliens into our country every day.  Where will they go, how will they get there?  Who will feed, clothe, educate these thousands entering? She doesn't think it through, Ever!

@BetteMidler You are a true Nut Job Bette. Very sad, once a decent singer and actress. No one cares what old has been celebrities say anymore. They are the past, Trump is the future.

@jihadwatchRS Really:  Merkel just signed the UN Migration Act.  I'm somewhat skeptical about that.
@Independent Let me add, are your feelings hurt, are you offended?  Does anyone really think these cut throat leaders care about any persons, countries feelings or being offensive?  They Don't!  They won't be intimidated or controlled.  Do you think they allow millions of immigrants in?
@Independent What exactly is the internet furious about? These leaders refuse to sign UN Migration act, Paris Climate agreement,  nor cave to UN requests, Macron's demands, etc.  They are tough leaders, at very least, must respect that.  They won't be pushed around. Not admired,  respected
@QAnonPatriot @jodaka97 @FLOTUS @POTUS Wow!  I've never seen Trump cry.  Maybe a little joy and a little stress!
@Independent Not me!  Pay attention.
@piersmorgan Reality:  They understand politics and how the world operates,  that's why they laugh; they laugh At the ignorance of Macron's wining like a woman. World leaders should watch and learn how power really operates because it's playing out right in front of them!
@SkyNews Clearly few understand the Saudi Crown Prince. He is a strong leader and won't be pushed around by any world leaders. Know your allies enemies well!
@BreitbartLondon @PurpleHaze1717 To summarize:  We want your money, Obama gave us your money! We resent the fact you are smart Trump and can't be pushed around like all past US Presidents. Trying to manipulate,  control and induce feelings of guilt just won't faze President Trump!
The most puzzling part of the Mueller investigation for me, What's the reason those investigated keep talking. Shouldn't they have all kept their mouths closed, said nothing? Fear is driving them to spill! What you say can and will be held against you in a court of law!

@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews You won't win this argument,  I've been there, I've experienced it, I have thousands of excuses I could use to be a victim, poor, etc. I chose to go to school, work 3 jobs, never sleep,  eat Taco Bell because I wanted success, not poverty.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews Minimum wage was created as a starting point in life. That's why high school students work at fast food, college students,  people with no education and no skills.  I worked in fast food, shortly. Life is a ladder, you start at the bottom and work your way up. I had no parents.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews There are millions of people with medical problems and I sympathize with you.  Thinking of yourself as a medically Ill victim won't help you.  People survive cancer and numerous diseases everyday.  Good luck to you.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews Your life has been a choice, Your choice.  Stop blaming the world,  Government for your poverty and minimum wage you received.  If you have functioning mind, you can still work at home.  You choose poverty.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews I disagree with you totally.  I dropped out of school at 15 to work. Lived on my own, no parents, in pathetic places with pathetic people, worked 3 jobs to put self thru college, got my PhD. I can speak from experience. And there are many who have done the same.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews You receive Disability benefits,  not SS retirement.  There's a difference.  51 is very young and if you live 30 plus more years, you will barely survive,  life is expensive.  You will have a sub standard life.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews The Government taxes all incomes received regardless of its origin.   Not fair, I agree.  But we must all prepare. Complaining won't change the fact.  SS only supplements retirement,  it's not intended to be the only source of retirement $$$.  Only the poor, never saved live it.
@Brianbpugh @Ocasio2018 @JeriLRyan @FoxNews You didn't answer the questions.  I know numerous people getting social security and they get a % of their working life income.  My guess is you only receive SS and no other incomes.  You didn't save for retirement, you are young and took SS at a young age. SS supplements.

@Ocasio2018 @FoxNews As one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  There's few excuses for a young, healthy person not to make money, go to school, do whatever it takes to get ahead. Millions have done it.  Only lazy people who want free dont do it.  YOU ARE WRONG MS. OCASIO! ( always exceptions)

@AltLoading @BernieSanders Life is sacrifice and delayed gratification.  You give up something for something else.  It is possible.  Start by learning all you can about money and wealth. Rich people study wealth. They know tax laws, how to make them work. Anything is possible,  you just have to want it.
@ESSManMurphy @NancyPelosi The Fire is lies. Let's start, tax returns? What about them? Emoluments? His salary, he donates it. Money laundering? Prove it. Conspiracy? What does that mean? General Shenanigans? What the hell does that mean?
@ESSManMurphy @NancyPelosi You sound like a Democrat. Innocent until proven guilty.  That's the law and applies to all Americans.
@AltLoading @BernieSanders Where do you?  I can buy property,  have numerous times.   You have to find a reasonable place to live.  My advice, create wealth.  Always keep learning.  If I had no education,  I wouldn't have a great job with decent salary.  I paid my way through school.  No money help.
@ESSManMurphy @NancyPelosi If I knew, no problem stating I do.  Too many unproven, perceived generalities.  Just blant innuendos.  Trump haters all scream outrages which grow louder and more ridiculous until they're so blown out of proportion, its ludicrous.  Feel free to educate me at your convenience.
@AltLoading @BernieSanders Definitely the Tech companies,  Google and Twitter.  But let's look at CNN, and many other news agencies. They refuse to say one positive word about Trump. Others want to remove free speech. We must all be vigilant.  I say quit Facebook. I do like Twitter most of the time.
@ESSManMurphy @NancyPelosi No really I dont. Please humor me.
@RudyGiuliani @irvingdebbie55 It should Not be possible.  She is a government employee,  long term upper management and a black woman.   And because she was never reprimanded, demoted, or fired, she continues and becomes more brazen.
@NancyPelosi Nancy:  Accountable for what? What?  We need to know what you are referring so we can all make an educated decision.
@salsdad2018 @chark5678 @BernieSanders I dislike Bernie immensely. I love questioning him, Hillary, and Maxine. They never respond.  I'm a full fledge Republican.
@Maxx_Jams @realDonaldTrump @JeSuisDog What would that be.  Do you think we can control what criminals, murders, psychopaths do/think?  They will find a way, regardless.  If a criminal has a gun, obtained illegally and US citizens are no longer able to buy guns, who will win the fight?
@AltLoading @BernieSanders Well, large corporations provide a large number of jobs, here and globally.  So, yes, I agree they want incentives.  Think where we would be without them in the US.  Remember when they were leaving for India. We want to keep them here, we need them.
@AltLoading @BernieSanders I like you. I'm going to follow you.  Keep thinking OK!
@AltLoading @BernieSanders First, Corporations provide jobs.  Keep that in mind. Poor people dont.   Republicans don't jeopardize the middle class or business owners. Obama's famously said, people making more money should pay more it's only fair.  True meaning, take money from rich and give to poor.
@chark5678 @BernieSanders Let me guess, you live at home with your parents,  no job, no school, high school dropout, no friends because you are a victim of life.  It's everyone else's fault but yours. No, it's Trump's fault you are such a pitiful loser.
@AltLoading @BernieSanders I think they are being very serious.  Democrats think and believe their rhetoric.  What makes you think their words are sarcasm,  that makes no sense.  Socialist believe what they say is true and convince others of the same.  What do you believe?
@De2808814 @Thomas1774Paine @LeaSavoy Stated Perfectly!  Thank you.
@AltLoading @BernieSanders The Magic, you mean Voodoo.  This is Fun?  It's your money, your life, your future. If you relinquish control, you will lose all you have worked for.  You will pay for those who refuse to work, want a free ride in life because "they deserve it"!  After all, they have nothing.
@realDonaldTrump @JeSuisDog President Trump,  this Caravan must be stopped, in all ways possible.  You are in charge of protecting the American people and as such, can make this final determination. We cannot allow them into our Country.  Where will they go, how will they live, travel, money, housing, etc?

@HillaryClinton Hillary:  We don't care. Right now there are thousands of Hondurans heading towards our border and we want them stopped before they can come in and suck dry,  hard working people.  Those here illegally already, need to leave. Americans come first. You and Democrats need to help.
@AnnCoulter @JimKlunk I disagree Ann:  Doctors are so aware of the detrimental consequences if they prescribe any types of pain medications,  they won't due it.  They refuse to lose their license.  There are strict guidelines to follow. Thus, synthetic drugs from China; heroin and fentanyl are abused.

I've never in my life seen people with so much life and opportunity ahead of them choose to attack others for no reason other than hatred.  Parents you have failed if this is your child.
@RealJamesWoods Democrats begin by invoking fear into people, telling them they will lose all things free.  Then turns that fear into anger, no one wants to stop free and have to work.  The word is Control.
@chelseahandler Chelsea:  The word is Control. Every time a person depends on the government for money, food, housing, healthcare, they relinquish control of their lives. They want to be taken care of and not work.  This is what Democrats want, helpless sheep doing exactly what they tell them.

@realDonaldTrump President Trump,  please fight harder to stop the intrusion of these Honduran aliens.  They must not be able to come near the US border. It's apparent the Democrats don't care, aren't interested and will do nothing to stop them.  If they cross into the US, you will be blamed.

@LivPsy It's not always easy, professional or acceptable to remove yourself.  At times, we all must be around others we would rather not be. True to ourselves is learning how to react, engage and learn how to make the best of situations out of our control by choosing to control ourselves

@GeorgeT11622579 President Trump,  Do It!  America doesn't need this problem.  We aren't responsible or obligated to try and care for every person living outside of the US.  We have our own Poor and Homeless people living on the streets,  where we these invaders live?  Trump, stop them Now!

@OrderStAndrew Pay attention non Islamic countries,  this is the ideology of a religion that has no mercy.  A diabolical religion  many nations, cities are allowing to dominate, push punishment of peoples who refuse to believe in their Gods and refuse to bow down to their threats and demands.
@ISupport_Israel Non Islamic Nations are not obligated to appease Islam or Muslims. Islamic Muslims can practice their beliefs amongst themselves without trying to force those beliefs on Non Believers. This is our right, we can all choose  our own God.
@V_actually @PredictionMan @realDonaldTrump It appears the majority of violence is by young,  lost people, rebellious and ready to fight.  Stay away from these aggressive rioters, they will hurt you.  If you decide to go, bring protection,  extra people to surround you and riot gear.

@RealJamesWoods @FrancisLorenz5 I think President Trump has been angry about Sessions passivity towards Rosenstein and Mueller.  Trump most likely expressed to Sessions he must step up and play hard ball.  This is what we are seeing, a man who wants to keep his job and appease his boss.

@ISupport_Israel Britian,  you have completely lost your Right to Free Speech.  You should be able to criticize any persons, groups or political leaders.  You are not Islam. Criticizing Mohammed in Islam is punishable by death.  Criticizing Kim Jong Un or his regime in North Korea, is the same.
@fks2018 @PJHubbell @V_of_Europe Gov. Control the masses by inciting fear, control you by inducing fear, thus people refuse to act. To Quote the Bible, Be fearless.  God wants us to fear nothing.  I guess that's the difference in America,  we dont fear the Government or authorities, nor do invading migrants.
@fks2018 @PJHubbell @V_of_Europe This is the reality of an ever changing world.  It's nothing knew.  Those with nothing will come and seize, takeover a weak country.  Take the land, homes, money, food women. The government is giving these things away to invading refugees.  They dont have to fight hard to take it
@realMikeBenzUSA @V_of_Europe I think they are in for a very rude awakening.  These type of men have No Respect for women. Muslim men think of women as 1/2 of a person.  They have no rights under Islamic Sharia Law.
@fks2018 @realMikeBenzUSA @PJHubbell @V_of_Europe An in depth search to find out what's really happening in Sweden.  News media isn't showing the truth.  Sweden informing refugees how to date Sweden women?  Advertising Muslim clothing for women and children, children saying Islamic prayers in their schools.  Do you want this?
@ForBritainParty @kew79 Salvini has courage and is taking charge, taking back Italy.  He will be attacked by those who are to weak to stand up to overflow migrant influx into their countries. The refugees and migrants refuse to assimilate,  they instead demand the EU and UK peoples do what they want.
@realMikeBenzUSA @fks2018 @PJHubbell @V_of_Europe It appears almost all citizens are giving up and giving in to a dictatorship government.  The men and women must do all they can to turn the craziness around and keep Sweden great, no Sharia law,  no mandatory Islamic controls, no Muslim lifestyle for non Muslims.
@fks2018 @realMikeBenzUSA @PJHubbell @V_of_Europe Sweden's people must demand their country.  If not, Muslims, refugees  will continue to demand and take what they want.  Your country will be destroyed. It's shocking to read about what's happening in your schools, indoctrination into Islam.  Your children aren't safe.
@MichaelDelauzon @brandy1137 This speech alone is validation enough for ever person to go out and Vote Republican.

@SteveForbesCEO @LouisianaTimes Mr. Forbes:  Please be sure to Tweet Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton this great news.  According to them, we are suffering, losing money and are becoming poverty stricken.  Trump is turning our economy into income producing,  prosperity for all.

@AMike4761 President Trump refuses to take orders from the UN.  Other nations are furious with his refusal, they attack him constantly.  The world needs to stand up and take back their cities,  countries and their way of life.
@V_of_Europe What is the reason(s) Sweden wants to become an Islamic country?  Sweden use to be one of the happiest/healthiest places in the world to live.  There is no way it is still on that list.
@ISupport_Israel I think Muslims will only become more aggressive, they will keep pushing until they get exactly what they want.  Each time police and politicians back down to appease them,  they give that much more of their power away.
@Randal47073617 @AmyMek I live in US and am aware only of what I see and read. It appears whenever someone speaks out against the invasion they are arrested.  I agree with you, the people idly stood by and watch the invasion,  even welcoming it. I think it's only going to get worse.

@AmyMek Its so apparent now, UK and EU cities, the migrants refugees have no respect for the citizens, police nor the values once engrained in these peaceful places.  Are the people scared enough now they refuse to leave their homes, especially at night?  The law makers are blind. Sad!
@ISupport_Israel The UK is on a slow demise; continual loss of Freedom of Speech, Unable to stop the influx of refugees and migrants,  tax payers money supporting the non working migrants, construction of Mosques in large cities. How are the Islamic Muslim populations paying for these Mosques?
@AMike4761 Yes!

@AMike4761 She and every other unhappy free world Muslim can leave Canada, (EU, UK, USA) and find happiness in Saudi Arabia,  Afganistan,  Pakistan.   These  countries offer so much more for their lives and daily happiness.  Islam welcomes them with open arms.
@chelseahandler Who?  Let me guess,  Barack Obama .
@BasedPoland @audinarygirl He is a wealthy elitist who lives in a secured property with body guards and he wants borders from EU and Africa eradicated?  This is suicide.  Look at all the problems migrants and refugees are bringing into the UK and Europe.   There's no guarantee there will be assimilation.
@Kapp4774 @SenSanders Because criminals don't think clearly.  They have no thought of consequences for their actions.  And, there have been minimal numbers of executions carried out.  Most criminals who murder spend life in prison,  paid for by tax payers.
@SenSanders Ok Liberals, I really hope none of you agree with Bernie. There are people, specifically murderers who can't be reformed.  If a person has purposely taken another's life, should they be permitted to continue living?

@HillaryClinton Status Quo is the habit.  Democrats are angered at losing control of this Nation because they lost power and Status Quo of doing nothing in Government while receiving large incomes. Republicans will stop these bad habits, we have a working business man running the government now.
@HillaryClinton We need to stop illegal aliens from entering this country, period.  Americans refuse to continue paying for their needs while homeless and poor Americans are treated like second hand citizens.  That's what we need, not another countries ideals. Stop all benefits to illegal aliens

@jordanbpeterson Totally disagree with you.  Running away is cowardly,  Kavanaugh was accused and found innocent.  He must stay and be strong for our country.  What could stepping down possibly do to clear his name?  He would live out his life full of resentment, anger and hatred for quitting.
@JackPosobiec Mr. Peterson:  That makes no sense whatsoever.  His name has been cleared by becoming a justice. How exactly would stepping down clear his name?  He was falsely accused.  One must never quit or give up when falsely accused.

@xxlfunny1 @tina_tinalondon That's the man for me.

@emrata Your life must be so boring. There are real, brutal rapist in the world.  Read and learn the truth.  Don't just listen to one of your ignorant liberal friends who say, let's go attack a judge who has worked a life time to educate himself and be an integral part of this world.
@Phil_Gwilliam @PrisonPlanet @Csinaco They did, and so did the FBI.  These facts have been in the news for days.
@ASavageNation @pcnprosperity Because, obvious and foremost,  they don't go into San Francisco.  They don't witness what's happening.  The wealthy elite choose to be with others of the same.  So they go to their private clubs.  Until a majority of SF citizens confront Nancy &amp; other liberal leaders, no change.
@RealSaavedra @Bhava_Jim Molly use to make low budget movies in Hollywood,  like 2 movies. There's a pattern emerging, has been actors coming out and  spouting off about allegations of Republicans.  Stay out of politics,  make a documentary or commercials for cleaning products.
@G_Nic_Sic @robyn_vo @MollyRingwald I wouldn't say it either.
@MollyRingwald Right Molly, forget about the imprisoned criminals with no political affiliation, who have savagely raped even murdered women. Exclude them.  Focus on Kavanaugh, who ALLEGEDLY Fondled a hard core partier like Ford at a drunken party.  Molly, Burger King is waiting for you.
@Phil_Gwilliam @PrisonPlanet @Csinaco You are wrong, there's been more than an over complete investigation.  Should the FBI investigate Kavanaughs parents and their friends?

@PrisonPlanet @Csinaco I think Kavanaugh should look into the possibility of filing suit against Ford for slander and defamation of character.  If found guilty, she will be penalized.
@meadowfortommy @GHOSTBUSTOR @AMike4761 @jakelew75666768 I know, I research it every day.  Your leaders, Merkel,  May and Macron are so weak and have allowed Islamic Muslims to integrate and overtake, albeit slowly your in place systems once controlled by voting citizens. Sweden is forcing Islamic Prayer to kindergarten children.
@NancyPelosi @WSJ @Nasdaq Nancy:  You are so funny.  A sure sign of a manipulative, controlling person is to attempt to lead others towards another direction in order to take the focus off a failure, ie., Kavanaugh removal.

@kathygriffin Kathy: People in media, news, worldwide hate our President Trump. Do you think he had the power to cancel anything?  It may have been some other behavior you promoted. My advice, take or leave, step back and ask yourself,  what was my responsibility for actions taken against me?

@djmcosmo @jihadwatchRS Drawing a cartoon is in no way comparable to FGM, call to prayer, etc.  No violent religion or ideology should take over a city, country, nation and demand it's people obey and conform.  Does cartooning a holy leader to these people force them to stop their horrendous behavior??
@The1Voyce Let's think, if Muslims held cartoon contest of Jesus, how would Christians react?  Would we even respond?  Probably not. Some will be mad. ?Would a Christian(s) kill the people in contest? We know  Muslims have and will attack those demeaning their holy leader Mohammed. Not FGM.
@Corrynmb @agabus98 I hope you change doctors.
@ravencottage1 @jihadwatchRS Of course.  Ask yourself,  what's the exact reason for a Cartoon contest of Mohammed except to attack and possibly be murdered and have Other People murdered, by hostile violent persons.  Its senseless.
@jihadwatchRS Mr. Spencer:  Being the absolute expert on Islam, do you think drawing a cartoon image of Mohammed is an intelligent thing?  Being a violent/uncertain Religion, at times, isn't best not to provoke Muslims.  What good could possibly come from a Mohammed Cartoon Contest?
@geertwilderspvv @pilled_red What Good could possibly come from staging a cartoon contest of Islam's holly leader?  Provocation and insults will only lead to harm.  That's Common Sense.

Say what you want about me, this is reality.  A young innocent life destroyed by what? A criminal hiding out, ready to kill.

@Patrici15767099 @SariTreks What have women become when they say this about having an abortion?  And Oprah, her true identity is starting to show isn't it?  These women don't represent the majority of women in the world, that I'm quite sure of.
@Natural_Crisis And now in Florida, another day of rain.  This makes it almost 2 full months of rain, everyday.

@RealitySmash Try offering them a car,  your house, and money, they may then treat you like the infidel you are.
@NancyPelosi Thats right Nancy, make sure you inform all the illegal aliens exactly what they need to do to stay in this country. According to you and other Democratics, they are the future.
@PrisonPlanet @ScotForLiberty The future is upon us.
@NatalieElsberg There is no reason any person who is of able body and mind should live on that wage.  It's a starting point in life. Life is a ladder, go to school, get an education and higher wages will follow.  Drop the suffering victim mentality.

@CllrBSilvester @SonOfScotland70 This article is revealing and should be read by all.  The author is correct, there is nothing that can be done about the African Muslim Immigrants already in Germany.

@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Nancy, you don't even have to worry or concern yourself or other Democrats with these matters.  President Trump has it all taken care of and he's doing a fabulous job.
@StephenKing Mr. King:  Before you attempt to criticize President Trump, think about and reflect on the words Nancy Pelosi,  Maxine Waters, H. Clinton have said, only a minute few. According to HRC, we are deplorables; remember?
@RealitySmash Any person who is OFFENDED.
@prebs_73 @Bhava_Jim @Joefish1967 @EricJoh37288055 @SebGorka You are correct.  When young, life is a struggle especially if you want to be successful.   Young people see Democrats as wanting to make their lives easier through, cheap education,  cheap loans, free stuff.  Then, we wake up.  So ultimately,  there's hope for young people.
@jihadwatchRS Close your MC account now, contact someone highest in authority and then write letters and emails.  Don't let them treat you like this.  Announce the MC company on Twitter if no satisfactory results.   We can then, all close our accounts.
@jihadwatchRS Mastercard?  They are blaming their actions on MC?  I find that extremely difficult to believe.   Credit cards companies, are not involved in politics,  are they?
@ActivePatriots And How are the employees going to get the phone numbers for the parents, from the shoplifters?
@rsg She is a fool and an idiot.  Trump is the only person and President who has the guts to tell it like it is.  She has no right attacking him.  He gave her a great job and awesome salary,  $179,700.  He doesn't like being used or disrespected so deal with it.
@GiancarloDeRisi @mandiloucats This is exactly what President Trump said would happen.  It's happening all over Europe and European citizens are shocked and confused by all of the violence.  It's real, it's happening and it's not going away.
@OnlineMagazin I feel like I'm suffocating and can't breathe every time I see a woman wearing a burka and trying to speak.

@RealAlexJones I'm going to keep saying this, Quit Facebook.   How did we survive before it existed?  There is life away from Facebook.  Don't let Zuckerberg control your mind.
@PrisonPlanet @JillDoby People with these types of disorders have been around for hundreds of years, so don't be surprised, it's nothing new.  Because of technology and social media, we are all able to see and experience their realities.  Ask any Psychiatrist, they will explain their challenges.
@THEHermanCain @emtee2355 The Trump Administration must follow a new protocol,  don't trust employees. This is sad but after experiencing what his haters are capable of, there are no other options.
@OnlineMagazin @Igoo49193858 A sick world, and a sad existence.  We must never allow this way of life into the civilized world.  France just passed the law of no age limits for children consenting to sex.  Child marriage is next in France.  Do these countries really want to become a new middle east?
@RealitySmash Law abiding people are so stunned with disbelief when they see these brazen criminals act,  they freeze.  Business owners will have to change the way they do business or they will lose all they've worked for.  Thieves come to steal and destroy.
@RealJamesWoods Because Trump liked her strength when she was on his show.  He gave her the job at the WH, she was making $179,700 per year.  How many people would love an opportunity like that?  She has an entitlement mentality.  Her tapes prove absolutely nothing.  Want to know why fired?
@PrisonPlanet A bad idea bringing refugees of 3rd world countries into socially cultured environments.  Bad idea.
Let's put this in correct perspective:  Omarosa made $179,700 per year working under President Trump.  Her official title, Assistant to the President and Director of Public Liaison.
@1Romans58 @brandy1137 How can she possibly speak badly against Trump?  He gave her a huge opportunity in the White House.  A chance to voice her opinions and help others, all while receiving a generous salary.  Any person would be more than grateful to receive what she did.  Now, she's a victim.
@NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters Nancy:  You are confused with that statement.  Trump has no fear whatsoever of You Or Maxi Pad or any other woman, anywhere.  It's comical and strange how you come up with these delusional thoughts.
@Pismo_B @emtee2355 Pitiful.
@V_of_Europe @PurpleHaze1717 Have you ever seen such civil unrest in a civilized society?  These invaders only know how to destroy everything in their paths.  No rational thought process.  Only demand, and if they dont get what they want, they come unhinged using violence.
@WorlMedia @Welshdellb0y I pray everyday we keep this out of America.
@PamelaGeller Look what Politicians have done to these cities.  They have become war zones, wild vigilantes roaming the streets causing violence and destruction.   Your lives will never be the same.  Gone are the carefree times of living, now watch your back, protect children and friends.
@kate_hillman @RedVelvet_Kitty Grown men make a choice, a sex doll or a real woman. Relationships take work, the dolls bypass this strenuous behavior and allow men to live in a fantasy world. Sex;  when and how they want. No demands, dolls always say yes to sex. Let men live how they want to live. Their right.
@oflynnmep @VernonFGunn If what Muslim women say is true, they choose to wear Burqas and are not forced, they deserve no pity.  They are living a life based on their religious beliefs.  If they want to succeed,  they will have to become educated,  assimilate, dress and think as does our society.

@RL9631 @crimsonfaith88 C. Clinton has a child, this speaks volumes of who she is.  If she truly believed in Abortion, wouldn't she have aborted her child? Her agenda and goals, as is all goals of the Clintons and Democrats is to obtain votes, at any cost.  Even if what they say is untrue.
@AmericanVoterUS @emtee2355 Powerful people believe in and worship Satan, thinking he will bestow money &amp; knowledge unto them. Also called Luciferien or The Illuminati.   The practice has been used by thousands of powerful,  wealthy people for hundreds of years.  You would be surprised by followers.
@LibertarianBlue @xqben @BreitbartNews Not acceptable.

@trooper2121 @Push4Contest I have read one of H. Clinton's best friends, John Podesta is a Luciferien.  So, It's extremely possible the Clintons are as well.  This is not suprising.

@kentparkstreet @DailyMirror I'm very aware of the difference,  I think faster than I type.  Small, trivial minded thinker.
@kentparkstreet @DailyMirror What did people say about building an automobile,  flying a plane and send a rocket with Astronauts to the moon.  Look what Elon Musk and Jeff Bazos try to create.  Your mind is clogged with stupidity.  Trump is futuristic and sees opportunities for new growth in the US.
@kentparkstreet @DailyMirror Your wrong.  It is the future.  IT will control every aspect of life and Trump wants a head start, because, other countries are already working to conquer space, technology and beyond.  (CHINA).  Please get an education.
@davidkurten @NufcEngland1966 Does education always have to be productive or enable one to get a job?  There are those who want to learn for enrichment only.  There are people with wealth who dont work but want to better themselves.  The program should be cancelled only if it is losing money and no students.
@DailyMirror When you say Twitter,  what you really are saying is Liberal Twitterers, not Conservatives.  Let's get it right.
@barchalk_joanne @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump My advice to you!  Don't Tweet Conservative Trump supporters.   We love our country.   You and other liberals do not.  You refuse to see the truth.  Keep your opinions to yourself.
@DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump This man clearly has an agenda.  A large, extreme agenda only top leaders admit to wanting.  Busch Sr.  Administration admitted to a One World Order, so did Obama.   What is the reason, a minimum level Prosecutor want a One World Order, governed by a One World Government?
@RealAlexJones It's time now to fight back at Destroy Facebook.   Yes, it can be done.  Ask yourself,  can you go a day or 2 without logging in to Facebook?  If you are able, you can quit.  It's time to Take Zuckerberg down.  Relinquish his power, money and control over social media and Win.

@Cory_1077 @fcRedRockAZ Every child should experience the joy and unconditional love of an animal.  And as they grow, that love, care and empathy will stay with them for eternity. Animals are innocent want only to please.  Teach children to love and care by responsibility of owning a pet.
@dbongino @Csinaco I've said this before but it's worth repeating.   Facebook,  Twitter,  Google and now Wikipedia are all owned and controlled by liberals.  We need to offset this by creating compatible sites from Conservatives for Conservatives.  Then the truth will be explained and shared.
@USAHotLips @RedVelvet_Kitty A young child under 16 yrs, is clueless about sex. This move is most likely pushed by Muslims wanting to marry children brides.  They are winning.

@OnlineMagazin This is what happens when you allow a religion to permeate a strong hold into a society.  This is Islam, but it could be any religion outside of Christianity.   I see one Muslim man in the room.  Why not allow every religion time to say a prayer and only allow Islamic?
@OnlineMagazin What insanity.  Are these politicians out of their minds? How can every person in that room bow their head to an Islamic prayer?  This better not ever take shape in America.  I truly believe we would fight it with every dollar we have.  The Citizens have to be outraged.
@shannon07732343 That's crazy.  I've been warned numerous times so I have to choose my words carefully.

@myemc36 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog No, you are incorrect.  We witnessed a President trying to solidify relationships with Russia.  Trump has been sabotaged before he was even in office and the Democrats don't care about the words they use to attack him, they are all lies. Trump attacked the left.

@Gareth99999 @pilled_red This is a chance for liberals to live in their make believe lives, in front of the world.  They usually only do this in private or in clubs late at night.

@pimpmytweeting Let Londoners be invaded by Muslims and refugees,  your not hurting Americans, only yourselves. President Trump won't waste or invest any more time into trying to  help London thrive.  Live with your Muslim Mayor and your loss of Freedom of Speech.  Sharia Law is on the way.

@bbusa617 @Snap_Politics President Trump will never heed any warning or threat my a Mayor of a once beautiful,  thriving city.

@KamalaHarris I strongly urge you to view Homeless Crises in the Bay Area.  Americans with children and Veterans living on the San Francisco streets.  Hundreds of children. We owed it to OUR AMERICAN CHILDREN first and foremost, to be fed, housed and clothed before we owe anything to illegals

@V_of_Europe Finally, honesty.
@Kind_Geek No, you weren't rude, just to the point.  I'm a big follower of Douglas Murray and Robert Spencer, I've read several of their books and follow them here and on YouTube. Please take care and share your wisdom. B
@Kind_Geek @AJmarti95995920 @dizzytex San Francisco is a wealthy city, with much tourism and one would think the Government would inspire to keep the streets clean.  So, if they wont do anything except be a Sanctuary City and allow massive influxes of illegals, then people with wealth may want to step in and help.
@Kind_Geek I'm not questioning you.  I believe you.  And thank you for the response.  I dont live there so I'm not an authority on what's happening and look to people like you to inform of what I dont know.
@Kind_Geek Ok!
@kathygriffin @ACTBrigitte Kathy, I think your time of relevancy is over.  There's nothing more demeaning than an old, washed up celebrity or comedian in your case.  You were semi funny back in the old days.  We all wish you well.
@BlissTabitha He can demand all he wants, it means absolutely nothing to everyone.
@Kind_Geek Then why is your Mayor asking Citizens of London to help police officers with the crime.  Follow Online Magazine.  He sends videos of all the UK, EU crimes happening.
@PrisonPlanet This is devastatingly disgusting to me.  Most women exercise to look and feel good.  She eats, all the time, non stop.
@PrisonPlanet Democrats are filled with anger and hatred,  and they blame Trump. Ask them what's the reason.  Their answers are as ignorant,  unbalanced and totally lost and confused.  That's who they are.
@mdove14 @MSNBC I dont answer liberals because I just can't stand the ignorance.  You have no concept or understanding of what is happening in the world today.  I strongly suggest you never tweet about Politics again.
@Maximus_4EVR @Jojoinguette Democrats are lost.  They have no idea what they want,  believe in or how to make America great.  They only know how to attack and create negative chaos in the world.  They Jump on every issue trying to destroy Trump.
@BobArrington2 @larouti They are finally realizing what they've done, allow people into their countries who will never assimilate and have no Christian belief system,  and are Not compatible with the EU, UK, and America. Asian countries already know this.  You won't see Islamification in Asia.
@John_KissMyBot @TruthMatters13 Socialism signifies opposition to Capitalism and advocacy for a post capitalist system based on some form of social ownership of the nbn means if Production. Does anyone really think America could ever be a Socialist Nation?  We thrive on capitalism, we build wealth. Learn it.
@foxandfriends @Jojoinguette Thank you.  They must finish this tax payer funded witch hunt.  The US citizens have spoken.  We refuse to keep paying you to do nothing but illicit fake material to try and destroy President Trump.   You will lose. We are winning with Trump and we like it.
@MSNBC Rob: Get a grip on Reality.  Trump is not a criminal. It's so incomprehensible the way Liberals think.  What's the reason you hate your country winning.  We are winning with Trump.  Do you want a complete take over by criminals with an open border?  Look what's happening in Eu.
@OnlineMagazin Irish People:  Wake up, this is serious.   If you don't stop the Islamification of your country, it will no longer be your country.  Sharia Law will rule and your lives will be in complete disparity.  Leaders all over Europe are pushing for acceptance of Complete Islam.
@AJmarti95995920 @dizzytex Correct!  This is so unacceptable in America.  The richest country in  the world.  Let's stop letting in illegals and supporting them, stop trying to solve all other world problems and fix this problem; Homelessness.  Protest for our people first, not illegals.
@ColumbiaBugle @dizzytex I'm white so I can say this.  Why is it always a bunch of stupid, white women,  (majority) pushing to stop illegal immigration.   Don't they jobs?
@NancyPelosi Nancy:  Congress can not and will not control the actions of human beings.  This isn't a Gun issue/problem.  It's a crime, a crime that's happening all over the world. So stop trying to convince yourself and others that issuing less guns will prevent world violence and crime.
@PMark1966 Since it's closed, theres no money coming in so I'm sure owner doesn't want to pay out any money.  She messed up big time.
For staff members at the Red Hen, you have now lost over 2 weeks of income.  In life, for every action there is an equal reaction. Don't blame anyone but yourselves, don't be a victim. You each made the decision asking Sanders to leave so accept responsibility as an adult.

@FoxNews @SenSchumer Yes, thank you Supreme Court.   Nancy Pelosi,  get over and be thankful.  President Trump is protecting Americans from the reckless, destruction happening in so many W/EU countries from rapid, immigrant and refuge influx with no borders and no structure to determine terrorist.
@MossadJack @LadyMercia Wow!  It looks like the gang was waiting for an easy target.  Thank God for those brave men helping the woman and child.  It appears women with children can no longer walk the streets of London alone.  Very sad, such a once beautiful city.

@chatteris18 @SonOfScotland70 Yes, I absolutely agree with Putin.  The problem is they want to overtake or insert imperialism over all of the UK and EU.  The Islamic leaders have stated this.  Read  Douglas Murray's new book .
@hrtablaze @SonOfScotland70 They would never strip naked in any European city.   The police could do nothing to save them from being attacked.  Stupid, stupid.
@V_of_Europe @SonOfScotland70 Women should never be or go anywhere alone in any European city.  They are no longer the same safe cities they used to be, sad but true.  Be smart ladies and men, be sceptical and use your head.
@thebradfordfile @kwilli1046 Did everyone know Nancy Pelosi is 78 years old.  That's amazing.  Just goes to show what money can do.
@thehill Sorry, we don't believe it.  Polls are so unreliable.   The same person can take an online survey many times.  The Polls are skewed towards  information from liberal democratic voters only.  No Conservatives want  Trump impeached.  They want him voted President again in 2020.
@ISupport_Israel Thank you so much for informing the World of exactly what's happening and who is responsible.  To all those who are skeptical,  do your research.  Liberals are hiding the truth and don't want you to see the UK and EU, now.  The violence is permeating every aspect of EU life.

President Trump wants to combine the Labor Department and Education Department into one Organization. The department of education is one of the most powerful federal organizations and it's highly probable they will fight this with everything they have.
@PatriotHard @koopster90 People refuse to see the truth about what's happening in London. The Mayor is Muslim and denies there is the selling of women sex slaves.  The police won't talk about it, they are scared.  The news won't report the truth because it's a crime to speak badly of Islam. Sad Facts.
@StirringTrouble @JasSpin1 The United States has been experiencing this same leftist bias from the media ever since Trump became President.  It's so intense and full of hatred and lies, that it's become painful to watch and we don't Trust the news at all anymore.
@TheHirstComment @EUVoteLeave23rd Some may think it cruel not to help these migrants. Facts, Italians will have to support them for a long time.  They don't share Italy's values, no respect for women and a completely different ideology of life.  Many adversities to overcome, and it's not fair to Italy citizens.
@jerome_corsi @avibebert Maybe Neilson should think about filing charges of harrassment and a hostile environment against this secretary.
@KTHopkins @scrantlings Obama shipped immigrant children to foster homes all over the US, after 20 days ended. Trump, however, will keep the children with family and not allow fostering attempts.  This is good for US because parents and children will be deported.
@V_of_Europe Sadly, Islam has moved in and now there are challenges.   Britian and other European nations, ie.,  Germany gladly allow Islam and welcome the diversity.  London has A Muslim Mayor and you will see more Muslims entering Political positions.
@SenSanders Bernie, you are so smart, (You almost beat Hillary), what exactly do you think Trump should do?  He's reuniting kids w/parents.  Parents/relatives are criminals and will be deported w children unless granted asylum.  Illegals have no rights in US and Will Not be released, Trump.

@HuckmonAme @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I agree, People in states with no jobs must consider moving to where the jobs are.  I moved to N FL from Ohio because there were no jobs. (Akron)  Homeless in CA have those options.  So what's the reason they won't leave?

@DVATW @langdaler She caters to Muslim religion only.   A coward, She wants to appease the religion hoping  efforts will stop the violence and discord of subjugating non Muslims in Britain.   Islam is truly taking more control and once they have Muslims in high offices, Sharia will be enforced.
@hrtablaze @1dizzytexpam That event completely backfired on her.  She  thought she was dealing with, grateful, well mannered illegal immigrants.   Her hand holding the microphone was trembling.   She probably feared for her safety.
@TradBritGroup @RedVelvet_Kitty People are living in a war zone.
@KTHopkins @FaithFlaherty3 This is midievil behavior, guilty with no jury trial, torture, mental abuse and psychological abuse.   How can this happen in the 21st Century?  You are not a 3rd world country with vigilante justice.
@tictoc You need to keep track of devices Government employees use.  It is a crime up to and including the firing of anyone using personal email or other IT not pre-approved.  This isn't difficult. Stop the problems when small before they spiral out of control.
@azuredawn9 @NancyPelosi Obama did absolutely nothing for this Country.  Never forget it.  He sold us out for money and power at any costs.  He tried sabotaging Trump's candidacy and knew HClinton was dishonest on every level.  if you want to rebuke this, provide facts, proof of anything good for US.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, Nancy Pelosi is calling for an Uprising to allow illegal immigrants into this country.  If this creates violence in our streets, destruction of personal property or even death,  please find a way to remove her from office.  America wants safe.
@BlissTabitha Meghan knew what she signed up for when joining this leftist show.  She's tough,  she will be fine.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The only thing immoral is millions of homeless people lining the streets of CA cities and you and Democratics preaching about allowing illegal immigrants into our country where me and my fellow Americans will have to pay to support them instead of deserving Americans in need.
@Fernsalright @pilled_red You failed!  And we are all laughing at you, Comey and McCabe and all others fired and soon to be fired.
@grateful_web @JimCarrey You are obviously a very poor, insecure, loser.
@WiredSources @thebeave Nancy take your medication and GO to bed.  You want an uprising?  This is violence in the streets.  You will be held accountable if their are lives lost, property destroyed.  Americans need an uprising to have you removed from office.  We won't stand for your assaults.
@ActivePatriots We know exactly what to say to them don't we?
@grateful_web @JimCarrey All wealthy people in world must have extreme drive and confidence.  Losers think he is arrogant and self centered, winners are inspired by his success and want to emulate his behaviors.  Poor, miserable, depressed people can do nothing for others in life.  Look what he can do.
@grateful_web @JimCarrey No way in hell Trump is a M.  He is confident and tough and very self assured.  Do you know why he detects negative people and builds himself up?  Think about it.  First,  a Billionaire,  now a President who is attacked, threatened w impeachment and now NY is suing his family.
@marklevinshow @SpoilRottenPup Of course he did, Americans know this. He is corrupt and the question is, how deep does the FBI corruption go?
@ActivePatriots So what will be the new Islamic name for the United kingdom?  Islam will want to change it once they have complete control.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, where are you living? Obama as President,  unemployment was higher than any other President except for Jimmy Carter.  President Trump is doing an outstanding job reducing unemployment and creating jobs for Americans while you keep pampering illegal immigrants and giving $$
@PunkOnWhiskey I'm in 100% agreement.
@grizz_meister No way in hell.
@BreitbartLondon So, so wrong.  The citizens living in these countries are paying for arriving immigrants and refugees.  This is unfair to hard working families already scraping to get by.  Pope you are out of touch with reality and have no clue of the difficulties the new arrivals are creating.
@Chy_369 @BarbaraAKelley Unless their unable, each person needs to learn how to eat healthy.  You will find in life, people's choices and decision making leads to their poor economic conditions.   Of course their are exceptions. CA, homelessness is insane.  Why do they stay?  We've all have adversities.
@Chy_369 @BarbaraAKelley The water problem in Flint needs several good attorneys to help fix, it's a government issue.  Most homeless have mental illness problems, drug issues, alcohol, etc.  Most can work,  but chose not to or are unable.  The article was about food and water, not processed food, edible
@AnyTreet @SkyNews I work for the FDOT so I'm into road safety.  You are correct though. He is a really bad driver.  Speeding and not paying attention. I see it everyday.
@BarbaraAKelley @Chy_369 That's insanity.  There is no human being in the US deprived of food and water.  Just look at us, (not me, I'm skinny), we are all overweight, lazy and too comfortable.
@SkyNews A stupid Floridian.  No seatbelts, we have so many safety signs on roads in Florida.  Safety on the roads is our main priority.
@PangurGaming @tcooke55 @jihadwatchRS Thanks so much!!!
@tcooke55 @jihadwatchRS And the original story was sent by Robert Spencer whom I follow and admire greatly.
@tcooke55 @jihadwatchRS The point I'm making is, this is just the beginning and there are most likely more churches with same mindset.  My continual research into the Islamification of Europe is beyond unsettling and your leaders, most, allow Muslims to control the environment. Many predict worsening.
@Bobbipenut Let's all please note:  "The mother said ".  Thus, in all probability it's not accurate.
@jihadwatchRS Only you and people like you call him a bigot.  In the news today, Sweden decided to remove all crosses in their churches so Muslims won't be offended.  Say goodbye to Sweden.  You and people like you will be forced into submission by Islam, as described by R. Spencer, Sharia Law
@ISupport_Israel You know what, just let the Islamic Muslims have the country, just turn it over to them completely.  Why drag it out and prolong the suffering of Christians and non-Muslims.

@NancyPelosi We are so scared Nancy Pelosi,  please stop, no more.
@PrisonPlanet @CataNigra Congratulations,  it's about time someone is speaking out acknowledging the truth happening to the UK and EU.
@FILFUNGI @MailOnline You too my friend.  keep it up!!
@FILFUNGI @MailOnline Thanks.  We don't receive any information on these countries like we do from the UK and EU.  Which, by the way, I appreciate you updating/informing us on these issues of migrants bombarding  countries and the resulting fallout.
@FILFUNGI @MailOnline What about Asian countries?  Have they participated in welcoming the refugee immigrants.  We dont read about this anywhere in the news.  I know Mexico won't take in refugees. What does that leave?
@CllrBSilvester There are 500,000 young female Muslims in this country?  Staggering.  The procedure is considered child abuse I'm sure.
@grateful_web @JimCarrey Definition of Winner/Loser:  Winner celebrates life and challenges, success of self and others.   Confident, overcomes and thrives.

@allenmike734 @JillHar34771755 @CllrBSilvester In America, anyone practicing this female torture and extreme mutilation will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
@Reuters Let's hope it happens soon.  Let Kim Jong Un get a taste of the good life.  Trump is perfect for this.  He knows what the good life is and how to achieve it.  Let's hope this opens KJU's eyes and he begins to help his people and his country.  It can happen.
@AmyMek We [Americans] dont want and we never, ever will become an Islamic Nation, controlled by a belief in Allah and Sharia Law.
@JimCarrey Jim:  I really like your movie, Dumb and Dumber.  Funny!  Trump doesnt drink.  It's challenging for you to understand how relationships work, they start with a beginning,  move towards positivity and evolve into ongoing ups and downs known as the Ebb and Flow of life.  Unknown!
@aelksnis1 @SenSanders WHAT?
@Talkmaster His vocabulary is impressive.   He used the same numerous times and the educational level of those words are that of a 2nd grader.  Progress is happening with many Democrats.
@BillOReilly They don't like Trump's strength and courage and his steadfast ability to Not be pushed around or intimidated by anyone.  They really hate his intent to control our borders, they don't control theirs and what they hate the most is his closure of the US pocket book$$$$$$.
@jihadwatchRS Facts are facts and the public wants to hear the straight forward truth about problems we face instead of nicey nicey watered down nothing words.
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Nancy, please show statistical,  and mathematical proof when confusing your reality with the truth about health care in the US.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Watching the cancer spread in the UK and EU, the cancer called open borders, public support, housing to immigrants and refugees,  we Americans remain grateful our President is in Control of who enters our country and remains.
@aelksnis1 @SenSanders That why, in America, employees not paid according to the law can hire one of our experienced attorneys.   Most will take a case for free and if enough disgruntled come forward,  it can become a quasi class action suit.   These are the Facts.  I don't try anything.  Reality .
@SenSanders Right now, illegal immigrants have no health insurance and use emergency rooms for their medical needs.  Hospitals can't turn them away because they cant pay.  So they shut down and health care goes up. Life is not free, health insurance isn't free, nor should it be.
@SenSanders Medicare is available for everyone,  once you turn 62 years old.
@SenSanders It is illegal to withhold overtime pay and I'm quite sure attorneys would file class action lawsuits against any businesses participating in this practice.  Good try Bernie.
@RyanAFournier @BarackObama @HillaryClinton That's because they are drinking away the pain.  They will resurface once the hangover is gone.
Trump doesn't need or want you speaking for or about him.  You have no Presidential authority for any role in his Administration.  You are a nobody. Dont say his name.  Robert De Niro apologizes to Canada for 'idiotic behavior' of Trump https://t.co/ufxjz7MCOq via @MailOnline
One of the most inspiring qualities of Trump?  He is so positive and motivated to rise above the continual attacks on him and his administration.   He sets his mind on his goal and he accomplishes it.  Discipline,  focus and determination,  not deterred by negative liberals.
@RodStryker @langdaler @WiredSources Do they still enact Baker Act in those cities.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,  I think Kim Jong Un likes you.  I know he looks up to and respects you!
R. DeNiro: you n your liberal Hollywood friends despise Trump for his stance on illegal immigration.    What have you/them contributed towards helping massive LA homeless problems.   Your combined net worths could surely create new living accommodations.  You've done nothing.
@NancyPelosi @WhipHoyer @RepEliotEngel @RepAdamSmith @RepAdamSchiff Nancy, your attempts at staying relevant are becoming embarrassing. PRESIDENT TRUMP,  knows exactly what he's doing and doesnt need your help or input.  Thanks.
@kadaster_mehmet @V_of_Europe I don't know have a clue what your saying.  But I do know there are Muslims attacking in France,  as well as other immigrants and refugees.  I do my homework.

@ISupport_Israel The world is behind you and on your side.  Your Government won't resolve, protect and prevent the Islamisation of Belgion, so it's up to the citizens to take action.
@mmckinnon @derekahunter They are filled with so much angry, hatred and self loathing.  They also live here in America.  Have been given so much by so many.

@Fuctupmind @grizz_meister Rule of beauty 101:  Always look in a mirror before going on live television.

@SenSanders Bernie: Reality 101, these democracies who claim to be friends, charge exuberant amounts of monies on tariffs.  Trump is diplomacy.  America comes first and foremost with Trump.  He must establish a relationship with non democracies, as declared by you.  We will win, Trump 2020.

This is their country,  their homes and lives.  What is the reason they all want it destroyed?  There is logical or reasonable answer.
@ArmsControlWonk I think you are correct about Kim Jong Un wanting to meet with US President for many years.  And that he wants the respect he thinks he deserves.  I think he respects Trump, But Trump administration needs to just shut up and stop calling him names.  Each will show their respect.
@JacobAWohl @SpoilRottenPup There's poop on your hands, disgusting.
@JohnBrennan TRUMP is Protecting us, And We want him to JB.  Trump represents millions of Americans and our National Interests.  You and Nancy Pelosi need to leave this country and live in Canada or Iran.  Trump will win a second term as President.   Be Afraid.   Trump 2020
@JeremySteptoe @langdaler @MuslimCouncil Never, Muslims follow the Koran and Mohammed.
@tictoc Let's all hope and Pray, Progress, regardless of how minute, is made with all countries at this meeting with Kim Jong Un present.  He needs to step into the 21st century and help his people, country and their futures.
@HMPCop @CataNigra Really strange.  Was that a parade with off duty Officers?  American police would never disgrace the uniform or confidence of the city that employees them.  These police act like the are a joke.
@Luke_21_20 @dgorman52 @MAGAVoice1 @gaye_gallops I wonder why Trump is the only person sitting?  All others are hovering around him.  Maybe he is completely relaxed and confident.
@exm4321 @GoldingEva @LionofThe @WalterNeff6 Never, ever be afraid.  Don't let any person or thing scare you.  The only thing to fear is fear itself.
@kathygriffin What's the message KG?  Do you really think President Trump will bow down to any woman on the face of this earth, ever?  He is a strong man and he submits to no woman or man.  He is in complete control of the meeting, not Angela Merkel .  And that's the way we Americans like it.
@Graeme12304557 The secret service needs to Bitch Slap Macron.
CNN just won't stop the vicious, fear mongering attacks on Trump.  France, Germany and Canada all have horrendous, out of control, un regulated refugee crises.  Trump is fixing US so this wont happen to the US.  He knows exactly what he's doing and wont be intimidated by PMs.

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Get a grip on Reality Nancy.  America leads the world as no.1 Economy, per latest Bloomberg report and Obama almost destroyed the world with his Iran Deal.  Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
@tictoc @IMD_Bschool Nancy Pelosi,  please read this out loud for all Democrats to hear.  And President Trump is too blame. USA
@Chicago1Ray @avibebert His parents are to blame.  They should have kicked him out at 18 years old.  They allowed him to live in their home, for free, thus enabling his behavior.  Are parents scared, guilty, confused, too helpful?  What's the problem?
@netflix Please, please parents. Don't allow your children to watch this show.  It's sickening.   What is Hollywood going to promote next?  If America accepts this stupid trash, Hollywood will continue to push their agenda and there will be no limits to what on.

@BillOReilly Yes its smart. He knows exactly what he's doing, he will continue making the right choices for Americans. He's American.  The other leaders have allowed complete infiltration of their countries by refugees,  immigrants and non assimilating Muslims.  Their countries are gone.
@jihadwatchRS In  America, Swat and 50 Police cars would be sent and demolish those criminals.   They know Italian police cant and wont do anything, thus the crimes continue and will esculate.

@IvanTrumpovic1 @grizz_meister And, let's add I'm sure he's not agreement with them on numerous agendas and thinks it's  waste of time talking.  They won't  change their minds on issues.

@RealitySmash @pilled_red Britian,  you have released starving wild carnivores into a petting zoo.
@RealitySmash @pilled_red British should be outraged over this destruction. What's the reason your Government isn't doing anything to Stop this disgraceful destruction?  These Muslim vigilantes will continue their rampage until your entire country is overrun by Islam, invoking Sharia Law. Death to you.
@ISupport_Israel If Muslims prayers continues in streets of France, tourism will decline, thus adversely affecting the economy and citizens prosperity.  Americans would never allow this in the streets of a big city, on any regular basis.  Muslims have Mosques, why not use them?
@ACTforAmerica Nor Japan, or many other Asian areas.
@BillOReilly I would like to Add, the press/ media/global liberal leaders are Trying to destroy Trump everyday.  They have not/ will not succeed because he just keeps getting:  Better, Stronger,  Wiser.
@NancyPelosi Nancy Pelosi,  what exactly are you trying to say with that Statement?  Please explain.  Thank you!
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Nancy, from his first day, Trump has been working hard on excellence in health care for all Americans.  Obama said we could keep our doctors, not true. Costs were so outrageous, no one could pay premiums and companies keep dropping his Plan.  Generalizations are not facts, Nancy.
@NancyPelosi Stories as these are fe. Birth control pills for women have been around for over 30 plus years.  Liberal Media will spend months trying to reinforce an extreme view point of a Democratic Leader such as Nancy Pelosi.  If this ONE individual in a million is denied, go to court.
@SkyNews I absolutely agree with you.  And this begins with each one of us, one day at a time, with mindful practice.  I know I am working on taking my recycling bags with me when shopping.  Thank you, please continue talking awareness.
@SassySculptor @onedovealone You are absolutely correct.
@chelseahandler Trump is doing an amazing job as President.  Unfortunately,  Chelsea, U,  to much time on your hands doing absolutely nothing.  Trump doesn't drink, smoke or do drugs, one reason his brain has a high functioning IQ.  That stands for Intelligence Quotient. In case you didnt know.
@NancyPelosi Nancy Pelosi you seem to forget when Obama was President, gas was over $3.00 per gallon.  The highest ever, and even higher in your state, CA.  That's the reason Trump wants to make America self sufficient and produce our own oil so we're not dependent on foreign oil.
@LadyMercia @UnityNewsNet We know they dont work, but do they go to school at all?
@JennyWa25410824 @SpoilRottenPup Of course they will say this because most are non muslims in America and Muslims believe we are not important and beneath them.  Muslims believe they rule only.
@SenSanders Bernie:  US states are or already have moved forward allowing medical marijuana.   Many states don't advertise this fact, like Florida.  It has been legal here for several years but it's not widely known unless specifically asked for.  You should know legislation moves slowly.
@thinkrightuk Your media was deleted,  I'm sure your not surprised
@DVATW @ActivePatriots David, I read the letter and I hope the actions requested aren't even considered.   Do you still have a right to free speech and freedom of thought or is it a crime?  It appears complete and undeniable control of over what is said about Islam is the goal.
@veteranhank What are you just saying Hogg?  Airplane crashes R mostly accidental. There are those, as in 911, that were taken hostage and all on board killed.  There are, Please read carefully,  Very mean and dangerous people in the world who want to do harm and kill other people.  Reality.

@chelseahandler @dennisrodman Chelsea, Dennis is a throw down drunk.  If you've watch programs showing him in North Korea visiting Kim Jong Un, you would know that.

@realDonaldTrump @mispats2u President Trump,  there's still too much talk about Mueller and his investigation.  It really needs to end, now.  Who can do that?
@thebradfordfile @ambinc1 That's because acknowledging winners will make the losers look and feel badly about themselves.   Our society today, doesnt believe in competition that will make someone feel bad.  In schools today, all children are the same.   Congratulations to you, the parent.
@SenSanders And the answer would be yes.  As long as there are threats to our country or countries as allies,  we will have war if necessary.
@ConservativePTZ @RyanAFournier That is just so true.  Sad but true.
@AliSalari1965 @TrumpTrainMRA4 No, this is Muslims.  The Koran dictates the payment of you are a non Muslim.  You should know smoking and drinking are forbidden by Sharia Laws.  Consider yourself lucky you didnt lose a limb or worse.

@MarkACollett @Bomba2H Remember,  the only goal of Islam is Imperialism.   They want to Islamiphy the entire world.  Never doubt this.  It will mean Sharia Law is the only Law.
@ActivePatriots Insanity.   Total insanity!
@rht2bheard @patcondell Islam's only goal is to created an Islamic world; Imperialism.   Islam is the Koran and Mohammed, that's it.  It is more than a religion, it is a life, Nationalism.  Please everyone educate yourselves on Islam.  Belief, if you are a non Muslim,  you are a non human.  In Koran.

@AMike4761 @Bomba2H Absolutely.   The Judge has no way of knowing if the person is who they claim to be or if they are concealing a weapon.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, JFK a decent and intelligent President.  He understood the realities of life and as a Democrat,  was conservative.   Nancy Pelosi your democratic party is nothing like JFK.  Even if you studied him for several years, chances are slim you could replicate his uniqueness.
@AndyHortin18 @ambinc1 @MillerStream @conservmillen That's right!  It's Trump's White House right now and he can and does, do what he thinks is best for this country by each decision he makes.  He's a WINNER and wants no pathetic, loser babies, who are rich, around him.
@JacobAWohl @ambinc1 Let me add, you need to go to college, learn as much as possible, graduate with a degree and then continue a lifelong journey of non stop learning everyday, to be really successful.  Read about successful people like,... you guessed it, Donald Trump.  His books are great.  Tough
@ASavageNation He is going to have a life a pain, loneliness, misery and the need for expensive medications if he wants to survive.  HIV/AIDS is a horrific disease with a slow, painful, disabling demise.
@BrexitCentral @RedHotSquirrel That is/was the major difference between Trump and Obama. Obama preached doom, gloom, poverty, racial bias, Trump is Hell Yes we are winners, US is the biggest and the best, all people are great and can have it all.  Republicans versus Democrats. The message is very clear.
@sophiex_____ @Davemas14487144 These are young men with nothing but time on their hands and violence and vengeance in their hearts and minds.  Your Governments have released ticking time bombs on their people who are unprepared to handle the destruction they are beginning to feel.  Stand up and stop it now.
@brithume @PoliticalShort And in each of us is a will to live or a will to give up.  Kate needed help from family, friends and professional She must have grown tired of the struggle and Chose to give up.  We all have intense challenges,  the difference is how we choose to handle them determines our future
@V_of_Europe And they will if the owners are unable to stop them.  Will the police stop them?  That is true insanity.  They need guns, but the immigrants look like they would take them away.   What are the home owners  going do?  Wolves sent into a herd of sheep.
@Hemiheadx @bikesandsmoke @AMike4761 I totally agree.
@Newsweek He needs to shut his mouth, and Trump needs to tell all his staff to keep quiet about Kim Jong Un.  Trump is starting to build a rapport so he doesn't need bullying from them.  Kim has a very delicate ego and is overly sensitive to any attacks on him.  Take charge Trump!
@fergue_98 I like your dog.  This is mine, Kar. https://t.co/bVdaNQ4S0M
@RealOmarNavarro @Push4Contest You really need to beat Maxine, please prepare well.  It shouldn't be to difficult.  She did just have a huge crowd of 10 people at her last rally.
@Newsweek Yes Putin. I'm quite sure President Super Trump needs your help making sure the US figures out how to have a meeting.  Thanks.
@LauraLoomer @SpoilRottenPup @TwitterSupport That's unbelievable.   Report it to the police.  Scare the coward with the police investigating him/her/it.
@JackPosobiec Gee, he sounds just like Nancy Pelosi.   Let's hope the next speaker will support our President, completely.
@PhilMcCrackin44 @SpoilRottenPup @SpeakerRyan Of course he declined.  She really didnt think Ryan would speak with her?  Another case of celebrity confusion with real world reality.
@SenSanders Ok  Bernie, let's get rid of Welfare completely and no food stamps in exchange for reasonable health benefits to those in need, with proof of income.  And BTW, welfare recipients get Medicaid for themselves and children, which is free medical.
@bikesandsmoke @Hemiheadx @AMike4761 I agree.  Other bakers and flower shops have been sued and lost everything,  business, home.  When gay couples are denied, they go into overdrive to sue businesses for discrimination.  I say, cook the cake, make it terrible and give them a refund. Thus, they won't ever come back.
@bikesandsmoke @Hemiheadx @AMike4761 I think it starts with the 10 Commandments, then goes from there.
@bikesandsmoke @Hemiheadx @AMike4761 True, yes I agree.  But think about this.  It starts with the owners rejecting gay marriages, then it leads to people with extreme religions; list any.  Then owners decide they don't like what certain people wear, or their hair and makeup.   Not trying to influence, just think.
@Graeme12304557 @JacobHunt3r @KTHopkins I just read the police can't go over speed limit to chase criminals.	They risk being investigated and   losing their jobs if this happens.  Thus, they are afraid to go after them.  Nothing good can come of this.
@AMike4761 So, according to numerous Londoners,  there are No "no go zones".  I'm guessing it depends on the definition and how its applied in reality.
Is this true or not true? https://t.co/TpLUlrJGOI
@bikesandsmoke @Hemiheadx @AMike4761 I consider myself to be a Christian, but I think any and all small and large businesses,  including Muslim owned, should never decline a patron.  When you open a business , you can't pick and choose who you will serve, or discriminate.  God says hate the sin, love the sinner.
@_theRealDev_ Regardless of what you think about Trump, he did become our President and he's doing a fantastic job with this country and EVERYONE living here.  Obama is now being considered a criminal.  Great way to end his legacy.
@GiorgiaMeloni How can you stand living through that everyday?  It's like living in a third world, hostile country with no laws.  I Can't imagine even thinking of going outside or driving anywhere.  God Bless the USA.  We would call our SWAT teams and end it fast.
@trumpism_45 @ambinc1 @realDonaldTrump There is no President who has received this much support and love from the people in the United States and numerous other countries.
@PamelaGeller Say goodbye to them Jeff Bezos,  you don't need the problems.

@President1Trump @kwilli1046 @POTUS Personally I would say a big, fat, stupid pig, but that's not me!!!!
@ChelseaCes @MetroUK Not according to Douglas Murray and Robert Spencer.
@PrisonPlanet How can people live and thrive in communities where criminals have more rights than police and citizens.   It's insane police can't speed to catch criminals and are afraid for their jobs.  I see massive influxes of crime, aggressive crimes and violence  UK.  Thank God for USA.
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker's religious beliefs.  Nancy Pelosi's unhappy witb ruling, she  who attacks President Trump for not abiding by the rule of law in Muellers investigation.  You cant have it both ways Nancy, you believe in the legal system or you dont.
@AP_NFL You were not forced to be a cheerleader , you Chose it, knowing exactly how much money you would receive.  And let's get real, jumping abounding in minimal clothing will bring all types of attention.  Stop wining like little babies and blaming after the fact.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Nancy you are the wealthiest 1%.  Now your state of CA is draining residents money by attempting to suck out every dime by taxing water usage, dictating when they can shower and wash clothes, fining for overage.  Well CA, it's your own fault, you voted Democrat.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump President Trump has every right to request information pertinent to him and his administration.  There is a Public Records Request available to all Americans and he is being Transparent.
@SenSanders Wrong Bernie.  Majority of workers are young, college students working while going to school.  Life is a ladder; start at the bottom while young and work your way up.  Disney jobs aren't meant to provide for families.  Those with no skills or education receive low pay, reality.
@nickmon1112 @Welshdellb0y Unbelievable.   I hope YouTube told them to drop dead.
@chinch420 @browd14 He hates you back, miss major emotional problem.
@OnlineMagazin Nasty,  nasty, nasty and gross.
@Frankhaviland @2cleverbya3rd Are Muslim women suppose to be on Tinder?  It sounds like poke out your eyes or cut off your hands disciplinary action.
@BreitbartLondon Is anyone surprised by this?
@RepJerryNadler @NancyPelosi President Trump has never given the appearance of being above the law,  if he did, he would have put an end to Muellers investigation right at the beginning.   He is allowing the legal system due process.  Take note, we see you retweeted this Nancy Pelosi.
@AMike4761 @Bomba2H @politicalite Well I guess it will have to be all other non Islamic countries to criticize.
@OnlineMagazin Please be sure to update us on how we can view the film.  It sounds like a must see.
@veteranhank Perfectly said, and correct.
Trump is President, can do what he wants at White House.  He is made of steel.  He loves America and the flag stands for America.  If NFL brats cant respect this, 2 bad. Philly mayor: 'Trump is a fragile egomaniac and not a true patriot' https://t.co/BuCktvrpum via @MailOnline
@PhilMcCrackin44 @grizz_meister Only the Obamas know for sure, and they aren't telling anyone.
@OnlineMagazin That is so sad.  She had to give up her pretty princess dress, allowing her to smile and laugh and put on a black,  funeral sack, covering up her entire being.  She is no longer an individual but an object, and will begin to live in fear for the rest of her life.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump President Donald Trump is a King for the Americans who love this country and want the best for America.  Obama had his 8 year chance to be king and failed miserably.  Long live the king, Trump.  He is making America Great Nancy and all of your lethal verbal attacks wont stop him
@1Romans58 @kwilli1046 The tax will go to give free medical care and free college to illegal immigrants.
@thehill You enjoy embarrassing yourself and your family.  Trump tells it like it is, there's a difference.  Tough talk, for tough decisions.  That's why we voted for Trump.
@AMike4761 @Bomba2H Yes, even the Queen was not amused.  What will be the future of London?
@gr8tjude There are hundreds of young men ready to become NFL players and play football, not politics.  If this continues, get rid of problem players,  start reducing their salaries and let new players earn their money and be grateful.
@RodStryker @ambinc1 It's so much easier to look away and tell yourself the police and politicians are doing their job, I don't want to get involved.  This won't happen to me.  Unfortunately,  you must get involved.  It will continue if you don't.
@OnlineMagazin I totally agree with you.  People are sticking their heads in the sand.  The invasion starts slowly, seemingly unpretentious, then grows like a cancer.  Soon, Sharia Law will prevail and citizens will have no say in their lives.  Look at Tony Robinsons case happening now.
@Thomas1774Paine @emtee2355 I find it difficult to believe Facebook users had no concept or understanding their information was being sold and used.  Personally, I think they really dont care.
@charliekirk11 Please let the world know when CA goes bankrupt.  Free college for illegals,  free money, housing, now medical.  Where's Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Brown, vacationing in the Bahamas.
@Bomba2H @Junglebogey @AMike4761 I live in America and no way we would allow the violence happening in the UK to happen here.  Angry mobs walking the streets, destroying property.  News media does not show people the truth of what's happening to their cities.  Ask Robert Spencer or Douglas Murray.  Be Well.
@Junglebogey @Bomba2H @AMike4761 What is the reason you get so mad at me?  I really understand your love for London and I'm one person, a female by the way.  I wish I was wrong, but even the Queen made a derogatory statement about the state of refugees increase in London.  This influx is happening all over UK.
@Junglebogey @AMike4761 @Bomba2H You are wrong, there are no go zones in London.  They may appear minimal at first, and during daylight hours.  However, if traveled at night, the danger is very real.  As the push for Islamic acceptance continues in Europe, Muslim only areas will become more apparent.
@AMike4761 @Bomba2H Are you reading this Londoners,  the people who said there are No, no go zones in London?
@jihadwatchRS Sounds like the Muslims on are an attack rampage.  Keep up the great job Mr. Spencer, we need the information and the truth about Islam, the real truth.
@lucielibertad @Bomba2H I say every single dog owner get out your dog and have a dog parade.
@SavannahBelle01 @kwilli1046 So now CA residents can go outside to relieve themselves right along with their homeless neighbors.
@V_of_Europe What's the reason all we're reading about is how Islam is taking over London and no action to stop it?  What are you Londoners waiting for?  Take back your city.  Stop allowing the Islamification of your great city.
@USAHotLips @kwilli1046 @jojoh888 @KatTheHammer1 @TrumpGirlStrong @michaelbeatty3 @MAGAKrissy @Fuctupmind @carrieksada @Zola1611 @RNcat50 @ClintonMSix141 That is sickening.   What would a Conservative,  business owner and major Trump supporter say to this man?
@ASavageNation Suck out the poisonous venom.
@DrSueDVM @kwilli1046 The marching of Muslim women is one sight I hope to never see in America.   Call it what you want.
@LeBaerut Incorrect, there are only 2 sexes, male or female.
@jihadwatchRS Keep informing the world of the truth Mr. Spencer.  We need your voice and wisdom to spread the word of the dangers of Islam, the truth.  Thank you.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, you are the only person Americans are disgusted with.  You and the Obama Administration had the opportunity to work on our illegal immigration problem and you chose to do nothing.  You value illegals more than the US citizens.
@NancyPelosi That's the Law Nancy, deal with it.  Americans won't be shedding any tears because we dont believe what you say as the truth.
@OnlineMagazin @Bomba2H There will be fighting everyday.  The Muslims men dont work, they are trying to attract young people to join Islam and fight their Jihad war.  All because the Political parties brought Islam to Britain.
@V_of_Europe What a terrible way to live your life.   No longer able to enjoy the things you love doing.  Thank your Government and elected officials.
@TrumpPence45 I think Kim would jump on it but Trump learned his lesson with the Storm; didn't he?

@BreitbartNews @1dizzytexpam Reality of society today.  If we attack a race, cause, company, ideology,  opinion, or persons, we run the risk of being fired or sued.  That's why most people on Twitter have anonymous names.  Those using real names are selective in their words.  We must confuse, not vile attack
@MarkACollett @CitizenAnalyst Immigrants arriving in your cities are young, rebellious men; mostly, who refuse to assimilate and will only fight, attack and invade.  They receive free money so they won't work.  News and videos of the violence is being edited and controlled so the world cannot see the truth.
@V_of_Europe Yes, this is what I've been saying for quite a long time.  Muslims goals are to mandate Sharia Law and create Islamic cities, everywhere.
@therealroseanne @1dizzytexpam Roseanne,  producers warned you to tone down Twitter attacks and concentrate on your new sitcom.   I have no facts supporting this other than news reports.  Was it so important to make irrelevant,  adverse comments that accomplished nothing and got you and 200 people fired?
@RealitySmash @1dizzytexpam The British Police are complete cowards.   It's so much easier to arrest law abiding, non violent citizens and make an example of them than to arrest, violent,  criminal non citizens.   British police are forbidden to use violence unless absolutely necessary.
@OfficeOfMike @BlissTabitha That's why they are called Government Employees. Its challenging for them to think.  Not in their job description.
@MarkACollett @1dizzytexpam That's not politically correct,  it's a communist dictatorship.   No person in North Korea would dare question Kim Jong Un, ever.  They know the consequences.   Will this become the new normal in Britain?
@blinkerdbritain Good for Sweden. They are tired of becoming an Islamic country, controlled by Muslims, and are taking it back.  Let's turn in to see what happens.
@Newsweek This is the same person; Kim Kardashian,  who told President Trump her daughter North West,  or South East, I forgot. Was smarter than Trump.  Now she wants something from him.  One thing I know about Trump, he doesn't forget those who speak badly about him.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, please explain to the people, What exactly is a Gun Violence Restraining Order?
@NickScan92 @PrisonPlanet @KTHopkins Can you please tell everyone where that happened?  Your video was removed while I reviewed it?
@JackPosobiec The reality of life right now, all over the world, like it or not; is Liberals versus Conservatives.  Roseanne knows Hollywood,  knows it's controlled by liberals.   She knew there could be consequences for her actions yet chose to move forward and bash Valerie.  Think first.
@1Romans58 @kwilli1046 I'm predicting the eminent decline and continued loss of tourism in France, and the quality of life.   A once truly beautiful city.  Other cities will absolutely follow suit.  Maybe the citizens of France should look into relocating?
@piersmorgan OFFENSIVE!  This word gets thrown around too much.  It's our right through Freedom of Speech to say things you may not like, and I'm quite sure he wasn't thinking of you when he got a tattoo.   In America,  thank God,  we can do whatever the hell we want as long as we dont harm.
@V_of_Europe As the flood of immigrants and refugees continues to overwhelm the UK, there will be a continual decrease in tourism.  People will be too afraid to travel to the once, beautiful, and exciting cities.
@MattLynchGB @emtee2355 No one is stopping any Male or female, regardless of color from riding their bike.   The craziness has to stop.
@jimlibertarian @Push4Contest Never apologize for anything, especially if you are correct.

@AlwaysActions @mispats2u These people hate you, they will never follow your countries rules or laws.  It appears to me the Police are afraid of them; young Muslim men.  I'm guessing police can't use guns or unnecessary force to stop them, per your Politicians in charge.
@AlwaysActions @mispats2u France, That is unbelievable.  What do these Muslims want, to cause havoc and chaos?  Why did it take police so long to get there?  Muslims will never Assimilate.  Your leaders thinking this will happen are putting all of your lives at risk.
@V_of_Europe @Wild_Willdy What are Germans hoping to accomplish with the March?  In America,  businesses and or Government will usually back down and try to appease the marchers request.  Do you think Islamic Muslims will allow all the control they obtained to be released?

@PamelaGeller @emtee2355 The Word Islam means Submission.  It is the mission of Islam to invade.  There is no assimilation.   Our Governmental leaders forget this fact.  They think they can change Muslims, who live, breathe and die for every word of the Koran.
@realDonaldTrump @Geoclewis Yes!  This is the Government.  Never underestimate what public servants in power are capable of.

@TomiLahren @Geoclewis That's easy to say but hard to live.  We each live by a Philosophy in life which guides and directs our actions and decisions.   What actions/belief do Iiberals live by?  What are they willing to sacrifice and fight,  possibly even die for?   I have no idea.
@JacobAWohl @godisgood1961 I love it.  Trump is the best at negotiating.   You have to be willing to walk away, no matter how badly you want something.   "IF YOU WANT THE BEST, YOU HAVE TO BE THE BEST"., Donald J. Trump.
@GartrellLinda @talk4truth They are bowing down to worship a false prophet,  Mohammed.   Parents must put an end to this now.  Do you really want your children turning their backs on Jesus and the Bible to worship and praise Allah and become a Muslim?
@CitizenAnalyst Thank God President Trump is working hard to prevent this from happening in US.  Paris, London and others, it is only going to get worse.  The leftist have given homeless, refugees more rights than the citizens of Paris.  Honestly,  what can you do to change the demise?
@NancyPelosi We believe Trump and we believe the FBI conspired with Obama and Clinton to make sure Trump didnt become President.  There is nothing you or any other Democratic Liberal can do to change our minds.   The Conservative Americans have spoken and will Fight for Trump always.
@NancyPelosi After reading this Nancy,  you sound just like Hillary Clinton.   It's the same old meaningless liberal status quo that got Obama elected. There is absolutely nothing new.  You are so out of touch with Americans today.  After 14 months,  Trump is right on track, best President.
@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan He was busy helping President Trump resolve problems created by the Democratic Party.
@FILFUNGI @MarkACollett OMG!  How can parents allow this?  Can you see what is happening now in Sweden, Norway, Germany and many other UK areas?   Instead of resisting Islam and the Muslim revolution,  people are accepting this religion in a "If you can't beat them,  join them" mentality.
@MEL2AUSA @kwilli1046 @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should say your from Canada,  that way you dont need to mention our wonderful President Trump whatsoever.   We will all appreciate that.
@ViKt510 That is so beautiful.   I'm going to WNC mountains for a week and will take tons of pictures hiking on trails.   My dog chases armadillos and any creature that runs.
@LauraLoomer @ambinc1 You tell her.   No self control, poor students.
@EricVonFluger @SusanStormXO @gbroh10 There's always exceptions.  In Florida,  the average grade for teacher performance is C.  They state their time is spent dealing with unruly students.  These are in lower middle class areas.  A teacher cant put one finger on a student, it's a crime.  I'm talking bout K thru 12th.
Nancy Pelosi is bellowing the same messages given by President Trump	She is trying to manipulate, and persuade all into thinking she has these original ideas, no way.  Democrats Steal Trump’s Message, Now Claim They Will ‘Drain The Swamp’ https://t.co/YwrGRWIqAP via @dailycaller

@pahubb43 @emtee2355 The parents must take the majority of responsibility for their sons actions.  They allowed him to receive and keep a victim Mentality,  it didn't happen overnight.   Now they must be considering the possibility that he could cause them bodily harm.  Kick your children out at 18yr

@seanhannity American Citizens of CA, you are no longer relevant, please pack your bags and leave now.  Put the keys to your homes under the mats so the illegals can move on in.  Be sure to leave food in the refrigerator and extra cash on the counter.  Thanks for your patronage.  Nancy Pelosi
@NancyPelosi What are the tools they need Nancy?  You must be specific,  no blatant generalizations.  What are the tools teachers and children need to succeed and what Path will improve the education system?
Higher Ground Productions:  Now the superior Obamas decided to start their own production co., we know how experienced they are with television, movies, documentaries and Reality Shows.  They are so Jealous of Trump and want to try and compete with him.   Let's watch them fail.
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Nancy, you are correct, teachers absolutely must have pay increases.  They are asked to teach unruly students and now, even face death.  Teachers are the most important instruments for the welfare of our children's future.  Along with the Police and Firefighters, step up and pay.
@President1Trump @kwilli1046 @FBI It's about time.   Fight fire with fire.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, Republicans cant wait to see your "A Better Deal Plan". By Democrats who in the last 8 years have brought better, higher paying jobs to America??? We lost jobs to India.  A Ford plant moved to Mexico.  We expect  your plan to mimic identically, President Trumps plans.
As the former President and first lady, the well educated Obamas have an opportunity with Netflix to reach out and create empowering, educational media to help the black and minority communities.   Let's all Express our opinions and strongly suggest this it what they do.
@ViKt510 That is so cool.  BM are so brave and fearless.   Keep the pictures coming.
@NancyPelosi A Culture of Corruption in Trump's Administration? I hope you have immense proof of this. He's been in office one year.  Trump has already worked harder and accomplished more than Obama did in 8 years.  Your lies and baseless attacks on Trump are getting really old, like you.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, What exactly are you doing for a Better Deal.  What?  What you are trying to say. You have no plan, no specifics, nothing solid like President Trump.   You have generalized, meaningless Innuendos.  You may as well be saying, "I'm going to make all of you a Billionaire ".
@NancyPelosi You mean a better Deal for Our Democrats.  Trump has No Pay to Play Culture in Washington DC.
@hzahaley @StrongShepherd_ Quoted from the Old Testament: "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable " LEV 18:22.  God loves man but hates sin.  God does Not make mistakes.
@MarieMurcelle1 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump When you learn how to spell and Nancy can fly.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, how dare you say these lies about Trump and his administration?  He hasn't been President long enough.  He spends much of his time trying to vindicate himself from Democrats lies and Muellers witch hunt.  You are talking about yourself and the democratic party, Nancy.
God does not make any person Gay.  The Bible tells us that, specifically.	Falsehood of the Pope.### Pope Francis tells gay man: 'God made you like that' https://t.co/boJDapG58b
@JohnBrennan Really, and what is so self serving about wanting to know the truth of the extent of corruption in the Government.   What is so self serving about wanting to vindicate himself of these false accusations and continual lies spread by the democratic party?  He's the President. YES!
@FILFUNGI @preetts05 @PeterSweden7 So, so true.  People refuse to believe this, liberals of course.  So afraid to be prejudiced, biased or politically incorrect.
@preetts05 @PeterSweden7 @FILFUNGI I agree with you.  I had strong words with Londoners who deny no go zones and Muslims wanting Sharia Law.  I'm continually learning about what's happening in these countries, just to be aware.  It may be too late by the time they decide to stop the insanity.
@preetts05 @PeterSweden7 @FILFUNGI You are so absolutely correct.  The UK especially is allowing Muslim societies to take precedence over Germany,  Britain, London,  Norway.  Thanks for  your input.
@Mike_Press19 @ambinc1 Has anyone noticed Black Lives Matter hasn't been in the news lately?
@Jillibean557 @Grizzle_Meister You said that perfectly and you are correct, it's that simple.
@DEB_PolkaDot @Cat_Kapow @ChinaDailyUSA I love my doggy.  I can't look or read about animal torture.   My thoughts were why aren't there terrorists problems in China like many other parts of world.  No refugee news.  Does China edit the news deleting much of the negative. https://t.co/LUarbjfx91
@DEB_PolkaDot @Cat_Kapow @ChinaDailyUSA Thanks for letting me know.  I would never want to see or experience something like that.
@Newsweek I love this picture.  Obama thinks he is interesting and Trump is thinking, is he still talking, why is he talking, wheres Melania,  what time is it?  Wheres my plane, I need to go Twitter.
This is why Americans love Trump and why liberals hate him.  Trump has made every past President look unaccomplished.  IE; Obama. US and China halt imposing import tariffs - BBC News https://t.co/bWq8wwigAd
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, it's already been proven there is No Russian Collusion with Trump.  You need to keep up on current events.  You leading the Liberals is a complete demise of freedom and love we have for this country.  Fortunately,  no one cares about anything you say anymore.  Bye, bye.
@PeterSweden7 @FILFUNGI Good luck Sweden.   You have allowed the slow aggressive takeover of your country by Islam/Muslims and now it's a major uphill battle.  Let us all learn a lesson from other countries mistakes in allowing one religion to rule and promote their beliefs only and fight for them.
@ChinaDailyUSA Why dont we see violence, fighting, blood shed in China.  We see these people doing amazing things.  I'm sure they have their share of crime, maybe the government controls what the world sees????
@Jamierodr10 @Geoclewis New Yorkers, now is the time to step up and stop the insanity.   If you allow the school or any schools to continue this behavior,  it will only get worse.  Liberals will keep pushing, they will never stop.
@MarkDice @Geoclewis Why does it even matter to Kathy anymore?  She's barely working so tons of free time on her hands.  She just continues to blame Trump and the mean world for her problems.
@RealJamesWoods @emtee2355 No way.  Men and women's interactions aren't always Nice.  Both sexes need to know how to handle themselves independent of getting their bosses involved.  That is a part of real life.  If it gets to the point where bosses have to intervene, then so be it.  Stop being babies.
@TracyMFinch @Grizzle_Meister President Trump is doing everything in his power to make sure this Never happens to our America.  We dont want it here and we don't  care what liberals or any other country thinks.  They are the ones suffering and it will only get worse.
@President1Trump @kwilli1046 Let's find out.  White college students, have a white only day.  It's only fair.  Maybe it will stop the insanity of this college.  Or, whites, you can all leave and give your hard earned money to another better deserving college/university.
@johnlegend These gang members only have other members as their families.   They don't know or understand the world of hardworking,  normal people.  I strongly recommend you research this Murderous Gang M 13 before you make anymore comments.  There is no type of verbal pain they understand.
@DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier No, animals in the wild kill to eat and survive.   Domestic animals are spoiled and loving and do no harm.  MS 13 gangs are demonic monsters.   They kill for the pleasure of killing only.
@w_terrence @Geoclewis They look like monsters or demon zombies from the living dead.  They are not human beings.

@Newsweek First, get this straight.   Bill Gates made this remark; thus it is only heresy and allegations.   Again, the  news reports a one sided Argument and doesnt ask Trump.   Trump is highly educated so its extremely doubtful he asked this question.   They are coming out of woodwork.
@kwilli1046 Every single person on here makes a difference.   I am continually pleasantly surprised at the super intelligence of the Conservatives and what they are saying.  It truly gives me hope in the future and mankind.   Please twitterers,  never stop.  You are important.
@kwilli1046 It is just too painful to watch MW open her mouth.  She is an embarrassment to the human race.
@Grizzle_Meister Mr. Biden, you are no longer relevant,  please remove yourself from Twitter.  Americans are not interested in what you have to say.  You had your turn.
@hockman200 @realDonaldTrump You really need to learn how to listen and hear correct information.   Trump didnt say that.  He said MS 13 Animals.  You look and appear extremely ignorant and confused.

@KatTheHammer1 @USAHotLips @alozras411 @DineshDSouza @ClintonMSix141 @Zola1611 @IvanTrumpovic1 I totally agree. Shootings keep happening and liberal school teachers dont see warning signs. They need training on what to look.  Mega security at doors, check students for guns and weapons.   Stop blaming the NRA. You would think teachers and students would be more aware now.
@piersmorgan You are wrong PMorgan.  The NRA has nothing to do with this.  Americans have owned guns for over 200 years, long before NRA.  We aren't immune to  the  killing of innocent children.   We are trying to understand and prevent this violence from continuing.  Parents step in now.
@RyanAFournier This is about mad, young, people , mostly men, who are glamorizing killing multiple people.  They are angry at the world, mad about an insignificant situation and they want revenge.   They need family, parents, schools, churches and the community helping them understand life.
@piersmorgan GOD BLESS AMERICA AND THE 2ND AMENDMENT.
@piersmorgan You don't have to worry about America and our alleged gun issues.  The UK should be worried about the overflow of Muslims trying to create Sharia Law.  You still have violence and murders in your cities.  This is a fact of life.  Where are the parents of these troubled youths.
@BackTheCops I love this picture.  I hope you get well fast officer and you 2 are back to work after a good vacation.  You deserve it.
The question should be, "How to these kids/people keep getting into the school building"?  I don't hear this discussed.  Schools need secure doors and security systems to stop the killers from entering schools.  Florida is hiring more resource officers but secure buildings ??????
@piersmorgan We believe in Freedom and  the Right to Bear Arms.  A gun can be purchased illegally on the street if you have the money.  Guns dont kill people, people kill people.  We will never give up our gun rights, USA.
@1Romans58 @Geoclewis I would be livid and demand the teacher be removed.  Or even better, remove my child.  It's worth it to send your child to private school even if you have to live frugally for awhile.  And what is a "Submission to Allah" exactly?
@Lucyallocca2 @DLoesch Lucy, calling  people names doesnt resolve any issues or problems you have.  It only makes you appear ignorant and uneducated.   In America, we believe in Freedom and a Right to bear arms.  It's that simple and it will never change.  You may want to try a new hairstyle or makeup
@NancyPelosi And exactly what action should Congress take Nancy?  Please tell us, we want to hear from you.
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Nancy, is there anything you wont blame on Trump?  He's been in office 14 months.  Obama was President for 8 years.  He did all the damage.  Trump has to clean up his mess and then put his good works into play.  He's just one man being attacked by 1000s of you liberals.
@NancyPelosi And having you as their role model, we know the future is in good hands.😟😭☹🤯😰😩🤮💩👽 Let's all pray the future generation is better, stronger,  wiser than us and pray they use Trump as a role model.

@Newsweek What is that suppose to mean exactly?  Be honest.   Men look at every female within eye range.   Trump is a ladies man,  this cant be denied.  So Gates daughter is a female and beyond wealthy.   These are 2 of Trump's favorite things.  Your average, typical man, money, sex, and ?
@ClintonMSix141 @NightSKY4409 And let's all remember Hillary's legal troubles began as Bill's wife when he was Governor, then as the first lady, then Secretary of State and finally Senator.   Obama learned all the sly tactics and illegal maneuvers from HC.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @RepRaskin Nancy, this just doesn't work for you anymore.   You have said the exact same CV kmment each week and it's now been proven and stated their is no Russian conspiracy and Trump cannot be indicted. Mueller is old yesterday's news and this witch hunt will be ending very soon.
@ChinaDailyUSA They are boxing.
@President1Trump @kwilli1046 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump OMG!  Did you see the pictures of murdered MS 13 victims?  One guy had knives stuck in every part of his body.  It was the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  I wish I didn't look.  Nancy has no audience and is reaching out to whomever will listen to her pitiful begging.
@4YrsToday @Grizzle_Meister The main reason, for me is his infidelity.   He has 5 children.  Why bother getting married, having children and then destroy their worlds by cheating on your wife, thus divorcing.   It's a no win situation.
@NancyPelosi Here's Nancy again stating/generalizing the LGBTQ community is being hated on.  So where is this happening now, today Nancy?  There's been nothing in the news.  Can you pinpoint a location so we know where all these horrible haters are stationed?  Thanks Nancy!😜🤪🤓😳🤡🤠
@EricVonFluger @SusanStormXO @gbroh10 As a civil servant I must inform you how wrong you are.  Only the very top directors make decent money.  Most public employees make very little and work hard.  Think about your daily life and what you use by a government employee.   Roads, taxes, utilities,  police, military.
@SusanStormXO @kwilli1046 As a Government employee,  I pay a % of each pay check into my pension.  The money is then invested by other Government employees.   So most of the time, we lose money.  Government employees are not paid as well as the private sector,  so we get perks to compensate for the loss.
@Talkmaster No Neal, not only does the Government want them to allow Syrian refugees to use their vacant rooms. They want their vacation homes.  That's only the beginning.
@IvanTrumpovic1 @Grizzle_Meister Although I think Stormy wears that look the majority of the time.  In her line of work, smiles don't last long.
@kwilli1046 We don't hear enough from CA citizens; both parties.   Please tell us the truth, what do you think about your Sanctuary cities and obscene homelessness with continued illegal immigrants moving into the US.  We really want to hear from you.
The Irish people,  your Government is on verge of mandating you allow Syrian refugees to live in your empty rooms and your vacation homes.  What's next? Mandatory allowances,  driving privileges,  food, clothes, child care, all paid for by you.  Please share your thoughts.
Young women what R U hoping to accomplish by standing topless in a crowd (not US) breast feeding your child?  As a woman,  you will be a target to those wanting to do bodily harm.  Use your mind and think clearly.   This is not empowerment.
@piersmorgan Mental health issues and heart surgery have no correlation.  Anxiety is a normal part of living in this world.  Thomas has a history of heart problems so its unfair to Judge his daughter who is about to become a Princess.  A grown man has responsibility to ensure his own health.

@Newsweek The man loves animals,  we have to give him credit for that.
@MichaelAvenatti @patriotnanaa It's not that we believe what you are saying is true, it's that Trump supporters believe in freedom of speech.  That means freedom to all people.  In the end, a decision will be made as to whether the accusations are true or false.
@AndrewPollackFL @RyanAFournier That's why he hid, he wanted to make sure he received the Pension and wasn't going to risk getting hurt.  That is reality.  Its extremely difficult to understand why things happen as they do but Americas heart goes out to you and everyone adversely affected by that nightmare.
@mike_Zollo @Geoclewis Gee, just like being back in junior high.  That is crazy.  Be a good boy now.
@TuckerCarlson Rush Limbaugh said it clearly, Mueller will not stop until someone is indicted.   He will take as long as he wants, he gets paid regardless.
@missmiafaith Studies are not reliable because a. they can be swayed, b. people taking the survey's can and will say what they want,  regardless if it's true or not.  C. the researchers can use a group of 50 people, any age and say its representative of the population, which is not true.
@ASavageNation This is nothing new.  Cowboys and Indians fought violently in movies.   Violence sells as does sex.  The only thing we can do is don't go see the movies.
When Clinton was Governor of Arkansas, the Clintons were involved with Whitewater and the FBI helped cover up the crimes committed?  Once President,  Hillary had many illegal financial ongoings.  So what's happening with Trump is nothing new.  FBI has always been pro democrats.
@carsdotcom Camaro yeah baby!
@NancyPelosi @SenatorReid @HopkinsMedicine What about Mrs. Trump?  You could show some respect for the Presidents wife who just had surgery.   She is a wonderful woman and unfortunately she's never said one bad thing about you.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Who are the Democrats helping exactly?  Name one specific item the Democrats are doing to grow Anericans paychecks, just one.   Bringing in illegal immigrants only decreases our paychecks because we pay for the benefits they receive.   Nancy next time try not to generalize.

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump How exactly did Trump break a promise, what promise?  You continue blatant nonsense which is made up of spewing hatred and lies pointing towards our President.  Trump keeps his promises.   Just shut up and stop your lies, no one hears you anymore.  You are history.

Kim Kardashian wants to get involved in Politics.  Apparently taking off her clothes isn't giving her much attention these days.  She did say and I quote. "My daughter North West is smarter than Trump".  She continues to try to be relevant in a world where she has no talent.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, You are truly hypocritical.   Several days ago you said corporations and businesses aren't paying enough taxes.  Now this.  Your thinking is indecisive just like the wind, all over the place.  Typical liberal mindset.  Think before you speak.
@NancyPelosi We can't wait to see and hear you publicly thank President Trump for making their release happen.   Trump 2020
@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump How long will Americans have to wait before you retire from office,  And how long will you continue to repeat yourself saying the same old boring lie that Trump is not following the Rule of Law.  You need to protect the American people by stopping illegal immigration.
@Talkmaster Go on PornHub and put her name in.  She shows up with men so gross its unimaginable.   I find it challenging to believe Trump had this overwhelming desire to do Stormy.  Yes, in 2006 she was younger and prettier,  but she still did what she does.
@RepStevenSmith @Geoclewis That is disgusting.   This picture has never been shown in the media.  It sums up Obama and his Presidential legacy perfectly.
@Red1Echo @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall No I understood your post.  I was just stating another person called me racist and a white supremacists because I like Trump and I discussed some of things you said because I agree with you.  Crazy.  Cant rationalize w/ a liberal.  Even with facts n statistics.
@Shakestweetz @prisonculture You are truly filled with hatred and envy which permeates every inch of your rather large physique.   There are make up and exercise tutorials available for free on YouTube.

@Newsweek I would have thanked him and set it on the porch.  Sending a strong message of elitism.   His actions say it all; he doesnt like Kushner and probably not Trump.
@Red1Echo @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall So apparently I'm a racist and white supremacists for explaining the fact there is more black on black crime in cities like Chicago than white on white.  And that Muslims are changing the UK and its probably not long before Sharia Law is implemented.   We just cant win can we?
Reality of Life: I cannot force you to like, think, believe, or act how I what. If I'm upset or Offended because you don't; it's my problem, not yours.  This is what we call Freedom. Stop trying to force people to do what You Think they should, then call them racist; etc., if not
@RealJamesWoods Well,  you will find the exact same circumstances in LA and San Francisco.   Head to the midwest or north and south.  We dont have this kind of mess; at least not in Jacksonville, Florida.
Donald Trump becoming President has inspired millions of people, who otherwise would not have, to become interested in politics. This has threatened liberals so much they are using every scare tactic imaginable to try and stop it. 🏋️‍♀️🌎🌌🇺🇸

@PhilMcCrackin44 @GrizzleMeister He needs to create the center in the middle of the new homeless shelter directly in line with Billionaires row.  Just think of the joy the wealthiest americans can experience watching drug users stumble in and out of drug centers and homeless shelters.  Welcome to New York.
@President1Trump There are plenty of empty, homes for sale at dirt cheap prices all along border cities.  Go buy one and  celebrate the invasion and ask an illegal and their family to dinner.  It's the Democratic thing to do.
@NancyPelosi Economists 101:  Corporations create jobs,  hire people to work at those jobs; ie, Amazon.  Small business owners create jobs albeit at a lower rate.  When is the last time a lower income individual created a job?  All you and other liberals know how to do is attack, criticize.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump YOU ARE THE RACIST.  YOU ARE BIASED AND PREJUDICED BECAUSE I LOVE AMERICA AND THE PRESIDENT WHO WANTS TO KEEP IT SAFE.   You are not from US so you cant possibly understand.  Your words are frivolous and meaningless.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump Congratulations!  Your probably happy you left.  And, just because I love our President doesnt make me a racist.  But it does make you a person who generalized all people who like Trump.  There are millions of us.  Cheerio ole boy!
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump Look at Chicago.  Your talking about scenarios happening sporadically in UK.   There are blacks killing blacks everyday, all day long in major cities.  These are statistically factual.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump You are so misinformed.   Your wrong about  Muslims.  Read about what the Muslim Mayor of London is now doing.  I'm very well read.  Dont worry, you will grow up one day and understand.   There are very few white supremacists US.   More black on black crime than WS.  Facts.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump I forgot Norway and London sorry.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump Your racist for attacking Trump.  I said Muslims because they're taking over Europe. Soon it will become an Islamic country.  Trump is trying to prevent our country from losing its freedoms.  Islam has Sharia Law and your life will be over.  Think about it.  I'm stating facts.
@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump Oh yes, I'm a major racist and anything else you want to call me.  That's all liberals have; the ability to call people names.  All mouth and no action.😜🤐🤡🤢💩

@fishboy147 @realDonaldTrump In your dreams.   Trump will never resign and will be the President again in 2020.  He is the best President this nation has ever seen.   Liberals need to go to Berlin or Sweden where they are nice to all the Muslims and leftist.  Vonvoage.

@GrizzleMeister President Trump didn't even go to mother Bush's funeral, why would he go to McCains?  You always know who Trump respects; just watch his actions, they say it all.
@OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @ChicagosMayor @realDonaldTrump I recall Trump telling the Mayor he was prepared to help Chicago  by bringing in extra poliving; the Mayor declined his help by saying no, we don't need it.
@thebradfordfile @kwilli1046 @tedlieu The point is; Trump saw the Storm in 2006 and paid in 2016 before he became President.   It is irrelevant to his position in office.  He's a grown man and can do what he wants. Stormy  never adversely affected his abilities to do his job.  Clinton and JFK, were Presidents/fun.
@mikandynothem @GrizzleMeister @SenJohnMcCain @codeofvets @Corrynmb @LeahR77 @Hoosiers1986 @DrMartyFox @KatTheHammer1 @RightWingAngel @hidehunt1 @AMErikaNGIRLBOT That is truly a beautiful statement and worthy of praise from everyone who reads it.  McCain is a bitter old man who's time on earth is coming to an end.  He should be celebrating the beautiful gift of life he received and the opportunities he had to better this world.
@GrizzleMeister One would think with her Ivey League education she could speak like she was an educated person.  I'm quite sure "y'all" isnt in Websters Dictionary.
@DanielKnightPL @kwilli1046 @politixlive Does McCain actually believe President Trump cares about being invited?  That is called delusional thinking.  If invited, he wouldnt show up.  He has more important work to do.

@kwilli1046 That's exactly right and his library will be built there.   I'm sure it wont be in the bad, criminal part of town.  Trump told the Chicago Mayor he wanted to help with all the violence and the Mayor said "No Thanks".

President Trump:  What  if you changed the Public Assistance Program to allow only US citizens the rights to receive welfare, food stamps and Medicaid?  Would this discourage Illegal immigrants from coming into this country?  Absolutely nothing free for them.  Lets find out.
@tjbrowndiver @Red1Echo @1776Stonewall Very true.  I do agree.
@Red1Echo @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall History dictates that leaders, Al Sharpton, Jessee Jackson, Obama, Maxine Waters, continued to preach hate and racism.  Police are biased, wealthy should give to the poor.  Did you ever hear Obama try to uplift his race and motivate them to be successful?  He preached denial.
@tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall The Poor cannot help anyone.  I challenge successful black Americans to go into poor black schools/ and do all they can to help empower black youths.  Children need to hear about success, a starting point that says; stay in school, you can be successful.  Help buy needed supplies
@Red1Echo @1776Stonewall The news and headlines predicted everyday H. Clinton was going to win and they were wrong.   I believe people are changing because of Trumps updates about fake news.   This election and Presidency has done more to positively change the country and future than any other b4 him.

@MrsGreenjeans3 @tjbrowndiver @SrPatriot @1776Stonewall I don't even know what White Spanning is.  If anything I'm People Spanning.  We all have prejudices, I'm no exception.  I have many wonderful, highly exceptional black friends.  Even said on this topic.
@Thomas1774Paine @talk4truth Children have been bullied since they started going into schools and the classroom.  Its nothing new.  Teach your children how to overcome bullying instead of becoming a victim.
@Thomas1774Paine @talk4truth This will helped to make Barron a strong, tough competitor just like his dad.  And maybe even a future President.
As a black man, Obama could have empowered so many.  He chose to empower racial conflict, hatred for police and encouraged a rebellion attitude of whites vs blacks.  Now we have to try again to erase this message because we it's wrong. wrong.
@MrsGreenjeans3 @SrPatriot @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall What's the reason you would even ask that question?  As a Psychologist I have worked with many different races, ages, illnesses and problems.  I'm saying don't judge in your Perception of a person until you have the facts.   It's about our future.  We should want all races to win
@SrPatriot @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall Judging; Have you been an abused woman lately?  They hate it and want to get out.  If children and marriage involved, it's more complicated.  Easiest behavior in the world is to believe our perception of a person and criticize them, stay open minded.
@PeterPuma62 @tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall We must at least try to keep a neutral, non judgemental attitude and help those who Want and Work to better themselves.  False news shows us blacks being attacked but look at Atlanta for example, top black professionals in law, medicine, politics, etc.
@tjbrowndiver @1776Stonewall That's true, I agree. I also see thousands of young people out in the streets fighting for their voices to be heard.   They want what's right and a great future.  More young  black people are going to college, are making a positive  difference and we as a society must encourage.
@1Romans58 @GrizzleMeister @politico It's time for Trump to let his dogs loose and take back his power as President.  He needs to fight and win and take Mueller and his cronies out.
@1776Stonewall I disagree. This is the 20th century and most older blacks vote Democrat because that's what they believe.  If your 10 years plus, you have the internet and more information and education available to you then any other time in history.  Young adults have choices.
@GrizzleMeister Obesity is real.  Help your communities by keeping children in school, learn job skills instead of gang skills.  You perpetrate hate instead of love by not having any ideas to help better people's lives.   Stop talking and start helping by doing what you can now.
@MEL2AUSA @GrizzleMeister I love it Maga.  No where else in the world do you have the Freedom to go as anywhere, start a business, where clothes or not, smoke pot in public or not.

@thecjpearson @GrizzleMeister Then as a strong, successful, educated black man; use your voice to help other black Americans understand politics and the process of government.   So many successful, black Americans and how many are trying to reach out and help teach and make all blacks exceptional.
@mitchellvii Its not weird, it's well planned.   Democrats want to make liberal voters believe in  and want socialism so there will be no need to work hard and obtain wealth.  The government will take care of them.  This creates a victim Mentality and all people will be blamed.
@RealJamesWoods @GrizzleMeister Mueller and Rosenstein think they are more powerful than our President and can thus; do as they please.  Trump needs to do all he can to end this investigation now.  Then end both careers.  This has spread like a cancer almost destroying Republicans support of our President.

@realDonaldTrump We understand President Trump.   Often times its better to not put information in writing with the possibility of it coming back to haunt you.  Again, if nothing was written; Stormys accusations would be here say only.  Your word against hers.  No one takes accusations seriously
@Redhead4645 @kwilli1046 What have we learned from Trumps Stormy experience.   Never ever have your attorney put anything in writing.  If there was no non disclosure letter, using Trump letterhead; this would be a matter of heresay.  Trump vs Stormy.

@realDonaldTrump President Trump:  In your books you state ; focus on the solution not the problem.  Americans are with you 100%.  Spend money  hiring the best, experienced attorneys you can find.  You must destroy Mueller and his cronies.   You also write; hit them as hard as u  can.  Win win.
Talk is so cheap.  We hear from many leaders, most are attorneys;  they say he should go to jail, she is a criminal, etc.  Stop talking and take action.  We need an end to Muellers investigation now.  Then Tump needs to release/fire him and all others involved in this attack.

@jjordancox @RyanAFournier Lets all predict this investigation will conclude into the end of 2019, right before elections for a new president in 2020.

@gr8tjude @GrizzleMeister Newsflash Ms. M. Waters.  The Republicans will never move to impeach Trump because the Americans love Trump.  It would be voter suicide for them to even attempt an impeachment.   We love Trump.  Trump 2020!
@Dawn_DeMore1 @kwilli1046 President Trump needs to minimally answer Muellers questions as advised by his attorney and then put this to rest.  It has taken so much of the Presidents time and energy.  He must be able to focus on what America needs and this investigation is a major distraction.   End it now.
@therealroseanne @MGMNatlHarbor @RoseanneOnABC Your hair looks so good long.  You look much younger.
@BasedMonitored Londoners you better get ready.  You will no longer have rights you once had.  You will be forced to accept Islam and convert to the  Muslim religion. Its already happening in Sweden.   Your leaders, London Mayor,  hid his agenda and you are finally seeing it unfold.
@joelpollak They want a free ride and they know exactly where to go; here in the US.  They are being coached by American civil liberties groups paying to bring them into this country.   Stop authorizing Welfare and Foodstamps to illegals and it will reduce the rate they enter the US.
@Newsweek What's the reason Newsweek needs to publish this?  These Palestinian people are so clueless and our Jewish people deserve better treatment.   There is no nationality of mankind deserving  enough to go through what Jews went through in the Holocaust.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump: You are wiser than those politicians, you can out think them and beat them at their own game.  Remember, this is how government officials/employees have spent their entire careers.  They attack others to take attention off of themselves.  Kick butt and Win.
Someone should have stood up and walked over to relieve Ms. Wolf of her place at the podium.  No one should have sat there and listen to her speak.  She is cruel and a cowardly bully.  She fully represents liberal America.

Many said they felt pressured into it by the responsible Male, didnt realize the heavy toll,  society said its ok
We should be thanking nasty, negative liberals for their continued barrage of attacks on Trump.  This brings only adverse attention to them and forces voters to rethink their options.  That's us if you are a Democrat.

@Euan_MacDonald Great news, your Mayor banned free speech on social media because muslims are offended.   No more Twitter?  Great place to live.
@Trubshawe1 Great news, your Mayor banned free speech on social media because muslims are offended.  Does that mean No more Twitter for you?

@MaryCarnahan2 @Newsweek Why ask?  It's none of your business.   Wealthy people need tax write offs so they dont have to pay 50% of their income to the government.   Thousands of people own HUD housing.  His management team does the work.
@Newsweek And, what's your point.  They didn't pair their rent.  The courts at times said with the tenants so in order to be evicted, they were low lifes I'm sure.
@Ashby_Time I can assure you, this is how I speal; always.  I do have an excellent education and my job entails communicating with the public in a professional manner.  Thus, I work hard on these skills.  I have been on television several times so I have to know what I'm talking about.
@Ashby_Time I'm sure it's only the wealthy people speaking this way.  London is so expensive the average person cannot buy real estate.  And you have no wealth.  In America, even lower, middle class families/people can buy a house and a car.
@KateOsborne1806 I'm beginning to understand why you all hate Trump so much.  You want to stay under the control of your Government.   Stay victims, be taken care of.   You know you can never be as rich and successful as the average American.  Trump reinforces this message and you hate it. https://t.co/ttJDaBefQh
@KateOsborne1806 What can a poor person do to help themself or anyone in society.  And who wants to be poor?  No American.   The wealthy own and control the real estate market in London and if you're poor, you live in a shack.   We have have experiences.  Try to buy a house with that.  Good luck

@Euan_MacDonald The press reports fake news here in America.  He never described Nazis as fine.   Please show me proof.  Every President that has been and will be has lied and will lie.  He admires strong leadership.  He is not a perfect person, nor was Obama.   America is becoming great again.
@Sanspareille His father built homes in Brooklyn.   He became a Billionaire by hard work.  So he is far from dumb.  You only give leftist generalization you heard in a low life bar.  You know absolutely no facts about Trump or his family.  To me, America is the only place in world.
@Sanspareille I read your profile, you hate Trump because he's rich.  You think he's an elitist and the people who voted him into office are weathly, white people.
@talk4truth OMG!  I cant believe this.  The extreme ignorance of the left and their agenda of destruction for our children and our country is intolerable.   Make this stop.  Remove your innocent children now before it's too late.
@Sanspareille We love Trump because he is a strong leader and tells it like it is.  Only leftist liberals dislike him because they cant control him .  He doesn't do what You think he should, thus you dislike him.   He believes in freedom and you are mistaken.  He is both admired and hated
@Euan_MacDonald He first and foremost is a businessman.   He lives Capitalism.  He does not promote fascism.   That is a matter of opinion.  He is a strong man and speaks his mind.   Tough love and people aren't use to hearing a leader speak this way.  Only nicely, politically correct words.

@RayVonPeeps @MetroUK Is that a compliment?
@shemur23 That's deep.  You have no real argument do you?  The easiest thing in the world is to attack another person.  Judge them without any facts.  My advice; start with Trumps first book and then read them all.  Maybe then you will understand who he really is.
I want to thank you all for your comments and opinions.   It's very apparent you are passionate about your city.   However, the fact remains, there are happenings all over each city in the world where we would be shocked to find out truths .
@_AreWeAwake That's not specific.  What are the specific issues/reasons you hate him?  If you wish to share, I would love to know.
@SophieEwanR @MetroUK If it irritates you and others so much, why not advertise what you believe to be the truth?  I haven't read any positives stating "There are no Sharia Law No Go Zones".
OK:  My original question, What is the specific reason(s) the Mayor of London doesnt want Donald Trump to visit?  Any takers?
@Arsenal_GDM @DanKaszeta German thank you.
@DanKaszeta @EdShorter Dan I just read your article.   I understand you love your city and I'm sure there's much more to your defending then I or others know.  So let's just leave it at that.  I dont have to live in London or any place I choose not to.

@DanKaszeta Dont dwell on it.  Its not really important.   What the reasons the Mayor is so concerned about My President Trump coming to his city if London?

@NancyPelosi With all of your power, is there nothing you can do to help resolve this problem.  What good are our politicians if all they can do is complain and fix nothing.  Talk is cheap.

This is just one of them.  There have been mass shootings throughout time.  Color, race , sex  are irrelevant .  Thank God you were never my teacher.
@NancyPelosi It takes money to revitalize.  We have to reinvest in the children already living in America.  Low income families with children need help with future opportunities  by providing education and training.  Our children, not other countries children.  Poor cannot help poor.
@NancyPelosi You never talk about or have talked about American anything.  Trump is winning by putting Americans first so your jumping on his band wagon as a final attempt to Pray Democrats will win.  You only care about illegal immigrants and their children.
@NancyPelosi Vague generalizations coming from a Democrat mean nothing to reality based statistic relying Republicans.   Making up numbers with no substantive proof is worthless mumbling.
@NancyPelosi Yeah right!  That will happen, Never!
@NancyPelosi This statement makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.   We want free internet and No government or tech companies control.  Trump will destroy Obama's Net neutrality.
@NancyPelosi What in the hell does fair mean? From you it means take from the hard working Americans and give to illegals to make sure their lives are easy.   Take from families trying to get ahead and put their children through College.  We dont want fair.  We want what's legal.  Not illegal
@NancyPelosi And that's why we voted for Donald Trump.  He is the Best President this country has ever had and he will be voted back for another 4 years.   Thank God for Trump.  Trump 2020.
@CatherineDeveny Are you serious?  Our military people put their lives on the line for this country.  They get maimed and killed, disfigured and come back trying to put their shattered lives together again.  Lady, you are a disgrace.
@NancyPelosi You are about allowing illegal immigrants into this country and providing them with free food, medical, housing, cash and free education.  You are about lying to the public trying to brainwash them into believing Democrats care.  You want only $, power and control.

@Talkmaster HUD tenants rent is subsidized by the government.   They pay their portion and HUD pays the difference.   It's almost impossible to evict a HUD tenant because the landlord is accepting partial payments.   There is a state of perpetual eviction with HUD tenants.  Not for the weak.
@ASavageNation I think Trump lost weight.  Being the President definitely has its perks. 🤔🤠👱‍♀️
@Newsweek You obviously don't understand women are all.  Melania was flirting for specific reasons.   Attention, make MO mad; that really worked.  Make BO pant and sweat and laugh and laugh.  Make Trump jealous.  I say she accomplished all of the above.

@NancyPelosi Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Many Universities are now offering low cost or free education to illegal immigrants.   Emory college in Atlanta is now offering free  college to all eligible illegal immigrants.   This is the Democratics at work for lower income hard working young people.

@kanyewest KW had an opportunity to go on tour and make millions.  He chose to stay at home, claim illness and sue his insurance company.   Now he complains about freedom and the thought police trying to control and bring him down.  Who's the victim?  Entertainers make their money touring.
@jpodhoretz Because people are jealous and envious of his success and wealth.   Strong, intelligent, wealthy, successful people are targets.  People who are victims of lifes unfairness will always attack those better than them.
@drudgefeed In Psychological terms that's called "Paranoia ".
Was just warned by Twitter.  Paraphrase:  stop attacking NP.  DNC.  You get it.
@kanyewest @IFurMEthnWhoMi You must learn from the past so you can move forward.  To ignore the mistakes made will ensure you repeat them.  You must be conscious and mindful each minute of each day.  Kanye is Not a Genius.
@NancyPelosi There is no Climate Change.  The earths climates have been ebbing and flowing since its creation.   There is however, massive amounts of trash littering the oceans, overflowing landfills.  We are a country of massive consumption and live to obtain more and more.  Facts only Nancy
@prestonjbyrne @RealCandaceO @TPUSA You need to get a grip on reality.  Kanye has a long history of mental illness, drug use and the last time he opened his mouth, he was $50,000,000 in debt.   He thinks he's as smart as histories greatest think.  Not even close.  Trump 2020!
@Newsweek What is happening to our young people today?  Its incomprehensible these young men want to shoot and kill innocent people.  Is it for the thrill, attention, anger,  boredom?  Any ideas from Psychologists or Psychiatrists?
@BradThor And you will lose, Bigly!
@meridithmcgraw @KellyannePolls @jgm41 @PaulMorsePhoto I see fat ugly Michelle Obama made sure her hubby wasn't standing next to beautiful Melania.   He did sit next to her and laughed and laughed.    Bushes and Obamas are New World Order.  Stay away.
@Talkmaster How can people tolerate living in this cesspool city?  The beauty is gone.  Fear, homelessness and illegal immigrants have taken over.  Good people of SF, move.  There are thousands of great cities in America needing your expertise.   Go where you can thrive.
@drudgefeed Trump will never resign Avenatti.  You have no clue who you are dealing with.   Trump is the most resilient person and President the US has ever seen.   The harder and more challenging difficulties he faces, the stronger better and wiser he becomes.  He loves to win.  A Winner.
@brianlmaryott @RyanAFournier Who is they?  That's the question we should be asking.   Illuminati, powerful men or the American voters.  I say all three.  Trump 2020!  Hillary and Nancy Pelosi need to retire to their rocking chairs and exchange cooking recipes.
@NancyPelosi PJ said it perfectly, the picture says it all.  Granny Pelosi is truly losing her faculties.  Democratics instead of trying so hard to impeach Trump, and now attempt to sue Wikileaks, Russia and the Trump administration; put granny on the porch with her rocking chair/knitting.
@uhlmary1 @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You don't believe or dis believe an opinion.   You agree  or disagree.
@CASuperrunner @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @seanhannity Comey worked for Army Corps of engineers and was paid $6,000,000 before working for the FBI.  He doesnt need the money.  This is about his ego, pride and reputation.   He has a strong desire to be liked and thought of as a Good Man!
@ASavageNation Mental health issues have plaques mankind for centuries.  Hospitals will need doctors who will receive low pay.  Few if any will sign up.  Your government officials consider homeless and illegals more important than You, the hard working tax payer.  I agree,   Keep them away.
Nancy:  Obama was in office 8 Years.  He had his opportunity to Change our tax system. He did nothing.  So STOP NOW.  STOP CRITICIZING TRUMP.  IF YOU THINK YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB THEN DO IT.  COMPLAINING IS CHEAP.  ITS A LOSER VICTIM MENTALITY.   TRUMP 2020	@NancyPelosi
@politicalelle If you care so much about your city than do something about the mess.  What is the reason you and those wanting a great life choose to allow your public  servants to do nothing?  I hear how horrible SF is.  Losing tourist which means no money.  Michael Savage tells it well.
Listen up:  Never ever take Anyones word for the truth.  Listen and then do your research.  It's your responsibility to know the truth about a generalized statement.  Make yourself intelligent in all areas of life.  Read!
@Pontifex You are wrong Pope:  The Bible states to ask the Lord to forgive us for our sins and come into our lives.   Repentance is what God wants to hear.  He cannot live with us if we live with sin.   You should read your Catholic Bible.  The one where you change wording to exhault you.
@realDonaldTrump And Palmer Report:  You Are the Idiot.  You and the liberals not supporting Trump who wants to stop the Shadow Government and stop the abusive fraud.  Move to Mexico!
@realDonaldTrump It was means this:  Millions of dollars has now been wasted by the Special Counsel.  It means the FBI is corrupt and all top level management should be released.  It means: Trump have your attorneys put an end to this now investigation now.  Then release Mueller from his position
Just read Comeys memo.  He really sounds indecisive and wimpy.   He has nothing on Trump.  So what if Trump wants his name cleared.  He wants a good reputation with Americans.  Comey you totally ruined it for yourself.  He wants loyalty because he wanted to trust you.  Failure
@NancyPelosi Nancy before you start trying to speak do your research.  You just spew and spit negativity thinking it will destroy Trump and elect a Democrat.   Your wrong!  People ignore you.  Look at the mess called San Francisco.   CA cares more about illegal immigrants than it's people
@realDonaldTrump You can set your clock by this:  Every year in April before the start of summer and Memorial Day.  The gas prices go up.  Then around October and November they start going back down.  The oil companies know exactly what they are doing.  Good luck on stopping them Trump.
@Newsweek Yes, Make sure you use the correct verbiage; Allegedly.  Can anyone really believe what a fired, government employee says.  Comey enjoy for 5 minutes of fame because it won't last.
@jmackbenson @Msbmoran @jvalente80 @DRUDGE_REPORT Why waste your time with an illiterate  uneducated moron whose only purpose is a leftist agenda of trying to convince the world Global Warming is real and we are going to pay for it.  Your so much better than her.
@realDonaldTrump People of CA, only you can take charge and demand your Governor do his job and protect you and your families.  If you sit back and choose to do nothing, you will be a victim of his agenda.  Do you really want the continual demise of your beautiful state?  Trump 2020!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Shut the hell up Nancy.  You have no clue of what you are speaking.   People dont want to hear your perverse bias point of view towards our President, Trump.  We love him!
A must listen to for all Americans.  YOUTUBE: Kevin Shipp, CIA Officer exposes Shadow Government.   The truth about Trump and many other unbelievable facts taking place in our country now.  Hang on tight!
Ben:  As an athlete of 40 years, I need to tell you this.  Your skin is your no. 1 protection against disease.  Cherish and care for it like your muscles and your brain.  No dark tans no tattoos. Tats cause blood infections and weaken the bodies resistance 2 toxin. @goodbenrich
@Newsweek Correction:  you mean He revealed his HIV status.  Reality check!
OK California:  What's it going to take for hard working people to put an end to this insanity?  Soon, CA will become like Berlin.  No one safe walking the streets, shopping, driving.  You will remain in your homes.  Stop Sanctuary cities. https://t.co/2JXkXGG7wm
@ASavageNation Wiser not wider.
@ASavageNation I think you should use your enormous amount of vast knowledge and give more positive advice.  When people hear negative attacks constantly, it puts them in a bad mood and raises their blood pressure.  Especially when driving.  Better, stronger, wider everyday.
@drudgefeed Not only is this tragic, it can be stopped.  With so many wealthy young people, one would think they could come up with a way to feed the homeless and less fortunate.  Come on, challenge yourself to make a change.  Use your wealth wisely.
@drudgefeed Ladies and gentlemen:  This is the year 2018.  HIV was discovered in the 80's.  How is it still possible people meet a stranger and then have unprotected sex?  Stop being a victim of society.  HIV is not pretty.  The drugs to keep AIDs at bay are very expensive.  Put a rubber on.
@NancyPelosi Nancy you should take your personal electricians to Puerto Rico.  Take the Airforce Ine and stay for a few days of fun in the sun.
@NancyPelosi @USTradeRep Get over it Nancy.  You criticize every minute detail our representatives do.  Obama spent money.  He sent a plane with one billion dollars in cash to Iran.  If we audited your office and staff, I'm sure we would find waste and abuse of taxpayers money.  Trump 2020
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro CA is the worse state imaginable .  Pray the bill does not succeed .  Why doesnt the state take care of the homeless population instead of stifling free speech.
@thomas___mcfall @benshapiro That is beautiful!  I'm so glad you did understand at a better late than never time frame.  We are so afraid of things we aren't familiar with.  College is all about learning, that includes people learning.  You Go!
@ASavageNation What business does any person have wanting to know if Cohen is Hannitys attorney.  He didnt have to say a word.  We all have the right to privacy and keep personal relationships; personal.  This FB age manipulates people into sharing every little item of their lives. Mistake!!
@bethanyshondark @benshapiro Where were her parents, family, friends or teachers at school?  People are so afraid of offending or they judge.  A 14 yr. Old is totally clueless and was scared and ashamed I'm sure.  Her community let her down.  Obviously she has no guidance at home.  If so she wouldnt be preg.
@benshapiro OMG:  That's Nancy Pelosis son in law.
@drudgefeed A:  Your not funny. B:  HE DOESNT LIKE YOU, or C:  Both of the above.
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Nancy:  Again you are very confused.  Have you mixed up your medication or forgotten to take it all together?  Give Hillary a call, I'm sure she can help you out.  Trump 2020
Trump has had to work harder than the average person to become a billionaire.   He has always worked in the private sector.   Think back with JFK and Bill Clinton.  Were they morally upright?  Who are you to Judge Trump?  Your a fired government employee. Your book is pathetic.
Just watched the Comey interview.   So now he has become a Saint.  He believes he understands mankind and the motivation behind their actions.  Note, people show you what they want you to see.  Trump is not you Comey.  He will never be like you.  He is a billionaire businessman .
@krassenstein You dont know what the hell your talking about.  You make these blatant non proven generalized repeated statements upon which you hear in the liberal news every day.  Back up your heresy words with 100% proof or shut you stupid illiterate mouth.
@Newsweek And, will everyone please take notice how all through his book, Comey compares himself to Trump.  Newsflash Comey.  You are not and never will be as great as Trump.  Rich, intelligent and tough as nails.  Trump 2020.  Comey prosecuted and sent to jail.
@ASavageNation Hope really is irrelevant.   Its Trump's job to know and be prepared for whatever actions this man will take.  Its black and white, yes or no.  Assad doesn't listen to the US.  Trump will destroy him if he has too.
@Newsweek The most pathetic words ever spoken.  Comey says DT lacks values, we see how morally perfect Comey is And all 44 Presidents b4 Trump.  Analysis of his looks, seriously.   Trump doesn't smile.  He takes his job as president very seriously.  Something You Did Not Comey. Sad!€¿
@Newsweek Newsweek is again claiming to know things is has absolutely no knowledge of.  Trump's approval rating is climbing at an all time high and continues to do so.  Americans love Trump.  Boycott Newsweek!
@BenHowe Ben, you are a complete idiot.  What type of a loser attacks a person's mother .  This says much about who you are; a nobody.
@Newsweek Americans and the world, regardless of your political affiliation, what the FBI's Comey did is so unacceptable.   Do Not buy this book.  Dont put a dime in this man's pocket.  His behaviour should not be tolerated by Democrats or Republicans or Other.  Stand up and be heard!🇺🇸
@NancyPelosi That's Rich!
@Newsweek Lies, lies, lies.  Nobody read Newsweek.  They are spreading false news.  BOYCOTT NEWSWEEK!  TRUMP 2020
@Newsweek Trump has an outstanding number of southern supporters.  Newsweek is false news.  T bh e south loves President Trump.   Trump 2020.🇺🇸
@mikemuzik @realDonaldTrump Stick with what you know best, NOTHING!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump The President and all Americans should never tolerate this illegal behavior from a government employee. It was not his job to in any way interfere in the U.S. Election.  It is my hope Mr. President that in the near future, you can bring charges against him.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President; Comey's book makes him look and sound like a complete idiot and fool.  It's hard to believe he ran the FBI.  We can assure no persons believes any thing he has written.  Trump 2020
Regardless of you you voted for in the election, Americans cannot and should not tolerate espionage of political matters by any agency deemed to protect our country. ABC: Comey says his belief Clinton would win 2016 election 'was a factor' in email inquiry https://t.co/eUIHuWqeNS
@Newsweek I love it!  At least he is thinking logically.  If the device helps save lives that's what is important.  Baseball bats and stones are ludicrous.   Think outside the box with creative innovations. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
@drwgsi @Newsweek Not so!  I love most of my neighbors.  Most importantly, I am in touch with Reality.
@FoxNews Tell her GOODBYE and take all of her other liberal hollywood idiots with her.  We dont care people of America.
@Newsweek Another falsehood.  Any person or agency can say "I took a poll and people said this".  This is a vague generalized statement with no evidence or explanation as to who and how many were polled.  Thus, its wrong.  Comey is a lying  weasel and Americans dont trust him.
@ABC @benshapiro Thank God we are able to stop the torturous poisoning of these people.  If we would have reacted and commenced stopping Nazi take over during the March of Jews to death camps , we could have saved millions of lives.  Trump 2020
@NancyPelosi Really Nancy.  And what coherent strategy do you think should be used.  Stick with helping your grandson become like his best friend, you know, the wish he made on his birthday.
@NancyPelosi If your so smart Nancy then why aren't you President?  Why is your city and your state of CA of total disaster area.  High crime, high homelessness and a large illegal immigrant population.
@ChiefBevis7 @JohnnyNostril @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You should laugh because your the only one.  Everybody is laughing at you.  You stupid lie life illiterate liberal.  Dont put your name anywhere near me.
@realDonaldTrump So love you and believe in you Mr. Trump.  You are a winner and you are the greatest President this country has ever had.
@ChiefBevis7 @JohnnyNostril @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Your an idiot just like every other uneducated, liberal moron.  Trump 2020
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy you are a disgrace and embarrassment to the American people.  Your hypocrisy of even mentioning the rule of law is pathetic at best.   You fight to help illegal immigrants stay in this country, knowing it's against the law.  You are a fool. TRUMP 2020
@realDonaldTrump Yeah Trump!  And next you get to fire Mueller and Rosenstein.   We can't wait for that to happen.  Go Trump!
@Newsweek Unbelievable .  Where are you getting this BS.  The south and all the people in the South love Trump.  We voted FCC or him, we support him and we will vote for him again in 2020	Stop the randomized non supported leftist fake news.
@Lazulioness @Newsweek I can say whatever I choose to say.  There is no proof whatsoever that a survey was administered and how big or small the subjects were.  They could have surveyed 5 people.   That's the problem with ignorance in society, you believe what you are told.
@___JxResists___ @Newsweek Yeah Baby!
@Newsweek Where is Newsweek coming up with these insane concepts.  Obama is a Communist and a Coward.  Liberals may admire him but Republicans do not.  Other countries are threatened and intimidated by Trump because he won't bow down to their demands.  Trump 2020!
@Newsweek DNA test required on all paternal claims.
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Go back to India, Shaf.  You have absolutely no idea of what you are speaking.  You are Wrong and Trump is correct.  He knows his history and you Do Not.
LA County has asked resident homeowners to open their backyard sheds to the homeless.   Wake up each day to the smell of alcohol and feces.  Smile and watch while they poop in your yard and throw trash in your neighbor's yard.  Sign me up.
@Newsweek And who's opinion is that?  Is it just another make believe media analysis made by the liberal Media?  Trump will let Mueller finish what he started and when it's over, you will hear him say:  Your Fired!
@Newsweek Oh Hell No!  We want and need his tweets.  There would be major backlash and a reduction of Twitter users.
Another man cheats on Khloe	  Is anyone reall surprised.  It appears she has the same pattern repeated with the men she dated.  And now she is bringing an illegitimate child into her mess. @KhloeDaily
Ok liberals.  Another reason to be glad your a Democratic liberal pushing open borders and sanctuary cities.  You and your friends and families are less important than illegals.  https://t.co/bMUdeIjyq7
https://t.co/bMUdeIjyq7
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I'm sure by now you are surprised at how vicious and vindictive, hungry with power, money and control, government employees can be.  I have worked for the government for 22 years and remember, if you wrong someone they will never forget it.  Game on.
@ASavageNation That would be great except for one problem.  Cohen's wrote a letter/confidentiality agreement for Stormy on Trump Organization letter head.
@NancyPelosi But dreamers on your way to pick up the paperwork, you will have to step over the thousands of homeless people living on the streets of San Francisco and LA.  Oh, and watch out for needles on the street, fighting, and people relieving themselves wherever they choose.
Your name says it all.  Its total gibberish.  Oh and by the the way, ain't is not a word and is not in the dictionary.  So your argument for being g educated has collapsed.   @WollowUr
@ProudResister That's Right.  Get over it.  Nancy Pelosi constantly attacks the right.  Obama told us to live below are means and give our money to the poor losers who dont want to work.  It's only fair.  We want our guns and will use them if we have too.
Read between the lines, my lips are moving and I am a liar.  I would never do anything to hurt H. Clinton.  We are best friends.  Loretta Lynch.  	Loretta Lynch: Comey Had No Concerns About Matter vs. Investigation https://t.co/whT89MbRcL #Newsmax via @Newsmax_Media
@realDonaldTrump Liberals and Democrats are beyond the most ignorant animals on the planet.  You are under educated, if at all and you are dirt Poor.  You are so envious of Trump because of the spectacular, strong, impressive person he is.  You wish you could be 1/3 the person he is
@realDonaldTrump Mr. TRUMP:  Life is not fair, you have to be better, stronger and wiser every day.  You are a winner and will beat this monstrosity.   Because, in life;  All good will be attacked.  This is just another challenge for you.  Trump 2020.
@Newsweek No M. Markle didn't go out of her way to avoid Trump.  He avoided her.  Who is Meghan Markle to President Trump?  Exactly, a nobody!
Oh hell yes he will fire him once this investigation is over and Trump is exonerated.  Bye Bye Mueller.  I hope you have saved GB or your retirement. 	Trump On Firing Mueller: ‘We’ll See What Happens’ https://t.co/LjvbWZaJY7 via @dailycaller
@Newsweek You should be fattered!
@WollowUr @JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump Get real.  Americans are smart enough to understand manipulation and possible attempts of mind control.  We have Freedom of Will and Freedom of Choice.  To say we have been manipulated by Russian advertising is an insult of the greatest.
@makeLiberiaGr8 !!!Oopps!!🇫🇷
@axios @benshapiro This attack is a witch hunt with no end in sight.  I hope when this is finally over, after thousands of hours and millions of taxpayers paid officials, you Fire Mueller yesterday.  Go Trump.  We love you.  USA.🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷
@Newsweek Every single Teacher should quit their jobs now and walk out.  This is the hardest job in the world.  Teachers are under paid, babysitters to out of control students who have no discipline.  Teachers used to be valued as leaders.  No more.  Give them Money .
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What a total hypocrisy Nancy.  Trump did nothing wrong while H. Clinton broke every law in the Ethics and Policy/Rules conduct manual of the Federal Gov.  You need to stop your negative attacks of our President.  He is a Saint compared to any Democrat .
I hope you Liberals are so happy living in this pitiful democratic state.  Regardless of who you voted for, unless you take action to stop this Control of your thoughts and actions by Your elected officials,  freedom is gone.    https://t.co/Df7tt8qriq
@Newsweek That is a total lie.  America is free.  Look at people marching in the streets demanding all types of freedoms.  We have an over abundance of food.  No one dies of starvation.  Don't believe the BS propaganda.
@WollowUr @JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump Do you really think I care, you have no position, only stupidity.  Thus my attacks must be towards you.
@Newsweek OMG! I had the same thing happen to me!😱🤡☠👱‍♀️
@WollowUr @JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump This response is for RU a stupid idiot.
@WollowUr @JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump You are so beyond delusional and have no educated mind to help you seek and understand society much less politics.  Keep your job at Burger King.
@realDonaldTrump You are so correct Mr. Trump.  So how can the liberals and stupid be educated to this fact and support you?  Will the media relay this information?  All Americans should be interested because it affects us all.
@politico @POLITICOMag Personally and life experiences, I think men and boys are addicted to pornography to the extent they deny themselves normal relationships with women and girls.  There is no connection with life.  PORN is the drug of choice.
@realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld Trump, get in the FBI and Fire all of the top managers and directors.   Clean house and make sure they know You are in charge and won't ever tolerate this behavior.  We love you Trump!🚄
@realDonaldTrump As a Government employee for 23 years, DOT	I know exactly what Trump is experiencing.  Management and top officials act above the law, are never punished because people dont want to be bothered.  This behavior is in concrete.  Employees last 30 plus years.
@realDonaldTrump We are with you President Trump.  Change is scary for Americans.  They are not use to intelligent handling of trade with other countries.  We will be patient and await the exceptional outcome of your bold plans.
@NancyPelosi Democrats are victims of life.   They want a free ride and want the Government to take care of them.  Republicans are hard working people who eventually become wealthy.
@NancyPelosi Nancy you spew hatred and negativity to the American people.  Most Americans are happy and successful, even more so since Trump became President.  You are a victim and a loser.
@NancyPelosi You are so totally clueless Nancy.  T bgg e economy is improving because of Trump. So many companies are hiring, especially small businesses.  Nancy you live in a secluded, wealthy neighborhood and are out of touch with the realities of the people of America.
Does anyone even care what the ACLU thinks?  No!  They have nothing to do with border control.
@realDonaldTrump Obama then asked questions all day long because he was clueless.  And he lives to hang out with wealthy celebrities.  I challenge anyone to explain One thing Obama did to make this country great.   Just One Thing.
@goombar3 @Newsweek I'm highly educated and I excel in communications.  I'm an exceptional listener and problem solver.  You however, are timid and insecure.
@Newsweek I saw her on an adult's only site and I find it hard to believe Trump would even consider touching this disgusting human being.  And she said he didn't use protection.  Trump won't even shake hands, he is afraid of germs.
@Newsweek Oh how terribly sad for Facebook users.  I am by choose, a non Facebook user.  I dont believe in giving one person so much power over my life.  Let's have a new generation of No Facebook.   Yes!🇱🇷
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Laura:  you are correct, but as a Conservative who truly loves her country, I am confused as to why democratics would purposefully want to destroy their country.  Destroy futures of family and friends all for immediate gratification of money and power.
OK!  Newsflash!  Amazon is refusing to sell the book about Trump, "Killing the Deep State".  Is it time we all boycott Amazon and show them we will not allow discrimination and preferential political preferences by Jeff Bezos.   Comments???
@Pontifex The Pope doesn't believe there is a Hell.  The Bible states clearly there is a Heaven and Hell. Catholicism is known to change the words and meaning of the Bible to fit whatever they think it should be.  Pope does not know of God.
@Newsweek Him and the rest of the Entire World.
@Newsweek Trump is the best President we have ever had.  If you total loser dont like him then Leave.  It's that simple, leave now.  We Conservatives had to suffer for 8 years while pathetic Obama was President.  He embarrassed us.  He was weak and a coward.
@Newsweek You tell them Trump.  Put the hammer down and show them your in charge; Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America.  The riches, and best nation in the world.
Another peace loving Islamic person.   THANK GOD, NOT ALLAH SHE IS DEAD.#SanBruno
@Newsweek It's obvious you have no belief in God.  It's also obvious you dont have to think as CEO of Twitter.
@Newsweek What exactly do You think he should do, what?  Take all of our guns from us?  Do you really think that will stop a person from buying or finding an illegal weapon.  It's like asking Trump to stop all crime, stop all illegal drugs, stop obesity.
@realDonaldTrump To all of you Trump haters.  Learn how to write correctly.   Not only do you not know what you are talking about with our President, your so illiterate you can't spell it out.  Trump doesn't like.  Obama and Hillary lie.
@realDonaldTrump As a very educated person once said; unless your house is in complete order, dont consider criticizing so no one else's house.  It's so easy for so many of you to attack Trump.  You are truly clueless.
@realDonaldTrump Remember, some people exercise every day and we think they are great and disciplined.   Trump golfs how often.  Being the President is stressful regardless of who it is.  Golf is his release from stress.  Stop judging this man so critically.
@realDonaldTrump Can someone explain the specifics as to reasons liberal Democrats want to destroy America. They live here; their families and friends live here.  Is being stubborn and pathetic more important then successful, happy lives.
Mexico thrives off of the money from the US being g sent to them by illegals.  They will never co operate with America.  Why should they, they will gain nothing and lose financial benefits.
Nancy P. Shut up and retire.  You are so wrong in your opinions.  Do you really think An ILLIGAL IMMIGRANT IS GOING TO COMPLETE A CENSUS.  THEY WON'T.
@realDonaldTrump All of you liberals whining like babies.  So typical.  You are victims of life who want everything given to them.  You want a free, mindless ride in life.  That's what Obama gave you.  You have no understanding of success.
@realDonaldTrump I'm from Ohio, Yeah!  My grandfather worked for Firestone developing rubber for tires.  I love Ohio.
@realDonaldTrump Denise:  Shut up.  You are so clueless.  Why dont you move to this area with massive illegal immigrants sneaking into the country and back yard.  You stupid liberal you just start blabbing and have no facts with your words.
Trump may deny public assistance to illegal immigrants.  Yes, yes, hell yes!  Only US Citizens should be eligible to receive welfare.
@fvicente5690 Yes, Nobilism.  It means to think in higher plains than us normal working people.  To be wonderful and seen as pure, loving people wanting to help those in need.  Something like that.
https://t.co/VKXmi3v7sS
@realDonaldTrump Why are so many people oblivious to the fact that the Government wants CA citizens to pay for and support illegal immigrants.  To those of you who dont mind giving away your hard earned money, congratulations on your righteous nobilism.
This message is for Stephen 	Colbert:  name one thing Obama did to help improve the lives of all American cities.  You are such a total loser.
@realDonaldTrump SarahCA; you are an idiotic loser.   Your facts come from the media.  It is so easy to attack a winner like Trump.  He is attacked continually because he is right and he's a success.  People hate winners, it makes them realize what they can never become which is a success.
@realDonaldTrump Legally prescribed medications have been generalized into categories of illegal street drugs.  They false information has been turned into an elephant in the room, leading doctors and Pharmicist to refuse prescribing legal medication.  tTypes of opioids must be distinguished.
@realDonaldTrump The Opioid crisis is Heroin and other illegal substances.  What it's not is legal pain medication taken as prescribed.  This is factual through ER doctors statement.  Are people suppose to suffer with chronic pain because they are no longer able to receive prescribed medications?
@PaulaBonaFide Paula; you are a loser.   You're probably very poor and uneducated.  It's very apparent by the way you speak and what you say.  Trump is a winner.  He's a rich, highly educated President and thus its understanding why you and Liberals dislike him.  You are all losers.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, you are one of the best Presidents our country has ever seen.  Obama and J. Carter tie for the worse.
