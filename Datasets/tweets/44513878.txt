RT @eramshaw: 5 years ago, at age 21, this woman was arrested for having *a tenth of an oz* of marijuana. And for 5 years, she’s been prohi…
13/ And public opinion, both inside and outside the state, is changing. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/vAwGLAKsBF
12/ But in their most recent platform, the Republican Party of Texas approved a plank for the first time supporting making it a civil, rather than a criminal, offense to possess an ounce or less of marijuana. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
11/ Decriminalization and legalization, one sheriff argues, “is just giving people more access to a gateway drug.” https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
10/ But while there are signs of change, there’s no consensus. 		Much of the rebuke for decriminalization measures has come from law enforcement groups. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
9/ Harris County prosecutors offer a diversion program that gives residents caught with less than four ounces of marijuana the option to take a $130, four-hour class. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/d3Mp0tNyZp
8/ Meanwhile, several Texas district attorneys have already pledged not to prosecute first-time, low-level offenders in their respective counties. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
7/ Cases like Sigler's are one reason state Rep. Joe Moody filed House Bill 63. 		His bill would replace the criminal penalty for people caught with an ounce or less of marijuana and replace it with a civil fine of up to $250. 		https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/UM5ZHOWC7X
6/ According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, roughly 379,000 Texans have been arrested for possessing 2 ounces or less of marijuana in the past five years. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
5/ Stuck in the middle are people like Sigler, who live in counties where prosecutors still take on first-time marijuana offenses. 		Since her arrest, Sigler estimates she’s spent more than $5,000 on lawyer and court fees, drug tests and probation costs. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/IGOJ0S4p8J
4/ Meanwhile, there’s growing public support and bipartisan backing at the Capitol for lessening — or ditching — criminal penalties for what are currently low-level offenses. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
3/ In Texas, possession of any amount of marijuana is illegal. 		But some local court officials are already backing off of pursuing charges against some first-time offenders. 		Other counties still prosecute to the full extent of the law. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD
2/ The repercussions Texans face for possessing small amounts of pot — something several states no longer consider criminal — can all depend on where in the state they live. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/O2cn4z91mI
1/ This is Sydney Sigler. 		She’s drug tested regularly. She’s not allowed to drink. She’s not allowed to leave her home county. 		This is life on probation. 		Her crime? Getting caught with .1 ounce of marijuana. https://t.co/6lXgrX0idD https://t.co/SC1QOx2VT8

6/ The government paid retired teacher Juan Cavazos $21,500 for his land. He couldn’t afford a lawyer to fight for more. 		But other landowners who could afford lawyers got deals that, on average, *tripled* the opening bids. https://t.co/xNLd9k239A https://t.co/lwa5QXuUUz
5/ In less than a year, Homeland Security filed more than 360 lawsuits against property owners. 		They used a legal loophole so the agency wouldn’t have to formally appraise the land, making lowball offers based on substandard estimates instead. https://t.co/xNLd9k239A https://t.co/vCaJyP66hb

5/ But civil asset forfeiture is panned by both liberals and conservatives who see it as a violation of Americans’ civil liberties. https://t.co/6EmGOCi0Be https://t.co/q96T7ZaHMJ
4/ Law enforcement say it is necessary for fighting crime and drug cartels. https://t.co/6EmGOCi0Be https://t.co/wMXCKFddKV

21/21 For now, Simmons is sticking around. He just ran for — and secured — another three-year term. 		Read our full story here. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
20/ What if the community elected someone in his place who didn’t believe in further pursuing integration?		 What if his seat falls to someone who wants to reverse the gains of the past 48 years? https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/ZbomI45K4C
19/ This is Troy Simmons. He now has the longest tenure on the Longview school board.		He’s tired. He was thinking about retiring from the board. But he says leaving is not a decision he can make without considering the impact. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/FJ4FFjBZys
18/ Some Longview ISD leaders acknowledge that the opposition to integration that drove the two white men to blow up Longview’s bus barn likely still exists in the community. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
17/ Longview is still a small town where many hesitate to talk directly about race. 		And people are divided on how they recount the racially fraught history or whether they acknowledge that same racism still exists today. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/iIc3TItTgr
16/ The future is uncertain. 		If the district had spent almost 50 years trying and failing to completely close the educational gap between white, black and Hispanic students with a mandate from a federal court, some wonder if it can succeed without one. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
15/ The massive overhaul appears to have worked. 		Longview ISD made more progress integrating black students after 2008 than it had in the previous 15 years, an analyst says. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
48 years after a judge ordered the Longview school district to desegregate, many goals remain unmet. Whether it continues a commitment to student equity now depends on the collective will of a school board that could change with a single election cycle. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/O0jF9b5bCW
14/ Longview ISD built eight schools, renovated three others, razed several school buildings and upgraded technology across the district. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/L5mkbWFAy8
13/ A turning point came when the board gave voters a $266.9 million bond to finance a massive overhaul of the district’s schools. 		It passed by fewer than 20 votes. 		That was in 2008 — decades after the court order. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
12/ Meanwhile, the school board itself was stymied by personal politics and disagreements over district leadership, Ted Beard said, leaving little room for attention to their court-ordered requirements. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
11/ Two men conspired to blow up dozens of school buses that were meant to transport black students to white schools. 		They were later convicted. 		They each drew 11 years in prison. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
10/ Fearing a “revolution” of the black community, a group of white residents conspired to “injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate” black students in Longview.		They collected lethal weapons like hand grenades, dynamite and Molotov cocktails. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO
9/ Getting here wasn’t easy. 		When the court issued its ruling in 1970, folks in Longview saw the federal push for integration as a threat to their autonomy. 		Some reacted with violence. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/QXpJtN0AWi
8/ This is Ted Beard, a longtime Longview Independent School District board member. 		Beard knows the district’s commitment to student equity now depends on the collective will of a school board that could change with a single election cycle. 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/9odLPTVZiV
7/ Local leaders say Longview ISD has made progress. 		After all, a judge lifted the desegregation court order this June. 		But will Longview continue to improve without federal oversight? 		https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/cO8bLyTwDi
6/ And Longview ISD has struggled with a new challenge that the judge couldn’t have foreseen 48 years ago: Adequately providing a burgeoning group of Hispanic students with crucial services they need to learn English. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/LSFzWRVLfQ
5/ White students are about half of the students enrolled at Longview’s specialized elementary school, which has higher academic standards. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/wrbzcUVXW1
4/ Longview’s class of 2016 saw 43 percent of white students scoring college ready on SAT and ACT exams, compared with just 2 percent and 3 percent of black and Hispanic students. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/6PvGPMXADD
3/ About 56.2 percent of white students graduated ready for college English and math in 2016. 		Compare that with a dismal 23 percent of Hispanic students and 16 percent of black students. https://t.co/VkIk69qQEO https://t.co/mPVlQKx02Y
