@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump As long as we waste our time and intelligence trying to respond to his ridiculous proclamations we remain his pawns. He baits us with lies. Better to let him know we see through his Cult Leader tactics. Let's learn more about cults &amp; work from that premise!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump We need to stop engaging with the content of his declarations, step back, and understand that his strategy is to get us caught in the trees but not see the forest.
