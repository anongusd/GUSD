@TomJack77898680 @gloves78 @roflinds It‚Äôs the same thing, self-entitled, in the photo, once you see the video you don‚Äôt see that defiant attitude. I hope your children never get framed that way by the leftist media.

@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson They did nothing wrong. Again, you and your sanctimonious attitude. Have a great day as well.
@TomJack77898680 @gloves78 @roflinds Ask any teacher or parent for that matter, I sense you don‚Äôt have kids. They will tell you behavioral differences between boys and girls in general. Sandman did nothing wrong. I probably would have pushed that old men out of my face. He handled it pretty well.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson To harbor those feelings. In my experience kids/ teens will treat you like crap if they perceive you don‚Äôt like them. Think about that. Yes, shitty kids are shitty and ugh but they are growing up. We are the adults. It‚Äôs wrong to harass them like this online.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson Because they are kids. You are projecting so much hate to them because you are expecting them to be rapist when they get old? I like teens all races. I work with them. And I don‚Äôt care if some of them are privileged. You help them to become the best. It‚Äôs wrong to harbor
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson Mind you, they were surrounded and felt threatened by a group of adults that knew perfectly what they were doing. A bunch of white kids with MAGA hats? Easy prey. Shame on them. The left is pretty horrible. It‚Äôs saddening. I hope your kids never get framed this way.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson Do you have kids? Do you understand them? It seems to me this is all because the MAGA hat. YOU are the one hating, not them.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson I see kids dancing with the Native Anerican. You see them ridiculing the elderly because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs in your heart. You are projecting. These are kids not adults. Kids sometimes act and say inappropriate things and not knowing exactly why adults see it wrong.
@TomJack77898680 @gloves78 @roflinds Yes. Boys are kinetic and need to run and move and jump and shit. Just like dogs they get antsy if you don‚Äôt take them out. It‚Äôs natural. I see you are trying to diminish their masculinity quoting the Gilette ad, you are very ignorant about children and teen development
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson Sorry for the typos.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson With their game chanting. Totally appropriate if you asked me.  They could have engaged and they didn‚Äôt. You guys have to stop with the sanctimonious attitude against these kids. What really bother you is the Maga hat.
@AmberBobamber @akaBarni @thecjpearson I saw the video of that picture and know the context. They asked their teacher if they could do the chanting stuff they do when they have school games. Nothing extraordinary, high schoolers being high schoolers. They felt harassed, by adults mind you, and replied with their game

@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Have a nice weekend Rantkkng, you REALLY are the King of the Rant! üèÜ
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump The fabricated evidence also was a big problem. Please don‚Äôt argue that you know it‚Äôs true.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump And that will benefit all. Also, regarding undocumented, I want them all to come and have the opportunity here but they have to do it legally. A flow of illegals only benefit business, it keeps wages down. So it‚Äôs not that inconsequential to have a lot of working illegals around
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump If you lived in a bad neighborhood you had more security.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Well probably you live on a nice neighborhood. In the case of the border nowadays more than undocumented people it‚Äôs more the crimes like drugs and human trafficking that needed to be that controlled.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump What I want to say is that he was guilty and could have been judged guilty but because that framing of evidence he was freed.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump OJ was freed because a police I cannot remember the name fabricated evidence.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump More work for them don‚Äôt you get it?! Why do you have doors and walls in your house? A robber needs to work harder. The more barriers the better! This conversation is stupid
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump You should retweet this https://t.co/I7Ngt1fMBU
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Oh please
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I will wait until the indictments come. I am telling you, they haven‚Äôt been able to produce anything because the investigation is compromised. Remember what happened to OJ he was guilty but that police wanted to prove it even more and compromised the evidence?
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Ask or investigate what border patrol wants and need.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Because they need more. Like you said, this walls are older. New tech walls are needed. Anti tunneling proven etc.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump It seems to me all so convoluted and revolving into framing Trump. 2 years and no smoking gun?  Also, that investigation after he fired Comey? Approved by who? I am telling you I see a lot of shade.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump He didn‚Äôt deny them their ability to apply, he only asked them to report to a border post and state their intention.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump There are some walls working my friend. I live on a border town.

@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I am glad he is fighting back and also securing the border which will benefit all of us.
@TRantking @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I agree with you that the safety of this Democracy is compromised but not necessary by Trump. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to win. That‚Äôs how I see it.

@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic You need more than one poll to come with a fair conclusion. If you gonna write a paper and based your evidence in one poll your paper will be severely flawed. This poll is flawed for the reasons I explained before.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic You have no interest in listening because you know I am right. It happens all the time. Companies pay for clinical trials favoring their products and political parties especially the Democratic machinery do it like we saw last elecctions, most polls were flat wrong.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic They might not be leftist but the organization that pays might have an interest. Like a clinical trial sponsores by a company interested in x result. Same way the Steele dossier is full of bs since it was proven paid by people linked to Hillary Clinton.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic It‚Äôs not contortionism, it‚Äôs debating a result that like I said before, had flaws.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic You would need additional polls to make a conclusion.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic It‚Äôs psychology. Like I explained to you, we have a climate today filled with women candidates who are far left such as Acasio Cortez, Fauxcahontas and that woman who called T a MF. That will play on the answer and pollsters know that. So yes, it can be skewed.
@SwansonRand @NickWillGarcia @MichMarz @Brasilmagic That‚Äôs right. Same happens with clinical trials.
@JudgeJeanine She was in HI recently
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic So to answer to your question. Is it fabricated? Somehow, because pollsters know that information. They know that on an environment with so many female democrats a republican would say no way.  In other words, pollsters predicted the answer. There is a lot of psychology in it.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic And sorry for the typos!
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic So it is easy to say Republicans are mysoginist which many could be as much as any Democrat.  But to really press that question the poll should ask, how confortable do you feel having for ex. Condolezza Rice as president. Then you can find your answer right there.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic But for example, if we had more names today of Republican candidates who are women perhaps the result could be different.
@NickWillGarcia @SwansonRand @MichMarz @Brasilmagic They arw many ways to skew results. But in this case is more the fact that all women candidates who are women are Democrats. So when Republicans are answer the questions have that on the back of their heads without intention.

@MAGAindex Funny thing is many immigrants do vote Republican. They don‚Äôt want to see the bs that destroyed their contries happening in here. The Democrats are behaving like Hugo Chavez. Scary. I support many D bills but less and less bc of their radicalization to the left.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi To respond to your question he is in favor for technology as well. This discussion is pointless as the petulance of Pelosi and Schummer. 5B is a very reasonable budget for border Protection. It‚Äôs the president job to do it and congress to facilitate it.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi That is one reason that it can be worked on but the other is criminal activities. The wall will help and like I said before borber patrol is in favor of ot, they wanted it.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi If you can imagine America decides to give all kinds of benefits to illegals which I agree, then how can you sustain infrastructure to support if you are motivating that influx. For example all the schools of U of CA are impacted as per today. All of them.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the reason although I can see the narcissistic intention about it. The real intention is to have more control on the border so we can have some kinda amnesty. When Reagan had the amnesty he was promised more controls afters and that never happen.

@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi In addition, it is also coming hefty by tunneling. And human traffickers also use tunnels. The wall thing is not only a wall, Trump for all the bad things you can say about him who can be many he is absolutely right to protect their borders. You talk like he is only comitted for

@WolfbloodShow @grconk @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump Under it kinda difficult since this wall will go under...
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Your point of view, however he has done a great job dealing with China, Mexico and North Korea. Other than the Democrats and their stupid media, leaders respect him. You don‚Äôt hear this at Bezos‚Äô post or other Democratic propaganda media but people outside of America respect him
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi This is pointless. The Wall is another prevention to all this illegal activities.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi It‚Äôs such a stupid discussion to say A WALL won‚Äôt work. It has worked everywhere. Israelis swear by it, the border patrol wants it but you and Nancy Pelosi don‚Äôt bc it‚Äôs costly. But Democrats have 100B to sponsor a train to nowhere in CA. What a pointless discussion.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi They also come in tunnels your beautiful technology can spot. Guess what the wall will physically prevents drugs and human traffickers. But nooooo it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs idea he is a racist he is blah blah blah. HIS JOB is to protect the borders! Let him do his job petulant Democrats!
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump I think h already talked w/ Border experts nationally and internationally. Everybody agrees.

@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi If it has working so well why so many illegals?  I live in a border town, I talk to border patrol. The wall is needed.

@RepAdamSchiff It‚Äôs not a broken promise. You Democrats want it to be.
@mama_nay @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump That is not his job.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The other point to talk is how corrupt these governments are. Is that Trump‚Äôs fault too?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If America do what Swalwell suggests then Trump will be label an interventionist and a colonialist. In reality he doesn‚Äôt need to do that. But it is the job of the President to preserve the border security Mr. Swalwell. Did you miss elementary school that day?
@thisisinsider Not the fault of the cat sorry. He should have frame it and put it on the wall! Where did he keep it
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi They want Trump to fail because he is not a Democrat.
@mvanvol_van @FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi This wall is much needed and more comprehensive that the walls that we have, for starters it will prevent tunneling. Our current walls don‚Äôt. There is a lot of benefits to have it but Democrats have decided they will become the party of obstruction because of politics

@swtbbymnchkn @SexCounseling @RyanAFournier Tunnels are dismantled every day.  It‚Äôs not that they exist and cannot be removed. Your proposition that criminals can be helped through diplomacy is infantile. And regarding Israel, it is very safe! What are you talking about?
Crazy https://t.co/Lw8yP2vKXW
@rising_serpent @SharylAttkisson Siri too
@ContentTBA This is a different wall that will go down the earth. We have a serious problem with organized crime digging tunnels and smuggling anything including  humans. This wall is not a crazy dream of Trump, border control asked for it.
@ContentTBA @SteveScalise I do live in a border city. The problems are not people overstaying their visas that‚Äôs a problem but not as serious as drug and human trafficking not to mention possible terrorism. The only way to prevent the tunnels these criminals use is the wall.
@swtbbymnchkn @SexCounseling @RyanAFournier You cannot use diplomacy with criminals? I don‚Äôt understand your point.
@swtbbymnchkn @SexCounseling @RyanAFournier It‚Äôs not a dumb solution. With this ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù wall will be very hard for drug and human traffickers to dig tunnels. I don‚Äôt know if you know the problems with those tunnels. That‚Äôs a very important reason to do it.  We have walls already but they don‚Äôt go below the earth.
@ContentTBA @SteveScalise If it becomes a problem we should.  Now, the question for you is, do you think we are having the same problems with both borders?

@swtbbymnchkn @SexCounseling @RyanAFournier You are crazy. Calling everybody a racist don‚Äôt support your argument. The matter is that her point is not only valid but true. The only way to have an ammensty etc is to control the border first and how do you do that? With a wall.

@HamFlannery @Emperessguinn @TheGreatFeather @Jali_Cat @Ocasio2018 Venezuela have many problems but the worst of all it‚Äôs their lefty love leadership. So we had the Chavistas to the left and a left opposition. And millions of money stolen. Too much money to steal. The Nomenklatura Chavistas stole estimated a Trillion dollars (yes with a T).
@1776Stonewall That same statement can be applied to Democrats who are a rats nest.
Insane Democrats are advocating for open borders. https://t.co/CKuxvOIxc7
@luvjazz60 @TheGreatFeather @sundance7055 Because most of them didn‚Äôt vote for Chavez but only one time in 1999. Then the Chavistas committed electoral fraud, took our guns away and the international community abandoned Venezuela.  What would you do if that happens to you and your family
@Emperessguinn @HamFlannery @TheGreatFeather @Jali_Cat @Ocasio2018 As a Venezuelan American I can tell you you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. Yes chavistas are thugs and leeches but most Venezuelans are hard working, love free enterprise much more than your regular Democrats and usually have graduate degrees.

@wheres_ally2016 @DrZ_Smith @scotgov @JohnSwinney There was this case, in America, a 10 year old raised by his mom... totally gay ok... fine..  he killed himself after coming out in his school... this case really broke my heart... this is not about kids being tolerant or not, this was about putting a lot of pressure on a 10 y-o
@DrZ_Smith @wheres_ally2016 @scotgov @JohnSwinney That was my original question how and what ... details are important...
@DrZ_Smith @wheres_ally2016 @scotgov @JohnSwinney Kids are not cognitive developed enough to understand the workd adults do
@wheres_ally2016 @DrZ_Smith @scotgov @JohnSwinney Yes there are some families... that is true... parents to tell the kids to beat somebody for whatever reason... and that is not ok

@wheres_ally2016 @DrZ_Smith @scotgov @JohnSwinney You both have great points. Imo teaching respects to everyone should be the goal. You respect others because you want to be treated the same. Regardless you are hetero or not, black or white, I guess it‚Äôs up to the parents too teaching their children about lgbt as well.
@DrZ_Smith @wheres_ally2016 @scotgov @JohnSwinney You got me! No, lgbt in the classroom, tolerance to other, multicultural education and special needs... It‚Äôs important that part imo

@bbonesboy @scotgov @JohnSwinney So that was my question how much it will be taught in schools.  And what age too.
@bbonesboy @scotgov @JohnSwinney And I see you are 15. Belive me your identity change as you grow older. That‚Äôs one thing, the other is the consequences of such mutilations at young age. The genetic makeup that makes us who we are stays the same so all that deserves consideration.

@MichelleSawye He also would not have stood for Democrats. When you READ MLK you find more conservative values in his words than what Democrats stand these days.
@MichelleSawye That‚Äôs a story line imo. In fact I know racism bc I see it everday and I cannot peg it only to conservatives sorry again. I support equality but not radicalized and organised vandalism sponsored by a political party. The Democrats have become a joke.
@MichelleSawye MLK would never ever be a Democrat these days. He wouldn‚Äôt have stand for abortion.
@MichelleSawye No they are not supporting the KKK the same way the Democrats are supporting radical groups. Sorry.
@MichelleSawye Then you don‚Äôt know your history. And again KKK number of people are a JOKE comparing to the Antifas.
@MichelleSawye If DT in fact supported those groups the numbers were higher. Having said that, I agree that there is a lot of people in these country that are against immigrants and minorities voting for Trump but I won‚Äôt peg it to conservatives.
@MichelleSawye In your mind Republicans support KKK and Neo Nazis but in reality the political party that is in fact supporting RADICAL GROUPS is the Democratic party.  I tell you more, the KKK had millions of members in the South (all Dixiecrats) reduced to a mere 5,000 at most in today‚Äôs üåé

@Soulchild_Tee @MoDendinger @ananavarro If you think MLK would be supporting the violence sponsored by the radical Chavistas from the antifa and other commentary from most Democrats these days you never have understood his message and what that great man was about.
@MichelleSawye @MoDendinger @ananavarro Probably not supporting him specifically BUT I can tell you they won‚Äôt be aligned with the Chavistas from the Democratic party either. I cannot see MLK defending the antifa for ex. The Democrats in their quest for social j have forgot all the principles of liberalism.
