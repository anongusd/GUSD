There were more. After his arrest and two girls filed suit, others kept coming  forward. One said the same youth pastor seduced her at least five times while she was in a high school member of his #Baptist youth group, where he frequently preached on abstinence.
There were more. He pretended to be friendly and offer a ride to another older teen when her car broke down. She had been a long-time member of his youth group. But he took her to his house and she had to beg him to take her home.
He convinced the 16-year-old he loved her and that they were in a 'relationship.' He  repeatedly sexually assaulted her.  "I thought I really loved him," she later said. "He's not the person I knew. I feel like he's a sick person. I think he's going to do it again
There were more. Youth pastor Chad Foster targeted a 16-year-old  during a 2011 summer camp for another church, Community of Faith. He visited the girls' dorm late at night to share his message about being saved by God from drinking &amp; divorce &amp; to then found her alone on a beach.
A 12-year-old was one of the victims of a predatory youth pastor she met at #Houston's Second #Baptist She later testified. "My life has turned upside down. I can't relate to what people are going through any more. My innocence is gone." https://t.co/HPM6DxWlUg via @HoustonChron
