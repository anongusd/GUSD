@Hagenson_Zach That‚Äôs Paul again, who you do not follow. And sadly i fear support of Trump is incompatible with Christ‚Äôs teachings.
@Hagenson_Zach Because Jesus is always the most compassionate one and that line keeps moving.   And that‚Äôs why He would be pro-woman when it comes to divorce today as He is in Matt 19.  He‚Äôs a good guy.
@Hagenson_Zach I assure you not at all.  I‚Äôm saying if the reason you judge gay ppl is bc of Jesus you get to stop doing that - because Jesus condemned many behaviors but never gayness and He was quite specific about how we should treat each other.
@Hagenson_Zach It is not a sin theologically.   It‚Äôs a sin according to guys who are not Christ and you can‚Äôt claim Hesus as camouflage for an Un-Christian stance
@Hagenson_Zach That‚Äôs now what Christ says.  I‚Äôm sure He would have evolved with the times - he changes OT divorce law and calls out Moses in defense of women - but you know JC‚Äôs terms for divorcing one‚Äôs wife are very narrow.  Like, not Trump‚Äôs.
@Hagenson_Zach Are you saying you yourself follow and obey the laws of Leviticus?  Or are you pretending that somehow this means Jesus wants you to judge gay people?
I stopped watching the Kardashians after Kaligula Kardashian got elected.
@Hagenson_Zach I view LGBT discrimination/prejudice as being incompatible with the teachings of Christ.
@Hagenson_Zach Jesus overturns many OT laws from Sabbath observance to death penalty to divorce.  He reduces 10 commandments to 2.  yes He fulfilled the law - you get to eat bacon and you don't have to judge gay people, you have to love them.
@Hagenson_Zach Respectfully this began with you calling homosexuality sinful; and Genesis isn't Jesus.   Jesus never spoke against gay people  You get to drop that hangup.  It's a new covenant.
@Hagenson_Zach I assume you are talking about Matthew 19, which is actually Jesus coming out against straight divorce, not gay marriage.  Shall I assume you oppose the concept of heterosexual divorce, unless for the reasons JC lays out?
@Hagenson_Zach People who project their own hangups onto Jesus are recreating Jesus in their own image.
@Hagenson_Zach I've studied the scriptures.  I'm not lying.  	None of those are Christ - all Paul.   	And even Paul said "It is better for man to marry than to burn in lust" 	So why not let gay men marry?
EXACTLY THIS IS WHY I HAVE REFUSED TO GAY MARRY https://t.co/wTtETWdDD4
@Hagenson_Zach Respectfully, Jesus never said a thing about gay people and you don't follow or obey the chapters that do.  You're of course allowed to not like gay people but that's got nothing to do with Christ.
@patriotdb There are no Biblical laws concerning immigration or borders.
@Hagenson_Zach 1 - judging homosexuality as sinful	2 - yes.

@mikeyoch @IlhanMN Context, intent and audience.
Trump calls off another shutdown by getting US taxpayer $ for a barrier: 		-he said Mexico would pay for	-that the majority of voters rejected	-which will only cover 2% of the border.   		Because the healthiest way to stop a toddler tantrum is to reward it with a small toy.

@greycole05 @IlhanMN Mike Pence calls himself Christian; his policies and views are not Christian.  Rep. Omar's comments abt why GOPS support Israel were wrong - but they were not directed at Israel or Jewish people; they were directed at AIPAC &amp; DC's lobbyist culture of legalized bribery.
@AlanAshton10 @loua3 @MalcolmNance Which portion of that tweet is Biblically inaccurate?

@lildog73 @tactus72 Being gay's not a sin.	Romans is Paul, not Jesus.	Paul's not even being homophobic in Romans - he is clearly talking abt straight men who hooked up w/each other bc God 'gave them over' to it.	Not the same as being gay.	The Good News of Jesus is you get to drop this hateful shit.
@lildog73 @tactus72 As with the Roman Centurion's 'servant' some guys were not into girls and Jesus seemed pretty chill about it.   All the homophobia is from Leviticus, which JC's covenant fulfilled &amp; Romans which is generally misinterpreted out of context.

Matthew 19 is Jesus calling out Moses-era divorce law as being 'hard-hearted' bc it allowed men to kick women to the curb any time.

My dear homophobic friend, Matthew 19 is Jesus coming out against straight divorce, not gay marriage.   Go ahead and be prejudiced but Jesus was never anti-gay; you don't get to use him as cover.		ALSO, Trump supports gay marriage.  So you got the hypocrite thing wrong twice. https://t.co/Yy1PFDnIVQ

@slidellman4life Oh, I'm quite aware, Christian and NRA member.
@StarLordInfidel @clairegabby1 The Bible states that life begins at first breath, God is quite the fan of killing the unborn throughout the OT , He gives Moses abortion tips for unfaithful wives in Numbers and in Exodus makes it clear He does not give the fetus the same value as women's life.

Lara Trump wants the 800,000 struggling govt workers to know she did not mean to say anything remotely insensitive, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
@michaeljknowles It‚Äôs never going to be built. It‚Äôs a racket.   Trump@has hired undocumented workers in two different centuries and claims he‚Äôs trying to keep them out.  He lied and said Mexico would pay.  It‚Äôs socialism. They would steal land from citizens. Keep fighting for this
@michaeljknowles It will not work due to supply and demand; and in this case my friend you're the one arguing for socialism that will steal land from taxpaying US citizens.		Also, it will never ever ever be built, even if DT gets the money.

17.  The majority of Americans still oppose the wall.   They know it's expensive, bigoted, stupid and won't work.     The majority of Americans don't hate America.
16. Trump promised his supporters that Mexico would pay for the wall.		He promised you, #MAGA.  Many times.  Now he literally wants you to pay for his own broken promise.		(And the majority of 2016 voters rejected it, 74 million total (HR &amp; 3rd parties) vs. DT's 62 million)
15. America has crumbling roads, bridges, a deliberately underfunded public school system, neglected infrastructure and an underfunded VA.    		A guy who's hired undocumented workers wants $5billion to keep undocumented workers from coming here for work.   It's all a scam.
14. People who support stealing migrant children are legally still allowed to call themselves Christian. They are not.
13. The wall will not stop undocumented immigration. Ladders and shovels are things that will still exist.   		As will America's giant "Help Wanted" sign.
12. They are never going to build a wall across thousands of miles of desert, rivers and forests, private and commercial property - while forcing Americans to give up their land under eminent domain law.		Wall fans are arguing for big govt to seize private American property.
11. No national Democratic politicians have called for any legislation or policies that could ever lead to "Open Borders." 		This is important.  Any politician or media figure who uses the term "open borders" is lying.   		The Bible calls that "bearing false witness."
10. Trump hires undocumented workers. Going back to the 80s w/undocumented polish construction workers.  		The same people who exploit undocumented labor also exploit fear of the undocumented. You're being suckered by very rich hypocrites.
9. From slavery to Chinese railroad workers to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to today's overseas sweatshops, exploited labor by marginalized peoples has always propped up the US economy.  		Without 'illegals' you'd pay $40 for a salad. 		And I know, salads don't apply to Trump.
8. Politicians don't try to punish people who give jobs to undocumented workers (driving down supply of jobs) bc fear of Central American &amp; Mexican immigrants &amp; asylum seekers gets massive votes &amp; campaign donations.  It's a racket.
7.  Trump is an illegal. $25 million for education fraud alone.  And I don't really need to say this, but more to come.
6. "Illegals" is a racist, dehumanizing, other-izing term.    It's un-Christian and hypocritical - if you drive 56 in a 55 zone, aren't you an 'illegal' too?		 If you disagree, count how many other types of lawbreakers FOX News calls "illegals."
5. President Ronald Reagan supported Amnesty (his word) and argued that open borders allow them return home when they're done working here.		https://t.co/VQw5qdBMOq
4. Undocumented immigrants pay state, local &amp; sales taxes.   Over 11 billion in 2016,  https://t.co/WCrrwAlL89		(And when legal immigrants arrive here as adults, we don't have to pay for their education &amp; they can start paying into our Social Security system.)
3. Undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than US-born citizens.  Legal immigrants also commit crimes at lower rates than US-born citizens.
2. The majority of undocumented immigrants are people who overstay their visas, not illegal border crossings.  Politicians don't talk about this.
1.  If US politiicians really wanted undocumented immigration to end, they'd start locking up the Americans who hire them.  The demand for undocumented labor would swiftly end. They never talk about that.  There's a giant "Help Wanted" sign at our border and it's not coming down.

@AJPPatriot @Dave_in_LA @DeanObeidallah Romans is Paul, it‚Äôs not Jesus, Paul‚Äôs not talking about actual gay people, he proscribes no laws, you don‚Äôt obey everything Paul says anyway and Jesus was never anti-gay so trying to pretend He was is quite shitty and in-Christian.
Any person who sincerely claims they follow both Jesus and Trump probably knows very little about either.

@SouthernKeeks I read it.   But I'm confused.  If you succeed in your goal of criminalizing abortion, we both know women still have them.  And 1000s of new Gosnells will be created.  Who will you seek to incarcerate?  Because you won't end abortions, just the safe &amp; regulated ones.
@SouthernKeeks And again - and this is the point you dodging with the insults - I  never said the Bible endorses abortion.  I've said that you prioritize that as an issue over Jesus' actual teachings.   I don't see you fighting for the Govt to obey the teachings of the Beatitudes or Matthew 25.

@SouthernKeeks Well now we both know the OT is filled with many examples of God finding the lives of children not really all that sacred.    And respectfully it still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that fighting against abortion has been prioritized over fighting for the things Christ taught.
@SouthernKeeks My point has always been that certain followers of Christ prioritize something Christ never talked about way beyond the things Christ did talk about.

@realBurdette @michaeljknowles Jeremiah's God letting Jeremiah know they actually have a special  and unique bond in that verse, if you're a fan of context.
@realBurdette @michaeljknowles Yes, it's almost as if different books contradict each other.
@Chualland @JacinB @harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles I didn't say it, God said it in Exodus.    And I don't know a single Christian who obeys the OT rules.
@SanMarcosMiguel @SantinoCharlie @michaeljknowles That wasn't the claim.  	The claim was that Jesus never mentioned abortion &amp; it's true. 	But for many, fighting for a govt that criminalizes abortion has been prioritized over fighting for a govt that does things Jesus actually talked about, both in Matthew 25 &amp; the Beatitudes.
@michaeljknowles N5 21 Here the priest is to put the woman under this curse‚Äî‚Äúmay the Lord cause you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry &amp; your abdomen swell 22 May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.‚Äù
@JacinB @harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles No, if the woman dies the assailant must die.  If the fetus dies the assailant lays a fine.

@harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles Reginald, somebody hurt you once and it wasn't me.  You can't "end abortion."  You can only criminalize it and incarcerate women.   The Bible's not against birth control either, and we have an unwanted pregnancy problem with an abortion symptom.  Good luck.
@harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles I never said the Gospels supported it; that's more false witness. I said Numbers 5. 		But some Christians have made abortion, which He never spoke of, their primary mission, over the Beatitudes &amp; Matthew 25.		And voting for DT is rewarding the moneychangers in the temple.
@harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles It's a "curse" in the form of medication given by a priest that kills the fetus and renders the women barren.
@JoanPennnative Actually, not a bit.
4 of the last 5 Bob Dylan albums have been cover albums, for people who love Bob's voice but not his lyrics.
I've compiled a list of every time Megyn Kelly ever called a caucasian a 'thug' and it fits neatly into this tweet.		With enough room left over for her to remind you that Santa &amp; Jesus were white.
@harperreginald1 @michaeljknowles And your nastiness is why your Christian piety seems a bit strange to me.	And now that we've been rude to each other, God makes it clear in Exodus 21:22 that fetuses don't have the same value as humans &amp; God gives Moses abortion tips for unfaithful wives in Numbers 5.

@JMurchadha Secondly, Christ never said 'take up your sword.'  That's the NRA lie and you are of course free to repeat it.  He said 'he that lives by the sword will die by the sword' in the same passage you are misquoting.

Merrick Garland is a reminder that the only POTUS ever denied an up/down vote on a SCOTUS nom was also the only black POTUS.		Not saying the GOP Senators who blocked it are racist.   		But they should have to explain why they're not racist, every day, for the rest of their lives.

@PasquinoMarifio @SarahSpencerPol If someone says the Christian Trump supporters have rejected the teachings of Christ, and you respond with a series of biblical quotes that are not Christ, you sort of prove the original point.
@PiXyyRDuust Yes, he claims to follow Jesus but the party that controls the Christian narrative is the party that opposes the teachings of Christ.   That quote is neither God nor Jesus but Paul.  This guy doesn't know the difference.

13.  Thank you for letting me share these memories;  I've never attempted a thread before but few artists have ever been so creatively, spiritually AND politically inspirational. #ArethaHomegoing  #ArethaFranklinFuneral
12. I could never repay her; I could never give to her what she gave me over my lifetime and on that night.   But I'll keep listening to her; remember to be grateful for having been alive while she was here; and honor the inspiration that's shared by all who loved her.
11. I had seen Aretha Franklin perform live but was not prepared for the experience of knowing she was watching my set.  Making a lifelong hero laugh was a gift that inspires me to this day and makes me continuously want to live up to the honor.
10. Wealth &amp; success did not make her care less about the less fortunate.  She consistently cared about the marginalized, the hopeless, the struggling.   Physically, politically and spiritually, she lived in #Detroit.
9. The album taught me that her soul, pain, joy, empathy, and grace was the link between her spiritual recordings, her hits, and her political activism.   All those parts of her were driven by the same love - of God, of life, of a common humanity, and of justice.
8. Aretha's songs on the album include "Mary Don't You Weep" "Wholy Holy" and the best version of "You'll Never Walk Alone."  Her father preaches and Aretha's piano playing is lovely throughout.  It helped me understand the differences between spirituality and religion.
7. it features the Rev. James Cleveland and the Rev C.L. Franklin (Aretha's dad) &amp; won Aretha the '73 Grammy for Soul Gospel Performance &amp; became the best-selling live Gospel record of all time.  Sydney Pollack filmed the LA performance but Warner Bros shelved the doc until 1999.
6. I love her pop &amp; R&amp;B performances but since I was a teen I've loved her Gospel work. One Lord One Faith One Baptism was big in the 80s but I highly recommend you check out the '72 live album "Amazing Grace," which I first heard when @JediBunny gave me a copy in our NYU dorm.
5.   Aretha was very political and listened to Stephanie Miller, and was a regular viewer of progressive cable TV news programs.  There have been many articles written about her activism but I want to thank her for supporting artists who performed political comedy.
4. A few minutes into my set, I realized that I could hear her booming laugh from above the crowd.  The audience began to realize that she was there as well, and the orchestra section began lighting up with cell phone glows as people started posting that Aretha was in the house.
3.  The orchestra section was packed &amp; it was a spectacular crowd.  Nobody knew who was sitting above them as the show began.  Backstage we had agreed to hold the curtain until her entire group was seated.
2. We had only planned on selling the orchestra section so we offered the queen &amp; her court the entire mezzanine.  We also offered her comps but she insisted on paying for the tickets for her entire party.
My 1st-ever thread, in honor of #ArethaHomecoming 		In 2011 I got to perform, along with @aishatyler &amp; @StephMillerShow on the @sexyliberaltour, at one of the most beautiful theaters in America, the Detroit Opera House.  We found out Aretha wanted to come &amp; bring 11 friends.
