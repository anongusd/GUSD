When the fields are full they have a need paying as little as possible to feed all these people.
It said that this society his the biggest vulture of all sitting in the whitehouse disrespecting them all.
Something to do with persons who live on govt assistance and child support from baby mama drama who would never work in the fields.
It seems they feel that the higher levels live with there mommas complaining about their student loans..never thinking to labor in the fields.
They explained how it equalivates the need for a wall...something about how they can not allow the most hardest workers to pick the crops that actually feed them...when they sit all day complaining how they haven't enough.
They explained to me that as a result of that theory it empowers the persons who are considered the Vulture.
It has to do with persons feeding on the most vulnerable.

You need to pay attention to this man because he does not care about the poor the elderly or building up America he just pocketing whatever he can and so is Congress wake up
Now Trump is cutting FEMA funds for Disaster Assistance he did this in hurricane Irma and those victims are still waiting for help
