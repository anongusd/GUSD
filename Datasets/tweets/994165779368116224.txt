Most people believe fake news to be non-business networks such as CNN and MSNBC. However financial news networks such as Bloomberg and CNBC are consistently broadcasting speculative spontaneous conjecture as absolute facts in a need to explain everything affecting markets.
Does USA "deserve" a very strong patriotic natural born leader such as  President Trump who is determined to fix the many generations old  unsolved problems of USA? Or does USA want a namby pamby nincompoop in the Oval Office to please illegal aliens and "sanctuary city" mayors?

The Bitcoin signature scheme is based on ‘elliptic curve’ cryptography.  On a sufficiently large quantum computer, Shor’s quantum algorithm could  compute the secret key corresponding to a given public key very  quickly. If a signature is cracked, the hacker can spend the coins
The  quantum  cryptographic system was developed by Id Quantique in  collaboration  with Senetas by Professor Nicolas Gisin at the University  of Geneva [Paul07].  The quantum cryptographic unit that was developed  is called ID500.  GENEVA VOTING WAS FUNDED BY THE US MILITARY
Switzerland has been the innovator of electronic voting by being  one of the first to offer electronic voting over the internet.  They  have  also been credited with being the first to use a quantum cryptographic  system to secure electronic ballots over a fiber-optic line.

30 million dead people, illegal aliens, and non citizens are voting on Nov.6, 2018, for the party of crime. It means that every Republican and patriotic American must get out and vote Republican.
About 30 million dead people, illegal aliens, and non citizens are voting on November 6, 2018, for the party of crime. It means that every Republican and good patriotic American must get out and vote Republican.
Why complain about foreign election interference when there are many millions more people registered to vote than there are adults alive in USA. Also Mueller "investigation" ignores China when Communist China has 10 times more influence over internal American affairs than Russia.
President Trump was 100% correct when he repeatedly said that the democratic party is the party of crime. Democrats believe politics is a criminal enterprise. USA has 3.5 million more registered voters than voting age live adults according to the Election Integrity Project.
The absolute determination of President Trump to bring Americans being  held in confinement abroad back home shows the supreme genius of  patriotism as against globalist Democrats.

Make no mistake. Twitter is anti- Trump. They just can't stop Republicans. They try everything  to give an upper had to the extreme far left. WE THE PEOPLE have enormous political genius. Look at the crows at President Trump rallies.
5*****hotel business such as https://t.co/rZH5bTSRG7 …  …  requires honesty to succeed, because so much of it is totally transparent. That's why Democrats hate President Trump. They are crooked; deceiving us and distorting facts. Sweep them out and keep them out of Congress.
Today's democrats have a hatred of all those in the US military in uniform and all US uniformed law enforcement officers who are not willing to be politicized and used as weapons against the Republican Party. Even hating those in the FBI who are not tools against Republicans.
In the past 2 years, many democrat journalists have called for Trump supporters to be murdered, including even the Honorable Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh.
The Germans are using  is using the EU, WTO, World Bank, IMF, to force  trade patsyism on Americans, rather that President Trump's America  first.

Vote 100% Republican on Tuesday, November 6, 2018 and keep our economy roaring. GOP must extend congressional control in House and Senate and keep making America Great.
Every country with supercomputers used by its Intelligence knows that the Democratic Party has long ago totally and completely given up hope on America being able to survive until the end of the 21st century. Then comes President Trump and every country knows the Dems were wrong

Democrats say that President Trump must be destroyed, because, in the future, any other President of the USA will appear to be weak in the eyes of the people of the world, when compared to President Trump.
When President Trump criticizes his cabinet member Attorney General Sessions for incompetence, the American public knows that the Mueller special counsel team will feel more empowered to attempt to destroy every and anything with the name Trump anywhere in the USA and abroad.
The ruthless campaign to totally destroy the Trump Presidency has gone to extremes and has crossed the line by those formerly in the FBI leadership, the leadership of the Justice Department and former leaders in the DOJ, who hate President Trump's election victory and leadership.
The most unfair investigation in history,  the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation, has been brought to light by a wise few, such as Jeanine Pirro, Sean Hannity, Trey Gowdy, Pam Bondi, Dan Bongino, and the expert legal team at Judicial Watch (https://t.co/jn7ZmNLrv2).
No wonder there were 10,000+ murders in Chicago from the time Obama's chief of staff Rahm Israel Emanuel became mayor of Chicago from 2011 until today in 2018. No wonder 98% of those Obama pardoned were drug traffickers, responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.

RT @GOP: President @realDonaldTrump will meet with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un at 9 pm ET. History is happening. https://t.co/2ghhdcDQHy
Since the founding of the UN every President has seen himself as de facto President of the U N and the America worker as the the person to be tricked, lied to and deceived. That ended with the election of President Trump as the only President who owes nothing to anyone.
Our dearly beloved President Trump should not meet with Putin in Vienna, Austria, where our President says, " the worst deal in US history was made "the Obama-Iran deal" even if The Kremlin continues to demand the location be Neo Nazi controlled Austria. Anywhere else is OK.
Republicans,	If this Trump Putin summit, in neo-nazi controlled Austria,"where that horrible Iran deal was signed", turns out to be true, it means I can no longer support my dear friend President Trump, as he will have fallen into a trap laid for him by enemies on the far left.
@FBIBuffalo Thanks
