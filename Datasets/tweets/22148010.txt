Congrat to @TobyMarie the new Texas #teaparty state coordinator! YEAH!
@MsLynnGallo we can take it to email
@MsLynnGallo statement had to be made, we are not onboard with it or his idea for new constitutional convention, other organizers are peeved
@MsLynnGallo it was not public (we knew about it a week ago) until Leahy decided to speak for a movements that has already pushed him out
@DLoesch official in that we are onboard for consistent information, we and others don't like Leahy being put as national spokesman #tcot
@DLoesch Leahy makes statements that make the rest of us livid, he wants his "New Constitutional convention" idea pushed, we are not onboard
@DLoesch Tea Party Patriots has actually been listening to our concerns, holding conference calls, & working with organizers to address them
@DLoesch I can e-mail you our 2 cents
http://houstontps.org/ Houston #TeaParty is proud to be part of #teaparty patriots! http://teapartypatriots.org/ OFFICIAL National Organizer

@Leahm4v LOL, you have fun :)
@pwtenny You're full of it, you've never met us nor know anything about us, yet you libel us about things you know nothing about #teaparty
Soros funded Corporate Lobbyist and hack @janehamsher still libeling houston #teaparty I'm wondering #whereismycheck right? #tcot
@Leahm4v as in speakers or attendees?
Houston -Stupid #teaparty truther tricks! http://houstontps.org/?p=243 #tcot idiots with no integrity still trying to paint us as lobbyists
If jokes like Firedoglake Krugman & Sadlyno had any integrity they’d retract Of course they don’t have any so I won’t expect one #teaparty
The Corporate Lobbyist @pwtenny is complaining that Houston #teaparty links to AFP who don't fund or organize us. What an Idiot! #tcot

Krugman is now on the "Tea Party Truther" Bandwagon... What an idiot!!! Astroturf my butt! Houston #teaparty
Felicia is on the radio NOW talkling about Houston #teaparty http://kchnradio.com/3.html
If we're being organized by "Corporate Lobbyists" then where the heck is my check?! Houston #teaparty #tcot
@pwtenny The reality of it is that Houston #teaparty is total grassroots and no PACs were involved in organizing us or any other Tea Parties
@pwtenny No, they have not organizing an "significant portion" of these protests. You're imagining way too much out of that.
@pwtenny I'm addressing it. Freedomworks has no part in organizing the Houston #teaparty. There! #tcot
@bsegovia Rapid response, we're being lied about as being organized by "corporate lobbyists"
@pwtenny We don't, stop BSing
@thomasjkeeley Seems @janehamsher is just trying to make crazy baseless connections. Might as well coin the term #teaparty "truther" #tcot
And I see you're from Freedomworks. Not that we have a problem with you, we support your work. Just we haven't spoken as she implies.
@thomasjkeeley I'm more Amused at her :D LOL
@janehamsher People can post information of our event if they like That doesn't imply that they are "organizing" the Houston #teaparty #fail
@thomasjkeeley She's the one who's cornered, she's so far out in this she just looks like a big fool
@janehamsher Well, they haven't talked with Houston #teaparty! You're implying way too much. Go ahead and keep making stuff up! #fail
LMAO!!! Crazy Firedoglake lady trying to link Houston Tea Party to “Corporate Lobbyists” http://houstontps.org/?p=191
@EileenLeft They are not organizing us, only listing different tea parties in Texas #fail @janehamsher is off her rocker, this is stupid
@janehamsher Dick Armey/Freedomworks are not organizing Houston #TeaParty nor have been in contact with us Do you even know who is? #fail
@pwtenny Oh brother.. A mom of 2, an unemployed guy and a few local people are now "Corporate lobbyists". Give me a break! Houston #teaparty
@MelissaTweets Who is this crazy @janehamsher lady and what's she smoking? ROFLMAO! Corporate Lobbyist indeed! Houston #teaparty
@janehamsher LMAO R U kidding me? Ur link is dead, but Houston #teaparty organized by corporate lobbyists? I was laid off last week! #fail
Almost time for Houston #teaparty! Crunch time!
One week until the Houston #teaparty! Be there!
