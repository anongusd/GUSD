Investigate the motives of the Republicans on them committees that stopped investigation 2 help the president friends family cover-up LIES. Why 1/2 of them didn't even like him when he was running for president now they're protecting him and putting their reputations on the line.
The Republicans corrupt they need to go all that was involved and helping covering the lies of all the Committees NEED to go they cannot be trusted. It's clear those Republicans pick their party &amp; corrupt president  OVER United States of America. THEY NEED 2 GO. Investigate
They helped Rodger Stone get away with lies &amp; freedom 4 past year we could been had all this information if they would have allowed Dems 2 subpoena and complete investigations. That's how  Muller got information after reading transcript of Stone lying2 Congress he got the records
Why you would not do your job and investigate fully I feel like all Republicans that were on the Committees and stopped investigations &amp; LIED &amp; said that there was nothing there 2 continue investigation or subpoena any records r LIARS  and should be  investigated for obstruction
