Also, I urge State Department and administration officials to immediately brief members of Congress on the national security implications of pulling out of the treaty, and how they plan to preserve and protect remaining global nonproliferation equities moving forward.
I urge the State Department to actively pursue negotiations with Russian counterparts to secure commitments before the treaty formally expires in six months.
This decision threatens the broader system of nonproliferation treaties the United States has spent decades building.
Unbound by the restrictions imposed by the treaty, Russia will be free to build as many intermediate-range missiles they want, putting our European and NATO allies at direct risk of further Russian aggression.
The President should affirm and rely upon the diplomatic arm of the United States’ national security apparatus. Negotiation takes hard work and tough decisions; walking away is not the answer.
Failing to come to a resolution with Russia for their violations makes us less safe. The U.S. should remain party to the treaty and work with the Russians toward a mutually beneficial agreement within the parameters of the treaty.

That legislation passed with 68 votes in the Senate and provided $40 billion in funding for border security. It also provided order, rules and certainty for individuals and businesses and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Once the government is reopened, Congress should have a substantial debate on how to fix our broken system and begin work on legislation that mirrors the bipartisan 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill.
Instead of continuing his shutdown, President Trump should commit to signing the Republican bills passed by the Democratic House that would reopen the government and secure the border with over $1 billion in funding.
President Trump shut down the government to force the construction of a wall that security experts say won’t work. A concrete or steel wall is not border security.

Secretary Mattis’ last day as Secretary of Defense is a concerning moment for our nation. In addition to thanking him for his service, Democrats and Republicans must come together and fight for the American values Secretary Mattis highlighted in his resignation letter.
President Trump should be demanding accountability for the deaths of two migrant children instead of playing political games. His administration must ensure proper medical care for all migrants in their custody.
As we spend time with family and reflect on what’s truly important, I’m thinking of all those impacted by the dysfunction in Washington.
Wishing all of those celebrating today a very Merry Christmas.
Hell no. Democrats and Republicans must come together to reassure our allies and ensure that America keeps its commitments and continues to lead the world. https://t.co/z5yb0QtTbR
From the conflict in Syria to combatting Russian aggression to supporting our servicemembers and their families, Secretary Mattis has promoted U.S. national security interests over partisanship. I'm grateful for his service.
Secretary Mattis has served our Nation with integrity and distinction, both in uniform and as Secretary of Defense. His departure from government is a significant loss for our country at a time where professional, steady leadership in national security is sorely needed. https://t.co/y58txz7Bz3
Instead of creating chaos, President Trump should support the bipartisan funding bill that the U.S. Senate passed unanimously. It provides over $1 billion for border security funding, but not a wall that security experts say won’t work.
We’re moving towards a Trump shutdown. The President said he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government and now he’s doing just that.

Passing these bills was a major accomplishment that followed years of work, and it will pave the way for additional reforms. We must continue working to promote fairness, dignity, accountability and rehabilitation in our criminal and juvenile justice systems.
The bill also encourages states to limit the detention of youth status offenders who've committed an offense that would not be criminal if committed by an adult, like truancy, breaking curfew or running away from home. There's no reason for these kids to be incarcerated.
Youth Promise Grants will help local communities disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline and support at-risk youth through a variety of programs, like tutoring, youth mentoring and physical and mental health programs.
In addition, last week, Congress passed the Juvenile Justice Reform Act to reauthorize our federal JJ programs. This bill included two policies I've led in the Senate: Youth Promise Grants and limiting the detention of youth status offenders.
It also includes reforms for federal prisons, encouraging participation in programming like job training, education and substance use rehabilitation. It prevents the use of restraints on pregnant inmates and ensures access to feminine hygiene products.
The bill also effectively ends solitary confinement of juveniles in federal custody, a provision included in the MERCY Act. Kids aren't just little adults, and solitary confinement can be especially harmful to their developing minds.
First Step eases mandatory minimum sentences and includes retroactivity for the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. This means individuals sentenced before 2010 can petition to have their sentences reexamined.
Last night, we passed the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that makes important reforms to our federal criminal justice system, a jumping-off point as we work to address our Nation's mass incarceration problem.
This year the Senate has passed two major bills to reform and improve our criminal justice and juvenile justice systems. I'm proud to have worked with colleagues across the political spectrum to get these bills done, and I look forward to continuing our work in the next Congress.

Republican efforts to rip away health care coverage and protections from tens of millions of Americans is dead wrong and makes our nation less safe.
The Administration has shirked its responsibility to stand up for Americans in need and instead continues to use the courts to hurt middle class families and children.
This outrageous decision would also end Medicaid expansion, which will rip away health care coverage from over 700,000 Pennsylvanians.
Through this ruling, the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans have succeeded, temporarily, in destroying protections for pre-existing conditions and purposely denying health care to millions of Pennsylvanians.
The United States Senate should follow suit by debating and voting on these measures in the 116th Congress. We cannot wait any longer to take meaningful action.

Dr. Ford is credible and persuasive.  She is also unbelievably brave. Until I heard her talking about what she experienced, I didn’t fully appreciate the terror she felt in that moment, the horror of the physical assault and the psychological trauma of believing she might die.
A great example of Democrats and Republicans protecting the civil rights of over 61 million Americans.

To those smear artists on Capitol Hill attacking Dr. Ford, why are you afraid of an FBI investigation?
There is plenty of time for a standard FBI background investigation to examine Dr. Ford’s account.
Speaking of delays, this “vote must be done next week” shenanigan is just that. Senate GOP held Justice Scalia’s seat open for 293 days under President Obama, refusing to give Judge Garland a vote or even a hearing.

Under these circumstances, it is even more important to have these documents.
If he were confirmed to the Supreme Court,  Judge Kavanaugh could find himself ruling on critical issues of presidential power and executive privilege.
Individuals close to the President are under active investigation. His campaign manager has been convicted on eight counts. His personal attorney has pleaded guilty.
“The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.” - Judge Kavanaugh
“It makes no sense at all to have an independent counsel looking at the conduct of the President.” - Judge Kavanaugh
“[T]he President should have absolute discretion (necessarily influenced, of course, by congressional and public opinion) whether and when to appoint an independent counsel.” - Judge Kavanaugh
His writings speak for themselves: “Congress should give back to the President the full power to act when he believes that a particular independent counsel is ‘out to get him.’” - Judge Kavanaugh
Having these documents is vital. It is even more important for Kavanaugh, whose record indicates a disturbing and expansive views on presidential power.
The Judiciary Committee is conducting a hearing without knowing basic facts about the nominee’s record.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on the Kavanaugh nomination even though millions of pages of documents from his White House tenure have not been released.
As we celebrate Labor Day, we must pause to remember the women and men of organized labor who fought for workers’ rights and helped build the middle class.
This conflicting guidance from the Department of Education will make it harder for victims to come forward and will discourage the changes that needs to happen to keep young women safe
The regulations also appear to conflict with other federal law, like the Clery Act, which I amended in 2013 to improve how schools respond to sexual assault
Title IX is a cornerstone of federal law to protect students from sexual harassment and sexual assault, and these regulations will hurt victims and make it harder for them to seek justice

Instead of holding Vladimir Putin accountable in Helsinki, President Trump embraced him and in doing so diminished America’s standing in the international community and shamed the office of the presidency.
Why is the President so deferential to Putin while he trashes our law enforcement who protect our country and our communities every day? Is he afraid of Putin?
The President told the world today that he believes the word of Vladimir Putin over the findings of his country’s own intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
They continued "Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump."
In 2017, our intelligence agencies wrote, “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election." https://t.co/DmclMYyZyu
.@realDonaldTrump attacked and diminished our law enforcement officers and intelligence agencies on foreign soil in front of a hostile dictator and on matters directly relating to an attack on our nation.
Vladimir Putin is an adversary of America who attacked our elections in 2016, illegally annexed Crimea, has backed the murderous Assad regime in Syria and works every day to undermine our country’s security.
I have supported the Administration’s engagement with North Korea and on other matters of foreign affairs because I believe that America is strongest when our foreign policy is bipartisan. However, what occurred today was a new low and profound embarrassment for America.

I will oppose the nomination the President will make tonight because it represents a corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests.
President Lincoln called on our nation to work to ensure “… that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Instead, the GOP is determined to pack the Court with a government of, by, and for extreme Right corporate interests.
I was elected to represent all Pennsylvanians. I was not elected to genuflect to the hard Right, who are funded by corporate America.
Pennsylvania workers have led the way to ensure that working people have basic rights, good wages, and benefits, like health care. The last thing working men and women in Pennsylvania need is another corporate justice on an increasingly corporate court.
From the formation of the first permanent Pennsylvanian local labor union in Philadelphia in 1792, through the Lattimer massacre in Northeastern Pennsylvania, to the Homestead Strike in Western Pennsylvania to today’s struggle to protect the right to organize...
Heritage has also called labor unions – who helped build the middle class – “cartels.”
They recently hosted a press conference for Republican attorneys general who are trying to eliminate those protections through the courts. In Pennsylvania, there are more than 5.3 million people (including 643,000 children) who have pre-existing conditions.
Heritage, which is an extreme Right organization, just released a new proposal to end protections for people with pre-existing conditions and gut Medicaid for seniors, people with disabilities, and children.
Any judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the D.C. swamp.
This list is the bidding of corporate special interests hell-bent on handing health care over to insurance companies, crushing unions that represent working men and women, and promoting policies that will leave the middle-class further behind.
In a nation with over 700 sitting federal judges, many of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, it is outrageous that President Trump will nominate from a list of just 25 dictated to him by the Heritage Foundation.

This nation deserves a Supreme Court Justice who will be guided by the principle of equal justice under the law for all Americans.
In this term, the Supreme Court has issued rulings that would decimate labor unions, deny many Americans their right to vote and allow partisan gerrymandering to continue.
Over and over again, the current Supreme Court majority has only represented the interests of extreme right wing ideologues and big corporations.
Justices who sit on the most important court in the world, should not be selected by corporate interests and extreme right organizations.
If an individual from the list provided to candidate Donald Trump by far-right organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society is nominated, then I am highly unlikely to support that nominee.
Thus far, the Trump Administration has nominated many far-right judges that put the interests of big corporations ahead of justice and fairness for all Americans.

Stopping the assault on workers and labor unions in Congress, state legislatures and now the United States Supreme Court is vital to increasing incomes and strengthening the middle-class.
If all workers benefit, it is only right that everyone contributes a fair share fee.  This effort in the courts was nothing more than a well-funded attempt by corporate billionaires to dismantle unions.
If someone directly benefits from the negotiations by a union, it makes sense that they should pay a fee to cover the costs associated with this work and not get a free ride.
By overturning 40 years of precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court is showing its opposition to the rights of working families and commonsense.
Unions provide a path to the middle class for working people by increasing their income and the economic security of their families. To this end, it’s important that we do all we can to empower workers to organize, not make it harder. https://t.co/wCcUUe0Vud

I’m joining an effort headed up by @SenJeffMerkley to call for Senate hearings on the Administration’s cruel treatment of migrant children. This isn’t over and there must be accountability and oversight
Substituting a lesser form of cruelty for a greater form is still cruelty
Detaining families indefinitely, possibly in violation of the Flores Agreement, is not a valid alternative
How can you claim your EO will end family separations when it does not explicitly prohibit them?
Why would you want to modify this agreement when you already have authority to enforce the law and ensure children are kept safe and healthy?
The Flores settlement agreement, which you intend to modify, simply requires that DHS meet basic child welfare standards and ensure children are held in the “least restrictive conditions” and released “without unnecessary delay.”
Why are you using taxpayer money for this form of detention rather than looking to alternatives like the ICE Family Case Management Program (FCMP), which had a 99% court appearance rate for families
Your EO states families will be kept together subject to the law and appropriations. According to the Center for American Progress, daily detention costs range from $126 to $182 per person, while alternatives range from $0.70 to $17 per day
Family detention is bad for children. How will your EO ensure children are kept safe when DHS facilities do not meet basic child welfare standards? https://t.co/uy5GVMRt0h
What steps are you taking NOW to ensure that every migrant child cruelly ripped away from their parents is reunited with them?
Here are some questions I have for the Administration about the executive order (eo) and their current policy
The fight for justice for migrant children ripped away from their parents is not over
There are no excuses. Every child that was cruelly separated from their parents, from months-old babies to young teenagers, must be reunited with their families.
The Administration has an obligation to ensure that children whose health has been adversely impacted by this policy receive appropriate medical services. Congress must demand that the Administration take steps to reunite every child that has been separated from their parents.
This hellish policy was a choice and there must be a full measure of accountability for those officials who ordered it, defended it and carried it out.
The Admin, aided by the complicity of extreme congressional Republicans, made a proactive decision to enact a policy that harmed children, told falsehoods about the origin &amp; scope of the policy &amp; for days held the fate of these kids hostage in order to extract policy concessions.
These medical experts have said that the long-term impacts of this barbaric treatment could be lifelong health problems, such as heart disease and substance abuse disorders.
Nearly 2,000 children have been subjected to what the American Academy of Pediatrics has called, ‘toxic stress’ and ‘amounts to child abuse.’
Family detention is far from the only or best solution for the majority of families at the border. In addition, for thousands of children, the damage is already done.
It is long overdue for President Trump to amend the most egregious element of his cruel and inhumane policy of ripping migrant children from their parents. But substituting a lesser form of cruelty for a greater form is still cruelty.

They want to use the courts to enact the rest of their health care scheme—starting by allowing people to be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition and charging older Americans more for their health care.
It is now abundantly clear that in passing a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy, Republicans also believe they signed into law permission for insurance companies to once again come after basic protections for the middle class.

Mr. Porter has spent his career advocating an ideology that puts special interests, big corporations and those at the top ahead of Pennsylvania families. I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination.
As a Senator representing more than 12 million Pennsylvanians, I refuse to be a rubber stamp for the extreme right.
Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to put mainstream individuals on the bench, this Administration and the Senate Majority Leader are demanding that the Senate confirm judicial nominees who advocate a hard-right ideology to appease their corporate donors.
I have worked in good faith to move forward mainstream nominees whose judicial philosophy I disagreed with, including this Administration’s nominee for a Third Circuit seat in Philadelphia.
My bipartisan work to recommend highly qualified individuals to the federal bench, both Republicans and Democrats, including five individuals nominated to the District Court in Pennsylvania by this Administration, is second to none.
He has also praised a ruling that sought to overturn portions of the Violence Against Women Act. Our courts must be guardians of civil rights, of our values and of basic protections for workers.
His published works reveal an ideology that will serve only the wealthy and powerful as opposed to protecting the rights of all Americans. Mr. Porter has argued against the Constitution’s Commerce Clause, which has guaranteed civil rights protections to millions of Americans.
David Porter has no judicial experience so one of the only ways to assess his fitness for the second highest court in the nation, the U.S. Court of Appeals, is through his writings.

Republicans in Washington should end their maniacal obsession with undermining our health care system and work in a bipartisan way to bring down costs for families.
Then, instead of working in a bipartisan way to bring down costs for families, congressional Republicans tried to pass a scheme that would institute an age tax and decimate funding for seniors in nursing homes and individuals with disabilities.
Hours after being sworn into office, President Trump issued executive orders that undermined our health care system.
Advocates for patients like the @American_Heart Association and @AmericanCancer Society have called out this sabotage, yet the Administration and congressional Republicans have continued to pursue these destructive policies.
This is a direct result of the ongoing attempts by congressional Republicans and this Administration to sabotage our health care system from day one.

By taking a step that violates the JCPOA, President Trump has taken a drastic step that will increase the possibility of Iran resuming its pursuit of a nuclear weapon and make it much more difficult to reach a diplomatic agreement to constrain North Korea’s nuclear program.
Pursuant to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the Administration is required to report to Congress if there is a breach of the deal. That has not yet happened.
I have also worked to ensure full verification and enforcement of the Iran nuclear agreement and strongly counter their non-nuclear destabilizing actions.
I supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) because it was the best available option to substantially constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions and to improve oversight of their technology.
In the Senate, I led efforts to sanction and hold the Iranian regime accountable for its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, its development of ballistic missiles and its support for terrorist proxies.
In testimony before Congress in April 2018, Secretary Mattis specifically referred to the intrusive nature of our ability to examine Iran’s nuclear capabilities.
On October 3, 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis spoke about the agreement and said, “I believe, at this point in time, absent indications to the contrary, it is something the President should consider staying with."
This Administration’s national security leadership has repeatedly confirmed this.
U.S. military officials, past and present, have said that Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement and that it is in the best national security interest of our nation to keep it in place.
I strongly disagree with the President’s decision to end U.S. participation in an agreement that constrains Iran’s nuclear program and helps prevent the regime from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.

While I appreciate Director Pompeo’s willingness to serve and plan to work with him to protect U.S. interests if he is confirmed, I simply believe that the threats facing our Nation today need a Secretary of State with greater diplomatic experience...
Most military and intelligence experts agree that torture is ineffective and makes us less safe.
Director Pompeo has refused to rule out torture as an intelligence gathering mechanism, saying that he would consider whether extreme practices outside the Army Field Manual need to be revisited.
We need a Secretary of State who will represent all Americans to the international community.
Director Pompeo supports policies that I believe will make our Nation less safe and his record on issues like torture and the Iran nuclear agreement, as well as his prior statements regarding American Muslims are troubling.
After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.
I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues throughout Congress to ensure that the Opioid Crisis Response Act is passed and signed into law.
Whether working to prevent illicit fentanyl trafficking, helping opioid-dependent mothers and infants or assisting in the implementation of plans of safe care, these bills will do a great deal to strengthen our defenses as we continue to fight the opioid epidemic.

The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, which authorized military action in Afghanistan and Iraq, are outdated and must be replaced.
Beyond the immediate situation in Syria, it’s time for a sustained debate and vote on a new AUMF that allows our nation to destroy terrorists and fight threats to U.S. national security, but doesn’t result in endless war.
The Administration should seek an authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) by Congress if it wants to continue to military actions against Syrian forces - the same way President Obama sought authorization in 2013 in a similar circumstance involving Syria.
Continued violence in Syria creates a safe haven for terrorists and emboldens our adversaries, Iran and Russia. Sporadic missile strikes and saber rattling on Twitter by President Trump is not a strategy.
The Administration should work towards a political solution that meets the legitimate expectations of the Syrian people and leads to a constitution, elections, rule of law and functioning government ministries.
There is no purely military solution to the Syrian conflict. What’s needed is a diplomatic plan to bring an end to this crisis and hold the Syrian government, the Russians and the Iranians fully accountable for their conduct.
Despite being in office for fifteen months, the Administration has not taken steps to outline a comprehensive strategy for Syria. Further, the Administration has failed to request an authorization from Congress for further military action against Assad’s regime.
In April of 2017, when the Trump Administration first carried out strikes against Syrian forces in response to the use of chemical weapons, I said that additional action required an authorization from Congress
While Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable for his unlawful use of chemical weapons against civilians, the strikes that are being carried out are being done without an authorization from Congress, which is unacceptable

It is critical that the Administration work closely with our allies to tackle these core issues, like global steel overcapacity and intellectual property theft, in a way that holds countries that cheat on trade, like China, accountable.
Trade remedies, like the ones announced today, are but one element of a strategy.
I would also urge them to adopt a more comprehensive strategy - one that gets at the root causes of trade issues.
China’s cheating on trade has fleeced our businesses, cost Pennsylvania workers their jobs, stagnated their wages and harmed our communities. I commend the Administration for taking this step. https://t.co/QnIEiztNYQ

Today, I voted to advance debate on S. J. Res. 54, a debate that, like the broader AUMF questions, is sorely needed and overdue.
Until then, a plain reading of the War Powers Resolution shows that the U.S. is engaged in activities that constitute “hostilities.”
If the Administration wants the authority to continue refueling and other support operations with the Saudis, it should work with Congress to craft a tailored authorization, and then we should debate and vote on it.
For too long, Congress has failed to debate and vote on authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF).
The framers wanted a robust debate between the Executive and Legislative Branches about the grave questions of war and peace, with the final authority to declare war resting with the Congress.

There is no one in D.C. or all of America better prepared to do this job.
With Mr. Mueller’s record as a war hero, a dedicated public servant and an expert in law enforcement, it is hard to imagine anyone better suited to lead the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
Though our political system has become more polarized, each time Mr. Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has received unqualified praise from people across the political spectrum – and rightly so.
His tenure at the FBI, which included leading the response to the 9/11 attacks and spearheading the Bureau’s efforts to combat cybercrime, has been widely praised. In fact, in 2011, as his ten-year term was set to end, we in the Senate voted 100-0 to extend his term until 2013.
In 2001, Mr. Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President, George W. Bush, as the Director of the FBI. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.
There he oversaw cases ranging from the prosecution of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to the Lockerbie bombing.
After serving in U.S. Attorney’s offices in Boston and San Francisco for over a decade, he later served at the Department of Justice, leading the Criminal Division under President George H. W. Bush.
Mr. Mueller not only fought courageously on the battlefield, but upon returning home and earning his law degree, he continued serving his country throughout his legal career.
He sustained a bullet wound when he responded to an ambush by enemy forces on Marines in his command. He received the Navy Commendation Medal with a citation praising him for rushing to save his fellow Marines while “completely disregarding his own safety.”
“Second Lieutenant Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another, directing the accurate counterfire of his men and shouting words of encouragement to them…. [H]e then skillfully supervised the evacuation of casualties from the hazardous fire area.”
He received the Bronze Star for “heroic achievement” after leading his fellow Marines through an eight-hour battle, where, under enemy fire...
As a young man, Mr. Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam War and was awarded a Bronze Star, 2 Navy Commendation Medals, the Purple Heart and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his leadership and exemplary service.
Mr. Mueller’s lifetime of service reflects his commitment to serving the American people with honor, integrity and courage.
Special Counsel Mueller was appointed to investigate an attack on our nation by a foreign adversary. @realDonaldTrump’s refusal to support the investigation into this attack endangers our national security. https://t.co/e3GkXg2iVA
.@realDonaldTrump continues to obstruct Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation and attack law enforcement. Congress should respond by passing a measure to protect the independence of the Special Counsel.
Special Counsel Mueller is conducting an independent investigation into Russia’s attack on our nation during the 2016 election. Any attempt to fire the special counsel would take us into uncharted water.
The continued attacks on law enforcement by @realDonaldTrump and his lackeys must stop. https://t.co/8Q2w5CcfGe

President Trump’s reckless approach is making our nation less safe. Unfortunately, today’s hurried announcements are consistent with that approach.
Deputy Director Gina Haspel’s nomination to be CIA Director also raises significant concerns in light of reports about her participation and oversight of programs involving the torture of detainees. Torture is not only morally wrong; it is a terrorist recruiting tool.
Instead of speaking out forcefully about Russia’s attack on our nation during the 2016 election, he’s parroted President Trump’s political agenda of obstruction and deception.
I have concerns, for example, regarding his past support of interrogation policies that amount to torture. He’s been the most partisan and political CIA Director in recent memory.
It’s critical to our national security that the Administration operates in a way that demonstrates competence and stability. Also, Director Mike Pompeo’s nomination to be Secretary of State raises several serious questions.
While I opposed Secretary Tillerson’s nomination and had significant concerns about his leadership of the State Department, I find the chaotic nature of today’s announcement troubling.

We need a debate now, not weak policy papers from this Administration.
Congress should have a sustained debate and series of votes on gun violence and pass measures to put in place universal background checks, ban military-style assault weapons, limit large-capacity magazines, and ban those on the Terror Watchlist from possessing a firearm.
They should do that now.
Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan are the congressional leaders with the power to bring legislation to reform our gun laws to the floor.
Washington special interests are using their influence with this Administration and Congressional Republicans to block commonsense action on gun violence. It has to stop.

When the playing field is level, Pennsylvania workers can out-compete any workers in the world. It’s vital to hold countries that cheat on trade accountable in order to protect Pennsylvanians’ jobs and a good standard of living.
We must go after China and other trade cheaters, with our allies, the only way they’ll understand –head on. Workers across Pennsylvania know what unfair trade has brought —job losses and stagnant wages.
Specifically, the Administration should consider additional action on downstream products, like transformer cores, without which foreign producers could undermine domestic production of electrical steel and put Pennsylvania jobs at risk.
When foreign countries cheat on trade, Pennsylvania workers lose their jobs. I commend the Administration for taking action. I also urge the Administration to use the next 15 days, until these trade remedies take effect, to improve and refine this order.

It has taken the Administration far too long, but today’s announcement of an intention to act next week is a welcome step.
I have repeatedly called on this and previous Administrations to aggressively enforce our trade laws. For years, foreign countries have been dumping steel into our markets and costing our workers their jobs and suppressing their wages.

Congressional Republicans and @realDonaldTrump have, once again, betrayed the Dreamers, some of whom are serving in our military right now, and broken faith with the values of our nation, while failing to support effective border security.
That legislation would have secured the border, addressed the problem of illegal immigration and provided a fair pathway to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants. That’s how we will fix our immigration system.
In 2013, I voted for a bipartisan, comprehensive reform of our immigration system, which achieved 68 votes in the Senate.
It’s clear that Congressional Republicans and @realDonaldTrump don’t care about the Dreamers or securing our border. They blow hot air about these young people but don’t act. Their only plan is to deport eleven million people, which is unworkable and unrealistic.
Many Republicans in Congress and President Trump created the Dreamers crisis. Now, they have torpedoed every bipartisan proposal, even one that funds President Trump’s border wall, to solve the mess they created.

These measures can reduce the likelihood of a mass shooting and the members of Congress who set the agenda on the floors of the House and Senate should act.
Congress should have votes on measures to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks, a ban on military-style weapons and a prohibition of those on the terror watchlist from purchasing firearms.
America is a great nation and I refuse to believe there’s nothing we can do to reduce the likelihood of mass shootings.
In the wake of yet another school shooting, the 18th of this year, we should pray for the victims and their families but those of us in public office are obligated to act to reduce gun violence.
I pray for the families whose lives have been shattered by yet another school shooting –18th of 2018. Congress must do its part to confront these senseless tragedies. Inaction is unacceptable.

One worker said of the Administration, “They’ve sat on this for far too long.” He’s right. It’s time for the Administration to put our workers first.”
Steel executives wrote the President this month telling him that “now is the time for Presidential action to prevent excess steel capacity and surging steel imports from undermining our national security and the viability of the U.S. steel industry.”
In Conshohocken, Arcelor Mittal announced they were laying off almost 200 steelworkers last year because they are being harmed by unfair trade practices.
AK Steel in Butler, Pennsylvania is the only domestic producer of electrical steel. When Hurricane Sandy hit, they helped repair our damaged grid. Now, they need our help to guard against trade cheating.
They have lived under the stress of this Administration’s inaction for too long.
Our steelworkers are getting the short end of the stick because foreign countries are cheating on trade. Workers in Pennsylvania have watched imports surge since the announcement of the steel investigation last April.
just got back from a meeting at the White House with President Trump and Administration officials on trade policy. While I commend the Administration for convening today’s meeting, the time for talk about standing up for our steelworkers has passed. It’s time for action.

Today @SpeakerRyan revealed that he and Congressional Rs are totally out of touch. Their tax scam contains limited and temporary relief for many hardworking families while the big corporations get permanent tax giveaways. It’s wrong.
According to the Tax Policy Center, by 2017 83% of the tax cuts go to the top 1% by 2027.
In 2019, $36.853 billion in tax cuts will go to individuals making over $1 million a year. Providing an average annual tax cut of $64,428 ($5,369 a month) for households making over a million dollars
Based on the non-partisan assessment of the Joint Committee on Taxation in 2019, over 57 million households making under $100,000 a year will see a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $9 a month
I wonder why? Maybe the whole point of he GOP tax scam was to give the super-rich and big corporations a windfall?
@SpeakerRyan During the tax debate I offered an amendment to make sure workers see a wage increase commensurate with any increase in executive compensation, stock buy backs and dividends payments. Every single one of my Republican Colleagues voted against that amendment
Hey @SpeakerRyan how about we vote on a bill to end the GOP tax scam’s giveaways to the top 1% &amp; big corporations and give that money to hardworking people in PA who are only receiving a $1.50 increase in their paycheck? https://t.co/VKaomiptoD

Will House Republicans be watchdogs or lapdogs? Their weakness endangers our nation.
When it comes to Russia’s attacks on our democracy, the American people need vigilant watchdogs who are prudent and honest. Republican members of Congress have failed to serve as an independent check and balance on President Trump.
Russia attacked our nation during the 2016 election, yet many Republican members of Congress are so weak on national security that they would rather obstruct this investigation than protect our nation.
The FBI, which is led by Trump-nominated Director Christopher Wray, has said “we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”
President Trump’s own Justice Department has called the release of this propaganda memo “extraordinarily reckless” and said that DOJ is “currently unaware of any wrongdoing related to the FISA process…”
For months, House Republicans have conducted a coordinated smear campaign against law enforcement, especially the men and women of the FBI who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe from criminals and terrorists.
This release indicates that many House Republicans have proven once again that, in the Mueller probe, they are recklessly deferential to President Trump, weak on national security and hostile to law enforcement.

Congress sees this threat clearly: we voted on a bipartisan basis last year to enact tough new sanctions on Putin, his cronies, and the Russian entities who sow instability.
The Russia threat isn’t just about election interference, it’s occupation of Crimea, support for the Assad regime in Syria, manipulating the energy supply to Europe, widespread corruption, and so much more.

Republicans in Washington &amp; @realDonaldTrump provoked this shutdown &amp; created this crisis because of their failure to focus on the middle class. I will hold them accountable on the promises they have made
It’s time for Senate Rs to use the upcoming period of time to stop genuflecting to the extreme right and their corporate benefactors and work in a bipartisan way to get results for families in Pennsylvania
I will be pushing for increased  funding for our veterans, the opioid crisis, community health centers, disaster funding and basic security for retired coal miners and other workers whose pensions are at risk. We also need a fair solution for the Dreamers
Now, 12 Republican Senators have come forward and agreed to work w/ Dems on a range of issues over a short period of time
Washington Republicans have repeatedly failed to address the nation’s challenges on behalf of the middle class. They have been maniacally obsessed w/ tax giveaways to the super-rich &amp; big corporations &amp; decimating Medicaid
And when the Children’s Health Insurance Program lapsed over 100 days ago, @HouseGOP were obsessed w/ tax cuts for the super rich. Now, extreme House Rs talk as if they give a damn about kids. I’m not fooled and neither are the American people.
The @HouseGOP funding bill doesn’t adequately fund the opioid crisis. I’ve been pushing a $45B investment that would help all of PA, including Cambria county where the crisis is acute https://t.co/qAidEfodYx
The @HouseGOP funding deal also left behind retired PA coal miners &amp; other workers whose pensions are at risk. 12,638 mineworkers in PA are in need Congress to act. This funding bill should protect those pensions but it doesn’t
The @HouseGOP funding scheme also failed to adequately fund community health centers, which families throughout PA rely on for care. They were too busy cutting taxes for big corporations.
@KeithRothfus The @HouseGOP funding bill failed to adequately fund a program called “Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.” It ensures at-risk pregnant women and young children are healthy &amp; safe. Cambria county families have been served by it  	https://t.co/zbE02y1Y10
Extreme House Republicans, including @KeithRothfus, have spent the last year trying to cut taxes for the super-rich &amp; big corporations and rip away health care coverage instead of working for the middle class. Their funding deal left PA families behind. Let’s exmaine it
Instead, they cynically decided to hold the health care of children hostage to demand a ransom of votes for yet another short-term continuing resolution full of holes. This is no way to govern.
Then they had all of October to reauthorize CHIP, yet they did nothing on children's health insurance. They had all of November, yet they did nothing on children's health insurance. They had all of December, yet they did nothing on children's health insurance.
They had the power to fund CHIP BEFORE it expired. They let it expire. https://t.co/5CTZhbWvO7
The bipartisan bill to reauthorize the program passed unanimously out of the Finance Committee last fall. The Republican majority had the opportunity to bring a bill to the floor before CHIP expired.
Let's be clear; the Republicans let the CHIP program expire back in September. https://t.co/5CTZhbWvO7
I am a cosponsor of the No Government No Pay Act, which ensures that members of Congress do not receive pay during a government shutdown. I will not take my Senate salary during the GOP shutdown &amp; will donate it to charity

Yesterday, I cosponsored the Pay Our Military Act that ensures military personnel receive regular paychecks and related compensation during a shutdown. We should pass it now
Rs in Washington, who control the House, Senate and White House, have provoked this shutdown by refusing to move forward on bipartisan agreements to help PA families. 	https://t.co/zdwHV7aBOV
Republicans should immediately reopen the government so that we can stay in session until we reach a commonsense agreement.
Instead, Republicans in Washington spent months working to pass massive tax cuts for their big corporate donors. Now all of a sudden they pretend like they care? If they truly cared for children like they cared for big corporations then the CHIP extension would be permanent.
For over 100 days, Republicans didn’t do a damn thing for kids impacted by the lapse in reauthorization of the Children’s House Insurance Program (CHIP).
I was not elected to genuflect to the demands of extreme House Republicans. I have an obligation to fight for the millions of families left out of this bill.
There are bipartisan agreements in place that can help Pennsylvania families, but Republicans gave in to the extreme right wing of their party and walked away.
The Republican funding plan shortchanges our veterans, community health centers, infants and mothers who receive home visitations, retired coal miners and other Pennsylvania workers and those dealing with the opioid crisis.
Republicans who control Congress and President Trump have provoked a government shutdown by refusing to work in a bipartisan way on a funding agreement that protects the middle class, retiree pensioners and 800,000 people who receive health care through community health centers.
I think Pennsylvanians see through this incredibly cynical move and would rather see us work together on a bipartisan compromise.
They didn’t do a damn thing for kids for all these months, over 100 days and now all of the sudden they pretend like they care.
It’s diabolical the way Republicans are using the CHIP program as a weapon instead of passing the reauthorization back when it expired in September.

Teaching health centers focus on primary care in medically underserved areas.  Like CHIP and CHCs, teaching health centers need certainty and it is our responsibility to provide it.
Residents training in the 56 centers across 26 states, including at the Wright Center in Scranton Pennsylvania, need certainty that they will not be left without a place to train.
House Republicans did not extend funding for Teaching Health Centers in their continuing resolution, despite having bipartisan support.
It's an insult. It's an insult to middle class families. It's an insult to retires. It's an insult to our military. It's an insult to everybody.
.@SpeakerRyan defers over and over again to this group of extremists, and that's how you get this bill last night that's full of holes- A bill that was negotiated by the @freedomcaucus, with the @freedomcaucus, and with only @freedomcaucus priorities in mind.
Republicans have total control of two branches of government, and they can't keep the lights on because they're genuflecting to their extreme far-right colleagues in the House.
We can get all of this done if Republicans just figure out a way to govern their own party, but right now the Repubublicans running the House and Senate don't seem like they could organize a one-car parade.
What's so frustrating about this is that we have already negotiated bipartisan agreements to fix these issues- bills that are supported by Democrats and Republicans.
The Republicans talk about including CHIP, but thousands of children in Pennsylvania get their care from community health centers which they allowed to expire on September 30th of last year. That's an urgent matter.
A fix for pension plans, including the coal miners that @realDonaldTrump promised to help, is not in this bill. That's an urgent matter.
Funding for fighting the opioid crisis is not in this bill. That's an urgent matter.
Funding for community health centers is not in the bill. That's an urgent matter for 800,000 Pennsylvanians who use them.
It's not a bill that can pass and that's because it has gaping holes on a serious of urgent matters. @SenateMajLdr talked about urgency last night so let's go through what he left out.

Once again, congressional Republicans and the Administration have put forth a funding deal that insults the middle class. It’s time to pass a funding agreement that will help the middle class, not a bad deal cooked up by Washington Republicans and special interests.
Republican politicians spent months trying to rip health care away from Pennsylvanians by decimating Medicaid, while providing giveaways to the super-rich.
Congress should stay in session until an agreement is reached that provides funding for rural health care, our veterans, our workers, retirees, national security and the Dreamers.
Democrats like me are ready to negotiate bipartisan agreements for the American people.
However, Republicans want to force the government shutdown that the President has wanted for months.
There are bipartisan agreements in place that would solve these challenges. For example, no fewer than seven Senate Republicans have joined with Senate Democrats on a bipartisan deal to improve border security and help young Dreamers.
House Republicans will pass a bill that shortchanges community health centers, our military, veterans, retired coal miners whose pensions are at risk, those impacted by the opioid crisis and young people who were brought to this country as children.
Even with one-party rule, Republicans have failed to demonstrate that they can govern or keep their promises to many Americans.
Republicans have spent the last year obsessed with cutting Medicaid which adversely impacts middle class families, children, seniors and individuals with disabilities, while handing out tax cuts to the super wealthy and big corporations and their CEOs.
Washington Republicans spent the entire year working to undermine the middle class and ramming their right wing agenda through Congress.

@CDCgov @USCG @TSA @fema Under the GOP tax plan, over 57 million households making under $100,000 a year will see a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $9 a month in 2019 (JCT Table D-17-58).
@CDCgov @USCG @TSA @fema Larger than the annual appropriated budget for WIC – food assistance for women, infants and children;
@CDCgov @USCG @TSA Larger than the annual appropriated budget for @FEMA.
@CDCgov @USCG Larger than the annual appropriated budget for the @TSA;
@CDCgov Larger than the annual appropriated budget for the @USCG;
The tax windfall for these 6 big banks is larger than the annual appropriated budget for the @CDCgov;
$13 billion could also fund 2.2 million maximum Pell Grant awards of $5,920 – Pell Grants help low-income kids pay for college.
Altogether our nation’s 6 biggest Wall Street banks stand to net at least an additional $13 billion in tax cuts this year. That’s 16 times larger than the cost of the CHIP reauthorization.
Goldman Sachs could also gain hundreds of millions in tax cuts this year;
Morgan Stanley stands to gain $833 million in tax cuts this year – that’s about the same as the cost of the CHIP reauthorization;
Bank of America stands to gain $3.5 billion in tax cuts this year – that’s more than 4 times larger than the cost of the CHIP reauthorization;
JP Morgan stands to gain $3.3 billion in tax cuts this year – that’s 4 times larger than the cost of the CHIP reauthorization;
Citibank stands to gain $1.4 billion in tax cuts this year – that’s almost 2 times the cost of the CHIP reauthorization;
According to Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo would gain $3.7 billion in tax cuts this year – that’s over 4 times larger than the cost of the CHIP reauthorization;
This tax bill is a massive tax giveaway to the super-rich and big profitable corporations. Let’s look at what the billions in tax windfall to Wall Street banks could buy us.
Meanwhile, Republicans rammed $9.5 trillion in tax changes through Congress in 49 days.
Republicans are holding the healthcare of 9 million kids hostage over the “cost” of the CHIP reauthorization - $800 million.

Our entire state is thankful for the work of law enforcement in Harrisburg last evening. Our brave law enforcements officers took extraordinary risks last night, as they do daily, to keep us safe
Instead of passing a bill, which stiffs kids, our law enforcement officers and fails to protect the Dreamers, members of Congress should stay in town and address these issues.
Rs who run Congress had all the time in the world to cut taxes for the super-rich and big corporations &amp; now are urgently skipping town before families who rely on CHIP have peace of mind in knowing that their kids’ health care will continue beyond a matter of weeks
It’s outrageous that Republicans in Congress are rushing to go home for Christmas instead of fully reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program and addressing other vital priorities

I will not stand by as Republicans in Washington plot to cut these vital programs for the middle class, especially after they passed into law these tax giveaways for big corporations and the super-rich.
This whole scheme is a gut punch to the middle class. And now, Republicans in the House and the Senate are saying their next step is to go after Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
The 90 million American households making under $50,000 a year will only see a fraction of that. By 2027, the Republican tax plan gives 83% of the cuts to the top 1%. To make matters worse, the GOP tax plan creates an incentive to offshore jobs.
Instead of reauthorizing CHIP, which has now expired, or investing in infrastructure, congressional Republicans have passed a tax plan that gives over $36 billion dollars in 2019 to the country’s richest 572,000 households – those making over $1 million a year.
The GOP tax scheme is a raw deal for Pennsylvania families. The middle class is getting the short end of the stick while the super-rich and big corporations get a windfall.
I will never understand the pleasure that the @SenateGOP takes in ripping health care away from millions of Americans. https://t.co/VctmmFQV7q

The GOP tax/health care scheme was just passed out of committee: massive giveaways to the super-rich &amp; big corporations, higher taxes for 13.8 million households making under $200K, higher premiums for PA families, 13 million fewer Americans w/o health care. It must be defeated
We are trying to work with the @SenateGOP to make this bill better but they have yet to approve a single one of our amendments. https://t.co/l5hp4peIZ6
The 572,000 people who make more than $1,000,000/yr get a combined $39 billion in tax cuts while the 90,000,000 taxpayers who make less than $50K split $14 billion. https://t.co/r1l6TZg2cf

On Veterans Day, we come together to honor the courageous actions of our brave men and women who have served to defend our nation. Our Armed Forces have always answered the call to duty, and Veterans should have every opportunity and resource they need when they return home.

I have been critical of administrations of both parties, including the Obama Administration, for failing to protect our workers and take on China’s trade cheating.
The Commerce Department has worked diligently on this issue but the White House is delaying their work in order to push a tax scheme that puts the wealthy first.
The Administration can protect Pennsylvania workers today by taking action on China’s illegal subsidies and dumping of aluminum and steel.
Instead of giving China a pass, President Trump should be holding China accountable. For months, the Administration has talked about taking action against China’s cheating but all we get is delay.

The opioid epidemic is a national emergency and we must respond with real investments in treatment.
The GOP must also stop pursuing health care schemes to decimate Medicaid, which would deny Americans’ coverage for substance use disorders.
Good treatment, over a sustained period of time, gives those with an opioid dependence the best shot at overcoming this challenge.
Since March, I’ve held nine meetings across Pennsylvania to discuss the need to address opioid dependence.
In order to help families suffering from the opioid crisis, there must be substantial investments in treatment and increased access to care.
This bill would invest $45 billion over 10 years to fund opioid treatment and prevention, as well as research on pain and addiction.

In Pennsylvania, 3.4 million dependent exemptions were claimed in 2015 https://t.co/IMxOyGUOrG
Under current law, the personal exemption deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent on a return. The GOP plan eliminates this deduction
These estates are worth $5.5M for an individual or $10.98M per couple. Unless yours is worth that much, this doesn’t benefit your family.
The GOP plan also eliminates the estate tax, creating a huge windfall for the super-rich. This only helps 140 total estates in PA.
But the 14,260 PA millionaires would receive 53.6% of the tax cuts in GOP plan.
The PA families making between $41,200 and $64,900 who do benefit see only 8% of the total benefits of the tax plan. https://t.co/dtoiZJt2vo
That $794 in increased taxes could have paid for 1 month of child care, 6.8 months of electric bills, or 2.1 months of health care premiums.
In PA, 1.3 million households deduct mortgage interest. The GOP plan makes this deduction less useful unless your house is worth over $800K.
In PA, 1.8 million households use the state and local tax deduction. Average deduction =$11,248. The GOP plan eliminates this deduction.

Coming up on @hardball at 7:30pm to talk about how GOP tax plan is a massive giveaway to wealthy at expense of the middle class
This compromise is an opportunity for Rs to end their pursuit of repeal and work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system.
In order for this legislation to benefit PA families, @realDonaldTrump must stop the sabotage of our health care system.

This @realDonaldTrump premium tax will make it harder for middle class families to make ends meet.
So far Rs refuse to serve as an independent check and balance on @realDonaldTrump sabotage of our health care system
These premium increases are a direct result of @realDonaldTrump’s sabotage of our health care system. This sabotage must be stopped. https://t.co/xd6m13kRNA

I will review @realDonaldTrump strategy &amp; legislative proposals but will not support something that would violate the Iran nuclear agreement
The U.S. should not walk away from Iran nuclear agreement
JCPOA represents best available option for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability &amp; enhancing visibility of program
While I look forward to reviewing @realDonaldTrump Iran strategy, his decision not to make certifications could imperil JCPOA
This decision by @realDonaldTrump means higher premiums &amp; higher deficits. It’s a middle class wrecking ball. https://t.co/CDMTRozkaT
.@realDonaldTrump must abandon this destructive, partisan approach and work to improve our health care system and end the sabotage
Congress must act to reverse this sabotage. If @realDonaldTrump is unwilling to follow the law then Congress must force him to.
The Administration’s decision will raise premiums, cost middle class families more of their hard-earned dollars and cause havoc in markets
These payments ensure health care is affordable for millions of Americans. This cruel act will only harm our families.
The Administration just confirmed this act of sabotage. @realDonaldTrump is placing a 20% premium tax on PA families. It is wrong. https://t.co/Y1UjmVDVXQ
It’s clear @realDonaldTrump &amp; Congressional Rs have a maniacal obsession w/ repeal. Taking this step would directly harm PA families. https://t.co/vgBb1DXWre
If @realDonaldTrump takes this reckless act, premiums for PA families will skyrocket. The sabotage of our health care system must end. https://t.co/vgBb1DXWre
This destructive act by the Administration threatens to undermine those bipartisan efforts.
.@PattyMurray and @SenAlexander have been making progress toward bipartisan legislation that would improve our health care system.
Instead of hurting families and seniors, they should work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system.
These schemes have been soundly rejected, yet the Administration is now trying to enact them via executive order.
They have put forth legislative schemes that would drive up premiums, increase costs and reduce protections.
They have a maniacal obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. That obsession is harming families across the nation.
This executive order is trying to return us to the days when you could buy junk insurance – it was cheap, because it didn’t cover much.
Instead, @POTUS and Republicans in Congress have engaged in a sabotage of our health care system, which has driven up premiums and costs.
For nine months, the Admin &amp; congressional Republicans have abdicated their basic obligation to make sure our health care system works.
This is a sabotage of our health care system by executive order. https://t.co/s6uIsQXxh4

My response to @realDonaldTrump’s remarks on the GOP tax plan. https://t.co/3Ou6zek9Xo
Nearly 90% of lower tax rate cut would go to the top 1%, this is because most small businesses don’t pay anything close to the top tax rate. https://t.co/epTymKXIsd
Small business can already write off $500K in investments b/c of work @SenatorCollins &amp; I did in 2015 to make the 179 deduction permanent
Republican plan gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations; their budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.
Fact Check - According to non-partisan @USCBO, profitable corporations have an effective tax rate of 18.6%.
Worth more than $11 million? No? Guess what, the estate tax does not apply to you.
Repealing the estate tax would give $27 billion a year to America’s 5,500 richest families.
.@POTUS says tax cuts go to the middle class. Fact Check: top 0.1% (income above $3,439,900) get an avg tax cut of $747,580 in 2018.
Under the Republican plan, a family of four would gain $11,300 in standard deduction, and simultaneously LOSE $16,200 in personal exemptions
Tax on a single piece of paper? We already have it. It’s called the 1040EZ
Fact Check: Average tax cut for the top 1% is $146,470. Plan INCREASES the tax rate from 10% to 12% on family income below $18,650.
Oh and increasing the tax rate on family income below $18,650 from 10% to 12% 🙄
How do they make up the rest? With $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/fVLsVVyWZg
Their own budget reconciliation bill allows them to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That’s a lot of zeros. https://t.co/7deyiHKzZw
So does the GOP place any value in reducing the deficit? Let’s take a look at their budget.
.@JoeBiden has said "Don’t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value."
In total, the GOP tax plan gives almost 3 trillion in tax cuts to wealthy Americans and profitable corporations over the next 10 years.
That’s equivalent to the total annual funding for Pell grants ($22.5 billion FY17) and WIC ($6.35 billion).
Repealing the estate tax would reduce revenue by roughly $27 billion/year.
That’s equal to entire FY17 budget for the @CDCgov ($7.2B), the FAA ($16.4B), the @TSA ($7.78) and the @USCG ($10.45B).
The GOP’s purposed changes to the top individual tax bracket will reduce revenue by about $42 billion/year.
That’s equal to the entire FY17 budget for the @NIH ($34.1 billion), @CustomsBorder ($14.3 billion), and @FEMA ($11.6 billion) combined.
The purposed GOP cuts for Pass-through/S-corps will reduce revenue by roughly $60 billion/year.
That’s equal to our military’s annual personnel costs (salary, healthcare, retirement contributions, etc) PLUS NASA’s entire annual budget.
Let’s start with the proposed cut to the corporate tax rate: $1.5 trillion over 10 years or $150 billion/year.
So just how much would we have to cut to keep the deficit the same? Take a look at the numbers.
How, you ask? By definition, tax cuts reduce revenue. If you don't make cuts equal to that reduction, you increase the deficit.
Republicans are now proposing to wipe that away with a budget and tax plan that will drastically increase the deficit.
In 2011, under the Budget Control Act Republicans and Democrats came to an agreement on $1 trillion in deficit reduction measures.
There are only two ways to reduce the deficit: bring in more revenue or decrease spending.
Thread #2: The GOP talks a lot about the importance of reducing our national budget deficit.
The only ones who benefit from the GOP pass-through rate reduction are the super-rich hedge fund managers and real estate developers. https://t.co/C0rJPTdqYV
Most small businesses using pass-through already pay less than the proposed GOP rate. https://t.co/dpn7TfYRho
GOP tries to sell the ‘pass-through’ loophole as being good for small business, yet 90% of the benefits go to the top 1%.
This is why @realDonaldTrump's budget is "out of whack," not because a hurricane devastated Puerto Rico.
That’s right, this hedge fund manager loophole dwarfs the entire budget of the primary department responsible for responding to emergencies.
In context, this new loophole = FY17 budgets of NIH, Customs &amp; Border Protection &amp; FEMA COMBINED.
Changing the pass-through rate will lower taxes for hedge fund managers &amp; real estate developers, adding $600B to the deficit over 10 years.
This new loophole is accomplished through something called a ‘pass-through.’
First up, a look at how this plan creates new, special loopholes for super-rich hedge fund managers &amp; wealthy real estate developers.
And throughout the day on Twitter, I'll address some of the more egregious flaws in this tax plan.
Today in Philadelphia, I'll highlight how the GOP tax plan also RAISES taxes on the middle class to help fund these same giveaways.
Yesterday, I met with seniors in Lancaster to highlight how this plan cuts Medicare to fund giveaways to super-rich. https://t.co/hXUba0oZWn
Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county.

They can guarantee that taxes will go down for the ultra-rich but can't guarantee that taxes won't increase for the middle class?
At WH press briefing Gary Cohn once again failed to guarantee that no middle class family will see their taxes go up under Admin’s plan.
Under the Republican plan, a family of four would gain $11,300 in standard deduction, and simultaneously lose $16,200 in personal exemptions
Take this example for a married couple with two kids and a household income of 70K. They end up paying $288 MORE under the GOP plan. https://t.co/smyyYsSHx6
This creates a shell game that could cost middle class families more.
However, there’s always a catch: the GOP plan also eliminates the “personal exemption."
In the coming months, you will hear a lot from the GOP about “doubling the standard deduction.”
Let’s examine how a middle class family could pay more under the GOP tax plan.

So if the GOP pass their tax plan, what will they do to offset the deficit increase? Move to cut Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
In their healthcare scheme, Congressional Rs pushed to decimate funding for Medicaid.
.@SpeakerRyan and the @HouseGOP have repeatedly tried to end Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher program.
They've tried this before- In the early 2000s, the GOP moved to privatize Social Security following a massive tax cut for the wealthy.
The GOP tax plan would also rack up massive deficits which could lead to cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
They preserve tax deductions for big business &amp; sheltering corporate profits while eliminating one of the biggest for the middle class.
This is particularly hard on the middle-class. In PA 86% of taxpayers claiming state and local deduction make under $200K, 52% under 100K.
The GOP tax plan also eliminates the state and local deduction, meaning middle-class families would be taxed twice on their hard-earned pay.
Claiming to double the standard deduction is also misleading. Read @jbarro on how the middle class may pay more. https://t.co/LxuaPe2sRc
In fact, in a gut punch to workers and their families, they actually raise the bottom tax bracket. https://t.co/71xSL7KVWC
The GOP tax plan would lower the top tax bracket, meaning a massive tax cut for those at the very top.
From the @CenterOnBudget "Contrary to repeal proponents’ rhetoric, the estate tax affects very few small farms and businesses"
The GOP tax plan ends the Estate tax, which only helps 5,200 of America’s wealthiest families. https://t.co/o0pD3H22VP

Graham-Cassidy has always been about chasing the ideological trophy of 'repeal.' It will hurt families and is deepy shameful.
But Graham-Cassidy isn't about improving health care for Americans and never has been.
The sham process underway for Graham-Cassidy would be inexplicable if the purpose was to actually improve our health care system

.@ITEPtweets estimates that the 1.3 million young people enrolled in or eligible for DACA pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes.
@CatoInstitute And would result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.
According to the @CATOInstitute, deporting DACA recipients would cost more than $60 billion.
Tearing apart the lives of these young people will make our nation less safe, and harm our economy.
President Trump’s action today is an insult to America and our values. It is unjust, immoral and without regard for basic fairness.
Our government promised them that they would be protected if they came forward and now President Trump is breaking that promise.
They have been law-abiding residents who have learned English, paid taxes and secured jobs that support themselves and their families.
The ‘Dreamers’ are young people who have lived in our country since they were children.
It'll cost us jobs, it'll hurt our security. It's a total betrayal of the trust of the federal government.

I was hopeful that by now @realDonaldTrump would heed bipartisan calls and fully amend his weak response to yesterday's domestic terror.
Our nation should never tolerate their racism or their violent acts.
All of us have an obligation to clearly state that hateful, racist, white nationalist groups were responsible for yesterday’s terrorism.
The terrorist who committed yesterday’s violent act must be held fully accountable.
I’m also praying for the law enforcement officers who lost their lives as well, Pilot Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates.
Today our nation mourns for Heather Heyer, who was murdered in yesterday’s domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, and her family.
Our nation must stand together and condemn this racism and those who promote it.
Those marching to promote "white nationalism" are promoting a blatantly racist ideology.

For people with disabilities, slashing Medicaid is anti-freedom. It’s not a key. It’s a prison.
Don’t be fooled by empty promises and lofty rhetoric about health care and freedom. Slashing Medicaid doesn’t give anyone freedom.
They would set disabilities rights back decades, back to institutions.
The Republican health care bills will take away that freedom and liberty.
Medicaid, coupled with legislative and judicial victories, represents freedom and liberty to people with disabilities.
Medicaid helps people with disabilities to go to work. To live in their communities. To have families.
The Medicaid program was the financial support that made those hard won rights something tangible and real.
The Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, the Olmstead decision were all critical advances in the right to self-determination.
The last 50 years have been a period of steady progress for people with disabilities.  They have fought for and won their liberty.
Robbed of their freedom, their right to self-determination, and usually put in horrific institutions to rot.
For much of history, people with disabilities were treated as less than human.
This is a perversion, especially when considering the impact on the rights of people with disabilities.  Some history is helpful here.
They say that getting rid of the health care of tens of millions is, perversely, consistent with American value of self-determination.
We’ve heard a lot of lofty rhetoric from Republicans about freedom and liberty.
It would appear that the “lowest common denominator” for the @SenateGOP is ripping millions of people off their health coverage. https://t.co/W7IjB12w00

This allows Medicaid to be decimated, does nothing for coverage but is a nice political talking point for a few Senate Rs.
This is the exact kind of bribe I warned you about. https://t.co/TxYKIiKjei
My Senate Republican colleagues will have to choose. Judge them on their choice.
There are no amount of deliberately misleading statements or slush funds that can change that.
Are they going to cut care for 20 million and raise premiums for millions more, or are they not?
They are counting on your confusion, but it's really a simple question.
Are you going to vote to jack up premiums, cut coverage for millions, impose an age tax on older workers and decimate Medicaid?
At the end of the week, my Senate Republican colleagues will have a bottom line decision to make.
This obscene bill is fatally flawed, something that hammers the middle class so severely can’t be tweaked.
This health care scheme will be a wrecking ball for middle-class families, children, seniors and individuals with disabilities.
We won’t fall for their nonsense, their slush funds, their state specific giveaways, their do-nothing fixes.
What Senate Republicans are counting on is that you, the American people, get fooled.
But they will allow Republicans Senators to blow hot air and tell their constituents they fixed a problem when the opposite is true.
There will be legislative slush funds for specific Senators. These slush funds won’t make health care more affordable.
That's a scam, here’s a study to prove it. https://t.co/3CzlykNOrP
There will be an amendment for a Medicaid slush fund that the @SenateGOP claims will help those who will lose Medicaid coverage.
Don’t be fooled, here’s an expert who disproves that a fund is a substitute for coverage. https://t.co/OLz7qZVtqv.
The coverage that they will lose when Medicaid is decimated.
People confronting substance abuse don’t need some fund from Washington, they need coverage-
Over the next few days, you’ll see an amendment for a slush fund that Senators will claim helps fight the opioid crisis. It won’t.
Here's what they're betting on: that they can continue to scheme in secret, behind closed doors, cut deals, bribe Senators with slush funds.
Well, today they did and, sadly, I am not shocked.
For weeks, some of my Republican colleagues said they would never vote to move forward on a repeal bill without a replacement.
Approximately 20 million people lose coverage, Medicaid is decimated through cuts, older workers pay an age tax and premiums increase.
But here are the facts: in every scheme put forth by Congressional Republicans-
We’ve heard it all: “health care for everyone” “no one will lose Medicaid” (cc @SecPriceMD)
They have a strategy: confuse. deliberately mislead. lie.
So stuck between their ideological obsession &amp; the will of the American people, Congressional Republicans have chosen to charge forward.
Americans want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care, not scheme in private to strip health care away for millions
They had a big problem though: the protections put in place by the ACA are popular.
Since November, Congressional Republicans have tried to fulfill their long-held ideological obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act
We’re about 30 minutes away from our first health care votes so let’s talk about where we are and what’s coming.

They just cut the funding that actually provides the services.
In an intentional slight of hand, the @SenateGOP claims those on Medicaid are still "eligible"
People will lose coverage because the federal government no longer provides funding and the states can't cover the shortfall.
So by block granting Medicaid, the Senate bill cuts funding by shifting the burden to the States who can't afford it.

@SenateGOP @GovernorTomWolf But when the benefit for which you are eligible has shrunk so much that it no longer covers your costs, is your “eligibility” meaningful?
@SenateGOP @GovernorTomWolf .@SenateGOP claims these Pennsylvanians are still "eligible" for Medicaid...
@SenateGOP @GovernorTomWolf Option 3: cut benefits, enrollment, and/or reimbursement rates resulting in lost jobs and rural hospitals closures.
@SenateGOP @GovernorTomWolf Option 2: cut funding from things like education, road and other infrastructure, or economic development projects.
@SenateGOP @GovernorTomWolf Option 1: Raise taxes to cover the health care costs that Medicaid will no longer cover.
@SenateGOP Under this scenario states &amp; leaders like @GovernorTomWolf face an impossible choice.

@SenateGOP In addition to ending the Medicaid expansion, this scheme makes two fundamental changes, drastically changing the program as we know it.

That means under the GOP health care plan, Pennsylvania will be left with three horrible choices...
The deep cuts to Medicaid as a result of reduced federal match and per capita caps would force an additional $1.1 billion in spending on PA.
PA would see their costs rise by an additional $14.7 billion over ten years just to maintain care for the 702K covered by Medicaid expansion
The federal gov. provided about $13 billion or 56% of the funding for people 	covered by Medicaid in PA in FY16. https://t.co/yn8fNOJoHo

The AHCA will slash healthcare services like nursing, personal care and therapies to children and adults with disabilities and seniors.

Cutting &amp; capping Medicaid will not only take away health care from millions, it will take away their human and civil rights. #NoCapsNoCuts
Well, we’re not going to stand for it. We will not push people back into institutions where people with disabilities are unseen and unheard.
It will turn Medicaid into a program of waiting lists and will push people back into institutions.
Per capita caps will take a knife to state Medicaid budgets.
And make no mistake about it—the proposal to cap the Medicaid reimbursement is another type of cut.
These cuts will fracture an already fragile delivery system that supports aging Americans and those with disabilities.
These cuts will mean great direct service workers who help support people with disabilities will likely lose their jobs.
These cuts will make it impossible for those who need to purchase a wheel chair or an augmentative speaking device.
These cuts will harm hundreds of thousands Pennsylvanians and millions of Americans.
These cuts are tax cuts for the rich. Hiding behind a phrase like “original intent” is cowardly and ignores the real harm they will do.
They say these cuts will bring the Medicaid program back to its original intent. That’s a bold-faced lie.

There are a lot of reasons the @HouseGOP health care plan is bad for PA but here are some...
RT @chesapeakebay: THANK YOU @SenBobCasey for your support of preserving investments for #ChesBay restoration efforts! https://t.co/aunDMTV…
"Pennsylvania could be among the biggest losers in the Affordable Care Act replacement plan." https://t.co/KpJijDklZ7
Some cold water on that pep rally: @HouseGOP would protect "just 5% of people with preexisting conditions" https://t.co/xjAAJuYT9v
Smiling and back-slapping over a bill that raises costs for the middle class, cuts services for seniors and leaves 24M without insurance...
It's outrageous to think that anyone would support legislation that decimates Medicaid – a program designed to help our most vulnerable.
By piling in a bus and heading to the White House to celebrate, @HouseGOP is showing they work for @realDonaldTrump, not the middle class.
What passed today isn’t a health care bill, but a scheme to cut taxes for millionaires and big corporations.
Bring it on. https://t.co/TWNaFkxZ2J
Welp, this tweet didn't age well... https://t.co/3AfJU83Pcj
Pennsylvania has an opioid crisis. The @HouseGOP health care bill would decrease coverage for those suffering. How does that make any sense?
The Upton amendment for those with pre-existing conditions is a joke. Here's a study showing why it won't work. https://t.co/vLBthcDxHq
This @HouseGOP health care bill does not protect those with pre-existing conditions, period. Their solution is just another scheme.
Unreal: under GOP health bill sexual assault is a preexisting condition. https://t.co/AVqxTyGfhR
Also, if @SpeakerRyan is so "giddy" about this bill, then why did he and the @SenateGOP exempt themselves from it? https://t.co/kkbokdDFzH
Maybe @SpeakerRyan is "giddy" about ending protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions?
Is @SpeakerRyan "giddy" about higher costs for cancer patients?
Is @SpeakerRyan "giddy" about cuts to nursing home care for Pennsylvania's seniors?
I can't imagine what has @SpeakerRyan so "giddy." Denying care to individuals with disabilities?
