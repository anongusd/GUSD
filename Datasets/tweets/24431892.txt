The fact that Harris will win California, Warren will win Massachusetts, and Beto (if he runs) Texas, is irrelevant. With proportionate allocation of delegates, second place will still deliver a treasure trove of delegates. Meanwhile, splitting IA and NH's measly hall means zero
Throw in the fact that BIG-ASS delegate-rich states like Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Massachusetts will also be voting March 3 (about a THIRD of all delegates), and it's clear that candidates without the movement and money to contest that entire map are DOA.
People are still unaware that Californians will be voting while Iowa and New Hampshire are happening. Mail-ballots will be in the field, and candidates will have to compete for those HUNDREDS of delegates, rather than the measly dozens in Iowa and NH.
