Dims, globalists and greedy politicians on both sides using the minors to bully Trump are worse than criminals that hide behind children and women so as not to get shot. They are cowardly and playing on emotions! Stand firm Trump!
@RobertGBeckel No. The illegals using minors now are just as cowardly as they criminals who hide behind women and children so as not to get shot. The politicians and craps like you are just as bad. Globalization is not good for America. Watch gumballs on www.nmbersusa and educate yourself!
@foxandfriends She shouldn't have been suspended. ER personnel need a way to deal with people who come in to get narcotics. Doing this shuts ER personnel up because they are too afraid to speak out against the abuse of the system supported by administration in pursuit of a dollar. Tax dollars!
