Their hate for President Trump is greater than their love for America.		Time to secure our border.
In 2006, 26 Senate Democrats voted for The Secure Fence Act, which allowed for 700 miles of fencing along the border.		In 2013, 54 Senate Democrats voted to invest $46B in border security improvements and added 700 miles of fencing.		What's different now?
The House passed funding for the border wall. This is mission critical for our border agents. 		Senate Democrats will use the cloture rule to block this bill. We could end this shutdown fight and deliver wall funding by suspending the Senate cloture rule.
Once Speaker Pelosi takes the gavel, any effort to secure the border will be dead on arrival. The time to act is now.
