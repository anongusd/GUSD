We have one body and one brain and they are connected and you can either feed it with bullshit and drama or you can take care of it the way you would something you love.
Ever since I started working out I have learned about confidence, about pushing myself harder than I would like, dedication, not quitting, focusing on you and not other people and so on. 		I didn't work out last week and was miserable. Doubts came back, shitty habits, depression
you don't want to conform to societal norms, you don't care about body image, you assume the gym is filled with people who will throw you into trash cans, etc.		Here's the thing! It's not about that. Or it doesn't have to be!
Some thoughts on working out from someone who failed high school gym class every year and then resented athletes throughout most of his 20's:		I know that lots of my sweet nerdier (used as a compliment) followers may loathe the idea of going to the gym...

@Simms2673 yes yes yes! I feel the exact same way. Every fight I was SO invested in.
@Simms2673 yeah man! That's the thing. I LOVED all of Daredevil so much but really thought I would like punisher more. I think the character was just SO clear in DD it made the storytelling easy and the violence meaningful.
OK! I fucking love the pilot to season 2 (skipped the rest of season 1) I think what I love about the punisher is simplicity. 		Good man wants to stay good but his sense of right and wrong prevents him from staying out of trouble. 		Then VIOLENCE.

So remember, if you lose the girl, you still had someone who loved you. If you lose 5 pounds but have 30 to go, good keep going. Be realistic without being apathetic. But the most important thing is to go go go. Love you guys.
It's like if you are new to jiujitsu your goal shouldn't be "tap the black belt" it should be "get the shit kicked out of me a little less every day."
Remember if you are setting goals or making resolutions to appreciate the little victories. If your goals are just "lose weight" or "find love" those are easy to feel like you failed if you don't knock it out of the park right away.

@samtripoli you can call it "C.U.N.T.S"
@NikkiGlaser it was awesome. And hilariously the only time we hung out at just for laughs it was us on a dance floor nodding and refusing to dance, talking about our love for DMB.
Man @NikkiGlaser talking about Dancing with the Starts on @joerogan is fucking great and hilarious and sad and inspiring somehow at the same time.

Sober October observation: Holy fuck is booze everywhere. Almost all invites include "let's get a drink" or "bring wine." Drinking is under most peoples HOBBIES on dating sites. It seems impossible to avoid but keep at it young Jedis. @bertkreischer @joerogan @tomsegura
