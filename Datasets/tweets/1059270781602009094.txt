@Helenhs The Democratic nominee should be a policy wonk and have a strong voting record. She or he, should also have a record for working across the isle. We will need independent voters to win. No one is perfect, and each candidate will be picked apart in the general election.
@mikefarb1 Too many disaffected Democrats voted for Trump. We should have had increased turnout in 2016 from 2012. Since presidential elections are every four years, theoretically we should have a higher voter turnout in 2020 from 2016. More ppl are able to vote with each Election.

@JRubinBlogger Anticipating Senator Amy Klobuchar‚Äôs announcement tomorrow! Like Obama, she‚Äôs from the Midwest. Amy won re-election by winning 53 of Trump counties in 2018! She‚Äôs progressive, and knows how to win rural voters. She could be the candidate that unites us all!
@JayHenryMarino1 @thehill I‚Äôve known her personally along with staffers that have worked for her. None of this bears out. The staffer was her press secretary Ben, who now works for Tammy Duckworth. He is the Son of a former Illinois state Rep who also worked with then Senator Barack Obama.
@LauriLinnea @LauraMiers @labmuttz @Susan6366 @amyklobuchar You got it! It‚Äôs all hands on deck. No room for B.S. infighting. We are in it now, for the fight of our life, my children, our democracy! No slicing and dicing!
@LauraMiers @labmuttz @LauriLinnea @Susan6366 @amyklobuchar I just have to say, I know her personally and I know her Press Secretary, Ben on Amy‚Äôs campaign. I‚Äôm good friends with Ben‚Äôs Mother. None of this is true and yet she is a hard working midwestern woman with midwestern values. If she becomes our nominee I will fully support her.
