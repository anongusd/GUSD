Roots by Alex Haley. This @bookguy absolutely loves @TheOrville at this point. I hope the rest of this episode is as good as the first few minutes.

@THErealDVORAK @TheOrville Have you watched the show John? Not only is it an homage to Star Trek, it surpassss all Star Trek content currently available. Plus, most of the talented crew writers and fx artists were pulled from Trek. Give it a shot. I was leery too at first but have become a convert.
Okay, turning off my WIFI so I don't get spoiled for tonight's episode of @TheOrville - THE BEST SCI FI ON TELEVISION (no matter what the russian bots say!)

@pasteyswazey @Liz_Wheeler Don‚Äôt fall for the propaganda. Canadians PAY LESS HEALTH RELATED TAXES than you do and we get full coverage. You get fuck-all and then have to pay cash or pay high insurance premiums. I just walk in with my health card and see a doctor or four.
@pasteyswazey @Liz_Wheeler Preventative medicine isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnot needing to go to your doctor‚Äù it‚Äôs life saving. Cancers caught early, weight loss achieved, etc. You just think that way because you probably don‚Äôt see the doctor until your showing symptoms of illness. Your system is garbage.

@drawandstrike @RealSaavedra @kanyewest @realDonaldTrump Yeah, he did. And yeah, he helped bring the criminal justice stuff to trump‚Äôs desk but trump spoke about this during election. But yeah kanye distances himself after the backlash and all the #OperationMockingbird media calling him crazy.
@RealSaavedra They‚Äôre scared of any celebrity who would dare challenge their narrative. Look how quickly they turned on @kanyewest after he came out in support of @realDonaldTrump ‚Äî so much so @kanyewest has been doing his best to walk it all back.
