3) The Trump administration has sent jumbled signals about when it would be willing to talk. So which is it ‚Äî negotiations any time, or negotiations only after concessions?
2) Today's sanctions will almost certainly be less powerful than they were before 2015 b/c the US is doing this alone. This reduced pressure is supposed to force not just greater nuclear restrictions but also fundamental changes in Iran‚Äôs foreign &amp; domestic policies.
1) The Trump administration‚Äôs demands are not clear.	Is the Trump administration also trying to change Iran‚Äôs domestic policies? None of Pompeo's 12 demands involve changing how Tehran treats its own citizens. And yet his other statements do.

Trump has the opportunity to make two crucial decisions in May. On Iran, the clear choice is to continue to adhere to the agreement...On North Korea, he can take a very important step toward resolving the seemingly intractable nuclear issue.
Critics of the #IranDeal suggest that it creates a nuclear-armed Iran, simply delayed by 15 years. The facts say otherwise. The core of the Iran agreement is an explicit commitment from Iran that it will never seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons. https://t.co/dsUAUFyuj2
