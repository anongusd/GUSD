@GreenSpringRise Gotcha. No problem! So the only thing is we still are required to collect your 1) First and last name 2) Full Address 3) Phone Number 4) Employment status and location. You could send this via private message or email. It's required by Ohio law to accept contributions
@juslikehoney83 Thank you so much for chipping in! It would be impossible to do this without you and the many others who have jumped on board.
@GreenSpringRise Hi there! I do have a pay pal. We use Act Blue usually because it confirms some information we are required to gather. Which would you prefer? Thank you so much for your help!

It is 2017. Women are not an object. They deserve to go about their days without harassment and assault. I was raised by my mother who always told me to think for myself. But also reminded me to never forget that girls run the world. It's time to respect. Women. Period.

Ohio should lead the country in renewables. Appalachia has an abundance of empty rooftops and hilltops. It‚Äôs time to build a renewable bridge to the future and invest in energy. I‚Äôm running to make that happen
5/ Integrity: politicians should know better Han to rig elections. Gerrymandering is a disease on our democracy. It. Must. End. Fair elections. Fair districts. Period. That‚Äôs what my campaign stands for
4/ integrity. 2016 and 2017 have been all time lows for integrity in government. Politicians have lost any sense of a moral compass. Government can be better. We deserve better candidates. And It is my mission to be just that. A candidate with a moral compass
3/ In the Ohio House, ill push strongly for increased access to healthcare and fight back against looming assaults on our people‚Äôs ability to see a doctor when they‚Äôre sick. Healthcare isn‚Äôt political, it‚Äôs personal. It‚Äôs life or death. And it just be available to Ohioans
2/ and water lines. We have earned the opportunity to rebuild our communities. And the state House has a large role to play in that. I‚Äôll push for widespread investment in road rebuilding and broadband expansion
1/ Let‚Äôs talk about some of the reason‚Äôs I‚Äôm running for Ohio House: infrastructure. Appalachia has been left behind for too long. Our resources have been taken and our sons and daughter serve disproportionally in the armed services. We deserve a chance to rebuild our roads...
