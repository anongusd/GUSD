It should be about any time, any place, any pace and any way. We shouldn’t put constraints on people. Let’s get out of the way and create a seamless system where employers and educators can collaborate to educate and create talent. https://t.co/JhfFlKm47p

I just want to thank each and every legislator who has been working hard and giving their time to end this opioid abuse epidemic.
It's not one action that is going to solve this opioid abuse epidemic, we need to look at the whole system to find ways to improve it.
"If we have a shot at [ending this epidemic], we need to get the general public to get engaged. We can win this thing." - Mike Hirst
"We are all being affected by [opioid abuse] in one way or another, we have to educate we have to talk about this." - @andyschor
"Prescription drug and opioid abuse is not a partisan issue, it's not a republican or a democrat issue." - @andyschor
"I'm pleased with how much we've already accomplished because of work legislators have done, but we still have a long way to go." - Judge D.
"We have to change the culture of what American people think. We need to change the stigma that goes with addiction." -Judge Davis
"This is a problem that is more than just a death toll, it is affecting each &amp; everyone of us every day." - Judge Davis
"We should make sure we are doing everything that we can to save lives, we want to have more second chances and less funerals" @LtGovCalley
We need to support each other, and ultimately come together to stop this epidemic.
We've done a lot of good things to combat opioid abuse, but to be blunt, we need to do more.
I want to compliment our judicial system in terms of what we've done with drug treatment courts.
In terms of opioid abuse we've done some great things, but we need to work harder.
I think we did good work with the Good Samaritan law that was put into place, but we need continue to work hard to combat this problem.
I appreciate having representatives from law enforcement here to discuss the work we're doing to combat this opioid problem.
We need to be a leader here in MI in terms of fighting this opioid abuse epidemic.
