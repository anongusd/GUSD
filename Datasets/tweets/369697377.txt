@NatlHeadStart A6: Many families face stressful situations, including parental depression, community violence, and poverty. Teaching parents how to promote resilience can alleviate the long-term effects of trauma. #BreaktheAddictionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A5: In fact, the more adverse experiences a child has been exposed to, the higher the risks are for health and mental health problems. Here is some more information on trauma and toxic stress as well as resources: https://t.co/rbwiGGssU6 #BreaktheAddictionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A5: Many studies including the ACES study (adverse childhood experiences) have demonstrated a strong link between childhood trauma (significant adversity) and developmental and health problems throughout life. #BreaktheAddictionCycle

@NatlHeadStart A1: As of early April 2018, at least 28 states have enacted legislation related to opioid prescription limits. https://t.co/T1vqRYHqo3
@NatlHeadStart A1: At least 2 million children annually have a parent who uses illicit drugs, including opiods. In turn, the number of children entering foster care due to parental drug abuse is rising. https://t.co/vSiF34JGfw #BreaktheAddictionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A1: Opiod abuse not only affects the user, but the children of the user as well. Opiod abuse by parents puts children’s health and safety at risk. https://t.co/vSiF34JGfw #BreaktheAddictionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A1: The drastic increase in the abuse of prescription opiods has gained national attention on multiple fronts. Here are a couple of facts on how it affects our children. #BreaktheAdditionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A1: Opioids are highly addictive drugs, available in illegal forms like heroin, or legal ones like oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine to name a few - which are available through a prescription. https://t.co/vSiF34JGfw #BreaktheAddictionCycle
@NatlHeadStart A1: Opioid use and abuse has increased significantly over the last 20 years. Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold and the number of people who have died due to a prescription opioid overdose has nearly quadrupled in America.  https://t.co/vSiF34s4QW
