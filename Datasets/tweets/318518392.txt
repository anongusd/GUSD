Read all my thoughts on Judge Kavanaugh's upcoming testimony here: https://t.co/e8g00RjWyd
In my weeping, I trust that Jesus is correct: The truth will set us free. Let us seek that truth, prioritizing the dignity of all survivors of sexual assault.
To my brave sisters standing up and telling your stories: Know you are not alone. You empower many of us with your courage. You help many of us, including me, to say #MeToo and #NeverAgain. Thank you for speaking your truth.
To all Senators: To rush to a vote is both imprudent and callous. It doesn't respect the gravity of the nomination or the human dignity of women coming forward. We must not repeat the mistakes of the 1980s. Should a vote be pushed forward on Friday, I call on you to vote no.
These women are paying a high and painful price for coming forward. Respect them. Listen to them. Refer the matter for a full investigation.
To the men of the Judiciary Committee: Senators! Stop the partisan name-calling and search for the truth beyond the old boys club. You have no idea of what courage it takes to for women speak about such violence in a public forum.
Rather, the truth is that we are called to own our sins, mistakes, and failings and strive to do differently. That means proceeding with the utmost respect for the dignity of the women who have been wronged. It means accepting the consequences.
To Judge Brett Kavanaugh: Jesus says in the Gospel, “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). That does not mean hold tight to your perceived lack of wrongdoing.
I know all too painfully that being a person of faith does not stop men from being sexual predators.
I understand that when he testifies, Judge Kavanaugh is going to cite his Catholic faith as a shield to claim these attacks never happened. Being a Catholic does not change the accounts provided by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick.
This is not a moment for partisanship. It is a moment for truth telling.
Republican Senators seem to see this only as a partisan game where name calling and questioning of motives is appropriate. They are wrong and must be stopped.
I am horrified that many of the Republican Senators are further mistreating brave, accomplished women who are coming forward.
I stand in solidarity with brave women speaking up, naming their attacker, and setting the record straight.
Almost every woman I know has a #MeToo moment—often, more than one. I know I do.

Pope John XXIII: “laws and decrees passed in contravention of the moral order, and hence of the divine will, can have no binding force in conscience, since "it is right to obey God rather than men.”  (Peace on Earth, 1963, 51)
#FamiliesBelongTogether. It is a mandate of our faith and our nation. Laws that separate families are unjust and immoral and are no laws at all.
Catechism: "If rulers were to enact unjust laws or take measures contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would not be binding in conscience" (1903)
Bishops: “When a government enacts an unjust law, unjust because it violates the human dignity of the citizens or exceeds its authority, the citizens have a duty to disobey that law.” (Committee on Religious Liberty, 2015)
Saint Augustine: “An unjust law is no law at all.” (On Free Choice Of The Will, Book 1, § 5)
Give me a break... "it is very biblical to enforce the law" couldn't be further from the truth. https://t.co/t3mjqKx5wH

To our fellow Catholic, @SpeakerRyan, we say: if you truly believe that all lives are precious you will heed the call of your God and your faith teaching and bring the Dream Act for a vote straightaway.
Meanwhile, the Catholic Sisters and activists of @NETWORKLobby for Catholic Social Justice will continue to advocate for the passage of the Dream Act now.
This uncertainty causes grave ripple effects in our communities, and it goes against all that we as people of faith believe.
Each day that goes by without action, 122 Dreamers lose their protection, no federal agency can organize, no program that relies on federal funds can plan, and our people live in limbo.
We must stop the conversations about winners, losers, and political capital. Instead, we must realize the human costs.
Congress needs a serious lesson in good governance – and it is clear that we are facing CR after CR because Republicans can’t craft a budget for the year. These shameful partisan games have to stop, and Congress needs to focus on the common good.
Today, all 81 members of the Senate who voted to end the shutdown relied on the promise of a man who can’t be trusted. Yet again, Congress gambled with the lives of Dreamers and neglected their faithful duty.
As people of faith, we are taught that the greatest commandments are to love God and love thy neighbor.

All the ingredients are there, Congressional Republicans just need to decide: do they really care about the wellbeing of their constituents or will THEY cause a #GovernmentShutdown? We shall see. 13/13
.@SpeakerRyan &amp; the administration have already shown us they support “work requirements” for Medicaid recipients. We the People insist that Congress first must show us that they can meet their basic work requirements! Do your job! Get it done. 12/
In short, Congressional leadership (looking at you, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr) has to do their job! 11/
A roadmap for success:	-Set spending limits with equivalent increases for defense and non-defense spending. 	-Pass CHIP and the other healthcare extenders so that our children and health care systems do not suffer further. 	-Pass the DREAM Act. 	-Fully fund the 2020 Census. 10/
We the People need to let our representatives know that it is time to finish the job they were sent to DC to do. It shouldn’t be that complicated! 9/
The time to stop this is now! Republican incapacity to lead when they have unified government is shocking to the nation. There are common sense solutions readily available, but the leadership appears to lack the courage and common sense to settle the matter. 8/
Extending the time for passing an FY18 budget does NOTHING to resolve the decisions that need to be made. All it does is allow Republicans to avoid their responsibility to govern. 7/
In a month's time, Congress will still need to:	-set spending caps for FY 2018, even though more than a quarter will have passed	-pass CHIP &amp; related healthcare measures that expired 9/30/17	-fix DACA &amp; include a path to citizenship for Dreamers	-properly fund the 2020 Census 6/
Now, Congressional Republicans are seeking yet another month-long extension when NONE of the issues that must be dealt with will have changed – they still have troublemakers in their party while Democrats hold true to their core values. 5/
Each day that passes, Congressional Republicans (with the majority in both chambers) are violating all of the rules of effective governance by refusing to plan and execute basic good practices. 4/
As the leader of @NETWORKLobby, I know that you cannot responsibly run an organization if you don’t have your budget planned well in advance, yet Congressional Republicans continue to let the wellbeing of our nation suffer. 3/
Republicans have historically held themselves out as the party of business – and it is appalling that they are operating in such an irresponsible fashion. 2/
