@Ilhan You‚Äôre right congresswoman!!
@CaitlinPacific  you‚Äôre article in the Atlantic on the kids and Feinstein seemed condescending and dismissive. They will feel the full brunt of previous generations fuck ups.
@Jim_Jordan Having fun congressman??
@Stevegenome @NicolleDWallace WTF
@JamesSNYC @NicolleDWallace Good question!!
@bluenotebacker @NicolleDWallace That‚Äôs a natural reflex

@esglaude @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôll second that emotion!!!
@RealJamesWoods For once you‚Äôre right
@DineshDSouza God you are shallow
@urbannavajo check out the latest entry into the blog ‚Äúphilosophical conservatism‚Äù on Tumblr. It‚Äôs a quote from Hayek which informs the argument over the Cornyn quote from Mussolini
@urbannavajo Experts are already beginning to track down the context of the quote. Apparently it may have been lifted from a book by Hayek. Hayek was an admirer of distators like Mussolini and Pinochet.
@Cernovich Why would anyone have revenge porn of you? Who would be interested in it. Nonetheless it should be illegal
@MarisaKabas I‚Äôll vote for you to tell him; there needs to be some serious trash talking aimed at him. He is the walking definition of puerile insolence; plus he seems hypomanic
@4everNeverTrump Excellent comeback and very funny!!
@4everNeverTrump Times?? Plural, one can only hope
@MarisaKabas Excellent point
@1stJoshRobinson @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 It‚Äôs called criminal versatility; one of the characteristics of psychopathy
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems The usual bullshit from you too
@RealJamesWoods Another germophobe!!
@leslieleeiii Yes precisely. But why would these reports persist. One wonders if these allegations have substance
@PamKeithFL Young people should not listen to the elderly. We‚Äôve screwed it up so badly that they should not trust our judgment
@CancerSucksss @krassenstein All hail the slave states
@DineshDSouza You are so corrupt! These are not hitler youth you idiot
@BintibirdC @Lawrence I agree

@esglaude They may have to answer for this
@Jim_Jordan You will go down in history as the most myopic congressman ever elected
@DineshDSouza What a fine Christian you are
@BintibirdC Powerful statement!!
@RawStory One can only hope. More Big Macs to the rescue
@DineshDSouza You‚Äôre a small person
@BintibirdC @siano2020 Excellent come back!!
@DineshDSouza Ridiculous. You need to be more creative than that
the first article in the Real news network on AMAZON would be "Amazon's New NYC and DC HQ Bilked the cities"; check it out please
before continuing the trash talking extravaganza re: AOC; you might want to indulge yourself in a little learning regarding Amazon and HQ2 applications from cities: check out the Real News Network. search the site for "amazon" and there you will find 4 inter views
@tigerbeat @WillieGeist @AOC @JoeNBC typical talk from fucking millionaires. morning joe populated by the flack that protect the neoliberal thought collective. their money has contaminated their brains. privileged bitches
@BintibirdC That show is frequently pathetic. I can‚Äôt figure out why I watch it. There is usually some news value. But it‚Äôs so establishment. Only saved by Eddie when he‚Äôs there. Also Anand Giridharadas is great but too infrequent
@RealJamesWoods That‚Äôs below the belt; no pun intended
@BintibirdC @esglaude The Trump rallies are a combination of Bund rallies and Lynch mobs. The same sinister and menacing sense of impending violence a death
@ebyloman @AOC Idiotic

@BintibirdC That would be wonderful!!!
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS You are trash Gaetz
@BintibirdC When you grow up in a white supremacy culture, racism saturated the brain and soul. Racism is the default position for whites in Caucasian culture. White ppl need to accept this. And then self monitor to guard against racist eruption in their brains
@RepMattGaetz Matt ‚Äúshit for brains‚Äù Gaetz;
@king_of_bob Exactly Dylan!! You nailed it!!!
@DJClaussen71 You are exactly correct!!!
@KatyGerman Exactly!!
@Amy_Siskind @mostly_lurking @GonzoVeritas That‚Äôs a great idea. She‚Äôs still the numero uno!! Stacie Will be great
@Amy_Siskind This is a response to trump by a person not chosen by Pelosi I assume. Both responses are bound to be good
@BintibirdC Yes America is still racist and at least 40% of whites are probably and nearly openly racist. That‚Äôs a scary thought

@urbannavajo Excellent
@paulkrugman I think you're missing the point. She is too old, too white, and too rich. I'm a 71 yr old white male. Even I know this. The leadership needs to look like its membership

@DavidAFrench There is always a need to repress !! This much should be obvious even to the subnormal
@StefanMolyneux Pathological myopia. You are
So deep is this misdirection that even efforts to talk about real power become treacherous. My words above and below might suggest that power is rather like a person that if it in that it has intention and will that maybe at the light and likes to DC even play tricks. Cook/cpunch
The neoliberal order goes unquestioned- presumed against the evidence of history, to be permanent, fixed and unchallengeable. From Jonathan Cook in the current Counterpunch mag.
The focus on individuals has a purpose. It is designed to insure that the structure and ideological foundations of our society remain invisible to us - the public

@TyEducatingLibs @Education4Libs You‚Äôre disgusting
@Deoliver47 What corner are you in? So I can avoid you.
@Education4Libs Actually it has to do with common politeness. Anymore PC than that is questionable. You of course wouldn‚Äôt understand that. Since the only sensitivities you‚Äôre concerned with is your own
@Education4Libs You‚Äôre going to be in Purgatory a long time

@Robswandering @realphilhendrie I suspect Phil‚Äôs answer was a personal outlook based on his own experience of contemporary politics.
@BintibirdC I hope they are paying Eddie a lot of money for him to have to tolerate this kind of white bullshit
@BintibirdC At the close of Morning Joe, they asked for final thoughts. Eddie Glaude articulated his thinking about White fear and the the danger it presents to the Black community. Everyone else immediately switched to Barbara Bush condolences. It was pathetic!!

The Michener quote is from her book Fragmented Democracy: Medicaid Federalism and Unequal Politics. A great read for all concerned about MED4ALL
Jamila Michener: ‚ÄúGiven the historical policy development I have described thus far, it should be no surprise that Medicaid ‚Äî though vital and invaluable- is presently a fragmented labyrinth that underwrites a dizzying array of disparate services‚Äù

@allison_dejong You guys are awesome!!!
@TwinCitiesDSA you guys are awesome from Salt Lake DSA
The possibility for single payer has been slowly closed simultaneous to a historic rise in inequality and an unprecedented expansion of corporate power.		Adam Gaffney in Jacobin
Truman had strong support (for single payer) from organized labor, but encountered trenchant resistance from organized medicine in the form of the American Medical Association (AMA).   Adam Gaffney in Jacobin
when we consider the ACA through the lens of political economy, an even more concerning narrative emerges, one that says even less about the triumph of social democracy and more about the sharp shift of the political center and the disintegration of the New Deal left.
Leaving millions still uninsured and many more ‚Äúunderinsured‚Äù ‚Äî a well-described and researched phenomenon in which the possession of health insurance still leaves individuals and families with dangerous financial liability when illness strikes. by Adam Gaffney
Most plainly, when we consider the provisions and limitations of the law, it becomes clear that though it may help many, the ACA fails fundamentally to create what so many had hoped for: a system of universal health care.
@BintibirdC right on point as usual
Paul Ryan on the floor talking about Dems. He is disgusting

@kurteichenwald Typical white conservative from Wisconsin. But even for them, this guy is unbelievably stupid.
@BintibirdC Almost impossible!
@BintibirdC Thank you once again
@BintibirdC She is a woman who has had a perverse joke played on her and she‚Äôs too much of a dimwit to know it. The sociopathic men picked because she is a lousy liar/true believer who will back up Donny and slither out of any contradiction.
@RoseAnnDeMoro @antonio4ca @GavinNewsom Hell with him
@StephenMilIer Are you even capable of asking a coherent question?
@StephenMilIer You‚Äôre so misguided
@CharlesPPierce Really, one can only hope
@BintibirdC @maddow Excellent!!!

@StephenMilIer Disgusting as usual
@BintibirdC Good idea
@BintibirdC Very good point
@BintibirdC Agreed!!!
@esglaude Important you pointed this out; Todd cannot be trusted
@esglaude Very funny stuff for a long segment. But the way you were presented was very good but once again enraged me. It‚Äôs clear you need to have your own c-span channel.
@JackPosobiec Yeah!!!!
@DineshDSouza The french ruined them and The Americans didn‚Äôt help
@StephenMilIer Have fun
@JackPosobiec So witty
@BintibirdC Eddie is disrespected routinely on this and other shows. Numerous whites trying to whites plain to him. There is a reason he is a professor. He is capable of drawing refined distinctions on numerous topics. Lost on the dullards.
@StephenMilIer üçî eat too many and die please
@BintibirdC @JoeNBC Absolutely!!! Joe is a self aggrandizing oaf
@JackPosobiec I‚Äôm prepared to believe it, but you must cite your evidence

@esglaude @realDonaldTrump Well said condemnation!!!
@jimmyjamesroz @StephenMilIer You‚Äôre only half right , Republicans are worse
@esglaude Savages!!!
@BintibirdC It‚Äôs called the gravy train. A more apt description would be a river of shit which is way above flood stage.
@BintibirdC It all comes out in the wash.

@pinko_snob Pinko Snob you are the greatest!!! Thanks much
@esglaude @Morning_Joe @MaxBoot Boot is not bothered by mountains of dead bodies mostly in the color range of olive to brown complexion. Corrupt neocon moral degenerate

@dailykos Take your Ritalin Garth
@BintibirdC That should have been ‚Äúunmedicated‚Äù ADHD. Sorry
@BintibirdC This would go along with my diagnosis of chronic unmediated ADHD. It‚Äôs affected his judgment and results in his thin skinned approach to conflict.
@BintibirdC Interesting to say the least
@KatyTurNBC Don‚Äôt get too caught up in the detail; just think of this new book as an Impressionist painting that you are trying to perceive as an artistic exercise in hyper-realistic art. Go with the ethos not the details
@HallieJackson He‚Äôs a total loss. Never trust the actions of willfully ignorant white people!!!!
@BintibirdC We‚Äôve always known Bannon the psychopath was always smarter the Trump the sociopath. Trump does not have the best words and the best brain

@feralgrass @Boston_DSA Good point
@realphilhendrie Well said
@esglaude I am reminded by my mutant white brethren that one never escapes. Completely. It is a constant struggle to rid oneself of this hateful ideology. The fusion of racism and misogyny emerging in white culture.
@esglaude I was reminded of the culture I grew up in around Chicago in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs. I felt completely alienated from them. But also contaminated by their whiteness. Looking in the mirror I see a 70 yr old white dude. And I wonder how did I escape being them?
@esglaude This what is deposited in the mind of every white person who  grows up in a white supremacist culture . It seeps into every corner of the white mind. It is a constant struggle to rid oneself of this disposition. Some just don‚Äôt care
@BintibirdC Right again
@SteveBannen Pathetic as usual
@BintibirdC What is he prepping people for?
@BintibirdC I truly do not understand her connection to this man. She has potential to be so much more classy than her hack boyfriend. But I suppose everyone has their own blind spot

@mhsmith5 @Maggyw519 @Mediaite from the book by Robert Paxton "Anatomy of Fascism"
right being decided by the sole criterion of the group's prowess within a Darwinian struggle
-- the right of the "chosen" people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law,
-- the beauty of violence and efficacy of the will, when they are devoted to the group's success
culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group's historical destiny
-- the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male) whose instincts prevail over abstract or universal reason;
-- the need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary
-- dread of the group's decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences
a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies both internal and external
-- the belief that one's group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies
superior to every right , whether individual or universal, and subordination of the individual to it
-- the primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right , whether individual or universal,
-- a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions
ok mikey, lets see if you can follow this. the underlying passions of fascism
@mhsmith5 @Maggyw519 @Mediaite do you even understand what fascism is? i will be glad to explain in a separate tweet
@echosaber9 your surgery has been scheduled for this coming week. The proctologist will be removing your head from your ass

@RonRosenbaum1 Bauer had it right!!!
@RonRosenbaum1 you quote Yehuda Bauer as saying "just because something hasn't yet been explained, doesn't mean its inexplicable.
@RonRosenbaum1 given how ubiquitous homicidal ideation is, its only a short step to killing for someone primed by catholic antisemitism
@RonRosenbaum1 he tries to explore the linkages between beliefs and behavior in the historical setting of antisemitism
@RonRosenbaum1 he was a professor of medieval history. now dead
@RonRosenbaum1 He steps into the realm of social psychology to investigate to nature of belief systems
@RonRosenbaum1 Langmuir's second book was History, Religion and Antisemitism
@RonRosenbaum1 Langmuir wrote Toward a Definition of AntiSemitism
@RonRosenbaum1 Are you aware of the writing of Gavin Langmuir? That would have been a interesting addition to Explaining Hitler.
are you aware of the writing of Gavin Langmuir? Just finished the updated Explaining Hitler. Excellent!!
