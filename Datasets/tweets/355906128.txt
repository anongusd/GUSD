Hey Texas! How can y'all be a part of creating the state and country you want to see if you don't vote? TODAY IS YOUR LAST DAY TO REGISTER to vote for @BetoORourke and all your other favorite mid-term candidates.  Need info on how to register? go to https://t.co/qCVwprFjwO. https://t.co/K74epquLcS
@DmJ43 @_deedsnotwords Totally agree - which is the intended message here
@dissentingj @menjicm So true. Many will be hurt in the meantime. It will take long term sustained action by all of us to bring the ultimate corrections to representative government and the court that will be needed. I pray our collective sense of commitment to that will hold.

I could not be more proud to support this man‚Äôs candidacy for the US Senate. With just a few poignant and thoughtful words, @BetoORourke has penned a piece that sums up why we must come together and fight for the values that collectively create equal opportunity for all. https://t.co/IB1E5bKk8z
A very thoughtful piece about the political history of the Supreme Court and what we are potentially facing now. The answer? Vote like your civil liberties depend on it. Because they absolutely do. https://t.co/twVJP8fRec

Their actions are part of a broader mission to put women back into our "place." Denying us family planning means denying us control over our lives and our ability to fully participate as equal in social, economic and political spheres.
Today, the Trump-Pence administration has co-opted the mission and purpose of Title X to drive an anti-Planned Parenthood, anti-birth control, pro-abstinence only mission.
Title X was enacted in furtherance of a Republican President's (Nixon) commitment that no "American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition."

As we celebrate all of these gains made under the #ACA, we also remember that the Trump Administration and GOP Congress are trying to reverse this progress at every turn. We must stand up and speak loud against any threats to the ACA and our health care. #WeWontGoBack (8/8)
Women can no longer be charged more than men because of their sex. I‚Äôm still shocked that this was even legal for so long. (7/8)
20 million Americans ‚Äì including 1.8 million Texans (!!!) ‚Äì have gained health care coverage. A lot of these people gained coverage through states‚Äô Medicaid expansion, which is constantly under threat of being rolled back by the GOP today. (6/8)
Health care plans now cover preventive services, like flu shots, mammograms, and contraception, at absolutely *no cost* to consumers. That‚Äôs not just a positive thing for consumers, but it‚Äôs also common sense ‚Äì preventive health care saves insurers money down the line. (5/8)
Insurers can no longer put annual or lifetime limits on how much care you can receive. For the patient with a chronic, long-term health condition that requires constant medical care, this makes the difference between life or death. (4/8)
All plans now MUST cover a set of essential health benefits, such as prescription drugs, emergency services, and maternity and newborn care. Before, insurers could sell junk plans that barely covered anything, giving consumers a false sense of security. (3/8)
The 1 in 4 Americans ‚Äì including 10.7 million Texans ‚Äì who have pre-existing conditions cannot be discriminated against by insurers. People no longer have to fear being denied or dropped from coverage because of their medical history. (2/8)
Today, I join Americans across the country in commemorating the anniversary of the #ACA. Since it was signed 8 years ago, coverage has increased, rates have lowered, and health care outcomes have drastically improved. Thanks to the ACA: (1/8)

Well said @HillaryClinton This election is about us &amp; up to us We will define the very identity of this country with our vote #Debates2016
Thank you @HillaryClinton for reminding us what a misogynist @realDonaldTrump is. #Debates2016 And we women are going to vote this Nov!
@realDonaldTrump says @HillaryClinton isn't presidential bc she doesn't have the stamina. And @HillaryClinton slams him with finesse.
@HillaryClinton brings calm to the hysteria that @realDonaldTrump's wake causes. #Presidential #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton defines diplomacy while @realDonaldTrump responds to taunts with no judgment #Debates2016
Your strongest asset your temperament while showing how out of control your temperament is?? Wow. @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
&amp; numerous conversations with Sean Hannity ... #BelieveMe @realDonaldTrump Which proves I was against the war in Iraq #Debates2016
I was asked on a "major show" ... Blah, blah, blah ... What the heck did he just say?? @realDonaldTrump #believeme #debates2016
Hacking into American's private systems and endorsement of same by @realDonaldTrump unacceptable. Agree @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
I did a great credit to race and cultural diversity bc I let them into my private club @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump did a "great service" for POTUS for forcing him to prove his citizenship???? Omg. There are no words ... #Debates2016
"You decided to stay home ..." @realDonaldTrump to HRC.   I decided to prepare, just like prepared to be Pres. @HillaryClinton SWISH!
Too dangerous to fly, too dangerous to buy a gun! Heck yes @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Yes @HillaryClinton we have to deal with systemic racism in our criminal justice system. #Debates2016
"Stop &amp; frisk" is all about who is being targeted. #Debates2016
We should all fear invasion of unconstitutional "stop &amp; frisk" &amp; the connected racial profiling @realDonaldTrump #debates2016
Charlotte - the city I love because I have investments there ...@realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
So ... Let's talk about "race" ... Yes. Let's. #debates2016
"It's all words ..." Yes @realDonaldTrump. Words that make a hell of a lot of sense. #Debates2016
Man is @HillaryClinton's preparation for this debate showing tonight or what? #Debates2016
Complaining about our infrastructure when you haven't contributed your taxes to help fix it when all the rest of us have @realDonaldTrump?
So all of the rest of us who pay our obligations in taxes aren't "smart" @realDonaldTrump? Really? #Debates2016
"Another example of bait and switch" @realDonaldTrump Indeed @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Release your tax filings @realDonaldTrump! #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump thinks your interest rates should rise. Do you? #Debates2016
Trickle down didn't work, right on @HillaryClinton #trumpeduptrickledown #Debates2016

@HillaryClinton showing her stuff! A real plan for stimulating the economy juxtaposed against Trumps's blustering #Debate2016
Don't let the jobs leave ... @realDonaldTrump As my mom would say ... The pot calling the kettle black. #Debates2016
How about telling yourself to bring back jobs from overseas @realDonaldTrump? #Debates2016
#TrumpedupTrickleDown
Your tax plan puts money in your own pocket @realDonaldTrump not in the pockets of the middle class #Debates2016
