@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No it‚Äôs not but you have to have money to live. I have bills just like anyone else you can‚Äôt tell me you like just throwing money away if you do I can tell your not honest
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I can tell your not a business owner. If something is not profitable causes you to lose money no business owner is going to do that. As an insurance agent I‚Äôm my own business owner the insurance company just gives me resources. But everyday I go work I‚Äôm not going to lose money
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If someone has been in several car accidents and speeding they pay higher premiums. You have claims on your house you pay higher homeowners insurance. If your health is bad you pay higher premiums on life and health insurance that is the way they can stay solvent. It‚Äôs a bad law
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Someone with health problems should pay higher premiums than someone who is healthy that‚Äôs how insurance works. You manage risk.
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a terrible law I know first hand it‚Äôs made things worse not better!
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I know people who take the tax hit because they absolutely can‚Äôt afford the premiums. I also know people who‚Äôs premiums have quadrupled since that law has been passed. The only thing it has done is caused healthcare and insurance cost go up at a catastrophic rate!
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I know this is what I do for a living your getting your talking points from some article or news outlets you watch. I‚Äôm an insurance agent I know more on this than you would ever know it‚Äôs what I do.......

@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Obama shut down the government for Obama Care the ACA! I‚Äôm an insurance agent it is absolutely one of the worst laws ever passed. I see people every day with some of the worst health care ever and it‚Äôs also unaffordable. Hints Unaffordable Care Act should be it‚Äôs name!
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Oh I guess democrats are perfect angels.

George Washington said political parties are going to destroy this country!
@mrdefender1983 @WM_Bartle @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No I‚Äôm not fine with that just like I was not fine with the clintons doing that! George Washington said political parties would destroy this country and we are watching that unfold!
@mrdefender1983 @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Give him the funding for the wall it‚Äôs way over due. Our agents on the border say they need it. Democrats funded it in the pass the only reason they won‚Äôt now is because they hate trump. That‚Äôs not an excuse to do what is right..

@ritchiejacob625 @TommyUnderwood2 Also gruden would never go to college he just likes the attention
@ritchiejacob625 @TommyUnderwood2 I like gruden as an NFL coach but what has he ever done he won 1 super bowl with Dungy's players the next season after that went 4-12 he has never Head coached college football and was mediocre in the NFL
RT @wesrucker247: This is so bad that I‚Äôm wondering if Tennessee can actually go to a judge and argue that these firings were for cause.
@ritchiejacob625 @TommyUnderwood2 I'm tired of this gruden stuff for one he ain't coming and for him I don't want him

@ritchiejacob625 @jakelourim And everywhere he's gone he has cheated it's just a matter of time he gets caught again
@ritchiejacob625 @jakelourim Look at all the talent that cal has had and only one national championship and the one year he won North Carolina had a better team he's just lucky that three of their starters were hurtand the backup point guard got hurt
@ritchiejacob625 @jakelourim If I had to rank the college coaches in basketball coach K would be one Roy would be number two

@ritchiejacob625 @jakelourim Unless you were playing teams that are relevant you don't get noticed which Louisville schedule is garbage besides Clemson and he got his tail beat in that one
