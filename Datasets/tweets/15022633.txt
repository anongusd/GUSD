There are three weeks left to the Democratic Primary for Governor of Ohio. I ask that you join me in standing up for peace and standing up to the cowards who want more violence in our society. 		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
I am, have been and will continue to be resolute in the cause of peace. The pursuit of political office will never cause me to cower in that work.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
Richard Cordray wants to have assault weapons, which are weapons of war on the streets of America. I want such weapons taken off the streets of the world.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
As you can see, my speech was about peace, as have been hundreds of speeches I have given in the US House of Representatives and in forums around the world.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"All aggressor countries cannot continue to attempt to overthrow the government of Syria without destabilizing their own lands, because when the fighters they sent into Syria come back, they will look to apply the lessons of terrorism to their homelands."		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"The introduction of armed religious extremists to Syria, supported by foreign powers, shattered religious harmony and set the stage for rampant intolerance and murderous attacks."		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"Syria had long held a tradition of pluralism, wherein Christians, Jews and Muslims of all sects, as well as various ethnicities could live, work and worship freely without fear of persecution, under the protection of the government."		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"The escalation of the conflict came when arms and fighters moved into Syria, capitalizing on dissent, but advancing a cause inimical to most Syrians, the establishment of a caliphate, by violence."		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"Syria, has long been run by an authoritarian regime which saw dissent as the product of foreign agents. Prior to the country exploding into war, legitimate protests were met with resistance by the government." 		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"The war is the working out of the game of nations, with Syria as the board in a multidimensional chess match played by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and the United States on one side, and Hezbollah, Russia and Iran on the other side."		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"The result was a war which has fragmented the country, produced millions of refugees, destroyed the infrastructure, wrecked houses of worship and killed nearly a half million people." 		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
"The war in Syria is not a civil war and never was. Hundreds of thousands of troops, soldiers of fortune, mercenaries, intelligence agents, war profiteers, and religious fanatics, from over 90 countries, have descended on Syria, under the cover of the revolutionary Arab Spring."
The purpose of the conference was to bring peace and reconciliation to Syria, not to support the present regime. Here is my opening statement which was abstracted for a panel discussion:		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
You can watch a video of other conference speakers here: https://t.co/VMXu50wf7o		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
Those in attendance included:		- The Archbishop of Canterbury 	-The Rt. Rev. and Honorable Lord Dr. Eames, a member of the House of Lords and a leading international peace activist	-Baroness Caroline Cox, of the House of Lords, an international humanitarian leader.
The facts:  Last year I attended a peace conference in the UK, at the invitation of EuroCSE (The European Centre for the Study of Extremism, Cambridge https://t.co/aJsZ41gXRV). It was paid for by a civil rights advocacy group in California.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
Cordray will do anything to change the subject from his NRA ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating and his support for assault weapons on the streets of America.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK
These cowardly, hysterical and outrageously untrue statements reflect Cordray‚Äôs panic that he and the State Capitol power-brokers might lose control of the Ohio Democratic Party and the statehouse.		https://t.co/VQroGMhsVK

Any attempt to impose a military solution will result in wider war and the deaths of even greater numbers of innocents. Missile attacks are a confession of ineptitude.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
When leaders take more interest in blowing things up in other countries than they do in building things up in their own country, you know they have lost their way.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
Meanwhile, as @realDonaldTrump recklessly spends hundreds of millions in attacks of dubious value, America‚Äôs infrastructure is crumbling. We could replace the Western Hills Viaduct in #Cincinnati for the approximate cost of this illicit military dalliance.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
It is noteworthy that those responsible for the gas attack have yet to be identified. We are not free to bomb in retaliation based on suspicion. It‚Äôs a daft way to use the U.S. military, particularly when we have troops in the region.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
Certainly, the culprits responsible for the gas attack need to be identified &amp; brought to justice. But last night‚Äôs strike occurs as a violation of international law at precisely the time when international law must be enforced on behalf of the victims.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
There was clearly no mature risk assessment of the pre-emptive attack. It seems driven more by emotions and politics than by strategic or national security considerations.		#Syria #NoWorldWar3
@realDonaldTrump's missile attack on #Syria puts the U.S. on a path of military escalation with Russia, which opens wide the possibility of further miscalculations, errors or accidents that can ignite a world war. 		https://t.co/SpsiVVwpBH #NoWorldWar3

"The health and wellness of our kids needs to be a priority in this race. We need to cut the waste, the abuse and corruption in the State Capitol and invest in improving the quality of life for our children. 		The money is there. We need to be willing to do what's right." #OHGov
On the opioid epidemic:		"We need to treat people, not put them in prison. I intend to lead boldly with a #MedicareForAll healthcare system in Ohio. Our residents are suffering, and they need help. We need to act urgently with multi-disciplinary, compassionate approach." #OHGov
"Ohioans have a right to safe communities. We shouldn't have to worry about our kids' safety when we drop them off at school. I intend to break the #NRA's corruption &amp; their stronghold over Ohio lawmakers, &amp; I'm the only candidate on this stage who's willing to do that." #OHGov
The moderator asked @RichCordray if he supported our campaign's movement to #BanAssaultWeapons in Ohio. 		It was a yes or no question, and he talked in circles. 		#BanAssaultWeaponsNow #VoteForOurLives #OHGov
"#MedicareForAll. 		Clean water for all. 		Freedom from the #NRA's influence. 		A $15 minimum wage. 		Real economic opportunity for working families. 		These are the things Ohio needs and deserves, and we can build them by breaking the cycle of corruption." #OHGov #Election2018

@modmom19 Absolutely, Dorri ‚Äì I plan to work with the Ohio Department of Health to develop and implement a process that allows transgender Ohioans to change their birth certificate to reflect their gender identity. Selective equality is not equality!

"I admire all of you willing to stand up, speak out and challenge special interests. There's life and vitality in this community, and that gives me hope for this entire entire state. Together, we can take a real stand for public interest, public ownership and public good!" #OHGov
"Whether it's water, electricity or other public services ‚Äì the system should belong to the workers. Privatizers have little interest in workers' rights. 		Our unions keep us strong. We must support them &amp; protect them from the special interests bent on staging takeovers." #OHGov
"My concern lies with the Toledoans that would be forced to shoulder the burden. I know from experience that far too often, low-income folks are forced to choose between paying utility bills and feeding their families. We need to do better by our working families." #OHGov
"This agreement will force Toledoans to pay for an outside takeover of their water system. If you spent $20k to fix your car, would you sell it for $5k? We need to be opening doorways to economic opportunities for our working families, not closing them." #OHGov #Toledo419
"This is about giving the people control over their future. Water is the future, and when we give it up to privatizers, we lose that control. Water is to Ohio what oil is to Texas. It can ‚Äì and should ‚Äì belong to the people, not the corporations." #OHGov #Toledo419
"This country was founded on taxation with ‚Äì and only with ‚Äì representation. Toledoans deserves more representation in this water agreement. But the Toledo Water Authority wants to replace elected representatives with anonymous, appointed officials? That's not representation."
"If the people of Toledo, in their wisdom, decide they want to seek privatization, then at the very least, they deserve open-door transparency. The people of Toledo deserve to know where their taxpayer dollars are going." #OHGov #Toledo419
"The banks wanted to shift the burden onto taxpayers. Privatization would have driven up rates, and it would have closed doors to economic opportunity. Today, the same thing is happening in Toledo. We have to ask ourselves ‚Äì what's the impact of privatization?" #OHGov #Toledo419
"When the banks tried to make me privatize Cleveland's electric system, I thought of my family. I know how important it is to be able to pay utility bills. The banks blackmailed the city of Cleveland, but I took a stand for my family, and for all Cle. working families." #OHGov
"I remember one apartment we lived in. My parents would sit at the kitchen table counting pennies. As a child, I'd fall asleep listening to the pennies drop. They were just trying to make ends meet." #OHGov #Toledo419
"I want to share with you why it was so important for me to take up the fight against Muny Light in Cleveland.		My family was an inner-city family. I grew up the oldest of 7. We never owned a home. We struggled to pay rent." #OHGov #Toledo419
Now onto Dennis:		"I'm running to make sure the government responds to people. I honor those who serve and have served their communities‚Äì lawmakers, labor leaders, faith leaders, activists. Today, I'm speaking before the people that make up the heart and soul of this community!"
"Taking a stand against billionaires isn't easy, &amp; it comes with a price. Dennis was willing to pay that price. He sacrificed his career for the people of Cleveland, but he didn't stay down. He saved Clevelanders millions of $ over the years, and his service is legendary." #OHGov
"He had the courage &amp; fortitude to stand with everyday people, and it paid off hugely. Now, he's bringing the same fight against corporate take-overs to Toledo. Here at home, our public water system is at risk of takeover. But Dennis stands with us!" #Toledo419 #OHGov
"I remember when the private sector tried to bully Cleveland into privatizing the public electrical system. Dennis led the fight to keep our public services public. He took a stand for everyday people, and he won the fight!" #Toledo419 #OHGov
"I was a student in NE Ohio when Dennis Kucinich was Mayor of Cleveland. I was a political science major, and I was taken aback at his energy, passion and commitment to the citizens of Cleveland. He was a champion of that city ‚Äì especially of the East Side!" #Toledo419 #OHGov

"But @RichCordray has a different track record. He handed the Trump administration the keys to @CFPB, with devastating affects to OH working families. Payday lenders are cheating millions of people out of billions of $, &amp; they‚Äôre running loose because Cordray deserted his post."

"I have a history of standing up to powerful interests ‚Äì and as #OHGov, I won't back down! When I was mayor of Cleveland, I cut government spending by 10% without reducing public services. I put my career on the line when I put principle &gt; politics to save Cle. from Muny Light."
"#EducationForAll is a jobs growth program. Making sure our youth can pay their student loans and have access to quality, free 2-year college is a jobs growth program. That incentivizes young people to stay in Ohio and grow our workforce." #OHGov #Kucinich4Ohio
"The bridge in Stark County. The Brent Spence Bridge. The Western Hills Viaduct ‚Äì we need to put the people of Ohio to work rebuilding our bridges, our roads, our infrastructure systems. We need an #OHGov with a vision, and with the ability to rally the state to #RebuildOhio!"
"Privatization is the reverse of job growth. In respect to #JobsOhio, that was a slush fund for middle management. The biggest and most important job of #OHGov is to create jobs. To start: we need a very wide-reaching program to rebuild infrastructure." #RebuildOhio

"Medicaid expansion doesn't go far enough. I'm proposing #MedicareForAll for Ohio. OH can be one of the 1st states in the country to break ground, &amp; really show the country how we can take care of our own. I wrote the #MedicareForAll bill in Congress, &amp; I'll do it again for OH!"

Trump‚Äôs border wall is a waste of $$. In Ohio, taxpayers already pay more than their fair share in state taxes w/o seeing returns. Take Hamilton County as an example ‚Äì it's past time we #RebuildOhio with a focus on smart spending &amp; quicker job growth!  		https://t.co/Gtez733vsc
Families on both sides of party lines want things like quality public education &amp; affordable healthcare. Instead of giving massive tax breaks to wealthy CEOs, we should be funding our schools &amp; healthcare centers. Our working families are our future &amp; it's time we put them first!
I'm sick of politics as usual between the two Parties. #PowerToWeThePeople isn't radical ‚Äì it's the ideology that people, not corporations, should be at the forefront of our politics. It's past time OH working families had a real voice in the Statehouse! 		https://t.co/WkSaOr0lsD

All Ohio kids deserve a chance to thrive, &amp; it starts when we #LayTheGroundwork early.

As Gov, I plan to #PutOhioKidsFirst! https://t.co/4dzRpVosMq
People of Ohio, we have the opportunity to make history May 8. 		In 215 yrs, the OH Dem Party has never put Black Dem in statewide office.

"This campaign &amp; this candidacy is about nothing less than transforming the political structure. To make it effective. To make it visionary. To make the visions that we dream of ‚Äì visions of a safer, healthier, stronger, more prosperous OH ‚Äì into a reachable reality!" #OHGov
"This coalition of OH voters WILL lead the way to a Democratic win in Ohio in November. This electorate is electrified, &amp; together we know we have what it takes to transform our state. We're taking OH back from corporate control, and giving power back to the people!" #OHGov
"But more than anything, this election is about winning. Ohio is in a moment where Democrats have a real chance to win, &amp; the Kucinich-Samples ticket is the one that's going to do it. Our grassroots campaign is resonating w young people, people of color &amp; progressive voters."
"And it's the responsibility of the govt to make sure all Ohioans have access to quality, affordable healthcare. In Congress, I wrote the bill for universal, single-payer healthcare. As Gov, I'm committed to building a safer, healthier Ohio, and that means #HealthcareForAll."
"It's the responsibility of this govt to move Ohio forward. And as Gov., I will do exactly that. Together, we will rebuild Ohio's infrastructure. We're going to bring tens of thousands of Ohioans back to work in good-paying, Davis Bacon jobs. $15 hour minimum wage jobs!" #OHGov
"We need to listen to their parents, who drop them off at school &amp; worry if they're ever going to see them again. We shouldn't have to take public safety for granted. Our safety &amp; public spaces are ours to reclaim, &amp; that's why Tara &amp; I are leading the way to #BanAssaultWeapons."
"In the last week, hundreds of thousands of young people in Ohio came forward to say: We want to be safe in our schools. There's a new Ohio is rising, and with it is the power &amp; strength of the young people coming into this political process. We need to listen to our students."
"We're going to do it by transforming the status quo, and making Ohio a leader in the fight to bring #PowerToWeThePeople! That means an assault weapons ban. That means single-payer healthcare, $15/hour, quality public education, &amp; legal marijuana for compassionate pain relief."
"We have the opportunity to transform Ohio's political system. We're not going to do it by courting the #NRA, the charter school lobby, the fracking industry or any other corporate interest groups staging takeovers of our political system." #OHGov #PowerToWeThePeople
"There is a new social consciousness rising in OH. Our youth are saying: the status quo is over. The power and strength of these young people is more than a moment, it's a movement. They're calling for Ohio to #BanAssaultWeapons. They're calling for #HealthcareForAll."
Tara and I are running a joint, unified ticket, and I'm giving her the first word!		@TaraLSamples: Dennis and I are excited to be a face of a unified, progressive party. It starts with jobs. Raising the min. wage to $15/hour, and a unified front to #BanAssaultWeapons! #OHGov

"There IS a difference in this election. This morning, the front page of @ThePlainDealer showed that this race is a dead heat between myself and @RichCordray. *You all* have the opportunity to make your own decision about who represents the Party." #OHGov
"This is why @TaraLSamples &amp; I are leading the effort to #BanAssaultWeapons in OH. 2 yrs in Senate &amp; 16 in Congress, I earned my 'F' from the #NRA each &amp; every day. I can't be compromised on that. I'm the only Democratic #OHGov candidate with an 'F' rating from the #NRA."
"Let me be clear ‚Äì NO Ohio student should EVER fear for their safety when they enter a classroom. No parent should have to worry about dropping their kid off at school &amp; wondering if they'll ever see them again. But that's our reality, and in order to change it, we must name it."
"I didn't speak. I felt the youth leaders there were speaking for me, * with an eloquence and a poetry that moved me to tears. I marched with them and for them. I cried with them and for them. They're calling for change, and our campaign is rising to answer their call." #OHGov
"Of course, leading with compassion takes many other forms. On Saturday, our grassroots team of volunteers joined #MarchForOurLives events across the state. Hundreds of thousands of students, parents &amp; teachers took to the streets to plead for their lives &amp; lives of loved ones."
"OH can lead the way in giving #PowerToWeThePeople when it comes to healthcare. When opiates are the only option for pain relief, the system has failed. As Gov., I am committed to legalizing marijuana. Together, we can ensure all Ohioans have access to compassionate pain relief!"
"The cost of healthcare is often driven by the choices that we make, and there ARE ways to reduce costs. But people need to be allowed to make their own decisions. It's time we stop giving drug companies freedom to push dangerous, life-threatening, for-profit agendas." #OHGov
"We need a breakthrough to transform the system, and OH can be the state to do it. How? Reconfigure spending. Dedicate existing resources to a new system that will enable people to pay their bills. We simply cannot continue to survive on backbreaking healthcare costs." #OHGov
"Healthcare costs are causing people to lose their homes, life savings &amp; opportunities for their kids to go to college. Even under the ACA, insurance companies jack up the premiums. They make $$ by NOT providing healthcare. This model is flawed, and it's wrong for OH." #OHGov
"Make no mistake ‚Äì healthcare is a driving force in this election. As a Congressman, I wrote the bill for universal, single-payer, not-for-profit healthcare. I wrote it to get rid of the premiums &amp; co-pays crushing Ohio working families." #OHGov 		https://t.co/w9vMz5x1V6

An average of 11 million gallons or water are used in each #fracking well. It‚Äôs being stolen from our watersheds, made toxic with hundreds of chemicals and dumped back into our soil.
One of the most beautiful areas in Ohionhas been ruined by #Fracking - and more than that, toxic chemicals are killing the land, causing Birth defects, destroying people‚Äôs health, our water and our future. What are we doing??? #PowerToWeThePeople #Kucinich4Ohio

Politicians are much like birds on a wire. Have you ever seen how one bird may sit alone for a while but then be followed by another &amp; another? ... Well I don‚Äôt mind being that first bird. It‚Äôs time for a change and we in Ohio can lead the way!#Kucinich4Ohio #PowerToWeThePeople

‚ÄúCome my friends, ‚Äòtis not too late to seek a newer world!‚Äù
Why am I running for Governor? Because it is possible for a state to forward thinking about healthcare for all, jobs for all, clean energy, rengerative agriculture - there‚Äôs another reality and I want to help steward it forward!
Prohibition is a failed policy. Tara Samples and I advocate for replacing the disastrous War on Drugs with policies rooted in evidence, compassion, and justice for ALL Ohioans. #PowerToWeThePeople #OHGov 		https://t.co/JPk3FN5i0L
#BanAssaultWeapons!!! https://t.co/xifULjakV6
We oppose the continued efforts by the Ohio legislature to impose their will on women‚Äôs bodies and will veto legislation that comes across our desk once elected that seeks to do so. #PowerToWeThePeople #OHGov 		https://t.co/XuldBklIpL
RT @DraftTulsi: I remember it well &amp; hardly a day goes by since the 70s I don‚Äôt think ab how hard  @Dennis_Kucinich fought for the ppl http‚Ä¶
I'm clear about where I stand on the issues that matter.		I'm fighting to #BanAssaultWeapons from our communities. I have an 'F' rating from #NRA. I'm not afraid to fight the gun lobby that profits from senseless, preventable violence in our classrooms.		https://t.co/1S5iKxTT6m
‚ÄúWe must take care of things at home. It shouldn‚Äôt be that the only choice for a job is to frack and destroy our #water, our natural resources, our #health and our #agriculture base. We need to create #jobs in a true #RegenerativeEconomy. There‚Äôs so much opportunity and need‚Äù
‚ÄúSadly while in Congress I spent much of my time trying to stop the life blood and resources of our nation being hemorrhaged in needless wars. I focused on strengthening America, on putting people back to work, rebuilding our infrastructure, not wasting our $$$ destroying others‚Äù
‚ÄúTwo years later I ran for Congress and won that race, again from a Republican incumbent - because I stood clearly on people oriented issues and gave a clearly defined choice‚Äù
‚ÄúThe people realized the importance of that decision and finally realized what had happened - they hailed me a hero and called me back to public life. I ran for state senate and won, beating a Republican incumbent‚Äù
I saved #MunyLight but lost my job because I didn‚Äôt play ball w/the establishment. 15 years later Muny underwent the largest expansion of any publicly owned electric system &amp; my decision not to give into the banks had saved the people of Cleveland hundreds of millions of $$$
‚ÄúThe banks tried to coerce me into giving away the city‚Äôs electric system. I offered the Bank property, city income tax revenue, ... to satisfy the debt they called on $15m in loans I‚Äôd not taken out - but they only wanted the electric system so they put the city into default!‚Äù
‚ÄúIn my first year in office as Mayor, we cut spending by 10% without cutting services. We cut wasteful spending and corrupt contracts.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe worked with neighborhood groups to improve public safety, sewers, roads. We focused on services‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen I became Mayor age 30 in 1977, I took on some really tough battles. Interest groups expected the keys to the city and I refused to give them to them. I became mayor to represent all people of Cleveland‚Äù
‚ÄúOur Gubernatorial ticket with @TaraLSamples, represents unity and diversity. Representative of the faces of people across the state.‚Äù  #Kucinich4Ohio #PowerToWeThePeople
‚ÄúThe first motto of the United States was E Pluribus Unum - out of many, we are one! Though we are different in race, color, creed, political philosophy, economic status,... we are all American and there needs to be oppprtunity for all‚Äù
‚ÄúFrom running for President across the country I‚Äôve found there is an underlying unity to our country. The American eagle needs two wings to fly: one on the left, the other on the right.‚Äù
‚ÄúCooperation means to work with everyone no matter their viewpoint. When you recognize their humanity you always find a way to work together on something. I always strive for cooperation‚Äù
‚ÄúI poured myself into that job and worked 18 hours a day. If you want to find out about people, go door to door and serve them. Representation is about service. It‚Äôs essential to help people and have satisfaction in serving. I love to help people‚Äù
‚ÄúI first ran for Council at the age of 21, then again 2 years later in then Ward 7 in Cleveland. In order to win I had to win the Ward machine and I did it by going door to door, out of a desire to serve. I won a seat at age 23, by just 16 votes!‚Äù
‚ÄúMy parents only went to 8th grade but my mom taught me to read by the time I was 3 which gave me the intellectual freedom to learn and serve. I love to learn. I have an inquisitive mind. I was the first in my family to go to college where I also worked 3 fulltime jobs‚Äù
‚ÄúSociety has more resources today but it doesn‚Äôt do enough to help real people. Policies continue to transfer the wealth of the people to the hands of the few.‚Äù #Kucinich4Ohio #PowerToWeThePeople
‚ÄúWe learned to be resourceful to make ends meet. I was the first born of 7 and scrubbed floors in primary school to pay my siblings‚Äô book bill‚Äù
‚ÄùWe grew up in the marine tradition of loyalty dedication, faithfulness‚Äù
‚ÄúWe lived in 21 different places by the time I was 17, including a couple of cars.‚Äù

"Our administration would be guided by tax policies that create a more fair distribution of the tremendous wealth of this state ‚Äì but also to create jobs that would create more revenue." The distribution of wealth upwards needs to stop, and I'm the candidate willing to do that.
On tax policy: "We need to create tax policy that stop the distribution of the wealth upwards." Local communities are having to raise taxes because our current Gov. took away local government funding. As #OHGov, I will change that.		https://t.co/as23B3dPaG		#PowerToWeThePeople

Turning to Q&amp;A forum. First question on financing charter schools.		As next #OHGov, I will endeavor to give local boards and local communities the power to decide whether or not they will create &amp; fund a charter school. The Statehouse should not have total control of the Board.

Our campaign will assist you in organizing your neighborhood to join the #BanAssaultWeapons movement. We‚Äôll provide you with guidance on how to move forward &amp; engage with local gov. Sign the pledge today: https://t.co/Yx1qDD3NVW
This requires the effort of all our of us. We therefore call upon you not to sign a petition, but to sign a pledge to organize your communities &amp; work with your local gov. to #BanAssaultWeapons in your city. We will help you: https://t.co/Yx1qDD3NVW
This is a defining moment. The time is now to engage meaningfully w/ power structures in order to return #PowerToWeThePeople. That‚Äôs why Councilwoman @TaraLSamples &amp; I are pushing the #OH legislature to #BanAssaultWeapons in #Ohio: https://t.co/Yx1qDD3NVW
This same man, @RichCordray who helped crush EVERY city‚Äôs ability to write ANY laws protecting children from assault weapons is now the Democratic. establishment candidate in this #OHGov race.
‚Ä¶.@RichCordray was instrumental in the  massive shift away from #PowerToWeThePeople, to ‚ÄòPower To The Gun Lobbyists.‚Äô making our children, our schools and communities very vulnerable.
(3/10) Simultaneously, @RichCordray paved way for U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010 that made it impossible 4 cities to protect their own people w/ gun laws. #HomeRule was overturned in favor of state government control‚Ä¶‚Äô
(2/10) Here‚Äôs why cities can‚Äôt #BanAssaultWeapons: In 1991, Cle. enacted legislation for an #AssaultWeaponsBan. 19 yrs later, overturned.		Why? Bc newly-elected Dem. OH Attorney Gen. &amp; NRA champion @RichCordray led the charge to strike it ‚¨áÔ∏è in a case called Cleveland vs State.
(1/10) I‚Äôm running for #OHGov to bring #PowerToWeThePeople. That means standing up to the lobbyists &amp; legislators putting $$ over the safety of our kids. Today, I‚Äôm saying #EnoughIsEnough, &amp; calling to #BanAssaultWeapons: https://t.co/Yx1qDD3NVW
(5) Next up: Review &amp; release. 		"When elected, Councilwoman @TaraLSamples and I will immediately create program to review all non-violent, drug-related convictions on a case-by-case basis. As #OHGov and #LtGov, speedy review will = speedy release."		#PowerToWeThePeople
To reiterate ‚Äì Councilwoman @TaraLSamples and I have committed to an executive order ending ALL private for-profit prisons in #OH.  		#CriminalJusticeReform = #EndPrisonForProfit = #PowerToWeThePeople https://t.co/e9n6gHMC4z
(4) ÔøºWhen elected, Councilwoman @TaraLSamples &amp; I will issue an executive order ending for-profit prisons in #OH. Order will state that NO person convicted of ANY offense shall be sent to any for-profit facility ‚Äì period.		#EndPrisonsForProfit = #PowerToWeThePeople https://t.co/0YOPrEMPRJ
Let me say that again. And again. And again.		#EndTheComplex #FillJobsNotJails #PowerToWeThePeople #Kucinich4Ohio https://t.co/3rdbnX6KNX
(3) "We must END the #prisonindustrialcomplex. We must stop wasting taxpayer $$ on warehousing nonviolent offenders. We shouldn't be filling jails ‚Äì we should be filling jobs."		#Kucinich4Ohio = #CriminalJusticeReform = #PowerToWeThePeople https://t.co/wj10L6o7Om
(2) "Our current system = shameful record. It disproportionately targets, jails &amp; discriminates against African American and Latino communities. Mass incarceration devastates minority &amp; low-income #Ohioans. We cannot have true justice w/o true reform."		https://t.co/OgcfqZtwr6 https://t.co/6hhrwwXORV
