Congratulations to Arizona Senator @kyrstensinema for smashing her own personal record. #IronWoman https://t.co/wLHdiIDchs
The @TFOB is a great Tucson tradition that I've been lucky enough to be part of in the past. Here's a guide from @TucsonStar on how to make the most of the weekend -&gt;  	https://t.co/9SeVWMJOnb
When you’re aboard the shuttle and bad stuff happens, you have to work the problem as a team. We didn't dismiss ideas based on who offered them. When the life of the crew and the success of the mission depend on it, leadership is finding a way forward, together. https://t.co/TWW0mLS6rn
Protecting our way of life in Arizona means tackling drought, and that starts with using data, facts, and science to address climate change. #ForArizona 	https://t.co/4zqtfTQvRa
It's a testament to your courage, Gabby, and the courage of so many advocates you helped bring together to make this happen. This is an important step forward to make our communities safer from gun violence. So proud of you today &amp; every day for how hard you work to help others. https://t.co/BpD2rO3AYA
I never expected my journey to bring me here – Gabby was the Member of Congress in the family, the woman who taught me everything I know about how to use policy to improve people’s lives. But this isn’t about me, it’s about all of us and our shared mission. #ForArizona https://t.co/0Ra5Bf8q6I
If you want to make sure we take care of our veterans, providing them the care and services they earned, this is the team for you. #FullSpeedAhead #ForArizona
The Grand Canyon looks great from space, but even better up close. An Arizona treasure that we must continue to protect. #100YearsofGrand https://t.co/ckvwSQsT0S

It means so much to have @GabbyGiffords introduce me at the launch for my campaign for U.S. Senate. She has been working hard on a new speech that she is excited for everyone to hear. Her inspiration and support is what makes all of this possible.
Tucson native Emma McMahon will also be speaking. She was a congressional page for Gabby. She and her mom were at the Jan 8th shooting in Tucson, and her mom was injured but thankfully survived. Emma has the honor of introducing...you guessed it: my wonderful wife @GabbyGiffords.
The launch will be opened by Senator @Jamescita Peshlakai, a member of the Navajo Nation and fellow veteran who represents northeast Arizona in the State Senate. She has been a valuable part of my campaign team as Treasurer and we're excited to have her in Tucson!
For all of you coming to Hotel Congress today for our Tucson launch, wanted to share some exciting news about the program and who else will be joining me there. First of all, the music you'll hear as you enter will be performed by Ruben Moreno and his group Mariachi Luz de Luna.
Like most of you, @GabbyGiffords and I were pretty surprised by all of the snow in Tucson this morning... https://t.co/xPWUzlW9Qs

Because it's #LoveYourPetDay, I wanted you to meet Nelson, Gabby's service dog. Nelson is 8, which I remember because he was born during my last shuttle mission.

For the victims and the families left behind of the Aurora shooting, we must do better. My heart is with the survivors and my gratitude with the officers who were wounded trying to end this horrific act.
Americans deserve to be safe when they go to work or to school. But shootings like today’s show we’re not.
Data and facts must be at the center of this decision, not political maneuvering. Declaring a national emergency to circumvent the Constitution is Washington at its worst.
Like many Arizonans, I have been to the border and understand we have to use the right solutions in the right places to secure it. And I've listened to people who live and work along the border who agree that building a wall along every mile is NOT an effective solution.
They also give us a core responsibility: Children deserve to be safe in schools, in their homes, and in their communities. It's a solemn responsibility and one that requires leadership. It's not a partisan issue. It's an American issue, and one we must work together to achieve.
From tragedy often emerges strength. Gabby and I are inspired every day by the courage of students from Parkland and across the nation who in the aftermath of this tragedy stood up and demanded that their government do something to reduce gun violence. They give us so much hope.
One year later, all I can think about are the families and friends of the students and educators who were killed, how they grieve every day for those who were shot in their school and taken from us. Their pain and loss is as fresh today as it was one year ago.
Like so many of you, I can still remember the pain I felt when I learned of the Parkland shooting.
@colchester1 @GabbyGiffords Ha! That’s great. Thank you for your support! Tell Mark and Kelly I said hello. I hope to see all three of you on the trail!

We are a daring country. A bold country. An innovative country. A country that tackles big things. Anyone who believes that but isn’t rolling up their sleeves to address this problem is compromised. #Parkland
There are things we can do to stop this. But first, we need a president who will acknowledge our gun violence problem and work toward solutions. We need elected leaders at every level of government who stand up to the gun lobby, look at the research &amp; act to protect our children
He failed to do anything when a gunman killed 26 people praying at a church in Sutherland Springs. And thus far, he’s failed to address the fact that America has experienced 18 school shootings already this year.
The President failed to acknowledge our nation's gun violence crisis after the Congressional Baseball shooting in Alexandria. He failed to take action after hundreds were shot and 58 killed at a concert in Las Vegas.

@JohnsHopkinsSPH This bill is an early Christmas present to the gun lobby. The only things that concealed carry reciprocity does is help the bottom line of the gun lobby and gun manufacturers and make communities less safe. https://t.co/BwozXBYxcC
The research is clear: strong gun laws save lives. @JohnsHopkinsSPH found that states that loosened concealed carry laws had more violent crime. https://t.co/S04c1hXe6e
Concealed carry reciprocity is bad for public safety. It would make it nearly impossible for law enforcement officers to make sure that people who are carrying guns in public are doing so legally— which is why nearly every national law enforcement group opposes it.
The House Judiciary Committee just passed a gun lobby-backed bill that would make it legal for untrained people to carry loaded, hidden guns in more public places. #StopCCR

Reading commission recommendations to President on human spaceflight. Interesting! Here it is: http://ow.ly/oEZs
Busy week here at JSC. Orion meetings and some of my first STS134 training. Why does it always start with a test?
@ciholmer To 300mph Top Fuel Dragsters are quicker.  But no contest with Space Shuttle after that. 0-17,500mph in 8.5 min.
Watching friend Bob Tasca race in the US Nationals Drag Racing Championship.  0-300 mph in a few seconds.  Now that it fast!
@StationCDRKelly As you can tell, this is no contest.  But good luck with that anyway.
Just watched this morning's Meet The Press. The healthcare debate is again the focus.  Going for a swim.
@StationCDRKelly I'm just heading out on my bike. Stay out of my way!

@Space_Pete We already started training and yes all the crew members know eachother.  The Astronaut Office is the 6th floor of a Bldg at JSC
@spacefreak1991 As a shuttle Cdr we don't train for EVAs but we are short on people so I got stuck with this development run.
About to cram myself into the EMU for 6 hours underwater.   http://yfrog.com/5dz8sbj
