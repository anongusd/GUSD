@susanjones1968 @SenSchumer sad that you support one hypocrite while condemning another.  do you think for yourself ever? or go with the herd to feel acceptance always?
@SenSchumer that doesn't apply to you as well? How long have you been a Senator? How many times have you flipped 180* on an issue to be re elected or because you personally benefited?

@Joelsherman1 what's wrong with Mattingly? LHP Garcia pitching tonight, and Guerrero sitting....again... he really needs to be fired.
@MadDogUnleashed Even arguing that DiMaggio was a better hitter than Williams shows your level of understanding of the game.
@JoeyBats19 They hit the ball, you catch it, and throw it as hard as possible and injure your shoulder.
@JoeyBats19 Does every throw that makes your shoulder hurt remind you of how dumb you are?

@RealSkipBayless someone should make it worth their while when retaliating against @matthewdelly.  Too bad Horford's People's Elbow missed.
@Ken_Rosenthal What did people expect out of this team? I remember when Jay Bruce was touted "the next larry walker" as a prospect... LOL
@matthewdelly do you attempt to make up for your lack of basketball skill by hurting and getting others ejected? Taj Gibson, Korver, Horford
@Rachel__Nichols D-dova is a worm.He wrapped his legs around Taj Gibson's legs and got him ejected,injured Korver, jumped into Horfords legs
@Joelsherman1 What does Alex Guerrero have to do to get regular ABs? Good god.  What a way to waste and kill a hot streak.
@Joelsherman1 how terrible is Bryan Price as a manager, to not DL Mesoraco, and he has 1 pinch hit AB since April 11? Is it to spite media?
@robneyer Do you believe that Bryan Price purposefully kept Mesoraco off of the DL and was vague about his return, just to spite the media?
@whygavs So readers who are Reds fans, would rather know trivial info, than have their team in a better spot to win?.. modern fans...lol...
@whygavs  and big difference between thinking the reporter should be FORCED to adhere to those standards and believing in hometown loyalty
@MikeAndMike you guys probably love that @MadDogUnleashed has a TV show now.  Mike Greenberg's no longer the dumbest and most annoying on tv
@MikeAndMike How the hell does Mike Greenberg talk about sports for a living?  It's  like Mike Golic at a Mensa meeting.
@robneyer that's what I mean, it's not his job.  It's all about personal advancement in the modern world.
@whygavs @robneyer What happened to loyalty and not putting your career and money above all else?
@MadDogUnleashed How many times are you gonna call Devin Mesoraco, Morasco? How do you host an MLB show and not know who that is?
#HIGHHEAT who the hell is Morasco? You have a show dedicated to baseball and you butcher a starting catcher's name like that? Jesus....
@Joelsherman1 wasn't it Chad Motolla(sp?) not CJ?
@PressSec all of the good little reporters who would never ask an actual question...that's why they're allowed in there.
@based_ball nice tactic. I mean the "drop after crossing the plate we don't get to see" that YOU said.  it's flat if no brk b4 hit zone
@based_ball isn't it supposed to move when it gets to the plate or right before?hence not a quality pitch and "flat" if it hasn't broken yet

@tpolamalu I always think your picture is Weird Al Yankovic hahahahaha
@zbritton literally heard this last week..."why is people so stupid?"
I'd cut off my left arm to be ambidextrous
@MelissaMB19 LMAO.  I have forgotten more about baseball than you ever will know.  Been Reds fan since 5 years old....please.
@cgrand14 You look locked in at the plate lately.  Loading up with perfect timing and attacking the ball.
@MelissaMB19 I love the Reds.  I just demand more from them.  I know they are talented, and capable of winning.  That's why I get angry lol
@MelissaMB19 Why do you defend him like he's your friend? lol.  He plays for the Reds.  He sucked in the playoffs.  Dont you want to win?
@MelissaMB19 that's the thing.  Champions don't celebrate unt they've actually won.  They won the division...that's the first step. #amateur
@MelissaMB19 I play video games on the computer? We both got the same number of hits in the playoffs last year.  We both got as many wins.
@MelissaMB19 So you're happy with a team that has the MVP but wears robes on the field and has cigars, and then gets torched in the 1st rnd?
@DatDudeBP @CincinnatiReds you sure Chapman didn't say "que?", rather than "K?"?.....hahahahahaha, Hows your espanol son?
@DatDudeBP @MelissaMB19 Votto walks around like he thinks he's Iron Mike Tyson or somethin.  Tell him to get a hit in the playoffs first.
@mrLeCure hard times from the past, make us stronger in the future, and appreciate the good times more.
RT @JimGaffigan: Can we stop with the holidays?  Iâ€™d like to go 4 days without feeling like I have to get drunk, eat candy or buy someon ...
@BrettAnderson49 That curveball is a thing of beauty man....keep twirling gems this year.
@michael_schlact Swag=Downtown Anderson from "Semi-Pro" before he learns to be a real teammate.
@michael_schlact that's probably to your credit sir lol
@DatDude Dude you're an all-star, why do you have to flaunt your stats and plays on here like you dont think you belong? #LETtalentTALK
@michael_schlact @DatDudeBP anyone who talks about "swag" is some streetballin asshole.....confidence is what you need
@AtBats Looks like Jose Bautista is showing us great examples of loading with great timing, so far this season

@jeczaja the govt always has to have an enemy for people to fear.  when afraid people do not think with logic.
@jeczaja People are spoonfed propaganda since birth.  Any info that bursts their little fabricated bubble of "life" they somehow push aside.
@michael_schlact @discohayes hahahaha that's awesome.  Does it have a quadraphonic blaupunkt?
@discohayes @michael_schlact so which one of you is Nuke Laloosh?
@j_nic_66 people are raised on tv, and tv is carefully produced for our consumption.  If u don't realize its propaganda you get #brainwashed

@JimCarrey or that's exactly what they WOULD tell you so you would think exactly that.
@j_nic_66  Ppl are so brainwashed that not only do they not think for themselves.  They persecute those who do. #HegelianPrinciple
@jparencibia9 When u joining @Lunchboxhero45 in AAA?  Kyle Drabek and his 21bb/25K should already be there.

@AaronBoone_ESPN did you ever face Colon when he was with Cle, or Ana, or Montreal? does he look similar if so?(his stuff not his toad head)
@Kurkjian_ESPN @Buster_ESPN Can any1 tell me why managers run a SP back out in 6th with 98pitches, but pull a guy after 8 with 90 pitches?
@seanhannity Why is it a profound day? This feels like the script to a comic book.  Why do you play along?
@danecook dude that is weak.  Why are all comedians on Twitter, fucking stupid? Where is the spontaneous comedy? hollow tipped jelly beans?
@Susan_Shan @bbainbridge Sanchez looks like the man to close in that bullpen.  I think it's 17k 2bb....that's Dennis Eckersley territory
@seanhannity so publicizing the death of bin Laden and enflaming tensions when it didn't need to be announced is safer?  #YouArentRealBright
@TommyHanson48 dude your delivery when you bring the ball back,looks like Roy Halladay. Is that on purpose or just how you learned to pitch?

@GAlexander21 what? their tee time? lol
@toriihunter48 luckily you only hit 20% of the time right?
@RaysJoeMaddon Why do you continually bring pitchers back out for a 7th or 8th inning after roughly 100 pitches?  without fail they are hit.

@08ricardo08 Im just speculating man, I dont know FOR SURE...but just knowing Fox, and how TV is, they like to bump that stuff up lol.
@DAVIDprice14 Do you know fellow Vandy Commodore Pedro Alvarez?  You guys are representing Vanderbilt to the fullest!
@DAVIDprice14 @08ricardo08 I'm a Reds fan, from Cincy, and although Chapman BRINGS IT....I highly doubt 106mph.  maybe 102?
@CEC0208 @RickyRo24 @jparencibia9 @2Morrow23 @Lunchboxhero45 @JesseLitsch @JoeyBats19 u might not be missin Snider too much longer LOL

@DatDudeBP Great win vs Beermakers BP!  #3hitday  Do you like hittin 4th behind Joey and Bruce 2nd?
@michael_schlact what Metallica gets you pumped before a start?
@jimrome Dude Jim Everett punked you out hardcore.  That's still one of my favorite videos ever!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHA.  CHRIS!
@gordonbeckham Go get some ass tonight, and you'll be rakin again in no time!!!
Logan Ondrusek is FILTHY!!!! #BADASS
@jimrome When have you ever seen Marc Gasol shed a tear on the court? or mishandle a pass directly under the basket late in the 4th? lol.
@ajcbraves Any word about the long term prognosis for the back condition Heyward has?  I read about it briefly at start of season.
@JimGaffigan "I haven't had a banana in a month."  been laughing at that one all day.  Thank you! lol
@jimrome Get of LA's nuts.  Marc Gasol is a way better post player, ALL AROUND than pussy ass crying Pau.
@michael_schlact sweet.  You did idolize Greg Maddux haha.
Cmon CQ.  Let's take Soriano YARD here.
@michael_schlact what kinda change you throw?
@mortreport @joegrizzly81 No one knows, that's the thing.  Courts and govt proceedings are so mucked up with mumbo jumbo so no one CAN know.
Jay Bruce with a HR off LHP Chris Narveson.  First XBH given up by Narveson to a lefty ALL SEASON.  Great sign for struggling Bruce.
@Kurkjian_ESPN How long have you covered baseball? How did you break into the business? its my dream job now that Im 30 and can't play lol
@willrhymes doesn't help that the right and left field porches are slightly farther than a tee ball fence either.
@pattonoswalt it's hilarious how smug you are and you misspell a 6 letter, city name.  AHAHAHAHAHAHA
@CCC6 not a problem.  Lol I bet, I feel Josh Hamilton's trade is my generation's Frank trade lol
@ErinAndrews @mpbrinkmann @ESPN_Michelle all the tweets about sports sent to her, and this is what she RTs? HAHAHAHAHA
@OMGFactsSex about the same percent that would say they haven't and think people believe them.
@One2zero4 @mchippo4 @michael_schlact I'd have to go with Eric Davis as #1 for me.  Then Randy Johnson, Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, Pedro...
@DugUncensored I was at FYE and glanced and saw UHF.  Had to buy it #watchingitRIGHTNOW
@jimrome You think Jerry Lucas would have that mindset?  Sports has changed because people care about this type of stuff above all.
@jimrome No REAL athlete would care about what's "trending".
@CCC6 I heard all about Frank Robinson too.  Mostly when he was cursing The Reds for trading him lol #TripleCrownWinnerTheNextYear
@CCC6 my dad would always tell me about watching Roberto Clemente play. He was a Reds fan through and through, but said Clemente was amazing
@michael_schlact @SocalPirates ouch that has to hurt...i can just see Barry Bonds throwing home, and speedster Sid Bream sliding home SAFE!!
@CCC6 @michael_schlact I dont think I said Pittsburgh heros lol
@michael_schlact Chipper best switch hitter since Mantle.  Maddux was/is one of my favorite pitchers to watch ever.  89mph paint the black.
#FNawesome, I grew up within 20 miles of where Walter Alston, Kennesaw Mountain Landis, Aaron Cook, and Jim Tracy were born
@Buster_ESPN The fastball/change combo is what made him dominant 2 years ago.  Looks like he's finally that pitcher again, tonight at least.
@terrellowens GL TO!!!  Cincy fan but Mike Brown blows!!!  can I get a RT if u agree? lol
@michael_schlact Who was ur childhood baseball hero?
@michael_schlact If baseball is in your blood, you can't NOT watch #MLB.  I've been hooked since 7 years old.  #CANTimagineBEINGinurshoes
@Buster_ESPN I'd love to ask him why he thinks a pitcher should be run back out for the 6th when they are at roughly 100 pitches
against LH? or all? what other 2? Massett? Marmol?  RT @KrisMedlen Jonny Venters is easily in the top 3 nastiest pitchers in the game.
@Buster_ESPN the stan musial bobblehead looks frustrated after whiffing at a curveball?  That's about as close to Jay Bruce as it gets
@Britt_Ghiroli especially impressive after 2bb 2H in first inning to have the final line he did....awesome start.
@Buster_ESPN I see flashes of a Mark Teixeira glove at first when watching Votto now,sometimes. Tex D is obviously superior but similarities
Mike Leake leads all pitchers in steals.....hahahaha
It's Jake Westbrook, lets hit, fellas!!!!
Sounds like my dad when I pitched in little league.  He ended up sitting in his truck more times than not....haha! RT@scotteyre47
@keithlaw @604Cardona Its not a lack of sense of humor.  It's contempt for a mediocre baseball mind sounding smug as hell.
@CEC0208 Dude just dropped you in my league! I snagged you off the wire real quick, good luck man!
@BLarkin_ESPN Barry, lifelong Reds fan.  Was 8 in 1988 when AS game was in Cincy.  When is GABP gonna host an AS game? ITS TIME!
@reds_raw bullshit.  Mike Leake is a punk ass that was stealing shit.  THe Reds have a PR department to say things JUST like this.....BS!!!!
@LoMoMarlins pick you up?  I drafted your ass, get off those crutches and tuck your string in and play! lol
@danecook DUDE Thank you, I needed something to watch tonight.  Smelly markers was the shit!....
@MikeStanton27 what a treat, comin in off the bench to face gas throwin Drew Storen.  GL this season
@TheChizKid I just picked you up in my league.  Stashing you til you get the call up haha.
@Britt_Ghiroli lol that's cool.  Do your thing :)
@Britt_Ghiroli its JJ Hardy....is he worth 3 separate tweets? lol
@BrettAnderson49 Trevor Cahill looked masterful tonight!!!
@BrianWilson38 so do you drop acid during games as well? or just on offdays? lol
@dgoold @MU4124 I wonder if Rogers Hornsby had a worse start that year than Pujols this year? #ContractSTRESS
RT@jcrasnick Cause ur not real bright.
I wonder how often Walt Jocketty thinks to himself "Why did they trade Josh Hamilton for THIS guy?" when Volquez yet again fails to go 6inn.
@DugUncensored I just watched PeeWee's Big Adventure last night hahaha!  #LargeMargeSentMe
@dgoold That's cool, I've really come to appreciate and respect international soccer the past few years.  Zidane got me into soccer.
@TonyPlagman Ok, then how about Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On"? hahaha....
@dgoold Point taken.  Do you have a team u root for?
@316_Nation hahahahah, sup prick

@dgoold Enjoy the Reds leading the NL central all year.  Quit worrying bout the cards, they're gonna lose, regardless. #CARDS78-84in'11
@dgoold baseball is something you never say never about, but I'd venture to say the 6 hit, zero run and out thing has NEVER happened.
@dgoold so what IS Freese's new walkup music?
@Benak86 @Buster_ESPN With Showalter, they actually have balls now.
@Buster_ESPN That sounds alot like Selig talking about the players from the 80's to early 2000s.  Any truth comes after the fact...way after
@JoeStrauss Same people must have counted votes in 2000 and 2004 presidential elections
@jimrome This would be the perfect time for another "Heidi" game lol
@RealJayWilliams Jeremy Lam's forearm's are as long as most people's whole arm lol.  He is gonna tear it up next year.
@ErinAndrews me too lol, my dad played AAU ball with Larry Bird, heard all about the Celts.  McHale best NBA post player ever.
That block even SOUNDED fking great.  #GETITOUTTAHERE
@dgoold I think Troy Tulowitzki's "Party in the USA" is hilarious.  I lost all respect for Joey Votto when I heard lil Jon or some garbage
@AroundTheHorn Sneaking in a walker texas ranger? doesn't that result in death?
@TDFINN @Buster_ESPN ya think? dont be a jackass.  Rafael Belliard, Ozzie Smith hit HRs with frequency of Andrus..#known4THEIRhrINFREQUENCY
Dan Okrent, the inventor of Fantasy Baseball, also INVENTED the WHIP stat.
@TDFINN @Buster_ESPN How many ABs w/o a homer in big leagues?
@lazybears @JoeStrauss @dgoold Is everyone forgetting they played the Reds for 3 games?  What else did you expect? #RedsNLChamps
@tara_novotny Cool no prob.  I have one Twin, Liriano, and after his 1st start, I'm rethinking that pick in hindsight lol
Baseball is purer than life; it's symmetrical, fair, and dignified. There's no debating what happened: it happened. -Dan Okrent
@tara_novotny Yeah, I feel that.  GL with your team :)  its not even a week in yet, but I'm very happy with most of my roster.
@seanhannity new and improved website?  Did you scrap all the opinion based content and actually report NEWS????
@MatthewBerryTMR Don't slurp him right there in line Berry.  #Iknowmorestatsthanyou
@AtBats That has to be an indescribable feeling of satisfaction to pass on knowledgeand philosophy to a raw hitter and see them succeed.
Ken Burns' "Baseball" series is one of the greatest productions ever.
The baseball diamond....the white chalk lines encompassing a gem so bright, it has to be covered in dirt.
@HuffPostWorld So KSM is the person who planted all those bombs in WTC 1,2 and 7?
@mlbtraderumors I'm expecting a big return season for Bedard.  Pitching at Safeco and feeling healthy will = 15W sub 3 ERA
@Buster_ESPN  pretty obvious. Tabata, Walker, Alvarez....Who do the Astros have of this caliber rookie/2nd year? Wallce hasn't hit MLB P yet
@610SportsKC They came across his game with the Cards several years back I'm guessing?  the 10BB game was the clincher #wegottagetthisguy
For anyone who still believes the govt's story abt 9/11, look up "Building 7".  How do 2 towers disintegrate from top to bottom?

how can an athlete be taken seriously called "muffin mcgraw"?
@DaPerfectWorld @kirkmorrison55 Hey I made a mistake....I was dumb lol I can admit it.  I know 10000x more about baseball...a real sport lol
@ZMiller86 there gonna be a league? lol
@ZMiller86 Yahoo has that option to choose DL/DB/D players, and u draft individual guys.  Patrick Willis goes before some offensive players
@kirkmorrison55 touche, a 2nd rate tight end changed teams and I didn't keep up with it...my bad.  #lockout #greedypricks

@2PaidandPop @kirkmorrison55 u cared enough to respond.....FK you
@injuryexpert Dusty is a veteran's manager.  That's why Jonny "I wish I had Pat Burrell's fielding skills" Gomes starts over Heisey
@injuryexpert Rolen is A BIG MAN lol
@gordonbeckham You're under .500 now....whats the problem!?!?!?! Quentin is hitting .625...when u gonna start hitting? lol
@tara_novotny it depends on your scoring format and who you already have.  All things equal, I'd say Hamels is more valuable overall.
@kirkmorrison55 youve blown up my timeline....you're kirk morrison...you're unfollowed lol
@DAVIDprice14 @hazemacfly615 I've heard that Austin jackson has some game.  After Greinke bball injury, prob no pick up games lol
I hope every man feels that way, then our world would be better RT@JoseCanseco My father was the greatest man I ever new 	.
@DingeldeinDem Do you have a sheet of acid and a dictionary over there or something?
Did he have you Nuke Laloosh style in the clubhouse pregame? RT@Britt_Ghiroli Luke scott has a right groin strain hes day to day.
@dgoold Who do you expect the first Cards prospect to be called up?
@MatthewBerryTMR @tnbui Start Wandy at home, THAT'S IT!!!  I dont trust him away, especially at Philadelphia. Berry should know this.
@Britt_Ghiroli held? or are the Rays terrible? lol Look what Jeremy Guthrie did to them last night...he's not usually a dominant starter
@LaBlynne @michael_schlact @MLB I like the names Pronk, Big Donkey, Big unit, Spaceman, Rapid Robert....etc
@injuryexpert so what's their excuse for his decline during the entire 2nd half last year? lol  cuticle? haha
@danecook isn't that called prostitution?
@cardinalswire Pujols, more runs scored in first 10 years of career than career runs leader RICKY HENDERSON!!!
@gordonbeckham and CQ are raking!!!!!!!!! Good thing I knew this and drafted you both haha
RT @gordonbeckham: Carlos Quentin for President! Dude is hot! #crushingtheball
@MatthewBerryTMR started Beckham, Quentin, Lind, Morrison yesterday!!! Kershaw day before.  too bad Tulo and Cano haven't gotten a hit yet
@HulkHogan4Real Makes me think of your WM 7 match vs. Sgt. Slaughter with blade work.  Referee Hebner hurries to pick it up off the mat haha
@RichardWiseman hahahaha, already there man
@Shanikacwtmt #ScottPilgrim was a great movie!
@RichardWiseman Every tweet I read from you, makes me angry, and I feel alot of contempt.
@Lunchboxhero45 Way to take your walks. That's the first key in busting out for a monster year!!!
@jparencibia9 Too bad you're stuck in the AL East with 2 giant bank accounts
@jparencibia9 Reminded me of your first game like this last year! lol.  I like your lineup.  Snider, Lind, Bautista, you...could be a big yr
@injuryexpert Touche!
@SportsUp2Date duh....you don't know the slogan? THE NBA, WHERE AMAZING HAPPENS! HAHA
@injuryexpert That HBP from Big Time Timmy Jim on his elbow looked BAD last night.  In a TERRIBLE spot on the arm, looked very painful.
@AtBats What in your eyes is Jason Heyward's most outstanding quality as a hitter?  I was disappointed to read about his back condition.
@tara_novotny I'm a big Pavano fan....he will do that from time to time tho, and being opening day for Twins, just write it off and move on!
@SportsUp2Date Now that's a good ?.  I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say Andy Pettitte
@SportsUp2Date I hope you dont get paid for your sports "insights".  Right on the money with your Mets beating Josh Johnson prediction...ha!
@gordonbeckham that's what I'm talkin about!!! Awesome opening day Gordon!
good thing I started Carlos Quentin today.  @Lomomarlins was probably up til 3 wondering if he had 15k followers yet.
@PressSec Doesn't Obama look like the Grinch when he grins like that?
@AdamSchefter match your donation? are you gonna match your salary for us so we can?
@jaysonst  When to expect Mike Trout or Lonnie Chisenhall?
@SportsUp2Date fun fact. My Cincinnati Reds took Chad Mottola over Derek Jeter in the draft.  #suckmynuts #youknowshitaboutsports
@SportsUp2Date actually I heard it during the game telecast yesterday.  And your fun fact was directly from your knowledge?  ur very stupid
@SportsUp2Date Albert Pujols has more runs scored in the first 10 years to start his career than Ricky Henderson.
@jaysonst Mike Hampton and Jose Lima were badasses that year too
@FreddieFreeman lookin at ur box score yesterday...shouldn't you be in the cage?
@jimrome Matt Barnes is a punk ass piece of trash.
@HeathBell21 you're not gonna be replaced by Adams or Gregerson as closer! April fools!  That's DEFINITELY gonna happen lol
@michael_schlact you talk more about yourself than any other ball player on here.  is it because u don't really believe ur gonna make it?
@RichardWiseman dude you are the most pretensious, ignorant bastard i've read in a while.
@SportsUp2Date DID YOU KNOW?!...THAT was the lamest fact I've read in a while.
@LoMoMarlins So do you want 15k followers for monetary reasons? or are you just an image driven asshole? lol
@BrettAnderson49 Dude! Gushers are awesome!
@SportsUp2Date The Mets get a W?  You seem confident with Mike Pelfrey facing Josh Johnson.
@CharlesOakley34 Could you even play in this pansy league now?  You'd be called for a flagrant 2 every game haha
@Lunchboxhero45 One better way to start the season...facin Carl Pavano who you've eaten for breakfast like many a slab o bacon haha
@LoMoMarlins you better be gettin ready for Mike Pelfrey Tomorrow.  He K'd ur ass once in 3ABs last year.
@keithlaw @Buster_ESPN WHY? WHY? WHY? Why did the Reds trade Josh Hamilton?  I'm not saying this in hindsight, I've felt this way since day1

@nate_robinson you can take the man out of the hood, but you can't take the hood out of the man.
@KingJames too bad you didn't go to college to learn how to count so you could realize you travel every time you touch the ball.
@LoMoMarlins Your BB/K rate was insane for a young player.  Looking forward to seeing you explode with more xbh, and walk bout 100 times
When did the NBA amend the traveling rule to state that only 1 out of 10 walking violations would be called?
@nate_robinson you belong in AND1, you're not an NBA player.  Quit the flashy stupid stuff, and learn fundamental basketball.
@HuffPostEnt It's airing in America, and I'm outraged lol.
