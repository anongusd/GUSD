@LLubsch You are correct, Dr. Lubsch! We believe in solidarity, equity and inclusion!
We challenge #SIUE to use the Rock to advance our goals of solidarity, equity &amp; inclusion, &amp; bring people together &amp; improve our campus. 4/4
#SIUE stands for a climate of collaboration and cooperation, along with a welcoming and supportive environment. 3/4
While #SIUE supports messages that challenge white supremacy, this use of profanity runs counter to our campus culture. 2/4
Our Rock was painted yesterday w/offensive profanity that undermines SIUE‚Äôs tradition of civil discourse &amp; respect. 1/4
