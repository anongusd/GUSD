@robreiner @AmandaFritzRN Also @RalphNader has done as much or more for the American people than any of the others you mentioned.
@robreiner @AmandaFritzRN Not to mention most importantly the election was STOLEN by judicial fiat. Demonizing third party candidates is undemocratic and plays into the two party prison that vomited trump up.
@robreiner @AmandaFritzRN WRONG. There were at least ten other third party candidates running in 2000 who got more votes than gores loss margin to bush in Florida. Blame them too? Also Gore lost his home state and ran an uninspiring death penalty approving campaign.
Right as the US is on the verge of a legitimate peace deal in Afghanistan we are putting the pieces in place for a coup in Venezuela. No more unnecessary military intervention abroad

@LLAmos @CapehartJ I said A key reason and was careful to phrase it that way. Much of what you mentioned also had an impact but ignoring Clintons role in her own defeat is dangerous for 2020. It was a change election and trump despite his awfulness represented change for many people
@KGiles59 @CapehartJ Oh I‚Äôm well aware of what you‚Äôre talking about. I was just curious what specific Russian misinformation you think actually cost Bernie bros to flip an election one way or the other. I‚Äôve seen the Russian ad buys on Facebook and Twitter. They aren‚Äôt earth shattering
@KGiles59 @CapehartJ I was just asking for specifics since it sounded like you were just repeating a general talking point.
