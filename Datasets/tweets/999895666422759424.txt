Both men are viewed with deep animosity by the core supporters of the leader of their party, @realDonaldTrump . It is truly historic that the former members of a national ticket, are now the outsiders within the party they once hoped to lead to the White House.
When Romney picked Ryan as his VP running mate, it was seen as a pick that would unite the Republican Party. While Romney's image has largely recovered from the beating it took in his campaign against @BarackObama, Ryan now only has an approval rating of 12 percent.
Today, @SpeakerRyan will end his tenure in the House of Representatives. His former running mate @MittRomney will be sworn in as the U.S. Senator from Utah. 6 years ago few would have thought that Ryan's political career would be over, and Romney's would be revived.
