@JoyAnnReid It is partly the responsibility of the media to educate the public about facts. Every time you mention “Socialism” in connection w/AO-C or @BernieSanders w/o clarifying that they’re not Socialists, but rather that they embrace Democratic Socialist ideals, you FAIL.
@JoyceWhiteVance As to your comment that @BernieSanders has a “socialist” problem, to whatever extent he may, it’s the fault of the media (part of whose job is to educate the public). And to your characterization of Sanders as less well-known (untrue), again: media’s fault.

@nickconfessore FYI: Saying “It is important to note that” to preface your statement is not just wordy; it’s tantamount to saying “You aren’t smart enough to understand the complexity of this issue, so I’ll hit you over the head when you need to listen closely.”
@TheSWPrincess @Amy_Siskind I’m aware of and use GovTrack. The graphic standing alone represents “information” only to the extent that it contains raw data *suggestive* of information. I offered a theory about what other information the data in the graphic might represent, and I stand by it.
@GovernorKayIvey Please don’t join those culpable for the wrongful conviction of Rocky Meyers! If you allow him to be put to death, you join the ranks of those with his blood on their hands! He is innocent, &amp; the judicial override that allowed his sentence is now illegal in AL!
@Amy_Siskind Interesting. What this graphic could also suggest is which of these candidates introduced legislation favoring the highest # of donors + got support from others who also received the same donations = had that legislation passed.
@lynnv378 Interesting question, and I don’t have an answer because I don’t think race comes into it. 		When you’ve finished this inquiry, though, I’d be interested to know why some POC refer to other people as “folk.” I tried that once and had a POC dress me down for being disrespectful.
@zachhaller You could be right about the “positive spin at the end” thing; I’ve never read anything of yours through to the end. I prefer less emotional material.
@zachhaller I just realized something. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything you’ve written that was positive or that extolled the virtues of anyone or anything. How utterly miserable you must be. I’m terribly sorry.

@julietemmer @leonorej99 @EndDeportations He “continued to show opposition towards Hillary when she became the Democratic candidate,” you mean like that time he got on stage with her at the convention and endorsed her, then went on to campaign for her? That opposition? Is that the opposition you mean?
@Rosemarie4311 @leonorej99 @EndDeportations The truth that “Her” never told her sycophantic followers is that neo-Libs hate Bernie because they know he’d be a risk to their millions in corporate election bribes. #wakeupandsmellthedeception

@GTS206 @EndDeportations @BobRook8 Oh good heavens. So he doesn’t want to be forced to vote the way the Dem majority leader instructs.  What’s the problem with independence? He probably voted w/the Dems more often than some nominal Dems, but because they have the right logo, that’s ok w/you!

@NetflixFilm Wishing I lived in Manchester UK...mate.
But ahead of a possible presidential bid, Biden has now said he “owes her an apology.” It’s obvious that 2020 is shaping up to be the same song, second verse for Senator Sanders with establishment Dems and their leash-dog media.
Just moments after this dire prediction, the same panel discussed Joe Biden—the man who disastrously led the 1991 Anita Hill hearings—with something between affection and hero worship. Did ole Joe apologize to Prof. Hill at the time? No.
Journalists immediately pounced on the apparently resurrected Sanders story (where were these allegations in the press since 2016?), demanding his reaction.  What a nice little softball video interview lobbed to the talking heads to set up the “unelectable” narrative.
Don’t get me wrong: I’m a fan of Joe Biden. But why is every issue that touches @BernieSanders one that “could knock him out of the race”? According to an @MSNBC panelist with @HallieJackson, that’s the case with charges of unequal treatment of women in his 2016 campaign.

I'm so sorry, Diane. We, the world, will miss Sandra of @unsuicide.
@MayaBellaTS @SethMacFarlane Agreed. ❤️
@MayaBellaTS @SethMacFarlane Hi ❤️! How would K's remaining calm perpetuate a negative male role? I think what Seth is saying is that we expect Supreme Court justices to be even-keeled-that's what Kavanaugh said he'd be if confirmed. But people needed to see that side of him, not the belligerent side.
@pottercassidy @bridget_joy_ Every one of them -- Dems and republicans -- cast their votes based on the votes they know they'll have. They all know the whip count, which is done in the background. She voted no on cloture because she could afford to. She has it both ways that way - credit from women and GOP.
@Flutterflash @bridget_joy_ @ReginaN61540989 No, it wouldn't have changed anything, and that's why she withdrew her no vote. She had the proxy to vote yes for another republican, so once all the votes were cast (including her no vote), she cast his yes and withdrew hers, saying doing so would not change the outcome.
@barbls23 @bridget_joy_ She didn't abstain. She voted no, and then when it appeared Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed based on the vote she had been allowed to proxy in, she withdrew her vote. It was a cowardly move. If it were on principle, she would have stood on her no.
RT @RBReich: This election isn't a contest between Democrats or Republicans. It’s a contest between the bullies and the bullied. It’s about…
You know they didn't release reams and reams of Kavanaugh's records. And you know that Kavanaugh lied -- yes, that's PERJURY, a FELONY -- during his confirmation hearings, both recently and for the DC Circuit. Americans aren't stupid. You hear and you ignore us. And we see you.
.@SenAlexander You have some nerve. The only way you can say this is if you are willing to completely discount what Dr. Blasey said, which means you are a misogynist. You know full well that the Republicans didn't order a full FBI investigation. https://t.co/A3VqijMlyQ
In a month, we have the chance to immunize and perhaps cure our country of this disease. One vote is all it takes. Do not underestimate, Democrats, how vitally important your vote is this November. The life of our democracy hangs in the balance.
Ours is a government in need of rescuing. It is in denial about the death of our planet and denies health care for its inhabitants. It criminalizes victims and asylum seekers, and victimizes predators and bigots. And it demonizes entire populations, rendering them irrelevant.
And where a right-wing publication like the WSJ finds funny a headline that used the word "consent" because it involved a female sitting senator who voted to confirm this nominee for the United States Supreme Court who was credibly accused of sexual assault.
This is the toxic environment of Trump, where sexual assault is no longer criminal, but a joke. Where a sitting conservative senator like @LindseyGrahamSC thinks nothing of suggesting the "role" of a woman in a sexual assault allegation is that of a "slut whore drunk."
But wouldn't a publication like the @WSJ have to be tone deaf to use such a headline for an op-ed published on the heels of a confirmation process centered on multiple allegations of sexual assault against the nominee? Actually, I would go so far as to say it was intentional.
Someone please help me understand the thinking of the @WSJopinion in using the Headline "Susan Collins Consents." Does the section editor have a brain tumor? Was there a typographical error? The excuse, no doubt, will rely on the Senate's role of advice and "consent." I call BS.
As the OP video shows, there is no aspect of YOUR LIFE that is unaffected by the people elected to the offices being filled this November and every other election. Not one. Don't let other people DECIDE WHO DECIDES how your life will be affected! Use YOUR voice! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!
And OF COURSE, please be active in #GOTV (#GetOutTheVote) initiatives in your community. But PLEASE: Once all of these activities are over and Election Day arrives, don't make the MISTAKE of thinking I'VE DONE ALL OF THE WORK -- LET EVERYONE ELSE VOTE! https://t.co/pxdyeeEaEU

@TheLeadCNN How patronizing.
Doesn't bode well. Why else go through his judicial record if she's going to vote against him because of Dr. Blasey's credible charges against him. She's already covered how awful HE'S been treated on social media (as if Dr. Blasey hasn't been called a liar since last Thurs.) https://t.co/QDglXywiXw
So is this a complaint? You said in your remarks that wasn't enough to keep you from voting "yes," much to the horror of Democrats everywhere. So what's up with that? https://t.co/VIeFjRFusK
Kavanaugh shouldn't be allowed to write an apology letter like a scolded child &amp; be rewarded for doing so. If you vote him onto the Court, that's the message you'll send: that if your upbringing was privileged, you get whatever you want--even if you assault women &amp; abuse alcohol.
Also, @senatorcollins, he's up for a lifetime promotion. Do you want to be the one woman who gambles the health and lives of women for the next 40 years for this person whose demeanor is unfit for the Court, who is now trying to reverse your impression via his WSJ op-ed? https://t.co/bJHLcrtmZ3
.@senatorcollins Please remember women. Please forget politics. Remember What makes Christine Blasey Ford credible. https://t.co/bgiwlPOhrK
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 I return the same hopes for you. Namaste
What an outlandish claim! The FBI report is incomplete because the FBI was made into a joke by not being allowed to search for evidence corroborating the credible claims of Dr. Blasey. So no, the Democrats wouldn't be satisfied until a full and fair investigation were done. https://t.co/bCgIqPeowS
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 Indeed they are. And that very hope for me is the reason they are. You are a good egg. 🥰
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 I find the meaning. This convo has actually been more meaningful to me than you know. If you could see the tears in my eyes, you'd know. ❤️
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 My ego is my worst feature. https://t.co/eqanZb55yT
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 I think you might be right. I hope this is clear: I sense good in you. I hope you sense good in me. Today, in your honor, I'm going to try to refrain from being a jerk to another person when I feel the urge to do so. I actually do prefer being kind as much as receiving kindness.
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 And FWIW, I truly appreciate your willingness to continue this conversation, despite some miscommunications. There's something to be said for a person who strives more for clarity than victory.
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 What you read as condescending was weariness. It was the third/fourth time I'd heard the message that my comments weren't being received for what they were: supportive &amp; desirous of a friendly, agreeable exchange. I heard rejection of my attempt at humility, of my friendship.
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 And I predict now there will be something stupid and wrong about that honest answer, too, but again, I can take it. Tiredly.
@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 Yep. Because the only time you “saw a spark” was when I told you I’m an ally (I am), but you reminded me how you trapped me, and then I congratulated you for trapping me, and you said I missed the point, and I asked if teaching was the point, and you dismissed me. 🤷🏼‍♀️

@MayaBellaTS @gogreen18 Best wishes, and congratulations on snagging an ally. I’m suitably humbled, if that’s what you need to hear. But you take enough shit irl without getting more from me. So keep rubbing your victory in my face if you need to. I can take it.

Furthermore, I see no reason to engage a person whose only motive is to pick a fight, except maybe to engage in a fight on a different topic just to frustrate him. That’s fun.
@StrikklyRealDea @romyreiner Why yes, I did. Do you think my outrage over sexual assault is partisan, for God’s sake? I’m a human being first, an American second, and several other meaningful things before you get to Independent, and NOT so much a Democrat. What a warped question!

At the end of the day, once Republicans have sold yet another lie to the American public, what Brett Kavanaugh will have is a lifetime promotion, not a prison sentence.		And you will have sold your soul, yet again; this time, to Satan himself.
But we’re smart enough to know that despite all this “innocent/guilty” language, those aren’t the choices before you senators. What your shady, underhanded leadership has really presented is “PROMOTED UNTIL PROVEN PASSED OVER,” all dressed up in black-and-white prison stripes.
The difference with us and with most JOB INTERVIEWS is that most people would never get a call-back if there was even a rumor of wrongdoing, let alone an accusation of a crime. That’s part of what you Republicans seem to think Tennesseans are too stupid to figure out.

@DerekC2016 I read the “findings” of the biased “prosecutor” who framed everything as a criminal case. It ISN’T.
@DogginTrump @wclint It could be read as he will be unavailable because he’ll be otherwise engaged, as in serving on the #SCOTUS, as in, the fix is in.
@DerekC2016 Wonder all you want, sunshine. Your opinion of me matters less than what’s stuck to the bottom of my shoe. You’re a typical victim-blaming, misogynist Trumper who points fingers @ others when he can’t answer for facts presented. Ford is a hero &amp; Bouf is a lying, whiny mama’s boy.
@DerekC2016 Already responded
@DerekC2016 There is no “case.” There is a recommendation by an unindicted co-conspirator of an amoral, drunken liar for a prestigious job, and then an interview by the nominator’s yes-men who are complicit in turning a blind eye to several criminal accusations against the nominee.
@DerekC2016 You can say what you like, &amp; your saying it emphatically doesn’t make it true. I have come to a different conclusion. Ford is credible. Bouf Kav is too partisan, unstable, &amp; morally bankrupt. He’s a liar who is unfit for the high court. His nom is about protecting 45, period.
RT @acslaw: Text messages suggest Kavanaugh wanted to refute accuser's claim before it became public https://t.co/am0P6hEV6M via @nbcnews
@DerekC2016 Just imagine asking for a job anywhere in America—hell, the world—and handing an interviewer that document with your resume. No job, not even @ McD’s. Your privileged judge thinks he’s entitled to a ticket onto the #SCOTUS because he’s ticked the right boxes. The report=a joke.

How would she even judge it? She didn’t question the accused; the Republicans spent their time singing his praises, and he lied on all of the relevant questions asked by Democrats. https://t.co/Yw7m1sRE2R
October is also DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH. How fitting, since the Republicans are working so hard to seat a violent drunk on the SCOTUS. https://t.co/nh9bfUCCHS
@senatemajldr I predicted that you’d claim that, too, because Republicans would limit the scope of the investigation so it wouldn’t be full/fair. Limit witnesses, topics, range, so long as the POE favors Kav, &amp; the GOP frat will have seated its sex-offender drunken frat brother. #GammaOmegaPhi

Powerful men are the most dangerous of men for women to engage with. They can mobilize groups of other powerful people to silence and discredit her; shut down those who would help her; and alter the appearance of her claims w/o recourse, all as seen w/Dr. Blasey. Avoid them. https://t.co/fy8f0OeMLM

@SenAlexander That you could've watched today's hearing (DID you even watch it?) and come away thinking this man is the best person for the job is striking and telling. You've not done your duty; you've pissed away the constitutional responsibility you swore to uphold. You are as unfit as he.
@SenAlexander If you had any concern for future victims of SA, you'd've been able to see that Kavanaugh's emotional reaction to the allegations against him will create bias against parties before him &amp; in his rulings if he is confirmed to sit on the Court. He is unfit, incapable of neutrality.
@SenAlexander If you'd spent any time researching victims and perpetrators of sexual assault (SA), you would know that a very small percentage of victims report being attacked soon after the incident; that perpetrators commit their crimes over a long period of time and know how to hide them.
@SenAlexander Your constituents don't appreciate, but are not surprised by, the lack of an opportunity to give their opinions to you on how they'd prefer you vote on this nominee. Your comments demonstrate your complete lack of knowledge, and total disregard for, victims of sexual assault.

This testimony is a string of excuses. “I liked beer, but I never got that drunk.” “I had friends who were girls, but I never sexually assaulted anyone.” And Lordy, the TEARS. He’ll lose Trump for that alone: “I like #SCOTUS nominees who don’t cry.” #KavanaughHearings
Why is he crying so much? Dr. Ford didn’t even cry this much. THIS IS WEIRD. #KavanaughHearings
Sorry, mate, the rapey party was a spur-of-the-moment thing. You wouldn’t have it on your calendar. Your diary isn’t dispositive. #KavanaughHearings
It is outrageous that #Kavanaugh says that because no one came forward against him (a white male, privileged member of a dominant majority class in America) alleging sexual assault during his life, it must be because it didn’t happen. NO. It’s bec. women still aren’t believed
Only in America could a privileged white man sit in outraged judgment of the very @senjudiciary committee that would normally advise &amp; consent on his nomination, to lecture its members &amp; browbeat them into giving him the hallowed lifetime SCOTUS seat he seems to feel entitled to

@uvmer Yes. It's remarkable. More so in view of the fact that she is being treated by the @SenateGOP on the @senjudiciary committee as an accused, not as a victim. Still, nevertheless, she persists. They try to paint her as non-credible. #NeverthelessShePersists #KavanaughHearings
Mitchell is a horrible questioner. She should specify what she means by "when this took place."  #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford doesn't say that the @senjudiciary's failure of a full and fair hearing was personally hurtful to her; rather, she frames it as disappointing that *she* couldn't have been more helpful.  #KavanaughHearings
The @senjudiciary"s prosecutor has now entered into prosecutor mode. She just tried to get Dr. Blasey Ford to admit to someone else paying for the polygraph she took. Now she's badgering her about someone talking "at her behest." Stop using vague language! #KavanaughHearings

Apples and oranges. @SenFeinstein said it should be the FBI doing the investigation, not the Senate. https://t.co/bZicKAhRQL
@JohnRBowling I have drawn you as clear a picture as I possibly can, and you refuse to look at it. Time to scrape your particular brand of bullshit off my shoe.
@JohnRBowling If someone has been questioned about several Xs about which she *has* spoken with her lawyer, and the questioner starts getting close to other topics about which she conceivably *could* have spoken with her lawyer, then her lawyer might remind the questioner to mind her Ps &amp; Qs.
@JohnRBowling https://t.co/652DoV8IAw
@JohnRBowling Let me dumb it down for you: Your 5-year-old loves cookies; it's dinnertime. You see him looking at the cookie jar on the counter. He walks closer. You tell him, "You can't have any cookies before dinner, it'll spoil your appetite. He didn't open the jar, so why mention it?
@JohnRBowling Listen, pal: I understand the privilege between a lawyer and client. I am a lawyer. I went to law school. I graduated and passed the bar in three states. I practiced and taught law. If you're not a lawyer, maybe you don't understand what I'm saying; that doesn't mean I don't.
@JohnRBowling *toe
@JohnRBowling I’ve missed nothing. We lawyers know what other lawyers are thinking, what they should know, and when they’re trying to get away with something. I knew it sitting hundreds of miles away. He did right to remind Mitchell to tie the line.
Because Mitchell isn't respecting the privilege like she should, and she knows better. Dr. Blasey Ford's lawyer knows Mitchell knows better. Dr. Blasey's Ford's lawyer needed to send the message, "I'm watching you. Knock it off." https://t.co/JuJAikqT8D
Exactly. And this was about the polygraph. The @SenateGOP would give their own limbs if she would respond like that to the attempted rape. https://t.co/Rgaas18cCm
@Diane_7A There are many people who might be capable of a thing like that, but this is not the witness.
@mmpadellan He's right.
The president's "failure to ask [for Mark Judge's] testimony is tantamount to a coverup." @SenBlumenthal AGREED #KavanaughHearings
My experienced take: Mitchell's tone has now changed from rapport-building to prosecutor (with Dr. Blasey Ford as suspect, not victim). Notice the hardened edge of her voice, shortened questioning, quicker (rushed) pace. We're now seeing Mitchell's role. #KavanaughHearings
"Boys will be boys...is far too low a standard." @ChrisCoons #KavanaughHearings
@debjjdh Sure, this is all new to me because being licensed to practice law in 3 states, passing 3 bar exams and teaching @ an ABA-accredited law school was inadequate to prepare me to understand sworn testimony about a piddly topic like FEAR of flying (not inability to fly).

And now the investigator is attacking her veracity. ABOUT HER FEAR OF FLYING. Jesus. This is desperate. #KavanaughHearings
Soon, Ms. Investigator is going to ask about whether Dr. Blasey Ford has taken any drugs for anxiety  #KavanaughHearings
Here we go: Ms. Investigator is now trying to dilute the effect of the sexual assault on Dr. Blasey Ford's anxiety and trauma.  #KavanaughHearings
Read your list all you want, @ChuckGrassley. @SenWhitehouse was talking about one thing and one thing only. An FBI investigation. @realDonaldTrump could have ordered it; the majority of the @senjudiciary could have requested Trump do so; they didn't. #KavanaughHearings
"I feel like I could be more helpful if" there were an FBI investigation. Not "I think we could nail him"; not "I know someone will corroborate my story"; but "I feel like I could be more helpful." Doesn't the @senjudiciary committee want the truth? No. #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Blasey Ford is so credible, so uncalculating, so innocently helpful, so believable, there is no way to paint her as political or manipulative. Anyone in this country with an ounce of empathy is cheering for her today. #KavanaughHearings
She was able to narrow down the dates because until now, she'd been suppressing the trauma as much as possible; now, though, she's concerned for her country, and she's thrust herself into the spotlight against her better judgment for the good of the country.  #KavanaughHearings
Where are you going with this map business, Ms. Investigator?  #KavanaughHearings
How sure was she that it was Brett Kavanaugh? 10%? 20%? 40% No, she is 100% CERTAIN that it was Brett Kavanaugh who flopped his inebriated, doughy carcass onto her and tried to rape her, nearly suffocating her. 100% #KavanaughHearings
Thanks, @DickDurbin, for asking Dr .Blasey Ford about the two FAKE "anonymous" men who claim -- incredibly -- that it could have been them who assaulted her. Who volunteers for that gig? "Hey, I could've been the guy who tried  to rape her!" #Bullshit #KavanaughHearings
Hundreds and thousands of letters have been entered into the record of this hearing in support of Dr. Blasey Ford. Her courage and selflessness is awe-inspiring. Thank you, Dr. Blasey Ford. #KavanaughHearings
So far, I'm pretty happy with the investigator. If the republicans are trying to pull crap in using her, it's not apparent to me yet. I don't put it past them. #IllBeWatching #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford: "I'm used to being collegial." God love her.		 #KavanaughHearings
"Indelible in the hippocampus was the laughter -- the laughter at my expense." Dr. Ford, in tears	These boys were MONSTERS. #KavanaughHearings
@Malangas Blah blah blah
Dr. Ford says she ultimately came forward because of reporters, calls to her colleagues, visitors to her home, etc. This after her earlier concern that coming forward might just be "jumping in front of a speeding train that was headed to a destination anyway." #KavanaughHearings
"I knew him and he knew me." How in the name of all things holy does this man's nomination go any further after this hearing? I can't wait to see Kavanaugh"s body language and hear his denials after hearing her detailed allegations. #KavanaughHearings
"Talking about it caused me to relive the trauma." Dr. Ford 	#KavanaughHearings
"Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. . . . I convinced myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should just move on and get on with my life." Dr. Ford  #GodHelpUs #KavanaughHearings
"The details of that night have been seared in my memory and have haunted me episodically throughout my adult life." #KavanaughHearings
"I am not here because I want to be; I am terrified. I am here because I believe my civic duty" requires it. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford  #KavanaughHearings
"We are here for one reason: to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh should be elevated" to one of the most powerful positions in the country. "Is he the best we can do?" @SenFeinstein #KavanaughHearings
More and more people have come forward challenging Kavanaugh's characterizations of his focus on sports, studies, studies, and church. Fellow classmates have told of his being "incoherently drunk." @SenFeinstein #KavanaughHearings
Republican leadership have told members they should be prepared to be in over the weekend to be ready to vote on Monday, despite that additional victims have come forward:  @SenFeinstein #KavanaughHearings
"Republicans have refused to call anyone who could speak to the evidence..." @SenFeinstein #KavanaughHearings
Do we blame Dr. Ford for not wanting to make her story public, given the way #AnitaHill was treated by this same committee and even some of its same members? Will we see anything different today? I doubt it. #StandStrongDrFord #KavanaughHearings
@Cynthia__Duke @ChuckGrassley Exactly. How dare she challenge a man. As if her humanity is lesser than his.
Thank you, @SenFeinstein, for making sure Dr. Ford's letter is labeled "confidential," not the nefarious "secret," as the nasty @ChuckGrassley spat in his remarks. #KavanaughHearings

@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons And in case it isn’t clear, I’m agreeing with you here, despite my scary “agenda.” 😉
@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons If the Dems wanted to be consistent w/their position in forcing Al Franken to resign, they *would* require Ellison to forfeit his office with the DNC. He has accusations from at least two women over ten years, but denies all, same as Kavanaugh. They should treat him the same.
@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Why don’t I just pretend your last sentence isn’t there. We were doing so well. 		Actually, I had forgotten about the bone the DNC threw Ellison with his “chair” position. That does change things.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons And you’re here to insult. When I say get lost, you pest, it means I’m in the process of blocking you. I’m not so insecure as need to to keep engaging you, like you seem to be here. So, get lost, you pest.
@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons For one, Ellison’s accuser would only have criminal justice system recourse. Kavanaugh’s accusers have chosen to speak out at this point to weigh in at his nomination. The various states could still (possibly) bring criminal charges against him on their charges.
@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons The fed-level Dems wouldn’t talk about that. Even state Dems would let the process play out. If he was convicted, there could be consequences, but it would be up to the voters in a state office like AG. Nothing about Ellison’s accusation is relevant to Kavanaugh.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons My feelings are so hurt by you, Mr. Some Guy I’ll Never Meet. Whatever will I do?
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Thought you were leaving. Twice. Indecisive much?
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons This is why I’m the lawyer and you’re not.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Ta-ta, girlfriend. https://t.co/TLJ0Juei6E
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons People with facts are not judgmental. Judgmental is saying, for example, “That rape victim isn’t credible because her word isn’t good enough, and certainly isn’t as valuable as this white man’s.” That’s judgmental.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons As a lawyer, of course I believe people deserve the same rights under law (interesting how you make such convenient assumptions to fit your hateful narrative). And there is credible evidence. If you think there isn’t, you don’t understand evidence.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons You aren’t even abiding by what you claim to believe. “All should be afforded the same rights...under the law” means following the law—and that’s what I’ve outlined to you. But your fingers are in your ears as you sing la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Yes, I see. End a discussion when the facts go against you. Yet another tactic typical of “people like you,” to borrow your phrase.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons The FBI also can’t investigate here, unless Trump tells them to bec. their background check is closed. And “people like” me have absolutely no bearing on the kind of due process Kavanaugh receives. I’m not calling the shots, nor are the Dems in the minority.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Again w/the insults. It’s not the same: 1. You want only  Dems to be punished for sex crimes, but I prefer all who commit them to pay; 2. Kavanaugh has been nominated &amp; must be confirmed by the senate, whereas the people will elect the MN AG; 3. You will lose the DP argument.
@tamarockabama @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons This question is baffling. Yes, if he committed the crime, and the MN STATE law enforcement authorities believe they have enough to prosecute him, they should do so. Ellison’s job isn’t relevant here, except to add that AGs are not nominated and confirmed by the state legislature
@RonT96523711 @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Yes, and as such, it is up to the state law enforcement authorities to charge Ellison with a crime. The senate isn’t a law enforcement body.
@antongassiott @JoelGoldstein17 @FoxNews @ChrisCoons What a shock. Another republican asking a facially neutral question for no purpose other than to set up an insult. It happens so often that you’re becoming associated with the ploy. 		If Ellison committed a crime, it is up to local authorities to charge him. Not the Senate.
Is it just me, or does @Twitter or @TwitterSafety need to clean house again? There are more shadow accounts with numerical endings and no original tweets that have opened just this year. Most are politically stupid.

@jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley See, I was responding to a tweet, not a thread, sunshine. It’s a thing one can do. Like now, for example.
@StirringSoup1 @SheilaFrench20 @jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Yuck! Hillary!
@jeffersonianguy Now, if you think I’m condescending simply because I can articulate my point clearly and concisely, that’s your issue. Fact.
@jeffersonianguy Yes, I get it. But you are attempting to “thoughtfully engage” about something *I said* when your interpretation of what I said is DEAD WRONG, but you won’t hear that. Having established that you won’t hear me, I owe you nothing.

@RuthAbbitt @jeffswarens @SheilaFrench20 @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Why would she give any of that ahead of the hearing when the Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans have proven without a doubt that they will manipulate the process and tamper with the hearing as much as possible?

@jeffersonianguy The [Insult-“Have a nice night”-Insult] trick was surely drafted by the Russian bot factory. It is rampant in Trumper tweets.

Your sick logic becomes clear and you show your true colors when you say things like that. As I’ve said, men or women who assault — women or men — should be punished. 		You won’t push my buttons, but you are wasting my time. I’ll be blocking you soon.
@StirringSoup1 @SheilaFrench20 @jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley No one knows whom you’re talking to, as there are 7 in this convo. 		All women who allege sexual assault should be believed, regardless of political party, and should get justice. Even if the perp was Bill Clinton. Or Trump (who has admitted to it, BTW).		Now what?
@WildVioletUSA @SheilaFrench20 @jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Oh, and IDGAF what I show you because you don’t mean anything to me.
@WildVioletUSA @SheilaFrench20 @jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Your statement shows your ignorance of how sexist language like “be manly” excuses sexual assault.
@jeffswarens @SheilaFrench20 @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley How do you know Ford lies?
@jeffersonianguy Your response is what is ignorant. I would explain why, but you’re here no argue, not listen or learn. Anyone familiar with sexist language knows I’m right.
@jeffswarens @minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley I think Republicans like you are dicks and misogynists and don’t hesitate to assault women. I never mentioned Ford.

@IndiespensableT @senjudiciary @NFL @OhioState @CBS If this is a true “investigation” into a sexual assault charge, stop w/the charade of giving the victim a rushed one-day-only “hearing.” Allow corroborating fact witnesses. Allow an “investigation” into the crime (not victim) &amp; investigator chosen by the victim (not accused).
@minddr100 @senjudiciary @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Please don’t say “Be manly” to Republicans. That’s how we got into this mess.

@ChuckGrassley If this is a message to Kavanaugh, send a text or email. You’re on Twitter. This is public. Maybe it’s time to resign if you’re losing track of what you’re typing.
And if they pull off this perversion of Justice, and if the @GOP loses the majority after the midterms, #Impeachment ought to be the order of the day: Not just of the president, but of Kavanaugh and any member of Congress who was complicit in the Republican miscarriage of justice
They mean that they don’t care about due process, or the truth, or the rule of law. More particularly, they mean they don’t care if Kavanaugh did, in fact, rape Prof. Ford. All they care about is putting their pawn on the board who’ll rule for Trump in all Trump cases. #Impeach45

@MelanieHenshaw And I corrected myself long ago. Stop trashing strangers.
@krassenstein Don’t even use “Trump.” That’s how 45 imprints his brand on people’s brains. 		Talks about himself in the third person as “Trump” like a dufus.		It’s in Woodward’s book.
YES! Finally, someone says it! The midterms can accomplish a lot! 		That is, if liberals, blues, and progressives actually VOTE and don’t just pre-celebrate &amp; play GOTV games, but sleep in on that Tuesday in November.

@daveweigel Well good morning!!! Coffee?
@MelanieHenshaw Actually, my grief is none of your business; you’d be the last person capable of helping people—I wouldn’t even put you in charge of dogs in a cage. I’m trying (unsuccessfully) to get you to see the value of civility &amp; empathy over prejudging people you know nothing about.
@mitchlhammer @McildoonKatie @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Actually, the video of the dogs in the cage says nothing about the owner’s health, whether there was a caretaker, whether a friend had agreed to care for the dogs but didn’t, if the owner was hurt and taken out, etc. But it says lots about you that you like shitting on strangers.

@TravistyScott @beyondblue Excellent. Good luck. Here if you need to talk.
@MelanieHenshaw @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor I realize social media lets us release the ugliest sides of ourselves, seemingly without consequences, but judging others when you don’t know their circumstances is just black-hearted. None of us escapes tragedy in life. Let’s hope yours doesn’t make you eat your bitter words.
@MelanieHenshaw @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor You’d still trash her? You’d still berate a woman who had, for months, been trying til she was exhausted to save hubby’s life, to load &amp; unload him into a wheelchair, all the while knowing she’d never grow old with him, for doing her best with 4 dogs? That’s not excuse enough?
@MelanieHenshaw @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Say he was a she, &amp; the dogs were her husband’s, whose health had declined so rapidly bc of brain cancer that he couldn’t walk &amp; didn’t understand his limits, so she couldn’t leave him alone. Like my late husband. She asked a friend to take the dogs, but they couldn’t get there.

@JustinandTaunya @LN_Master_Hub @LuciHoneychurch @OgozalekAnthony @maringirl1 @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor This dude REALLY wants proof.
@MelanieHenshaw @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor I was mistaken about him dying. That was a different man a few counties over. So I guess it’s okay for us to go ahead and trash this guy without knowing anything else about his circumstances.
@LN_Master_Hub @LuciHoneychurch @OgozalekAnthony @maringirl1 @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Many are saying the man who died was not the one who owned the dogs in the video. Now, I can’t offer you PROOF that the person in the video didn’t die, but somehow, I don’t think that’ll be quite as important to you. You writing a paper or something?
@vicki071952 @getrealtheatre @marcusdipaola I had it wrong—another man died checking on dogs, but not the one who owned the dogs in the video. ♥️
@JustinandTaunya @McildoonKatie @mitchlhammer @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Agreed. Thanks for the correction!
@LuciHoneychurch @LN_Master_Hub @OgozalekAnthony @maringirl1 @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor I don’t need proof, friend. I believe you. Thanks for the info.

@mitchlhammer @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor You did teach me something, Mitch. I learned that you aren’t capable of civility in human interaction; that you’re so miserable and your character so malleable that you’ve easily given yourself over to society’s recent inclination toward maleficence.
@McildoonKatie @maringirl1 @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Apparently that was a different man to the owner of the six dogs rescued from the cage in the video. I know, because I have a bunch of aggressive and hate-filled replies to my tweets. Because, you know, that’s how we treat each other these days. 🙄
@2happyPat Thank you for being kind in setting me straight. I appreciate it more than you know. Many have stopped just short of telling me they wished I had been in the cage and drowned myself, just for being mistaken. Nice people rock!
@daleterry14 @getrealtheatre @marcusdipaola Actually, Mr. Dogface LOL, I was mistaken in my haste to try and stop dozens of people from undeservedly speaking ill of a dead man for trying to do exactly what they were judging him for not doing. Some people gave me correct info with kindness, like a human.
@LeighPaige3 @FakingDancy @je402 @getrealtheatre @marcusdipaola Agreed. And it’s true that there was plenty of advance notice. Mainly, I felt bad that dozens were trashing a man for neglecting animals if he actually died to check on them, and I was trying to stem the tide of needless nasty remarks against a honorable dead man! 🤷🏼‍♀️
@ali_lacy @OgozalekAnthony @LeaKThompson @marcusdipaola @LauraLeeActor Thank you for taking the time to correct my error with kindness and respect. I miss the days when you could make an honest mistake and trust that you wouldn’t be attacked for it! You made my day!

@moss11_carl @llholcomb @senjudiciary So everybody who walks into a cop shop to complain about a crime should just be sent packing with “Nah, we don’t know there was a crime”? There would never be a criminal conviction. Typical misogynist rhetoric. A victim says he attempted to rape her. I believe her. So should you.
@carterbrianl @SenAlexander Word.
@moss11_carl @llholcomb @senjudiciary So as someone who knows fuck-all about victims of sexual violence, you can sit down and shut up about how this woman “should” behave just to serve your partisan beliefs. She’s a human being who was victimized. As an American, I don’t want a guy who might’ve done it on the SCOTUS.
@moss11_carl @llholcomb @senjudiciary As a victim advocate, I can attest to how difficult it is to come forward when one has been victimized, esp. when very young and outnumbered w/no witnesses other than perps. It’s easier to report now that she’s older, and this monster stands to affect American lives for decades.
@jc5502 @senjudiciary The @GOP thought women would be too stupid to figure out that Kavanaugh being nice to 65 doesn’t mean he didn’t try to rape one, and that they knew about this accusation, so they had this weak “defense” ready. This is misogyny at its ugliest.

I wouldn’t normally have thought to “invite” people to my funeral. Hell, I’m the kind of person who can’t even get invited to help other people move, let alone expect anyone to come to my funeral. But it sure would be fun to tell 45 he isn’t invited.
Where is the line drawn for the people who get to “invite” others to their funerals vs. people who have any old Joe Schmo come by to “pay their respects”? I mean, is it cool for me to go ahead and notify Trump now that he isn’t invited to mine in case he dies first or nah?
@Shorthandz @realmissbeeswax @MinceyDraws @marcandreyko @michaelianblack No, that’s loss of PRIVILEGE, and lots of it. Not punishment. Shove him in JAIL without the comfort of his privileges and we’ll talk.

@HeartSmithy @LeahMcSweeney @michaelianblack Exactly! And I wonder if he jacked off a little closer to her face, is it sexual assault then? What if she was stood in a corner, boxed in by chairs? Or does Leah think the woman needs to bleed before it’s sex assault? Geez, who needs enemies?

@TrygveHammer @davidsirota See, that was part of the problem. Your original reply wasn't clear. It isn't the "reflexive defensiveness" that's the problem here, at least not 100%. The way I read your tweet was that we Bernie people, in your view, ought to be the next to be called out as a piece of garbage.

@TrygveHammer @davidsirota Then you haven’t paid much attention to him OR you’re not that accurate a judge of character. But then, he’s only been working for ordinary people for what, 40-50 years?
@njh2005 That makes more sense. It explains why you would send me an 18-year-old document, as if laws and policies don’t change. I won’t bother reading your thing then. I’ll just rely on the precedent I’ve seen and the constitutional scholars I’ve heard analyze the issue. ✌️

@njh2005 I imagine so! Proposing the contrary policy to the head of the Executive branch would be a really stupid move. But there is SCOTUS legal precedent that holds to the contrary. Just because the DOJ policy hasn’t been tested doesn’t mean it’s a good policy.

@Viper19103 @Morecoldbeer @TCleveland4Real @Delavegalaw You risk confirmation of Kavanaugh, who adheres to the Unitary Executive Theory—that a sitting president cannot be indicted. If confirmed, he may round out a majority on that issue. You’ll have wasted time to indict, then fight Congress while the question is litigated.
@medit8now @Delavegalaw That court better not include Brett Kavanaugh because he believes no sitting president should be indicted, and some think he would have four other SCOTUS justices who would agree.

Despite all the talk of “unity,” Clinton Dems are like oil to Sanders dems’ water.
@ghewittofa @SenGillibrand @actblue She didn’t reply, but oddly enough, I’ve now received a personal attack by you.

@ghewittofa @SenGillibrand @actblue No, I don’t support what she’s doing (under-handedly recruiting people for her own mailing list by dishonestly implying that the signatures will go on “petitions” to be delivered.

@slsprojectz @BernieUpstateNY @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain Also not cool. Couldn’t this whole convo be possible without aggression, esp. in view of the fact that it was others’ bullying that was the original topic?
@BernieUpstateNY @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @slsprojectz @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain Yeah, that’s not cool.
@BernieUpstateNY @slsprojectz @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain Endless, endless phone calls and letter writing.
@BernieUpstateNY @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @slsprojectz @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain Sooooo...one word. And BAM! That’s my point. It’s not worth it. It’s what 45 wants. It’s not what anyone from your and my team would have wanted. I don’t know anymore what center-right Dems want, but who cares? I’m saying to you let’s stay Bernie-like. (That’s gonna bring heat).
@slsprojectz @BernieUpstateNY @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain I completely agree. And that’s a policy. But was this thread even about policy? If so, it was so long ago, my iPhone 5s won’t load it. If not, how did it come up?
@BernieUpstateNY @NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @slsprojectz @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain I don’t disagree. But unless I missed something, this thread was about something altogether different from policy. Like bullying. And family. I don’t get why we hide behind our general policy and passionate beliefs stalking twitter, waiting for a place to pounce on a pet issue.
@NicoleK8686 @RichardCaul @BernieUpstateNY @slsprojectz @RussiansSick @TrumpsDeadBrain Come on! Painting with a broad brush is insulting, no matter who’s doing it, or to whom. Couldn’t we at least recognize that we’re doing exactly what 45 wants us to do—turning on each other? We’re beyond “which flavor of left are we?” We’re at “can we still save the democracy?”

@halnewell @aldotcom Thanks for confirming my suspicions. Consider looking up “opinion” online. And remember: Saying the same thing over and over doesn’t make you right. Also: Look both ways before crossing the street and don’t go to bed with your hair wet. Nighty-night! 👶🚼
@fleshandbrand @BernieUpstateNY In other words, “Libs” are realizing Pence is a “Con.”
@halnewell @aldotcom My opinion doesn’t have to align with a physician’s oath, esp. when my opinion was about a doc going outside his job. Speaking of incompetence, nothing in your tweets and replies evidences any knowledge on your part of about physicians, so you have zero credibility, Sunshine.
@halnewell @aldotcom You could be right. I do understand my right to my own opinion.
@SenStabenow Good for you. STOP KAVENAUGH. NO TO KAVENAUGH. NO KAVENAUGH FOR SCOTUS #VOTENOONKAVENAUGH #KavenaughHasToGo Don’t bargain away women’s rights—don’t confirm KAVENAUGH!
@jsdokkan @aldotcom If the doc felt like he wanted to expose the guy, he should call the cops. Let the legal system work. We don’t live in a country where each person is a law unto themselves. I don’t get to just call your employer because you overreacted and insulted me and expect them to fire you.
@jsdokkan @aldotcom So because you disagree with me, you feel like it’s okay to insult me? I never said I’m in favor of the driver purposely crashing a bus load of kids and killing them. I said I’m against a doctor calling a patient’s employer and sharing his private medical history.
@halnewell @aldotcom Stop any doctor on the street and ask if it’s a doctor’s job to call a patient’s employer about the patient’s behavior, and 100 out of 100 will say no.
@jsdokkan @aldotcom Yep.
@aldotcom I hope he loses the lawsuit. This was not the doctor’s job. Stay in your damn lane, doc.

@skyemeadows323 @RhaseQuest @em26jamie @Josh_Moon What’s worse, communities that have historically been held back in all areas plus education continue to fall farther behind.

@skyemeadows323 @RhaseQuest @em26jamie @Josh_Moon You’re right. It’s maddening &amp; heartbreaking. For those families for whom money *is* an object—time is probably short too, &amp; stress is high, so time w/kids is not quality.

I don’t want Putin coming near. 	I don’t want him invited here. 	I don’t want Putin as our friend. 	I want this Putin thing to end. 	I don’t think Putin’s very nice. 	I think his blood runs cold as ice. 	Putin is our enemy. 	I want him far from you and me. https://t.co/rXzcsfrh4Z
As I keep suggesting to your colleagues, Sen. @MarkWarner, it would be more effective if you and your staff spent your time taking action on the things you tweet about instead of tweeting about them. The people would gladly accept a post-action update tweet. #DoYourJob https://t.co/QzXuDre7m4

And then Putin conducted the next portion of the meeting —wait for it — BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, WITHOUT THE MEDIA.
“The US has “pitiful, despicable people who look out for their own personal interests,” according to Putin, who told the diplomats that they all needed to keep that in mind “when dealing with Americans.”		Putin, speaking at the Russian Federation diplomatic meeting
“We’ll have to wait and see how events will unfold, especially considering how certain forces in the US want to play down the results of the Helsinki summit.”		 Vladimir Putin, speaking at the Russian Federation diplomatic meeting
“We have good prospects of working together with China.” PUTIN
Putin spoke today at the regular diplomatic meeting. He spoke of a “New World Order.”

If you don’t like how Hillary “lost,” go after the electoral college, not voters.
And call me a Russian bot if you wish, but more fool you: I’m merely taking a more thoughtful view of your same side. I think Trump was a terrible candidate, and anyone who researched him shouldn’t have voted for him.
Despite 45’s win, do you really want an America where voters aren’t free to cast (or not) their ballot for the candidate of their choice? If you open your mind just a crack, you’d see that it’s just a roll of the dice away from being your candidate next time who ruins America.
“If you didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton...you own this fuckery”? What an uninformed, histrionic and hysterical thing to say. Hillary won the popular vote.

@eleebeck MAAAAYbe they’re not quite as balls-to-the-wall FoxNewsish leftist partisan as you think. MAAAAYbe you’re being a bit too cynical about them. It could just be they want your take on something. You know, trying to get several viewpoints? Just trying to see what sticks 🤷🏼‍♀️
TRUMPERS: Where is your humanity that you support a man who allows this treatment of another human? Dare you suggest he or you are not racist if you are willing to let this happen? He’s a businessman, a job-creator, like Trump says he wants. What else but skin color is left? #sad https://t.co/hSN6crqd5C

@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus No, I’m not that worried about what you’ve done, honestly, but I do have concerns about people who publicly crap on others’ efforts WITHOUT a corresponding suggestion of s better/alternative action. That’s not constructive. It’s just petty.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I agree with this. Yes, Dems are wolves in sheeps’ clothing. There are two parties that are exactly the same. Yes. Still, Trump is dangerous. It’s not as simple as Dems are bad too, so screw them both. We have to multitask. Resist him (not via Dems) AND get progressives in.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus Are you a Trump supporter? Do you think he’s good for the country?
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus No, I didn’t take what you said personally; I just take personal responsibility of the words I write and speak. Care to join me? Expound.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus Nowhere have I told you what your opinion should be. That’s your game. I’m not sure who you think has arrived late or what that has to do with anything. If my 81-y/o mother woke up today and became active for the first time in her life, I’d welcome it &amp; be proud of her.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus Lots of assumptions here. Let’s see, in my 50’s now, been politically active for over 20 years. If my calculations are correct, that predates the Trump admin. Like to have a few seats yourself?
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus See, when you simply argue and criticize the things I say without responding in any substantive way to the points I try to make, it makes it seem like your only goal is to crap on what others try to do. And that’s not productive. And now you want to escape the convo. Why?
Help me understand your position here: What exactly do you mean when you say “The McResistance”? From context, I gather you mean something coming from the Dems, but what? Just their requests for donations to support something called “the resistance”? Because I can agree w/that. https://t.co/IgkLkJJjJe

@DaLeftHook @AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I can’t be worried about the evil of others. All I can do is give what I can in this moment. Anything else like the behavior of others is outside my control.
@DaLeftHook @AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus If others find fault, so be it. Maybe they have something to teach me ( unless they just want to make me feel stupid, in which case I feel safe thinking they probably have nothing to add).
@DaLeftHook @AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I don’t see any reason to, as part of that process, stop and analyze whether there’s anyone else who might be doing something substandard that I can shit on. I just try to help.
@DaLeftHook @AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus This doesn’t even make sense to me. I don’t operate by labels. “Leftists,” “Antifa,” “alt-right fascists?” Here’s my philosophy: I see something that’s wrong, hurts people, the earth, the environment, living beings, etc., I do what I think is within my power to help fix it.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus Your type of “activism” appears to be whining on Twitter” — at least that’s all I can gather, since you haven’t answered my direct question re: what exactly you do.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I didn’t give you an exhaustive list of what I’ve protested. I’m probably twice your age and have spoken up about everything you mentioned. But as long as you want to crap on the efforts of everyone else who’re on your side because their acts don’t match yours, we all lose. #ego
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus So Telmex, @AlexClaySays, what’s your activism?
@HwoodStreetKing Okay, Hollywood, what’ve you got Against resistors? Your page looks like all reality tv. I can’t wait to hear your beef with them.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus The problem is that you feel free to criticize a part of legitimate activism taken on by true patriots simply because you haven’t given it attention. Nothing I’ve done has been hashtag driven. You minimize — and therefore discourage — the efforts of other patriots. That’s unfair.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus These are not efforts at resistance that should be tossed into a pile as worthless or as “doing nothing” simply because they’re different from the actions you take. Net neutrality affects you. What action did you take?
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus There have been many more harmful policies threatened by the Trump Admin or Congress that my voice has helped express resistance to, some succeeded and some failed. Not everything is about future candidates. The DACA vs. govt. shutdown vote is real.
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I’ll personalize it to remove myself from your stereotype. As a resistor, I resist harmful policies threatened by Congress, like repeal of the ACA. Those actions were successful. I called my reps in Congress to resist the tax plan;  we failed, but to resist was important.
Rep. Womack, this is your constituent. It’s 2018. Not that it’s ever been okay to flat-out ignore a constituent like this at a public gathering for this purpose, it is particularly insidious, backward, and racist to target people of color to ignore. Shame! https://t.co/Q0Fp4lg4yO
And not just that, but you must prove yourself trustworthy. As for me, the DNC continues to prove itself tone deaf and untrustworthy, ungrateful for progressives’ contributions, unwilling to take input/learn from past mistakes. Such is not a party we want to waste more time with. https://t.co/XmSzJ5Y4lh
@AlexClaySays @honeybrown00 @ajplus I honestly don’t understand the subgroup that hates those who resist (even if we also promote progressive candidates) as if “resistors” do just the one thing and that thing is by definition wrong. Except it’s classic divide &amp; conquer. Can you help?

@GeoffMiami @funder You seem interested only in discrediting him, concluding by saying that donors could have “better spent” their dollars “in other ways to help fight back against a Trump administration,” like “sending money to candidates or grassroots organizations.”
@GeoffMiami @funder Likewise, you seem to have given no thought in your analysis to how Scott could have done things more effectively.
@GeoffMiami @funder I get it — you’re Progressive. I am too. But the absence in your piece of valid reasons for Scott not to set up a Super PAC and a consulting firm to make money while encouraging resistance makes your article smack of inexplicable sour grapes.

@2018LookOut @JoyAnnReid I’ll tell you what I’d like: that’s for somebody, preferably Democrats and Progressives, to lift the tone and rhetoric out of the zone of insults and hatred. No human beings are trash. Don’t we stand for that when we demand renewal of DACA?
@Tips_Of_Love @JoyAnnReid No, by all means, care all you want. But to say that investigating her pushes us closer to a banana republic is a smidge ridiculous. Say it’s redundant. Say it’s unfounded and unfair. But to criticize the *country* because the FBI is looking at her is hyperbolic and laughable.
@2018LookOut @JoyAnnReid And the DNC is broke. Who wouldn’t want her over 45? Quite a few, actually, but she still “won” (but for the antiquated EC). Still, I’m saying there’s an unwillingness to question her by those who supported her (much like 45 fans). There is a LOT to question about the foundation.
@TheRickWilson Shut up! That was great! https://t.co/Awei1oDO2b
@2018LookOut @JoyAnnReid Yes, it’s true. All the way back to good ol’ Bill! The Clintons have driven the GOP crazy for decades. But this addiction to Hillary since 2016 is leeching life from Democrats. It’s heartbreaking to watch them give up so many voters just for her sake.
@JoyAnnReid Which is one of the cancers on the Democratic Party. You are in a cult that supports Hillary as irrationally as Trump supporters follow him. You have no ability to be objective where she is concerned. And that—along with a stranglehold on corporate donations—will kill the DNC.
@JoyAnnReid I hope your referral to the US as a “banana republic” is because of her organization’s too-close ties to government, but I doubt it. If I had to guess, your lament is that the “police power” has become “unchecked” now that it dares touch your beloved Hillary.
@JoyAnnReid Because the FBI is investigating Hillary? As if it’s impossible that she committed a crime? As if suddenly this organization that’s nonpartisan and professional, that does its job despite DC’s political divides, now has devolved into a hit mob because the target is Hillary? BS.
And herein lies one of the legacies that will forever follow this administration into the annals of history (assuming anything of history remains or anyone lives to know of it, once 45 ensures total world destruction). https://t.co/KFq80EZ1WZ

@CJaie @WesleyLowery @JamilSmith I kind of have 2 just go by how I would feel plus my observations, &amp; it feels like the whites so habitually demean, ignore, discriminate, you name it, the African Americans (in Mgm at least), that why wouldn’t they meet them with resentment &amp; mistrust?
Hearty congratulations to @GDouglasJones for a hard-fought race and a well-deserved win! Thank you, approximately 50% of Alabama voters who voted for the right candidate, no matter your party affiliation. You’re true conscientious patriots! It’s a proud day for Alabama! 🇺🇸
@CJaie @WesleyLowery @JamilSmith I’m not sure I get that. Because they’re disaffected? Do you believe that?

I’m not sure which polling place she was referring to—the busy road she mentioned runs for miles—so it’s possible there wasn’t enough close parking except on the highway. Somehow I doubt the callout, if I’m honest. To park on that hwy would be a death wish.

@trypeacenow66 @AskLifeY @SwearengenMaude @krassenstein I’m horrified to say it, but the Dem Party just isn’t strong enough in AL yet to pull off a straightforward win for Jones, and far too many Republicans are too party-loyal to cross lines to vote Jones.
@trypeacenow66 @AskLifeY @SwearengenMaude @krassenstein I’ll say this:  If Jones wins, and I hope he does, it won’t be because decency prevailed. It’ll be because Roy Moore passed the tipping point of being an AL GOP liability with these pedo allegations going public nationally. Decency lost when DJT became president.
@trypeacenow66 @SwearengenMaude @AskLifeY @krassenstein Woot. Exactly. And it’s never as cut-and-dried as “exit polls” (never seen them) or some GOP bureaucrat’s voter count. Alabama is rigged, and rigged very specifically. Deeply, thicker-than-blood rigged. If you haven’t lived in Alabama, don’t argue Alabama politics.

I spent all day essentially doing this with one person who was so stupid, I finally had to explain what I was doing. “SEE, YOURE WASTING MY TIME, SO IM PLAYING YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?” 🙄 https://t.co/L0ICxSm6MZ
@Bouje99 @FF_Hokie @tMKing1 @TheRoot And what he wrote was his. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I, too, think that attributing the poor choice of one candidate’s campaign committee to the failure of the entire party is OTT. But we all get to make fools of ourselves in the press. 😉
@Bouje99 @FF_Hokie @tMKing1 @TheRoot See, this makes no sense. Why shouldn’t the person write an article? I’m glad he’s free to do it. Wouldn’t the alternative be worse, if somehow people in the US were forbidden from expressing a critical opinion of a candidate? That sounds like a dictatorship. #freedom
@EfanaticAnn @FF_Hokie @TheRoot This isn’t an argument, Sunshine. I just described what I saw. A person can find it offensive (I do) and still hope he wins (I do). This era of people getting super defensive and screaming at people with an opinion is terribly destructive.
@JackPosobiec @zachhaller That’s a skewed interpretation. What he said was there’s irony in his  resignation based on (some accurate, some inaccurate) allegations of his inappropriate behavior, while IN THE WHITE HOUSE sits a man who admitted on tape repeatedly sexually assaulting women. That’s different.

@SameOldNancy @tomeguin65 @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Sweetheart, you don’t offend me. You bore me. I’m not really making an effort to make sense to you because your very first encounter with me was to insult me.

I’d like to say I expect that, too. But this is today’s Democratic Party we’re talking about.

@olney_dan What you’ve just said is premium enriched manure. Because you regurgitated it like a good little FoxNews watcher, you probably earned some GOP snowflake points of some sort. Now run along. I’m tired of you. If I wanted to shadow-box, I’d dye my hair orange and run for President.

@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Finally! I'm surprised you didn't understand that back when I said you'd acted "dicky." Is "dicky" a term of art in CA? 🙄 #thickasmud
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Im sure I'll never argue a point of law or legal ethics with you. 1. You lack understanding; &amp; 2. I don't respect you.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck No, you keep publicly criticizing, by all means. It "enhances" your "reputation," and rightfully so. You're making your own name.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck And I will STFU when I damn well please. If you're not happy losing this one, then block me. If you want me to spell-check your tweets, $$$
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck I didn't say according to the code of ethics and rules of professional conduct, "Sam." I choose my words carefully. Basic. Ethics. And. Prof
RT @katieschwartz: Please contact #ArizonaAG and ask for #Arpaio to be tried in AX. Numbers below https://t.co/GJVDawiTIa
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck You can deny all you want. You're unprofessional. You can rationalize, excuse, blather on. Doesn't change anything. You're unprofessional.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Lawyers are professionals. If one is trash-talking other lawyers, esp. publicly, he is acting unprofessionally. Period. Basic ethics &amp; prof
@SpeakerRyan - If 45's pardon was contrary 2 federal law; if he is daily acting against our constitutional principles of eq. prot., #impeach https://t.co/Gj39HKQ1DQ
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Sure. "He shouldn't have been on the beach if he didn't want sand kicked in his face!" Your self-hatred is showing.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Okay, "Sam." Keep deflecting to Jared. I'm not the one who has to live with trash-talking a fellow officer of the court.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Really? Yelp? You've fallen mighty far from the guy pissing on a fellow lawyer for being incompetent at his job. U know what u did was low.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Okay, "Sam," you're clearly standing by your unprofessional behavior. It's too bad. It says much more about you than it ever will about Beck
@MJack94 @Google I heard Billie Jean was not your lover,  just a girl who claimed that you were "the one," &amp; that the kid is not your son (musical flourish)
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck However, I'm beginning to hope all of your clients begin to think it's a pretty great idea when you lose.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck And BTW, I'm the client, too. I'm disappointed the case was dismissed. But I'm not compelled to humiliate a fellow lawyer over it.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Then send him an email. Don't publicly humiliate the guy over not just how he handled the case, but what kind of lawyer he is. That's dicky.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck So go to the bar. Otherwise you're just being a dick
@SocialistTaco @BernieUpstateNY Never mind. You're a human meme. Carry on.
@SocialistTaco @BernieUpstateNY Honestly, I'm curious: What do you call yourself? Independent? Progressive? Straight-up Socialist (as your handle suggests)?
@CapriTheater Appreciated Martin's column in the recent newsletter. Fair, straightforward, honest, genuine. The Capri has a gen in him.

@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Yes, I'm a lawyer, before you start checking. Yes, I've tried cases. But I don't stoop to being a dick to other lawyers. That's weak.
@LastSonofAnshan @JaredBeck Pfft. Says Mr. 5,000+ tweets. Have you won every case you ever tried? Ever tried any cases? Surely never taken on any class actions?
@mtracey Why don't you spend more time being an "independent journalist" like Jordan Chariton and less time as a judgmental Twitter vomiter?
