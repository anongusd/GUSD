(5/5) Practices have varied widely across agencies but I hope this information gives us a starting point to identify best practices, brainstorm new approaches, &amp; improve collaboration between OMWI offices.		You can watch my full opening statement here: https://t.co/yG3xXTNi8H
(4/5) Earlier this month, I contacted the eight regulatory agencies with Offices of Minority &amp; Women Inclusion (OMWI) to further understand agency efforts to increase diversity &amp; inclusion.
(3/5) While we need more data &amp; information, research shows that diversity &amp; inclusion can bring both social &amp; economic benefits to the workplace.
(2/5) However, there is still work to be done to ensure that the financial industry—along with many other sectors of the U.S. economy—is reaping the benefits of our country’s diversity.
(1/5) Today the Financial Services Diversity &amp; Inclusion Subcommittee held its inaugural hearing. Women &amp; minorities are growing their numbers &amp; securing leadership positions on Main Street, Wall Street, &amp; as elected officials.
I stood with my colleagues Whip @SteveScalise, @RepChrisSmith, @RepWalorski, and many other pro-life advocates as we spoke out on the importance of voting on and passing the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act so babies can receive the vital care they need to stay alive.
Today I implored my colleagues to stand up for life and bring the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act up for a vote. In the wake of Senate Democrats voting down this critical legislation, it is more essential than ever that we come together in defense of precious babies. https://t.co/KO78ag4FZm
I walked over to the Senate today in support of my pro-life colleagues and after the vote I was joined by my friends and pro-life warriors Rep. Vicky Hartzler, Marjorie Dannenfelser, and Melissa Ohden who are voices for the voiceless. https://t.co/0M6F8P2RBQ
Today Senate Democrats voted down the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, an unconscionable vote that embraces infanticide. Now more than ever it is critical that we fight for lifesaving care for precious babies who are born alive.
Visited the St. Louis Carpenters Training Facility with Senator @RoyBlunt. Their top-notch workforce development efforts and apprenticeship programs provide crucial resources to our community. https://t.co/rCeQCckG2r
Great to meet with constituents in Chesterfield today for our open office hours &amp; assist them in communicating with federal agencies. https://t.co/M42NilrkLC
(3/3) My bill ensures that babies who survive abortions receive immediate, lifesaving care--just as any other baby would. It is unthinkable that if a baby is born alive, anyone's first instinct could be anything but to try &amp; save that precious, innocent life by any means possible
(2/3) I introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act because babies are the most vulnerable members of our society, &amp; it's our responsibility to make sure they are cared for.
(1/3) It was my honor to host @melissaohden as she shared her experience of being an abortion survivor to an enthusiastic crowd of pro-life advocates from across St. Louis. https://t.co/9AuBZ45Q4f

I enjoyed meeting w/ Indian-American constituents from Saint Louis this week. Our Indian-American community has contributed greatly to Missouri’s 2nd District &amp; I am proud to work w/ constituents who are so invested in making our District a better place to live &amp; raise a family. https://t.co/m1ZGEEW3V7
(7/7) I voted no today on the rules package because the people of Missouri deserve fairness and this rules package neither embodies that, nor does it make life better for my constituents.
(6/7) This package also eliminates commonsense pro-life provisions that have long held broad support and protect the life of the unborn.
(5/7) It shouldn’t be easy to take more of your hard earned money and send it to Washington – it should be harder. 2nd District families are burdened enough by taxes, and the last thing Congress should be doing is making it easier to increase your taxes.
(4/7) One of the biggest partisan power grabs gives the Democratic majority the power to raise your taxes with only a simple majority, instead of the supermajority that was in place last Congress.
(3/7) That is why I am disappointed that Democrats decided to forgo bipartisanship on their first day in power when they forced through changes to the rules of the House of Representatives that will make life more difficult for our community.
(2/7) Whether it is my work to end human trafficking, supporting our veterans, or cutting the red tape that holds back American ingenuity, the needs of #MO2 come first.
(1/7) I am honored and privileged to work for you in Congress, and do my best to support bipartisan solutions to our nation’s most urgent problems.
to strengthen our community we can ensure that it remains one full of hope and opportunity for the future. I look forward to seeing you &amp; your families back home in Missouri, &amp; if you are visiting Washington, D.C., please visit our new office in room 2350 in the Rayburn Building.

In this trade deal, and in future negotiations, the Wagner Language seeks to guide other nations to enact strong laws that protect victims and dismantle this horrific industry.

Today, @marcorubio and I announced our conservative paid parental leave legislation for working American families. For more information, visit my website: https://t.co/xNeyJrGE7H
Our legislation will expand freedom and flexibility, and make parenthood more affordable. These irreplaceable weeks, the relationships and peace of mind of our moms, dads, and children—these are the things worth fighting for.
Research shows that women who have paid leave are more likely to return to work after having a child. Families shouldn’t have to choose between financial stability and the well-being of their children.
We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not offer access to paid maternity leave. Without access to paid leave, parents face lower labor force participation and reduced lifetime earnings, despite needing a steady income then more than ever.

Doing nothing is not a solution, and today’s result is a disappointment for everyone who wants to protect families, enforce the border, build the wall, &amp; reform our legal immigration system.
Today, I voted for the ONLY bill that would have ensured funding for border security &amp; a wall along the southern border. It would have fixed our outdated immigration system, provided a legal solution for DACA children, &amp; guaranteed families are kept together while being processed

We are taking action to prevent drug overdoses, provide treatment to those in need, &amp; keep fentanyl from pouring into our country. We are giving communities the resources they need to fight back against this epidemic &amp; offer hope for a better tomorrow. #OpioidCrisis
Every day, 175 Americans die from opioid overdoses. Last year in the Midwest alone, the rate of opioid overdoses increased by 70%. Drug addiction is killing our friends &amp; neighbors. Over the last two weeks, Congress passed over 60 pieces of legislation to reverse this epidemic. https://t.co/hr18l0EHoj
This week marked six months since Congress passed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, and in the House Financial Services Committee, we spoke with small business owners about how our tax reform package is helping companies like theirs: https://t.co/7I6YImXP8G
Earlier this week, we honored our Class of 2022 service academy appointees from Missouri’s 2nd District with a dinner for them and their families. I am so proud of these 21 young men and women headed to the five academies, and ultimately to serve our country! https://t.co/CAYucefbiv
A modernized immigration system will allow us to better enforce the rule of law and keep the American Dream alive.
Congress is working w/ @POTUS on a solution that secures our border &amp; builds the wall. It will strengthen interior enforcement, reform our immigration system, provide a solution for the DACA children, &amp; ensure families can stay together while being processed at the border.
As a nation founded on Judeo-Christian values, it is unacceptable and heartbreaking to have young children separated from their parents at the border.
Mike’s leadership has strengthened his district in mid-Missouri as well as our state, and he will be a welcome addition to Missouri's executive branch in Jefferson City.
I applaud @GovParsonMO for choosing a strong, conservative leader as our next Lt. Governor. Over the three decades I have had the privilege of calling @Mikelkehoe a friend &amp; colleague, he has been a true citizen servant who puts the people, values, &amp; traditions of MO first.
Happy to help Corporal Cottrell Fox obtain his long overdue Silver Star! He’s truly earned the respect and admiration of our nation for his gallantry and heroism during the Vietnam War. We owe him and all our armed service members a priceless debt of gratitude. https://t.co/kvHg1IwdV2

The Senate just voted to proceed to my bill, #FOSTA. This legislation will give victims a pathway to justice and ensure that the businesses selling our children online can no longer do so with impunity. I look forward to the Senate vote on final passage later this week.

Most importantly—after 30 years of a ballooning tax code—this historic tax reform sets the stage for American families and our economy to prosper. #TaxCutsandJobsAct
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is pro-family tax reform that expands the Child Tax Credit, doubles the standard deduction, lowers individual rates, and preserves the adoption tax credit and retirement savings options I fought hard to keep.
Today, we are delivering on that promise and no media hyperbole or partisan backlash will change the bottom line. This bill cuts taxes for middle income Missourians, allows American businesses to flourish, and paves the way for an increase of good-paying jobs.
In 2012, the people of Missouri's 2nd Congressional District sent me to Congress, and I promised them that I would find a way for families to keep more of their hard-earned money.

@FRCdc "I ask for your help in spreading the message &amp; recruiting cosponsors for this bill. This is a serious battle that can't be fought alone."
@FRCdc "I’m optimistic, but I’m also painfully aware that Congress has unaccountably chosen to defer to mistaken courts many times before."
@FRCdc "The question now is will Congress act to protect the innocent who are sold online or let my bill fall into oblivion to protect Backpage."
@FRCdc ...and the federal government should be able to pursue criminal charges against websites that are recklessly facilitating the crime."
@FRCdc "State Attorneys General should be able to enforce their sex trafficking laws; victims should be allowed to bring cases against websites...
@FRCdc "I find it hard to imagine that if a business hosted a slave auction, the auctioneer could not be held criminally liable."
@FRCdc "Congress obviously never intended Section 230, passed over 20 years ago, to create a lawless internet."
@FRCdc "Section 230 also blocks states from bringing criminal cases against websites that facilitate trafficking."
@FRCdc "Courts have construed Section 230 to mean that sex trafficking victims who have been sold on Backpage have no recourse against them."
@FRCdc "Congress has consistently failed to ensure proper implementation of sex trafficking laws in America’s court system."
@FRCdc "The venues of sexual exploitation have changed. But our laws remain stuck in time."
@FRCdc "Despite all our rhetoric, sex trafficking in America seems to continue unabated."

How essential the family has been to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support &amp; encouragement! #PopeInDC

In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society #PopeInDC
We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity &amp; solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good #PopeInDC
Our response must instead be one of hope &amp; healing, of peace and &amp; justice. #PopeInDC
Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good &amp; cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity &amp; solidarity #PopeInDC
