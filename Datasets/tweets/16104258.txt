@cecmunoz lol
Last thing! For now! Prioritization of “women’s issues” is where women expressed one of the greatest partisan divides: 63% of Dem women said the government is not adequately prioritizing women’s issues, only 35% of Republicans women agreed.
Another interpretation was that health care was a reflection of anxiety over cost and cost of living.
“One of the truisms of public policy is that once you give it, it’s really hard to take it away. We’ve had a few years of the Affordable Care Act. You may not like Obama, but you like having health care.” @DrVMDS
Asked which three issues they are most passionate about, 67% of women chose health care, 48%chose education, and 43% chose the economy.
“The public is more likely to identify honesty and ethics with women than they are with men. That has always been a place where women candidates can try to tout their advantage.” @kdittmar
Asked which three traits were most important for an ideal political candidate, 66 percent of women chose “honesty,” 42 percent chose “consistent track record,” 23 percent chose “shared values” and 19 percent chose “years of political experience.”
The biggest motivator for those thinking of running for office? Seeing that someone without traditional political experience can win.
“If you align with Trump, you may feel you can’t talk about your views on campus or with your friends. If you have felt that these are not the majority views of women of your generation, and your candidate then wins the White House, it might be validating.” @KSoltisAnderson
The most activated vote segment, according to the poll, consisted of women who voted for Trump; 40% of these women also said the outcome of the election increased the likelihood of their becoming more politically involved.
"The ambition theory...is problematic &amp; in some cases dangerous. It puts the onus on the individual to have the answers. That can be racist &amp; classist, because it ignores all of these system that stop you from getting the information that you need to participate.” @JessicaLBYRD
“One of the reasons our government looks the way it does and feels the way it does is a product of systemic barriers to entry." @JessicaLBYRD
But! the poll also found women of color are more likely than white women to see barriers early on the process: 24% of WOC say that the reason they are less likely to run for office is that they “don’t know where to start,” compared to 16% of white women who said the same
Women of color and Trump supporters are the most likely to say that the results of the election inspired them to become more politically engaged or run for office themselves.
