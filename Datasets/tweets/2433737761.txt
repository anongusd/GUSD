It’s been nearly 10 years since the Federal Minimum Wage was increased. At $7.25 an hour, that’s just $15,000 a year for a full-time worker. It’s time to give millions of Americans a raise. Proud to support the #RaiseTheWage Act https://t.co/NhFBIkBaeP
While we are in the business of condemning hate speech, Republican leadership should also repudiate President Trump’s long history of racial divisiveness, including equivocating on white nationalism.
Yesterday, I voted with 424 of my colleagues to condemn white supremacy and white nationalism. We must never hesitate to condemn racism of every form. Stoking racial divisions, as Congressman King has done for years, cannot be tolerated. It is time the House pushed back.

The Republican Senate overwhelmingly passed bipartisan funding legislation that would have avoided a shutdown, including significant funding for effective border security. The House has passed nearly identical language. @POTUS needs to end this charade and open the government!
Continuing to hold out with no path forward is not leadership, its brinksmanship. The President has back himself into a corner and is causing long-term, possibly irrevocable harm to our country.
Government websites are vulnerable. Food inspections have stopped. Hurricane preparations have stopped.  Airport safety is increasingly compromised. National Parks are being permanently damaged.
Federal employees are at risk of losing their cars, their homes, missing payments for medications, education, or other bills. Coast Guardsmen were advised to sell their possessions and others to trade chores for rent.
@RealDonaldTrump continues to make history for all the wrong reasons. The government shutdown has entered day 24, the longest shutdown in the history of our country. This wound is entirely self-inflicted by the President, and we need to hold him accountable.
I was pleased to join @USRepKCastor in urging @GovRonDeSantis &amp; @AGAshleyMoody to expand Medicaid &amp; help protect FL families and people with pre-existing conditions.

ICYMI, the President just stormed out of discussions with Democratic leaders to re-open the government, calling it a “total waste of time.” Another temper-tantrum by this President holding millions of American families hostage…
Last night, @POTUS spoke of a humanitarian crisis “of the heart” and “of the soul.” Today, he threatened to cut off 40M Americans from emergency disaster relief. In threatening victims to win political points, Trump is again demonstrating his inability to govern with compassion.
The President can reopen the government tonight by supporting bipartisan funding bills that have passed the House and received overwhelming support in the Republican Senate. Instead, he continues to grandstand. 		This isn’t leadership; it’s a ransom demand. https://t.co/w1Y6bQl0lA
I am grateful to @SpeakerPelosi and the Democratic leadership team for appointing me Vice Chairman of @RulesDemocrats and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process. I look forward to working with @RepMcGovern to institute a fair and democratic process. https://t.co/Ch4j9fEoPu
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That’s not a pattern – that’s an epidemic. Congress has to step up &amp; pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place.
If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. It’s just that simple. #HR8
Today - 8 years since Rep. @GabbyGiffords &amp; 18 other people were shot in Tucson, AZ - Democrats will introduce a bipartisan bill to expand background checks for sales &amp; transfers of firearms. Gun violence has absolutely no place in our communities. https://t.co/OZoYbxuDj4
Day 18 of the #GovernmentShutdown. The President is still holding the well-being of the American people hostage, including over 13,000 FL families not receiving their paychecks. @POTUS should reopen the government &amp; support effective border security solutions, not a wasteful wall https://t.co/fwV68QWN3L

As the government shutdown stretches into week 3, more than 800k federal employees are furloughed or working without pay. @RealDonaldTrump also ordered a pay freeze for most federal employees for 2019.

@RealDonaldTrump has dragged his 3rd government shutdown into day 12. Tomorrow, the Democratic Majority will vote to reopen the government &amp; put an end to this partisan grandstanding. The President &amp; Senate should join us in ending this manufactured crisis.
5 years ago today, the ACA brought an end to insurance companies being able to discriminate against people who have preexisting conditions. So many people were denied basic coverage, but Obamacare changed that. We can’t go back to the old days.
Wishing all a Happy New Year filled with good health, prosperity, and joy. There is so much to be thankful for, and so many challenges ahead of us. I look forward to getting to work for all Floridians and our nation as the 116th Congress gets underway.
@RealDonaldTrump: It’s shameful that you politicize the deaths of migrant children in our custody without any compassion or humanity. Our values compel us to protect children, not promote reckless policies that needlessly endanger their wellbeing. https://t.co/qduGp1HpzY
Congrats @USRepKCastor on being appointed Chair of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. I look forward to working together in the 116th Congress to fight climate change, protect our environment, promote public health, create green jobs &amp; ensure a sustainable future.
One by one, Trump’s most capable and independent advisors are quitting. Soon, the President will have no professional policy experts by his side, only politically-minded sycophants unwilling to challenge him. This should alarm everyone.
His resignation letter reads, “My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held," contrasting Trump’s nonchalant approach to America’s leadership across the globe.
Secretary Mattis is a steadying voice against the worst political whims of the Trump Administration. While he was not always successful, he is nevertheless a professional who understands the nuances of leadership. https://t.co/2hO5dzljrm
These decorated soldiers served our nation with honor and distinction. I offer my heartfelt condolences to their families and loved ones during this difficult time.

The President’s abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria despite a number of unresolved &amp; pressing national security matters is extremely troubling. Abdicating American leadership in Syria, leaving Russia &amp; Iran to assert themselves uncontested, is not in our best interests. https://t.co/brkUl99yDn
My bill, #HR160 would end this barbaric practice for good. I intend to reintroduce it in the 116th Congress and work with @EdWorkforceDems to make it a priority for House Democrats.
Researchers have found that black students, boys and disabled students continue to be physically punished at a greater rate than their classmates.
Corporal punishment has no place in public schools but is still legal in 19 states. More than 100K students were physically punished last year, being hit, slapped, and spanked. https://t.co/hj3sPfm37J
The epidemic of gun violence is growing. In 2017, there were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in the United States, the highest in decades. We cannot hope to prevent future school shootings without confronting the role of guns in gun violence. (5/5)
By continuing to ignore the overwhelming evidence and embracing policies that don’t make students safer, @RealDonaldTrump is trying to turn the keys to our public schools over to the gun lobby. The Administration is using our children to drive its reckless agenda. (4/5)
Rather than emphasizing proven methods for preventing shootings from ever taking place - such as anti-bullying programs, mental health support, &amp; culturally responsive practices, the School Safety Commission Report focuses on the moment a shooter is on campus. (3/5)
Even worse, Secretary DeVos is using the report as an opportunity to push a radial effort to rescind anti-discrimination protections in schools, falsely blaming shootings on “discipline.” (2/5)
The Federal School Safety Commission Report released today reads as if it was written by NRA lobbyists. Rather than address key drivers of school shootings – easy access to handguns and assault-style weapons – it proposes putting more guns in schools and arming teachers. (1/5)
Friday’s absurd court ruling follows 70+ failed attempts by Congressional Republicans to dismantle the ACA &amp; 2 SCOTUS rulings upholding the law. Dismantling life-saving protections that help children, seniors, &amp; those with pre-existing conditions is not in America's best interest https://t.co/f3RjoOn6XT
“Nearly 40,000 people in the United States died by guns last year, marking the highest number of gun deaths in decades.” 		I’ll never understand those who place a higher value on guns than human life. @HouseDemocrats will pass gun control next year. The Senate must follow suit. https://t.co/XrK7hrjynd
Today marks six years since the tragic #SandyHook shooting claiming the innocent lives of 20 children and six educators. Let us remember the families who lost loved ones and renew our commitment to bring safety back to our schools and end #gunviolence.
The President's conflicting comments on the National Climate Assessment exhibit his lack of knowledge &amp; concern on issues pertaining to the environment. I have joined my colleagues in urging @POTUS to remain committed to the Paris Agreement &amp; enforce clean air &amp; water safeguards.
I commend the House's passage of a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill that includes support for farmers, life-saving programs like SNAP, conservation efforts, &amp; important animal welfare provisions such as the Dog &amp; Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, which I have been proud to champion. https://t.co/dCEz0QKx0m
Secretary Pompeo is continuing to undermine our intelligence community and the very agency that he once led.  It is time for the President to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The #DirtyWaterRule will cancel Clean Water Act protections for the streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions of people. We can't let that happen. We must #ProtectCleanWater
With the #DirtyWaterRule, the President is moving to undo decades of bipartisan protection for clean water, putting our health and outdoors at risk of more toxic pollution! #ProtectCleanWater
Despite huge public support for commonsense protections for clean water, President Trump chooses  to side with dirty energy polluters over scientists, our health, and the environment with his #DirtyWaterRule. We can't allow it to move forward. #ProtectCleanWater
I implore @POTUS to put politics aside and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement.
The Paris Agreement was reached after years painstaking negotiations, with the promise of leaving future generations with a cleaner world. The President’s own administration knows the dire economic hardships our nation will endure if we ignore this.

I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Jahmar Resilard. Capt. Resilard, of Miramar, FL, was an F/A-18 fighter pilot in the Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 242 stationed on Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi, Japan.

Now, more than ever, the Special Counsel’s investigation must be allowed to continue unimpeded. Congress must act to ensure that no one, be it the President or members of his administration, be allowed to interfere or stifle this investigation.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller has brought 192 criminal charges against more than 30 defendants in his investigation into President Trump’s involvement of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.
Today’s guilty plea from President Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen makes it clear that the President repeatedly lied about his business interests in Russia and that his associates were willing to lie and deceive Congress to cover it up.
The historically diverse 116th Congress will be the 1st time that 2 African Americans will hold top leadership positions in Congress simultaneously. Congrats @OfficialCBC Members @RepJeffries on being elected Democratic Caucus Chair &amp; Rep. @Clyburn on being elected Majority Whip.

Open rules allow every Member of Congress, regardless of their party affiliation or political ideology, to take part in the legislative process. Every Member should have a voice. This is after all the “People's House” &amp; all Members should be allowed to participate in the process.

The ACA is not perfect. But rather than working together to make it stronger and better, House Republicans have only worked to undermine it or repeal it without an alternative. 70 votes have been taken to gut the ACA, driving up costs for taxpayers &amp; consumers. #ProtectOurCare
The #ACA also provides key preventive health services—such as flu shots, cancer screenings, and birth control—at no cost to Americans with insurance. #ProtectOurCare
The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. Any effort to sabotage the ACA jeopardizes these protections. #ProtectOurCare

The #TrumpBudget shows the #GOPTaxScam for what it really is. Rather than producing surpluses as Republicans falsely claimed, the WH’s own math shows that it will add trillions to the debt.
The #TrumpBudget is such a joke it’s barely worth commenting on. It cuts Social Security to pay for the border wall with Mexico. It includes a $250 billion cut to #Medicaid and $214 billion in cuts to food assistance – and it still results in $7 trillion of new deficit spending.
The President’s infrastructure plan, which provides $200 billion in direct investment over a decade, also cuts $206 billion from existing infrastructure programs. America deserves a #BetterDeal, not the President’s nonsensical joke of a plan.
After ramming through a $1.5 trillion deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam, @RealDonaldTrump’s infrastructure plan urges states to increase property taxes, sales taxes, and tolls to pay for infrastructure investments. The Democratic #BetterDeal plan proposes 5x more direct investment.
The President released the flawed #NunesMemo over the objections of the FBI and the DOJ because he thought it would help him. He blocked the Democratic Memo because he knows it will hurt him. @RealDonaldTrump: Americans deserve the truth. Stop politicizing national security.

Less than a week after the SOTU @RealDonaldTrump is back to name-calling on Twitter. If the President put this much effort into responsible budgeting or bipartisan immigration reform, we might actually get something done around here. https://t.co/2KhNeD9xjr
Only 15 percent of workers have access to paid family leave. Not having a national paid leave policy hurts workers and results in higher job turnover, lost wages, and billions in lost economic benefits. As we mark #FMLA25, it’s time for Congress to enact a #PaidLeave standard.
Republicans just released the Nunes Memo, ignoring warnings from the FBI and Department of Justice that doing so will endanger national security. As the former Vice Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I am outraged by this reckless decision. https://t.co/P0MHyPFTl3
Last week, my colleagues @RepBrianMast, @RepLoisFrankel, and I attended the official ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the shared-space agreement at the @VAWestPalmBeach https://t.co/hxVz3Swph2
My thoughts are with my @GOP colleagues, their families, and staff.  I was very saddened to learn there was a fatality in today’s tragic Amtrak collision.  I wish those injured a speedy recovery.
One evening of faux-bipartisanship does not erase the President’s failures over the past year. The President’s policies speak for themselves, and I do not believe for one second that the coming year will be any different. #SOTU https://t.co/biQpIkb5rY
@RealDonaldTrump’s first Muslim Ban, enacted one year ago today and just one week into his Presidency, was a shameful &amp; discriminatory policy grounded in fear rather than fact. I call on the Administration to resume the processing of refugees immediately.

One year ago, President Trump reinstated and expanded the #GlobalGagRule. The rule continues to prevent women in developing countries from receiving life-saving healthcare like HIV treatment &amp; cancer screenings. Congress must pass H.R.671, the Global HER Act!
I am pleased to announce the official ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the shared-space agreement at the VAMC-WPB will take place this Friday, with @RepTedDeutch, @RepLoisFrankel, and @RepBrianMast For more details: https://t.co/4BpI3zL0AQ
We are just 4 months into the fiscal year, yet the Republican-run Congress has needed 4 short-term funding bills to keep the government running. It is absolutely shameful that Congress has kicked the can down the road again. #TrumpShutdown My statement: https://t.co/4JD1Puxxrk
Russian meddling didn’t stop with the election. We need to address it, and to stop playing politics with national security. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/YsfSYyL5Fu
Yesterday, Democrats offered 10 separate motions in the House to end the #GovernmentShutdown. Republicans blocked every one of them. The Republicans are making it clear: they prefer a shutdown to a bipartisan deal. Shame on them! #TrumpShutdown
@RealDonaldTrump: You are the President. Act like it. Tell your staff you want a compromise to end the #GovernmentShutdown. Don’t walk away from a deal just because fringe members of your staff want to keep the #TrumpShutdown going. https://t.co/5ozqKiwMYO
A bipartisan group of 20 Senators are making progress on a deal to end the #TrumpShutdown. House Republicans, without even seeing the deal, said they won't support it. "My way or the highway" won't cut it.
America is an idea, with ideals and values. We don’t exclude people. But that’s what this CR does. It includes nothing for jobs or pensions. It doesn’t provide the resources my district needs. Long before the #GovernmentShutdown, people were shut out. It must stop! https://t.co/5LBRGGGpet
An entire segment of Congress was given ZERO input on this CR. That's just not right. I've been here 25 years, and can tell you it gets us nowhere. It needs to stop! #TrumpShutdown
#TrumpShutdown Fact: This is the 2nd GOP Shutdown in 5 years. It’s the fifth time the GOP has shut down the government in 30 years. It’s the first shutdown in modern history when one party held the House, Senate and White House.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: Parts of Puerto Rico are still without power 4 months after Hurricane Maria. It’s unclear how ongoing FEMA recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will be impacted.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: During a government shutdown, recipients will continue to receive their Social Security and SSI checks. No new Social Security Cards will be issued, impacting 60k people daily.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: The GOP held the CHIP program hostage (a version that cost $6 billion more than it should have). The program expired 112 days ago. If they were serious about protecting children, they could have voted for it 111 days ago. Or 110 days ago. Or 109, 108… etc.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: During a shutdown, the Small Business Administration stops approving small business loans and guarantees ($1 billion per month). During the 2013 shutdown, the SBA couldn’t process 700 applications for $140 million in loans.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: During the shutdown, the VA will cease reducing the backlog of Veterans disability claims. However, all VA medical facilities and clinics will remain open and operational. Call centers and hotlines will not be available.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: Approximately 2/3rds of CDC and 3/4ths of NIH employees will be furloughed. We will lose valuable research and be unable to monitor the spread of contagious diseases. The FDA will cease the majority of its food safety activities.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: The IRS is required to implement the GOP tax plan that was pushed through Congress last year. It’s complicated, and lots of my constituents have questions. The GOP just sent home nearly 60 percent of the IRS' workforce, adding delays and confusion.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: 8,500 CDC employees will be furloughed as a result of the shutdown. This will severely impact our ability to monitor and treat the flu, which is particularly severe this year. We risk a number of supply shortages, including antiviral supplies.
The House Rules Committee is meeting right now to give same-day authority to whatever deal gets made to reopen the government. Still no word on when the GOP will compromise. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/V39Ufz6bFL
#TrumpShutdown Fact: The 16-day government shutdown in 2013 caused about 120,000 fewer private sector jobs to be created, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: According to S&amp;P Global analysts, the shutdown will cost the economy about $6.5 billion per week. This is approximately 0.2 percent of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: The shutdown in 2013 cost our government a combined total of 6.6 million work days.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: Roughly 850,000 people will be furloughed as a direct result of the government shutdown. It will take an act of Congress, signed by the President, for them to get their pay back.
#TrumpShutdown Fact: The President walked away from a bipartisan deal. The GOP froze democrats out of the process. This Administration has leapt from one controversy to another, throwing our government into complete disarray. This shutdown is on them.
We are now in the 2nd GOP government shutdown in 5 years. Despite controlling the WH, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, President Trump’s Republican Party can’t even meet the most basic requirements of governing. #TrumpShutdown My statement: https://t.co/kFcRVHJWLg
