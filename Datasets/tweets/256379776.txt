@AOC @AyannaPressley No POTUS signature means you are doing nothing but wasting my money dipshit.
@AOC Tell someone when you get a POTUS signature on it. Then you have done something freshman.
@AOC Your so cool. What a freaking infant.
@billmaher Yes he is.
@KamalaHarris Wages have increased under DT better than last 15 years so quit lying like a dog. The way we know you’re lying is your lips are moving.
@AOC Truth hurts don’t it baby girl. If you can’t handle the heat quit ordering out.
@maziehirono Just Incase you didn’t know if you can find 59 people in the senate that agrees with you then do something instead of bitchin and complaining because that’s all you do. You have never changed any laws because you’re stuck in your small racist mind.
@JohnCornyn @CoryBooker &amp; @KamalaHarris has totally made up their minds that they’re going to agree with everything at this point with zero evidence they have even read many of far lefts agenda. They fall for anything and stand for nothing.

@Acosta Poor baby! Life is so tough on you.
@AOC says climate change is so terrible you may not want to have children but in the next breath she wants millions of illegals too pour into the country. She has went full on bonkers. @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker and DNC chair Perez support her 100%. Come on man!!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted on the face you’re argument is flawed because you have a track record of Obama farting and you saying how good it smelled. If you would actually give a non-partisan opinion people may start too listen. Until then it’s looked at as total bullshit.

No way can @cnn try to pretend Jake tells viewers truths about Trump. It’s impossible but they do it everyday &amp; wonder why no one trusts them anymore.
@cnn @donlemon have 0 evidence Trump had anything to do with Bezos story. Does that matter no they still told the story on tv. I believe Lemon has a love crush on Trump. Every thing he talks about has to include Trump. Lemon does like older white men &amp; that’s a fact. He dates 1.
@SenKamalaHarris You voted no because @SenSchumer told you to plain and simple.
@AOC No doubt Republicans control this lady.

@KamalaHarris All you have said to anyone who would listen is the Pres. is guilty. I heard chair of senate intelligence committee comes out and says zero evidence after twos years and you are silent. Weird right.
@SenSchumer How can the senate Intel chairman come out and say zero collusion found. You are silent after two years of telling everyone who would listen that he is guilty. Little odd?

@RealMattCouch Who says she would even have the opportunity. That shows how immature she is and obviously zero ability to get anything done. Why would you not speak shake hands or do whatever it takes to make things happen for the people who sent u to Congress. I bet they prefer u get shit done

@KamalaHarris Why have you let a Republican plant push you so far left that people in your own party hate you.
@KamalaHarris I really thought Kampala was smarter than this I can’t believe she let @AOC push her so far right and end her campaign before it can get going. If people don’t believe AOC works for R’s then they are way more naive than I thought.
@StormyDaniels She has admitted on tape to screwing him for a spot on apprentice but she was just put together by DT to get in the panties. It happens in all kind of business. She just took the bait because she was desperate. No different than a chick falling for a good line.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ted knows polls are always spot on.
@brianstelter Now you’re a psychologist
@RussPalmer @StormyDaniels I can’t believe people hate DT so much that they take the side of a proud nasty whore.
@StormyDaniels She is a professional sex for money worker. I think is what she is trying to say. Sir just because it is the grossest thing you can imagine she is proud to be a whore. I bet she had a great childhood if u don’t think so just ask her.
@KamalaHarris Let’s be real uncomfortable and ask a senator a question she refuses to answer. Did you sleep with a 60 yr old married man when you were 30 for a 6 figure job in politics. Yes or no?
@tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi You sound like you’re rooting for a football team but you know these are American lives were talking about right. I have never heard a elected official use people’s lives like Pete Rose betting on baseball. Sad times very sad.
@StormyDaniels I know what people mean when they use mainstream but what in the world is mainstream to you.
@Acosta How did you get invited
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Shows you and Nancy ‘s stupid partisan nonsense was crazy. Trump said he would have taken 2.1 billion. So Chuck and Nancy have cost us 10 billion and still no border security. What morons.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump What do you want Nancy a cookie.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Do you know how much Obama or Trump watches. No you don’t so try and report on something that actually matters to Americans you partisan hack.
@JoeNBC Come on Joe are you really taking the side of a racist crazy white man.
@KamalaHarris Who will she sleep with for donations.
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 30 million dollars 20 attorneys 2 years and only process crimes. Come on Ted if this was a Dem you would be screaming in the streets for it to end. Quit being such a partisan hack and start doing something positive for the country.
@KamalaHarris Funny because all I see you do is bitch and complain and I have yet to see you complete any legislation. I also just read that you got your start in politics by sleeping with a guy 30 yrs your senior while he was married. I bet your mom is so proud.
@georgepbush @tombrokaw I guarantee everyone around you is afraid to speak open and honest because they don’t want to misspeak. Sad existence to walk on egg shells all day. You need to grow and realize you’re not the center of universe.
@ananavarro You must have a sad existence to let everyone and everything trigger you.  I hope you can grow as a person. I believe you would be much happier and the people around don’t have to walk or talk on egg shells.
@jemelehill I feel sorry for people like you that walk through life looking for BS that only makes you and everyone else unhappy. Such a sad existence.
@JoyAnnReid How naive do u really think people are. I am beginning to believe your critics. The only reason u are on tv is your a black woman.
@StormyDaniels How can you say you haven’t played the victim. You sued the Pres for money honey. We know u didn’t get paid for the sex we all know he conned you into that by u being stupid enough to believe he would put u on apprentice.
@perlmutations @BetoORourke What a total puss you have become
@perlmutations @KamalaHarris Shocker! I mean she hates everything about America and @perlmutations likes what other reasons do u need to dislike her. Maybe she screwed her way into politics or that she is racist.
@StormyDaniels She is a trashy whore who embraces it. She is a different animal. Just FYI.
@AOC Lady get a clue then speak. It’s the best advice anyone will ever give you.

@KamalaHarris Why do you always use color and gender when u speak about people. Always a black man or a gay woman. Why can’t u just say man or woman.
@JoyAnnReid Funny 3 years even u spoke truth to Nancy now she is your hero. I guarantee she has your best interest at heart. That’s how stupid u sound infant. If you were not a Minority &amp; a woman no way way would you have a job a @cnn.  It must suck to know this &amp; have to speak well of N P.
@perlmutations Hey snowflake puss puss what   Gives you the right too talk shit about my President.
@ananavarro Please tell me what R policy beliefs do you have.
@PreetBharara @eliehonig And you call Trump a criminal. What a p o s you are.
@MSNBC Because she says totally stupid shit and the media acts like she is amazing. She has not even lived yet but she knows what’s best for everyone. If she was crazy smart I would still say this but she is stupid and has no experiences except waiting tables in NY.
@MMFlint She is wrong for California but she is totally wrong for AMERICA.
@ananavarro I was so happy when I found out @cnn pays u peanuts because that’s what you’re worth.
@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 This shows what a bubble this guy lives in. He believes R’s always cause problems and D’s are the best thing since sliced bread. Any one with the sense god gave a billy goat knows both sides are in the wrong and they need to work together for all Americans.
@KamalaHarris Well then get to steppin and quit bitching. Anyone can sit around and tell everyone wants wrong but only a few can step up and lead and solve problems.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted is the most jealous person I have ever seen
@ananavarro Ana you’re the biggest p.o.s. On tv I mean for anyone to rejoice at someone else’s hurt takes a special kinda bitch.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted why don’t you actually work for all Americans not just friends
@SenWarren What ever happened to working for what you have. All you want to do is reward people for doing nothing. It sickens me that Americans think this way
@AOC Lady don’t pretend you know what R’s or Billionaires want or need. I guarantee one thing if you would get out of your little bubble you just might learn that the things you have read maybe BS but until you do all u have is what u have read and your very small bubble u live in.
@KamalaHarris Your Mom must be very disappointed in the way you conduct yourself. If what you say is true about her. And that’s a big fing IF.
@perlmutations Only D’s and dumbasses like you fall for that shit.
@JoyAnnReid Joy acts like she is in high school and just got over on a freshman. Lady wake up you are speaking about real people with brothers &amp; sisters, parents &amp; grandparents. I would encourage you too act like a professional if that’s possible.

@ChrisCuomo Wow why didn’t you feel that way about Kavanaugh. Oh he was the other party. If this doesn’t prove Cuomo is A partisan hack then you just don’t wanna know.
@SenBlumenthal This guy lies about everything including his own service in the military. It takes a special kind of liar &amp; manipulator to lie about foreign service.

@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So dead Americans are now talking points to Dems. Thanks Ted for being so brutally honest.
@CarlaRexrode @RepMcGovern @realDonaldTrump Is that why you have a problem with him. He had a better start than you.
@ChuckCallesto This lady slept her way to the top. I believe she would sit women back 20 years by that point alone.
@NBCNews One is too many.
@SenWarren Just settle it’s what has been done for over two centuries.
@SenKamalaHarris All you need to do is call Chuck and tell him too settle. It really is just that easy. It’s no mystery.
@siano2020 She plays for keeps that’s for sure. She is ruthless but no match for the Don. Hillary was suppose to wipe the floor with him and studied like the last final of law school and got played like a drum.
@perlmutations If you really believed this I know you would do something about it I mean come on. That’s why we all know it’s just bullshit. If anyone thought this and did absolutely nothing would mean they didn’t care at all. If other words stfu or do something.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Shocker
@JoyAnnReid @KatyTurNBC TDS is strong wit this one.
@Acosta It’s true you freaking infant.
@KamalaHarris Liar Liar no one has missed a check. I repeat no one has missed a dollar yet. The very people they say DT lies are the biggest liars by far.
@StormyDaniels Shocker
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr No Nancy the man has spoken you have over played your hand. Just meet in the middle and both walk away with something. He said years lady. You are just wasting money now dumbass.
@tedlieu @SecNielsen Ted’ you need help the TDS is strong with you my friend.
@brianstelter Jelly much. You should just say what you mean like omg I would give my right kidney and nut if he wouldn’t use his damn presidency powers. Darn it too hell !!
@perlmutations What a f$$king dumbass.
@StormyDaniels @OnlyFansApp Pay Trump and FYI your attorney has been evicted. You know the one that has pending charges for abusing his girlfriend with bodily harm. It’s a felony charge.  Maybe hire a real lawyer and sue Avenatti.
@KamalaHarris So go to your leadership Schumer and tell him you’re ready to make a deal. Simple. I thought you had some sense.
@StormyDaniels  your lawyer has been evicted from his office and has you owing $385,000 to Trump which everyone knows you don’t have. Question is are you going to sue Avenatti for the money. He is a little strapped at the minute.
@CoryBooker You should know brother because you try it every chance u get. I guess all senators have amnesia
@StormyDaniels Is that what you call it now.
@KamalaHarris I love how you use the Constitution only when it helps your argument but throw it away when it totally shuts your point down.  I know the definition of these people do you.
@BreitbartNews So the black and Hispanic don’t have to. Please tell me how that works.
@tedlieu @SecNielsen Ok Genius can you guarantee me and my family and all families.  No one will cross border illegally and kill innocent people. No I didn’t think so. Please tell me how the wall doesn’t help ?
@JimCarrey Oh great Jim is giving away shit art that’s worth zero. What a guy.
@SpeakerPelosi You said you would open government immediately because the constitution gives you equal power to POTUS and it not done. You fail on first promise.
@CarlaRexrode TDS is in overdrive on this one.
@RepMcGovern @CarlaRexrode @realDonaldTrump This is incredibly stupid. You showed like five companies that have closed but if you listed the successful companies he is way ahead. I mean losers don’t have 5 BILLION or win the presidency or donate the 400 grand in salary he earns.
@RashidaTlaib @CarlaRexrode You should read it because obviously you haven’t. Actions are much stronger than words.
@CarlaRexrode @SenGillibrand Dems say they want Congress to look like America.
@guypbenson Anyone that gives people like that a second of time it’s a waste of time. I guarantee anyone who argues for 70% tax rates has zero money and has not ever made any real $. Think about 70% so u take your 30 and spend it oh u have to pay 8to 10 in sales tax now u have 20 out of 100
How can Bernie Sanders answer a sexist question with I was too busy too notice and get away with it. If a republican had said that @cnn @MSNBC @FoxNews would have been Calling for a resignation. I mean he sells himself as the progressive golden Standard.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats You still need Senate and Big Dawg’s signature lady.
@SenWarren From the lady that cheated minority’s to get teaching job at Harvard.  You can’t say she doesn’t have balls because it takes big ass brass ones to pull that off.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC This idiot was all for the wall when BO asked what has changed Joe. Why now believe the wall doesn’t work. Literally every wall currently used for this purpose has a 90 +approval rating. Joe please tell me you’re not being swayed on emotion &amp; hate of DT for safety of Americans.
@KamalaHarris I will take a few lates guys over planes crashing into buildings. If you are that worried about people tell your leader Chuck that you want to secure border and open gov. I meant u ok’d 100 billion for other countries why will u not help your own.
@SallyQYates You know as well as I do 5 billion is a ridiculous small amount and the Pres. has even offered to split it and go down the road. So tell me again who is being the two yr old.
@StormyDaniels Uh-huh
@perlmutations Shocker!! I guarantee you don’t even know what she is for or wee she lives. All you know is she hates Trump. Sir that the definition of a dumb ass sheep.
@Acosta And your point is

@SenGillibrand Whoa whoa you said all women need to be heard.  I think you need to change your slogan to all Dem women. If you’re scared to be honest just say so.
@BarackObama The world as it should be in your Eyes which Georgia Florida Ohio just said no again to.
@davidaxelrod @NancyPelosi @BarackObama If Trump had said this people would laugh it off.
@chrislhayes @Nicole_Cliffe Never heard of Lysik
@Acosta You are not that naive.
@KamalaHarris Just not enough to vote for them a raise. Harris voted no for military everytime she had a chance. But takes advantage of the moment like this to maybe get a vote for her. Shows her true character
@brianstelter @JBFlint @keachhagey I bet that’s got to eat at a guy like Stelter that makes a fraction of that.
@ChrisMurphyCT This is laughable
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Oh snap Ted has changed his entire Philosophy. To make a point. This my friends is TDS at its best.
@politico He said the same thing about Hillary and that didn’t go so well.
@perlmutations is a fake biker guy who thinks someone from Georgia might call him in the future for a job so he wants all you guys with no money to join him. This must be the biggest cry baby liner bs I have ever seen. What a pussy.
RT @Rambobiggs: Georgia has a no cucks allowed policy anyways fake biker guy https://t.co/w7l4BjjEqN
@RepAdamSchiff So quid pro quo you help me so I’ll help you that’s what I thought they were trying to get rid of.
@ananavarro She’s white don’t you listen to your colleagues it will be OK.
@MarkDice That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard of but you do say a lot of stupid shit.
@jaketapper You must have amnesia. Sorry it’s probably more like selective amnesia.
@ananavarro With the amount of people we let poor in it’s crazy cheap u can bet on that.
@Acosta The military doesn’t work like @cnn employees they actually care about people especially people in need. I know that you can’t comprehend that but it’s selfless acts of kindness &amp; putting yourself in harms way for others.
@SenGillibrand How can you of all people bring morality into the discussion. That’s like saying we need to put Bernie Sanders ahead of the youth program.
@SenKamalaHarris I guess the senator doesn’t realize the economic boom that’s going on. Employment is at all time low 3.7 % the gdp is 4.2%. Ask anyone Mrs. Harris the numbers don’t lie you can’t give alternative facts when the #s are so good.
@JoyAnnReid She’s white it’s ok.  You know that Joy you talk about it daily. Come on man!!
@Acosta What’s the problem with that?
@KamalaHarris The Senator always camouflages her answers or questions about baby killing this way. I hope it fools less people every time she does it.
@chucktodd You guys will never be happy and I’m so glad they dgaf.
@Acosta That’s such a stupid question and you know it.
@RealCandaceO @LauraBelcher11 Reading your tweets I could fall in love.
@brianstelter @Acosta This will backfire on @cnn I guarantee it. I believe all @Acosta did was give him a easy way to control reporters. If you don’t believe this you are more naive than I thought.
@SarahKSilverman How have you been so quiet on your hero @Avenatti I mean you told us all we must believe women so I know you believe he is a woman abuser. How do u look at yourself after u supported him so strongly. Maybe you’re a two-faced liar. I will hold judgment until u speak out on him.
@jaketapper What a little prick you have become. I don’t know how you can joke when you are behind reruns on the Cartoon Network in the ratings. I believe you need to get your act together. You know you’re not going to always have DT to bash. It’s making you lazy &amp; hurting your reputation.
@StormyDaniels Wtf ever you can’t spell speech. We all know your only talent is fucking people
@JoyAnnReid Racist misogyny white privilege you never have said not once maybe he just won. Did your parents teach you to be a victim maybe you just have been treated that unfairly your entire life. Sad life you must have.
@SenGillibrand I will bet you don’t get anything to the President’s desk that gets signed that he has not pre-approved.
@SarahPalinUSA Why are Dems so naive to same playbook. Election after election
RT @SarahPalinUSA: Muslim Congresswoman Reverses Platform Just Weeks After Election, Now Supports Anti-Israel Agenda https://t.co/9UnufQJsox
@NAHJ @Acosta @CNN @HugoBalta You fools. You gave him the playbook on how to do it legal.
If you ever believed @cnn @ChrisCuomo @donlemon the  caravan is not real &amp; now everyone is telling u the caravan is a huge problem. Give some thought about the last 2 years &amp; how many times these same talking heads lied and I mean to the bone. Russia Avanatti caravan etc.etc.
@donlemon @ChrisCuomo how does it feel to get beat in the ratings by cartoon reruns?
@KamalaHarris How do you know you haven’t been in California for months unless you were Campaigning
@tracygarland @brianstelter Did u not read the letter is actually says the complete opposite. You like so many others listen to BS instead of reading or researching something yourself.
@brianstelter If you believe this is a win for @cnn or @Acosta then you all are in la la land. This is a license to throw people out at will and now courts will have to agree.
@SenGillibrand I bet you believe the grocery store is responsible for you being fat.
@JoyAnnReid Joy is a race baiter from the word go.
@maziehirono @SenBlumenthal @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Waste of time but you do a lot of that Especially when it’s not your money.
@Acosta I don’t believe you completely understand what you have done but you will soon enough.
@KamalaHarris It’s the law if you don’t like it change it or move somewhere you can follow the law.
@JoyAnnReid Joy are you under the Impression that men or women votes are different. If not why bring gender or race into it.
@RealSaavedra This is the only argument they have when the country is running well.  If you don’t vote for who we believe is the right person then you must be racist. It’s not logical thinking
@JoyAnnReid Funny how minorities are not liked by the left if they choose R’s before the name. Joy only wants a certain type of person and if they don’t think like her they are somehow racist.
RT @JoeConchaTV: From the this-is-somebody's-daughter files... https://t.co/6OPprg20km
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He is the POTUS and you are not. Did anyone vote for you. Have you been elected by the people. No I didn’t think so.
@brianstelter Do you know what unemployment is or the amount wages have increased. What about the stock market or 401’s since election. I bet you don’t know how many job killing regulations have been stopped. Oh nobody’s has to pay 100’s because they can’t afford the affordable care act.
@KamalaHarris Wow this chick is unbelievably racist and all she talks about is racism
@cnn @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo @donlemon have all said the caravan is forgotten or it’s not real. I want to know why The mayor of Tijuana Mexico has called it a tsunami with a bunch of bums and criminals in it. I wonder if the executives at @cnn will let them report the truth.

@brianstelter What makes it such nonsense. I bet I know it’s not your opinion and your cult like take on it. Like your astonished someone has a different opinion than you. I believe you are confusing opinion and fact. @cnn has totally gone off the rails.
@chucktodd It’s called love for country. It’s called telling us the NEWS not telling us your opinion about it. I can’t believe how out of touch journalist have become.

@lazcarr1342 @Yeagism @WEKNOWYOURLIES @StormyDaniels @PressSec @SarahHuckabee Nazi’s do you really believe DT or the people who voted for him or support him are nazi’s.

@ChrisCuomo Why do you not have your bromance on every other night anymore. I mean you refuse to say anything about him. I guess you did have a little crush. Please don’t ever say anything about anybody after that complete debacle you grew. You have zero cuckoo roos.

@SenSchumer You are the only one that doesn’t get the picture old man.

@davidaxelrod Only you and Obama did that
@ChrisCuomo just said on his show I don’t hear about a caravan anymore but I have seen on several channels violence and looting in the streets right over the border. I guess because it’s on Mexico side Chris or @cnn don’t give a shit.
@SenKamalaHarris This race baiter has went to far Comparing ICE to the KKK. Please somebody expel this woman from the Senate. She is  radical activist.  She is trying to stir hate and violence. I can’t believe no one on the left has the guts to say something to this radical.
@Ocasio2018 people are saying your first act as Rep Cortez will be to go back on your word of voting against Rep Pelosi. Will you clarify your vote for speaker of the house.
@NancyPelosi @GerryConnolly @realDonaldTrump Nancy is Trumps puppet. He even said he would help her get the votes needed. I really think these young new reps believe they have any power over Nancy. She will have u out of a job next election if they don’t fall in line.

@StormyDaniels Your fans must be so proud

@funder How’s your candidate &amp; wife beater @Avenattti ?
@KamalaHarris How about your running mate wife beater Avenatti. I guess you won’t be praising him any longer. I guess D’s have forgotten all about women.  Avenatti @keithellison supporting wife beaters has become common place.
@AC360 @andersoncooper Kind of like you telling everyone who would listen what a great guy Avenatti was. I mean you basically was selling him to the D’s as a winner. That didn’t age well. Avenatti arrested today for beating his wife. You own your viewers an apology and quick.

@AC360 has to be so proud. The guy pooper told everybody how the guy knew he stuff and would take down DT. I mean AC has a bromance with the dude. Avenatti arrested today for beating his wife. How will @cnn @AC360 spin this one.
@ChrisCuomo BFF Avenatti  you know the guy you said was a powerful player in the Democratic Party very smart and a lot of integrity. I guess you I have no idea wtf you’re talking about. He made you and @cnn look like idiots
@chrislhayes That’s the way your party would like it.

@SethMacFarlane This show sucks about as much as your political beliefs.
@PreetBharara I have seen some people who get fired and hold a grudge but this is getting a little ridiculous.
@ananavarro This shows your complete lack of the law. You can’t make up rules as you go along. I know you believe it’s racist to bring the law into the discussion but it’s the only thing that sets us apart.
@KamalaHarris Why don’t you stick to things you actually know something about like manipulating men for Political gain.
@chrislhayes Stick to politics at least you look the part. No one takes you seriously at politics but hip-hop they only laugh.
@pecriel @GOPChairwoman This is exactly what D’s do. Manipulate numbers and think they’re doing something. This is the biggest pile of bullshit I have ever seen. Let me guess you pulled this from a D website.

@billmaher Maher has went off deep end. All his friends say he doesn’t know how to combat DT he is at a total loss. Also several friends have told others he believes all dems are soft and can never beat Trump and more than half do have TDS.

@LambGonefishin @WEKNOWYOURLIES @StormyDaniels @PressSec That’s creepy dude.
@funder You people need to learn how to lose with some grace and dignity
@Alyssa_Milano you need to get counseling
@ananavarro Sad Dems don’t know how to lose gracefully are with any respect
@ananavarro This will only cost money to The peoyof Florida. Sad Dems just don’t know how to lose.
@funder Statements like this is why you are looked at as a political hack that lies and twist everything left. If you ever want to be anyobut a joke. Wake up grow up and except when you lose.
@SethMacFarlane No female WH staffers were man handled. Everyone needs to know Seth doesn’t believe women unless they are Democrats. This proves how the me too movement is nothing but a political movement.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Axelrod has Officially become part of a anti Trump bashing no matter truth or facts only attack. What a piece of shit. Obama must be proud.
Why is no one talking about RBG in hospital. @cnn @MSNBC @FoxNews
@funder RBG in hospital
@tedlieu RBG in hospital
@brianstelter @Acosta Why is no one talking about RBG in hospital
@brianstelter @Acosta Anyone who Man handles WH female staffers
@Acosta Hey did @cnn put you on the Wrestling beat
@brianstelter Dude wake up. Everyone sees it but you. It’s like that big river Da Nile. How long can you keep lying to the public and blowing shit completely out of proportion and expect people to back you.

@KamalaHarris Thanks for your over reach that gave 4 seats to the good guys. Couldn’t of done it without you honey.
@ananavarro @Acosta @PressSec If POTUS campaign Mgr Cory assaulted the aid in Florida then this was A Assault
@brianstelter He didn’t think he would have a reporter man handling a female aid. Come on man.
@mlcalderone @brianstelter No way. They can send someone else. He a partisan hack that try’s too make it about him.
@phknlwyr @abdallahcnn @Mimirocah1 @CNN @Acosta @pressfreedom Idiot. CIA coronation no doubt. Call name Acosta be accosted.
@Acosta @abdallahcnn @CNN @pressfreedom Are you really trying to say you didn’t touch her. Wow
Outstanding https://t.co/9KWKH1u6DO
@jwgop @Acosta @PeterAlexander U need serious counseling if you believe the so called journalist are handling themselves professionally. I witnessed 5 Diff POTUS press conferences and have never seen someone refuse to give mic up and basically push the female WH staffer back.
@timelyrepairs @RealCandaceO I hear you. It’s nice after all that I didn’t see any riots or college students requesting any grievance counselors no burning cars or big groups of people crying and saying they can’t even go to work. Just something to ponder.
@brhodes @chrislhayes Wow what cave have u been in during BO’s 8 years
@jaketapper @rcpvideo @realDonaldTrump Tapper is so afraid of Zucker he won’t say what he really thinks about anything.
@AlbertoBNAHJ @NAHJ @Acosta @CNN But you didn’t have the balls to call him out for man handling a female WH aid.
@TheView I have heard some stupid shit on this show but joy today takes all time stupidity record with gerrymandering in the Senate is why D’s didn’t win senate.
@funder You have went from desperation to retardation
@rasssalgc @Matta4Congress @Acosta @CNN They all love it they all are making a ton off of the ratings. It’s known they all just want clicks. The press doesn’t give a flying F&amp;&amp;k about America.
@AaronRussom @Matta4Congress @Acosta @CNN For man handling a female WH aid  you must be a tolerant liberal.
@Acosta @Matta4Congress @CNN No one will think independently and say how wrong @Acosta was for man  handling a female white aid. @JeffZuckerCNN would fire them.
@Matta4Congress @Acosta @CNN No one believed anyone at @cnn would stand up to @Acosta for manhandling a female White House aid is naive. @JeffZuckerCNN would fire anyone who thought independently.
@RepAdamSchiff You will bow to Trump like a child to keep a little power.
@funder Well that’s taken care of.
@maddow Nancy will bow to Trump like a wet noodle. If u don’t believe that u r more naive than I thought.
@PreetBharara @chucktodd Who cares what a fired (By Trump) judge believes.
@JoyAnnReid Nancy will bow to Trump like a wet noodle and if you don’t believe that you’re more naive than I thought.
@Acosta You should be out for man handling female WH aide.
@brianstelter He snapped at CNN Acosta not the entire press corps quit lying dude all you talk about his Trump lies but you lie more than anybody.
@MMFlint There is nothing to hide quit beating a dead horse.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Is it not his prerogative?
@cnn has become the joke of media. Someone needs to do something about @Acosta. Everyone else had great questions and had a good time. They want to be a victim and make POTUS out to be the villain.
@JoyAnnReid Lady if you don’t know the last 80 years sitting pres. had picked up 8 seats in 80 years. Last night he picked 4 maybe 5. If that’s not historic I don’t know what is.
@CoryBooker @HeidiHeitkamp You should do way more than apologize you personally cost her and your party her seat plus 3 others on your over reach Spartacus.
@kathygriffin You’re not his type honey. He likes strong independent women not the ones who cry about everything that don’t go there way.
@JoyAnnReid No you liar just try to do your job and report the news instead of trying to make it and be part of it.
@brianstelter Y’all all love him and you know it.
@SarahKSilverman Hilarious another sore loser from the D’s
@funder That’s not what the polling says. @Acosta is getting the ink for man handling a female WH aid.
@CoryBooker @BobMenendezNJ Thank you Booker you gave the good guys at least 4 if not 5 Senate seats for your over reach at Kavanaugh hearings. We thank you no way we could have done it without Spartacus.
@KamalaHarris Thanks for the senate seats you alone provide to the good guys for your actions against Kavanaugh. We could not have done it without u
@brianstelter AMERICAN people have spoken and say media is the problem.
@brianstelter What about your colleague a costing at the White House aid. How about being fair.
@JoyAnnReid Facts hurt. Why don’t you condemn your colleague for accosting White House aid
@billmaher Stfu what a pussy you have become in your old age.
@CNN This shows the true woman Abrams really is. A true D’s don’t know how to lose
@Amy_Siskind Wow so naive.
@CNN I guarantee they will never have the stones to follow through on any of it.
@BreitbartNews This makes D’s look so weak
@chrislhayes The only D’s that flipped seats ran as a Moderate except for a handful. If this doesn’t wake up the D’s nothing will.
@artiequitter Wish you luck Artie. When you are well please come to Texas guarantee sell out.
@tedlieu I wish you could tell Abrams’ to lose with dignity. It’s a much bigger lead in Georgia and she wants a fight. All it will do is cost taxpayers in Ga millions for the inevitable Outcome. If she really cares about Georgia she would Concede with dignity and respect.
@funder All he said was if y’all want too fight that fight I will go hard on the candy paint baby. I hope you guys choose that path if so 2020 is a Trump lock.
@MMFlint No way you can spin this into a victory. D’s spent 300 million in Texas Florida Georgia and lost all 4 races even after Obama ,Oprah Will Ferrell begged for votes y’all lost. R’s May have picked up 5 senate seats. Only 8 in the last 80 years. Winning huge.
@chrislhayes You’re an idiot
@JoyAnnReid I love it this racist pos is claiming moral high ground when she has more racial slurs on tape than David Duke.
@Acosta 8 senate gains in the last 80years last night the POTUS looks like a 5 gain. The is historically huge win to say anything else is partisan BS and that’s what I expect from you. Sad!!!
@tedlieu @HouseJudDems @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump Ted has talked more shit than a Chinese radio about a blue wave now he wants to explain how the historical Senate gains really is a win. Hilarious
@ananavarro @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum Thanks to you Ana Florida stays RED keep up your BS it helps more than you know.
@chrislhayes That’s the law Chris I know you guys hate rule of law but that’s the way we roll.
@SenGillibrand Loser
@cnn @MSNBC Stacey Abrams is sore loser will someone grow a pair and say it. She is down over 100,000 votes and won’t concede All she’s gonna do is cost Georgians a lot of money.
@cnn @MSNBC @FoxNews how can someone be up 3% in one state and not be conceded but other states people r down 1% and you all call it. I guess is called integrity
@KamalaHarris Thanks for the 5 seats you personally helped flip Red. We all thank you especially Texas Georgia and Florida. We couldn’t have done it without u.
@donlemon thanks for all you do to get out the R vote. Florida Georgia and Texas thanks you.
@Reuters D’s are the only people I know lose and call it win.

@yashar The money from these hunts help save several Elephants. If everyone who complained on here would donate to help Conservation we would not have to have hunts. I would like everyone to know they are very strict on animals too shoot they are old and can’t mate any longer.

@portarican_RT @AC360 @drsanjaygupta @CNN And that method shows she may be 1 1024th that’s less than average America. How can you or anyone else defend this lady. I just wish she would apologize and go forward but no she is still defending this monstrosity.
@tommyxtopher She lied she has less Indian DNA than the average American. How can anyone defend her. If you do at least listen to actual Indian people. They say she is an embarrassment to the process
@AC360 @drsanjaygupta How can anyone trust @cnn after they have proven how bias and outright  irresponsible they have become.

@RealJamesWoods Keep that dust pan handy you gonna need it.
@MMFlint How did Obama let this happen to Flint Michael.
@KamalaHarris Wow Senator you have time to be movie critic but totally silent on illegal immigrant killing a young girl that’s a citizen of which you took oath to protect. How many Americans have to be killed by illegals for it to matter to you 1000,10,000 you tell us Senator.
@ananavarro Ana still obsessed with porn stars &amp; criminal lawyers but still silent on a young American girl killed by illegal immigrant. At what point do citizens matter more than your agenda. 1000 killed 10,000 you tell us Ana.
@SenSchumer I wish Chuck would at least acknowledge a illegal immigrant has murdered a American. At what point do dems look out for Americans over illegals. 100 killed 200, 1000, 10000 you tell us Senator.
@tedlieu Ted still silent on illegal immigrant that murdered an American. At what point do dems quit putting illegals ahead of citizens.
@SenWarren you were ask about an illegal immigrant that is charged with murder but you immediately pivot to babies taken from mothers.  At what point do you care about Americans?
@AC360 What about Tibbetts. Do you care a illegal immigrant murdered a young girl?
@brianstelter Do you care about murdered young girls by illegals
@ananavarro Still silent on young murdered girl by illegal immigrant.
@SenSchumer What about illegals murdering young girls Chuck. Do you care?
@NancyPelosi Totally silent on young girl murdered by illegal immigrant. #OpenBorders #crime
@AC360 @JeffreyToobin Pooper cooper totally silent on illegal murdering a young girl Americans are just not important to @CNN and @AC360
@funder @realDonaldTrump This guy filmed that like an hour before it started. What a dumbass
@ananavarro And a illegal murdered an innocent American girl and you say nothing. Sad!!
@RealJamesWoods No doubt. It hilarious that these kind of TDS people sit and do exactly what would get them killed all day on tv and some how live to talk about it. It crazy but calling him Hitler just don’t get the point across anymore now he will kill your parents &amp; grandparents.
@StormyDaniels Nice!!
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Davis who is Omarosa?
@donlemon &amp; @ChrisCuomo actually think they can goat DT into testifying for Mueller. They really believe they can convince people DT is a bad guy. Silly or sad but it’s one.
@ChrisCuomo is on tv trying to convince people that a SC pick is not in American interest. I never thought @cnn would go this far. #scared
@ananavarro @marquesderiscal Totally silent on @keithellison and Ana knows how to bitch and complain that’s her job but I guess you can beat women in If you are a Democrat.

@CNNSitRoom @jimsciutto So the bs @cnn has let these guys spew against the Trump presidency is perfectly fine. @cnn has lost touch with WE THE PEOPLE &amp; believe the President should take away all he can from these partisan hacks spewing hate &amp; lies about him and his ability to run the country.

@KamalaHarris That’s poor decisions and terrible money skills someone made a conscious decision. How  can you blame this on straight white men with micro aggression.
