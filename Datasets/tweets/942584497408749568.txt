You know if Bill Clinton was impeached by the senate although he was impeached by the house, He should have been punished but Bill is the reason our country is divided. But if Bill Had been impeached guess who would have pardoned him and been president......Gore. Think about it https://t.co/PDdPz2bR2V
Time for the @realDonaldTrump impeachment investigation to end. I am sick of this not oly fake news story but an attempt by the left to save their party at the expense of true Americans.

So lets discuss Jesus Christ, he was a jew and I have no problem with Jews. But both are religions. Christanity is a religion. Religion is not a belief in God but instead, a belief in man that died on the cross to make a point. Not that Christ isn't a person to revere but God is. https://t.co/b9tmkN8l1e

So TBS has barred the press from these stupid as comments at this awards so=called show.  This is not comedy, this is not a political statement. This is  a bulling effort on TBS , Samantha Bee by half.  Barring the news media one word....PUTIN. So who is Russia controlling.
Honestly, I am sick of Mueller, McCabe, Comey, and these people who have kissed the Clintons, Bush, and Obamas ass. This investigation needs to end, the  liberals , Progressives,  needs to get the hell out of the way and let this president @realDonaldTrump get job done.Or Fail.
@VoteMarsha I need to know if you are going to attack  Bredesen or Corker. If you place too much pressure on Bredeson you will loose a good chance to attack Corker. Corker might be  a Rino or A Dino in progress. I am saying donot Hit Bredesen to hard , hit Corker.

When the hell is America going to wake up about Comey. His comments are,  Idont know, Idont remember, I don't recall, Its in the book,  They ought to  ask him if he is a leaker and liar, He would say I don't know, Don't recall, Don't remember, . Anything but the truth.
I am not going to call you dems. ..dems anymore you are liberals or progressives. Why the hell don't you get the conformation  process going. Confirm Trumps appointees at deny them. you are hurting the country and  hurting yourself. People see more than you think, better wake up.

Of course the election is about Donald Trump. I have heard all my life" IAM NOT A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN , I VOTE FOR THE MAN". I don't give a hoot in hell what people think. I like his platform because his front porch is stout and I don't feel like I am going to fall through.
@kanyewest I respect you not because you are black and I am white. I respect you because you have awakened and see that you are not a slave to the liberal party.  They left you  didn't leave them.  If your friends leave you over 7 words. They weren't friends in the first place.

I once considered myself a Dem but after a few years I found out I was a rep. Why? The Dems say they are for the little man, been poor all my life and Dems are bordering on the edge of communism. I have never seen a poor man hire anyone. We are a Republic, not a Dem.

I have no problem with paroled felons voting, once they have repaid the system for their court cost, housing, food, medical and all monies they have cost the tax payer for their crimes. ALL MONIES FROM THE DAY THEY WERE ARRESTED TO THE DAY THEY WERE RELEASED.  EVERY DIME.

Personally I think  slavery was the worse legacy that the Founding Fathers left the American us as a country. And this was not only the south but north and all that followed.  SO STAY THE HELL OF THE SOUTHERNERS BACK. THE NORTH HAD THEIR SHARE OF SLAVES. WAKE UP.
When it comes to slavery......Africa started it with the Hebrews. The only reason I bring this to daylight is when slavery is mentioned, THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT ARE MENTIONED IS THE USA, WHICH IS ALSO THE SAME COUNTRY THAT STOPPED IT. LOSING 700,000 AND ALSO A REPUBLICAN STOPPED IT
My grandmother told me that  boys wore dresses.  I talked to a local  store owner, years ago and he told me that it was true, he wore a dress until he was 8. Then one day he reached for the biscuits and drug his pecker in the gravy. His daddy said it time for pants.
I have no problem with the gay and lesbian community. my son is gay. I had 2 choices throw him away or support him, well I was not about to throw my son away.  So he had my support and still does. I think Comey is gay but is staying in the closet. So he lies to himself.
Comey is probably getting his 15  minutes of fame, he will also get a lifetime of shams along with the FBI and those who are hiding his bullshit.
If Africa had not sold their own people into slavery we would not have this damn slavery thing hanging over our heads. When we tried to do the same to American Natives, well hell the fight was on. Africa started slavery not US.
