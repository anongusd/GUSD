That’s why I signed on to the Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act, which extends key VA benefits to these veterans. Let us uphold our solemn promise to care for our country’s veterans as they have cared for us. Read more here: https://t.co/OD4hFyCYNi
In the 1970s, American servicemembers cleaned up nuclear test sites on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands – exposing themselves to harmful radiation. They deserve healthcare benefits that match their arduous work in the line of duty.
Congratulations to mushers Martin Massicotte, Rico Portalatin, and Daniel Coutu for their wins in the 250 mile, 100 mile, and 30 mile races respectively. And congratulations to all the athletes and their teams for a tough, hard fought competition. https://t.co/mg5kBKH9tO
The Can-Am Crown Sled Dog Race in Fort Kent is a wonderful celebration of community and culture. Whether you are from the County, are headed up for a weekend of snowmobiling, or are traveling from across the country to compete in the race, it is truly a sight to see. https://t.co/du04Rpwvat
Last week, I cosponsored the DRIVE Safe Act to address a nationwide shortage of truck drivers by creating an apprenticeship program which allows young people to get a jumpstart on their careers, and helps them be safer drivers while doing it. READ MORE: https://t.co/eNxJdo9Wbk
Restricting flavored e-cigarettes is a step in the right direction from this administration as we work to improve public health and discourage young people from vaping. https://t.co/xZXwlsDrQp
Without @DHSgov raising the H-2B visa cap to allow for additional workers, Maine’s seasonal businesses will struggle to meet the demand for services in the summer. That’s why I joined with @SenatorCollins and bipartisan colleagues to urge @SecNielsen to raise the visa cap. https://t.co/om9UQ65zs1
A good day at the Maine Fishermen’s Forum with folks from all over the state (along with a few from across the nation!) and a wonderful opportunity to dig into the issues and opportunities within one of Maine’s iconic industries. https://t.co/HaZmZdnbNS
The States Achieve Medicaid Expansion (SAME) Act will ensure that Maine has access to the SAME benefits it would have received had it expanded in 2014 – it’s commonsense and will create more affordable coverage for over 70,000 Maine people. READ MORE: https://t.co/ZniYiDeAeD
Maine people have made it clear: they want Medicaid expansion. While Maine’s government processes this at the state level, I've cosponsored a bill to keep fighting to ensure Maine receives the same federal benefits it would have received if our state expanded Medicaid earlier.
Our rural communities rely on the economic contributions of Maine’s potato growers – more than $150 million in 2017. That’s why this month I joined colleagues to send a letter urging that the U.S. potato industry be a priority in trade talks with China. https://t.co/rwcWNK3yHf
Potatoes aren’t just a major economic driver for the County– they’re a tradition. Just ask Curtis Harrison, the Maine Potato Board’s 2019 Young Farmer of the Year and a 4th generation potato grower! A pleasure to see Curtis and others from the Maine Potato Board in DC this week. https://t.co/bkZLyRByuh
It was great to sit down with @samanthayorkME to discuss this vital subject, and wonderful to see so many other Maine people raising their voices in this story as well. I’ll keep pushing in Congress to expand broadband access to rural Maine people.
From economic growth to educational opportunities to access to healthcare, so much of modern life relies on reliable, high-speed access to the internet. In order for rural Maine communities to thrive, we need to make sure they have access this infrastructure.
In rural Maine, the lack of high-speed broadband isn’t just an annoyance – it’s a serious obstacle to economic growth. On last night’s @NEWSCENTERMAINE, I joined many Maine voices to emphasize the importance of this 21st century tool to Maine’s future. https://t.co/TpVgfxqaI3
More than 30 years ago, former Senator George Mitchell – my predecessor – spoke in a committee hearing to urge action on climate change. In the three decades since, his words have gone unheeded, and his threats more serious than ever. I read his statement on the floor today: https://t.co/NrJnbyc3zl
I'm heading to the Senate floor soon to echo my predecessor, former Senator George Mitchell, in his call for action on climate change. You can watch live on my Facebook page: https://t.co/OIYWIHOI3G
The 🦞 industry is a vital part of Maine’s economy, and a central part of life for coastal communities. Our state can’t afford to let this economic driver become collateral damage in trade talks. I’ll keep fighting alongside my colleagues to defend this iconic Maine industry.
Maine's lobster industry did not ask for this trade war, but it is suffering the consequences as Chinese tariffs have limited access to a vital market for American lobsters. I joined the Maine delegation to urge @USTradeRep to push to remove these tariffs during negotiations. https://t.co/7i0mYIJWnx
We can, and should, pass commonsense legislation to make sure drug companies aren’t increasing profits at the expense of public health. That’s why I’ve cosponsored three bills to remove unneeded tax breaks and reduce costs. Read more:  https://t.co/V1O9T6uX6G
With drug costs so high, Maine people working with limited budgets – particularly seniors – are being forced to make unthinkable choices; for example: the choice between missing a dose of medicine, or skipping meals. It doesn’t have to be this way.
Today, my colleagues who serve on @SenateFinance made it clear to pharmaceutical industry leaders: Americans of all ages and backgrounds are struggling with the cost of prescription drugs, and they need real relief. 		I couldn’t agree with them more. https://t.co/JEJogHQdI9
I met with leaders from Maine’s American Legion yesterday to discuss ways we can increase access to mental healthcare for our veterans, ongoing efforts to improve services at Togus, and to thank them for their lifetime of service to our nation and to the veterans community.

In our conversation, we identified obstacles disabled veterans face and looked for new opportunities to make sure they have access to the resources they need. We’re all so grateful for their service and their continued activism on behalf of veterans.
America’s disabled veterans, some of whom carry their sacrifice with them in daily life, deserve nothing less than our complete gratitude and total support. Yesterday, I met with members of the Disabled American Veterans of Maine to express that sentiment. https://t.co/yi3qNGKqGA

If hackers take down our electric grid, it wouldn’t just be a matter of lights going off in your home: financial systems, hospitals, and more would all go down. It would be a matter of life and death — we need to prepare before an attack, not react after it happens.
Our electric grid literally powers American life — but the underlying infrastructure has vulnerabilities, and we’ve already seen foreign actors hack into these systems. That’s why I’ve introduced a bill to restore some manual features to the grid and protect our infrastructure. https://t.co/JVhgJ3Odmy
If the President were to remove DNI Coats, it would send a message to the entire Intelligence Community that our Commander-in-Chief is not interested in hearing the facts – which would lead to bad intelligence and disastrous policy decisions. It shouldn’t happen.
The Intelligence Community is tasked with delivering the most insightful intelligence possible, and DNI Coats has fulfilled his duty. It would be a mistake for the President to fire him for clearly and forcefully describing national security threats. https://t.co/Bm6uiB55aU
These are two serious challenges facing our state, and through this legislation, we’ve come together in a bipartisan way to find a solution that works for everyone. This is a win-win for our students and our businesses – it’s just commonsense.
Maine college graduates are struggling with student loan debt, and Maine companies are searching for new ways to attract and retain talent – so I’ve cosponsored a bill to allow employers to contribute tax-free money toward their employees’ student loans. https://t.co/IKhzw1KcST
I’ll be on next with @NewDay — tune in!
“...The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.”
President Lincoln is one of my personal heroes, and on #PresidentsDay — on most days, in fact, — I turn to his words for wisdom and guidance. In an address to Congress amidst the Civil War, Lincoln said: “The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present...”
These critical projects for roads, picnic areas and visitor centers are essential to ensure safe visitor experiences and allow future generations to experience the wonders of our National Parks — from Acadia to Zion — for years to come.

This is antithetical to our American system of government, and I hope and expect that any move by the President to circumvent Congress will be quickly challenged in court.
The President's plan to declare a ‘national emergency’ to fund his border wall even as his own DHS says that illegal border crossings are declining is not what the Framers of the Constitution intended when they explicitly assigned spending powers to Congress, not the executive.
The leadership displayed by classmates of the victims and students from across the country has proven over and over again that you don’t need to be an elected official to make a difference. There's more work to do, but they've already made a difference. #MSDStrong

This legislation also permanently reauthorizes the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission, which plays an important role in dialogues between the Park and the surrounding communities. Through these important actions, we can ensure that NPS will continue to be a good neighbor.

I want to be very clear: I support increased border security, and I think there’s a solution to be had that works for the President, Congress, and the American people. But we can’t have this discussion with a shutdown hanging over our head. To start, let's open the government. https://t.co/XxCn7cJaCh
To these local banks, credit unions, and all others who’ve stepped up to help the workers who are hurting: thank you. You are the reason that Maine is such a special place to live. And I’ll keep working to make your spirit a little more common in Washington.

That provision is one of the important steps we can take to help fight back and protect our most vulnerable, but we can't stop there. I spoke with the folks at @PineTreeWatchME about this bill, and how to combat the opioid crisis in Maine’s communities: https://t.co/xiFOGK7wLw
Thankfully, help is on the way. The Senate passed bipartisan opioid legislation in October with provisions like the CRIB Act – which I introduced – to allow Medicaid to cover babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome in pediatric recovery centers.
The opioid epidemic spares no one, not even our newborns. There are hospitals in rural Maine where 10, 12 or 15 percent of the babies were born with addicted to opioids – an absolutely heartbreaking statistic that must be addressed.
Another example of this government shutdown hurting Maine people – this time, our state’s disabled community. This needs to end – let’s reopen the government. https://t.co/J5CGQAcpRb

Last month, the Senate passed my resolution honoring the 75th anniversary of the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps. During WWII, the Cadet Nurse Corps was essential to the health &amp; well-being of servicemembers &amp; American citizens at home &amp; abroad. Proud to recognize their service. https://t.co/tpoLeP0X5G
Congress has six bipartisan appropriations bills that we can pass to reopen nearly all of the affected government agencies, and we can pass a short-term CR to allow DHS to function during negotiations. Let’s pass them, and let federal employees get back to work for Maine people.
And it’s not just businesses – Calais resident Ashley Hinson lost out on a home purchase because the shutdown prevented her loan paperwork from being finalized by the Department of Agriculture. https://t.co/1eaQrBByCq
Every day this partial shutdown continues, Maine people are being hurt. In Hancock, the Sullivan Harbor Farm has been forced to remain closed while awaiting final FDA approval – meaning that the business’s employees can’t collect a paycheck: https://t.co/w1rYc5GAb0

Over these next six years I’ll do exactly that by working every single day to expand on the good work that Maine people are doing for our state, and to build consensus so we can find real solutions to national challenges. #mepolitics
Maine people want their elected officials to come together and find solutions on the issues we all face, from ensuring access to healthcare to stemming the opioid epidemic to creating new economic opportunities. #mepolitics
Washington’s actions need to reflect Maine’s priorities – but as the ongoing shutdown shows, far too often our leaders miss the mark. #mepolitics
Six years ago, the people of Maine placed their faith in me to go to the Senate and try to make their lives better; today, I’m humbled by the trust they’ve given me to continue the work we started together. #mepolitics

This bill is an important step in the right direction, it’s bipartisan, and it’s commonsense – and hopefully, it will become law very soon. To learn more about the #BSG bill, read here: https://t.co/UMdGjbElQs
Sometimes complex problems have simple answers, and that’s what this bill does. By simplifying and isolating critical pieces of infrastructure that help run our grid, economy, health care system and more, we can defend against crippling attacks.
For years, bad actors have been testing American systems for weaknesses, and over time their incursions have grown more sophisticated and more threatening. But even as the danger becomes more clear, our government response has been lacking.
Major progress to protect America’s national security overnight! Last night, the Senate passed the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act, my bill with @SenatorRisch that will help reduce digital vulnerabilities in our energy grid and protect our vital infrastructure from hackers.
That’s why I’ve joined with @SenRobPortman, @SenAlexander, and @MarkWarner to introduce the Restore Our Parks Act, which would address the maintenance backlog in a fiscally responsible way. It’s bipartisan, and it’s necessary– so let’s pass it.
Our national parks reflect the national promise we’ve made to our children and grandchildren: to protect and maintain this world so that future generations may enjoy its beauty. Unfortunately, we have a lot of work to do if we’re going to live up to our responsibility. https://t.co/sXk7PdQPgu
Our criminal justice system isn’t working; not for those who spend decades in prison for nonviolent offenses, not for law enforcement officers, and not for taxpayers. We can create a better criminal justice system for all Americans, and last night we took the first step.
Bipartisanship on display last night – by a vote of 87-12, the Senate overwhelmingly passed long-needed reforms to our criminal justice system that will make communities safer, prepare inmates to be productive members of society, and save taxpayer money. https://t.co/BFK1iJJzE8

Rural Maine people need the internet just as much as anyone else – to pursue economic opportunities, further their education, and connect with their friends and loved ones. I’ll keep working to make sure we take every step possible to close the digital divide.
High-speed internet isn’t a luxury – it’s an important tool for Maine’s farmers, and a necessity for rural communities looking to grow economically. That’s why I pushed to include legislation helping to expand rural broadband in this year's Farm Bill. https://t.co/AHozpux8bh

In recent months I’ve joined bipartisan groups of Senators to send two letters urging the FCC to ensure the map of eligible areas for MF II accurately reflects the needs of communities, and I’ll keep pushing to make sure Maine communities have the opportunity to receive funding.

I reiterate the call for all parties to seek a diplomatic solution to resolve this political and humanitarian crisis.
The United States should not be complicit in this tragedy – that’s why I voted in March to end our limited support for the Saudi-led coalition, and why I voted the same way today.

A slow internet connection isn’t a minor annoyance – it’s a challenge to a region’s growth. With high-speed broadband’s growing importance, it’s essential that rural Maine communities can improve their broadband infrastructure to create new economic and educational opportunities.
Great news for communities around Maine! Three rural regions – Millinocket, Windham and the Blue Hill Peninsula – will join @Neighborly to expand their broadband efforts and help Maine people access affordable, high-speed internet.

We have a bipartisan bill that could be brought to the floor this afternoon to allow Director Special Counsel Mueller to finish his investigation, so let’s do it. I just don’t understand what the delay is.
On @NewDay this morning, I talked about the importance of protecting the Mueller investigation – particularly in light of the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the Acting Attorney General, who may try to limit the scope of, or cut the funding for, Special Counsel Mueller’s work. https://t.co/mBGNHdm5Fo

This would be a step in the wrong direction: it would hurt communities across Maine and seriously harm local efforts to help people enter recovery. We need to support people with substance use disorders, not abandon them.
Maine people struggling with substance use disorders can heal through treatment – but if the ACA’s protections for pre-existing conditions are lost, insurance companies will be able to prevent them from accessing care. https://t.co/L7egW0n7DR

There’s still a lot of work to be done, but today, we made some very positive steps, on a bipartisan basis, to help build a better world to leave for future generations. This is how it’s supposed to work.
Both of these bipartisan efforts will make sure we leave our public lands in pristine condition for our children, just as our parents did for us. These efforts may not break through some of the political noise, but that doesn’t make the work any less important.
The Restore Our Parks Act is a big victory, but it isn't the only win today! We also advanced permanent reauthorization and full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. LWCF has protected public lands for more than 50 years – and now, it can do so for years to come.
I saw the effects of these delays firsthand last month while visiting with Acadia the Acting Director of the NPS, and while the views are as pretty as ever, the situation behind the scenes is not so picturesque – plain and simple, the park needs funding. https://t.co/K2RI47fesl
This legislation is supported by both the administration and conservation groups like @pewtrusts and @NPCA, and would have a significant impact on parks like @AcadiaNPS, which currently faces a maintenance backlog of nearly $60 million.

That’s why I’ve introduce the Restore Our Parks Act with @senrobportman, @MarkWarner and @SenAlexander. Our bipartisan bill would drastically cut this backlog and make sure that we can fulfill our promise to leave behind these beautiful lands for future generations of Americans.
Acadia has a maintenance backlog of $60 million, and it’s not alone – national parks across the country have fallen behind on maintenance to the tune of $12 billion nationwide. This is unacceptable.
There’s never a bad time to be in @AcadiaNPS – especially not when you’re with the Acting Director of the @NatlParkService (by the way, a Maine native) to highlight the important maintenance work our state’s natural treasure needs to continue operating. https://t.co/8BTG1jYx7V

We need all hands on deck to end this scourge on our communities, help those struggling with addiction enter recovery, and finally stem this terrible pain that is being felt by families and communities throughout Maine; today shows how many people are working toward that goal.

Our public schools have real, concrete needs: textbooks, supplies, and more. This policy would take money away from these important priorities, and make our schools less safe in the process – it’s a lose-lose, and we shouldn’t do it.

The idea that the Administration would reverse its policy of family separation to show "compassion" but not attempt to return the 2000+ children who have already been taken makes no sense. These kids still need their parents, and should be reunited with them immediately.
This move is overdue but far from a long-term fix. I’ve heard from thousands of Maine people on this subject and I know that, we as a Nation, can find a way to both protect our border and protect children and families seeking asylum.
I’m glad that the President finally recognized two important facts about his family separation policy: first, this crisis was unnecessary and he has the power to correct it on his own; second, separating children from their parents is incongruent with American values.
These kids are not bargaining chips – they are kids. And they should be with their parents. Mr. President: make the call, and end this policy. https://t.co/Sfnb5HG6yX

If you or someone you know is suffering, know that you are not alone. To get help, call the National Suicide Hotline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or text TALK to 741741. 		You are a valuable member of our state and our society – please, stay with us another day and let us try to help.
The biggest message these advocates shared is the importance of destigmatizing suicide by facilitating safe and open conversation about risk factors and statistics. Suicide victims are our family members, friends, and neighbors – and they need our help.
Today, I met with Maine representatives of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (@afspnational) to discuss life-saving solutions – because, with suicide rates in Maine up 27.4% in the last 20 years, there is much work to be done to improve access to mental health care.
Suicide has recently been at the forefront of national discussions. But this isn’t a new problem – it’s ongoing, and it’s claiming lives of Maine people while leaving behind devastated families and communities unsure about how to prevent tragedies like this in the future.
“This is a special industry. We are not talking about washing machines here or plastic toys. We are talking about the only business that has its own line in the Constitution.” 	 	A strong editorial in the @BostonGlobe in support of my + @SenatorCollins’s PRINT Act. https://t.co/ZzRAtsBYHr
Consumers need to know what they’re buying – and in the case of maple and honey products, they’re buying pure, single ingredient foods. The FDA should make sure that is clear.
This product is all-natural, but a new FDA proposal might confuse consumers into thinking there are additives. That’s why I joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of my colleagues to urge the FDA to exempt maple and honey producers from nutrition labels claiming “added sugar.” https://t.co/ZcEUBsnA30
Yesterday, I visited the Hampden farm of Peter Cowin, sometimes known as the “Bee Whisperer.” Peter demonstrated the process of producing honey from start to finish, and I can say this: this is pure honey, with no sugar added. https://t.co/XLlim7Ma58
Downeast Treatment Center in Ellsworth is an example how for community-based, medication-assisted treatment efforts can support Maine people struggling with substance use. Grateful for their time today and their important work in our communities. https://t.co/IDVcUiykWS

Earlier today, I signed a letter urging the Administration to end its policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. We need to live by our national values at all times; this practice falls far short of those principles.

His contributions, in the County and across our state, will not be forgotten, and our prayers are with his family during this difficult time.

This bill, which had previously passed the House under @RepPoliquin's leadership, will now head to the President’s desk for his signature. I’m excited that Old Town now has the flexibility it needs to create additional economic opportunities.

Lincoln was born 209 years ago today – and more than two centuries later, his words live on, and for good reason. A giant in our history, Abraham Lincoln’s contributions to our nation are incalculable and continue to light our country’s path.
“The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.” – Abraham Lincoln
Today’s discussion underscored one key need in these communities – more funding.

This is important – not only do parents have more flexibility to care for newborns, but the move also helps the company retain their employees. I commend Avesta for taking this step, and will keep working in the Senate to broaden access to paid medical and family leave. #FMLA25
On the FMLA’s 25th anniversary, it’s important to reflect upon both the good the law has done and how much more we have left to accomplish. I did just that this morning with leaders of @AvestaHousing in Portland, who recently implemented a paid parental leave policy. #FMLA25 https://t.co/Um4s5y6d5H
For 25 years, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped protect workers– but there is still more to do. #PaidLeaveMeans workers don’t have to choose between making an honest living or caring for their family, which is why I support the FAMILY Act. #FMLA25 https://t.co/OIJTpJblup
I will take my cue from these devoted public servants, and focus my efforts on the bipartisan investigation taking place in the Senate Intelligence Committee.
What is clear, however, is that this is an obvious attempt to discredit the work of the men and women at the FBI, whose association reminded us just today that they will continue to do their work to protect America regardless of distractions and partisan politics.
It is nearly impossible to make a judgment based on a document so clearly partisan, and one that attempts to boil down the extensive information required for FISA applications and renewals into just over three pages.
Through decades in business, public service, and law, I’ve learned over and over again that there are at least two sides to every story, which must be closely considered in uncovering the facts. This memo tells only one side of the story – and a limited version at that.

So, as we honor him today, let us take the opportunity to follow Dr. King’s legacy and serve – serve our friends and our neighbors, our communities and our country, as we continue to march toward the fulfillment of that radical new dream. #MLKDay
Dr. King’s speech guaranteed that his dream, so deeply rooted in the American Dream, is now and forever embedded in the fabric of our nation. #MLKDay
I had climbed a tree on the National Mall to watch the speech, and from that tree I saw Dr. King light a new path forward for our country with his eloquence, his passion and his conscience. #MLKDay

So many of our key industries, from tourism and recreation to fishing, rely on healthy oceans. A single mistake could change that forever, rob our state of a key resource and permanently harm people across Maine. The risk of a catastrophe far outweighs any benefits. #mepolitics

We could have done this bill on a bipartisan basis, and in a way that allowed the American people to make their voice heard. Instead, we passed this. The Senate owes our country better.
This is why hearings matter. This is why input from experts matter. This is why process matters.

I’ll continue to say clearly, and loudly, that our rural hospitals need our help…
So, when I go back to Washington next week to discuss healthcare, I’ll carry the concerns and challenges of Jackman/rural Maine with me.
This impacts everything – a CBP officer told me today they struggle to recruit/keep border patrol personnel due to limited healthcare.
That means that the a mill worker on the late shift, or an elderly citizen who slips and falls, would have to drive over an hour for care.
At the moment, Jackman stands to lose overnight emergency medical services at the end of the year.
Communities need access to close and affordable healthcare in order to thrive.
THREAD: Spent the day talking healthcare in Jackman today. There was one thought that was present in all of my conversations:
Cybercrime costs the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year – it’s critical that we protect our networks.
Concerned to hear SEC's database was breached. This is another example of why we need strong cyber defenses.
Jackman is one of many towns with these challenges – they need bipartisan help. Look forward to hearing more tomorrow. (3/3)
Jackman could lose overnight emergency/ambulance care at the end of 2017, forcing residents to drive more than an hour for care. (2/3)

It is inconsistent with who we are as a country.
They only isolate America frm our allies, marginalize US Muslim population who are often the source for info that helps prevent terrorism.

… cut federal red tape, defend affordable &amp; accessible health care, &amp; promote economic growth &amp; job creation, particularly in rural Maine.
In the Senate, I will continue to fight for Maine’s interests – to expand access to broadband, combat the opioid crisis…
As President Trump begins his new Administration, I wish him the best, because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds.
Today, we witnessed a hallmark of American democracy: the peaceful transition of power from one Administration to the next.

Let’s deal with this terrible problem that is taking lives, tearing families apart, and deeply wounding the heart of America.
In March, the Senate passed CARA  – the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Unfortunately, at the same time, we didn’t fund it
These are real people. These are regular, ordinary Americans that are being affected by the drug epidemic.
Since we passed CARA and failed to fund it, 15,000 people have died – 78 a day, 3 an hour -- because we haven’t acted on funding
I’ve sent a letter to @POTUS &amp; Senate Appropriations leaders calling for funds to fight drug epidemic: https://t.co/vPL8acc5Rf
