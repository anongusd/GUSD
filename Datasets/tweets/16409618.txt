RT @TheAtlPolitics: Deval Patrick spoke at Mother Emanuel on Sunday. Here's what he said, writes @isaacdovere:	https://t.co/PkmPAiCvB7
In these unthinkably dark moments for our community -- this, and countless moments and acts like it that occur every single day, represent the goodness and the light I want the world to see as our community grieves.  Less fear. More empathy.
We hastily arranged a press conference the next morning with faith leaders -- and one of the first to volunteer was Rabbi Hamilton. Watching him speak up for my values, alongside muslim and christian clergy filled me with almost indescribable pride and no shortage of tears.
Context: during the Obama administration, the presence of unaccompanied minors was increasing at the border, and a call was put out to states that would be willing to take them in. For @DevalPatrick, it was never a question we would despite no small amount of outrage against it.
I find solace today lifting up voices in my community that speak life to the words that the Pittsburgh shooter sought to stamp out. Here's one example: Rabbi Hamilton of @KehilathIsrael in 2014 speaking out with @DevalPatrick for MA to take in unaccompanied minors seeking refuge. https://t.co/q5OG5Plhnm
