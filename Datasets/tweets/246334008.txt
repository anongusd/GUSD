@NoraReed @Jeff4thetruth @sarahjeong You are literally judging an entire group of people with vastly different views only by their skin colour. You are the dictionary definition of a racist. (By the way, reverse racism is really counterproductive, can't we just stop saying stuff like this?)
@NYTimesPR Would NYT have done the same if it was a white supremacist they were hiring?

@cbrower2141 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The answer is no, in theory all Americans are free, but in practice most are merely a miniscule part of the Capitalist system, who are paid just enough to afford their survival and hope to pile up enough money so that they can retire and die with enough $ left to their children.
@cbrower2141 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Liberty to do whatever you want without infringing on others‚Äô rights, right? In that pedestal, though, are all American citizens free? Would someone born in the ghetto who works twice as hard as the son of a CEO be even remotely close to having the same amount of liberty?
@cbrower2141 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Still, today, in the US, the wealthy have it easier on many areas where one‚Äôs bank account shouldn‚Äôt be a factor. Education and healthcare are overused exapmles, I know, but they‚Äôre still relevant in being more accessible the more $ you have.
@cbrower2141 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Some people are born with way more opportunities than others, allowing them to succeed in the SAT, find a good job etc. while many are unable to escape the captivity of the working class due to vastly unequal starting points that couldn‚Äôt possibly be their fault.
@irishdodger @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Thanks. In retrospect, maybe I should‚Äôve not used the word ‚Äútrue‚Äù, makes it sound utopian. It is true that greed and selfishness exist, however the ruling class could still be made less powerful with restrictions on ridiculous earnings and the distribution of power.

@Cory_Thunder @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 It‚Äôs easier to point to the ‚Äúopression‚Äù in DemSocialism (where the only opression is your right of exploitation being taken away) than it is to point at the billions being opressed under Capitalism simply because they weren‚Äôt born to a wealthy family in a priviledged nation.
@CarterDeKeyser @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Despite there being a few DS parties, they were merely operating within &amp; trying to reform Capitalist systems.

@cbrower2141 @AminoWarden @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, you‚Äôre lying. Even when all taxes are added and the most liberal estimates considered, the average doesn‚Äôt exceed 42.5% (the highest figure I could find.) https://t.co/bndR0kCHsE
@AminoWarden @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I found no mention of the government claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äúagainst human rights‚Äù. They did allow private healthcare, but that doesn‚Äôt disprove that Canadians on average have much better healthcare for none of the cost. Saying that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfailing tremendously‚Äù makes you sound like Trump.
@AminoWarden @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 It‚Äôs absurd how you were decieved to believe most people who pursue their dream hard enough can get it. Also shocking is how you‚Äôre still resorting to the Venezuela argument. It‚Äôs State Capitalism, where few extremely wealthy individuals exist and no democracy is in place.
@UnleashTh3CASEY @realbacongains You‚Äôve contributed nothing to that business which has been successful only because the workers that work for you (who usually have no other choice to feed their family) made it to be. It‚Äôs also questionable how you aquired your ‚Äúpersonal money‚Äù.
@mike_pish @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 What do you mean? Doesn‚Äôt that show a great achievement on her side?
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Also, why would you attribute all achievements of humanity that were realized in a time period where Capitalism was the dominant political system in the world to said system?
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 And basic economic theory tells us that pure capitalism would be an absolute disaster, due to r&gt;g, the free market‚Äôs inability to handle a lot of types of goods (merit, public, common), boom and bust cycles... I‚Äôm kind of repeating myself here.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Again, this stuff is based on a lot of factors, some tax cuts (which, in theory should increase the economy) may‚Äôve not been as effective as anticipated. https://t.co/j2BK2ku20s https://t.co/2CvcbOBCEl
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 There‚Äôs no ‚Äújump start‚Äù when we look at the data (which isn‚Äôt an easy thing to measure.) It seems like you‚Äôre speaking from personal experience (which I‚Äôll admit I lack) but I haven‚Äôt seen detrimental data to support your claims. https://t.co/0trKhTk9f2
@UnleashTh3CASEY @realbacongains ‚ÄúTaking a risk‚Äù is another way of saying supplying the funds for an operation. If all you did was to allow an operation which would‚Äôve otherwise been possible had the workers not been born into poverty and their needs were met, what‚Äôve you contributed?
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I myself am well off, and it‚Äôs not a matter of personal gain. I see the inequality and unfairness in the salaries of workers and administrators and think that‚Äôs a more just way of doing it.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Plus, no president is singlehandedly responsible for ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the economy. A lot of factors play into that.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, economy expansion under Trump and Obama have been in par. Trump did retain it, but has he really done much to improve it? Are the ‚Äújobs he saved‚Äù notable enough to account for that? You claim it doesn‚Äôt grow an economy, but data says otherwise.
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 There are a bunch of thriving credit unions out there, owned jointly by thousands of their workers. The idea is not to have anarchy within the company, but democracy, to make the voices of everyone in it heard. Sounds utopian to you, maybe, but they do exist in a lot of places.
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I never explicitly said that I support equal wages for all. A fair distribution would be giving wages &gt;&gt;proportional&lt;&lt; to one‚Äôs work output. An overseer would get more than a single worker, but not at the drastic rate that doesn‚Äôt reflect the work output of said individuals.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 If you‚Äôre talking about Trump, remember that the economy was well into recovery at the end of Obama‚Äôs second term. The trend didn‚Äôt change in Trump‚Äôs term since it was established by the Obama Administration.
@yggdrasil555 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, then; could you explain why European nations with even more regulations have vastly superior healthcare systems? Why is the US system, where people can‚Äôt take ambulances bc they can‚Äôt afford them and where regulation is the lowest among developed countries, such a shitshow?
@Sporkloin @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Of course, it‚Äôs challenging to educate an entire generation about a complex economic system, but per my observations it is the vast majority of people who don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre supporting or why. Based on that, most political standpoints would be illegitimate, right?
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Absolutely not, my first sentence recognises the importance of management. What I was saying was that their salaries are more often than not disproportionate to their contributions, and that a co-operative corporate structure is fairer and more beneficial for all.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, yes, governmental monopolies pose threats as well. As I‚Äôve mentioned previously, some market forces are allowable to balance certain industries. I was merely pointing to instances when the private sector wasn‚Äôt sufficient on its own to deliver services to those in need.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I do agree with the second statement, but what do you mean by a ‚Äúconsumer mindset‚Äù?
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 And why would a charity do that? Out of ‚Äúgood will‚Äù? A lot of charities are found to be for-profit scams (especially the religious ones), and even if they‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs too much to expect from people with no return (the return you seem to be valueing so much.)
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, I do agree that the role of mgmt shouldn‚Äôt be disregarded wholly, but the current system awards a disproportionate amount in salaries to high-rank admimistrators. A balance can be established (and, hear me out, without authoritarianism) and already has. It‚Äôs called co-ops.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The USPS delivered to areas where FedEx didn‚Äôt. They weren‚Äôt profitable, but needed for small communities. Same with transportation; some small towns are only serviced by unprofitable Amtrak trains, who profits from the DC-Boston route and redistribute that within the company.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The free market awards the most profitable business practice, and that‚Äôs often not the one which offers affordable goods to poor people. We have incredible amounts of food being wasted, and incredible amounts of people starving. I wonder what kind of mechanism would solve that...
@loondale @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I have other charts if you want. Welfare is intended to raise the poor out of poverty, but since Capitalism itself is broken, Welfare also has its flaws. Here‚Äôs an income mobility chart, showing that the poor, even if they work hard, cannot meaningfully increase their income: https://t.co/EksXuA7BNd
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 By your definition, wouldn‚Äôt taxation also require authoritarianism?
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 It was Bolshevik policy to murder the entire Royal family. Stalin, one of the top revolutionaries alongside Lenin, planned treason all along. Once he got absolute power in an Authoritarian regime, nobody stopped him from commiting the Holodomor and the atrocities in the Gulags.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Capitalism thus provides the illusion of opportunities and freedom, tries to mask the reality of the vast amounts of people tricked by the system by glorifying the small amounts of successful people, and opresses those who oppose the system.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The right to access healthcare is reflective of all functions of Capitalism, actually. Poor people are technically allowed to earn money, but everything in the system obstructs that to realistically happen. Americans are technically allowed to pursue their dream, but most fail.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Trying to defend the ‚Äúsmall business owner‚Äù while simultaneously ignoring the millions of hard-working Americans born into poverty who cannot get out of it due to basic functions of Capitalism who aren‚Äôt able to go to the doctor when their child gets sick?
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Private charity is the answer? What happens when charity output is inferior to fiscal demand due to ridiculous drug and healthcare prices? Should a semi-arbitary measure decide on wheter a person is treated or not?
@AechErvin @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 So Universal Basic Income? Wouldn‚Äôt the free marketeers argue that the intellectual rights and labour rights of an AI belong to those who created it?
@Larrypolya22 @realbacongains @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 When some people are born into wealth and have done nothing for it, and some are born into poverty, is it right to defend the ‚Äúrights‚Äù of someone who did nothing for them? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking of the lazy welfare recipient stereotype, but that‚Äôs usually not the case.
@JacobRo13517686 @realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Could you give an exapmle? As far as I‚Äôm aware, monopolies are born due to a lack of anti-trust laws which allows them to artificially decrease market prices to a point where smaller companies cannot compete until they go bankrupt and bought by said monopoly.

@loondale @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Have you heard of the Military-Industrial Complex? Military equipment corps (Boeing, Lockheed Martin) create jobs in as many states as possible to gain Senate support. It‚Äôs a flaw of US Democracy first pointed out by President Eisenhower.
@loondale @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 To clarify, I‚Äôm not poor, I simply show sympathy. Also, have you looked at any of the charts/data/theories I‚Äôve provided? Wealth is concentrated in the hands of less people each day, who leave none for the disadvantaged and opressed. The income of the bottom 50% doesn‚Äôt increase. https://t.co/a38MMhSuA8
@xennialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The authoritarian regime is the inevitable outcome of Communism. This is probably the seventh time in this thread that I‚Äôve clarified I‚Äôm not a Commie nor an Anarchist.
@Larrypolya22 @AechErvin @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Right, that‚Äôs a point I wanted to eventually come to. The AI revolution will make unprecedented amounts of people unemployed, and we will not be able to create new jobs. What do we do then, when unemployement becomes more customary than employement?

@pokereleran @poliszcz @HappyCycler @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 A governmental structure will exist.

@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Unregulated market forces have proven to be much more than just a relationship of supply &amp; demand. Plus, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúchance of great success.‚Äù https://t.co/meUmPj3LB4 https://t.co/rmmMBShHLg

@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The voluntary engagement argument overshadows the fact that most workers don‚Äôt really have a choice when it comes to employement. They have to ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù engage.
@loondale @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 By that I meant the distribution of the funds of the Gov‚Äôt. How do you plan to fund that enormous military of yours without taxes? It seems like you‚Äôre against taxation.
@poliszcz @HappyCycler @pokereleran @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 ...but with a judicial system in place, individuals wouldn‚Äôt be able to override the public interest, unlike anarchy where that might as well just happen. Also, the ideology isn‚Äôt what Democratic Socialists work for, it‚Äôs the benefit of the people.
@poliszcz @HappyCycler @pokereleran @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Oh, the topic of human nature is entirely different. Not to say that it doesn‚Äôt relate, but that there‚Äôs no agreement between experts. You might say that humans are inclined to be selfish, and I might say that we are social beings and competitive enviroments turn us selfish...
@WhiteTallon @HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Seems as if basic economic theory is enough to scare some right wingers off.
@JohnMinehan1 @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Berine isn‚Äôt a Dem Socialist (contrary to what he says). He believes in radically reforming Capitalism. Ocasio believes that Capitalism is, ideally, abolished. I don‚Äôt think she has active plans to do so, however, in the current time and location she‚Äôs in that‚Äôs not that possible
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 ...you might say that‚Äôs caused by regulation, but without it small businesses would be much worse off, with constant threats of monopolization and uncompetable markets.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Is it fiscally responsible to start a business when in order to do so, you have to put your entire families livelihood on the line? Plus, isn‚Äôt this a reflection on how hard it is to start your business in capitalism in the first place?...
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I‚Äôm sure such people exist. But is it really the vast majority? It seems more like it‚Äôs bigger companies who exploit their workers more. In the process, small businesses suffer as well, I know. But such a generalization isn‚Äôt believable without data to support it.
@poliszcz @HappyCycler @pokereleran @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 It does require bureaucracy. What it doesn‚Äôt require is a small amount of people running the entire thing behind closed doors. The distribution of goods and services can be achieved by the cooperation of regional bodies consisting of (informed &amp; educated) citizens.
@JohnMinehan1 @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Lol, Ba‚Äôathism is an absolute joke. The ‚ÄúScandinavian-model‚Äù you mention is Social Democracy, similar in name and fashion to Democratic Socialism, but different that it incorporates Capitalism. Bernie Sanders is that kinda guy, and that‚Äôs where they (him and Ocasio) differ.
@realbacongains @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Does the financial risk justify exploitation? If so, why are millions of Americans unwillingly under constant financial instability due to lack of healthcare coverage? If only the rich are able to take a willing financial risk, why do we punish the poor for not being able to?
@HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 In representative democracies, transparency is never ensured. Also, why should specific people be significantly more powerful than others? What‚Äôs wrong with a distribution of power? Ofc, some things need to be coordinated, but do we really need to wait til someone turns corrupt?
@loondale @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, do you really think the American politcal system serves the people? Electoral College skews results, gerrymandering and bribery is rampant and %100 legal.
@HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 1) 22T? Where does that figure come from?	2) Inflated prices for merit and public goods have been among the many things the gov‚Äôt could‚Äôve made more accessible via strict regulation, but chose not to for the sake of business. Not solving the free market‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt our fault.
@loondale @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Oh ffs. Achievement is easy for people born to wealthy parents. It‚Äôs easy for people who score high on the SAT  (where, statistically, the wealthy succeed). The ‚Äúmany folks‚Äù are a few stories of self-made millionares which greatly distort the reality of most working Americans. https://t.co/bOamrtIkyI
@WhiteTallon @HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 If you really need an explaination, have r&gt;g, where r is rate of return on capital and g is economic growth rate. The wealth accumulated by capital is what I mean when I say it grows faster than economic output.
@WhiteTallon @HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Oh, go read a book on economics and then try to argue. Hell, even look up some charts. Maybe the ones I provided? Argue on data and theories, not your delusional rambling. Aren‚Äôt you right wingers the ones who chant ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù? If so, bring me facts.
@Cory_Thunder @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 It might sound like a bunch of crap if you‚Äôre not informed on the subject and the theory behind it. Enforcement doesn‚Äôt come from an authoritarian government, it comes from the collective power of the people. Again, this is not anarchy; I support laws as well.
@pokereleran @HappyCycler @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Finally, Democratic Socialism would allow the people to hold those in power accountable, as the proposed measure of direct democracy includes the will of the people to override that of any public official (who singlehandedly wouldn‚Äôt have much power to begin with.)
@pokereleran @HappyCycler @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 ...the current understanding of bribery couldn‚Äôt be commited since it‚Äôd involve many more people who are resopnsible for the finances of a community/nation/corporation/any public entity.
@pokereleran @HappyCycler @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, decentralized governments whenever possible means that corruption on a larger scale would be impossible on the larger scale. Plus, since no entity or individual would control a ridiculous amount of wealth and companies would not be run by small amounts of people...
@Sporkloin @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I see the point, Americans don‚Äôt like Socialism. But that‚Äôs due to a lack of education on the subject. Plus, the youth are becoming increasingly supportive of it. The perfect form of Socialism might not be possible, but there‚Äôs certainly a lot of room for (realistic) improvement.
@loondale @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 You‚Äôre thinking Anarchists, which I‚Äôm not. A democratic structure where citizens have more direct influence over desicions that affect them (money distribution, laws) isn‚Äôt mob rule. I‚Äôd prefer a society by &amp; for the people (sound familiar?) rather than by money-driven politics.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Read the entire thing. @antztru24 argues that fast recoveries have no point IF the economy goes back to where it recovered from in a decade or less. We‚Äôve learned -or so I thought- since 2008 that sudden growth isn‚Äôt really the best thing.
@BeagleyJustin @chepe747 @Danimal941 @benshapiro Exaggerating the views of the oppsoing side is a tactic often used by both sides of the argument, but you‚Äôre right.
@chepe747 @Danimal941 @benshapiro @Ocasio2018 This. The influence of the US is also often overlooked in the failure of these nations.
@HappyCycler @pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 As the rich get richer, the poor are more opressed. Wealth grows faster than economic output, concentrating it in the hands of less people each day. I can‚Äôt see how the number of millionares increasing could possibly indicate that capitalism is good. https://t.co/3hgNJEZIKz
@watjalukinat @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Based on your definition of it (if you mean Laissez-Faire free market capitalism), it might‚Äôve not been. But based on various economic theories and similar real world examples, we can conclude that economic systems with more free markets are less beneficial for the people.
@PImplants @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Except for the good‚Äôol U S of A! Admittedly, the US is culturally more conservative than the average European nation.
@antztru24 @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Ah yes, boom and bust cycles, only one of the many major flaws of Laissez-Faire capitalism.
@poliszcz @antztru24 @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Less gov‚Äôt intervention paves the way for worker exploitation and employers not giving enough wages to workers to live. Free market mechanisms are especially bad when dealing with non-excludable common goods (water), merit goods (education) and basic services (healthcare).
@antztru24 @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 That is correct.
@pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The majority in America is the middle class, which is increasingly shrinking into the lower classes. The current system works for the benefit of a few wealthy citizens. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this from leftists a thousand times, but data is on our side, I can link studies.
@pokereleran @poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 The youth seems to have faith in it. You‚Äôre acting as if there‚Äôs no economic theory behind this. Nobody claims it‚Äôll ‚Äújust work‚Äù, there are major obstacles, but should we tolerate a system where the representatives don‚Äôt speak for the people and the poor are unfairly treated?
@rosie_socialist @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Thx
@BetMONEY300 @cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I simplified the positions of both sides with ususal phrases that are often attributed to them. Making fun of the ‚Äúnot real X‚Äù phrase is easy when you don‚Äôt try to make the distinction between radically different political opinions like Dem Socialism and Authoritarian Communism.
@poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 ...and turn them into productive members of society. The reward is still existent, only the means to achieve it have become more fair. I know it sounds utopical/unrealistic, but there‚Äôs no way to know until we have DSA candidates in office. Maybe Ocasio-Cortez can make a change.
@poliszcz @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Capitalism certainly doesn‚Äôt allow for such opportunities. It seems like it does, but only a minority has it easy when it comes to achieving more. Even if they want, lower class ppl are unable to rise up. Dem Socialism would provide an opportunity for those, educate them...
@BeagleyJustin @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 @Ocasio2018 Except for your last point, I think I mostly agree with you. However, the voluntary existence of co-ops isn‚Äôt merely enough to ensure the rights of every worker, and think that other forms of businesses, which are in the majority, shouldn‚Äôt exist without heavy regulation.
@BeagleyJustin @Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 @Ocasio2018 ‚ÄúScandinavian Capitalism‚Äù is a successful form of Social Democracy. But what works in some nations (where the public is educated, has a good work ethic and is oil rich) can‚Äôt work as well in others.
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 You keep confusing Communism with DemSocialism. Realistically, some private ownership might keep existing, albeit under regulations and w/the ensurement of workers rights. In direct democracy where ppl are educated about their decisions, ‚Äúsocialist masters‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be a thing.
@CivilLost Well, that‚Äôs a common argument. However the examples of that never start out w/ Dem Socialism anyway. You‚Äôre either thinking of Communist USSR/East Germany or State-Capitalist Venezuela.
@chepe747 @Danimal941 @benshapiro Hell, Venezuela isn‚Äôt even an example of socialism. It‚Äôs just state-imposed capitalism, where billionares still exist, and the power of the people is completely stripped from them.
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 To be clear, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúsocietal contributions‚Äù can be explicitly measured and put in a database in the form of numbers, but I do think merely owning something and profiting from it being a legitimate form of wealth is a major roadblock on equality that could be removed.
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 https://t.co/FwCth1J8LM
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Regulated market mechanisms &amp; democratic planning can achieve much more fair and just distrobution based on actual contributions rather than in the free market where manipulators are the most well-off. I just sound like I‚Äôm reading off the DSA website so I‚Äôll just link you there
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 I‚Äôm no advocate for anarchy either. Workplaces could have management in dem socialism as well, the only difference being that the administrative staff will not gain unfair amounts of money compared to others. Money should be distrobuted by how much one has contributed to society.
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 You‚Äôre talking about a representative democracy which, albeit better than none at all, has major flaws (corruption, deception, gerrymandering). Also, by desicions I not only mean those at a state level, but also in workplaces. Demsocialism has as much decentralisation as possible
@Larrypolya22 @cbrower2141 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Democratic Socialism, the kind Ocasio-Cortez supports, is a system where desicions are made not by the elite nor the state, but directly the people that said desicions affect. (Contrary to popular belief, it‚Äôs strongly opposed to authoritarian regimes like Communism.)
@cbrower2141 @Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Well, that‚Äôs getting into an entirely different argument where one side (including me) claims that true socialism hasn‚Äôt been achieved yet, and the other says it never will. The point here was that Ocasio-Cortez has earned &amp; deserves the attention she gets, judging by her appeal.
@Larrypolya22 @benshapiro @kkeaton14 Where‚Äôd you find the 260k figure? Regardless, primaries usually have lower turnouts anyway. Also, how do you determine what attention someone ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù? Obviously her appeal is much wider than the 14th Congressional District in NYC, and she has many supporters throughout the US.
@Batman64Batman @EdKrassen You, along with a lot of uninformed folks, are acting like the US directly gives money to NATO countries, and the 2% GDP thing is a contribution to NATO. It isn‚Äôt, and the agreement between all NATO members is a multilateral one, as the US has a bunch of military bases in EU etc.
