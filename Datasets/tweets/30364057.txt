@cjwerleman Until we see ourselves in each other instead of evil and righteous faceless entities - what can really change?  @DaveChappelle ‚Äòs piece on the end of apartheid in South Africa in his special ‚ÄúThe Bird Revelation‚Äù is inspiring &amp; makes me hopeful for Palestine/Israel‚ù§Ô∏ècheckitout
@cjwerleman Hamas‚Äôs mission statement including ‚Äúkill all Jews‚Äù adds nuance, no? Again- they don‚Äôt represent all people either But it makes it scarier for some to let go &amp; see what‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm NO expert OBVIOUSLY- I‚Äôm interested in truth &amp; justice but I can‚Äôt speak like I know what I don‚Äôt

@cjwerleman I think the struggle w some of my Jewish brothers and sisters is it‚Äôs very scary bc it takes very little 4 people to hate all Jews. Some are too scared to see the hypocracy in what that very fear is creating.  So many israelis are fighting with you. Please amplify them too
@cjwerleman I didn‚Äôt apologize- I want her free! I want all Palestinians 2B free- no human should be not free &amp; no people should oppress others.  There IS some chicken and egg-i-ness and there is nuance &amp; we both know govts oft don‚Äôt represent the hearts of its people.
