@Icelandair Sent DM
@Icelandair Awesome. I get to watch for a message until 2am local time?

@Icelandair And, when will that be?
@Icelandair No night for me. Waiting to figure out when I need to be at airport.
@Icelandair over an hour to wait for baggage return at ord. Still no details about when fi852 that was canceled is rescheduled for....
@Icelandair No personnel at ORD Icelandair counter. On hold for over 40 mins with Icelandair "customer service". https://t.co/v0TIHClbsz
@Icelandair Even better. You have no one at ticket counter at ORD to get us rebooked or to a hotel. #icelandairfail
@Icelandair Check again. Now canceled. Thx for nothing.
@Icelandair You are confirming that diverted plane actually left MSP??
@Icelandair Soooo...when are you going to make a decision on FI852 from ORD to KEF? Waiting with no info for HOURS. Unacceptable.
