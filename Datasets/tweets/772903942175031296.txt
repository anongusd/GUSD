@Chrisbamidele @Chrisbamidele  greetings. Please accept my deep sympathies. But never give up, never never give up! There is hope. Sometimes setbacks are mere tests to prepare us for higher service. The best is yet to be, my friend. The Lord bless you real good!

@ShehuSani Failure to deal with the insurgency is a monumental government failure. The recent tragedy in Melete is a severe indictment on their failure to protect our country from these reptiles. We have a strategy and methodology to confront the buggahs, but it's not for social media.
@anye_jr @london_used @ugoch_o Goddy, you are going to be great! I bless you.
