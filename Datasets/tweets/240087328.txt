@peterwashington Thanks, Peter. Would 'conducted research' at Stanford be accurate? Need a short/easy verb to characterize what he did at Stanford.  (But 'conducted research' might lead readers to think he did CRISPR research there. That's why I avoided it, and used a more general word. )  Thanks

@IronFalcon77 @Weather_West @mercnews unbelievable. thank you.  wonder whether land-use planning will be part of the conversation, going forward?
@LisaParr007 Weird. I'm so sorry; don't know why. If you send me your email at lkrieger@bayareanewsgroup.com, then I'll have it. Under law, officials have 10 days to respond to our query re: # of phone numbers/texts/email evac alerts issued; when; where (which zones); # 'reached'.
@LisaParr007 OK. That is very valuable information.  Do you mind if we stay in touch? If so, do you mind sharing your name and (non-Twitter) contact info, for my files?  When all the CodeRED data get shipped to me, will need real people to help 'ground truth' it.	Grateful for yr input. 	Lisa
@LisaParr007 The company behind CodeRED asserts that evac orders went out simultaneously on Twitter &amp; SM, landlines and cells (call &amp; text.) If the 8:41 a.m. evac order (below) didn't get to you in Zone 6, I'm questioning the reliability of what they said.
@LisaParr007 What a mystery. On Twitter, this evacuation order was posted:	EVACUATION ORDER: Due to the fire in the area, an evacuation order has been issued for zones 2, 6, 7 and 13. If assistance is needed in evacuating, please call 9 1 1. #ButteSheriff #CampFire	8:41 AM - 8 Nov 2018
@LisaParr007 That's interesting, Lisa.  Thank you for sharing. May I ask what 'zone' you were in? (From time-stamped Twitter evac orders, it looks like they missed 1, 9, 6 and maybe others. ) The 'all Paradise alert' didn't go out until 11 am.   Also: Do you recall if you had cell service?
@therobdale Thank you! Contradicts what county folks told me, but they likely didn't know.  Appreciate the picture.
@therobdale Agree. Thank you.  Disaster expert @ Columbia U recommended WEA, followed up by alert.  (WEA is county-wide, and only 80 characters. Could send people the wrong direction. Alerts much more specific.)
@therobdale Hi Rob, Yes, CodeRED (typo, thank you.) The CodeRED database available to Butte County for sending messages to the public contains a mix of cell phone, hard-wired home &amp; business phones.  OnSolve re-confirmed yesterday that downed towers would prevent receipt of cell-based alerts
@DianaDee16 yes!
@CBDeLauder Wow. Thank you, Carla. Hadn't heard that. And good idea.
ICYMI: Here's how/why the alert &amp; evacuation systems failed in #CampFire. Experts advise how to stay alive in California fire country: https://t.co/F4ujYjOZpU via @mercnews
@DuaneHere Yes. Well said. Thank you.
@therobdale Rob, yes, CodeRED. Typo; thank you. 6,000 cell calls were completed in the first 10 minutes of the initial evacuation.  (Of those, 60 percent, connected to a person or voice mail.) Residents say later evac orders were not received. Notification incl. text, email, app &amp; Twitter.
My #campfire evac timeline analysis 1) First RedAlert orders too limited &amp; too few people registered. 2) Orders expanded but cell service failed 3) Some zones missed completely 4) By 11 a.m., "All Paradise” order went out -- but no cell or power.  https://t.co/F4ujYjOZpU
