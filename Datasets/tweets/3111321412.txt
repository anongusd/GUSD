@jballen004 @ReaganBattalion @David_Bossie @FoxNews @edhenry But @David_Bossie is from Boston, MA.  Last time I checked MA is not often referred to as “the South”.  Next “defense” please. Waiting.
@RandyH1111 @KFILE @shannonrwatts I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when I was 15 years old. I am now 47 and not a bigot. BIGOTRY is not a mental health issue but a moral one. The Mental Health crisis and the stigma attached as well as Bigotry  need to be addressed But to conflate the 2 is wrong.
@KatyTurNBC @MSNBC @CNN @ShepNewsTeam @wolfblitzer @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH. STOP GIVING TRUMP A PLATFORM FOR HIS PROPAGANDA.
@kaitlancollins The media should stop covering him. Don’t let his lies be broadcasted. It truly is just like North Korean Propaganda.

@CillizzaCNN The President @realDonaldTrump is making the most of his “executive time” this morning.
@alicetweet @alicetweet Bless your heart. After respecting you for calling out Trump on the numerous “moral” issues. This is the ONE you decide to tow the Trump-line.

@chrissyteigen YOU are a master at the Twitter troll. But, I think we all would agree that @PeteSouza is a National Treasure.
Hey @SenJohnMcCain I’m watching  @E60 and am curious if the real reason that @realDonaldTrump has such animus toward you is because you are “mean” to his “mentor” Putin? @MeghanMcCain.
