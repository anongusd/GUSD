@etjernst That's why I stressed to ask for the full list. Not the top placements.
RT @itaisher: @DinaPomeranz For grad school I chose between Stanford and Northwestern.  People who didn‚Äôt know that much all said Stanford.‚Ä¶
@itaisher Yes, totally agree.		Ask what people in your field say about a place. Look at recent average placements for larger sense, not minor differences. E.g. do they only supports the very best or fight for every student to succeed?		If places seem similarly attractive, go with your gut.

@itaisher Totally agree for rankings that are not far apart. The rankings are not so precise anyway. 		Also it's different if you're already certain you don't wan't to do an academic career, or if there are personal reasons outside of career that affect your location choice.
- One exception is if a school has, in a very fundamental way, a different focus from your own, e.g. of the department is almost exclusively theory focused and you want to do empirical work. 		These are my two cents. What do others think? 3/3
- Take those two metrics into account. But other than that don't turn down a better ranked school for a lower ranked one out of fear. Imposter syndrome is rampant but it doesn't mean you're actually not good enough. Many of the most famous economists suffered from it.		2/3
Got into more than one econ PhD program and unsure how to choose? My two cents: 		- Ask for full list of placements of recent years PhD graduates.	- Ask how many students start the program but don't graduate. 		1/2

@lukestein @SylvanRH My hypothesis was that for under-represented groups, Twitter allows us to find and see more others in similar situations and hence feel more included and less isolated.

@graykimbrough Sorry if we somehow talked past each other. Communication is sometimes hard over distance in 280 characters...
@AnnaGoeddeke @graykimbrough @_alice_evans @causalinf Totally agree! But don't you find many in academia share that view, and you can just ignore those who don't? Same happens within academia. Some theorists think empirical work is crap, and vice versa, but we focus on those people who appreciate our work.
@enoris Goes for all of us :)
@graykimbrough @_alice_evans @causalinf Instead we might focus our energy on supporting others in the world and in our environment that are way less privileged than we are :)
@graykimbrough @_alice_evans @causalinf I think we have to stop giving so much power to people who believe such things. A lot of it is our own insecurities as well. I'd say if we have a stable job in a field of our choice, things are going pretty well for us &amp; we should stop worrying so much what others might think.
@enoris No this is not a matter of people not turning on their brains. If these things were obvious or trivial, they wouldn't be so challenging. Thinking things are trivial is exactly one of the mistakes we tend to make when we comment from afar.
@_alice_evans @causalinf In fields where that is not the case, IMHO people should only start a PhD if they expect they will be happy with this choice even if they then do not go on to an academic position. 		Like when I joined HBS, I knew the odds of staying were slim, and went into it eyes wide open.

@ryanbedwards @JohnHolbein1 Overall, I don't think Twitter is worth the time for carrier-boosting professional goals. I love it due to the interesting stuff I learn about the world &amp; about research, the humanity that people show about their struggles &amp; joys, the sense of community &amp; the diversity of people.
@ryanbedwards @JohnHolbein1 To disseminate that makes sense. Then you can just jump on to share but don't have to be on here frequently if it has a negative impact on your life. I'm not even sure how much professional impact it has to share papers on Twitter. Econs get judged mostly on publications.
@JohnHolbein1 @ryanbedwards ah, ok, yes, for polisci it might be different. 		Does polisci twitter stress you out more than econ twitter? Can you unfollow specific accounts that tend to stress you out more?		I have a shortlist of people I follow most closely whose tweets tend be informative &amp; constructive.

@franciscome @etjernst @lukusem Ok this seems to vary a lot by country then!
@econsageman This sounds like it might be the explanation as to how that happened: https://t.co/RZhNT1zrMa
@econsageman Here's where I disagree. This seems to be a US thing to describe anything that deviates from libertarianism as socialist. Social isn't socialistm. There were social reforms as the state grew all the way back since the middle ages. Public orphanages, schools, etc.
@mathiasjorgens @econsageman Just to clarify: the official school curriculum says "we are a socialist country"? Asking out of curiosity.
@econsageman No, I'm just going with the terms I grew up here in Europe. Seems many people in the US both on the left and right use a much more expanded definition than what I learned in school.
@econsageman @mathiasjorgens I didn't do to school I Denmark, that's why I asked him.		In Switzerland they teach that we're a social market economy, and that this is different from socialism where the workers would own the factories, there are no stock markets, etc.		In which country did you go to school?

@mathiasjorgens @econsageman So in Denmark in schools they teach that Denmark is a socialist state? I didn't know that.
@etjernst No you didn't, I did by wording the poll poorly.
@etjernst @lukusem Yes, very.
@mathiasjorgens @econsageman Yes, exactly and that is not what's happening in Northern Europe. Private enterprise is private even though taxes are high :)
@etjernst I was trying to tease out that people in the US use it differently from most others. Clearly I failed...
@econsageman My understanding is socialism is a political system in which workers own the means of production. Not a market economy where taxes are used to provide certain goods publicly such as e.g. health or public education.
@mathiasjorgens @econsageman A large state isn't socialism.
@lukusem @etjernst My Twitter feed is full of people in the US who think it's wonderful. And then they proceed to describe policies like the ones in Switzerland. And we are decidedly *not* socialist. Why is there this strong desire by some in the US to call any pro social reforms socialist?
@etjernst No, I find that much less interesting.  That's just a political debate. I find it weird that the some people in the US start to use the word socialism to include almost anything that's not libertarian. Much of European style social market economy was built *against* socialism.
@econsageman Publicly provided healthcare does not socialism make, not any more than public schools do. All of these are social market economies in different flavors.
@tylerwood514 Of all countries, the US is the biggest problem. No need to destroy the economy, but time for the US to finally start catching up to the rest of the rich world in playing it's part to reduce carbon emissions.
@freddyrojascama How come people in the US use the term socialism in such an increasingly broad way that it becomes completely different from how the rest of the world uses it? Welfare state isn't socialism. It's what Europe created in opposition to socialist countries to our East in the Cold War

@RFisman @IlliniBizDean @arindube @mattyglesias It would be very far from me to blame b-schools for "all that's wrong in business"! But I do think we can do better at working to improve business practices and social norms in a more effective way. It's an important and difficult conversation.
@RFisman @IlliniBizDean @arindube @mattyglesias Yes, I was thinking about that too. The fact that non-trivial share of faculty role their eyes about the ethics considerations does seem to indicate that they see such considerations as luxury at best. Unfortunately, this often comes out in the subtext of their teaching as well.
@RFisman @IlliniBizDean @arindube @mattyglesias The discourse seems a bit bifurcated sometimes, with ethics classes discussing how to behave well and other classes mostly ignoring those aspects. This can then make ethical considerations feel a bit like Sunday school or luxury. Might be more effective to integrate the concepts.
@RFisman @IlliniBizDean @arindube @mattyglesias I've definitely seen many business contexts where the word "value creation" was equalized to "profit creation", and it was not in the context of a finance model.

@jggarin We *could* say, 'We don't want all the best economists to stay in our profession. We only want the subgroup who are also willing to accept harsh, condescending treatment.' Then those who are more vulnerable and those with great outside options will leave. Big loss for science.
@jggarin (Experimental) Research shows: lack of empathy increases with power. So if you are having a hard time empathizing with those who have different, less combative personalities, it might be an opportunity for you to ask yourself if it's really you who has the "first world problem".

@rebegol @robmun12 @moffii @raganpetrie @DurRobert Thanks for clarifying!
Looking for great economists to follow on recent US policy debates on tax? Two of my favorites: @wwwojtekk for a relatively critical view, @arindube for a relative supportive view.		And of course you can also follow @gabriel_zucman directly, who's involved in the Warren proposal.
@pdsegal Well yes, I didn't dispute that. But I hope you didn't mean to suggest this means we should exaggerate or misreported the facts? The facts are stark enough as is. Accuracy matters.

I don't have a clear opinion (yet) on any of the proposed US tax changes.		But I do have the opinion that it's a good thing that the US now has serious discussions about the role of taxation for inequality and about different policy proposals. Big change over recent years.

@gabriel_zucman @Noahpinion Interesting, thanks.
@gabriel_zucman In he FT link from 2016 you sent, I only see them saying income inequality and poverty is falling, not that wealth inequality is falling. Am I misreading? Sorry if I'm slow.
@leroyje32325693 No you can't get a randomized field experiment to just find whatever you please. It's anti-scientific BS like that which leads to anti-vaccine hysteria etc. You need to distinguish studies that just correlate stuff from studies that can show cause &amp; effect.		All the best to you.
@leroyje32325693 Ah, so now you no longer claim its caused by people being happy about the money, you are criticizing a different point? What made you change your mind?
@leroyje32325693 No, the criticism you quote here is about studies consisting if mere correlations, while the study I posted was an randomized field experiment. 		Why would you conflate the two? Did you look at the study itself?
@leroyje32325693 How would you explain that the money didn't affect overall satisfaction or happiness, but feelings of depression?		Btw the payment was around 15 dollars.
@gabriel_zucman Interesting, who says it's falling? I've seen data suggesting income inequality is falling, but haven't seen claims about falling global wealth inequality. Who did I miss?		(BTW, I assign texts from the WIR/WID website as readings on my undergrad syllabus üòä)

@tylercowen I'll leave you the last word :) Enjoy :)
@tylercowen There are more reasons to US terribly low wages at bottom than migration. Ok, now definitely out. Gday!
@MartinSGaynor @mioana Seminars are a great venue for feedback. Combined brainpower. If there's a problem that people in the room see but don't say, that's worse, as it doesn't give opportunity to respond. We need to abandon notion that negative feedback is embarrassing. All research needs improvement.
@elliottmcollins @tylercowen Not from Boston but from anywhere in the EU. We have free labor mobility :)
@tylercowen Many people move :) We're 50% immigrants. Anyway, sounds like you now changed your argument rather than addressing my response. Have a very nice day, I'm gonna let this conversation rest now.
@MartinSGaynor @mioana Of course if someone is really completely floundering we should not pile on. But those cases are pretty rare in my opinion. 		Point is to be friendly, curious, interested in learning, not interested in winning an ego match, and not be snarky or dismissive in tone or attitude.
@MartinSGaynor @mioana I don't think we generally should postpone feedback. I find it useful for progress of science &amp; learning that we're direct in raising potential problems. When this is the norm, negative feedback isn't embarrassing. I learn a lot from critical but friendly pushback.
@tylercowen Not clear to me why city size matters. Same is true when comparing Boston to the entire CH.
@tylercowen I'm sure many people are unhappy about many things. But purchasing power of those at the bottom here is much large than in Boston, both because of higher incomes and strong social safety net. So I'm not sure who you mean by "those left out". Btw unemployment in CH is 3-4%.

Price in Boston vs Zurich: 		Similar for food, clothes, electronics. Higher in Zurich for taxis, hair cuts, restaurants. Notice a pattern? 		Service-intensive things are more expensive. While mean income is similar, low wages are *much* higher in Zurich. Happy to pay for that :)
@BrankoMilan @Nar_Suarez Calling cultural difference when you visit a foreign country "non standard" and blaming it on some other characteristics of the country one visits is - unstandard? 		Notice, also: the rich person in that interaction with the staff is you :)
@fhollenbach @BrankoMilan What you mostly pay for in restaurants is not the cost of ingredients, it's time of staff. That's why your Coke also costs more than in the store. In Switzerland, low wages are high &amp; service staff are typically paid 3000 to 4000 dollar/month. Lower wage inequality has a price.

@mioana @monk_n2 @johnjhorton @aaronsojourner I think it's fine in a seminar to say in an open way, "Have you considered this other variable that might introduce bias" directly, without any preamble. That's quite different from "Why should we believe your results, you haven't even controlled for this other variable?!"
@mioana @monk_n2 @johnjhorton @aaronsojourner I feel like I see it done well all the time. But it probably depends what we consider aggressive. A lot of it is also in the tone. If it comes from a place of curiosity and contribution, it tends to sound very different then if the point is to prove who's smarter.

@charlesjkenny Asylum seekers are just people applying for refugee status in a different channel. Not a separate phenomenon.
@charlesjkenny IMHO the total sum matters much more. All else equal, if a million refugees arrive in person, the obligation to resettle additional refugees may be different than ivory few people arrive in person.
@simardcasanova Sounds like you yourself might be obsessing a lot about such publications? The vast majority of economists don't publish there and do great other things. It's a particular type of training and style to publish there, it doesn't make anyone a good or bad person. Deep breath :)

@charlesjkenny What do we learn from comparing resettlement numbers of countries without much direct access for refugees to seek asylum with numbers in countries where resettlements play a tiny role in the refugee system?
@RhondaVSharpe @jenniferdoleac @tacraigie @ENPancotti @TrevonDLogan In general (without taking a position on these specific papers) do you believe quantitative research can sometimes be done in a reliable, correct way, and other times not? If yes, how do you recommend we deal with the non-reliable research?
@charlesjkenny This is not a very informative comparison, since in Europe most refugees arrive by themselves, not through resettlement.

@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Ich glaube, in dem Punkt sind wir uns einig.		Da die positiven Trends eher langsame verlaufen, und die negativen oft abrupt, haben viele Menschen ein negativ verzerrtes Bild. Siehe z.B. https://t.co/PFb3BcchLO
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Meiner Meinung nach sollte man weder schwarz malen, noch sagen, alles sei gut. Sondern die Fakten so wie sie sind darstellen. Es hilft der Sache nicht, wenn Leute aus ideologischen Zielen systematisch Aspekte aus den Schlagzeilen zu halten versuchen.
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Ja, deshalb habe ich die globalen Ungleichheit der Einkommen erw√§hnt, auf die ganze Welt gesehen. 		Die Armut habe ich im Interview erw√§hnt, weil viele Menschen f√§lschlicherweise denken, steigende Ungleichheit = steigende Armut. Wie Sie richtig sagen, sind das separate Konzepte.
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Sehr empfehlenswert! Spannende Perspektiven und Daten zu diesen und verwandten Themen. Von einem Autor der sich lebensl√§nglich aktiv gegen Armut eingesetzt hat.
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Kennen Sie das Buch "Factfulness"?
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Viel zu viele Menschen glauben, dass alles immer schlimmer werde in den Entwicklungsl√§ndern und dass es deshalb sinnlos sein, irgend etwas zu tun (z.B. Entwicklungshilfe). Es ist auch wichtig, den Menschen hier zu zeigen, was in L√§ndern des S√ºdens alles erreicht wird!
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Ja, klar, wenn eine Bev√∂lkerung w√§chst, nimmt in absoluten Zahlen alles zu, nur nimmt die Zahl der Menschen √ºber der Armutsgrenze viel schneller die Anzahl darunter. 		Sie haben doch in Ihrem Tweet von Armutsreduktion geschrieben. Oder habe ich etwas falsch verstanden?
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews Klar nimmt Ungleichheit innerhalb gewisser L√§nder stark zu (zB China, USA) und in anderen ab (zB in den meiste Latam L√§ndern). Meine Aussagen waren - wir Oxfams - √ºber die globale Verteilung.
@ywegelin @WorldBank @IMFNews https://t.co/vKzSdE8UMW https://t.co/OGC0lXY8fk

@awg_allan Who's "you"? I'm Swiss.
Anecdote on the latter:		When starting a job in the US, big part of offer was about credit to buy a house. (Which seemed crazy to me after 24 years of education with little savings) 		When starting job in Switzerland, Dean instead discussed how they help with retirement savings.
Two differences that both seem to affect this: 		- Low-income wages in the US have not grown much compared to most of Europe. Lots of working poor, especially considering the overall GDP/capita.		- Even people in the US with higher incomes have quite different savings habits.

From a European perspective, one thing that seems shocking about the US shutdown is that in one of the richest countries in the world, many government employees are in such poor economic conditions that after a few weeks of delayed pay, they have difficulty feeding their family.

@shurder @JakeVigdor @IlliniBizDean @Undercoverhist @davidautor @ProfEmilyOster That econ is lucrative for some isn't something that concerns me too much.		That there are unequal barriers to entry in our &amp; many other professions, leaving Black &amp;Latino Americans, women, people from lower classes, etc. with vastly limited opportunities concerns me a lot.
@JakeVigdor @IlliniBizDean @Undercoverhist Practically all of us could make vastly larger sums of money by switching to the private sector, often with significant lower stress.  So financial greed seems not the primary problem in econ academia IMHO.
@JakeVigdor @IlliniBizDean @Undercoverhist That by itself is neither corrupt nor exceptional. Many organizations and institutions aim to be the nest in their field. Not clear that's a negative. When trying to change exclusionary practices, how about we focus on specific problems and how to change them concretely?

@albertcardona Also if you're from Europe and not used to the notion that one might take out a loan for education, this is a case where it can often be worthwhile doing so, as the cost of this is often low compared to your expected post-PhD earnings (depends on your country though...)

@simardcasanova I'm so glad to hear that econtwitter can play this role!
@simardcasanova Different style.
@simardcasanova Some "super stars" in econ publish 6 papers in 10 years. Some European profs publish 40 papers in below field journal type publications in that same period.
@simardcasanova This is also a cultural change. In many European places, the goal used to be to publish a lot, rather than in high ranked journals. People who came up in that system find it weird that some work for years to try to get a paper from field journal level to a chance for top 5.
@schiller061 @simardcasanova @TrevonDLogan To me, this seems the biggest issue to address. Which PhD program someone gets into has too large an effect on future outcomes. From what I've seen, in part this is different information &amp; training acquired in the PhD. Challenge is how can we replicate this in other institutions?
@simardcasanova @KeithMMEricson FWIW, econtwitter doesn't feel very different from my regular work environment either at Zurich or previously at Harvard.
@simardcasanova @KeithMMEricson Sorry to hear that you didn't have an environment in which you thrived!
@simardcasanova From what I often see when refereeing papers of junior European authors is a difference in training on how to write this type of paper. I definitely agree that lack of talent is often not the constraint. Nor lack of ideas. Question is how to democratize the training.
@simardcasanova Definitely having a large funnel into academia is a good thing, even if people were on average the same, as it brings in more talents and more perspectives.

@simardcasanova These are the key skills for econ academia at any institution.
@simardcasanova Not to contradict the rest of this thread, but in econ, due to the long publishing lags (as you know, it's often years), prior working papers do count as preexisting literature, so that is not necessarily unscientific. This happens to submitters from "top" unis, too.

@ryanbedwards @ryancbriggs @MosconeF The US also has large entrenched advantages both in econ and the world. One way that can manifest is people from the US considering US norms universal and expecting the rest of us to behave accordingly. Due to cultural hegemony, awareness of cultural difference is weak in the US.
@ryanbedwards @ryancbriggs @MosconeF I remember when they arrested a German woman a few month after 9/11 because she said jokingly to the TSA agent "no, the bomb is in my other bag". People here found it hard to understand why that would be an arrestable offense. We use ironic humor here a lot on difficult issues.
@ryanbedwards @ryancbriggs @MosconeF I'm not sure one should stop joking about topics when they are hot issues. But that may be both a personal and cultural specific issue. I think in the US, not tolerating jokes about sensitive topics is much more common than in Europe.

RT @paulgp: Lots of new faces on #EconTwitter post-ASSA -- hope you'll all join the conversation :-)
@dclingi ü§£
@JustinSandefur Exactly.
@nomadj1s @dclingi In a way, my teacher's approach strikes a balance between those who aren't great at expressing themselves in class vs in a written exam. There is no perfect system...		FWIW, in my 60 person class at UZH, I don't grade participation. I try to make it interactive voluntarily :)
@nomadj1s @dclingi Only if you grade on a curve. Also, if you get a grade A on an exam, and you never speak, you keep the A. 		At HBS, where participation counts a lot, if you get an A in the exam, and you never speak, you might even fail the class, but definitely won't get an A.
@JustinSandefur Yes, IMO the goal should be a culture &amp; structure that is welcoming to well-executed replications, with no hostility in either direction. A culture or learning or "error culture" as we say in German ("Fehlerkultur"). Agree replications should be much more common. But not hostile.
@dclingi @nomadj1s One downside is that it punishes introverts. Also less privileged groups often participate less. My high school math teacher had a system that I liked: it counts as a positive if you participate well (to round up your grade), but not as a negative if you don't.
@JustinSandefur There must be ways to generate a good, constructive learning environment in science without a climate of fear, callouts, and hostility. At least I am strongly committed to that.
@JustinSandefur Are you less concerned about false negatives than false positives? Are you not concerned about falsely accusing honest researchers of "cheating"? How many young people (&amp; particularly‚ôÄ) would flee the field if getting falsely accused would be considered "cost of doing research"?
@JustinSandefur Sounds like broad econ consensus to me. Adversarial part can be problematic though when incentives arise to try many things, until replicators can overturn results, to make a bigger splash.		IMHO research should be neutral, not adversarial. (See also: culture in econ discussion.)

@gbenga_ajilore Ah, cool, I saw the tweets about the race! Get some coffee!!‚ù§
@gbenga_ajilore How come it is not about who is getting the PhDs? Apparently there are 7 US Latina and 4 African American women who graduate per year from econ PhDs in the US. That severely constrains who can be hired for econ faculty positions. What am I missing?
@gbenga_ajilore In other words, there aren't disproportionally too many POCs from abroad,  but nowhere nearly enough from the US. Seems important to not see this as a competition between POCs of different origin.
@gbenga_ajilore My sense is already at the PhD level, there are more POC from abroad than from the US. I part that makes sense because the planet is 80% POC. So among immigrants, the PhDs seem more balanced. We need to strongly increase the pipeline of African Americans &amp; US Latinos into PhD.

@causalinf @ENPancotti @ShellyJLundberg @MarthaOlney Not what I wrote above :)

And other people would have criticized your approach too :) In any case, this discussion at this point seems a bit of a distraction. The survey is out now.

@MartinRavallion Given what I told you in our discussions, I'm not shocked at all :)

@UofLEcon @Marietmora @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA Somehow this seems too high		Apparently about 900 PhDs are awarded in the US each year in total.	https://t.co/PrmFkOw6XS		If so, then 380 women likely also includes the foreigners, since more than half of econ grad students are foreigners: https://t.co/ccBv9bbbGM
@UofLEcon @Marietmora @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA Oh, so 380 econ PhDs were awarded to female US citizens and permanent residents?
@Marietmora @UofLEcon @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA In any case I agree the numbers are way too low and we urgently need to work at changing them. Was just curious what exactly is counted here as I might want to mention these figures to others going forward.
@Marietmora @UofLEcon @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA And the 380 is total, i.e. including student visa holders?
@stephkestelman @UofLEcon @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA I was just curious about the stats. I think the 4 and 7 doesn't include women on a student visa while the 380 does. I could be wrong about the latter.
@UofLEcon @AEACSWEP @NEAEcon @ASHE_ASSA We really need to change this! Just to clarify: am I correct to assume that the 380 includes all nationalities, and the 7 and 4 includes only US citizens, not Africans and Latin Americans?

You said you don't want to minimize the gender issue. However, so far I'm not seeing that. In what way are you taking it seriously?
@karnage_don @PeterBeinart Actually, since Hillary lost by a narrow margin, it's likely that if she was a man, she would have received a few percent more votes &amp; would have won the presidency. Just because other factors also play a role, that doesn't mean that gender cannot make the difference.
@karnage_don @PeterBeinart I agree on the word "everything". Of course, in every candidates many factors play a factor. But I think you and I agree that being a woman should not be a negative factor for likability. Your originial tweet did indeed sound like you were downplaying that issue.

@BMBengtsson @OurWorldInData My guess is 99% of my followers are aware of the environmental problems already, but only about 25% are aware of these progresses. And the latter is only that high because I tweeted this before. Hence I tweet this to counterbalance the prevailing information gap.

@BMBengtsson @OurWorldInData No, I don't agree. Most people are woefully misinformed about social &amp; economic progress, leading them to believe everything is getting worth &amp; leaving them with hopelessness &amp; cynicism.

@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann @InaPraetorius Das ist nun schon wieder ein anderes Argument :) 		√úbrigens: wenn Du all die Firmen und Managerinnen abschaffen und einschr√§nken willst, bleibt dann auch weniger zum Umverteilen an die pensionierte Putzfrau :)		So, und nun muss ich definitiv gehen. Sch√∂nen Nachmittag!
@JoelLiamBuehler @InaPraetorius @EmmanuelUllmann @PluraleOekonZH Egal, welche Meinung man hat, es ist wichtig, einzelne Argumente genau durchzuspielen und auf spezifische Gegenargumente inhaltlich einzugehen, nicht ganz viele Punkte in einen Topf werfen. Zu diesem Punkt sind sich alle PhilosophInnen von rechts bis links einig.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann @InaPraetorius Ah, war mir nicht klar. Ich habe nirgends behauptet, es sei ein Sachzwang. Sondern, dass es auch Nachteile von "fix 65" gibt. Es ging Dir anscheinend nicht einzig um Rentenalter. Sondern auch um Rentenerh√∂hung, gegen Managerinnen &amp; gegen 2. S√§ule. Das macht diskutieren schwierig.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Willst Du allen ernstes alle Firmenleitungen abschaffen? ;) Das hat jetzt mit AHV ja nicht mehr viel zu tun :)
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Leider muss ich mich jetzt sowieso aus dieser Diskussion verabschieden, denn ich muss noch einen l√§ngeren Text fertig schreiben heute Nachmittag. 		En Guete Rutsch!
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Ich dachte, die Diskussion ginge darum, ob das Rentenalter auf aktuellem Stand eingefroren werden soll und ob wir √§ltere Leute vor Entlassungen sch√ºtzen. Die Investitionen der 2. S√§ule und die H√∂he der Rente sind interessante Themen, aber andere. Kein eingehen auf meine Punkte.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Joel, geht es Dir um eine inhaltliche Diskussion? Dann w√§re es wichtig, bei einem Argument zu bleiben, und auf die direkten Anliegen einzugehen. Sonst kommen wir vom Hundersten zum Tausendsten, und denken keinen Punkt fertig durch.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Deshalb ist individualisierte Wahlm√∂glichkeit so wichtig.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Ich habe nichts von Beitrag an die Gesellschaft erw√§hnt, sondern vi  Wahlfreiheit. Nicht jede Managerin will pl√∂tzlich zwangsm√§ssig zur gratis Vollzeit Grossmutter werden, und nicht jeder Lehrer hat Enkelkinder. Viele pensionierte Menschen sind einsam.
@JoelLiamBuehler @EmmanuelUllmann Also l√§ngere plus h√∂here Rente und kein Schutz vor altersdiskriminierenden Entlassungen? D.h. finanziell mehr  Umverteilung von Jung zu Alt und wenig Arbeitsm√∂glichkeit f√ºr aktive  65-j√§hrige? Umverteilung ist immer Ansichtssache, aber man muss √ºber die Trade-Offs ehrlich sein.
@JoelLiamBuehler Wenn die Wahlm√∂glichkeit 100% flexibel w√§re, br√§uchte es dann noch ein gesetzliches Rentenalter? Wie kann man verhindern, dass Leute, die gerne weiter arbeiten m√∂chten rausgeschmissen werden, wie heute vielerorts √ºblich?
@hapemathys @JoelLiamBuehler @CR_Schmid Ja, genau, solche Altersdiskriminierungen sind sehr problematisch.
@JoelLiamBuehler @hapemathys @CR_Schmid Pers√∂nlich arbeite ich gerne l√§nger, und praktisch all meine selbst√§ndig erwerbenden Verwandten, die das Pensionierungsalter selber w√§hlen k√∂nnen, haben das auch so getan. Zwangspensionierung mit 65 ist f√ºr viele auch nicht sch√∂n. Ideal w√§re mehr Wahlm√∂glichkeit.
@JoelLiamBuehler @hapemathys @CR_Schmid Je nach dem, ob man seine Arbeit hasst und ob man lieber bis nach 65 arbeiten will oder lieber weniger verdienen √ºber das ganze Leben gesehen bzw. mehr Stunden arbeiten pro Woche bis zur Pensionierung. Vielen Menschen gibt der Beruf auch Sinn.

@JakeVigdor Your thread feels to me a bit like if I said "What should be done about racism in the US? Everyone should just leave the US like I did." (Yes, I know it's not a perfect analogy.)
@JakeVigdor I'm glad that you like the interdisciplinary approach. But unless you expect the discipline of econ to vanish in the next few years, none of this will solve the real gender and racial diversity issues that econ is struggling with.

@GabRosenberg @muellerkaderli @afagerbakke You know full well that there are roads built by Israelis on which Palestinians are not allowed. The occupation has built a segregated road system. Such misinformation is truly unworthy. Despite the title of your organization, you do not speak for Jews around the world at all.
@GabRosenberg @muellerkaderli @afagerbakke As someone with deep connections to Israel, it's sad to see such misguided propaganda of fellow Jewish activists, who blend out the occupation with all its impacts. You may win the publicity while losing the soul of the holy land. We used to be oppressed. We should know better.

@Jonheathcote FWIW, my answer to the original question is I don't know. Just thinking this through.
@Jonheathcote Why is that not happening in the sciences and other disciplines? Econ is an outlier in terms of slowness of publishing process.
@t0nyyates @Jonheathcote If authors send the paper to the same journals in the same order as otherwise, the total number of reports wouldn't change much, unless the paper would have been accepted in the first journal. So question is, how much would authors send to harder journals, involving more rounds.

@ethanbdm @davidhagmann @cblatts I agree that it's an important conversation to have. I wonder though whether it's increasing. My sense was that if anything, e.g. econ's leading journals now have articles from a wider range of authors/universities than in the past. Would be interesting to look at empirically.
@raulpacheco @LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree @EvidenceAction cc @germanrlopez
@raulpacheco @LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree @EvidenceAction Happy to put anyone in touch with the right people if you reach out to me.
@raulpacheco @LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree @EvidenceAction Yes, it would also be great for US policy advocates to come to Zurich &amp; learn from experts here. We started with free needle distribution &amp; ended up with governmental heroin dispensaries for the chronically addicted... We also strongly innovated in complementary social services.
@raulpacheco @LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree @EvidenceAction @AdinaRom Hadn't noticed the typo :)
@wagesofwins @macroeu @causalinf I try to look at these lists as inspiration, rather than competition. About cool stuff that's being done in our profession and things I can learn from to help better inform public policy. It's human to not always succeed at keeping that perspective, but I actively cultivate it.
@ethanbdm @davidhagmann @cblatts My sense is human nature is such that if there was a list about people in anyone's field, and some people on the list were their friends, many people would start to care. See 30 under 30 lists, literature prices, etc.
@raulpacheco @LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree Yes, it's really striking how few people know how many of these strategy were first developed in Switzerland... I know many of the people who were very actively involved in that fight at the time. I think a key reason we were able to get it done was thanks to direct democracy.
@LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @raulpacheco @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree @EvidenceAction cc @AdinaRom
@LeoBeletsky @AIDSPol @raulpacheco @j0ncampbell @SanhoTree Took Switzerland a lot of public debates and political fights too at the time... But it's striking how many people in the US have never even heard yet that this exists in other countries.
@ethanbdm @davidhagmann @cblatts 1) The magazine happens because media care about econ. It's done by a magazine, not by an academic department. 		2) Some departments rank through every students. Most just group them in rough categories for what placement might be a good outcome for them on the job market.

@causalinf @macroeu It's important to know that most people in our field are struggling with this at times, and nobody needs to feel like they are the only ones.		It's worth experimenting to find out what helps us overcome these feelings. E.g. sports, sharing with friends, teamwork, meditation, etc.
@causalinf @macroeu Another thing that I often share with my students and RAs: managing one's anxiety about those things is a skill we can learn, just like other skills. And it's an important skill in academia or any job where we're faced with a lot of critical feedback.
@causalinf @macroeu Repeating this advice I got and that often helps me: focus on what we can learn and what we can contribute. 		This takes the focus off ourselves and our worries about looking good and towards the world and people around us. Helps me remember why I chose econ in the first place.

@dclingi Yes, and also - especially - RAs. While econ PhD students often have a  choice to move between different advisors and are advised by a  committee, RAs are often completely at the mercy of a single supervisor  who will write their key letter for grad school applications.
