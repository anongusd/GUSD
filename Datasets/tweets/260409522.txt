@Stephaniezucel @lydiacachosi Again, you are missing the point.
@Stephaniezucel @lydiacachosi Lucky you. Must be nice. Millones de mexicanos que migraron después de NAFTA no tuvieron esa opción.  No me voy a distraer. La corrupción esta metida en los desarrollos por el PV, las grandes multinacionales, los gringos &amp; los que son complacientes  a la estafa &amp;la gentrificacion
@Stephaniezucel @lydiacachosi I just want to be clear this is not an argument based on xenophobia but in the double whamming that Mexicanos de clase trabajadora face in their lands of origin, then when pushed out to migrate and afterwards if they try to come back after rajarse el lomo toda la vida
@Stephaniezucel @lydiacachosi 30 dollars for taxes. As a non citizen in Minnesota I pay over 15K dollars in a working class suburb. None of that money I can file on my 1040, &amp;these same ex-pats are the anti-immigrant absentee ballots of white people over 50 who predominantly voted for trump. There.Congrats 🙄 https://t.co/9xBw7ZlqYl
@Stephaniezucel @lydiacachosi Oh but now I see, you do real state. That’s what you do. Push out gente humilde so you get thousands of dollars in commissions and house ex-pats on beaches front properties in fisherman towns so you make a profit. I see how it is. How does it feel?
