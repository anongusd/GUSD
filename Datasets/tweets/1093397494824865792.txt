You can't have it both ways! It is either a child with a soul, or it's a useless mass of cells without any rights until it's born (maybe). You can't be a murderer if it isn't a baby! Isn't that what planned parenthood tells expecting women? @benshapiro https://t.co/uCaDsFN4b6

None one has the facts but the FBI and judge..and maybe CNN. I just don't trust anything now.

@Ryu_Raccoon @RepSwalwell @RepMarkTakano @FBI @CNN @realDonaldTrump By video surveillance, they arrived 1 hour before the raid, and set-up their camera 10 minutes before. Pretty coincidental.

@realDonaldTrump someone told @AOC that you can get your agenda passed by hiding it in seemingly minor legislation.. so she was all "like, we need to save the environment.. blah blah..and socialism."
@MattWalshBlog Witch*
@MattWalshBlog Kavanaugh proved to be a with hunt from the start, not unlike the Russian collusion investigation.. this on the other hand is showing more evidence than a forensic files show.
@DonaldJTrumpJr And a brain scan for democrats!
@realDonaldTrump Every time the dems push the envelop of a far left agenda, inevitably we draw closer to removing the blinders of the American people and showing them for what they are - Bought and paid for propagandists for the global powers and world government proponents.
@RepSwalwell @AOC should probably add the humane removal of useless eaters for the betterment of society to her proposal just to be sure no one takes a meal from the people too lazy to work. It's not like we have a booming job growth or record high stocks! Jobs are hard to come by these days!
@RepSwalwell I can't quite make sense in of a free society being chained down to this. Where is the "of the people, for the people, by the people" in this disgusting attempt to socialize a constitutional republic? The constitution IS the RULE OF LAW. Follow your oath. Uphold the constitution.
@KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump The NRA has nearly 5 million members voluntarily providing their funds for the protection of the 2nd amendment. Are you planning to return University of California funds contributed to you? What about Warner media group donations?
