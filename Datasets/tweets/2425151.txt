@dseetharaman @oliviasolon @fbnewsroom This way reviewers can get through what they can during a scheduled shift, without feeling pressured to hit a certain number.
@dseetharaman @oliviasolon @fbnewsroom In years past, our partners would manually pull a set of reports each day for their site to review. This made it seem as if reviewers needed to get through a certain amount of content. We have since changed our process and automatically fill content queues for each office.
@dseetharaman @oliviasolon @fbnewsroom We work with our partners to set targets for how much content each office and language might review ‚Äì to determine staffing ‚Äì but these targets don't apply to people. Our reviewers don't have quotas to meet and we encourage them to take the time they need.

No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission. Some stories have suggested we were shipping over private messages to partners, so we wanted to clarify a few things.
They were clear to users and only available when people logged into these services with FB. We had strict rules in place over how partners could use APIs and what data they could and couldn't access.
The partnerships were experimental and ended years ago. But we publicized the features then because we wanted people to use them: https://t.co/DtZOGljU4z.
‚ÄúDelete access‚Äù meant that if you deleted a message from within Spotify, it would also delete from FB.
At the time, in order for you to write a message to a FB friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify ‚Äúwrite access.‚Äù For you to be able to read messages back, we needed Spotify to have ‚Äúread access.‚Äù
These experiences are common in our industry ‚Äî think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud. Here‚Äôs an example of how it worked if you used Facebook on Spotify: https://t.co/2Zryf4Ck0R
We worked closely with 4 partners (Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, Royal Bank of Canada) to integrate messaging into their products so people could message their FB friends ‚Äî but only if they chose to use FB Login
In the past day, we've been accused of disclosing people's private messages to partners without their knowledge. That's not true ‚Äì and we wanted to provide more facts about our messaging partnerships https://t.co/28cAbkoINx

‚ÄúBy late next yr, we expect to have our systems instrumented to release transparency + enforcement reports every quarter. It's important to report on these community issues at the same frequency as we report our earnings + business results since these issues matter just as much‚Äù
‚ÄúFacebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on our own. In the next year, we're planning to create a new way for people to appeal content decisions to an independent body, whose decisions would be transparent and binding.‚Äù
Some highlights: ‚ÄúWhen left unchecked, people will engage disproportionately with more sensationalist and provocative content‚Ä¶by reducing sensationalism of all forms, we'll create a healthier, less polarized discourse where more people feel safe participating.‚Äù
Our CEO Mark Zuckerberg also wrote a note about how we're approaching content governance and enforcement at a high level: https://t.co/6jqXb4BF4y
We've been investing heavily in people and technology to better remove bad content from our services. Today we published our latest Community Standards Enforcement Report showing how much violating content we‚Äôve detected and removed from April to Sept: https://t.co/Efa2QdewL0

@kevinroose We understand you strongly disagree with our position. We just don‚Äôt think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go. They seem to have YouTube and Twitter accounts too ‚Äì we imagine for the same reason.
@owillis @oliverdarcy Not hard in this instance. But the harder part is deciding what to do with a Page that peddles conspiracy theories big and small. We don‚Äôt think banning them is the right option ‚Äì better to demote posts rated as false and the Pages that spread them.
@TVietor08 The harder question is do you ban Pages (or people) that spread conspiracy theories or misinfo? We believe the better approach is to demote fake news posts, and the Pages that spread them. These guys are allowed YouTube and Twitter accounts too ‚Äì we imagine for the same reason.
@TVietor08 Thanks for the feedback. No-one is defending the harassment of victim‚Äôs families online or offline ‚Äì and we ban pages that repeatedly harass people per our standards.
@oneunderscore__ Sorry you feel that way. The question we face is whether to ban a Page for peddling information debunked by fact-checkers or to demote it so fewer people see it. We‚Äôve chosen the second. Understand that you disagree, and thanks for the feedback.
@oliverdarcy Instead, we demote individual posts etc. that are reported by FB users and rated as false by fact checkers. This means they lose around 80% of any future views. We also demote Pages and domains that repeatedly share false news.
@oliverdarcy We see Pages on both the left and the right pumping out what they consider opinion or analysis ‚Äì but others call fake news. We believe banning these Pages would be contrary to the basic principles of free speech.

@JoshConstine A bug mistakenly deleted some of these associations across Facebook and Messenger, which caused blocks to be lost.
@JoshConstine Hey Josh, it‚Äôs always hard to find the right level of technical detail to put in a blog post like this. More context on what caused the bug: most visible user data on FB is stored in pairs called ‚Äúassociations,‚Äù which control what posts people see and the actions they can take.
@MattRosoff Thanks, Matt. Baby steps.

@NPRinskeep Hi @NPRinskeep We've always been clear that we would find more CA-type apps -- it's why we've suspended over 200 apps we built.
@NPRinskeep 3rd party developers used the Facebook information people shared to build completely new experiences.
@NPRinskeep These integrations are very different from our public APIs -- the goal was to recreate Facebook-like experiences on these devices, and they were tightly controlled.

@zeynep Part of giving people control over their data means enabling them to take their information with them on other services (open platforms vs walled gardens). So you can get your Facebook on B‚Äôberry or your Gmail on iPhone. What do you feel is different with these FB integrations?
@zeynep Hi @Zeynep.  Interested in your thoughts here:	 	You can import Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, etc. onto your iPhone -- see attached screenshot. This means if you send an email to someone‚Äôs Gmail, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll read it on Apple‚Äôs app. https://t.co/PgD6pwOa5U

@nickconfessore @nytimes Partners could only integrate someone's FB information with their device if that person had given their permission. And contrary to claims by NYT, friends' information ‚Äî for example birthdays or photos ‚Äî was only shared if that friend had permitted it in their settings.
@nickconfessore @nytimes Our partnership and engineering teams approved all these integrations. We are not aware of any abuse by these companies.
@nickconfessore @nytimes We controlled these APIs tightly from the get-go. Partners signed agreements which prevented them using Facebook information for any other purpose than to create Facebook-like experiences.

To start, we are launching appeals for posts that were removed for nudity / sexual activity, hate speech, or graphic violence. We are also working to extend this process further over time to support more violation types.
Our policies are only as good as our enforcement ‚Äì and we know our enforcement isn‚Äôt always perfect. To fix this, we are going to build out the ability for people to appeal our decisions over the next year.
One of the top questions we‚Äôre asked is how do we decide what content is allowed on Facebook. To provide clarity and invite feedback and participation from our community, we are publishing our internal enforcement guidelines for the first time today. https://t.co/CdN2WLstSG
