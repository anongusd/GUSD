The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, with $3 billion permanently lost. It devastated federal workers &amp; negatively impacted the American people. It’s unconscionable that @RealDonaldTrump is already threatening a 2nd shutdown if he doesn’t get his border wall.

The President is using #DREAMers &amp; #TPS recipients as political pawns while trying to put taxpayers on the hook for a $5.7 billion wall he promised Mexico would pay for. Unacceptable! It’s now day 29 of the #TrumpShutdown. Enough is enough. @realDonaldTrump must reopen the gov’t.

Today is #VeteransDay, the day we honor those who served our nation. But it should be more than just today that we pay tribute to these brave men &amp; women. We should show our appreciation throughout the year! To all our #veterans, thank you for defending &amp; protecting our freedom.

Another mass shooting &amp; more senseless tragedies, this time in #ThousandOaks, CA. This rampant gun violence across our nation has taken too many lives. It is unacceptable &amp; has got to stop. Congress must take action to #EndGunViolence. Praying for all who have been impacted.
Wishing a happy #Diwali to everybody celebrating here in New York and throughout the world! As we mark this year’s holiday, I wish harmony, prosperity, and hope to all who observe the festival of lights.

I’ll be watching this trial closely and will continue to stand against including this question on the upcoming census. 2/3
The trial on @SecretaryRoss’ decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census is getting underway today in NYC. Glad that SCOTUS on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s effort to postpone it. 1/3

Appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s threat to end #birthrightcitizenship. #POTUS can’t just throw out the 14th Amendment because he doesn’t like it. This is just another tactic that is part of his larger anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/Y9nHuSjh0j
We must all speak out against these heinous acts and do everything possible to combat hate in whatever form in takes. Please keep the victims, their families and the entire Tree of Life congregation in your thoughts and prayers. 2/2
There is no place in our society for hate and anti-Semitism. This assault on the Jewish community is an attack on us all and must be denounced by every single American. 1/2
Once again, gun violence has caused another tragedy. No place is safe. Disgusted by this cowardly &amp; evil attack at a synagogue. I send prayers to all who are impacted &amp; stand with the people of #Pittsburgh &amp; all in the Jewish community. This senseless gun violence must end!

Critical for a probe of Secretary Ross to move forward. We must have a full accounting of what happened regarding his decision to add a citizenship question. #2020Census. 3/3
Secretary Ross must be held accountable for not telling the truth to Congress. Last week, I urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Ross and now I’m calling on Sessions to recuse himself due to comments that reflect his bias on the issue. #2020Census. 2/3 https://t.co/iCmElvUslG
Terrible decision by #SCOTUS that for now will shield @SecretaryRoss from answering questions about adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. During a hearing, the Secretary lied to me about the origins of including the question on the Census. https://t.co/abpYJTCsTv 1/3

Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East and Democrats are committed to its safety and security. U.S. support for America’s friend and partner should never be made into a partisan issue.
Spoke with #NPR’s @hansilowang about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. Unconscionable that @SecretaryRoss lied to my face during a Congressional hearing on the issue. https://t.co/01kU0xA4At
Hate being lied to! Very displeased to learn that @SecretaryRoss lied to me on the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census at a hearing this spring. Not a tough question, but I guess when you’re in company with Steven Bannon, you’ve got to cover it up? https://t.co/D8IHUL6pbf
Proud to join @RepJudyChu’s bill that would defund @DHSgov’s proposed public charge rule. This proposed rule seeks to deny green cards to immigrants who lawfully use public benefits.  This is wrong. #ProtectFamilies

Sent a letter to the head of the @EPA expressing concern over the possible closure or minimized role of the Office of Children’s Health Protection, which has argued for tougher regulations on industrial pollutants. Trump Admin. must not abandon efforts to keep our kids safe. https://t.co/6hxpKSJcls

Deeply opposed to Trump's proposal to deny green cards to immigrants who legally use public benefits. It will harm immigrant families by prioritizing the wealthy &amp; scare immigrant families away from critical programs that help children &amp; parents thrive. #ProtectFamilies
More sexual misconduct allegations against Judge #Kavanaugh further illustrate the need for an FBI investigation. The Senate Judiciary Committee must halt the confirmation process to give law enforcement the time it needs to conduct a thorough &amp; rigorous investigation.

Deeply disappointed by the Trump administration’s proposal to cap the number of refugees resettled in the U.S. at 30K people in 2019. This is a drastic one-third reduction from the 45K-person limit that was set for 2018. Turning our backs on refugees is wrong. #RefugeesWelcome

In revoking salary increases for federal workers, President Trump is once again sticking it to the middle class. Federal employees live in our communities, contribute to our local economy &amp; provide us with essential services. The President should reverse his decision.

My third amendment allows detained parents who have been separated from their children to make free phone calls to their kids. The measure also allows these parents to confer with counsel over the phone at no cost as well. #KeepFamiliesTogether 4/5
My second amendment requires @DHSgov forms that detained individuals must sign – including those used by @ICEgov &amp; @CBP – to be printed fully in Spanish &amp; English. Must ensure those detained at the border &amp; elsewhere can understand what they’re signing. #KeepFamiliesTogether 3/5
My first amendment requires the @DHSgov Inspector General to issue a report on @FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria in #PuertoRico. Critical to have a detailed accounting of how the administration responded to the storm &amp; learn what improvements can be made in the future. 2/5

Sad to learn about the death of Guy Molinari. As a Congressman, Assemblyman and Borough President, he fought tirelessly for his constituents and became a legendary figure in NYC politics. Deepest condolences to his family and friends.
I’m outraged over the latest revelation that the administration lied to Congress about the origins of the citizenship question. @SecretaryRoss must come clean and remove the citizenship question from the #2020Census. https://t.co/fKdGTc6u2L
Great to join @APAICS &amp; @NielsenKnows for panel discussion on recent Nielsen report “Asian Pacific Americans: Digital Lives &amp; Growing Influence,” which revealed that Asian Americans continue to grow as digital influencers &amp; outpace other ethnic groups in growth &amp; spending power. https://t.co/gfrw6LYurm

Pres. Trump just nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy. We need someone who will protect voting rights, fight for women’s reproductive rights &amp; defend the rights of the LGBT community. I urge my Senate colleagues to reject him.

It is critical for ALL stakeholders to have a place at the table when considering major policy changes, &amp; that includes engaging the Asian American community in NYC. Asian Americans make up almost 15% of the city’s population &amp; our voices must be heard. https://t.co/bysjlDHtKA

Spoke w/ Rep. Bordallo, Vice-Speaker Therese Terlaje of the Guam Legislature &amp; radiation compensation advocate &amp; veteran Robert Celestial on helping veterans who were exposed to radiation get the treatment they deserve. Shameful that these veterans have not received proper care.
I wholeheartedly agree with @SenGillibrand’s position that we need to ditch Trump’s shortlist of SCOTUS candidates. I hope the Senate will reject his list &amp; support someone who has bipartisan support. We need a strong candidate who will fight for every American.
I’m appalled by #SCOTUS’ 5-4 ruling that will undermine the collective bargaining power of public sector unions. This will harm their ability to fight for workers’ rights. Proud to stand w/ unions &amp; support their critical work for working families. #Janus
With Congressional colleagues discussing our trip to the U.S.-Mexico border. Still trying to process all that I saw. Children in cages &amp; mothers who have no idea where their kids were taken are images I cannot get out of my head. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/etJ3czjOH4

RT @NY1: #Queens @RepGraceMeng described conditions that some have called inhumane. https://t.co/50irnM4v92
Most of these mothers say they dealt w/ horrendous conditions to get to the US, fleeing violence from gangs &amp; cartels. But they say their real nightmare began when they arrived here &amp; had their children taken away from them under @RealDonaldTrump's policy. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Just left the Port Isabel ICE Detention Center. Met with about 30 mothers who were separated from their children. All were crying or had tears in their eyes. Most don’t know where their kids are. I talk about my meeting with them in the video below. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/QGMdWu0nMY

Thanks @CongBoyle for introducing the Reunite Children With Their Parents Act. Proud to support this critical bill. We need to reunite the 2,300 separated children with their families. If this bill becomes law, it would require @DHSgov to reunite separated families in 60 days.
Families separated by this administration must be reunited as soon as possible &amp; I call on @RealDonaldTrump to put forward an official plan to do so. It is unacceptable &amp; inhumane that families continue to remain apart. Their nightmares must end. #KeepFamiliesTogether 2/2
.@RealDonaldTrump failed to include in his executive order any explanation on how &amp; when to reunite the estimated 2,300 children who were removed from their parents &amp; I’m deeply troubled-dismayed that a day after he signed it, there is still no clear plan to reunite families. 1/2
I hope that this important pilot program will be implemented in all NYC schools. I also want to thank @ChaimDeutsch, @TeachAdvocacy, @info_safest15 and @Baag_USA for their steadfast leadership and support on this issue. 2/2

Pleased to see the Senate rejected Pres. Trump’s plan to rescind almost $15 billion in previously approved spending. Almost half of that amount would be from the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

President Trump lied about his ability to stop his shameful policy of ripping children from their parents.  I want to know exactly how and when these families will be reunited, because at this point the President and his entire administration are untrustworthy. https://t.co/P3bJDXG2Qi
Proud to be an original cosponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. We need to stop this administration’s practice of family separation. Families belong together &amp; separating children &amp; parents is cruel. Thanks to @RepJerryNadler for introducing the bill. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Today is Juneteenth, an annual celebration that marks the end of slavery in America. Since then, our path to building a more perfect union has experienced progress and setbacks. Our journey is not complete. Juneteenth demonstrates the promise of a better future.

Today is the 55th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act which was supposed to ensure equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. Unfortunately, women are still paid less than men despite doing similar work. That isn’t right &amp; we must continue to fight for equal pay for equal work.
The census happens once a decade &amp; it’s critical that we have an accurate count of everyone. Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census is a bad idea. It’s unsettling to learn @SecretaryRoss knew that adding this question would be costly &amp; harm the quality of the count. https://t.co/diFwNonpuX
Pleased that the agency is working to tackle these problems and I will continue to make sure that officials follow through on resolving these issues. The @USPS must rebuild trust with borough residents. 2/2

#Paidleavemeans access to needed time off no matter where you live or work. The #FAMILYAct would set a national standard and advance the FMLA’s vision of more equitable and family friendly workplaces. #FMLA25
The FMLA has meant many workers can take needed time off without having to worry about losing their jobs or health insurance. But what about those who risk financial insecurity? That’s why we need #paidleave. #FMLA25
Twenty-five years after the FMLA was signed, people need #paidleave, and a national plan like the #FAMILYAct would benefit them and their families, businesses and the economy. #Paidleave means everybody wins. #FMLA25
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was signed 25 years ago. It was an important step forward for America’s families, but #paidleavemeans fulfilling the promise of more equitable and family friendly workplaces. #FMLA25
