In closing, guests discuss importance of performance-based funding. Cox credits #utleg for investing in education. #HinckleyReport @KUED
"What we have in Utah is not an income tax problem, but a sales tax problem." - Kristen Cox. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol #utleg @UtahGOMB
On "Our Schools Now" @maxroth says people say they want more money for schools and will pay more taxes, but it never passes on ballot. @KUED
@SenatorSteveU: Governor has always pushed for education funding, but there's only one place to find additional money--citizens' wallets.
.@maxroth responds, "But we are losing teachers..." Cox says, "it's a teacher retention issue more than a teacher shortage." #HinckleyReport
Kristen Cox says we look at more than per pupil spending to analyze education success. Amazing families &amp; teachers; we need to support them.
Kristen Cox of @UtahGOMB: "Utah is in a fortunate position--high performing economy, income growth looks great."#HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
@SenatorSteveU: "Congress has to investigate Trump‚Äôs campaign links to Russia or they will answer for it in next election." #HinckleyReport
"As a reporter, I'm pretty pro leak", says @maxroth on Chaffetz's intent to investigate leaks happening with Michael Flynn #HinckleyReport
Cox thinks Tea Party is now irrelevant. @SenatorSteveU disagrees, says their success broadened into control of White House and Congress.
.@maxroth agrees w/ @jperryesq that Trump resistance is similar to Tea Party movement. In 2010, Utah was ground zero. #HinckleyReport @KUED
"The energy out there is phenomenal. I think it's the job of our leaders to move that energy into progress."- @SenatorSteveU #HinckleyReport https://t.co/OdhpHdVJXk
Re. Trump "resistance" movement, Kristen Cox says advocates need to find solutions, not just point out problems. #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@maxroth would like to remind Utah delegation that their congressional districts are not filled w/ people who voted Trump. #HinckleyReport https://t.co/VE9uujGjc0
.@maxroth reminds us that Chaffetz disagreed with this Republican statement; his town hall was not violent, no intimidation. #HinckleyReport
.@SenatorSteveU on GOP media advisory says, "James Evans has two kinds of ideas: bad ideas and really bad ides."#HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
Conversation turns to James Evans' GOP advisory to stop having town halls. @maxroth says it's "riddled with untruths."#HinckleyReport @KUED
.@SenatorSteveU weighs in, says PLI didn't go through because Trump was elected &amp; Obama needed to sign document right away. #HinckleyReport
.@maxroth on #BearsEars argues Obama took the same 1.3 million acres from PLI. Cox refutes--  Obama took the idea but not the specifics.
.@maxroth feels that OR and Gov. Herbert represent two clashing sides. Kristen Cox disagrees, argues they share same goal to protect lands.
RT @KUED: Re: @outdoorretailer, @MaxRoth argues, "energy companies are at the top of [the] list‚Äù when it comes to campaign donations #Hinck‚Ä¶
.@jperryesq asks why, if Utah cares so much about public lands, was this message not received by Outdoor Retailers?#HinckleyReport @KUED
RT @KUED: Have Republicans failed to explain the importance of public lands? Kristen Cox admits, ‚Äúthe rhetoric and tone could change‚Äù #Hinc‚Ä¶
Kristen Cox agrees with @SpencerJCox that the rhetoric on public lands is often too focused on states' rights. #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@SenatorSteveU argues that public lands are supposed to be managed for multiple use, not just recreation. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
On OR departure from Utah, Kristen Cox says "we cannot have an entire state policy dictated by one industry." #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol https://t.co/VYshwnfqGH
RT @KUED: On OR, @SenatorSteveU says ORs‚Äô position clashed w/ Utahns‚Äô, government shouldn't allow itself to be leveraged by 1 business #Hin‚Ä¶
.@maxroth brings up campaign finances spent by oil and gas industry. Outdoor industry has been worried about this for a long time. @KUED
@SenatorSteveU: Basically the message of the OR is, "shut up". They've been wanting to leave for years. More vulgar display he‚Äôs ever seen.
First topic for tonight: Outdoor Retailers leave Utah. @jperryesq	asks, "Did we just play a game of chicken and lose?" #HinckleyReport @KUED

@LaVarrWebb doesn‚Äôt think the ban is religious bigotry, but it wasn‚Äôt rolled out well, very clumsy how it all happened #HinckleyReport @KUED

55% of Utahns are opposed to refugee ban &amp; @GovHerbert welcomed last refugee family to Utah on twitter. Why is Utah in this position? @KUED
.@gopTODD: Trump's order never uses the word Muslim. There's 2 dozen Muslim-dominant countries that aren't in it's scope. #HinckleyReport

.@jperryesq makes the point that many of Trump's decisions have been made without a full cabinet. Is this a lack of people and process?@KUED

.@juliaritchey on education ballot initiative: The idea is that you attract businesses by good schools they can send their kids to. @KUED
.@mattcanham re: Count My Vote: This is the 2nd time prominent Utahns have said, "Legislature take action or we're going to the initiative."
.@jperryesq brings up 55% approval for tax increase for education. @BoydMatheson says legislature won't be happy about ballot initiative.
.@BoydMatheson: Big debate on education funding--we don't need destruction of public ed, but we need "disruptive innovation" #HinckleyReport
.@BoydMatheson: Dialogue around education will definitely increase as session starts. @BetsyDeVos will be a disruptor to the system. @KUED
.@mattcanham: Utah Legislature issues that could be affected by Trump include medicaid expansion infrastructure needs. #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@jperryesq: Will any of Trump's 'big ideas' have an effect on the Utah Legislative session? @juliaritchey says it's to be determined. @KUED
.@BoydMatheson, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt believe American people are nearly as divided as political leaders want them to believe. @KUED
.@mattcanham says protests are a signal that this is a time of great division in our country. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@jperryesq turns to the protests in  Washington. @juliaritchey mentions the 600 Utah women marching in D.C. &amp; thousands more in Utah. @KUED
Other Utahns at #inauguration were @MormonTabChoir and @PianoGuys, despite controversy and divided reactions, according to @mattcanham @KUED
.@juliaritchey: Hatch was ‚Äúdesignated survivor‚Äù should something terrible happen. He is pro tempore and 4th in line. #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@BoydMatheson says presidential approval rating is normally used as political capital, but Trump is unconventional, he will do whatever.
.@mattcanham: Trump's somber, ominous tones of "American Carnage" do not resonate with Utahns. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@mattcanham predicts Trump's low (46%) approval rating will go up in Utah. Republicans &amp; Independents will give him a chance, but not Dems.
.@BoydMatheson: A transportation bill could make Dems happy, but may fracture Republicans. Interesting needle to thread to keep GOP happy.
.@juliaritchey cites @SenMikeLee's writings on marrying Republican conservatism with populism. "There will be a lot of Congress Tug-of-War".
.@jperryesq asks, "What are implications for us if federalism really is a theme? @BoydMatheson cites #BearsEars as a potential discussion.
.@mattcanham: What happens when the GOP Congress and GOP Pres. disagree? Trump talks of unity as if it will naturally occur. @KUED #utpol
.@jperryesq: How does Trump accomplish these things when he needs all those people sitting behind him? How does he get Congress on board?
.@BoydMatheson: Trump validated those that voted for him. Federalism component to his work. Start trusting the people, not government. @KUED
.@juliaritchey saw a lot reactions on twitter that Trump's speech was very similar to RNC. Feels like he's still campaigning #HinckleyReport
.@juliaritchey on inauguration: 'He definitely took on the populist rhetoric tone that won him the nomination, setting high bar for himself'
.@mattcanham: "He was very critical of the establishment, who was sitting right behind him during speech, which makes that kind of awkward."
.@mattcanham says basic premise of speech is to set idealogical tone of presidency; Trump did some of that. 'America First' was a big theme.
Tonight's #HinckleyReport discussion begins with Trump's #Inauguration speech. What did he need to do and did he accomplish it? @KUED #utpol

@GlenMillsABC4: People didn‚Äôt have a say in choosing locations. Even some members of City Council think process wasn‚Äôt transparent.

@GlenMillsABC4: 	Republicans want Obamacare repealed, but know they can‚Äôt push it through a straight party vote. Need some support from Dems
Perry on Obamacare and Congress this week: Obama asks Dems to preserve his legacy. Republicans say oh no, we're getting rid of this thing!
.@judyfutah on Trump's twitter tactics: Excluding media is a hazard. Without reporters, public can be left out of important information.
.@GlenMillsABC4 in reply to @DamonCann saying Trump's response to ethics vote was presidential: "Except that it was all done on twitter...."
@DamonCann: Trump actually comes out of this situation looking kind of presidential, which is shocking to many people. #HinckleyReport
.@judyfutah points to irony of Trump's accusations at Congress on ethics issue when his morals have been all over the news in recent months.
.@DamonCann:"The first thing you do when you enter office should never be to loosen the ethics restrictions that confine you." #utpol  @KUED
.@DamonCann on House Ethics Committee vote: "Someone is always paying attention when you are an elected official." #HinckleyReport @KUED
Perry turns conversation to Congress. House voted to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics on Monday. What were they thinking?
.@GlenMillsABC4: Whoever Trump appoints to SCOTUS could play a key role in these types of land lawsuits. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@GlenMillsABC4 points to the role of legal action in the #BearsEars issue. Says @seanreyesag will declare a lawsuit. @KUED #HinckleyReport
.@judyfutah: every single inch of what's in the monument is already controlled by Forest Service and BLM. What's changing is the management.
.@DamonCann on public lands in San Juan County: it's a calamity in many ways. 90% of land in county is controlled and restricted by govt.
Perry: Trump cannot remove the designation, so what can he do?  	@DamonCann: He may change the rules and restrictions on the use of the land
.@judyfutah: A pres. has never undone an Antiquities Act decision. @GlenMillsABC4: but if there was ever one to do it, wouldn't it be Trump?
.@GlenMillsABC4: How is Trump going to respond? Bishop and Lee have both met with him on #BearsEars. He is the ‚ÄúX‚Äù factor &amp; wild card. @KUED
.@judyfutah on challenging #BearsEars: there was a similar case w/ Grand Staircase Escalante, but hard to tell what will happen this time.
@GlenMillsABC4: the biggest battle cry from Utah's delegation-- Obama has never even stepped foot on the land in #BearsEars #HinckleyReport
Perry: Is it a process problem, political problem, or legal problem? @DamonCann: All of the above. People felt they weren't part of process. https://t.co/ql01qgBuFL
.@GlenMillsABC4: Utahns do not like the federal govt. controlling 2/3 of their land. Local government is best equipped to manage it. #utpol
.@GlenMillsABC4: 1) usage is different from PLI and the designation of a monument 2) it's a parting shot from Obama at Utah #HinckleyReport https://t.co/W4cylJNchP

.@RobertGehrke: with McMullin in the race it was such a strange dynamic--something that we hadn't seen before here or nationally. @KUED
At the end of the day, Utah voters really didn't like Donald Trump, but they really didn't like Hillary Clinton even more - @RobertGehrke
.@juliaritchey: Bernie's success in western states meant trouble for Clinton, so there was a lot of attention to that region this year.
.@RobertGehrke asks why Clinton tried to pull a Hail Mary in Utah by placing 5 staff here, but neglected Wisconsin &amp; Nevada. @KUED
.@RodArquette:	The Trump factor and @Evan_McMullin factor both played into this. Many Utahns don't think Trump as conservative as he claims.
Perry starts off asking panel why Utah was relevant in the 2016 election with only 3 million people and 6 electoral votes? #HinckleyReport

Last topic of night: Homelessness in Utah. @Gochnour gives kudos to Gail Miller, Biskupski, Speaker Hughes, and McAdams for their efforts.
Where does the Governor stand on Bears Ears? @Gochnour says he will do everything he can to leverage power and benefit for the state of Utah
.@briancarlsontv: I don't understand the drive behind Bears Ears. @Gochnour: Obama has the power and some people like it, so he will do it.
.@Gochnour refers back to the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument designation and it's negative effect on local constituents. #HinckleyReport
Decker: It's concerning that Obama would come in and designate land without approval of state delegation. Makes people distrust federal gov.
Panel now talking National Monuments and Governor Herbert's address #HinckleyReport
.@briancarlsontv notes that Utah does have strong members in US Congress that will combat Trump on issues like F-35. #HinckleyReport
.@Gochnour it's more than just us, the President-Elect needs to change his behavior (referring to tweets). #HinckleyReport
@briancarlsontv: Utah needs to figure out how we handle social media and public opinion. #HinckleyReport
It's concerning when a president's tweets make the stock market go up and down on a whim. #HinckleyReport #utpol @KUED
Panel turns to Trump's tweets. Decker: "Up until now, Journalists set the agenda for news. Now, Trump controls news through his tweets."
.@Gochnour: "There's certain to be trouble ahead" - referring to a few of Trump's cabinet picks. #HinckleyReport #utpol @KUED
Decker says Dems are not going to like Trump's picks for Supreme Court. @briancarlsontv agrees that these will have longer-lasting effects.
Perry: If Romney had eaten more "humble pie" would he be Secretary of State? #HinckleyReport  @KUED #utpol
RT @KUED: .@Gochnour on Pruitt for @EPA: Pruitt will have his hands full, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll be challenged to get very far‚Äù #HinckleyReport @HinckleyIn‚Ä¶
@briancarlsontv: Romney knew he would have to eat some "humble pie" in the public opinion (referring to possible Sec. of State spot).
.@briancarlsontv likes the way that Romney handled the approach, speaks to his commitment to giving meaningful service to America and party.
Decker is glad Romney wasn't picked. It saved him 4 years of trouble and humiliation. #HinckleyReport
.@Gochnour would have preferred to see Mitt Romney chosen as Sec. of State but is willing to give the Trump administration an open mind.
Decker: "This is an administration that prides itself in little government experience. People voted for Trump to beat up on Washington."
RT @KUED: How does #RussiaHacking relate to Rex Tillerson appt? @Gochnour says oil ties to Russia could raise questions #HinckleyReport @Hi‚Ä¶
Perry: What happens when you have both Trump and Tillerson with no government experience?
.@briancarlsontv claims many are concerned w/ Tillerson's potential to take control over Trump's policies and lack of govt. experience.
Panel talks about Rex Tillerson as Sec. of State pick. He has close ties to Putin, but @Gochnour doesn't mind his business acumen.
Perry: So why is Trump not leading this investigation if it's a bi-partisan issue? Decker thinks it may reflect poorly on his election.
.@Gochnour on Russian hack: It's a bi-partisan issue of national security and worthy of congressional investigation #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@briancarlsontv says Putin likes to shake things up, but we can't say he bought the election. No way to have widespread takeover of system.
Perry opens show by discussing the Russian hack and it's role in the election. Decker: The very best journalists get the leaks. #utpol

Panel agrees that though Utahns may be sad about Amazon sales tax deal, it will move Utah in right direction. #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@RepBrianKing: I am the "Super Minority Leader" &amp; b/c Utah GOP is fractured, critical bills need Dem votes to pass. #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@dfoxley says minority caucus is great but "meaningless."  @RepBrianKing response: "Talk about passive aggressive!" #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@RepBrianKing: I'm concerned about public and higher ed funding because performance is slipping. Current efforts may not be enough. #utpol
.@RepBrianKing: If Trump tried to create a process to keep &amp; attract businesses to Utah-I would love it. But we don't want crony capitalism.
Perry: How would Utahns react if Trump tried to broker a deal to keep jobs or companies in the state? #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@jrpjrpjrp: Trump's actions with Carrier in Indiana should be considered a protection racket. It is not sustainable. #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@RepBrianKing: If someone disagrees with me, they aren't "inherently evil," they are "inherently wrong." #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@dfoxley: Obama has stymied progress by "executive fiat." If someone disagrees they're considered "inherently evil." #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@RepBrianKing: government and business are out to accomplish fundamentally different things. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@jrpjrpjrp agrees there are differences, but one similarity is that we want capable people running both. #HinckleyReport
Perry asks panel: Can you run government like a business? @dfoxley says there are differences but we will be pleasantly surprised at Trump.
.@RepBrianKing thinks Huntsman won't get the job because it will go to someone with more of a personal connection. #HinckleyReport @KUED
Perry asks @jrpjrpjrp to compare Huntsman to other possible candidates.There are different camps, but Huntsman could help w/ Taiwan
.@dfoxley says John Huntsman Jr. would be exceptional at Secretary of State. He was born and bred for this. Has a great shot #HinckleyReport
.@RepBrianKing is worried that Trump has poisoned the well before he has even started. Not confident in his ability to act with finesse.
.@dfoxley on Trump: Occasionally you have to get someone out there who is going to make a difference. #HinckleyReport
.@jrpjrpjrp says that the issue of Taiwan is very important to China. Must be addressed in a measured manner. #HinckleyReport
.@RepBrianKing thinks it's sad how Trump humiliated Romney. @jrpjrpjrp says its a noble thing to be willing to serve as Sec. of State.
Perry turns to Huntsman as a prospect for the position. @RepBrianKing says he would be great b/c he has experience with China, which is key.
.@jrpjrpjrp thinks Romney is willing to put himself out there if it means he could save America, even if he is defeated. #HinckleyReport
.@jrpjrpjrp thinks Trump cares about loyalty and since Romney was a vocal opponent, this will hurt his chances. #HinckleyReport
.@RepBrianKing doesn't see any way that Romney will be Secretary of State. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@dfoxley answering Jason Perry's real question about who will be Sec. of State: Nobody in their right mind thinks Trump will pick Romney.
If Romney were chosen for Secretary of State, he would make Trump look good, says @dfoxley @KUED #HinckleyReport #utpol
Jason Perry: The list of names for Sec.of State keeps changing. When will we know? #HinckleyReport #utpol
.@dougfoxley: we could probably go without a Secretary of State because we haven't actually had one the past 8 years.

Perry turns to the Senate 2018 race. #HinckleyReport
.@RichMcKeown says We were constantly leading the nation in voter turnout. People like voting by mail. CMV targets voter turnout.
.@kirkjowers says Count My Vote will have a tremendous impact. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
Perry ‚Äì Voter turnout in Utah is 57%, still 38th in the country but improving. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@kirkjowers: Perhaps nation‚Äôs work will go forward through Pence and McConnell. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
@kirkjowers: Trump wants to be King more than Prime Minister, we aren‚Äôt given the sense that he wants to govern. #HinckleyReport
.@tvheidihatch says it's brilliant how Trump controls media but will have to change. He has to make friends at some point. #HinckleyReport
.@RichMcKeown: Trump goes directly to the people- bypassing the press. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@kirkjowers says 	‚ÄúVictory tour‚Äù is classic Trump. Consistent with the campaign. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@RichMcKeown: HHS Secretary is a solid pick. Repealing Obama Care is hard, GOP doesn't	want to deal with Health Care same way as the Dems.
Perry: Is Trump draining the swamp or just filling it with new alligators? #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol @jperryesq
@tvheidihatch: Hard for Romney to admit defeat. @RichMcKeown: 	Romney‚Äôs optimistic view of the future is apt. #HinckleyReport
.@kirkjowers: Romney is smart. He is looking to the future of the nation. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@RichMcKeown: 	We will learn a lot about Trump if this is the direction he goes. Could also be a grand humiliation for Romney.
Jason asks panel: If Trump picks Romney, what does that say about him? #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@RichMcKeown: Trump is excellent at controlling attention. He was most interesting candidate every day of the election cycle.
.@tvheidihatch on Conway: Is she acting out or does Trump know what she is doing? Is this Romney getting spanked? #HinckleyReport
@kirkjowers: the process is ahead of schedule ‚Äì in many ways the dog has caught the car. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol

.@SenatorLuz says that you can't run a campaign just for women or just for men. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@MichelleMumford agrees that it can be a challenge to navigate academic achievement and motherhood. #HinckleyReport
Does the religious culture in Utah send a conflicting message to women in Utah about running for office? #HinckleyReport
.@MichelleMumford: where are the women in Trump's proposed cabinet? We keep hearing men. We need to REQUIRE women to run, not just encourage
.@JenniferDobner thinks Hillary was really talking about country over partisanship. All need to work together to become active citizens.
.@MichelleMumford thinks the speech has also resonated with Republican women. Women should be encouraged to finish college and get involved.
"Hillary will be a huge figure in our history whether you like her or not." - @SenatorLuz #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@morganlyoncotti turns to Clinton's concession speech. She said democracy demands participation all the time. Will Utah heed that call?
@SenatorLuz: 	"I have already seen it!"  People on social media are encouraging others and asking how they can get involved! #HinckleyReport
We have to remember the legacy of the late Becky Lockhart. When will we have another great Republican woman in leadership at legislature?
.@MichelleMumford: Men and those in leadership need to encourage women to run. This would make a huge impact on the state. #HinckleyReport
But there is a recruitment problem, says @morganlyoncotti. What can the Republican party do to recruit more women? #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@JenniferDobner: Utah is making a good effort to get more women into every level of government. #HinckleyReport @KUED
Democrats put a lot of women on the ballot. It‚Äôs not just about having good and bad candidates, it‚Äôs about the districting - @SenatorLuz
It‚Äôs unfair to have a conversation about gender without talking about gerrymandering. @SenatorLuz
.@morganlyoncotti concludes that we have a fractured sisterhood. We don‚Äôt have one party for all women. #HinckleyReport
.@SenatorLuz: It's important to remember that although white women in the blue collar bracket voted for Trump, Hillary won the minority vote
According to @JenniferDobner: "Just because we are all women, doesn‚Äôt mean that we all have the same view on issues." #HinckleyReport
.@MichelleMumford: As campaigners, you have to appeal to all people. It has to be the right candidate, regardless of gender. #HinckleyReport
There are other important issues to women, says @MichelleMumford, like the economy. Many middle class women manage the checkbooks.
.@JenniferDobner: there are still many women not ready for another woman in the White House &amp; who want to defer to men to make the decisions
.@morganlyoncotti then asks panel why women who voted for Trump did not feel as affected by the sexual assault issue? #HinckleyReport
"It‚Äôs eye-opening and alarming that there is still a culture of assault in this country." @SenatorLuz on Trump video. #HinckleyReport
What was Ivanka‚Äôs role in apologizing for videos? @SenatorLuz thinks it showed a human side of Donald Trump. Afterall, he is her father.
.@JenniferDobner: Government doesn‚Äôt function the same as business. There will be hiccups. Trump can't just let his kids run the show. @KUED
Panel agrees that American‚Äôs love the story of people working their way up to the office. Not the idea that they are entitled to office.
What about other women? Would Michelle Obama or Chelsea Clinton ever go for office? @MichelleMumford: this still shows a "dynasty" problem.
Another part of it was that some people in the country just weren't ready for a woman to have that job, says @JenniferDobner #HinckleyReport
.@JenniferDobner: more than a gender issue, perhaps people had electoral fatigue with the Clinton "dynasty". #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@morganlyoncotti says research shows that women need to feel overqualified to be in public office, which was a theme of Clinton's campaign.
Hillary didn't talk in a way that  assumed she would win. "If I am fortunate to be your president" Instead of "I will be your president"
.@MichelleMumford agrees that that people expect different, often unreasonable things from women. #HinckleyReport
Panel agrees that there were victories for women, but "we aren't there yet". #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@SenatorLuz also fears that Hillary's campaign may have been too crafted and careful. The real her was lost. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
.@SenatorLuz: it's unfortunate that there were so many conversations about Hillary's lipstick and clothes.  That doesn't happen with the men
According to @SenatorLuz, women have different campaign standards. They can't be too aggressive, but they can't seem too weak either. @KUED
Panel discusses Clinton's campaign strategies and standards as a woman. Why did she always say "if" instead of "when" I am president? #utpol
.@JenniferDobner thinks the election was both a loss and a success. It's definitely a major victory when a major party nominates a woman.
Regardless of party affiliation, it is exciting for women to see Hillary Clinton nominated. It shows advances for women says @JenniferDobner
Dr. @morganlyoncotti asserts that the election didn't end up as historic for women as many hoped. What do panelists say? #HinckleyReport

That's it for this week! The discussion closes with a tribute to award-winning journalist and reporter @gwenifill. #HinckleyReport @KUED
RT @KUED: We can't believe she is gone! We will miss her influence and professionalism greatly. https://t.co/zoHdiPICkc
RT @KUED: With a lot of the ballots coming in for #Utah, a lot of people held out until the very end to make their decision. #HinckleyReport
RT @KUED: How many people voted strictly for the party? Also a lot of people who just didn't want to vote. #HinckleyReport
.@WhittneyE adds that many people didn't really want to vote. "We don't want to get caught up in this" #HinckleyReport
Panelists agree that many people waited until last minute to cast their votes. There was a lot of uncertainty. #HinckleyReport
There's discord and disfunction in both parties in Utah. Many people aren't buying what they are selling, says @BoydMatheson @HinckleyReport
.@WhittneyE: the electoral college has typically favored the Republicans. Maine &amp;Nebraska are looking for ways around the electoral college
.@BoydMatheson if we relied just on the popular vote, candidates would only campaign in New York and California. @HinckleyReport
.@SchottHappens: the electoral college does protect rural states, but the problem now is that only a few states are worth campaigning for.
Now discussing the electoral college. @WhittneyE thinks the proposals to abolish it have almost no chance of succeeding. @HinckleyReport
Utahns will be watching out for Trump's tone. @BoydMatheson thinks both Trump and Obama both love campaigning more than governing.
Panel discussing names for Trump's cabinet. @BoydMatheson thinks these names say a lot on what Trump plans to do about immigration.
.@SchottHappens "Speaker Hughes and Donald Trump Junior are basically BFFs" #HinckleyReport
.@BoydMatheson says most battles in Washington are not just left and right.
Perry: How do you really drain the swamp? .@SchottHappens: it will be a huge source of tension. #HinckleyReport
Donald Trump is a pragmatist. He's not wedded to ideology. This is one reason he would turn to Romney, according to @SchottHappens
.@SchottHappens there's really no one else out there besides Romney who fits the bill for Sec of State. "Mitt Romney" is a steady hand.
.@SchottHappens thinks Mitt Romney would accept because it would send a good message to the country. #HinckleyReport
Based on Trump's previous comments about Romney, how will this meeting go? Why would @MittRomney want to take this position anyway?
On Romney's meeting w/ Trump this weekend, @BoydMatheson says it's a smart move. @WhittneyE thinks Trump wants to win Romney's favor
.@SchottHappens: there is some discord during this Trump transition because Trump didn't think he would win. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
Today's panelists will discuss the turmoil within the Trump transition team, electoral college, &amp; more. #HinckleyReport #utpol @KUED https://t.co/W4AWS5SAIB

If Evan McMullin didn't run, would those Republicans have gravitated back to Trump? #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
The democrats in Utah were hoping there would be a negative "Trump" effect in Utah. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol

.@maxroth says that when it comes to infrastructure, Donald Trump actually could end up working with Dems. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
What role do the democrats have right now? @renaibodley says they need to heal as a party and recruit new leadership. #HinckleyReport @KUED
There has been an onset of bullying within elementary schools around the country. Many children fear deportation. #HinckleyReport @KUED
Immigration and infrastructure spending are two issues that Utah Republicans will disagree with Trump on. #HinckleyReport says @mattcanham
@renaibodley: Trump could disappoint his voters who think he will bring outsiders into his cabinet, but he may actually bring his insiders
Trump has run as an outsider. He is the first President ever who has not served in the military or government. He wants to make change fast.
Trump is a roll model whether he wants to be or not. People want unity from their president according to @mattcanham #HinckleyReport @KUED
Panel now discussing how someone like Trump can unify the country? .@mattcanham says Trump was gracious when he met w/ Obama yesterday.
.@maxroth says the bias that reporters need to have is for facts. Trump has inclinations that are anti-"anyone who disagrees with him"
.@mattcanham says other people just couldn't justify voting for Trump due to his racist, sexist comments and policies. #HinckleyReport @KUED
.@mattcanham says many people didn't like Donald Trump, but they wanted a conversative Supreme Court. This was enough. #HinckleyReport
.@renaibodley on how people can vote for Obama, but also Trump: Because they didn't identify with Romney. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
Donald Trump won with 58% of the white vote. @maxroth finds this disturbing. There were many people who voted for Obama, and then for Trump.
.@mattcanham: people were not excited about this election, they were disillusioned. #HinckleyReport @KUED #utpol
There are many middle-class citizens who have not seen their wages increase. Trump had a clearer message for this population than Hillary.
@maxroth: Hillary didn't receive as many black votes as we expected. #HinckleyReport
On polling: .@renaibodley says that many hispanic voters weren't polled correctly. @maxroth Hillary didn't excite her electorate like Obama
.@mattcanham assumed that everyone who predicted Hillary would win, had to be right. All thought the polls would be right. #HinckleyReport
