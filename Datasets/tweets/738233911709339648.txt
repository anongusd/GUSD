@girllyfan @krassenstein And it is maddening. We're entering the 3rd year of this fucking debacle. Lines were drawn by hyperpartisanship from the right. Imo, that gives us leave to refuse to let lies stand. I want to see the press fact-check these liars in real time, until we've taken our country back.
@RStrilka @krassenstein From the moment it became clear that WH staff were willing to lie to the press &amp; the public, I've wanted to see our journalists stand as one at the 1st lie, turn their backs on the podium &amp; stay silent until Sanders walks back to her lair of lies.
@krassenstein Brian, if only they would. Truth decay is cutting the legs from under America's values &amp; ideals.  They're on the front lines of a war against journalism; who better to stand against lies than our free press?

@FockerRN529 I stand corrected on the current status of the lawsuit, reinstated Jan'18. Lawsuit refers 2 "rigging" as the result of bias. It does not accuse members of DNC physically rigging voter rolls/primary voting. If it does, quote it. But you won't. Bcos it doesn't. My 1st pt stands.
@FockerRN529 Exactly as I expected. You've nothing to refute a thing I've said or linked. What a joke.
@FockerRN529 You're referring 2 EO 12958, the EO that was rescinded &amp; replaced by EO13526? EO 12958 resulted in declassification of millions of docs. Neither have anything to do with individual security clearances or the revocation thereof. If u have facts 2 refute, pls post. No? Then stfu.
@FockerRN529 U obviously didn't read what I posted, since that info explained *why* ppl retain security clearances, which is what ur initial tweet referred 2. Read the links &amp; get back 2 me or go away.
@FockerRN529 The lawsuit didn't deal with rigging, it dealt with BIAS. There's a BIG difference. Bias w/in the party existed, no doubt. "Rigging" requires action, like hacking state voting machines to purge voter rolls. Now, those facts I got wrong are...?
@FockerRN529 What exactly is your point? Instead of passive-aggressive claptrap, point to something specific you think I got wrong, if you can. If I'm wrong, I say so. If you *can't* point to something you think I got wrong, shut the fuck up.

RT @ivanxgarcia: Speak those facts https://t.co/yBkhLFxZqB
@holden2018 as a Floridian I hv 2 tell u using 45's presidency as campaign fodder is a huge gamble here. Dem candidates will hv 2 focus on facts @ economy &amp; the issues his voters care @. That's how he &amp; Repubs won. His 2016 voters will b turned off if he's attacked.
@Sir_RazzyRay @krassenstein Not so sure. Ever tried to stop urself fm breathing? Our bodies hv a biological imperative 2 live. U cd mayb do it if you wrapped ur head in plastic &amp; figured out a way 2 force ur hands fm moving. Breathing a choice? Idts. Interesting ?.

@FoxNews Yes. Because we ARE NOT ONE NATION UNDER CHRISTIAN GOD. The founders deliberately didn't incl ANY religion. That motto wasn't there on $$ or anything else. We were formed so that ALL or NO religions cd b safely worshipped here. Ur god is not THE god.
@krassenstein I don't think impeachment likelihood even xes his mind. @krassenstein do u thk he found dirt on leading Repubs in Congress &amp; that's y they r allowing the destruction of US, or am I being paranoid?
@GaryHarder8 @FSPat80 You are malignantly uninformed and woefully ignorant. Glad ur Republican. We're accepting only rational, knowledgeable, intelligent ppl. Enjoy while u can. Changes begin 11/3/18 &amp; finish 11/3/20. Keep my twitter handle so u can tell me how right I am in Nov.
@StumpJumper6868 @GaryHarder8 U really hv no idea how wrong u r, do u. It's damned sad. Voter fraud has bn studied 4 DECADES w/ZERO widespread fraud found. Less than 25 cases &amp; every1 caught BE4 vote was cast. If u hv a brain use it &amp; add common sense. What ur saying is impossible.
@FSPat80 @GaryHarder8 But the Repubs who insulted and obstructed Obamaz for 8 solid years, shd they hv been arrested &amp; jailed?
@GaryHarder8 nearly every post here refers 2 Democrats who r neither in office nor even relevant. What's up w/that? Clinton was inv 4 4 full yrs, no indictments. Trump admin for less than 2 w/23 indictments &amp; guilty pleas. If u really belv it's a conspiracy, ur blind &amp; ignorant.

@RonaldKlain @joncoopertweets After the way he fed anger 2 his fans @ Christopher Steele, this infuriates me. At this point, I think we are safe to assume that every underhanded thing he accuses us of doing, he's already done or is doing.  Think about *that* 4 a moment.
