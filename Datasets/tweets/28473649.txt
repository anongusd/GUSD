About a year ago we had our best traffic month ever and people were paying us surprising amounts to advertise. It can happen again!
I get paid to write on the Internet now so the free blogging has fallen off. Anybody wanna blog for KP? Maybe you too can get paid one day.

.@heavyhokie @PEGPAC @WolfForPA if there's a lesson there, it's "don't elect Republican Presidents or Senators"

.@BobbyJay1111 @WolfForPA lol #CorbettCare requires state to hire 723 extra new state employees to untangle all the new red tape it creates
.@heavyhokie @PEGPAC @WolfForPA why can't it go on forever? Federal gov't has no balanced budget requirement. Can fund this forever.
.@PEGPAC @WolfForPA supposed to go down to 90% by 2020 and stay there. No precedent for feds cutting Medicaid share http://t.co/Ocwwv9qjIj
.@PEGPAC @WolfForPA lol sorry no, the feds have not said it will "taper off." Goes down to 90% fed money after 10 years. Very affordable.

@DylanMorpurgo you're free to contribute a guest post on Burn's tenure if you like
@DylanMorpurgo nobody has to read our blog. But about 30-40K a month find it useful/enjoyable. I probably would read Morpurgo Politics.
@DylanMorpurgo @DWStweets that's nice anecdata, but I'm looking for some measurable changes here. Unusually high voter reg? Turnout? What?
@stcif01 that's just my hobbyhorse. Want to get people thinking about what'll make the party better at being a party.
@DylanMorpurgo evidence? I know he went on MSNBC that time
@DylanMorpurgo what's the case for Burn?
@DylanMorpurgo yeah well, you know that's just like your opinion man :)
@DylanMorpurgo so let's ask them to do it in the course of the leadership change
.@DylanMorpurgo platform is where we have values fights. The party needs to be a force for protecting the platform's message in primaries
@DylanMorpurgo of course not. All I said was that it's an opportunity to take inventory and have that debate.

@ckennedy124 the studies are about Presidents. Governor is close analog.
@ckennedy124 read the Bernstein article tho, it's good. Is why I put a premium on getting Gov candos on record with positions early
@ckennedy124 think the higher the profile of the office, the more true it is
@ckennedy124 bc it's easy to tell if they keep them or not. Yr getting so much traction with Margo bc she ran on one thing, did another

@ckennedy124 @AriMelber @allysonschwartz no disagreement there, he's just better than the available alternatives

@ckennedy124 @AriMelber @allysonschwartz Wolf is the best available on HCR. Nobody supports single payer but he's open to all-payer
@ckennedy124 @AriMelber @allysonschwartz but it's unproven and I personally think it won't work. Gotta control the prices. That's the issue
