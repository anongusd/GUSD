@jeffunderwood71 @Gabesmom It's not good Jeff.
@jeffunderwood71 @Gabesmom Hope you pull it off Jeff. The #big12 needs it.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 No you don't. I don't even root for them until postseason. Doesn't matter now.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 He is a very dear friend but I know how you feel about them.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 That would be the one.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 Friends with their coach so I pull for the beakers.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 Try again but that was good.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 Only one school I can't stand and they play tonight. Take your guess on who it is? 3 play
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 You know Karen!
@jeffunderwood71 @Gabesmom Need you guys to win. The conference is not looking good thus far. Can't root for the other one tonight as u know
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 Kstate finally got it in gear. Hope they finish them off.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 Kstate is looking like crap as well.
@Gabesmom @jeffunderwood71 I don't doubt it Karen. That one was a shocker.

@Gabesmom Wasn't surprised we lost but was at how we lost. It was never a game.
@Gabesmom I don't think so. Both were awful.

Technically I guess that was a penalty against the #falcons but good grief and I don't care who wins.

@Church_On_F1 Nonetheless, the focus groups of undecideds after it even on MSNBC were a strong lean towards Romney.
@Church_On_F1 He was getting ready to hammer him Tues night until Candy protected Barry with a lie which she later had to say sorry for.
@Church_On_F1 And you are correct that you don't negotiate with terrorists. Tomm nights foreign policy debate should be the end of Barry.
@Church_On_F1 Won't happen as he is getting ready to be shown the door anyway. Romney and Bibi will have a much different approach.

@MCBolt04 @davidubben David does a good job and I normally don't have a problem with him but did in this case and the #big12 agrees.
@MCBolt04 @davidubben With all that we should have gotten a damn stop IMO. The 3rd and 4th down defense is a joke.
It's funny that some come after you on twitter only to know they are going to get slammed and quickly delete their post.

@N_Atwood Agreed and they blew it. It is all about nothing unfortunately.
@MCBolt04 @davidubben I thought he said he thought it was a fumble but it didn't matter &amp; came up with a stupid name for it. We got screwed.
