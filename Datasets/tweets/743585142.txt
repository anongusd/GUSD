Today is #EqualPayDay in the United States—the day that marks how far women had to work into 2018 to catch up with what men earned in 2017 alone.
Women on average are paid 20% less than men. On #EqualPayDay, show your support for equal pay—because #20PercentCounts. https://t.co/V6HNCT773X

We need to get more women into positions of power, which leads to stronger companies, economies, and families—and less harassment. This is the time for more mentorship—and more men stepping up and working toward equality.
Right now, there's evidence of a backlash that could be harmful to women: twice as many male managers now feel uncomfortable working alone with a woman. This is a huge step in the wrong direction.
We're at a pivotal moment. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, it’s clearer than ever we need to put an end to sexual harassment and hold perpetrators and enablers accountable. But that's not enough.

Watch this video to get skills to identify the tightrope bias and real-life strategies to navigate it successfully. https://t.co/pwpPxboUAy
Yet women are still expected to act with stereotypical “feminine” characteristics – like being nice and modest.
In many jobs, a person has to take on stereotypically “masculine” qualities – like being assertive – to be successful.
In the workplace, women often walk a tightrope between being seen as competent and liked. This phenomenon is known as the tightrope bias.

"The more we help one another, the more the notion of that “queen bee” will go out of style." -Sheryl Sandberg #LeanIn
When women celebrate one another’s accomplishments, we’re all lifted up. Together, women can level the playing field to go farther faster.
It’s time to stop viewing every disagreement between women as a catfight and to recognize that women are powerful allies at work and beyond.
We’ve all heard the myth that women don’t help one another. They're “mean girls” or "queen bees." And the male equivalent? It doesn't exist.
For women, this kind of support can be especially important — because, too often, the world tells women what we can’t do.

By reinforcing the idea that people want to overcome bias, we say that most people don’t want to discriminate &amp;you shouldn’t either. #LeanIn
The solution isn’t to stop pointing out stereotypes. Instead, we need to talk about biases and encourage people to correct for them.
Another study found that when managers read that many people held stereotypes, they were 28% less interested in hiring a female candidate.
One study found that people who read that stereotypes were common rated women as significantly less career-oriented &amp; more family-oriented.
Research suggests that simply talking about gender bias can backfire, leading people to discriminate more rather than less.
To break down the barriers that hold women back, it’s not enough to spread awareness.

A more diverse workforce will lead to stronger organizations. And that’s good for employees, good for companies, and good for all of us.
Companies have an important role to play in reaching gender equality, and we will all benefit when they succeed.
Targets—in addition to metrics—matter. It is easier to track and make progress when a company has clear goals in place. #LeanIn
Although most companies track metrics on women’s representation, only 44% set pipeline targets. #LeanIn
Bias training is important. When employees don’t understand how bias	works, they are less likely to make fair and accurate decisions.
Corporate policies are only part of the solution – employees also need to understand what steps they can take to get to equality. #LeanIn
Blind résumé reviews are a simple way to minimize bias in the hiring process, yet only 4 percent of companies say they do this. #LeanIn
Organizations need to ensure that hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair –– and look for opportunities to further reduce bias. #LeanIn
Only 22% of employees say that progress on gender diversity is regularly measured and shared across the company. #LeanIn
Senior leaders have an important role to play, from talking openly about gender diversity to modeling this commitment in everyday actions.
Companies need to more fully communicate why gender diversity matters and how it benefits everyone. #LeanIn
Although there’s no “one size fits all” solution, there are steps	companies can take to create a more inclusive work environment.

Women are now negotiating for raises and promotions as often as their male peers—defying the conventional wisdom that women don’t ask.

The long-term solution to the double bind of speaking while female is to increase the number of women in leadership roles.
One study found that when female executives spoke more than their peers, both men and women punished them with 14% lower ratings.
Women who worry that talking “too much” will cause them to be disliked are not paranoid –– research shows they're often right.
When a woman speaks in a professional setting, she walks a tightrope. Either she’s barely heard or she’s judged as too aggressive.

One study found men who stayed late to help prep for a meeting were rated 14% more favorably than women who did the exact same thing.
Since we don't expect men to be communal, they gain points for saying yes to favors at work and face minimal consequences for saying no.
Because we expect help from women but not men, women earn no extra points for doing office housework and are penalized when they say no.
Women take on more “office housework” – service and support work such as taking notes, organizing events, and training new hires – than men.
