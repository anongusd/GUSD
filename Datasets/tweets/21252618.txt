Fair point. Meadows — one of the first speakers — did say the president is not a racist. https://t.co/OUQv5spTrA

@rickcoombe @guypbenson just seeing this. what was that that you said? “its means nothing?” in this instance, it meant exactly what i said.
now that the shutdown is over, can someone tell us where Bryce Harper is going?
The rhythms of American governance are so strange — especially with Trump in W.H. 		For 35 days, WH resisted this exact plan: open govt to negotiate. 		Then Trump agreed to it. And now Congress is moving rapidly to approve it with no opposition and hardly anyone in the Capitol
@sahilkapur @Alyssafarah there’s no doubt that a border security package can be seen broadly in the interest of some Ds who are in trump seats. 		much of it depends on a) whether the White House can lock into a singular position over the next few weeks. B) whether Trump keeps the flexibility he did today
Swan is right		The White House is saying Democrats have agreed to give him his wall money if he reopened the government.		But there are two Democrats that matter: their names are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. https://t.co/9NOXwsPaTI
On Dec. 20, the Senate OK’ed a stopgap funding bill until Feb. 8		Today, Congress will OK a stopgap bill until Feb. 15.		America has gotten seven more days of funding out of this monthlong shutdown!
Pelosi and Schumer. https://t.co/HFNox8ev83
Few things to watch in the next few days		- who does Schumer, McConnell, Pelosi, McCarthy put on this conference committee 		- will they try to limit scope of talks. I.e. just appropriations not immigration policy.

What you’ll hear from republicans: the stopgap includes money to repair existing wall. Yes. That’s true. that’s never been a disagreement.
&gt;@KellyO just made this point on @MSNBC , and she’s dead on: Pelosi has now gotten trump to cave on SOTU, and now, he’s gonna reopen government without the wall.
This is not a “deal” between the Hill and the White House. The Hill was waiting for the White House to decide what it wanted to end the shutdown. And it appears like it has.
Does this mean there will be a state of the union next week?
playbook pm: shutdowns are aimed at causing pain for the other party, hoping they’ll blink. 		Republicans blinked. Dems didn’t. https://t.co/iooMfuMpZL
Senate has a vehicle that funds dhs, starts a conference negotiation. They’d need to add 3-week language. 		This would start bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. I’m bearish on those.

Impossible to know how this will end. But here’s as good a guess as any 		— house adds 5b to funding bill. It passes. Senate rejects the bill. Trump, meadows and Jordan has a choice. Open govt or not. 		Then again, the house might not be able to clear it.

A lot of the leadership is saying this but what is the argument backing that up? How can they continue the fight in the minority? https://t.co/QJCywtrt5b
WARNING ... I’ve spoken to multiple senior White House aides this morning who have no idea what the plan is for the stopgap spending bill. Concerns he might veto are rampant.
House GOP is about to start its meeting in the Capitol basement. We’ll know more in an hour or so.
We don’t know. Because the president has not indicated what he wants. 		so we’re all here now, the day before the government shutdown, and we’re left to guess what the president will do five days before Christmas. Last gasp of the GOP majority almost eight years in.
Now, House is getting ready to figure out what it wants to do. I have very little doubt that this bill will have 218 votes. But it will be mostly Democrats.		What will the president do when he sees his allies — Jordan, Meadows, etc — vote no, and say Trump has abandoned his base?
Senate has unanimously passed govt funding. No roll call vote. The entire chamber has agreed that it wants to punt funding until 2/8		The funding is the same as it is now: $1.3b for border security. No new wall money. Certainly nothing approaching $5 billion, which POTUS wants
By midnight tomorrow, a portion of the govt shuts down 4 days before Christmas, and the WH is silent about how it wants this process completed. 		My sources there have told me everything. They both do and don’t want a short-term bill. Want big big, don’t. Want shutdown, don’t.
I have a few thoughts about the government funding situation, based on my reporting last night and this morning that I’m going to share here on this thread.
It’s a last gasp of power for the HFC, which is beginning to envision what it will mean to be in a deep minority. 		But, from their perspective, many of them ran alongside trump on the same promises of restrictive immigration policies. And they’re not delivering. https://t.co/4COvuCQRef

A question I ask myself all the time. https://t.co/dscg4ZDmcR
And a @harrispolitico sighting! https://t.co/AnLMrWw6TV
The Senate has cleared the government funding bill by voice vote, but McConnell ominously notes that they have to see what the House does with the bill.
Guest hosting hannity, @dbongino says this might be the first lame duck where the majority passes minority party priorities.		In fact, in 2010, Obama passed extension of Bush tax cuts with Democrats still in the majority
Matt Schlapp: Trump should veto the stopgap funding bill
Hannity — being guest hosted by Dan Bongino — is on an extended A block about the border wall, saying the base “wants the wall and wants it now"
I don’t know how much trump cares but the freedom caucus really, really wants him to veto this thing.
“The base will go crazy,” Mark Meadows said of passing a stopgap funding bill without border wall money. He says there will be “major” political damage to @realDonaldTrump.
UH OH... GOVT FUNDING UPDATE ... Well, I just spoke to a House R who said there’s some consternation on the floor about lack of disaster money in the short-term spending bill. 		Whip count will become clearer later, but some frustration.
362 people voted in this first of many House votes tonight. That’s 71 short of full attendance.  (2 vacancies).

Dershowitz update from @jonathanvswan https://t.co/29xNopgsCN
@bretthhorton @riccimike I don’t disagree w any of this. That wasn’t even the point.
There is huge incentive for Republicans on 12/21 because they will be just a few weeks away from losing power in D.C. If they dont get wall funding then, it’s all but over.
Why is 12/21 logical? Because it’s the Friday before Christmas. People will want to get out of town.
At the moment, funding expires on 12/7 — this Friday. But GOP leaders want to push the deadline due to the death of George H.W. Bush.
HOUSE and SENATE currently discussing a stopgap spending bill until either 12/18 or 12/21. 		As we laid out in Playbook this morning., 12/21 is the logical date. But some inside the GOP are pushing for 12/18		Very possible that they pass this by unanimous consent.

as @BresPolitico @rachaelmbade and @kyledcheney pointed out — @realDonaldTrump wants McCarthy to take care of Jordan &amp; the HFC guys. He sees them as protectors of the creed. McCarthy has a tough line to walk there since the freedom caucus is perhaps the most unpopular bunch of rs
Today also is a day @GOPLeader has been waiting for. He’ll face off — and is expected to summarily crush —@Jim_Jordan. Plainly, the two don’t care for each other. And the idea that somehow they are equals in power has chafed on McCarthy circles.

It’s been more than a decade since Mark Penn advised Hillary Clinton, right?
That’s always the weakness in the overthrowing the speaker argument. Ask mark meadows and Jim Jordan. Conservatives spent many long nights thinking of people to draft to run against Ryan. Many of the people they considered had no interest in going up against the party leader.
If you’re considering a challenge to Pelosi, there are lots of considerations. 		Not only do you need support of 15-20 rebels. You need to assume that pelosis healthy support — near 200 —will flip to you		I’m not passing judgement on whether it’ll work. But that’s a real factor.
Keep in mind: subpoenas are a last resort. No incoming investigative committee is readying subpoenas. There are lots of steps before subpoenas. Requests for information, meetings, interviews. Subpoenas are a last resort if the admin doesnt cooperate.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS WHO HAVE PUBLICLY MADE FUN OF @BresPolitico IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS … 		— @SpeakerRyan 	— @GOPLeader 	— @SenateMajLdr 		I am calling on all Democrats to do the same.
Ryan on Jon Kyl: “I love the man"
@BresPolitico nothing makes me happier than everyone catching onto my favorite pastime …. making fun of @BresPolitico!
Paul Ryan actually said this: “i dont know how many of you were around in the 1960s, maybe Bresnahan”		He actually said this, @BresPolitico
McCarthy — the NYT op-ed writer should be fired. 		Meadows — member of OGR — looking at legislative options		President Trump’s allies are  circling the wagons. https://t.co/y24fV4vc94
RT @mschwirtz: ‘No.’ @nikkihaley, walking into the Security Council chamber, says she did not write the op-ed
Pelosi on Trump saying “TREASON” — it’s a manifestation of his instability
“Theres a good chance we will have the gavel on the Democratic side,” Pelosi said, noting she takes nothing for granted.
The shock about the op-ed was that it was written and got published in the manner it did. Members say this stuff all the time. Even trumps closest allies and friends. https://t.co/OawPVO7Hax
Pelosi got the cover of time magazine for the first time. This is something she’s brought up before. Here’s one instance in 2014 https://t.co/XiVOwpo1kH https://t.co/k7bbneuejI

Troy Balderson — who republicans spent more than $4 million dragging across the finish line — is now a member of congress. 		Jim Jordan, who endorsed his primary opponent, gave him a hearty congrats on the floor. Steve Stivers — the NRCC chairman — is nearby.
“so if it's about border security I'm willing to do what has to be done."		This morning @SpeakerRyan said trump knew he couldn’t shut down.
Update. 9/5.	Trump at the top of a mtg w Hill R leaders. About a government shutdown 	“If it happens it happens. If it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything. We have to protect our borders. If we don't protect our borders our country isn't going to be a country...”

Chatting privately on the House floor: Mark Meadows and Kevin McCarthy.
it’s not really about whether he has the bug though. It’s about his apparent disregard for the rules and standards that govern college basketball. 		He’s made clear he wants to coach again … https://t.co/gR025fO5Nm
