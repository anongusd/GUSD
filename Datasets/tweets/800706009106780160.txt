@betsybblue @krassenstein I‚Äôm sorry but every supreme court decision to date disagrees with that assertion.  Lets not deal with hypotheticals.
@betsybblue @krassenstein 100% agree.  But again, scotus weighed the rights of the mother against the rights of the unborn child, and drew the line at viability.  This law further blurs that line, and opens the door for a newly conservative court to redraw the line.  Who would that help?
@betsybblue @krassenstein We all as a society are responsible for every wrong perpetrated by laws that fail to address reality.  Also, my daughter may one day be faced with the consequences of this battle.
@betsybblue @krassenstein Trump locking up children at the border also doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave anything to do with‚Äù me, but i feel morally obliged to speak out against his abuses.  Is that also a faulty argument?
@betsybblue @krassenstein If you can point to safeguards against abuse, my wife has been wrestling with this dilemma for awhile and would love to hear that it actually has been addressed
@betsybblue @krassenstein Health can be broadly defined as economic, or social health.   That‚Äôs a bit worrisome, as anyone can claim they‚Äôre broke, and thus should qualify for a third trimester abortion, despite fetal viability and no danger to mom‚Äôs life.  It‚Äôs a gray area that needs to be redefined imo
@betsybblue @krassenstein After all, with advances in medical capabilities,  scotus could argue that fetal viability is actually now as early as 18-20 weeks.  This would be a major setback.
@betsybblue @krassenstein The worry is that the definition of ‚Äúhealth‚Äù may be so broad that it effectively means any time under any circumstance, if an unscrupulous doctor so chooses.  This is where i worry scotus may step in and redefine the red line and set back the cause.
@betsybblue @krassenstein Yep, that‚Äôs what it says.  I agree that broadening the definitions of circumstances under which a women may choose is a positive step.  But roe v wade set forth viability of fetus as the red line (with the exception of life threatening circumstances for the mother)
@betsybblue @krassenstein My worry is that the broad definitions put forth open the door for a supreme court challenge that actually sets back the cause for choice (considering the current composition of the scotus).  My hope is that we can all, men and women alike,  keep cool heads and discuss as adults
@betsybblue @krassenstein I‚Äôve read the law and discussed it at length with my wife.  Funny thing is i was defending the law to her, while she thought it was a bit too loose in its definitions.  Also to be fair i was replying to a man, who was actually misrepresenting the scope of the law.
@betsybblue @krassenstein And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how demonizing is done.  So much for open discourse.

@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris Well... we may have to agree to disagree.  Based on that test case, and the legal reasoning, it seems justified to me.  If you can save lives and keep kids in school with what amounts to a slap on the wrist for neglectful parents, i say do it.  They gave parents tons of chances.
@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris I do recognize that on the face it seems very harsh.  I personally need more facts though before i condemn her offhand.
@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris I think prosecution would be absolutely last resort if they can show the parent really is being neglectful.  I‚Äôd be very curious to see statistics on how many cases actually went to trial and resulted in convictions, and what sorts of penalties are involved.
@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris And aren‚Äôt parents usually the arbiters of whether an absence is unexcused?  Sick note, death in the family etc.
@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris 5 unexcused absences though right?  We‚Äôre not talking sick das are we?
@CharlieMonk @btcBernie @EmmaVigeland Do tell.  I‚Äôm sure voters around the country who are just now getting to know her would benefit greatly from your knowledge.  But vague condemnation doesn‚Äôt educate us.
@Vj248J @road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris I think the counter point would be that depriving an elementary age student education could amount to neglect.  And the stated end goal is reduction in the school-&gt; prison pipeline.  A worthy cause i‚Äôd say, however i‚Äôll admit i‚Äôve still only begun educating myself on this issue.
@btcBernie @EmmaVigeland That clip is cherry picked.  I don‚Äôt know whether or not she actually prosecuted any parents, but later in the speech she related a story of helping an overwhelmed single mom of 3 who otherwise might have failed.  Context matters https://t.co/2DMhTExB7E 15 minute mark
@road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @Vj248J @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris https://t.co/2DMhTExB7E around 15 min in is the truancy policy.  No mention of actually sending parents of truant students to jail, but she did relate one story of rly  helping a single mom of 3 who otherwise would likely have failed.  Context matters.  Not a heartless policy.
@road25thdan @LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @Vj248J @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @KamalaHarris I definitely will if i can find it.  Thx for the tip
@LqLana @LeeBrown1273 @Vj248J @TalibKweli @NW_StayDet @Bryanjdyer @road25thdan @KamalaHarris I would think the devil is in the details.  From that clip it seems like she was referring to *elementary school* truancy.  That would fall more squarely on parents‚Äô shoulders than a rebelling hs student cutting class.  Still a troubling policy.   More info would be helpful.
