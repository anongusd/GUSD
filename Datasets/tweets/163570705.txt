This action sets a dangerous precedent and opens the door for future abuse of power. Building the wall is not a national emergency, and I strongly disagree with the President taking that action.
Make no mistake, the constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. The attempt by this President to circumvent Congress to pay for a campaign promise--that he said Mexico would pay for--is a gross overstep of the constitutional powers provided to the Executive Branch.
I'm pleased the President signed the bill, our federal government will remain open, and federal workers will continue to receive the pay they deserve. Unfortunately, the President cannot resist the urge to create chaos where none is needed.
The bipartisan funding bill that was passed by Congress last night was a good-faith effort by negotiators on both sides--precisely how our democracy is designed to function...

About to speak with @TeamCavuto about the government shutdown and the president’s address to the nation. Tune in to @foxbusiness now!
Pres. Trump is on the verge of owning the longest government shutdown in American history. I'll remind you it began when the GOP controlled all branches of government &amp; after the Senate overwhelmingly passed funding to avert a shutdown. Make no mistake, this is the #TrumpShutdown

On the air with @MSNBC with @AlexWitt discussing, shutdown, new Congress, and more.
In this new Congress we must do what is right and not what is easy. So I'll say what needs to be said:		My colleague was flat-out wrong.
For more than 2 years, I hoped that a member of the president's party would rebuke his use of smutty language to launch unpresidential attacks.		It rarely happened.
Yesterday, one of my Democratic colleagues used some less-than-sanitary language when describing the president. As uncomfortable as it is, I must declare that wrong is wrong no matter the political label of the wrong-sayer.
Republicans have spent years rewarding wealthy donors &amp; special interests while leaving working families behind. It's time our democracy started working for ALL Americans, and it starts with the #ForThePeople Act. https://t.co/CM86jzCDxG

Because some people called the President bad names, hundreds of thousands of Americans will get hurt. My mother used to tell me: The less a weak person's command of the facts, the stronger their opinion.
The stock market is dropping like a lead balloon, 800,000 Americans are going to be without pay over Christmas, and the economy, which is already slowing, is going to be significantly hurt.		And the President is "Proud"
This political stunt put on by the President and House leadership over an ineffective, immoral border wall that a clear majority of America rejects is some of the most irresponsible governing I've seen in my time in Congress.
Both chambers of Congress overwhelmingly support the CR passed by the Senate. Trump has decided he would rather shut down the government and cause 800K federal employees to go without pay during the holiday season. This is 100% on the President and GOP House leadership.

The relationship between America's urban &amp; rural regions is a symbiotic one; we thrive when we work together. While negotiations were tough, it's refreshing to see Congress work together in a bipartisan fashion to get something done for the American people. Let's keep it going.
Some other highlights of the bill include:	- Expands rural broadband infrastructure	- Helps producers weather the current trade war	- Provides more certainty to farmers during a volatile farm economy
I'm proud to say that there were absolutely no cuts to #SNAP benefits, meaning no one will be kicked off the program. Also, through administrative modifications, we were actually able to save $1 billion that will be reinvested into nutrition assistance programs.

American workers and companies are already struggling to deal with the effects of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and goods from China, so the NAFTA 2.0 deal must not be an additional burden.
If we are attempting to strengthen the current NAFTA, then we need to make sure there is proper enforcement and remove all loopholes that could undercut the deal's effectiveness.
USMCA, also known as NAFTA 2.0, takes some steps in the right direction, however, I cannot vote for the deal unless it contains greater protections for American workers and ensures Mexico follows through on worker protections and wage improvements.	https://t.co/dC5mUwOCTk

As Democrats take control of the House, it is imperative that we work to address the systemic racial biases within American housing markets. I look forward to working with members from both sides of the aisle to confront this issue.
It cannot be understated how detrimental the devaluation of homeownership in black neighborhoods has been to these communities as a whole. That's less money for businesses, for schools, for infrastructure, for so many things that are critical to a thriving community.
In Kansas City, we are doing better than the national average, however, the average devaluation of homes in majority black neighborhoods is still 20.3%. Here are some further statistics showing the issues that arise with the devaluation of homes among the KC neighborhoods: https://t.co/7PC9MLZKcx
Analysis found that metro areas with greater devaluation of black neighborhoods are more segregated &amp; less likely to provide upward mobility for black children who grow up in them. African Americans aren't just losing $, we're missing out on same opportunities provided to others.
"Homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities are worth 23% less in majority black neighborhoods, compared to those with very few or no black residents."		Meaning the differences in home &amp; neighborhood quality cannot explain the differences in home value.
Researchers found that "owner-occupied homes in black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 per home on average, amounting to $156 billion in cumulative losses."		That is $156 BILLION that Black Americans are being shorted strictly due to racial biases.
Yesterday, @BrookingsInst released a report on the devaluation of homeownership in black neighborhoods across the United States. It reveals the persistent institutional racism that continues to prevail in American housing markets.	https://t.co/9j2thC5NGQ

Republicans across the country continue to claim they would defend protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions (more than 130 million Americans). If this is true, they can prove it today by dropping a lawsuit that would nullify these same protections. #ProtectOurCare
If the Trump administration is successful in nullifying protections for those with pre-existing conditions, 467,500 MOians could lose their health care or face higher premiums.  That’s why Rep Clay &amp; I sent a letter to @AGJoshHawley requesting he remove Missouri from the lawsuit. https://t.co/rgoLbiuVZ7

Instead of talking about a clearly unconstitutional executive order or a non-existent invasion of less than 1,000 mostly women and children, there are serious issues affecting Americans every day that deserve the attention. Let's talk about them.
And how are they going to pay for the tax cuts that don't pay for themselves? They're going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other services that benefit working class Americans. https://t.co/xFBKnX1LCK
What it has also done is increase the national deficit by more than $100 billion. I guess tax cuts do not, in fact, pay for themselves. #GOPTaxScam	https://t.co/KS0czD8NZz
So, where did all of that money go? Stock buybacks (which, again, disproportionately benefit the wealthy) #GOPTaxScam	https://t.co/lsjBpbUwMh
Americans were promised these tax cuts--disproportionately benefiting the wealthy--would be "jet fuel" for the economy. Instead, we've seen the tax cut have little, if any, impact on business investment.	https://t.co/aBewm2edK5
Lastly, but most importantly, let's talk about the one major legislative accomplishment of a Republican-controlled government: the #GOPTaxScam		I'll let this chart do most of the talking. https://t.co/wsbaSNLaY5
Oh, and the president's administration has stated that--following the mid-terms--there are no plans to give aid to our farmers in 2019.	https://t.co/lZhgkZl3Od
I've heard from farmers across Missouri. They all say the same thing: "we want trade, not aid."		Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans don't seem to get the message, because the president is planning billions more in tariffs.	https://t.co/lgI8iIKeGH
The Stock Market is essentially where it was before the $2 trillion handout to the wealthy and giant corporations. And, despite what the president claims, economists say the trade tariffs are only going to make matters worse.	https://t.co/gikGcHYuu6
Have you been paying into Social Security &amp; Medicare your entire life?		Well, to pay for a $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy, Republican leadership has stated they are coming for Social Security and Medicare funding if they retain control of Congress.	https://t.co/yjSMg9Gids
Despite claims on the campaign trail, @realDonaldTrump's administration and Republican AGs across the country are working hard to strike down protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, making health care much more expensive. #ProtectOurCare	https://t.co/Z8pGa1ZEZM
Instead of talking about non-existent invasions of immigrants or unconstitutional executive orders, how about we discuss some real issues that affect every day Americans...

That's why I attended the Postal Union's rally against privatizing the @USPS yesterday. Privatization of the USPS would be a disaster for postal workers and the Americans who utilize it every day. I'm proud to stand with them to say U.S. mail is not for sale! https://t.co/RV4C7nX6A3
What would privatization look like?	-Severe job losses	-Wage cuts for postal workers	-Increased prices in mail delivery	-Decimation of rural services
.@USPS is the most popular agency in the U.S. government with an 88% approval rating. It employs 500,000 Americans (30% of which are vets) &amp; links 157 million American households and businesses together. In my district, USPS employs over 3,300 people.
The @USPS has been utilized in America since it was written into our constitution in 1787. Throughout my time in Congress, I've been an ardent supporter of the agency. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has made it a priority to privatize this historic institution.
A poll of 1,500 companies showed just 4% are redirecting tax savings to budgets for bigger paychecks in the coming year.		In another survey of more than 1,000 companies, 99% said the tax cuts weren't prompting them to increase minimum wages.	https://t.co/l4vXrS2v2L

Rural communities struggle to access capital for infrastructure and economic development. Yet, the #GOPFarmBill still increases costs to financing by adding fees to Rural Development loans.
The hyper partisan #GOPFarmBill would cut $14 billion in #SNAP, take school meals from 265,000 kids, and cause 400,000 households to lose SNAP benefits. As a nation, we shouldn't be taking food from Americans who need it the most. #ProtectSNAP

According to the Institute on Taxation &amp; Economic Policy, the top 1% of Americans will get $84 billion in 2019 thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. To put that in perspective, #SNAP, which helps feed 39 million Americans and 1 in 4 children, only costs $58 billion.	https://t.co/phFSSEAzKR

Other countries are already working to implement these protections. South Korea, for example, has already issued rules on cryptocurrency. If we are not smart, we are going to end up seeing other countries pass us in this arena #fintech #cryptocurreny

Every American should have the opportunity to improve their circumstances through education without fear of being indebted to student loan servicers for the rest of their lives.
It is my sincere hope that Congress and President Trump will work together to implement some common sense protections for our students.
.@realDonaldTrump seems to be doing his best to HELP these servicers ensnare students by attempting to gut the @CFPB, an agency solely dedicated to protecting American consumers, and rolling back rules intended to protect students.	https://t.co/O69K1JxrtM
If we are not quick to confront these problems and make the necessary adjustments, millions more Americans will find themselves being taken advantage of.  There is only one problem with that…
From 2016-2017 the @CFPB saw student loan complaints skyrocket 325%, meaning problems with these student loan servicers seem to be getting significantly worse. 	https://t.co/rGAzWTUdnE
https://t.co/vqBSS6SVmN
In many states, gov agencies can seize state-issued professional licenses from residents who default on their educational debts, making it nearly impossible for people to get work and pay back their student debt. In one state, they can even suspend a person’s driver’s license!
This leaves students trapped under a mountain of piling debt with little they can do to ever escape. But it gets even worse!
One of the biggest problems with student loan debt is that far too often servicers place these financially vulnerable Americans into costlier than necessary plans that are not sustainable over the life of the loan.
Student lending is the second-largest consumer finance market, right behind mortgages, and roughly $620 billion more than the total U.S. credit card debt. It’s hard to overstate just how enormous this issue really is.	https://t.co/QsNTT5XMBI
Currently, student loan debt has grown to over $1.3 TRILLION in the United States, weighing down 44 million Americans, with more than 8.5 million people presently in default.  This is a significant and growing problem a vast array of Americans are facing.
Today, @RepJayapal and I sent a letter to the CEOs of the four largest student loan servicers in the country, urging them to focus efforts on addressing consumer complaints regarding predatory loan practices. You can find the official press release here: https://t.co/GCNmTEcPoe

Today, the Senate Majority is going to vote on a bill they haven't read, which is supported by only 25% of the country, in order to pass a tax plan in which the majority of the benefits go to the wealthiest 1% in America and raise the debt by at least $1 trillion.

The @CFPB is essential in overseeing student loan lending &amp; protecting students from predatory loans, why would we gut the ppl's watchdog?
Sec. DeVos' rollback of student loan protections will fail to hold companies accountable, leading to riskier and more expensive loans.
Student loan borrowers need protection from predatory lending--instead @realDonaldTrump &amp; Sec. DeVos continue to roll back those protections
Over 40 million Americans owe more than $1.3 trillion in student loans. It's time we start taking the issue seriously and bring to forefront
4)Taking pic w/HBCU presidents while putting their funding in jeopardy is wrong. Flattery may work w/you but HBCUs need funding not flattery
3)HBCUs have always allowed admission to students of all races, so no constitutional issue providing Howard w/ same federal funds as Harvard
2) If you prefer not to read about point 1, watch the movie Hidden Figures. The main character could not have worked at NASA without HBCUs.
1)Most HBCUs were established after the Civil War in the South bc segregation prevented blacks from studying in schools with white students.

If #TrumpCare is so great, why is the majority already exempting themselves from losing health services?
The last thing America needs is a law that would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  That's what #TrumpCare will do.

As we come to the end of #Trump100Days, the only possible "high point" is the failure of #TrumpCare.

This is not a game, it is the law. #CBCTech2020
It's alarming how many companies secure gov't contracts w/o any checks/balances on diversity efforts, plans, &amp; supporting data. #CBCTech2020
We urge @USDOL to require gov't contracted tech companies to abide by fed regulations: develop written affirmative action plans #CBCTech2020
As of 2014, the % of African-Americans who work for tech companies whom hold sizable government contracts, was only 4.3%. #CBCTech2020
However, minorities hired by some of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley are virtually non-existent. #CBCTech2020
According to @EdNCES, in 2012-2013 about 6,000 US African- American students earned computer &amp; information science degrees. #CBCTech2020
African-Americans are majoring and graduating in computer science, they just aren’t being hired in reasonable numbers. #CBCTech2020
We’ve heard the excuse from some tech companies that there aren’t many African-American applicants, but that's not the case. #CBCTech2020
There's been growth in other industries in African American employment, but strong underrepresentation in the tech industry #CBCTech2020
Specifically, we're asking tech companies that hold sizable government contracts to develop written affirmative-action programs #CBCTech2020

This is earned money &amp; it's about doing what is right! This is about getting back to the good old-fashioned notion that hard work pays off!
Added to the rising housing and prescription drug costs – pension cuts will put retirees out of their homes or into bankruptcy.
Almost 400,000 retirees will be affected by pension cuts – over 185,000 will receive a cut of 30% or more.
Over 3500 will be affected in the 5th District, over 32,000 in Missouri.  That’s $3 billion worth of pensions.
Over the last 6 months over 700 workers or retirees have contacted my office about cuts to their pensions.

To read my entire Op-Ed on this important issue, please visit: https://t.co/hJwRpQgbSi #Tech2020 @thehill
In 2016, we don’t need @PresHarryTruman style presidential courage to promote diversity and inclusion - just common sense. #Tech2020
Promoting diversity in the tech industry is both beneficial and fair to individuals, and strengthens organizations as well. #Tech2020
I believe the relationship between the tech industry &amp; diverse populations, such as the African-American community, are symbiotic. #Tech2020
As a public servant it is my job to aid business &amp; our diverse communities. I proudly serve as  @OfficialCBC task force member for #TECH2020
Recent @McKinsey research finds that racially diverse companies outperform industry norms by 35 percent. #Tech2020
Diversity is not just a valuable means of labor supply–it is critical to innovation, creativity, &amp; the overall health of a company #Tech2020
In Aug @twitter’s VP of Diversity/Inclusion said they plan to increase underrepresented minorities by refining recruiting &amp; hiring #Tech2020
Less diverse co's are most committed to progress: @google working w/HBCUs &amp; Apple pledging $100m to @POTUS’s ConnectED initiative. #Tech2020
Even though African-Americans account for more than 25% of @twitter’s user base, they represent a mere 2% of its US workforce. #Tech2020
There is a disturbing lack of diversity @twitter at all levels; especially considering that 27% of African-Americans use Twitter. #Tech2020
Data from Silicon Valley reveals that African-Americans represent 2% or less of the workforce of most of the technology companies. #Tech2020
Tech organizations need bodies that underrepresented populations are keen to provide. #Tech2020
#TECH2020 is a @OfficialCBC initiative assembling the best minds to increase African-American inclusion at all levels of tech by the yr 2020
Organizations benefit from full participation &amp; diversity; whether in ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, etc. #Tech2020
Truman's actions exemplify an esteemed organizational model: evenhandedness for the individual and soundness of the organization. #Tech2020
Truman understood that w/o healthy minority participation he couldn't guarantee the complete strength of the US armed forces. #Tech2020
Truman issued an executive order because he knew that a civil rights bill could not muster the hostilities of Congress. #Tech2020
On July 26 1948, @PresHarryTruman issued Executive Order 9981, requiring the integration of the armed forces. #Tech2020
