Interesting nuance: @HillaryClinton says Assad, ISIS should be handled at same time; at CFR, suggested Assad was on back burner. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton says Abbas is "the lesser of two evils," given possibility of ISIS inroads in Palestinian Territories. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton says Abbas may not be great partner for peace, but what's the alternative? #Saban15
@HillaryClinton corrects herself: military option on table with Iran, not "nuclear option" #Saban15
@HillaryClinton refrains from criticizing Bibi or Abbas on lack of progress in peace process #Saban15
@HillaryClinton clear: no daylight in relationship with Israel. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton sees jihadi threat as giving Israel and Arab neighbors common ground they could build on in peace process. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton reaffirms support for 2-state solution, even if it seems unattainable. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton slams BDS movement as latest front in demonization of Israel. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton very tough on Iran, repeating support for nuke deal, but only with harsh enforcement. #Saban15
@HillaryClinton says removing Assad and fighting ISIS must be done simultaneously #Saban15
@HillaryClinton says 3 trends: rising extremism, Iranian malfeasance, efforts to delegitimIze Israel #Saban15
@HillaryClinton says ISIS threatens Israel through radical franchise in Sinai #Saban15

As ISIS is politicized in 2016, @fisheri's lucid history is a reminder: this is a bipartisan foreign-policy failure https://t.co/dKdyiqfAtt
Contrast between Obama on ISIS and Obama on Iran nuke deal is striking. Both are politically difficult but Obama so much firmer on diplomacy
A French president issues a call to arms in the Middle East while an American president counsels restraint. #newworld
A frustrated Obama gets to the crux of his foreign policy dilemma: restraint may be wise course, but selling it is politically impossible
Obama's characterization of ISIS threat, refusal to play into their narrative as a state, runs counter to France calling it an "act of war"

Clinton: Obama's failure to enforce red line on Syria had high costs. But deal on CW still a "net positive"
Clinton's message in a nutshell: "We've got to be a lot more globally present."
Clinton calling for a fairly radical rethink of US policy toward Russia
Clinton NOT optimistic about diplomatic outreach to Iran on regional security issues. There's no outstretched hand here.
Clinton: A full-throated endorsement of no-public daylight between US and Israel
Clinton singles out Russian role in destabilizing Syria. Interesting, given Obama admin has begun talking with Russia about a settlement
Clinton's Iran speech would have gotten a rousing standing ovation at AIPAC meeting
Clinton's pledge to get off on right foot with Israel is a clear contrast to Obama, who didn't go to Israel in his first term
Hillary repeats regrets at weak U.S. response to the Green Revolution. Obama aides say dissidents told U.S. not to interfere
Clinton's Iran enforcement strategy implies aggressive US engagement (military + diplomatic) in the Middle East for years to come
Clinton's emphasis is less on details of Iran deal -- imperfect -- than her role in putting together sanctions regime and enforcing it
