@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Im not going to refute this, instead ill refer you to the panel of trump appointed intelligence officers who basically said on live television trump's full of shit. He doesn't even get intellegence briefings. How the hell would he know. He just says things. Most of them are crap.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump So this is incorrect. We released billions of confiscated funds to iran (their confiscated funds) in order for them to give up their nuclear ambitions. They did. Trump decided it was a bad deal and canceled it. They are no longer subject to that compliance. Stupid.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Name one
@mketchum2006 @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Is ignorance now a syndrome as well? You know thinking critically is not a mental health issue. Wish more of you would take it up.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That leaves our enemies fearing us. Well, that i will grant you. But now so do our allies. You know, the conglomerate of countries that have crowned us as the undisputed head of the world. This is a terrible mistake. No empire since the dawn of man has lasted forever.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Nato had an agreement to increase funding in place before trump was elected. Trump had nothing to do with it. Reportedly trump has often mused about leaving nato because his boss keeps wispering in his ear that we should leave nato. Insanity.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump The iran deal was effectively detering iran from developing nuclear weapons. Trump just hated the deal because it was signed by obama. He just canceled it. No real reason. Iran already recieved (their money back). Canceling the deal didnt require the iranians to return the money.
@Deborah3Warren @JoeySalads @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Has nk made any move to denuclearize? Nope. Isis?

@mightybanker @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Thats cool snow flake, your making observations on what is obviously not something based in reality. There was 10-15k people at the beto  ralley. What your hearing is the crowd at the beto rally. Its cool beta cuck snow flake, your emperor has not clothes.
@TheNatureBoy79 @charliekirk11 Oh no there was 10-15k beto supporters. Trumps rally maxed out at 6500...enjoy the ride to 2020...the orange dotard is going down. https://t.co/jW05yDA5f2

@RedLatinosUSA @charliekirk11 10-15k vs MAX 6500. Ya, an impotent shot heard round the world.
@khorn004 @charliekirk11 Let me guess, blah blah blah rapists horrible crime, fear. Blah blah blah LOCK HER UP! blah blah blah build, i mean finish the wall.

@JacobAWohl @Wikipedia You mean like being a russian asset, you've been convicted of securities fraud and you tried and failed to end  the Mueller probe with a bogus tart who admitted she slept with someone. Good luck douche bag. https://t.co/HqU33yNXX3
@charliekirk11 Got some proof? 100% charlie does not.
@texasgal100 @AOC @heathershorn Jesus, this is ignorant. A person fleeing for their lives should be protected. Hopefully you never find yourself in the same situation.
@RuleDonaldTrump Except we have a russian asset in the oval who is hell bent on doing vladdys bidding.
@realDonaldTrump @KamVTV Its to bad we have a president who can't tell the difference between weather and climate. Here, ill help. If you look outside and see its raining, thats an example of weather. If every year is a new consecutive hottest year recorded in history,  you are seeing climate.
@charliekirk11 Sure, and in two years, health care will be a crisis.

@jjauthor @JacobAWohl I believe you can start your search with the library of congress
@birdrrf @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Can you imagine what it would be if he weren't a Russian asset?
@JacobAWohl @ali Are they russian assets  as well? https://t.co/I3x80qvR6f
@charliekirk11 They are uniformly calling for the gov to resign. Unlike the gop who seem to be comfortable with degenerates carrying their mail.

@mrblack203 @newpaltz2013 @charliekirk11 Except the part where he is a russian asset.
@CR_HIATT @charliekirk11 Oh, brace yourself honey, this is just starting. Trump will be dragged squeeling from the oval in cuffs.
@charliekirk11 I know about 80 million tax dollars has been spent on two years this man shamelessly promoting his golf course. But if you think 30m spent on an investigation that has yeilded hundreds of charges and dozens of indictments, consul yourself with the money taken in is 46m. Sad.
@DrWeld @Karenb1038 @VP @CBSThisMorning @POTUS So you see all the violence? 5k murders per year?
@BillOReilly What if he is the enemy of the people?
RT @SenGillibrand: President Trump seems not to understand that the female jobs he created were Democratic women in Congress.
@BridgetKF30 @david_thomp @POTUS This is all i see. https://t.co/k94BGWgEKq
@RhondaNewton71 @david_thomp @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Why? The gop already has a 5-4 majority on the scotus. Rbg is more or less irrelevant.
@JacobAWohl I'll answer that when you tell us where in the world is jacob wohl. Russian asset https://t.co/LTsQUxyNIq
@MrWyattLA @AOC I don't think we watched the same speech.
@TarekFatah Yes, just listen. She actually gives a crap about what is happening with the middle class. She actually isnt bought and paid for by a super pac. Just listen.
@DrWeld @Karenb1038 @VP @CBSThisMorning @POTUS There are 50k deaths per year resultant from gun violence. 650k families go bankrupt because of inadequate medical coverage per year. Your facts are foxy (tm), almost all criminality regarding ei's is at a 20 year low. This is not a crisis in anybodys mind but our presidents.
@JacobAWohl Names? Your full of shit Jacob, and you are a traitor. https://t.co/gsz50sT0sk
@SamGalia @poppykat2 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump I was about to congratulate you on holding a cival discourse, but  im guess thats about to go out the window. Correction when one is wrong is a sign of integrity not malignancy. Fox on the other hand just quietly removes all mention of the story from their web sight. Ex seth rich
@SamGalia @poppykat2 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Fox isn't a fair shake for the right, its right wing propaganda. I tried to watch tc the other day, its lucky there isnt any real oversight over the news opinion industry. Its disturbing how bent and untruthful they are.
@SamGalia @poppykat2 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Pals in the media like fox? The trouble is guys like david duke know what side their bread is buttered on. The reason it keeps coming out for the gop is they have an inordinately high number of power hungry old white men who are themselves supremacists, or pander to supremacists.
@SamGalia @poppykat2 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump I feel like you are exaggerating just a little. https://t.co/Q1iUWTy7t8
@realDonaldTrump Couldnt get anybody else huh?
@JacobAWohl What do you want to bet it was a court clerk and had nothing to do with mueller? https://t.co/zr2IMdhUvo
@JacobAWohl He sits in the chair of the most powerful position on the planet. That executive makes decisions that effect billions. If that executive is pissing around looking for affirmations from his personal propaganda network and leaves decisions to unelected men we have a serious problem

@ThadFisher @SebGorka @lukerosiak @AriFleischer @Project21News Turn on cnn or msnbc for 5 min. Ill bet you in that period, you will hear the words "he must resign."
RT @jdmiddleton55: @CillizzaCNN Well, that‚Äôs true. 		#ImpeachTrump
@chettchad @CillizzaCNN There is a very clear difference between the intel community being hawkish following 911 and the president contradicting his personally appointed staff of spooks, followed closely by that president refering to his personally appointed staff of spooks a group of uneducated morons
@CillizzaCNN You wouldn't  impeach for doing an awsome job, but you should impeach for conspiring with a forign power to steal the election
@JacobAWohl Sure, if trump agrees to do the same.
