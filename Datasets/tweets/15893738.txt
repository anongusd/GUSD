Why did Colorado's senators vote to condemn Saudi Arabia's crown prince? Too nuanced to tweet. Read FULL statements from Sens. Bennet and Gardner here: https://t.co/pshfsfv2hI #copolitics
For @SenBennetCO, today's vote on Yemen addresses the humanitarian crisis there, but also sends a message about @realDonaldTrump's "inadequate" response to Khashoggi's death, "in effect legitimizing his murder and failing to stand up for press freedom."
Also from @SenCoryGardner after Senate vote on Khashoggi: "I joined my colleagues to trigger the investigations and sanctions against the Saudi gvt, which already resulted in the designation of 17 Saudi individuals under US law that were found to be culpable" in Khashoggi murder.
Statement from @SenCoryGardner after Senate's vote to hold Saudi crown prince responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi: US "cannot be silent on this blatant violation of human rights, and no individual should be exempted from just punishment under US law."

Unaffiliated voters in Colorado have turned in 29% of Colorado ballots. They live in a world dominated by talk about Republican red, Democrat blue and... purple talk. But some are redder or bluer - or greener or golder. They're the ones poised to decide the election. #copolitics
More men in Colorado so far are voting as Republicans or unaffiliated than as Democrats -- 195,400 (R) vs. 170,000 (U) vs. 155,300 (D). #copolitics.
Millennials and other voters in the 18-40 age group are turning in fewer ballots in Colorado. That group accounts for about 20% of voters vs. 32% (41-60 years old) vs. 47% (61 years and older). Voters aged 18-25 are voting at the lowest rate (4.5%). #copolitics
In Colorado, women voters have so far turned in more ballots than men -- 563,700 vs. 528,700. Almost 40% of women are voting as Democrats and 33% as Republicans. #copolitics
So far, 1.1 million voters in Colorado have turned ballots in early, according to Colorado Secretary of State's Office. Republicans and Democrat ballots are nearly equal, meaning the 29% of unaffiliated ballots are a wild card. #copolitics

@laura_eurich Unaffiliated voters are the wild cards in the race. They‚Äôre the biggest group of voters in the state. They‚Äôll decide the election.
Mail ballots for Colorado‚Äôs November election continue to pour in. From the almost 368,000 ballots received so far:	- Republicans = 131,230	- Democrats =  129,008	- Unaffiliated = 103,472
Gender split about even from the almost 368,000 Colorado mail ballots received so far:	- Male = 183,675	- Female = 182,037	- Unknown = 2,215
It always seems to go this way. Older voters mailing back waaay more ballots early in Colorado. Age split from the almost 368,000 turned in so far (this morning‚Äôs official tally):	- 18-25 = 12,804	- 26-40 = 45,763	- 41-60 = 108,054	- 61-70 = 101,636	- 71 and older = 99,670
