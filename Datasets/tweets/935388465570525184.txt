@EvonS777 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @POTUS For the life of me I don't get it. Are they afraid to piss off constituents? Would love to understand thier reasoning. Those that would vote Red want immigration under control. Do they not get that?  #BuildTheWall

@Keds1250878727 @ACTBrigitte You obviously don’t understand the impact illegals have on our society, or the fact that not all are honest with their stories of misfortune. If you personally want to help a foreign family escape a bad life with your own money go for it. https://t.co/8xO8GQBN11
@Keds1250878727 @ACTBrigitte I am certain that crossing the US boarder illegally is not the only option. 		The answer to THEIR problem is not to deplete the US of our resources. We have legal citizens needing services that can’t be met. There has to be controls in place, they’re called laws.

@ABC7Jory The courage it takes to do what is right may not always be popular, yet Trump continuously fights for his people, to keep us safe, to not waste our tax dollars, and so on. For me, that speaks volumes about his character. I LOVE TRUMP!! 👍🏼🇺🇸👍🏼🇺🇸👍🏼		#TrumpTrain	#MAGA

@LiberalNationTV @realDonaldTrump No, not holding you to any standard. Just trying to point out the continuous hate that is being spewed towards someone who is trying to make our country better. When an alarming # of crimes are being done by people from certain countries you protect your people from them. Simple.
@LiberalNationTV @realDonaldTrump This ‘“brainwashed” person thinks the same of you. You’re led by the liberal media pushing their own agenda. Instead of thinking for yourself and looking at the whole picture you just grab on to stupid shit to continue spreading hate... like blasting Trump for Hawaii’s error.
@LiberalNationTV @realDonaldTrump I respect your right to an opinion, but I’m tired of all the petty comments that are constantly being thrown at Trump. Calling him out for the Hawaii incident is super petty. THAT is divisive behavior negatively affecting our country.
@LiberalNationTV @realDonaldTrump It’s not like it was real!!! They are safe. What the hell did you expect Trump to do? It’s not his fault that false alarm happened. Can the man not relax and maybe react to actual emergencies? You critics are just fucking ridiculous and over the top stupid.
@LyndsayWinegard @MyPlace4U @realDonaldTrump So it’s Trumps fault that Hawaii’s alert system fucked up? You’re a moron
