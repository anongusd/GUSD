@steve_durnan @TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 Both articles read.  Quite good ones, thanks for sharing.  I agree with them.  They're in line with what I was taught &amp; read over the decades.  It's been interesting to go from "Nuclear Winter" to "Global Warming" to "Climate change" while the REAL science hasn't changed at all.
@steve_durnan @TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 Got me!  No, I have it open, but didn't read it yet.  Just going off your question. ;)  We'll get new lands either way.  It's just WHERE they are that differs :)
@steve_durnan @TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 Humans are so widely adaptable - the key really is it needs to be gradual change and our societies need to see the trends and plan for them.   Either way - they just need to stop lying and scheming and get back to scientists doing REAL science and not following agendas.
@steve_durnan @TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 But...we can handle a whole lot of cooling.  If the tropics became more seasonal, it would change what grows there - which means crops like wheat &amp; corn....so food still wouldn't be a problem.  And it could open up lands like the Sahara, Gobi and US Southwest.
@steve_durnan @TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 For humans - we want warming.  More livable area would open up.  although more extreme weather events like hurricanes, rainfall. People would likely need to move away from the tropics areas, as they could become too hot.
@TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 I'm with you.  I've yet to hear them address volcanoes - which spew more "greenhouse" gases than human do. Nor that CO2 results in more plants which results in more O2 for us.  Why is that bad?  I wish we had REAL scientists. *sigh*
@TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 Until I see plans being drawn up to rehouse people on coastal/low-lying land and how the infrastructure needs to be changed - I pay no attention to the climate changers. Carbon tax is a scam based on people being gullible.
@elethewaytobe @USATODAY Exactly.  It was just a knock on global warming.  And it was funny!
@washingtonpost Yet you have to have reporters on duty until 2:00 a.m. and back on duty by 4:00 a.m. to report on his tweets.  That's up to  a 22 hour day....or a catch-22 for you guys?
@Variety Someone, presumably a photog, actually wish this guys children dead?  WTF is wrong with these people!!
@TheRedFisher1 @steph93065 The natural pattern looks to me like we're still coming out of the last ice age.  It will keep getting warmer until all the glaciers and ice caps melt. Followed by a gradual cooling as we re-enter a new ice age. The only question is how will we survive it all?

@emilyelarsen @DailyCaller It seems also, that anyone can RUN for POTUS and Congress vetting only happens for the POTUS-elect and VP-elect.  State regulations dictate who gets on ballots and who doesn't.   It really needs to get to SCOTUS for determination to put the whole thing to bed.
@emilyelarsen @DailyCaller SCOTUS hasn't ever actually ruled a specific delineation between the distinct terms of "natural" and "natural born".  They always wind up stopping at saying the people are citizens, they never get down to the actual difference between terms, if any.

@AlenciaJohnson It's WORSE.  The governor was very clear that a baby would be made comfortable, resuscitated if necessary, and then they could make the decision to kill it.   Post-birth abortion is what they want.  Or as normal people call it - MURDER.

@BootsieWalken @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris It was used in writing the US Constitution because it contained all the accepted terminology and definitions.   And no russians here but thanks for playing
@mistymeadow22 @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris That's just being obtuse.  These were COMMON terms that were legally understood.  There was no need to define them.  I can give you my document, which includes a house speech where years later a congressman referenced the term and definition in reference to freeing slaves.
@Kerlens_Feb5Th @mistymeadow22 @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris It's not a want or don't want.  It's eligible vs. NOT eligible. https://t.co/ZShTnQjc2f
@mistymeadow22 @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris NOT an editorial.  It was literally The Law of Nations.  All of Europe and the new USA used it as the basis of their laws.

@BootsieWalken @flwingnut @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris The Constitution does specify the specific term here. https://t.co/eWNZkoTNS7

@WolvesforKamala @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris Incorrect.   I'll have to read the Lynch v. Clarke one late.  But the others were about natural, not natural born.  There a 3 types of citizen - the 3rd being naturalized.  Natural is born here OR to citizens.  Natural born is born here AND to citizens.

@Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris This may help you understand. https://t.co/qDCdJKWTOl
@WolvesforKamala @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris Nope.  She's a natural citizen, but she is not a national born citizen.  Natural born requires citizen parents and birth on nation's soil.  Her parents weren't citizens.
@flwingnut @Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris Her parents weren't citizens when she was born.  That's the difference between natural citizen and natural born citizen.  Natural born requires birth to citizen parents on the nation's soil.
@Kerlens_Feb5Th @mandy_macleod @KamalaHarris She  is not constitutionally eligible.  Period.   (and ftr - she was born in the US, so she is a natural citizen, but because of her parents, she's not "natural born".  A distinct difference.)

@robinsonliberty @B039Benjamin @Timcast I have semi's coming in every day and they definitely do not load or unload.  Many drivers don't even get out of the cab if it's an unload. They wait and then come out to get the signatures on the paperwork.
@saschap1983 @Timcast That's why this is news.  Trucking companies have been paying so poorly that people left the field and no one joined it.  We are in dire need of drivers here now - so the pay is coming back up.
@robinsonliberty @B039Benjamin @Timcast Not semi-drivers.  Last I checked, they are only responsible for securing their load.  They don't load or unload.   Non-union drivers may have different rules - but if it needs a forklift to move - they aren't doing it.

@jamesplake721 But there's nothing nefarious in someone from the Trump team asking Stone if he's heard anything from Wikileaks, or if he can ask around.  And nothing seems to show that Stone got any actual details, just that drops were coming on HRC and I'm guessing Podesta.  Which we all knew.
@jonallendc Who are person 1 and person 2?
@Eevildebs But who's gonna even ask, officially, why CNN was tipped off?  Sadly, it looks like they've got Stone on witness tampering.  The perjury charges are pretty weak, but ugh on that tampering.  Still, nothing to do with Trump, his staff, or Russian collusion.

@Jimmyspolitics @mschlapp From your article: "Fewer than 800 people have illegally crossed from Canada into the U.S. annually over the past five years compared to hundreds of thousands apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in that same time period."  I rest my case.
@SwayngimSusan @OmarHamada @nususan1 Oops.  My bad!  LOL   But you know someone is going to!
@mitchellvii I've come to the conclusion that he's waiting for the Dems to turn on Pelosi and remove her.  She's showing them that she's unreasonable and wants to be dictator.
@OmarHamada @nususan1 I can't wait for the first video that comes out where the doctor says, "Ok.  Before you start pushing, do you want an abortion?"   I guarantee you that someone is going to sue because they didn't know it was an option.  Not an option they wanted, but that they weren't told = $$$

And the plan becomes clear.  The stand-off is going to take down Pelosi and probably Chuckles too.  The rank-and-file isn't going to stay in file much longer - they're going to remove her over this.  Just need to wait it out. https://t.co/Zk8yBm7iHm

@Jimmyspolitics @mschlapp As soon as you convince everyone south of the border to obey our laws and not cross illegally - we'll take that deal.  It's a sad reality - but we need a wall because of that reason.  We don't need one on the north because both nations people don't really care to break the law.
@mschlapp That's been clear to us since this started.  Glad you finally caught up to the facts on this.
@KamalaHarris They've missed one check.  What is the House doing?  Adjourning to Monday.  Going to Puerto Rico.  Taking vacations.  How about you DO YOUR JOBS and negotiate with the GOP and get the wall built and people paid?   And you want to be POTUS (which aren't Constitutionally eligible)?
@SenSherrodBrown @TheJusticeDept You mean, they'd have to spend time with their 4 yr old?  What a horror!  Most parents would be thrilled to have time off (that they'll get paid for later) to spend time with their little ones.  I have empathy for the stress of the situation but we NEED the wall! #BuildTheWall

I'm thinking (always a scary thing!) - I wonder if POTUS is trying to force bipartisan negotiations to happen by not waivering on the wall.  We all know he can get it done by just declaring an emergency.  So far, it's the only thing that's making sense to me. Thoughts?
@PeterSweden7 @2braptuedbyJC77 This is the very first time I'm hearing about it.  Not even the patriot youtubers have picked it up.
@suesuepix @sjc1435 @SebGorka @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They can use the White House youtube, facebook and twitter accounts to live stream.  And if the other MSM channels don't cover it - that will wake even MORE people up to the backdoor coup attempt.
@Halsey_lilac @byteme1944 @SebGorka @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump But he has to be careful if that's the plan. People will want to know why he didn't do it sooner.  He's waiting on something or he'd have done it already.

@Cernovich That's my knee jerk reaction too.  But one thing I've learned  - Trump always has a really good reason for his decisions.  We just have to wait and see what happens.  I'm hoping the House goes up against Pelosi on this and maybe even removes her.

@realDonaldTrump Well.  This is only the 2nd time in 2 years that I've disagreed with your decision.  I think that's a pretty good average.  I don't think it's her perogative, hopefully someone in the house reads their rules - it's not the Speaker's choice here. https://t.co/8YV3dg7y10

@DougieFreshii And we didn't name the new guy President - we just recognize his authority to assume the office based on Venezuela's own laws.
@DougieFreshii From what I've heard, the US is just vocalizing support but not actively getting involved.  We've called on the other nations of S. America to be the ones to intervene - if anyone is going to.  This is when I ask, why do we have a UN - if not for these situations.
@englertj @LukeEverhart1 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I think that's the answer.  So all we have are their rules to interpret.  And some have posted that the Constitution grants POTUS power to convene both houses, making it a joint session, which means Speaker's rule of the hall don't apply.  And thank you for your research too!
@DougieFreshii Wikipedia has a pretty good outline of what happened: https://t.co/b0Uz5Bgp5b
@DougieFreshii Going from memory - he basically called the election void and stayed in office, tried to suspend their version of Congress and I think he even ordered the military to remove them.  But I could be wrong on some of it.
@englertj @LukeEverhart1 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The way I read it, it would be any representative that calls for the Committee to be called into session - during a House session.  But I could be wrong - I can't find anything concise on it and I'm too tired to dig more tonight.  It has to be on the clerk's page somewhere.
@thehill You know that this isn't new news right?  We've known this for years already.

@englertj @LukeEverhart1 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump But the House Rules cover it.  The Committee of the Whole are the one's that make the decision, not the Speaker.  And the Speaker's House Hall control does not apply to joint sessions of Congress.   I think they're counting on us not reading their rule book.

@Hauwertsr @chuckwoolery AND....every state has their own rules for allowing a person on a ballot.  There have to be some that require Constitutional eligibilty be proven before they get on those ballots.  Although, that didn't stop Rubio or Cruz from being allowed to run.  Or Obama.
@Hauwertsr @chuckwoolery Orly is correct. From my research, anyone can run for POTUS.  It's only after they get elected that it falls to Congress to verify the eligibility of the POTUS-elect and the VP-elect.  But I like to call it fraud - that they collect money, fully knowing they aren't qualified.
@RepDougCollins @POTUS Is she allowed to do that?  According to House rules, SOTU is voted on by the Committee of the Whole.  Also, the Speaker's control of the Hall doesn't apply to joint sessions.  See what you can do to overturn her!

@hughhewitt Kamala Harris can run as anything she wants - but she's not eligible for POTUS or VP.  Neither of her parents were US citizens when she was born, making her not "natural born" but only "natural".

@michaelbeatty3 @DariusVolket and neither of parents were American citizens.  and I raised in Montreal.  I don't meet the Constitutional requirements to be POTUS.  But don't let that stop you from giving me money and voting for me!

@Tony19542 @BreitbartNews These people are why I don't jump on the prolife bandwagon.  I'd rather they'd get abortions than see those poor babies abused and tortured by women that shouldn't be mothers.  If you can brag about having abortions - then you should NEVER be a mother.
@TweetOfTriston @RealMAGASteve @RealTT2020 @FoxNews The graphic is made and held for when/if it's needed.

@votevets @ERICBALFOUR LIES!!  He's Lying!!!  It's been proven.
@ERICBALFOUR @KamalaHarris Do you care that she's Constitutionally disqualified from the position of POTUS or VP?
@NeverKamala2020 @KamalaHarris Which is how Obama got illegally approved for office.  Kamala has ZERO parents born on US Soil.  Natural Born requires of the blood and of the soil - so parents must be citizens and person must be born on the land.  I can give you document on it if you'd like :)
@DarleneHBrook Phillips is guilty of Stolen Valor.  Unless I misread something.

#MLKDay When white people believe in the words of the good doctor to our very soul and black people keep telling us we're racist for not considering their color when we make judgements or decisions.  Maybe it's time for the black community to heed his words too?  #Unity #MAGA
@Liz_Wheeler And a whole generation of us grew up believing this and following it.  Now we're called racist because we don't consider color in making decisions about people. #MLKDay
@ScottPresler @GayRepublicSwag Easy peasy!  She's not a natural born citizen.  She's not qualified per the Constitution.
@KamalaHarris Are you aware that you are not qualified to be POTUS?  You need to be a natural born citizen, which is different than a natural citizen.  Neither of your parents were citizens when you born.  This disqualifies you from POTUS and VP positions.
@NascarChuck336 @SenKamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump I hadn't realized this!  Nor did I know she grew up in Canada!  Has anyone checked to be sure she didn't become a Canadian citizen while up there?
@NBCNews If only people would listen the words of MLKJr.   We'd never be in the mess we are today.  A whole generation of us grew up not noticing skin color because no one should be judged by their outsides.  Now we're told that's racist.  Dr. King would be very sad. :(

AND let's invoke that 30 day thing where we don't have to rehire anyone that's been furloughed.  Deflate the bloat and reduce costs.
@SenSchumer @SecNielsen The real question is who let people purchase lands right up to the border?  Which Congress &amp; POTUS lacked the foresight to withhold a perimeter of land for our security?   1000 yards would have been sufficient.  Now pay these people market rate and invoke eminent domain for it.

@dmodmodmo @RedNeckTexAsian @mmkck20 @TheDemocrats Welcome to the world of construction.  If you're non-union - you don't get paid when you don't work.  Rarely paid vacation benefits either.  If you're union, you get lay-off pay which is a fraction of normal pay.  If you work a half day - you don't get the other half paid at all.
@dmodmodmo @RedNeckTexAsian @mmkck20 @TheDemocrats If you don't like the employment agreement - then you don't take the job.  As said, if you need monthly security, you don't become a roofer - where you don't work when it snows.  Yes.  I know it affects the private sector - but they work in DC, they know the score there too.
@dmodmodmo @RedNeckTexAsian @mmkck20 @TheDemocrats They should have read their contracts and made sure they could put money away to at least cover them for a couple months of no pay.   It's right in there that they may be furloughed if Congress doesn't pass the budget. A roofer plans to not work in winter - they don't whine.

@KamalaHarris Why is Paradise relying on Federal efforts.  California state should be handling the majority of the issue.   Paradise city itself needs to step up too.   As far as I'm concerned, California should be cut off from federal help.  My state has bridges and roads that need fixing.
@corgratech @tedhood16 @CNN Of course.  That's why it always starts  "let's just assume this is true, then..."  "presuming this is true, what's  next?" etc.  They run with the narrative, don't make it clear that it's speculation unless you catch the first sentence of the segment.
@ItsRaisu @ericpalmsprings @Dsquared75 @TGiel012061 @GarrettHaake @SpeakerPelosi @GOP That is what POTUS said that Oval Office presser with Pelosi and Schumer.  He didn't have the 10 votes to get to 60 and Schumer wasn't willing to negotiate to get them.  That was BEFORE the new electees came in.  Pelosi pushed this "majority" narrative then and continues it now.
@Dsquared75 @TGiel012061 @GarrettHaake @SpeakerPelosi The Administration had several plans.  Pelosi didn't care to hear them.  Nor has she brought any plan to the WH.  She's not even tried to enter into negotiations.  Which require both parties to have a plan to start with - then you compromise. She just doesn't want to.
@Lexa_Merica I'm still trying to figure out when/where the WH gave out their commercial flight plan.  Telling them they can fly commercial isn't the same as publishing an itinerary.

@ChadPergram I don't see it.  I just read through and find nothing about Congress go into war zones to check on anything.  It actually seems that once Congress has declared war, the entire running goes to the POTUS.  Congress then just controls the purse strings every 2 years.

@allahpundit @German_Pisan215 The best I can give that report would be that maybe possibly the POTUS could have said "well.  don't volunteer it."   And even that is a big stretch.  The man is not stupid.
@TylerJordaneh @bamanicky @Tony19542 It doesn't matter.  POTUS cancelled his holidays, and his trip to Brussels.  He went halfway around the world, met with our troops in mulitple locations for Xmas AND was back in less than 24 hours.  Ready to meet with the Dems on 12/26.  He's still waiting.

@signup55765001 @mike_knoke Exactly.  We have to make 30 days for all those jobs to go away.  And if POTUS can work with roughly 500 less people than his predecessors - he can make the entire government run on 800,000 fewer.  And now that there is a glut of civilian jobs - those people can easily find one.
@thehill I love how the Senate is actually still working while the House is vacationing and recessing.   Can we fire the House and reelect an entirely new group?
@Tony19542 @gatewaypundit It's killing me that the Dems haven't made a counter offer on the wall.  In the meantiime, POTUS keeps inching up the amount he wants.  He likely was willing to take $2.5b and was hoping to get $3.5b.   Now that he's got it near $6b - he's not gonna settle for less than the $5.
@StappElizabeth @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer Now we wait and see what Mexico does.  IF they're smart, they'll ASK the US military to join them on the Guatemala border to keep the caravan from getting into Mexico at all.
@Mgrimm93796220 @CHueyBurns @EliStokols Also notice how short POTUS' trips were.  Even going to ME, Germany and then back at the WH in under 24 hours.  I bet it would have been even quicker if the pilot's and plane didn't need breaks and refueling.
@navymomkelly @druce @CHueyBurns Exactly!  POTUS cancelled his trip because of the shutdown.  Heck, he cancelled Xmas and New  Year's Eve too.   He's just rambling around the empty WH waiting on the Demonrats......who are busy being every where EXCEPT Capitol Hill.
@SpeakerPelosi Maybe you should have talked to POTUS instead of the reporters?  #Grounded
@kevincorke @LeaderHoyer POTUS is right.  Since shut down started, @Pelosi took a Hawaiian vacation, opened the session for a whole 10 minutes, recessed it for a week or so.

@thehill We stand with POTUS.  We want the wall.  And the crisis is real.
@RepSwalwell This quote would be appropriate to give to President Lincoln leading up to the Civil War.  But it's in no way applicable to the border wall of today.  It scares me that you're in Congress.
@ZRanchLady @Lrihendry @Benstrauss7 @PlaysTrumpCard What I'd heard was that Obama visited GHWB just days before he died.  I think both deaths were hastened for optimal distraction by the demonrats.  But it's just a thought, I'm not married to it.

Since  "King Cyrus" is trending, may as well give people a chance to watch this video on him and @POTUS.  Enjoy. https://t.co/184mU2GFTp
@Next_Gen_GOP The comparison was more that God chooses imperfect men to see that his will is done.  And what POTUS was being chosen for was similar. The referenced video has been out for over 3 years.  MSM should start reporting on 2017 events any day now.

@IngrahamAngle I think the first question to ask is - what will Mexico do?  Will they let another group storm through their border?  or will the ask for our help and put an end to it down there?  IF Mexico kept their border secure, we wouldn't need so much wall here.
@TheSteveKon @ScottAdamsSays And they ignore that now that we have oil and ng for heat, there are MORE trees.  Trees need CO2 and give us O2 in return.  Which we need.
@ScottAdamsSays @JimW_in_NM So?  We're still discovering cities underwater - proving that the seas were once much lower.  Civilization survived.  And it will continue on as we continue to exit the last ice age.  As ice layers thin, they melt faster - even if temperature remains the same.
@MAGA_NextGen @ScottAdamsSays And last I checked, tree rings are in agreement with the ice core readings.
@real_DickNation @ScottAdamsSays Which is the proof that they are inflating the situation.  If it was real, we'd see a determined plan to empty the coastal areas and river plains in preparation for rising sea levels.
@CampersHaven @ScottAdamsSays Now to fine the few brave knowledgeable people, willing to suicide their careers by going against the acceptable.  Science should not be political, nor have "accepted norms".  From climate change to medicine to the human timeline - we haven't seen science done in decades.
@ToddTraut @ScottAdamsSays The same with all the scientists in any field.  You go with the accepted position or you don't get grant money. If your experiment doesn't agree - then you did it wrong. They lie to work.
@PKThomahawk @ScottAdamsSays In the 70's we were going to deep in the depths of nuclear winter by 2000.  And out of room for our garbage.  And out of fossil fuels.    In 20 years we've gone from global warming to climate change - so I'm sure the ice age scenario shall return soon.
@ScottAdamsSays Climate change is natural. We've been a whole lot hotter, and the planet's natural state is to be covered with ice.  This does not mean we should not be good custodians of the environment et al. We need to prepare  for the upcoming changes.  Like moving people in from the coasts.

@consmover Let's not be confused. With our 2 newest Justices, legislating from the bench has come to an end.  Laws are laws.  SCOTUS' job is to determine constitutionality.  Period.  If we don't like the laws, then you pressure CONGRESS to change them.  Period.
@BillKristol You can never get rid of extremes but we already recaptured the conservative party that has been too far right for years.  We're now watching the extreme liberals jumping off the cliff while the rest join us back toward the middle.
@gaujamesgau @tedhood16 I concur.  POTUS already did it for anyone who works in the WH or whom he appoints.  Just need to have it extended.
@MSNBC Uhm...last time I checked, it's CONGRESS that creates bills and their wording.  POTUS can only sign bills into law.   Quick refresher:  https://t.co/GZ0SrPcrek

@CalTweet04 @NBCNews It was about Grant beating Lee.  Both great generals - but Grant, from Ohio, was better.  NBC is lying to you.
@dasBechstein @NBCNews He was talking about Ohioan Ulysses S Grant being a BETTER general that Lee.  NBC is lying to you.

Just a quick reminder:  Somehow these allegations of Ford about Kavanaugh have morphed into he raped her.  That's not at all what she said.  She thought he MIGHT rape her if it had continued.  And there are so many holes in her story - that he didn't even might have.

@spotmegone @TheLastRefuge2 After the first break, her hair was even messier.  I LOL'd!  And those glasses! Clearly not hers.  She couldn't read through them and she couldn't see distance either, as she kept looking over them.  Used solely to make her look dowdy, ditzy and myopic.
@RepAdams LIAR!  The committee has investigated ALL the allegations and seemingly found them to be completely unsubstantiated.  Furthermore - the PUBLIC has thoroughly investigated them and found them to be complete set-ups.  Dems overplayed their hand and outed themselves as weasels.
@SassCBrown That's close to my assessment as well.  But I'm leaning toward her ex-bf &amp; his brother, the lookalike, that introduced her to Kavanaugh.  The resemblance would make it easy for her to transfer the identity to Kavanaugh, a face she saw in the news.

@MrsInkPanther @Burnebob @Queenofvarona @massey61 @GOPLeader Most states require birth cert. &amp; SS card to get a DL or State ID.  That shows your citizenship except in the most rare circumstances.
@MrsInkPanther @Burnebob @Queenofvarona @massey61 @GOPLeader And you get on the register by sending in a postcard.  I think the first time you vote, you have to bring in the dl and utility bill.  After that just your DL.   I voted for years in the wrong district, keeping my mom's house as my main residence.  Never voted for coucilmen then.

@MeetThePress It's an affidavit that proves nothing.  It's nothing but conjecture and hearsay.  Spiking the punch is not a crime - it's expected.  Doesn't say that Kavanaugh participated in "trains" - just that he may have been at the parties where they occurred.  And who says "grain alcohol"?

@helenfromsun @StevePratico That drives me crazy. Here, you'll see multi-lingual signs, but nothing exclusively in another language. We have a lot of gang problems - but no ethnicity based ones.  People seem to assimilate when they get here.  Maybe it's because we're such a blue collar area? No room for bs.

@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne There are so many RINO's and NeverTrumpers in Congress.  The Republicans are the majority in name only.  Trump's swamp draining isn't partisan.  They ALL need to be flushed.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne To clarify:  I'm not a republican.  I was a life long blue collar democrat.  My party left me.  I'm a Trump supporter and an American.  That's my party.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne The left threatens violence and murder to people who disagree.  They even threaten the children of politicians.  It's the right that are the calm rational voices.  We'll talk to anyone.  And we like to laugh.  The left doesn't laugh at anything.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne You should #walkaway.  Come to the right.  You'll find that we only seek out truth.  We actually discuss and debate all the things.  Our only commonality is support for the USA and for the POTUS.  You should see the raging debates on Sessions.  Brutal.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne The Russia narrative began in the August debate between Trump and Clinton.  SHE brought it up and the left has been running with it ever since.  Congress has found virtually no evidence beyond what I already mentioned.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Obama blatantly tried to interfere in Israel's election.  Look what we did in Iran. Iraq.  Multitude of banana republics.   The USA is the last country that should be whining about this.  And flat out - Russia did NOTHING as far as actual votes went.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne The Russia evidence is that they spent a few million to run some ads, form fake groups and organize some events - for BOTH sides.  The China evidence hasn't come out yet - but HISTORICALLY - they're our cyber enemy.  ALL countries interfere in elections.  The USA especially.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne I've been complaining since it happened.  What is it now - 6 media organizations control ALL our news.   THAT is a problem.  Especially now that they're trying to shut down independent news from the internet.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Very good.  But they're NOT saying it.  They're still claiming to be free speech platforms open to the public.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne How is free speech regulating anything?  Like I said, is the major platforms want to be leftist, that's fine. They just need to SAY it.  Instead, their using suppression algorithms and lying about it.  And w/the way their deleting things, they're becoming publishers, not services
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne FTC because it's a for profit company.  False advertising is their purview.  FCC because the internet is still theirs.  There's an agreement that the 2 agencies work together on these issues.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne I'm happy to get back to you on this in the morning.  But as I said....bedtime for me :)
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne It's been fun.  But sadly, I must bid you adieu and head to bed.  5:00 am comes early these days.  Sleep tight and have a great week üòÉ
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Try this.  Run a search and set the time frame for BEFORE 12/31/14.  Look through the results.   China has been the major hacking entity for almost 20 years -  including election interference.  IIRC, they even got into the Pentagon system.  Russia was just business as usual.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Not at all.  But we're seeing serious infringements on free speech.  Here, FB and even Google is suppressing right wing news sites.  Either they declare they are liberal platforms only, or they are lying to the consumer.  Which violates FTC regulations, and likely FCC as well.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne I have wealth and power?  That's funny.   I don't beat people up.  I try to point out the truth to them.  I'm not a fan of lies.  Especially from the media.  And you can see most of my tweets are to corporations or those in the public eye.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne So a red X triggered you?  That's kind of silly.  Especially when you weren't fully informed on it's meaning.  But we cleared that up.  And as soon as Twitter takes me off the quality ban, I'll take down the X's. üòÄ
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Now we're having dialogue.  It just took you a half dozen tweets to get to it.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Hey!  We agree on something.  Snowflakes are incapable of debate. They think we should make decisions based on only feeling.  Facts make their heads hurt.  So they shout and scream and call names instead.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne You're deflecting again.  And I'm not a "buddy" and I don't like swearing.  And it's CHINA not Russia that are the ones behind the most interference.  Russia by all Congressional reports only nominally tried to influence.  The same level that always have. And same as the US does
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne I have no tolerance for any of the above.  And yes, election interference.  They done made the mistake of suppressing Republican Congressmen.  Twitter's in big trouble with several govt agencies if they don't stop.  POTUS and Congress aren't going to allow it.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne You made the choice to engage me in conversation. So who's trying to drive whom out of the forum?  If I wanted a forum where everyone agrees with me, I'd use Gab.   Maybe you'd do better over at Yabberz.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Free speech is hard for snowflakes.  The internet in general isn't a safe space and in general no one cares if they hurt your feelings.  It's your choice what you read and where you visit.  Take responsibility for yourself.  It's called L-I-F-E.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne I'm always polite.  But nice attempt at deflecting from your own behavior.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne They claim to be a platform for free speech - testified to Congress that they are.  If they want to just be a leftist platform, that's fine - then they need to say so.  Otherwise, their suppressing opposing voices put them in the realm of election interference.
@SteveRDaugh @thehill @therealroseanne Check your settings - bet you have the quality filter turned off, which is why you can see me.   And 2) It's free speech for all, or free speech for none.  Which side are you on?  As the POTUS said - let everyone talk and let people decide for themselves who's tell the truth.
@seanhannity Canada has already screwed themselves by sitting out the first round.  They now have less negotiating power than if they'd come to the table before, or even with Mexico.   If they keep waiting, they're going to have to negotiate TWO trade deals, instead of being part of this one.

@Nowhere68 @CNN Or it's you.   NAFTA is defunct.  This is a whole new agreement - with or without Canada's participation.  If Canada stays out, once this agreement is signed - Canada will have NO trade agreement with the USA or with Mexico.  That's gonna be painful.
@Nancee1 @CNN Some things are too big for even CNN to ignore.  But they've completely buried this and prefer to talk gloriously about McCain - whom they hated a few short years ago.  The very epitome of #FakeNews
@Nowhere68 @StrawnBob @CNN 1)  There's a briefing of it publicly available - we just don't have the nitty gritty details yet.  2)  It puts an end to NAFTA.  Canada now gets to decide if it wants to participate with this deal, or if they prefer to negotiate with the US &amp; Mex. individually.
@kjmpalermo @CNN We know what Trump wanted, we know what he promised and many understand negotiating - so most people have a good idea what's going to be in the details.  The market is just showing it's confidence that it's going to be very beneficial to the USA.
@Thepowerdresser @CNN Not really. Canada is a beneficiary of our strength - we are THEIR significant and strategic partner.   Too bad Trudeau thought Trump was bluffing.  Now Canada has even less to bring to the table.  Trudeau's arrogance is gonna cost Canada big time.
@Turntablez @CNN It plays a role. Today's spike, along with the steady increase over the last 18 months has been more a vote of confidence of the direction the US is going. The increase in the market, then fuels the economy as people see it in their portfolios, then they gain confidence to spend.

@diary_jim And this is why men have traditionally hung out in the den, basement or garage and the women in the kitchen, dining or living rooms.  The people who came up with open concept living areas - were naive or pulling a fast one.  Now there's no escape for the men.  LOL
@ChrisPB81528298 Correct.  Now we have a POTUS who BELIEVES in blue collar jobs and trade schools.  There's a new push into those trades.  Including trucking.  It's become OK to not go to college.  Like I said, hopefully the new crop of drivers will be there when the trucks are ready.
@joepabike @SecondLady @VP @kilmeade @FoxNews @foxnation @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS Not really odd.  When you look at Trump's lifestyle before taking office, it really wasn't conducive to having a dog.  On the go all the time, long hours.  Not good things for a dog.  He's every bit as busy now, unless Barron wants a pet - there won't be any.  And that's ok.

@dbongino cont 3.....if ISP belongs to the FTC - well, I'm not totally sure.  I think an entirely new set of rules would need to be drawn up from scratch - so we'd likely get neutrality as part of it.  Or some huge amount of red tape involving transparency to consumers.
@dbongino cont 2....Once you have jurisdiction assigned, then you know which set of rules the ISP's need to follow.  If ISP's are deemed telephony - then net neutrality becomes a non-issue, since just like phone companies, their sole job is to provide communication services on demand.
@dbongino cont....Whether internet falls under either  agency - should cable and phone companies continue to operate as ISP's? or is that too much of a monopoly, making it impossible for ISP only companies to even exist....as they once did.
@dbongino We still need net neutrality - but the repealed version didn't fix the core issue.  Before we can do anything - they have to fully resolve who's jurisdiction do ISP's belong to.  Are they under the umbrella of the FCC as a telecom or are they under the FTC?

@google I know you don't want conservatives voting - but why are you burying the League of Women Voters site in favor of sites like vox &amp; NYT when I search "Ohio Voting 2018"?  STOP IT!!

@NeverKamala2020 Geez!   I'll never get that far.
@NeverKamala2020 I play that one occasionally.  Haven't gotten far because I went back to play the extra levels.  So I think I'm only up to level 3 now, but I had only gotten to 9 or 10 before that.
@NeverKamala2020 Out of curiousity, which game?  I have a few that I like to play, FB is good for that.  I'll happily keep wasting their servers to play games that I never pay a dime to play.
@NeverKamala2020 I found an extension that does it all for me.  I'll still use FB until another alternative shows up, I do have friends there to interact with, but I'll be scrubbing it weekly or maybe monthly - haven't decided yet.
I'm deleting my entire Facebook wall.  And boy is it satisfying.  Watching 10 years of history just disappearing.  I've already been slowly extricating myself from the google ecosphere.  I'm already on Gab - so leaving twitter will be the easiest.

@gregrej @realDonaldTrump They can't dump it if there's no one to buy it.  And they can't cash it out if we decide they're an enemy.  Then it becomes worthless paper.  If the US wanted to - we could eliminate more than 75% of our debt in 48 hours - half of our debt isn't real debt anyway.
@Thomas1774Paine We need an American company to step up to the plate.  I have an 4 yr old Huawei and it's still superior to the new phones coming out now.  The tech that Asian consumers can buy is years ahead of what's sold in the US.  We get pared down versions of all of it.
@fox8news Just wait until he screws them like I screwed Cleveland.  He's getting old, you paid him a lot of money - 10 to 1 he misses half this first season with his recurrent back injury.
@thehill She can appreciate LeBron's good works and that doesn't mean Trump was wrong in calling him dumb, or that she disagrees with POTUS in that regard.  Those in the know locally think LeBron's dumb and an arrogant asshat and a turncoat - but still can appreciate his school project.

@MikayesFiona It's short vs. long game thinking and planning.  That's why they were so quick to offer farmer's relief.   It was only going to be needed short term. The EU seeing we were ready to wait it out after China - got them to the table.  I'm not even sure the relief will be used now.
@EricNuggets @RichardReichle And conifers are built to live through fires.  They like fire.  Some even need fire to release seeds,  as well as to provide good soil and areas to grow new trees.  So it's not surprising to see them living through the worst of fires.
@pbmcc88 @CBSNews They did.  https://t.co/X1cQkD36xp  and https://t.co/kdSveWCYeD    But being down a vote in SCOTUS - left it to Trump to finish it off.
@gregrej @realDonaldTrump That's the war part of the tariffs.  It takes time for the deals to be made.  And always remember one thing - the USA is the ONLY nation that can be completely self-sufficient.  Other nations need US, we do not need them. We just have to weather some rough patches to do it.

You never know when the most absurd idiotic theory is going to spur someone else to the reach the truth!!
@CBSNews How can a judge order an ILLEGAL executive order be enforced?  POTUS has been more than accomodating in it's reversal.  It's CONGRESS that's failing.  Fire that judge and put him in remedial constitution education class.
@ThomasWictor Overall the cops did a good job in Portland this time - but....  These guys that got hit and the girl that got her hat taken - the cops did nothing to stop it and then did nothing to help.  Clearly, some Portland cops are anti-America.
@ShannonFox_ And even without the pedo connection - I wouldn't trust James as far as I could throw him.  He's a turncoat.  Screwed Cleveland how many times?  He is not a good man.
@gregrej @realDonaldTrump Until the negotiations are signed.  His goal is ZERO tariffs on both sides.  America is ramping up manufacturing plants all over - we'll be ready.  Our economy will boom.  Those who don't offer us equal trade will suffer as we stop buying their goods.  The USA is in good hands.

@gregrej @realDonaldTrump Raise minimum wage and the cost of living goes up.  A few get that raise, millions and millions more essentially get a pay cut.  Minimum wage goes up, companies hire fewer people.  Economy declines.  Snowball is rolling down hill.  That's the twittersize version of the issue.
