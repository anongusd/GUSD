Watch @savannahguthrie and @williegeist’s full interview with “Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed.		The controversial new HBO documentary premieres this weekend and details troubling abuse allegations against Michael Jackson. https://t.co/b4lsnFL7Pg
“Had either Wade or James told anybody in their lives…about the abuse they say they suffered? Or have they lived with this up until they sat down with you?” @WillieGeist asks “Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed https://t.co/AXpqXvMUFC
“The mothers, who are like key figures in my 4-hour film, describe how they saw Jackson as a son. They felt great love for him…it’s chilling b/c Jackson inserted himself, ingratiated himself into these very ordinary families so he could sexually abuse their children.” -Dan Reed https://t.co/4xebrzGZXF
“One of the other criticisms is this is about money for James and Wade. Have either of them been paid to be in your documentary?” @WillieGeist asks “Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed https://t.co/ehWEGRUjyU
“Once I’d interviewed Wade &amp; James at great lengths, I then went and tried to find anything in the record…that would contradict/undermine their story, and I couldn’t find anything.” -“Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed https://t.co/uYw3Hjg26y
“The film isn’t about Michael Jackson. It’s about Wade and James, who are very much alive. Secondly, Jackson is dead, and he’s not here to defend himself. But we include the rebuttals that he made while he was alive.” -“Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed https://t.co/IeodJCkqt7
“I think it’s because we have direct testimony from the little boys, or the young men now, who actually suffered the abuse. And I think it’s the first time that that’s happened.” “Leaving Neverland” director Dan Reed on why documentary is so compelling https://t.co/vxsw0DNHsl
