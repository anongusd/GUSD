@maxrieper 1. No, demand for a third party ebbs and flows, and tends to crater after a hotly contested election (see how low it fell in 2004, for instance)		2. No idea! The social con/economic populist quadrant is traditionally underserved but Trump at least *rhetorically* serves that

watch the credit for our victory redound entirely to his predecessor. For crying out loud, the international coalition he put together won a ground war in the Middle East in *100 hours*! And then, the American people in 1992 decided they'd rather have a President who seemed to
redound to the man who beat him. He managed the quiet finale of the Cold War without any shots fired, giving the Soviet Union the space to fail and then helping them rebuild while presiding over the largest reduction in the number of nuclear warheads of any US President...only to
