@LockedOnAngels Will Shohei see increased ABs as the season goes? He wants it and looks like he is earning it.
@Angels Love this offense!
@LockedOnAngels Hind sight is 20/20! Lol

@TrentRushSports Looking good for the bullpen so far. Maybe a decent day of rest, dare I say?
@TrentRushSports @LockedOnAngels Yeah, much better than past 2 seasons...but his age is what it is.

@LockedOnAngels So far, I'm impressed!
@LockedOnAngels Let's see what we got with Morris. I'm intrigued by him so far.
@LockedOnAngels Come on Starters! Time to pick it up! Bullpen has been solid but I worry about how long they can hold it up.
@LockedOnAngels Nice to see Jup crush it!

@RamsPodcast I like it. Cooks is less risk (money) than  OBJ. OBJ is like playing with TNT at this point, he has the potential to melt down at anytime, despite the talent. Cooks has a lot of talent in his own right.
@LockedOnAngels Awesome to see!
@LockedOnAngels Way to go down and get that!
@A_Rhodes77 @LockedOnAngels Good point. However, if given the choice between 1 ace or 3 solid starters, I'll take the 3 solid starters. If Heaney and Skaggs could live up to potential and GRich have a "good" season, that would benefit the team more.
@LockedOnAngels Will the Jahmi Jones/2nd base experiment work? What are your predictions (ERA, W-L, WAR) for the 6 starters in 2018? What is Houston's biggest weakness? Will Moreno stick with Socicia no matter how the team performs this season? Just a few to start a good conversation
@LockedOnAngels How do the minor team affiliates work? How are they contracted and how do teams determine which club to use? I remember a long time ago, Lake Elsinore Storm used to be with the Angels but now they are with Padres.
@RogerLodge7 @Angels @MikeTrout Salmon over Fergosi, Percy over Weaver (CLOSE but closed out WS win), Erstad over Tori (More time with team and was heart when here). Idk if Ryan beats out Salmon after joining Rangers and staying there too. Vladdy should be where Ryan is in bracket and be in finals.

@LockedOnAngels The bigger question is which one will avoid the DL this season. Hopefully all of them, but I'll vote for Tropeano just because of his latest ST starts.
@pepeisacat @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks @Broncos Idk what this post has to do with Goersuch, but I doubt you have read any of his court opinions at all. You must not have the proper definition of fascism because he clearly is not. And what does John Elway have to do with it, he is not an owner???
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks That is how it should be handled. With both sides coming to an agreement. But the owners are still the employer, since they are signing the paychecks and have every right to make sure their employees are not make political statements at work. Just like the NBA.
@Delta7900 @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Because the military pays the private business to be there. It's economics, not patriotism.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Ideas are nice, but we have to fit everything into practical  applications. Case law supports employers limiting free speech while at work.
@NFL_All_Access1 @darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Who is the one constantly calling people names and calling then "dummy." Despite my disagreement with you, I have not attacked you. Your response shows that you have been called a troll more than once. Gee, I wonder why? Lmao
@NFL_All_Access1 @darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Says the troll! I wish you peace, love and happiness.
@NFL_All_Access1 @darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks It's called auto correct. But kudos for knowing basic grammer.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Lol. A intellectual thinker you are clearly not. Let's base decisions off "feelings" and not logic or reason, much less law.
@NFL_All_Access1 @darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Your kidding, Right? Ben Shapiro, Milo something (idk his last name), Dennis Prager....all in the past 4 or 5 years.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks I am looking beyond the action and motives and what should be at the heart of the issue. If you allow one, then you must allow the other. But constitutionally speaking, as case law already states, employers can limit 1st amendment speech at work, peaceful or not.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks I am a dummy with 3 college degrees and because I do not share your opinion. Got It! Great logical and convincing argument!
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks No, because the point of free speech is free speech, not free speech that I agree with only speech. You cannot protect one and not the other. Hence many of the ACLU cases with this very issue at heart.
@NFL_All_Access1 @darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks It is not. Conservative and right wing speakers are shut down on a regular basis on campuses across the country. It is a hypocrisy of the left. And this is coming from a me, a Libertarian.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Btw, I am not a dummy and never said those things are not racist. My point was free speech is free speech. The 1st amendment is applicable to every person but it is not applicable in your course of private employment.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Exactly, it is racist and despicable but still a political ideology.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks It has to do with when is free speech is conveniently applicable to the left. The 1st admendment protects free speech in public but not the workplace. Where is the left and free speech on college campuses?
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks No, it's still is a political ideology. Just because it is not a good one or popular, does not means it ceases to exist.
@BlackHaven3 @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks And btw, isn't it wrong to generalize a group of people by race and socioeconomic status? I think it is, no matter who you are talking about.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Yes, both sides are not talking about the same definitions and that is problematic. There should be no blurred lines at this point of the conversation.
@BlackHaven3 @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks And that would be their problem with no recourse. Isn't that the point of freedom in this country? That people can believe whatever they want, right or wrong? As long as they are following the law.
@NFL_All_Access1 @d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks I did. A horrible political ideology, but political ideology no the less.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Standing for national anthem has nothing to do with right or left. Pre-game is apart of the player's employment, just as practices and pre-season is.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks To make clear, I do not think kneeling is disrespectful at all. And I agree, you should not be required to show patriotism. I am saying standing does not equal patriotism, much less forced patriotism. It is a sign of respect, nothing more.
@darkchocoIate @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks You are equating standing with patriotism. This is not always the case. Look at Olympics, everyone stands even when it's not their own country's national anthem. Likewise, when political figures visit foreign countries. They are standing out of respect, not patriotism.
@d2tymes @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Employed by franchise, however they are bound by collective agreement between player's union and league.
@d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Let me throw a wrinkle in this debate, for sale of making a point and to make clear I do not agree with this action at all, what if a white player gave a Nazi salute? I would hope the NFL would have the power to stop him from making a political statement.
@TheDotP @d2tymes @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Your assumption is standing for the national anthem is a sign of patriotism, it is not. We stand for other countries national anthem (ie Olympics, Offical visits to other countries, etc.). Let's first make sure our definitions are the same before we have a civilized debate.
@d2tymes @TheDotP @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Possibly. I know Max Kellerman makes that argument, however, I would argue that kneeling is not a free speech issue, just as standing is not. NBA requires players to stand and does so under their rules.
@TheDotP @d2tymes @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks Yes, they could. As a private corporation, they can do whatever they want within the law. Almost all private business deny their workers political autonomy at work. Off hours, the owners have no right to stop them voicing or supporting political or social issues.
@d2tymes @jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks My point is, if the owners want to enact a policy in the work place, it is their right as a private industry. That does not make it hypocritical if owners participate in politics on their own time. Same with players, no one can "silence" them on their own time off the field.
@jemelehill @JoyTaylorTalks You fail to recognize one major difference. No one says players cannot support whatever social or political cause they want. The main issue is being allowed to do it in uniform "at work." Any social/political cause players do on the own time is fine, just like owners.
@LockedOnAngels Is he in danger of not making opening day roster? Rough outing.
@LockedOnAngels Re: minor league pace of play rules, I would much rather have ties during the regular season than change the dynamics of the game by adding a runner of at 2nd base. Even at MLB level, I like it better than pitcher mound visit rule.

@RogerLodge7 No! Go for a younger option!
