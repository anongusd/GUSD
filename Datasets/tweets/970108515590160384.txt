@KTHNmovie 1st Official Trailer		JOIN THE CAMPAIGN TO FINISH THE FILM HERE - 9 HOURS LEFT!!!:	https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww		https://t.co/8WQlnLyVbJ
Failure to disclose harm to patients in the aftermath of a medical mistake allowed the power morcellation procedure to go largely unnoticed outside of the specialty and unchallenged for over 20 years. 		https://t.co/E5o2vdu4FP
Kicking The Hornet's Nest would like to thank and recognize Rick Kaitz, whose grant of $5,000 put the film's fundraiser over $20,000 last night. 		Rick has made this grant in honor of Erica Kaitz, Amy Reed, Hooman Noorchashm and everyone adversely impacted by power morcellation.
3 DAYS LEFT!!!	Kicking The Hornet's Nest has 3 days left to raise funds toward its goal on Indiegogo. 		An IOM committee concluded in 2011 that the 510(K) system for regulating what the FDA calls moderate-risk devices was fundamentally flawed.		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/MPhMmR4KRA
In 2013, the Power Morcellation procedure happened to impact a family that included an anesthesiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon with the medical expertise, sense of duty, and determination needed to mount a fight against it. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsoz4Y https://t.co/NyBOgtBTcD
Kicking The Hornet's Nest has taken advantage of a deadline extension and will be able to raise funds for an additional 15 days until December 1st!!! 		A donor has also proposed a $5,000 matching grant if the film is able to raise an additional 5K. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww
For harm or wrongdoing of any kind to occur over time within a large institution it takes more than those committing the act.		It takes silent witnesses.		Learn more about and consider joining the campaign to finish the film here:		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/9ONQ06FF8J
5 DAYS TO GO!!!! 5 more days for Kicking The Hornet's Nest to raise funds on Indiegogo to finish the film. Check out the project below and consider helping it reach its goal. https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/i5jtDatpQ6
10 DAYS TO GO on the Indiegogo Campaign for Kicking The Hornet's Nest!!! Let's keep getting the word out and get this film as close to its goal as possible.	Join the campaign to finish the film here: https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww	Check out the new teaser below	https://t.co/AYqrCclevD
Who knew what when? How much did they know? And what action was or was not taken in light of new information? These were the central questions of the Power Morcellator Controversy.		Consider joining the campaign to finish the film here:	https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/CmOCPQZr93

The Power Morcellation controversy in gynecology was a stalemate between a specialty firmly adapted to a certain surgical technique and an opposition adamant that they were committing a fundamental error.

Does being personally affected by something corrupt your ability to view it through an objective lens, or does that experience make crystal clear what was previously impossible to see? 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/nvRZRG2W30
Unintended harm is an unfortunate inevitability in medicine, but procedures exist specifically in order to evaluate practices and limit that harm in the future. When those procedures aren't followed or are willingly ignored, patients pay the price. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/1ZwVqbJl8m
Coverage from publications like The Cancer Letter helped amplify patient reports and bring attention to the Power Morcellation Controversy. 		Kicking The Hornet's Nest is an upcoming documentary on this issue. Join the campaign to finish the film here: 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/5MuXdMrp0a
What do you do when you can't know for sure if you are about to walk into a minefield?		Kicking The Hornet’s Nest is an upcoming documentary that tells the story of Sarah Robinson of Los Altos, CA and many other women who encountered Power Morcellation. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/ox1i6iucxS
In 2006, a PA pathologist alerted device manufacturers to a significant health risk associated w/ the Power Morcellator. 7 years passed before patient-advocates generated another warning too unrelenting to be ignored. https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/Ljzw04ox65
The limitations of the informed consent process for women undergoing hysterectomies became abundantly clear. Kicking The Hornet’s Nest is a documentary that tells the story of Erica Kaitz of Boston, MA and other women who encountered Power Morcellation. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/Hw5GaF2XJN
Kicking The Hornet's Nest is a documentary exploring how the Power Morcellator crept into gynecology, aided by a weak regulatory system and unchecked enthusiasm for innovation. Learn more about and consider supporting the campaign to finish the film here: https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/mrOrbUVmT9
Nancy Curtis underwent a minimally-invasive hysterectomy procedure because she was presented with this one option, sold on all of its benefits, and given no reason to think twice. @KTHNmovie will tell her story and many others. Check out the film here. 		https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/r2Nwr8lpue
After she was diagnosed with an aggressive uterine cancer that had been spread by a popular gynecological device, Amy Reed saw a public health hazard, and thousands of unsuspecting women at risk.	https://t.co/WxBjpsG9Ww https://t.co/avjbTpfXjK
Kicking The Hornet's Nest will bring the stories of victims to the forefront and engage in an in-depth exploration of how and why the incredibly controversial Power Morcellation technique in Gynecology, could have become the standard that it did. https://t.co/blrI03yQDK https://t.co/ndkkM3T5B9

"It feels like I am waiting for the bomb to go off," Noye says.	Even for women in remission, once this cancer is spread, they may live the rest of their life with the fear of recurrence.		https://t.co/I9ztQzvWUB
This, of course, has been the debate all along in terms of strategy. Do you stop using the device until you further prove exactly how dangerous it is, or do you stop using the device until you know it's not dangerous at all?		https://t.co/pNmSgHxNOH

Another case of the shortcomings of half-measures like the FDA's Black Box Warning on Power Morcellation. Unless you ban the procedure, you leave the use of the device up to the discretion of the doctors. And then this happens: 		https://t.co/JeDmxBOJH8
Pointing out that there is a problem is certainly a positive step but is essentially meaningless if it isn't followed by significant reform. 		https://t.co/a8JwNpVUD5
Cancer prevalence remains unchanged in the remaining morcellations being performed. The constant theme here has been no matter how sure you think you are, you just don't know. 		https://t.co/NLlwNuadzU
