It's been an honor to serve. And to all those fighting for a better future, I’ll see you on the other side. Thanks. —@joshearnest
You are thorough, critical, and most importantly, you persevere. It’s made me a better Press Secretary, and a better public servant.
To the press corps, thanks for what you do. Your passion and dedication to your work is critical to the success of American democracy.
So it’s been a unique privilege and incredible honor to stand at the podium 345 times and represent a man I knew would change the world.
When you're @POTUS and known as one the most thoughtful and eloquent speakers of all time, it must be hard to watch someone speak for you.

Anything less is a shameful failure to fulfill our foremost priority: To protect and defend the American people.
Each year, more than 30,000 Americans are killed by guns. It's time for Congress to join @POTUS in taking a stand. https://t.co/wZIw0mqkyb
But it appears that too many in Congress are more interested in listening to the NRA rather than the American people.
A majority of Americans, including most gun owners, agree that strengthening background checks is a commonsense step.
For example, Senate Rs rejected a simple measure that would prevent people with suspected links to terror from buying guns. It defies logic.
Said this in today's briefing but it bears repeating: The Senate's failure on gun violence last night is a textbook definition of cowardice.

Whether you look at our history or our constitution, what should happen next is clear: @POTUS chooses &amp; Senators consider a #SCOTUS nominee.
And 5 presidents have filled spots on the court after their successors had been elected. https://t.co/sPOniURWT2
In fact, one-third of the presidents before @POTUS have confirmed a #SCOTUS nominee in an election year. https://t.co/r1YYRbA2kb
Which is disappointing given that both Senators McConnell &amp; Grassley voted to confirm Justice Kennedy to #SCOTUS in 1988, an election year.
Leader McConnell said Senate Republicans won't change their minds and won’t fulfill their constitutional duty to consider a #SCOTUS nominee.
.@POTUS asked everyone in the room to offer recommendations on a nominee, he'd take their suggestions seriously.
As with his previous two #SCOTUS nominees, @POTUS consulted with Democrats &amp; Republicans in Congress before nominating a candidate.
President Obama met with Senators McConnell, Reid, Grassley, and Leahy today at the White House. Here's a readout.
There is nothing in the Constitution about neglecting #SCOTUS responsibilities because it is an election year https://t.co/tcbVPw9TNF

The Speaker was less circumspect in 1996, when he said: "I'll commit suicide before I vote on a clean minimum-wage bill."
The Speaker opposes raising the min wage to $10.10. In '07, he voted no to $7.25. And in 1996, he voted no to $5.15. I see a trend here.
For those who don't know, @SpeakerBoehner also voted NO to raising the minimum wage when it was $5.15 an hour, in 2007.
The Cantor min wage mystery makes me wonder: Hey @BrendanBuck, does Speaker Boehner believe there should be a minimum wage?
.@rorycooper I seem to have stumbled across a mystery. Does Rep. Cantor (aka @GOPLeader) believe there should be a minimum wage, or not?
.@rorycooper I get he wants to repeal ACA. Thanks for sharing. But why refuse to say what his position is on the minimum wage?
.@rorycooper It's a simple question: What does the Majority Leader believe the minimum wage should be? If he wants to abolish it, say so.
.@rorycooper What does Rep. Cantor think the min wage should be? $5.15, as in 2007 when he voted NO to raising it? Lower? Zero?

.@BretBaier: You miss the point: he's not blaming. He's asking Congress to avoid sequester w/balanced buy-down, so process can move fwd.
Speaker Boehner recently boasted to WSJ that he has GOP support to use sequester for political leverage: "I've got that in my back pocket."
Remember #speakerboehner's view of sequester on 8/1/11: "I Got 98 Percent Of What I Wanted. I'm Pretty Happy.” http://t.co/6VoyehJJ … ….
Reminder: 174 House Republicans - including Boehner, Cantor, McCarthy and Ryan - vote YES to sequester. #GOPamnesia
Amash: "You can't vote for something and, with a straight face, go blame the other guy for its existence in law." http://t.co/1fKEIqm5
Amash: "The debt ceiling deal in 2011 was agreed to by Rs &amp; Ds, and regardless of who came up with the sequester, they all voted for it."
GOP Rep. Amash says "it's a mistake on the part of Republicans to try to pin the sequester on Obama. It's totally disingenuous."
GOP congressman ridicules "disingenuous" GOP effort to blame POTUS for a sequester the House GOP supported: http://t.co/1fKEIqm5.

"Effective, balanced approach" -@TheIACP Police Chiefs on Obama's plan to reduce gun violence: http://t.co/eVb8jli7 #NowIsTheTime
RT @JWGOP: Nothing the President has proposed would take ANY gun from ANY law abiding citizen.
POTUS: "[W]hen it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now, for Grace" and the 25 other innocent Newtown victims.
POTUS: "every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace, &amp; I think about the life that she lived &amp; the life that lay ahead of her."
POTUS has a painting by Newtown victim Grace McDonnell, age 7, hanging in his private study, given to him by Grace's father.
POTUS: "..and [to] high school students at Columbine and elementary school students in Newtown; and kids on street corners in Chicago..."
POTUS: "That most fundamental set of rights-to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness...were denied to college students at Virginia Tech"
POTUS: "The right to assemble peacefully; that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Oregon, and moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado."
POTUS: "We have the right to worship freely and safely; that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin."
POTUS: "Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same."
POTUS: "I will put everything I’ve got into this, and so will Joe, but...the only way we can change is if the American people demand it."
POTUS: "we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale."
POTUS: "[L]et me be absolutely clear: Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms."
POTUS: At a time of budget cuts that are shrinking police forces, "we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets."
RT @whitehouse: #NowIsTheTime to protect our children &amp; our communities by reducing gun violence. Read the President's plan: http:// ...
POTUS: "A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan..."
POTUS: "Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater."
POTUS: "Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10 round limit for magazines."
POTUS: "[I]t’s time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun."
In addition to 23 executive actions POTUS announced today, Congress must act to reduce gun violence.
POTUS today: "[W]hile reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge, protecting our children from harm shouldn’t be a divisive one."

Great news re POTUS 41: http://t.co/GC4DyrtH. From 44 down, we all are relieved he's out of the hospital and wish him &amp; his family well.
POTUS: "[I]f there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step."
POTUS: "[W]e’ve got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again....[T]hat is no way for us to do business."
POTUS at presser cont: "[I]f we’re going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way."
POTUS: "[T]he issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation."
POTUS: "Let’s give our businesses and the world the certainty that our economy and our reputation are still second to none."
POTUS: "The financial wellbeing of the American people is not leverage to be used." Threatening U.S. default "is not a bargaining chip."
POTUS: "But [Republicans] will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy."
POTUS: R's "can act responsibly, and pay America’s bills, or they can act irresponsibly &amp; put America through another economic crisis."
POTUS: "[T]o even entertain the idea of this happening, of the United States of America not paying its bills, is irresponsible."
POTUS: "If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks &amp; veterans benefits will be delayed."
POTUS: "America cannot afford another debate with this Congress about whether or not they should pay the bills they’ve already racked up."
President Obama will mark the final week of his first term with an East Room press conference today at 11:15 am EST.
