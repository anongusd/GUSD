@RonaldChump5 @DearAuntCrabby That presumes the goal is to remove the President from office- but our justice system should be blind to politics.

@lsiewnelle @DearAuntCrabby Criminal indictment and impeachment are processes which should be entirely independent of one another.  President Grant was arrested for speeding, chose to acknowledge his guilt, and never faced impeachment. https://t.co/7EAYU3pglA
@thetujungan @DearAuntCrabby I disagree- why wait for the politicians if the evidence is solid?  And not all crimes merit impeachment anyway- President Grant was arrested and acknowledged his culpability, but he was never impeached.  https://t.co/7EAYU3pglA

@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN I'm not sure that I'm trusting in the goodness of people here- in fact I'm assuming that most will do the "right" thing only if it costs them less to do so. Government legislation best achieves higher, long-term goals only by ensuring that doing the "wrong" thing costs more.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN HCFC's are scheduled to be entirely eliminated by 2030: https://t.co/3C55lJZi5B HCFC's provided an intermediate stepping-stone to wean us off the CFCs- and if no one can profit from these important changes, then they simply won't happen. Capitalism responds where it sees profit.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN Yes- I have FAR more faith in the science than I do in the governmental response to the various pressures on it. The trick is to devise systems to guide those who consider their self-interest paramount (most of us) to do the "right" thing anyway within the rules of our system.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN And if in parallel governments also provide a "carrot" to entice corporate entities to develop and market technologies that will reduce such damaging emissions, then that sounds like good governance to me- but it may look corrupt if one assumes that global warming is a hoax.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN Banning the release of other greenhouse gasses is harder to legislate because currently the entire globe subsidizes the environmental cost of such emissions. We need to impose those costs proportionately on the entities responsible instead, to motivate positive change.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN I'm convinced CFCs were a legitimate threat, and had there been no alternative there would have been tremendous resistance to the ban- I don't begrudge the capitalist profits made by the companies that stepped in to fill the void.  If I didn't believe the science, I'd be annoyed.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN CFC-ban as a government-enforced subsidy of DuPont's less-dangerous-to-the-ozone-layer HCFCs, paid for by those using affected products? Perhaps our gov't was only able to pull it off because it helped powerful DuPont, but government-regulated capitalism did achieve the goal.

The government did not ban air conditioning- they restricted a dangerous means of creating it, and manufacturers and maintenance teams responded efficiently to the shift in demand.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN But having a big government program to subsidize the switch would have placed some of the cost on those who were not part of the problem- and failure to address it would have imposed hazardous conditions and elevated cancer rates on populations that had not caused the problem.
@mbrigg3 @Biker4America @GDirlam @Conspiracyin559 @bdobyj @Ashgobert1 @BleachedRatTail @KillaColls @Amjie @jakedgoode @BakerSullivan @IlhanMN Good point. Perhaps the case could've been made for a slower roll-out. But it appears that any excess costs were borne only by those who were causing the problem.

@J9sling @johnpavlovitz But this makes the adulation of many Trump followers all the more perplexing- it seems rooted more in hate for HRC and Liberals than it does in any admiration for Trump. And those once conned by Trump are determined never to believe what the facts reveal with increasing clarity.
@J9sling @johnpavlovitz I have a warm spot in my heart for Jimmy Carter. When a leader at the highest level also gives every appearance of actually being a good and decent human being, as did Obama, I think we do tend to feel a greater bond with them.  And Obama naturally inspired many Black Americans.
@J9sling @johnpavlovitz I think you are quite right to mention the cult-like following that Americans have routinely awarded MANY celebrities- the problem may lay in this tendency rather than in any one object of that immature, unrealistic admiration.  We honor material "success" over character.  üòî
@J9sling @johnpavlovitz Media Balkanization has definitely increased the severity of confirmation bias and political tribalism- no doubt. A real effort is now required to expose oneself to high-quality arguments with which one disagrees. But I do not see any equivalency in support for Obama vs Trump.
@J9sling @johnpavlovitz I have loved ones who voted for Trump but are not part of #Cult45. In them, I noticed a reverse-cult phenomenon that hasn't yet been addressed (beyond "misogyny"). They had inexplicably bought into much of the anti-HRC propaganda, and so never researched Trump's background.

@wobbly_tiger @dreamspace2 @RaleighReporter To clarify my earlier tweet, "I thought this had substantially ended before WWII," I was referring to mocking minstrel shows and blackface- to the shameless and very public unabashed celebrations of racism.

@ChristopherNeth @chrishickman81 @KyleDLarson @GLUON420 @markwest1963 @ScottMStedman @Fraude_1 It does seem clear that Trump is motivated to undermine the credibility of each of our law enforcement agencies, including ICE, but I doubt he wants to abolish it- surely he merely wants to control it for his own purposes.  No?

@chrishickman81 @ChristopherNeth @KyleDLarson @GLUON420 @markwest1963 @ScottMStedman @Fraude_1 I tend to agree, though I am trying to keep an open mind.  There is an awful lot of mud-slinging and relatively little clarity whenever many otherwise credible people begin to attack others.
@RbrRobyn @riotwomennn @ApprenticeNBC @CaslerNoel Yes, absolutely. NDAs are often part of settlement agreements reached between two parties.  Such an agreement would not prevent law enforcement from issuing a subpoena in case of criminal activity, but first, the LEOs have to realize that one needs to be issued.
@chrishickman81 @ChristopherNeth @KyleDLarson @GLUON420 @markwest1963 @ScottMStedman @Fraude_1 Oh, got it- thank you.  I misunderstood and thought you were referring to K. Louise Neufeld- hence my confusion.  I'm probably mixing threads again- trying to follow too many at once.

If Scott attacks someone with credibility, then why not help us- and him- to see his error? This feels like unnecessary obfuscation.
@chrishickman81 @ChristopherNeth @KyleDLarson @GLUON420 @markwest1963 @ScottMStedman @Fraude_1 Christopher, the point you raised seems to have touched a nerve.  Is there really such a video, and if so would you mind providing a link? And perhaps explain you think this compromises Louise's credibility somehow?

Do we really require bona fides to ask questions?  This is the sort of response that makes it harder to get to the bottom of things.
@dfarroll @doug_ramsdell @sarahkendzior I don't mean to suggest this problem is a simple one to solve- but surely we could craft a law that would discourage people like Trump from entering politics without endangering those with more legitimate NDAs? Up-front enforced disclosure would have been more kind to Trump, too.
@JFaxFan41 @sucommstark @DaleGrungus If we scoff at those who have yet to learn something important, and subject them to ridicule, it has been my experience that a significant number of such people will reflexively defend against the ego-dystonia of admission of ignorance in such a way that they shut out new info.

@JFaxFan41 @sucommstark @DaleGrungus Those of us who benefit from White privilege may recognize the horrors of the past and give earnest lip-service to criticizing current incarnations, but even then we just don't see it going on around us if we aren't awake to it. Fresh details of current events are always bracing.
@JawadPullin @DaleGrungus I take your point that American Blacks are used to it, but damn, they shouldn't have to be.  I hope such trigger warnings become the norm someday when antiblack racism is discussed- it is a simple matter of consideration and respect.

@dePlantagenet @juanrive @SRuhle We incentivize or discourage certain uses of private money through regulation- we offer tax write-offs for donations to qualifying non-profits, but place additional tax burdens on certain products- tobacco, gasoline.

@danzu72 @SRuhle For-profit companies are always going to operate like... for-profit companies.  They have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make more money- that is why these needs can only be addressed through government regulations and by non-profit organizations.
@BobKlemola @SRuhle Oh, God- yes!

@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality I'll reread this thread tomorrow.  Have a good night!
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality That is an excellent point. But it does leave me wondering if transphobia is somehow intrinsic to feminism, or merely a contaminant- unfortunately I am falling asleep and am unable to give this subject the focus it deserves right now. Thank you for patiently walking me thru this.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality No offense intended- I don't typically use the word at all, though it did seem wrong to write "transwomen".  Sorry about that.  In some contexts, though, I might have stuck a hyphen into "straight-women" as compared to "gay-women"- I suppose when I'm focusing on the distinction.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Re-reading your tweet- again- perhaps you meant the didactic approach of actually formally setting forth a definition of "female" is the limited circumstance when one must take care to be trans-inclusive- I can see that. https://t.co/rRGERioiuI
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Well, I guess I am saying that, if I am aware that a woman is trans, I just would feel those details are not my business, and call her a woman or female.  But if I understand correctly, today I am hearing that saying "all women are welcome" might make a trans woman feel excluded.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality I'm still of the opinion that "real" feminism is not transphobic, but that some people may co-opt "feminism" to weaponize it while simultaneously diminishing it.  I'd like to think this is the exception- no?
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality I don't typically describe anyone as "trans" apart from very specific conversations like this one, but I guess what I am hearing from you is that I may be excluding trans-women without realizing it.  That is what is startling me- I thought I was enlightened, but perhaps not.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality I'd like to understand better. I've always just said "women" or "female" without focusing on anyone's private medical history, and no one has seemed to be offended- not that they've told me, anyway.  üò≥  But this incident has suddenly left me feeling I'm missing something, yes..
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality I can see that assumption may be pragmatic, but in another sense I'm not so sure that is the "safest" assumption in the emotional sense.  Why let your feelings be hurt where no offense was intended?  Even if the offender is oblivious and needs correction- intentionality matters.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality "Feminism has been rife with transphobia since the 1970s." I was not aware of that- I mean, our entire culture has been transphobic, yes- but I'd never thought of feminism as transphobic.  üòï
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Yes- that's why I would feel wrong to say that- I would just have said "women" before now.  But you'd described "not explicitly doing so in a trans inclusive way" as excluding trans women- if I'm understanding correctly- so this suddenly seems unexpectedly fraught.
@WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Not to compare the magnitude of the targeting- but it feels like that group is targeting two groups at once- trans-women and feminists overall.  And the messaging is so subtle that they can paint us all as unreasonable for complaining.  Damn.
@WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Wow- how awful. I am so sorry you and others are being targeted that way.  And even as an ordinary woman, this feels oppressive- they are co-opting feminism to use it as a tool for hate, and trying to divide those of us who should be natural allies from each other. üò¢
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Until I saw this, I would have felt wrong to say "females and transwomen" or similar, because it feels like I'd be emphasizing a distinction to separate us into two different groups. But you're suggesting that my instinctive assumption of inclusivity leaves out trans-women?
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Except that most people who are trans-supportive like me won't realize that an expression of support for female humans might be interpreted to mean "only those with two X chromosomes".  People will feel hurt where no slight is intended.  This is harsh.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality "Many expressions of feminism are motivated by transphobia"- this makes me profoundly sad- and angry.  How have we let hateful people redefine feminism so many times?  It just keeps getting worse and worse.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Oh, OK.  I'll google the billboard.  That is awful.  But I'd hate to cause offense by innocently making some poster or banner that I merely intend to celebrate women/females.  It feels like the transphobic group is both expressing hate AND co-opting legimate feminism. üò≥ Toxic.
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality Is there something else written on the other side of the t-shirts?
@jxc @WhatKatieDidNe1 @Wales4Equality OK- I understand that transphobic people hold that opinion, but how do we know that transphobic people were responsible for these t-shirts?  The next time I see something that looks to me like an expression of feminism, how will I know if it's actually motivated by transphobia??

@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner Yes- most people won't have a problem- but I do know some who would.  One troubled friend seems to have his wallet stolen annually, if not more often- and his finances always make his ID hard to replace.
@cobrakaideville @leahmcelrath I agree- Leah probably should have watched this more carefully before she criticized Brokaw.  üò≥
@Hoosier_Mama60 @tenej_jenet @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner Jenet's snarkiness hadn't sat well with me, but I would not have made it my business had I been aware of the reason she had chosen to respond that way.  I'm not a fan of anyone who claims to "instablock".  I'd rather look for common ground with those of different views.
@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner It is voter ID at the polling place that has the greatest potential for suppressing the vote of the disadvantaged- hence the concern many liberals have for requiring ID at the polls.  Calls for it often seem to have questionable motivation.  But most agree we need it to register.
@adijnas @leahmcelrath I guess I'll have to listen to this again, but I heard him express clearly his view that the racists were in the wrong.  Are you questioning whether such people exist?  Sadly, they do, but they are the ones who should be marginalized- not our newest group of Americans.
@williams_tanana @MNBonnie @leahmcelrath I thought I heard him suggest this was a mutual, or joint responsibility- that whites can learn from hispanics too- sort of like "can't we all get along".  I suppose nowadays some would be offended by Rodney King's entreaties- as if he were blaming the victims. (sigh)
@MNBonnie @leahmcelrath I agree with you, Bonnie.  He was quoting racists, not BEING one.
@JaneSepmeier @FuriosaSK @BrentHBaker @tombrokaw I don't think he meant that ALL older whites are racist, either- if that is what you find offensive.  This pile-on is puzzling.
@JaneSepmeier @FuriosaSK @BrentHBaker @tombrokaw Wow, I'm really not understanding the harsh reaction here. If I say "Nazis said Jews are x", am I racist for repeating that appalling fact? Brokaw clearly is not suggesting those racists should be cut any slack- he even points out that whites are responsible for assimilation too.
@FuriosaSK @BrentHBaker @tombrokaw He isn't.  Did you listen to the clip?  He was quoting examples of appalling racism- no espousing those views!  And his assimilation comment was clearly meant for both sides of the cultural divide.
@dovergirl95 @BrentHBaker @tombrokaw I think folks are overlooking that he was quoting appalling racist comments- not espousing them.
@adijnas @leahmcelrath He was quoting racists, not expressing support for them- that's how I understood it.
@leahmcelrath Push back against whom?  Brokaw was telling us how appallingly bad the racism is.  What possible reason could you give for arguing with his observations?  The racists being described were not present.

@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Hmm.  This was in the Senate, oddly, but when I responded to you I assumed you were complaining that the House (where Dems are in the majority) had somehow blocked an effort to pay the Coast Guard.  I will have to look this up again.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC The point I had intended to make was simply that publically-available information strongly suggests that this particular investigation will turn up little-to-nothing.  I was not arguing that the investigation should not be done- merely predicting that nothing will come of it.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Now, if our systems worked perfectly, no investigation would be needed because we could assume all registrations were completed by the relevant authorities in compliance with federal law. I agree such assumptions are not acceptable- double-checking is appropriate.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC And I do support auditing the voting records without any evidence of wrongdoing. Our vote is too important not to monitor carefully for problems whichever group would be advantaged. The evidence is that people who once presented green cards as ID are now voting- right?
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Perhaps you are assuming there is far more evidence of illegal voting than the article suggests. If so, obviously my back-of-the-envelope calculations cannot address that unknown evidence- I am merely responding to the facts as stated in the article.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I will agree that the number of illegal votes cast in this entire country should definitely be zero, but I hope you likewise agree that that the number of eligible voters who are illegally disenfranchised despite their best efforts to vote should also be zero.  Seem reasonable?
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC It seems to me that the very most frustrating discussions, if handled politely, do in fact offer the greatest potential "payoff"; that is, if two people who think quite differently can come to agree on an issue, that is a real goal worth working toward. I regret screwing that up.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I get it now, and I do apologize for having written THAT to you.  I had started too many threads the other day, and mistakenly thought I was doing that to someone else who had already been similarly obnoxious- not that I should have done it at all, mind you. I am sorry.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I am embarrassed- I thought I wrote that on an entirely different thread, in response to someone who had already behaved badly. I would now regret having done that to them- and am now mortified to see that I did it to *you* in a far more polite thread. Please accept my apologies.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Approaching this from another angle- even if 100% of those 95,000 in question were legally registered, I'm not suggesting that would "prove" no illegal voting goes on anywhere. Investigate anything with merit. But this, so readily explained, seems politically-motivated to me.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I am not suggesting the investigation should not be done.  They must follow through and prosecute anyone who has registered illegally- of course. My point is simply that the naturalization rates in Texas *easily* explain the startling numbers reported- this could be 100% legal.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Your reaction puzzles me- we were not even talking about "illegals" voting- just illegal voting, right?  This "investigation" asks why so many who at one time obtained their driver's license (as legal noncitizens with green cards) are later registered to vote, and are voting.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I would like to understand why we are not seeing eye-to-eye on this.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I do lose patience sometimes, and for that I apologize.  But in this specific instance we really DO have enough information to make a rough assessment of the likelihood that this investigation will yield anything.  Again, I support prosecuting ALL illegally registering or voting.
@tenej_jenet @Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner Isn't it more productive to persuade them or offer them relevant facts- if they seem sincere- than to block them?
@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner If we began to have a problem with people stealing others' vote at the polls, then the question of requiring ID at the polls would likely require a revisit- but there haven't been significant problems in that regard.  (Absentee voter ballots seem to be at greater risk, granted.)
@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner It is worth noting that, when voting drives are held outside government offices, those newly-registered voters are already required by federal law to present sufficient identification during their first visit to the polls. No one is permitted to register on their signature alone.
@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner Dems fully support requiring voters to prove eligibility before they may register to vote. The controversy arises when the Reps want to require some specific state-supplied ID at the polls, because historically, strict ID rules at polls have been used to disenfranchise the poor.
@Hoosier_Mama60 @Rogerasalways @StuartSpooner A solid majority of both Dems and Reps supported the passage of HAVA in 2002, which among other things, imposed specific federal requirements on the identification and documentation required for anyone to register to vote.  https://t.co/IHsBgqUjPT

Even if TX driver's licenses expire as frequently as every two years, that 95,000 number looks entirely reasonable.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC It is unclear why you've posted this as some sort of evidence of anything.  Yes, the investigation is news, but you seem to be jumping to conclusions and pyramiding those on accusations without any basis. That was a nice, nuanced factual article.  Read it more closely, maybe?
@CanterburyTells @BJDeFelice @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC But now that the government is finally open, you do make an EXCELLENT point, Canterbury!  Enjoy the day, y'all!
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC My best guess is @BJDeFelice is referring to the January 17 vote against the "motion to recommit" on H.J.Res. 28. Dems voted against that, as they wanted to keep the joint resolution identical to what had passed in the previous session of the Senate. They DID vote FOR the bill.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC THAT was the original stubborn refusal to negotiate- "include the wall with routine budgeting because I want it." It didn't belong there, and yet he tried to pretend it did just so he could pretend the Dems were the ones being stubborn. Trump had offered no wall PLANS to approve.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Trump had successfully convinced his supporters that the discussion of wall funding belonged in the 2019 appropriations bills, when in fact he had not even included the wall in his budget request, and the wall was obviously not a matter of routine authorization renewal.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC When did they do that?
@Mel_Ankoly @williamlegate (More like voting for a Republican over an Autocrat with Fascist leanings, but that's probably understood.)
@Mel_Ankoly @williamlegate Exactly- though it could help in both directions, of course.  The results, such as they are, would more accurately reflect what the voters want, as it removes our tendency to second-guess that a given third-party candidate "has no chance".
@NHRunningLady @TrumpsareNazis @williamlegate Me too.  It's incredibly annoying.  We need to work toward consensus, but that behavior only accentuates divisions.
@Kacheling @williamlegate Seriously? Frankly, and I am not being peevish here, that is honestly how I see stalwart party adherents. You're just going to go along with every single plank in their platform just because you agree with most of them- or worse, merely more of them than the "other" party?  Weak.
@Mel_Ankoly @williamlegate FWIW, I feel strongly that we need instant runoff voting- or ranked-choice voting.  I resent the power that the main political parties have under the current version of our system, and would prefer to see more than just two main parties in power.  https://t.co/WVSS62aza2

@TigerJaw @prozacbitch101 @friends278 @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No one is claiming the existing walls are useless- but that they require maintenance- the point is that the walls built a decade or more ago have already helped and shifted the balance such that now improved technology at our ports of entry will be our most effective approach.
@TigerJaw @prozacbitch101 @friends278 @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi The point was that the problem is far more complex than Trump's moronic wall mantra suggests.  They need more staff and more technology at the ports of entry- that should be the priority- not the remnants of Trump's campaign slogan.
@gramanissa @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi "Cozy", eh? Trump tried to persuade Nieto to go along with the lie he planned to tell the American people- that Mexico was paying for the wall.  And as corrupt as Mexican politics is, even Nieto refused to go along with that- I'm not sure which President would be the dictator.
@gramanissa @JRubinBlogger Do you realize that there is nothing in the Constitution granting emergency powers to the President?

@MelodyJeanBrook @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi I would agree with you, if I could find proof that illegal immigrants are actually taking a lot of money out of our system.  As it is, I can see that they more often pay into our system but will never be able to draw from it- they are subsidizing our Social Security system.
@legereit @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi While that number sounds extreme, apparently legal immigrants might do this too, as it is legal to claim dependents living in Canada or Mexico.  I didn't know that- interesting. https://t.co/DRa3oDvrBn
@legereit @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi Regarding the large number of dependents- (20?!)- that certainly sounds unusual, but many Mexicans are Catholic, and one person might in fact be the sole provider for deceased siblings' children too- such desperate situations could explain why they came to the US to earn money.
@legereit @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi As voters and taxpayers, we could certainly decide we don't want to reduce someone's taxes if their dependents live in another country- but we would have to change the current law.  Right now that is perfectly legal.  Hmm.
@legereit @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi Interesting- I just learned that it is perfectly legal for someone working and paying taxes in the US to claim a dependent who lives in Canada or Mexico. The taxpayer's legal or undocumented status is a separate issue- a large refund may in fact be due.  https://t.co/DRa3oDvrBn
@LionTedPride @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi You are thinking of those who are currently working without pay because they are considered "essential" for shutdown purposes.

@AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi That is what I need to learn more about, then.  All the information I've been able to find tells me that this is false, yet you seem very certain that it is true- that is why I'm asking you if you can provide evidence or a link to reliable documentation.  I've looked for it.
@MelodyJeanBrook @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi It sounds like you are blaming the victims here.  Sure, they "should" have money in the bank for a rainy day- but they also "should" be paid for their work as agreed.  Many are fine, but many others are not.  And hundreds of thousands of contractors will never be paid.
@mel4449 @AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi Many of Trump's supporters have been duped into being impressed that he is "not taking a salary" when that just is NOT where he is making his money.  Don't fall for the sleight of hand. Trump is raking in real money by violating the emoluments clause.  His salary is only $400K!
@LionTedPride Not what I meant- of course postponing the SOTU does not reduce Trump's ability to get his message out- in myriad ways.  I meant that he values the pomp and ceremony of the official SOTU for its gravitas, and tying it together with reopening the government will motivate him.

@Chuck9828 @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi But if you are claiming that Dems are HELPING illegals, then it sounds like you may be conflating asylum seekers with economic migrants. It may be hard to tell the difference, but our courts have well-established procedures for doing their best.  Do you object to asylum seekers?
@Chuck9828 @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi We would not have illegals if we actually prosecuted the companies and people that hire them.  I agree we need to do far more to address illegal behavior, but our focus has always been backwards- we are less effective when we focus on those with the least power.
@TigerJaw @prozacbitch101 @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi That is the point- we have enough wall now, so that the majority of illegals are not coming in that way anymore.  The majority in the last decade or more have been visa overstays.  We need to focus our efforts where it will have the biggest payoff.
@TigerJaw @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi Cute.  Just in case you haven't seen any of the budget appropriations bills passed by the House this year- there are 18 on this page:  https://t.co/Ok1ttadhCa
@QYarzab @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi This non-governmental website provides useful information on the budgeting process, though the bills themselves are organized differently:  https://t.co/Sa9Ju38SE8
@QYarzab @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi I think McConnell should let the Senate vote on any bill that meets the usual requirements for such votes.  Instead, he refuses to risk a veto- but that should not be his concern.  Let Senators vote for or against bills as they see fit.  McConnell is protecting Trump.
@QYarzab @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi (It also included 2 bills passed only in the Senate and 1 bill that has become law- but I'm not sufficiently expert on this website to produce a "clean" list.  But that is where the real info can be found.)
@QYarzab @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Well, this list includes 18 bills which the House has passed since January 3 that included the term "appropriations" in the title.  I'm not sure which are being reported as "the ten" but they've got to be among these.  https://t.co/Ok1ttadhCa
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC To secure our borders we need to put our money where it will create the most bang for our buck. If illegal immigration is our priority, we need a more effective means of monitoring overstays. If drug interdiction is the priority, we need better equipment at our ports of entry.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Sorry- that's annoying.  The poster must have removed it.  (sigh)
@TigerJaw @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi Your tweet makes clear that you do not understand the meaning of the word "negotiation"- much less judge when one is fair.
@AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi If you support Trump, you clearly do not recognize "fake".  The Senate GOP needs to remove McConnell from his position so that both sides of Congress will assert their power as needed to reopen the government and protect the American people from this traitor.
@AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi No, illegal immigrants cannot claim benefits. The "news" articles claiming otherwise are looking at households- if a child born here receives school meals, then even one household member who is a newly-arrived immigrant not qualified to receive welfare winds up being "counted".
@QYarzab @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi No, she has passed ten different bills, the earliest of which was identical to the one that was passed in last year's Senate, and subsequent bills to open each part.  McConnell is such a wuss he is afraid to pass something that Trump might veto, so he doesn't even dare try- weak.
@american_kuya @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Trump supporters do not read.  That contained the poison pill of the wall.  It is not happening until after the government has reopened.
@Chuck9828 @kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi No, you clearly are getting your "news" from Fox.  Do your own research and think for yourself.  Ignore the easy propaganda.  Trump is a traitor- of course patriots like Pelosi are standing up to him.
@kattraveling1 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS That had the "poison pill" of the wall.  It is not happening.  Pelosi has made that clear.  This is not Trump's decision to make.

@January_Frosts @Reporter160 @Art_Donovan @RealJamesWoods @POTUS No, Trump turned down that deal- it's off the table.  Now with the blue wave Pelosi has a mandate to fight the idiocy of this con-man.  Trump will never be offered such a favorable deal again, nor should he be.

@AmyPerk2233 @easyrider_69 @RepLeeZeldin @raaamises @SpeakerPelosi Withholding Trump's audience is the single best way to persuade him to reopen the goverment.  Trump does not care about the people who are suffering- he only cares about his audience.  Pelosi knows what motivates Trump.

@TigerJaw @prozacbitch101 @sheLLbeLL_xo @RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz @SpeakerPelosi OK- what bill do you propose?  And why hasn't Trump proposed a way to stop the majority of newly-arrived illegal aliens as you just did?  Your point is reasonable- notice that, sadly, Trump hasn't thought to make it.

@J9sling @SaysHummingbird Wow- LOL!  Amazing.
@J9sling @SaysHummingbird I see what you mean, but I can also understand why repressed minorities are elated finally to have an effective tool to combat racism and defend themselves against racists.  Surely the cure is far less noxious than the disease it addresses?!
@J9sling @SaysHummingbird Any substantially "edited videos" would definitely be a MAJOR concern- are you aware of any that were edited the way the one of Jim Acosta in the WH was? I'm not, so I'm genuinely asking.  But with authentic videos of real events in a public place- is their age your concern? No?
@OceanBreeze1977 @Goochtales @WalshFreedom Correct.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Just read the whole thread of responses to Crenshaw's tweet, and you can follow up on the links people provide to understand whether or not the guy is being straight with his readers- he wasn't.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Alright- I looked into Crenshaw's claim.  Dude, these are politicians, you've GOT to check the facts before you believe their statements.  That version had a little poison pill in it known as the WALL.  The House passed it today without that poison pill. https://t.co/xuWcBClWkO
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC You are viewing this as a zero-sum game. An illegal may kill someone, but if they do so at lower rates, then the presence of illegals at another time and place may also save someone else, and you won't hear about that.  Net is a lower murder rate if they are less likely to kill.
@appieclappie @correnacorrena1 @Nataliew1020 Yes, but while I cannot relate to religious fundamentalists, I do believe they can be good and decent people who treat others well.  In general, I think it is those among them who lack empathy who are most likely to behave badly.

@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC What did MSM miss here? Any threats against these asshole kids must be prosecuted, certainly, but MSM is falling all over itself to "correct" what looks to have been an accurate take from the beginning. Tamir Rice's life was destroyed- these spoiled brats will benefit.
@alexabme @_waleedshahid They definitely share the blame for this. SOMEONE is responsible for this behavior- if not the teens, then the chaperones- there should be no free pass. To the extent that the kids didn't need intensive supervision, then they are responsible for their actions to that degree.
@J9sling @SaysHummingbird Perhaps I misunderstand, but I'd agree minors should never be doxed, and threats against the schools or the kids must be prosecuted. Nonetheless, this national conversation is important- modern video has proven the best tool to expose racist behavior that must be addressed.

@CanterburyTells @wvbusinessowner @BJDeFelice @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC LOL- me too!  We may have lost our WV friend, but perhaps he is actually looking at those photos.  (sigh)  One can hope!
@CanterburyTells @BJDeFelice @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC He would certainly consider that a benefit.
@wvbusinessowner @BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC No, Canterbury is correct.  Y'all are basing your calculations on profoundly bad misinformation- that accounts for the discrepancies- for the different conclusions that are drawn.  Double-check your assumptions first.
@CanterburyTells @BJDeFelice @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC The biggest problem our country faces is lack of education, along with the manipulation of the resulting fear our less-fortunate citizens are susceptible to.  It is quite sobering to see.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Trump owns this shutdown- and he wants the shutdown more than he wants a wall.  McConnell has contributed by dereliction of his own responsibilities- he needs to hold a vote and not be a snowflake about potential vetos.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Thank God for Speaker Pelosi and our historic blue wave that put her second in line to the Presidency (no, she's not third) https://t.co/h1VFOJmrlp That manipulative hateful traitor Trump needs to recognize his place- he is not king!
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I promise you, if I thought that wall would save any American lives, I would be for it.  But honestly, you are being deceived.  Please, do more research.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC * THAT is a favorite Trump deception
@CanterburyTells @BJDeFelice @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC (Yes- LOL- I ran out of characters!)
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Trump just does not like our asylum laws, so he pretends they don't exist.  He needs to work with Congress to change the laws instead- and I refuse to believe that our country will ever become THAT ugly and hateful. Trump is supposed to uphold the laws, yet he undermines them.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC It's not just a ruling, it's a treaty- Federal law. All state laws are subordinate- void if in conflict. Legit asylees can arrive any damned way they need to for their own safety. Asylees are NEVER "illegal" no matter what tunnel they crawled through- THAT is a Trump's deception.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC That was a weirdly slanted article- the "cost-shifting" argument applies to anyone without health insurance- legal or not.  It's a significant argument for universal coverage. And their "conservative" assumptions are exactly the opposite of that- chosen to maximize the figures.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Please look at the hundreds of gorgeous photos of the border that people have attached to this thread, and read their perspectives- historic churches would be destroyed, etc.  Even a free wall would be a tragedy for our own country. Have you been there? https://t.co/Rme7WEmab9
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Please look into the attitudes of Texans living on the border toward this absurd wall- they don't want to give up their water rights to the fourth-longest river in the US just to look at an ugly wall.  It would also destroy National Parks and wildlife refuges- without benefit.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC You do realize that the $5.7 billion is only the first of many installments toward a wall, right?  Trump will do this again next year if the Democrats cave in to his insanity.
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC ...successfully pull off a convincing misrepresentation of their legal status ever get any benefits.  If we discover their status, the benefits stop. That sloppy system is a different sort of problem than any wall could ever solve. Improve our systems to eliminate that problem.

To be qualified one has to be here under asylum, admitted for permanent residence, or fit another limited federal category"  As your link makes clear, only those who...
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC Here is a link I happened to have open already, just to give you an idea where the factual distortions are occuring:  https://t.co/FK6gLTTu2m
@BJDeFelice @CanterburyTells @hrtablaze @Dimitri2020LLC I'll try to come back with some links later today, but the wall is quite seriously a mirage. More than half of our new "illegals" arrive legally but do not leave when promised. But the figures you've seen on welfare reflect distorted stats based on households-simply not accurate.
@dave00815960 @tallsam @robertklevens @MiamiHerald (sigh) While I definitely do agree that this is a far more serious crisis than our border issues, I hope you are being facetious about shutting down the government ever being the appropriate way of accomplishing something positive.
@scustweet @roigfj @RealSaavedra That is a huge leap, if from her comments you conclude she is an "open-border socialist".

@Tracypoovey @tonyposnanski You raise a valid and important point: 'when "we" become crude and disparaging, we're just blowing off steam; when "they" do it, they are sinking to new lows.'/s Polite civil discourse does indeed become all the more important when it is hard to force oneself to maintain decorum.

@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump One more link:  https://t.co/2HgGftqEHm This is the study you may not have heard of if you get your info from Fox News.  Lots to learn from it, but one observation is that people who watch NO NEWS AT ALL are able to answer current events questions better than those who watch Fox.
@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump One more- to show you that these drug seizure totals include those seized in the 11 million containers that arrive by sea each year.  How many do you think we search now? Our drug-inderdiction money is better spent looking at a higher percentage of these. https://t.co/wyRUA6MBD3
@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump Read this discussion of preclearance locations on the CBP website:  https://t.co/BMkgVJKKer The US has 600 agents in 15 locations within 6 other countries- and their drug interdictions are included in those figures that Fox apparently pretends happened at the Mexican border.
@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump To understand the significant difference between the two, read through this info:  https://t.co/DOog18H67Y  The area covered by this agency includes not just the North AND South Borders, but ALL of our ports of entry- airports, sea, and preclearance locations overseas! Surprised?
@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump I just clipped these two charts from CBP's website:  https://t.co/7lqbJWrvWF  Have a close look at the numbers on the two charts.  See which chart matches the screen you saw on Fox News?  This is not a trivial distinction- that title on their screen is extremely deceptive.  /2 https://t.co/5tR2IBRm5S
@RedWavery @Cavanuk @Smoke292988 @AppSame @realDonaldTrump Do those quantities look backpackable to you? They prove our point all by themselves, without more.  Nontheless, I looked up that data, and found it. Fox News has lied in the title of this screen!  These are NOT the amounts found at the border- much less at the Mexican border. 1/
