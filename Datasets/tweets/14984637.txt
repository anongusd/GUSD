I urge President Trump to put the American people first and end his shutdown now.
Last week, House Democrats gave the Senate and President Trump what they need to reopen the government‚Äîpassing a spending package with significant bipartisan consensus ‚Äîand make way for a meaningful debate on immigration. This week we are doing it again.
We have 800,000 federal workers worried about making ends meet, families wondering whether they will get help next month to put food on the table, and an American public losing faith in whether their government will be open for business on any given day.
The real crisis we need to address is one of President Trump‚Äôs own making‚Äîa government shutdown that has now finished its 18th day.
‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù only serves to divide us and distract us from the important discussions we need to have about immigration reform, the treatment of those seeking asylum in our great country, and the best way to allocate resources to secure our nation from within and without.
Nothing President Trump said tonight demonstrates that this wall is anything more than a monument to himself.

I hope the Trump administration will work with Congress to address these significant issues in the President's #NAFTA plan and support American workers, as he‚Äôs long promised to do.
I'm disappointed to see more sweeteners for big Pharma in President Trump‚Äôs #NAFTA deal. At a time when drug companies are raising prices &amp; making record profits after receiving a multi-billion $$ tax cut, this deal inexplicably extends market exclusivity for drug companies.
It‚Äôs outrageous that one week after 13 federal agencies issued a report warning of the dire effects of #climatechange, President Trump's #NAFTA plan doesn‚Äôt even mention efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, hold polluters accountable or invest in renewable energy.
If President Trump‚Äôs #NAFTA plan does not include penalties for outsourcing, corporations will continue to send jobs to Mexico, pay those workers poverty wages and flood our market with cheaply-produced goods made elsewhere.
When President Trump first announced his intent to renegotiate #NAFTA, I was hopeful that we could get a better deal for American workers. Sadly, once again, he has overpromised. His NAFTA 2.0 plan does nothing to enforce or improve labor standards.
After receiving a multi-million-dollar tax giveaway, @GM shipped 15,000 American jobs offshore. Tomorrow Trump plans to sign a #NAFTA 2.0 plan that does nothing to stop this from happening again. 		Read my full statement #mepolitics ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/BXgLJ6LNAB https://t.co/6vLop71jKJ

Many questions also remain about whether the Trump administration has the proper facilities to make this possible and why no Members of Congress have so far been allowed to visit facilities housing girls and babies‚Äîa must for performing our oversight responsibilities.
This order is by no means the end of the issue. We do not know how isolated children will be reunited w/ their families. The Trump admin has not changed its zero-tolerance policy of indiscriminately prosecuting adults and is seeking authority to detain families indefinitely.

I‚Äôve supported concrete and comprehensive proposals to bring Rx drug costs down. If President Trump really wants to make a difference, he‚Äôll show his support for these proposals next week.
We can‚Äôt understate this crisis. As Rx drug costs continue to grow, millions of people face a choice between their health and their financial security ‚Äì a choice that‚Äôs been exacerbated by Republicans‚Äô constant efforts to undermine the #ACA and drive up out-of-pocket costs.
States across the country, most recently including Maine, have taken steps to clarify what exactly goes into drug pricing decisions by manufacturers. We should be taking those steps on the federal side, too.
The drug pricing issue is complicated, and we know that a lot of different factors contribute to high costs for consumers. That‚Äôs why we should also be focusing on transparency.

I'm the lead sponsor of the bipartisan Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act (H.R.1480). @SenJohnMcCain has introduced a companion bill (S.64) in the Senate. Our bills would allow individuals to import a 90-day supply of most medications from approved Canadian pharmacies.
I‚Äôve led groups of Maine seniors on trips to licensed Canadian pharmacies, which often resulted in hundreds of savings each month. Now, years later, many Rx drugs in Canada still remain a fraction of the cost of their U.S. equivalent‚Äì in part b/c of their ability to negotiate.
In Congress, I‚Äôve supported similar approaches allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices under Medicare Part D. I believe these market-based solutions could go a long way toward lowering overall health care costs in this country and ensuring access to care.
The Maine Rx Program was challenged by drug companies through the courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was upheld in Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644 (2003).
Next wk, @realDonaldTrump plans to make a speech about Rx drug costs. I‚Äôve been working on this issue for nearly two decades + have some ideas for him. In the Maine Senate, I introduced a bill creating the Maine Rx program, which gave the state purchasing power to lower Rx costs. https://t.co/qZUORkhXmp

H.R. 38 is the 1st gun bill we've taken up after 327 mass shootings this yr. It will actually make it harder for local law enforcement to do their jobs.

For some, harmful impacts of the #GOPTaxPlan will come immediately, in the form of repealing important deductions that offer relief to graduates, teachers, those with high medical expenses, &amp; many others. #mepolitics

Stories like Banah‚Äôs put pressure on @POTUS to take Iraq out of #TravelBan, but new order is no less harmful to security, American values.
20-year-old Iraqi immigrant, Banah Al-Hanfy, whose father served as an interpreter for the U.S. in Iraq, was stranded b/c of his #travelban.
