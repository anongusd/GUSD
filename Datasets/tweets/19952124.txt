@sap_aws @applebyj for when to automatically push data from one tier to the next.  DLM can work with data in HANA, HANA Dynamic Tiering, HANA Extension Node, IQ, Hadoop, Data Hub Vora, or SCP BDS. 		Dynamic Tiering ‚Äì https://t.co/zrfSA1ceCh 	HANA SQL Data Warehousing ‚Äì https://t.co/BEAwL3kq3k
@sap_aws @applebyj and should not be confused with the HANA native SQL big data warehousing tiering strategy, which does include native IQ as an option.  The HANA Data Warehousing Foundation‚Äôs DLM tool is very easy to use to create rules
@sap_aws @applebyj where we have another HANA instance.  Advantages of the Extension Node are that the HANA application does not need any changes and all the analytical engines are built directly into the HANA server.  NLS with IQ (or Hadoop although slower query speeds) is a BW implementation
@sap_aws @applebyj so there is no need for a separate compression license or any compression process.  Dynamic Tiering is already certified on AWS, which makes HANA agile data marts and data warehousing simpler on AWS.  A separate warm tier option to Dynamic Tiering is an Extension Node
@sap_aws @applebyj across both HANA in-memory hot tier and dynamic tiering disk warm tier, making it transparent to query across both hot and warm tiers.  Both HANA (hot) and Dynamic Tiering (warm) have high compression natively built-in from the ground up
@sap_aws @applebyj Part of the confusion comes in that the DTO strategy is focused on BW/4HANA in general rather than on native SQL HANA data warehousing, so some of the emphasis is slightly different.  Dynamic Tiering is integrated inside HANA and includes Multistore tables for partitioning data
