@robbystarbuck True, and I understand the need. Democrats should expect a blowback given how much Republicans as a whole are painted as racist. They should take the time to reflect on how prevalent racism has been used as a political tool, instead of wanting to equal racism out. Just expected.
@robbystarbuck To me, this is just a reaction to the reaction.

@TexasOilie @patriot4fr33 @charliekirk11 Strom Thurmond
@ChunkyTWshngtn @charliekirk11 Yes, we all know the further we go back in time the less racist the Republicans were. Things changed, and the more recent civil rights acts reflect that. This is why Strom Thurmond and other Dixiecrats became Republican.
@ChunkyTWshngtn @charliekirk11 I don‚Äôt? Who the fuck are you to tell me what I have/haven‚Äôt earned?		I‚Äôm ignorant for using an actual historian instead of GOP pundits for my evidence?

@MMcCoy1966 @charliekirk11 I absolutely would too and our Constitution protects us from that.

@MMcCoy1966 @charliekirk11 Sure I‚Äôm not going to deny that the Soviet Union or Communist China killed millions of people.

@HTJunky @charliekirk11 What‚Äôs 8X worse than dead?		We have more empty houses than homeless people...		In an extremely general sense, yes, even the poorest have a better life and opportunities here than in ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Venezuela. They also have a better chance than in ‚Äúlimited government‚Äù Somalia..
@MMcCoy1966 @charliekirk11 He is combining unrelated things under one label to create an extreme number in order to fearmonger about US domestic policy debates. His ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and attempt to use them as an argument are bad.
@stc4025 @MMcCoy1966 @charliekirk11 Exactly. All deaths in the name of those things and a lot of those ‚Äú100 million killed by socialism‚Äù can easily be described as ‚Äúcompletely different pursuits‚Äù. Lumping everything under one label makes it easy to smear opposing ideas without critical thinking.
@UF_Trader @charliekirk11 I think if we get it down to 40M/week you‚Äôll find it all works out.* 	The point is if Charlie wants to convince people AOC and her ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù policies are really some existential threat, he should use direct evidence rather than laughable generalizations.		*This is sarcasm btw
@MMcCoy1966 @charliekirk11 It does. 		It also seems like a lot of we add up all deaths that resulted from the pursuit of private profit, or say, in the name of Abrahamic Religions, because that is just as accurate and reliable an argument for never promoting those things. 		Meaning not reliable at all.
@HTJunky @charliekirk11 I think you misunderstood the richer portion of the comment. He generalized that ‚Äúpoor people in America should be happy they are suffering here instead of there‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt address the realities of people living and dying on a sidewalk in the richest nation in the world.

@CocoaMonoi @NEVADA4SHANNON @NBCNews There‚Äôs a difference. Targeted means the advertisements are shown to specific communities; representation in those ads helps but not required.

@mfow020 @i_wonder1349 @MarkDice @NBCNews True, but blasting children with junk food ads is always going to sway purchases.

Venezuela is actually a terrible example because our situation isn‚Äôt similar at all. It‚Äôs the go-to bc npcs can‚Äôt debate Europe
@ncfsoldierboy @RealCandaceO It doesn‚Äôt on its own. I have conservative family that votes Republican, nothing wrong with it. They‚Äôre npcs if they vote Republican AND do braindead partisan things like shout ‚ÄúVenezuela!‚Äù during discussions of domestic policy.
@ncfsoldierboy @RealCandaceO I would be completely for a movement that was just ‚Äúhey guys, let‚Äôs reconsider why our community typically votes one way, and here are some reasons why we should vote the other way.‚Äù		But blexit npcs are much more demeaning than that.
@ncfsoldierboy @RealCandaceO Candace basically says that. That‚Äôs what the plantation narrative is. *Black democrats arent making their voting decision based on intelligent choice, they are brainwashed slaves.* It‚Äôs denying them their agency and positing that blacks don‚Äôt already know why they are voting.
@ncfsoldierboy @RealCandaceO The factual considersations that black democrats make when voting. Then complain when they are ostracized by their community after insulting them. 		During young black leadership conference some ppl took it as an opportunity to promote independence, npcs want GOP devotion. 2/2
@ncfsoldierboy @RealCandaceO Oh I‚Äôve definitely already started. Not all conservatives are npcs, just the ones who repeat the same tired talking points and insults, just as some liberals do. 		lot of reasons.

@LastWor98202586 @SaltyShrimpface @StefanMolyneux @0xnaka It‚Äôs not my fault ‚ÄúWhite Advocates‚Äù can‚Äôt seem to organize without ultimately revealing that the reason many members join is to revel in their hatred of others.		And Stefan doesn‚Äôt understand what advocacy means. The ‚Äúgroup‚Äù in power don‚Äôt need an advocate.
@GrantWilliams82 @StefanMolyneux @0xnaka It‚Äôs a beginning of a list from a TWEET. this doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdemonstrate‚Äù anything.
@SaltyShrimpface @StefanMolyneux @0xnaka I didn‚Äôt list anything, I‚Äôm pointing out how he refuses to tackle any response that actually challenges his position.
@ohioMom10 @charliekirk11 1. Apparently more awesome than yourself, i‚Äôd hold back on judging anyone else (I‚Äôm assuming Michelle).	2. You must have some terrible opinions to receive ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù. plenty of conservatives have jobs, you‚Äôre probably extreme on something.
@Jodi__WB @ignoranceloses @RealCandaceO Nice simplified, generalized statement. üëç
@StefanMolyneux To quote another response from @0xnaka from your tweet, ‚ÄúAryan brotherhood, National Association for the Advancement of White People,  White Aryan Resistance, White America, Inc, Volksfront, Phineas Priesthood, Pacifica Forum, Br√ºder Schweigen, Occidental Quarterly, National V..‚Äù

@mitchellvii Hurr durr please tolerate my bigotry. Why play these games with these silly statements.
@joannkeller84 @charliekirk11 Depends how bad the report is. And impeached is just the House.
@ignoranceloses @RealCandaceO Why do you support simplified, general bullshit statements? How many stupid kids pick up a gun because they are trying to act ‚Äúlike a man‚Äù and solve their own problems? Breaking down actions into ‚Äúacting like women‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful for society and makes no sense on its own.
@RealCandaceO Lol you are gonna need to be more specific. What is ‚Äúacting like women‚Äù? Do we have problems because men are being encouraged to talk about their emotions in therapy instead of holding in anger like manly men of the past? ü§î
@charliekirk11 If impeaching Trump means one less potential mail bomber, wouldn‚Äôt that be worth it? ü§î
@StefanMolyneux And? That slavery didn‚Äôt create a racist social structure in America. Can I call every caveman white and try to argue their struggles too? Doesn‚Äôt diminish the problems chattel slavery based on race has caused for modern black Americans.

@StefanMolyneux I knew you tweeted blind. ü•Å
@Corneleusthe2nd @StefanMolyneux I‚Äôm saying if a mall contains women‚Äôs stores because the environment is more profitable from women, how is that a sign of patriarchy?  If malls with men‚Äôs stores is not as profitable, it‚Äôs because men made the choice to shop in other locations.
@Corneleusthe2nd @StefanMolyneux because they shop around? Why does it matter if the store you need is located inside a mall or has its own building?

@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Ill look but doubt much research available on race+age+preferred sport vs. available sport.. X is unlikely to become a professional motocross racer if they grew up in a ghetto having to duck for bullets and no way to discover or support that passion early. Basketball is simple.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux I would argue that whites generally have more access to a variety of recreational activities. Their desires are therefore more sparsely spread, compared to, generally, poor black children who can only rely on one neighborhood or school team, for sports that only need a ball.
@derekahunter @RealSaavedra @davidhogg111 He is not ‚Äúdenying‚Äù anyone a spot. He applied and EARNED his own spot through his activism and organizational leadership. Agree with him or not, don‚Äôt try to pull some bullshit race card here or somehow diminish his own personal achievements.
@RenegadeWestern @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux That‚Äôs a fair response. Though we should all try and challenge the other person‚Äôs bad assumptions/generalizations rather falling back on defensive logic, which is true but not completely productive haha. And completely agree on the importance of culture.
@RenegadeWestern @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Yer funny if you‚Äôre taking online comments seriously and using that to justify your own beliefs on race. 		If someone says I‚Äôm responsible for slavery I laugh and pity them, not use that as an excuse to rally behind meaningless social categorizations.
@RenegadeWestern @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Please describe the situation where you were individually blamed for all slavery in the world.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 3. Agreed it‚Äôs completely subjective. I meant in pure mortality terms everyone who is alive right at this moment is a product of their ancestor‚Äôs successful life and reproduction.		4. Not bothered or anything specific. people are naturally flawed, which results in violence, etc.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Nurture entirely. Sports are desire + access. Desire about the sport is largely based on tradition and culture as mentioned. Access: How many archery courses or swimming pools with diving boards or chances to snowboard are available to majority of black American children compared
@leonora_ruybal @charliekirk11 I would be placed on state-funded medical care, something he regularly detests.  How long could I be on state-funded medical care until Charlie started shaming me?
@charliekirk11 I‚Äôm honestly sorry for your loss. I know how hard mental illness can wreck people‚Äôs lives. Which is why when you personally advocate for destroying public access to mental healthcare, you are not providing help for those who really need it and these words are only seasonal.
@charliekirk11 What if I rely on socialist medicine for my antidepressant medications and counseling after a suicide attempt? Don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm a dirty liberal for wanting to live during a time I don‚Äôt have money or insurance?		You basically say everyday those people are a drain on society.

I‚Äôve spent so many years hearing the same racial IQ and ‚ÄúEuropeans created the world‚Äù generalized bullshit online, that when I saw his ‚Äúno more guilt‚Äù post I was infuriated. I appreciate he‚Äôs not a supremacist at least.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 1.  Ok, I get it. I understand that desire and in cases that it can be reasonable to guess a biological component.		Any claims about sports turn me away though. I feel like ‚ÄúEast Asians‚Äù generally have more access to sports or activities that require equipment.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 3. Fair take. But then we argue how much slaves, India‚Äôs resources, knowledge from the Middle East and China were important... 	I‚Äôd say the inventor of concrete contributed more to history than a carpenter for 50 years. 		4. Not shame. No one controls the past. More disappointed.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 1. That‚Äôs fair, and makes more sense than saying X race being present in X sport is some kind of biological determination. 		2. Which video? The Poland one? No. I‚Äôll assume he was genuine but his tweets are very general about being descended from the creators of civilization.
@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 3.  A shoemaker doesn‚Äôt have an equivalent contribution to ‚Äúwestern civilization‚Äù as Washington or DaVinci or whoever.

@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux 1. The differences he points out aren‚Äôt based on science. Maybe basketball is just not popular with East Asians? What race is best at water polo?		2. Stefan literally claimed his ancestors made the modern world. What did they actually do individually?		/1
@chaarrlliieeeee @RefugeeNik @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Why did he say her ancestors were living in trees? At least my statements aren‚Äôt hyperbolic bullshit.

@ID7Dee @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux How? Molyneux was claimed he was tired of feeling guilty for ‚Äúhis ancestors‚Äù creating the modern world.		Did his ACTUAL ancestor accomplish something? Or does he just want an undeserved association to feel better about his individual failures?
@SKenneyGirlTan @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux No. I‚Äôm saying that an individual bricklayer or a family of bricklayers isn‚Äôt drastically ‚Äúmaking western civilization, democracy, and the modern world‚Äù, which white people like to claim credit for collectively. 		It‚Äôs fine to be proud of individual and family achievements.
@RefugeeNik @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Good portion of people‚Äôs ancestors used hammers. How is that racist?
@SKenneyGirlTan @aprillee1983 @StefanMolyneux Not trying to imply bricklaying is bad. Supposedly someone I‚Äôm related to help construct the Mormon Temple in Utah.
