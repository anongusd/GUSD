@MyRedBeetle We will not give the children back to people who are not their guardians. The laws in place now make us separate the children from the adults. These policies have been in place for at least two decades.
@MyRedBeetle I am a senior border pat agent. The cartels are sending most of these children over our border. By doing this they make us use our limited resources so they can smuggle drugs/hum traffic. 75-80% of the time the children do not know the adult with them. It‚Äôs a horrible situation.
