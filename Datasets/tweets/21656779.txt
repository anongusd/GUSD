@Broncos @PaxtonLynch What is your favorite movie/TV line of all time and can you act it out? #askpax
I love that @jctheproducer just asked if DJ Khaled and Calliou are the same person.

Watching the #NFLDraft2016 just reminded me that I should tell you how good the movie "Draft Day" is.
I'm all for being confident but listening to someone talk about how beautiful they ALL THE TIME is not cute.
Apparently it’s “Take Your Child To Work Day.” THESE KIDS DO NOT LOOK LIKE KIDS!

I am so glad I'm not a bird. I'd pretty much find any reason not to fly. I'd probably just sit on top of cars and let them take me wherever.
