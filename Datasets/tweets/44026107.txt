But trans people, esp transfeminine people, are under attack--on the streets, by the police, by their 'communities' #TDOA
RT @ca_advocate: Check out what @NQAPIA said in response to the #SCOTUS decision http://t.co/c21QX0nx2k #LoveWins #MoreThanMarriage
Without the leadership &amp; visionary action of #twoc, there would be no LGBTQ movement as it is #TDOA
Today is #TDOA, trans day of action. We take today to honor the leadership of trans women/gender nonconforming POC !
It is time, it is always time, to support trans activists who are undoing this corrupt system!  #TDOA
In 2015 we've seen 12 reported murders of trans women ALREADY #TDOA
In detention and prison, trans ppl are ~17x more likely to be raped #TDOA
What @JennicetG was pointing to at the white house, were the deplorable conditions of #twoc in detention centers #TDOA
Specifically, low-income gender nonconforming people often pay the price for 'visibility' #TDOA
so as some of us celebrate marriage, think about who has and will pay the cost of visibility #TDOA
as queer people of color in particular, our most important movement work has happened bc of the leadership of trans women of color #TDOA
RT @NCAPAtweets: All love is equal! Thank you, #SCOTUS! #MarriageEquality #samesexmarriage (Photo: @NQAPIA) http://t.co/8xgd69FWcT
It needs to stop!  trans people and issues need to be central to our ideas of 'love' and 'justice'! #TDOA
And yet our movement has turned their back on trans issues so many times #TDOA
Know your history.  Trans women of color paved the way for everything we understand as 'LGBT progress' today and more #TDOA
#Stonewall was a RIOT against the police initiated by low-income trans &amp; gender nonconforming people of color #TDOA
Trans and gender nonconforming people, activists, communities deserve our material &amp; social support #TDOA
We acknowledge that as some are celebrating marriage, many more are fighting for basic rights--right to life, housing, and justice #TDOA
We celebrate the #TDOA march at Christopher Street Pier in New York City

Trans women housed w/men in #immgrationdetention. For "their" safety women are put in solitary confinement. Will @BarackObama address this?
@BarackObama speaks on immigration tmrw at 8pm est. On #TDOR, will #adminrelief include trans folks? Folks in detention? #translivesmatter
a large percentage of anti-trans violence is intimate partner and anti-sex worker violence. these systems r connected #TransLivesMatter
policing men of color for their genders is also an act of gender violence. gender is racialized #TransLivesMatter
y is Gay Inc using trans of color life/death as a funding strategy but continuing 2 steamroll our issues &amp; not hire tpoc? #TransLivesMatter
let's interrogate who gets to be 'out' and 'proud' on the brochures and who is facing the brunt of anti-trans violence #TransLivesMatter
people are the genders they say they are period #TransLivesMatter
#JusticeForJennifer is about resisting transmisogyny &amp; the sustained US occupation in the Philippines that escalates gender violence
creating trans or GBT pods in detention centers doesn't make detention less violent #TransLivesMatter
gender self-determination doesn't just mean we respect trans medical procedures. it means we trust ppl w their own bodies! #TransLivesMatter
the courts are NOT where we are going to find justice for TPOC life. the laws were built to kill, not sustain us. #TransLivesMatter
#TDOR is not new.  It was started in 1998.  Let's educate ourselves on that history! #TransLivesMatter
racism actually stabilizes and perpetuates the gender binary #TransLivesMatter
if your solution to 'transphobia' is to blame poor immigrant communities &amp; POC then you're part of the problem #TransLivesMatter
the gay movement (TM) has been and continues to be built on the labor of trans women of color #TransLIvesMatter

Something you can do right now! Sign! #JusticeForJennifer #TransLivesMatter http://t.co/w48sVY7vvW
the mobilization of police in #Ferguson is also an issue of gender violence #BlackLivesMatter #TransLivesMatter
When 73% of LGBT hate violence victims are black, we need to be centering racial justice. #BlackLivesMatter #TransLivesMatter
the answer to anti-trans violence is not prisons, military,or police. those institutions actually uphold gender violence. #TransLivesMatter
'Trans women of color' too often becomes a funding strategy or vocabulary drop, not a commitment to solidarity #TransLivesMatter
how have u supported &amp; built relationships w TPOC organizers?#TransLivesMatter
#TransLivesMatter should actually not be a revolutionary ask, but it is. The basic freedom to live, survive, move!
if you know the name Matthew Shephard but not Tiffany Edwards &amp; Jennifer Laude, you're part of the problem #TransLivesMatter
RT @Shaananigans: A4. TPOC causes aren't funded because people think a retweet = support = enough. #TransLivesMatter

Gender is about race.  Period. #TransLivesMatter
Hate crimes legislation actually escalates incarceration and police spending / TPOC suffer the consequences #TransLivesMatter
let's stop twisting narratives of anti-trans violence to make it seem like hate crimes legislation/police will protect #TransLivesMatter
Trans women are 19 times more likely to be raped in prison.  prison IS gender violence. #TransLivesMatter
Erasing femininity from bodies you don't think 'look feminine' is an act of gender violence #TransLivesMatter
Forcing ppl to accord to your idea of what their gender should be is an act of gender violence #TransLivesMatter
Resisting state violence is a trans act #TransLivesMatter
Transmisogyny is inherent to colonialism #TransLivesMatter
forcibly integrating indigenous ppl into white gender norms was part of the colonial project #TransLivesMatter
who has the privilege to have their death mourned &amp; whose death is lumped into a statistic? (sometimes not even that)  #TransLivesMatter
The freedom to move through the world safely is currently determined by race&amp;class. It shouldn't be #TransLivesMatter
let's not narrow our demands. eg we want trans healthcare but we also want universal healthcare! #TransLivesMatter
anti-trans violence is about race&amp;class as much as it is about gender #TransLivesMatter
Trans/GNC people have existed in different forms pre-colonization. We have been erased from the archive-let's remake it #TransLivesMatter
instead of blaming poor immigrant ppl for not using gnc pronouns let's blame the colonizers for creating gender binaries #TransLivesMatter
US military occupation ESCALATES anti-trans violence. it doesn't 'save' trans ppl. #TransLivesMatter #justiceForJennifer
trans &amp; gender nonconforming poc have been surviving impossible conditions 5ever. abolition is not too high an ask #TransLivesMatter
Prison abolition is an act of trans justice #TransLivesMatter
#TransLivesMatter should not be the one time your cis queer-dominated or feminist organization talks about trans people
who has the access to an apartment/car/space/etc to be visibly trans &amp; fabulous &amp; not criminalized? who is beaten for it? #TransLivesMatter
AAPI feminist organizations: figure out how to center the oppression of trans women/trans feminine people in your work! #TransLivesMatter
how are you creating systems of care for TPOC organizers who put their lives on the line everyday? #TransLivesMatter
The gender binary actually *comes from colonization*. colonial institutions like the prison &amp; police will not dismantle it #TransLivesMatter
we need to regard violence against trans women of color AS A RACIALIZED PROBLEM #TransLivesMatter
While we're at it, to support #TransLivesMatter let's decriminalize sex work
The answer to LGBT hate violence is never to put more people in prison #TransLivesMatter
Blaming 'transphobia' on individuals leads to more incarceration (largely of black &amp; poc men) NOT societal transformation #TransLivesMatter
The demand of #TransLivesMatter should not be a radical one! It is about basic freedom that should already exist!
Would love to see coalitions of AAPI cis women + trans ppl fighting shared racialized patriarchy #TransLivesMatter
Cis feminists: educate your communities on how gender oppression doesn't just belong to cis women!! #TransLivesMatter
Cis people need to be supporting trans poc organizers who are doing the work NOW, not just mourning. we need both. #TransLivesMatter
trans &amp; Filipin@ activists demanding #JusticeForJennifer is about resisting both militarization &amp; transmisogyny #TransLivesMatter
53% of LGBT hate violence victims are trans women. 89% are POC. Why are white gay men the face of anti-LGBT violence??? #TransLivesMatter
A trans woman is murdered in the world every 32 hours: http://t.co/LhwCycR4Kz . This is a genocide &amp; we are complicit. #TransLivesMatter
Trans life needs not just  head nods but RESOURCES. how have you redistributed time/money/energy to tpoc  organizers? #TransLivesMatter
People with colonized histories or presents can't abstract gender from those histories #TransLivesMatter
Detention is bad for everyone, &amp; particularly violent for trans women! Tell Obama to grant administrative relief: http://t.co/pxY81mrPZx
Let's figure out how to uplift trans life that is not beautiful/fabulous/conventional/visible #TransLivesMatter #NoExceptions
Filipin@ activists demanding the removal of US military from land and community is a move towards trans justice/life #TransLivesMatter
The military is an institution that exacerbates gender violence, both within and outside of it #TransLivesMatter #JusticeForJennifer
89% of LGBT hate violence victims are POC, and 73% are black.  Let's be specific. #TransLivesMatter
