This #WomensHistoryMonth I am proud to follow in the footsteps of the women who came before me. And continue to work with the record-breaking 131 women in Congress to fight for issues related to women, families, and equality. @HouseDemWomen

This decision by the Canadian govt is highly irresponsible and puts our shared natural resources + Puget Sound orcas at risk. This is counter to what should be a global effort to move away from a fossil fuels &amp; towards clean energy. This is beyond disappointing. It is dangerous. https://t.co/LI8tTc0RGM
I had a wonderful time meeting with CAF√â in Wenatchee today. We had a great conversation about the lifelong benefits of early childhood education, immigration reform, and how my first few months in Congress have been.
¬°Much√≠simas gracias a Caf√© por organizar una gran cita comunitaria en Wenatchee! Tuvimos una gran conversaci√≥n sobre los beneficios de una buena educaci√≥n, reforma inmigratoria, y mi experiencia en el congreso. https://t.co/ppOPkNaB8e

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Proud to be one of those cosponsors. As soon as I heard there was a resolution like this, I made sure to sign on. The President‚Äôs action sets a dangerous precedent. https://t.co/ngrsC3SDjW
The President‚Äôs gag rule is dangerous because patients deserve to know all of their options. Health care decisions should be left to patients and their provider-there‚Äôs no place for politics in the exam room.¬†As a doctor, I strongly oppose the gag rule. #nogagrule
Learned a lot during a tour of the Cle Elum Fish Helix and it was impressive to see in person. The helix is critical to restoring fish habitats for tribal use and the overall environmental needs of our district. https://t.co/EUJeL269Bm
It is incumbent on all of us to speak out when there is injustice, racism or xenophobia in our community. This is one example. I am speaking up to make clear that there is no place for hate in #WA08. This is a time to stand with all of our neighbors. https://t.co/NLLm3YXpju

The President‚Äôs #nationalemergency is an abuse of power. https://t.co/L1q70i55Jy
It is beyond frustrating that our President has declared a #NationalEmergency to get his wall funding. We Americans know what an emergency looks like. Families seeking asylum are not a national emergency and this an abuse of power.
This is what a compromise looks like. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for hashing out an agreement that prevented a second, unnecessary shutdown. My full statement: https://t.co/OoH3HEAcWg
Today marks one year since the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. No parent should fear sending their child to school &amp; no child should fear going to school. We must commit ourselves to making sure this never happens again #MSDStrong

The average age of a child involved in an accidental shooting is 3. And  over 17,000 children and teens are injured or killed by gun violence every year. We must do better. #enoughisenough #EndGunViolence

Background checks are a big part of gun safety. But guns must be stored safely so they don‚Äôt end up in the hands of children, or those who would do themselves or others harm. https://t.co/9wabinvXaN
Due to inclement weather, my office in Issaquah will be closed today. Stay safe and warm out there!
Yet another attempt to restrict women's access to healthcare. Rather than creating medically unwarranted barriers to abortion care, how about focusing on real threats to women like maternal mortality? Make no mistake, delayed abortion only increases risk to women. Enough! https://t.co/wXhNbqEK55
If men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay. It‚Äôs that simple. Proud to be a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure #EqualPay

Now let‚Äôs work together on sensible, evidence-based border security measures that will keep government open and prevent something like this from happening again. The American people should never be held hostage as a negotiating technique.
