@IdahPeterside Congratulations
@LagosTalks913 #sportzone pls save England blushes. Let 'bronze go home' since the ball is heading north!
@IamDrSID A confirmation that group D was indeed the group of death.
@SegunThePundit The pundit you are not nice at all! You railroad football to Croatia. You are not welcome to the UK anymore. Visa cancelled.
Whoa? Football veers off England heads to Croatia its preferred destination!
Awwwww! Football is not coming home!
@MarcusRashford @England @youngy18 Champions in waiting
@MarcusRashford @England @youngy18 You are already a lion. Champions in waiting rather!
@JPickford1 Well done pickford
@thomasmlambo @CocaCola_ZA Spain2-0Russia
@dino_melaye Not as much as kill a cow, but stop a cow from grazing, at least 200 people will be slaughtered.
@ShehuSani Even ghost citizens will outnumber the living Nigerians!
@FCBarcelona @Phil_Coutinho Happy birthday Coutinho
@LagosTalks913 #sportzone what's the name of the Dr, author in the house?
@DefendLikeEze @bimbolovesmusic @thenff @NGSuperEagles Good heart, good spirit, great sportsmanship!
@chaplinez70 I always ignore them. This is one habit we should kill from the root. Learn to just thank them back for their courtesies! Ce fini!
@Sadiq_Cyrus All is fair in a warfare. RMD stuck to a game plan. Liverpool had to plan B. As soon as Salah was injured,the team went lame. Lesson: Never build your strategy on a single player. I hope Egypt &amp; the rest of Africa have taken note to avoid lacklustre performance in Russia!
@chaplinez70 Your pessimism is not without a reason. Nothing palpable, tangible or visible to be positive about. I feel the same way. Everything now boils down to luck &amp; god factor. How long shall we continue to live like this?
@LagosTalks913 #sportzone913	Please Charles should see the bigger picture. AJ knows better the manipulations in American boxing rings. Home advantage is good for AJ
@LagosTalks913 #sportzone913
@LagosTalks913 #sportszone. Charles you are my man anytime , anyday!
@LagosTalks913
Merry Christmas to peoples of the world https://t.co/u3joaBlg5m
@ShehuSani Our roads are not bad,there are only gullies on it
@genakhena Na Lagos stress &amp; signs of the time we are in
@LagosTalks913 A cow which goes to church is called a sacred cow!
@LagosTalks913 Black players should develop strong mental resistance to racism. Silence is golden. Prove you mettle by being the best.
@LagosTalks913 i will rather advice black players to avoid destination Italy!
@LagosTalks913 Kindly ask Dr. Ladipo to properly introduce himself. Is he Rafiu or Rauf Ladipo?
@LagosTalks913  Charles What is the outcome of the match between Gombe United &amp; Enugu Rangers?
@LagosTalks913 @chaplinez70 @kallyjoe @SegunThePundit @BabatundeKoiki what is the outcome between in the match between Gombe United &amp; Enugu Rangers played yesterday?
