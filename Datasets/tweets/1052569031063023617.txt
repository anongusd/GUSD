@HeatherEbert @gregpmiller This is the truth. I read the transcript of Cohens statement and nothing in it was new. Everything as reprehensible as it might be is not an impeachable offense. Cohen vindicated him on Russia in what I read.
@AOC If that’s your response Ms. Cortez, I think you missed the context of what @IvankaTrump was trying to say. Meaning most don’t want “hand outs,” and would prefer to “earn” the amount of money they are entitled to by hard work, and contribution to something.
@ChuckCallesto No. Nope. Absolutely not. The electoral college is necessary so that the voices of the big city don’t drown out the needs of middle and small America.
@ZachG932 That’s because they don’t understand the importance of free speech. They reap the benefits of the America built by our ancestors and don’t recognize that it was due in large part to. free speech. The ability to speak and be heard and not be shot dead for it is a gift.

When I originally heard the @JussieSmollett story it was sketchy. As the story unfolded we learned how fantastical it was. We have learned a very valuable lesson in this. We can’t immediately overreact to a story. We can’t be so desirable to push an agenda until facts are known.

I’ve owned a gun for 17 years and never played with it like a toy. I’ve avoided shootings myself and others. My kid doesn’t even know I own one.

@_carl_marks_ I’m not against paying minimum wage. But thinking all businesses have the same operating cost and profit and lost structures is simplistic. My wife’s healthcare company takes in over $10 billion. They’re profits are actually only $100k after it’s all said and done.
@_carl_marks_ What’s enough to live? Because it’s actually not $15 an hour where I live. It’s actually much higher. Average wage across US is $24.57. My company raised the base salary of all hourly employees. We didn’t need government policy to do it. 1/2

@_carl_marks_ Lol! Cutesy fetishization. It’s a legitimate concern of certain types of businesses due to the nature of their work, that they can’t afford this. Every local shop isn’t a multinational. Some people sometimes need to work 2 jobs to make ends meet. 1/2
@Right_Smarts Thanks a lot!
@SenSanders What’s about small businesses and mom and pop shops that can’t afford this? Will there be government support to fill the gaps or should everyone shift to private contract relationships which might be an inevitable response to forced minimum wage nearly doubling in a short span?

@QuinnTSential @ABC I think it’ll probably be a total of her minimum but I’m sure she can do the 8 months, no longer needing to worry about spending another 36 years in prison. We can’t change the past, but she now has the opportunity to build a great future for herself.

@kewc_mom @xan_desanctis @benshapiro I guess the problem is that there could never be a one size fits all solution to the issue. I do think the other question is to what degree should people be able to intervene in natural processes of life development and death. I’m glad we could exchange ideas.
@kewc_mom @xan_desanctis @benshapiro This is true. Again, this is the complexity of the issue. That’s why I tried to articulate the perspective of my support. I think conditions that puts the mother’s life in danger would warrant intervention and termination of the fetus.
@kewc_mom @xan_desanctis @benshapiro So trying to correlate the absence of brain function in a fetus I think is inappropriate when discussing abortions compared to developed living beings no longer in utero
@kewc_mom @xan_desanctis @benshapiro I think one deals conception, birth, and a definitive sign of life in fetuses prior to the development of the brain, and the other deals with living beings who have been born and once had brain function and no longer does. The brain isn’t fully developed until adulthood.
@Ocasio2018 I think the word “giving” is wrong the way it is continually being used and doesn’t represent the true nuances of the deal. Whether it’s a good deal or not is not what I’m arguing. Read the article in my previous comment before you guys cut my head off.

@AdeKamilKelly The largest interventions for government should be safety. And they should be interventions where the government has the best historical track record. Economic management isn’t even one of them. People get tax returns because each year they take too much money.
@AdeKamilKelly Government’s real purpose is to defend the country from foreign invasion and to protect citizens from bodily and other harms of its fellow citizens. They added public education and we have one of the worse public education systems in the developed world.
@AdeKamilKelly Government intervention in business should be limited to regulation to prevent fraud, theft, foreign invasion of systems if not for the benefit of the country, and wages incrementally where applicable. All businesses aren’t the same and all aren’t Wal-Mart.

This is not to say that government doesn’t have a place in supporting the poor, sick, and handicapped. But there are and should continue to be limits to what the government should be interfering with. I don’t want them managing every facet of your life or mine.
The best antidotes for poverty are quality education, financial literacy, good money management behavior, good decision making around intimate relationships, not having children before you are financially capable of providing, saving, investing and food diet. Not government.
@CNN The government needs to stop trying to interfere with free markets. The economic growth in the United States over our history was not due to government intervention in free markets. And when they raised the minimum wage years ago, minority unemployment went up.
@Kroninn @TIME Hmm...Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis might still take the cake IMHO, but there’s an argument to be had for Melania for sure lol.
@Greens_Politics @xan_desanctis @benshapiro Also to try and crystallize the support of my beliefs, I think abortion as a form of birth control is problematic as there are several ways to prevent pregnancy. I do also think there are circumstances when abortion could be warranted. It is a complex issue.
@Greens_Politics @xan_desanctis @benshapiro I think if someone is an adult, and has no chance of ever regaining cognitive function, or if they are fully conscious of a personal decision to end their own life and are not suffering with a mental health disorder, who am I to stop them.

Now America is reacting to Trump now that he is in office. I’m not surprised by anything he does wrong. He’s an old man.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost It’s why I never insult or denigrate anyone online. The discourse on television is already bad enough.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost No need. I think our conversation began on the wrong foot when you told me to look up a word. It was what I call a kind-insult as it lacked any derogatory or inflammatory words. You can never know a person by 1 Twitter comment.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Even if I was hardcore liberal hating republican I wouldn’t have voted for him, because he wasn’t a qualified candidate.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost I preferred Bernie Sanders over both of them but he lost the primary dude. Are you kidding.

@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Name the individuals I voted for that I mentioned who are against their interest. Particularly at the national level since this was a discussion that began about federal tax policy.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost No I don’t. And I have yet to do so. I actually give to causes like veterans, police, and fire that don’t allow for deductions. As well as Phil Murphy’s political campaign.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Are you even reading or trying to prove a point and change who I am through your Twitter feed.

Again, stop making comments about me when you know nothing about me.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Well no. I actually donate a good percentage of my dollars to cancer research, children’s hospitals, veterans, police, fire, organizations that serve youth in depressed communities like the city of Newark where I grew up.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Well I couldn’t since I’m not a resident of NY.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Remember the first work in assumption is ass, so when the umption portion of the word goes wrong, that’s all that you are left with. Funny that when I expressed my voting patterns, you shifted the topic to something irrelevant to it. Lol.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost But I didn’t purchase .15 of Bitcoin in early 2017. I was never interest in Bitcoin and invested $25 in it to show a friend who was interested in learning investing how the digital currency works. I invest in companies that pay dividends. And others with real growth potential.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost I did recently vote for some republican candidates in New Jersey’s recent election. And I also voted for some Democrats on the ticket as well. Does that make me someone who doesn’t care for the interest of others.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost I wonder since they’re all pretty liberal. Again inform me about my life.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost What are you talking about? How am I angry when you started the conversation insulting me. Does voting Kerry, Obama and Hillary, Cory Booker into senate and Mayor in Newark to this point make me conservative.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost I’m a conservative voter on this policy or that, a libertarian on this policy or that, and a liberal on this policy or that. I don’t fit neatly into 1 category or another because I’m a human being who’s not represented by a stereotypical label meant to associate me with 1 view.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost So now you’re making an assumption of my voting patterns. What does my comment to a reply on Twitter have to do with my views on political issues. And what exactly are my interests since you seem to know me better than I know myself.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost I’m not trying to force him to care.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Well he made a specific comment about people he’s familiar with in the moment and I agree with his opinion on the matter as it stands. A lot these folks aren’t looking to 2020 or 2023. They’re living in the moment. It’s why we’re in the state we’re in.
@SPeitsch @Alsullivan12 @washingtonpost Maybe I’ve just been lucky, but taxes haven’t personally affected my life in a negative way whether they were raised or lowered. And I’ve yet to scrape the 1%. Getting ever closer but not there yet.

@Lars_E11 @ABC What’s the lie? So if energy companies adjust their practices, and clean energy becomes a norm in the industry, and if carbon emissions are reduced that harm the environment, then deregulation could be seen as an appropriate measure.
@Lars_E11 @ABC So you think lower of me based on what? I think you have to take a step back and read my initial post. People let their hatred and disdain for trump cloud their judgment on a statement that had nothing to do with trump. And everything to do with people and the environment.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Enjoy
@locherre @JohnCornyn @tedcruz I agree. Politicians more often do what’s categorically in their best interest to prolong their careers. My general stance is to focus on my life and the things I can control. And I adjust as legislation is written.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight But Trump’s personally and ideaology weren’t a part of my question. It wasn’t about racism or bigotry. It was about whether or not Americans have the expectation of him to do with the Saudis what no other president before him failed to do, despite Saudi crimes.
@Lars_E11 @ABC If you read the article, the EPA chairman agreed with Trump’s statement. He supported his claim. https://t.co/cfmOJOg6Oo
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight It would be. That’s a part of the thing they called diplomatic immunity. If they commit a crime on US soil and not in an embassy, it’s a different story. Our embassies are sovereign land in other foreign countries.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight So you took my questioning of people having an expectation of Trump’s behavior as defending him. You should read my original statement again without judgment of me being black or about your “feelings,” about him.
@locherre @JohnCornyn @tedcruz True. So what’s the solution? If he’s impeached and resigns you get Mike Pence for two years. What would the the demonstrable difference. An impeachment would also take two years to organize and run through so he’ll finish the term anyway.
@Lars_E11 @ABC Not defensive. You mentioned trump lying. Which had nothing to do with my post. Also, of course it doesn’t make sense. But if the rate of dangerous emissions are down according to the EPA, what’s the problem?
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight I never said it didn’t. Again. You are making assumptions.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Of course not. But an embassy is Soveriegn ground and therefore when he was in the embassy, he was officially in Saudi Arabia. Working in America doesn’t make him an American citizen though.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Mayor of Atlanta is black. 54% of the Atlanta population is black and the city council is majority black. Clearly blacks are voting for blacks in Atlanta. 60# of the state is white. And Georgia as a state has leaned republican since 1996.
@Lars_E11 @ABC Despite my vote against him, some of his policy have worked. I can’t sit back and say they haven’t and being honest about that doesn’t make me a Trump supporter.
@Lars_E11 @ABC I never said it did make sense. I addressed the issue of who gets the credit if dangerous emissions are down. Donald Trump has horrible rhetoric, which was a large part of why I didn’t vote for him. His flip flopping was unacceptable. So I didn’t vote for him.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight I didn’t defend him. I asked why is he expected to change course on the Saudis when no other president that preceded him has. This isn’t the first time they’ve killed one of their citizens. Secondly, was does me being black have to do with objectivity.
Discussing politics online these last two days has been interesting.
What happened to Jamal Khasshogi was terrible. Yet, I don’t see why people think he was an American citizen. This was a Saudi citizen who moved to America in 2017, who happened to speak out against certain issues in his country, and was killed in his country’s embassy in Turkey.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight So what does a Saudi government killing a Saudi citizen in Turkey have to do with America? What American citizens has the Saudi government killed.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight But I’ve voted in every election I’ve decided to vote in. If people want to vote, they can vote. I’ve seen many black people make the decision not to vote. I’ve never seen whites people or politicians in the black community of Newark, NJ I grew up in Stop people from voting
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Well since I voted for Hilary Clinton, that assumption is pretty ridiculous
@ABC I think the problem is we focus too much on which administration gets the credit. Let’s just do what’s best for the country and the environment for our long term good. Whatever gets companies to do what’s right. Whether that be appropriate regulation and appropriate deregulation.

@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Then vote. You can also run for office. You could also present legislation to your representative. You could start an organization, among other things. I do agree that the party system is problematic. We are on the same page there.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight Europe isn’t a country it’s a continent that encompasses several countries. Secondly, our alliances with Mexico and Canada are still intact. Firstly you used the word destroyed. Now you say alienated. Those are two different things.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight I do get politics. I never said it should be ignored. You draw conclusions based on your feelings. The US has always had the largest oil reserves. We’ve always had other energy sources. And if you think oil is the only reason for the Saudi relationship, look again.

@business Quite interesting.
@locherre @JohnCornyn @tedcruz Yes associates have entered guilty pleas. I don’t think there’s an absence of evidence. I just wonder if there is evidence sufficient enough to implicate Trump as an impeachable offense. If there is, are we saying Mueller presented it and no moves on it.
@azstudigital @ChaffinTravis @FoxNews This was unacceptable behavior on their part. Nancy shouldn’t have been treated that way. Calling her a communist went too far.
Immigration and border security remains a hot button issue. My stance is as a country, we must secure our borders. We do not have to grant asylum just because people want it. And no one should be able to force themselves into our country. #BorderPatrol #BorderWall
@ChaffinTravis @FoxNews Agreed
@seanhannity She won’t run again. Her time has come and gone.
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz I have yet to read or hear anything that Trump is yet impeachable for that’s grounded in facts. Mueller’s probe should have turned something up by now. Seems like it’ll drag on until 2020. If the evidence doesn’t exist, the proceeding is a waste of time.
@realDailyWire Bad correlation. Smh
@Nunyodamnbidniz @ABC So true.
@angelastahl10 @nytimes I see. Thx for that context. For me it’s just an app, so I apologize for my lack of knowledge.
@FreeThi85157297 @FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight You didn’t address anything I said. And last I checked, our relationships are still in place. Which relations specifically did he destroy?
@dim_giant @realDailyWire @benshapiro Ben’s views are conservative, but he’s also purely libertarian. If Rand runs again he’s likely to support the libertarian candidate, even though there’s slim chance that candidate will win. Thus, Trump support would not surprise. I don’t know that I see his influence as a concern
@AquaGrounded @nytimes No. They wouldn’t be able to get the images if they didn’t have the app.
