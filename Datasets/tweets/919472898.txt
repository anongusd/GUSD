@realDonaldTrump Border security and illegal immigration is an issue, a wall will not fix this. STOP the fear and hate mongering @GOP.  A good leader listens to good advisers (pretty sure they all left now)  and reads (maybe you can have them read to you).  You work for all Americans not just GOP

@realDonaldTrump Stop your nonsense and hate mongering.  Try to educate yourself about history, quote facts, listen to good advisers (oh they left). The only way you will make it to 2020 is by acting presidential.  Personally I do not think you will make it and do not believe you are capable.

@SethAbramson trump university?
@politico Does it even matter at this point what Mueller uncovers further?.  I would think America would want a president that 1. won it fairly 2.  puts the well being of the country before their own 3. Does not lie and has nothing to hide. 4. Acts appropriately

@ProudResister well is safer than many of your guns tbh.  One is supposed to be banned from warfare, and your @POTUS  felt that is ok to use on those seeking asylum, women and children.  @POTUS is right...since he took office the world is a very very dangerous place. Sorry USA, RIP ally
