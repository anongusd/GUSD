In most every meeting, Kansans have acknowledged the contentious nature of politics today &amp; I felt this tension during many of my Listening Tour stops. All across the state, I heard from Kansans, who agreed and disagreed with me, about the issues most important to them.
Throughout this Congress, I have crisscrossed the 82,000+ square miles of our state, holding townhall meetings in all 105 Kansas counties. Today, I brought my Kansas Listening Tour for this Congress to a close with my Allen County townhall meeting in Moran, Kan. https://t.co/gEPuKWgGi9

My statement on Judge Kavanaugh: https://t.co/xxXGxveQ3f
‚úàImproving child safety on commercial airlines. Legislation I championed is included in #FAAReauthorization, directing the FAA to review and update the contents of emergency medical kids on planes ‚Äì something that hasn‚Äôt been done in almost 20 years.
‚úàHighlighting the need for talented women in the aviation workforce and making certain the FAA facilitates their recruitment. Women comprise only 4% of flight engineers, 6% of pilots &amp; 26% of air traffic controllers ‚Äì a significant untapped pool of talent for the industry.
‚úàPreserving the Contract Weather Observers program. In recent years, the FAA has proposed eliminating the CWO program at airports such as @FlyICT. I‚Äôve fought against elimination of the CWO program to preserve the highest levels of safety at airports.
‚úàIncreasing fairness &amp; reducing regulation for general aviation projects.
‚úàReauthorizing the FAA‚Äôs Essential Air Service Program, which connects rural airports to the national system. Kansas airports currently participating in the EAS program include @GCKAirport, @FlyHays and @SalinaAirport. This bill reauthorizes the EAS program for five years.
‚úàThe ability to build or replace contract towers and secure needed equipment to help enhance air traffic safety at Kansas airports, such as @FlyMHK and @HutchGov.
‚úàStrengthening the Federal Contract Tower Program. Kansas is home to eight contract air traffic control towers, which provide important safety services at small airports nationwide in a cost-effective manner ‚Äì saving the FAA approximately $200 million annually.
‚úàEstablishing fair treatment of UAS by tribal governments. The #FAAReauthorization Act amends the definition of ‚Äúpublic aircraft‚Äù to include Unmanned Aircraft Systems that are owned and operated by a tribal government.
‚úàAcceleration of the safe integration of UAS technology. In May, @USDOT announced that @KDOTHQ was a winner of its UAS Integration Pilot Program. The IPP is a solid path forward to address airspace sovereignty &amp; included in this bill is my language to codify &amp; expand the IPP.
‚úàReducing regulatory barriers for educational use of drones. Last Congress, I was the co-lead of legislation to reduce barriers for the use of small unmanned aerial systems at institutes of higher education.
‚úàHelping to close the skills gap in the aviation workforce. I am an original cosponsor of legislation, included in the FAA bill in its entirety, to create a pilot program within the FAA through which grants would be authorized to support technical and career education.
‚úàSupporting advanced materials research at @WichitaState that has played a critical role in the evolution and integration of aircraft materials and technologies by continuing the FAA Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials at WSU.
‚úàBolstering aviation manufacturing by streamlining the aircraft certification process. These reforms will strengthen U.S. aviation sales and exports, help bring new safety technology to market and better utilize FAA and general aviation industry resources.
Yesterday, the Senate passed a long-term #FAAReauthorization that will create stability for Kansans who work in the aviation industry and improve air travel for all Americans. I‚Äôm proud this bill includes many provisions I worked for, including: https://t.co/z4SEOLTSU3

Not only does this #FAAReauthorization elevate the over 40,000 Kansans who make a living manufacturing, operating and servicing the aircraft industry, but it includes important provisions I championed to close the aviation skills gap and to bring more women into this field.
After years of negotiations, this long-term, bipartisan and bicameral #FAAReauthorization is welcome news for travelers, aerospace manufacturers and industry innovators. https://t.co/M2oFlNZIWw

Thank you for those who watched the #LandonLecture. As I stated in my remarks, I‚Äôm committed to making certain we #NeverForget 9/11 and how it refocused us as a nation on the things that bind us together rather than pull us apart. God Bless America today and everyday.
May we #NeverForget September 11th, 2001. May we Never Forget the way we united in the aftermath of the attacks, as one nation under God. And may we renew our commitment to respecting one another, to working together for the common good and answering the call to serve.
As I stood next to a New York City congressman from Brooklyn, we saw a nation under attack. While we disagree with each other more often than not, as we stood there, we saw each other as fathers, not foes; fellow Americans, not political enemies. #LandonLecture
Her concern for me on that day and her efforts to make sure it was she who told our daughters their father was safe, rather than the television, is representative of a larger sacrifice that my family has made in order for me to continue to answer the calls of many. #LandonLecture
One of the most important calls I took that day was from my wife, Robba. Before widely used cell phones, texting and email, she had no way to reach me besides calling my main office line.
I felt the care and compassion of Kansans in ways that I had not before, and I am forever changed. #LandonLecture
On this day, the most frightening day our nation has seen in this lifetime, Kansans chose to pick up the phone and offer their assistance, their thoughts and their prayers.
Earlier, I spoke about remaining in my office and answering Kansans‚Äô telephone calls on September 11th.		Now, let me tell you what Kansans called to say: they called to ask how they could support their fellow Americans, how they could help.
As we now reflect on Senator McCain‚Äôs vast contributions to our nation, I intend to continue advancing his work and making certain veterans are treated with the dignity and respect they have earned and that they receive the benefits they were promised. #LandonLecture
The world recently mourned the passing of my friend Senator John McCain. He was an honorable man and exemplified what it means to be a great American. He used his bully-pulpit for good and allowed the injustices he‚Äôd seen throughout his life to guide his work. #LandonLecture
For as long as I‚Äôve been in Congress, I‚Äôve been explaining, ‚Äúwhere I come from, economic development can often be whether or not there is a grocery store in town.‚Äù #LandonLecture

I hope today to convey to the students in this room ‚Äì to the next generation of engineers, mathematicians, pilots, astronauts, scientists ‚Äì Kansas needs you. #LandonLecture
From drones to NBAF and everything in-between, industry and research need young people, and young people need opportunities. #LandonLecture
Plain and simple: Canadian and Mexican markets are vital to our state and both countries need to be part of a final NAFTA agreement. #LandonLecture
We ought to continue working to improve pre-existing trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, and re-engaging in others, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. #LandonLecture
Tough enforcement of trade rules is a good idea, especially when it comes to dealing with China, but a trade war is not. #LandonLecture
But I‚Äôm also going to discuss how we should ‚Äúnever forget‚Äù how we came together as a country to help one another after that horrific day 17 years ago. #LandonLecture
Today, I am going to speak to you about how 9/11 changed me as a legislator and the issues I have been called to help solve in order to make a difference in Kansas and our country. #LandonLecture
determined to tackle every problem I could, to seize every moment of every day to fight for not only those who were sent into harm‚Äôs way, but for our farmers, our ranchers, our teachers, our veterans, and our way of life. #LandonLecture
As Kansans returned to work and profoundly demonstrated that they would not be held hostage by fear, I returned to work as your representative with a new fire, a new passion and a new sense of purpose,
In a new way, I had a duty not only to preserve the Kansas way of life that I cared so much about, but the American way of life. #LandonLecture
This day 17 years ago changed me ‚Äì the way I viewed public service and advocated for Kansans and our country. It broadened my prospective and deepened my resolve. #LandonLecture

Any further escalation of the trade dispute with China that results in more tariffs will only cause harm to families, farmers, manufacturers, workers, consumers and businesses ‚Äì the very people and industries that USTR is supposed to help succeed.
The tactics we see now ‚Äì where the United States imposes tariffs, China responds, the United States threatens more tariffs, China responds and so forth ‚Äì appear to have gotten China‚Äôs attention, but more tariffs cannot be the ultimate answer.

Putin is not our friend; he‚Äôs an adversary intent on continuing Russia‚Äôs disruptive activities, including meddling in our own democratic process.

Tariffs not only hurt our farmers, ranchers and airplane manufacturers, but they also harm every American consumer. We should be working with our allies to isolate China rather than escalate a trade war.

1‚É£2‚É£ We‚Äôre working hard to foster innovation within the VA. This bill creates the VA Center for Innovation, allowing the VA to develop and carry out pilot programs to explore innovative approaches to improving care, access to care and cost of care to better assist our veterans. https://t.co/PrEvACFjBz
1‚É£1‚É£ The VA is known as a high-quality provider of telemedicine, but the opportunity to expand that ‚Äì especially for rural veterans or veterans needing specialty care ‚Äì is one that I am pleased we incorporated into the #VAMISSIONAct. https://t.co/9NrpI8klmk
üîü The #VAMISSIONAct provides additional funds to maintain the Veterans' Choice Program during the development and implementation of the new Community Care Program and removes the barrier between Choice-specific funds and other community care funds. https://t.co/08JN9HUCec
9‚É£ Walk-in care is becoming more common. This legislation allows our veterans to receive care from local walk-in clinics, convenient-care clinics &amp; federally-funded health centers, giving veterans the same access to non-emergent convenience care in the community as non-veterans. https://t.co/yZwcqIAuQt
8‚É£ Representing a rural state, I am pleased the #VAMISSIONAct requires community care be paid for at critical access hospital designation Medicare rates, encouraging our rural hospitals to accept veterans into their community care program. More information ‚Üì https://t.co/n6XHL2uvvm
7‚É£ #VAMISSIONAct requires market area assessments to determine where VA care is available in the community &amp; where it excels. These assessments will provide Congress a better understanding of redundancies &amp; what kind of care is in the best interest of the veteran. https://t.co/kkzLpIsMyV
6‚É£ Too often veterans must return to the VA every time they need treatment stemming from the original purpose of seeking care in the community. This legislation cuts red tape by making certain an entire episode of care is treated to completion in the community. More ‚Üì https://t.co/dX3CVzZYac
5‚É£ Veterans will now have the ability to appeal a decision made by the VA if they believe their VA provider is wrongly denying them access to community care ‚Äì giving the veteran an additional option for recourse and putting their care decisions back in their own hands. https://t.co/Et9GF0WHej
4‚É£ The #VAMISSIONAct reforms community care eligibility ‚Äì a big win for veterans. This legislation replaces the existing, arbitrary 30-day/40-mile eligibility requirements with simply what is in the best interest of the veteran. https://t.co/DejwUqWfvS
3‚É£ This legislation requires the VA to provide veterans a coordinator of care when they choose to utilize care in their community to ensure continuity of care and service in a timely manner, making it easier for a veteran to receive the care they need. https://t.co/pB79tmTfqI
2‚É£ There are seven different community care programs within the VA where veterans can access care outside of the VA. These programs are consolidated into one under the #VAMISSIONAct, reducing bureaucracy and making the program easier for veterans and their providers. https://t.co/NDbkVtplTT
1‚É£ #VAMISSIONAct makes certain the VA executes the law consistent with the intent of Congress as it develops rules &amp; regulations to govern the new Choice program ‚Äì preventing the VA from narrowing &amp; limiting the program's ability to serve veterans as we intend &amp; they deserve. https://t.co/RXtcTlaUh4

This is a tough job and the VA needs strong leadership. The VA &amp; members of Congress must be singularly focused on prioritizing veterans above all else, moving quickly to pass Choice reform and upholding an unquestionable commitment to service and providing quality care.

While we appreciate the efforts by USOC to establish the US Center for Safe Sport, it is obvious that additional measures need to be taken to prevent similarly heinous crimes from occurring in the future, while ensuring appropriate reporting in the unfortunate event that they do.
Of particular concern is the recent allegation that @USAGym actively sought to silence at least one Olympic gymnast with a non-disclosure agreement. @SenBlumenthal &amp; I want to know: How was this justified? Who was aware of this NDA? Is this common practice?
Larry Nassar‚Äôs despicable actions are well documented; however, recent revelations from his sentencing hearings provide ample evidence that @USAGym &amp; @michiganstateu were negligent in acting on reports of this abuse.
