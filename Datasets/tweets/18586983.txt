Also not for nothing, one of the things I LIKED about Claire McCaskill was that ‚Äúself-effacing‚Äù was not an adjective you could apply to her.
In fact, all it does is erase their hard work if young women are forced to keep playing with one hand tied behind their back, backwards and in high heels. 		The point of progress is to make it easier for the next gen, not to tell them to hamstring themselves because you had to.
We‚Äôre finally seeing women run (and win!) as fully realized human beings with rage and flaws and everything. 		I have loads of respect for the women who first broke down barriers, but what they did was change the old rules. We don‚Äôt have to play by them anymore.

Forget American (of course it isn't American), what this administration is doing to children isn't *human*. And we will fight it with the kind of love that makes us spend weekdays calling representatives, weekends marching, and nights wide awake.
If I'm right about what being human means, there are millions of heartsick Americans this morning who can feel the pain and fear of these thousands of confused and frightened children at our border ‚Äî alone in cages, or running from poison gas.
I don't spend a lot of time talking to people about this impulse, because I assume it's a totally shared part of being human.
I don't even have children, but if there's a little one in my world, in my home, even on my subway car, I want to make sure they're safe. (And if appropriate/possible, I want to make them laugh.)

A caravan of dangerous invaders is the only thing they can think of to justify the inhuman way they‚Äôve treated families hoping for a better life in America. 		All we can hope is that enough people see through the lie in the next week.
That‚Äôs how you wind up with this truly bonkers caravan conspiracy theory 7 days out from an election, and why they‚Äôre so locked into it.
Republicans know the suburban moms they need to win abhor family separation. The only way they can think to justify it is to tell even bigger lies to demonize immigrants.
I actually agree that there‚Äôs a crisis on the southern border, I just understand that crisis is the fact that there are children in cages.

@ZerlinaMaxwell STOP THE RIDE I WANNA GET OFF
I admit I fell for the same kind of line as a woman, we all have to unpack what we've been taught. 		https://t.co/ectV7m2cuk
And yet the Totally Normal Guy Who Somehow Finds Himself With Multiple Credible Accusations Of Assault is a character we see over and over again.		It‚Äôs time for men to see through the bullshit.
The truth is, men are more likely to be survivors of sexual assault then they are to be falsely accused of it. But because our society so thoroughly defines victims as women (men get to be heroes or villains, but not victims), those men are completely erased.
And that closes the loop for the power structures that make sure rich, white, sexual predators stay at the top.
So what does that mean for all of you men, when you hear the story of a long-ago assault on a teenage girl? You‚Äôre definitely not the Christine Ford in this situation, so you must be the Brett Kavanaugh.
You avoided anything that hinted at feminization, because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been taught is the fastest way to lose the respect of other men.		Put simply, you‚Äôve never been taught to identify with women. You‚Äôve been explicitly taught not to.
You‚Äôve been socialized from as young as you can remember not to identify with women. You didn‚Äôt read books with girl heroes as a kid. You never played the female characters in video games.
Even though it ends with an action outside of your own experience (holding your hand over a girl‚Äôs mouth so she can‚Äôt scream while you try to take her clothes off), you‚Äôve been listening to this insidious ‚ÄòYes All Men‚Äô thing for long enough you think it‚Äôs partly your story too.
So when a Kavanaugh-like situation comes up ‚Äîwith one of those stories that starts with a plot you know from your own life (a drunk summer party with beer and girls and loud music)‚Äî you start to think maybe what‚Äôs about to follow has some bearing on your own behavior.
‚ÄúBoys will be boys.‚Äù You hear it so often that you start to believe it.
You hear it from all corners: Men need to be afraid all the time now, you could be accused at any hour, for any infraction, including sexual assault. Normal teenage hijinks will destroy your life if women are allowed to rewrite the rules.
Part of the way that white male supremacy continues to perpetuate itself is by making every man feel complicit, in the same way that women internalize sexism and cut down other women.
I believe men are justly horrified that a man accused of assault has been nominated by a man who‚Äôs admitted to it.		I think they just don‚Äôt know what to do about it.
I wrote something for men about the #StopKavanaugh fight. It's about the lies men are told by patriarchy and how it makes you think you're complicit. It's about identifying with women and seeing through the bullshit. 		https://t.co/ectV7m2cuk

Lifetime appointments to the court should be reserved for presidents who got here legally. #StopKavanaugh
Red and blue states all need to hear from us. This needs to be a wave of historic proportions. But we can do that.
Get creative! One Planned Parenthood rep on the Rise Up for Roe tour told a story about a hairdresser in Minnesota who gave 10 percent discounts to clients who filled out a pre-addressed postcard to send to their senators; she ended up collecting thousands.
It won‚Äôt be enough if just you do it, so pull five people in your network along with you. (And if you have anyone in your network in Maine or Alaska, this is now your full-time job.)
Recruit your friends, your family, and your coworkers. Hearings are scheduled to start September 4th, and those senators need to feel the pressure of millions of American women telling them no.
Call your senators and demand they stand up to Donald Trump and fight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. We win when we flood the phone lines ‚Äî we‚Äôve done it before when health care was on the line, and now, the stakes are even higher.
And tell your friends! Tell everyone why you‚Äôre standing up for women and democracy using #StopKavanaugh. Then, get on the phone. Every day. A couple times a day if you can.
Second, show up. Start on Sunday, August 26th, when Americans in every city will join a massive National Day of Action sponsored by NARAL, Move On, Demand Justice, Planned Parenthood, and more. RSVP to an action near you at https://t.co/0M406dWrmD.
So how do we avoid this apocalyptic reality? First, remember that Brett Kavanaugh has the lowest approval rating of any nominee in history. Only 15 percent of Americans support his confirmation. That means there are more of us than there are of them.
Even if we take back Congress and the White House and start passing legislation like Medicare for all, those kinds of sweeping laws (Obamacare, marriage equality, school integration, affirmative action) generally make their way to the Supreme Court where they will die.
They will decimate voting rights, immigrant rights, and workers‚Äô rights ‚Äî and they will repeal Obamacare. They will keep us from ever digging ourselves out of this racist, misogynist bullshit our country is mired in, and from making any progress.
It‚Äôs tough to see past abortion sometimes ‚Äî but a Supreme Court justice touches everything. If Kavanaugh is seated, the Supreme Court will immediately adopt a 5-4 conservative tilt, with the most right-wing justices we‚Äôve had in over a century.
So, those are the stakes. State-forced childbirth is lethal, immoral, and would be a massive contribution to discrimination and inequality. Plus, I have a hard time finding a bigger economic issue than my ability to make the decision when and whether to become a mother.
Before the Roe decision in 1973, 90 percent of the people who died from unsafe abortions in New York City were black and brown. We will begin returning to that reality if Brett Kavanaugh is seated.
If that happens, abortions will continue, only they will no longer be safe and legal and people will die. It will begin with poor women, women of color, women with mental health issues, and any person with a uterus already in a marginalized community who are already targeted.
One in 4 American women has had an abortion. That means either you, or someone you love dearly, has had an abortion. If Kavanaugh is seated, the Court will immediately begin gutting our rights to abortion care, with the ultimate goal of criminalizing abortion in this country.
All we have to do is mobilize. All of us. But first, let‚Äôs talk about why it‚Äôs so important.
We absolutely can stop Kavanaugh. A president who broke the law to win the White House shouldn‚Äôt be appointing lifetime judges for those of us who, you know, got where we are legally.
Hundreds of people showed up in cities from Los Angeles, California to Portland, Maine, proving that they hadn‚Äôt bought the lie that there is nothing we can do to stop Donald Trump from giving a far-right extremist a lifetime appointment to our nation‚Äôs highest court.
Friends and friends of anyone with a uterus!		I‚Äôve been state-hopping all over the country as part of the Rise Up for Roe tour (Mission: #StopKavanaugh and save your right to bodily autonomy) and I gotta say, I came home ridiculously inspired.		https://t.co/D81T3cyoKz
