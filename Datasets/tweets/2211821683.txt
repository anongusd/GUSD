I understand these dogs are tools for you but I wouldn’t consider what I saw discipline. I don’t treat my lab the same way I just saw that officer treat his. Can you talk to the officer about it?

@ChrisDaniels5 Pulitzer Worthy Journalism
Either Edgar HOF is gaining traction or my Twitter is caught too deep into the echo chamber that is Seattle
Any idea @ChrisDaniels5 who owns the future naming rights for #KeyArena? Any chance we see it return to the Seattle Center Coliseum?
The year is 2035:		Seattle Center has a renovated #KeyArena with an #NHL Team, the Seattle Storm and Light Rail		SoDo has the Hansen Arena and the Sonics 		...the Mariners miss the playoffs for the 34th consecutive season
@TheoProctor It’s going to turn a City owned building that was losing money (wasting your taxes) into a revenue producing venue (no longer wasting your taxes). I do agree losing the skate park sucks though!
@anpsince83 The difference is that the city already owns this failing asset (Key) and a private renovation is a good thing because no matter what Key Arena is staying there. It will be continually used for concerts. A renovated Key that is profitable for concerts is better than current Key
@blykmyk44 @Josh_Bircher @ChrisDaniels5 Bro she literally shows the binders and notebooks full of pages worth of research she did! What more do you need? A livestream of her reading out loud?

Wow @ChrisDaniels5 this piece completely changed my strong held opinion about Key Arena vs SODO plans. I loved @D5Juarez’s passion for it and I think she did an outstanding job being tough.

@Jesse_Bowers 50 games is way too big a sample size. If he was on the chopping block he'd be out in 15 games as soon as Miller can play OF
@Jesse_Bowers True, he's been good at D and we don't have anybody in AAA that could replace him. That's why Miller has been moved at OF
@Jesse_Bowers I'm not saying he's a great player, but to say he's on the chopping block is plain wrong.
