@nytimes Or include the idea that extending Medicaid to the poor, or reaching out to constituencies that have for generations been left out of political processes (and might indeed have been gerrymandered and voter suppressed out of them) might also constitute a political center?
@nytimes Can political moderation not also include the assertion that after centuries, it is indeed a reasonable and tepid political idea to select an other-than-white-man to lead a government?
@nytimes That within any of the constituencies of a 'political base' are contrarians, whose views on any variety of topics may track in directions at tension with the political campaign.
@nytimes Nor does it recognize, that political moderation is less a set of coherent political beliefs than norms and ideas about how to publicly speak on and engage political ideas, (and increasingly in this environment of raised nationalist sentiment, ideas about whom is permitted to).
@nytimes Never mind that political moderation, here, is never clearly defined nor does the writer demonstrate how moderation in the American South might represent anything other than a select focus on growing a local economy as currently constituted.
