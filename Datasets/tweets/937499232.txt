These steps should be supported by new funding. As my fellow education advocate @PeaceAyo2 said in her #CHOGM18 speech: "Girls have fantastic dreams for our futures, but we can only achieve them if leaders invest in 12 years of free, safe, quality education."
Last month I challenged Commonwealth leaders to commit to girls' education. I'm happy today's #CHOGM18 communiqué affirms the importance of 12 years of education for all girls and that the UK signed the Safe Schools Declaration to protect students from violence.
Encouraged by UK’s commitment to put 12 years of free, safe, quality education for girls at the heart of the #CHOGM18 agenda today. I hope all #Commonwealth leaders will back this ambition with funding commitments.
