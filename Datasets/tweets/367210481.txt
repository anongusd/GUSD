@madamefang I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. I'm glad you have your kittehs to be there with you &amp; keep you company and entertained.
@madamefang FLOOF!!! Looks like us! lol. We all curl up together. I get 2 heating pads and 5 kittehs too. Look at the cuddle bugs. So comfy. Makes me want to go home and crash 🐱
@madamefang Yes, I'd be lost without mine too and they do understand. It'd be nice to have someone around. I'm still strong but whatever I do causes horrible pain after but since the kittehs &amp; pups can't help we do what we have 2 &amp; pay 4 it after.  Critters sure are blessings for us.
@madamefang I get to work whenever I make it. Thankfully, she told me it's no big deal. I still put in about 85 a period. It won't last forever but I want the insurance. My kittehs call me the hoomin heating pad. lol I'm super slow too. More so when it's cold.
@madamefang It's why I complained today. I have an unreal amount of stress. I don't sleep, etc. so when crap like this happens, I don't like it. LOL If this was all we had going on it'd be no big deal but the load our bodies bear is unreal
@madamefang Awhh, don't cuss it. It's like it's fighting itself &amp; stuck in a loop. If our minds could figure out how to intercept the loop or stop it. I think we're badasses. I don't know 1 person who could live/work like I do. Not 1. We are superbad!!
@madamefang I do now!!! 🤣 I plan to order some Friday (like I need more) I order most of mine of Ebay or go to Hobby Lobby. This will be a new addition!!
@madamefang My friend bought me one 4 Xmas. I can't use it 😢 vibrates plate in my neck &amp; elsewhere I overload releasing lactic acid. I'm a mess. LMAO I use neck &amp; back heating pads so much so I have 2 degree burns. Had cupping &amp; acu done 1x &amp; Dr was floored. We do what it takes to survive.
@madamefang I'm so sorry. I'm kind of in the same boat. It seems our minds work more and body laughs and laughs &amp; says...you'll pay and we do 10 fold.
@madamefang Suhweet!! Thank you!!  I bought a boatload of beads the past couple weeks. Just finished a couple necklaces over the weekend. My problem is severe pain in my neck &amp; back but I want the dern things done so 4 hrs later I finish &amp; can't move the next day 🤣 Do you make stuff too?

@process_x @StopBadDocs topical arthritis cream has helped some, spearmint, lavender, peppermint. They say when it's something that doesn't smell good, you may need it? I have a tea tree/lavender I bought. Hated it but used it. Me &amp; my critters are relaxed when I put a drop or 2 on the pillows 🐱
@process_x @StopBadDocs I understand :)  research (look on WebMD) &amp; check with health food stores. Supplements for pain or  nerve pain-B12&amp;6, Vit E, Corydalis, Magnesium/Zinc/D, Potassium, ALA/ALC. Some I can take, others I can't. I took Zinc/Mag?d &amp; Pott for years. I know when I'm not taking it.
@process_x @StopBadDocs That's horrible! He needs to go away! I'm sorry you went through that. I'm glad they saw through his lies

@DrNickels It will close a lot of smaller clinics as doctors are unable to provide services based on Medicare's fees schedule. For dental, in most cases they pay 30%, the rest is written off (meaning it can't be collected) 30% doesn't cover the supplies, staff, etc.

@catswithnohope I can't figure out how so many have that. my Herbie had his broken at one time. it healed up but it hangs and swings when he runs. it doesn't bother him. the solution will help keep them clean and heal
@catswithnohope It may be infected. hopefully it'll break open so the infection oozes out. my outdoor toms get that alot

@MightyNeck Oh yeah! Love that picture!! I watch him &amp; have to think he was tokin up during filming. it cracks me up. Back then it was scandal. Today-meh. He'd be laughing he's no longer that rebel. He'd live in Co/WA, etc Go back to film 🤣. He didn't give a damn. he was fantastic!!

@catswithnohope Something else that would calm her down is lavender oil (essential oil) if you have access to it. Put it on something near her. I have to put it on a towel one of mine sleeps near. He likes to raise the roof all night if I don't use some.
@Micailic0Mica @catswithnohope I agree. It's 3 world. It's sad. I think she'll be fine once she calms down. I bet the anesthesia also makes them mean and cranky. In the US, they won't let us take them until end of day and awake. (Exception to my Herbie)
@catswithnohope It might calm her down some.
@catswithnohope I had to wear a neck collar for 3 months. I was pissed &amp; had I a voice (didn't have one for 2 yrs) I'd have prolly yelled too. Just put her in her happy room, if you have an ipad or whatnot maybe try https://t.co/lSwlpPwvr5
@catswithnohope Will eventually calm down. If you can take her to the room she likes best and let her be. She may yell at you from hurting &amp; being mad but I'd keep her in it for several hours if possible? Give her her meds when needed. Then maybe tonite she if she's calmed some. Leave bandage on
@catswithnohope Is this the little one with a leg missing? For now, I'd leave her leg alone. She's had too much going on :) She probably won't need to potty until (OK I don't know the time there) 2 here but late tonight/early 2 morrow if she was held off food &amp; water. SHe's mad &amp; hurts but she
@catswithnohope https://t.co/pB6CCaziHf  It looks like in some places they do bandage.
@catswithnohope Still waiting for vet here to call. I'll ask about the bandage too. I'm guessing it is to keep her from splitting the sutures. I'm glad she's coming to. Did the vet there tell you to keep her in the kennel? Cats don't like to be in them sometimes. if she isn't throwing a fit-
@catswithnohope I'd also keep her off food (she may not be able to swallow correctly until tomorrow-what my vets told me) offer her tuna juice or water if she'll have it. Just going off what vets here said :)

@catswithnohope Is there a place where she won't jump? If she wants out, maybe let her? I don't like the bandage thing. If you have pain meds, give her some and maybe loosen it a tad? It's there to keep her from licking (I'm guessing) Can you get a call in to the vet?

@catswithnohope If you can't get vetricyn, google and see if you can make your own saline solution for her. It will keep it moist so the sutures don't pull on her &amp; cause pain. It aids in healing. I wish you had access to stuff for horses &amp; animals.
@catswithnohope OK good. It will take a while and could take all day but keep at it. It's scary but moving gets blood flowing and the anesthesia out. Keep talking happy and how proud you are and how she'll get noms, etc :) Make her feel good
@Elainebks @catswithnohope @BarryBleunNila2 Hi Elaine, it's your choice to believe &amp; donate or not. There are others you can donate to. Tammy is desperately trying to help animals there. If this video isn't convincing, nothing will. If you don't believe, that's on you but please don't bash.
@catswithnohope Sent you a msg. Keep moving her head, front paws, &amp; talking to her. Gets oxygen flowing in her blood &amp; anesthesia out. My boy Herbie had a reaction like this. Took 9 hrs for him to come to. Keep talking &amp; raising front paws &amp; head

@billnoesges @tcm I see movies today &amp; it makes me sad. There are few, if any standout actors. Back then there were so many with so much talent. The stories had substance. Wasn't special effects &amp; CGI. Both are amazing &amp; can make a film good but not like vintage. Noir my fav. Classic all the way
@billnoesges @tcm I agree :0) I'm lucky enough I can listen to it on the computer here at work, but man it's difficult. I so want to kick back and watch. Granted, I have all of them on DVD but it's cool to know there are others absorbed in the film at the same time.
