Some YA trends not only avoid this thematic heavy-lifting, they're spreading well-meaning but dangerous kinds of intolerance into Adult fiction.		That doesn't make for resilient readers...or citizens.
Some are recent winners of major literary &amp; genre fiction prizes.		Are they going to make some readers uncomfortable? Yep. Are they worth reading? Yep. 		Romance writers have figured out how to have the HEA and deep scrutiny of some heavy topics.
Let's take the topic of slavery. It's a dark stain upon Western civilization, but it's also going right now in many other cultures, in many forms.		Slavery also appears in many secondary-world books that aren't set on a historical or current Earth.
If a reader doesn't like the secondary world story they can stop reading the book.		They can write informed, coherent public criticism of the book. 		They should probably not pile onto the writer or stop the book from being published.
Even a YA book? I'm not sure, not even for teen readers. We were and are a resilient bunch. 		Not every experience postulated in a secondary-world fiction should be viewed solely as excusing its RW historical counterpart.		Lots is just storytelling.
Even worse, some secondary-world novels that I might have liked to read...are being pulled. Or not written. Or are rewritten with specific filters in mind. 		A book in real, historical settings SHOULD address those issues. 		Should a secondary-world book?
It split off from adult fare less than 2 decades ago. Many brilliant SFF books I loved as a teen are now repackaged as YA.		Especially in SFF, newer YA can seem to suffer from the Mamma Mia problem: safer, softer, less challenging.
Adult romance has grown up to embrace darker, heavier themes, to make the good endings even sweeter.		YA romance &amp; fantasy seem on the verge of denying all of that, in favor of preventing fearful &amp; triggery responses.		YA as a genre isn't very old.
He said something so cutting &amp; accurate that I have to paraphrase it:		Badly written chick-flicks shy from presenting comedy born of harsh conflict and character growth. They tend to infantilize the characters (and the audience).
As writers, it's our damn *job* to spin 'what-if' into stories. Sometimes very uncomfortable ones. I read LeGuin not only for Earthsea, but for Lathe Of Heaven &amp; Omelas.		Bear with me on a necessary digression. I watched the Nostalgia Critic rip 'Mamma Mia'.
Adult fantasy has long had secondary-worlds derived from &amp; riffed off of our reality. Or secondary worlds far divorced from ours. 		Some these are lame flops, and some win major awards and accolades.
What I *am* seeing is YA writers, critics, and Goodreads glitterati applying a narrow set of real-world concerns to secondary-world fantasy mms.		A setting can be inspired by RW cultures and histories, but morph to become its own thing.
Rightfully so, the historical purists got schooled recently by talented &amp; passionate writers of LGBTQIA 'alternate history romance).		I'm not really seeing that in YA fantasy &amp; romance yet. (I'm not a YA writer, so I'm probably just missing it.)
If I want a HEA that allows for two Regency gay guys or gals to be openly romantic without cultural backlash...that's alternate history.		It doesn't have to contain all the real-world fallout. Do a little research: hints abound of real gay couples.
Some romance authors have said HEA &amp; HFN in such settings aren't 'realistic' because the happy couple would be hiding their relationship for fear of cultural sanctions, if not outright murder.		In fantasy there is a thing called Alternate History.
But, yay, romance grew up and embraced its Inner Bonobo. Now we have all flavors &amp; genres of LGBTQIA romance (I'll get to the Ace part, I promise.)		One problem comes with LGBTQ romances set in documentedly unfriendly historical settings.
Rare LGBTQ 'romance' was decorously framed to hide in plain sight. Or total exploitation. No happy endings. There's even a trope: Kill Your Gays, on the benighted theory that gay &amp; NB characters only exist as object lessons with miserable, lonely endings.
That's 'Happy Ever After' and its companion 'Happy For Now' (HFN).		These kinds of endings are a must for romance readers. Without them, a book isn't a romance		In publishing history, heterosexual romance HEA &amp; HFN were the norm. For a couple of centuries.

Putin's ironic triumph: the same people once violently united by a hatred of 'Red Menace' are now happily flaunting Russian flags &amp; T-shirts at Trump rallies.		The two links are money and religion.
Trump is just one of many Vor tools &amp; money launderers. So are the Christian Homeschool Movement &amp; the NRA.		The Russian reasoning is similar to Hitler's pre-1939: white Christian solidarity would allow for separate but equal ethnostates.
Russia blames the fall of its Soviet empire not on its own incompetence, but on the US &amp; NATO.		Even before the 1st Dubya Administration, Putin's crowd was grooming corrupt Americans &amp; Europeans, with an eye toward destabilizing both the US &amp; NATO.
The US, led by greedy &amp; incompetent Republicans, squanders worldwide goodwill after 9-11.		Russia has the same problems it always had: inferiority complex, delusions of grandeur, and deep xenophobia. Too easy to blame the rest of the world.
Seriously, put yourself in Putin's place circa 2000. Russia is a joke economically, its resources being divided up by oligarchs. Poor &amp; working class lifespans going down. Superstition rising, egged on by the Russian Orthodox Church.

Social media &amp; basic research skills can show red flags when authors are sloppy &amp; greedy.		Readers can be aware of what they are reading &amp; how it impacts the genre. At the very least, don't excuse bad writing even if it has your favorite kink.
Overall romance genre quality might tank if the #cutpastecris writers drive off everyone else.		Romance is a juggernaut in publishing. It changes lives, both of its authors &amp; readers. I want to see it thrive.		Read only those who write their own work.
When y'all buy works from people like #cutpastecris you drive off other writers who try to play by the damn rules.		Those writers write less. Or they stop writing. (My day job pays the equivalent of 850 book sales a month. I'm happy to write for joy alone.)
Nor do I think *all* fast romance writers are bogus. Because many of you are awesome at your work, and I love that I can look forward to 3+ books a year from you.		Romance readerships have a sustainability problem they ignore in favor of quick, sloppy fixes.
There's a harsh reason. SFF Romance requires world building. Historical requires research. 		Contemporary fiction allows relatively easy cut-n-paste of plot, characters, setting descriptions, &amp; dialog lines.		I am NOT saying Contemporary Romance is easy.
I'd love to see authors take an #IWriteMyOwnWork pledge and *be held to it*. 		Contemporary Romance is especially plagued by ghostwriting, mirroring, bogus box sets, &amp; other quick-dollar schemes.
There are solutions. 		Amazon can fix its broken pay-by-page reads system.		Fiction authors can do their own damn work &amp; stop hiring ghostwriters.		Readers can stop fueling &amp; justifying the fast-fiction romance machine.
The recent fracas in Romancelandia just underscores how broken #IndiePublishing really is, esp involving Amazon Kindle.		#cutpastecris shows that stuffing, plagiarism, &amp; other shortcuts still drive the fast-fiction market.

I've mostly given up on local boutiques: too far away for easy stocking, not enough foot traffic, not enough sales at medium-high price points, wrong clientele for my art. 		Like Etsy, most local jewelry/craft   boutiques sell $50 or lower pieces.
So far, the best selling platform has been my SaatchiArt page, but craft and costume pieces aren't a good fit for SaatchiArt's fine art vibe.		I'm resisting spending $ on a direct Shopify store until I rebuild my website. Which also costs $.

@GarethCallaway @TonyAtamanuik @AOC I think we can mollify &amp; contain worst side effects while working on those three big problems.
@GarethCallaway @TonyAtamanuik @AOC Agreed.
2nd contractor friend lost 2 paychecks, fighting bank over a faulty mortgage. Credit drops in two more months if she can't get backpay, so she may lose house. That means higher rent (and lower credit rating means fewer rentable spaces open to her.)
Now his eyesight is fixed, he's on dialysis, and getting his brain back enough to work.		But his credit rating isn't perfect anymore, which means lower gov	security clearances. Which means even the civilian IT jobs he might get will be limited.
While unemployed, he suffered total kidney failure. Hospital, doctor bills ate up his retirement &amp; savings. 7 month wait in SSDI while he couldn't work. Cataracts blinded him. Unavoidable debt while we played hopscotch with payments.
KidneyGuy (whom many of you have helped me save) didn't know his kidneys were failing because of crap doctors pre-ACA. He lost two jobs because State of AZ &amp; a Scottsdale IT firm didn't listen when he kept saying he was sick.
Thread about what happened to some gov contractors I know when their credit rating went down.		One lost rating when his kidneys failed, before SSDI eligibility. Another may lose their modest house because of two missing paychecks from #TrumpShutdown.
@GarethCallaway @TonyAtamanuik @AOC Wholehearted agreement on healthcare.		But let's consider credit's effect on the ability rent in safe areas, buy a safe &amp; reliable car to get to a better job, or even *getting* that better job.
Because the Evangelicals only value brown babies if the latter can be brainwashed to be good little converts.		That means stealing them &amp; sending them to conservative Christian adoption agencies. https://t.co/7LGo6bd6wg

What's next, Amy? Advocating gay conversion therapy?
Next will probably come the 'reticence = conservative' clause, in which those of us who aren't engaging in constant no-strings sex, are told we're no better than repressive religious cultures.
Because most 'normal' potential partners move into the friend zone long before a demisexual is comfortable enough to consider intimacy.		I hate when demi and ace people are told they're broken. When the problem is the shallow hookup culture.

@Catrambo For a few years, commercial pubs were courting fanfic authors, but both agents &amp; pubs insisted on the authors stepping away from fan works.		Is that still the case?

Who is already doing this at your local women's shelters?		Same for general homeless housing? 		I keep hearing about skilled workers losing tools &amp; equipment that could ramp up their earning power.
In the case of computers, tools and art supplies, the loss of these can lead to lost money-earning opportunities.		There's a relatively cheap solution: subsidized storage for people in transitional housing.
'Stuff' can include clothing, shoes, computers, tools, books, children's toys, and all the other treasured things gathered in a life.		Some of these are replaceable, but at costs the unemployed &amp; underemployed can't meet.

The really nice part is that I love my manufacturing day job, and if I become expert at it, it will save my retirement account. I wish I'd found it years ago. 		Hugs to everyone struggling between creating for love &amp; creating for $. Take another look at non-art jobs, if you can.
I'm small-press, with a publisher I love because they enjoy my weird mix of genres. The tradeoff is that I generally earn less on writing than I did making earrings.		Enter the day job, which gives me some funds to live on and time to write and do art.
A little more time &amp; materials, for a museum-worthy $3K tapestry.		The day job funds that. Same with writing. 		For years I fought myself over which genre to write, which agent to court. Now I'm just enjoying story again, and seeing how much more marketable the results will be.
I can make 10 pairs of earrings and *maybe* sell them for $20 per pair. Out of that $200 comes 1/3 taxes, replacement supplies, and listing fees. 		Or put about the same amount of work &amp; materials to make a $1000 book art sculpture.
By spending more time &amp; materials on these special, personal projects I can 1) boost my portfolio and 2) have a growing stockpile of unusual pieces.		It's the earring conundrum again:
These are slated more toward high-end contests and publications, not really for general sales.		I closed my Etsy &amp; Amazon stores because I make very little that can sell for under $50.
My political and socially-conscious works sell right now. But I'm alternating those with the beautiful &amp; bizarre stuff I've had on the drawing board for years:		A soft sculpture winged hat. A tapestry about World Trees. More book jewelry.
For a long time I only took art projects I thought I could sell, or already had commissioned. That worked on some projects, but dulled my joy in others.		Now I can take time to do the crazy projects that are too detailed to be cost-effective sales.
This particular 'freelance' artist just got a non-art manufacturing job that has benefits and a living wage.		One unexpected side effect: I love my art and writing again.

@KaelanRhy @sharagodwinson Too many of us have had to learn to speak and write in ways accessible to neurotypical readers. I get very...twitchy...when     some authors and artists appear to use their neurological states as an excuse for sloppy writing. It makes the rest of us have to fight harder.
@sharagodwinson @KaelanRhy No, it will be an asset.
@KaelanRhy @sharagodwinson That depends. What elephant and what room?		Because I'm going to risk sounding awful by saying it's probably *not* neurotypical bias against spectrum writers.		I know too many pro writers on the spectrum who write keen, lovely, &amp; coherent prose.
@sharagodwinson @KaelanRhy Keeping those out of the mix, my work got rejected by every major reputable literary agency that takes my genres. So I let my stories go to NineStar, and I'll consider agent-shopping a standalone when I finish an appropriate one.
@sharagodwinson @KaelanRhy They can't be affiliated with heavily religious work in any faith. 	They can't be affiliated with several existing agencies or publishers that I Will Not Touch.
@tinyboo49 @HeWhoLovesWords As long as you vote, good.
@sharagodwinson @KaelanRhy Pub and agent needs: They must love high fantasy, sword-n-planet, and space opera. Be open to explicit het AND LGBTQ content, but still have an emphasis &amp; readership for SFF.
@KaelanRhy @sharagodwinson I had fulls out on PURIST, and got decent feedback for a massive rewrite. I queried again, and got even more initial interest but ultimately no takers. By then, #NineStarPress offered, so I pulled the other agent queries.
In the romance genre especially, our readerships can be a tangled, fractious, tribalistic bunch.		Don't get involved in the worst aspects, and remember we can all lift each other. But be honest with yourselves &amp; those looking up to you.
This isn't sixth grade, and it's not a cult of personality where rational people can't raise rational cautions.		Most small press and self pub authors are lucky to earn $10K USD a year. Most get desultory marketing at best.
In general, for writers at small-press publishers: play nice but be honest about this business to newer writers. You're small press, and unless you or your press has won *major and reputable* awards, neither of you are hot shit.		I say that as a small press writer.
@KaelanRhy Yup, I hear you. I'm happy to keep my Lonhra Sequence books at NineStar, but I'm preparing for self-pub just in case.		The only thing I can do is write my best work and keep my day job.
@KaelanRhy DM their name. I have an idea who. Again: ignore them.		Not to diss our publisher, whom I love, but it's not Tor or Orbit, and that writer isn't a Hugo or Nebula winner.
@KaelanRhy In my case, by the time Tor &amp; other SFF pubs had thawed to openly (not fade-to-black) LGBTQ books, my biggest series was already published, republished, &amp; locked into a small press. My writing is much better now, but there's no point in even looking for an agent right now.
@KaelanRhy Who calls you names? Ignore them, they're losers. Professionals don't have time for that nonsense.
@KaelanRhy I'm proud of many of them, mystified by others, and fiercely outraged for those who got the agent &amp; Big 5 series contract...only to be dumped.
@KaelanRhy I got agent #2 when I needed contract help with the Loose Id version of MORO'S PRICE. Again, an amazing agent, but I didn't write things she was ultimately comfortable with. I'm okay with that. By the time I stopped querying PURIST two years ago, I *was* getting agent interest.

@kylegriffin1 @JoeBarri What 'chores' will pay for the average DC area rent? Sex work, maybe.
@KaelanRhy From commercial art I gained vast 'fuckyou' filters, which serve me well when I have seen authors try to downplay the negative parts of this business. I figure they're over-compensating for something. They don't make me curl up weeping.
@KaelanRhy No, it generally doesn't make 'successful writers' uncomfy. They aren't part of some big conspiracy. They're just writers, and many of them are on our neurological spectrum, too. There are simply different routes in this business.
@KaelanRhy I knew the long odds. I'd already had an agent from 1992-1999. Lovely person, but I wasn't the writer they needed me to be. I switched from fantasy to erotic romance. Sold to small press because at that time Big 5 SFF was all 'no explicit gay cooties'.

@HeidiBelleau @JordanSBrock If you're still writing, that can eventually go into the stockpile. From your posts, it looks like you did a lot of other cool stuff.		Write when you can. Publish when you can.
@HeidiBelleau @JordanSBrock Getting a nonwriting job that pays a living wage &amp; benefits was the best thing I could do. Fickle readerships will always be fickle. My sanity &amp; comfort are more important to me.
@HeidiBelleau @JordanSBrock Don't. Start, work on, and finish what you can! I get that Some Nice People are telling you to rush and finish novels to chase  ever-fickle readerships. If you can handle that pace, good on you.		I stopped trying. I enjoy my art &amp; writing again.
@HeidiBelleau At 4 to 5 months, I count it as 'not interested, no response'. If there's a positive response after that I'd weigh how much I want to deal with that agent. And find out if they are more responsive to signed clients.
If you even think you might self-pub, get this book. https://t.co/ChpeDrjLIc
@JordanSBrock Keep that in mind. Very little is 'wasted effort' in the long run.		My 2018 fantasy novel THE PURIST started out as a 6K short in 1996.		I finished my 'Color Cards' book art piece in a month, and had it juried into a major show two days later.
@JordanSBrock Between art and writing I have between 15 and 25 'in progress' projects going *at all times*. Some have been unfinished for two decades. Some I finish in a month.
@JordanSBrock Yes. In that it gives you new momentum.		Think of unfinished works as merely paused, with the goal of returning to them when you have energy, time, and motivation.
I have good dark chocolate, great rum, a dry erase marker, and an enormous whiteboard.		Up goes the Good list and Bad list: all the positive things I've done and seen in 2018, and all the terrible things.

Fitting for #BoneSpurs Trump. https://t.co/wCP6Blj0Kb
At 53 I'm hovering between 'emerging artist' because collectors are starting to hear about me, and 'mature artist' cuz I'm a 53-year-old woman, duh. I'm also in a brand-new career where I'm nearly the youngest person there. How'd I get that one? By taking a chance.
But I know enough of my worth to keep pushing at worthwhile barricades. I submitted art to two shows this week, and got accepted into one (so far). I applied for an artist's grant the equivalent of a year's dayjob income. I'm lining up new projects.
There are many fine-craft galleries and shows I can't enter because I'm not good enough, or because my art doesn't 'fit'. That's fine. 20 years of this has taught me I can't please everyone.
I'm lucky to have 2 art representives, who sell my work to university special collections libraries, museums, and private collectors. It took six years just to become skilled enough to wow my reps (14 &amp; 8 years ago.)
I get some razzing for not showing book art in the Phoenix area. We have amazing galleries...but the ones who showed and sold my art are long gone because of recession. What remains isn't my market, and I don't even try to market here.
Sometimes, venues are not intentionally scammy, just clueless. A posh community center near me wants $200 for jurying fees, $150 to rent 18 square feet of wall for a month, and the artist pays all promo, food, etc at openings.		In a suburb that won't support a single art gallery.
Or a scam, aiming at parting you from art &amp; money. Or it claims to give you 'exposure' for your $$$.		Good shows do help expose artists to wider markets. Those are shows people have heard of.
Many shows have them. They add up. I have a rule right now that I don't enter any show costing more than $50 to enter (fees are almost always non refundable if you don't get in.) I also research the show to learn if it's legimate or a money grab.
Then come necessary expenses: entry fees, shipping, display, marketing, taxes. Learn to do all this yourself, or pay for talented professionals.		Let's talk about entry fees.
@wordforrest And yet he couldn't sell that platinum &amp; diamond skull for the longest time. Hirst, Koons, Emin &amp; many others fell off my radar long ago. I'm grateful to them for only one reason. I know that people (and galleries) who love them are not 'my' people.
One secret of 'success' in art is doing something in a way that few other people do. It may take time to find the right fit. It may never happen.		Diversify your art &amp; other income streams. Use the money &amp; validations from one artform to bolster your willpower in other areas.
But once you do decide to sell and show work, pay attention to gallery submissions requirements. They exist for several reasons, not least to see if you can follow directions.		Submit the right work to venues that it might fit. Grow a thick skin.
@wordforrest Beats me. Fine-art magazines tend to make me yawn or curse. I'm too much an artisan.
Then you have to do the next Hard Thing: push beyond that comfort level. Make technically harder things, and things that make you think.		It's okay if you never sell or show anything. Let your heirs and curators a hundred years from now sort it out.
@wordforrest In some cases money is a useful marker. For myself in fine craft, I know I see the best when it makes me shiver in euphoria and a warped draconic greed. Not to possess, but simply to look closer.
It's going to be *hard*. You will alternate between thinking 'That stuff is so amazing I will never come close' and 'who gave that pile of chickencrap a SOLO SHOW'.		Eventually you'll find your level.
Not state fairs or bargain Etsy stores, but museums, galleries, &amp; magazines showcasing your kind of work.		Don't know how to find those? This is your business, passion, or both. Learn Google-Fu.
Thread about art shows. 		For the artists who don't think they're good enough to enter (reputable) shows...how do you know until you try?		Develop clear-eyed self-critiques. Measure your work not against people at your level, but the best in your field.

Finally, and to repeat for emphasis:		If you mean it as class-based criticism, it's none of your damn business where another human being gets their clothing.
The clothes could be home-made. Yes (gasp!) some of us can sew really good clothing at home. We have clubs, online forums, and international magazines to share &amp; teach skills.
The clothes could have come from a reseller on Ebay, or from skilled thrift store shopping.		I regularly benefit from label whores who donate great, nearly-new clothing to Saver's, Goodwill, and other thrift stores. Think $100 boots for $5.
Those clothes could be rented. Lots of services offer the chance to rent high-quality clothes, purses, shoes, etc. for reasonable fees.
You don't know where that person got those clothes.		They could be leftovers from a more-affluent time or family member. Or gifts from friends. Because the 'sisterhood of the traveling pants' is not just a magic-realism trope. 		People swap clothes.
Someone poor is wearing clothes 'too good' for them? Back off. We don't have sumptuary laws in the US. This is just another manifestation of the American pathology of criminalizing poverty.

Folks, you will see this book someday, whether from the Big Five, the boutique press looking at it now, or self-published. Wherever it lands, it will be a groundbreaker.
But because my friend isn't in the moneyed and/or tech class, she doesn't have the resources that would let her write to full capacity. Even though she writes a staggering word count, has a great agent, and glowing reviews.
When certain people snark that women can't write plot-driven kickass SFF, I wonder what those idiots have been reading since, oh, C. L. Moore and Andre Norton.		There's a new crop of great women SFF writers. My friend is one of them.
Seriously, I can't stop thinking about this book. Great secondary-world setting. Disabled female protag. Cyborg male sidekick. Sapient gorillas flying steampunk airships in a war against a terrifying AI that nearly demolished humanity.

@whimsicallyours Blair Witch.
I'm just wondering about the changes in reading habits (and abilities) I've seen in 40+ years of following SFF publishing.
So, without referencing any single review, when adult readers tell me PURIST was hard to follow, I kinda wonder what else they're reading.		Nor am I knocking YA, which *can* have complex interwoven plots.
Okay, so she's already a jaded veteran of the YA wars, but I value her reactions *even though I don't write YA and have no intention of doing so.*
Yes, there are multiple time frames and viewpoints, because I *love* writing different views of a single story. But for anyone who read the aforementioned authors,  THE PURIST isn't that difficult a read.		One of my beta readers is 14 years old.
So, I wrote this book. https://t.co/U3UbcQsUbq		One of the simplest pieces I've done, but inspired by the emotion &amp; visuals of McKillip, Cherryh, and other fantasy writers.

11 The fact that my day job is not in art or fiction, *does not make me any less of a professional writer or an artist*.		Nor should it for any of the other millions of creatives who need unrelated careers to survive, much less thrive.
10 My meandering point is this: my art reps promote my work, so it sells, so I have incentive to make more art. My fiction gets better reviews if I take time with it, instead of chasing trends. My day job lets me do both.
9 I cut my losses, pulled my agent queries last summer, went to a decent small press, and didn't bother subbing to the few Big Five SFF publishers open to unagented authors. In the case of a 'yes', the agents I liked had already said 'no'.
8 The first Lonhra Sequence book, MORO'S PRICE, was too graphic a space opera for Tor, Daw, etc in 2012 when I queried it to agents. It went small press. Because of that, getting agent interest for the related THE PURIST was difficult.
7 What if I'd kept on querying agents last year, instead of pulling my sub in favor of a small press offer? Would I have any interest from Big Five SFF? A big advance? The equivalent of $35K or more a year? I have no idea.
6 The new job takes away the pressure that my art and writing must recoup their ROI quickly, freeing me to craft better art. Which leads to better payouts from better clients.
5 I do better when I focus on creating something over-the-top amazing, to the best of my limited abilities. No matter how long it takes. Those pieces will always eventually find their happy buyers. I'm starting to see that with my fiction, too.
4 After some soul-searching, I'm okay with this. I started creating a space fantasy universe in 1983 as a hobby. That two books based within it actually got published is fun, but I'm not relying on those books to pay my bills. I learned something crucial from my art.
3 In my creative arenas, I have art reps who love my work and promote it to private collectors, university special collections libraries, and musems. I have published fiction getting kind reviews, even though it's not getting much promo.
2 New Job is amazing and worthwhile work, and not remotely related to art and writing. But it hinges on precise craftsmanship, will allow me a decent steady paycheck, and time off to do *my* creative things.

@wordforrest Even then, would you *want* an agency handling your Big Five publishing contract, when they didn't think enough of the book to say 'yes' to your query? Why would they do a better job now?
@wordforrest This is why even old farts like me tell new writers: query agents first for a few years, then publishers. Be aware of which agencies *won't even touch* a pub offer they didn't initiate from the first. When in doubt, ask the agency.
@wordforrest Yup. I'm in awe of and cheerlead ridiculously for those who make it that far.
@wordforrest And by the time you make it through the slush, and get an offer a year or two later, you MUST get an agent, because only a fool goes up to a Big Five contract without one. But guess what! All the agents you really like have *already rejected the book*.

@KaelanRhy I admit, I'm as hard on self-pub stuff as I am on fanfiction. I read for joy. Sometimes a story is so wonderful I excuse some minor stuff. Most of the time I drop pieces by the third page.
@KaelanRhy That's what I suspect happens: the Name writers or flashy debuts get quality editing, but midlisters get the interns.
@alexandraerin Hugs. Glad it worked out for you. Gives me hope for the future, if I decide to put money into that adventure.
@KaelanRhy Yup. I'm a fair writer, but damn do I need editors. That cost is the main reason I can't self-pub yet.
@KaelanRhy Definitely, it is a different skill. Why I don't give large-pub editors much leeway when I see editing gaffes from writers who should know better.
@KaelanRhy TBH, I get disappointed more by the fiction writing from Actual Editors than anything else. Some are amazing, but the fails make me cringe. At least that lets me know who not to hire as an editor.

@KaelanRhy True...if you're a Worldcon nonattending member, you can vote.		Also consider the Dragon Awards as a more democratic alternative, if they haven't been hijacked by rightwingers.
@KaelanRhy That also means: great editing, stunning covers, and writing that should be *better* than the average Big Five nominated works.		This caliber of work exists in self-pub and small press. We need to get the word out about it.
@KaelanRhy Harsh truth ahead: SFWA qualifying market status for a small press or self-pub is $3000 in sales or a short fic sale for at least 6¬¢ per word. That's part of how Hugo juries will judge you.

@ErikLoomis Why. The 1950s have so many culinary fails to answer for, but this one is truly gagworthy.
@kaitlancollins How much is Trump paying him, or how bad are the Russian tapes of Rand Paul?
How many SFF convention artists can actually make these costs back in art sales, much less make a profit?
@Aggy_C That what I worry about: if I go to a con, I don't want to staff a tradeshow booth the whole time.
Look at an average art show entry package: $15 to $25 per vertical 4x4' panel. Up to $100x2 for shipping, return. Some don't allow mailed art, require membership: $45 to $200. Membership requires travel + hotel: $1500 average.
By that same metric, are convention art sales worth the cost of entry/shipping/membership?
Does author attendance at large SFF conventions actually sell books? I have to plan out 2019's con attendance, if any. I'm not seeking an agent or Big Five attention, only minor career networking &amp; hanging with friends. But that's an expensive vacation.

My point for newly querying writers: there are lots of paths to publishing, and a lot of contradictory stuff that happens along the way. What works for one person may not work for another. Don't beat yourself up over the vagaries of publication.
An agent I'd previously queried complimented the book, and asked why I didn't send it to them after I rewrote it.		Agency has a no-repeat policy. They don't rep established series, and this was part of the space opera they'd also rejected.
I decided my current publisher was the best one: an LGBTQIA-friendly press with skilled editors, cover artists, marketing, and decent contracts. Preorders and initial reviews have been good.
I could've stayed the query course, but 75% of target agents had responded. The Big Five SFF pubs showed slush backlogs of over a year. Even if I *did* get a Big Five offer, I'd need an agent. But the ones whose MSWL matched...had already rejected the mms.
A few full requests. A few more partials. No offers, but some nice personal rejections. Three months into querying last summer, my current publisher expressed interest.	I sent notice to the remaining agents and accepted the offer.
Agent #2 and I amicably parted  because the only non-erotic mms I had wasn't selling. My publisher folded, but by then I had a new publisher for the space opera. Based on feedback, I rewrote the Orpheus fantasy. Between 2016 and 2017 I queried 86 agents.
Remember that short story from the 90s? I'd dusted it off and turned it into a novella, then a novel. The new agent tried valiantly to rep it. We got rejections from several Big Five SFF houses.		The story didn't fit then-current erotic romance pubs.
I worked with another agent on that contract, because the agent was interested in my mainstream (non erotic romance) SFF work.		Then bad stuff happened in my life, requiring hard choices. Art paid more than writing, so writing had to be set aside again.
Because it was a bisexual space opera with sex as a core theme, I didn't bother to query it to Big Five SFF pubs. After trying about 20 agents, I tried erotic romance epubs. Loose Id said yes...if I added more sex scenes.		The book did okay for its market.
I wrote more books set within the fantasy universe I'd created as a hobby in 1983. (Hint for newly querying authors: don't admit this in public, not until an agent or editor asks. You'll be regarded at best as wasting your time.) The sixth of those mms sold.
5. It did marvels for my writing. Maybe I'd have done better going to Clarion or some other SFF workshop, or even attending conventions. I focused on my art, found some earned confidence there, and jumped back into fiction in 2009.
4. I got personal rejections showing me where I needed to improve the short story. By then I had two art careers going, so I stepped away from original fiction. For ten years. I wrote fanfiction and nonfiction how-to papers for my commercial work.
3. It borrowed some tone from McKillip's 'Riddlemaster' series, but the basic story riffed on the Orpheus myth. There was no actual sex in this 6K story, but it fit into a bigger fantasy series where het and gay sex happen. I subbed it to several places.
2. I had an agent at the time. My longer works were not as good as they should have been. This was also the mid 90s. The agent was uncomfortable repping fantasy works with openly gay characters. We amicably parted ways in 1999. But I had this story...

I should be past panic with the last author ARC proofing pass. Especially on a book in the works since the late 90s. It's too late for structural edits, and I accept a few typos might slip by. I have a great cover. Betas and editors like the mms.

@sebastian_lk @whimsicallyours I think we are on the same side. We know it's hard work. I've been writing since 1987, often in nonfiction marketing. I've had 2 agents. My best book is out on August 6. I quit writing for 10 years to manage an art career.
I will professionally and respectfully agree that writers &amp; other creatives have to be willing to sacrifice. It would be nice if we didn't get hounded for the sacrifice, too. I'm afraid you just proved my point. https://t.co/k5gxyLxJrZ
@sebastian_lk @whimsicallyours I've read her MSWL &amp; seen her projects listed in PW: she's a powerhouse. I respect her immensely. But I can still point out all the ways 'You have to want it' utterly demoralizes authors who can't juggle &amp; still be perfect writers.
@whimsicallyours As I said, you're an inspiration for a lot of us, Patrice, and seeing you reach your potential has been wonderful. 		I think you've also touched on the other great myth that crucifies creatives: instant perfection. Which realistically is often unattainable.
@whimsicallyours You've been a positive inspiration, so I wanted to be clear on calling out the general practice.
@Blind_Nycteris That's just it...we've been conditioned to operate as if art and creativity are pure luxuries, and creatives have to justify their existence by producing useful, topical, or popular art. Or hating ourselves for taking joy in creative play.
@whimsicallyours To your credit, you didn't spread that fallacy, for which I thank you.		But too many other FT reasonably successful writers do. Genre conventions in SFF &amp; Romancelandia, where I play, are filled with this kind of poison.
