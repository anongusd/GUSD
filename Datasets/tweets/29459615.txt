@GOP As has the president. He has engaged in fraudulent businesses, more than 8,000 lies in 2+ years; has illegally  coordinated with Russians &amp; Saudis to win the election. But the GOP couldnt care less about this; facts &amp; crimes be damned! We just want to stay in power!

@LindseyGrahamSC Really?  If he had, guess what that means? He was acting with the knowledge &amp; consent of trump. It means that trump was involved in the conspiracy! You really should be ashamed of yourself Lindsey.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Nice to claim this now that you've gone after him &amp; then stalked him during the hearing.

@ChuckGrassley Add in Kav's bs conspiracy w/others to push a defamatory claim that it was another man. All on Dr. Fords side screams that she's telling the truth; all on Kav's side screams he's lying &amp;u knew it. Its why you immediately had 65 women attest to him &amp; most have backed off. #Liar
@ChuckGrassley Also what is Kav not doing? Asking his long time friend Judge to testify. Add to that his high school year book where he boasts abt 100s of kegs of beer &amp; "Devil's Triangle"--what happened here? Alcohol drenched men, trying to rape a girl into a devils triangle. But you dont care
@ChuckGrassley trying to look fair but so far from fair! Who communicates 2a nom on twitter unless u r trying 2perpetrate a lie. Who passed a polygraph AND is asking for an FBI investigation? The truth teller Dr. Ford; who's sitting by, not taking a polygraph, not asking 4 an investigation? Kav
@ChuckGrassley You try to lookfair but clearly arent. Tweeting this bs just shows that you are playing a game. You are conducting a mockery of a hearing; you dont care what Dr. Ford has to say; you just care about shoving a horrid person onto SCOTUS. It why youve hidden docs. U know hes horrid

@VickiTaylor7 So much propaganda &amp; stupidity being peddled by Vicki. Throw in her refusal to provide support for her positions beyond what she "knows" when evidence proves her wrong earns the magat a block
@VickiTaylor7 There was no partisanship in the intelligence community; they had been provided with evidence of crimes committed by those around Trump and likely Trump and so they investigated. What you propose is that they close their eyes to crime and let it occur. The corruption is with 45
@VickiTaylor7 I am very familiar with him and his background. You are engaging in what-aboutism trying to lessen the propaganda you are spreading. As a result, Im not wasting my time with your unsupported nonsense
@VickiTaylor7 Again what you "know" is wrong. A substantial majority of the dossier has been verified by the FBI, CIA, IC, our allies &amp; by testimony given before congress. I read a substantial amount on these topics from a multitude of sources. Had u changed from fox u would know u r wrong
@VickiTaylor7 Actually it was John McCain who took the dossier to the FBI. This was widely reported and Senator McCain admitted that he did. So what you "know" is once again wholly incorrect.
@VickiTaylor7 You are correct that no CIA Director has spoken about a president in this matter as there has never been a president this corrupt, this narcissistic, treasonous, propaganda pusher before. When a president is this bad, members of government are duty bound to speak against him
@VickiTaylor7 When you rely upon Hannity to prove your point, you have extreme problems in that you cant distinguish fact from lies and fiction.  Roughly 99.9999% of all that comes out of Hanity's mouth is propagada &amp; lies

@realDonaldTrump The FBI told you! You keep lying about all of this but we know you are a criminal and will spend the rest of your life in jail. So cant wait!
@realDonaldTrump So many lies in 240 characters. There arent any Clinton staffers on Mueller's team; theres an independent counsel because of all the crimes u &amp; ur family have committed.The Constitution was set up to prevent u from getting away all of your crimes. &amp; you referenced Nazis #impeach
@realDonaldTrump Thats a substantial amount of lies in one tweet. You have fanned the flames of racism, homophobia, raped, pillaged the economy for your personal gain. Appointed a justice you should never had the opportunity to appoint &amp; appointed tons of wholly unqualified people for jobs
@realDonaldTrump You are destroying the US Economy and your base. You must be selling so many products short to profit from this absurdity. You will go down in history as the worst president in history
@realDonaldTrump Stop lying! It is constitutional and it isnt a game! You know that all you do is part of a criminal scheme. You are going to go to jail for the rest of your life as will Jr and Ivanka and Jared

@JackKingston Not a chance that anyone will think you are smart or have a world view. You open your mouth &amp; the world knows how stupid, hate filled, hypocritical you are
@JackKingston You truly need to follow Mark Twain's quote "Its better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt". Each time you tweet, speak, mansplain on CNN you truly demonstrate how stupid you are. You are a small,hypocritical, petty man
@CarrilloAnt @LauraWalkerKC I had conducted a court search and couldnt find any evidence of a filing. Further since Cohen addressed some of Daniel's attorneys comments and didnt address either filing pro hac vice or having local counsel in light of her attorney saying  he wasnt licensed, tells me a lot
@waffull @LauraWalkerKC Very true except when you are an attorney and are acting as an attorney in performing the service like Cohen was. Then he had to be licensed to do the work

@LauraWalkerKC @ekweozor41 @teutoburgforest Me too!  It thrills me to no end #joy
@ekweozor41 @teutoburgforest @LauraWalkerKC Yes it is that serious. And yes, if Cohen is convicted, not only will Ca tell the NY bar, Cohen will have the duty to report himself to the NY bar and if he doesnt, thats another violation with the NY bar
@ekweozor41 @LauraWalkerKC Yes especially if he is found guilty of moral turpitude (which can include fraud which seems to happen here).  And Ca can find him guilty of illegally practicing law

Then throw in DD/45 failing to sign, its a steaming pile. by the way, referring to Stormy as PP makes me laugh in light of the pee pee tape
@LauraWalkerKC @waffull I read it the day it got published. Nasty &amp; very poorly written. Too many inconsistencies. In Ca contracts are read against the one who wrote it. Between the inconsistencies &amp; the fact that it paid late (thats breach there but she accepted the late payment) &amp; that it tries to ...
@CarrilloAnt @LauraWalkerKC He has to file paperwork with the court first. Doesnt look like he did it. He certainly didnt do it with the Arb as it was set up &amp; conducted on the same day
@LauraWalkerKC @waffull Cohen unlawfully practiced law to form the LLC in Ca; more likely than not, the LLC will still exist but Cohen is going to be in legal trouble for engaging in the unlawful practice of law (&amp; he didnt file pro hac vice paperwork w/the Court). The arb is invalid-same reason
@LauraWalkerKC Ive been saying this since the day filed the Complaint. Im a 30+yr litigator licensed in Ca. I immediately looked up Cohen and had a "dude you are going to be charged with a misdemeanor and may lose your NY license too!"
@kylegriffin1 He dined with and employed a Nazi; sure Trump isnt  a racist or anti-Semitic. He just employs them. Such complete garbage just like his presidency
@ezlusztig Wow! That is beautiful!
@realDonaldTrump @Saccone4PA18 You know thats the kiss of death! Keep supporting the GOP and they will be gone soon! #ImpeachTrumpNow
@SethAbramson Exactly! She conceeded it despite the fact that 45 not singing the contract was his plausable deniability. Since when can an Ca arbitrator determine injunctive relief? They cant especially when Cohen was illegally practicing law in a state he isnt licensed to practice in
@SethAbramson @TheyCallMeTarz And getting the ruling all happened on the same day. Looks like Cohen engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in Ca
@SethAbramson @TheyCallMeTarz I do find it amazing that Cohen, who is only licensed to practice law in NY and isnt licensed in Ca (I checked), came to Ca, practiced law before the arbitrator to get the restraining order. No pro hac vice that I can find &amp; his going to ADR group &amp; setting up the hearing...
