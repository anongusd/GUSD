Now a question for all of you: How do we inspire the next President to commit to Mars by the 50th Anniversary (July 2019)? #AnswerBuzz
Thanks to everyone for your great #AskBuzz questions! Really enjoyed speaking with you all.
.@JoshMHunter Yes. Men (and women!) will create a permanent colony in a most significant, giant leap for mankind. #GYATM
.@sfantoniomaffei "We've only just begun" - The Carpenters
.@MihaiFirst My older sister Fay Ann, because she couldn't pronounce Brother (so I was Buzzer). And I've been Buzz ever since...
.@ScottMcGinnis69 Innovation happens to be my middle name. But I joke it could be "Lightyear" too.
.@MihaiFirst I suppose it helped...
.@PiperClass Out. Of. This. World.
.@gpw5150 Unfortunately, no. There's no way to recreate the view that we had of (in my words) "magnificent desolation."
.@JoeRemix I have a sci-fi novel (Encounter with Tiber) that's better than Star Wars and Star Trek (in my humble opinion!)
.@troovus Would be fun, but I think I'm more valuable here on Earth planning the Mars missions.
.@SteveDalton01 In space, there's a velvety blackness to the sheen created by the ambient surface sun. It has a real depth.
.@_UncleMitch Of course! It was a very pretty, blue convertible. But I much prefer the hard tops of today (i.e., BMW M3, "Red Rocket")
.@drquuxum I'm sure the backpacks would not. But the urine bags would probably be reusable!
.@Liz11660 Can't recall the names, but every math teacher I had in high school. Big influence on my time at West Point.
.@steveskunx Tough to say, since it wasn't what I set out to do!
