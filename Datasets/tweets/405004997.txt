I’m not sure about Syria withdrawal. Lots to say. Very conflicted. Big risk/reward.		But, in short, best argument for withdrawal might be that America not being there means that bad people kill each other. So, let them kill each other and—if need be—we kill the last one standing.
This is all true. Caravans did not get through. @realDonaldTrump deserves the credit for that. No doubt, he has changed the southern border reality.

I also love that @AMVETSHQ is anti-“for profit.” Last time I checked, for-profit capitalism made America the most powerful and prosperous nation in the world. Profit is not evil, it’s essential. Unless you just believe in government-run everything for veterans...and everyone. https://t.co/Xd8VU3CJ08
So your answer is: NO https://t.co/Xd8VU3CJ08
Wait, let me get this straight. @AMVETSHQ begs for more money for gov’t-run VA healthcare each year, regardless of outcome; but when it come to vets choosing best possible private care, you are suddenly fiscal hawks? (BTW: “reasonable reform” is DC-code for: NOTHING CHANGES). https://t.co/4UTx8XWHfL
One more question for @AMVETSHQ (if they can stick to policy): should a service-connected, disabled veteran who lives 5 minutes from the @MayoClinic—the world’s best healthcare—be able to CHOOSE taxpayer-funded care there? Smart enough to serve...but not smart enough to choose?
Typical swamp. Attack real reforms in defense of the status quo. The last time @AMVETSHQ supported a good idea was when they...endorsed the @ConcernedVets plan for real VA choice in 2015. But, predictably, you backed away from that too. https://t.co/zxCM2mADKn
Hahaha. Now I’m bought and paid for?! Typical of what groups like yours do when they don’t have any good ideas: they attack the motives of reformers and sow conspiracy theories—all in defense of failing bureacracies they are invested in protecting. Sad. https://t.co/wadNo5FRdb
This interview is revealing. @AMVETSHQ — like most DC-based veterans groups — doesn’t believe vets are capable of making their own healthcare choices. And, as I ask, if VA healthcare is so good, then why be afraid of private sector choices? WATCH 👉 https://t.co/3Mhm88O0dj

The more I reflect on last night's speech, the more evident it is that @realDonaldTrump steamrolled @TheDemocrats. Chuck &amp; Nancy looked cranky, small &amp; obstinate. He was optimistic, strong &amp; gracious. And—bottom line—Trump is pro-citizen, Dems are pro-illegal. #AmericaFirst
This is why Democrats will continue to lose to @realDonaldTrump. Far-Left @MSNBC loons like @JoyAnnReid — who help define their ideological compass — think "church, family, police, military, and the national anthem" belong in a bygone era. #2018 #AmericansAreDreamersToo https://t.co/wevp0fwBcB
