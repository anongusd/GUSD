@MaxBoot Exactly right. This was a sign of repudiation of Trumpism, for those who can see the forest, despite all the trees.
8/ Keep fighting for your country! This was a good night to build on!
7/ Mueller is better protected, House investigation and oversight have teeth, and GOP have a path out of Trumpism, if they take it. FL, AZ and TX were much closer than they want, because of rejection of Trump.
6/ Don't believe the story that it was a mixed night. It was as good as it was realistically going to be for the Dems, a hopeful night for the #NeverTrump-ers, and a very bad night for Trump.
5/ GOP lost states, so they are further away from #ConCon. This is a big goal for them. If they can change the Constitution, all bets are off. They were dangerously close.
4/ House pickups for Dems include some Very Red seats. In IL, Roskam and Hultgren lost to newcomers. This is huge. Those districts were gerrymandered to be solid R districts.
3/ GOP will push narrative about FL and pickup of Senators. Means little. They still don't have 60 Senators, so they can't stop filibuster. And next 2 elections aren't tilted in their favor.
2/ Winning the House is key. The margin doesn't matter as much as having power over committees. Subpoena power, yes. Also, stopping bad legislation from the Senate. Plus, spending bills must originate in the House.
Some thoughts on last night's #BlueWave. And yes, it was a significantly good night for Democrats.
