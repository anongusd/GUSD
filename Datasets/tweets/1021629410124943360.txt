@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake I didn't mean to overstate the fact that The President has expressed his displeasure at the investigation several times. There are multiple on the record statements. That qualifies as evidence.
@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake https://t.co/RCocANdq5B
@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake Yes. Why not. Really? Mitch McConnell has given no good reason. This legislation would do nothing if trump doesn't fire Mueller, do you have one?
@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake In 2008 the GOP started stonewalling judges. Hadnt been done before like that. It's why Harry Ried changed the Senate rules and removed the filibuster. There were tons of vacancies, his hands were tied. Not you personally.

@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake And you started it. I wish we had a way to finish it. https://t.co/q9O3CRMX0s
@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake It wouldn't be hard for them start preparing their defense. The inevitable trials to come are like a test, and the files Mueller has are like the answers. Who knew what, and when.
@FreeWhiteMale @JeffFlake Because that's not how real life works. In real life the number of ways to protect the INTEGRITY of the investigation after it's been axed is a round even 0. Once the agents are reassigned and the cases given to trump loyalists in the DOJ, even for a day...

@Mermaid7474 @MikeTokes It raises questions about the Texas SoS. I'm sure he's a republican. How's he letting DREAMers register?? Or that woman and man we're lying to brush her off (how would that guy know if DREAMers showed up at his poll? They wouldn't wear a sign
@Mermaid7474 @MikeTokes Hmm. I just watched that video. "If he's registered to vote and has his ID he can vote" I fully expect that answer from a low level poll worker. Both seemed to be hurrying that reporter along. "yes yes if he's registered, leave me alone I'm busy"
@ref615 @dbongino So what about his life makes him remotely qualified over people who have worked for the DOJ for years????
@ref615 @dbongino Really? He was a lawyer, who lost alot, then a DA, who lost his race, then a lawyer again, who's company he was counseling was charged with fraud, then a CNN contributor, then trump fast tracked him to CoS for sessions, and now he's acting AG.

@FreeWhiteMale It's much more stupid in the midterms. Not every seat is up, so its not representative of the population. I would say losing by 3 million votes isn't entirely without meaning.

@AslanTigger1 @realDailyWire The bar for what's ok to make fun of, for me, comes down to choice. If Dan has a severe eye injury, socket and all, and can't wear a glass eye, the patch isn't a choice, and is off limits. If his socket is fine and he could wear a glass eye, his patch is fashion, and fair game.

@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Trump's talk about 'cheap' steel and aluminum was all talk. In regards to quality anyway, not price
@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Yes. Computers. Hell no. Weapons in general. No. But I have faith in Halliburton or whoevers metallurgical testing division. Simple raw materials we can have great QC checks on. They can tell u how much nickel impurity is in ur steel down to the part per billion
@iamtherealenki @Flyguyav8r @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Yes, refining. Don't know much except it uses a ton of some nasty carcinogenic chemicals. And even then it's turned into huge sheets or bars that get then turned into goods by all sorts of manufacturers
@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Noooo. No it can't only. If they're up 10 but some fictional company that makes aluminum roofing is down 15 than it's a net loss. If it costs more to produce here then we will export less, possibly.
@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Is my take
@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Well I'm an environmental guy. If we can make $$$ without mining, let China rape it's mountains and rivers in exchange for like, software and soy and motorcycles, I'm all for it. But there's whole communities built around mining and the Dems don't have a plan to take care of um.
@james_marcello @SharylAttkisson Maybe he did it
@Flyguyav8r @iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump The liberal. The Other. They're so alien arnt they they're basically not people amirite.
@iamtherealenki @Flyguyav8r @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump True. But mining ore and mining coal are mostly the same job. If we can produce so much more coal with so many fewer workers it follows logically that a similar situation exists for iron and copper mining.
@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump You know ur right, neither side is strong on recycling. I think it's a scattershot tho.

@iamtherealenki @jimmycramer2017 @SchlieperLetty @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump They can strip mine a mountain with like 15 people where 50 years ago they would have used hundreds and have it take twice as long. Those jobs aren't coming back. Also, alot of metal is recycled.

@DogginTrump @irisosman1 Or just go early vote tomorrow. Do it. I dare you. Go to sleep. Right now. Get off your phone. Get up early and go do it. What if you get into a jam on Tuesday?

@Crocawards @FreeWhiteMale Mandatory training programs. Get those Dem charitys to pay for it. Take it, get useful or GTFO. I mean the only thing I know really is they're brown, they want to start a new life in the US, and they're coming. I'd want them vetted of course.

@Think51783608 @taw381 @SexyHunchback @BillOReilly Can you tell me what you like about the way the country is going? Economical, political, social, what? Only because I also like the way the country is going, but despite trump and his... Ehemm... Direction.

@Think51783608 @taw381 @SexyHunchback @BillOReilly I guess that was a couple questions lol
@Think51783608 @taw381 @SexyHunchback @BillOReilly Yup. The question is, since it is political, should it affect the way you vote. I see ur a maga supporter and there's nothing wrong with that, so my only question is, do you support trump when he claims those Dems are criminals who are immune to justice? Do you believe that?
@realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog Hillary is a criminal right? And she's not going to have justice done to her by the crooked FBI or any other authorities right? So, believing that, what is the proper way for a moral man to seek justice for Hillarys victims??
@realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog If you believed someone was a lying evil criminal who was immune to our justice system, wouldn't the right thing to do be to try and stop that person? Wouldn't it be reasonable to see that as justice?
@realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog You didn't really make a good argument. No, trump and co didn't personally contract the guy. They did however call all 'trumps targets' evil lying criminals over and over again.
@VillainClubOG35 @chuckwoolery Or Russia
@chuckwoolery So trump supporters are deplorable but trump isn't?
@SpicyVelle @BreitbartNews Like the time they found out trump lied about the amount of $$ he got from his dad by a factor of 417?
@Think51783608 @taw381 @SexyHunchback @BillOReilly Hmm. So it doesn't have to be 'politics' to be 'political'. Like praying while driving home isn't church related, but it is spiritual. it's a question of motivation. Does that help? It requires the assumption that this guy was thinking of politics as motivation for the crime.

@sweetsweetgravy @Cernovich It's not a headline it's inside the article.
@KriegBlitzer @sheshifts001 @bostonlass65 @ms2AR15 @SkipBlazer @Breaking911 Well there's alot more of them...
@almostjingo @JackPosobiec Cool
@JackPosobiec Nobody
@EdnaNelsen @Lrihendry It's not
@OfficeOfMike @Cernovich Which media?
@PoliticalKathy @Cernovich Your first statement is a lie
@sheshifts001 @bostonlass65 @ms2AR15 @SkipBlazer @Breaking911 It's also important to be logical.
@DawnSanborn1 @Hoganknows @LouDobbs I'd rather reporters smoke out the trump middle men and bust the conspiracy wide open. The whole things ridiculous anyway. Nobody needs to pay anyone to want to come here, we're awesome, and there's saftey in numbers, it's as simple as that.
@Hoganknows @LouDobbs Na it's Trump's ppl sending them. Think. The left has nothing to gain, the right has everything to gain from a caravan of migrants threatening the border
@IngrahamAngle How is this? Buuuurrrrrnnnn
@CynthiaSchnepp @JackPosobiec So trump paid the caravan do u think?
@ChrisValence @JackPosobiec Or it was him who was paying those ppl to March north. Good way to scare the base to the polls.

@Jamaica658 @Breaking911 Feel before you buy, it's just filled with a bunch of styrofoam beads
@1776HotLips @themasteroffu @JimECulberson @LeahR77 Hey there, alt acct. I did. And again after you asked. She was talking about our economic prosperity and climate change regarding the Dems agenda. The GOP took it out of context. Not that you wanted an answer https://t.co/e6ki6KeHxA
@MarkFanPatriot @themasteroffu Well mark, does a level headed person reply to a reply and then immediately block that person? Doesn't sound very level headed, does it?
@Cernovich We'll fake it all soon. The market will drive it. We can culture huge muscles in factories.
@Barnes_Law @Cernovich Lock her up! Lock her up! Mob tactics. Lock her up! Lock her up!
@johnDeep45 @Cernovich They won't be appointed to the supreme Court, probably.
@amagras @joopvankooten Was he purged????
@amagras @joopvankooten Wictor!!!!! ***
@amagras @joopvankooten What happened to Thomas Will be tour??
@ddwiese @themasteroffu @KMGGaryde U'll
@ddwiese @themasteroffu @KMGGaryde Hi there, alt acct. So his lies about his drinking, the Bart Okavanaugh angle, doesn't bother you? Hope to talk but I suppose I'll just block this acct too...
@fiImkid Hey there alt Actually... acct. Didn't mean to offend, just my oppositional defiance disorder
@AndrewPollackFL @RonDeSantisFL @dbongino And when some depressed goth kid grabs the snoozing security guards gun and starts waving it around and hurts someone, where will you be Pollack?
@AndrewPollackFL @RonDeSantisFL @dbongino And you might end up hiring bad or untrained or unvetted people who could themselves be responsible for violence when kids who don't like them start shit with them as they surely will cuz they're kids.
@AndrewPollackFL @RonDeSantisFL @dbongino Except no tho because the secret service and wealthy people can hire trained security professionals and pay them like professionals. Whereas our 100000+ schools can't afford that good protection
@LdyNJ1 @themasteroffu @Sandrae38972624 @RobertValderaz @realDonaldTrump Hey there, Alt Actually... Acct. Hahahahahaha ahahahahahahahah hahaha hehehehe. We told you he knew. How many times did we tell you. The pieces were all there. Electing a traitorous scoundrel to own the libs lol
