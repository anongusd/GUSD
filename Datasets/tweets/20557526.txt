.@JRittereiser: “34% of the patient population in this district are on Medicaid. I will represent these people &amp; all people in our district. I have the best chance out of the three of us of beating Republican @DinoRossiWA to help flip the House.” #WA08 https://t.co/UmiQlzY0F6

.@DrKimSchrier: “Social, reproductive &amp; economic justice are absolutely intertwined &amp; intersectional, esp for communities of color. We as a society need to trust &amp; value women’s decisions &amp; if that means becoming a mom, we need to better set women up for economic success.” #WA08
.@ShannonHader: “Paid family leave is essential but we need to go beyond that. We need to make sure workplace accommodations for women— especially in service jobs—are there, specifically pregnant women &amp; women who are breast feeding.” #WA08 #paidfamilyleave
.@JRittereiser: “Republicans like to talk about family values but if they *really* meant it, that would mean actually protecting mothers in the workplace. I’ll fight on this issue every day - especially for paid family leave.” #WA08
.@DrKimSchrier: “This admin has served to activate young people already - one way I saw this right after the election was the sheer increase of young women coming to my office to get IUDs. To get young ppl vote, we must address issues they care about—like #reprorights.” #WA08 https://t.co/o1u6IwYcRM

.@DrKimSchrier: “A delayed abortion is a less safe abortion and we must work to increase access to abortion across the country. No one should have to drive 100+ miles to access care.” #WA08 https://t.co/abHHAOGIqk
.@ShannonHader: “I’ve worked in countries where abortion is illegal &amp; I’ve seen horrible things w/ patients bc abortion services were not available. We can’t let our country head in this direction. And increasing access to abortion &amp; family planning must be a priority.” #WA08
.@DrKimSchrier: “We have freedom of religion which includes freedom FROM religion. Hijacking healthcare from women bc of one religion’s philosophical viewpoint is unacceptable.” #WA08
.@ShannonHader: “We need to penalize states that don’t protect truth in advertising. Even with religious freedom, corporations should not be treated like people. We need to overturn Citizen’s United.” #WA08
.@JRittereiser: “Religious freedom disguised as discrimination is unacceptable. It’s been used to fire women who are pregnant &amp; unmarried. It’s the intersection of law &amp; policy in this country &amp; this is my area of expertise.” #WA08

A8: A W A R E N E S S AWARENESS awareness! will help combat the stigma surrounding medication abortion. Focus on spreading science &amp; factual information will help fight the culturally induced "stigma." @reproaction @TheNWHN @reproaction
A7: The taboo surrounding medication abortion and miscarriage harms womxn because if it is not being discussed then anti-choice extremists can spread misleading lies about the two subjects ex. medication abortion causes infertility. #ReproDemystified @reproaction @nwhn
A6: Yes, you can still become pregnant if you have a miscarriage and a medication abortion! #ReproDemystified @reproaction @TheNWHN So glad we are talking about this!
A5: Most of the time miscarriages can occur safely but there are times when one should seek medical assistance. Signs to seek assistance are: foul smelling discharge, fever, persistent cramping, or an increase in bleeding #ReproDemystified
