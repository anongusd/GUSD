@flyingmonkeyair @HealthcareGovIT MN runs their own state Marketplace whose deadline is Dec 20. For those states that use the Federal Marketplace, the deadline is today.
@KimBrunner You also want to update your application every year as it may affect your tax credits and reconciliation every year. For details, visit https://t.co/0fe3XzwTTk
@ccpiddington Yes. A representative will call you to assist you in getting coverage starting Jan 1.
@YureBliss Unfortunately we cannot control fraudulent sites. We try to make sure everybody knows that the Federal Marketplace is strictly https://t.co/Fi2v0zPtCo. Anything else doesn't not represent us.
@YureBliss Contact our Call Center at 800-318-2596 and a representative can help you get coverage. Remember, we are https://t.co/Fi2v0zPtCo. Any other name is not us.
@melibyars Give our Call Center a ring at 800-318-2596 and a representative can help you bypass it.

@KimBrunner No. You may get automatically re-enrolled. However, it would serve you best to check out plans every year to see if there are better options available for you.
@livescare Sorry, no extension. But if you call the Call Center and it asks for your name/number please do so. A representative will call you back after tonight and make sure you get coverage starting Jan 1. 800-318-2596
