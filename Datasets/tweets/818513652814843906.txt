If you care about the rights of women, workers, and people of color, you need to care about who sits on our courts. #CourtsMatter
Many of President Trump's signature policies are being reviewed by federal courts. We must protect their independence. #CourtsMatter
Stephanos Bibas wrote a 60-page article calling for electroshocks and TASER shocks be used to punish prisoners. In 2017, that's chilling.
Rebecca Haywood, an African-American woman, was nominated to the Third Circuit. Republicans blocked her to get Stephanos Bibas on the court.
Federal courts serve as an independent check on the president, so he wants to stack the courts with judges who see things his way.
Republicans have no major legislative accomplishments. That’s why they are laser focused on remaking the federal judiciary. #TrumpJudges
