Like Judge Kavanaugh, I checked my calendar. In the last 1,125 days, I have had only six days where I didn't spend at least part of the day working. And one of those days was because I had the flu and a temperature over 102.  #ButWomenDontWorkHard #MansWorld

Women work just as hard as men outside the home, and then come home to do a majority of the housework and child-rearing. Female senators are not afraid of hard work. Maybe they just don't like the way the Senate Judiciary Committee is run? #ButWomenDontWorkHard #MansWorld
