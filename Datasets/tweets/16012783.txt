Though a trial went on and concluded, the Baron reached out to the press, claiming Taylor was just a fall guy. That’s how he found the reporter of this story. https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
You’d think news of a violent ex-con’s arrest for robbing him would’ve eased the Baron’s mind. Wrong. His old business partner hadn’t hired a hitman? His home wasn’t full of priceless artwork? The coronation isn’t next week? He couldn’t believe it https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
A second tip came in, naming a David Taylor. Sifting through the 55 David Taylors once jailed in the state led him to: David Ray Taylor, convicted murderer and suspected bank robber. https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
5 weeks after the Baron’s alleged attack, his detective got a call from a tipster who led him to a deadbeat who’d bragged that he’d carried out the Baron’s home invasion with an older partner, a guy no one would suspect https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
Taylor had protégés who allegedly helped him escape, developing relay systems for stolen goods and safe houses for stashing https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
Between his parole in 2004 and the time police caught up with him in 2012, Taylor got in trouble but slithered out of jail. Then the bank robberies started https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
Taylor had a violent past. In 1977, he went to prison for killing a gas station attendant with a shotgun. He was caught when his victim used the final minutes of her life to carve his license plate number into her skin https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
Meanwhile, the FBI and regional forces were scrambling to find a bank robber responsible for a spate of recent robberies. They were closing in on an ex-con named David Ray Taylor https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn https://t.co/aMOD0glHOZ
The victims claimed it was all a setup from the Baron’s former business partner, Bill Sikkens, but to one detective, the details made no sense. It looked more like insurance fraud https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
The Baron claims that this lost loot, later valued b/w $180-$250M included: an Annette v. Droste hair necklace, a Crown medal, original manuscripts from Grimm Brothers, two signed copies of "Mein Kampf" https://t.co/tKZXWPMMWn
