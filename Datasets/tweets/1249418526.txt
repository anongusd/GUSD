TODAY @ 2:30 PM ET: @SenateHSGACDems host roundtable on need to strengthen @DEAHQ’s enforcement powers to combat opioid epidemic.		🎥 WATCH LIVE on Facebook: https://t.co/uvBV4OuDA8 https://t.co/Jnz0Q2IKL8
“Shockingly, @DEAHQ has declined to grant permission for Judge Mulrooney to attend in his personal capacity and discuss his recent scholarship. The decision to muzzle a critic of this law is unacceptable, while the #opioid epidemic rages out of control.” https://t.co/7AUtZ0haVc
“Judge Mulrooney has sharply criticized the law as both unnecessary and destructive to @DEAHQ’s enforcement […] given these findings and the unique expertise  Judge Mulrooney has gained from years of adjudicating DEA actions, I invited him to attend my forthcoming roundtable…”
“As you may know, I recently introduced a bill to repeal [a law] which reportedly ‘stripped @DEAHQ of its most potent weapon against large drug companies suspected of spilling Rx narcotics onto the nation’s streets.’” 		https://t.co/oSgcC6ksea

Some families in Texas, like Sergio Garcia’s, are still waiting for government payments for land that was seized almost 10 years ago. https://t.co/bFKhuJHqCC
The impacts of land seizure on American families is real.		Just ask Ray Loop, whose home ended up on the wrong side of border fencing in Texas. “There wasn’t a lending institution that would touch me.” https://t.co/oqF2XUyZ07
❌ Yet even without suitable plans in place, Administration continues moving ahead with border wall preparations. https://t.co/Xwc6seM6is
❌ While CBP told Committee it expected Wall land seizures to take 12-24 mos, that does not match historical precedent. ~90 lawsuits re: land seizures on the border are still pending, many from 2008-09. (3/)
❌ Despite request for $1.6 billion to pay for 74 miles of Wall/fencing in FY18, Administration cannot provide estimates for # of Americans that will have land seized, cost of seizing land, or timeline of land seizures. (2/)
