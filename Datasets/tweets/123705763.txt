@tgjelten @nprnews We hope to see more coverage on this issue that points out these important links.
@tgjelten @nprnews Ex: ppl who refuse rape victims emergency contraception in ER use same argument as ppl who refuse service to gay couples.
@tgjelten @nprnews And this report missed that this is a broader effort to refuse reproductive health care and exclude transgender people.
@tgjelten @nprnews “Religious exercise” was never meant to trample rights of others.
@tgjelten @nprnews Good coverage, but the “clash of rights” frame gives too much ground to anti-LGBTQ &amp; anti-reproductive rights activists.

Veliz was a 5-4 decision finding that term was narrow and applied only to parenting plans entered into in formal dissolution proceedings
The issue in the Veliz case was the meaning of "court-ordered parenting plan"

WA State Coalition Against DV testifying in support
He did this despite signing an order with custody provisions.
The story in the underlying case- Mr Veliz took his daughter out of the country for several months
This bill would better protect victims of DV and their children- even if they don't have a formal parenting plan
Moving testimony by woman whose ex "was Delta Force trained" and nearly drove her and her 3-yr-old into Puget Sound
Custodial interference should apply to residential provisions in any court-ordered parenting plan

50 years after Equal pay Act - in most places women make $0.77 on dollar. We work the first 3 months of year for free 2 make as much as men.
Women were not "given" the right 2 vote. It's something we marched, worked, starved, were ostracized from their families for. #WomenSucceed
