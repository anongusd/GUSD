@RyanLizza What is stunning to me are the 16 other primary candidates that he rigged the system to beat aren‚Äôt speaking out. It points to complete GOP moral rot. I will not support any of them until they purge
@NBCNews @dandeluce What is deeply offensive is the Pence hypocrisy of genuflection at the Trump altar of moral bankruptcy yet considering yourself Christian. Both you beam and applaud every Trump move, affirming and validating the bloody crossroads of corruption and cruelty. SICK

@DanCrenshawTX Dan, I had high hopes for you. That aside for the moment, if a wall is soooo essential, why aren‚Äôt the GOP squealing about a Canadian wall? Why don‚Äôt we hear about visa overstays, the greatest driver of illegals?How do you feel about Kushner‚Äôs sister selling visas to foreigners?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Then gee, where‚Äôs the Canadian wall if it‚Äôs so important?  Pathetic, cheap, D-list, sleazy lounge act.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôd like to remind you that Trump is accountable to all USA not just the deplorables.
@WhiteHouse Applause for outlets cutting coverage of Trump‚Äôs BS propaganda
@JohnJHarwood Kudos to outlets for cutting out of Trump‚Äôs BS session
@JohnCornyn Personal, petty and vindictive lives at 1600 Penn Avenue and you applaud his malice. Pathetic
@Morning_Joe Okay, word warriors, what is s/l bootres? Peggy Noonan?
@WhiteHouse What.  Pence was just bragging about ISIS elimination.
@SecNielsen Weren‚Äôt you in charge for Katrina. How did that go?

@JohnJHarwood I‚Äôm old enough to remember the very first bill passed by the GOP Congress was to ensure mentally ill can get lethal weapons. Karma Scalise. Double karma you‚Äôre saved by a lesbian and black guy.
@RepMarkMeadows I see you got the GOP assignment memo for talking points.
@PhilipRucker Please media, stop giving oxygen to drivel and lies.
@MeetThePress @SenTedCruz Outside beltway and very concerned and even more concerned about Rafael‚Äôs  lack of concern.
@ericbolling Never ever Faux which I consider the equivalent of the National Enquirer and for the lazy, low IQ set.
@DanCrenshawTX Why didn‚Äôt it happen during the two years GOP ran everything?  I had such high hopes for you. Please try harder
@JohnCornyn Why in the world would Pence go to the hill to lobby republicans to vote no to end shutdown. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. This Republican will vote punitively until the stench of Trump is exorcised.
@MarkWarner Pathetic that Pence went to the hill to lobby republicans to reject the vote to open government. I will remember that and vote punitively until all remnants of Trump have been exorcised.
