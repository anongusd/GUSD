But we know that those who seek to undermine our democracy will continue to try with increased frequency and sophistication.
These policies have served California well for years, but since 2016, we‚Äôve done even more. Thankfully, the 2018 election went smoothly.
These include, but aren't limited to, Requiring paper ballots and a voter verified paper trail, requiring voting systems to be kept offline, and requiring post-election audits after every election.
Next, Congress can make the proven best practices for election security the national standard.
While Congress did appropriate $380 million last year in grants to states, that wasn‚Äôt new money ‚Äî and it certainly wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî that was the last of the butterfly ballot and hanging chad money, not 2020 cyber threat funding.
If we truly value our democracy, then we must commit consistent federal funding for election security and administration.
We must INVEST in election administration. The last time Congress approved new funding for elections was 17 years ago, through the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The investments made as a result were by and large in equipment and technology that is now 20 years old.
If we agree that defending the integrity of our elections is a matter of national security, then we must act accordingly. Yet despite the warnings and evidence, our national response is lacking.
The defense of our nation‚Äôs elections must be a top priority for ALL of government ‚Äî federal, state, and local. After all, our democracy is under attack.

Separating children from their families is a disgrace, but this California couple‚Äôs goal of raising $1,500 to reunite these families shows the best of us. The $13 million donated by people throughout the country shows who we really are as a country.	https://t.co/oIYTvfUf0F
This administration has no plan and no timeframe to reunite children with their families. Children were sent all over the country, but they deserve to be with their parents. The crisis Trump crested is far from over.
Don‚Äôt be fooled: Trump‚Äôs executive order doesn‚Äôt fix the inhumane crisis he started. Instead of detaining children separately from their parents, it would indefinitely detain children with their parents and fails to promptly reunite the families that have already been separated.
The 2020 Census will be used for redistricting purposes in 2021. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so critical that Americans are accurately counted in the census. Everyone deserves to be represented fairly.

I challenge you to watch these interviews and then decide how you are going to be part of the solution: https://t.co/AcwBTKXIXK
You can donate money to candidates who support gun safety solutions. You can march. You can call and write letters to your representatives. You can devote your time and energy to electing leaders who walk the walk when it comes to keeping communities safe. And you MUST vote.
If you feel frustrated, deeply upset, or scared for your friends, family, and loved ones, then it's up to you to do something about it. How you help fix this is up to you. But please, for the sake of our children, commit to doing something.
There are elected officials in this country who've pledged to the @NRA NOT to implement any of these commonsense solutions. The absolute truth is that, while they're in office, this problem will not be solved &amp; the epidemic of gun violence in this country will continue unchecked.
There is not a one-size-fits-all solution to gun violence in America. It's an issue that touches every victim and community in different ways. But there are many things that can be done. We owe it to every student and every family in America to at least try.
Today represents yet another tragic reminder of what happens when leaders who are beholden to the @NRA are allowed to lead our country.

We should reject Trump‚Äôs cynical proposal that seeks to erode the very nature of who we are as a country. We are better than this.
Immigrants breathe life, innovation, diversity, and faith into America. New immigrants are the embodiment of the American dream.
Many are like my father who worked as a short order cook and my mother who cleaned houses in order to provide a better life for their kids.
New immigrants have always been the power house of our nation. Arriving with a work ethic &amp; a dream, they've built what we know as America.
Often fleeing oppression &amp; poverty, families from around the world have sought out the US as a beacon of hope. Our nation is better for it.
