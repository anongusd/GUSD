Thank you for the opportunity to submit our thoughts today. Please consider a vote in support of SB19-139 today to truly move Colorado forward.
The financial, economic and safety benefits alone underscore that failing to fix the current funding for additional DMV locations will hurt all of us.
In addition to keeping our premiums from skyrocketing, the program also helps bolster our state economically and is self-funded, with the higher fees charged for the 251 licenses covering the cost of operating the program.
Expanding access of these licenses could save close to $60 million in insurance premiums each year and provide the auto insurance industry $118 million in annual revenue.
...with limited DMV options, once applicants are able to secure an appointment, they have to find a way to get to limited locations no matter where they live in the state.
When the legislation was first enacted, it allowed immigrants to obtain drivers licenses from six DMV locations, making our roads safer. Between 2015-19, the number of offices dwindled to three with one additional to handle renewals and a cap put in place on the program‚Ä¶
Thanks to SB 251 passing in 2013, other Colorado immigrants who meet strict qualification requirements were also given the opportunity to apply for driver‚Äôs licenses...
"My name is Marissa Molina ... I grew up in Glenwood Springs and still vividly remember what it was like before all Colorado residents, regardless of immigration status, could access driver‚Äôs licenses.
Our Colorado State Immigration Manager, @MarisitaMo, submitted testimony the Colorado State Senate Finance Committee in support of SB19-139 - a measure that would expand access to driver‚Äôs licenses to all Coloradans, regardless of immigration status. https://t.co/n2zQBuBJ9R

DACA is an American success story by any measure, and terminating the program would disrupt the lives of 700,000 DACA recipients. What the Trump Administration is attempting to do with this case is to use the Supreme Court for its political ends.
Today, the Supreme Court decided to delay taking action on the Trump Administration‚Äôs case to terminate DACA. There is no good reason for the Supreme Court to consider this case right now, on a rushed timeline.

We urge Dreamers who are eligible to renew their DACA as soon as possible. We also continue to urge Congress to pass permanent protections for Dreamers, so that they can stop living from injunction to injunction. But for today, we will celebrate this important milestone
Dreamers have shown immeasurable courage and bravery as they advocate for the right to continue to contribute to the only country that most of them have ever known. We will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.
Since Sept 5, 2017, the Administration has taken every measure possible to terminate DACA...today‚Äôs news is a huge repudiation of those efforts. DACA has been an incredible success, and lower courts have never found this program to be unlawful. For now, renewals will continue.

The Trump Administration has allowed politics to outweigh costs and dangers of ending #TPS. Admin officials have directed agency staff to ignore evidence of dangerous conditions and rewrite analyses to recommend terminations.
#TPS has strict eligibility requirements including limited registration windows, cutoff dates, background and security checks. TPS holders can't confer their TPS immigration status to family members abroad nor use their TPS as a basis for sponsorship.
#TPS holders are thriving in US while their home countries struggle w/ war, devastation, hunger, &amp; chaos. The US has protected them from civil wars + natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes that have taken the lives of millions, and dangerous conditions remain.

The results of this groundbreaking new research should serve as a wake-up call and a stark reminder of how much work is needed to alleviate the harms caused by America‚Äôs incarceration crisis. 15/16
The trauma of having an immediate family member incarcerated exacts a heavy toll on the physical and mental health of parents, spouses, and children. 14/16 https://t.co/GELgn3MmrY
According to a study from @ellabakercenter 65% of families with incarcerated loved ones were unable to meet basic needs such as food, housing, and medical care while their family member was incarcerated. 13/16
The loss of a family‚Äôs primary income source is highly destabilizing and can push families into financial disaster. 12/16
Families affected by incarceration face steep financial burdens imposed by fines, fees, bail, loss of income and missed child support. 11/16 https://t.co/DutoD1OmUZ
When America‚Äôs families are undermined, our communities and country can‚Äôt reach their full potential. The negative impacts of the incarceration crisis compromise our collective ability to thrive. 10/16
Families living in certain parts of the country feel the effects more than others. 9/16 https://t.co/jaS7rz8ppr
Black and Latino families are also far more likely to experience longer prison sentences. That means black adults are more than three times as likely than white adults to have had a family member spend more than a year in prison or jail. 8/16 https://t.co/OB52scActQ
Already high rates of jailing skyrocket for families with low income or those of color, especially black American families.		Black adults are 50% more likely than white adults to have had an immediate family member incarcerated. 7/16 https://t.co/DO6v0alsir

In summary, The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed changes to public charge:		‚ùåUndermine the American Dream	‚ùåIntentionally creates a chilling effect 	‚ùåAre a backdoor attempt to cut legal immigration 	8/9
Ex: The Admin could deny more than half of all marriage green card applications from US citizens petitioning for their spouse but who don't earn 250% above the federal poverty guidelines. This would force 200,000 couples annually to leave the US or live apart indefinitely. 7/9
Being older than 61 or younger than 18, being diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment, not having private health insurance, having several children, not earning 250% over the federal poverty line, among others. 6/9
The policy also creates an arbitrary criteria of negative weighted factors that would be used to justify denying entry or adjustment of status on public charge grounds. These negative weighted factors include: 5/9
Note: The policy is not retroactive; adjudicators will only look at benefits used after the fate the final rule is published. 4/9
Anyone who has ever accepted public benefits, including those to which they are legally entitled, or who might accept benefits in the future, jeopardizing their attempts to adjust status and creating massive barriers and penalties for millions of new immigrants. 3/9
Under current law, non-citizens can be denied entry or green cards if they are likely to become a public charge, someone ‚Äúprimarily dependent on the government for subsistence.‚Äù The NPRM would expand the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù definition to apply to: 2/9
THREAD		On Oct 10th, the Trump Administration announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to rewrite the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù, which massively expands the public charge test to unfairly punish hundreds of thousands more legal immigrants already living in the US. 1/9

The results of this groundbreaking new research should serve as a wake-up call and a stark reminder of how much work is needed to alleviate the harms caused by America‚Äôs incarceration crisis. 15/16
The trauma of having an immediate family member incarcerated exacts a heavy toll on the physical and mental health of parents, spouses, and children. 14/16 https://t.co/0SW432RfYx
According to a study from @ellabakercenter 65% of families with incarcerated loved ones were unable to meet basic needs such as food, housing, and medical care while their family member was incarcerated. 13/16
The loss of a family‚Äôs primary income source is highly destabilizing and can push families into financial disaster. 12/16
Families affected by incarceration face steep financial burdens imposed by fines, fees, bail, loss of income and missed child support. 11/16 https://t.co/Kr93Kke5UM
When America‚Äôs families are undermined, our communities and country can‚Äôt reach their full potential. The negative impacts of the incarceration crisis compromise our collective ability to thrive. 10/16
Families living in certain parts of the country feel the effects more than others. 9/16 https://t.co/tEI1v4Mx9k
Black and Latino families are also far more likely to experience longer prison sentences. That means black adults are more than three times as likely than white adults to have had a family member spend more than a year in prison or jail. 8/16 https://t.co/cfUBUWTDk3
Already high rates of jailing skyrocket for families with low income or those of color, especially black American families.		Black adults are 50% more likely than white adults to have had an immediate family member incarcerated. 7/16 https://t.co/r7uEScmrMn
While every demographic feels the impact of family incarceration, some families have it far worse than others. 6/16
1 in 7 adults has had an immediate family member stay longer than a year in jail or prison. 5/16 https://t.co/EiG4kBqi78
While short periods of incarceration and long prison sentences pose different challenges for families, both are far too common.		Families are losing too much time. 4/16
The time the incarceration crisis takes from America‚Äôs families cannot be replaced. Whether it‚Äôs one night or a lifetime, a missed holiday meal or a missed childhood, every family impacted by the incarceration crisis feels its negative effects. 3/16 https://t.co/dNpxvZ7X4p
1 in 2 adults in America has had a family member in jail or prison. That‚Äôs 113 million adults in America.		Right now, 6.5 million adults have an immediate family member currently incarcerated in jail or prison.		This is an incarceration crisis. 2/16 https://t.co/m8vboSISoU

In summary, The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed changes to public charge:		‚ùåUndermine the American Dream	‚ùåIntentionally creates a chilling effect 	‚ùåAre a backdoor attempt to cut legal immigration
Ex: The Admin could deny more than half of all marriage green card applications from US citizens petitioning for their spouse but who don't earn 250% above the federal poverty guidelines. This would force 200,000 couples annually to leave the US or live apart indefinitely.
Being older than 61 or younger than 18, being diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment, not having private health insurance, having several children, not earning 250% over the federal poverty line, among others.
The policy also creates an arbitrary criteria of negative weighted factors that would be used to justify denying entry or adjustment of status on public charge grounds. These negative weighted factors include:
Note: The policy is not retroactive; adjudicators will only look at benefits used after the fate the final rule is published.
...anyone who has ever accepted public benefits, including those to which they are legally entitled, or who might accept benefits in the future, jeopardizing their attempts to adjust status and creating massive barriers and penalties for millions of new immigrants.
Under current law, non-citizens can be denied entry or green cards if they are likely to become a public charge, someone ‚Äúprimarily dependent on the government for subsistence.‚Äù The NPRM would expand the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù definition to apply to...
THREAD		On Oct 10th, the Trump Administration announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to rewrite the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù, which massively expands the public charge test to unfairly punish hundreds of thousands more legal immigrants already living in the US.

In summary, The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed changes to public charge:		‚ùåUndermine the American Dream	‚ùåIntentionally creates a chilling effect 	‚ùåAre a backdoor attempt to cut legal immigration 	8/9
Ex: The Admin could deny more than half of all marriage green card applications from US citizens petitioning for their spouse but who don't earn 250% above the federal poverty guidelines. This would force 200,000 couples annually to leave the US or live apart indefinitely. 7/9
Being older than 61 or younger than 18, being diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment, not having private health insurance, having several children, not earning 250% over the federal poverty line, among others. 6/9
The policy also creates an arbitrary criteria of negative weighted factors that would be used to justify denying entry or adjustment of status on public charge grounds. These negative weighted factors include: 5/9
Note: The policy is not retroactive; adjudicators will only look at benefits used after the fate the final rule is published. 4/9
Anyone who has ever accepted public benefits, including those to which they are legally entitled, or who might accept benefits in the future, jeopardizing their attempts to adjust status and creating massive barriers and penalties for millions of new immigrants. 3/9
Under current law, non-citizens can be denied entry or green cards if they are likely to become a public charge, someone ‚Äúprimarily dependent on the government for subsistence.‚Äù The NPRM would expand the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù definition to apply to: 2/9
THREAD		On Oct 10th, the Trump Administration announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to rewrite the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù, which massively expands the public charge test to unfairly punish hundreds of thousands more legal immigrants already living in the US. 1/9

One thing that hasn‚Äôt changed since we started, however, is the fact that we‚Äôre still laser focused on solutions. In addition to our policy work in D.C., here are some of the ways we‚Äôre getting stuff done.
You don‚Äôt have to look far to see the substantial harm these failed systems are having on our families and communities. The despicable separation of parents and their children at the border is only the most recent example.
We see these two issues ‚Äî immigration and criminal justice ‚Äî as two sides of the same coin. Neither system functions as it should. Both are a drag on our economy and cause substantial harm to families. Polls show that a clear majority of Americans believe we must do better.
A lot has changed in over five years. The political landscape is even more contentious. But our commitment to moving America forward hasn‚Äôt wavered. We were founded to work on immigration reform and since, have expanded our mission to include fighting for criminal justice reform.
.@FWDus was founded, back in 2013, by leaders in the tech and business communities. Why? Because they saw a need ‚Äî and an opportunity ‚Äî to help find bipartisan solutions to policies that were keeping people across this country from reaching their full potential.
Last Friday's ruling was welcome news for Dreamers but opponents of DACA will continue to work to end the program. 		If you have DACA or had DACA in the past, we encourage you to contact an attorney &amp; renew. Visit #InformedImmigrant for a helpful guide. 	https://t.co/AIW4m5uMos

This kind of logistical work sure isn‚Äôt glamorous - but it‚Äôs incredibly critical because a majority of Americans believe that families belong together, and it absolutely has to get done to meaningfully support families during this crisis. Anything you can contribute helps. [9/10]
And people just like you are making this possible in different states across the country. Thanks to this support, we‚Äôve been able to help reunite hundreds of families. [8/10]
Providing basic resources like clothing, cell phones, and toys for young children and providing ongoing support and services after the family is reunited. [7/10]
Coordinating flight plans and other emergency transportation to reunite children and parents as quickly as possible. [6/10]
Meeting children and parents at the time of their release so they know they‚Äôre not alone -- then providing a warm meal, a shower, and any other immediate support they need. This happens thanks to the established work of Lutheran Social Services of the Southwest. [5/10]
Our urgent work here in Phoenix involves a lot of details and support. Here is what we have been up to: [4/10]
