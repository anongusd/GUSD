@redhotnerd @AmandaMarcotte Your analysis is spot on in my view.    What isn't known is .....  does his better name recognition give him the advantage over others who passed on challenging Hillary in 2016?   I believe it may.    With California looming early rather than last, new dynamics are at work
@redhotnerd @FungeonMaster1 @AmandaMarcotte I agree.  Their overlap will force one to step back pretty early in this nomination contest
@FungeonMaster1 @redhotnerd @AmandaMarcotte I don't characterize the Democratic leaders seeking the nomination for president as "dingbats" with "non-platforms"		Neither is accurate,  and certainly doesn't move understanding forward.
@WolvesforKamala @AmandaMarcotte You make a caricature out Bernie's base on race and sex.  That was why i posted he got 13 million votes - they were not all white or male. Come on now. That won't build party unity for the BIG TENT Democrats need to win. I will support the Democratic nominee. Keep the tent open!

@InSpiteOfTrump it's amazing what prescription drug stimulants can do to liven up a 72 year old living on a diet designed for heart attack and stroke.  Eventually those will collide with adverse consequences.  Instead we'll get more gross lies about Trump's medical condition from his MD Friday.

@JRubinBlogger @eden_vox it is a tactical mistake		Democrats have a bad habit of trying to shrink their Big Tent to one that only holds centrists cozy to Wall Street and well-insured.   Bernie expanded the Democratic tent.  Those same centrists want it shrunk small enough to lose again by their actions
Bernie Sanders plans a post SOTU response as well.  Marvelous.		Since when in America can we have only one voice raised in opposition to the likes of Trump. Neither Harris nor Sanders diminishes Abrams' address in any way.  3 strong voices raising concerns about Trump is better!!
I continue to be disappointed that people looking forward to responses to the SOTU  seem to believe only one voice may be raised for that purpose.	@RoseBeckley @staceyabrams will be fabulous.   Kamala Harris apparently plans a "prequel" address.   Wonderful!!
@errollouis Why should Bernie not say his piece?   1st Amendment suspended?  Only "real" Democrats may talk in response? No one else?		The world will survive more than one SOTU response.  I look forward to remarks by Harris,  Abrams, AND Bernie.  They're all on the same side, bottom line
@maramcewin @MyGrannyTheGeek Your post re Bernie Sanders is unfair and inaccurate.  The OTHER SIDE OF TRUMP? You think that fair?		He's no saint.  But his heart and integrity are unimpeachable.

@renato_mariotti it isn't the public evidence that is of concern.   It's the evidence known to prosecutors on Mueller's team,  the SDNY Feds, and the NY AG		They're smart enough to charge under RICO and deal with complicated law as well.   They will choose the most compelling legal approach. YAY!
Shep Smith on Fox  fact-checks and corrects his colleague, Chris Wallace, 		on responsibility for the federal government shut down		Kudos to Mr. Smith for presenting truth!		https://t.co/tf1pQCyD4o	@RoseBeckley @Millgrist1
@MSDeptofRevenue    Robert E Lee was a traitor to the US, caused more American deaths than Hitler. We shoulda hung that bastard at Appomattox Courthouse.		How dare you stain the national Dr Martin Luther King holiday with praise 4 the man who sought to keep King enslaved? Shame!! https://t.co/qUxMxtuqO7
@realDonaldTrump You're correct @potus.  So if you'd quit lying to the American people,  let truth cross your lips, most of that fake news would disappear.		You are the biggest source of misinformation, even more so than Russian trolls.  Imagine that.  You lie so much, you're the queen of crooks
@SenMajLdr   Mitch - time to put nation about partisanship.   Time to put America before Russia.   Time to honor your oath to the US Constitution, not your pledges to those who bribed you to act insanely as Majority Leader.  Re-open OUR GOVERNMENT!!! https://t.co/4F5oOFnKPI
btrw,  the Buzzfeed story is largely accurate. The Special Counsel (not your friend btw)  only disputed details of the report corroboration, not the central conclusion.   		You betrayed the US and lied lied lied about it		Karma's coming around with the attitude of a woman scorned
Doesn't matter what you say or do today, Donald T@potus		The Women marching all across the US today are the only important story		You became irrelevant after it was revealed that you betrayed the United States conspiring with Russia		We're just waiting for justice to take U away
@DonaldJTrumpJr let's go one better, Donald Jr.   Let's mail those bricks to your home,  where you can ensure they are transported to the perfect place for more wall,  though that might be the jail you and daddy will soon occupy, just saying.
@supmikeclines 		The misconduct of your school's students,  harassing fellow Americans engaged in their First Amendment Right of free speech is beneath contempt.		They act this way though they attend a "Christian"  school? One where the Gospel of Jesus is core?  You lead them!
@thehill I suspect he has simply  heard Martin Luther Coon way too often among whites in his community,   and it did pop out thoughtlessly.     NOT harmlessly though.		It is still highly racist

@StevenBeschloss Sen Collins seems intent to resurrect from the dead a female stereotype  .....		a woman who can't make up her mind.		I had hoped we beat that myth to death long ago.  Collins is an exception that confirms that stereotype among shallow thinking voters.  She's doing a lot of damage
@thinkprogress how smart can this fella be?   Takes on a no-win hypothetical,  then suggests a position that guarantees just about everyone wants to piss on Ben's leg for his remarks		Ben would have done better to read Richard Scarry books to small children,  leave abortion politics to adults
Meanwhile,  on the border where there IS one of Trump's "impenetrable" walls ....		@RoseBeckley @Millgrist1 @potus     hundreds of migrants crawl through tunnel under Trump's wall to gain entry into the USA https://t.co/P94hDwSsLn
I have 3 fresh votes (mine,  Rose's, a guest on #AMJOY)  - we all vote that Trump release his tax returns now		Anyone agree? Let's raise Trump's consciousness (note i didn't suggestion conscience - that doesn't exist)		@potus  release your tax retuns as you promised	@RoseBeckley
@Lady_Star_Gem @nasty_woman2 You deny a woman her voice because she isn't brown enough?  Seriously?  No one has silenced Kamala Harris.  Sarandon was expressing her view - and she's correct - Harris was no progressive when a public attorney, that's her real record		Let's not silence friends we disagree with
@SusanSarandon @nytimes True,  but coming from you makes it harder to push the point.		You didn't help progressive causes ripping on Hillary Clinton in 2016.		You won't help progressive causes ripping on center and left leaning ambitious candidates now		Save your venom for Trump and his criminals
@nickconfessore Arrest those clowns for interfering with 1st Amendment rights, set them on cleaning national park rest rooms until all are useable again
@alikat747 @morgfair Except for the 2 brown migrant children we let die in our hands.  They don't count to Trump, Pence, Nielsen. Too brown donchaknow .....ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
