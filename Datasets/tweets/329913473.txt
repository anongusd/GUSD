Switching to law has been weird. Compared to journalism, school rank and grades are way more important.
Also unpaid internships were a major barrier. How else were you going to get your foot in the door?
Just doing good work wasn‚Äôt really enough unless you had someone to vouch for you to get your application out of the pile. So you had to network and hustle.
My experience in journalism was that people didn't usually care where you went to school (except for David Bradley, owner of the Atlantic, who cared A LOT). That meant though that personal connections were important.

@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt There are all kinds of ways in which the legal field is unfair to people from low-income backgrounds or without connections or from minority groups. I just think there are more important fights than elite clerks not getting paid enough.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt Anyone in BigLaw is in the top 1% of earners. We're talking about the difference between $2M and $1.9M over 8 years (assuming 2 clerkships without SCOTUS). The person who made $1.9M is not exactly struggling. They get a bonus regardless, it's just not as big.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt The reason I chimed in on this thread is b/c I just thought it was kinda crazy that anyone would skip a SCOTUS clerkship for money, when that's basically a guaranteed half million dollars the year after.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt And the whole clerkship hiring process is totally crazy and definitely favors people with connections. I just don't think the big problem here is that SCOTUS clerks aren't making enough money in the long run.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt And a bigger problem than clerkships is probably public interest jobs. Can only law graduates from wealthy families afford careers that help others? Clerkships are just a year or 2, not a whole career.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt My point is I don‚Äôt think we should let RBG or other judges off the hook by saying there aren‚Äôt interested minority candidates.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt I just doubt there are many low-income students forgoing SCOTUS clerkships because of $. If you‚Äôre going to biglaw anyway, the payout is going to be big (even if you don‚Äôt land SCOTUS). I don‚Äôt think the marginal difference is that much in the long run.
@Resistance2Red @ASharon004 @dylanmatt Ok but that article suggests the discrepancy is due to for-profit schools, which I don't think are really in play in SCOTUS clerkships...
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt But I totally agree about how unpaid internships for undergrads contribute to lack of diversity in fields like journalism. And the clerkship hiring process is absurd for all kinds of other reasons.
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt I just think other factors play a bigger role in lack of diversity in clerks. Just about everyone has law school debt, so they face the pay trade-off. If you clerk and go to big law it's not like you're exactly going to be destitute.
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt You're assuming 2 years of clerkships? I was counting the first year salary of big law. In any case, I agree you come out ahead by going straight to a firm. But what's the solution? Courts aren't going to pay the same as firms.
Pretty excited for the Lady Gaga remake of Stop Making Sense by the Talking Heads https://t.co/8xDjtPUS8T
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt Ok, but making $50k + $50k + $200k vs $190k + $200k is a pretty first world dilemma.
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt Lack of diversity is a real problem in clerkships, but my hunch is it has more to do with white male judges from fancy backgrounds hiring people like themselves. Plus the lack of transparent statistics or external pressure on them to do better.
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt Even district and circuit court clerkships get a $50k bonus at firms though. Plus these are paid positions.
@ASharon004 @dylanmatt I agree about internships but doesn't really apply to clerkships. Standard bonus at a firm for former SCOTUS clerk is something like $300k. So I don't think the problem is a lack of interested candidates.

@GusHurwitz @brettglass @bskorup @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC So everyone who argued Pai should remain silent must be pretty outraged now that he's commented?
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC That seems to me like something only the head of the FCC can promise.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Journos can explain law or how FCC has worked in the past. But can they promise Trump won't use the FCC to punish critics?
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC I guess I just disagree that it's NBD when POTUS calls journos "enemies of the people" and contemplates using gov to shutdown outlets.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Not everyone is as steeped in FCC process or Pai's past statements.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Just emphasizing that the FCC is independent from the WH, will follow the law and respect the const seems worthwhile.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC There‚Äôs a lot of (imho, legit) fear that we have a president who doesn‚Äôt respect the rule of law, who will bully political opponents.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC But couldn‚Äôt he just explain how the process works and that the FCC is not going to yank licenses just bc Trump told him to?
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC I get why he shouldn‚Äôt promise to renew all NBC affiliates or something like that. And yes, not a perfect analogy to NN.
@GusHurwitz @bskorup @BerinSzoka @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC I get diff b/w adjudication &amp; rulemaking. But seems esp important to emphasize fairness, const rights, &amp; pol independence in adjudications.
@bskorup @BerinSzoka @GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Interesting, I hadn't heard about that rule.
@iPolicy @GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC But maybe they can reassure the public that the president doesn‚Äôt do FCC policy via Twitter?
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Seems to me a broad statement about free speech &amp; political independence would be fine. But maybe I'll learn differently in admin law.
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Also, he didn't have a problem expressing policy views after Obama weighed in on net neutrality https://t.co/u1CpdfMCVx
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC The claim that asserting his independence would undermine his independence is, at least, counterintuitive...
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC And this isn‚Äôt just someone on the internet being wrong‚Äî this is the president asking him specifically to break the law.
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Courts seem different because they never comment on anything (outside of their decisions)
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC He would just be restating views he's already expressed. But the point is those views haven't changed following POTUS tweets.
@GusHurwitz @JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU @FCC Couldn't he just say something like: the FCC doesn't take directions from POTUS and I promise we will respect the law &amp; the Constitution?
@JeffEisenach @ProfWrightGMU Is there some downside I‚Äôm not seeing to reassuring journalists &amp; station owners?
@AjitPaiFCC I dunno though, I think the real ‚Äúhot take‚Äù is saying it shows independence to stay quiet when free speech is threatened.

@fmanjoo So ISPs willing to agree to some version of NN to permanently block other regs down the line. That's how I see the strategy at least.
@fmanjoo Q is if broadband is the equivalent today.
@fmanjoo 80 yrs ago, US decided phones should be subject to extensive regulation bc they were such an essential service.
@fmanjoo I don't think it's a bluff. They're willing to give a little on NN to permanently handcuff the FCC on internet issues more broadly.

@BrianDietz @MikeIsaac Consumer perception matters though for whether it's reasonable to say broadband isn't a telecom service
@MikeIsaac Agency decisions can't be arbitrary &amp; must be based on evidence. How consumers view their ISP is important piece of evidence.

@ProfDanielLyons @b_fung @binarybits @AjitPaiFCC Ah interesting, thanks. I'm not following all the press releases like I used to.
@ProfDanielLyons @b_fung @binarybits Makes sense. Still seems like an argument ISP lawyer could make to fight any enforcement action though.
@ProfDanielLyons @b_fung @binarybits My theory is Rs will use lack of privacy regulator as carrot to get Ds to negotiate on net neutrality.
@ProfDanielLyons @b_fung @binarybits And is there any case law on "substantially the same?" My understanding is CRA has never been tested.
@ProfDanielLyons @b_fung @binarybits Will Pai enact FCC rules modeled on FTC standard though?
@b_fung @binarybits My point is just that it's a bit misleading to say this preserves status quo, since having no regulator at all is new.
@b_fung @binarybits "return jdx" sounds like Congress. Plus, I'm not sure FCC can do much of anything on ISP privacy after this CRA.
@binarybits He wants Congress to overturn Title II and restore FTC authority, right? Or has he said the FCC will enforce FTC-like rules?
@binarybits Seems important though that ISPs used to be subject to FTC enforcement ‚Äî and Google, FB, etc still are.
Strong statement from a Republican who voted against killing the FCC privacy rules https://t.co/urfKMyjNHO
@byersalex Right, it just gives them extra leverage in the negotiation. An extra chip on the table.
@byersalex Even if Ds win the WH in 2020, how do they ever restore ISP privacy? CRA blocks FCC. Seems like they'd need legislation.
@byersalex I'm guessing they wouldn't offer full FCC rules. But now they can blame Dems for the gap in FTC privacy power.
How long until Republicans offer to restore ISP privacy regulations in exchange for rolling back net neutrality?

@fmanjoo @digiphile In this case, the public has strong feelings about net neutrality. And the FCC‚Äôs job is to act in the public interest.
@fmanjoo @digiphile Usually, it's companies commenting to FCC about how they would be affected. And agency does respond to their concerns.
