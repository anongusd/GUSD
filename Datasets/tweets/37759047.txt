@danRiehl -- I added that sentence we discussed -- and link -- for clarity re: Nikki's mom defending Weiner. All so bizarre. thanks.

@jashsf  I did not make those connections. Just reporting what I know. Being clear about what I don't know. More work to do. More to come.
@mikemadden59 It is just sooooo weird. I talked to MikeS yesterday and he agrees all very strange.
@mikemadden59 Where were you at 1 a.m. when we were having a spirited debate? Haven;t stayed up that late in years. :)
@mikemadden59  I will let @tommyxtopher take that question. I checked with CA DMV officials. School officials. RE records. Fake.
@CtLiberalMom  I don't know anything about that. Breitbart did not pursue the story about the two hs girls. By then,, Meaghan B appeared.

@LauraWalkerKC Since they said they were from LA that's where i looked. Woudl love to compare notes.
Am fading. Time for rest. Loved the questions and spirited conversation. More tomorrow? Again, am glad that @tommyxtopher asked for the i.d.
@AceofSpadesHQ Not me. Rule no. 1 of a hack. Usually, you lose control of acct. Someone else has password.
@jashsf  I don't think dan wolfe had anything to do with this.
@AceofSpadesHQ  If you can produce these ladies, I will buy them ice cream and hotdogs at Coney Island :) p.s. but I want DNA tests.
@jdonels also didn't live at address provided and their "mother" provided a fake CA driver's license,  per CA DMV. #fake
@RocksEm  Veronica and Betty did provide i.d. - hollywood high. I checked w/hollywood high.No students. Checked address provided: Fake.
@AceofSpadesHQ  they said the real one and they had no intention of being anonymous....because they were fake.
@LauraWalkerKC went down the Arkansas road.....checked it out. not the "girls"

@AceofSpadesHQ Hmmmm. Interesting theory. Woudl love to know more.
@AceofSpadesHQ  We have to find out what was she talking about? Weiner? Her "featured dancer" agent? Who?
@AaronWorthing Just the begining... I think we all need to continue reporting it out. All of us...Too many questions. Weird.
@AceofSpadesHQ I can not speculate about anyone's motives. Can not even begin. All too weird. But let's find out!
Hey everyone, @tommyxtopher got the driver's license. Not me. Thank goodness he did. That helped establish Betty Veronica are fake.
@Inb4daPop  It is not the UFO lady
@RocksEm I know. That's why I follow you. What other questions should we be asking.
@RocksEm  untrue. maybe someone else did not me. :)from the beginning, it seemed so weird. don't you think? had to  keep asking questions.

@RocksEm  He talked to mother on phone. And he took extra step..the driver's license. Most reporters would not do that.

@JATetro  thank you for the information. it is an important issue.
RT @facebookdc "We're humbled to be part of the democratic process, and we'll keep welcoming members of both parties to engage on Facebook."
During successful livestream event for Facebook & Pres, Obama, I asked if other candidates will get same opportunity:@facebookdc replied....

Note: RT @tigerbeat:Don't forget Bush did a FB townhall pushing his book. I imagine there will be events w/other Pres candidates
RT @ekvraga Like the idea of Obama's Town Hall, but he could take better advantage of format with more interaction (& shorter answers).
