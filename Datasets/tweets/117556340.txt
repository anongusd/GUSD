"We need to reinstate proper reimbursement for + public health programs around LC screening." -Dr. Mayfield #LCPolicy
"Personalize treatment to a patient level, not just a group level." - Dr. Brahmer #LCPolicy
65% of us have lung nodules. LC screening is an annual scan. We look for nodule changes to decide on a biopsy. #LCPolicy
For those newly dx, educate yourself and your family members. Ask "Was my tumor tested?" #LCPolicy

"#lungcancer is not what it used to be. It has different faces." -Dr. Brahmer @HopkinsMedicine #LCPolicy
New tests allow us to test blood, rather than a tissue biopsy, to diagnose and help guide tx decisions. #LCPolicy
