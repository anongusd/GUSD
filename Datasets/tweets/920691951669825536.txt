"Just be kind. If you see someone that's always looking down walking, doesn't talk to anyone, maybe they need someone to talk to," Dave added.
Psychologist Dr. Wendy Rice says those sorts of interactions, while subtle, can make all the difference for a troubled child.  "Anything that makes somebody feel seen and valued, and connect; that social connection is so valuable," Dr. Rice said.
"It was a clash of emotion. It was her words being the good angel and my feelings being the devil. It was literally a clash, man," he continued.
"When I was finally going to pull it out, what she said kept going through my head and I didn't," he recalled.  Dave says that simple moment of kindness kept him from joining a list that includes the Columbine killers, the Sandy Hook shooter, and Nicholas Cruz in Parkland.
Than anyone else around me.  What stopped him.  He says it was a conversation with a guidance counselor, who was unaware that he was armed just a couple of class periods earlier. She told him high school does not last forever -- and to get an education and just move on.
Dave's story may be more important now than ever/He first shared it with radio host Drew Garabo. "I was at a pep rally with a loaded gun, three clips. I was going to take out the ones that tortured me," he told Garabo. "I just wanted to solve my problem and I had bigger problems
Years ago, back in high school just outside of Chicago, the man we're calling Dave says he nearly became the next one.  "From a young age, I was bullied, I was jumped. Often, I was beat [sic] up. And then, in 2002 it came to a head," he said.
Why have so many school shooters snapped? FOX 13 spoke with a man who nearly became one, but had a change of heart at the last minute. He's helping shed light on what can be the tipping point for a young person on the edge.

Studies have suggested The academy also warns against harsh verbal abuse including shaming kids, citing research linking it with depression and behavior problems in teens.
Other studies have linked physical punishment in childhood with later brain changes in young adults including reduced gray matter and elevated levels of stress hormones. Suicidal behavior, substance abuse and anger are among other potential long-term consequences of spanking,
Studies published in the past two decades have bolstered evidence that spanking can make young kids more aggressive and defiant.

We're taught that such 'judgments' do not belong..      	       We can get our condoms and birth controls, 	Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles...	But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,   	No word of God must reach this crowd.      	   	It's scary here I must confess,

The law is specific, the law is precise.   	Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.   		For praying in a public hall    	Might offend someone with no faith at all..  	In silence alone we must meditate,    	God's name is prohibited by the State..      		We're allowed to cuss  &amp;
under God 	Finds mention of Him very odd.    	        If scripture now the class recites, 	It violates the Bill of Rights.	And anytime my head I bow 	Becomes a Federal matter now.     	       Our hair can be purple, orange or green,   	That's no offense; it's a freedom scene..
