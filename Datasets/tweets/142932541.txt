@RalphNortham you‚Äôre explaination of murdering an infant is evil. You think it‚Äôs ok to kill a baby? Next year it will be ok to kill granny when she is inconvenient to us. And dude, you are pretty close to granny‚Äôs age.  Think about it.
@KamalaHarris Oh good Lord. What is happening here is a choice. No one is forcing any of these opioids on people. Unlike gang violence, not being able to choose your doctor, depleting Social Security, killing babies. You are a piece of work Kamala Harris.

@Gimpmaker @shrimpchew @Ronutan @MurcanIdealist @nytdavidbrooks It‚Äôs not fair to the people doing it appropriately. But when politiicans have an agenda they will allow or do anything. America has been cheapened in the last 30 years of political play.
@Gimpmaker @shrimpchew @Ronutan @MurcanIdealist @nytdavidbrooks I have a friend from India in the same situation.
@Nedbruce3 @MurcanIdealist @nytdavidbrooks And if it was, theybhave as much right to chant as Phillips does yo beat the drum.  His rights do not over ride the rights of the kids. We have a major problem on this country and it‚Äôs called inability to problem solve. If you don‚Äôt like the chanting go somewhere else.
@Gimpmaker @shrimpchew @MurcanIdealist @nytdavidbrooks I agree with you. So over it.

@o2bnhvn @Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain That‚Äôs what I saw. Were there adults with this group of kids? That should be the question. The video is 8 minutes long. Why didn‚Äôt one of the chaperones step in and pull the kid away from the guy? Not a good situation. They shouldn‚Äôt suspend the kid.
@Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain I just hope the poor kid doesn‚Äôt get suspended over something adults started and the media flipped and then blew out of proportion. Would be life changing experience for the kid. They need to leave him alone. I think he acted appropriately especially under the circumstances.
@Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain If I were the parent of any of this kids I would want to know where the school chaperones were, to help keep those kids safe. The Indian and black guys we‚Äôre being jerks and trying to incit problems. One of the blacks said- why don‚Äôt you go back to Europe where you came from.
@Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain Hold on, we‚Äôre on the same page here. What I see is the kids were just being kids, hanging out. I think the guy beating the drum is being a bit aggressive. The kid looks uncomfortable &amp; embarrassed. He doesn‚Äôt say anything. The other kids seem to be just moving to the Rythm.
@alvarofer @Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain @CosmoDiGirolamo Nice. That‚Äôs not racist at all.
@Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain Because they are kids. Kids do those things. Especially a group of boys.
@SamRitter5000 @Lavana14185681 @baseballcrank @willchamberlain Looks to me like the kid is being harraased. He looks uncomfortable and is not being disrespectful in the first part of the video. I haven‚Äôt watched all 8 mins of this. I believe I would be upset if I were his parents. How old is he?

@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN And I don‚Äôt give a rats behind what Murkowski said or did. Alaska will be voting her butt out. Just because she‚Äôs a senator doesn‚Äôt mean her option is better than mine.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN The truly crazy thing is that you support a Muslim. You need to be reading up on Sharia Law, Female genital mutilation, and the Muslim men who rape women. What are the statistics on that?? You keep supporting them and you‚Äôll find out that Allah hates all who don‚Äôt follow him.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN You can tout your averages all you want, but the fact is that there is till a margin of men who are accused falsely and Kavanaugh is one. Now I‚Äôm done.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN He was falsely accused of horrible things that he did not do. He &amp; his family had death threats, his reputation was ruined. You insist that when a woman accuses a man that he should be crucified. There are many men who have been falsely accused. Innocent before proven guilty.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN That is referring to relationships with women/men. He did not even know the women making the accusations. You‚Äôre grasping at nothing here.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN To support what she said re Kavanaugh. He had 7 FBI investigations &amp; what you are accusing him of never came out. What I do know is that The Dems will do what ever they can to get what ever they want and everything about Ford points to crooked. Innocent before proven guilty.
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN I do not know the statistics surrounding rape. I‚Äôve worked with kids who have raped and been raped. I wanted to hurt the attacker, and I helped to an attacker recieve help. As far as Kavanaugh, I believe in the presumption of innocence. Fords entire team could find no one to....
@ricknelsonmn1 @IlhanMN The allegations were not credible. Saying they are does not make it so.
@inb4RussianBot @IlhanMN And female genital mutilation, which is occurring secretly  between Michigan and Minnesota.  And Sharia Law is being pushed in certain areas. The Koran calls for murder if anyone who does not believe in Allah.
