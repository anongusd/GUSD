@alanlovespoetry Over 20 years ago, I wasn't home when that midnight call came to me.  Yes, walking through our house waiting for him to come from another room... it was the most endless moment of my life.   This poem strikes that same cord, thanks Alan.
@byMorganWright I love my books, but ebooks are sometimes nice when I can increase the type size.  I do both :)

@StephenKing He's nothing and we will not let him put us in this state of fear!  We American's are better then him, and stronger.  Years from now the only thing left will be the history books that will tell of his time as president.  May they show how we took back america after he was gone.
@HennyMehrhoff @Peesbeewitu @StephenKing In other words... we need to have a "Trump Free Day".  A few of them, lots of them in a row.  He'd totally go bonkers if life all of a sudden wasn't about him and he couldn't keep lying.

@paulmac708 I'm not a fan of his and he needs to be impeached.  They just showed the rest of him in Pittsburgh and the people standing asking him to leave ... depending on what your watching they cut out portions and put fake people behind him.  Sorry you had to view him like that :(.
@paulmac708 Paul, they can't show everyone on one picture screen.  Know that there are others that don't want his political 'person' there.  News media needs to shut him down.  Don't put anything on the air that has to do with him for 2 days.... he'd go crazy.

@_NotFakeNews_ She needs to be twitterized... get out and find another place to  socailizing.

@StephenKing Life is so grotesque at times :).. or maybe a grotesque vacation.  Awesomely grotesque wouldn't do it either.
@Cat59378360 @RealMuckmaker It means our country is in distress.  It is.... Every filthy thought he's come out with, every hate filled way of solving things.  Our country doesn't need his kind.

@HillaryClinton Rest in Peace Matthew.  Thank you Hilary for sharing this with us.
@StephenKing Mr. King, he could be your next thriller novel.  Then  we'll make it a reality TV show.  He's putting fear and violence back in place that took years to break through, and our master-peace wasn't yet perfected, but it was getting there.  What is left behind will be years to fix.
@DildyDan The sad thing is that some of them aren't making money. They're the ones that will always blame it on something else, not a republican in office.  They're ignorant people who watch Fox News and believe it.  Trump is the new reality tv for most of them.
@TheEllenShow Oh Ellen.. :) Your going to want to know me when I win the Mega Billions :) tonight .. ((hugs)).

@NateMaingard :) smiling at your reply Nate.  But my concern is when it causes a sick mind to go out and harm innocent people because of what their eyes have viewed, that is a very serious concern and why some of the most beautiful and private things in life are kept  away from public view.
@NateMaingard What a wonderful feeling if we could all wear our birthday suits and look within and not at ones person.  It is such a fantastic way of thinking that I'd hate to smear it with anything but the beauty that is US. But the mind is the game keeper, some find lust and not pure spirit.

@mitchmp @ctophertaylor @bansisharma @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Trumps watch screwed up and our tax dollars will pay for those DNA tests to be done.  If he would have left the children with their parents this would never be happening.
@bansisharma @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Your tax dollars at work Bansi.. Trump screws up again and we're paying for those DNA tests!!!  None of it would have happened if he wouldn't have signed the order to take those babies from their parents!  Do you get it now???
@fortyforfour @HomemadeMonster Dear Son... this world isn't about your mama and 'me' anymore, its about YOU. It's about what your going to do to make a difference.  Even if you don't see the difference right away, it'll come.  It's like a change jar.. put a little in and eventually you'll reach your goal.

@KamalaHarris I believe this is a criminal issue and that the people holding hostage these children need to be arrested! Go right to the top officials who gave the go ahead to do this.  Each one of them including our president should be held accountable.

@Dannaja64Danny @DeniseHollar @KartikG85 @BarackObama As great as this sounds... don't turn your back on the enemy.  Trump is a pig in mud, he needs to get away from our enemies, they aren't our friends and never will be.  There's a method to their madness and they're using a Madman named Trump to get what they want.
@TomSteyer First thing that came to my mind was concentration camps!  What is this president doing.. cruel and unusual punishment to Children.

@welcomet0nature Where's the cat!!!
@HomemadeMonster @Dax_x98 @realDonaldTrump I've been on a low key mode the past 2 months.  I couldn't shake my head anymore not understanding why people thought this guy made a great president... He can't even understand what he reads.  Once I've told him to take me off the 'do not call list', his ears will be burning.
@Dax_x98 @HomemadeMonster @realDonaldTrump I would tell him to take the high road and step down from the office of president of the United States.  Let someone else who knows what they're doing take over.  I would then tell him to take me off his call list, I am on the federal 'do not call list'!!

If you want a book to read or download I recommend Fire and Fury.  Its an amazing book for ANYONE.  Weather you support who is in office right now or don't.  You know all the characters after weekly publicity, get the book and be educated!!  Great Read.

@KamalaHarris All he wants is his wall.  He is wall crazy and if we let him have that wall any one who doesn't believe in him will be behind the same walls that Hitler built :( .

@leedsgarcia @TheDemocrats It happened for a reason, it'll come back more powerful.  Don't crush your trust in the Democrates.. they'll get this.  Primary reason for this shut down was because they didn't have a budget... (4 months and not budget... what a business man!) ... all other things are on hold.

@StephenKing A friend of mine who refuses to 'get it' said : "He was voted for as president and I stick behind our president".  Well, I said... "So if they voted on someone and he said he was going to bit your toenails off, you'd stand behind him then"?  ... No comment.
@TomSteyer Thank you so much for helping all of America.  You and your staff give us a light at the end of the tunnel.
