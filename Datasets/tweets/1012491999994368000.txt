@fourliebs @CNNPolitics You would never be happy would you?
@OfficialCBC @RepBeatty @RepGregoryMeeks @howardlawschool @FSCDems @HFACDemocrats Diversity isn't necessarily good. We should learn how to work in a diverse environment, but not create or force a diverse environment.
@GAMWebDesign @runlab @NBCNews Oh I get it. I was thinking you were the person I asked why to.
@GAMWebDesign @runlab @NBCNews So why is it wrong if the truth will come out?
@RepHanabusa Delicious identity politics.
@RepAlGreen They also fought for the right not to vote.
@mariannvogt1 @SenatorMenendez @realDonaldTrump Like all Democrats silenced Kavenaugh during his confirmation hearing. Hardly ever let him finish speaking. Shameful.
@sosillyano @thehill Men too.
@runlab @NBCNews Why?
@NBCNews Obama?
@SkepBy Going to work now. Been fun. Bye.
@smirnoff_sprite @SugarPineSe7en @thehill Agree. But this is a criminal allegation. Or is it just a political smearing?
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI You are just proving how gullible you are.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Misled? Sounds like perjury to me.		Can you find one instance you can quote the entire email and entire statement and compare them to justify your claim? No, you cant. It doesn't exists.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI All of that is debunked. Don't believe shit media sources.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Read the headline carefully. APPEARS
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Exactly. She didn't file charges. So now it's public opinion. This is my opinion.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Innocent until proven guilty.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI He has not lied under oath. Even most liberal media outlets have claried that.		You just believe tabloid crap. Got it
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Did it look like every Democrat senator that was curting off kavenaugh multiple times during his hearing? Should we boot them out if the senate since they don't allow men to speak? Sounds dumb, eh?
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI No. I don't watch that crap.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Your definition of tons of proof would not hold up in a court. Not even close.
@DOW_Oct_2018 @RepAdamSchiff Might want to Google fascist. Don't think you understand the meaning.
@RepAdamSchiff You don't care about children now? Confused.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI You are assuming what the charges would be.		I get it. You think he's a horrible man based on no proof. No need to keep telling me.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI I've read it. There is depending on the charge. Read it again.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI She has not reported the crime. Also depending on the charge there could be a SOL.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Great. I just require a little more than that.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Press charges or a vote will happen. Nothing stops her after he is confirmed either. He can still be removed.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI No. I completely understand.		She has came forward now. What does she have to lose to file the report? I get why she didn't then. This is now. File the criminal report.
@dearjodi5 @SkepBy @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Great. We are on the same page. Innocent until proven guilty.
@PeterStechow @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI I go off facts and not stories. I do not condemn people without proof. Innocent until proven guilty.
@dearjodi5 @SkepBy @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Could say the same about you. You automatically assume guilt on what could be an innocent man.
@HDGMA6 @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI This has nothing to do with that. There is also procedures to report police.
@smirnoff_sprite @SugarPineSe7en @thehill Public opinion is useless without proof. I don't care how you feel. I care if it happened or not.
@SkepBy @dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI If I was victim of a crime and wanted justice I would file a police report.
@dearjodi5 @Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Any person who has been sexually assaulted should file criminal charges with their local police if they want an investigation.		This is how the process works. It's not by writing a letter to a politician. If you would rather it not go reported then now you are an enabler.
@SugarPineSe7en @smirnoff_sprite @thehill Yes. Now you are getting it.
@smirnoff_sprite @thehill C) Get on the news and make a name for himself.
@jlillehamer @RepJeffDuncan They both are about bringing up irrelevant points from the past.
@Plantflowes @SenWhitehouse @FBI Any person who has been sexually assaulted should file criminal charges with their local police if they want an investigation.
@bobdevaughn @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse We live in a country where if you go to the local police and report a sexual assault they will investigate it. What are you even complaining about? They have NOT even reported a crime yet. Why would it be investigated? Press charges!
@suprninjapirate @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @GOP They both do. Democrats do this way more though. Believe @davidhogg111 and his clan are on tour doing this still. See that? They are touring around the US and Canada and fundraising and gaining votes off dead school children.
@Michael70773547 @thehill Exactly. How is he being accused of sexual assault if he never sexual assaulted anyone?
@ant1188 @thehill You told me I am not logical based of an opinion.
@Jh1985brewer @thehill Did you have sex with him to disprove it?
@JBRRetired @thehill What is this third one I keep hearing of....
@fortismind @thehill No reason to before maybe?		The media are getting 2 weeks of Kavenaugh bashing while he has to sit there quietly waiting for his hearing that they keep getting pushed back. I'd want to clear my name too.
@tim81boslice @lisaray937 @thehill Ya he isn't on the bench yet, she probably meant to say Gorsuch.
@Michael70773547 @thehill Like I said, I'm an innocent until proven guilty right now. The current situation is she said vs he and about 8 of THEIR witnesses said. Odds are not in the accusers favor.
@PattyMurray It's a she said vs he and all witnesses said.
@Michael70773547 @thehill There's like 6 to 8 that have been named by the accusers between the two incidents. All have denied the claims. The accusers can't find anyone to agree with them.
@Lynette47392278 @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @MichaelAvenatti @maddow It's almost all news. All crap.
@Lynette47392278 @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @MichaelAvenatti @maddow Interesting, yes. Almost like a tabloid. Think we call that entertainment, not journalism or news.
@Michael70773547 @thehill If all their witnesses weren't denying it then I might have a little trust in their accusation.
@Michael70773547 @Luckylaurie2 @thehill False. I can feel the hate coming off your Twitter account.
@RepSpeier @POTUS Prove it then.
@Michael70773547 @thehill I'm an innocent until proven guilty type. Unless he is proven guilty in a court of law, I will presume he is innocent.
@elizabethforma Push for kavenaugh to be treated with respect too!
@jhgurf @forrestbrakeman @thehill Still an allegation.
@Michael70773547 @thehill Not a Republican. But I also believe in evidence. Seems like you have a lot of #hate.
@forrestbrakeman @thehill Maybe prevent those to come forward with no proof or evidence, yes.
@thehill I hope the attacks on kavenaugh don't discouraged qualified people to run for office or Supreme Court seats.
@Jestero_Twitch @TIME Possibly. But it would be a very idiotic move and he is not that dumb.		I don't doubt he just opened the door to possibly a false claim though.
@Jestero_Twitch @TIME I doubt he would make that claim if it wasn't true. Any female he slept with would be already on the news.
@ant1188 @thehill Can add #CyberBully to yours.
@ant1188 @thehill Sis you read my tweet? I didn't disagree he's wrong to say so. But most likely correct.
@wincing @thehill Exactly.
@ant1188 @thehill Have you read the story? How could it possibly be credible?		I will say it's not 100 percent phony. But it's a high chance.
@keljdm14 @Y1123581321Y @MeetThePress @ChrisCoons That's a background investigation. Not a criminal investigation. File charges with local police like everyone else does.
@thehill Why would they do this to themselves? What do they have to gain?
@Y1123581321Y @MeetThePress @ChrisCoons Also a country of proof and due process.
@FoxNews Why is someone taking a picture of this and not getting the baby? Better be a traffic cam or something. Not clicking to the site to find out either.
@wincing @thehill I wouldnt silence either but some restrictions would be nice.		No 24/7 coverage of shootings.	No reporting of crimes that haven't had charges filed.	No use of race when describing people.		Just a few things to stop spreading hate.
@SuzanneKelleher @jaketapper @kaitlancollins @SymoneDSanders @amigoaguilar @MajorCBS @TheLeadCNN New info will be rolling out for months if you let it. That's how stalling works. Can't release it all at once.		Just like an infomercial. But wait..... There's more!
@markellis56 @jaketapper @kaitlancollins @SymoneDSanders @amigoaguilar @MajorCBS @TheLeadCNN You don't smear someone that isn't going to have a hearing. That's a waste of time.		If he was going to have a hearing a whole bunch of dirt would have came out. Most if not all being false. But it still would look like our current situation, just opposite sides.
@RepScottPeters Why do you keep calling it a Muslim ban? It want and still isn't that.
@Juvabu1 @RonWyden Victim blaming is cool?
@wincing @thehill We won't. Can't put restrictions on the media without getting blamed for silencing the media. Until Americans stop feeding into this tabloid type of journalism they will continue to do this since it creates profit. I think it will continue to get worse.
@CNN @CNNOpinion It's your fault media. You shouldnt report criminal activity unless charges were filed.
@Tuck6191 @3Fers @thehill I made my own comment.
@Tuck6191 @3Fers @thehill I didn't compare anything.
@KimTolliver @thehill Trump doesn't care about roe.		SC has nothing to do with impeachment.		Where do you get this crap?
@SuzanneKelleher @thehill @SenatorCollins Every republican jisge nominated has been accused of this. It's still there.
@rangersfan1966 @thehill What they did to each other, yes.
@Tuck6191 @3Fers @thehill He wasnt ever seriously considered so no need to smear him.
@OPSVeracity @thehill @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JeffFlake False	False	False		The only lie is this entire post.
@WaysMeansCmte Weed
@wincing @thehill American media and politicians.		Most of America doesn't follow this garbage.
@CBSNews Oh the humanity! Really? Would rather burn them alive? Would rather just stab a knife in their brain? I'd think this is a more humane way to do this.
@NicholasTerry3 @CNN You've gotta hand it to people that blindly follow peoples word off no evidence or proof.		Why do you believe them but not Kavenaugh? Confirmation bias is the answer. You are automatically believing people you WANT to believe. That's it. Please remember that when thinking.
@luca_mynameis @brianschatz @realDonaldTrump @GOP If you do believe that, I'd strongly recommend taking a long break from politics. If it is effecting you emotionally then they are winning. You are being used for votes and ad revenue. Don't believe anything both sides tell you. Just stop paying attention if you feel too invovled
@brianschatz We know you are just stalling. At least try to make it less obvious.
@politico No, just do the damn vote.		If they want to file criminal charges let them. If they turn out he did something bad then he will get impeached. Then the Democrats who will have the Senate by then can just wait for DJT to never nominate another replacement.
@SenFeinstein Step down and leave. You outed Dr. Ford which lead to death threats. She wrote a letter and asked not to go public.
@CarisSevern @ShopgirlAlic @SenFeinstein Or the people could withdraw their allegations. That would work too.
@SenFeinstein Your term should be cancelled.
@BenedictGomez @AP Nailed it a week ago. :)		https://t.co/L33hy7GZsp
@realDailyWire Only in a court law! - Liberals say.		So tired of hearing that shit.
@AP I say vote and bring criminal charges. If found guilty then impeach. Stop wasting time with these timed interruptions.
@brianschatz Agree. All politicians need to go.
@RoKhanna The fact you are here #racebaiting highlights what's wrong with identity politics. Grow up.
@AaronD825 @SenMarkey @CongressRTBot They already have people lined up.
@thehill He also has tapes. He also has blah blah blah. He has nothing but stalling. Show us or shut up.
@SenMarkey Do you know what the words credible and corroborated mean?
@SenGillibrand Do you have proof they knew about Deborah Ramirez? That is a HUGE claim you are making here. I think you need to prove it or face some punishment for lying on this one. You are not allowed to attack other Senators like that.
@kkreitman @CNNPolitics Or maybe because it never happened. Most compelling information we have.
@BlueVotr @thehill @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski How many protesters interrupted the hearing and at what time interval?
@cmkevnick @ABCPolitics If they are found guilty of sexual assault then they would be impeached. You would only be afraid to continue forward if you didn't think he is truly guilty.
@ABCPolitics Go to immediate vote. If found guilty later then remove him. Be done with this shit.
@brianschatz Respectable? Nothing about this you can attach the word respect to.
Nailed it. Shall we go 3 for 3?
@TinkerBitch68 @exrec54 @thehill No. She changed her mind. What are you trying to say? I quoted what she said.
@wesleyalth @realDailyWire I mean they both have zero evidence that I would put any weight towards.
@brianschatz I vote for gridlock. Let's just stop everything since you all can't seem to get a long.
@vboketty @realDailyWire He could if he knew the alleged date/time and could prove he was somewhere else (highly unlikely). But that won't happen.
@jf400 @thehill Both are not evidence.
@realDailyWire This evidence is as strong as hers.
@thehill Duh.
@NBCNews Have we figured out what exactly has to be done, if anything, to fix it? Or we just going to throw money at it still and wish for the best?
@blodtorstig @Eufomati @thehill Exactly. Neither has supporting evidence for their claim. 		He said she said. Without anything further this is pointless. Votes will remain as predetermined by political side prior to even the nomination. Nothing has changed except both people got the character smeared.
@PatriciaBronso7 @MeetThePress @PattyMurray Kidding? She blamed the Republicans for already knowing how they were going to vote. The Democrats AND Republicans knew before the nominee was selected. Nothing changed.		So she is blaming the right from something left is doing the exact thing. That's not insightful common sense.
@highserenity49 @tonycenteio @thehill @FLOTUS Someone needs a therapist. #cyberbully
@ABC But let's ban guns because they kill people too!
@thehill Correct. Both of them are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
@blodtorstig @Eufomati @thehill Accusation without any type of evidence or proof is just as relevant as a calendar. That is what I said.
@blodtorstig @Eufomati @thehill Agree. It's just as relevant and same amount of evidence as she is bringing. Nothing.
@snarkylicious @tonycenteio @thehill @FLOTUS #BeBest
@tonycenteio @thehill If this was @FLOTUS then she would be criticized for it not being a same sex marriage. Also these people would be labeled as racists Russian bots.
@benshapiro Frozen wins.
@Eufomati @thehill So people can believe someone's story with no supporting proof or evidence from 1982 but if they had a calendar then that's where I draw the line?
@Yolieoc @thehill Done and will be done. Then what?
@BretziusKaija @thehill Think Clinton was the last president to actually admin he made a mistake and takes full responsibility.
@CNNPolitics Too late. You already shown your bias.		Trump took 2 days to respond to something and gets crucified. Democrats took over a week. Same outcome.
@WatergateII @thehill I'd rather him do this than just to make the decision.
@UnleashingAgain @CongBoyle We go in more debt. Just like we always do.
@bpjauburn @EWErickson @instapundit Another allegation will appear right before the vote again.
@UnleashingAgain @CongBoyle Stupid? Democrats have been claiming for decades that Republicans are going to take away social security. Guess what, it has never happened. Guess when they always push this crap, right before an election.		It's fear mongering at its finest. Believe it if you want.
@CongBoyle Your rhetoric hasn't changed in decades. Quit fear mongering about social security.
@thehill They threaten subpoena as much as Democrats threaten that Republicans are taking social security away.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill No I'm not.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill Wait! I really care about your opinion!
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill I don't think our conversation ever started. You were just shouting random words.
@ktmccabe2 @Alyssa_Milano So we agreed. Let's do this and move on.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill Exactly. Can't name one fact.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill Name 1 fact about Dr. Fords allegation.
@ktmccabe2 @Alyssa_Milano That's why they both will testify under oath at the hearing.		Feel free to investigate all you want afterwards. If they prove he lied later he gets pulled from the seat.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill Absurd logic. Bye.
@SassBaller @80k_0k8 @thehill There's a difference between believing and knowing. Once you learn that you can start to grasp what other people are saying.
@ktmccabe2 @Alyssa_Milano Point? If she wants her sexual assault investigated she needs to go to the local police. That is how this works.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill I get it. You believe without proof or evidence.		I am the type of person who needs to see the proof before I make up my mind. I don't automatically condemn people based off someone else claim.
@80k_0k8 @SassBaller @thehill You do NOT know about Dr. Ford. You may believe her. But that does not make it a fact.
@keithellison I saw the word domestic in your post and I thought this was about something else. But no, more propaganda.
@SassBaller @thehill @IanMCohen @80k_0k8 What's the point of posting that? Are you saying you think the number is higher or lower?
@ktmccabe2 @Alyssa_Milano Don't wait for other people. If it's a serious allegation and you are fearing for your life, go to the police station.
@ZenSpeakeasy @ABC Don't you remember the fear mongering the media and democrats pushed everyday? 		Kavenaugh will end womans rights. No more abortion. No more healthcare. No more __________.		Some people actually fall for fear mongering. If she believes political rhetoric she has a lot to gain.
@ktmccabe2 @Alyssa_Milano File charges with local police if you want it investigated.
@SassBaller @thehill Just because millions of other woman were sexually assaulted DOES NOT mean Dr. Ford was.
@KarenMonahan01 @CNNPolitics Last week called and they want their political rhetoric back.
@ABC Are you saying #StopKavanaugh is for nothing? So the millions of Americans fighting to #StopKavanaugh is nothing to gain?		Please tell me you realize this but are just playing politics. She has A LOT to gain. Remember if #Kavenaugh is confirmed she will lose all woman's rights.
@Alyssa_Milano Ok. But if you want anything done about it you need to provide proof. This is what we are waiting for Dr. Ford to provide.
@thehill You know what else the poll shows they tried to hide? More people agree with Trump the way this is being handled than Democrats or Republicans. https://t.co/BkB52oV8Wl
@thehill Bunch of childish people making fun of a childish man. No winners here.
@mikejolk @EleanorNorton First off, #cyberbully.		Secondly, no.
@jamesBond12111 @thehill Notice how the conveniently left out DJT in their graphic also. https://t.co/bnP6NVhk1u
@mikejolk @EleanorNorton Both sides have. Both sides knew how they were going to vote prior to the nomination. Are you suggesting other wise?
Anyone notice anything @CBSNews is trying to hide here? This is why you are called #fakenews.		https://t.co/Ixg1GYV3Jd https://t.co/w4CP2999cE
@jamesBond12111 @thehill That is in THEIR poll. So you do believe what I posted. Go read the damn thing.		They also polled more woman than men. Also polled more left than right. Don't be a sheep. Read the damn thing for yourself.
@thehill How do you feel about the way each of these are handling matters surrounding the allegations?		APPROVE		Democrats - 27%	Republicans - 28%	Donald Trump - 34%		This should be your headline. More people approve the way DJT is handing this than Democrats. Dare you to run that.
@flyguydoug @senorrinhatch This isn't the right way? What exactly is not RIGHT or lawful about this?
@RepBrendanBoyle @realDonaldTrump No one thinks it isn't a hoax. We know the climate is changing.		Just no one knows for sure if we can even stop it and if we can, how exactly. You just don't solve problems by throwing money at it. Need to figure it out exactly then go from there.
@politico The Senators should question her. Does #Kavenaugh get to choose who will question him?
@mikejolk @EleanorNorton That's just because you are believing this is an unfair hearing. The point of the hearing is to let her testify. That's it. What exactly is not fair?
@RepGregoryMeeks Investigate what? Ask the 4 "witnesses" that already said it didn't happen?
@RepJayapal You shouldn't not be pushing this garbage.
@maxmollymom @CBSNews Probably because you never listened to him completely and just know what the media tells you.
@CNNSotu @amandacarpenter File charges then. Not a difficult choice.
@sendavidperdue You won't get the truth. You will get one accusation with to proof and one denial.		How do you think the American people will ever get the truth?
@benshapiro ImPeach Trump flavor.		It's an empty bowl with no ice cream in it but Liberals will flock in masses to purchase anyway and take selfies with it and post on social media.
@bishbash_bosh1 That's disgusting to even say that #cyberbully. I block hateful people from my life. Hopefully you can change. Don't let the hate and fear consume you.
@seanflanagan43 @RepJayapal #BeBest.
@SmartSarahB @thehill Then file charges and prove it. Until then, no one should suffer consequences of a mere allegation with no proof.		Don't you see how dangerous that can become?
@seanflanagan43 @RepJayapal Ok #cyberbully.
@thehill Both sides already knew how they were going to vote before the nominee was selected. Nothing has changed. Saying this to one side and not the other is disgusting.
@RepJayapal Healthcare is not a human right.
@randomobserver1 @senorrinhatch Everyday person here, I 100% agree with him.
@RepJayapal Get the government out of healthcare. Less government, not more. Think you already proved how bad you can all screw it up.
@thehill That's what Dr. Ford wants, right? If not then she should file criminal charges.
@DJBurn77 @NBCNews Then everything they undo will be undone in 2024. Cycle continues.
@DaisyWufWuf @CBSNews Wow. I hope you never make any important decisions regarding other human life.
@DanGrafford @CBSNews Bengahzi could have been over in a week if they were given the documents and testimony they asked for immediately. Only reason it dragged on forever is the stalling. That's not on Trey. He did his job.
@jenhan @CBSNews @TGowdySC Nothing to gain? That's a ridiculous claim. #StopKavanaugh movement is nothing to gain? If she succeeds then the millions of people that want this gain nothing? Are you serious?
@CBSNews This is why I support @TGowdySC for any political seat he wants.
@PattyMurray You are doing the #metoo and #WhyIDidntReport movement a disservice. Please stop talking because you are taking these movements backwards.
@LALewman @NBCNews I sense a lot of #hate within you.
@PattyMurray Witnessing the bulling of #kavenaugh reminds me so much of the mistreatment of @JusticeThomas67.
@QueenSincic Agree. But absolutely nothing to do with #Kavenaugh and I hope people can see the difference.
@TeryeA @realDonaldTrump @GOP You sound pleasant.
@bishbash_bosh1 You being disgusted by people not automatically assuming guilty is disgusting to me.
@Starrrella_8 @thehill @FBI So you stand with the FBI on not doing an investigation on Kavenaugh, right?
@realDailyWire @glennbeck @benshapiro #$#%$#@$#@$#@$%$#%#@$#!$@#$#@%$^%&amp;%^*^&amp;(^&amp;(&amp;*^&amp;$%#%$@#$$%$^%$&amp;%^&amp;@$!#$#%$^%$&amp;^$&amp;#%@#$@#%^^%*^%&amp;*^$&amp;*^%*&amp;^(&amp;*)%@#$#@$%@#$!! #outrage
@ShirleyDeal7 @HarryShannon @thehill I don't believe that at all. 		You vote what candidate will represent or benefit you the most, Not other people. YOU. How do you possibly know what would benefit the country most when all politicians do is fear monger on both sides. That's why you vote for YOU and YOU only.
@thehill I believe in innocent until proven guilty. I think both parties should be given that right.		But here I don't. She's lying and being used by Democrat politics. I could be wrong. There's only a .04% chance of that happening just so you are aware.
@CNNPolitics This is 100% thanks to the grandstanding politicians and media. Are you kidding me CNN? You are the reason!!! This is #fakenews.
@ViralCancer @thehill Not sure what part you disagree with unless you didn't read my comment.		I said I initially thought Google wasn't doing shit. But then I saw their internal video after Trump won and now I am convinced they are.
@FoxNews Can the agreement at least involve a 20 X 20 fully enclosed cage with 2 pizzas and a candle?
@Starrrella_8 @thehill @FBI Except when you say you won't investigate Kavenaugh for the 10th time.  Then we say you are biased and being control by Trump. Deep State! rabble, rabble, rabble.
@ShirleyDeal7 @HarryShannon @thehill "If you believe that the principles and goals of each Democrat candidate"		Right there is what I mean by party over country. Blue wave is pushing vote democrat NO MATTER WHAT! I 100% agree you vote with what ever candidate will benefit you the most.
@bbyfacebeauty27 @NBCNews Maybe. But I think their long term plan is right after this one, another one will come out. So we need to wait another 2 weeks for another hearing because we already set precedent on how long sexual assault hearings take to set up. Guess what happens after that one is over...
@bhqrup I'm a male with single payer as retired military, so you understand.		Abortion. Do what you want, I don't care.		Healthcare. Government should NOT be involved at all.		Border. Don't build the wall. Punish people that give illegals jobs and housing.
@thehill As someone that know search engine optimization I would say Google is not censoring at all. The reason why you see what you see is because the sheer amount of left vs right quality media outlets. We all know the left has 100 times more. But after seeing their video, they did it.
@TheDeepStateUSA @realDailyWire @nuthntoseehere You personal Confirmation Bias determines who won.		If you want a Democrat to win then the Democrat won the debate. Same for Republican.
@HarryShannon @thehill Blue Wave = party over Country.		Bet you disagree too.
@SwissMom49 @amolinadesigns @thehill What does anything that I said have to do with Trump? I swear people are obsessed with this guy. Do you have posters on your wall of him?		The POTUS is just a figure head. They don't have any real power. They should not be controlling your thoughts and life.
@FoxNews @jeffmason1 Show the exact same respect the democrats showed kavenaugh.
@SenFeinstein What about kavenaugh and his family? Don't care about them do ya?
@JasonLongDickey @NBCNews Seems like you learned a new word this year but failed to understand the mea meaning.
@TikiOwl @thehill @Stonekettle Who assaulted who?
@amolinadesigns @thehill Sure all the foreign shoe making factories are loving it. While Nike takes your move, moves it overseas, and does nothing about the social issue they promote. Good job people!
@thehill Donate it all.
@SenWhitehouse Zip it. You are part of the problem. All politicians should NOT be taking a side.
@PaulaDuvall2 @CNN Don't blame Obama for the rise of shootings. Not fair.
@enigma_quantum @KATHIE50 @ABC The offered to send a small team to her so she could testify privately. Are you kidding?
@CoryBooker @MikieSherrill You are campaigning everyday. Even days you should be asking questions to a Supreme Court nominee.
@ScaryCarrrie @ABC Or she doesn't testify and they move to vote.
@KATHIE50 @ABC That's not how the good ol boy network works. They wouldn't be bending over backwards for her if it was the good ol boy network.
@Rollingwater1 @okkayjay @thehill I don't see any change. I see a lot of fear mongering though.
@politico Stupid question.
@Rollingwater1 @okkayjay @thehill How are you guys? The people that are being connect are anyone that believes ANY politician. I'm not in that group.
@SenGillibrand Take time to review the facts and evidence. Not stories of unrelated incidents. This is absurd.
@Rollingwater1 @okkayjay @thehill He's achieved way more than I ever will. So, ya?
@senrobportman Legalize weed and be done with it. No one will use that crap if they access to weed.
@Rollingwater1 @okkayjay @thehill Correct. Small local business. 		Owned one. Closed one. Spent 2 years paying the debt off.
@Rollingwater1 @okkayjay @thehill Or maybe when you buy American the money stays here and there is a huge snowball effect.
@okkayjay @thehill Don't buy Chinese products then. Buy American, the price hasn't increased.
@Pharoah_Gama @thehill Should look into coupons.
@JoelKlebanoff @thehill Don't rebuild with Chinese products and then it wouldn't matter.
@NBCNews Could? Could? Could? Could?		Maybe find out before writing a #fearmongering article instead. Don't ever use could in a headline.
@ALadyofReason1 @FoxNews Comes in an empty bowl, cause ain't never gonna happen. But I bet it will still be a top seller even with people knowing it's empty.
@bri0nlee @FoxNews Technically we have been poisoning ourselves. They just have been granted permission by the FDA to be a legal dealer.
@ivannowosiadlo @FoxNews With a side of guilt and fear please.
@njcat55 @SenWarren @danrivera01843 @ColumbiaGasMA If you think she is there to help then you misread her intentions. She is there to get people to vote and donate to her.
@AmazingStumps @SenWarren @danrivera01843 @ColumbiaGasMA She says the only the words "vote" and "donate" far more. That's all she is. A campaigning politician.
@ragowenlock @snowball_60 @LLLInSC @SenWarren @danrivera01843 @ColumbiaGasMA What a bunch of crap. Your experience and others have absolutely nothing to do with Dr Fords claims. Just because your story is true had zero impact on someone else.
@arctic2017 @WSJ @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley All dumb questions.
@DeepstateU @WSJ Not a criminal investigation maybe?
@FantasyKash @BBartilotta @LO_LLLLLLLL @johnblairjunior @SteveKerr Cars are responsible for thousands of times more deaths than guns. That just means you don't actually care about the deaths if you don't want to push for that ban. You just care about muh guns.	NO! You do not need a car either. Cars make us fat. Make us die. You like dead people?
@FantasyKash @LO_LLLLLLLL @johnblairjunior @BBartilotta @SteveKerr Almost every gun on Earth is a semi-automatic. But I guess you will say, fine ban them all now.
@SteveKerr Stay out of politics. Leave it to the professionals.
@thehill So. 1 person at the FBI said, no. Now what?
@AJentleson #FakeNews. They even offered to come to her. What lies you are sharing.
@brianschatz I'm beginning to wonder what you believe your job is.
@thehill Sure you report this. What about Keith Ellison?
@CasiArgiud62 @thehill @SenateGOP @GOP Do you have a clue what you are talking about? They even offered they can go to her and do a private meeting.
@2020fight @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok. Good talk.
@2020fight @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you think Dr. Ford hired her or she was appointed to Dr. Ford?
@sekrah @thehill Has he used the Dr Ford sympathy speech yet?
@senorrinhatch I'm sure your normal business and voting was not that important anyway.
@HuffPost Just schedule a slot for her to testify. If she doesn't show up then skip it.
@franklinq @thehill Bullying? Really?
@AileenMitchel16 @AP @JeffFlake Absolutely not.
@senorrinhatch Just vote. I don't believe she has any intention of showing up. Just delay like the constant stream of protestors during the hearing.
@CBSNews They did. 2016 elections. Remember?
@TheLastWord No. This is bait to attempt to get him fired since they know the Mueller investigation is a dead end. So to save face they want him to be fired and special counsel ended. That way they can just whine about it more to get more votes.
@thehill Don't think the FBI cares.
@Fly_Sistah @thehill There was no perjury. That was 2 weeks ago smear campaign. Since then most media outlets have been honest and retracted that crap.
@thehill Don't negotiate. This is a hearing. She shows up or doesn't.
@alton_jimmy @FoxNews Or at least describe her roast beef.
@bad_indian_girl @Lizerenity @KnotVeryNice @vlynpowell @FoxNews Polygraph is not a fact. Come on now. There is zero evidence. You are on the side of facts and evidence, right?
@bad_indian_girl @Lizerenity @KnotVeryNice @vlynpowell @FoxNews So just curious since you post about facts. You don't believe her claim either right? Since there are zero facts or evidence.
@bad_indian_girl @Lizerenity @KnotVeryNice @vlynpowell @FoxNews Not a trumper. What's your excuse now?
@bad_indian_girl @Lizerenity @KnotVeryNice @vlynpowell @FoxNews @GOP I've seen zero evidence he is guilty also.
@seedsofevil @FoxNews That's opinion. Not fact.
@seedsofevil @FoxNews Think the IRS hasn't seen them? I think they understand tax law better than you.
@washingtonpost If he helped create gangster rap than he is partially responsible for why cops shoot unarmed black men.
@TIME Americans. Full of one percenters in a global scale still complaining about the one percent.
@FoxNews Trump has business deals with Russia. We know. Are they illegal deals? That's the question.
@Greebobek @CBSNews I already did. #BeBest
@Greebobek @CBSNews And you learned from them and did what they were doing. Now we can say anti Trumpers attack his appearance. Awesome.
@therealHoneyW @Lil_LizG @thehill Because she probably has a story from her past similar to this so she thinks if she says this one is true then it helps her justify hers is.
@Greebobek @CBSNews You are the one mentioning appearance like it matters #CyberBully.
@CNNPolitics Don't care. I'd rather see a statement of evidence.
@LiberalismRules @thehill So you completely reject liberals are making threats at kavenaugh and the he and is family is under Marshall protection? It's funny that liberals are doing this but you attack conservatives for it? Both sides have violent people. Get over it.
@LiberalismRules @thehill Kavenaugh has been receiving threats for awhile too. Both sides are the same.
@Silencedugud @washingtonpost Absolutely. Woman tend to work more in the nutruing and caregiver fields. It's what they enjoy to do. There's been plenty of studies on this. Feel free to educate yourself #CyberBully.
@washingtonpost So? Woman like doing different jobs. Why can't you just be happy for them?
@bad_indian_girl @Lizerenity @KnotVeryNice @vlynpowell @FoxNews Had a chance to be specific and argue a point but you chose to just throw general insults.
@CNNPolitics Maybe they had a lead to at least go off of?
@JavierLandes @registerandvote @SamSanderson123 @thedailybeast Prove it. She sure didn't prove anything. She rambled on in code and said nothing.
@registerandvote @SamSanderson123 @thedailybeast That's a lie.
@btjabrone127 @thehill Why because he just stayed a human right? Seriously?
@GregScheinert @FoxNews And I want a #2 from McDonald's and a room temperature eco-friendly cup of water waiting for me when I get there.		Who does she think she is to be setting terms? She is just goading them to say no so they can play for politics.
@safetylawyer1 @thehill @lisamurkowski @Scotus Didn't commit perjury. Don't spread lies.
@glamelegance @CNN More she is harassed the more she won't vote with you. So keep it up if you want.
@thehill Not sure who will be there. Monday is the date.
@Tim_Rigney @VincenzoSantin5 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump It was actually friendly advice.
@Tim_Rigney @VincenzoSantin5 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You need a hobby.
@BluesyBlonde @thehill Bye.
@BluesyBlonde @thehill That's completely false. The woman that claimed this retracted that statement. They do not know he did this. Don't spread fake news.
@BluesyBlonde @thehill Then it's pointless. She needs to prove it or did this all for nothing. Without proof he will get confirmed. If that's what she wants, then so be it. Making and allegation with zero proof will get you no where.
@BluesyBlonde @thehill If she wants to prove he is guilty you go through a court of law, not a confirmation hearing. Not by taking a polygraph.
@Tim_Rigney @VincenzoSantin5 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump People can focus on more than one issue at a time. Point is why believe what a proven liar says anymore?
@ElizaHillSC @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Nice.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump What are you doing to fix this?
@thehill Burden of proof is on the accuser and government. No.
@thehill Don't go to his class. Drop out. No one cares about you.
@thehill Disgusting politics. Stop #racebaiting.
@Alkaline_Cheese @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Hmmm. 10 years ago Obama was elected. Shortly after that he met with Putin. Hmmmm. Means nothing.		I'd seriously stop following politics. Cya.
@Alkaline_Cheese @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK So what? Do you have any idea who Paul Manafort is or what he has done in the last 2 decades?
@Alkaline_Cheese @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Then hold your breathe and wait. I will continue to live my life without Trump on the brain.
@Alkaline_Cheese @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK 10 years ago? Seriously? Trump was working with a lobbyists 10 years ago? Pretty sure he had other things going on during the time these crimes were committed.
@Alkaline_Cheese @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Maybe something like he give details on when he was a lobbyists and how he was defrauding the government and evading taxes.		All which has nothing to do with Trump but everything to do with the charges.
@thehill Oh dear. The lefts Benghazi.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK You don't know what information they gave. To use the word flipped is why you are called fake news. #fakenews
@thehill Or stop selling people Chinese crap.
@KamalaHarris You say, RELEASE THEM, then you say, OH WAIT, don't do that until you know where they are going.
@PattiD05 @thehill The Hill breaks the same news 8 times a day for 1 week straight to make sure people know.
@SenSanders I agree with him. Right now it can't. The health care system is so jacked up due to the government getting involved. Pull the government OUT OF healthcare.
@brianschatz Kavenaugh will be confirmed. That's how it plays out.
@brianschatz Get off Twitter then. You weren't elected to Tweet.
@JasonClarkShow @thehill The term racists has no more meaning anymore. It's just another insult used by #cyberbullys.
@politico Any politician should be forced to follow "innocent until proven guilty" or they lose their seat. Think that would solve it.
@JasonClarkShow @thehill That would be a rather dividing medal to give also.
@NBCNews Just because you had a moment and your's is potentially true, doesn't mean they all are.
@FoxNews @CBP Why is Illegal Entries with Asylum? Are they grouping the real asylum seekers in here or the people that wait to get caught and yell out "I SEE ASYLUM!"?
@thehill So?
@RepJimmyGomez @realDonaldTrump You forgot to add if it can be addressed and how we can effectively do it. That's the $8 question.
@arXiv6174 @realDailyWire @benshapiro I'm not arguing. Just asking questions. Really haven't cared to look this up.
@arXiv6174 @realDailyWire @benshapiro That's debatable. But was said person a convicted crook at the time?
@arXiv6174 @realDailyWire @benshapiro Aren't all media personalities a pen for hire in some way?
@JulesT25096181 @TIME File criminal charges with local police and provide some evidence. Then ask for another background check.
@SchmidtVicki @davidaxelrod I'm being accused of rape, please investigate me FBI. - Said no one ever.		She should show up Monday and testify under oath with him. Then if one of them is caught lying it's a federal crime.
@JulesT25096181 @TIME It's not a federal crime. FBI investigates Federal Crimes.
@FoxNews Translation: She will testify as long as the date is passed the midterm elections.
@thehill Really got em with this one! Means nothing.
@CongBoyle How?
@thehill That's what typically happens with smear campaigns.
@joseph_napper @thehill That's what the tax cuts were. More money for the taxpayers.
@NBCNews Don't believe it. More #racebaiting.
@thehill Divide America Medal?
@AstiJesse @jaketapper @SenWhitehouse @TheLeadCNN This is the exact line of rhetoric Republicans gave in 2009 to take back the house and senate. It's almost like, both parties are the same.
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill Forgot a period. We use those in America to indicate the end of a sentence.
@JulesT25096181 @TIME Had anyone confirmed her allegations yet and seen some police reports of alleged threats? Just curious, I haven't yet.
@DoloresMazzara1 @TIME How do you know he always hasn't been? Why are you victim blaming?
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill It's kind of amusing you reporting me as a bot but continue to talk to me. Do you know what a bot is?
@thamilton714 @RepDonBeyer I'm not rich and I got more. How is that a lie?
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill Another act of a #CyberBully.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill I will continue to correct lies when I see them. Our conversation had no effect on my future behavior.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill *Just
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill Found the #CyberBully.
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill Good luck with that.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill My intent has a 98 percent probability.		The way you read it makes her sound even worse. She replied to the tweet with a random fact that does not contribute to anything?
@JTTalkingPoints @TheDemocrats I criticize headlines more than I do articles. I'm not giving these people any ad revenue.
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill I must be completely oblivious to where they betrayed the country. They might have betrayed you. That's not a traitor.
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill OK. What laws were broken and what was their conviction date?
@JTTalkingPoints @TheDemocrats I don't open race baiting articles.
@jaidibear81 @speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill No I didn't. I know then intent. Makes no sense to use it in the other way. Just shout out random facts with no meaning.
@OsaTester @Sammysgranny @thehill You are assuming intent.
@TheDemocrats I think she had someone in her campaign call this in for free publicity. Bets?
@JuliaBrownley26 Fight for amputees, little people, and overweight people too. Military is discriminating against them from joining too!
@Sammysgranny @thehill Do you even know what that word means? You are using it incorrectly.
@thehill Don't threaten. Just do it if there is cause.
@RepDonBeyer False. It gave the majority of Americans more money. Let's be a little honest in our headlines, eh?
@thehill So brave.
@CBSNews Correction. Didn't read the article. It was just as expected. More stalling.
@CBSNews Good. Won't make a difference. But at least she can tell her story and we can move forward.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill You don't know her intent. You can't say if it was a lie or being misinformed.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill I will correct any lie or misinformation I see.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill Good story. You won't find me defending republicans if that's what you are expecting.		The senate is what I was talking about, not the house. No clue why that even matters. The house needs to make agree with a bill that Democrats in the Senate will have to agree with.
@thehill So brave.
@Just_Saki_ @speakn_my_truth @thehill Don't use Kevins name in vain.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill She made a rude comment to the POTUS attempting to insult his intelligence.		My advice is to not do that to being with and there would no need to get called out as a lie.
@speakn_my_truth @Just_Saki_ @thehill I completely understand. No one really wanted the wall then or now. My comment was about the majority not having any bearing on a budget bill.
@Just_Saki_ @thehill Someone should explain senate budget voting rules to you.
@bryan30152 @sendavidperdue @POTUS Not day 1. They had 2 years of controlling it all.		Also I give more credit to congress and senate for the economy than whoever the POTUS is. POTUS doesn't have much real power in my opinion.
@elizabethforma @JossieValentin @BernieSanders Stop politicizing deaths and natural disasters.
@BarryRydell2 @FoxNews @GOPChairwoman @AmericaNewsroom That's some pretty bad boobie drawing there.
@ZanzibarAnnie @sendavidperdue @POTUS Or the laws that matter for an agenda require 2/3 of Senate.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Obama was obstructed more than Trump so far. So it's not really historic.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK The political side with the charges believe her unconditionally.	The political side against the charges want proof.		This has not changed. This is how it's been for a while.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Exactly. We don't know her motive. You can guess, I can guess, we don't know.		Without knowing the motive you cant ask questions about why she would do this to her family. Why she would do this to herself. Why would she want to go public and get attacked.		Motive matters.
@IowaPeg @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Where's this book so I can read it? You cant be talking about the mark judge book, right?
@OkieLibSherry @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews You lost me. I'm not afraid of anything. If she wants to file charges, go for it.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews You were talking about why she would report or put her family through this.		This is probably too difficult to explain in a tweet. Until you know motive, you can't answer why she would do it or put her family through this.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews I don't know her motive. I don't know why people do things.		Why did the guy shoot scalise at the baseball field? What would he possibly have to gain? Why would he put himself through that?
@LisaM3732 @MaddowBlog To think I've never been marginalized is wrong. I just don't blame it on my sex or gender which is probably the difference.
@OkieLibSherry @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Maybe one is more credible? Maybe one had something more to investigate? I don't know. Neither do you.
@IowaPeg @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Mark judge did not say anything about kavenaugh sexually assaulting her. What are you even hinting at?
@BlueTribeFan @anaferdelrio @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews I'm all for an investigation. But by the proper authorities,not the fbi.
@LisaM3732 @MaddowBlog Well he hasn't done anything that proves to me he is not qualified unless they can prove these allegations true. But I stay away from all the fear mongering from both sides about how the world will end if xxxxxxxx. It never does. It never will.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews All I'm saying is she needs to if she wants anything to come of it. The POTUS will not direct the FBI to conduct another background check. The senate won't just take her word and  will vote him through. She needs to press charges or she did this for nothing.
@boysek @cameron_hai @Lizerenity @anaferdelrio @vlynpowell @FoxNews Haste is to confirm him before the midterm elections. Good chance democrats could take the Senate and if they do then kavenaugh won't be confirmed. This is why one side is stalling and the other is rushing. Politics.
@andrew27696 @CNN #CyberBully
@dpwrth @CNN There's just no way cnn could spin this one negatively.
@boysek @cameron_hai @Lizerenity @anaferdelrio @vlynpowell @FoxNews It would be weird to me if they didn't prepare for this. Especially since they are against the clock. But everything with this confirmation, on both sides, is definitely weird.
@LisaM3732 @MaddowBlog You just stated allegations and not facts. In order for the allegations to be crimes they need to be proven in a court of law.
@LisaM3732 @MaddowBlog He is still a witness. Like the one of the only ones.		But I'm not exactly convinced he isn't the victim in this case. Either way, both are innocent until proven guilty.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Depends on what they consider the offense to be of there is a SOL or not.		https://t.co/e47I1DtMW6
@boysek @cameron_hai @Lizerenity @anaferdelrio @vlynpowell @FoxNews You don't now they knew. You are guessing.		Another reason they could have endorsements ready is to be prepared. I'm sure having 65 endorsements of women ready for a nominee that people are saying is going to take away woman's rights is a pretty good idea.
@pdfnlilj1_d @MaddowBlog @FBI Yes, because threatening a scotus nominee should not be tolerated.
@dirtystayout1 @andiesmith @MaddowBlog Brave.
@LisaM3732 @MaddowBlog Isn't kavenaugh a witness too? Maybe we should stop giving him shit also?
@allycole0512 @BernieSanders I am not as cheap. I'll require 5 million. Thanks.
@FlappyBirdNovel @thehill I see what ya did there.		Mass shootings changed to mass killings just to prove a dumb point.
@arbrown16 @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews They didn't do it to Gorsuch. 		I don't think the DNC created this either. But I do believe they latched onto it and are going to take it for a ride for as long as they can. They don't care about the woman. Just using her as a pawn.
@RepEspaillat Perished on your watch too.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Good luck with that. Next time I report a crime no matter what it is I'll write a letter to the FBI and said you say it's ok.
@SharonJenaviciu @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Pretty sure the FBI agrees with me.
@jens2763 @tribelaw Yes! Please open up an investigation for those harassing Kavenaugh and sending death threats too while your'e at it.
@PattyMurray So she should file charges. Not write a letter to the FBI. That's not how this works.
@cameron_hai @Lizerenity @anaferdelrio @vlynpowell @FoxNews That's because there was something to go investigate also. In this instance there isn't much to go off of. So I am assuming Trump won't direct the FBI to reopen the background check. Which of course will make him look bad.
@RonHowA @ChuckGrassley Pretty sure she will wait until Sunday night and say, I will come testify now! But I need some time to get ready and get there. Can you postpone this until Friday?
@anaferdelrio @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Innocent until proven guilty IS A human right. I'm assuming that is the human right your are talking about?
@SenatorHassan It's actually law enforcements job to get to the truth. But whatever.
@ecclesias @Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Innocent until proven guilty.		Your opinion is she is the victim. That does not make it fact.
@djvordo I have read this before. Long time ago. I 100% agree it's not accurate.
@djvordo All media has a clear an obvious bias. That chart is crap.
@djvordo OK. I don't believe that.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews False again. I've said innocent until proven guilty. That is not saying I believe him.		You are the only one that has taken sides.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews False. I'm saying the the alleged victim of sexual assault needs to file charges. That's it! If she wants justice in the legal system, she needs to file charges. Not send a letter to the FBI. That's not the process.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Exactly the problem. Kavenaugh says he's the victim too. You 100 percent without a doubt say he's lying. You would call that victim blaming.		Innocent until proven guilty! It's a damn human right! You are crucifying a man that hasn't been proven guilty.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews You are crucifying kavenaugh! Innocent until proven guilty.		You are 100 percent believing her? That's not how the law works. She needs to prove his guilt. If she can't, then he's not guilty.		I support the law and process. That's it. Apparently there's something wrong with that?
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews First off you don't know who the victim is here. Kavenaugh could very well be the victim.		I'm a fan of innocent until proven guilty. Go through the right legal channels as the law provides and if he's guilty then he is. Until then, he's innocent. Should be treated as such.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews I dont doubt it sucks.		But she chose to wait this long. If she did it immediately then it would have received no media attention. If she did it 5 years later. Still nothing. She waited until the most attention would be brought. That's on her really.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Agree. They would probably do another if she filed criminal charges with her local police. Then if they deemed credible they can fowrad the information and they can decide to do another background check.		But it's not their job to investigate the claim.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews If she wants that done she should file local charges and present evidence. If not, they probably won't ever do anything.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews Agree. It's their job to do a background check on the nominee. They have done 7 so far and have cleared him.		They have stated its not their job to investigate this alleged crime. Until directed to run yet another background check they won't.
@Lizerenity @vlynpowell @FoxNews They have not investigated it. It's not their job. She needs to go file local charges if she wants a legal investigation. 		They have investigated kavenaugh 7 or so times for each background check at higher levels.
@RepHastingsFL Let's also remember we don't care to hear what you do with your private parts while at work.
@djvordo I believe all are the same, yes. 		The left media bombards the public with crap about Trump.	The right media bombards the public with crap about Obama.		Nothing ever comes of the fearmongering The POTUS doesn't have the power to do much at all. Nothing really changes.
@RepGwenMoore What law would have prevented this today?
@djvordo I encourage you to actually read the entire statement you posted. It clearly states what I've said.
@djvordo Classified content on a unclassified computer is a crime. We all get yearly training, sign documents, etc. This is no secret. 		If you fail to realize this then no use discussing.
@djvordo I get it. You disbelieve everything that's against the democrats and believe everything against Republicans.		It's called confirmation bias.
@djvordo I've had a clearance for decades. I completely understand what happened. She committed a crime. She admitted to the crime. The FBI said it was a crime. It was a crime.
@priralyn @thehill There is a right and a wrong way to run the government. This is not the right way.
@djvordo Agree. Her emails thing was 100 percent against the law, she admitted, and the FBI confirmed it. She broke the law. Just never got charged.		Not sure your point on how they are different.
@priralyn @thehill If you think the way politics is currently being used on both sides is right, then I'd have a hard time explaining why it's wrong.
@priralyn @thehill Did you not understand my point that both sides are the same and used the same tactics?  Both sides are wrong.
@InquiringY @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly right. Just like attempting to delay is not about Kavenaugh being qualified or not. It's about delaying until midterms because most like the Senate will flop and he won't be confirmed.
@ErnestoGuerra @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly. Both sides are the same. When they go low, so do we. Both sides are the same. There is no good side and bad side. Both sides are the same.
@FactUrFeels @CNN Innocent until proven guilty. Try it sometimes and stop victim blaming.
@Askforken @CNN What's happening?
@Craig38020305 @CNN As much as I don't believe her story also, what you are saying is not necessary.
@RepTerriSewell This isn't a game. You don't need a play book.		Your list has nothing to do with a Supreme Court Justices job. Make clear laws and they won't a chance to interpret them incorrectly.
@priralyn @thehill So two wrongs makes a right? Which always goes back to proving my points. Both sides are the same. Filth.
@Liberalyogi @thehill @GOP I don't think you understand how the law works and that a Supreme Court Justice does not have said power.
@Trantsylvania @thehill It would be less dangerous to come forward long before he was a scotus nominee. She made her choice.
@TinkerBitch68 @exrec54 @thehill She said she won't testify until FBI does a full investigation.
@TinkerBitch68 @exrec54 @thehill So they can simply subpoena Ford and have her there on Monday, right?
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews You are supposed to get down on your knees and pretend the water is extremely high. Rookie.
@exrec54 @thehill It doesn't work like that. This is not a trial.
@BenedictsCross @MattSto52450997 @thehill Don't link to an article. Go read the full transcript and read the full email and compare yourself. You will find zero lies when put in context.		If you are relying on articles found on Google to be truthful you will be disappointed. Check for yourself. There were no lies.
@Frank_Sturgell @YesYoureRacist Hopefully a planet with less #CyberBullying.
@CNN I don't care what they have between their legs. Are they qualified? Cool.
@pakiahkoi @AP There isn't anything to investigate. The FBI does not do this. If she wants an investigation she needs to file local charges but it's too late for that also.
@pakiahkoi @AP How many od them were there and can provide evidence of her allegation?
@TulpaOmega @AP More #CyberBullying. Must be a republican.
@TulpaOmega @AP Thanks #CyberBully.
@Frank_Sturgell @YesYoureRacist Feels good to release built up hatred and aggression, right?
@AP Thanks Obama.
@djvordo Highly disagree. I'm 200 percent on board the both sides are the same train. I've been following politics for long enough to see the cycles. They are the same.		The minority always plays the hero role to get votes. Then they get power and roll over. Happens over and over.
@georgmike19 @MaddowBlog But the details.
@dr_mel88 @srkisrn @Vito_Sabbatino @NBCNews I really hope you don't believe this. If you do, stop following politics for your own good.
@ArmadilloPillo1 @NBCNews All allegations of perjury were squashed when put in context. That's why you don't see anyone pushing for that anymore.
@georgmike19 @MaddowBlog Totally different scenario.
@djvordo My bias is against the media and political manipulation. When the POTUS is Republican then typically the left are the fear mongering crowd. When Obama was president it was Fox and the Republicans.		This is how politics work. The minority attacks the majority to smear them.
@georgmike19 @MaddowBlog Show me an assault case that happened 34, 35, 36 or something years ago ,during a month, in a city, with people in it, that was solved due to investigation.
@djvordo My answer is she needs to prove her allegations, the burden of proof is on her. If she can't, then we move on.
@veiledmonk @Nedbruce3 @shirleynorquay @retiredfirecapt @jaketapper @CNN How? What would they investigate? Who would they talk to?
@MaddowBlog Investigate what? No evidence. No details. No facts. No witnesses. What do you want them to do? Send out a bulk email asking if anyone knows something about this? Print some pictures on some milk cartons? Seriously, what the hell would you like them to do?
@djvordo I don't have to prove anything. You don't have to prove anything.		She needs to prove her allegations. The FBI is not going to do that for her.
@PattyMurray What would you investigate exactly?
@veiledmonk @Nedbruce3 @shirleynorquay @retiredfirecapt @jaketapper @CNN and it's too late. No evidence. No witness. Without a confession from Kavenaugh nothing will happen.
@djvordo TO STOP KAVENAUGH! People are crazy.
@djvordo He's a federal judge for god sakes. Why can't you put any amount of trust in someone that has been investigated countless amount of times and found to be squeaky clean? 		She has yet to prove anything about her character or story. But you put blind trust in her?
@djvordo I'm sure a psychology professor wouldn't have an issue with this. It means absolutely nothing.		I look for the most logical solution. To me that is this is a stall tactic. That's why it happened at last second. That's why she wants full FBI investigation before talking. To stall.
@djvordo Do you not see the crazy people that are trying to do ANYTHING to delay the confirmation until midterms when the Senate will most likely swap to Democrats? How many people were arrested during the hearing? It's very well possible she is just another victim of political rhetoric.
@djvordo I don't know either person personally. But I know Judge Kavenaugh has endured countless probes into his past by the FBI. So yes, I believe him more than someone that no one really knows.		In 2012 she said she was sexually assaulted. I don't doubt that. But she didn't say by who.
@djvordo We have seen the therapist's notes which aren't helpful. There were no other witnesses according to her.		There is nothing to investigate. The FBI has already said this.
@djvordo There is ZERO ways to prove the allegations to be true without a confession from Kavenaugh. ZERO.
@djvordo So we are done. Investigation over.		She says yes.	He says no.	Witness says no.		What could they possibly do next?
@djvordo It's not the FBI's job. Also who or what would the investigate? There's literally no details and it's too old of a claim.
@Palmetto_Joe @SenFeinstein She was told by DiFi just to stall until midterms. Just following orders.
@SenFeinstein I hope that each and every one of us will immediately denounce the horrific treatment of Judge #Kavenaugh also.		Fixed it for you. Didn't want you to appear biased.
@djvordo @JohnABusinger @mattyhoyeCNN @RosinaLucibello @ChuckGrassley @SenMajLdr I would recommend you look up the full testimony and the complete email and verify yourself, don't trust any website to just tell you the answer. Both sides of the media will lie to you.		They do not contradict each other and he has been consistent with the answers. I've looked.
@brotherwatt1 @CNN I don't care there are no specifics! Just investigate it or something! Take as long as you like. After the midterms would be ideal. But ya, just go ask people questions. I don't care who. Ask everyone in the US. Take your time. Just do something!
@scrltspdstr85 @Austen_Doyle @CNN Not exactly. But yes.		Didn't support it then, don't support it now.
@ChrisCoons We know a delay tactic when we see it. Testify or lose your chance to speak. Vote next week and let's be done with this crap.
@djvordo @JohnABusinger @mattyhoyeCNN @RosinaLucibello @ChuckGrassley @SenMajLdr All these have been answered already and there was no perjury.		He bought season passes for baseball for friends and family and they reimbursed him.		All the perjury crap is just a smear campaign and when put in context it wasn't.
@djvordo @JohnABusinger @mattyhoyeCNN @RosinaLucibello @ChuckGrassley I don't care either way really. But that is just what's going on here.
@HuffPost People just need to stop using it. Problem will fix itself.
@veiledmonk @shirleynorquay @retiredfirecapt @jaketapper @CNN Innocent until proven guilty.
@JohnABusinger @mattyhoyeCNN @RosinaLucibello @ChuckGrassley They will and should. This is just a delay tactic to get passed the midterms. That's it.
@Lukericardo @mkraju Sending strength to Kavenaugh also.
@ATX_Cat4 @JennySmithNY @CNN FBI has stated this is NOT THEIR JOB to investigate this charge. He has already been vetted. Move on.
@Austen_Doyle @CNN No. She is stalling until mid terms when the Democrats will most likely take back the Senate and then Kavenaugh wont't have enough votes. It's not about about damage. It's about stalling. That's why this came out at the very last minute.
@JennySmithNY @CNN Not the FBI's job. Also if she is refusing to testify (aka stall for midterms) then she just won't be heard. Let's move on to the vote and be done with this.
@punadave @brianschatz I need some butter and chicken nuggets please.
@shirleynorquay @retiredfirecapt @jaketapper @CNN It's not the FBI's job. Period.
@parkandgo05 @jaketapper @CNN She has been told by the Democrats their only goal is to delay until after midterms so they can win the Senate and the confirmation won't happen. This is OBVIOUSLY what she is doing. 100% politics right here.		Too bad she will now not be heard and he will be confirmed.
@Caroolin @PattyMurray Don't just say they do. Explain it.
@brianschatz Is it a Senators job to talk about Trump and Russia 24/7? Think there would be other stuff to do also.
@jaketapper @CNN Stall tactic. Looks like she won't get a chance to testify then. Bring on the vote and be done.
@thehill Not sure what to think about this besides it's stupid.
@JennyCoCoCure @Emannjudd @thehill Good luck with thinking everything is a lie.
@Next_Democrats @mikelotus @thehill Whatever that is supposed to mean. Sounds like a CNN click-bait headline though.
@mikelotus @Next_Democrats @thehill Kind of like Kavenaugh has been getting attacked too. No winners here. Thanks politicians and media!
@mikelotus @Next_Democrats @thehill Ok, so she hasn't said yes yet like I said, right?
@JennyCoCoCure @Emannjudd @thehill Who said it was? Think he was just saying, hey, stop lying.
@mikelotus @Next_Democrats @thehill Or the media apparently. Where is it that she confirmed she will be there Monday? Honestly asking, haven't seen this yet.
@ChrisMurphyCT Just say it....		We want to delay this by any means necessary passed the mid term elections where Democrats will most likely have enough seats to not confirm him.		Would have a lot more respect if you were just honest.
@Frank_Sturgell Let the hate flow... Don't slow down.
@Next_Democrats @thehill Doesn't matter / she hasn't said yes yet.
@MHzMama @thehill This isn't a trial. He doesn't have to if he doesn't want to.
@HuffPost That's how to test for pesticides. If you fart on it and it turns blue then it's not organic. Doesn't everyone do this?
@Frank_Sturgell Thank you. Please spend more time letting out your aggression. I know it must help you each and every time you get a chance to vent some hate. I'm here for you. I'm here to help you. This may sound condescending, but I am serious. Please allow me to help you reach happiness.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill If you wish to continue to #cyberbully me then I accept. I'd rather you spend your time and effort doing this to me since I am not suffering from #depression or possible #suicide. The more you #cyberbully me the less you can do real harm to other people. So please, continue.
@Emannjudd @thehill It was all a lie. He put words in Trumps mouth that he never said.		Now just imagine a CNN "journalist" takes 10 minutes of air time when he should be reporting news to defend himself and lie about Trump. All about him.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill This is why the term racist has lost meaning. Good job.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill Exactly.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill What have I said that would classify me as a racist? Also against which race is it that I'm claiming to be above?
@BettyMcCollum04 Define full. That just means an investigation that lasts until after mid term votes, right?
@CNNPolitics This a joke?
@SenatorHassan If only we elected people to make laws. Maybe they would do something about this.
@CNNPolitics Just FYI, there will be no bombshells or new information. If he withheld vital information while in the FBI and were to release it in this book I'd imagine he would get in serious trouble.		But ya, I'm sure it's anti Trump propaganda so it will be a top seller.
@RepTerriSewell Gender had nothing to do with pay. Stop spreading lies.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill OK #CyberBully.
@thehill How many politicians have written posts mocking kavenaugh? All democrats probably. But ya, we don't care about those.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews I don't think you understand obstruction or what is going on here. There has been zero convictions of Russian collusion.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews No. Absolutely not. If it ends up discrediting the investigation that means there was no crime to even obstruct.		If Mueller has evidence proving collision then nothing can stop him from providing that.
@benshapiro I hope he replies back to her with an insult to her body. That would make me smile.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews No. I am saying this CAN'T obstruct justice, which was the question.		I 100% agree this information could lead to discrediting the Mueller investigation. It could also legitimize it. Or do nothing at all.		But if the facts show one way or the other. Then so be it.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews And?		This has absolutely nothing to do with the special counsel. The special counsel is not investigating this. They aren't requesting information FROM the special counsel.		Republican Congressman are doing their own Russia investigation against the FBI and DOJ.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews The special counsel is not investigating this. They are investigating Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.		This is a separate issue about potentialpeople at the FBI and DOJ misuse of power.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews What investigation are you talking about? The special counsel?
@gf_thewig @NBCNews The POTUS can declassify anything he wishes. So ya.		Why would someones text messages be highly classified? If they were, then sending highly classified text messages on an unclassified system is a very serious crime.		Point is, they are not highly classified.
@BaileyPittipat @NBCNews Withholding facts and evidence would be obstruction. Releasing them is the opposite.
@helluvaGT @NBCNews How would be making facts and evidence public information be obstruction in any way? Of one were to prevent or stop facts and eviofrom being viewed, that would be obstruction. This is like the opposite.
@juulmom1 @NBCNews No.
@ericrescue @RAWHM1000X @thehill #CyberBully
@WSJ Think the preferred term is, little people. Never knew they had their own community either.
@jasoncparrish @thehill OK.		People openly accept #cyberbullying and encourage it if the target is someone the they don't like. The second someone you don't agree with does it then it suddenly because bad.
@SenDuckworth We should not ridicule potential victims of false sexual assault allegations either. Are you willing to state that also?
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump Well we do have a pretty big backlog of illegal immigrants to get through. Doesn't it make sense we slow down the immigration until we can get to those first?		Maybe stop supporting illegal immigration so we can allow more legal immigrants.
@NextChapterNow_ @chrislhayes @SenFeinstein @NBCNews That response sounds like when you call a white person a racist and they say they have a black friend.
@TIME No one cares about the Emmy awards except the ones that are there. They don't need a list. They were there.
@BrianH5262834 @CNN Have proof of those claims? Seen them a few times but have not read the source.
@TheCatsMeow03 @JJYoumans25 @CNN He won't take a polygraph. They are useless.
@LindaQVillan @CNN Which one is the victim here? As far as we know both of them could be. Embarrassed that people automatically assume either way which one is and which one is guilty. This is why we have courts.
@AP Dibs.
@TIME Time is under new management. Is this what we are in store for?
@thehill This is why you are called fake news. This specific instance is a prime example of you being the enemy of the people. Delete this article and post an apology.
@HuffPost It doesn't. Case closed.
@DudeAbides2017 @thehill That's not even the same.		Not giving someone a hearing vs sexual assault allegations.
@thehill He was there?
@thehill Then it's settled. He must be stopped.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill Black on black racism. Got ya.
@thehill That sounds like a very small number and I would be embarrassed to print that. Since when does a petition matter on a Senate vote?
@RepLloydDoggett This has to do with collusion how again?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump How would releasing facts and evidence undermine the investigation? If these are true and are facts that would be impossible! This is the DNC's message on this? Come on now.
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill Even when it's black/hispanic/asisan cops that kill unarmed black kids? Or just the white cops?
@andrewklavan Possibly. Could be a horrible idea also.		Guessing he wouldn't make this call unless he knew for sure it will benifit him.
@alanhkaiser @RealSaavedra No one cares about them but the left.
@thehill Why is this news? Who cares? Seriously, this is stupid.
@SenBlumenthal Let us be the judge of that.
@AP How can we pin this on Trump?
@realDailyWire Really? Finally.
@elizabethforma @algore Could? Why don't we figure out for sure before we spend more money?
@repblumenauer We must also believe and support kavenaugh also until proven guilt in a court of law.		Added that for you so you didn't sound bias and potentially victim blaming.
With 83 percent confidence I will say another accusation of sexual misconduct against #Kavanaugh will appear right after this one goes away and they get ready to vote again.		Delay until after midterms by any means necessary is the name of the game.
@jonathanbest17 @TheBeatWithAri @SenBlumenthal It won't go anywhere. It's most likely a delay tactic and I bet another accusation will pop up right before the next vote.
@DCLascelle @TheBeatWithAri @SenBlumenthal Just say what you mean.		We must prolong this confirmation hearing passed the midterms by any means necessary so democrats can take the Senate and he will not get confirmed.		I'd have more respect for honesty.
@ArseGrammatica @TheBeatWithAri @Trth2Pwer68 @SenBlumenthal It's easy to say. I was not at this party that I sexually assaulted someone. You don't have to know when and where it occurred. You just need to know he was not a party where he sexually assaulted this woman.
@SenWarren Brett Kavenaugh also deserves to be heard and treated with respect until found guilty in a court of law. Why can't you say that also?
@Frank_Sturgell @mhickey187 @thehill Just curious, why do you think you umarmed black men get shot by cops at a higher rate than any other race or sex?
@RepJayapal Maybe because we have enough illegal immigrants we need to process first. So may stop encouraging illegal immigration so we have a bigger quota for the ones that want to do it right and become congressmen someday.
@NextChapterNow_ @chrislhayes @SenFeinstein @NBCNews You openly generalize hate towards all men. Bet you don't even see what's wrong with that either.
@truemondolulu @chrislhayes @SenFeinstein @NBCNews So? If she wants be heard she has her chance.
@DaveTone @chrislhayes @SenFeinstein @NBCNews They investigated him more than most living humans already. Just say it. We want to delay this until after midterms so there is a good chance he won't get confirmed. I'd have more respect for honesty.
@pbyguy1 @PattyMurray Because we don't like trump! Or something.
@PattyMurray Weed.
@mhickey187 @thehill Unarmed men and women. Fixed it for you. Didn't want to make you sound like a #racebaiter or #genderbaiter.
@thehill This is like doing breast cancer awareness fundraisers still. We get it. Everyone knows. No need to keep doing it. The awareness is there. It has been. Job accomplished. Now let's work on unity.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera Was also debunked because they were taken out of context. Can't believe everything you read online.		You CAN'T show me one proof of perjury without linking to an article. Look at the complete transcript and the complete email. Perjury did NOT happen.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera He did not. You might want to look up what it takes to be convicted of perjury.		The professor has also given multiple different stories. Do you immediately throw out her story now?
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera @FBI No. She did.		I'm not talking about the name. There would be no need to release the name if DiFi didn't make a press release this existed. She should have let the authorities handle it. Because of her, now she was doxxed.		https://t.co/CR82ed4KAq
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera I 100% agree it was a joke with Fraken. I don't think he should have left. But you are comparing two completely different items.		I 100% think Kavenaugh is innocent until proven guilty. Right now he is 100% innocent and should not step down or leave.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera DiFi gave the info to the FBI but then publicly released it. She released the info. If she didn't release the info then FBI could do their investigation and if he was guilty then they could publicly announce that.		Her identity was found out due to DiFi releasing the info.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera Franken stepped down because there was photo evidence. Unless there is photos of kavenaugh doing this you can't compare the two.		Kavanaugh could be the victim in this. You have to admit that is a possibility. Until then, both are possibly guilty and both are possible the victim.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera So the professor has spoken out against Diane for releasing the story without her permission?		If you don't want the information to be release, you don't write a letter and send it to a senator.		She wanted it released too.
@Pookyroo @primacornice @BistyCSRoss @sarahkendzior @senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley @GOP No one wants to take away womens rights. That's just absurd to think that.
@Pookyroo @primacornice @BistyCSRoss @sarahkendzior @senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley @GOP What does one have to do with the other?
@mki_mom @JWGOP He has never said a POTUS is above the law. He specifically speaks about how a president should be impeached prior to receiving an indictment. Which is how it works. You are just spreading false information.
@jimlu @SenatorMenendez Just to be clear, that's a lie.
@Pookyroo @primacornice @BistyCSRoss @sarahkendzior @senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley @GOP Not a Trump supporter. Not mental gymnastics.		If you think they didn't prepare for this hearing and were just going to wing it, that's far from reality. Sorry.
@kesayers @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera So don't write the letter for one. Also blame Diane finestien for releasing it.		My only point was if DiFi thought this was credible she should have brought it to the authorities immediately. By waiting, it only shows she did it for political reasons.
@NBCNews That seems cheap. They must not be doing anything as well as I thought.
@KelseyHewlett To recap: if you have proof of them being a sexual predator you should report it to authorities. If not, then you should use the word alleged because neither have been proven.
@primacornice @BistyCSRoss @sarahkendzior @senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley @GOP They knew the Democrats would likely pull this stunt, yes. So they prepared by getting woman to vouch for him. Why wouldn't you prepare to be smeared?
@ekbuckley Stop victim blaming. Kavanaugh could be the victim in this too.
@primacornice @ver1tasaequ1tas @sarahkendzior @WaPoSean @JeffFlake Wow. How many lies can you fit in one tweet?
@RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera She did come forward. A while ago. People are complaining on why it took so long after that for DiFi to report it. Wasn't serious enough?
@HBoisdeHypnosis @ConservativeSco @Heminator @davidharsanyi Did you read the therapist notes? It's vague. Could describe a few hundred thousand different people.
@YouFoundGOD @thehill Why wouldn't you think it matters? If someone tells you they were raped why wouldn't you report it immediately? Rape isn't important enough?
@RealDonJackson @ABC @KimKardashian I'll buy that.
@stabenow Agree. She has a week to show up if she wishes to be heard.
@knotahaiku @FoxNews @SteveHiltonx @NextRevFNC @ezraklein They already did.
@ABC What insight would a rapper have to give about systemic criminal justice reform? What makes him educated and an expert on this topic?
@SenatorHassan We must also ensure Judge Kavenaugh gets treated with dignity until proven guilty.		Fixed your Tweet for you. Didn't want you to seem biased.
@AZ_Bobby @thehill Name one thing that has prevented him from doing his job.
@DaniloPaolucci @AnaCabrera @RepJayapal Agree. If it's proven. Until then, innocent.
@RepAdams I'd recommend you waiting until it is verified before calling it brave.
@Shawntherealway @eligit @thehill Well I dint know for sure obviously. It's just a hunch. The claim could very well be credible.
@TobyMGMKE @WestonJK @PattyMurray Doesn't change the fact he could be. But people with such strong confirmation bias towards kavenaugh due to being a victim of political rhetoric would never see him as innocent until proven guilty. That's a shame.
@TobyMGMKE @WestonJK @PattyMurray People blaming a potential victim is disgusting. Both are potentially the victim right now.
@DarwinWaditaka @thehill How could he possibly save trump?
@Shawntherealway @eligit @thehill Because if she brought it up in July the would have had time to get another nominee in and confirmed before the midterms. If necessary that is.		But by doing it at last minute it could be possible it might wait until after mid term. Doubt it.		So she used rape as a political tool
@RepBobbyRush 1. My health care stayed the same.	2. My wages greatly increased.	3. I still have a job.	4. Debt always grows. So, ya. Your fault budget man.	5. No clue what you mean about social security.
@gabriel_hrc99 @thehill You don't know which one is the victim right now. Quit victim blaming.
@SeaCons @RepJayapal @CNN @AnaCabrera Both of them are actually innocent until proven guilty.
@JGreenblattADL How many are victims of child smuggling? How many came with parents? Your numbers mean nothing without context.
@bbramble1957 @thehill Cause Democrats have used this tactic before so it's better to be prepared is my guess.
@budarydachas @thehill Women that sexually assault men are also. Fixed it for you. Didn't want you to sound sexist.
@TheOfficialPORP @thehill @GOP Maybe it's worth it to prepare for anything and the democrats have been known to use sexual assault accusations as a political tool? But I agree, it's sad they would have to do this.
@PercentNaija @thehill Seriously? You don't really believe that, right?
@bennie2128 @amyklobuchar They forwarded it to the white house. Not exactly sure why.
@amyklobuchar He didn't for a delay.
@WestonJK @PattyMurray Quit victim blaming.
@thehill I'd wait to get the story collaborated before being proud.
@amyklobuchar FBI already said they won't. Now what?
@renegademom @JohnWDean @politico What's the right thing?
@justfetz_b @CNN Well I guess it could have been drafted with the help of a lawyer. That would explain it.		Typically there would be more deviation including using HE and not specifically just the last name.
@CNN Odd she calls him Kavenaugh multiple times. Not Brett. Not Brett Kavenaugh. Just Kavenaugh.		Suspicious to me.
@CNNPolitics Anyone find it odd she calls him Kavenaugh and not Brett in the email? Or at least Brett Kavenaugh?
@GR8FL @FoxNews If it was that simple then people would be in jail already. First you need to provide evidence. Wake me up when that happens.
@TrumpIsKnownAs @GovMikeHuckabee Ok good. As long as you are then it makes me feel better. Was just assuming you did since posted about Trump on a non related story. My bad.
@TrumpIsKnownAs @GovMikeHuckabee How can you go through life with Trump on your brain 24/7? Must be difficult.
@thehill Pretty sure I saw a white student there also that was causing most the problems. But whatever. #racebaiting is cool.
Brett Kavanaugh could be the victim here.	Christine Blasey Ford could be the victim here.		NEITHER should be treated as guilty or the victim until proven in a court of law. Innocent until proven guilty is still part of American Human Rights.
@PeterWelch I hope both people involved receive the respect and dignity to which they are entitled until someone is found guilty in a court of law.
@thehill Well duh. If they could then it wouldn't have gone to the special counsel.
@ImikSabi @DonaldJesusTrum @FoxNews Well glad you admitted they mean nothing to you. Enjoy.
@ImikSabi @DonaldJesusTrum @FoxNews This is not even close to the same thing unless they were sending top secret information from said accounts.
@ImikSabi @DonaldJesusTrum @FoxNews Oh really? Who was this that had classified email on an unclassified server besides Hillary?		Not saying you are wrong. Just never heard this before and would like to look that up.
@trumptowers2 @RepAdamSchiff @GOP @realDonaldTrump I did NOT say either way. My personal opinion is I don't believe her right now until there is evidence, which there isn't.		People on both sides should NOT be automatically assuming guilt or innocence right now. If you are doing that to Kavenaugh, you are just as bad as them.
@trumptowers2 @RepAdamSchiff @GOP @realDonaldTrump I think it's disgusting that people are possibly victim shaming Kavenaugh right now.
@ZerlinaMaxwell Please don't smear Kavenaugh until you know that he is not the victim also. Thanks.
@ImikSabi @DonaldJesusTrum @FoxNews That is not even what the case was about. They could have had private email servers and only passed unclassified emails. This was unauthorized also, but it's not what the case was about.		She had classified emails on an unclassified system. That is the illegal part.
@trumptowers2 @RepAdamSchiff @GOP @realDonaldTrump Ok. You win. He raped her.
@trumptowers2 @RepAdamSchiff @GOP @realDonaldTrump What was the question on the polygraph that was asked?		I made up the number obviously because the description is vague.		How can you be certain Kavenaugh is not the victim here and you are the one victim blaming?
@JamesNemec @Bunthiery @AP #cyberbully
@laurenmychael @Agnescitizen @jewlish @AP She didn't mention his name. It could be narrowed down to a few hundred thousand different people by her description.
@trumptowers2 @RepAdamSchiff @GOP @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately the therapists notes does not mention him by name and it only narrows it down to approximately 250,007 people she could have been referring to.
@CallMeSox @RepBrendanBoyle @CongressRTBot What was the question and who administered it?
@BrennaDawkins @thehill How do you KNOW who the victim is right now? Could you at least possibly admit that Kavenaugh could be the victim in this?
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump What would you like an answer to?
@BrennaDawkins @thehill That's political rhetoric. For one Kavenaugh has NEVER said a president is above the law. He said a President should not be indicted until after they are impeached. Which is how it works. 		Then media/politicians change that to him saying what you said. Which is a lie.
@BrennaDawkins @thehill How do you KNOW who the victim is right now? Could you at least possibly admit that Kavenaugh could be the victim in this?
@BrennaDawkins @miguel9288 @thehill No. Hillary was proven guilty of having classified emails on an unclassified system. She ADMITS it. The FBI CONFIRMS it. But she was not charged.		Don't get the words innocent mixed up there.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Odd question to ask a Twitter bot.
@BrennaDawkins @thehill Just think what you are doing. You 100% absolutely ready to crucify this man of rape without zero evidence. You are ready to end this mans career over an allegation. That is what is absolutely disgusting to me.		Innocent until proven guilty.
@BrennaDawkins @miguel9288 @thehill Innocent until proven guilty. It's still a thing. Try it out.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Which website or sources have I steered you towards besides google and your cyber bulling definition? Are you really going to waste your time on Sunday with someone you expect isn't human?
@BrennaDawkins @thehill You don't think they wouldn't prepare and have written statements of character ready? I'd expect them to be prepared.
@miguel9288 @BrennaDawkins @thehill No he didn't. That has been widely debunked since it was taken out of context by dirty politicians who started the rumor.
@BrennaDawkins @thehill Anything? Really? Anything?

@summersun5280 @thehill I do not.
@bahiawilson @CNN No reason? No reason?		Democrats are preaching we will do ANYTHING to stop the confirmation. ANYTHING. That's your reason right now.
@BrennaDawkins @thehill No he didn't. Don't believe everything you read on the internet.
@maziehirono This is disgusting politics and you all should be ashamed.
@thehill Sorry. Don't believe you and I hope you go to jail if you are found out to be lying.		If you can prove he did it though, I hope he gets punished too. But my money is on you're a liar right now.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump As a software developer I can 100% without a doubt tell you there is no bot that exists that can interact in a conversation like this. You might want to even research what a bot is since you like using the term so much.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump You suggesting I am not even a human is most certainly #cyberbullying. Maybe you should read about it.		https://t.co/6ngZVp8w40
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Telling on myself? Are you under the impression I am a Republican or a Democrat? I am neither. I believe neither. I support neither.		For you to suggest I am not even a real person because my political beliefs makes you a #cyberbully. I'm not a human due to my opinion? WTF?
@AntiquesDuo @GrippleDeGrap @TIME Cool story. Thanks to the #metoo movement it requires a hell of a lot more than that to convince me. It would require him to be found guilty in a court of law by a jury. Until then, innocent until proven guilty.
@TIME Hope when this is said and done one of these things happen.		He goes to jail for sexual assault.	She goes to jail for lying.		One of the two needs to happen.
@joshuaharbour @beantowndleelee @1WillWallace @FoxNews #confirmationbias is the only reason you believe her.
@Kakeman64 @diddledog65 @FoxNews #cyberbully says what?
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Both sides politicians, media, and supporters ignore certain facts and truths to further their political agenda. Confirmation bias.		The dangerous part is when people believe that one side does and the other doesn't. Thats when you know they have been manipulated by rhetoric.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Exactly. So do your research and come up with your own conclusions.
@VoteLindaPritch @MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Google is a search engine that can be used to research facts. Should Google what Google is.
@MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump I've already told you the answer is on Google.  I'm not your research buddy or care to convince you.
@GR8FL @FoxNews Two IG's completed stated zero evidence of Russian collusion.		9 months of FBI investigation concluded no Russian collusion.		Bob Woodward last book said no evidence of Russian collusion, but tried very hard to find some.		The list can go on. But I get it, confirmation bias...
@MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Manafort is a lobbyist and he has worked for both sides. He doesn't care. He is out for himself to make him rich.		My original point is not wrong. He was working with Democrats during the time of the majority of these charges. So guilty by association is what she was claiming.
@realDailyWire With money. Next question.
@MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump You can type that into Google to get your answer if you truly are interested.		Also I used the words "worked with" not "worked for".
@DonaldJesusTrum @ImikSabi @FoxNews Deny all you want. 		Hillary Clinton does not deny she broke the law. The FBI does not deny she broke the law.		You denying it means nothing.
@MartinB323 @RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Meant to say Democrats, not specifically the DNC.
@grahamsw @GR8FL @FoxNews Damn? You know they did for sure? I'm guessing some people might want to talk to you and get your statement and proof. #bombshell #wegothim
@ImikSabi @FoxNews Hillary most certainly did break a serious law. She admits it. FBI proved it. Everyone knows it.		She had classified information on an unclassified system. Most people go to jail regardless of intent. She just got a get out of jail free card because her status. But she is guilty
@GR8FL @FoxNews So nothing to do with Russia? Just witch hunt until you find a crime?
@davidlahwhoelse @realDailyWire "101 Ways to Make Money off of Trump Hate Mania". Also known as, "How to Trick Liberals Into Supporting Capitalism".
@Kirk4Defiance @benshapiro Understand. But I think he is getting to the level where it's sometimes not the best idea to even address it because it will bring more attention to it than there was in the first place. We shall see.
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump Manafort indictments were during the time he worked with the DNC. So if you believe what you are saying, you are just as corrupt as him.
@thehill #journalism
@Kirk4Defiance @benshapiro Just quickly reading the story and source I'd just assume it was something that was being reported as fact that turned out not to be. But I'm not educated enough about Israel to even attempt to speak about it.		Doesn't seem like a big deal to me though.
@Kirk4Defiance @benshapiro No one can control who supports them. I don't even see the point of wanting to know.
@CNNPolitics It shouldn't be. If democrats don't take over then something is seriously wrong. They should easily take it following a POTUS election where they lost.
@valkyrie_hanna @GrippleDeGrap @thehill Did we watch the same video? He walked away and was trying to leaved and they followed and harassed him, 4 on 1. If like you see how you respond to that.
@PikachuSerena @thehill Where did he mention this?
@thehill It was mostly against another white dude. Honesty, I don't blame him the way they followed and harassed him.
@thehill If Trump said this to anyone you would be screaming for him to be impeached. But since it was said TO Trump its funny, justified, and you see nothing morally wrong with it.		That's how you know you have #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome
@jyribe All politicians and media push fear. ALL.
@jyribe How would you reading the news and talking it about it every day prevent any of this?
@jyribe I'd rather not just be a victim of fear mongering. Good luck living with fear and hate 24/7.
@Vladimi28669662 @KyleMoncks @CBSNews Some people go out and have real personal relationships with humans to be part of society.		Some people sit online in a dark room typing on Twitter late at night because they have no one thay wants human contact with them.		I have a good feeling which one you are.
@RoKhanna The democrats party raised like a billion dollars over the last few years, right?		So if what you say is true why can't they just divert that money to the big bad Republicans and buy their vote? It's over double what the pacs donated. Should be easy, right? #math
@Vladimi28669662 @CBSNews Innocent until proven guilty. Prove it.
@HuffPost #journalism
@ChrisPB81528298 @BurnerCapital @thehill Sure did seem like white on white for most of it. Stop #racebaiting.
@thehill WHY DO YOU NEED TO MENTION THE PERSONS COLOR OF SKIN!?
@NBCNews People don't NOT believe it isn't real. The argument is what is the exact cause and what we can do, if anything, to reverse it.		Half the people want to throw money at it. Half the people want to wait until we know for sure.
@jyribe If you think people are going to starve and die if you stop following politics I don't know what else I can tell you. I'd hope you would be able to see how silly that statement is.
@SomeguyinAmeri1 @adriana7077 @thehill Yes. All boycotts are pointless. But I wouldnt generalize trump supporters as being unable to afford a shity play.
@gvravel @thehill Try character assassination or smear campaign. I won't even call it an allegation unless a law enforcement department decides to investigate.
@thehill Was she there or something? If not, don't care.
@adriana7077 @thehill Probably the same as when the left boycotted chicken sandwiches and cheese burgers. Pointless.
@RobBanksToday @thehill Do it then.
@krassenstein Some people vote for policies the candidates support and not where they out their penis.
@KamalaHarris Or possibly get them medical attention that they need and stop trying to treat physiological issues with love.
@gigilaws @thehill No. I tend to stay on topic.
@gigilaws @thehill What does any of this have to do with Hillary? Why do you keep bringing up something else?
@_SavvyCat_ @TheSwordOfDoom1 @jaketapper I'm just stating the facts and not projecting. I do not buy into this crap that the victim is being smeared. This story is being pushed by the left media for the purpose of #racebaiting. That is it.
@_SavvyCat_ @TheSwordOfDoom1 @jaketapper Are you attempting to say in order for them to investigate the crime scene they don't need a search warrant? They can just go browsing around without it?
@_SavvyCat_ @TheSwordOfDoom1 @jaketapper The Dallas Police DID NOT do this.		They included what they found at the scene. They didn't say who it was. This is basic police work.		The left media is the one that spread this crap. It's called #racebaiting.		Yes. One local network aired a segment which I disagree with also.
@crookedmedia @brianschatz Such dishonesty. Stop misleading people.
@RobBanksToday @thehill You are a #cyberbully. At least what I stated is a fact and can be proven. What you said can't.
@KamalaHarris Let's drop identity politics and celebrate being Americans, as one, united.
@thehill That's historically a given, yes. Should be no surprise. The surprise would be if they keep the House.
@thehill Would be a lot cooler if they were wearing sheep costumes.
@thehill I demand we stop giving political power to actors.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT I don't care who or what people have sex with. No one should.
@_SavvyCat_ @TheSwordOfDoom1 @jaketapper Who exactly is THEY?		I saw one local news station say something about it. That was it. One local news station.		Then people took that and proclaimed a LARGE amount of people were doing this. No, one idiot ran a story at a local news station.
@Love072110 @mlportn @CovfefeTwat @ABC @realDonaldTrump Universal Declaration of Human Rights.		"Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense."
@TheSwordOfDoom1 @jaketapper I dont believe anyone is stating otherwise. Think the consesus is she committed murder and will be punished accordingly.
@RepGraceMeng Should be proud to fight for all Americans and not just Hispanics. But what do I know. I'm not a politician.
@narceducator @jdawsey1 Agree. The narrative was tightly controlled under Obama. Or you talking about Trump where the narrative changes daily? Confused.
@Cambi_J @jdawsey1 You realize you just started a rumor criticizing someone for potential spreading rumors?
@tfilson59 @jdawsey1 I think there are too many of those already.
@Love072110 @mlportn @CovfefeTwat @ABC @realDonaldTrump What is your point? Do you dislike Paul Manafort this much?		He is just another sleazy lobbyist that is going to do some jail time. What's your obsession with him? Why is this person effecting your emotions? Did he used to pick on you in school or something?
@HuffPost Lesson #1. Evacuate when they tell you to.
@RenClive1 @LouisCyfer666 @CBSNews Watch? That means it's not proven, yet. That means innocent until proven guilty. That means... Wait for it... Alleged.
@LouisCyfer666 @RenClive1 @CBSNews Alleged.
@nenyloks @CBSNews White power? Really?
@BookkeeperQueen @CBSNews @rolandsmartin That's not the message kaepernick is pushing.
@AllenHyman5 @CBSNews Perhaps they are a business and they know how to market to make money.
@mlportn @Love072110 @CovfefeTwat @ABC What's the point of insulting me and then posting an article with no information to support an argument?		There is nothing that says Manafort is going to cooperate with Mueller to take down trump. Or anything to do with Trump. All you will read is speculation and hope. That's it.
@gigilaws @thehill "about to"		Do you realize you say something is going to happen a lot? Also realize it never does?
@Love072110 @CovfefeTwat @ABC Yes. But specifically for John podesta and the other democrats along with the law firm he worked for during this time frame. Nothing to do with Trump.
@chamberhands @thehill But but trump. There can be more than one person who is a racist in the world.
@CovfefeTwat @ABC @Love072110 Try reading the indictment that ABC isn't telling you about. Go learn for yourself if you really care and don't want for others to tell you how to feel on both sides.
@thehill Bye #racist.
@CBSNews This is an example of fake news in case you were ever curious on why people keep saying it.
@jyribe That is false. Every member? Every?		I think you need to take a break from politics. Just calm down, don't read anymore updates, and wait for the special counsel to be over. Seems you are a little to emotionally involved in this.
@jyribe Meant to say Manafort.
@JanieMom @BrookeHearn843 @NBCNews @MSNBC #CyberBully
@1_Smooth1 @NBCNews @MSNBC #racebaiting is not a game. Grow up. This is not racist. This is not a white power hand gesture. I almost think you might want it to be so you could complain.
@NBCNews @MSNBC OK NBC. Knock this shit off.
@thehill But but Hillary.
@jyribe That's your opinion. Doesn't change the facts.		He is innocent until proven guilty. Luckily we don't live in a country that some random Twitter account determines innocence or guilt.
@jyribe Mueller is guilty. I never said otherwise.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle I don't recall trump saying that either.
@jyribe The indictment for Manafort that was released today. 		Both IG reports that state there is no evidence of collusion. 		I don't trust anything from any media outlet. I will await the results of the special counsel like I belive everyone should. Innocent until proven guilty.
@jyribe I can't follow what you are attempting to say.
@jyribe @MaddowBlog So you read the indictments that came out first, right? Obviously not or we wouldn't be having this conversation.
@CA_Talesh @NBCNews Might want to google the word Treason. Not sure if you know what it actually means.
@RoKhanna Cause MOST Americans may not agree with you even though you say MOST Americans do?
@WilmingtonPD Sorry but if someone wants to go towards a power line maybe it's best for society that you just let it happen.
@nopedontwanna13 @MaddowBlog @PressSec Did you read the indictments? This specifically has to deal with a long time ago. Think you are going to be disappointed.
@jyribe @MaddowBlog Piling up? There is still zero evidence. Where do you get this stuff?
@gangstagrillzup @thehill You come off very #racist.
@LightningDuck @washingtonpost Agree. He's been at it for a long time.
@thehill You fight for a porn star while showing off her boobies.
@JohnWDean Delete this fake tweet. You are misleading people with lies.
@deejayquai @thehill And all nothing to do with collusion with the Russians to help trump win. Sorry, I don't care about tax fraud lobbiest or people that will serve a few days in jail for getting caught up in a lie.
@washingtonpost In Obamas swamp. Let's make that clear. Don't want to sound biased.
@washingtonpost Doesn't he call a lot of names to trump? Welcome to politics.
@lizajaneok @KamalaHarris If you're sick of it then turn off the news. It's just #fear and #hate to get you to vote how they want you to. That's it. So if you are emotionally effected by political rhetoric then it's time to stop listening to it. It's easy. Life will dramatically improve.
@thehill That should win the yearly fear mongering weather award.
@saulnierg @washingtonpost Same with all politicians and all media outlets. Let's not just pretend trump is the only liar here.
@ArseGrammatica @seanhannity According to the indictments looks like he will clear up podestas involvement, not trumps.
@mandymais @nowthisnews @CarmenYulinCruz There are 2 lying politicians here. You can either choose to believe one or the other, or neither. Not sure why some people don't consider the third option.
@RepJayapal @HouseGOP World leaders conversations should remain classified. I don't care who's POTUS.
@BillClinton I think you were a great president, but this is not true. Hillary make you post this? Or is this Hillary? Get off of his account woman!
@thehill Goodbye #racist.
@VoteYesOnPropB Think you should reconsider what is a basic necessity. One can live on minimum wage. Won't have a car, cell phone, internet bill, TV in every room, etc. But you can live off of it.		Should teach responsible spending.
@pbump Remember that when this is over.
@jRobertJohnson @ProudResister But but but Russia.		--- This response
@BeeMcG8 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Have proof of this claim they were hired because they are dishonest and criminal? 		I bet you criticize Trump for his baseless lying tweets too. Do you not realize you are doing the exact same thing? #cyberbully		Assuming I will be blocked now, right?
@flywithkamala @KamalaHarris Release all your emails @KamalaHarris! #WhatAreTheyHiding
@KamalaHarris Lets vote on candidates with a vagina! I can't even right now, your message is so far off base. You won't ever be POTUS.
@gigilaws @thehill 1. Both sides are the same.	2. My stance is anti media. The opposite party of the POTUS is typically the one doing the smear campaigns and that's who I focus on.	3. Military is taught to support the POTUS unconditionally. There's a good reason which obviously you don't know.
@gigilaws @thehill There it is. It's coming.		 I'm an innocent until proven guilty type of guy. You can choose to believe all this crap on TV if you want. Just keep track of what actually becomes true so maybe you will realize one day.
@gigilaws @thehill All the allegations of treason, collusion, corruption, etc on Trump. What has came of it? Why he is still president if something apparently came of it?		Guessing your response is "it takes time" or "it's coming". This is the same answer as "nothing came of it".
@ABC Didn't the FBI already say they won't investigate this?
@FoxNews I can't believe this is true.
@BlakeUsry1 @LadyBleach @thehill Clearly you don't know how to rate IQ or Intelligence then. These two men, even though they say some stuff you might agree with, are not morons by any means. Don't think any intelligent person would agree with you on that one.
@GlickRick @ConnorsDoscs @washingtonpost Agree. I don't know why you are arguing this.
@LadyBleach @BlakeUsry1 @thehill He said Ben's IQ was low which we all know that's a lie. It's a direct insult at his intelligence because he does not agree with his opinion.
@gigilaws @thehill That's because that's what the news is saying 24/7. Doesn't mean it's true.		Out of all these allegations, nothing is came of it. Both sides suck.
@BRGFCL1982 @washingtonpost @SenFeinstein Except the FBI already said they won't investigate it. Probably not credible enough. I don't know though.
@sousibrown @thehill @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker So you are completely aware of how the Supreme Court was not politicized for 150 years, right? How 2% of the rulings were on party lines. How presidents nominated opposite party judges. How they NEVER did a smear campaign. How the votes were never split in the Senate. Right?
@sousibrown @thehill @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Ok. Good luck with that.
@GlickRick @ConnorsDoscs @washingtonpost I'm not arguing against you. The Senate will only vote on items that the whip has determined might pass so they don't waste their time.		But Mitch didn't give that excuse. Made some other BS up.		My point was if Republicans were the minority they would have smeared Garland too.
@GlickRick @ConnorsDoscs @washingtonpost Yes. Both candidates are perfectly qualified for the seat. One just never got far enough for the Republicans to smear the crap out of his character. Which they would have done if they were the minority.
@ConnorsDoscs @washingtonpost I agree. That was dirty politics too. @SenatorReid with the nuclear options was too. Smearing a SCOTUS nominee most definitely is also.		You will NOT throw a strawman argument at me and expect me to defend it. There are people that can see there is no GOOD side.
@sousibrown @thehill @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker He has not been caught lying. You have been told he has. But it is easily proven false when put in context. I would NOT listen to any news about this hearing.		I'd research how the Supreme Court worked for 150 years. It was NOT like this. It was NOT politicized.
@BRGFCL1982 @washingtonpost Innocent until proven guilty. I agree with you.		If found to be a sham, she should be removed and sent to jail. Odds are it's a BS political move and you have to know that.
@washingtonpost Just call it what it is. Dirty politics. Lies. Character assassination. Smear campaign. Disgusting.		She should be removed from office for a stunt like this.
@sousibrown @thehill @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker That's because most people are being TOLD that's not enough due to politicization. It was plenty for well more than a century and a half. It should be plenty now.
@guypbenson They found a bullet in him too that didn't belong to him. THIEF!
@sousibrown @thehill @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Just not transparency. Any and every document they ever seen no matter the classification if it has anything to do with them or not. That's comparable. Not just transparency.		Kavenaugh public rulings is transparency enough for most people.
@sousibrown @thehill Bet you will be the first in line to ask for @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker entire document and email record they had the privilege to view during their time in the Senate when they run for POTUS, right? #WhatAreTheyHiding		No. You won't ask and neither will I because it's dumb.
@barrymanilowjr @thehill Why not? If they didn't then it would take a year to get every single document cleared. Waste of time. It's dirty politics. Why support this behavior? If
@gigilaws @thehill Politicians on both side are corrupt! There, I said.
@Debwilker @PhilipRucker I will. This Washington Post article lies. There. Happy?
@jahimes Isn't violence to anyone illegal? Why do you need one for just woman? Guessing this covers woman on man domestic violence too?
@LadyBleach @BlakeUsry1 @thehill Cyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and Cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.[1] 		Insulting a persons intellect is #CyberBulling.
@jmc663 @BlakeUsry1 @LadyBleach @thehill You seriously don't know what #CyberBulling is? 		https://t.co/qjJkxE1W1U
@BlakeUsry1 @LadyBleach @thehill You are insulting them. You are being a #CyberBully.
@LadyBleach @BlakeUsry1 @thehill False. Might want to google the definition.
@BlakeUsry1 @thehill Found the #CyberBully.
@RepLloydDoggett So you expected this to happen instantly?
@SenFeinstein This story doesn't agree with your numbers. Where are you getting these statistics? Must be very cherry picked.		https://t.co/E7aScpNjFH
@RepJoeKennedy Delicious #racebaiting.
@HFACDemocrats Submit dumb requests, get dumb responses.
@CitizenGrime @RepBarragan While I somewhat agree I do see he has more unnecessary negatively spun press than any other president I've ever witnessed. Jimmy Carter agrees.
@RepRobinKelly California doesn't have that law already?
@CitizenGrime @RepBarragan I don't disagree. All I'm saying is if there is a bee going around stinging people then maybe you shouldn't keep swatting at it to make it more angry.
@ManicMark @SenMarkey You forgot to divide your algorithm by pie.
@blahblah8976 Simple test.		Do you think one side is good and the other is bad?	Do you think one side is dumb and the other is smart?	Do you think one side goes of facts and the other doesn't?		If you answered yes to any of these you have been manipulated by the media and politicians.
@RepBarragan This is what happens when you attack someone 24/7. The media created Donald Trump. Take responsibility. Fix it.
@ManicMark @SenMarkey Agree both sides do. My comment was just mirroring the tweet format and its currently being done by Democrats. With Obama it was done by Republicans. 		Either way, it's wrong.
@angeliquevw @RepSwalwell A thousandaire giving advice to a billionaire.
@andrea_kisiner @RepSwalwell @iamalykto Proof?
@SRD_SCH @RepSwalwell This is what happens when #CyberBullying is acceptable and encouraged.
@RepSwalwell #racebaiting is not cool.
@CoryBooker Think most people see right through fake Spartacus. You will not be POTUS.
@blahblah8976 Please take my advice seriously. Life doesn't need to be full of hate and fear for things you cant control like federal politics. You are being used and manipulated for a vote. This goes for both sides. Life can be better if you let it.
@TrumpityDumpity @SenatorMenendez The hurricane was responsible for the deaths, #CyberBully.
@blahblah8976 @SenMarkey You are sick. Please stop following politics for your own good. It has clearly effected you negatively if you truly believe this and not just being a jack ass.
@SenatorMenendez Blaming the deaths of a natural disaster on the president. That is disgusting behavior for a senator. Seriously. Doesn't the senate have a code of ethics where this type of hate speech is forbidden?
@SenMarkey Only democrats can politicize a natural disaster.
@nancysuzyq @brianschatz So? Are you a comptroller and are telling us they can't save lives now due to a budget shortage? Fact is you have no clue what this means but it's anti Trump.
@FatNixon2018 @brianschatz @MomRovin Democrats have been saying this for DECADES as #fearmongering for an election. Never came true.		Why wouldn't they did this already when they control all 3 branches? Why would they wait until after the mid terms? Doesn't pass the smell test.
@StuartPadiso @thehill Trump did not start cyber bullying. It's been around for a long time. He participates, yes. But he did not start it.		Returning hate with hate is not justified or productive.
@StuartPadiso @thehill If you follow Physiology at all you would know that is impossible. You need to start within and lead by example. Let your journey to  happiness begin.
@thehill I think we should do less #CyberBullying.
@clbirds @mark_msmith856 @johnpalmay @CoryBooker The founders never intended people to politicize the Supreme Court either. For the first 150 years at least politics were not involved. Only 2 percent of votes were down party lines. Presidents nominated opposite party candidates. Then shit happened. It sucks. But things changed.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @seanhannity Just post it now. We don't care about ratings.
@mark_msmith856 @johnpalmay @CoryBooker I understand, I also think it was wrong. Even if he had no shot they should have just given him a hearing. Think they didn't because it would have riled up the Democrat base right before the election.		But what I was explaining is typical Senate procedures.
@mark_msmith856 @johnpalmay @CoryBooker Garland didn't get a shot because that's how procedures work in the Senate. If the whip knows there's no enough votes and it will fail the majority leader typically never brings it to the senate and vote to waste time. He wasn't going to get confirmed so it never went forward.
@CoryBooker Fake Spartacus.
@KamalaHarris Should focus on homeless and maybe cost of living before no one lives there but the homeless.
@Shimha18 @thehill Pay attention to what? You must not have read the article. It specifically said the water was turned over to the local government who let it sit there for a year.
@Yaucolion71 @thehill @realDonaldTrump Did you read the article? They did their job, delivered the water and turned it over to the local government who let it sit there for a year. So yes, it was a good job on the federal government side.
@chris08018 @politico You can't buy a senators vote on something like a scotus seat. Not a chance. But I guess waste your money if they want to.
@politico How? By becoming senators?
@COResists @mlportn @CBSNews Sounds like you are a #CyberBully.
@mlportn @CBSNews He's donated some and profited. He profited off the cause. Nothing you can post can change that fact. So has Nike, a lot.
@KayVay55 @MaddowBlog Why? Research all you want but you can't change anything. All it will cause is being upset. That's how both sides play people. Get you mad, get you to vote. Research, just don't take anything seriously. That is if you are truly getting emotional. If it was a figure of speech, OK.
@AP Authors sure are finding away for liberals to support capitalism, which I thought they hated cause it don't work.
@politico How? Wouldn't they need to be a senator to vote?
@mlportn @CBSNews These are exclusive. I can dislike Kap for profiting off his "cause" and dislike police brutality.
@dickinsonian @thehill @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake @SenateMajLdr How do you lie about roe being settled law?
@BishesBrew @thehill Lies.
@KayVay55 @MaddowBlog If you are truly upset, then they won. They used #fear and and #hate to get you to vote Democrat. Personally I wouldn't vote for people that prey on me and for me into #depression. Just stop following the news if it makes you upset. Promise your life will improve.
@NBCNews Too bad handguns still win by a longshot for gun related deaths. Who cares about a small number of active shooter incidents when you have thousands times more with handguns? Why focus on the small potatoes?
@GuywhoTweets18 @guypbenson Why can't we just not support violence from either side?
@thehill All about the money.
@krassenstein It's congress and the senates also. Everyone that voted for it.
@RepMarkMeadows Where do these new texts come from?
@devinher @mkraju There's a lot more people that support the current policies than Trump himself.
@pennyparker0523 @KamalaHarris @AlasscanIsBack @GOP You seriously need new news sources. I originally asked if you can link at least one of these together on your own that constitutes perjury. Linking to propaganda does not fulfill that.		Have you looked at the proof or facts yourself? Do you know what it takes for perjury?
@pennyparker0523 @KamalaHarris @AlasscanIsBack @GOP Now read.		https://t.co/HKODdIGgXP
@catamount96 @thehill Has NK been building nukes, shooting missiles, or displaying them in their military parade? What would satisfy you? Trump not being president?
@pennyparker0523 @KamalaHarris @AlasscanIsBack @GOP Merrick Garland is an APPEALS court judge. Do you understand that a perjury case would not be going to an APPEALS court?		I'd highly recommend not just listening to the news. Garland WON'T be judging this and current is not even close to being perjury.
@andreaswalec @VDEM Not sure if that covers where you live. But I've found local news have static maps you might want to visit their sites.
@andreaswalec @VDEM That website is getting hammered right now. But you can check on 		https://t.co/NSNRu3lJOF
@RepDelBene When people can afford their own food it most certainly does indicate a stronger economy.
@pennyparker0523 @KamalaHarris @AlasscanIsBack @GOP Bet you can't specifically show me what he did to constitute perjury.
@MaryFossier @KamalaHarris @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Demand @KamalaHarris release all her documents and emails she ever came across during her time as a senator when she "runs" for POTUS. #WhatAreTheyHiding
@feltrrr2 @KamalaHarris Not sure you know what POTUS stands for.
@HuffPost Another person utilizing capitalism and trump hate to make money or liberals. I say good on em! Book is shit and won't contain anything important. But ya, make that money.
@iiNovaTV @RoKhanna I support a small government and no regulations.
@ChandlerPolice @afspnational Also don't follow US Politics. It's a gateway to #depression and #suicide the way the media politicians push #fear and #hate to motivate you to voting for them. Just #walkaway from politics if you ever feel emotional about a specific issue. Not worth it.
@thehill Just in: former Democratic Presidents attend funeral with left wing #racebaiters and tax defrauders.
@mertzmobile @thehill Pretty sure it's banned already. Along with shooting EVERY race. #racebaiting
@iiNovaTV @RoKhanna My internet was fine and will always be fine because nothing has changed and won't change. Does that make it clearer for you?
@BernieSanders The baby is not THEIR body. The baby is it's own body. Why doesn't the man get a say also? It's technically half his.
@KamalaHarris Wow. A post that doesn't contain #fear or #hate. Nice job!
@OteghaUwagba YOU HAVE HAD EQUALITY FOR DECADES!
@RepDerekKilmer @WAStateFair Not being able to finish maybe used as a future attack ad.
@politico After his fake Spartacus moment he is no longer a prospective candidate. Bye.
@iiNovaTV @RoKhanna Like I've said. I've never had any problems with my internet prior to NN. No clue why or how you can tell me that's false.		You either are a victim of #fear or you ignore it and live a happy life. Your choice.
@ExpertThinker @TIME He was a successful person for sure. You really don't get to be a Senator and POTUS if you're not.		The president part is debatable.
@HuffPost He was escorted out for breaking the rules. If he didn't like the rules, don't go there.
@thehill MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE #journalism
@iiNovaTV @RoKhanna My internet was fine before NN too.		NN only effects big tech giants and they get you to believe they are after the little man. That's all this is.		People being manipulated by #fear and #hate to parrot someone else point of view for their gain. Politics.
@RoKhanna My internet is just fine post NN repeal. For a party that's for the people, you sure are arguing a lot for big cooperation here since they are the ones that pay the price with this. Not the lonely consumer.
@zombie_esq @monicajww @RoKhanna I understand the difference. But at the end of the day they are both contracts that require you to pay until they are paid off.		I don't think wiping out college debt would ever happen. All I am saying is it would be unfair to do that and not give something to the people without.
@zombie_esq @monicajww @RoKhanna They both a contracts that we agree to pay. That's the only equivalency I was aiming for.
@bigreypony @RoKhanna Should have taken math first then. While I agree this is outrageous, people should pay for the debts they signed up for.
@monicajww @RoKhanna So since I decided not to pay for a degree I shouldn't get a handout? Pay off my mortgage then. Make it fair.
@cphore @Wayne11854821 @realDonaldTrump #CyberBully
@EmilyKinder11 @pgmckim @agent_orangutan @TheCrazySaguaro @SethAbramson If he did and you have proof I'd report that to the FBI. If you don't, I'd just stop spreading crap.
@washingtonpost Sounds like what happens to Trump when he stands up for himself.
@snackpack210 @realDailyWire @benshapiro @CHSommers Think that's why my marriage works. We are opposites and compliment each other very well. It's certainly true for some couples. 		Other relationships won't work like that and need to be with like minded people. So I guess it just depends on the person.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro @CHSommers Wish more people could just understand this fact.		As a software developer, I work with most all men.	Wife does child care and works with ALL women.		Our wage gap is huge. But these are the things we enjoy doing. I couldn't do my wife's job and she couldn't do mine.
@laurabfreeman @JoyceWhiteVance Don't get me wrong. He doesn't act presidential and he does lie and cheat on his wife. But those aren't things that I really care about. I'm more of an action person.		The POTUS could be the biggest POS ever to me. But as long as policy and action aren't bad then no big deal.
@laurabfreeman @JoyceWhiteVance I am and do the same.		I haven't seen any proof of Trumps lack of character &amp; moral compass though. I've seen TONS of articles that say he does. But I take those as political smear campaigns and you can't take those for face value. I just look at his actions.
@builderjames79 @senorrinhatch Think @KamalaHarris anf @CoryBooker would give all their documents and emails they came into contact while in the Senate when they run for POTUS? #WhatAreTheyHiding?
@ShellyE167452 @SenGillibrand Your talking about every politician here. Which is fine with me, get rid of em all.
@SenGillibrand Senators are the only ones who vote here. Why do you keep posting this like we are able to do something. This is your job. You vote.
@MzSailiante @miasria @KamalaHarris No he didn't. Why lie?
@KamalaHarris Release all your emails @KamalaHarris. #WhatAreTheyHiding
@theHiRiseLA @RepLloydDoggett @NancyPelosi If you think one side is manipulating people but the other isn't, then you have been manipulated.
@jstraw75 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Yes. I don't trust any politician or media.
@SenSanders @JimCarrey He's also right about a Government not caring about you. That's YOU TOO @BernieSanders. He is also talking about YOU. YOU don't care either.
@BlueJayResist @realDonaldTrump 2 presidents taking credit for a natural recover from recession. Neither had nothing to do with it and we would recover despite who was POTUS at the time. Don't believe either one of them.
@thehill Exactly. It shouldn't be allowed. Some type of repercussion needs to be in place for #grandstanding.
@jstraw75 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis No, Trump is a liar. But that has nothing to do with what I said. The person who wrote this could be you for all we know. Or a Russian. Or anyone. Let's find out who's lying to us.
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis The administration needs to make this a possible Russian interference with our election issue so they can investigate the crap out of it. I want to know who wrote this.
@RoKhanna Show me a video where a democrat SCOTUS nominee answered this question and I will agree with you.
@shannonrwatts That's the mans sperm and the mans baby also. Just because a man puts a baby inside of you doesn't mean it's only the woman's.
@RepLowenthal Here is what I hear. 		The laws I am responsible for suck. They are so bad. It's not my problem people. Really! I am going to blame someone else.		FALSE!		You are elected as a lawmaker. Make laws, not Tweets.
@smirnoff_sprite @thehill If the articles linked to a missing persons report than I would be more willing to agree. One year is most definitely long enough, if those reports were filed and such.		This is the DNC looking for him. I haven't seen anything about local police or anything.
@ianbremmer Think the US could use a little of this literally starving method.		You may think that's cruel but I guarantee less people would die if we did this. Ironic, eh?
@ABC Make dynamite illegal!		Then all the dynamite will be brought to sanctuary cities where it will be embraced and safe. Democrats will try to protect them.
@lifesafeast @davidfrum Got proof of this claim? When you lie like this you are no better than Trump, the person I am assuming you hate, for lying.
@smirnoff_sprite @thehill After due diligence, yes. In this case, it was reported IMMEDIATELY for no other purpose but ad revenue which goes against journalism code of ethics. Obviously the last second is my opinion, but pretty sure I'm spot on.
@ScottosAGenius @thehill I can completely agree with that.		Only thing I'd add is Obama had the power to have the media stop doing that crap. Trump doesn't because, you know, anything he says about the media is an attack on them and free speech. But Obama could have said, knock that shit off.
@smirnoff_sprite @thehill That's exactly why you don't report these stories until you confirm. Journalism code of ethics.
@politicalirony1 @jaketapper Lack of proof? Standards? Code of ethics?
@jaketapper Two years ago today, Obama was president and did nothing to stop it.
@ScottosAGenius @thehill I don't really think Obama or Trump is setting us back. Think it's mainly the media and social media. But ya, could be a big combination of them all.		The media should start by not using race or color of skin in any news report ever again. That will be a good start.
@thehill MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE #journalism
When @KamalaHarris or @CoryBooker run for POTUS in 2020 we must all demand they release every email and document they had the privilege of sending/receiving/viewing during their time in the Senate. I think it's only fair.		#Kavenaugh #KavanaughHearings #WhatAreTheyHiding
@KatherineKaldis @kylegriffin1 @SenatorCollins When @CoryBooker runs for POTUS you will be demanding his entire documents and email records while he served in the Senate, right?
@Oyving1959 @CNNPolitics Or just say it's was possible Russian influence. Then you can investigate the hell out of it and actually find out what happened.
@thehill To once again prove. This was not about the message. It was about MONEY!		Nike made money. Kaepernick made money.		I'd urge all money that was made with the campaign from both parties to be all donated to the actual cause. Not just to make them rich.
@thehill Think this should be considered possible Russian influence and then they can investigate the hell out of it.
@kort_rob @ABC Racism against ALL races still exist and will probably always exist. ALL RACES. 		I don't buy into the #racebaiting and the more people that do, the more backwards we go.		Maybe you can see passed skin color one day. That's our only way forward.
@kort_rob @ABC The message still stands and applies to today. Need to get over referencing people by skin color.
@laurabfreeman @JoyceWhiteVance I'd stop following politics if you are crying all day from this. You are being emotionally manipulated by the media and politicians so you vote how they want you to. They are using fear and hate against you because those emotions motivate people the most. Life can be better.
@PatGregg2 @svbellaluna @bribriisme @KHShan @JoyceWhiteVance All are entertainment networks. They just aren't honest enough to admit that. If you think they are any different than fox with just feeding propaganda then they already have you. You are just the same as a fox only viewer. Manipulated and being used to push their messages.
@kort_rob @ABC False. I believe in "will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."
@ABC Stop honoring people by the color of their skin.
@RoKhanna Anyone thay spreads this lie should not be in congress.
@KamalaHarris Can you show many any Democrat nominees that have answered this?
@noonebutJenny Or there is no song to sing...
@thehill Good job media. You have people believing your BS enough to do some insane stuff like this. You're to blame.
@EAmos78 @CNNPolitics Good one. Due diligence. They were trying to out #grandstand each other. Kind of like a dance off. A grandstand off. Neither won.
@Edgutk @MaddowBlog Have you met him before? Have you ever talked to him?		Do you know the only reason why you don't like him and don't want him? You were told to think that way. Please let that sink in. You #hate someone you never met in your life because someone told you to.
@shannonrwatts @NRA I'm tired of politicians who offer #fear and #hate in exchange for future votes. All they do is contribute to #depression and #suicide.
@thehill I'll wear Chick Fil A biscuits on my feet.
@porto1958 @ValerieJarrett @BarackObama Oh please no. All she does is push #fear and #hate to motivate people to vote for her instead of the big bad mean man. Anyone that manipulates people using fear is completely disgusting and should not hold office. Which is every politician really.
@ValerieJarrett @BarackObama That's sexist.
@thehill This guy is a complete political hack and needs to go. If you think he's awesome or brave, you have been played by him. He just wants your vote.
@jeffswarens @SenKamalaHarris You can't point to factual evidence when you are #fearmongering. That would defeat the purpose of filling people with #fear and #hate so they vote for you and not the evil other guy in the next election.
@HuffPost Well ya. She murdered someone.
@KamalaHarris Petition? Do you need a civics lesson? What kind of #grandstanding BS is this? A petition is nothing! That's not how any of this works.
@RepJayapal @nwlc #grandstanding
@JaneDupree1 @kfhall0852 @ChuckGrassley @SenWhitehouse Integrity is objective, especially at this hearing.
@monla77 @washingtonpost Good job on the campaign speeches. As for the hearing, they didn't even offer anything of substance.
@washingtonpost Disingenuous Rules = Senate Rules? WTF?
@davecdnb @CoryBooker I just find his grandstanding that he's been doing over the last year or so pretty disgusting. I have no clue what he did in the past, I'm assuming he did a lot of good things when he just started off as most politicians do. But he is not going in the right direction now.
@ExpatLiberty @Joersweeney @KruseKimberly @fajdkmgott @KamalaHarris How can you possibly vote for anyone without seeing their entire email record for their entire life? Do you know what a POTUS can do in 4 years of time? A lot more damage than a SCOTUS Justice.		A Congressman can be there for LIFE! You don't care about their emails and records?
@Chadmmmk @PattyMurray White Power? We got a #nazi #WhiteSupremacist over here! OMG.
@DumpTrump456 @thehill Only thing he's exposed is how good of a guy he is so far.
@ExpatLiberty @Joersweeney @KruseKimberly @fajdkmgott @KamalaHarris They ALL have had ALL their public rulings available. That is what matters.		Did you see ALL your Senators, Congressmans, or POTUS complete email record prior to voting for them? No, that's dumb.
@davecdnb @CoryBooker Bold? He had permission to release them. But he's already got your vote for 2020, right? Doesn't need to grandstand anymore for you.
@awelab1956 @SenKamalaHarris You sound like a CNN run on headline.
@Chadmmmk @PattyMurray You enjoy eating up her delicious #fearmongering, eh? Taste yummy?
@PattyMurray Holy Moly. Give it a day or 2 without pushing #fear and #hate. It's old.
@thehill What strategy? Most Democrat Senators are just beefing up their 2020 POTUS campaign run. That's it.
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump So you are claiming the op-ed was fake, right? Can't do a witch hunt if it's real.
@LarryHenderso17 @thehill Yup. Remove him from the Senate. Do what's right. Agree.
@bjseltz @thehill Blatant rule breaking for political purposes is awesome, eh? The email he released was a complete joke too. Hope is is removed, runs for POTUS, and loses.
@thehill Former Senator @CoryBooker sounds good to me.
@SenKamalaHarris The only thing you would not find cruel and humane is transporting them all into California so you have more voters. That's all you care about. Votes.
@SenBooker I'm not sure. Rules? Laws? You should know that Former Senator Booker.
@BaileyPittipat @thehill That's just dumb.
@thehill That's false. Kind of.		The reason it appears to be is numbers of main stream media outlets. That's it. Just because fox is the only MAIN STREAM outlet it appears only left news is on Google.		Make more main stream conservative outlets if you want your voice to be heard.
@NydiaVelazquez @RepCummings @OversightDems The federal government literally sent more help than they could handle. What were they supposed to do differently? Get large fans and push the hurricane back?
@brianschatz One. Democrat. Senator. Could. Vote. Country. Over. Party.
@SilverQueen7 @NBCNews Enforcement of law is evil. Interesting.
@NBCNews Illegal immigrant. Your headline is wrong. Again.
@RepJayapal @RepRaskin Daily dose of #fear and #hate to keep your voters in line I see.
@AngAlex2432 @cspan @SenBlumenthal No Supreme Court judge nominee would/did answer these same types of questions. NONE.
@peoplefor @SenMarkey #fearmongering.
@RepScottPeters They failed to offer a solution that Democrats agree to. There's a difference. Both sides are to blame for not compromising.
@cspan @SenBlumenthal Innocent until proven guilty. It's still a thing.
@SenFeinstein #fearmongering.
@HeatherTobie @CoryBooker @LrShrimp He isn't doing anything.		If he cared so much about the fear of a judge being able to interpret LAWS differently maybe he should focus on passing legislation that is CLEAR and can't be interpreted wrong. But he doesn't care.		VOTE FOR HIM 2020! That's his only message.
@JamesChristy06 @marcorubio If it's so easy to do, why haven't the abortion people or anti gun people bought them yet? It's not like 2k for a Congressman is a lot of money. For a measly 100k you can easily buy enough to sway a vote.		Oh ya. It's a dumb argument and you can't buy politicians.
@CNNPolitics If the election was held in November 2016 then polls said he would have lost too.
@WayneWi20770958 @realDonaldTrump I've heard this story before. Just show me the tapes and stop telling me about it.
@deejay90192 @realDonaldTrump Omarosa and fury fury guy are credible too? No. But people love to anything anti Trump. Eat it up like sheep. Anything fur their confirmation bias.
@tirghrathoir @realDonaldTrump Confirmation bias is tough to overcome, eh?
@RepSwalwell Mattis said this never happened. Why are you spreading fake news?
@cindralaluna @PattyMurray Thanks for #fearmongering.
@uncle_t0by @RepKevinBrady I'm not. Guess that means I'm a Russian or a bot then, right?
@RepKevinBrady Wasn't written behind closed doors. But they didn't add anything Republicans wanted in it. Besides minor grammar edits and such. Nothing of substance.
@TIME That's why the words racist, white supremacist, fascist, bigot, Nazi, etc no long carry any meaning. You misused the terms so much all of these are just general insults.
@realDailyWire Anyone going to defend him? Anyone?
@ABC Seems like we already did this story a few years back.
@realDailyWire Damn Jewish/Mexican white supremacist.		This is the exact reason why the words racists, white supremacist, bigot, Nazi, fascist, etc have lost ALL meaning. It's just another f*** word now that is just a universal insult.
@TypingLiterally I'm saying he's on edge due to all the protesters, yelling, hateful and fear mongering rhetoric. I know with all these crazy people being told if he is confirmed then the world is over that I would be a little on edge with someone coming up to me like that as I was leaving.
@TypingLiterally @RyanHillMI @DisabledResist @davidhogg111 I don't know why the handshake wasn't immediately done. When someone goes to shake my hand, even if I don't know them, I don't make them wait.		But I highly doubt Kavenaugh meant any disrespect by this. He's nervous, not knowing what's going on, protesters, etc. Just on edge.
@TypingLiterally @RyanHillMI @DisabledResist @davidhogg111 Really? I see security escorting him away. Very noticeable in the first angle.
@anita1956 @DonnaSeay3 @davidhogg111 Being used as a political tool.
@SkizzoneR @SenFeinstein I post memes on Twitter because I'm a #CyberBully.
@SenFeinstein Americans deserve less #fearmongering.
@RepTimRyan Americans deserve less #fearmongering.
@LacyClayMO1 @VoteYesOnPropB Bet they have a car, car insurance, a phone with data, computer with internet, a TV, cable service, etc.		Maybe if they lived like responsible adults in the 40s and 50s and not just been a consumer of THINGS and GADGETS they would have more money for the essentials.
@fred_armani @NBCNews @kwelkernbc @washingtonpost Go read the list yourself and make your own determination. Most of them are counted as lies but they are opinions or quotes taken out of context.
@TheBaldTrump @NBCNews @kwelkernbc You are playing, let's #CyberBully people on Twitter.
@billnoesges @NBCNews @kwelkernbc I hope you're not a #CyberBully your whole life.
@fred_armani @NBCNews @kwelkernbc Reminder. The source that claims all these lies is fake news. They take opinions or anything else to raise these numbers.		Yes he has lied. But not nearly as many times as these so called articles claim. Not even close.
@rmayemsinger Word, I hope America can be free from #fearmongering one day.
@realDailyWire Who wakes up and decides that this is what I want to do with my life today. It has ZERO impact and only just shows how much you have been manipulated my media/politicians. Really doesn't make you look smart or even like you have a thought of your own. 100% Sheep.
@DustinGiebel Alleged quotes based off anonymous sources (majority of them). Should be a little honest.
@KamalaHarris If your laws are weak and open to interpretation don't blame the judges or give them the power to interpret. Do your job correctly and you wouldn't have anything to worry about! Call 1-900-MIX-ALOT and kick that nasty fearmongering.
@SenatorTester Any "tough" question will not be answered. You know this. They won't answer any question based on how they could rule in the future.		What is an example of a "tough" question for you?
@TheClaudeTaylor @rolandsmartin @LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @SenateMajLdr @GOP Then they won. They now get your vote in the next election. That's all they want. Use fear and hate to get you to the voting booth. They don't care about you or this process. Just votes for power.		Don't let politics (which is all lies, fear, and hate) effect you.
@RepDwightEvans That just reflects how nasty the left is. That is. Politicians and Media sway public voices.		If only 38% of people think he is a good nominee then that means the left went way too far with their hateful fearmongering rhetoric. It's not a compliment to see these numbers.
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cause physical harm.
@RepAdams @SenMajLdr It wasn't obstructed. It's how the Senate works. If the Senate majority leader knows a bill/confirmation won't have enough votes based on information from the Whip then it's not worth Senates time to take it to the floor because it won't pass. Was WRONG. But its not obstruction.
@thehill Another book. More people get trolled and make the author rich. 		It's like feeding the homeless. The more you do this, the more crap books will be published that offer some BOMBSHELL, but never do.
@RepDianaDeGette @HerreraBeutler Government should get out of the business of healthcare.
@JosephLindberg Luckily they have a staff and interns. Senators never read or write anything themselves anyway.
@SenateGOP @senorrinhatch Every nominee has been great. Both sides. If not, they would not have been nominated.		It's sad both sides play the politics game and the only victim is the nominee and the citizens. They politicians are just doing this to win your votes people. Stop listening to them.
@RoKhanna There's no way they could have release the other millions and you read the other millions before Trumps first term was up either. Stop playing games and do your job.
@SenFeinstein I remember what Twitter was like before #fearmongering. It was peaceful before politicians started using it.
@lyndisue @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenBooker So what do you think of the Senators that made up their mind BEFORE he was even selected? I bet you called every single one of them, eh?
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico Glad you are on board. Now it's time to practice. Good luck and if you need any help or inspiration let me know.
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico If #cyberbulling makes you feel better, have it. Go ahead and make me the target also since I can handle it emotionally. It's better you do it to me than someone suffering from #depression and possible #suicide.		Or just rethink the way you talk to people online.
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico #cyberbbully
@SwampDrainNow @jacklgoldsmith Pence is a Russian conspiracy now too?
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico Live your life in fear and hate if you wish. I'm just saying there's a better way. Politicians lie for your vote. That's true in both sides and since the beginning of politics.		You either believe them or don't. But none of their doomsday rhetoric ever comes true. EVER.
@divinemomo @politico I just don't believe everything I read. You will be fine. Your vagina will be fine. Your friends of color will be fine.		This is how politicians should talk to you. But instead they tell you someone is going to take away your vagina and delete all your friends of color. #fear
@LeaFett @divinemomo @politico Then you fell victim to political rhetoric and media manipulation if you believe that.		If you never followed politics before the side not in power ALWAYS thinks we are. Guess what? It never happens.
@LastActDefiance @thehill @SenJohnMcCain The divide is ALSO with people that spend their time blaming the presidency of hate and discrimination.		That's how a divide works. You have 2 sides that are wacko that have opposite opinions that constantly attack each other.
@divinemomo @politico I hate where the media and politicians are going.		I think the country and majority of the people are doing just fine.
@politico You need a poll for that?
@GunmamaQ000 @princessbunny67 @washingtonpost Exactly. Also they count the same thing dozens of times. Anytime it's mentioned they add it again. Literally the reason why fake news movement is spreading.
@Stan_Wagner19 @NBCNews Proof?
@humourhelp @NBCNews All of his rulings are public. Senators get the opportunity to sit and talk with him before hand. If that's not enough senators get to ask him questions under oath. That's all that you need and is required.		This document BS is just political rhetoric. Just like Hillarys emails.
@stevemacwv @thehill @realDonaldTrump That means to me they actually don't need it. Good for them.
@thehill If they don't NEED WIC then stop using the program. If you truly do need the help, then use it.
@LastActDefiance @thehill @SenJohnMcCain I'm not disputing that. All I said he chose to use his death to divide the country even further instead of attempting to unite.
@princessbunny67 @washingtonpost Most of the numbers arent fact based lies. Meaning they are counting "lies" that are opinions. This is the definition of fake news.		While the POTUS does lie, it's not this much. Washington Post lies to with this article. They are all liars.
@LastActDefiance @thehill He also chose to divide America instead of uniting. That's how I will always remember him now.
@thehill #FakeNews
@realDailyWire Black people are victims and can't be a bigot or racist. Don't your read the news?
@Sweetling @brianschatz Or just ask the questions to him that you have while he's under oath. You know, like how the process is meant to be done.
@AlmightyAndy @brianschatz @djrothkopf Highly doubt it.
@brianschatz I hope nothing bad happens with this hearing thanks to you dangerous and unnecessary political rhetoric.
@BeckyGiangreco @BrianKarem @Rob_Sleasman You literally post fake news in a discussion about fake news. If you think one side is good and the other is bad then you have been manipulated by political rhetoric and media manipulation.
@BeckyGiangreco @BrianKarem @Rob_Sleasman Did you not see the part about FAKE NEWS and not FREE PRESS.		I think FAKE NEWS is the enemy also. It's deceiving and disgusting.
@RoKhanna Get the government out of health care then.
@Cormaic_Ruadh @SLIPUSA @CNNPolitics Got it. I have no clue who he is but didn't see anything close to racism in that one tweet. Don't live there so won't visit his account either. :)
@Cormaic_Ruadh @SLIPUSA @CNNPolitics How was he showing any form of racism?
@CNNPolitics I call #racebaiting deeply disturbing.
@senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I find it interesting they care more for these documents than they did about Hillarys deleted (possibly highly classified) emails.
@MssuzanneYoung @thehill What would have to be in his tax returns to show hes not qualified to be president?
@marcabella11 @thehill If he was guilty he wouldnt be able to block it. So if he's able to block then obviously there was no wrong doing. Could just want to block it to finally be done with this crap and not just make more of a conspiracy by releasing the report and have people obsessed with it.
@LadyJYYC @PhilipRucker @NanceDee Proof?
@about_scout @PhilipRucker Where's my wing man? Holder?
@PhilipRucker Or he's suggesting they don't publicly announce investigations that could effect elections like they did to Hillary.
@CNNPolitics Lots of questions that he won't answer because none of them do. Then he gets confirmed. Outrage from the left for a week. Everything dies down, nothing changes, back to "normal".
@MrsDanaD @brianschatz The  DOJ is supposed to take in account politics before publicly announcing investigations that could impact results. Like how they screwed over Hillary.		Not saying they should not have done this. But trump isn't guilty of anything. That's just silly talk.
@ananavarro Well one of those people died with his last wish to further the divide of the nation so I believe Americans are just following his lead.
@CNN Anyone want to show me where Fox shamed him? All I found was this article which is not shamming at all.		https://t.co/KwnZBwrE10
@thehill The media, duh.
@realDailyWire With money, duh.
@brianschatz Corruptly or by threats of force. Now you need to prove that part.
@BeckyGiangreco @BrianKarem @Rob_Sleasman Are you trying to prove my point. He said FAKE NEWS. This doesn't mean every article, every story, from every outlet.
@CNNPolitics Isn't the Liberal stance is anyone that is under FBI Investigation should be able to run for office? Or is that Trump only?
@supermod_l @sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Most certainly is the definition of a cyber bully.
@libertythePD @BrianKarem I wonder if people actually believe this. I figure it's just an insult and there's no possibility that they actually believe this nonsense. But who knows.
@BrianKarem @Rob_Sleasman None of them have. He has repeatedly said FAKE NEWS is the enemy of the people. When you constantly misquote him as saying FREE PRESS, guess what, you are now reporting fake news.
@RepJayapal Yes we would. People just wouldn't work there.
@fleetssara @cmclymer @HillaryClinton That's good. We are on the same page now.
@sheilafaye01_g @supermod_l @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Again. Another #cyberbullying attack. If this truly does make you feel better I am open to being recipient of your hate/bullying since I know I can handle it emotionally. Some others that suffer from #depression may not and I don't want them to be your target.
@keatonc33 Disagree, but understand what you are saying now.
@keatonc33 If by that you mean nothing will happen, everyone will move on and forgotten about one day, then I agree.
@fleetssara @cmclymer @HillaryClinton You apparently believe if Kavenaugh is confirmed he will dismantle "stuff". That means you were victim to political and media rhetoric they preyed on your fear and hate.		So yes. You were emotional about it. It's not fact based. It's emotion. Mostly fear of the unknown.
@fleetssara @cmclymer @HillaryClinton If I believed every (INSERT NAME HERE) will destroy everything then my life would be miserable. Stop falling for the fear and hate mongering. Nothing will change as usual.		Stop following politics if you get emotional over it. It's not worth it. Nothing will change if you stop.
@FudgeTosser @CNNPolitics You think a party will have 2/3rds majority in the Senate?		Impeachment may get through Congress but won't have a chance in the Senate. Just like Clinton. Waste of time. Dumb message.
@RepPaulTonko You believe in no income inequality? Everyone should get the same pay no matter the job, skills, or schooling required?		What an odd policy stance.
@sheilafaye01_g @supermod_l @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Calling another American a Russian because political views differs qualifies you as being a #cyberbully. Hope your online bullying makes you feel better.
@fleetssara @cmclymer @HillaryClinton This holiday is not about fearmongering and attempting to change peoples minds on political issues. It's a holiday.
@sheilafaye01_g @supermod_l @cmclymer @HillaryClinton He is pro constitution and law. That is his job and responsibility. This is not a political race with sides.		Law has one side.
@sheilafaye01_g @supermod_l @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Yes. That's called #fearmongering. A political tactic to make you fear an outcome so you will vote/think the way the person wants you to.		It's unacceptable.
@supermod_l @sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton No one is trying to take away any workers rights! That's my point. She is just using fear and hate to motivate. Must have worked on you.
@supermod_l @sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Labor Day has nothing to do with her political message. She just sent a message of fear and hate. That is not the intent of Labor Day.
@sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Of course you wouldn't.
@sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Right back at you. If you think this is how it's supposed to work and how it worked for 100+ years you are gravely wrong.
@sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Think this sums up how I feel about this process.		https://t.co/81nAO8ZNi1
@sheilafaye01_g @cmclymer @HillaryClinton Pathetic that you don't know SCOTUS wasn't politicized until recent times.		Used to be no big deal. No one talked about it. Presidents would even nominate judges from the other party.		It's not until recent times the media and politicians are politicizing it. It's disgusting!
@roxburytowngyrl @TrefaultPaulina @SenKamalaHarris Wasn't hiding. My very first reply to her should have clearly revealed this.		I don't like politicians that manipulate people. I don't like media that manipulate people.
@roxburytowngyrl @TrefaultPaulina @SenKamalaHarris That is correct. She politicizes 99% of her posts with fear and hate and anytime I can take a swipe at her I will. I'm not saying I am a better person.
@TrefaultPaulina @roxburytowngyrl @SenKamalaHarris According to my accepted definition. The same one the media and politicians use.
@TrefaultPaulina @roxburytowngyrl @SenKamalaHarris So? It specifically says there is not a broadly accepted definition. What are you trying to prove?
@HillestadCara @cmclymer @HillaryClinton #cyberbully
@RepCummings You're welcome.
@cmclymer @HillaryClinton Disgusting she would use Labor Day to politicize the Supreme Court, and you praise her for that?		#Kavenaugh missing documents are just like her emails. Bet you didn't care as much about those. Really pathetic to politicize a Holiday for a fake agenda.
@thehill PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY PROBABLY #journalism
@FoxNews Maybe @GordonRamsay could help too? Let's get some new episodes of Kitchen Nightmares going.
@RepLipinski You're welcome.
@FoxNews Should shut the place down and rename the city. That could help.
@roxburytowngyrl @SenKamalaHarris I said it wasn't a mass shooting.	You said I called it a mass shooting.		You may have read it, but you didn't comprehend it.
@PhilMQuinn @SenKamalaHarris These shootings happen ALL THE TIME and this is the first time she tweeted about just general shootings. So my tweet was in surprise she took the time to tweet this one since there's no way to politicize it. It's a backhanded compliment for doing something pure for once.
@thehill This will stop all the gang members with guns from flying into their city and shooting people? What the hell does the airport have to do with it?		March down to the hood and protest there.
@roxburytowngyrl @SenKamalaHarris I don't think you read my tweet properly.
@PhilMQuinn @SenKamalaHarris Not by one person, bruh. People were shooting each other.
@pick2frac2 @rayvon63 @SueCandy1 @foxandfriends @dbongino @realDonaldTrump Agree that was inappropriate, wasn't a Trump rally though. 		Just like what she did was. Pretty sure 2 people can be inappropriate from both sides at the same time.
@SenKamalaHarris It wasn't a mass shooting, why are you tweeting about this? How are you going to politicize it?
@TuckFrump28 @RepSwalwell This is pure propaganda. You should watch a documentary on how people make documenties to undermine democracy. Pretty funny you promote watching out for the same tactics you just fell for. #confirmationbias
While reading all the comments about #Kavanaugh documents not being released and #WhatAreTheyHiding, think of Hillarys emails and the rhetoric almost matches, just from the opposite side this time. Both sides are the same.
@RandoVon @BCFeher @FoxNews Hateful isn't an insult? You lost me.
@KamalaHarris How could we you are a broken record and can't go 5 minutes without saying it. Too bad your action doesn't equal your tweets. You are elected to FIX problems, not to constantly tell your constituents about them. Do something. Get off Twitter and go fix it. Or just stop tweeting.
@ccdawson52 @sjcloobeck #CyberBully.
@johnkruzel Only the fake news reports trump said the press is the enemy of the people. He consistently says the fake news is the enemy of the people. By you misquoting him, you are now fake news. Which means you are the enemy of the people.		Confusing, eh? Just be honest then.
@thehill Divide wins.
@RandoVon @BCFeher @FoxNews I recommend you look up the word fascist because you are not using it properly. Also why you are there check out #cyberbully. If you don't want to be labeled as such then I would change your ways.
@LacyClayMO1 I won't stand for #racebaiting.
@RandoVon @BCFeher @FoxNews No. It divided.
@davidhogg111 Do you know why you can't do this?		Politicians aren't bought and controlled by the NRA! That's the most idiotic argument you can possibly push. It would cost pennies to ban all guns if you really think politicians will just take a little more money and do your bidding. Grow Up.
@davidhogg111 Most Congressman receive NO money from the NRA. Also there are a ton that only get 2k from the NRA.		If you think it's truly about the money then you can easily buy enough Republican Congressman and Senators for around 100k to push whatever law you want. Do a gofundme.
@StuartPadiso @debsavage26 @thehill Comments don't equal votes. Votes are what matters.
@Frenchie1904 @baroquerw @thehill So it's not about control for him. Interesting.
@dgailwong @TexDona @ShirlsAdams @JeffFlake @Nysteveo2AOLcom @WhiteHouse All his rulings are public record. He is being looked at for his rulings.
@RepJeffries You don't even get a vote. Why do you care? Stop politicizing the one institution that should be free from your filthy rhetoric.
@sandrabmckee @thehill Anyone politicizing the supreme court should be ashamed.
@CBSNews If that were true then Trump would have been invited. He chose to DIVIDE not unite.
@20XTS14 @thehill @realDonaldTrump Why do you care what I care if you want me to begone?
@20XTS14 @thehill @realDonaldTrump I already asked your stupid DEMANDING question. I don't support any politician or any media outlet.
@20XTS14 @thehill @realDonaldTrump Oh I thought we were just saying that back and forth to each other like an insult. This man didn't receive my vote either.		We were discussing The Hogg and you changed the subject to Trump for some odd reason. Thought it was because you liked him or something.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill Says Mr. Moral High Ground backed by Science.
@20XTS14 @thehill @realDonaldTrump You voted for @realDonaldTrump.
@20XTS14 @thehill Not if all he does is go around spreading hate and fear. Well that's what other politicians are doing so I guess it could work. Just won't get my vote.
@20XTS14 @thehill 1 for and 1 against. So far he's got a 50/50 shot.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill Got it. You believe teachers don't care in education and are there just for a paycheck.
@baroquerw @thehill Why didn't he just use this money to buy a Congressmans vote for gun control. Only costs like 2k.
@thehill This kid is going to get destroyed if he ever comes through with his threat to run for office. All hate.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill False. I gave my opinion than you replied to me telling me I'm wrong.		My opinion stands with the teachers, the unions, and the school boards that all see this as a horrible idea also.		The problem with kids and school isn't sleep, it's what they are putting into their body.
@CNN How am I less safe? Would really like an answer to that claim.
@1977Towerburn @CNN You wanted him just to show up?
@jacobwalters85 @thehill All you proved is your are a #cyberbully. The people that understand the issue all disagree.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill The science is teens do better with more sleep. The solution is they should go to bed earlier. Allowing them to come in later along with bad parenting the kids will just stay up later.		If you had a teen kid, we would not be having this discussion.
@thehill So brave.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill So I looked in the article and found "defying the wishes of school boards in the state as well as a local teachers' union". So pretty much everyone that knows best, they ignored. Real science.
@jacobwalters85 @thehill Scientific research tells me the later you tell a kid to be awake the later they sleep. You must not have any kids.		The problem is parenting and it won't be corrected by doing this.
@thehill I'm sure working parents will love that!		But you know what will happen. Kids will stay up even later now and get the same or less sleep. I don't see how a State can be this dense.
@AndrewGillum If you corrected the record on the obviously not racists remark then I would still wish you luck. But you didn't. You fell into the #racebaiting politics so I hope you do not win. We have enough people like you already.
@kelliapowers1 @RepSwalwell @MeghanMcCain @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you are a #cyberbully.
@RepSwalwell So you support Trump and the current administration. Nice.
@HuffPost How many times did Congress vote for Obama to release his birth certificate and college transcripts again?
@JoanC09892580 @mycricky @HuffPost Obama dozing off isnt more disrespectful?
@DharmaDoggle @HuffPost Or just dozed off like Obama during the boring parts.
@ahbonneu5667 @HuffPost At least she didn't doze off like Obama did.
@JoelUhler @HuffPost Hate and divide is the new cool thing, eh?
@HuffPost I bet HuffPost doesn't see themselves as #racebaiters. 		They are wrong.
@OccupyDemocrat1 @GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr YOU don't want to replace ICE. Some other Democrats don't want to replace ICE.		But I believe the majority that currently hold the most power and persuasion want to ABOLISH ICE. I follow their Twitter. They say exactly that, abolish ICE.
@thehill So? He wasn't invited. Was was he supposed to do?
@NBCNews Stop giving them attention.
@lalonde7_mike @tfd84 @thehill I attack the left media because they are the ones going ape shit now. The right media were the insane ones under Obama.		Read my comments too. I'm fairly equal.
@realDonaldTrump You just compared apples to oranges. Doesn't work.
@lalonde7_mike @tfd84 @thehill Are you saying no level headed person exists? People can't be neutral and have to pick a side? Why would you automatically push me towards the right and not the left?		So many questions...
@tfd84 @lalonde7_mike @thehill I don't care. I'm not a bot.		#cyberbullying against appearance of Meghan McCain, Michelle Obama, Sarah Huckabee, or anyone is wrong.		Calling a person a bot because they have different political beliefs is wrong too.
@NBCNews So, all 4 people at the concert got the refund, right?
@lalonde7_mike @tfd84 @thehill Replies to the bot says the #cyberbully.
@tfd84 @thehill Oh please. Don't spread Russian BS. Getting borderline pizzagate worthy.
@thehill I agree with some of that, but Congress should not just be thrown away like they are nothing. Even though they act worthless sometimes, I think they should be involved in this process. Not just 1 man.
@OccupyDemocrat1 @GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr I would have agreed with you early this year. But I do think most support abolishing ICE and open boarders now.		The other language used in this tweet is just fear mongering hate which I don't agree with.		But the policies I think that's what they want now.
@MadMomma3737 @thehill I agree. I feel if I were to sit down human to human with Trump he would just talk about himself and his accomplishments. I don't feel it would be a two way conversation.		I don't really hate him. Some of his policies are good. Just don't care for the man behind the policies.
@thehill Divide not Unite!		Getting tired of people working against the cause. If you don't have anything nice to say, just zip it.
@MadMomma3737 @thehill So all of them? :)		I would also. But if I had to just pick TWO. Then those are my two.
@thehill Can't wait for him to get confirmed just like Gorsuch so we can move on and never hear anymore fearmongering until the next one.
@MadMomma3737 @thehill Bush was the man. His policies weren't always that great but he acted the part when he needed to be and he acted human the rest of the time.		This Bush and Carter are the only two in recent years I would probably want to sit down, have a beer, and chat with.
@daveyesfan @thehill How much of your money?
@TheOfficialPORP @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews It's easy to criticize behind a keyboard with zero knowledge of how international trade deals work, eh?
@CNN @CNNOpinion Dear CNN,		The wolf ate the boy already because of you.
@thehill Why attempt to unite when we can just divide?
@realDailyWire Couldn't make sense of the headline until  I read the entire article.
@NBCNews To got to be kidding me!		Violence from soccer/football fans is undoubtedly immeasurably more than esports.
@DarkholderGuy @SenTinaSmith They never had to get to the point in smearing Merrick Garland because he was never going to get a vote. If he was going to get a vote the Republicans would have smeared him all over the place.		You do understand that right? No need to discredit someone who will never get a shot.
@jobsgoddess @SenMarkey No. Need to look that one up too. Bet there was quite of few sleepers in the crowd.
@DarkholderGuy @SenTinaSmith You sound just like people that didn't want to vote for Merrick Garland.
@SenMarkey Did you see Obama sleeping?
@DarkholderGuy @SenTinaSmith Don't fall for the #hate and #fear. Every single SCOTUS nominee is  nominated because they are fair and clean. ALL of them.
@thehill If the car was so shitty it could survive a tariff.
@careystrombotne @CreechJeff @kteemusic @SenatorDurbin The sane ones. The ones that would wait until the hearing was done and the answers were made. The ones that don't prejudge based on politics. The ones who don't put party politics over country. Shall I continue?
@FoxNews @BarackObama Oh he woke up. Can you imagine if Trump fell asleep 20 minutes into the ceremony?
@SenTinaSmith Stop politicizing the Supreme Court. You get a chance to go sit down with him, ask him questions. You get access to ALL his rulings which are public (those are what matters). You even get to ask him questions under oath!		What are you hiding?
@RyanLizza Well at least he didn't fall asleep like Obama 20 minutes in. Could you imagine the coverage if Trump did that?
@GhostJohnMcCain @IvankaRogue @thehill People were divided long before Trump and one person or side is not to blame.
@RoKhanna Great. First step is to identify the problem. Now what's your plan?
@IvankaRogue @thehill Yes. They had a choice to unite but chose divide. They are no better than Trump.
@thehill Disgusting. You had one chance to unite. You chose divide.
@hrh_orchid @AdamSerwer If you think I'm a racist. You apparently don't know the definition or what it is. Maybe ask your older family members who lived before the 60s.
@hrh_orchid @AdamSerwer You can call me a racists all you want, that doesn't change the truth. You laugh like you think racism is a joke. You must have zero clue what real racism looks like. Every time someone like you uses the word racists it's extremely insulting to people that experienced it for real
Let's hope that any speaker today for @SenJohnMcCain takes the opportunity to spend a message of unity and not divide. This is a massive opportunity and please don't waste it. You can do significant damage if you choose to divide. Don't spread the #hate.
@SenSchumer Oh please Chuck. Your politics are disgusting.		You are elected to FIX problems not push them back on the American people. Stop pushing back #fear and #hate and do what you were elected to do or get out so someone else can.		Tweeting problems is NOT your job.
@thehill The Hill uses social media to push Neo-Nazi message instead of just ignoring them.
@PattyMurray All you do list problems and offer no solutions. I think you have this backwards. The people of the state list the problems and you offer solutions.		You aren't acting like a Senator. You are acting like s citizen. Do your job or get out.
@RepGraceMeng Maybe you are being trolled? He says no just so you all will fight for it and then the workers will get it easily.		He should come out as a Democrat so you all swap to Republicans.
@hrh_orchid @AdamSerwer You seem very full of hate and a little racists. If you want to keep being referred to as a skin color, have at it. I'd rather just be a person.
@thehill This does nothing.
@MTLahmamsi @KamalaHarris That's a lot of rhetoric hash tags but you forgot one. You are a #CyberBully.
@hoosiemommy27 Wackos are attracted to both sides. They can't control that.
@MAFgeek @KamalaHarris @Marmas110189 Please do. It won't stop anything. But I think she should walk out. Keep walking.
@MTLahmamsi @KamalaHarris Just a list of a bunch of controversial topics. What you are doing has a definition. Called #fearmongering.
@RKJ65 @Melanchthon61 @KamalaHarris More than 1 person in the world can lie.
@katekaram @KamalaHarris Because she can't. The only thing she cares about is your votes.
@angela_rye Or people just love to divide America instead of unite. Yes, all of you.
@hoosiemommy27 I understand and have seen all these stories. I'm sure you are aware he dated a black woman for a while too, right? I'd think someone that supports and practices white supremacy that would be a huge no no.
@hoosiemommy27 How about how the people of color viewed him back then? Would this count?		https://t.co/cSParh8xIH
@allahpundit I don't see how being associated with these 3 men could be perceived a positive thing.
@jimsciutto You all and your silly polls. We all know every poll is created with the results already determined.
@BernieSanders Why did you not tour the facilities when given a chance? Don't care enough?
@cetalley @hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME @57 Are you OK?
@hoosiemommy27 He's spoken against it years and decades ago also.		A president would never intentionally praise a hate group publicly.
@ProudResister @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Will you defend @realDonaldTrump when the media, politicians, celebrities, social media, etc attack him relentlessly?		If not. Shame on you for allowing #CyberBullying.
@KamalaHarris Your only messages.		1. #hate	2. #fear	3. #antitrump	4. #russia	5. #voteforme	6. #StopKavanaugh 		When do you talk about policy and positive messages? Your feed leads to #depression.
@hostler1 @Firedupgrandma @NBCNews You seriously don't trust polls, do you?
@ShawnRouney999 @NBCNews #CyberBullying is cooooool!
@BernieSanders What's your plan to accomplish this? Just tweet about it?
@AdamSerwer Writers of color? How about we don't describe people by the color of their skin for once.
@realDailyWire Are we allowed to interact with the users? :)
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME He's on record dozens of times saying he does not support them and they are a bad organization.
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME Yes. For me he does.
@hoosiemommy27 @cetalley @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME I don't. Thanks why I don't support antifa.
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME I will agree with that statement. I just won't group every single person there with them.		Just like in won't group all counter protestors with antifa.		This is why I agree there were fine people on both sides and trump NEVER said he supports white supremacist.
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME You are calling an entire group of protesters white supremacist without proof. Take that how you want.
@hoosiemommy27 @cetalley @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME Antifa is a fascists hate group. What don't you get about that? But not everyone there on the counter protest believes in their values.
@hoosiemommy27 @cetalley @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME That's the group that organized the event. 		But the protest was to protest the removal of the statue. Do you think no one else came that wasn't part of that group? It's pretty hateful just to call anyone and everyone a white supremacist.
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME Did all the "normal" counter protesters leave when Antifa started fighting people?
@Andrew01775 @mumsie1994 @hoosiemommy27 @TIME Essentially. From your opinion.		There were more than 2 sides.		1. Statue protesters	2. Statue counter protesters	3. Antifa	4. White supremacist		It's like calling everyone on the left there fascists because Antifa was there causing problems. That's just wrong to group people.
@cetalley @mumsie1994 @hoosiemommy27 @Andrew01775 @TIME Show me where every single person there was a white supremacist! Just because you say it, doesn't make it true.		The purpose of the event was to protest the statue being removed. Their were people there for that reason. You are just calling the ALL white supremacists. Why?
@cetalley @Andrew01775 @TIME That's you just saying everyone there is a white supremacist. That means you are just a #cyberbully.		Was everyone there on the left Antifa? No, there were some shit heads on both sides. There were also people there for the actual main reason. Removing the statue.
@mumsie1994 @hoosiemommy27 @Andrew01775 @TIME Look #cyberbully. You still have the opportunity to show me where he said white supremacists are fine people. If you can't do it then just walk away.
@hoosiemommy27 @mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME I understand. But he never said White Supremacists are "fine people".		There were people there that actually were protesting the monument (you know the purpose). Then there were people there looking to start shit (on both sides). You are just calling EVERYONE a white supremacist.
@mumsie1994 @Andrew01775 @TIME He most certainly did not. You should easily be able to find a source that says that if it were obviously true.
@chrislhayes Maybe newspapers could shutdown? Does anyone even read these things anymore? What is paper by the way?		It's called supply and demand and the Tampa Bay Times politicizing the issue because they are anti-trump. That's it.
@Andrew01775 @TIME No he didn't. Why lie?
@thehill Every President gives themselves an A+. Only difference is Trump is the only one to say it out loud, to other people, for some reason.
@redsteeze Oh  ya, and sexual assault, rape, adultery, paying off women, and eating over his limit at a buffet.
@redsteeze If this was Trump they would be screaming for impeachment, treason, racism, bigotry, and collusion.
@thehill Fund me @DonaldJTrumpJr and I'll make it.
@educate4power @dabeard @Greeneindenver @knightcolumbia @Poynter @MotherJones @ConnieSchultz @Sulliview Looks like they were protecting a person of color who was naked from being recorded. Quit your #racebaiting.
@RobotShlomo @JDAvatar @ChrisMurphyCT I don't care if you believe it or not. I'm actually watching one while we talk to keep my skills progressing.
@RobotShlomo @JDAvatar @ChrisMurphyCT Capitalism is failing due to taxes, regulations, and too much Government. I agree. The answer isn't to add even MORE.
@RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT Look further in the past. Go way back.
@RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT Every major industrialized nation also doesn't have free speech. Should we take that away too, just because?		Health care was just dandy 100 years ago before the Government got involved. Like it or not, I do not care. I'm on single payer.
@JDAvatar @RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT No, I get it.		Minimum wage is NOT a living wage. These are the jobs that kids do for their first jobs. These are jobs that require a low wage in order for those industries to exist. They are low for a reason.		It is not meant for you to raise a family on.
@RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT Health care was fine before the Government got involved. Those are facts too.
@RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT I don't even know who you are talking about. Why are you assuming you know me?
@RobotShlomo @JDAvatar @ChrisMurphyCT I learned my skill  used for my job with YouTube. You don't need a degree. You just need effort.
@RobotShlomo @ChrisMurphyCT That is true. Don't really care if you agree.
@thehill Ohhhhhhhhhhh Nagger
@barrypsax @thehill #cyberbully
@WSJ @AbigailShrier Disgusting.
@RoKhanna This is a horrible idea. Who actually supports this?
@CNNPolitics That's because their parents didn't come with them.
@RepGwenMoore I'm an ordinary worker and go way more than a penny. Stop lying.
@danieldaviddunn @thehill #cyberbully
@RepKarenBass Please cite sources that all this will go away if confirmed. If not, then you are just #fearmongering.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why would you consider this fun?
@JoeBbrannon2001 @RepBonnie If you think one side is good and the other is bad, you have been manipulated by the media and politicians.
@gnrhippie @JeffFlake You are a #cyberbully.
@JoeBbrannon2001 @RepBonnie Then he would be in jail.
@JeffFlake Cya.
@RepScottPeters Republicans want to downsize the government so the the rest of the population can succeed. You have to understand that, right?
@RepBonnie Innocent until proven guilty. I'd assume someone in congress understands the foundation of our law system.
@greg1t @ChrisMurphyCT Should take away freedom of speech too, just like the rest of the first world.
@JDAvatar @ChrisMurphyCT Raise your skills.
@ChrisMurphyCT The answer is to get the government out of health care. They have been screwing it up for decades.
@PetraRoesner @JillWineBanks @munyelele That's insulting to your grandparents.
@JillWineBanks So you colluded with Russia right? Sure you have a lot of "ties" and that is all that's needed to be convicted of collusion.
@thehill Of course he considered it. How seriously he considered it is the real question.
@sunlover_FBPE @SenDuckworth These show a racial/cultural difference. 		Nothing to do with the care they receive being lopsided.
@sunlover_FBPE @SenDuckworth I haven't researched it at all. I just find it extremely difficult to believe nurses and doctors would give someone of a different race different quality of care and that's exactly what she suggested. I call it #racebaiting.
@sunlover_FBPE @SenDuckworth I've read nothing that black women receive "lesser care" than white women.		They may have more medical issues but that is a racial/cultural issue. You can't blame the hospital on this. Can't suggest healthcare professionals (who many are black) are treating them differently.
@sunlover_FBPE @SenDuckworth I understand this. What is not proven is why. Her tweet blamed the health care system for not taking care of black women the same as white women. That's #racebaiting because it's not proven.
@sunlover_FBPE @SenDuckworth She can't backup her statement with facts.
@jakebeck27 @SenDuckworth Nothing to do with race.
@SenDuckworth #racebaiting
@JamilSmith #racebaiting
@washingtonpost Good.
@AstralThespar @thehill OK. You believe in guessing facts, I don't. Moving on.
@AstralThespar @thehill You sew missing one important part.		The cops chose to let her go without pressing any charges.		She wants to fight it but district attorney said no.
@LockofStormrage @saziz01b @thehill Got it. Your comment could have been read on two completely different ways.
@PantanoJones @washingtonpost You say Trump. Some say Obama. It's not a contest. If you don't want divide then the first step would be to stop making comments like you just did.
@AstralThespar @thehill All part of the facts.
@AstralThespar @thehill District Attorney is not pressing charges against the officers. I will go with their understanding of the situation before yours. They apparently did not break the law. Why don't you understand that?
@AstralThespar @thehill Again. You don't know what they were recording. You can keep guessing all you want.
@AstralThespar @thehill There is something called HIPAA and that is what they mentioned. Without knowing exactly what they were attempting to record you can't say if this was lawful or not.
@TrumpblueMe @washingtonpost What's your point? I'm not here to make friends. Are you just pointing you that you are a #cyberbully?
@LockofStormrage @saziz01b @thehill I've guessing you read the statement and can point out the part he made a racists comment to his opponent? Or are you just here to #cyberbully?
@AstralThespar @thehill Positive there is more to the story than that. But since neither of us know then we can't determine if it was unlawful or not.		With the only information we can verify, she didn't follow police directions and was arrested.
@lager_dr @thehill Where's the Hills evidence that he has no evidence?
@AstralThespar @thehill Do you know exactly what she was attempting to record?
@thehill The hill claims without evidence that Trump claims without evidence that NBC altered his 2017 interview.
@realDailyWire This is a prime example of Fake News and what is the enemy of the people whenever someone from the left asks for an example again. Such disgusting behavior.
@thehill WATCH: A lady not following police direction and gets arrested.		Fixed your cop hating headline for you.
@washingtonpost Yes, even in death he continued to divide the country.		He had great opportunity to get everyone in the same room, everyone united, everyone emotional, something that could have brought on some unity. But decided to go the opposite route. Whatever, it's his choice.
@realDailyWire Smaller lines. Thanks.
@saziz01b @thehill Which way? Could you tell me exactly what racists comment he made? I'd recommend you go read the statement first before you look like a fool.
@RepRickLarsen #cyberbully
@TheLastWord I feel like I've read this headline once a month since the day he was elected. The boy is going to get eaten by the wolf because no one believes you anymore.
@ThomasA95646091 @ConcernedLefty @brianschatz Comments like yours add to it. Guess you don't care.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Anytime. I always like sharing ideas with people that don't get confrontational.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes There were winners and loser with ACA. Trump is swapping the winners/losers. With this healthcare system there will always be winners and losers. I'm on single payer so it really never will effect me. I think both options are wrong. Federal GOV should not be involved at all.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Ok, take for instance health care.		Who do you vote for if you want better health care? Half the people will vote Democrat and half will vote Republican. Who actually gives them better health care? Most likely neither. You can do this with every federal issues. It's a 50/50 split
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Those are the most politicized. I don't buy into the fear.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Oh don't get me wrong. I 100% agree in local politics. These are the ones that actual effect our lives but most people don't care/vote in.		Federal politics is what I am referring to.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Understand. Both sides use fear mongering tactics and tell you the world is going to end, right? They tell us people/world could/might/may suffer if you don't vote for me, or something else.		My point is with all the crying wolf you can only trust your own personal experiences.
@2017_itstime @thehill Vote local elections because those are the only ones that really effect your day to day life.
@thehill Unnecessary comment but she got what she deserved.
@JPreibus @TheDoseTweets @NBCNews @AndrewGillum Never seen that clip before. Pretty sad.
@SenWarren Um. You are part of the corruption too. All of you are.
@AP @UConn Should make them illegal! That will fix it.
@CNN You CANT violate a labor law with a tweet.		You can admit to violating a labor law with a tweet.
@BeyondSpectrum @thehill Gillums platform he ran on is anti-trump. It's not like he hasn't been attacking the president for months.
@TheDoseTweets @NBCNews @AndrewGillum What exactly did he say this is racist?
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Just curious. What's the last federal policy changed that had an effect on your day to day life?
@CNN @CillizzaCNN This is how CNN spends everyday. TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP RUSSIA.
@NBCNews This is why you are called #fakenews. If you ever cared.
@SenKamalaHarris Retweet if you are a human or love another human! Vote for me if you agree! Stupid politics.
@NBCNews The US government provided more help than they literally could handle.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes I can't think of one policy change I that directly effected my day to day life, ever.
@CNN Nice #fearmongering.
@NydiaVelazquez @CNN @ryanobles They literally had more assistance than they can handle. Why lie?
@thehill Got a source?
@FMHilton @thehill It's still not proof on why he is leaving.		If I were to guess, he was fired for squealing. But it's just a guess. I don't know.
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes If you are being emotionally effected by politics you are being manipulated and that's not good. Uninformed people when it comes to politics is the majority of US and they have one less thing to be depressed about.
@FMHilton @thehill I don't follow, but don't care enough. So I'll just nod and move along. 👍
@ConnorKJ94 @sonicbeef @nytimes Both. If you get emotional over news, stop watching/reading it.
@FMHilton @thehill Got a source?
@AeynaLali @thehill Your choice I guess #CyberBully.
@AeynaLali @thehill So all the high ranking FBI officials who have been fired for misconduct doesn't make you even cast a tiny doubt they could be still not telling you the truth?
@TheLastWord He could have taken the high road and said "I know he didn't mean anything racist by that comment". But he chose to ride the #racebaiting #hate. Hope he loses now. He showed no morals.
@historBilia @thehill Would we be here debating this if he didn't ban anyone from his funeral? Divided.		There are millions of other people on each side that think like we do also. Divided.
@historBilia @thehill You think you solve problems by not trying to unite and be nice? I really can't follow your thinking here.
@historBilia @thehill If they press charges, they get arrested. If they don't, then they walk.		Very simple concept to get here.
@historBilia @thehill And he went out supporting the divide. Not an attempt to correct it by uniting two parties.
@historBilia @thehill Arrest for assault is the law.
@historBilia @thehill He had a chance to UNITE people. People that he liked and didn't like. He chose not to. Which is fine, his funeral.		But his last political statement was of DIVIDE.
@caffbev86 @historBilia @thehill You should follow my lead here. Block anyone negative from your life because the hate will consume you. Blocked.
@historBilia @thehill Do you know who his VP Running Mate was in 2008?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN This is exactly why they are called the fake news, if they ever ask again.
@CBSNews As much as it sucks. Law is the law. Can't blame the judge.
@caffbev86 @historBilia @thehill For some reason I believe you when you welcome assault on a teacher. But I'd really not want to believe some people have that much #hate within them. Especially people with rainbows and crap by their name.
@thehill I beg to differ. CNN is most certainly the fool in this specific story.		Trump wins in others. But this one, CNN wins.
@historBilia @thehill She hit the teacher too if you read the article.
@historBilia @thehill By specifically asking certain people not to come it divides the Country.		If it was uniting, then he should have welcomed all high profile politicians and got them in the same room, same cause, same feelings. It kind of brings people together when you do that.
@thehill Thank you! Just too bad she wasn't one year older and could be charged as an "adult".
@CNNPolitics Why are you speaking for other people? You don't know why.
@CNN He's the last humble president that we have had.		Reagan - No	Bush - No	Clinton - No	Bush - No	Obama - No	Trump - No
@xeni @AndrewGillum You are a #racist. Odd that you think you are fighting against it.
@benshapiro Uses the correct amount of asterisks also. Impressed.
@thehill Even in death he decides to continue to divide the Country.
@TooncesDaCat @thehill Did you read his comments and not the headline? There is zero chance this was racist.
@thehill This is why you are called fake news.
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Support #hate then. Blocked.
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Weapons and arrest. Again. Nazis didn't show up until Sunday.		https://t.co/Jm8ZFbMkGQ
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 https://t.co/t0sgkQw7xT
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 The right is claiming KKK is good.
@KevinMQuinn @ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 I think all hate groups are disgusting.
@KevinMQuinn @ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 He said he agrees with. That means he supports a hate group. Not difficult.
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 The night before Charlottesville anniversary they attacked cops, media, and other liberals. Their were a bunch of arrests for violent actions and having weapons. ZERO nazis were there. 0. None. Only antifa and other protestors.		Who were they anti fasciming?
@1DLowther @Green_Footballs @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews There has been more senior FBI officials fired or demoted in the last 2 years to let me believe I can take their word as fact.
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Got it. You support a fascist hate group. No need to discuss this any further.
@thehill Well duh. This claim implicates the FBI. Of course they will deny it.
@lsmbpants @jman31474 @NancyPelosi True for me too. Who are you to say it's not?
@politico No. Just lock him up for tax crap and move on. Stop fishing for Trump stuff.
@RepAdamSchiff That's how the Senate works. If they know they don't have the votes then they don't waste peoples time.
@ashcanconsortia @KevinMQuinn @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 If the KKK renamed themselves as "definitely not racist people" then you could never  them racist because their name says the opposite. Your logic.
@Trumpgirl007 @thehill He will have a job at CNN or MSNBC as soon as legally possible.
@KevinMQuinn @ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Antifa are the facisist. The way you protect them I'm assuming you are one. Good luck with your life of hate.
@SpecialEDxx @thehill Trust is based on quality of incoming links. So if more edu or gov sites link to yours the more trust you have. This is how it works for normal search engine optimization.		I do agree with you I think it is biased. But it's also very possible it's not intentionally Googled fault.
@KevinMQuinn @ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Its only dumb if you support this hate group.
@SpecialEDxx @thehill Most likely yes.		But also importance is based off incoming links and their sources. I think we could all agree there are far more liberal media sources. When they all quoted and link to each other it appears they are more important to the algorithm.
@SpecialEDxx @thehill Not saying it's wrong.		But Google does personalize results based on location, browsing history, search history, etc. If they didn't take that all into consideration then the test is useless.
@TIME My 9 year old is clueless about sex. The parents probably encouraged their kid and if so need to be charged.
@Cynthia__Reed @CBSNews @POTUS Glad? You hate Trump so bad you would rather have NK build nukes and threaten us again?		If you are an American citizen. Please get out. We don't want you here. Disgraceful.
@JackWhateley @ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 What's bad about disliking a hate group?
@ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Go ahead and support Antifa. See if I care. No clue why you are trying to protect these people. Maybe you are one.
@maina2013 @ashcanconsortia @BillPascrell @metaquest Murder is murder. Only extremist commit murder. Black on black fatalities dwarf these numbers. Black on whoever crimes are labeled as an extremist for some reason.
@ashcanconsortia @maina2013 @BillPascrell @metaquest False.		Would really like to know what you consider a right wing attack that occurred this year.		You can easily get all the arrests from every rally this year and that's pretty much your Antifa stats there.
@NBCNews Google results are highly manipulated based on location, search history, email content, browsing history, etc. They specifically tailor their results for you.		I don't believe a word they say.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump Glad your still able to tweet this! Thought the internet was going away the way you all made it sound the first time. #fearmongering
@10MMStronger @RepMarkMeadows Nope. Nothing about politics is OK with me. My point is anything and everything you hear is usually just a smear campaign. Don't believe any of it.
@ashcanconsortia @amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Antifa are attacking the right, cops, media, blacks, whites, Mexicans, gay, straight, and other liberals.		So ya. They are just a hate group against everyone.
@Noel_zeek @Coach_Schmitt1 @thehill Not a hero. Just a person with an opinion.
@ashcanconsortia @maina2013 @BillPascrell @metaquest I 100 percent doubt it.
@thegarance So your saying Google manipulates the results based on who you are. Are you trying to prove his point?
@thehill Mass shooting? It will break after the first shot.
@Coach_Schmitt1 @thehill He was below average officer who was a POW. That's not a war hero to me.
@maina2013 @BillPascrell @metaquest Antifa most certainly has created more violence this year than all other hate groups in the US combined.
@newjersey1727 @BillPascrell Antifa. Those are the violent people.
@amysuezq9 @BillPascrell @ccharlamb8 Antifa is attacking everyone now. No clue why or what the hell their plan is.
@BillPascrell Yes. Antifa are fascist. Glad you finally see it.
@SenMarkey The rhetoric is weak with you.
@SenKamalaHarris Ask him a question or two under oath. That's how this works.
@PattyMurray May. May not. Probably not. Not a chance. No.
@10MMStronger @RepMarkMeadows Welcome to politics? That's all you see is smear campaigns against everyone.		The only problem is when you start to believe ANY of them.
@alsosusieq2 @BoehretLeigh @KarrieRainey20 @PaulaVilchez69 @realDonaldTrump Exactly.
@10MMStronger @RepMarkMeadows He's free to speak to anyone he wishes. Can go on CNN right now and tell his story if he wants.
@BoehretLeigh @KarrieRainey20 @PaulaVilchez69 @realDonaldTrump Pick a date right now that you will no longer give Obama credit for anything. I'm sure since you are an economist this should be a fairly simple task.
@nytimes Stop defining people by the color of their skin! We are better than this, right?
@MaddowBlog So? He won't actually win.
@KamalaHarris #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #RACE #BAITER
@AlexCKaufman @kdeleon Amazing! Now what about all the homeless, drugs, house prices, etc? Seems your priorities are not straight if you ask me.
@realDailyWire That's good news. The Supreme Court shouldn't be politicized to the point where we know their names like our favorite football team.
@rachel_maria65 @JRubinBlogger @kazweida @GOP While the @dnc embraces #CyberBullying.
@paulkrugman You are a fool if you think having classified information on a unclassified network is a conspiracy. It's text book illegal and carries a harsh penalty. 		This is so disgusting to defend this action. It's black and white.
@NancyPelosi Can't ever say one thing positive about anything. Your only policy is anti-trump. That's it.
@SenatorMenendez Oh please. They had more help than they could handle. Don't blame this on Trump. That's disgusting behavior for a senator.
@TrevorBland7 @c_barrier @thehill She was a Democrat. Her policies were most definitely to the left.
@TrevorBland7 @c_barrier @thehill Got it. Just don't agree with it.
@TrevorBland7 @c_barrier @thehill Say what?
@FoxNews Acostaism.
@JaneDupree1 @kfhall0852 @ChuckGrassley @SenWhitehouse Sounds like terrorists demands.
@jonathanjewel @ZimmCin @kc2egl @nairam3rd @ChuckGrassley #CyberBully here.
@FreePennyPress @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum Trump is POTUS of the Country. Bernie is a representative of a state.
@yourfactseeker @FoxNews Forgot one. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
@thehill For the divorce of his parents many years ago, right?
@CNN Duh. He's gunning for the position. Why wouldn't he say that?		I'd still go with @TGowdySC if that would entice him to stay in politics.
@bobbitz57 @davidaxelrod @SenJohnMcCain Then there's you. A #cyberbully.
@BernieSanders @CarlosGSmith @AnnaForFlorida @ElectMangold @DotieForFlorida @votemcfadden @CindyPoloFL103 Stop colluding with Florida.
@mesosuchus @TeamNutrition @SecretarySonny Guessing smarter kids grow up to be #cyberbullys?
@BernieSanders @AndrewGillum What do you have to do with Florida elections? COLLUSION!
@cspan @SenatorIsakson That's most the media right now!		He is only being celebrated for one reason and one reason only (from the left). He died anti Trump. If he was pro Trump, they would NOT give him this attention.		They are tarnishing his real legacy and just painting him as anti @realDonaldTrump.
@thehill R E S P I C T!
@Muellertime12 @DonaldJTrumpJr Saying it on Twitter does not make it a fact. Even if you add an lol.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill I understand now and our conversation is pointless going forward.		First you need to deal with the hate that is consuming you. Honestly, I'd highly recommend to stop following politics. I don't think you can emotionally handle it. I promise your life will improve if you do. Bye.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill I don't disagree. But this is the same on both sides.		If you think one side is good an the other is bad, then you are on the losing side. You have been manipulated by the media and political rhetoric. You are just looking for excuses to argue with people. That's not healthy.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill I don't agree. The the terms Nazi, Racists, and Fascist just to name a few have lost all meaning just like fake news.		I have been called a Nazi quite a few times and I am pretty sure I am not in their party. My point is they are terms that are just used as insults now, that's it
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill Like I explained. It's not one definition.		It's like asking someone on the far left to define racist, fascist, or Nazi.		I think the definition I gave is the most accurate for those that use the term. Except the ones that just use it as an insult.
@historBilia @thehill You did. You said, just an election.		Look. You can choose to lose sleep over this if you want to. I won't.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill I got ya. I'm not claiming this one is.
@historBilia @thehill He had zero influence over the election. He is a nobody. He will go to jail for not paying taxes.		My point is there are better things in life to focus on than this guy or politics in general. Especially if it makes you upset.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill I can't speak for him but I don't think this one in particular is. CNN got a quote from Cohens lawyer that Trump knew about the Russian meeting. The lawyer said he was the source and no longer believed that to be true. The source changed their mind or either lied.
@historBilia @thehill American citizens controlled who won the election. Not Paul Manafort.
@TIME Time claims without evidence that Trump claims without evidence that Google is rigging search results against him.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill First you need to understand the definition of fake news as its use differently. Smear campaigns disguised as news/journalism is my definition and a widely accepted one. Which means fake news is subjective.
@historBilia @thehill Correct. It's illegal and he obviously tries to cheat the system with fraud and taxes.		But he is no spy infiltrating the government and whatever else you want to add.		He is a bad guy who loves money. A nobody. Shouldnt waste a second of our personal lives on him.
@wookietim @SeanChampVA @thehill He said CNN, not The Hill.
@historBilia @thehill An unreported foreign agent. A lobbiest for another country.
@historBilia @thehill That is not a spy.
@historBilia @thehill I don't even think being a spy is one of his 100 charges.
@SenTinaSmith @SenateDems Anyone confirmed would NO DOUBT have a say on issues. That would be their job.
@historBilia @thehill If you care about 1 dude cheating on his taxes then I'd say you need some hobbies.
@SenWhitehouse Luckily you have access to all his public rulings, can setup a meeting with him and talk for hours, and even get to ask questions at his hearing while he's under oath.		But noooooo. You just want to play this document game and politicize the Supreme Court
@thehill I thought it was trump who was the Russian spy. Who cares if Manafort has ties.
@USNavy @RepBillFlores That's like the bare minimum. The color guards, CDO, Section Leader, and a watchstander.		Would have been nice to see the whole ship observing colors.
@bercbon4 @thehill You are not invited to mine now.		So you tell me. How awful are you?
@MichaelSkolnik Trump is off by 4 percent on his poll numbers and people go insane! But it's cool to exaggerate 1800 mass shootings.
@eastwest6566 @NBCNews I like my US Citizens who don't believe all this crap.
@MyCharlestonPad @Sherr_77 @thehill @GOP Welcome to Twitter, #CyberBully.
@maggieb84505956 @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC He's running for next AG. That's for sure.
@jeffreyhenning @thehill My statement still stands and is 100 percent accurate.
@bozo60638 @thehill You think he's a hero just because he was anti Trump. You don't give a shit about McCain.
@Sherr_77 @thehill @GOP You only like him because he was anti Trump before he died. To me, that's disgusting.
@jeffreyhenning @thehill Anyone who thinks one side is good and the other is bad is most definitely a hypocrite.
@NewOrlnsDukie @thehill For the last time. Obama was a Christian, not a Muslim!
@thehill I supported some of Obamas policies and not droning.
I think before I die I'm going to start a fued with Trump so the media will celebrate my life and call me a hero. There is absolutely no way this would have played out this way if John McCain never was anti Trump. I think it's disgusting to mask his real legacy with this garbage.
@CNN No trade agreement? Doesn't fit your anti Trump narrative?
@Sir_Bradford @MichaelSkolnik @MrJonCryer Most congressman get 2k or nothing from NRA. If you really think it's about money a simple gofundme to raise 500k should buy enough congressman to ban guns.		Think we all know why that won't work. It's absolutely not about money.
@TIME Thought he just went to counseling once after his parents divorced. Is that really a "history"?
@CBSNews Please don't politicize suicide.
@AndresG52337904 @MsResister @CNN Hug accepted. But keep your hands off my butt.
@brianschatz Why would they donate to you if you don't share their values? Pretty dumb.
@KamalaHarris don't work for these companies.
@RepBarbaraLee Maybe they should have worked while in college. Or worked and saved up prior to. Or not go.		Plenty of choices. They apparently chose poorly.
@thehill But please. Push the EA sports incident.
@SteveSisolak Why not ban cars. They kill a ton more people and aren't constitutionally protected.		That is if you cared about deaths. But you don't. Just the small number of gun deaths. To politicize then. #disgusting
@TheKidFour20 @johnny_mac57 @Acosta Think you are #CyberBullying the wrong person. I never disagreed with you.
@TheKidFour20 @johnny_mac57 @Acosta I read them and that's how I know it is not evidence.
@AndresG52337904 @MsResister @CNN Wow. #racist.		Do you even know the odds of being killed by someone like this?
@berninarita @MrDane1982 24/7 assault by the media? You must just watxh Fox then.
@LeighMcKnight @MrDane1982 @HillaryClinton No help from the media? You mean like debate questions?		I can't believe you are serious.
@BernersFor @JK43108 @MrDane1982 @EspeOppenheimer I have a feeling you are sexist.
@MsResister @CNN Who don't you feel safe from?
@ABC This show will bomb.
@wiwolfyone @Acosta You are no better than Trump you #CyberBully.
@johnny_mac57 @TheKidFour20 @Acosta Newspapers and television is now evidence. That's special.
@AtreiyaN7 @Acosta #CyberBully much? You are no better than him.
@wilskurtz @SenGillibrand You don't care about deaths. You just politicize them.		Thousands more die from automobiles everyday. Yet, you don't care about their deaths? You don't want to ban them?
@wilskurtz @SenGillibrand Then buy a congressman for an easy 2k.
@KamalaHarris You think by posting this 10 times a day it helps? Well it does. It helps you get votes. That's all you care about.
@wilskurtz @SenGillibrand It's a dumb argument to think it's about the money. Buy yourself 100 congressman for chump change and pass some bills.		Think we all know why that doesn't work.
@SenGillibrand Why not just pay more than the NRA to Congressman to vote in your favor? Most only receive 2k from the NRA and that's chump change.		If it's about money, do a gofundme and raise 2.5k and you just bought yourself a vote in your favor!		Math is cool.
@truthskr007 @CNN I'm sure someone will give him credit. I was joking.
@LkMoller13 @JeffMerkley @BarackObama @GOP Trade deal with Mexico.
@CNN Thanks Obama.
@thehill So?
@kimiam73 @RepMarkTakano Guessing you never read it.
@StJimmySonofGun @thehill Have my doubts. But, OK.
@StJimmySonofGun @thehill You're a member?
@spankythedotard @thehill Well if you quote it all and not just one piece it does.
@thoudailyblab @thehill It was also in a murder free zone.
@thehill Agree. But I don't think that would have stopped him here. Was over fairly quickly.
@zayaanazfar @AlanJohnLondon @CNN Unbelievably false. They are physical objects not protected by the constitution and kill waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwy more than guns. Way more. I mean by a ton. 		Just admit you really don't care about the deaths. Just some strange obsession with guns.
@AlanJohnLondon @CNN Now do alcohol. Driving. Sugar. Heart disease. Cancer. 		You know. The main concerns.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill Depends your definition of fake news.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill It does. It bothers me about all fake news. The left, the right, the whatever.		If you only think there's one side to fake news, that's on you.
@jamescando @TeamPelosi Oh wow. You are truly confused. Please seek help. Muted.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill Nope. Go read their tweets if you want. Im a both sides suck type of person.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill Understand how this works. Still don't care about poll numbers.
@jamescando @TeamPelosi You just assumed my gender. What a person has between their legs does not define them.
@hubertdubert1 @thehill Well I guess you will never know.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill 100s of congressman on the left took time out of their day to take some jabs at Trump.		Do you condone that behavior?
@hubertdubert1 @thehill Then you know my number. Google the area code.
@hubertdubert1 @thehill You've never heard me speak.
@thehill Before I die I'm going to make enemies with Trump so everyone will honor me.
@hubertdubert1 @thehill I'm sure he won't lose any sleep over your hard decide.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill Agree. Same goes to the left.
@jamescando @TeamPelosi That's very sexist. You are voting for someone because their gender.
@jamescando @TeamPelosi No. I think you need to work on how to talk to woman.
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill He mixed up the numbers 48% and 52%, who cares. What's 4%?		My point is he takes the high poll numbers and the media will take the low. It's a dumb little game.
@jamescando @TeamPelosi You just said woman have yet to reach their full potential.		Are you serious. Are you advocating for woman or putting them down? I can't take you seriously. I get it, you hate woman and you think you are better than them.
@ZYBLMNL @RepRaskin First solution. #cyberbullying like you just did leads to #depression and #suicide which have been skyrocketing recently with all the #fear and #hate the media, politicians, and people like you push. I'd recommend people stop being so negative. Today was a #suicidemurder.
@brianschatz I hope Congress will one day go a day without talking about Trump. Maybe a little less #cyberbulling also would be cool.		It's better to spread positive messages than to be negative all the time. When you surround yourself with negative it consumes you. You are surrounding people
@jamescando @TeamPelosi Apparently you agree with politicians telling people they are lesser people due to their gender. I'm for equality for all and we have that right now. If you are being told you don't by some politician, they are lying to you.
@thehill We get it. He picks the polls with the higher numbers and you pick the polls with the lower numbers. Who cares? You both suck.
@HuffPost HuffPost is GLAD he didn't wipe out ISIS just so they can say this. How bad is that?
@PolisForCO So I live in Colorado Springs now and saw this so I had to go see who you were. I go to your website and see issues, thought I would start with Gun Control.		There you politicize the death of children, so I don't think there is anything else I need to learn. You lost my vote.
@dennisclaude3 @thehill @realDonaldTrump And this makes you a #cyberbully. No better than Trump. Congrats!
@ChadPergram Not to be disrespectful but hasn't it been quiet there for awhile?
@ZYBLMNL @RepRaskin What is this? I'm retired Navy so I completely understand that part.		But how would this have prevented it?
@RepRaskin Which common sense gun policy would have prevented this?		You are not elected to push problems on Twitter back to the people. You are there to come up with solutions. What is your solution?		What does the NRA have to do with this? Stop politicizing murder.
@TopRopeTravis @DavidCornDC @Alyssa_Milano @AndrewGillum @joncoopertweets @NathanLerner @tarastrong @TrueFactsStated @funder @Mikel_Jollett @kim Another mass shooting today and instead of you sending out condolences you tweet about Donald Trump.		So if you hate him for doing that, look in the mirror.
@RepWilson Thought the Democrat party stance was "we are not trying to take your guns".
@RepMikeCapuano Which sensible gun control measure would have prevented this?		Stop listing problems and start listing proposed solutions. You were not elected to tell your constituents of all the problems. You are there to fix it. How are you going to do that?
@dennisclaude3 @thehill If you think it's that simple why not do a gofundme for just a tad over what the NRA pays him, which isn't much, and buy his vote for strict gun control.
@RepMarkTakano Which bill would have prevented this one?		All you are doing is listing problems with zero solutions. What is your solution?
@ddiamond @RepDonBeyer So last Sunday this happened too?
@LibAmerican @AJoe1958 @thehill Let's just say he is. Although obviously not officially charged and convicted.		Why do you care so much? What do you think it's hurting? How does this effect your day to day life?
@rfickman Jewish people aren't white you #CyberBully
@LibAmerican @AJoe1958 @thehill Ok. So you don't believe in innocent until proven guilty. My bad.
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette I don't know. If you want to get an abortion then you should know before 15 weeks right?		Are you suggesting woman should be allowed to get an abortion right up to the day before delivery? There needs to be a cut off date, right?
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette I am appalled.		Current politics is what I am referring to. The original discussion was about woman's rights and that was passed decades ago.		There have been good public servants. But most get to that spot by using fear. I'd say ALL of them currently do. I read all their feeds.
@alex_xxo @WhiteHouse Jewish is white? Why you #racebaiting?
@SphallSteve1245 Jewish is white now? #racebaiter
@TravisWillough6 Thought Jewish wasn't considered white.
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette I thought it was just not letting them use a specific procedure. They can still get abortions using whatever the "better" method is.
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette Politics in my opinion is fearmongering, both sides.		Fear is the number one emotion that get's people to act. Politicians and media use it constantly. 		Campaigns are just smear your opponent. Don't vote for me, vote against this person because they will do XXXXXX. #fear.
@Cali_Verb I think we got off on the wrong foot.
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette Alabama tried to and federal government said, nope. So they didn't lose anything.
@Cali_Verb #cyberbully
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette Understand. But politicians have been using the potential fear of losing womans rights for decades and it never happens. Same fear tactic with social security and medicare.		They tell you that you will lose this THING so you better vote for us. Just general fearmongering.
@Cali_Verb Ok #racists #racebaiter.
@LibAmerican @AJoe1958 @thehill So we both agree Trump is innocent right now, right?
@Cali_Verb And?
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette That's #fearmongering. I asked what they have LOST.		Not what people tell you that woman could lose in order to get your votes.
@Cali_Verb Thought he was Jewish.
@GeneralHealthy Jewish is white?
@rfickman Jewish is white now?
@Marysalamone8 Jewish isn't white you #racebaiter.
@LibAmerican @AJoe1958 @thehill None of which is evidence or proof, yet.		If every administration had a special counsel to investigate them there would be tons of arrests. People with power are dirty. People with a ton of money are dirty. It's not a left/right issue. I'm glad it's happening.
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette Thought this was equality day. 		What rights have women lost?
@howard3848 @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes #racebaiter
@MattyF21 Nice #racebaiting here.
@LibAmerican @thehill Did it stop the investigation?
@AJoe1958 @LibAmerican @thehill I do read his tweets. Innocent until proven guilty.
@Justagu27160787 That's absurd.
@VivaMattyVegas Mmmmm delicious #racebaiting.
@LibAmerican @thehill You don't understand the definition of obstruction of justice then. Trump can fire people that works for him for whatever reason he wants. Also there needs to be a crime to obstruct.		Innocent until proven guilty.
@GypsySpirit46 @IvankaTrump @POTUS #racebaiting is cool.
@ahowlett99 #racebaiting is cool.
@ceetron Ok #cyberbully.
@LibAmerican @thehill You watch too much news. He has not desperately trying to stop him. It is not obstruction of justice.
@ceetron You are taking time to troll Trump. So you must be just like Trump, eh?
@madisonians1789 @RepDianaDeGette THOSE ARE ALL EQUAL RIGHTS!		Men don't have more rights than women when it comes to those.
@eugenegu This was a #suicide. We have a #suicide problem.
@NickKramarev So the gun used today was on this list?
@YOUR_ADSUCKS @RandalisMyName @CNN Get your hands off my fire!
@RepAndreCarson This was a #suicide.		Please enlighten me with the law you would propose that would have prevented this. Don't just push this problem on other congressman. What is your solution?
@SenBobCasey Explain 1 law that would have prevented it. What's the 1 law you would pass?		Stop asking for others to fix the problems you are bringing up. What is your solution? This is why you were elected.
@SenBobCasey Take action on the increased #suicide rates. This was a suicide.
@YOUR_ADSUCKS @RandalisMyName @CNN Don't think the constitution states we have a right to fire though. Could be about time for another amendment.
@CNN I'm not allowed to care about these deaths because it didn't involve guns and no one can be blamed or a movement can't be politicized. Sorry.
@janschakowsky You have equality! You've had it for decades.		Stop trying to bring woman down by telling them they don't. It's sad.
@RipDingers @thehill He makes fun of a senator.	You make fun of a POTUS.		So you are just as disgusting as him. Congrats!
@DeVosPruittare1 @CNNPolitics That's because they are politicizing his death and it's about trump. That's is. It's disgusting.
@CNNPolitics Trump hate sure does motivate.		This isn't about McCain. They are politicizing his death to attempt to get trump to shoot this down. Pathetic.
@restructures @SenDuckworth Don't commit felonies then.
@persephone_i @SenDuckworth @AynRandPaulRyan This is stupid. Everyone has the ability to vote.
@SenDuckworth What's this full equality crap? Equal is equal. Woman have been equal for decades. This is dumb.
@DeptVetAffairs @VAVetBenefits Woman are already equal. Have been for decades. Why would we focus on the future? Can't be even more equaller.
@DWStweets It was another #suicide. It's not a gun problem, it's a suicide issue.
@thehill As she speaks for her....
@AlanJohnLondon @AP America has a #suicide problem. Mass shootings are just a new way to commit suicide.
@NBCNews Stop reporting people by the color of their skin. #racebaiting
@TeamPelosi Tired of this equal rights crap. You keep telling woman and people of color that they are lesser people than white men. You are the one keeping them down!		Everyone has equal rights right now. Have for decades. Start lifting people up instead of bringing them down. Disgusting.
@OmeedFirouzi @RepDwightEvans @AgnewsansNixon Nice looking democratic campaign rally disguised as #hate and #fear.
@jayk185 @FoxNews Who cares the color of the skin on this killer! Stop #racebaiting.
@keithellison Woman have had equal rights for decades. Stop saying they don't. It's kind of insulting.
@LibAmerican @thehill Well we don't have one of those right now so we are good.		Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. It's still a thing, you know?
@janembatten @Turn_Eclipse @unbrokeMs1 @RepDarrenSoto @Everytown @CityofJax There isn't. It's a lie. Probably 50/50.		Insanity doesn't care what your political affiliations are.
@RepDarrenSoto How?
@LibAmerican @thehill You think Republicans are talking about impeachment?
@armybike Then you could have just not responded. No I'm required to leave mine.		You don't care about people. Just politics.
@thehill No. The media is really all that's talking about it. #fakenews
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ Again. Innocent until proven guilty.
@armybike OK. Thousands die everyday. But we care about these few the most. Got it.
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ That's not how the law works. Cohen is not a judge. He could have said Hillary made him do it, so we just take this liars word?
@armybike Immediately politicize because you don't care.
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ That's not proof yet. Innocent until proven guilty.
@ReformedFL @Trumpgirl007 @thehill @TheDemocrats Why not? Don't millions of people hate Trump because they disagree with him?
@Impeacherator @Dougwil08943651 @thlhoo @johncardillo Obama was the President. Obama said the elections couldn't be hacked. Obama was in charge. Don't play silly games.		You wouldn't try to say Trump isn't responsible for anything right now, right?
@Dougwil08943651 @thlhoo @johncardillo Can't forget allowed Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential elections.
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ I'm not protecting him. He is innocent until proven guilty. Just like every other US Citizen. In order for Trump to be guilty it will require a lot evidence. Well depends on if we are just talking a little fine or something else. I don't care if he's guilty or innocent.
@ReformedFL @Trumpgirl007 @thehill @TheDemocrats Understand. Your opinion is he is a hero and others is he is a traitor.		Who's right? Who cares. It's an opinion and can be based on facts.
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ Trump said pay this woman off, right? It's on the tape.		He did not say to pay it the way Cohen did which led to Cohen breaking the law.		All I am saying is there needs to be physical evidence that Trump FORCED him to pay it through inappropriate means with intent to deceive.
@ReformedFL @Trumpgirl007 @thehill @TheDemocrats My claim is someone can be a traitor and a hero at different times of their lives. Please provide evidence that this is impossible. 		I did not call him a hero or a traitor.
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ No one is obligated to break the law for their employer. People are responsible for their own actions.		I don't think there is physical evidence that would prove anything here against Trump and this story will go away fairly quickly. It's really not a big deal.
@RepDianaDeGette Expand Woman's Rights? Pretty sure we are all equal under the law already and have been for a long time.		What are you suggesting by expanding? Woman &gt; Men now?
@IggsO54 @IdleMusing @WSJ If there is physical evidence the Trump FORCED Cohen to break campaign finance laws then there is.		But if I tell you to go rob a bank and you do. Is that my fault?
@HillaryClinton COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR
@peake_joe @IdleMusing @WSJ I agree.
@IdleMusing @WSJ Might. Agree.		I'm just an innocent until proven guilty person. Really don't care if he is ever found guilty of anything. Only thing will change is the new POTUS will be the target. Same old crap.
@ReformedFL @Trumpgirl007 @thehill @TheDemocrats One can be both at different times of their lives.
@IdleMusing @WSJ I don't know if Cohens word is good in a court of law either.
@MichaelSkolnik Any decent democrat out there that will defend  the unwarranted attacks on Trump? Nope.
@FilmmakerJulie Tons of responses about him bringing people together but by excluding the current POTUS it actually divides. All this will bring together is Trump haters and that's not even needed.
@TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump You have tons of people in here hoping for the death of trump and McConnell. Want to make a tweet about that also?
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Pretty sure this conversation will go nowhere with this attitude.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Google all you want. This conversation is about is about income. Now you want to broaden it?
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad My claim is Americans are well better off compared to the rest of the world. The article most certainly backs that up.		The rich people making all the money is your claim.
@GenMhayden Articulate and convincing response.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Here I'll help.		https://t.co/73Dz5jRGQ5
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Google.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Like I said, almost Americans are in the one percent compared globally. I don't buy the rich man takes all the money stories.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Slavery too. Yes I know.		But a capitalism system only works with minimal government, regulations, and taxes. So right now we aren't doing it right. I'm talking pre world wars. 1800s.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Almost all Americans fall into the one percent on a global scale. I think we are doing pretty good.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad America was kicking ass and taking names before that time. So yes. Most definitely.		That's when capitalism worked. When the government grew, had more regulations, more taxes, etc, that is why capitalism no longer is effective as it can be. It's being sabotaged by bug government.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad End it as in not letting more people join and after everyone that's on it gets what they paid into has died. Yes.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I'd like them to do none of that. They should be in charge of military and that's about it.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Money = month.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Yes. Personally I'd like to go back to pre 1920 before income tax existed and tariffs made the government month. Then of course dramatically reduce the federal government.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Dude. It's the same every year.
@dwellers_desert @NBCNews No. Just pay the fine and move on.
@RoKhanna Agree ACA needs to go.
@chuckwolber @thehill Definitely. It's not a real term with a solid definition. There are a bunch of different interpretations. I feel the way I defined it is the way Trump sees it.		But some take it a completely different way.
@Cliche_Guevara3 @GoodvsTrump @AlisonDunn13 @CNNPolitics Is for me too. I watch for entertainment purposes only. If you think it's real and take it too seriously it can jack you up.
@RepKarenBass Leslie Knope still work there?
@thehill I'd prefer them not to. Well I don't watch TV. But if I did I would not care to see the political crap. So good on them.
@mscott7612 @TIME This guy sleeps.
@soonerscorpio @thehill #CyberBully
@KamalaHarris Stupid idea.
@NBCNews Breaking campaign finance laws are the same no matter what. Unless the left is creating a "hate crime" version of this now.
@FoxNews @DougLuzader @POTUS Neither will get 2/3 majority in senate do it won't really matter much.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Same article gets posted every year.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Yes. They want to make the government smaller. Take in less money and spend less. I'm 100 percent on board.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad ACA is not social security or Medicare. They have never gutted these programs but had multiple opportunities.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad If they wanted to take it away they have had multiple chances over the decades where they had the power to do it. They didn't.		So historically speaking, it's very low odds this would ever happen and therefor its just fear mongering.
@thehill Thanks Obama.
@thehill Didn't McCain deliver this BS dossier to the FBI? I wouldn't care for him either if he did that to me. War hero or not.
@senorrinhatch Politicizing the Supreme Court is disgusting. This goes both ways. Just be silent, make your vote, and let's move on.		It's your vote. No reason to explain yourself or try to sway others.
@JoyceWhiteVance That's what VPs do.
@chuckwolber @thehill He has stated the fake news is the enemy of the people.		The fake news reports him as saying "the free press" is the enemy of the people.		I agree. The fake news is dividing is. The free press is doing their job. The problem is there is no absolute distinction between the two.
@c_barrier @thehill They should. No one should support this group. They need to get called out on both sides.
@chuckwolber @thehill Currently. I don't believe so when it comes to politics, race, sex, and religion.		Everything else. Great. But all those topics are being warped on both sides to influence the way people think and feel.		The 24/7 news model is one of the worst things that has happened in a while.
@chuckwolber @thehill Journalists have a code of ethics which we should all trust they follow. They don't. Both sides.		If you have never read their code of ethics it's pretty interesting to see how much they all deviate from it.
@chuckwolber @thehill No. My point was they might mention it but quickly move on. 		If it were a "Nazi", you know what they would have done, right?
@chuckwolber @thehill I see it as the media NOT reporting the story. Or completely ignoring it. There were no Nazis there that night to blame.		I'm guessing you saw the video, right?		https://t.co/ZXLREhDdWL
@chuckwolber @thehill Trump says Fake Media is the enemy of the people.	Media says Trump says Free Press is the eneny of the people.	Ran this 24/7 for weeks.		NBC reporter gets attacked by ANTIFA recently. Someone actually attacking the free press for recording him. Almost complete silence....
@LesleyRHafalia @thehill I don't disagree that he is. All rich and political elites are in my opinion.		Well not all. But most.
@chuckwolber @thehill Observations.
@LesleyRHafalia @thehill Their very well could be bad Russian money connected to Trump. He is a world wide businessman. Anyone that rich probably could be nailed for tax fraud.		But the point that Putin owns him, controls him, and they worked together for him to get elected is where I draw the line.
@chuckwolber @thehill I see ANTIFA as individual groups and not one big structure. Every event the hooded ANTIFA shows up as they start fights.		Kind of like the KKK. Just a bunch of small chapters that follow the same principal but kind of do their own thing.
@LesleyRHafalia @thehill Yes we will. I don't care if he is guilty or not.		My comment was on how this turned from Russian Collusion to Tax Fraud pretty quickly.
@LesleyRHafalia @thehill Remember those words that got Clinton off the hook? It would completely apply here also. No difference.
@Pinch20399778 @PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics I'm with you that is real and people could be. But until someone is actually charged and fined I'll just consider this a publicity stunt. 		I do think one day someone will get charged with it and the shit show will begin. Nothing more the media wouldn't like to cover this 24/7.
@thehill All just to find some tax fraud. Think we have better things to worry about.		Even if tax fraud is found Trump doesn't do his taxes himself. Would be very difficult to hold him accountable.
@chuckwolber @thehill Hell no. Antifa is a group of fascists that wear masks and use violence to silence anyone that are not them. Left, right, cops, media, etc. They have attacked them all.		Do you really now know who or what Antifa is?
@chuckwolber @thehill There are no good ANTIFA and that's what I am discussing.
@Pinch20399778 @PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics I've remember this too back in the day and was going to cite it but I don't believe anyone has been punished yet. So really it's just a political statement in my opinion.
@thehill Here is something I can get behind. Pretty much just filter all politics, race, religion, sex, etc. You know the stuff we really didn't talk about back in the day because it's pointless and just causes divide.
@chuckwolber @thehill Are all cops bad?
@chuckwolber @thehill They are a group of people that spread hate. Attack cops, attack the media, pretty much attack anyone that isn't wearing a black mask. Pretty hateful if you ask me.
@RepDonBeyer He also swore over a dozen times he had nothing to do with it. Are you saying you believe him now, this time.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Still not forced.		Fired, jailed. Both sucks.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Which was appealed by DoJ early this year and lost in district court. So the way I understand it, sexual orientation is still protected federally unless they take it to the SCOTUS.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics By your definition law can't force you to do anything either. You have a choice. It's just not a good enough argument for me, sorry.		The law can't force you not to murder someone. You still have a choice.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Federal law provides them with the protection.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics I haven't mentioned the law. You have.		Which states let you fire people for being gay?
@chuckwolber @thehill Any news media company that runs anti Trump rhetoric 24/7. Any politician that has a D next to their name. Any wacko civilian that supports this hate group.		There's my definition of the people included in my comment.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics They are forcing people with different beliefs to go against those beliefs in order to keep their job they might have had for decades.		When the risk outweighs the reward it's forcing whether you like that particular word or not.
@thehill Can't wait for the left to denounce this group. Any day now.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics If you want to keep your job you do.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Society standards. You think a transgender kid in 4th grade the students and teachers are allowed to call them by their real gender?
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Who said anything about law?
@ChrisCoons Review his RULINGS. What he did as a judge and his rulings are all that matters. Stop politicizing the Supreme Court with this document game.
@PyrrhosPal @CNNPolitics Agree. And don't force me to call a man a woman.
@NoahCRothman Same goes to illegal immigrants, school shooting victims, bad dudes getting shot by cops, etc.
@RoKhanna Are ISPs private organizations?
@ABC Which part do you believe is the truth? Told so many lies its hard to tell.
@ChrisVanHollen That is false. Impeachment is the process for removing a president and he 100% fully supports that process. Stop lying to people.
@RepAdamSchiff No they don't. Democrats have been saying this for DECADES. You are #fearmongering.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Not that easy.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I don't. That fear mongering rhetoric has been around for decades. Nothing ever changes.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I guess it will be explained better at the conclusion. As of right now Cohen broke the law on his own.		If I told you to go rob a bank and you did it, would I be in trouble? But but he told me to...
@Rocket_CoffeeCo @SenJeffMerkley With the exception of porn starts Obama did the same, so I guess he's just as bad as Trump?
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I disagree. While they push the truth they hide it in opinions and fear to sway people. Both sides do this.
@ChzGoddess @thehill Discuss is you asking 1 question and getting a response.		What you are doing is far from that. You can't let it go. Harassment.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Grid lock. No party should control all 3 branches.		That way no one sided agenda gets through and only what's truly important and helps all Americans (not just one side) will get passed.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Me too. But when it comes to the law, I don't.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Yes. They admit to paying off this woman.		But that is not defined as breaking a campaign finance law yet. Trump says pay this woman, Cohen then does it the wrong way which is why he was charged.		So you need to prove trump forced him to do it the wrong way.
@MileHighLife303 @CBSNews Understand. That's why Trump had a less of a chance to win because all the dirty politics the republicans did against each other. He still won. But he did lose votes from just watching the Republicans fight each other before they even got to the main event.
@MileHighLife303 @CBSNews The more they have the less chances the chosen will win.
@TheBarALot @SenJeffMerkley Thought that was someone else. @RepAdamSchiff I think, Or did they both?
@SenJeffMerkley I believe they already are.		You know what else a Senator should not be doing? Calling the POTUS an organized crime boss. Isn't this is in your ethics manual somewhere? Or is it only on the Senate floor. Twitter you can just #cyberbully all you want.
@thehill Can't we all just agree on innocent until proven guilty and let the professionals sort that out?
@CNNPolitics Dumb. That's like blaming guns on killing people.
@Draco_Rider @DrYardSale @cato218 @CNNPolitics No. You didn't insult me, you were insulting trump supporters.		I was just making the observation that you are a #cyberbully.
@ChzGoddess @thehill What do you personally get out of attempting to dissect meanings of tweets? Would you correct my grammar if I made a mistake? Why are you trying to tell me what I meant when I wasn't even talking to you?		But seriously, What do you get some high or something doing this?
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad It doesn't FORCE Cohen to break campaign finance laws. It is a discussion about him making a hush money payment which he has done for decades. Well before the election. Easily argued this has nothing to do with the election. (I think we all see it does). But legally, no.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Would you be surprised if I told you I want Democrats to win either the house or senate this year? Probably not for the same reasons as most, but I do.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Exactly. Unless I see it with my own eyes then I won't believe it. The media is full of fear mongering and rarely what they state becomes fact. It's just pushing fear to increase their ad revenue.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad No one is going to believe him now. There will need to be physical evidence and they wouldn't just go off his word anyway. He could have said Clinton told him to do it, does that mean she's automatically guilty? No, that's not how the law works.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad My life has not changed one bit on the last 2 decades due to policy changes. Those are my thoughts on the fear mongering that is a pushed by media and politicians.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Chohen also stated a dozen times trump has nothing to do with it. Point being his word is tainted now and that is why physical evidence is needed.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Didn't meant to say will.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Will, might, could, etc.		Same fear messages that are constantly pushed.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Innocent until proven guilty. That is my only opinion or stance in this and it has nothing to do with political sides. If you disagree and people should be convicted before tried, then that's on you.
@ChzGoddess @thehill I rarely specify. My distrust is in the media. Not the left or right. Right now I hate the left media even more. When Obama was president I hated the right media more. Which ever side is doing the smear campaigns the most, I hate. So it's usually the opposite of the POTUS
@ChzGoddess @thehill I do the same. I read all sources and come to my own conclusion.		My conclusion when it comes to the media is everyone of them have an agenda and a bias right now. Either for the left or right. It's all disgusting behavior.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad To suggest I am not is silly. As you suggested we are strangers. You have no clue who I am or what I have read.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Every IG reports states ZERO evidence of collusion and that's what I go off for now. If all said and done there is, so be it. I don't care.		I'm an innocent until proven guilty type of person. Right now, he is innocent and should be treated as such until the time comes he is not.
@ChzGoddess @thehill No. Because I don't believe pretty much ANYTHING that is posted on the internet. I go off my observations. Not a sheep.
@ChzGoddess @thehill Read my feed if you wish. I dislike dishonest and biased media. I don't know how or why you are trying to change my opinion or feelings.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Well you lost me at Trumps Russian allies.		If you believe that then there's no reason to have a discussion.
@ChzGoddess @thehill I read The Hill. I understand what it is.		This chart is so full of BS.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad It would never get passed the Senate which requires 2/3, so what's the point?
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Highly disagree. I will let the courts decide this, not you.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Very little impact has been felt from tariffs and trade wars so far. But I do agree it could get bad, just hasn't yet.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I understand what impeachment is. I also understand it would take A LOT to be impeached. Waaaaaaaaaaaaay more than what we currently have. Democrats don't even agree we should be impeaching.
@ChzGoddess @thehill This is being posted on The Hills account. I was talking to The Hill. The Hill is left media.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad The tape does not say Trump directed him to break campaign finance laws. That is what will need to be proven with physical evidence.
@ChzGoddess @thehill My statement is correct. Find me some positively spun news from the left in Trumps favor.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I am not a Trump supporter.		But I agree there are wackos on both sides. People defend Trump no matter what. People that attack Trump no matter what.		I don't believe he is a racists.	I do believe he is a womanizer.	I don't believe his policies are a disaster.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad The top news story on Google right now. It's not just the Republicans.		https://t.co/Ggw8MP5lSS
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad In order to prove this Cohen will need to present physical evidence that Trump FORCED him to BREAK campaign finance laws. I highly doubt this evidence exists.		Presidents can be indicted, they just need to be impeached first.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I will let time answer that question for you. 100 people say it is, 100 people say it isn't.		I believe it isn't. You believe it is.		Until the time comes. Innocent until proven guilty.
@regan11218lane Then complain to your lawmakers if you don't like the laws the US has had for a very long time.		But personally I would never put my children in that position by attempting to illegally cross the border. I would have done it the correct way and not tried to sneak in.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad I 100% do not disagree this is disgusting and shameful behavior.		But it's not illegal and he's been doing this for decades. It does not change the fact that people keep claiming they have the "end of the president" tapes and never release them.
@Burp_Reynolds @MetallicaDad Right, which wasnt really that bad. Then they said their are more.... Never to to be released.
@ChzGoddess @thehill The left media will never say anything good about Trump. The same way the right media would never say good about Obama.		I haven't picked a side. I can talk shit about both sides. Not everyone is on a side. Some people see passed that crap.
@TheRealShecky @thehill I don't need to. I'll be your punching bag if it makes you feel better. It's better you do it to me than other people that might not be able to handle the hate as well. So please, keep it coming and consider me your emotional outlet. Let the hate flow to me.
@FrankPallone I trust them more than the government and I don't trust them at all.
@TheRealShecky @thehill Your Twitter feed is full of hate and cyberbullying. You know this. Don't deny it.
@WallaceRitchie @thehill Not a trump supporter. Never said that.		Are you saying any war hero is free from criticism for the rest of their lives? War heros can't do anything negative. Ever? I'm pretty sure if you know history there are plenty of men who served that turned out to be turds later in life.
@ChzGoddess @thehill Laughing doesn't make your opinions a fact.
@tl1318 @TheRealShecky @thehill Another #CyberBully. Seems to be a lot around these parts.
@WallaceRitchie @thehill All opinions. Doesn't change the facts.
@TheRealShecky @thehill I'm fine. I'm not the one that has emotional issues that causes me to freak out on the internet attacking people. But I'd highly recommend you stop following politics because I think it's effecting you emotionally in a very negative way. Life can be better if you let it.
@ChzGoddess @thehill That is literally false.
@TheRealShecky @thehill Well you go from 0 to #CyberBully pretty fast.
@thehill The media wouldn't have anything positive say about trump while he's still alive either. What's your point?
@RepPaulTonko Would you rather have a less educated kid or a dead kid?
@dscc #fear, #hate, and #antitrump. The only 3 positions the DNC is pushing.
@regan11218lane @thehill I blame the parents over the last 6 years who put their children in this position. Not the person who was the president at the time.
@stl_jaguar @thehill Would you care to explain your position or just being a #CyberBully?
@thehill Media should just stop pushing so much fear and hate.
@Draco_Rider @DrYardSale @cato218 @CNNPolitics And you're a #CyberBully.
@Draco_Rider @DrYardSale @cato218 @CNNPolitics I do everyday. That's my point.
@BellaPelagia @AlisonDunn13 @CNNPolitics Yes I do. For entertainmet and educational purposes only.		Can't take anything serious because all the politicians and media just push fear and hate on you. Both sides.
@MikeLevinCA I like politicians that talk positive and not just play smear the POTUS while spreading #hate, #fear, and #depression.
@dennisclaude3 @thehill Wow. You are believing a fox news reporter and say they are telling the truth.		Fact is you just label the media truth with what you believe. That's why most of the time you probably say CNN is the truth. It's not truth, it just supports your beliefs. That's it.
@BellaPelagia @AlisonDunn13 @CNNPolitics Oh wow. If you truly believe that I'd recommend to stop following politics. Your life will improve greatly. Less fear and hate.		You are a victim of political rhetoric and media manipulation. Not trying to be harsh, but that is the simple fact.
@Burp_Reynolds No. They claimed to have tapes also.
@GoodvsTrump @AlisonDunn13 @CNNPolitics How would your life improve?		For instance, the 50 million people that thought the same about Obama, did their lives actually improve when Obama was gone?		My point is, absolutely nothing will change if this is happens. Pence will just be the new target. That's it.
@AlisonDunn13 @CNNPolitics Can you tell me why this would be a good thing? Why are people wanting failure? Why do people want America to look bad? Do you really think anything would change when it came to policy and your life if this happened? Really don't get it.
@DrYardSale @cato218 @CNNPolitics Think you might want to start thinking for yourself and not just being told what to believe.
@thehill But still miles away.
@KamalaHarris I hear they will only release 10 documents for every time you tweet this. We are up to a few hundred thousand documents by now. Keep it up!
@AnitaNelson @mdsharpe2 @HouseJudDems @TheObamanista @RepGoodlatte @RepJerryNadler @RepSwalwell @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepCohen @davidcicilline @RepJeffries @RepZoeLofgren @RepRaskin @RepHankJohnson @RepGutierrez #fascist
@HouseJudDems @RepGoodlatte @RepJerryNadler @RepSwalwell @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepCohen @davidcicilline @RepJeffries @RepZoeLofgren @RepRaskin @RepHankJohnson @RepGutierrez Urge all you want. You know it's a waste of time.
@MaddowBlog Media hate, rhetoric, and manipulation is going on overdrive tonight. People believe this garbage?
@GrantonGranton @ChrisMurphyCT Turn off the news and stop following politics. That's really your answer to happiness.
@brettaronow @TPAMonet @ChrisMurphyCT @WhiteHouse Good luck with that. You all are just as crazy who thought Obama was a traitor and corrupt and needed to be impeached in order to restore America. 		Do you remember thinking how stupid those people sound?
@LOLGOP @cheryl42058 @SenatorLeahy He is being considered as a Supreme Court Judge. His RULINGS is all that matters.		Wasn't water boarding legal at that time? I really don't know. I just know it was before.
@LOLGOP @cheryl42058 @SenatorLeahy The public has access to his thousands of public cases he has made a ruling on. This is what matters. Fact is his record for actual rulings isnt bad so that's why they are playing this document game.
@neiman_rockford @FoxNews @POTUS But but Mueller will be the new but her emails next year.
@CNNPolitics That's kind of their job. The VP always remains out of the spotlight.
So my account just got locked because I was suspected of being a bot right when I posted this story in a comment on CNN's account. Very odd coincidence I guess. Never had this happen to me before. Just a quick verify to unlock, but how did I get triggered?	https://t.co/jh2U70ig65
@thehill Oh no!!! Wait. What does this mean?
@CNNPolitics https://t.co/jh2U70ig65
@thehill MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY MAY #journalism
@thehill AKA they got a high paid offer somewhere else to make a political statement.
@TheDemocrats Where is it stated in the Constitution does it say this?
@thehill COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD COULD #journalism
@thehill So when he's paid off other woman over the decades was that also part of influencing the election?
@RepRickLarsen What's your solution?
@RepAlGreen No party will get enough senate votes for impeachment. If that's your goal then you are crazy.
@EAKoyle @MrsDrStupid @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump I get it. You have #TrumpDerangementSyndrome. Don't need to keep telling me.
@jayteepee @dino4dino @NicoleVedEnvy @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr During the campaign he said he won't release his tax returns due to them being audited.		This made people not trust him and vote against him.
@KamalaHarris You made a post without saying woman or mention of a race. Impressed.
@Gmax6and1 @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr Not a game.		All of his rulings (which is what matters) are public record. If you want to know how he rules. Go look those up.
@l95837552 @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr No need to #cyberbully. I will wait for the evidence to present itself and if he is guilty, he is. Personally, I don't care. The POTUS really isn't that important to me.		Until then, innocent until proven guilty.
@Mickster591 @KayeBlack19 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I haven't insulted anyone here. You did. It's OK to admit it. Just learn from your mistakes and move forward.		#depression and #suicide rates are skyrocketing. You don't know who you are talking to online. You could be the reason they get pushed over the edge. Do you want that?
@CNN Please don't interview children and families when they are still recovering from the hurricane this time CNN.
@ABC How can we pin this on Trump though?
@seagirl50 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr If every voter felt like me we would have problems too. I think what makes government "work" is a bunch of different views all working towards a common goal. If it's not important enough, then it's gridlocked and nothing happens. Only what truly matters gets done.
@DeepPopQ @bozoandfriends @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr He may. He may not.		I'll wait until it's shown to make up my mind. Innocent until proven guilty.
@seagirl50 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Innocent until proven guilty for everyone, like I just said. Think that explains my stance.
@Mickster591 @KayeBlack19 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Rather be strange than a #cyberbully.
@DeepPopQ @bozoandfriends @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr Based on Cohens word which obviously is tainted. 		They will need to prove trump FORCED Cohen to break campaign finance laws with physical evidence. Good luck with that.
@seagirl50 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I am not a Republican or a Democrat.		I believe innocent until proven guilty for everyone. I despise how the MSM and Social Media condemn people based on no facts, evidence, or a fair trial.		Politics is just a smear campaign now. I don't believe any of it until proven guilty.
@EAKoyle @MrsDrStupid @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Sure he is. First step of recovery is admitting it.
@l95837552 @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr He needs to prove that Trump FORCED him to break campaign finance laws. Good luck with that.
@Mickster591 @KayeBlack19 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Got ourselves a #cyberbully here!
@thehill Hard hitting #journalism here!
@JimHatch_WV @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Until then.......... Innocent until proven guilty.		This is my only point and I am confused on why so many people want to argue that.
@CleDonnelly @jayteepee @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Trump has never said he is above the law. You just made that up.
@jroussiii @AMpatriot2016 @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Trump has a long history of paying women hush money, right? This is business as usual and I'm sure this will be their defense if it ever get's that far, which I doubt it will.		Since it's business as usual it was a personal issue and nothing to do with the campaign.
@jroussiii @AMpatriot2016 @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr He just needs to prove that Trump forced him to do it now which will required physical evidence because Cohen's word is now completely shot.
@EAKoyle @MrsDrStupid @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Ok. You aren't a US Citizen. I get it. Just assumed you were from the US. My bad.
@DeepPopQ @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr This judge has made thousands of rulings. This is public information. What matters is how he rules. 		The document crap is just a political stunt to smear him. They know they aren't able to provide all of them. It's dirty politics.		See his court rulings if you want to know him.
@CleDonnelly @jayteepee @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Yes? I think they are all liars.		This does not change the fact that a person is innocent until proven guilty. It's not a tough concept. If Trump is impeached, then indicted, then found guilty, he is guilty. Until then, he is innocent. This is how it works. Like it or not.
@LBaptisia @CNN @CNNOpinion It's an opinion piece. It's not supposed to be proof of anything. It's an opinion.
@EAKoyle @MrsDrStupid @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump You can say it all you want. Doesn't make it true. It's just your opinion.
@SleepyBrownDog @CNN @CNNOpinion Can you #cyberbully?
@ClayTravis @benshapiro I don't watch @benshapiro to here him talk about sports (does anyone?). Sorry, but will have to skip this week.
@CleDonnelly @jayteepee @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr My point is "innocent until proven guilty". Are you disagreeing with this?		I am not defending anyone. I am defending the legal system. You do not say someone is a criminal until they are proven guilty in a court of law. That's it. That's my argument.
@dino4dino @jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr When he said he wont release them while he was a candidate. People hated that, obviously, and didn't vote for him.
@RobyDianaroby02 @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr You can call yourself a #CyberBully.
@dino4dino @jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr He lost votes based on that lie also. Probably more than he gained. So what?
@jroussiii @AMpatriot2016 @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I don't understand your difficulty.		Cohen broke laws. Cohen is in trouble. That's where this story ends unless he is able to provide physical evidence that Trump FORCED him to do it.
@dino4dino @eb_recordings @CleDonnelly @jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr If you are a US Citizen, Donald Trump is your President. There is nothing you can say or feel that changes this.
@CleDonnelly @jayteepee @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Or he is trying to cover his ass and the other 20 times he said Trump had nothing to do with it is the truth.		Either way he is now a proven liar and his word means nothing without physical evidence.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Got proof or just spreading #hate and #fear? This is why you are called #fakenews.
@dino4dino @eb_recordings @CleDonnelly @jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr No need to #cyberbully people because you disagree with their opinions.
@MrsDrStupid @EAKoyle @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump I only said. "Innocent until proven guilty".		That is law. That is fact. That is American. Are you disagreeing with this fact as being fake?
@GeneralCringe @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr There used to be almost no vetting for Supreme Court nominees. Presidents even actually nominated across the isle! It's only since the 80's it has been politicized.		Fact is almost every judge nominated will do a good job. The other side will just tell you they won't now.
@eb_recordings @CleDonnelly @jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @dino4dino @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Apparently a lot of people knew it would be good also.
@jroussiii @AMpatriot2016 @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Cohen broke campaign finance laws. Don't think anyone is doubting that. Cohen isn't part of the government.
@jayteepee @NicoleVedEnvy @dino4dino @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Yes. All politicians lie. Nothing new.
@NicoleVedEnvy @bozoandfriends @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump You are a #CyberBully.
@grownboyee @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr There is no evidence that suggests what you said #CyberBully.
@the_real_crank @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr Fee pass? This ridiculous vetting has only started in recent years. Before it was just another judge. Presidents nominated across the isle before. Politicizing the Supreme Court was a huge no no.		So I'd say. I don't give a shit. Let's go back to the way it used to be.
@grownboyee @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr That's an opinion. Not a fact. Plenty of people believe the exact opposite.		Fact is, no party wants to destroy the system of government. But both sides will tell you the other side does. It's up to you to trust them or not.
@BrightBartNews @Mickster591 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr #CyberBully.
@TrumpGoAway @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Innocent until proven guilty.
@HalloranMeg @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Sorry. Was just assuming you were a US citizen. My bad.
@dino4dino @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Then you know I'm an independent and hate the media. Congrats.		I hated fox when they went full retard on Obama. Now it's the left that is going wacko.
@vandevil555 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Still no Trump.
@vandevil555 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Didn't see trumps name on there. Did I miss it?
@dino4dino @CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr You say that like an insult but all you did is make a strawman argument.
@DavisComer @seagirl50 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I know he is innocent until proven guilty. That's my only point.
@Seanzilla42 @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr What documents are hell bent on seeing before the hearings? Be specific now.
@CleDonnelly @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Cohen could say the aliens are responsible also. That doesn't make it fact.		He's also said under oath multiple times trump had nothing to do with it. Why do you believe this time and not the other?
@m_willi2 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Show me where he said this #CyberBully.
@apoxalyps1 @digdougdogman @thehill You had a chance to prove me wrong. But instead you chose to prove you are a #CyberBully.
@apoxalyps1 @digdougdogman @thehill Show proof. Not feelings.
@OralRCarter @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr My bad. I just assumed you were a US Citizen.
@cowellp @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I agree. If there is enough evidence, and he has been impeached, then let it go to trial.
@WilliamJWyckoff @Indianafortrump @eb_recordings @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Trump has a long history of paying hush money to women, right? So this can easily be considered business as usual, not connected to the campaign.		Agree with his behavior or not. This will be the defense it it ever gets that far, and frankly it will most likely work.
@eb_recordings @We_R_Network @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Exactly what they think of the far left (you) . Who's right? I think both of you.
@m_willi2 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr He absolutely did  not say he forced Cohen to break campaign finance laws.
@eb_recordings @whatsright0 @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr That's exactly what they say about the far left. Question is who is right. Answer is both.
@spdean3 @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I watch all news sources so I can make an informed decision.
@Mickster591 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I'm not a Republican. It's still an opinion. Not a fact. That's my only point.
@INBrownsFan You had a chance to prove me wrong and you chose #cyberbullying instead.
@wiseman_rhonda @EAKoyle @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Wait! I have one more thing to say.
@taliesinwho @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr #cyberbully
@JimHatch_WV @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Opinions don't equal facts.
@Rayeyar1 @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr All I am saying is innocent until proven guilty. Show me and I'll agree. I really don't care who is President.
@eb_recordings @We_R_Network @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Zero on your President.
@wiseman_rhonda @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr And you are a @cyberbully.
@whatsright0 @GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr Or just don't politicize the Supreme Court. 		The proof is in his ruling which are public information. That is how he ruled.
@TimothyStuckey6 @We_R_Network @eb_recordings @SenateMajLdr #cyberbully
@gschep @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Cohen has stated more times that he did all the payments himself. Why do you believe him now?
@neutral_milk83 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr False. Innocent UNTIL proven guilty.
@whatsright0 @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I don't think you will be happy when this all plays out.
@cindyann1228 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Ok. You aren't a US Citizen then. Hard to tell where people live on Twitter. My bad.
@AcadiaChick @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Impeachment has to come first.
@eb_recordings @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr #CyberBully. Show me the evidence then.
@Rayeyar1 @TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr There is zero evidence that has been presented that shows Trump made Cohen break the law.
@eb_recordings @TheRoseWaterFDN @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Cohen broke the law, yes.
@seagirl50 @EAKoyle @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump By me saying a person is innocent until proven guilty???? Show me where that is false.
@lynnhailey1 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Ok. Well you aren't a US Citizen. My bad.
@seagirl50 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Sorry you believe this. I'd stop listening to these people that tell you these things.		If it were true, he wouldn't be in the Oval Office right now.
@rchapman2341 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Innocent until proven guilty!! Yes I can. 		You are a criminal. Boom, guilty. I said so.
@TheRoseWaterFDN @eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Retired Chief.		The evidence has not been shown or presented. Unless you are the only person that knows about it.
@jaust39 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Luckily we just don't go on feelings.
@AggieJack4 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I agree. Not guilty yet. He could be one day. Or could not be.		Right now, he is not a criminal.
@Mickster591 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr That's 100% opinion. Hope you know the difference between that and facts.
@Wth3Y @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr I am a hypocrite? I've never mention anything about anyone else. I'm not a Republican. You just assumed. But you are in fact a #cyberbully.
@fedup551 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Still your President.
@EAKoyle @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump I sometimes wonder if people truly believe the crap they post.		You are a victim of political rhetoric and media manipulation. Hope you realize this someday.
@TheeTempest @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Then you aren't a US Citizen. Got it.
@eb_recordings @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr If Cohen said that YOU were involved too would you automatically be guilty and going to prison? That's not how the law works.
@DawnMorey2 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Where does this deep hatred come from? Don't tell me, I know.		The media and politicians have been telling you to hate this person for the last 2 years. That's it. Walks like a sheep.
@jaust39 @TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Some things you have to prove in a court of law. Like being labeled a criminal.
@TimothyStuckey6 @CJelz1854 @SenateMajLdr I'm not a Republican or Democrat. I just understand basic law I guess. Innocent until proven guilty no matter how many lol's they received on Twitter.
@GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr What documents are you specifically looking for?
@TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Laughing on Twitter doesn't change the fact Donald Trump is your President.
@GrFernandes75 @SenateMajLdr The Senators get to ask him questions directly. Why do they need these documents anyway? Because the media and politicians keep telling you they do?
@TimothyStuckey6 @SenateMajLdr Innocent until proven guilty is still a thing in the US if you like it or not. He is not a criminal. He is your President.
@TomPerez Health care is NOT a right. I'd love for everyone to have it and live for 100+ years. But it's NOT a right.
@RepJimmyGomez @BetsyDeVosED @usedgov Federal Government should have nothing to do with local schools. It's a local issue. Fix it yourself.
@NBCNews My poll that I don't need to conduct finds 98% of the population don't understand the complexity of tariffs so their opinion is mute. (me included)
@NBCNews Dark money to a black PAC. Is that ironic or racists? Can't tell.
@CongBoyle Shouldn't be begging the federal government for anything. Start in the city and state if you have complaints.
@digdougdogman @thehill What racist attacks?
@thehill Yes. That's how it works. That's why Obama lost the house and senate.
@RepDonBeyer Can you tweet something else besides Trump and Russia? Maybe focus on what you were elected to do. Hint: it's to solve problems, not just list them out cause #hate, #fear, and #divide.
@impeachdtnow @RepAlGreen @democracynow What harm has he caused again?
@SenKamalaHarris #racebaiting
@CNN Good job liberals. You got played. Again. By another anti Trump book that doesn't deliver.
@rocky_styles @thehill We aren't. The liberal media with an agenda is.
@RepSwalwell @LacyClayMO1 @SpeakerRyan Well you and the media create these "scandals" so it's fitting everyone come to you who whine about them.
@RepSpeier Well it isn't. If only we had a system we would elect people to make new laws that the majority of the population agree with, then we could get your idea to an actual law! Until then, you are just whining on Twitter.
@thehill Great. Now prove it. Kind of hard to believe someone who has just admitted to lying to a lot of people.
@Jimmer510 @thehill 01001110 01101111 01110100 00100000 01000111 01110101 01101001 01101100 01110100 01111001 00100000 01011001 01100101 01110100 00100001
@Jimmer510 @thehill Almost starting to believe you. Possibly 83 more times.
@Jimmer510 @thehill Capital letters and exclamation marks won't make this true or send him to prison. He may very well be guilty in the future, today, he isn't.
@ProbertSue @JeffFlake @sirDukeDevin Constitution says other wise.
@JeffFlake I'm sure you are aware of paperwork that is required to revoke clearances. Do you think under justification is said "he said mean things". No, I'm sure there was a reason and your bill won't protect against that. #grandstanding
@Jimmer510 @thehill Guilty verdicts come from a Jury or Judge. Not tweeters.
@Jimmer510 @thehill Pretty sure the answer is zero right now. Innocent until proven guilty is still a thing in the US.
@ArthurManfredK @MsDixieDiva8253 @MaddowBlog There's a process here. First Congress would have to impeach him and then he can be indicted. So it's not like he can't, but FIRST Congress needs to impeach.
@TheDemocrats I had tax breaks also and I'm not rich. I will remember too! But I won't be voting Republican for other reasons.
@BrownieUNC @thehill You would need the POTUS to nominate someone. Don't think he would.
@thehill So? You called for everyone to vote no also. Nothings changed. You have no power here.
@WhyAsk65 @SenDuckworth Bad Cohen!
@m8nkey2chm00n @thehill Nothing amazes me anymore with the media. While I do think what he did is disgusting on a personal level, I don't believe he broke any laws. The media should just report the facts without opinions.		He has already been tried, convicted, and sent to prison according to the left.
@thehill Maybe because they were personal payments and not campaign payments?
@brianschatz Takes a hurricane for you to talk about something besides Trump and Russia. Cool!		Be safe though!
@RepBobbyRush Try something else besides just pushing #fear on people. You do realize Americans are suffering from #depression and #suicide at a high increase, right? Why be part of the problem? Start pushing positive only messages.
@WhyAsk65 @SenDuckworth Cohen made the payment through himself which led to him breaking the campaign finance laws.
@WhyAsk65 @SenDuckworth Trump has never admitted to forcing Cohen to break campaign finance laws. Trump was aware of the payment. We know this by the tape. It doesn't say how Cohen was making the payment. The payment (if paid by Trump) hasn't even been clarified if it breaks FEC laws. Doubt it does
@theretheirthere @thehill Maybe you should read my original comment. I am only arguing he is innocent until proven guilty. If you agree, then we wasted time.
@WhyAsk65 @SenDuckworth So? She just condemned someone of a crime he hasn't been proven guilty of.		I'm retired military, does that mean I can never be un-American? No.
@theretheirthere @thehill Google innocent until proven guilty.		If Cohen said YOU were involved at his plea would you automatically be guilty?
@Pamelastonenyc @RodgerHostettl2 @SenDuckworth @realDonaldTrump You can say it all you want. But until proven guilty in a court of law, he is not.
@ElleDiablo666 @BillsMafia21 @benshapiro It doesn't make me feel better. Not sure why you would think that.
@RodgerHostettl2 @SenDuckworth Innocent until PROVEN guilty. It's a fairly standard saying.
@SenDuckworth It is sad. Innocent until proven guilty.		It's sad you don't follow this concept. Very unamerican if I might say.
@theretheirthere @thehill Not when it comes to Trump.		Cohen broke the campaign finance laws because of the amount given. This charge is on Cohen. He broke it.		I think you are going to be seriously disappointed on how this will turn out.
@theretheirthere @thehill I'm missing the part where trump directed Cohen to break campaign finance laws. This hasn't even been determined to be breaking campaign finance laws yet.
@theretheirthere @thehill Cohen admitted yes. Not Trump.		I'm not talking about Cohen.
@SenMarkey Wish I had the option to state "I will not do my job" and people loved me for it.
@theretheirthere @thehill Sure do. Innocent until proven guilty. That's still a thing, right?
@ElleDiablo666 @BillsMafia21 @benshapiro Well sure. Obamas was an actual campaign finance law that was broken and fined.		Trumps most likely won't be and nothing will happen.
@ElleDiablo666 @BillsMafia21 @benshapiro Or if you want something more recent and related. (tolerated) 		https://t.co/rCA8dZIswF
@ElleDiablo666 @BillsMafia21 @benshapiro We had presidents who were racist slave owners and verified pedophile rapist. Thomas Jefferson.		Pretty sure we tolerated a ton worse.
@cherylhart00 @G99Greg @FoxNews @AlanDersh Knew about the payment, yes. Directed Cohen to break federal laws, no. Need proof still on the claim.
@G99Greg @FoxNews @AlanDersh No. All it proves is Cohen is. He still needs to provide proof trump knew about it all. Right now you are just believing a person who just admitted he is a liar.
@NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump So you believe Cohen now because he says what you like?		Problem is he needs to prove it still and that just became pretty difficult since he just admitted to lying. Unless he has physical evidence, his word will not go far.
@MSNBC @maddow All you need to do is prove it. Doesn't look legit when you go on the news to say it. Just turn over this evidence if it exists.
@NBCPolitics Coming from a corrupt AG. Nice source NBC. Real trustworthy.
@theretheirthere @thehill If he documented his claim that Trump directed him to break campaign finance laws then he did. But until he provides proof of his claim it's really hard to believe coming from someone who just admitted to lying and his ass is on the line. I'll still wait for proof.
@KamalaHarris It doesn't. Stop telling people it does. Tired of your #racebaiting and tearing down minorities. You should be uplifting. "You can accomplish anything you put your mind to!". Not tell them they are victims.
@thehill Yet the left are believing every word right now this guy says. Odd.
@RonBrownstein @USATODAY Well the problem still lies with having to prove it and Cohen isn't just pushing blame. This just became increasingly difficult for anyone just to take his word for after taking a plea deal and being confirmed a liar. Time will tell.
@TomMcInerneySA Has he commented on anything? So glad he's out there doing the IRS's job! Get those tax evaders!
@ShimonPro @Acosta All he needs to do is prove it now. Which just became increasingly difficult pleading guilty and admitting to being a liar. This will be interesting.
@politico Now all he has to do is prove it. Going to be a little difficult now that you just admitted you are a liar.
@realDailyWire She's already sold her book. Now the jokes on these fools.
@AP Didn't the tape we already heard prove this? Can someone explain why this is apparently new?
@BillsMafia21 @benshapiro Campaign finance laws usually are just paying a little fine. Not removing the person from office.
@chrislhayes Admist what? As far as I remember Trump was voted POTUS in 2016. Nothing has changed.
@BillsMafia21 @benshapiro Trump isn't going anywhere.
@washingtonpost Only because they want to keep their meal ticket. It's not hard to figure out.
@SenJeffMerkley @Morning_Joe You haven't even had the hearing or asked him questions. Why is your mind already made up? If you are going to vote no, then do it. There's no need to pressure other people with your opinions now. That's not what you were elected to do.
@washingtonpost Child abuse from the parents. Ya, I said it.
@CBSNews Let's politicize the children, that will show them we really care!		This is disgusting and any news channel or journalist that doesn't cover this in a negative way is complicit. You are part of the problem if you continue to let people do this to children.
@CNNPolitics I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think. I Think.  #journalism
@realDailyWire Just let them destroy each other I guess. Same with Republicans too. Really don't care.
@thehill I didn't take it the way you all want to take it. He was talking about being nervous and talking to a crowd. Nothing to do with race you bunch of #racebaiters.
@kikirusty @RepAndyBiggsAZ Thomas Jefferson was a racists slave owner and a pedophile rapist. His politics were dirtier than present day. 		Compared to him the GOP is pretty damn amazing.
@RepBrendanBoyle @RepKevinBoyle @HRC @EqualityPA Hate crimes should never exist. Crime is crime. Hate is hate. Murder is murder. Assault is assault.		There should not be more punishment for attacking certain individuals over others. Equal opportunity.
@PattyMurray Who is attacking Roe? Seems the left is the only one talking about it or care about it.
@sameritech @SenWarren Think real hard about this. Why aren't most people charged with a crime and thrown in jail?
@CNNPolitics But I do agree, not all the picks are great. Just not all of them are crap either. Just like every administration.
@CNNPolitics I don't think he could have picked better 2 people than Kelly &amp; Mattis off the top of my head.
@FoxNews @ChelseaClinton Like councilman or something? Maybe city treasure of a place I never need to visit? Or school board? Just don't do anything federal.
@washingtonpost This is why you are called fake news.
@divineem @CityDwellr @macsloth Well you use it incorrectly. There is zero chance anyone will be convicted of treason.
@opey02 @sgsteitler @Natalie_Page @CNNPolitics False. He has zero need to know. He has no reason to access or discuss classified information.
@THP1640 @JuddLegum #CyberBullying
@sgsteitler @Natalie_Page @CNNPolitics But why does he need it? He isn't in a job that allows him to need one or to even discuss classified information.
@SpecialEDxx @thehill Close. Must be trumps fault is what they are going with.
@AP If trump was pope you would be reporting how long it took to condemn and obviously how he must support it since it took this long.
@KasieDC He's just riding the anti Trump train. All I've seen is him talking about trump and Russia.		He was elected to manage legislation. Is he even doing this or just tweeting at the POTUS?
@CNN So stop pushing these stories and creating copy cats as much.
@marinafang Or less focus on color of peoples skin would be cool too.
@perikson @NYTimesPR @nytmike @maggieNYT If you think one side is good and the other is bad then you are a victim of political rhetoric and media manipulation. This statement is fact for both sides.
@TerrySlack @NYTimesPR @nytmike @maggieNYT We have a president who also gets bullied 24/7. Do you support that?
@Christi60688648 @NYTimesPR @nytmike @maggieNYT What do you think everyone is trying to do to trump? Destroy his credibility. Really should recognize this goes both ways.
@divineem @CityDwellr @macsloth You should learn what treason means then.
@HuffPost Stop giving these race baiting, country dividers a voice. They are toxic.
@Compos_mentis01 @tiredAmerican16 @thehill #cyberbully
@Compos_mentis01 @thehill I just don't agree the government should make life choices for people. It's not their job or their purpose.		But at the same time I would wish for sugary drinks, cigarettes, alcohol, corn syrup, and most processed foods to be banned.		Guess I'm conflicted.
@Compos_mentis01 @thehill Health wise I 100% agree. Wish sugary drinks product would go away for ever.		But this is non American. We have freedom to fill our bodies with poison and kill yourself if we want to.
@RoKhanna Why weren't the dead trees removed if they are a fire hazard?
@Lhrt311 @CNNPolitics You are a #cyberbully.
@FoxNews I thought when they go low, we go high.
@thehill #journalism
@thehill A little over dramatic, eh? But she is a paid clown so I guess it's fitting. Dance for me clown! Entertain me.
@TheDemocrats Then fix your laws. Get of Twitter and do your job.
@finneyk Anyone got a receipt so we can check the dates?
@PeterGleick @JaredHuffman I thought California was leading the fight with climate change? Why is it effecting them so much but not so much in other places?
@RepJayapal Didn't you vote for the budget?
@PattyMurray You know you get to ask questions directly to him, right? What else do you need?
@RepJayapal Daily dose of #fear and #hate to keep your voters #depressed so they will #VoteBlue!
@washingtonpost Why is everything printed in blue?
@thehill May not. #journalism
@ChristyNunn1 @CNNPolitics I understand the context on why Obama said it. I don't think the word should be used by anyone, for any reason. Trump has only been accused of saying the word and no clue what context. What if Trump used it in the same context as Obama? What if he didn't say it at all?
@ChristyNunn1 @CNNPolitics Yes. I've watched the podcast also. What's your point?
@Alexandriabro5 @SenSanders If this were true, he would be POTUS right now.
@realDailyWire Watch Liberals think she is trustworthy and a good person now.
@ChristyNunn1 @CNNPolitics Obama said it. Trump allegedly said it, and you have no idea what context if it is true.
@Mike_Lowry19 @CNNPolitics Easy search on YouTube.		https://t.co/Sg647pA36D
@thehill COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. COULD. 		Also Could not. #journalism
@CNNPolitics Obama used it while in office. Where's the outrage?
@thehill Why do all political articles contain, could, should, may, etc. Let's just report facts instead of attempting to create the news.
@Alexandriabro5 @SenSanders No. I'd like Congressman to focus on legislation and not just political rhetoric. They don't get paid to push their ideas to the people and tear apart others. They are the voice of the people. If the people think their ideas aren't worthwhile. Move on. His ideas aren't mainstream
@RoKhanna Cut back on government, regulations, and taxes then.
@RepJeffries Your job is to manage legislation for the American people. Not just insult people on Twitter. Focus on your job.
@brianschatz This would never happen so why discuss it? Unless congress and senate are agreeing.
@Alexandriabro5 @SenSanders How is that good? What's the purpose of a broken record?		His job is to work on legislation not just whine in twitter all day long. Free this. Free that. Will never happen. It's empty promises and a waste of time.
@SenSanders This is how Bernie works.		Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat. Same message. Repeat.
@ccarroll1000 @thehill False.
@kabyber @HoneTweeter @thehill #CyberBully
@thehill I believe the media does.
@connorobrienNH I'm sure Trump will too. But that really doesn't mean much.
@politico This student should be talking to the school and city / state governments well before federal.
@HuffPost May. Could. Should. Might. Possibly.		These are all words a real news outlet should not be using if they want to be taken seriously.
@JewdyGold @maddow Another over paid actor who is preying on your emotions in exchange for ad revenue and votes. Not a real journalist.
@davidhogg111 @RepSwalwell Stop spreading so much #fear and #hate then. You're part of the problem.
@iamthematch @RepJayapal #CyberBully.
@cfreshsobrookln @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump If you believe one side is good and the other is bad then you have gone backwards.
@RepJayapal Will your bill solve the problem?
@Ksodeeya @oOoMellieoOo @DAWill26 @brianschatz I'm not Google. If you care about the abuse of children and families then you would go find this info yourself. But you don't. So you won't. You are just anti Trump.
@Ksodeeya @oOoMellieoOo @DAWill26 @brianschatz A meme does not change the fact Obama did this also and you think the American population is dumb.
@Ksodeeya @oOoMellieoOo @DAWill26 @brianschatz Oh please. It most certainly did happen. Along with sexual abuse, cages, and everything else. I don't think this is really up for argument. Pretty well documented.
@Ralph6110 @thehill Not sure that fits th definition of treason.
@thehill Obama did while he was president. Trump allegedly did prior to his election. 		What's the big deal?
@CNNPolitics Good. Finish this probe.
@Ksodeeya @oOoMellieoOo @DAWill26 @brianschatz So with your logic almost the entire population is dumb since this happened under Obama and Trump.
@oOoMellieoOo @DAWill26 @brianschatz I read it as he thinks Trump voters are dumb. But hey, I could be wrong since it's not very clear.
@DAWill26 @brianschatz So you can't defend @brianschatz comments so you deflect to Trump. I agree! Trump is a #cyberbully too! So what?		That has nothing to do with this person insulting an entire voting base right now. Do you support him?
@ideasoftheday @brianschatz I am. 		Guess you just assume I was a Republican and didn't have an argument about the conversation at hand so tried to change the subject.
@GussieLives It was rhetorical question. 		The answer is they have and never will be released because they don't exist. It's a smear campaign.
@brianschatz Nice. You are #cyberbullying Trump voters. Are you seriously an elected official and think you can talk to fellow Americans like this? Shameful.
@FoxNewsResearch I have no clue what this is or what it's important. To me it seems Obama did a great job downsizing the Government. Unless I'm reading this wrong.
@skorpyos @FoxNews @benshapiro She hasn't debated anyone or even face one semi hard question. Once she does she will be finished. That's why she only does interviews that throw balloon sized questions.		If she has a plan then she should be able to articulate to @benshapiro.
@indivisible_usa @narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul Trained professional? By reading her profile I'd assume more she is a patient in a mental hospital, not working there.
@indivisible_usa @narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul Her original claim was BS. Then after she realized it she moved the conversation to something else. Not me.
@indivisible_usa @narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul Most I'd assume. The majority of the first presidents were known racists, owned slaves, pedophiles, rapists, ect. Think that's worse than the current president by far.
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome. You have been diagnosed.
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul This has nothing to do with you diagnosing him as a dangerous psychopath. Every single president we have had you can list out items that are bad. That mean we only elect dangerous psychopaths?
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul I go off proof. Show me he has. If he hasn't in last 70 years, chances are he never will.
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul You would think a dangerous psychopath would have cause some serious harm in the 70 years.
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul You can't diagnose someone from watching the news. Any medical professional who diagnoses without at least talking to the person or running tests is wrong and they know it.
@RepTedDeutch You just bullied the @POTUS. You just called yourself weak.		#cyberbullying is not cool and shouldn't be allowed in any form.
@narceducator @debs5357 @SheriSpain @McFaul I agree he his a narcissist. Almost every politician is. 		But you claiming he is a dangerous psychopath is merely an opinion and you are not qualified to diagnose him with that.
@alicetweet No one has said the press is the enemy of the people except the fake news. What Trump has repeatedly said is the fake news is the enemy of the people. Which this proves his point.
@thehill Fake news. Enemy of the people.
@fantasypingpon1 @thehill Deflection. Yes, they do. You don't know what you are talking about.
@fantasypingpon1 @thehill YOU DON'T NEED A SECURITY CLEARANCE TO BE A MSNBC/NBC CONTRIBUTOR!		If he was sharing classified information with a news network he would be getting in huge trouble. Maybe that's why he lost his clearance.		Do yourself a favor and never discuss clearances again.
@fantasypingpon1 @thehill A consultant doesn't give classified information from their previous job. There is a need to know. You are read it and read out when you leave. Do you have any CLUE at all how security clearances work? You don't need to answer that, it's apparent you don't.
@rhonda_harbison @thehill Please educate me on the right way and not by positing memes.
@fantasypingpon1 @thehill My opinion is not a right wing talking point since I'm not a Republican. It's from someone who has had a high level clearance for 20 plus years and apparently understands how they work.		His current job requires a clearance? For what?
@RonaldKlain Bill Clinton united both parties and balanced a budget. Does that mean it's impossible for him to lie under oath?		Point is your logic is dumb. Many great men who have accomplished great things are also more than capable of breaking the law or doing immoral acts.
@cyaneyed7 @thehill Or a sign of people smearing him and that looks really bad on them.		First off the majority never do. The media just reports that should or might to get you mad.		Then the ones that do never get anywhere because they are baseless or just lies.
@thehill That silly. He currently doesn't hold a job that requires a government issued security clearance. Why does he want one?		If he goes into a job that requires one again he can reapply. Then when denied. He can peruse legal action and eventually will be told no.
@RobertoLago @JDiamond1 @Acosta @PressSec Let's talk about the omaba administration doing it too then. Let's not just appear to be anti Trump and actually care about the children and families that were involved in this mess over the last 5 years.
@thehill She sure does know how to use the media, manipulate never Trumpers, and most importantly, sell some books.
@blam_ms @McFaul People that have done great things are also capable of doing illegal things. Is this concept really hard to get?		Bill Clinton for example was an amazing president. He also had an affair, lied under oath, and was voted in congress to be impeached.
@debs5357 @narceducator @SheriSpain @McFaul People that are manipulated by media and politicians to the point they judge a human being like this shouldn't be allowed to tweet and spread even more lies.		If you honestly think all that's true then you have been manipulated by political rhetoric and smear campaigns. Congrats!
@m1db @thehill Don't you understand your solution is horrible? You don't want half the country represented? If you truly believe one side is good and the other is bad then I'd recommend stop following politics.
@Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump Criticism. Good one.
@CitizenWBailey Politicize your wife's cancer. That's disgusting and if I were your wife I'd be pissed at you.
@AllyVyne @NBCNews Same reason you are allowed to.
@TeamPelosi I'm not rich and I pay less taxes now. How's that a scam?
@rhondabannard @mkraju After the investigation is over what excuse will you use next?		Deep state? Corrupt DoJ?		Point is you will always have an excuse not to like Trump, right?
@ccarroll1000 @thehill What does a security clearance have to do with that?
@NBCNews @NBCSports The problem is NBC and others reporting this crap! Stop doing this media! You are trying to CREATE news and not report it.
@thehill Who says it's a punishment? The press? Himself? How do you know there isn't a legitimate reason?
@joncody98 @BuckSexton @BretBaier I don't remember Trump saying this either. He has said the FAKE NEWS is the enemy of the people. The fake news reports it as he is saying the FREE PRESS. Learn the difference.
@NBCNews Could have made it closer to Colorado Springs where more military lives.
@thehill Learned from @HillaryClinton  I guess.
@BernieSanders Someone needs to bump the record player. Think it's skipping.
@mrnickadams27 @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller So by sharing an embarrassing photo you are essentially just being a #cyberbully. Cool!
@KCStarOpinion His war is against fake news, not the free press. This is fake news.
@KamalaHarris Why did you vote for ACA then?
@thehill Just another #racebaiting news article of someone playing the #racecard.
@SenSanders The answer is LESS government in colleges, not more.
@Fremdschaemen76 @HNPSWA4 @thehill Or they found justification. But ya, let's just guess.
@HNPSWA4 @thehill How could this possibly effect free speech? That's ridiculous.
@TheHootyman @RepTedDeutch @fred_guttenberg No one wants these crappy EXPENSIVE plastic guns that don't shoot straight and breaks very easily. It's all just politics. 3d printed guns are worthless.
@AprilDRyan #racecard has been played. Maybe their are none because you keep calling trump Hitler and a racist.
@zeruch @brhodes That's why you see people attacking us all the time, right?
@brhodes Didn't you go from we working at a waffle house to the white house due to bring friends with Obama?
@revjwalker @jaketapper I don't need to backup my OPINION or BELIEF! Do you understand that?		Wow. You are just negative. Muted.
@revjwalker @jaketapper It's a combination of everything! The good the bad the whatever. Overall it's great.		I get it. You are a negative Nancy. Good night.
@revjwalker @jaketapper Everything! Now tell me again that's not the answer you want and demand I try again until you get the answer you want.
@revjwalker @jaketapper I love everything about it. I'm not the one hating on it.
@revjwalker @jaketapper Wow. Are you even American? For how much you hate it your are welcome to get away from this shit hole. I think you need to visit some other countries and stop living on Wikipedia.
@revjwalker @jaketapper Would be worthwhile to include taxes, cost of living, etc. More than one country can include people in the top 1 percent of the world also. But you believe America isn't great so I guess it doesn't matter. It's an opinion and I can't change that.
@revjwalker @jaketapper Compared to the rest of the world, almost all US citizens are in the 1 percent. Sounds pretty great to me.
@mcbnelson @JohnBrennan @gabe0827 More voices? Are you kidding more? MORE?
@MWPalmer @robie_debbie @KamalaHarris @davidhogg111 Why not? Majority of people don't vote based off anything but feelings and what the media tells them to. Uneducated votes don't necessarily help the US.
@PattyMurray How can we forget? You remind us 10 times a day.
@BeboPJemm @donaldrickert @blumom2015 @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA OK. Good luck being racist and a cyberbully. Sure that will get you far bin life.
@KentuckyLefty @washingtonpost @notpeterstrzok He's a bad cop. Not sure why people support his behavior
@donaldrickert @BeboPJemm @blumom2015 @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA It's not Fake. It's someone who is obsessed with Trump.
@donaldrickert @BeboPJemm @blumom2015 @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA I said nothing that would be considered bullshit. You on the other hand attempted to anonymously insult me on the internet. Pretty sure that's the definition of a #CyberBully.
@SpecialEDxx @thehill Well he did get media attention from that. But it was all positive.
@jpost_politics Full quote for people that dont read passed the headline and fall victim to smear campaigns. 		“Looking back in history, unfortunately, Hitler was right about what was taking place in Germany. And who was behind it,”
@HuffPost Seth has a serious case of the #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome
What does the pee tape, Stormy Daniel's tapes, and n word tape all have in common?
@MommaTNYC @RepSwalwell All he does is complain about trump and Russia.
@RepMaxineWaters How many tweets have you sent about this vs how many bipartisan bills have you worked on to prevent this happening again. You don't care. Vote for me!
@thehill Not purposely. This is why you are called fake news.
@CasperCaz @BreitbartNews His only policy so far that I can see is bash trump and Russia.
@washingtonpost Yes. Nothing to do with race.
@AynRandPaulRyan Pee tapes. Stormy Daniel's tapes. Omarosa tapes.		All have one thing in common.
@ShanRox05 @aishatyler Obama has said it and he wasn't, so I guess that means its cool.
@nathanlonghair @aishatyler Hopefully kids are learning you need proof and not just allegations.
@DonalJMurphy @aishatyler Assumed the pee tape is true too, eh? #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome
@Pimienta33T @aishatyler Rather racist of you to say.
@Patparis01 @aishatyler And the pee tape.
@nose4rose @aishatyler @realDonaldTrump None was has ever been fired for an alleged recording. There's this thing we still proof.
@aishatyler Why wait until now to release it? You would think if it were true they would do it prior to the election. But instead let's wait for him to get elected and a few years of being president first, then we will get him! OK. #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome
@andmwill @RepWilson You think social security is going away? You do realize the left have been claiming this for decades to win votes. Decades.
@budarydachas @washingtonpost @notpeterstrzok #CyberBullying is cool.
@KentuckyLefty @washingtonpost @notpeterstrzok Ya. Because we support bad cops. Unless the beat black people.
@london_phil09 @washingtonpost @notpeterstrzok Is the left got or against bad cops? Can't seem to figure this one out.
@Alt_FedEmployee So many #racecards in one tweet.

@ChelseaClinton Let them choose. No one cares the gender any more but the left. They can play if they want to and are good enough.
@ImJonAbramson @randomlogician @realDailyWire Unlike the left. They were voted in because their mental condition. Haven't seen one main steam news article talking about policy or qualifications. Just what's between their legs.
@donaldrickert @BeboPJemm @blumom2015 @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA Another #CyberBully
@ezotic @jcp5820 @RepWilson @OMAROSA Their opinions differ than yours so you choose to #CyberBully them. Classy.
@RepWilson @OMAROSA #racecard has been played.
@RepCummings Haven't you called him a racist?
@thehill Prove it or just keep your mouth shut.
@nytimes The entire article is about being transgender! Nothing about qualifications or experience. Really?
@nytimes Who cares? Talk about their qualifications not what's in between her legs.
@DanRather Dan, I think you got a case of the #TrumpDerangementSyndrome. It's all you talk about.
@CBSNews Why are people so obsessed in reporting color of skin, gender, or sexual preference? If they are qualified then so be it.
@RepGwenMoore Would? Most of your colleagues are at least a little honest and use the word could. You are just going all into the #fearmongering, eh?
@realDailyWire @benshapiro There's no video or audio. She's selling books and doing a damn good job.
@clayaiken @OMAROSA She knows how to sell books and utilize the media. That's for sure.
@AprilDRyan Hey look, another #racecard has been played.
@LZagraniczny @SenKamalaHarris Same to the left.
@FenwayLuke @Hamr44 @sharnet62 @petestrzok He was so prepared for that question too. He was like, I don't know how or why that happened, some lawyers told me to, blah, blah.		This is the main link for actual ACTION of his bias.
@donaldrickert @blumom2015 @BeboPJemm @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA Really? He attacks everyone. So when they are a person of color it's racist but the other 1000 white people he insults isn't? Dumb.
@HerLaptop112 @CBSNews @OMAROSA Except for the fact she hasn't released any real information from her first book
@ChieverJason @BeboPJemm @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA Look at all those trump obsessed people.
@BeboPJemm @blumom2015 @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA Well you can say probably. I can say you are. You are a #CyberBully.
@thehill Shows she is selling a book and using the media trump hate to do it. Fools.
@blumom2015 @BeboPJemm @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA I don't support him. But he hasn't done or said anything I consider racist.
@bigrod6261 @CBSNews @OMAROSA That's rather racist of you to say.
@L52346096 @CBSNews @OMAROSA Everything you said has nothing to do with race or false. #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome
@HerLaptop112 @CBSNews @OMAROSA No. She is selling her book. That's it.
@LSkuwalker @RockyZieco @CBSNews @OMAROSA Or maybe none of them are? Everything doesn't always have to be one side or the other.
@BeboPJemm @998049cf112645c @CBSNews @OMAROSA You might be. But people without #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome still can think critically.
@draocht @MaddowBlog They were fired for breaking rules of the FBI, not due to #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome.
@marshawoo @MaddowBlog Testify what? They were fired by their own for breaking rules. You support a corrupt FBI or something?
@LoveUSNJ @MaddowBlog How would voting blue help this? The FBI is firing people that are bad. What's wrong with that? Don't trust the FBI? Believe in deep state?
@RepDwightEvans Low wages are for unskilled you workers and are required for some businesses to function. Promote learning new skills for a career instead of trying to get people to live on wages they were never intended to do that.
@jaketapper Finally getting some press. Now repost ever 10 minutes like Trump Russia stuff.
@agirlinBK @Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 I just can't follow this. Good luck.
@Swags_D17 @agirlinBK @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Logic is not on your side.
@Swags_D17 @sallywarden @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Fact is correct about personal insults? How can you be correct about that?
@sallywarden @Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 I don't care who called who names first. Fact is the both said nasty things about each other. Neither is innocent and hiding behind POW status is lame.
@agirlinBK @Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Most logical explanation is the someone running for president of the united states will mock a disabled person at a campaign rally knowing it will greatly decrease his chances of being elected?		That's your logic?
@sallywarden @Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 This POW war hero is allowed to call him names and not be the receiver? He is immune from name calling?
@Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Your fear from the media pushes you to hate Trump.
@agirlinBK @Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Some dates were before some were after. But you wouldn't care to look at that would you.
@Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 #TrumpDerangementSyndrome. Sound like a long CNN headline. Bye.
@Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 I know you are but what am I followed with personal insult. Cool bro!		I'm not trying to clear Trumps name. I did not vote for him or support him. I dislike the dishonest media and this is one of the smear campaigns that were ran.
@Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Of course you find it lacking. It's call confirmation bias. There is zero evidence that would change your mind. You hate Trump and would do or say anything to protect that belief.
@Swags_D17 @Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Are all these other people he did the same thing to disabled? You think a presidential nominee would knowingly do this? That's special.		https://t.co/1lKXf88yoC
@Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 So you believe all the other times he has done this same motion mocking other people that don't have disabilities, right? Point is he had no clue the guy was disabled. Is it cool to mock people, no. 		https://t.co/1lKXf88yoC
@Mr_JamesLandis @MarkSalter55 Oh, you still believe this story. Of course you do.
@MarkSalter55 #cyberbullying is cool.
@anxioudacity @RejectTheLies @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS So you are a deep state believer. Got it.
@boyndog @realDonaldTrump How do you get from tax fraud from someone to the POTUS getting fired?
@JTill247 @ToorahLoorrah @gmukunda @realDonaldTrump #CyberBully
@ACJJustice @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Hey there #CyberBully
@thehill Hate crime?
@RejectTheLies @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS GOP didn't fire him. The FBI did.
@gormanm @SeattleBern @realDonaldTrump Think you overdosed on CNN. What you said is false.
@RepYvetteClarke @JoyAnnReid @SethAbramson @sxsw Journalism in Trump age = Political Smear Campaign
@PepiSouthern @thehill Or new age of disrespectful media are getting what they deserve.
@RepJayapal I'm not rich and my wages aren't declining, by far.
@EmmyRNason @realDonaldTrump Most certainly did. While NBC is the one attacked the didn't have the balls to report it. Vox surprisingly did.		The other side (Antifa) is just as if not more disgusting. Would really look up what these people believe.		https://t.co/vXxMluasjx
@NancyPelosi @RepDwightEvans @RepMaxineWaters What does a vagina and skin color have to do with fear?
@firemnmike41 @SenSanders He condemn the counter protestors attacking cops and journalists last night. You want a president that doesn't speak against hate?
@SenSanders By attacking cops and journalists. Good job!
@TheDemocrats You side with attacking cops and journalists?
@K_JeanPierre Holy crap this is #racist and #sexist with a side of general #hate. Can't believe people think like this.
@jvfnyc @thehill I'm sure that excuse wouldn't hold up if she is charged.
@jvfnyc @thehill Some people are given trust. When broken they should be punished.
@ordinary_josh @Warmonger213 @NBCNews All 20 of them? You aren't serious are you?
@SenBlumenthal Tell your boys to stop attacking the police and journalists then. Or will you publicity condemn their actions last night?
@historBilia @SenSchumer No GOP is on the fence no matter how many times you say it.
@RepLloydDoggett Like attacking police and journalists last night in #Charlottesville? That kind of good trouble?
@thehill Hope she does some jail time. All to sell some books.
@cimarron_kid @ABC The protestors were attacking the police and journalists last night. In Charlottesville that is.
@ABC Police brace as antifa attacks them and journalists. Fixed your headline.
@historBilia @SenSchumer No GOP is on the fence. Democrats voted for him last time. He will be easier confirmed.
@sarahkendzior What crime that he's been found guilty of did he admit to obstruction?
@historBilia @Dr_Sammich @thehill Anything besides counter protestors fighting police and attacking journalists maybe?
@LisaZagozewski @thehill Well since they attack police and journalists last night I'd say there is no side of love out there today.
@SenSchumer You already voted opposed. Why do you care?
@LarryMcCammon #CyberBully much?
@oinonio @Mississippiluv2 @DeJuanABC11 Correction, Antifa attacks NBC Journalist last night.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@MCA420 Well apparently you can attack an NBC Journalist and they still won't report it.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@UmarHSoaries If the KKK renames themselfs to "good people with morals" would you call them that?		Here is Antifa at work last night attacking an NBC Journalist. This is the DEFINITION of #fascism		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@JennuhDordy @SamSeder Hope they don't attack her like they did an NBC Journalist last night.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@jomofo22 And the Police officer.		https://t.co/wJ1zor6oim
@jennygardiner @CalNBC Exactly! No one should have showed up. Let them do their little hate rally then go home. Attention is what they want. The media is sure giving it to them.
Here is them attacking a Police Officer last night. Where is the coverage and outrage? The "Nazis" aren't even there!! Or are they?		https://t.co/wJ1zor6oim
@nwfdailynews VIDEO: #Charlottesville, last night. Counter protesters attacking police officer.		https://t.co/wJ1zor6oim
@Willow_B_Well Here is another one from last night where they attacked a police officer.		https://t.co/wJ1zor6oim
@Willow_B_Well Maybe because they don't have a permit to go certain places and protest? 		Like last year there were 2 places authorized to protest. The counter protesters left their designated area and went to the rally.		It's following the law and trying to keep order.
@pattern_against @thehill Pretty sure he did yesterday, again. Maybe you are just refusing to read it?
@nwfdailynews VIDEO: #Charlottesville, last night. Counter protesters attacking journalist.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@newvision4youth Should have took a picture and posted it. More people would believe your story.
@Willow_B_Well Being harassed by who? They were the only ones there yesterday. Still are as far as I am aware.
@cvillestuff In case you want to know what attacking the free press really looks like. The "good guys" attacking an NBC Journalist last night.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
The "counter protesters" had weapons seized, attacked police, and attacked journalist last night. To include one from NBC. The lack of coverage from this is sickening. Anyone who supports either side on this is wrong.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
I think every single person in #Charlottesville is to blame. Left, right, and media. You are taking a situation that can be easily ignored and making it into a huge deal. Let these people do their little rally, give them no attention, and they will go home. Stop feeding hate.
@AFTunion There was only one side attacking journalist and police last night. Good job "counter protesters"!		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@jhale667 And fuck Antifa! Attacking the free press last night. Disgraceful.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@myHNN This may help you then. Attacking an NBC Journalist. Seems pretty Nazi like to me. This was last night when they were attacking cops also.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@CapeCannibal @ABC For people that won't believe you or search for themselves. This is an NBC journalist. 		https://t.co/e4DIkkOwDA
@Willow_B_Well I agree. I just think if the counter protestors and media stayed away then there would be no need for any of this. Let them do their rally, give them no attention, and they will go home sad that no one cares.
@TwoAddict There are was only one side last night and it was bad.		https://t.co/e4DIkkOwDA
@Gra8Googly Bad people attack journalists last night. This is the side that you apparently think is good. 		https://t.co/e4DIkkOwDA
@KarenELotter Here's another one of them assaulting an NBC journalist. 		https://t.co/e4DIkkOwDA
@czechra @CalNBC @MSNBC Exactly. Media and politicians are to blame for this.
@DwightEvansPA Do you am stand WITH attacking police and journalists like the counter protestors did last night? Might want to condemn them or it means you support them.
@EmmyRNason @realDonaldTrump Last night they had weapons confiscated, attack police, and attacked journalists. You think the counter protestor are innocent here?		There were zero nazis out yesterday.
@realDailyWire I still havent seen this on MSM? Has anyone?		Talk about thinking the press is the enemy of the people.
@TheLastWord Why? No matter who wins the election guns aren't going away.
@Willow_B_Well Here is the attack on an NBC journalist.		https://t.co/e4DIkkOwDA
@MidnightLantern They were also chanting all cops are racists and BLM. I really have no idea what these "counter protesters" believe or their purpose besides general hate.
@Willow_B_Well The counter protesters attacked them and terrorized the place. The same they did last night with no white supremacists even there. They attacked police and journalist.
@RepBarragan They sure were combating hate last night. Attacking police and journalist.		Are you saying you support this? You think the press is the enemy of the people? Why don't you condemn the actions LAST NIGHT by Antifa and the "counter protesters"?
@Altibalba @kylegriffin1 They're not Anit-Fascist they are the #fascist. Don't use their acceptable terminology.
@KenFarnaso Many of those who will be at the march today in Washington DC will be claiming to do so under the veil of their 'anti facism' 		That is the furthest thing from the truth. They are the fascists. Fascism is evil. Pray for our city.
@washingtonpost Will you report the left attacking journalist? Maybe they think they are the enemy of the people as well.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@TevinJDavis1 I believe you didn't read it correctly then.
@Kathyshappier Absolutely not.		I hold everyone that is showing up there including the media responsible for what happens. There is no good side to this.
@RobC351a The one person is the main reason for the murder.		The police not separating the two hate groups is the next reason.		The left being there in the first place would be my third reason.
@ZekeTheFreak67 @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't NBC report their journalist was attacked last night by Antifa?		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@BadKujo @cnnbrk Seems like they think the press is the enemy of the people too. Attacking an NBC journalist.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@the_klarson @RealJack And attack NBC journalist.		https://t.co/Oi2csnpa97
@RefuseFascism Say no to Antifa also while you're there for me.
@Smallchic You're reading too much into this.
@nitrevino Just don't be violent like Antifa.
@RepHankJohnson As long as you are talking about Antifa also, I'm with you!
@DavidStoreytv Thanks to the media and politicians, yes.
@RichardViguerie @dbongino Protection of voters.		That's all it really is.
@rgrierx And they didn't move to prevent the groups from fighting. Disgrace.
@MidnightLantern These are the counter protesters known as Antifa.		This is not the white supremacist group. Well I guess that depends on who you ask.
@mc81331 @POLITICOMag The left has embraced the hate group Antifa.
@LarryMcCammon One side is hateful racist.	One side is hateful fascists.		Either way. Both sides that are there today are wrong.
@marytny Trump only did this AGAIN yesterday. Do you not have access to what he is saying?
@atalknut Ya because last year they screwed that all up.
@PsychBarakat @realDonaldTrump I think he is correct. I don't support hate on either side.
@ali @jaketapper Ya I am not sure why the left is supporting Antifa. It's just very odd to me.
@AltRtGamer There was only 1 individual responsible for the death.		If I were forced to name a side that was the most responsible, I would say it was the police for allowing the two groups to fight.
@nonobodyanyone @thehill Yes I have and no I don't read his tweets that way.		Could you link to a few that you believe are advocating racism?
@thehill As the left calls it, #journalism.
@Oh_MellNawww @thehill Yes. I am. It's time we get passed this BS.
@thehill Why would this even come up? People need to stop worrying about the color of peoples skin.
@GeorgeJ90295415 @thehill Pretty sure they don't mean that are just full of hate.		I don't support hate from the left, the right, or the minority of cops that abuse their power. All in all this is a small group of people compared to the larger majority. 		I don't know why we all just can condemn them all.
@1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump This very second they are.		https://t.co/5UlG2hLze5
@washingtonpost We can guarantee one thing from Saturday. Only one side showed up, had weapons taken from them, and were full of hate.
@GeorgeJ90295415 @thehill You think Antifa is the good guys? They are chanting all cops are racists right now and doing BS like this.		https://t.co/5UlG2hLze5
@JoeHeim @washingtonpost @phscoop @Marissa_Jae @TheArtist_MBS @aolivo @martinepowers @PerryStein @teoarmus @ReisThebault @PeteJamison @hannah_natanson @terrence_mccoy Here is how Antifa treats reporters there right now.		https://t.co/5UlG2hLze5
@CNNPolitics How they wear blank bandannas over their faces.
@SenJackReed But Antifa is cool, am I right?		Your words mean nothing if you only speak out against one side of the hate group. Do you know what they are marching and chanting right now? ALL COPS ARE RASCISTS!		You support that shit?
@Turpster59 @patrice_noonan @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics Sue Turpin is a #CyberBully and thinks anyone with a different opinion could not possibly be a human. I'm not a Trump supporter.
@CNN Is this a paid advertisement?
@JayThomasKirby @moreliberty4u @AP_Politics @AP I hope you truly don't believe this. Antifa is just as bad as the proud men or whatever they like to call themselves.		If you support antifa, you are supporting fascism. Please do you research on this group if you don't want to be associated with a hate group.
@mickeyseeker6 @AP_Politics @AP The police, by not keeping the two hate groups separated.
@AP_Politics @AP Everyone who shows up today is wrong. Everyone. Left, right, and media. You should let this people do their thing and give them no attention. By doing this you will make them grow stronger and have a national platform.		The fault will lie on everyone that show up.
@HarleyRouda Everyone believes in climate change. The difference is between people who think it's natural, people that think you can throw money at it to make it go away, and people that think there's nothing that can be done to stop it now.
@SFFMT Both of them only have one platform. Anti Trump.
@thehill Where's the first part of the video? We all know what it means when the owner of the video doesn't upload it all.
@skattr3388 @RWPUSA 2/3rds majority. So just like Clinton. May get passed the house but won't get passed the senate. So essentially it means it's useless.
@libslayer691 @TrumpJew @ABC Only one of these groups had multiple weapons taken from them today.
@ABC Expel antifa then too.
@Enough1984 @anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill Assuming gender now are we? You might want to make sure they aren't offended by that first before doing that.
@Enough1984 @anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill Well if you change your mind I'll be here to listen to all your problems you have with Trump or online bullies.
@anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill Another personal insult. There's other ways to end a conversation than with insulting someone.
@Enough1984 @anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill I respond every time someone makes a personal attack. Do you have some built up aggression about Trump you would like to take out on me?
@anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill Another attack from the #CyberBully. If this makes you feel better please continue. I have thick skin and you might need this release of aggression to compensate for personal issues. So please continue if this helps you.
@anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill You just pre judged me as a Trump supporter, which is false, then made another personal insult. You are a #CyberBully. Own it.
@anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill It's a fact that someone you don't know has limited intelligence?		Might want to research the word fact.
@anna_amused @AustinKJohnson1 @thehill #CyberBully
@MaaOther @thehill Of the Senate agreed and impeached him then yes.		All presidents lie, just very few get in the position to be under oath and get busted. Not saying it's a good thing. Maybe it is necessary sometimes. I'm not here to judge.
@thehill As it should be. The process for getting criminal charges against a POTUS is first you need to impeach him. Then you can hit em with criminal charges. Nothing has changed.
@CBSNews For something 2 years ago?
@SenatorCantwell Teach yourself on YouTube. Don't get a degree for these jobs. Get rge minimum required skills and then get a job to learn. They will teach you.
@Kddid15 @VinSidious @thehill Old Navy is still going strong.
@CNN @VanJones68 Maybe she shouldn't antagonize Trump hate then on SNL if she knows how it feels.
@dreamz4meandyou @thehill It won't go with their anti cop narrative so they won't show it.		The media is completely disgusting pushing this BS off as news and injustice.
@thehill Well she knows how to play the media into selling more books and making money. So got to give it to her for that.		Even though some just call it being rewarded for lying.
@dreamz4meandyou @thehill Yes. Antifa sure does. Not sure I've seen the "other" side wear them too much.
@get2themoney321 @dreamz4meandyou @thehill Is that how you judge hate? I get it, your a fascist and I don't want anything to do with your hate. Good luck.
@get2themoney321 @dreamz4meandyou @thehill Good people right? https://t.co/4N7WNiKTln
@get2themoney321 @dreamz4meandyou @thehill I get it. But the other side is just as horrible. Do you really not follow what Antifa does?		They attack everyone, not just these people. Whites, blacks, cops, etc. These people are just as horrible.		Both sides are idiots and dangerous. Please research Antifa.
@FoxNews She couldn't even take care of her son. She wants to take care of other people now? No, thanks.
@kingofkings @VinSidious @thehill Oh. I was under the impress when you call someone a half-wit it's an insult and means your a #cyberbully.
@get2themoney321 @dreamz4meandyou @thehill There's a difference though. You can be anti fascist, as I am.		But if you support Antifa then you are a fascist. Don't let their name fool you.		If the KKK renamed themselves to "nice people that loves everyone" do you think people would call them that and that represents them?
@PfMV1cDJdfGZHJA @1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump Either way. I don't think Congress would ever be able to pass a law to restrict the media. So it's up to society to change it's thirst for fear and hateful news. Don't think it will happen anytime soon.
@kingofkings @VinSidious @thehill I don't understand what you are attempting to say #CyberBully.
@PfMV1cDJdfGZHJA @1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump But this would never fly because it would appear to be an attack on the first amendment.		So pretty much the viewers to need to boycott to make a change. But that will NEVER happen. I think we are kind of screwed.
@PfMV1cDJdfGZHJA @1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump Only idea I have is Congress passes a law to define a news network to which 95% + of the news needs to be fact based news and zero opinion. Then either these media networks need to swap to being a news network or be an entertainment network and lose all media privileges.
@VinSidious @thehill They won't say in the article because most likely it was Antifa. Wouldn't want to ruin the narrative.
@TheDemocrats Replace women with men. Sounds pretty dumb, eh?		That's how I read it every time you want to specify race or gender.
@get2themoney321 @dreamz4meandyou @thehill Antifa sympathizer
@PfMV1cDJdfGZHJA @1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump Exactly. Both sides are crazy. I just dislike 1 sided media.
@RepTomGarrett You missed that.
@nickstephan_ @DarRussian @thehill I'm anti media. How does it not?		I believe the media should be not reporting anything of this crap to begin with. But if they do, report that both sides are troublemakers.
@RepJimmyGomez and not with a violent antifa mob.		Should do this by not counter protesting and send NO MEDIA there to cover it. Whoever shows up there tomorrow is guilty in my opinion. You don't shut down hate with more hate. Ignore it.
@RepTomGarrett I like how you blame the idiots on both sides and they are a small minority that doesn't represent the majority. But the police allowing these two groups to fight were the big problem here. You kissed that.
@jaketapper Lynch and Holder had integrity. Pfft.
@PfMV1cDJdfGZHJA @1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump They brought tiki torches last time. I'm not saying they won't this time, but antifa has been bringing weapons to every protest for the last year.
@patch_misty @ABC Don't worry, the Nazi left group antifa will be there to stop them!
@DarRussian @thehill Who? The article doesn't say who brought the weapons. Typically it's antifa getting caught doing this.
@dreamz4meandyou @thehill Not sure. Antifa wears masks to hide their identity.
@1FreshTake @thehill @realDonaldTrump Why do you assume they took them from this group and not antifa who is known to get arrested for bringing weapons to events?
@HuffPost This is a handful of people. Is it OK to think all liberals like antifa?
@HuffPost False. I blame you and the media long before Trump even ran.
@M4X7MU5 @RepStevenSmith @realDonaldTrump No it's not. Might want to Google that term.
@Mediaite Apparently not a better mastermind than Trump.
@PattyMurray Could. Could not.		He sides with the law. If you don't like that, change the laws. Their yours.
@FuckTrump61 @williamjr1978 @nytpolitics @nytimes So you are fully aware @SenatorReid and the Democrats allowed this to happen, correct? I don't disagree that the Supreme Court is being politicized, by both parties now.		If you think it's just Republicans and Trump you are way off. Neither party is innocent here.
@6bottoms @RepAlGreen @realDonaldTrump I'm happy to be your outlet for hate. Please feel free to insult and call me names as much as you wish. Hope this helps you heal.
@ChrisCoons That's because it's just a witch hunt and you know it. Didn't you already vote no anyway? Why do you care?
@IanKanini @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Statistics of the economy crashing and recovering. It has nothing to do with Obama or Trumps policies.
@6bottoms @RepAlGreen @realDonaldTrump Now say, I am a #cyberbully in any language you wish.
@politico LeBron gonna be mad at you all for dividing a nation using your position as a professional athlete! Sports shouldn't divide. They should bring together.
@Noel_zeek @dee_goodday @thehill Comes from the fact an increasingly larger percent of people are calling all people with Conservative values racists. Which I know is below 50%, just throwing out a number.
@Noel_zeek @dee_goodday @thehill I only believe in the old definition with the use of that word that's why I really dislike the word used as much as it has been recently.		I feel you would enjoy this podcast if you haven't listened to it already. Great discussion about race. https://t.co/AcbdsZ1i0Q
@RepAlGreen Such #hate you have towards @realDonaldTrump.		He said, "I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence."		Which part of that don't you understand?
@Noel_zeek @dee_goodday @thehill I guess it depends on what definition you use for racist.		If you are using the older definition than anyone that is a true racist would not do what I stated.		But if you are using the newer watered down definition where 50% of Americans are racists, I would agree with you.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Have you heard of the economy crashing around that time? Every damn chart you look at for any reason will look like this. It's not because of Obama. It's due to a crash and recovery.		Not saying Obama didn't help. Just saying he's not the sole reason.
@thehill Yet they condemn a celebrity president with no political experience.
@Noel_zeek @dee_goodday @thehill Again, how is he racist? What proof do you have?
@dee_goodday @thehill How is he a racist? Dating a black woman? Hiring his Jew son in law?
@SenFeinstein Stop politicizing the supreme court!
@williamjr1978 @RickyRayinGA @nytpolitics @nytimes My only point is she did commit a crime. Was never charge. But she committed a crime. I don't care who else did it.		Putting classified emails on an unclassified system is a serious crime. If you can't even admit that then there's no point talking.
@williamjr1978 @RickyRayinGA @nytpolitics @nytimes Watching and understanding are two different things. I watch the entire series of Lost. That don't mean I understood it all.
@williamjr1978 @RickyRayinGA @nytpolitics @nytimes Both sides in the hearing. The reports. Everything.		She had classified documents on an unclassified computer. That is a crime. Are you telling me there were no classified emails? You  really don't understand any of this do you?
@alise_julie Really? I just read through his tweets and it's half fear mongering and trump hate with a dose of collusion. Sounds like every other democrat politician to me.
@williamjr1978 @nytpolitics @nytimes NRA donates 2k to most congressman. If you truly believe this then go pool to get 2.5k and buy their votes.		Supreme Court Justices are not bought and paid for.
@williamjr1978 @RickyRayinGA @nytpolitics @nytimes I agreed she was never found guilty because she was never charged. But she did commit the crime. You apparently have no experience with classified material or payed attention to the hearings. Everyone agreed she broke the law. Everyone. Was just never charged.
@williamjr1978 @nytpolitics @nytimes It used to not be not that long ago. Only until the 80s has it been heavily politicized. Before you had presidents just pick a good judge, no one cared, they did their job. Presidents even picked across the isle.		It's still no big of a deal job. Any judge will do just fine.
@williamjr1978 @RickyRayinGA @nytpolitics @nytimes False. She was clearly guilty of mishandling classified information. There is zero question on that. But due to white privilege she was never charged. Make no mistake, she was guilty. No one ever said she didn't commit that crime. She did. Just not punished.
@RepAdamSmith So you support antifa? Good to know.
@S0j0urning @SenKamalaHarris This is not a requirement or a Constitutional duty to be provided with these records. This is just a smear campaign. It's disgusting politics. They are politicizing the Supreme Court.
@jc5502 @SenKamalaHarris @coleyworld It's the law. Don't like the outcome blame the lawmakers. He doesn't create laws at the bench.
@Alanmfrost1 @themanfronUNCLE @SenKamalaHarris @CHCmobile That's because the appropriate process is through political means, which is impeachment. You impeach the POTUS then you can do criminal charges. No wonder you think this is all screwed up, you don't understand what you are saying.
@SenKamalaHarris Is this a requirement? Circle one.		Yes	No	I'm politicizing the Supreme Court
@sethriklin @StealthTweet63 @thehill First off, campaign managers typically run the campaign and have authority to do things without the candidates approval. This is to protect them. The candidate usually knows nothing. Second, it seems you just hate Trump and can't back up any of your outrageous claims with facts.
@_Merlin_Pinpin_ @Roland_Jenkins @ABC Oh look, a probable #Cyberbully
@Doriann200 @AP This is not a distraction. This is her selling her book. End of story.
@Roland_Jenkins @ABC False. There's bad people on both sides is more like it.
@jakalpimp @thehill False. He said that they shouldn't be indicted and should follow through the political process which is impeachment instead.
@thehill I heard he also prefers Mayo to Miracle Whip. OMG! This country is screwed.
@dimeclubtv @washingtonpost Maybe she was passing flyers out illegally? Maybe she was harassing people? Who knows. What I do know is the Post won't give you the full story.
@theofficialrad @Wudang96 @AP_Politics @AP Good advice. Always follow your dreams. Don't let anyone discourage you.
@CBSNews Old news. She is already confirmed. No one cares about your smear campaign.
@TIME There is a lot more than 16 books in this picture. Fake news strikes again.
@FoxNews Why are we focused on this one girl? Hundreds of people get murdered everyday and I don't see the media coverage like this trying to find the killer.
@MaureenDawson1 @AP_Politics @AP The ones that are in swing states and want to get reelected probably will. There is one still left that voted from him before. Wouldn't see him flipping now.
@Wudang96 @AP_Politics @AP Barack Obama
@thehill Wait. They have been holding back?
@therealbroohaha @thehill Not at all. He was banned for that?
@CBSNews Just keep ANTIFA away and don't no media and then everything will be fine. Once those 2 things are introduced into this, all hell will break lose and it will be EVERYONES fault that is there.
@RepValDemings Let's honor her for her achievements. Not for having a vagina.
@JazzShaw Meow
@thehill Better refuse service to ANTIFA dressed in black masks. If you do that, I'm cool with it.
@MaddowBlog OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG RUSSIA TRUMP OMG
@thehill Personally I say, good. But ethically I say, no.
@shawwwman @RAVerBruggen Probably. I just go by instinct. I could be wrong.
@RAVerBruggen Yes. Because it's a culture problem. Not a police problem.
@cyclearly @debraclemstudio @washingtonpost I agree. I'm going off the zero evidence available to the public and the multiple IG's that have stated there was no evidence of collusion.		But you are 100% correct. We don't know what Mueller has yet.
@thehill Wow. You all get trolled too easy.
@TIME Just a serious as people take him. He's a comedian. An actor. He dances when we say. Make me laugh clown!
@treat52 @mkraju @SaraMurray Ha. 1 1/2 years ago the left predicted everything would collapse.
@thehill Isn't this known already?
@chrislhayes Does it involve Russia or Trump?
@debraclemstudio @cyclearly @washingtonpost I'm sure you are aware this has nothing to do with collusion.
@KaceyUwakwe @jnarls @realDonaldTrump #CyberBully here.
@think4wunce @jnarls @realDonaldTrump BS. The fans had a problem with it long before. They were doing this for a month and a half before Trump spoke. They already divided the nation by then.
@jnarls @realDonaldTrump All of those weren't protesting while at work either.
@Dwebbb27 @FoxNews @NFL The players politicized long before Trump came into the picture. They started August 14 and Trump first mentions it 26 September. By then they already divided America.		Granted. Trump didn't help it and made it worse. But he is not the one to blame for starting it.
@cyclearly @debraclemstudio @washingtonpost Understand. But the longer it continues the more divided America becomes and I think we all know that this investigation won't find any collusion on either side. So my point is, let's hurry this up so we can move on.
@debraclemstudio @washingtonpost Sure it is. Trump tweets daily about Hillarys collusion and I'm sure you have seen the accusations about trump.		Both sides are being accused of collusion and it should stop.
@markhartig @thehill You are just a delightful human.
@washingtonpost Time for him to end it. Russian collusion conspiracy against both sides is doing way more harm than apparently you can imagine.
@AC360 @andersoncooper If that's true then the entire left media and politicians have given green light to Atinfa.
@Dwebbb27 @FoxNews @NFL I support neither. It's not always one or the other.
@tpabob46 @KamalaHarris Pay attention, if they wanted to why wouldn't they have already while they had the power? Why would they wait potentially lose power before doing it? Makes zero sense.
@RarifiedAlien @ximxiti @MarkDice @CNN No one at CNN has a domestic violence past?
@CNN You think trump has violated the rules too. So your opinion does not matter.
@MotorCityBadBoi @trumpforprison7 @thehill I don't care what you believe or your level of understanding. I'm not here to please you.
@washingtonpost I think the Post should be able to be sued over this kind of stuff.
@IndianaJones79 @thehill A judge can't make an order that is against laws. So of course he didn't have to follow them. You will see, this story will disappear in a few days and nothing will happen.
@MotorCityBadBoi @trumpforprison7 @thehill I'm anti media. When the POTUS is right the left media is my target. When the POTUS is left the right media is. The opposing media side is the ones that always push the most fear, hatred, and lies. Make sense?
@thehill LeBron gonna get mad at you for dividing the nation using your position in sports!
@RepJenniffer @CNNEE @RafaelRomoCNN Eww.
@Jnorby360 @MichaelAvenatti @RepSwalwell @DNC I'd bet you are way wrong.
@tpabob46 @KamalaHarris What rights have been lost in the last 2 years?
@democrzgirl @KamalaHarris @bravoloverfan I thought all that was at sake for 2016, 2014, 2012, 2010, 2008, etc. When is it actually at stake you #fearmongerer? Bunch of fear and lies in exchange for votes.
@thehill Held in contempt for following the laws on the books. Good luck with that.
@ABC Annnnnnndddddd nothing.
@KamalaHarris Who says we aren't? Do you not trust the FBI, CIA, and DHS when they say they are handling it? Didn't you criticize Trump for not trusting our intelligence community?
@MaddowBlog Another dose of Maddow #fear and #hate.
@BarretBeck @thehill Here's the actual quote. https://t.co/dmhc4x0rID
@BarretBeck @thehill I would have to say you didn't read it properly. It said if if they were given the emails and then RELEASED them, then it would be criminal. As we all know, that is not what happened.
@trumpforprison7 @thehill Please keep them coming.
@trumpforprison7 @thehill Why would you even think I am a trump supporter because I dislike #cyberbullying?
@trumpforprison7 @thehill Again the personal insults. Please keep them coming if it makes you feel better. I have a high enough self esteem so can take it.
@trumpforprison7 @thehill I don't even know what that means. But it doesn't take away the fact you are a #cyberbully.
@TulipGirl4Ever @FoxNews It's natural. I say go for it.
@RepMcNerney Why? Would you say the free press is the enemy of the people?
@BarretBeck @thehill That is not what he said.
@trumpforprison7 @thehill #CyberBully
@thehill Do it! Please do it.
@FoxNews Well if the body allows it, must be natural, right?
@thehill Go get em Mueller! You get those tax fraudsters! Should get a job at the IRS since that's all you seem to care about or able to get.
@MissAnaTX @thehill Are you aware democrats voted for the budget also?
@RepCardenas Are you suggesting they are the enemy of the people? Really sounds like you are attacking the free press here.
@CNN And they wonder why people call them fake news.
@Clownfac3 @djboharic @robsmithonline So we can agree, there are only a small percentage of journalist this message applies to. The majority who sit at home and are just keyboard warriors are not brave.
@thehill Let me guess. It will be released in her next book.
@StaybulJeenyuss @politico Treason, collusion, conspiracy, lied, said his name.		That's what moving goal posts looks like.
@politico This is why you are called fake news.
@LizBiv @jonfavs Might get it trending with the "media is the enemy group". Have you filled out an application yet?
@flakesofjam @jonfavs If you think the left media isn't do the same thing. Oh wait, you're here being manipulated and guess what, you hate people because of it. You've just been encouraged to hate people and it worked.
@IMAbusymom04 @jonfavs Enemy of the people, right?
@jonfavs Enemy of the people! Am I right boys? Can't believe @jonfavs is agreeing with @realDonaldTrump.
@DarleneLewis5 @Acosta @StephenAtHome @realDonaldTrump As that's where actors appear.
@meglantz @Acosta @StephenAtHome @realDonaldTrump Then you don't understand her job. She is not there to give personal opinions. That's like going to the library and asking the librarian to defend a racist book. Not her job, she just checks them out to you.
@Acosta @StephenAtHome @realDonaldTrump Is going on late night comedy shows now considered #journalism?
@KamalaHarris The truth is, we shouldn’t just be thanking white men for electing conservative leaders — in 2018, we should be electing white men as those leaders.
@jjclarinet @KamalaHarris The truth is, we shouldn’t just be thanking white men for electing conservative leaders — in 2018, we should be electing white men as those leaders.		Let me know how you can possibly read that as positive.
@KamalaHarris What is your obsession with the color of people skin? Replace what you said with white men and you sure would be called a #racist
@EdKrassen @RashidaTlaib Take what? Are you 5 years old? Seriously?
@CNN Why does anyone in the world care who or what she has sex with? Seriously CNN? Knock off the identity politics BS so the left can win either the House or Senate this year. You are working against us with this crap.
@cottontailnyou @CNNPR @Acosta @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome #cyberbully
@JaneyinMadTown @CNNPolitics Stop pretending your patriotism isn't racism.
@dilemmv @KamalaHarris Please do! Probably don't want her to for the same reasons. But please do!
@rem3276 @KamalaHarris As long as its not a white male they are for them.
@Acosta @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome Real news on a comedy show? Are you serious?
@SecPompeo What's different between today and last year?
@washingtonpost He brought them in himself. If he admits his bias and apologizes to the POTUS for the unfair treatment he has been getting then I will leave you alone.
@SecAzar Could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could could. #fear.
@CNNPolitics That's because you are just doing it for political purposes and wasted peoples time and money.
@RepMarciaFudge This study does not compare equal jobs. You shouldn't be spreading this misleading information.
@nearhere_ @RepBonnie 100% agree. I'd like to teach but the wages are too low where I couldn't.
@nearhere_ @RepBonnie I didn't imply that. I said they typically go for caregiver type jobs. Teachers, nurses, etc. Not software developers, engineers, etc. Thats the difference.
@KristenClarkeJD Quit #racebaiting.
@nearhere_ @RepBonnie They compare overall white men to black females. They don't compare the pay difference between the two in the same jobs.		Tons of studies show females typically go for caregiver positions like teachers, nurses, etc where white males tend to go for higher paying jobs.
@nearhere_ @RepBonnie This study is BS. Read they study if you really want to understand it. Apparently she didn't.		Also Black Women are among the highest percentage in college. Where's the outrage!!!?
@RepHankJohnson This will work out just as well as banning music and movies. Except you don't need a 10k machine to produce a gun that may fire once or twice before breaking. Fake outrage.
@gelles @Acosta Jim Acosta retweeted this. Now we know it's fake news propaganda, thanks Jim!
@RepBonnie #racebaiting is disgusting. This does not compare apples to apples. Should really be ashamed for this.
@SenJeffMerkley This is just a smear campaign. You know these records will take forever to pull and just using it as justification to smear him. It's rather disgusting political move. Didn't you already vote no anyway? Why do you even care now?
@thehill Sewing for them for enforcing the law. Good luck with that.
@RepYvetteClarke #racebaiting is what outrages me.
@KamalaHarris Stop #racebaiting. It's rather disgusting and a #hateful and #dividing message to keep pushing.
@denuribe73 @FoxNews It's one big opinion besides a number. Do you honestly not know the difference between opinion and facts? What the hell would I Google to prove your opinion?
@ctcapitolreport Imagine a world where you can just treat people as people and not by their gender. They are just as capable as anyone else.
@denuribe73 @FoxNews Says the person posting an occupy Democrats meme. One of the most dishonest and hateful groups out there.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Unsanctioned. Why would they do this knowing the consequences? It's not worth it just to let people know who you like to have sex with.
@ohitshim @CBSNews Pretty sure these crimes were committed during the time they were working with Democrat politicians. So not sure how you get to that point.
@realMAGA13 @CNN Because it's all just pressure to attempt to get information out of them about "collusion". It's nonsense tax fraud charges which I hope they get in trouble for. But it's just a waste of time and attention.
@CarolBensonc94 @CNN Commited said crimes while working with the left wing.
@ChrisMurphyCT You're taking the wrong stance on this issue. I think infowars has only 8 or 9 subscribers but millions will agree you don't sensor speech.
@finklesteinsh @CNN Cue the nut to somehow blame a gun nut instead the actual person committing the crime.
@ohitshim @CBSNews This has nothing to do with MAGA. It's just tax fraud and they will get a fine or do a little jail. I don't think anyone has an issue with them being punished for breaking the law.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Trump or Putins name hasn't been mention once in this trial so far. But you just have to attempt to connect some dots to save face, right?
@SerioLynn @Zelectrician @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump What's coming? Please tell me a good bed time story.
@AndrewPSegal @ARmastrangelo @ItsMeMissie Yes, and a bunch of Twitter commenters were praising the act. Can you imagine if the KKK did this to someone and a bunch of people openly praising this? I can't understand why it's acceptable for the left to do this.
@Foxyat45ZPHIB @jeustacen @thehill Trump has attacked every race and sex. He attacks more whites than anything.		I've explained numerous of times how LeBron is dividing and you can go find those if you are really curious.
@glacialburners @mborgens @PaleRider_Rev68 @thehill I can post pictures of trump kissing babies but it's irrelevant.
@ThatGuyCrisby @PaleRider_Rev68 @thehill I don't disagree. But when they did this they divided America? Right? We can all agree on this I think. Whether they meant to or wanted to is another question. But after they did, they didn't stop. Trump didn't do this, they did.
@mborgens @PaleRider_Rev68 @thehill This is not even what I'm talking about. Why are you posting random pictures?
@Hoopsking1968 @thehill Do you even know what that word means anymore #CyberBully?
@ScottNGibbs @thehill Go read their tweets. One person attacked first. They have dates and times on it. Spoiler alert. LeBron attacked first.
@jeustacen @thehill And attacking the POTUS while dividing America.
@Hoopsking1968 @thehill You are a #CyberBully.
@ScottNGibbs @thehill Really? What's happening right now with this conversation? Would we be having it if he just played sports and didn't use his position in sports to get political?
@PaleRider_Rev68 @thehill NFL players starting kneeling way before Trump. LeBron supported them. They literally were dividing America using their sports platform. Trump commented on it after the fact. This isn't hard to figure out who started the divide.
@CNN Why are you reporting this? Top notch #journalism here.
@thehill LeBron keeps getting involved in politics and using his platform in sports to divide America while at the same time blaming trump of this.
@america_eyes @TIME @RealCandaceO CNN kind of did on Twitter. Was rather surprised. Probably didn't on air though.
@IamTonetteSmith @TIME So everything he always says is a lie. Except this one thing, right?
@TIME Like I'm going to go to your site in search of facts.
@soundblaster16 @sneakerpants #CyberBully
@sneakerpants Here. You are a fascist if you support this disgusting behavior. Clear?
@sneakerpants @TalkingSchmidt @CNN By fascist. Agree.
@FranceAgainstDT @CNN #fascist
@RealTrevorReese @CNN #fascist
@TalkingSchmidt @CNN #fascist
@alfodeg @CNN #fascist
@RepJimmyGomez If Russians were here voting for Trump would you be singing the same tune?
@MaddowBlog Give it up already. You're going to look even more foolish when this is over if you keep going.
@One_Spy_Girl @Sullacious @washingtonpost No. You made an anonymous personal insult on my intelligence and age because you couldn't understand what I was talking about instead of asking me to clarify. You are a #cyberbully. Just own it and move on. Go insult more people to make yourself feel better. Muted
@One_Spy_Girl @Sullacious @washingtonpost Old enough to not be a #cyberbully.
@One_Spy_Girl @washingtonpost This article was not about bashing ANTIFA and ignoring the alt-right. I can't help if the majority of the media is focused on smearing the right. When Obama was president I was critical of Fox.		It's a cycle. The nasty media is always the opposite of the POTUS. Get it?
@elelsee @JoshDubyaB @MetalRains Because you said "let me know if you require clarification" and I was trying to see if we were talking about the same thing or not. So I gave you my guess and if I was wrong I was expecting clarification.
@One_Spy_Girl @washingtonpost It's true. Maybe you need to do some research on ANTIFA if you don't agree by now.
@elelsee @JoshDubyaB @MetalRains I agree!		You know what that means, right? We were on the same page! OMG BFFs!
@elelsee @JoshDubyaB @MetalRains I believe I know what you said. You were referring to a membership card and not an ID.		What I said is you need an ID in order to get a membership card.		On the same page now?
@MasterSiKGrizz @ajeminem @BernieSanders What do you consider a fake crime?
@BernieSanders We should just follow the laws and not need bail.
@HuffPost Should do a story on all the ways the media has explained it. Get over it. Nothing will happen.
@Sullacious @washingtonpost Muted. Not going to surround myself with people that are so hateful. #fascist
@Sullacious @washingtonpost I really wonder if you know what you are saying. Do you even know who ANTIFA is? Do you know what they do? Do you know their name has nothing to do with their morals and actions? If you truly support them then you are no better than a KKK member.
@Sullacious @washingtonpost Hmm, you never call out the evil on the left they will grow and continue to get bigger and stronger. I never said the alt right is good. They were both acting like idiots. Problem is when you only hold one side accountable. Means you support the other side.
@washingtonpost Still can't blame ANTIFA at all? Both sides suck. Both sides were to blame.
@Slam_poet @thehill You made an anonymous personal insult at me suggesting I wasn't a real person or even an American because I have different beliefs than you. You are a #CyberBully.
@Slam_poet @thehill #CyberBully
@thehill Here is a better headline: More athletes politicize their respective sport and assist in dividing a nation.
@thehill Horrible idea. I bet people start smashing other ones until they are removed too. Not a good trend to start.
@politico It's true. It's still legal to own fire in California!
@Marybenti1 @thehill I wont defend them. But I will say if he goes then ANTIFA should go.
@RoKhanna Majority of Americans are in the 1 percent on a global scale. I'd say we are doing pretty damn good my fellow 1 precenters.
@BlackkSpasmodic @Vader671 @FoxNews I support cops, you support criminals. I get it.
@BlackkSpasmodic @Vader671 @FoxNews I'm sorry, I don't think Michael Brown was innocent by any means and this started riots and race wars. I would not honor this guy in anyway, ever. Didn't even read the entire list but I am sure there are more people like that on there.
@Motox_33v @FoxNews So the healthier the are the less you pay type of idea?
@Vader671 @FoxNews Randy Moss is using his position as an athlete to push an agenda that cops are evil. NFL players are using their position as athletes to kneel during the national anthem. Both of these political issues cause divide. The issue is the athletes. Not Trump who simply points it out.
@FoxNews Exactly my thoughts.
@Vader671 @FoxNews No clue what you are talking about.
@HawaiiDelilah They should win easy. But we will see.
@FoxNews LeBron gonna be mad at you for using sports to divide a nation.....
@thehill Nice publicity stunt.
@KyleKashuv @benshapiro @joerogan What's going on fuckers?
@leisure3000 @shkankhunt421 @washingtonpost #CyberBully alert.
@CBSNews You have a culture problem. Not a gun problem.
@HAWofPA @FoxNews It was antifa that was arrested. Pretty sure he doesn't support them.
@RepDeSaulnier It doesnt. That's like saying wifi access means you have direct access to almond milk on Amazon.
@Gabe203 @RepLloydDoggett I think removing the government completely from healthcare, removing all regulations, and all taxes is the way to go so the market can fix itself. Single payer as a Country I don't think will work very well and it would be a very long time until we even tried it, if we even do.
@Gabe203 @RepLloydDoggett Yes the same story we always here. Then millions couldn't afford ACA when it came out so they went without. No matter what with healthcare their will be winners and losers.		Glad I'm on single payer and don't have to worry about the constant fear about healthcare prices.
@elelsee @JoshDubyaB @MetalRains Are you saying you don't need an ID to get a membership card?
@Gabe203 @RepLloydDoggett Oh. So all poor  or healthy 20 year olds have cancer now. Got ya.
@TheLastWord Should we recall Obama to reunite all the ones separated under his administration?
@RepLloydDoggett Do you attack low income housing because it's less desirable too?		Some people want this. Some people can't afford better insurance and would rather have this than nothing. Why can't you just be happy that people get a choice?
@jamiekilstein @benshapiro Oh ya? Challenge accepted. Why are you showing the black cat as the aggressor and the white one taking the black one down? #blackcatslivesmatter
@echatepalla @Mkts2day @Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump My reply was to someone else.		Trump is a birther. I'm not a Trump supporter so you won't see me defending him.
@RealNoraC @alska2017 @NBCNews I don't do this often but I think you deserve the hashtag #TrumpDerangementSyndrome and to be muted. Please stop following politics. I think you are too emotionally invested and your life could be much happier without it. Good luck and please get better.
@teufelshunde4 @JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta It wasn't their official policy but they did. They separated them, kept kids in cages and tent cities, and numerous stories of sexual abuse. The same exact stuff that's going on. Fox reported it. No one else cared at the time.		This isn't a debatable story. This is a fact.
@teufelshunde4 @JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta 1. Ok		2. There are plenty of scandals for Obama. Separating children from illegal immigrants, putting them in cages, and them being sexually assaulted just for a quick example.		3. The left calls Trump an illegitimate POTUS with zero proof.
@RealNoraC @alska2017 @NBCNews Tax reform, repeal of ACA mandate, soon to be 2 SCOTUS, all budgets passed. Gridlock is what happened to Obama. This is not gridlock.		You know what the right said? We want to take control to investigate this administration. Its rhetoric. Nothing will happen. Nothing ever does.
@teufelshunde4 @JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta You sound like one long CNN headline. I will call these crimes once/if he is convicted. Until then everyone is innocent until proven guilty. 		The EXACT same thing you feel about the right, the right felt about the left during the Obama administration. They were wacko, right?
@Axetester149 @xchuck1x @Mediaite I've replied nicely about all my opinion to be only met with a other trump conspiracy and hate message. I was attempting to discuss my thoughts and opinions, not how crazy trump is. The conversation was useless because it was one sided.
@thehill Apparently you don't know what the American people want. They would rather have a liar than you.
@HuffPost Well I'd recommend all politicians and all media take this seriously and stop pushing their #hate and #fear 24/7 assault on America. They are creating a bunch of wackos. When you surround yourself with hate and fear it will consume you. This is to both sides by the way.
@Axetester149 @xchuck1x @Mediaite This is what I and many others believe it to be.		It's like when people say Nazi. They aren't talking an actual Nazi. Well some do, but they are crazy. Same with saying racists. Has an entirely new meaning now.
@xchuck1x @Axetester149 @Mediaite Seems you have #TrumpDerangmentSyndrome and we get no where talking. Cya.
@xchuck1x @Axetester149 @Mediaite Oh please. I am not talking about the president. You asked me for my opinion and I gave it.		Nothing bad that has been claimed a out Trump has been true yet. Except his stupid lies. Which personally I don't care about. I canre about actions and policies.
@TrueScotsman5 @ItsJoeAguiar @realDonaldTrump Exactly.
@Burghgirl69 @seanhannity I don't fear either way. I don't care who get's voted in.
@Burghgirl69 @seanhannity It's not a meme. It's his tweet.		When a yes or on vote. Would could possible think oppose means?
@Burghgirl69 @seanhannity Obviously no one has voted. But he already stated he will oppose. Meaning he will say no. Why talk to someone when you know how you will vote already? What's the point?
@Burghgirl69 @seanhannity Pretty sure oppose means no.		https://t.co/TvnQDHr90u
@TIME Never heard of this term before but all 18 applies to me.		But I consider myself an introvert, socially awkward at times, and emotionless. Really don't know if those are traits of someone who is Emotionally Intelligent.

@JimShifflett819 @FoxNews WTF does this have to do with Trump and why would you even assume I support Trump or not? Bunch of psychics or something on Twitter today.
@KamalaHarris #MoveOn. Tired of seeing your constant feed of #hate and #fear. You must have some type of positive message to spread, right? Or you just want everyone to fall into a deep #depression so you can promote #suicide awareness? Seriously, you aren't doing any good by pushing fear.
@ScottWalker @wistatefair Cranberry? You would lose my vote if I lived there.
@PattiR57167178 @thehill He insults men more. That's a ridicules statement.
@seanhannity Why is he meeting with him? He's already voted NO!! What's the point?
@alska2017 @NBCNews Then the government will be gridlocked, then the red wave will wash out the democrats after achieving nothing but gridlock. Which is fine with me.		Point is they won't get anything done if they win without beating Trump in 2020.
@FoxNews Non story. Click bait BS. Don't click the link.
@RepJeffries @BarackObama Everything is always "about to". When is the last time something actually did happen or change?
@JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta If you watched Fox and CNN during the Obama time you would see it. They may cover it for 1 minute but wouldn't run it 24/7.		It's like how CNN covers Russian collusion 24/7 now and Fox will give it a minute or 2.
@Mkts2day @echatepalla @Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump I gave 2 facts that a RACIST would not do and you call me a wacko?		Would you care to explain instead of just being a #CyberBully?
@JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta When Obama was POTUS the right thought CNN/CBS/NBC etc was state sponsored media.		When Trump is POTUS the left thinks FOX is state sponsored media.		I'd rather have no media right now. They have all became so biased it isn't worth watching.
@LoveRemovesHate @tsmith724 @RepAdamSchiff I'm giving you an example on why money doesn't matter. It's chump change donations or none at all.
@LoveRemovesHate @tsmith724 @RepAdamSchiff https://t.co/31kbkZuOWi
@xchuck1x @Axetester149 @Mediaite First you need to realize the term fake news doesn't mean just some made up story. It's more of useless news report that's only purpose is to smear a political person.		For instance. https://t.co/mECSVZAJo9
@LoveRemovesHate @tsmith724 @RepAdamSchiff Money doesn't matter much. Most Congressman receive 2k or less from the NRA. If you think money matters that much then why haven't Democrats paid them $2,001 to vote for gun control? It's because it doesn't matter. Politicians hold their beliefs with or without donations.
@LanderosHassan @Grey_Obelisk @Acosta Or distraction. Or trolling.
@LanderosHassan @Grey_Obelisk @Acosta Hint? You believe this tweet but not thousands of others? We know he lies, why could you possibly trust anything he says? Just because it fits your beliefs this time?
@melodygoss77 @Acosta Quoting a racist, rapist, pedophile, and slave owner. Ironic.
@MerrittKelly1 @Acosta Dossier?
@Grey_Obelisk @Acosta How do you know? Were you there?
@LoveRemovesHate @tsmith724 @RepAdamSchiff It's the message. Hate Trump? Vote blue!		That annoys me. Should always be vote for the candidate you trust and you think will vote in your best interests.		The party over country message sucks. The vote only for 1 party message sucks.
@thehill I thought he has. Problem is media and democrats keeps saying he's taking about interference when he is talking about collision. Media and democrats needs to be straight forward with the people.
@ChieverJason @BluCollar_Guy @MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill I do want the facts. The point is you don't have them. The media don't have them.		The only facts that matter are being collected by the special counsel and they are not telling anyone what they are.
@dialmformolly @thehill Again. You reference an article. I can write an article also, does that make it evidence or fact? 		I don't go by articles. I'll go by the evidence the special counsel presents. I'll wait while you can pre judge. Bye.
@BluCollar_Guy @ChieverJason @MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill It's unknown because it's not being investigated because it's not a crime.		Trump is being investigated by the media and social media. I'll wait for the results of the special counsel before I call anyone guilty of anything. Innocent until proven guilty is still a thing.
@dialmformolly @thehill Evidence is what the special counselor and lawyers collects. You are talking about news articles and tweets. You have absolutely no idea what evidence is being collected and will be used and for what purposes.
@BluCollar_Guy @ChieverJason @MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill If you don't see that they are the same thing then we can't get anywhere. Did Clinton accept this information from Fusion that was delivered by a Russian spy? The answer is yes she did. It doesn't matter who's hands it went through first.
@ChieverJason @MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill What's the difference bettwen Clinton actually receiving something and Trump not receiving something?		Both meeting with Russians to get dirt on the opponent. One walked away with something and the other we don't know if they did or not.		Fact is, neither is a crime.
@HarshTweet @HuffPost Completely agree! We meed to limit breeding at some point. We need a Thanos.		My only point was our biology is set. That will never change. We are made to breed. Nothing can change that.
@dialmformolly @thehill Oh no. Everyone else does not see this. I understand you would like to leave this conversation without providing any proof or evidence of your claims. This is what typically happens. 		Innocent until proven guilty. Most of us will wait for the special counsel to release results.
@ChieverJason @MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill Apparently I need like proof and facts. Not tweets and opinions.		By this logic Clinton is guilty also, right? Her campaign received dirt from a Russian spy on her opponent.
@dialmformolly @thehill What would I google to see this evidence?		"special counsel evidence list supporting trump collusion" - not found, apparently they don't release evidence until the investigation is over.
@MarcNormanton @RetroBerner @thehill I disagree. He just speaks his mind which makes him look like a fool most of them time. But it has nothing to do with some conspiracy of Russian collusion.
@HuffPost FACIST protester. Stop using their self proclaimed name and call them what they are. If the alt right changed their name to "not racist and law abiding citizens" would really call them that?
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation So your are admitting this is normal behavior and nothing to do with Trump or collusion? Case closed.
@RetroBerner @thehill If he was in collusion with the Russians as claimed why would he do this at a press conference and just not text Putin to avoid looking guilty?
@tsmith724 @RepAdamSchiff They can't because nothing is verified fact. It's just politics to get you to vote in November.		You know, the same shit the right did to Obama.
@TheLastWord As the media goes lower the response of the WH will go lower. It's math.
@thehill If it's in plain sight I must be blind. Can you link to the evidence please?
@RepDonBeyer Doesn't this mean they are beating you also? Mr. lawmaker?
@HuffPost Females and males have biological purposes. That's not debatable. Sorry. Love you on friends!
@thehill Stop giving these fools attention. Every single person there from the left, right, to media are guilty. They are inciting more of this behavior only meant to divide. Stop it.
@xchuck1x @Axetester149 @Mediaite I would say Fox has been a lot more tougher on Trump than CNN was on Obama.		Both sides put out fake stories. Both sides ignore certain issues. Until you realize this you will be stuck in a one sided argument.
@echatepalla @Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump Yes. Because all racist date black females and invite Jews into their families and give them a great job.
@caberlin62 @thehill Rather fascists of you.
@RyanShenandoah @MMSWaz @Axetester149 @Mediaite Point taken.
@RepMikeCoffman I know you care. My point is people are able to focus on more than one item at a time especially when they have a large staff that does the majority of the work.
@RepMikeCoffman You owe it to the America people to focus on health care and  jobs and quit your obsession on Trumps Twitter habits.
@RyanShenandoah @MMSWaz @Axetester149 @Mediaite While that probably is true I would argue that American politics viewed in America to American voters is what really matters.
@thehill The media and politicians on both sides are responsible for this. The population are just parroting their respective media and politicians.
@echatepalla @Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump The only fact we can safely state her is you are a #CyberBully. You really should learn the difference between facts and opinions.
@Axetester149 @xchuck1x @Mediaite Again. You missed my point.		The media on both sides are biased. All I see is media talking points arguing each other. They parrot the media they watch and believe.		The EXACT same way you think is how the other side thinks. The media controls how both sides think.
@Axetester149 @xchuck1x @Mediaite I don't disagree.		My point is everything you feel about trump and fox is exactly what the right thinks about Obama and left media when he was in office. The exact same feelings.		Need to ask youself, why? Is their a right and wrong? Or could it be both are wrong.
@debmatters @Nadernashed2 @msmcbaker @KamalaHarris If its your second offense it is.
@xchuck1x @Axetester149 @Mediaite I'm not a trump supporter.		Fox did the same to Obama when he was in office. Now the left media are doing it to trump.		You probably hated fox for this right and agree with the left media now. The opposite is for the right.		My point is both sides do this shit. Both are wrong.
@Axetester149 @Mediaite He's not attacking the free press. He is attacking the biased negative spinning press that has been a problem for years. There's a difference. Yes, Fox is part of that too.
@jeannineandkids @mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump When you can't make a point on an argument you just go for personal attacks, right? #CyberBully
@ambasalas @jaslyn1701 @jaketapper Ok. Agree. This story should be scrutinized for the access to documents this person had over the last 20 years and not just forgotten because he was fired. That's my only reason I responded.
@jeannineandkids @mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump I don't doubt that for a second. 		But Obama was not attacked 24/7 in this way so we will never know how he would respond if he was put in Trumps shoes.
@echatepalla @Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump I don't believe Trump either. Why would you automatically assume someones political beliefs? Fact is what you posted is your opinion and not fact or truth. Deal with it.
@TestKitchen211 @thehill I am not running for POTUS so it's not a requirement.
@TestKitchen211 @thehill Nothing to do with race. Stop #racebaiting
@jeannineandkids @mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump Are you a bot that just gives random responses or just can't stick to 1 subject?		LeBron James attacked Trump first. Go ahead and read the tweets date/time. Should the POTUS respond, probably not. But don't think for a second LeBron is innocent. He started the childish crap.
@ambasalas @jaslyn1701 @jaketapper Trump and Stone were friends. Manafort was Stones friend.		Either way I think Manafort needs to do some jail time. My point was Lynn said Feinsiten already addressed this on Twitter and the person was fired so basically the news story should go away. Which is obviously dumb.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Damn bots.
@Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump How is that the TRUTH? This is your opinion. Do you not know the difference?
@jeannineandkids @mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump What are you even talking about? This is not about Trump. A user posted he loves trump, another user made a personal attack, I responded calling them a cyber bully.		You seem like a person that just wants to hate people and will go out of their way to make it so.
@ambasalas @jaslyn1701 @jaketapper You say he does. That doesn't mean it is true.		The RNC is who recommend Paul Manfort to Trump.
@jaketapper Let the special counsel deal with this. All you are doing is throwing fuel on a fire for ad revenue.
@jaslyn1701 @jaketapper When Trump found out Paul Manafort was not a very good guy he fired him. Why do we constantly connect the dots there but can't here?
@jaketapper @washingtonpost @kaitlancollins Do you have a good source on this information you would like to share?
@thehill This person should not be running for office if they think that.
@jeannineandkids @mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump Yes it is. He was posting that he loved the president and was met with personal attacks.
@lifesafeast @brianschatz At it's highest 95% of the federal Government was funded on tariffs prior to income tax for a hundred plus years. Do you have any idea on tariffs and how they work?
@brianschatz The country was founded on tarrifs to pay for the government! You act like they are evil and pointless.
@mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump Do you support #CyberBullying? Are you here just to insult people?
@Miriam2626 @realDonaldTrump Congress and senate control the budget and its been republican controlled for 8 years. You don't give a POTUS credit and not for the budget.
@JuliaCaplick @SovietSergey @realDonaldTrump Countries income was founded on tariffs. They arent bad. But could be abused.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump That is extremely false. Tarrifs are a huge reason capitalism worked prior to income tax.
@mommyof3clj @M_A_G_A_45 @realDonaldTrump Google it #CyberBully
@ThomasNovth It's nice to have goals in life.
@TippeTyYay @thehill Oh BS. They just testified saying the attacks are still coming in but they have it under control. This is a complete lie.
@ThomasNovth Your opinion is he did. But that doesn't mean it's fact. Maybe they will call you as a star witness for the trial to testify.
@Sogburn57 @CNN @HillaryClinton We have a Russian meme here trying to cause divide!
@thehill Is Don Lemon and Donald Trump playing "I know you are but what am I"?
@CNN Use the @HillaryClinton defense and you will be fine. As long as you didn't mean to break the law, you won't get charges pressed.
@Bluebird4us @thehill Good one.
@knicksmets @CBSNews Yes. Any negative Trump news gets blasted 24/7.
@knicksmets @CBSNews It gets posted 10 times a day like all the other media channels to make sure you see it.
@thehill Why because they don't automatically vote for Clinton?
@JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta I agree all the ones you listed are bad. But you don't mention any of the left ones. If you honestly think one side is good and the other is evil and that people with less education are on the opposite side as you then you are the one with the issues.
@STEFANOgasm @ABC Could you explain to me how there would be evidence? If I am a Russian and come here to vote, how would they know?		Do I personally think there was voter fraud. Probably, a little. Nothing to worry about.		But the point is there is no way to actually tell. Anyone can vote.
@thehill Let's not get it twisted. Every single person there including the media and youtubers are guilty. Stop giving these clowns attention. It's the minority on each side. The majority are not like them.
@thehill Want to back that up with some facts? Are you at the security briefings? Were you invited to come look over the should of what he does everyday? No, you're a paid clown, now dance for me and make me laugh.
@STEFANOgasm @ABC Are you cool with Russians coming over to vote then? If we take down their memes then they will just come vote.
@intenseCA @Acosta Grandstander award.
@thehill That's find. Just use the Clinton defense and your set.
@Cmoore704 @patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics You apparently can't because you are insulting millions of people on here. You don't know the difference between fact and fiction. You are all emotion and hate. Seems you probably login to Twitter just to look for a fight with a Trump supporter. Life can be better than this.
@patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics False. Stop pretending like you know what I think. I believe I said BOTH SIDES plenty of times. I think you just WANT me to be a trump supporter for some odd reason.
@patrice_noonan @Cmoore704 @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics Left and right are victims!!!!!! I am not a conservative or a trump supporter. Why do automatically assume it's one or the other. People can be against both.
@Cmoore704 @patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics I was giving you serious advice. Not one person in the media or politician cares about you or me. They use your fear and emotions for ad revenue and votes. If you don't want to see that and continue to be a sheep, so be it. Good luck with your life then.
@patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics 100% AGREE! Both sides of the press are biased and manipulative in order to gain ad revenue. So are you saying the press is the enemy of the people?		I wouldn't. The fake/biased news is. But not the entire press.
@Cmoore704 @patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics If you truly think this then I highly recommend stop following politics. You are clearly a victim of political rhetoric and media manipulation. I 100% guarantee you life will improve if you do. When you surround yourself with fear and hate it will consume you. Yes, I'm serious.
@patrice_noonan @mikebreslin815 @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics A free, HONEST, and UNBIASED press is. Will completely agree with that.
@patrice_noonan @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics My comment was to the original one "Its official, GOP is the white power party".
@KCofTOaks @RoKhanna False. AFTER 10 years if it's not continued, which there's no reason not to, then those people will see a shift. But for 10 years, they will see a cut.
@LacyClayMO1 *100 years
@LacyClayMO1 I wouldn't mind another tax cut. Hell, I would like to go back to no income tax like we did for 200 years. We only started this BS to pay for wars. Income tax is not NEEDED. Problem is you need to start agreeing to cut down the size of the government which I guess you wont.
@patrice_noonan @Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics Absolutely nothing to do with race to begin with. The majority of all Journalist that Trump calls fake news are white.
@realDonaldTrump Put your damn phones down! If you want a memory I'm sure there's an HD quality version waiting for you when you get home.
@Destinyuhva @jaketapper @CNNPolitics It's official, everything is racists to the left.
@RoKhanna Expense of the middle class? The middle class all received proportionate cuts also. Why lie?
@JWilla_ @ananavarro And you just did what?
@ananavarro Also said Jordan is cool. So your racist tweet doesn't hold up.
@thehill Obama attacked Fox numerous of times and called them fake. So if Trump does, so does Obama.
@CBSNews What could the possibly imagine a result would be from this? The only possibly outcome is maybe a few more votes for Democrats in the mid-term. But nothing at all with actual gun control would change.
@ABC He doesn't have access either. Why aren't you all telling the truth about this? You are making it seem like these records are readily available for you to witch hunt through.  This is disgusting politics. Confirm him and move on. He's qualified.
@thehill No. He's doing it because he found laws that were broken and it was withing his scope to do so.		But I do agree this has nothing to do with collusion. Manafort will get some tax evasion charge and pay a fine or do some small jail time and it will be over.
@ABC Good luck with that. Pretty sure we all know this won't be followed and Supreme Court will rule the opposite.
@cd_hooks Street smarts?
@SoutheastNative @AndrewMalekoff @thehill Not my God. Never suggested I support or voted for him.
@SoutheastNative @AndrewMalekoff @thehill I'm anti media. Anti government.		I want Democrats to win congress or senate this year to gridlock the government. But my personal political beliefs have nothing to do with this.
@cd_hooks Not qualified and don't want a pay cut. Thanks though.
@MyRedBeetle @vcczar @thehill #CyberBully
@cd_hooks Oh. You were referring to their GPA on their college transcripts? My bad.
@GiGiUSCG @PattyMurray I'll check back in a few days or weeks. Whenever you are ready.
@JohnBrennan @JaredHuffman @realDonaldTrump In a post about trump being childish there is a bunch of people calling names, posting lies, and disgusting memes. You have no room to talk. Being hateful is never justified.
@GiGiUSCG @PattyMurray I have and dont. He is qualified just like almost every nominee from both parties are.
@cd_hooks I don't necessarily think they are more intelligent. I think they just say what you believe in and you take that as intelligence. Same with actors.		But I do agree they aren't just dumb jocks.
@gorillastyle @vcczar @thehill Maybe LeBron shouldnt have started shit then. He blamed trump on something he is responsible for.
@cotie_vicki @JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta I agree in a way. When the POTUS is republican then the left media goes wacko. When the POTUS is Democrat then fox goes wacko.		Then when their respective POTUS is in office they talk policy and all nice and stuff.		All media is guilty. I don't like any of them.
@vcczar @thehill Donald and Melanie both has said he is doing good things. Just the media highlights when she does and doesn't report when he does. They are trying to split Americans and divide the nation.
@AndrewMalekoff @SoutheastNative @thehill Ever think it might be better for two world leaders to discuss this in private and appear friendly in public?
@SoutheastNative @AndrewMalekoff @thehill I'm not a supporter or voter. But I can clearly see LeBron insulted him and he insulted him back. You can call it whatever you want. The aggressor was LeBron. It's not debatable.		Now should Trump respond to every little thing. No. But I won't complain if he does.
@GiGiUSCG @PattyMurray What does this have to do with a SCOTUS nominee?
@RoKhanna The reason is taxes and regulations. What you are suggesting is adding more taxes and regulations. Do you not understand what you are saying?
@PattyMurray Do you have absolute proof that Kavanagh can and will revoke this? Or just using #fear to motivate your base?
@RepJoeCourtney Had this happen earlier this year to me (didn't fall for it). The scam is they can guarantee they can lower your bills by installing some equipment, but first they need to see your electric bill to see the numbers, then they can say we can lower it by xx.
@SoutheastNative @AndrewMalekoff @thehill I don't believe that people being bullied should just take it. I think they should always respond.  If you think a victim should just lay there and take it, so be it. 		The problem is you will never see Trump as a victim, right? He is always the big bad mean aggressor.
@NBCNews I'm for this.
@TheDemocrats Just #fear and #hate used to motivate. Nothing new. Just pandering to get you to vote. Blah blah.
@AndrewMalekoff @thehill Believe LeBron slammed him first. But whatever helps you post memes I guess.
@HeidiM_67 @PattyMurray @DNC I understand, just disagree. I see abortion is murder but really could care less if people have them or not.
@HeidiM_67 @PattyMurray @DNC Understand. But if you pay attention to the messages put out by Democrat politicians they rarely use the word abortion. They always refer to it as women reproductive rights because abortion just sounds nasty. It's a better term to use.
@aulett @RepAdams @HBCUCaucus @ncatsuaggies Look for qualified talent. Not diverse talent. Race and sex have nothing to do with. People either have interests in engineering or they don't.
@BSA_Foundation @ncatsuaggies @ITI_TechTweets @InternetAssn @HBCUCaucus @RepAdams Why are you trying to force people that don't want to learn a specific skill to learn it? Fact is people are different and have different interests. Who cares what race/sex they are? Really? What does it matter?
@thehill So LeBron tweeted first and he responded. So he was following the golden rule, right?
@CatTiara2 @davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump How? What federal bill has passed that helped LGBT the LGBT community over the last years? He might talk a lot. But nothing has actually been DONE in Congress. Which is where you judge the results.
@CatTiara2 @davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump Congress hasn't been working for a while. The only action from Congress has really been from the Republicans. For obvious reasons. Democrat Congressman don't have any accomplishments for years now. Would like to hear of 1 or 2. Not sure what you could be possibly referring to.
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump Opinion.	Opinion.	Opinion.		Were you elected to just insult people with opinions? Seriously have nothing better to do with the gift you were given to represent people than to insult people on Twitter? You're no better than Trump if you do this.
@GKButterfield @BarackObama Odd I follow most politicians and you are the first I've seen mention this.
@KikiFoow @PattyMurray @DNC I'm an Independent first off, so I'm not a follower. But I am not going to have a conversation with a #cyberbully who just wants to insult people to make themselves sleep better at night. Muted.
@KikiFoow @hardball I'd recommend stop following politics. You seem deeply effected by media manipulation and political rhetoric. I don't believe you can handle what is going on. Your life will improve greatly if you stop following politics. When you surround yourself with hate, it consumes you.
@Trumpcrazytrain @CanelliLisa @SenBlumenthal I'm the type of person who still believes in innocent until proven guilty. I've seen zero evidence of collusion presented and that's how I form my decision. If he is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt than I am all for whatever punishment is necessary. I'm not a Trump supporter.
@KikiFoow @CanelliLisa @SenBlumenthal @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Stop lying to yourself. You know NONE of these charges have anything to do with collusion. Manafort will either pay a fine for tax evasion or go to jail for a small period. That is all that will come of this.		To think otherwise you must be highly manipulated by the media.
@TIME Using race to get votes. Need to wake up @SenWarren. The majority disagree with you on identity politics.
@CanelliLisa @SenBlumenthal When the investigation is over and he is cleared will you understand then this it was OK?
@SenBlumenthal Didn't you already vote no before he was announced as the candidate? To me, that means everyone in your state doesn't have a right to know. You've already spoke for them.
@hardball What do you you think #VoteBlue and #BlueWave is? There is a base on both sides who vote with party lines only. Don't be dishonest.
@PattyMurray You used the word abortion! Going to get in trouble with the @dnc for not following taking points and using the correct verbiage to make it sound less like killing. Women's reproductive rights is the democrats term.
@bstnboy @thehill @JimAcosta It wasn't racist. That's dishonest and degrading towards the meaning of the word. But I'm assuming you will call me racist now.
@panda08x @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Whens the last time you have foreign soldiers on your land?
@JayandChrissy2 @deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta I get it and found it funny.		My only point is when you mix entertainment and jokes with what is supposed to be an unbiased journalism network you confuse on what's supposed to be fact/news or not.		Understand that point?
@Bongsong2 @Mannix1925 @thehill I do not agree with that by any means. I don't think he is a racist, I don't think trump is a racist, I don't think Dan rather is a racist, I don't think Don lemon is a racist.		I just think there's double standards when defining racism.
@AnthonyWislar @thehill @JimAcosta I completely understand. Trumps was a tweet also and not a press release.
@AnthonyWislar @thehill @JimAcosta CNN only does news segments. That's seems very obvious.
@PyrrhosPal @JohnKasich @KingJames @realDonaldTrump Exactly. 		When the NFL players decided to start sitting they were using their position as professional athletes at a sporting event to divide america! @KingJames said he supported them. If they players didn't do this then none of this would have happened. Trump didn't start it.
@deanster2u @thehill @JimAcosta Yes. He was watching CNN (which he obviously does and denies it) and CNN made a joke that Melania must have had the remote. I get the joke.		What I am saying is this is not news. This is entertainment. This is why CNN isn't taken seriously as an unbiased network. No journalism.
@RoKhanna This is just absurd. You think Apple / Google are only succeeding because they are in your district? If they only sold products inside your district I would agree. But we all know that isn't the case. This is the worst use of logic I've seen in a while.
@thehill This is why CNN is called fake news @JimAcosta. 		They aren't reporting the news, they are creating biased stories to attack people. CNN is not the enemy of the people, but stories like this are. Grow up.
@PyrrhosPal @JohnKasich @KingJames @realDonaldTrump LeBron blammed Trump for dividing America using sports? 		When clearly Kapernaek and the other NFL players DID that and LeBron supported them doing it. Trump isn't using sports to divide america, it's the athletes. They took a political stance while on the job.
@JohnKasich @KingJames Maybe @KingJames should be focusing on charity work instead of attacking the POTUS. We all know @realDonaldTrump will attack back when attacked.		Now to your absurd comment about Jordan. WRONG!
@stamford_molson @CBSNews No I haven't. But I also can't find any articles or studies that colleges are doing this.
@stamford_molson @CBSNews I don't think this is a white liberal college. Are you drawing that conclusion from the other/unknown groups? Like you think they do that on purpose to seem more diverse? 		Honestly asking. I didn't know this was a known issue.
@byrummark @thehill We could keep going to.		Dan Rather attacks Trump.	Don Lemon attacks Trump.		Guess everyone is a racist!
@RepDonBeyer A far worthier topic for you to be tweeting is how many people die a day from health problems and gun violence! Why can't you focus on more than one thing at a time! Very hypocritical.
@thehill LeBron attacked Trump.	Trump attacked LeBron.		Trump is racists.	Must mean LeBron is racist by same logic.
@stamford_molson @CBSNews Oh you are adding other and non-resident and assuming they aren't black. Understand. You maybe right, we will never know.
@stamford_molson @CBSNews Huh? We looking at the same chart?		https://t.co/4uuiqmKCpw
@stefanlizard16 @sandra88368461 @CBSNews I am guessing it's more along the lines of her boyfriend cheating on her with this other girl. Or something like that. Love and emotions cause people to do crazy stuff.		I just don't buy into the "because I am black" in a 55 percent minority school routine. It could be true....
@sammyboyfor @GovMikeHuckabee @nytimes @realDonaldTrump What does this have to do with anything? Maybe she calls herself Sarah to partake in white privilege? I don't get your point. Her tweets clearly state what she thinks about white people, men specifically.
@CBSNews The school is 55 percent minority. Meaning no matter where you go the color of your skin would not mean you look out of place. Why does this have to be about color? A white person would be more out of place here. Odds are there is more to the story than what is being reported.
@DaleroxyDa @CBSNews Who's says they are white? The school is 55 percent minority. Odds are they aren't.
@sandra88368461 @CBSNews I don't know. In a school with 55 percent minorities you would think that a white person would appear out of place. Maybe we don't know the whole story?
@RechecktoCheck @HuffPost Maybe because LeBron just accused Trump of using sports to divide America. Which is what LeBron was doing at the time.		I get he's a good guy. But he attacked the POTUS and the POTUS always fires back. Always. Not saying I agree. But this is the answer to your why question.
@EnablerAbe @AC360 @jimsciutto @JudgeJeanine Sometimes I don't know whether to laugh or be concerned for people.
@CBSNews Good people on both sides right? False, both sides are trash. Do not record them. Do not televise them, do not put them on social media. Let them do whatever they want to each other but do not under any circumstances give them attention. Please.
@clonedbefore @GeorgeM88937381 @brianschatz @sarahjeong Still going. More personal insults on the internet on a Friday night. Feels good, huh?
@clonedbefore @GeorgeM88937381 @brianschatz @sarahjeong Can't believe people are sticking up for this woman. This is just crazy.
@clonedbefore @GeorgeM88937381 @brianschatz @sarahjeong #CyberBully
@SilentSpring62 @TheLastWord She did not SAY she doctored or altered documents. She filled out the documents with the information that was given to her. She knew the information was probably wrong, which I agree. But she did not say she altered the documents in some manner that she knew the full details.
@the_edwin_mix @brianschatz @sarahjeong You apparently didn't read her tweets. There is no defending them with sarcasm and context. She is disgusting and a hateful person. But go ahead and support her.
@GeorgeM88937381 @brianschatz @sarahjeong Have you read this disgusting humans tweets? She hates white people. She thinks she is better than white people. What the hell is racism then?
@Sammyjkramer @brianschatz @sarahjeong That's rather racist of you.
@CBSNews Why dont you tell us how far away this was from the school instead of making this about schools and children.
@brianschatz @sarahjeong So you are supporting an open racist with disgusting views towards white people? You understand this means you, right? She hates you.
@HeyItsMeNiki @MrLSmith21 @CNN I'd agree politicians don't really care about anyone except getting votes. It's not just black.
@SilentSpring62 @TheLastWord Read the transcript. Not CNN headlines.
@SilentSpring62 @TheLastWord @TwitterSupport @jack Lol. You think this is an effective insult?
@RepRaulGrijalva The higher courts will disagree and will be thrown out. You have to know this right?
@geer_jackie @SenKamalaHarris And it this will get thrown out by a higher court. Will you still be glad about checks and balances then? There's absolutely no way this will still. A judge can't make new laws.
@CBSNews They never contain milk. It contains almond juices. Calling it milk is dishonest.
@THEmickmartin42 @benshapiro Because the media and politicians keep telling people they should. Not directly. But by race baiting they are definitely responsible.
@TheLastWord This is absolutely fake news. She did not say that! Dishonest BS.
@RosLehtinen A judge making laws at the bench, you support this? This is a tweet that should be deleted to save face.
@montanaisthebes @MaddowBlog Well I think every one of these has so far. So playing the odds it most likely will.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders No. I've made my point and my mind won't change. I stated an opinion. You can't argue my opinion. If we were discussing facts, sure.
@montanaisthebes @MaddowBlog It will go ignored just like all these "judges" orders. Take it to the Supreme Court and they will turn it down.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders No. You should be able to figure out when we have little taxes, regulations, and small government and when capitalism worked. I'd rather keep you guessing.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders If your only point American was able to thrive due to slavery I disagree so not need to discuss.
@politico Don't like it? Don't do it. You know you do.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders I am saying during those years capitalism worked due to little government, taxes, and regulations. This is my only point.		Why you are talking about slavery and racism I don't have a clue.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders Besides the slavery. Ya.
@SoutheastNative @king_jeremy_b @thehill Exactly what I thought. Can't answer.
@NakedDave02 @EnhancedSarcasm @BernieSanders It sure was. Might not be possible to get back to that point. But the greatest time in American history was during that period. More government, taxes, and regulations killed it. That's why I am highly against adding more to it. It's not the governments job or responsibility.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders Of course there has always been tax. But very limited. We didn't start taxing the shit out of everything until a 100 years ago. Before then the Country was extremely strong. Economy was the best it ever was. 		More taxes, government, and regulations killed it.
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders Might want to read some history. When the Country was striving and capitalism was kicking ass. https://t.co/qoMglLDcgB
@EnhancedSarcasm @NakedDave02 @BernieSanders I don't agree. I say less government with no taxes and regulations is how a Country thrives. We did it before, maybe one day we will do it again.
@NakedDave02 @BernieSanders That's the only response ever given. You can't compare two completely different Countries. Different government, different budgets, different medical costs, different taxes, different everything. I don't get why that part is so hard to grasp.
@CNNPolitics But but but Russians! Right?
@BernieSanders It's also a horrible idea.
@djrothkopf Can someone give me one verified instance of corruption please?
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill That is so equal to 17 million Jews being burned alive. Muted.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill Oh please. https://t.co/IHv8wAOhCi. I believe we are done here.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill That's a fact. Tell me another race that does.
@RepKClark @ACLU Maybe if your laws were better this wouldn't have happened. Or possibly the parents of the children bringing them on a journey to break laws.
@AngryBlackLady Putting your fingers in your ears for anything that you might disagree with. Definitely not the way to progress as humans.
@RichardTrumka This is how capitalism works. No taxes and regulations. Only when you add these things you are sabotaging capitalism and the economy.
@RepTedDeutch @RepMaloney @RepSchneider @RepDWStweets This will go over as well as banning illegal copies of music and movies. While I agree it shouldn't be available, you can't stop it and you know it.
@realDailyWire Way to entice more conspiracy theories.
@SoutheastNative @king_jeremy_b @thehill Wow. I'm racist now?
@SoutheastNative @king_jeremy_b @thehill Unless I see the full story then I will never jump straight to racism was the cause without proof. Is that so bad? I think what's worse is anything that happens to a minority we automatically assume it was due to racism.
@MeghanMcCain @TheView You're cool. But this show is toxiand needs to be canceled.
@fivo666 @thehill OMG you just attacked the media! Jim Acosta would not agree.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill I go to the zoo to see beautiful magestic creatures and ponder why the world is being so cruel to them by locking them up and taking away their freedom for others amusement.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill But you did anyway.
@SgtBarnes9 @LegitMikeFinn @thehill Exactly. They insult me everyday they report the "news". They clearly are manipulating people and dividing the county. I'm talking all media, both sides.		So if they get offended once in a while. Good. But being insulted is far from having their rights removed.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill You will never get to the moon with those. They look like childrens toys.
@LegitMikeFinn @thehill He wasn't standing up for anything but grandstanding. Her reponse to him was on point and I share her exact thoughts. He only cares about free press when it effects him. He just made some anti free press comments to Sean Hannity. This guy is an over paid actor.
@RichardHaass @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Maybe that should be done in private and two world leaders should appear to be friendly in public.		Just because you don't see some doesn't mean it didn't happen. Except collusion. There was no collusion! :)
@jasoninthehouse I don't support any ex politician or staffer writing books after they leave. There should be a law against profiting from their positions even after the fact.
@thehill Good. Please don't return. There's plenty of other people who want the job and don't just want to #grandstand
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill Have fun blaming all black problems on white people. See where that gets you.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill Never denied it doesn't exist. I said it does. Just most likely not in this case or as much as it claims to be.
@TomPerez Release all us criminals in jails that have kids then. Why do you only care about non citizens?
@davidhogg111 You lose credibility when you link to shareblue. That is not a site that provides honest and reliable journalism. Find another site with the same story. You won't, cause it's not real and not news. Stop spreading fake news.
@Nycewell @Baked_Bongos @PenceConscience @davidhogg111 Russians posts memes to cause hate and discord. It's ironic your reply is more bit like.
@davidhogg111 Winning? This isn't a game.
@RoKhanna That's because you don't know how to math. It's a horrible idea and the majority agree.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill I don't care. If you don't see that the media uses race baiting for ad revenue and the left politicians use it for votes that's on you.		There is only one race that blames all their problems on the color of their skin in the entire world. And only in America. I don't believe it.
@SoutheastNative @king_jeremy_b @thehill It does still exist. Just not as much as the media makes it out to be. For instance it appears you are rather racist. Always talking about white people. You don't know my race or the race of the staffer. You hate white people. Got it. Good luck with that.
@SoutheastNative @king_jeremy_b @thehill #racebaiting
@Greg_Ingleright @KKatMiss @Kris_Sacrebleu @DonaldJTrumpJr No one has said that he colluded with Russia. Can't believe people fall for this crap.
@PaulBegala @MarkWarner All our politicians, FBI, DHS, CIA, etc are. To assume they are not is wrong.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill Most likely none.		But do you know that this didn't involve a staffer who's boyfriend was cheating on her with this other girl? No you don't know.		To automatically assume it's due to race for someone being "out of place" in a diverse environment is ridicules.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill False. I am simply stating an employee of the school is used to seeing minorities. Over HALF of the students are minorities.		I am not saying they were right or wrong. But I am implying that the media loves to race bait and the majority of the time the whole story isn't told.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill The school is 44 percent white. Meaning its well below the national average. You would think at a highly diverse school people wouldn't freak out when they see a minority.
@king_jeremy_b @SoutheastNative @thehill Possibly. Depending on how it's done.
@SoutheastNative @thehill I can only relate to my personal experiences. This doesn't happen in my world. I'm not saying she was doing anything wrong. But she could have been constantly looking around. Maybe looked confused. Maybe looked lost. I don't know why you would jump straight to someone nefarious.
@Acosta #grandstanding #fearmongering #childish #celebrity #actor #biased
@thehill I have a strong feeling this isn't the whole story.
@RepBonamici It was preventable. Don't bring your child when you are going to break laws.		Also they are your laws. What have you done to prevent this?
@ChefGibson @NBCNews @Acosta @CNN I don't think he is innocent. Bet you couldn't find one report from him that has a neutral or positive spin from the white house. His personal beliefs are clearly present in his work and he should be neutral.
@TheTrueAmerica5 @NBCNews Could you imagine the right thought this about every pres secretary under Obama? You probably thought they were nuts right? Guess what.
@ChefGibson @NBCNews @Acosta @CNN You misspelled grandstanding.
@NBCNews I agree with everything she said.
@thehill Millions of liberals will rush to buy this. Ultimate trolling and they fall for it on every new bombshell book release.
@CNN I would agree. Shut it down and leave it alone for awhile.
@ariesjill @CNNPolitics Learn how to think for yourself. I think it's safe to say you are a victim of media manipulation and political rhetoric.
@ariesjill @CNNPolitics Yes. I've seen the stories from "journalism". What masters is the data presented in the court. They aren't going to be citing huffpost and vox. For someone who likes to correct people to make them feel smarter you sure don't understand this simple concept.
@ariesjill @CNNPolitics Only data that is viable is the one inside the court and you aren't there. Are you? I don't take news articles as reliable data. I'll wait for the verdict.
@ariesjill @CNNPolitics When it comes to maybe not paying taxes sure. But that is about it. Pretty boring.
@11Nigeltufnel @thehill Anonymously advocating for the paid violence against the POTUS. So brave.
@PattyMurray Abortion. Can't say it because it sounds horrible, eh?
@SenKamalaHarris You already voted no before he was selected. Your opinion is null.
@KamalaHarris You don't trust the FBI and DHS? Didn't you attack trump for saying something similar?
@brianschatz Only cover democrat rallies. Am I right?
@RoKhanna You know tweets don't count as laws. What you need to do is write a law. Not a tweet. Stop blaming other people for doing their jobs, following your laws.
@SenatorCantwell I wouldn't recommend anyone interested in coding to to go after a degree. This is one skill you can learn on your own and easily get hired for experience. Don't waste money on a degree. Please.
@TIME This is a conspiracy theory that Trump weaponized them. Ironic.
@SenKamalaHarris Helps to read apparently. So we can ask this but not citizenship?
@SenKamalaHarris Like on the census?
@teecres1 @SecAzar Isn't it better than no insurance and just paying a fine?
@JonathanYeagley @SecAzar That's the point. At least these people who chose this plan can have some type of insurance again. Are you just worried about your premiums? Selfish.
@KNDmex @SecAzar Shame on you for judging people for wanting cheaper health care since they couldn't afford any under ACA and chose to pay a fine.
@CNNPolitics They are more than Republicans. But both parties aren't even close.
@washingtonpost #journalism
@FoxNews What about all his 10k suits? eBay them. Problem solved.
@SenKamalaHarris ICE has facilities where they detain people? Are you sure about that?
@cspan @CoryBooker @Netroots_Nation Spoiler alert. #fear, #hate, #russia, #trump, vote for democrats in 2018 to make it all better!
@BettyMcCollum04 @realDonaldTrump Good. Roll back all regulations and all taxes. Let's get back to when capitalism worked and our government isn't sabotaging it.
@thehill Of course the culprit in manipulating these people would release an article and say they aren't. Duh.
@MattSimpsongpa @GovMikeHuckabee No. I've never been halted for pay while on active duty or retired. Think they always make sure we get paid.
@LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump You are missing the point of the question. The purpose is to separate the #fearmongering media and politicians to what is actually changing. The way you do this is by seeing what has directly effected you due to policy changes.
@joethekrow @Minecrafter47M @Dicofgods @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump It means there are a ton of people that don't pick sides or even follow politics. 100 million plus.
@badmutha44 @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Sure you do.
@Kapp4774 @joethekrow @Minecrafter47M @Dicofgods @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump I hope the left wins. I'm all for grid lock. But I just don't see it happening.
@stormchaser218 @joethekrow @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump He just listed things that increase with inflation. Pointless.
@MarkFrangos @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump The deficit has been increase since we had a budget. When exactly will this begin to hurt? This is not a trump problem either, it's both sides.
@Hazel37451493 @joethekrow @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump We get it. You think you are better than an entire political party and like to insult them on the internet to make you feel better about your life.
@Hazel37451493 @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Both sides do this. If you believe one party is better than the other, then they won.
@joethekrow @Minecrafter47M @Dicofgods @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Have you not seen the numbers on how many people didn't not vote for either party?
@LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump No. You need 1 sentence to name 1 thing. You still can't. Just 1 thing in your day to day life that has changed. Just 1.
@Minecrafter47M @Dicofgods @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Honestly believe there is no such thing as an independent? I believe their numbers are pretty damn high.
@badmutha44 @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Sounds like a CNN headline versus someone honestly answering a simple question.
@Dicofgods @LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Forgot there's a 3rd type who don't pick sides.
@LisaCheshireUK @boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump Can't answer the question. Got it.
@HHypocrisy101 @realDonaldTrump He should tweet that he sucks. Bet liberals would defend him.
@ChicagoMGD_SD @realDonaldTrump @MarALago @trumpwinery It's seasonal work and this is how resorts operate. Without it most hotels wouldn't be able to function due to the increase of demand during popular seasons.
@BaittyJulie @MysteryGirl032 @realDonaldTrump Cyber bully.
@boshemia @WINKand_theGUN @pjdiblasi @stormchaser218 @ungerbn103 @realDonaldTrump It does. It means nothing bad has actually happen but people believe the media and politicians that are saying it's so horrible.		That's why you cant honestly answer the question. Because nothing has negatively effected you or people around you due to policy change.
@aluker @J45Sooner @BlueJayResist @realDonaldTrump More than 1 person can be idiotic.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN I've read your "lies" before. You take an opinion and say it's a lie to up your numbers. This is why no one takes you serious CNN.
@thehill What are you doing celebrity actor Jim Acosta? You've been ranting non stop. Get back to journalism and report the facts. No one cares about your opinion.
@thehill I feel sorry for these people. The media and politicians are using them as pawns.
@CNNPolitics Stop being biased than and just follow the constitution and laws as written.
@eabarlin @RepJackyRosen I'm okay living in America where people have choices. 		Typical liberal attack. You want people to die!!!?? Seriously grow up.
@eabarlin @RepJackyRosen Now you are calling them stupid.		A lot of people voted for Trump because they were pissed ACA MADE THEM buy insurance or more insurance than they wanted. Now they can have choices back in their life. Why can't you just leave them alone? You're not their mom.
@CNN Just do it and get it over with so we can all move on.
@WhipHoyer Some people want this. Why can't you allow people to have cheaper plans? Are you against people owning cheaper houses and cars? Don't be so judgmental. Let people decide what they want to buy or not.
@eabarlin @RepJackyRosen That's not what I said. Don't you understand there are people in this world that want less coverage or no coverage? They want this! Why can't you let them have it if they want it. Be happy for them.		It's sad that you are telling other people what they should or should not have.
@Shinzo_Abe_PM Also all talk and can't backup anything he says.
@thehill You all don't trust the FBI and CIA to do their job? They aren't asking for more money and resources. Democrats are grandstanding trying to give them something they haven't asked for. Wasting money.
@eabarlin @RepJackyRosen Me and my family is on single payer for life. But thank you for your concern.
@clown_college Should fire the VP too!		Does that make qualified to be his running mate?
@RepJackyRosen Let's be clear: let people buy what they want or not buy anything at all.
@kdeleon Do you even math bro?
@HuffPost CNN doesn't denounce attacks on anyone on the right. So who cares. Over paid actors anyway.
@TIME Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. Could. #journalism
@thehill No. No one deserves to be attacked. But he is an overpaid actor.
@chaseme58 @axios They have been crying wolf about Medicare &amp; Social Security for DECADES. Anyone who believes it this time is a sucker.
@RepChrisStewart Does this bill include politicians promise not to constantly use #fear and #hate to drive people to the voting booths, I mean #depression and #suicide? If so, sign me up!
@KamalaHarris 892.		That's the number of times you tweeted about this.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro I'm gonna move to California and make plastic straws with my 3d printer.
@RepJimmyGomez @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Would you care if Russians flew over here and voted in the mid terms for Republicans?
@GovMattBevin No. I'm guessing it's taxes and regulations.
@MetsFanInPhilly @thehill @PressSec You believe he thinks you need an ID to buy bread? Who's story makes a hell of a lot more sense?
@SenMarkey #fearmongering
@MicahZenko @START_UMD Thanks Obama.
@valkyrie_hanna @CNN Might want to Google treason.
@bright_kolleen @CNNPolitics Some people want what this covers. Some people want no health care. Why can't you just let them decide got themselves?
@AP_Politics @AP Pretty sure they were released years ago.
@washingtonpost This is why no one takes you seriously.
@Barb36815041 @KyleKashuv It's already illegal to make guns you can't detect. Theses guns in question are detectable.
@CNN We are still stuck on Russia?
@thenicksinex1 @nytimes It's already illegal to manufacture guns that can't be detected.
@DBM_jayjay @thehill Who exactly do you think cares about you?
@Oldgma3 @KamalaHarris @GOP OK. Good luck paying for health insurance for no reason. It's not going anywhere.
@Ariesgirl401 @Acosta Same with mass shootings.
@Acosta @JoaquinCastrotx You are an actor / celebrity. Not a journalist, so you don't have anything to fear.
@Oldgma3 @KamalaHarris I wouldn't fall into the democrats fear trap. They have been saying Medicare is going away for decades to get people to vote for them. It obviously hasn't. They are just using fear to get your vote.
@Oldgma3 @KamalaHarris Oh no. You nailed it. Those numbers aren't good.
@Oldgma3 @KamalaHarris Excuse me but you read it incorrectly.
@EternalNyx @cspan Why? All you see is grandstanding. They never really discuss any issues and just attack each other.
@HuffPost This is just stupid.
@KamalaHarris You need to go take an economics class apparently.
@SenatorCantwell Need voter ID laws in case the come here and try to vote too.
@EvanAxelbank @Acosta He's a celebrity/actor, not a journalist.
@SenWarren How? Going to turn off the internet?
@thehill Why wouldn't water cost less than lemonade?
@davidcicilline How? Turning off the internet?
@ResistNW @thehill Well murder is against the law still. But I get what you are saying.
@ResistNW @thehill I'm not advocating for anything in particular besides there should be no ban on anything. Tax the bad stuff and if people decide to use it, then they do.		I eat/drink sugar too. Just in very small moderation.
@thehill With a credit card it is supposed to be. Right?
@ResistNW @thehill Now imagine if you reduce all the hard drug deaths due to receiving bad stuff. Which is a lot.
@ResistNW @thehill Let's say sugar is out. Now I also said alcohol. You at least have to agree with this, right? The cocain and meth related deaths don't even come close.
@ResistNW @thehill You need more research then. Sugar is just as addictive as these other drugs. Sugar is the primary cause for health issues. Go ahead and eat it and drink it if you wish.
@WSJ So we are banning the internet? Good luck with this.		Creating guns that can't be detected is already illegal. It's waaaaaaay cheaper to buy a real one than to buy all the equipment necessary.		Won't stop criminals. This is plain dumb.
@ResistNW @thehill Seen millions more die from sugar and alcohol and related health effects. That's not really a debatable statistic.
@ResistNW @thehill Should allow those too and tax them. That way the people that do it will get a safer product and it will cut down organized crime and gangs. I'm sure alcohol and sugar are close to being on par with these drugs when it comes to deaths. Let it be their choice how they die.
@bkjanik1 @DanRather @FoxNews Yes. They guess. It's a complete guess. They could be dismantling equipment and hauling away. Or could be nothing at all. Point is this is not a fact and the media is reporting it that way which is dishonest.
@MSNBC Apparently no one knows anything about how much it costs to make these, how effective they are, and how illegal making a gun that is undetectable already is.		This is dumb. You have to restrict the internet in order to ban this. It won't happen.
@RepJayapal Oh please. You really belive this shit?
@3uzfte @thehill Every person in the world has a right to an opinion.
@RepJayapal Says someone who spends all day telling people what to think.
@PieterJansen64 @DeepStateShu @realDonaldTrump Guess you still are part of the identity politics crowd. I can be against the POTUS and wild conspiracy theories at the same time.
@PieterJansen64 @DeepStateShu @realDonaldTrump Did I say anything to make you belive that?
@CharlesCrigney1 @CBSNews I don't. He could be crying from the gesture. If that's the case then he's well paid but under appreciated. Which is just as bad for someone that puts his body on the line for another to profit greatly off of.		I love the rock too. Not trying to take jabs at him.
@DeepStateShu @realDonaldTrump I think someone overdosed on CNN. Someone call a medic or something.
@HealthEquityDoc @BennettCollege Just say women next time. No need to add race.
@raiseupMO Good. Minimum wage should go away. It's a other government tool that's is sabotaging capitalism.
@CBSNews What's messed up is this guy doesn't make enough money to begin with in order to afford his own new trucks.
@bkjanik1 @DanRather @FoxNews There were trucks that were used for transportation of materials before seen moving. They had a tarp over them so they have no idea what was under it. That's the intelligence report.		Media says it must be nuclear weapons related just to make a point that Kim is better than trump
@JayThomasKirby @58Wedge @CNN What the hell does race have to do with this? You can't argue the point so you go for racism. You, and people like you are a huge factor in dividing this country. It's very ironic you do this on this thread.
@JayThomasKirby @CNN Why yes they do. They take simple statements and then change it to what it could mean, or what they want it to mean. Trump says some stupid shit. But the media will always take what he says and spin it negatively, no matter what.
@washingtonpost You are a comedian. Dance clown.
@realDailyWire Media biased attacks are "straight out of Orwell". Do you even Orwell Bro?
@thehill So? What's worse is how the DNC or majority of the media wanted Clinton to win.
@HuffPost #journalism
@CNN Apparently he doesn't see the media is greatly responsible for this and by him doing this, do is he.
@KamalaHarris Duh. Pay more, save more. It's math.
@KamalaHarris Only because the color of his skin.
@bkjanik1 @DanRather @FoxNews You must have not read it. There's nothing in the article that supports the headline.
@Big_Evil6 @pachydermparty @thehill I'm anti all media and politicians. So you won't find any arguments here if you are attacking any one of those.
@CNN She looks like Rosanne here. Racist!
@TIME What a dishonest headline from Time.
@HuffPost Your're the comedian. Make me laugh. Dance clown.
@Big_Evil6 @pachydermparty @thehill He's done far less than any other president in modern history.		Watch some MSM election night videos when they announce Trump the winner. They say, we lost. They say, it's over. They say, we are screwed. They say, everything negative.		Their true feeling shined that night.
@Big_Evil6 @pachydermparty @thehill Same as Obama did. Nothing new here.
@ABCPolitics Could anyone imagine if someone there tried shouting them down until they left?
@pachydermparty @Big_Evil6 @thehill There's a few instances. Obama even said you aren't going to do this in "my house" and kicked them out. The media nutted on him for saying that. Can you imagine if Trump says that?
@Big_Evil6 @pachydermparty @thehill Yes. I've seen Obama direct security to have them removed also. Trump is right. Obama was right. The journalists who are doing this are wrong.
@maddezmom @thehill @farnazfassihi @Acosta No. I've seen Obama kick out journalists too.		There's only 1 network that this is happening to. Everyone else is following protocol.
@thehill Stupid. Maybe. Brilliant. Maybe.		One thing Trump knows how to do is to reach his base. One way to do that is to watch Fox and friends then tweet about it. Makes people feel connected.
@Michael03244989 @thehill Free press doesn't mean you get full access to the POTUS whenever you want. Obama removed idiots like this too.
@Big_Evil6 @pachydermparty @thehill The event was over and everyone is leaving. Every other journalists figured it out. Why can't CNN?
@maddezmom @thehill @farnazfassihi @Acosta This is not his job. Do you see any other journalists from other networks acting childish like this?
@lesa_withane @thehill @Acosta Fighting? He's being childish and grandstanding. Do you see any other network doing this?
@thehill Put him in timeout for acting like a child.
@JN31621 @DanRather It's not even that. The intelligence reports say they have no idea what the trucks were moving because it was covered by a tarp. But the media immediately speculates a nuclear weapon or alien ships.
@bkjanik1 @DanRather @FoxNews Anyone that read the article should.
@DanRather The intelligence states they don't know what if anything the trucks were moving. I'm shocked to find out the media is using this to take jabs at trump.
@Sunnistorm763 @RHeightsFinest @Blaidmaid @KamalaHarris Most charges are pre campaign by a long shot.
@RepDonBacon Agree. Degrees are highly overrated unless you absolutely need one to enter the professional you are passionate about.
@RepSwalwell That's not how adults use logic and reason.
@brianschatz I believe every is. It's dishonest to suggest different.
@jaketapper @realBobWoodward Well at least the cover doesn't hide the reason behind the book. #fearmongering
@CongressmanRuiz Who says they do need to worry about it? Are you just promoting general fear?
@SenatorMenendez @SenateDems @NJCitizenAction Can you link to proof of what you are claiming?
@realDailyWire WTF
@RHeightsFinest @Blaidmaid @KamalaHarris I believe the indictments are real and justified. They just have nothing to do with treason or Trump.
@believer_blue @KamalaHarris What does race have to do with this? I swear you liberals are the most hateful people on the planet. I'd honestly recommend stop following politics because you to appear not emotionally able to handle political rhetoric and its probably making you depressed.
@MonicaLogallmon @KamalaHarris @washingtonpost @nytimes @maddow @Lawrence @chrislhayes @NatashaBertrand @woodruffbets @Acosta Because we have lives.
@dandd03 @KamalaHarris Hope you really don't believe that.
@59intrested @KamalaHarris It's just a smear campaign. They have access to what they need. They all already voted no so  I'm curious why they even care.
@PatriciaMarsol2 @KamalaHarris What documents? Any information they need is public record.
@marieann66 @KamalaHarris That's how it works. If they know that a bill won't pass or a a person won't get confirmed then they don't do it. They won't waste the congress time. Just think if they were required to vote on every stupid bill.		Personally, I think they should have had the hearing anyway.
@Miranda64A @KamalaHarris Like?
@michele_missner @KamalaHarris They all already voted no. Not even sure why they are talking about this.
@karen_brioso @KamalaHarris Should be getting tired of the constant fear and hate being fed to you in exchange for your vote.
@Clark408 @KamalaHarris @UROCKlive1 When the people he bought the season passes pay for pay him back. Science.
@WendyTruong3 @KamalaHarris Impeachment is a political process. Nothing to do with the law, court, or judges.
@RHeightsFinest @Blaidmaid @KamalaHarris Evidence?
@KamalaHarris Didn't you already vote no? Why do you keep talking about this?
@MarkAdkins1963 @TeamPelosi Agree. Both sides are the same and fear monger.
@Michellemonkey4 I don't know. Politicians and media on both sides tell different stories. The only truth is to judge my own experiences and the people around me. To which I can say, nothing has drastically changed in a very long time.
@CNN "The changes could end the...."		OH. So you are just guessing. This is why you are called fake news.
@desi_bova @AP @realDonaldTrump For enforcing laws? What a bad man.
@LuckyJ11 @TeamPelosi Must suck to actually belive all that. Hope it's not effecting you emotionally.
@MarkAdkins1963 @TeamPelosi So you not realize how many years democrats have been saying that Republicans are going to cut these programs? Correction. Do you know how many decades.....		It never happened and never will. They are using fear to motivate you to vote for them.
@Cinderella5280 @JonMFGalt @TeamPelosi Cyber bully.
@TeamPelosi Lie.
@TastyBaldEagle @CNN I'd look that up. Decades long legal precedent has been thrown out the door numerous of times. It was illegal to have abortion a lot longer than it has been legal. Just for a quick example. I don't see why you think I'm lying. These are facts.
@KamalaHarris YOU SAID YOU WOULDNT VOTE YES BEFORE HE WAS EVEN CHOSEN! Your opinion doesn't mean anything now. You already made  up your mind, right?
@a_team1983 @Jim_Jordan Too bad for you we live in a world that requires proof.
@thehill Good.
@TastyBaldEagle @CNN There is no where in that amendment that says you are allowed to kill babies. I think it's widely accepted by most constitutional lawyers that it was the wrong decision. Personally, I don't care. But show me where it says you can.
@Michellemonkey4 I don't consider one party or the other to hold the "truth". I try to look all past that and see how my life has changed. Which it really hasn't in decades due to new policies. My healthcare never changed. My pay did some due to tax cuts. My rights have never changed. etc.
@TastyBaldEagle @CNN Only big instance I know of is for abortion. There is no constitutional right for it. What are some other instances, specifically a conservative judge made law from the bench? Not trying to play games. I'm really curious on what you think.
@Michellemonkey4 I follow all the politicians feeds. The left is majority of just fear and hate. The right talks about how good the economy, jobs, etc is doing. It might not be accurate. But its policy.
@DragonEmpressEn @thehill You made fun of the "White Civil Rights" name. I just reversed it for "Black Lives Matter" name. Make more sense?
@Michellemonkey4 Don't disagree. The right did it all the time with Obama. Now the left are doing it with Trump.		Currently this is all the left is doing. The right talks about policy with a side of fear mongering.
@Michellemonkey4 @RoKhanna Had multiple conversations and I know someone mentioned it but didn't see it in our conversation. But yes. Before we started income taxes to pay for wars.
@JacksonLeeTX18 Fix your laws. Criminal action against yourself? I dont follow.
@Michellemonkey4 @RoKhanna I'm talking pre-taxing. https://t.co/qoMglLDcgB
@EricHolder Give them guns too.
@LacyClayMO1 @realDonaldTrump Where is he trying to suppress them? He's asking they follow their own code if ethics. Is that a bad thing? Do you want journalists to be able to do whatever they want even if it's dishonest or misleading?
@IronDixie @DragonEmpressEn @thehill That's what you come back with? I know you are but what am I?
@TastyBaldEagle @CNN Not sure if you are being sarcastic.		What I am suggesting is they don't get to chose when they lost their shit. People that lose their shit usually aren't going to willfully give up power. They should be given annual exams and removed if deemed appropriate.
@IronDixie @DragonEmpressEn @thehill Wasn't a contest. It was a reading comprehension test. Twitter goes from top to bottom. If you skip some parts you will become confused.
@IronDixie @DragonEmpressEn @thehill What part of the comment I was replying to and not the headline did you not understand?
@FoxNews @BryanLlenas Guess they are pro child smuggling, drugs, and gangs? What an odd stance to take.
@DragonEmpressEn @thehill Why are they counter protesting? Black lives don't matter?
@CNN Politics aside. There should be a maximum age for SCOTUS. It's proven that our brains and reasoning does diminish overtime.
@Michellemonkey4 @RoKhanna 100 years ago was not supposed to be exact. I'm talking the time frame where a family could live happily with 1 income, 1 car, 1 TV, 1 phone, no internet subscriptions, no extra shit we don't need. Because we didn't have 1000 different taxes and businesses has less regulations.
@lost_bills @boxfoxy @SamHarrisOrg @coldxman My tweet was to Sam. Although I listen to him a ton he goes off on rants about Trump and states his feelings which I don't care to hear. I'd rather people like Sam discuss HOW or WHY they have these feelings. Instead of just hearing anti-trump rhetoric.
@Michellemonkey4 @RoKhanna Sorry but that is incorrect. The only thing that has changed from 100 years ago when capitalism was working perfectly is the regulations and taxes, and of course this central banking crap. 		There were still wealthy 1% back then. Some were greedy, some were not.
@Netwebangel I agree it's not easy. But if you don't want to fill your life with fear and hate on a 24/7 basis it's worth looking into. Also you need to realize the majority of what you are reading aren't facts. It's negatively spun news for political purposes. It's better just to ignore it.
@thehill Some are. Some aren't.
@jaketapper Oh Jake. Can't get the difference between interference and collusion again. Stop being dishonest.
@RoKhanna Due to government taxing and regulations. Really should just recognize you are the problem. Go back 100 years when capitalism was working. How many taxes and regulations were in existence then? You all are sabotaging capitalism.
@SenAmyKlobuchar @SenatorLankford You dont trust the FBI to do their job?
@ColoDavo @RepPerlmutter Based on what? News reports and no facts?
@thehill I dont agree with most of what he says but I do agree the media has gone too far with their "journalism".
@politico Why does this person matter?
@realDailyWire Can't believe people keep getting trolled by this man.
@FarAwayDeb @RoKhanna Cyber bully. I know. I agree it needs to go away also.
@bobdiz2 @realDonaldTrump Should get out and talk to people more often then.
@RAY_G17 @realDonaldTrump Both parties are being manipulated. If you don't see that then you are most likely being manipulated.
@EarlofParks @realDonaldTrump How is it worse?
@the_d_in_seatwn @realDonaldTrump I feel the left is losing more independents since they are pushing socialism and attacking center democrats. But I do agree the right is losing them also. Just think more so on the left.
@teresa3llen @realDonaldTrump Very high considering the 24/7 hate campaign by the media. Surprisingly anyone still like him the way the media makes him appear to be the devil.
@LorraineDWilke @realDonaldTrump Ignore him then.
@Trumpgot2go @realDonaldTrump No one kicked journalists out of "his house" like Obama. Trump needs to up his game.
@ResisterSis20 @realDonaldTrump The man who will be hated by the left as soon as the investigation ends. Just remember how much you love and trust him now.
@RepDonBeyer Still asking for Obamas college transcripts too? Move on to something important that benefits us.
@RepTedDeutch How about comprise on bipartisan bills and take away his power. He's making threats of you don't do your job. If you do, then it won't be an issue. Get to work.
@FoxNews Really must have no life to do this.
@writerhaha @CNN #TrumpDerangementSyndrome is real. Seek help.
@the_pmizzle @jaketapper And? That means absolutely nothing. He is bitching about Trump who has nothing to do with who his AG was selecting. Do you think Trump should have told the AG which person to appoint? Of course not, so his whole Tweet is ridicules.
@CNN Could you imagine a CNN article about Trump in this context? Never will happen.
@RoKhanna Department of Education should not exist.
@RepBobbyRush More government in healthcare is never #abetterdeal. How about removing the 1,000 different taxes and all the regulations that are preventing capitalism from working as intended like it did 100 years ago.
@jaketapper You think Trump picked him? Are you serious? Why would the POTUS get to select the person to investigate his campaign?
@GovWalker Mine didn't go up.
@HuffPost So you are anti 1st amendment. Good for your voters to know.
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump How about you just stop looking at his Twitter feed. Problem solved.
@HuffPost OMG seriously!? Impeach! Racist! Blah blah. No one cares HuffPost.		Try writing political articles that have value instead of just #hate and #fear.
@KamalaHarris Please leave politics if you think this a good idea.
@lost_bills @boxfoxy @SamHarrisOrg @coldxman False. Talking about opinions is useless. Talking about how you form your opinion is not. There is a huge difference. Spitting out your opinions does nothing towards advancing a conversation. 		I'm not a Trump supporter either. I don't know why you would just jump to that.
@JoanLMB @DNC @HouseGOP Conservative judges are doing it right. Liberal judges are attempting to create laws from the bench. I will give you that.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro Perception = algorithm
@CNN They were rude and put in timeout. I don't disagree. The network could have sent someone else.
@MattSimpsongpa @GovMikeHuckabee Agree. Just don't stop my Military retirement pay. :)
@TheDemocrats Waiting for a reason to vote. There's no difference in candidates for me.
@GovMikeHuckabee I agree with less government, so ya.
@boxfoxy @SamHarrisOrg @coldxman There's a difference between talking about facts, logic, policy and just shitting on Trump. I'd rather just not hear the opinions and get to the source of the issues.
@SamHarrisOrg @coldxman I'll definitely listen to this one. Just hope it isn't just full of anti-trump crap and talks about real issues.
@thehill Who's to say some Democrat didn't order these for a photo op? Anyone have proof of the invoice and who purchased them?
@jonathanvswan Shouting questions after the event is over and asked to leave multiple times and refusing to leave is doing nothing wrong? Obama kicked out reporters for less and even refer to it as "his house".
@sarahwoodwriter @J2thaP_MC @joerogan The media is held to standards. That's cute.		Every single political news article I see breaks at least one of their code of ethics.
@timkaine When will you finally do your job and compromise on bipartisan bills instead of just pointing fingers? Your problem. You fix it.
@RoKhanna Maybe the Government should get out of the education game and stop subsidizing. They are the ones responsible for the high costs. Yet you have the nerve to blame it on something else and make a suggestion that would only make it worse? Really?
@akoonce53 @thehill Here's what I see when I read this.		#fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear #fear 		Vote Democrat is the only way!		Using fear and emotions to push people to the voting booth is disgusting. I hope you actually don't believe what you wrote.
@thehill Media manipulation is straight up disgusting.
@OneTrueChange @FoxNews @VP @MariaBartiromo It's very easy to rise up when you hit rock bottom.		Not trying to take anything away from Obama. But it's a huge difference when you start low and really have no where to go but up.
@brianschatz I will blame you.
@thehill Caused by the media. Good job.
@gypsysbloodrose @PattyMurray It's called abortion. I know it's hard to use the right word because it sounds horrible.
@bsain57 @PattyMurray @lynnaeadele Stop voting for people that fill your Twitter feed with fear and hate to get you to emotionally vote for them and their party is a start.
@Secrtsquirrel33 @SenJeffMerkley Anyone voting for more government and regulations doesn't understand how the economy works.		Compare 1950s economy to now. The biggest change is regulations and more government. They are killing capitalism.
@MontyBoa99 @SenJeffMerkley You believe this is a bad thing?
@SenJeffMerkley Large government and regulations. Politicians arent letting capitalism work properly like we did in the 1950s. But you have to know you are the problem, right?
@AmyOddo @ChrisMurphyCT @tedcruz If you truly believe it's only about the money then couldn't we do a gofundme and raise 2 million and then pay these people to vote for gun control?		If course not! Don't be niave. It's not about the money. They had their values long before running for office.
@CNNPolitics Good luck. Those straights aren't going to be easy to protect.
@realDailyWire @josephcurl Really don't think using the world incident is a big deal.
@beecrab @FoxNews Think what you are smelling is called an opposing opinion.
@beecrab @FoxNews You seem like a fun loving person.
@PattyMurray Why did you wait for the damage to be done with your pathetic laws? You aren't innocent in this.
@TDPattillo Yes,
@scrltspdstr85 @nytimes No. But Google is free. It's well documented.
@nytimes The more diverse a place is the worse off it is. That is fact. Why would they want to do this? Very dumb.
@CNNPolitics Right. You don't know anything. Shouldn't you wait for facts before you report?
@shanemente @thehill Who says I don't? I am not on his side or did I vote for him. This story is about rude journalists who don't follow their own code of ethics.
@shanemente @thehill You seriously think journalists can access the oval office anytime they want? You seriously think they can just shout shit and refuse to leave? Seriously?
@shanemente @thehill Sure there is. For example the latest episode in the Oval Office where they are INVITED the female constantly shouting questions and refusing to leave. That is not the time nor the place. It's inappropriate. It was not a press conference. It is the mans office. It's different.
@LaineyBug923 @cjs3872 @CNNPolitics @FoxNews I'm retired Military and it didn't bother me.
@shanemente @thehill No. I've watched the videos and how they behave.
@LaineyBug923 @cjs3872 @CNNPolitics @FoxNews It's only going to divide us because all this crap info that the media is feeding us over the last 2 years. It has made people think he's guilty without a doubt. Only savior is these same people think Mueller is cool. So maybe if he says he's innocent, it won't be as bad.
@shanemente @thehill You say it's political reasons, I don't agree.		The reasoning is they are not following rules or instructions. They are disruptive and grandstanding. They are acting out so the White House will attack them so they can spin it back on them. They need to act like journalist.
@cjs3872 @LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics @FoxNews Politicians being linked to other Countries is normal. I will wait for the investigation to be over and accept whatever outcome is given. But until then I won't buy into anything that the media is reporting could/maybe/if etc.
@LaineyBug923 @cjs3872 @CNNPolitics @FoxNews I watch all news sources. Sticking to one side is horrible and you will be misled. I never said I don't think Russia posts memes on social media.		That doesn't mean every politician you listed and the 19 others are working with Russians for whatever purpose that is not clear.
@adrahayward @thehill I've seen it all. But I couldn't follow the story line after season 2. I more watched it in the background. I probably couldn't even name 3 characters and I've "seen" the entire series so far.
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics Maybe since the anti-gun lobbyist are getting more money pumped into them the NRA has to up their game?		I do agree with you. I'd like to see all guns vanish from the Earth. But you can't get to there from where we are right now without a revolution and I don't want that.
@ohcanadian @thehill My point was most administrations attack the media at some point. It's not new behavior. It's almost expected at some point. Maybe not to the degree that Trump is doing it.		I 100% completely agree that it should go away completely though. Without a doubt.
@adrahayward @thehill I'm not a Trump supporter so not sure which comment you are referring to. My comment was anti grandstanding journalist, not pro Trump.		Also, spoiler alert next time.
@cjs3872 @LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics Everyone has some type of "ties" to Russia. I'd really stop following political news if you believe all this gibberish. How many Democrats have "ties" to Russia, Iran, Cuba, etc. It doesn't mean anything.		It's all just #fear to get you to vote Democrat this year. That's it.
@ohcanadian @thehill Again. Don't disagree.		Obama has also done the same thing to Fox and it's reporters. One reporter was even arrested under Obamas watch by the DOJ. You could even argue that is worse. Trump has words but Obama had actions.		If your only point is Trump is a turd. I agree.
@ohcanadian @thehill Don't disagree. I am not a Trump supporter or voter.		My only point was these two journalist have been grandstanding and not following simple rules at the White House. If they acted respectfully like all the other journalist there this wouldn't be an issue.
@ohcanadian @thehill Show me the proof he knew the reporter was disabled. He's made this same gesture of occasions. This is how he mocks people.		I'm not saying I agree with it. I think it's wrong. But the fact is he didn't know he was disabled and was just using his normal mocking gesture.
@ohcanadian @thehill Oh. You still believe in this. Thought we moved passed this 2 years ago. Well most of us have. Guess there are some who still believe every headline and manipulative story. Good luck.
@shanemente @thehill This has nothing to do with the first amendment. What are you even talking about?
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics You think politicians are bought by NRA, right? So you know most received 2k as campaign contributions, right? If it's about money, like you say, why doesn't someone pay them 2.5k to vote for gun control? Problem solved.
@thehill I agree. They are there to make a name for themselves and not really journalism. They are rude, disruptive, and show no class or respect.
@stopbeingaderp @FoxNews @JohnJamesMI @POTUS I agree. Point that I was making is it's easier to go improve when you start at rock bottom. A real challenge is maintaining it or improving on something that is already working.
@stopbeingaderp @FoxNews @JohnJamesMI @POTUS How original.
@davidcicilline You think this will prevent people from doing it? Now only criminals will print weapons and those are the ones you don't want with guns. This legislation would do NOTHING. Seriously a waste of time.
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics So you don't understand what the federalist papers were, got it.
@JoanLMB @DNC @HouseGOP Wow. You think a judges job is to make new law? Guess you didn't get civics in high school.		Congress makes laws.	Judges interpret laws.	Executive enforces.		To give a branch more power than what the constitution lays out is absurd.
@JoanLMB @DNC @HouseGOP False. Judges job is to interpret the law as written without bias, personal beliefs, or political sway.
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics I don't think the federalist papers agree with you.
@JoanLMB @DNC @HouseGOP Both are on record with opinions. Point is they are picking which ones are able to leave personal opinions away from the job based on politics.
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics But the 2nd amendment is correct and needs to be adjusting with time? Ok...
@maddestdad @thehill Typically white racist KKK men don't date black females and let their daughters marry a Jew and then hire that Jew to work with you. Usually frowned upon in the KKK community. Goes against all their beliefs.		But whatever. Have a good day and thanks for the  civil conversation.
@maddestdad @thehill That's where we will not agree. I do not believe any racists people are in the White House. The policies they are doing are the same others have in the past. It's no different.		I do see the media going 24/7 trying to label them as such. But I do not believe or agree with that.
@maddestdad @thehill Advocating for genocide is as bad as thousands of people actually getting murdered and raped a day by people off all political beliefs?		We all know the KKK is never going to get strong enough to kill off large amounts of people. It's talk. It's dumb. It will never happen.
@JoanLMB @thehill Think you are missing the reason. The right wants less regulations, less government, less wasting money on paperwork and restrictions.		They won't be visiting these places. Most likely. Unless there is a known reason to. The companies who do due diligence will be left alone.
@maddestdad @thehill I 100 percent agree. My point is there are bad people in every party. Rapists, murders, terrorists, thrives, etc. They are everywhere. That's it.
@lind_jules @maddestdad @thehill If they really really want the data sure. It's not every company either if you read the article.
@maddestdad @thehill You specifically said THE RIGHT. How does that not put everyone in the same group?		I didn't put you in the same group as anyone. If you read my statement which says IF YOU believe this than the opposite must be true.		I've backed away from all that labeling BS.
@lind_jules @maddestdad @thehill Educate me on how LARGE corporations work then. I'm willing to change my mind.
@maddestdad @thehill If you believe an entire party is based on a small group of people then that means you are equivalent to ANTIFA and you are a fascist, violent and hateful.		Are all Musllims terrorist?	Are all Mexicans gang members and rapists?
@lind_jules @maddestdad @thehill They walk their lazy asses over and get it.		It's not like these companies will shred any safety violations. They just don't have to mail them off in a report.
@SilviaxLej @MallyBills @thehill I hope you never run a business.		While I agree it's more jobs. It's also a higher cost of their product or service that effects thousands or millions of consumers.		Really?
@JoanLMB @thehill You don't think there still won't be paperwork about injuries on the job? This just means they don't have to prepare and give them the info. They can still go get it themselves. It's not like they are allowed to just shred all documents. That's silly.
@maddestdad @thehill I wouldn't expect you to notice that both sides are the same. You have PICKED a side. That means you think one side is bad/evil or you would have picked them. You obviously have not followed politics enough to see what happens when YOUR side has control.
@MallyBills @thehill To roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to create jobs, money, etc. Not have a whole department focused on paperwork.		I don't agree with everything the right does. But I do agree in less regulations like this. They can still go in and inspect if they want.
@maddestdad @thehill I didn't say that. I believe all politicians and media are manipulating people.		Democrats news feed is 100% about voting, hate, and fear. Not so much policy. Same with the news.		When Obama was president it was the exact opposite. This is how politics currently work.
@CNNPolitics The right to bare arms. Nothing to do with how they are made. No one cares how they are made. You didn't have to register your handguns or cannons back then. They didn't care.
@LaineyBug923 @CNNPolitics A well regulated Twitter algorithm is very specific in the 1st amendment also.
@thehill Let's just be honest and not manipulate the news.		"A spokesperson for the Labor Department told NBC News that the rule change would not alter the agency's ability to collect information from companies on workplace injuries and safety violations."
@stopbeingaderp @FoxNews @JohnJamesMI @POTUS Really? Pick a date right now where you can't give Obama credit then stick with it. Won't happen because you can't. At the first sign of going downhill it will go on Trump. 		Also if Obama set it all up then Bush did too. Had to go low before you can recover.
@SenBlumenthal If if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if
@That_Crazy_Honk @SeanMcElwee @loveinthefields Yes. That's what I find more disgusting here. The media wants you to believe this so they don't specifically say in the headline. Then the thousands of people who don't read the article will think this, comment, and then sooner or later the majority are misled. Media sucks balls.
@FoxNews Good job media. Your making a mob with your 24/7 hate, fear, and discrediting campaigns.
@That_Crazy_Honk @SeanMcElwee @loveinthefields I'd assume the child will be deported with their family now and no reason to keep track. Don't think they will be allowed to be set free in the US. Especially after this.
@SenGillibrand Maybe people of color should do it more discretely? White people are probably just more scared of getting caught and do it privately in their own home hiding in their bathrooms.
@elwheeler2 @SeanMcElwee @SenCoryGardner It was done by another child. Not the government. ICE doesn't work at detention centers. What accountability do you recommend for the other child who fondled this one?
@KorossLaurence @SeanMcElwee @ShaunKing @ICEgov What does ICE have to do with this? They don't work there. It was done by another child.
@acipollo @SeanMcElwee Read the article. It was another child in the facility. But of course the media won't be clear in their headlines. They want you to think it was by some detention center employees so you get mad.
@DorvidGoldy @SeanMcElwee @inthesedeserts Death penalty of an immigrant child that doesn't even live in the country? OK. Try reading the article next time.
@janet_pesenti @SeanMcElwee @ICEgov Dear person that didn't read the article. ICE doesn't work there and it was done by another immigrant child.
@Ethankam18 @SeanMcElwee @SamSeder What does ICE even have to do with this? They don't work there. It was done by another child.
@AbominableLint @SeanMcElwee This was done by another child. Was sickening is people not reading the article and then blaming other people for this act. ICE doesn't even work at these detention centers.
@MuleSkinnerOkie @SeanMcElwee Legally no. But her father was contacted prior to signing and it's more like counseling documentation and not a contract.
@DonnaThorson @SeanMcElwee Your going to beat up another immigrant child that has been separated from their family? I get the other kid did something wrong, but really beat him up with a group of adults? Who's the sick one?
@Skysong2015 @SeanMcElwee From adults? It was another child. Read the damn article before making sick comments.
@kadi2730 @SeanMcElwee The immigrant child who fondled the other child? So you agree with Trump? They are all murderers and rapists?
@abouboz @SeanMcElwee You want to kill another immigrant child?
@lyndsayrehn @SeanMcElwee @wendylyon Read the article. Her father was contacted prior to signing.
@DodgersKings323 @SeanMcElwee This involved 2 children. No adults. Read the damn article before commenting.
@That_Crazy_Honk @SeanMcElwee @loveinthefields It was another child that was being held in the same place. Why? Are you going to attack another child that has been separated from their family?
@CourtneyMcCain @thehill Well he hasn't had a journalist arrested like Obama did. So I'd say Trump is doing better on that part.
@KamalaHarris So people get rewarded for getting a place to live they can't afford? And I have to pay for their mistake?
@thehill Why is her race in the headline? Race baiting is so 2016's. It's over. Move on.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump If it was a special counsel and could venture into money and friends it would be different. Pretty dumb comparison since the 2 investigations have different scopes. One was extremely limited and had zero power to get evidence.
@donnabrazile @RepSwalwell Pretty sure no one has pleaded guilty to collusion with the Russians. The real question is why are you lying right now to people?
@RoKhanna If they want they can always go to the library to learn more if thats what interest them. But most adults don't even use algebra 1 in their daily lives not to even mention anything above that. It's a waste of time in my opinion. There's more relevant courses that could be taught
@CNNPolitics Identity politics died with Obama. Let it go.
@RepWilson I didn't read it and never. How would you end gender based violence? This so woman on man violence? If so, call it what it is, violence. There's no need to be gender specific. Identity politics are so 2016. We have moved on.
@thehill No thanks. Need someone more center.
@SandyHaf @CNNPolitics And you believe Cohen? If he said anything positive about trump just remember you would not believe him. But the second he says something negative, you do. Think about that. Really.
@RoKhanna But Twitter can silence Republican Congressman?
@JackFuller52 @Genceallen @AprilDRyan @Millennial_Dems Obama most certainly did. Plenty of times he discredited Fox.
@thehill When it's a civilian is it really considered a protest? Call it assault next time. Use the right legal definition.
@nytimes Small explosion on the same street as the embassy. Click bait much? This is why people don't take you seriously.
@JennyHotFire @davidcicilline How?
@BuileDeargTGN @davidcicilline As long as its not under current investigation. Which some of the requests are debatable if they are or not. Clinton email stuff shouldn't be. But some of the Russian stuff they are asking for can be viewed that way.
@MichelleFogus @davidcicilline @emsawarrior From the DOJ? I highly disagree with this but if anyone is closer to obstruction it's the DOJ and not congress. There's no way he is getting impeached. But let's say it happens. It will not not stop the Mueller investigation or change it in anyway.
@NRutman @davidcicilline Google it. Don't ask to be told what to do and think. While you are there check out the definition of traitor because you used it wrong.
@judy4makeup @davidcicilline Just as dumb as that the Republicans are doing.
@davidcicilline So the documents with Hillarys emails are still under investigation? That's part of this.
@realDumbJTrump @qussy17 @washingtonpost All if congress.
@JoaquinCastrotx @BetsyDeVosED Can we just shut down the department and handle education locally?
@cheapandvulgar That's not how this works. You came at me calling me a liar. Prove it.
@cheapandvulgar I believe I stated facts. 		The dude is a turd. - fact	Conservative channels get punished more on YouTube. - fact		Feel free to prove me wrong instead of personal insults.
@thehill Good. Hope that poison goes out of business.
@cheapandvulgar Affirmative.
@thehill As disgusting as this guy is YouTube never punishes people on the crazy left. Biased.
@LA2LAChef Please review how many votes it takes for impeachment if that is your worry. There is 0 people on this planet, well I guess you, that thinks he will get impeached. Seriously? That is why you think this is an attack on Mueller? You think Democrats are going to vote for this? Wow.
@LA2LAChef @RepJayapal @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Very nice proof there. An insult and your opinion. Why would you assume I watch FOX? Typically when someone can't up their claim and just throw insults they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. I'll wait for you to connect the dots to Mueller. Good luck.
@LA2LAChef @RepJayapal @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump It's an attack on the DOJ for not proving Congress with requested documents.  I don't understand how you make the leap to the Mueller investigation. Please help me understand if I am wrong.
@RepJayapal @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump This isn't an attack on the Mueller investigation. Why are you lying?
@MaddowBlog So? What's your point? Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia
@PattyMurray Why won't you call it ABORTION? Sounds too nasty? Maybe it is.
