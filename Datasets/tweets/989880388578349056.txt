Speaker #4 a bit fired up. We love the enthusiasm. Speaker #5 suggests a NO vote is a self induced harm for the city economically
I would score speaker #3 as off topic but solid plug for "jobs for CLT"
If city of Charlotte stays under $50M budget then they get to keep items they purchased. Police still using items from 2012 DNC
#RNC2020 #CLTCC If grant is not awarded by congress, "that might effectively kill modern political conventions". Since 2004 they have appropriated these funds. Furthermore CLT has negotiated a right to terminate if not procured by March 1, 2020. Would be able to cancel convention
City obligations: 	-participate in developing traffic control plan	-develope comma and technology plan	-solid waste	-(primary area) law enforcement and public safety. Take 1.5 years to develop and execute this plan. Congress provides $50M to host cities.
