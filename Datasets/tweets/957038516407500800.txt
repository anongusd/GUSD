@Parker_Rush @wvamountaingir1 @rebeccaballhaus @maggieNYT I'm guessing the "Accountant" pays the bills, not Melania nor Donald. I think #Cohen is lying. A second mortgage? That's outlandish.Trump probably has properties everywhere, which means many mortgages.

@glitterophelia Wow! They are really giving you a hard time! What part of homeless they are not getting!	Oh, I thought you said someone gave you a car. 	You should keep a diary and make a book out of it!
@glitterophelia Usually, it takes 2-3 times. They are known to deny it the first time. That's why a SSD attorney is helpful. I tried on my own a couple of times, but I also didn't know what I do now. Keep all doc appts, all med paperwork, letters from doctors. SSD love seeing letters from docs.
@glitterophelia Man, that is so painful. Ugh!
@glitterophelia Ouch! I have to wear a brace as well. Plus a boot and braces for other parts. We are all set for Halloween. I call it my Cyborg look, just need a cool helmet.

@DarleneCypser @PattyMurray @HouseDemocrats Good. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @HouseDemocrats don't care abt the citizens, their fight is abt #hate They don't care abt #taxpayers Ppl forget this extends to schools,separate educ classes WE pay for, teachers, signage everywhere in Spanish, phone responses. This isn't Mexico!
@PattyMurray Let's not forget, US Citizens #taxpayers pay for the separate classes, hiring Spanish teachers to educate thm. Also ALL the signage in Spanish bcuz they don't speak English &amp; phone responses which is annoying as hell. #taxpayers #taxpayers pay for ALL.

@ERshitmagnet If a patient is already taking a prescription and it has refills , yes, it can be refilled. If the prescription date runs out, all a pharmacy does, is contact the doctor and they fill out a form to reinstate it. That's it.
@ERshitmagnet Not if someone is allergic to it. Are you having a bad day? Sounds like you're in a rage mood. Are you a doctor?
