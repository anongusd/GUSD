Pres. Obama won among early voters, Romney won among absentee voters, &amp; the candidates split evenly on Election Day http://t.co/pMKSbp8X
Romney won among Independents, but not by enough to overcome the	Democratic advantage in the electorate http://t.co/pMKSbp8X
The partisan makeup of the electorate in 2012 was closer to 2008 than either	2004 or 2000 http://t.co/pMKSbp8X
Romney lost Asians by the greatest margin in recent history, a greater margin than he lost Hispanics http://t.co/pMKSbp8X
Romney lost among African-Americans by roughly the same margin as John McCain &amp; by a greater margin than George W. Bush http://t.co/pMKSbp8X

Romney won a larger share of the white vote than either John McCain or George W. Bush http://t.co/pMKSbp8X
Romney won white voters 59-39, the highest % of any Rep. challenging an incumbent POTUS. Yet that was not enough to win the popular vote.
