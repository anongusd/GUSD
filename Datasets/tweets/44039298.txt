@lindaholmes I should have clarified that we were watching that game on TV so your story is cooler than ours!
So I’m also happy for Moose and everyone else who was elected to the HOF.  You were good at baseball and baseball is good!
Carl Everett broke it up with a single and we cheered but I’ve always felt bad about it because Mike Mussina seemed like such a good guy.  In my defense the Red Sox had not won the World Series at this point so I was not yet a real person with access to a full range of emotions.
Moving on, in 2001 @KenTremendous and I were watching when Mike Mussina was one out away from a perfect game against the Red Sox (from 01-05 I mostly watched baseball with @KenTremendous).
If there was ever someone who deserved unanimous induction it’s a Yankee who can be that cool about the Red Sox.  Congrats, Mo!
Anyway, the day Mariano tipped his cap was the day I went from irrationality hating him for his excellence to rationally loving him for his humanity.  Also, how great are his quotes about that day? https://t.co/llhV1IEPdf
Side note: a moment I did not see live was Rivera blowing the game four save in the ALCS.  I had tickets but did not attend bc I had been at the Aaron Boone game in ‘03 well as games one and three in ‘04 and I was certain they could not win if I was present.  So you’re welcome!
Everyone thought it was hilarious but the best thing was SO DID MARIANO RIVERA who laughed and tipped his cap.  It’s one of the greatest sports moments I’ve ever seen live.
In 2005 @KenTremendous and I were at Fenway the day the Red Sox got their World Series rings. The crowd booed each visiting Yankee as they were introduced but famously gave a standing ovation to Mariano as thanks for blowing two post season saves

I always said that when we won the Big Ten West we would do it with TWO GAMES TO SPARE!!!!!!! https://t.co/P6jyEqv01M
Also, it's fun to use this website to say nice things about people!
The purpose of this thread (my first by the way) is to let anyone who is a fan of Adam or Sarah know that they are good people.  And not just to me.  All I have ever heard about them since the first time I heard their names is that they were good people.
This weekend Sarah received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  I am so happy for her.  She's been great forever.
Then, for real, she asked us if we played Wiffle Ball and when we said yes she pulled a bat and some balls out of her trunk and we played in the parking lot until someone came out and asked us to stop.
And BEFORE I was on SNL I was living in LA with my brother.  We had just seen a friend perform at a comedy club and on the way to our car saw Sarah in the parking lot.  We introduced ourselves and she warmly exclaimed, "My parents told me there were some Bedford boys in town!"
I sat in his office and he asked me about my upbringing and gave me sage and kind words about SNL that I never forgot.  He's the best.  A few years ago Adam was on Late Night and we talked about growing up in the same place.  It's one of my favorite interviews.
But here's the important part.  After I was hired at SNL I had a general meeting with one of the executives at Adam's production company Happy Madison.  I had no expectation of meeting Adam but on the way out the door I heard his familiar voice bellow, "Get that NH kid in here!'
But then, just a few years later, Sarah Silverman was hired on SNL and she was from Bedford proper!  No one I knew had ever met Adam but I had friend who had met Sarah.  Watching her first weekend update feature gave me goosebumps.
Adam was in a sketch called "What's the Best Way" about New Englanders giving directions. https://t.co/tY89jwaeTo There was a reference to the Jordan Marsh in Bedford.  At the time hearing my hometown on SNL was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me.
In H.S. I saw Adam do a set on Letterman https://t.co/xueyheeE36 I would have loved it no matter what but I loved it even more bc Adam is from Manchester, NH, one town over from where I lived in Bedford. Then he became a star on SNL, my favorite show.  This was a big deal.
Adam Sandler's new Netflix special 100% Fresh is fantastic.  Hilarious all the way through and yet also wonderfully sentimental.  So much so that I'd like to say a few sentimental words about how much Adam has meant to me over the years.
Tracy Morgan is a consistently great talk show guest and last night was no exception.  https://t.co/mKLeEPk93A

Well, glad we didn't try a FG from the 34 earlier
Also RIP momentum
Heads held high on both sides, everyone!* *except for man who failed to flip coin.
@thejoshpatten Meet The Press HAS to start on time
Often the man who throws 2 Hail Marys in one drive has the same impact on the outcome of a game as the man who can't make a quarter flip.
The THIRD team that gives up a Hail Mary to the Packers by not having someone in front of the WR is going to have some explaining to do.
This means we don't have to talk about the PI call all week!!!!!
Well you just knew it would be Janis (sp?)
That Aaron Rodgers throw was insane.
Carson Palmer was due a weird deflected TD.

I wish we could hear the coin Mike Carey flips before giving his opinion.
If Tomlin kicked FG because Ben was hurt that would make a ton of sense.
So I guess you're better off with Landry starting, Ben coming off bench than vice verse.
I'm aggressive except when I'm the opposite #Tomlin
Reverse was originally drawn up for Villanueva
My fear is that, based on ONE play, Tomlin will abandon the Jones/Villanueva combo
