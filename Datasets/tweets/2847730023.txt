Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life. This could be your lucky day to accept Him as your personal Lord and Savior.
I can confirm that God makes a way where there seems to be no way.
God will wreck your plans when he sees that your plans are about to wreck you.
Salt and Light	 “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.	 Matthew 5: 13-16
You have not lived until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.
The world asks: “What does a person own?” God asks, “How does a person use what he or she has	been given?”
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. Mathew 11:12
John 8:31-32. So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,  and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  John 3:3
1 John 2:15-16	 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  For all that is in the world,the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life is not from the Father but is from the world.
Stop pretending, just work hard, trust in God, be yourself and allow the seed of your true calling to grow.
