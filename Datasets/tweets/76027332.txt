DeSantis not only opposes the bare minimum of gun control and has called the bipartisan Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act unconstitutional ‚Äî in Congress he co-wrote a bill that could have allowed guns to get into the hands of the mentally ill and criminals.  #FLGovDebate

Ron DeSantis is a proud NRA Sellout.
A not-so-casual reminder that @RonDeSantisFL aired a TV ad teaching his daughter how to ‚Äúbuild the wall.‚Äù Floridians deserve better.
Just like Donald Trump, DeSantis demonizes and denigrates Florida‚Äôs immigrant communities:		‚ùå DeSantis refused to call out Donald Trump‚Äôs policy of separating children from their parents and falsely blamed a court decision	‚ùå DeSantis voted to deport DREAMers

More lies from @RonDeSantisFL - who voted to take away healthcare for people who have pre-existing conditions.
.@RonDeSantisFL wants to take us back to a time where pregnancy and diabetes were pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, 18% of applications for healthcare plans on the individual market were denied because of pre-existing conditions.
Ron DeSantis wants to continue Rick Scott‚Äôs legacy of denying healthcare to nearly 1 million Floridians - @AndrewGillum wants to expand Medicaid which we know will lift-up our economy.
.@RonDeSantisFL voted 33 times against clean water. #FLGovDebate
Every Floridian deserves clean water and clean air. @RonDeSantisFL doesn‚Äôt agree. He‚Äôs co-sponsored and voted for bills to gut federal water regulation. #FLGovDebate
.@RonDeSantisFL, is an election-year environmentalist. He:		‚ùå Voted against clean water protections 33 times	‚ùå Won‚Äôt commit to banning offshore drilling	‚ùå Won‚Äôt reverse GOP policies that cause algae blooms
.@RonDeSantisFL would continue Rick Scott‚Äôs legacy of gutting environmental protections. He doesn‚Äôt think  ‚Äúclimate change is not an issue for states to mitigate.‚Äù
