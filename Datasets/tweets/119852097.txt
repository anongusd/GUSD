@Storris It's not a question of statistics, there's specific science identifying anthropogenic sources as cause of rise in amospheric GHGs.
@Storris Sorry but I think you are just misunderstanding the facts here. Lots of uncertainty in climate but not over this question.
@Storris True--but lots of science shows rise in atmospheric concentrations due to mankind's emissions. Not much doubt @ that question.
@beingawesom To say we know nothing @ how atmosphere works is truly foolish. Can acknowledge uncertainty &amp; limits w/out embracing ignorance.
@beingawesom No, we also know direction of change = warming. Pace, distribution, severity uncertain. That's enough to make prudent policy.
@beingawesom List of pooly understood risks we have chosen to combat is almost endless--communism, cancer, etc. Judgment @ risk is possible.
@FriedrichHayek IN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS!!!!!!!!
@FriedrichHayek If you find cause for complacency in that article, your reading of it is highly personal.
@FriedrichHayek Comparing the weight of evidence for risk, not a close call. I ack. uncertainty, you have faith in ice. That's not Hayek.
@FriedrichHayek Hilarious that you dismiss risk of warming but hang your hat on next ice age. Relative evidence of risk = not even close.
@FriedrichHayek Atmospheric CO2 is up, temps are up, and you're 100% certain there's no relationship. Even Dick Lindzen doesn't agree w you.
@FriedrichHayek I'm not happy w IPCC or East Anglia--and that gives me no cause for complacency on climate. Hayek would get distinction.
@FriedrichHayek There is no basis to believe that doubling CO2 is reliably safe. Risks are uncertain but real. #nocauseforcomplacency
@beingawesom @FriedrichHayek Simply idiotic to believe we know nothing. Can acknowledge real uncertainty &amp; still make sound policy.
@FriedrichHayek  Funny how you have total confidence in skeptics and totally dismiss other side. Not the objectivity Hayek would expect.
@FriedrichHayek Berkeley Earth project included skeptics, concluded evidence for warming is unmistakeable.
@FriedrichHayek You are grossly overstating your case. #nocauseforcomplacency
@FriedrichHayek Have written extensively on flaws of conventional climate policy--and on better ways forward. Innovation not caps/taxes.
@FriedrichHayek So therefore we know nothing? Hayek would never have said that. All complex fields grapple w uncertainty &amp; evidence.
@FriedrichHayek Again with the advocate-bashing. You're only showing your own biases. Hayek would not be proud.
@FriedrichHayek Not a reason to have confidence in climate complacency. Can make sound policy in context of uncertainty.
@FriedrichHayek I.e you're not a climate scientist. Hayek would want debate on facts not your own biases against env  advocates.
@FriedrichHayek And your expertise to make that judgment is?
@FriedrichHayek Science is imperfect but much is understood. Are you a climate scientist? Puzzled by your confidence.
@FriedrichHayek You are making same mistake repeatedly; do not confuse sins of advocates w merits of issue, they are entirely unrelated.
@FriedrichHayek Again, straw man, not my claim. Climate risks real &amp; uncertain. Do not need perfect knowledge to make sound policy.
@FriedrichHayek I never made that claim. Climate risk is &amp; will remain uncertain and yet is real. Perfect knowledge not necc 4 action.
@FriedrichHayek Even skeptic say CO2=warming, just debate degree. Logically, creating atmosphere unknown to h.sapiens=risk
@FriedrichHayek Same logic still applies. Flaws of climate alarmists don't make a compelling case for climate complacency. CO2=risk.
@FriedrichHayek Again, mistake to confuse sins of advocates w merits of issue. Al Gore = serial exaggerator; CO2 = warming. Both can be true
@FriedrichHayek Many issues hijacked &amp; handicapped by misguided advocates. Not a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the issue itself.
@FriedrichHayek A little warming is good (for many, not all) but a lot is bad. CO2's persistence is a problem; it adds up.
