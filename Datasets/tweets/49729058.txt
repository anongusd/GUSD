True. But you only need one, and @dh_simba7 is the real deal. His only drawback is he only started for one year in college -- a fair detraction. But he has the arm, the height and the mobility to be a great one. And he comes up big in big moments. https://t.co/TPMSZAq4IY

I respect Fitzgerald for staying at Northwestern #Wildcats. Lots of coaches would have left years ago. He loves it there, and they love him. https://t.co/qaFAVbtBRS
This makes perfect sense. If you're the #Browns, why wouldn't you keep your options open until the new coach decides on his staff? https://t.co/o1qj1XfGdC
One of the greatest games in the history of college football. It had everything -- and I was there! Go #Buckeyes https://t.co/RtokyAbLxQ

I just watched @weddlesbeard on ESPN. I can't believe I'm saying this, as a #Browns fan, but I like this guy!
You are an outstanding young men. I wish you all the best in the next chapter. #Buckeyes https://t.co/VMXOD2dC47
This is a nice story about a tough young man. Too  often we take for granted what these young men do to their bodies to play a game that we love to enjoy from the safety of our couches. #Buckeyes https://t.co/hflcXhUHSB

I love Freddie, and if it were up to me, he would stay with the #Browns as the offensive coordinator. But he has been an OC for only 8 games. He's and up-and-coming OC. He's not a head coach -- yet. https://t.co/17qyhQ4Vqg

I know @saquon has had a great year, but it is common for rookie running backs to do well (see Kareem Hunt last year). What @bakermayfield is doing is historic. He’s got my vote for Rookie of the Year. OK, I don’t have a vote. But if I did... #Browns https://t.co/iCyJjJKbtP
This is a great sign. Now, about that new stadium... #Crew https://t.co/iXNeTpSztv

@TheFakeZwoG @bakermayfield Good point. It will be a great test, especially on the road. I live in DC and I have been to many #Browns games in Baltimore. I've only seen 1 victory. I'm traveling so I won't be there for this one. But I'll be watching.
And let's face it, the #Browns needed a change in culture. Drafting @bakermayfield, signing @God_Son80, and promoting Gregg Williams are the best things this franchise has done since '99. Oh, and hiring John Dorsey to do it all. How could I forget that? https://t.co/wZ1tEprSME
I don't love some of it, but I think that's because I'm getting old. @bakermayfield's teammates love him, and that's all that matters. That, and winning, which he seems pretty good at. #Browns https://t.co/yb06okUYhE
This is a huge game for the #Browns. Gregg Williams has plenty of tape on Lamar Jackson. Can he devise a defense to contain him? @bakermayfield will face #Ravens D for a 2nd time. This time, with a better OC. https://t.co/Xe5pO4og7V

@baseballot The AP has been counting the vote in every US election since 1848, and we have strict quality control measures. I would never rely on anyone else for the count.
@auspolsucks @baseballot Short answer: we will call it when the state certifies the results. The deadline is Dec. 14. NY presents special issues because SOS never updates vote counts after Eln Day, until certification. 	BTW, I'm happy to answer all questions about the process. Just ask.

When people are arrested they are accused of a crime. When you say that someone was arrested "for" committing a crime, you've just convicted them in print without a trial, opening you and your publication to a potential libel suit. It's one of the first things they teach J school https://t.co/4CF81mRPcQ
Finally, something in my wheelhouse! We called PA for Trump at 1:35 am, more than an hour before any of the networks. We declared Trump president at 2:29 am. (Wisconsin put him over the top). Again, before anyone else. It's just math. https://t.co/EJqR4N1MCW

NOTE: The special election in Ohio's 12th CD is too close to call. Republican Troy Balderson has slight lead over Democrat Danny O'Connor. But with provisional ballots still to be reviewed, the race could go to recount. The AP does not declare winners in races that go to recount.
He will have to do much better everywhere. However, it could just be that Dems did a better job of getting people to vote early. 	Still too early to tell. #OH12 https://t.co/kmOJJmKMXv

@KingJames can play wherever he wants to. But him leaving the #cavaliers for the second time shows that he doesn't care one bit about the fans of NE Ohio. You can worship pro athletes, but don't ever think it's mutual.

The key to #Baker is, watch him when he is under duress.He has what is probably the best O-line in the country. He sits back in the pocket for 4 or 5 seconds, surveying the field. QBs don't get that kind of time in the NFL. #Browns

Gianforte opens a 5.6 point lead in #MTAL That's mostly absentee vote BEFORE body slamming. Will ED vote flip it? Stay tuned.
With 20% of the expected vote in, we've got  a dead heat. #MTAL. I hate drinking coffee this late in the day.
It's a huge hole and if it holds, Quist loses. Right now in absentee votes in other counties, Quist more than makes up the votes. stay tuned https://t.co/TPfBT92kZm
Derm Quist jumps out to early but small lead in #MTAL race. Most of these votes are probably absentee, BEFORE body slamming.

Hey! #KS04 vote counters. Thank you for counting so fast. You rock!
It's official, from me: BREAKING;(AP) — Republican Ron Estes wins Kansas special House election to replace GOP's Mike Pompeo.
Sedgwick County is key in #KS04 race. It is more Dem than other counties in district, But GOP and Ind still have edge over Dem.
I would say more than a slight favorite. But like always, I will wait for the votes. I'm not much of  a prognosticator. #KS04 https://t.co/mUVP9CLwvD
And it's flipped. With half of the precincts reporting, Estes has the lead over Thompson in #KS04
With almost half of precincts reporting, Estes within 1 percentage point of Thompson. #KS04 officials counting faster. Thank you!!
Race in #KS04 tightens. With 1/3 of vote in, GOP Estes within 3 percentage points of Democrat Thompson. Looks like ED vote broke for GOP.
