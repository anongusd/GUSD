We're ready to create a STIRR with our new OTT streaming service starting in early 2019! 		STIRR will offer live &amp; on-demand content spanning entertainment, sports, news and more - all for free!		Today, we announced the service's leadership team: https://t.co/TqVxQWICZa https://t.co/ZTBfcmR4Jj
If you have any concerns about any of our content, we genuinely want to hear from you: https://t.co/fHYqYwcRCR. Above all, we are committed to fair, unbiased journalism across our stations nationwide and are truly honored to serve our communities. Local news always comes first.
When Boris’s segments are aired on our stations, they are labeled clearly as commentary. We also offer our stations reporting from the Beltway and beyond that are not partisan or bias in any way.
We'd like to take a moment and address some concerns regarding a commentary segment by @borisep that was aired on Sinclair stations this week. The opinions expressed in this segment do not reflect the views of Sinclair Broadcast Group.
If a Sinclair station is in your community, follow them on Twitter and Facebook for information and discussion on the impact of the opioid crisis in your community. 		(list of our station Twitter handles here: https://t.co/423uFKd6pr)
Sinclair’s reach and commitment to impactful reporting will help local communities stop the growth of this epidemic.  We are a news organization that is committed to making a difference by exposing problems, asking tough questions, and working on possible solutions.
This epidemic is a national health crisis. @ericbolling and his wife of 21 years Adrienne lost their son to an accidental opioid overdose. Since then, Eric has been on the front lines, battling the Opioid Crisis in America.
@ScottWRasmussen You'll see a "Number of the Day" powered by @ballotpedia in our morning newscasts - and these stats will delve into thought-provoking and newsworthy topics within the realm of culture, politics, and technology.
We're proud to partner with @scottwrasmussen to provide valuable  information to our viewers - complementing our existing efforts to elevate issues impacting our communities.
