@AshaRangappa_ The left has special snowflakes too.  The vast majority of people I know aren't comfortable talking about their politics, it's only people like the ones in this article who want to make a big deal out of it.
@CNBC Why has this network been slobbing on rich person knob all day?
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt WTF is CNBC's goal today, blowing smoke up every uber rich person's ass?
@dcexaminer What exactly is she supposed to do...?
@thehill Too bad it was temporary
@VanityFair They all sound delusional...
@thehill @HillTVLive Anyone election prescience this early is also well overstated...
@RWPUSA If they started yet another idiotic investigation their war chests would still overflow.  Why is our government being used for such a blatant and pathetic partisan tool and why are so many Americans fools enough to fall for it?
@GOP @HeyTammyBruce She married for money and doesn't care that her husband is raw dogging every porn star he can convince with cash...  Great role model.
@Mikel_Jollett Also, they are pro death in the case of Middle Easterners, South and Central Americans, "inner city" people, and anyone who even slightly breaks a law (except the President)
@GovMikeHuckabee You are mostly competing with comics though so...
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Nonsense
@rhowardbrowne @dcexaminer Part of being a conspiracy theorist is asserting something is fact without any evidence, as he is doing in this article...
@dcexaminer He shouldn't be a dirt bag then
@CNBC I can't wait for all the managers to comment how it isn't their job to motivate an employee...when it's literally their job
@jv_uk2011 @thehill The point of laws isn't to punish it's to foster a better society.  Driving people away from treatment for fear of punishment doesn't help.

@MarkPowell0728 @glen_1n @nytimes I don't
@John1_Welsh @NBCNews Apple isn't attacking this app from a partisan position it holds as a media entity it is responding to a complaint from a separate group which made an argument that the app's message is flawed and dangerous
@John1_Welsh @NBCNews Still a stupid point
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt That's not what he says in the article at all...
@John1_Welsh @NBCNews Apple has no obligation to host anything anyone wants to put on any of its platforms.
@MarkPowell0728 @glen_1n @nytimes The entire content of the article is based on a "common sense" and emotional understanding of topics which have a solid factual underpinning

@GeronimoJoe @nytimes You're right, stop the crap. Abortion should remain a legal option because making it illegal won't magically make it disappear.

@JustJudyJohnson @dave73in @thehill The USA helped their governments murder their own citizens, they deserve anything they can get from us.

@MCJalonick They couldn't have nominated a woman?  Is that really so much to ask?
@SenDougJones @ddale8 No one deserves to be a member of the supreme court, this is a failure of Republicans to thoroughly vet someone because they expected to just get their way before anyone could react and without a fight.
@ndrew_lawrence @mmfa I moved to the west coast to get a job not because I'm "troubled"...

@chrislhayes He should have some notes...
@jackiekashian "I talked to him like he was a person"
