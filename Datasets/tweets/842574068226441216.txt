@realDonaldTrump If YOU have no fear, let them in dear! But if you know well, that you did wrong, you will go straight to hell, so I suggest you be strong!

@SenSchumer @diversity4usaCL @realDonaldTrump #45 is such an embarrassment to OUR America!
It sounds like something #45 would do. Just putting it out there.  God bless our America! https://t.co/0iPY7Ratmk

A President that knew HOW to represent OUR America! We didn't care if he was a Republican or a Democrat. #45Almost3yearsofembarrassmentsofar. https://t.co/2meUhQAKeM
@SpeakerPelosi i just wanted to say, Thank you for representing us with Strength, Dignity, Honor, Empathy and Consistancy! That is who America truly is! #UnitedwestandDividedwefall
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I believe Mrs N. Pelosi should seriously consider limiting her strengths towards #45.  It is evident that Childrens and Family may be called in any moment to investigate the abuse inflicted onto him. #atasteofyourownmedicine #45
