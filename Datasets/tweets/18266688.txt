We already have a shady, false, political Dossier from @RealDonaldTrump's political opponents, so we don't need nor want Mueller's version of Hillary Clinton's Dossier. Enough. Close up shop and shut it down.
The shocking revelations about Bruce Ohr's warnings on Steele, the Dossier, the Clinton connections, etc are direct strikes on already low credibility of FBI, DOJ, and the FISA courts. The Mueller operation's credibility is also shattered.  @RealDonaldTrump should shut it down.
