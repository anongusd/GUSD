I, for one, was not ready for the gig economy turn that the Michael Cohen hearing temporarily took.
"Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt represent blockchain any more than a website represents the Internet," @WarrenDavidson says to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
Could be more crypto questions coming, Rep. Davidson just recognized for his five mins.
(He's more or less said this before)
A sign of the times: took this long to get to the first cryptocurrency question at a Fed hearing. 		Powell says he doesn't see an impact from Bitcoin or other digital currencies on monetary policy, says they're used more as a store of value but "not attracting much success there"
.@RepFrenchHill asks Powell I think the first question he's ever answered on 'open banking' i.e. more direct consumer control of financial records. 		Powell says he's not familiar with how it's handled in the U.K., but that, "It‚Äôs a very important and interesting issue here.‚Äù

Powell says he doesn't think community bank regs led to current disparity between rural and urban economic pictures. 		‚ÄúIt seems to be more the loss of manufacturing jobs,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs significant [city-rural] disparity that emerged really after the crisis.‚Äù

Powell throws more cold water on MMT, says the Fed can react much more quickly than Congress in response to crisis. 		‚ÄúThe reason why the Fed does [monetary policy] is that we can move quickly with our tools," he says. "We have a system that has lots of checks and balances.‚Äù
Asked if 2018 was a "good year," Powell does *not* take the obvious bait and break into Frank Sinatra's "It Was a Very Good Year," responds instead: 		‚ÄúIt was a good year, a lot of things happened.‚Äù

Rep. Al Green has basically asked Powell a couple times if Trump has told him how to land on benchmark interest rate decisions, though more for the public record than in a probing way.		Powell says Fed makes decisions to benefit all Americans, "without political consideration"
Powell, responding to @RepGregoryMeeks, acknowledges that rising corporate debt is also concern, but he thinks a rise in corporate bankruptcies would affect the broader economy more than the banking sector.
Powell says he's concerned about increasing student debt. 		‚ÄúThat debt can hang over their economic and personal lives for many years,‚Äù if it goes unpaid, he says. Has cascading effects on real estate and other markets that typically necessitate loans.

@peteschroeder Super stark, as Powell just emphasized. He also tied it to the fact that manufacturing activity tends to be a major source of employment in those areas and hasn't fully recovered from the Great Recession.
Asked as to whether more could be done to invest in skills training to help more people re-enter the workforce, Powell says, ‚ÄúI do think that we could use a national focus on labor force participation and that certainly would be a piece of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe gap between rural and urban areas in unemployment is not so big, it really shows up in labor force participation,‚Äù Powell says in response to questions from @SenTinaSmith.

@RyanLEllis But it was often caveated with the fact that markets can turn rather quickly, which we've seen play out in the last three months.
@RyanLEllis I agree that there's a lot of anger from conservatives at the media, but I disagree that Trump didn't get credit for stocks going up last year. The bull market towards the end of last year/beginning of this year seemed pretty clearly tied to tax cuts, &amp; was reported as such.
@RyanLEllis Again, I think it depends on what happens. If Trump negotiates a bunch of bilateral trade deals favorable to the U.S., I think that would be recognized. If markets turn around b/c people look around and see stocks undervalued right now, I don't think he'll be credited with that.

@LPDonovan @ATaLien81 This gets back to @RichardRubinDC‚Äôs favorite hashtag: #TRIH. Because of the scale you‚Äôre dealing with even tweaks designed to be narrow could still affect thousands of people, and thousands more might not fully know, which has an amplifying effect.
@LPDonovan @ATaLien81 Some of it could be FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). But some folks also account this far out for different reasons. Throwing out there more as worth further examination than trying to conclude something.
@RichardRubinDC @LPDonovan What Rich said above. I don‚Äôt think people appreciate that Texas‚Äôs property tax (maybe a couple other R-leaning states too) factored into shaping SALT cap, rather than all-out SALT elimination (in addition to trying to keep NE Rs in fold).
@LPDonovan Yeah, I expect it to be much more a secondary factor. But if you vote R based primarily off pocketbook issues, which I think is especially true of suburbanites, it may support, rather than drive, your decision not to in 2018.
@LPDonovan Potentially underappreciated factor in some of those House races: SALT cap hits parts of Texas a bit harder than people realize, because even though there‚Äôs no income tax, state property taxes are a bit higher than national average.
Fed keeps rates where they are, as expected.

Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin says he‚Äôll consult with his lawyers over any request, hedging as to what kind of legal argument Treasury might make if it tries to drag its feet on providing those returns.

@ElleBeyoud Didn't do great among middle schoolers, but FANTASTIC sales amongst CPAs.
Or maybe this is the last death of deficit politics, because a 10 percent middle class tax cut would cost....a lot. And the administration + Hill Republicans just took fire again for the cost of last year's tax cuts, as the deficit rose to $700+ billion last year.
Worth noting: This could turn into a choose-your-own tax policy adventure, where multiple more doable ideas are plugged in to attempt to keep Trump's promise and fill the policy vacuum left by the lack of detail. https://t.co/IOcN9EQapB

So basically, nearly everyone has said that the response and recovery to Hurricane Maria could‚Äôve been better ‚Äîexcept for Trump. And now he‚Äôs arguing about the number of people actually killed by the storm.
In a follow up report Politico published earlier this year, the retired Army general who commanded forces during Katrina said not enough were used in Puerto Rico. https://t.co/ULLpkk1G2r
The main criticism of the immediate federal response is that not enough assets‚Äîmainly planes and helicopters‚Äîwere provided to deliver emergency supplies in the days after Maria. The governor said this in an interview w/Politico at the time: https://t.co/3pswqHWy3o
Addendum to this: just yesterday CBS reported that potentially millions in water bottles meant for disaster victims in Puerto Rico may have sat on a tarmac during the aftermath. FEMA‚Äôs investigating whether it screwed up. https://t.co/7nBI4sGXE9
Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic situation‚Äîwhich is complicated and contributed to poor infrastructure prior to the storm along with $70B in debt‚Äîalso didn‚Äôt help. That‚Äôs a focus in Congress as well, and subject to a special federal oversight board Congress created pre-Maria.
FEMA has also acknowledged parts of its response that it could‚Äôve done better in its 2017 hurricane season after-action report: https://t.co/kZPpnUbjz6		Something that‚Äôs come up in several Congressional hearings on the response: distribution of FEMA‚Äôs resources.
The parallels to Katrina are there in multiple ways, where the effects caused by the hurricane contributed to higher human costs after the hurricane left. Like Katrina the local gov‚Äôt also bears responsibility, which the governor accepted with GW‚Äôs criticism in the above study.
That lack of power and water, combined with roads and bridges being out in some places for days to weeks, led to more deaths directly attributable to Maria and her aftermath. Comms were out for a prolonged period as well. Many sick and elderly who couldn‚Äôt get out died.
The majority of Puerto Ricans‚Äîwho some people forget are American citizens, some of whom serve in the military, but don‚Äôt vote in federal elections because of the island‚Äôs territorial status‚Äîwere without power or clean running water for months.
GW and other studies conclude most of the deaths resulted from damage done to Puerto Rico‚Äôs already-faulty infrastructure. Puerto Rico experienced what officials think the be the longest prolonged blackout in American history. Some residents only recently had power restored.
Study is here: https://t.co/2b5puemR2V
The estimated number of people killed is 2,975. The number is from a recent George Washington University study, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government and accepted by the commonwealth government as the now-official death toll. https://t.co/plN0q9F0UR

@max_arbitrage @AdamSinger @SoCalism @Ableton But the cascading effect is that while it‚Äôs easier to be heard because of streaming services, it‚Äôs harder to become a superstar. So those aiming to be one play it safer than in the past, which leads to formulas. I think you see a similar pattern in the film industry too.
@max_arbitrage @AdamSinger @SoCalism @Ableton Wrote my journalism school thesis (basically an overly long magazine article) on the future of the music industry/different tech startups approaching that. Basically everyone said this exact thing, which I think is correct.
Will see if it‚Äôs walked back tomorrow.
Still looks like Puerto Rico‚Äôs government both getting out ahead of the study it asked George Washington University to conduct and burying a damaging admission after their insistence on keeping the official death toll at 64 for so long.
That would mean 1,427 isn‚Äôt a scientific estimate, but instead assumes all of those additional deaths are hurricane-related (many probably related to extended power outages). 		While 1,427 is closer in line to independent academic estimates, it doesn‚Äôt seem conclusive. (Cont.)

@RichardRubinDC I guess? Promoting a rookie reliever with a 3.15 ERA doesn't exactly seem like a high-impact move. Given Kintzler's contract length seems more like clearing money for the next couple seasons.
@RichardRubinDC Doesn't make a ton of sense in a vacuum unless Kintzler looked sideways at Harper or Ted Lerner or something.
@RichardRubinDC But still what's the purpose of trading Kintzler? I don't think it puts them below the luxury threshold, if they think they're making the playoffs they just traded him to a team they might play, and they get a 23 year-old, Single-A reliever in return.

"Do you have adequate funding, personnel," to keep up with cryptocurrencies, asks Rep. Ted Yoho. 		Giancarlo downplays size of digital currency market relative to other markets that the CFTC regulates. But says CFTC needs better data analytics, "and that is going to take money."
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not traditionally a retail market regulator," CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo says in response to a question at House Agriculture over whether the CFTC should regulate crypto cash markets. Says the SEC is more 'well-honed' at regulating retail investor markets.
