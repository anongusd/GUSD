@cmpwrkshp Thanks all, great talking to you! We read that Governor Jerry Brown signing the Consumer Privacy Act in California means that it will be a 'GDPR Lite' U.S. state- even more reason for U.S. companies to take note, you were right!

Easier to see the good work being done in politicals at the local level. Remember this is where it starts and ends for many successful candidates #Grassroots #CampaignBetter
But one thing I didn't mention in that post was the importance of solid campaign videos, more and more candidates have moved away from the funny, fast laugh video and are now focusing on emotive, actionable visual content.

It's always great to see candidates promising change but we prefer to see it. Ask your local candidate what they are doing to bring about such change. Push for action, ask to see evidence, share issues, even volunteer to learn more about campaigns #CamopaignBetter
Every day we see candidates running for office claiming their race is "pivotal", their race is "historical", a vote for them would change everything. We need action on these claims. What will separate your candidacy? #CampaignBetter

Also European politics is definitely a fascinating place to be at the moment, who is your local MEP? Will you be encouraging someone to run? Will we see a surge in female candidates after they powered the Yes vote to victory? #IrishPolitics #EUElections #WomenInElections #Repeal
With the #EU elections coming up in 2019, capitalising on these movements and studying the effectiveness /impact of social will be interesting. Referendums are different from general elections we know but building a bit of interest certainly wouldn't hurt. #IrishPolitrics #EU
The Irish referendum showed the potential of pairing online movements with grassroots organizing - something we have spoken about and advocated for a long time. It's not rocket science that this would work #IrishPolitics #EU
Another week nearly complete and we can't believe the change in 'tone' online - moving from a very intense Irish referendum campaign back to looking outside of Ireland and refocusing on the EU. #IrishPolitics #EU

There were many takeaways from the recent #Referendum which kicked off with a #CitizensAssembly back in 2016 - we wait and see where the newly activated go to next!?
5. Televised debates caught the attention of the Irish public, #LoveBoth &amp; #TogetherForYes campaigned successfully in awakening the Irish Diaspora #HomeToVote
4. The movement that began at the #Equality referendum evolved to lead and eventually dominate the online platforms that became mouthpieces for the #repeal movement #irishreferendum
3. People who were not political became civically engaged, professed the importance and benefits of canvassing #Grassroots #IrishReferendum
2. The role that social media played in this referendum was huge - powered on both sides by very influential people. The content was emotive, provocative and real #PeopleCanSeeFakeNews #irishreferendum
What we've learned from the recent Irish referendum: 1. Grassroots is real - and we Irish are a pretty good example of how to do so correctly. #irishreferendum #CAMPAIGNING

Podcasts, webinars, blog posts, are all over the internet nowadays! Much needed certainly, but what we aren't seeing are the political organisations, politicians, candidates talk about how they are dealing with #GDPR
Yes, the fine and the big red warning signs we see, but why aren't we actually able to explain the main things to each other? We have been holding weekly #GDPR webinars and each week people have new questions. https://t.co/chcNMBh0zw
I think we have been talking/preaching about #GDPR for a long time now but it has suddenly just occurred to us that lots of us are interpreting it differently - don't be alarmed, well at least don't be TOO alarmed. 20 mill is no biggie!
As the #GDPR deadline looms, a few things have occurred to us in the office this week. Namely, it's about time people started to recognize the changes, they will have to make in a political context!
Why not get involved in some kind of community this week. You'll only be outside if you don't take the first step. Join our Facebook group https://t.co/KLkwM4enqJ or check us out on Instagram #Politics https://t.co/QCG3bUChip https://t.co/Wg6hLS153E

Anatomy Of A Canvass https://t.co/OHzY4nwNbw https://t.co/A4hBUapa4b
The reaction from world leaders should be enough to send strong signals that this si a big deal #Trump #IranNucleaDeal https://t.co/kQ97veP1Mb
"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal," Mr Trump said.	Obama, who signed the deal on behalf of the US three years ago, called Mr Trump's announcement "misguided". #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
"Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015" #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
Was this a rational move by the US President? Risky, certainly! From the outside, the contempt for Obama is evident from Trump from every move his Presidency has made thus far. #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
Yesterday Trump made one of the most divisive decisions of his presidency to date, pulling the US out of the Iran nuclear deal - ‚ÄúThis will make America much safer,‚Äù #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
How are people approaching #Midterms2018 in the US? Keeping up?

Who dares wins‚Ä¶.and the parties that prioritize grassroots engagement will be out ahead of the pack in a post-GDPR landscape		What do you think post-GDPR politics will look like?
and all the other implications of GDPR		And what about when ‚Äúthe course of electoral activities‚Äù is over?		When election day ends, do you just burn everything? 		So back to the top, #GDPR is going to be Year Zero for politics no matter what.
political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.		Oh I see, but wait again, how are you going to provide ‚Äúappropriate safeguards‚Äù without having a DPO, having a data processor...
grassroots outreach		And start from scratch with building a voter database 		But wait, what about Recital 56?		Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's..
will need to be deleted		All desktop information, email threads, voter issues addressed, pen and paper notes, will all need to burn		All parties will need to hire a Data Protection Officer		Employ a data processor		And start from scratch with building voter contact through....
So here‚Äôs our thoughts on #GDPR and #politics in the past few months‚Ä¶..		GDPR is going to be Year Zero for political parties		All voter databases are going to have to be wiped as these voters have not given consent to be contacted in future		All emails collected over the years..

It's not much about the career politician anymore, partly because legacy issues are so bad in most political dynasties. We have become enamored with the CEO's (Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Oprah - Also that Trump guy was pretty good at business once.
Something occurred to us recently, the demand from the public for more versatile politicians (bear with us, we know this should be a given) is massive. People want o vote for people who have built something from nothing.
