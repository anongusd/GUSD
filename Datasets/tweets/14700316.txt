The ‚Äúmarry my rapist‚Äù laws are being repealed in one country after the other, more laws on violence against women are being adopted, and domestic workers (mainly females) have new protections in more Arab countries‚Ä¶ ~ @Rothna_Begum #Rights2019

In today‚Äôs Egypt, it is forbidden to protest in the street‚Äîby law. Hundreds have been jailed because they protested the anti-protest law... Thousands have been disappeared, tortured, by the National Security Agency ~ @AhmedBenchemsi #Rights2019

There are incredible people in Yemen pushing for justice, peace, &amp; change. The question is, when will states choose to stand beside them, rather than continue to arm those fighting with more bombs &amp; bullets? ~ @k_beckerle #Rights2019
- More than 2/3rds, more than 20 million, reliant on some form of aid. 		- Even veteran humanitarian workers find the depths and expanse of human suffering in Yemen difficult to fathom.
- 400,000 children under 5 suffering severe acute malnutrition in Yemen.  		- 2 million displaced, half of them kids.		- Up to half the population at risk of starvation if something doesn‚Äôt change.
Yemen: The World‚Äôs Worst Humanitarian Crisis - @k_beckerle now speaking in London, gives us some figures on the horror... 	 	- About 20,000 civilians killed or wounded. Maybe tens of thousands more, depending on who is counting.
Many international investors are now scared away from Saudi Arabia because of MBS‚Äôs repression. ~ @cooglea #Rights2019
Even his economic reforms have not gone to plan. The IPO of ARAMCO is stalled, and he hasn‚Äôt been able to generate the level of international investment needed to transform the economy. ~ @cooglea #Rights2019
Given the level of repression, we should expect that MBS has at least carried out his reform program, but on women‚Äôs rights there has been little progress ‚Äì the guardianship system is still in place. ~ @cooglea #Rights2019
Not only were they arrested and many held without charge, there are credible allegations that authorities also mistreated them in detention. ~ @cooglea	#Rights2019
He embarked on an arrest campaign of well-known independent clerics, activists, and academics, as well as senior princes and leading businessmen, and the country‚Äôs leading women‚Äôs rights activists...
What MBS didn‚Äôt tell us is that he decided that he could only make reforms in the absence of all criticism or feedback from Saudi society, and he dramatically escalated the level of repression in order to curb all dissent. ~ @cooglea #Rights2019
The well-funded image created for MBS by his army of consultants and PR people was quickly embraced by many media and international leaders. On MBS‚Äôs publicity tour of the UK and US he met political leaders, celebrities, and leading business people like Oprah! ~ @cooglea
And now, the meeting in London turns to discuss Saudi Arabia, with @cooglea taking the floor‚Ä¶ #Rights2019
128 rights groups have called for @NABEELRAJAB‚Äôs release, and so many organizations have awarded him their highest human rights prize, but the govt of Bahrain has dug its heels in, insisting on maintaining their oppression of this activist, no matter the international scorn.
A federal appeals court in December upheld Ahmed‚Äôs outrageous 10 year conviction for ‚Äúinsulting the UAE‚Äù because he criticized the arrest of other activists. ‚ÄúLittle Sparta‚Äù is actually little eggshell, it seems, treating the mildest of	criticism as a national threat.
My friends, both of whom are members of the HRW MENA advisory committee, Ahmed Mansoor and Nabeel Rajab. ~ @sarahleah1
Sadly Jamal is but one of many journalists attacked for their work. There are others whose cases are not as well known, or have dropped off the radar, but I want to urge you to focus on in this coming year, because we do believe we can make a difference, with enough pressure:
‚Ä¶but it will, I‚Äôm sure, only highlight even more why we need a full, well-funded international investigation that has the capacity to uncover the specific role of MBS and his deputies in ordering this crime, including by speaking to those detained now in Saudi. ~ @sarahleah1
‚Ä¶the pending announcement that the Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial Executions will commence an investigation of this case is a welcome move‚Ä¶ ~ @sarahleah1
I was last here in London in October to speak at the memorial of Jamal #Khashoggi, a long time friend and collaborator. I want to urge you all to remain committed to demanding accountability for his murder‚Ä¶ ~ @sarahleah1
And with that, a tip of the hat to Tunisia, which alone is shouldering the hopes and prayers of the entire world, to survive and maybe even flourish, as the one real democracy that persists in the Arab world. ~ @sarahleah1
‚Ä¶and in perhaps the one real positive development in the region, advances on women‚Äôs rights. ~ @sarahleah1 #Rights2019
My colleagues will dive into detail in some of the key trends we wanted to discuss today: including the descent into darkness in Egypt; the ravaging of Yemen; the failed campaign to portray MBS as a ‚Äúreformer‚Äù in Saudi Arabia‚Ä¶ ~ @sarahleah1
And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here today, and why it‚Äôs even more important to show govts in the region that keeping us out will not mean we won‚Äôt uncover the truth of their abuses, the facts on the ground, the reality of their failed governance and failed leadership. ~ @sarahleah1
It‚Äôs also that independent human rights orgs, journalists, academics and journalists can‚Äôt get in. ~ @sarahleah1
Thousands and thousands of Arabs are travel banned, just because, in Saudi, Bahrain, and Egypt; over a million Gazans are caged in their tiny territory. Yemenis have nowhere to flee, to escape the war devastating their country. But it‚Äôs not just that they can‚Äôt get out.
The people of the Arab world, especially those with independent voices, find themselves trapped inside their countries, giant virtual prisons for their citizens. ~ @sarahleah1
We are here in London though we wish we were in the Middle East. When we talk about the clamping down on independent civil society in most of the region, that‚Äôs not just domestic civil society, but international civil society as well. ~ @sarahleah1

‚ÄúThat mounting pressure illustrates the real possibility of defending human rights even in darker times. Indeed, it shows the responsibility to do so. That‚Äôs the message of this year‚Äôs @HRW World Report.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe terrain for the fight may have shifted, with many long-time participants missing in action or even switching sides. But effective new coalitions have	emerged to lead the battle‚Äîand in the past year they have won some notable,	precedent-setting victories‚Äù #Rights2019
‚ÄúAll of these reactions increase the cost of serious human rights violations. Ultimately that is the best way to force abusive governments to curb abuses. ‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúPressure even mounted on China for its mass detention of one million Uighur Muslims for ‚Äòreeducation.‚Äô‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThis outpouring of criticism seems to have contributed to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs willingness to agree in UN-sponsored talks to lifting a blockade of the critical port of Hodeidah that was fueling Yemen‚Äôs famine.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúTrump pointedly refused to endorse the CIA‚Äôs reported finding that the Saudi crown prince had likely ordered Khashoggi‚Äôs murder, but the US Senate endorsed that conclusion and voted to end US military assistance for the war in Yemen.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúGermany also joined the Netherlands, Denmark, and Finland in stopping arms sales to the kingdom.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIn Europe, Germany took the unprecedented step of barring 18 Saudi officials from entering the 26-nation Schengen Zone.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúGradually, the US and Canada imposed targeted sanctions against many of the Saudis implicated in the murder.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that it took the killing of a prominent journalist, rather than of countless unknown Yemeni civilians, to mobilize global outrage at Riyadh, but this single murder turned out to be galvanizing.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe aftermath of the Saudi government‚Äôs gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi provided another example of multilateral pressure.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúSo far, that ceasefire has held, despite Trump‚Äôs announcement of the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from a separate area in northeast Syria.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúIntensive European pressure on the Russian government ultimately persuaded Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Idlib, beginning in September.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe Kremlin held the keys to whether this feared massacre of civilians proceeded because the Syrian military was incapable of sustaining an offensive without Russian aerial support.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThree million civilians in Syria‚Äôs northwestern Idlib province were at risk of slaughter as the Syrian-Russian military alliance threatened an offensive using their typically indiscriminate bombardment.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIn Syria, a new bloodbath was averted through multilateral pressure.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúNotably, Germany will have the presidency of the EU at the decisive moment in the second half of 2020.‚Äù
‚ÄúBoth have used these funds for their political advantage, so momentum is building within the EU to stop generously funding their attacks on the EU‚Äôs core democratic values.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúPoland is the largest recipient of EU funds, and Hungary is among the largest per capita recipients.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúAlthough Poland and Hungary have the power under unanimity rules to shield each other from the actual imposition of such sanctions, the Article 7 process lays the groundwork for using the leverage provided by the EU‚Äôs next five-year budget.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚Äú‚Ä¶and by a two-thirds majority of the European Parliament in the case of Hungary, for undermining democracy.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIn the EU, a process that could end in the imposition of political sanctions under Article 7 of the EU Treaty was launched‚Äîby the European Commission in the case of Poland, for undermining the independence of the judiciary ‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúBut in an initiative led by France and Britain, member states voting to grant the OPCW the mandate to begin identifying the users of chemical weapons.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúRussia opposed any international investigation that could attribute responsibility because it backed the Syrian govt as it repeatedly used chemical weapons, and because Russia itself apparently used the Novichok nerve agent in an attempted	assassination in Britain‚Äù #Rights2019
‚ÄúTraditionally, the OPCW was empowered to determine only whether chemical weapons had been used, not who used them.‚Äù
Saudi Arabia: Increased Repression Brings Scrutiny https://t.co/1ofi9kUBi6
‚ÄúGovernments also acted to strengthen the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe	ICC also pursued a novel idea for pursuing Myanmar generals. Even though Myanmar isn‚Äôt an ICC member, the ICC is examining the crime of ‚Äòdeportation,‚Äô on the theory that that crime wasn‚Äôt completed until the Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh, which is an ICC member.‚Äù @KenRoth
‚ÄúThis was the first time that any government has sought an ICC investigation of crimes that took place entirely outside its territory. France and Germany, among others, supported the move.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúApart from the Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court remained important. Five Latin American governments and Canada urged it to open an investigation of crimes in Venezuela‚Ä¶‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúA group of Latin American governments led by Argentina also organized in the	context of the Human Rights Council the first joint statement on the worsening repression in Nicaragua, as President Ortega responded with violence to growing protests against his repressive rule.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe US departure from the council under Trump ironically made it easier to succeed, because it let the resolution sponsors show they were addressing Venezuela as a matter of principle rather than as a tool of Washington‚Äôs ideology.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúFor the first time, the UN Human Rights Council condemned the severe repression in Venezuela under Maduro. A group of Latin American nations sponsored that effort.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúDespite Saudi threats of economic retaliation, the Council continued an international investigation started last year.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúWith respect to the war crimes in Yemen, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Canada took the lead, as the Human Rights Council rejected Saudi Arabia‚Äôs heavy-handed effort to avoid scrutiny of the war crimes in Yemen.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúUntil Myanmar‚Äôs ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, the OIC had never supported a resolution criticizing a country other than Israel.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIn an unusual partnership, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation joined the European Union to co-present the council‚Äôs resolution on the Rohingya.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThat signaled that these atrocities cannot be committed with impunity.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúIn response, the Human Rights Council, where there is no veto, created for the first time an investigative mechanism to preserve evidence, identify those responsible, and build cases for prosecution once a tribunal becomes available.‚Äù	~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
Eleven stunning stats in 2 minutes - World Report 2019 in Numbers https://t.co/NsPsnbPLSY #Rights2019 https://t.co/ISPmoSpjby
‚ÄúFor example, with respect to Myanmar, the possibility of a Chinese, Russian, or even American veto at the UN Security Council appeared to doom any effort torefer to the ICC the army‚Äôs crimes against humanity that sent 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh‚Äù @KenRoth
‚ÄúRather than retreat alongside the larger powers, they stepped forward and assumed greater responsibility, especially at the UN Human Rights Council. In the process, the established several new and important precedents.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúAgainst this challenging backdrop, the leaders of the resistance were frequently coalitions of small- and mid-sized states, including some nontraditional allies.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúMeanwhile, China and Russia did all they could to undermine global rights enforcement.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúAs we know, Trump preferred to embrace friendly autocrats. Britain was preoccupied with Brexit. France‚Äôs Macron spoke a good game but often fell short in practice. Here in Germany, Chancellor Merkel was often beset by political challenges.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúMuch of the pushback played out at the UN‚Äîeven though many of the large Western powers were often unwilling to join in the defense of human rights.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúPopular pressure led to a new reformist prime minister in Ethiopia. US midterm voters rebuked Trump‚Äôs divisive policies.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúPeople took to the streets in Poland and Hungary. Voters ousted corrupt or authoritarian rules in Malaysia, the Maldives, and Armenia.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth	#Rights2019
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the bad news. But what‚Äôs impressive over the past year is the considerable pushback that this authoritarianism has prompted.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúTo make matters worse, some govts have taken advantage of this trend to commit mass atrocities, including in Syria (against civilians in anti-govt areas), Myanmar (against Rohingya) &amp; Yemen (where the Saudi-led coalition is bombing &amp; blockading civilians)‚Äù @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúEven in Western democracies, autocratic policies were advanced by such leaders as Italy‚Äôs Salvini and America‚Äôs Trump.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúBolsonaro joins the ranks of such established figures as Turkey‚Äôs Erdogan, Egypt‚Äôs Sisi, the Philippines‚Äô Duterte, Hungary‚Äôs Orb√°n, Russia‚Äôs Putin, and China‚Äôs Xi Jinping.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not to diminish the problem. Brazil‚Äôs new President Bolsonaro is the latest authoritarian example.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe populists who spread hatred and intolerance are spawning a resistance. The excesses of autocratic rule are fueling a counterattack.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
‚ÄúThe autocrats have been capturing the headlines these days, but as we look back on the last year, what struck us is that the defenders of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are also gaining strength.‚Äù ~ @KenRoth #Rights2019
Now, @HRW‚Äôs Executive Director @KenRoth will present his take on the situation of human rights globally, based on his keynote essay: ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Autocrats Face Rising Resistance‚Äù #Rights2019 (We‚Äôll take questions from Twitter afterwards.) https://t.co/AJPtNynI3i
