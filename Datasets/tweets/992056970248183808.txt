Over the past year, this City has seen 18 million visitors. Only 1.2 million of those passed through the Convention Center.	 	I will continue to fight to get our people all that they deserve. https://t.co/KS9ST40uEV
Seventy percent of that $200 million went to just 4 hospitality agencies. We generated roughly $166 million of that in local lodging taxes alone--- but less than ten percent of the total came to the City to address our infrastructure needs. https://t.co/FnWM2BnPg6
The wellbeing &amp; the economy of our City &amp; the economy of our state, rely on an adequate infrastructure. Right now, it doesn‚Äôt exist. We‚Äôre not asking anybody for favors. Last year, we generated more than $200M in hospitality revenue but less than 10% of that came to the City. https://t.co/Mzml55rxWQ
