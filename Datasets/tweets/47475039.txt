@KillerMartinis @throberts1 Well, no. It's regional and the rich cities are the ones charging a shitload of money. Art museums in NYC, Boston, Chicago are exorbitant. St Louis, KC, Cleveland, Baltimore, Bentonville AR, and probably others are free. DC is a rich city with free museums because it's federal.
@feminaminus @KillerMartinis It's also not how the museum or anything in the ZMD is funded; that's not where the ticketing scheme money goes. This is serious shit so folks should get their facts straight.
@MotherSmocker Yes I'm writing one now
@throberts1 @KillerMartinis That's not true. The Met went from suggested fee to mandatory $25. MOMA is $25. Whitney, Guggenheim -- all that shit is insanely expensive. NYC is a stuck-up city that doesn't believe in art as a public good.

@lizl_genealogy @KillerMartinis It's gross what most museums charge. There was this sense of "Get everything you can out of this, kids, because we could never afford to return and they don't want us in here anyway" when we saw museums in NYC. That's why I appreciate STL (and KC; their art museums are free too)

@MizQue @Unpersuaded112 @AOC We're united in a collective sense of abandonment and in coastal elites (not synonymous with regular people living on the coasts) treating us with disdain and denying us opportunity. But "middle America" is a huge region and the range of political perspectives is extremely wide.
@OnlyWhiteTiger He did do that! My point is he'll keep doing it even after he loses his clearance.
When the Trumps moved in, they basically put a "USA: Going out of business sale!" sign on the White House lawn. Hostile state and non-state actors came calling.		They are stripping the country down and selling it for parts. They will not stop unless they are indicted and removed.
Trump gave away state secrets to the Russians in the Oval Office. You think he won't give them to Jared over dinner? And that Jared won't sell or trade them with Netanyahu, MBS, oligarch backers, etc?		National security is compromised, lives are at stake. Time to indict them.
Good but not enough. What do you think will happen if Jared asks Trump for intel? "Sorry kid, but you lost your clearance, and you know me -- I'm a real stickler for protocol!"		Trump will give Jared whatever he needs and he'll commit crimes until you indict them. All of them. https://t.co/0WvTiqtowo

I did warn everyone years ago. But officials needed to act. Because they did not, people lost rights and some lost their lives. Children lost their parents.		I get no satisfaction over being right. Every official and journalist who played down the threat has blood on their hands. https://t.co/mGdSiReryT
@MamurphyMaureen @tcalaquilac @bmainzer @RickSmithShow Yes, absolutely. And it's not just on Obama -- it's the rest of his admin, Comey, the FBI, and others who failed to protect this country.
@ernamh @wordsmanifest He *needed* the job. He had to eliminate sanctions, and he also needed to protect himself and his crime syndicate from prosecution. Had HRC won, Trump &amp; co would've been under investigation, and Russia would be sanctioned. Winning was both a kleptocratic goal and self-protection.
@MamurphyMaureen @tcalaquilac @bmainzer @RickSmithShow Yeah -- and it's also a lie in addition to being dereliction of duty. Many people predicted Trump would win, including me. And Trump &amp; co were a *severe* national security threat. You can't casually place your bets; you have to actually act and protect the country and the public.

@AnnFowlerAvery Yes, that's accurate
@NC_Skins23 @RickSmithShow He ran for president in 2000, 2012, and 2016, nearly ran for president in 1988 and 1996, nearly ran for NY governor, and kept the same campaign team around him (esp Stone) the whole time. He's no political neophyte and he sought the presidency for 30 years.

For those who see "Did Trump want Trump Tower Moscow or did he want to win the presidency?" as a real question -- the answer is always both. Trump is a criminal kleptocrat who doesn't divest! He wouldn't have to choose.
In his testimony, Cohen left out the part where he and fellow lifelong Russian mobster Felix Sater emailed each other in Nov 2015 about their plan to "get Trump elected" with help of the Kremlin. "Our boy can become POTUS and we can engineer it" wasn't about a brand or a tower. https://t.co/xN0WhKDIQn
From my interview several hours ago: https://t.co/924u5XD22s
@slackjaw79 @RickSmithShow He's covering for himself and in the process also covering for Trump and many of the criminal associates to which they're both linked
@HBullis @RickSmithShow No, I doubt that. But they have mutual and much worse crimes that they'd like to hide or play down in favor of highlighting more minor crimes or (unprosecutable) character defects, and that's evident here.
@warren2650 @RickSmithShow His statement is linked in the first tweet; it's already out. We'll see if anyone challenges him on factual innaccuracies and dubious claims.

@EmDashPython @Autumnshroud @KateHarding @MerriwetherW @edbott @nycsouthpaw I didn't see it as an ambush, but I also wish the other adults hadn't interrupted. I wanted Feinstein to respond to the kids. People underestimate how much kids know. Kids force adults to be straightforward. Kids lack cynicism and want answers; it's always good to hear from kids.
@KateHarding @MerriwetherW @edbott @nycsouthpaw Feinstein could have asked the kids about their ideas. She could've told them *why* in her view a different variation of the plan will help them. Maybe there's more to it. I didn't find her smug. I found her, from the perspective of a kid who thinks we have 12 years left, scary.
@FakeEmily65 @edbott @KateHarding @nycsouthpaw This is very different than the "Amy ate with a comb" nonsense. Kids are dealing with an existential threat and right now they have to rely on adults. Politicians in general should be more pragmatic and empathetic, and really try to imagine themselves in these kids' positions.
@MerriwetherW @edbott @KateHarding @nycsouthpaw The latter is the most important part. Adults need to prioritize the youngest generations because they will bear the brunt of many disastrous changes. They don't have structural power so it is our job as adults to protect them. Apologies don't mean as much as a responsible plan.
@PresWallace @chriswijn Here is a list of some of Kushner's most egregious crimes. He is not someone who should have access to classified intel. He's abusing power and endangering our country: https://t.co/Lwcw7oRtez
@edbott @KateHarding @nycsouthpaw Agree. Those kids are scared, and rightly so. Their concerns are well-founded. The adults all could have listened more to each others' ideas, but Feinstein should have grasped that the kids are scared and heard them out -- and thought about what it's like from their perspective.

@iregsnikle @DesireeResists Yes Donald Jr should be indicted for his crimes too. But it is even worse to have dangerous criminals in active positions of state power, like Kushner and Ivanka, selling the country for parts and threatening public safety. Every day that passes is damage done.

@christibopp Witting asset, IMO. It's sick that this is even a common topic of debate, and that this case has dragged on so long. The answer in a functional sovereign country would be "Neither!"
@JustAFlower12 Of course Ivanka should be indicted for her crimes. Kushner is a greater danger due to his outsized role in international affairs. He's the nexus of a very dangerous international alignment involving, among other things, nuclear material and murders.
@AlkatzThe LOL OK. You realize Mueller's letting Mike Flynn -- a treasonous maniac who makes illegal deals involving nuclear material -- run around free despite his judge's horrified objections? Hate to break it to you, but that's not a great idea! üôÑ

@andrewthoesen No one is above the law. This is about public safety, not popularity or pleasing personality cults. Trump is backed by a transnational crime syndicate committing dangerous offenses in plain sight. They should be indicted so that they can no longer threaten and hurt the public.
@andrewthoesen No one craves Jared Kushner.
It's hard to indict a POTUS. It shouldn't be hard to indict Kushner, who has committed an enormous number of crimes. If you want an easy start, go to his clearance form lies.		And spare me the "But he's the son-in-law!" shit. This isn't a monarchy -- unless you let it become one.
Given the wealth of damning evidence already in the public domain, I'm less concerned with the contents of the Mueller report than whether it brings indictments -- particularly of people, like Kushner, who pose a tremendous threat to national security and public safety.

@ragepath @cathyrayofsunsh I know what you mean. I was in Mountain View AR (population 2000 or so) for a weekend last fall and randomly found an old cemetery. It made me more curious about and attached to the town.
@cathyrayofsunsh It's very nice in spring. But I love it most in fall, after the leaves change and before Halloween. The first time I went there was on a Columbus Day and it was so spooky and serene. After my walk I went to Goody Goody Diner for chicken and waffles. It was a great STL day!
@capeannsky St Louis is very big on stained glass. There is stained glass all over the place, including my house, which is a regular home in a lower-middle class neighborhood but it's 100 years old so it has all these leftover flourishes. I have columns and a window seat too!

@AnUnevenKeel I don't object to slogans -- I object to *these* slogans because they're bad. "Heartland economics" is really weird given both the diversity within and the disparity between rural and urban economies in the Midwest. I have no clue what it's supposed to convey. A dud of a slogan.

@DaveAmerika I don't think it's ridiculous at all to consider him -- being a mayor is tough and valuable experience. But this is exactly why I wait for debates and platforms. I don't know his foreign policy views. I'd like to actually hear them along with more extensive domestic policy views.
@synchron20 @on2thanext1 He does have no idea what he's talking about because I have this wild idea of waiting for platforms and debates before deciding üòâ I've also said repeatedly we need to make voter rights the foremost election priority. That said, I do like Warren's policies and recent speeches.
@sgj61 I wish the whole campaign season lasted six months max -- from declarations of candidacy to the general election. I want a shorter primary season too. What we do now is so economically wasteful and politically destructive.
@SW_Crisis Yeah, part of his appeal is that he's my generation and speaks with a similar perspective -- we never saw the era people have nostalgia for; instead we got decades of corruption that hit people our age especially hard and needs to be fixed. Refreshing to hear someone else say it!

@DrakeMarshall9 Trump's regime is different than other authoritarian regimes I've studied in two major respects: 1) it's part of a transnational crime syndicate; the state is just something to sell 2) role of digital media in boosting autocracy (not unique to US but part of a general sea change)

@klcmurphy @tcalaquilac McCabe is selling a book. When you write a book, the publication schedule is set months or years in advance. He's not ringing an alarm that he couldn't have rung long ago -- and should have rung long ago. Instead, he was fired -- for the wrong reasons -- and turned to profit.
@tcalaquilac If the FBI had come forward earlier, as Harry Reid requested, we might not be in a situation where purged and threatened institutions can't bring accountability. If McCabe gave a shit, he would have informed the public instead of prioritizing $$$. Hell, even Bezos used Medium.
@tcalaquilac I've been arguing for this information to be public for years; that's not my problem. My problem is people failing to do their job -- in this case, protecting the US -- and profiting off their failure once the damage is irreparable. That's grotesque.

3) Imagine if all the misogyny aimed at Warren, Harris, Klobuchar, Gillibrand etc were aimed just at one woman. Or if Trump/GOP had one name to browbeat endlessly for 20 months. The financial waste of the election is a real problem -- but big slate is good for Dems strategically
2) The Dem field will narrow over time; it's not a crisis or an indicator. At the moment, a broad field is good, because we are battling rising autocracy. Diverse roster, varied debate on policies, and the inability of the media/GOP to obsessively smear just one person is a plus

@MissRyley @MarkARKleiman It's not about expecting a discount; it's that we in the Midwest make lower salaries. Our cost of living is also lower. So if a NYC/DC-priced train arrives, people will simply not be able to afford it and they'll drive or take the bus instead, and then the train plan will fail.
@RachelsBirds @jessicafmason Yeah honestly I love our family road trips. It's the happiest I am and my kids learn all about America and see so many ways of life. I love the open road. However, I would totally take a train instead for some of those trips if it were affordable and convenient.

@Yah_Mule But in Kansas there's Wheatfield Jesus and the World's Largest Easel and the World's Largest Czech Egg and...OK yeah Kansas is a tough haul. Except the rock formations in western Kansas, those are worth driving a day for. (And east Kansas has cool stuff too. It's the middle...)
@jessicafmason Yup. If you're taking kids, flying is unaffordable for many people, including me. My kids (oldest is 11) have been on a plane once. But they've been to 24 states because we'll drive far to save money. The difference between gas costs and over $1200 (at least) in plane tickets.
@MarkARKleiman The fares for what? We barely have a train system here and the fares are already too high. People drive or take the Greyhound.
Oh man, this. A ten-hour drive is nothing! I approve of the train plan for the Midwest. It'll create jobs, it's good for the environment. I'd ride that train. Just charge Midwestern fares and not that Acela shit please. https://t.co/bgJoHhIfZV
@DavidDe17354109 @peter_masiakos You can't "disagree" with things that happened to me or people I know. They happened.

@KarinaEmberly @peter_masiakos Everyone I know cares and grieves, but it is definitely not surprising to hear someone was shot. No one shrugs it off, but we expect it. Aside from the violence itself, the fact that many murders remain unsolved is traumatic. There's no resolution for those who knew the victims.

@bayofarizona If this is a strategy, it's either a failed one or a cruel one. People are dying, rights are lost, and the few indicted still work for a mafia syndicate while in prison. Indictments are often for crimes decades old (Eriksen, Cohen, Manafort) -- from when Mueller headed the FBI.
@wil6ur After indictment, they need to institute gag orders and block them from communicating with criminals around the world. They are making no serious attempt to do that, even with Manafort. And I don't want to hear it's impossible when whisteblowers who *exposed* the crimes get worse

@EvanHandler I'm used to people being callous but this is still weird. A surge of bot-like replies (not saying they are bots, just that they're so rote and repetitive they are indistinguishable from bots) ignoring that ordinary people, not wealthy CEOs, are the ones hurt in this situation.
The circumstances of the sudden inability of Wells Fargo to function are suspicious in their own right. Wells Fargo is corrupt in its own right.		But I see tweets saying "I'm stuck on the road -- I can't buy gas because of Wells Fargo." People react with...haha too bad? SMH üòí
Why am I getting a ton of near identical responses like this on Wells Fargo? Yes we all know they're terrible!

@Patrick_Collins They are an unusually terrible paper. Every paper makes mistakes; no outlet is perfect, and times are tough. But NYT has deep systemic rot. They take no responsibility for lies, they have no public editor, their reporters smear and bully people. High-brow Breitbart.

@monicabyrne13 She's extremely wealthy and works for a paper that has disregarded the concept of accountability. I don't think she understands, at the most basic level, that honesty matters.
People should stop assuming an institution has credibility because of prestige. Prestige derives from a word meaning "illusion"; an illusion of competence and quality is what elite media peddles.		Trust in an outlet needs to be earned; NYT has shown its editors are untrustworthy.

@FactsMatter314 @gaslitnation It's natural for Don Jr to want to believe his father will protect him, for both personal and legal reasons, but Trump will run him down and enjoy it so long as it helps Trump in the end. As I say on the show, I'm not sure Trump would even pardon Don Jr.

@JupiterWaypost And that's not a solution. That's the bare minimum of what officials should be doing. We have a gutted government which means there are a host of external threats no one is handling. But dismantle the nexus of the crisis first; it slows hostile actors down and mitigates damage.
@JupiterWaypost They need to indict the most dangerous actors in office who have committed open crimes now, Kushner in particular. This is a public safety issue, not about partisanship.		Trump should be indicted but it's complex. Open hearings need to be held to get all info to the public ASAP.
I'm not saying anything revelatory here. This has all been obvious since before Trump took office. They commit crimes and forge anti-American alliances openly.		The urgency of the crisis was clear. Time was limited. Ask why those who could have stopped it or slowed it did not.
Three problems:		1) Trump is a sadistic sociopath 		2) Trump works with hostile foreign state and non-state actors to strip the US down and sell it for parts, aided by complicit US officials		3) Hostile parties left out of these transactions await to exploit newly vulnerable US

This is basically true. Though I give credit to those who told Americans the truth right away, like Maxine Waters, Ted Lieu, Elijah Cummings, Adam Schiff. As House minority party, power was limited.

@CorkeryMark Trump covers crime with scandal. That's how he's always operated. He also hires a lawyer goon squad to threaten physical violence against journalists who bring up certain issues, like his history of being accused of rape. Michael Cohen is on tape making threats about this.
@RohannenZorbia @bibbo_ronald @Jenlilheis Yes the case was in court all throughout 2016. The alleged Trump preteen rape victim and her lawyer tried to give a press conference on Nov 4 2016 and canceled it due to death threats. Media still barely covered it.
@iansmadrig @DavidDGillin I don't know if he was the person who hired him but yes, William Barr's father was headmaster at Dalton when Jeffrey Epstein taught there. This is the first time I've seen the connection mentioned, but the dates check out.
@haleakela19 His alleged rape victim took note; it's in the video interview in the thread. That's how she knew Trump knew she was only 13, because he remarked that she was the same age as his daughter.

@davidmweissman The GOP often denied climate change was real because their funding is wrapped up in fossil fuel industries, and they risked losing money. But Trump is worse. He has a fatalistic, sadistic view of the value of life. He doesnt care what happens to the planet once he's not on it.
@davidmweissman Yes. I'm not an expert and I also found the terms confusing because they were often used interchangeably.		But basically it's cause and effect. Global warming changes the climate, and each thing itt changes (sea levels etc), changes another thing, and it all gets destabilized.
@davidmweissman Global warming describes the increase in the earth's surface temperature caused by burning fossil fuels.		Climate change refers to the broader changes global warming caused: rising sea levels, ice caps melting, etc. It's a better term IMO because it describes changes beyond heat.

I didn't like the competitions though, so I never tried a professional route. Taught myself guitar too. I still enjoy playing music for fun. I have a terrible singing voice though!
@unixgrl12 @JulieAMcDowall It's kind of cool. It might have made me a better writer and a better musician. But honestly I can't imagine what it's like to *not* have synesthesia. I was startled to find out it wasn't universal. I was like "Obviously A is red, how do you all not see that?!" üòÇ
@JulieAMcDowall I have synesthesia too, but not with taste. Letters, numbers, and musical notes have colors. When I struggle to remember a word, I can often still see the colors. When I hear music, I "hear" colors too.		I had no idea that everyone else did NOT have synesthesia until I was 12 üòÇ

@IT_not_real @ronaldfeljones @melio777 @Slippy_Sally I didn't say that in three weeks he'd shut down the govt. I said he signed a three-week bill and agreed it's tactical, not some sign of changed perspective. He'll continue trying to consolidate power and dodge prosecution, and will exploit vulnerabilities created by the shutdown.
@kurknielsen Of course it's not Trump alone. It's his backers, especially Mitch McConnell. Revisit the 2013 shutdown; the GOP used many of the same tactics and rhetoric.
@ronaldfeljones @melio777 @Slippy_Sally "Three weeks" isn't me randomly picking a number out of my head; that is the actual agreement. He signed a three-week spending bill.
@hollyjarmstrong I recommend being glad about something real -- like workers getting their money, and families being able to buy food -- instead of downplaying obvious dangers that remain. And be prepared to fight for those workers and their families in three weeks (or sooner).
@melio777 @Slippy_Sally Yeah a lot of people seem to be missing this vital and basic fact, which is kind of blowing my mind...
@alexandraerin Her post doesn't argue that Trump isn't in control of the situation. It argues the opposite: that he's bullying the country and granting illusory reprieve before the next round. This is tactical. There's no "surrender" here; he will keep pushing; the govt opening is temporary.
@MrsErmaGerd There is nothing complicated about this; it's a standard bullying tactic. If he had "caved" -- ie done the right thing -- there would not be conditions and threats attached to a temporary opening.

@LauraMiers @RadioFreeTom @tammylively It's going to be another vile election cycle, but I don't think the number of candidates is why.

@leahmcelrath @slipperyhero Yup. I'm much more concerned that Trump will use nukes than Putin or Kim will. That's always been the case. They all want to build them, but Trump really, really wants to use them.
@cscollard @leahmcelrath I'm talking specifically about the Trump and Putin regimes, neither of which existed then. And it's a different scenario when a Russian asset is POTUS. But yes in many ways this revives the mutually beneficial (for them) and highly dangerous (for the rest of us) arms race.
@grasshoppr93 @leahmcelrath Yes, possible. It's also possible he was threatened. But Cohen's lawyer is also the lawyer for a major player in the Russian mafia. Cohen's family has been tied to Trump for years and his own mafia connections go back decades. It's complicated; best resource is @olgaNYC1211
@leahmcelrath Futilely, it seems. As I said back in 2017, "You can't see a mushroom cloud through rose-colored glasses!" 		Although there's not much anyone can do when Trump has unilateral nuke control. Congress should have passed Lieu's bill, but Congress should have done a lot of things...üò©

Every outlet is a mix of good and bad, but some lean more heavily in one direction or the other. It's something to watch NYT -- which Christopher Steele abandoned after they lied about Trump and the FBI -- pile on Buzzfeed, which while imperfect, has a better record of accuracy.
Buzzfeed also published the Steele dossier, which was the right decision. It seems certain people want to discredit Buzzfeed as a whole, not only the article on Cohen (which may well be accurate), because Buzzfeed has made an effort to bring troubling information to light.
The publications that blew or buried the Trump-Russia story are going hardest on Buzzfeed, whose coverage has been crucial. Buzzfeed has done multi-year investigations into dangerous, complex topics like Russian assassinations abroad and the infiltration of the US Treasury.

@deathandraven @melodijoy I wrote a book on how both admins as well as other actors set the stage for the Trump admin to exploit broken institutions for their own kleptocratic agenda. You know, in between naps. https://t.co/VlxIB4OYXl
@PhilippeReines @_silversmith I said the idea that Trump ran to lose is ridiculous, and gave multiple reasons why. This is not a critique of you, and you're not the only person to express this ridiculous idea.
@benFranklin2018 @NefariousGato It could be, but there are a number of issues with which they need to contend regarding Turkey (Khashoggi murder, broader Syria conflict and refugees, fate of the Kurds). I'm wary that Graham was the one dispatched for this meeting.

@NefariousGato No, he wants to pull us out of NATO, but he wants to replace it with an alliance of autocrats. (And by "he", I really mean "they" -- a transnational and often transactional group of brutal officials including Bolton, Kushner, Putin, Netanyahu, MBS. Extraordinarily dangerous.)
Keep an eye on Trump and his backers gunning for war in Iran. In particular:		1) The alliances described in the article below and attempts to formalize them		2) Attempts to privatize military action, especially using brutal mercenaries already tied to the admin, like Erik Prince https://t.co/mFnWR4jCo6

@DrunkEnough It's blowing up now. People are dying now. Institutions, both domestic and foreign, are collapsing now.		The longer autocrats stay in, the harder it is to get them out. The longer criminals go unpunished, the more brutal and flagrant their crimes.		They should be indicted now.
@KirithSotheril If the House doesn't start impeachment proceedings, I'll be disappointed. But the Dem House is a large group of people with a lot of obstacles and diverse goals. The Mueller probe has a specific goal and a much smaller team. Hard to compare the two.
Kushner being indicted is my litmus test of the efficacy of the Mueller probe, because Kushner is a major national security threat who has openly committed crimes. That he hasn't been indicted is damning and dangerous. https://t.co/dSMXdANKNb

It's interesting that this, of all stories, is the one that's (vaguely) corrected -- when Mueller is smeared constantly in right-wing media, and is the subject of gossip and innuendo in left and mainstream media.		But no statement of correction until now. https://t.co/x6ij4wNvG0
Those treating a vague denial about one story are missing the big picture, which is that a criminal Russian asset shut down the US government and is consolidating power. That's the crisis.		And it will get worse the more you look for saviors and easy outs. It's a long haul fight.
When the Buzzfeed story broke, I didn't feel excited about it, because Trump has not been indicted for his countless other crimes. We do not know the full story of the Buzzfeed report.		We do know he acts with impunity -- impunity that is becoming immunity due to abuse of power.
Trump lies constantly. He commits crimes constantly, and openly. He confesses to the crimes (obstruction) or gets caught lying about the crimes. The same is true of his admin and his accomplices. Nothing happens to most of them because they threaten and bribe.		That's the crisis.
