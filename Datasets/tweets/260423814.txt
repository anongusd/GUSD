@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey There’s a lot of ways to research cost.  Look at what other democracies spend per person on healthcare and education annually.  Look at life expectancy rates.  Then look at what the average American is spending per year on healthcare and higher education.  Prepare to be sad.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey You’re going to have to do the math yourself. Healthcare and education are among the best investments a society can collectively make.  It seems trivial to be overly concerned with the cost. We are literally the richest country in the world economically.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey How about not building a $27 billion dollar border wall.  Maybe not fight stupid wars. Perhaps not give away trillions in tax cuts to billionaires. There’s plenty of money.  Imagine if Americans could cut their healthcare bill by 75% by just paying a little more in taxes.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey Americans are already paying an absurd amount for healthcare and college.  This idea that we can’t afford it one of the greatest scams in American history.  It’s all to keep the profits high and the poor powerless.  Look at how other democracies do it with far less money.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey More Americans voted for Hillary than Trump so the “America wasn’t ready for a woman” is BS.  There were tons of reasons Hillary lost but the woman reason just isn’t true.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey What is “too far to the left”?  Universal Healthcare isn’t a radical idea. Every other developed country has it.  Funding higher education isn’t crazy either.   No one is for open borders.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey She’s actually far more conservative than Trump.  You know, things like free trade, respecting the FBI, being tough on Russia and other tyrants, not kidnapping kids at the border, not banning people based on religion.  But her emails
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey When you say things like “If they nominate a candidate too far left” you are just repeating a right wing/Fox News bullshit talking point.  If everyone says that it becomes believed.  Hillary Clinton ran on the most moderate platform ever and she was way too liberal.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey The crime there is the most evidence is obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct.  100+ tweets alone that would be classified as evidence for witness tampering and consciousness of guilt.  There’s a reason you’re NOT supposed to talk about ongoing investigations.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey You don’t understand.  The democrats could nominate “open borders amnesty” Ronald Reagan and he would be “too far left”.  Don’t buy the “too far left” BS.  Listen to the candidates directly about where they stand on issues and decide for yourself if they’re “too far left”.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey There is actual evidence.  There are tapes.  There is testimony. There are court documents. All this can be found on the google.  There’s not going to be   day in a courtroom where they say, here’s all the evidence on the President we can’t indict because he’s President.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey Let’s assume you’re right.  What does that have to do with Trump’s crimes? Nothing.  So you’re argument is because Hillary got away, Trump has the right to break the law? Not a great position.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey Lol if you believe that.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey There’s plenty of evidence, out in the open.  Individual 1 is Trump you know? His lawyer his going to jail for a felony Trump directed.  And that’s just a fraction.  Trump is above the law though so nothing to worry about.  We live in a Banana Republic now.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey Trump is already finished which is sad because I wanted him to do a good job.  Too much crime and ignorance though.  The exit strategy should be a great final season.  The rating will be huge.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey But I’m not even convinced the Democrats try to impeach.  It might to their advantage ride Trump out for 2020.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey There would be a trial in the senate before any vote takes place.  McConnell would be a fool to try to block.  It would undermine our entire democracy.  If impeachment in the House occurs, I don’t see Trump making it through a trial. I think he goes like Nixon.
@SemoTruman @pavolocoTD @Erecti1eReptile @Comey The Mueller report is irrelevant and the impeachment process has nothing to do with the law.  Look at it through Trump’s eyes.  Any GOP Senator publicly expressing dissent is a clear and present danger that must be squashed before it grows.
@pavolocoTD @SemoTruman @Erecti1eReptile @Comey Trump’s political fate is in the hands of 20 GOP Senators now.  That’s all it would take to remove him from office if the House impeached.  GOP Senators hold a lot more power today than they did yesterday.

46/Strike with the power of your spirit and moral superiority. If you don't have that power, it's high time you develop it.
45/Don't be combative for the sake of being combative, the enemy will win when you do this.
44/The key to preventing ideological subversion is FAITH. You simply have to have faith.
43/Technology will not protect societies from the threat like belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ, or a higher power/spirituality.
42/Preventing the importation of foreign influences would put a stop to the whole chain of events.
41/Put a stop the outside propaganda actively, not violently. Doing this would prevent demoralization.
40/Self restraint, restoration of spiritual identity, and sound moral principles are vital.
39/Prevention-  Laws could be put in place to prevent companies from allowing consumers too much exposure to foreign propaganda
38/Dissidents are eliminated/suppressed. 	Stability is required to then exploit the nation.
37/Stage 4: Normalization – The self appointed rulers don't need any revolution or radicalization anymore.
36/This leads to two possible outcomes: 1. Civil War. 2. Invasion.
35/Society is looking for a savior – some strong leader, population is sick and tired of the same old same old.
34/Society collapses- can't function properly. Power struggle occurs.
33/Stage 3: Crisis – The government systems cannot function anymore.
32/Divisive cultural issues come to the mainstream resulting in conflict, sometimes violently.
31/The media puts itself in opposition to the society at large - (cough, you know who).
30/Law and order erodes – Society becomes antagonistic within itself – divisions, fracturing.
29/-&gt;Leads to constant fighting-&gt;Compromise is impossible.
28/Radicalization also includes militarization. Polarization occurs among family, friends, and neighbors
27/Stage 2: Destabilization – You let your target population destabilize themselves.	Radicalization begins.
26/natural ideological tendencies are greatly taken advantage of by Russian propaganda.
25/^^This acts as a substitution of moral, patriotic, and ethical values because...
24/Anti-Media, anti-education, anti-science, anti-government, anti-anything of value to the society.
23/Stage 1: Demoralization – promote anti-establishment beliefs...
22/Almost every Russian student is taught subversion philosophy if they are thought to be dealing with foreigners is the future.
21/They enemy looks to you as an alternative where you can take them without firing a single shot.
20/until such time that the perception of reality is so screwed up they don't perceive you as an enemy.
19/The highest art of warfare is not to fight at all, but to subvert. Subvert anything of value in the country of your enemy...
18/To implement state policy in a warlike manner, it is often inefficient/foolish to do it on a battlefield.
17/The theory of subversion originated from Sun-Tzu over 2,500 years ago. (500 B.C.)
16/Subversion can only be successful when the agent of subversion has a receptive target. 	The United States is receptive of subversion.
15/Subversion is a two way street, you can't subvert someone who doesn't want/allow to be subverted.
14/In 1984, KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov did a seminar on KGB Psychological Warfare and Subversion Strategy; I’ll give the highlights:
13/Liberty and Justice for ALL, one INDIVISIBLE nation, under god.  &lt;—When this goes, it’s over.
12/The only thing safeguarding us is our sense of shared moral values, ethics, and faith in our democratic ideals institutions.
11/The Western Values of freedom of thought, expression, speech, and press makes us vulnerable to foreign influence.
10/UK, France, Germany, The United States all within the past two years have been attacked by Russian Active Measures Influence campaigns.
9/Russian Active Measures campaigns have been intensifying in western democracies
8/The vast majority of Russian intelligence operations are Active Measures Campaigns (Psychological/Information warfare and subversion)
7/Russia’s military strength, other than the nukes, is intelligence networks. However, only a fraction of it is espionage.
6/The Russians will deny every attack and play the victim.  Sounds familiar doesn’t it?
5/Important to note, for the Russians, there is no such thing as psychological, hybrid, or cyber warfare.  It’s just warfare.
4/The current Russian method seeks to promote distrust, confusion, and eventual paralysis of public institutions, discourse, and debate.
3/While Soviet Active Measures campaigns of old would promote a pro-Kremlin agenda, the new form is more nihilistic and less ideological.
2/In 2015 Ben Nimmo and Edward Lucas did analysis of Russia’s updated tactics.  suggested reading..	https://t.co/IofVLvnMBP
