I laughed when I read the @WSJ op-ed about the presumptive pick: https://t.co/ZtAefrNxiF. 	 	"Condolences to our longtime contributor David Malpass," it begins. "He can expect bitter resistance from the bank's bureaucracy and its clients to even mild reforms."
Compared to some of the other names under consideration, his is one that is known — positively or negatively, by counterparts at the World Bank and in countries around the world.
Back to what's likely to happen... "Fears that Mr Malpass could lead the World Bank on a radical new Trumpian course may be exaggerated," @JamesPoliti and @Sam1Fleming write. https://t.co/fyRdZInPDP
"Six people familiar with the matter" told @SalehaMohsin former officials described David Malpass as "disdainful of some civil servants and often unprepared."
“About 20 career staff have quit the U.S. Treasury Department's international affairs unit in less than a year," she writes. "The wave of departures began in September, shortly after David Malpass ... took over the division."
You should read this piece, from last July, by @business's @SalehaMohsin, about what it was — is? — like to work at the Treasury Department under David Malpass: https://t.co/iIINg2uy9G. It also sheds light on Malpass's relationship with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
One wonders what this pick means for talks between the United States and China, as a deadline looms. David Malpass has been an active participant in those negotiations. Per @business, he has played a “central role."
So, what to make of this appointment? “Having [David] Malpass at the helm of the World Bank would fit a pattern inside the Trump administration of tapping officials to lead institutions whose core missions they have publicly questioned or opposed." https://t.co/b8nYPPwNum
Another choice quotation: "The constant warnings of a housing-related collapse in domestic consumption overstates the importance of housing in the economy, while understating the importance of jobs and economic growth, both of which have been solid."
"Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation," he wrote. "It's more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years."
On August 7th, 2007, David Malpass wrote a now-infamous @WSJ op-ed with this headline: “Don't Panic About the Credit Market” (https://t.co/qHVEsz7KQd). 	 	It hasn't aged well.
I have talked to David Malpass many times. This is the note I have scrawled in my Rolodex, next to his contact information: "Call home after 7:00 a.m. Prior to that, clearly OK to wake me if it's a global emergency." 	 	He wakes up early, which is good for a reporter on deadline.
At 1:30 p.m. ET, President Trump is expected to name David Malpass, currently the Treasury Department's undersecretary of international affairs, as his pick to head the World Bank.
"Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives," President Trump said, using El Paso, Texas, as an example. 	 	Here is what El Paso County Sheriff Richard Wiles told @CalNBC after the speech: 	 	"El Paso was a safe city long before the wall was built." 	  	https://t.co/JjXSk6ccne

One last thing... We know a lot about another "informal dinner" President Trump had at the White House, with James @Comey. So, one has to ask, "Was there a moment during Monday night's dinner when Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin left the room?"
A good backgrounder on how today's meeting came about, from the @WSJ: https://t.co/ox6KB2r8iP. 	 	There is a memorable line, from Larry Kudlow: "A meeting between the two should be helpful. Right now, their relationship is like a stock looking for a bottom. There's only upside."
It read, "In the afternoon, the President will meet with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to discuss the state of the American and global economy, Wall Street Reform, and the long-term economic outlook; the Vice President will also attend."
That meeting, by the way, was something we knew about in advance. It was on President Obama's daily guidance and press schedule: https://t.co/VXAZ1WbZNi.
On April 16, 2016, after President Obama and Fed Chair Yellen met in the Oval Office, the White House supplied a readout: https://t.co/rUr43uWFls.
In 2017, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen said this to the Commonwealth Club of California: "I have never had a situation where a member of the [Obama] administration has tried in any way to pressure me for any reason about the stance of monetary policy." https://t.co/Z38WdqauYu
A week earlier, he issued this directive to Federal Reserve policymakers, again on Twitter: "Stop with the 50 B's. Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers."
On Christmas Eve, President Trump tweeted this: "The only problem our economy has is the Fed." 		He continued, "The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!"
It is good to know what the Fed chair says he said, but this is a one-sided readout. What did the president say? What questions did he ask?
Thanks to the Federal Reserve, not the White House, we know Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Vice Chair Richard Clarida, President Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had "an informal dinner" Monday night. https://t.co/mXrVSKwtsf

I'll close with this coda: George Soros delivered his remarks hours after we learned the Chinese government "has appeared to block" Microsoft's search engine. https://t.co/3Nsd2xq4Os
"If these companies" — Huawei and ZTE — "came to dominate the 5G market, they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world."
He also suggested the U.S. narrow its trade war, to "focus on #China."		"Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly, it needs to crack down on them."	 	Why? 	 	5G
Returning to #China, George Soros called for an "American economic response to the Belt and Road Initiative."
George Soros said that, when it comes to the "enemies of open societies" — and here, he mentioned President Putin, "the most dangerous scenario is when these enemies conspire with, and learn from, each other on how to better oppress their people."
Although George Soros focuses on #China, he made this broader point: "Authoritarian regimes are proliferating all over the world and if they succeed, they will become totalitarian." https://t.co/e5IP6EyMpd
In Davos, George Soros called Xi Jinping "the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society."
The billionaire philanthropist spent most of the speech on #China, and its social credit system, which he called "frightening and abhorrent." 	  	"It will subordinate the fate of the individual to the interests of the one-party state in ways unprecedented in history."
George Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum "to call attention to the mortal danger facing open societies from the instruments of control that machine learning and artificial intelligence can put in the hands of repressive regimes." https://t.co/6ZhLUfpccb

TONIGHT: "We have a fine man in Matt Whitaker," President Trump says. "Matt Whitaker is a tremendous person." 	 	NOVEMBER 9, 2018: "I don’t know Matt Whitaker."
In recent days, President Trump has attacked the judiciary. Now, @SecNielsen is doing the same thing: "Absent Congressional action," she writes, "courts have misinterpreted existing laws and have made the job of law enforcement far more difficult."
She continues, "Instead of 'a political stunt,' as suggested by some, this was in fact the act of a leader concerned about the rule of law."
Then, the obligatory genuflection: "I want to thank President Donald J. Trump again for the decision to send @DeptofDefense to the border to bolster our ports of entry and provide force protection for Customs and Border Protection."
She says, "I ask parents to avoid violent caravan groups and refrain from attempts to illegally enter our country – these acts will put your children in danger." How is she conveying this, in Spanish, K'iche, and other languages, to migrants who can't read her Facebook post?
Of the Border Patrol, @SecNielsen says, "It is a testament to their training and professionalism that no one was injured." Again, this contradicts what President Trump said tonight: "Three Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt, getting hit with rocks and stones."
Again, how could she know this?
After noting "we cannot confirm the backgrounds and identities of all caravan members which possess a national security and public safety risk to our country," @SecNielsen says "we have confirmed that there are over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow."
She doubles down on the "grabbers" narrative President Trump has embraced: "It appears in some cases that the limited number of women and children in the caravan are being used by the organizers as 'human shields' when they confront law enforcement."
How could @SecNielsen know this: "The overwhelming majority of these individuals are not eligible for asylum in the United States under our laws"?

President Trump, to reporters: "The tear gas is a very minor form of the tear gas itself. It's very safe."

Per @jeannasmialek, "The Federal Reserve Act says governors may be 'removed for cause by the President.' Since the chairman is also a governor, that presumably extends to him or her, but the rules around firing the leader are legally ambiguous." https://t.co/1BI5IdFAji https://t.co/ih042LmDGI

En route to Pittsburgh.
Per Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh's public safety director, he will brief reporters again at 4:00 p.m. ET, with the special agent in charge, the U.S. attorney, and elected officials.
Pittsburgh's public safety director, Wendell Hissrich, will not comment on how many individuals were inside the synagogue. "My understanding is there was a service."
"This will be a lengthy crime scene," Wendell Hissrich says. "There appears to be no active threat to the community." https://t.co/f4MKLvRyD4
"We have had a tragedy here today," Wendell Hissrich tells reporters. (He is Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director.) He continues, "The scene is very bad inside."
During his media availability at Joint Base Andrews, President Trump referred to the "results" of the attack in Pittsburgh. "The results are coming in, of what took place, how it took place." "If they had better protection inside, the results would have been far better."
Asked about the National Rifle Association (NRA), President Trump says this to reporters gathered at Joint Base Andrews: "We're always talking."
"Should all synagogues and churches have armed guards?" a reporter asks, after the attack in Pittsburgh. "I hate to think of it that way," President Trump replies. "It's certainly an option."
After noting no one knows all the facts yet, President Trump says this, of the attack in Pittsburgh: "This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to stop him immediately."
President Trump, on the Pittsburgh attack: "The world is a violent world, and you think when you're over it it just sort of goes away, but then it comes back in the form of a madman, a wacko. I think one thing we should do is stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty."
President Trump, commenting on the attack in Pittsburgh, uses the word "results": "The results are coming in of what took place, how it took place."
Asked about gun control, President Trump says this: "If they had better protection inside, the results would have been far better."
President Trump, speaking at Joint Base Andrews, about the attack in Pittsburgh: "It's just a shame, to watch this and to see this."
"It is a terrible, terrible thing what is going on with hate," President Trump says, at Joint Base Andrews. "And something has to be done."
President Trump is now addressing what he calls "the events of Squirrel Hill."
The man who has been arrested in Pittsburgh, @NBCNews's @PeteWilliamsNBC reports, is Rob Bowers, 46.
President Trump says he "will speak to the media shortly" about the attack in Pittsburgh. He also says he will make another statement at the National FFA Organization's conference in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The president tweets this, with the Dow close to erasing its gains for the year, and Cater­pil­lar saying "it would have to raise prices for most of its ma­chines and en­gines next year to off­set ris­ing ma­te­ri­als costs, as well as tar­iffs" (@WSJ): https://t.co/lz9jvTpszy
It is unclear where that figure comes from, if anywhere.
"Nearly 40 percent of young girls that [sic] make their way into our country at the hands of human traffickers are sexually abused," he claims.
At this point in his four-minute answer, after saying the caravan is "being sent north to challenge our sovereignty and our border," Vice President Pence says that what this is really about—the caravan, the White House's position—is human trafficking.
This represents a change in the administration's spin. In recent days, President Trump has said Democrats "wanted that caravan." One of his supporters in congress, @RepMattGaetz, has claimed—without evidence—George Soros is funding it.
He claims President Hernández (Honduras) told him the caravan was "organized by leftist gangs in Honduras," and it is "financed by Venezuela."
The vice president then cites conversations he has had with Juan Orlando Hernández, the president of Honduras, and Jimmy Morales, the president of Guatemala, about the caravan.
Here are those @CBP data, by fiscal year, BTW: https://t.co/iyDI1tYRiQ.
I assume "the lexicon" is how the U.S. Border Patrol categorizes apprehensions. There is nothing to indicate "Other than Mexico" doesn't mean, well, countries other than Mexico.
Let's continue to make our way through the vice president's answer. In this context, he defines "terrorists or suspected terrorists" as individuals "from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as 'Other than Mexico,'" which he defines as "from the Middle East region."
At the time, @PolitiFact fact-checked that smaller figure. Its conclusion? "Pants on Fire." https://t.co/eRrHSKSaR6
In February, the vice president said this: "...we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists."
Vice President Pence continued, "In the last fiscal year, we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border."
For those keeping score at home, the vice president's answer contains no evidence.
"It is inconvincible that there are not people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than 7,000 people advancing toward our border."
Asked by @costareports to provide evidence to back-up President Trump's dubious claim there are Middle Easterners in the migrant caravan, Vice President Mike Pence says this:
