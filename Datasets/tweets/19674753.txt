Wintersteen: Together, we can ‚ÄØbuild ‚ÄØupon our great historic land-grant foundation and make Iowa, our nation and this world a better place for future generations.‚ÄØ Thank you for supporting Iowa State University and allowing me to serve.
Wintersteen: I believe in the future of #IowaState ‚Äì in the potential of our students, the excellence of our researchers, the transformative power of our educators, and the strategic commitment and dedication of our staff.
Wintersteen: It is an exciting time to be the president of #IowaState, But it is also a challenging time. We will serve, lead and ultimately excel by constantly innovating.
Wintersteen: I will make it priority to recruit, nurture and retain excellent faculty. We must continue those efforts by seeking funds to support their needs for world-class facilities, graduate assistants and research.
Wintersteen: I will reward and recognize the excellence of our teachers and the success they achieve in the classroom. We must continue to make the student-centered experience a priority for every college.
Wintersteen: For decades, #IowaState has been an engine of economic development for the state and a powerful resource for companies in solving technical problems. I want to see the ISU Research Park flourish.
Wintersteen: I intend to establish a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem where innovating is built into the curriculum, and where innovations and entrepreneurial ideas come from our students, faculty and staff and that they receive appropriate support to move those ideas forward.
Wintersteen: I want a spirit of entrepreneurism to be a significant part of the Iowa State brand ‚Äì one of the special things that sets us apart. Iowa State must be different, it must stand out from the pack. Then it must be better than the rest.
Wintersteen (on #IowaState alumni): The impact of their giving is seen in every corner of this beautiful campus, sustaining the university's land-grant mission of teaching, research, extension and service.
Wintersteen: As I walk across campus each day greeting students, a part of me wonders, ‚ÄòIs that young man or young woman the next George Washington Carver? What inventions and discoveries will these students make to help the world?‚Äô
Wintersteen: Being welcoming and inclusive is built into the DNA of this university from its founding moments. I intend to nurture this ideal and energize it for all those who come after me. It is one of my top priorities.
Wintersteen: I sensed that Iowa State may be looking for a president who understood the history and culture at Iowa State. I decided to lean in and take that chance ‚Äì to be part of this historic opportunity. I am so glad to have been selected to serve.
Wintersteen: I pledge to lead Iowa State forward to becoming the best land-grant university in the nation. We will excel in our world-class science &amp; research, our classrooms &amp; hands-on teaching labs, &amp; in our land-grant mission to support the people &amp; economic vitality of Iowa.
Wintersteen: As president, I promise to serve this great university so that it may reach its highest potential.
Wintersteen: I am very honored and humbled to stand before you today as the 16th president of Iowa State University, and as a proud graduate of this extraordinary institution.

Thank you for joining us. Ben Allen's address will be available on the @IowaStateU YouTube page -&gt; https://t.co/qy12TwwV2Y #goodnight https://t.co/kYIukmHsVZ
Allen: These students will make a difference in the world and our faculty and staff are preparing them to do that.
Allen: It has been wonderful to return to #IowaState. I see growth, progress, excitement and energy throughout campus.
Allen: Next president will fill 3 key positions -- VP for human resources, VP for extension/outreach and Vet Med dean.
Allen: Appreciate everyone's involvement, patience in moving from legacy computer system to Workday enterprise software.
Allen: Cost savings and efficiencies have been a long-standing university commitment. Discussions on reallocation efforts to come.
Allen: 4 priorities- &gt; retain top fac/staff; recruit/increase faculty; invest in building capacity/maintenance; need-based financial aid
Allen: We are a public institution and state support is vital.
Allen: ISU's 5-year tuition plan is not based on how we compare to our peer institutions.
Allen: Another key challenge we face is the budget. Our state appropriation dropped more than $56 million in past 8 years.
Allen: It is the responsibility of everyone at ISU to work toward a safe, inclusive community.
Allen: This year, I challenge you to work each day to live out the Principles of Community. https://t.co/Jw12Ry43zx
Allen: Launching a comprehensive campus climate survey Oct. 3 to assess our policies and programs.
Allen: Campus leadership has been assessing our approach to campus climate to ensure we're thoughtful, proactive.
Allen: We're reaching out to those in ISU community impacted by recent federal decision to end the DACA program.
Allen: It's important to acknowledge the challenges our campus and country are facing.
Allen: Every dollar of the #ForeverTrueForISU campaign is directed for a purpose. Students are reaping the biggest benefits.
Allen: The proceeds from the Curriculum Associates gift will generate $145 million for the @las_iastate, creating a permanent endowed fund.
Allen: The Forever True, For Iowa State campaign has raised $837 million to date. That's 76% of the $1.1 billion goal.
Allen: Retention, graduation and placement rates remain strong, even with rapid enrollment growth.
Allen: It's very clear #IowaState is moving in a positive direction. It's the school of choice in Iowa.
Allen: I'm here to ensure we don't lose any momentum. I hope to offer some stability.
Allen: It's an exciting new academic year and a time of transition. Only the 16th time in ISU's 159-yr history a new president will be named

That's a wrap for @IASTATE_Pres Leath's address. The text and video will be available online -&gt; https://t.co/DkV4JlMSdA. #IowaState
Q on high-impact educational activities: Programs outside of the classroom that can make a difference to students (ex: @AbroadIsu).
Leath: Trying to make this as fair as possible. Things can be equitable without being equal. Students encouraged to share/engage in process.
Q about tiered tuition: In calculating cost of instruction, it increases as students progress; studied similar practices at other schools.
Q on grad student climate: Faculty care deeply about grad students and know success of research depends heavily on them.
Q on integrating int'l students into campus: Need to do a better job; launched new orientation program and mandatory class to help
Q about possible 2% tuition increase: Numbers aren't finalized; a percentage would be bigger burden on nonresidents.
Q about external funding: Some are grants are restricted; some private donations are general gifts, large amt are earmarked.
Q about sexual assault initiatives: We are making progress, seeing higher level of reporting, have training/response teams.
Leath: We try to use our faculty more to talk to legislators who make policies.
Audience question: How can we keep ISU graduates in Iowa to help with mental health issues in the state?
Leath: Look forward to how we will elevate ISU to the next level, move our reputation to unwavering excellence.
Leath: Hold each other accountable when we fail to act within the Principles of Community.
Leath: Free expression is welcomed and encouraged anywhere on campus, just don't interfere/impede university activities.
Leath: Being on a campus community, you should encounter different opinions and thoughts ... but you should be respectful.
Principles of Community --&gt; https://t.co/REbSM58KuX #IowaState
Leath: Asking everyone to recommit to "Principles of Community," drafted a decade ago to encourage an inclusive campus.
Leath: Safety and well-being of everyone on campus is paramount.
Leath: @ISUPD stepped up safety/prevention initiatives, including safe ride app; multicultural officer program.
Leath: Expanded services for int'l students; improved student health services; launched health/wellness/safety initiative.
Leath: Expanding Office of VP for diversity/inclusion with additional program directors (LGBTQA+, Hispanic/Latinx).
Leath: Goal 4 is to continue to enhance/cultivate the ISU experience; where all feel safe, welcome, included, valued.
Leath: Made a commitment to double the size of @ISUResearchPark; that is moving "full steam ahead;" asking @IowaRegents to add 80 acres.
Leath: Created a 1-stop shop for economic development assistance with the opening of the Economic Dev Core Facility in @ISUResearchPark.
Leath: ISU was designated an innovation and economic prosperity university by @APLU_News, one of just 54 overall and the only one in Iowa.
Leath: Can't thank @ISUExtension enough for taking the value of Iowa State throughout the state, making it a 99-county campus.
Leath: 1 in 3 Iowans benefits from @ISUExtension programs.
Leath: Goal 3 is to improve quality of life for Iowans through services/programs.
Leath: Making progress on expansion of research facilities; new capital project includes $120 million Vet Diagnostic Lab.
Leath: Early success allows Interdisciplinary Research Initiative to expand and focus new funding on data-driven science.
Leath: Faculty secured a record $425.8 million in external funding last year; research funding increased 12% to $252.5 million.
Leath: Goal 2 of strategic plan is to enhance ISU's research profile w/high-impact research to meet challenges of 21st century.
Leath: Funds will help w/facilities, campus beautification, fac/staff recruitment and retention, student-to-faculty ratio.
Leath: "Moving Students Forward" surpassed its 5-year goal of $150 million, so upped goal to $200 million.
Leath: We are ahead of schedule on "Moving Students Forward" funding and will add to it -- lowered debt by 8.5%.
Leath: To ease the financial burden, we will continue to raise private funding support.
Leath: We gave this very careful consideration. Iowa State will remain one of the most affordable options among its peers.
Leath: Proposing a 2-tier tuition structure, phased in over 3 years. Frosh/sophs would have a lower rate than jrs/srs.
Leath: We're going to have to make adjustments to revenue streams we can control. Unfortunately, that's tuition and fees.
Leath: In 2008, ISU received about $12,700 per resident student in state funding; now that's only $9,400.
Leath: Our enrollment has increased over last 8 years, but state appropriations per resident students is rapidly declining.
Leath: We want to grow at a pace that allows us to protect and maintain our quality.
Leath: A comprehensive campus climate assessment system will help measure the educational experience of underrepresented students.
Leath: Goal one is to put students first, ensuring access to the ISU experience.
Leath: The university's overall mission and vision has not changed. We want the results of our science and scholarship to make a difference.
You can find the strategic plan online here -&gt; https://t.co/ygLFZIeJzK #IowaState
Leath: The strategic plan's four overarching goals will not change. The subgoals will be revisited annually.
Leath: We want to make sure the plan doesn't just sit on a shelf. It should be a living document that reflects the changing needs of ISU.
Leath on new university strategic plan: Broad input was key in development of comprehensive goals, metrics and action items.
Leath is introducing several of the newest leaders on campus. He also said he has a couple new appts to @NCAA roles.
. @IASTATE_Pres Steven Leath: Our campus is growing, but remains close-knit. We are working to become more diverse, yet more inclusive.

A: Working with faculty/students on thoughtful approach. We're not in a hurry. We want to get this right.
Q: Any initiatives for restructuring Veishea?
A: Students in favor of modest increase, want it to go toward student growth. Will use it for that growth. About $2.5mi per year.
Q: How much money will tuition hike raise?
Leath is wrapping up his remarks and will take questions from the audience. http://t.co/BfzCTj48II
Leath: For the first time, ISU's 5-yr strategic plan will align with @IowaRegents and @isufoundation strategic plans.
Leath: Making a more targeted approach to addressing growth. Asking Faculty Senate to help identify ways to address needs.
Leath: Scrutinizing the budget model. It's effective, but has some unintended consequences. Many of the costs being charged are too high.
Leath on operational priorities: Move an organizations forward by identifying ways to operate more efficiently and effectively.
Leath: Will use campus climate survey results to examine current practices; what works and what doesn't.
Leath: Ramping up efforts to address sexual assault and related crimes. Natl survey results will be released publicly.
Leath: Working aggressively to overhaul the Thielen Student Health Center. I'm confident that students will see improvements in care.
Leath: People need to feel welcome, safe and included to feel at home here. Lots of good things happening.
Leath: I do not endorse candidates, but any candidate who wants to talk higher ed policy, I will embrace that opportunity.
Leath: Two initiatives focus on classroom technology and learning; adapting to the changing ways our students learn.
Leath: We are adding space AND making significant upgrades. For example, The Hub, Lago, Marston, Osborn Drive, 214 classrooms.
Leath on new @ISUBuchananHall under construction: "Janet and I will keep a virtual eye on the 780 students across the street."
Leath: When we move units to campustown and research park, we will repurpose the campus spaces for academic and student use.
Leath: Look for improvements to the @ISURecS fields as well; for example, lights and artificial turf.
Leath: With Jack Trice stadium improvements complete, turning attention to @ReimanGardensIA.
Leath: Big things are happening in the @ISUResearchPark; it's getting larger and creating more jobs. It's tremendous for the students.
Leath: Expanding capacity is critical. The Student Innovation Center will add 165,000 square feet of academic space.
Leath: Additional funding will be used to support new faculty hires and lower the student-faculty ratio. Goal is at least 16:1.
Leath: Funding priority this year is additional $$ for fac/staff salaries. Asking for $8.2mil additional recurring dollars.
Leath: Particularly disappointed we were not able to provide better salary increases. Very challenging legislative year.
Leath: We wouldn't be where we are without outstanding faculty and staff. Doing everything we can to attract the best people.
Leath: As research enterprise expands, will strengthen position in emerging field of big data. Data science impacts every field.
Leath: Presidential Initiative for Interdisciplinary Research has resulted in $257mil in grant apps; $24mil in new funding.
Leath: Our faculty should be go-to experts, they are doing exceptional work to fulfill research/service components of land-grant mission.
Leath: ISU has two new National Academy members -- Ronald Leonard (Natl Academy of Engineering); Cathy Kling (Natl Academy of Sciences).
Leath: We have finalized plans for a new university-wide fundraising campaign. Want to use it to promote visibility and profile of ISU.
Leath: Raised $145mil for the Moving Students Forward scholarship campaign in just 3 years. Need to continue, so expanding to $200mil goal.
Leath on affordability, accessibility and quality: Access and affordability without quality is no bargain.
Leath acknowledged long-time staffers @ISUVPSAHill, univ counsel Paul Tanaka and @chs_iastate dean Pam White; all retiring.
Leath: Our reputation is extremely strong. Students are choosing ISU for its commitment to the land-grant mission; support; grad success.
Leath: Most of the growth in ag, engineering and business.
Leath: Demand for an Iowa State degree is as high as it's ever been. Shows in enrollment (36,001).
Leath: Excited and optimistic for this academic year after another exceptional year with many accomplishments.
