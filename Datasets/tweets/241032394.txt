@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos Thanks sir. God bless
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos Huh,sir why should there be a fund for them? It's bcos they're not on the first line fund that NASS enjoy. Before the TSA regime,every commission or agency has their fund.
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos With all due respect,I hope u're clearified with those explaination. I'm not competing for knowledge with you but just trying to share my humble and privileged experience. Thanks
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos As per why I mentioned federal civil service commission,I was working with police Service commission b4 n was abt transfrng my service 2 NASC b4 I got a better offer somewhr. But d transfer of service was handled by federal civil service commission.
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos Just like state house staff, national refugee commission, police Service commission,DSS etc are all agencies under presidency but their funding does not come from the first line charge  dat d office of d president enjoy but thru CBN via ministry of finance
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos Sir I'm only on this out of d respect I've 4 u n I really wanna share my experience wid u so u could add 2 ur much knowledge. The thing is u don't av 2 get entangled in that web of entitled knowledge. NASC is an agency under NASS bt her funding dos not com frm d 1st line charge
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos Why did u pick just dat up? In a nutshell, public servant belongs 2 corperatns, agencies &amp; parastatals whose duties r mostly specific n self financing whereas civil servants r ministry staff wit diverse responsibilities. NASC is a public agency. Admntrativly, there's no much diff
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos No sir,you don't seem to understand what I'm trying to put across here. NASC staff are federal civil servants with federal civil service numbers,NHIS,NHF,PAYE,etc? Ask staff of NASC to tell you how that place is runned.
@sarnchos @oderathekid @DrJoeAbah Lol, who's taking abt NASS budget &amp; finances? The topic is 'NASS service commission',their budget, expenditure, pensions are regulated by appropriate government agencies such as ministry of finance, accountant general of the federation, national pension commission,etc.
@sarnchos @oderathekid @DrJoeAbah I've the Act but we're talking administratively in a TSA regime. You can investigate that
@sarnchos @oderathekid @DrJoeAbah No now, they've their budget separately but have to submit it to the NASS just as any other commission in the country does.
@DrJoeAbah @IsmaeelAhmedB @sarnchos No sir. Despite the fact that it's a semi independent body like any other commission in the country, it's still regulated by federal civil service commission and accountant general of the federation. And all of them are under SGF-secretary to the government of the federation!
