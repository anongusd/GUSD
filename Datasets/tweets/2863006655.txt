Rep. Lawrence Votes to Defend Americans‚Äô Health Care and Protect People with Pre-Existing Conditions | Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence https://t.co/PNFUnOVFOp
Tweet: 67 million. That‚Äôs how many women and girls in America live with pre-existing conditions ‚Äì I‚Äôm proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats in ensuring the #GOP does not stand in the way of that care. You with me? #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/fcMVeWoshj
Do you have one of the pre-existing conditions below? Bad news. The GOP is working to kill the systems of care that ensure your protection. We can‚Äôt let that happen. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/4ZcS3OpicH
Trump walked out on this meeting the same way he has walked out on 800,000 federal workers who don‚Äôt know when their next paycheck is coming. This  #TrumpShutdown is the TRUE CRISIS. Border security negotiations do NOT require a shutdown! #EndTheShutdown  https://t.co/FjLkDgyjVO
Last week, my House colleagues &amp; I voted to reopen the government ‚Äì and this week, we‚Äôre going to do it again. When will Republicans step up and help end this irresponsible #TrumpShutdown?
There is no justification for President Trump to keep government shut down, endangering critical services for the American people and the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers, over his demand for a wall. #EndTheShutdown #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/aiMThPzs5T

This #TrumpShutown is harming federal employees, including law enforcement, public safety personnel, and Coast Guard service members and the American public they serve. #EnoughIsEnough #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/dlNPGi9evS
Trump uses fear, NOT facts to justify hurting millions of Americans for his wall. Democrats are willing to discuss the best way to keep the border secure, but there is NO reason for the government to be shut down while those discussions take place. https://t.co/sqFfNAdHZh
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That‚Äôs not a pattern ‚Äì that‚Äôs an epidemic. Congress has to step up &amp; pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place. #NeverAgain https://t.co/lcEtSVKpJk
