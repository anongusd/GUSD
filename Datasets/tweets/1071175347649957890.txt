Sadly, we are seeing a resurgence of Fascism and a breakdown of that liberal order. These Senators, standing up for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers is pushing back against that breakdown -- its a good thing...
Following that, that same liberal order beat/outlasted/outmaneuvered the Communists and ended WWII (or so we thought). This post-WWII order shaped the world for decades around international trade, cooperation, and institutions -- put in place to prevent genocide and help refugees
Thanks, mate. If you would like more credit for the Brits in winning WWII -- you get credit! Otherwise, I think the larger point is that a generation (some might call the Greatest Generation) of freedom loving patriots in Western, liberal countries, beat Fascism
@Dale_Cleary @PatriciaLKearn1 @realDonaldTrump @GOP The US and Russia defeated Fascism in Europe. The US rebuilt a liberal Europe and Communism fell. What are u arguing about?

@ProudResister @GOP It‚Äôs not up to the @GOP. It‚Äôs up to @FoxNews. I don‚Äôt think @seanhannity or the @realDonaldTrump base will care what #mueller finds. They‚Äôve been preparing the base for this. That‚Äôs what happens when you drink the Faux News kool-aid. #propaganda

These headlines are wack. This is why we we spent 2016 talking about @HillaryClinton‚Äôs #emails.  Time to stop taking the @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs bait @AP. https://t.co/g6bsK8o7gn
#Putin plays @realDonaldTrump and the #Republicans. Even the @NRA has been coopted. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when your party is ideologically bankrupt and completely corrupt.  #IndividualNumber1 #individual1 #trump #treason #MAGA https://t.co/MYlpaFm6V0
