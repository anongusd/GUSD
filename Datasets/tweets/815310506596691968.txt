Though our work is not yet complete, the sacrifices made in Selma that day paved the way for so many Americans to seize on that sense of hope and fight to realize a more perfect union.
"Be bold. Be optimistic. Never lose that sense of hope." Wise words from a living legend and someone I am honored to call my colleague, @RepJohnLewis. On this anniversary of Bloody Sunday, let us remember those who shed blood in pursuit of the right to vote. https://t.co/7IZmaJqFdg
I’ve heard from law enforcement and groups including @MomsDemand, as well as parents and students in my own community with their personal stories about how background checks save lives.
That’s why I was proud this week to support HR 8, to require background checks, and why I voted to close the gun show and Charleston loopholes.
Ninety-two percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases — to help stop criminals, terrorists, and those with mental illnesses from buying weapons. There can be no exceptions when it comes to the safety of our families and children. https://t.co/vLB35Rta8X

If the tunnels between NY and NJ fail, the national economy would lose $16 billion over a four-year span-equivalent to the loss of 132,000 jobs, 33,000 jobs a year. @RepPeteKing and I want to know what the plan is if that happens - we cannot afford to sit and wait for a disaster. https://t.co/ovsiPQt02D
That's why @RepPeteKing and I want to know what the Administration plans to do if that happens so we introduced legislation to find out exactly that. What is the 'Doomsday plan'?
The century old tunnels that connect NY and NJ carry 200,000 passengers and 20% of the nation's GDP every day. If those tunnels were to fail, it'd be nothing short of a disaster. https://t.co/eR5X6v3bvN

In this case, the President has overreached — and is doing so for unacceptable political reasons.  Democrats and Republicans agree: We all need to do more to protect our borders, but the President needs to work with us, not just take unilateral action.
National emergencies are no way to govern, and, worse, we can’t afford to take resources from the Pentagon and programs vital to protecting our service members and our national security. Congress has a clearly delineated Constitutional role and so does the President.

We must open the government as soon as we can, and that means we need to keep talking. The shutdown has been devastating for our small businesses, our food safety, and the safety of our skies.	https://t.co/kc71MQJYix
Each day the government remains shutdown, we are losing money. Our economy cannot keep taking these hits. We need to come to the table and find an agreement to get the government back open and get back to work.	https://t.co/O0tmjaiin7
Paying for college is complicated, and we are here to help. Come join my office and experts from the Department of Education on Wednesday January 23 at 5:30pm at Teaneck High School to learn about the options available to make college more affordable https://t.co/MBNll1E2UD
There is too much at stake to play political games with the safety and security of our law enforcement, our skies, and even the food we eat is at risk. https://t.co/2HkFUbt6jJ
Our talks on the shutdown have been productive and constructive, but we have to keep negotiating to make sure we can reopen the government. 	https://t.co/T9GYk9uNFG
You’re never going to solve a problem if you’re not talking. Part of the problem is both sides are not talking. To come to an agreement to reopen the government, we have to keep working at it and we have to stay at the table.	https://t.co/EFyPaon2pq
Enough is enough. We must come to the table and find a deal to reopen the government immediately. The safety and security of our law enforcement, our skies, and even the food we eat is at stake. https://t.co/sQo6UwC8oR
Also in attendance were Assemblyman Wirth, Freeholder Gardner, and Whyte Mayor Jeff Herb.
Last week, #TeamGottheimer attended the opening one of the largest solar fields on the east coast at DSM in Belvidere. The new solar field will provide sustainable, clean energy for the DSM facility for years to come. https://t.co/gMi5vRLIH1
For the sake of our children and our families, we must open the government immediately.	https://t.co/sRH68Hdt6w
The FDA is in charge of inspecting roughly eighty percent of our food supply. Yet, forty-one percent of the FDA’s 17,000 employees are currently furloughed when they should be inspecting the lettuce, the cereal, the ice cream you bring into your homes every day.
On the train back to NJ! We just got done voting to reopen the government. I know that there is a bipartisan path forward that will reopen the government to protect our safety, security, and businesses, and pay those working without pay. https://t.co/wMdtXPZnw1
Yesterday’s meeting at the White House was productive and I am hopeful that, if we keep working together, we can find a path forward. I fundamentally believe that getting the government reopen is essential to our safety, security, and economy. https://t.co/2Hiv34qzLE
Today's conversations between the Problem Solvers Caucus and the White House were constructive. There is a path forward and the only way that path is realized is for us to stay at the table and keep working to open the government https://t.co/ZT28epDjsd
Concerned parents and a local medical expert in infectious diseases both know all too well the risks of sidelining FDA inspectors. We should not have to fear for our children because the government is playing shutdown politics.	https://t.co/KPF2kSBUOJ
Also joining us were Freeholder Chair Ortiz, Freeholder Vice Chair Amoroso, Assemblywoman Huttle, and Teaneck council members.
Last Thursday, #TeamGottheimer was in Teaneck for the opening of Bryant Elementary School’s new preschool. The new preschool will support families and make sure our children have the best educational options possible. https://t.co/n4iGj3b0Sj

Just recently we had an e. Coli outbreak in lettuce and now we have no one to inspect lettuce. Earlier this year, more than 100 people got salmonella from their cereal. Who at the FDA is making sure this doesn’t happen again? https://t.co/GsUIi0AVmj
While the FDA decision to resume inspections for the most high risk food is a first step, we cannot continue to cut corners when it comes to the safety of our families and our children. We must work together, Democrats and Republicans, to reopen the government.

The partial government shutdown is jeopardizing the safety of our skies, our food safety, and small businesses that are the lifeblood of our community. We need to reopen the government and start to solve problems for the American people.	https://t.co/08OJdzop6e
The shutdown must end. Any delay to the Gateway Project is unacceptable and this will not only harm the New Jersey-New York region, but also our country's economic growth. We must come together and move forward for the American people and keeping Gateway on track.
We must all come to the table and work to reopen the government immediately
The shutdown must end. The cost to the U.S. economy is $3.6 billion as of today, with another $1.2 billion estimated for each week it drags on (S&amp;P). The shutdown is bad for Jersey families and businesses.
Small businesses in my district like Alementary are stuck because of this government shutdown. We need to reopen the government and get back to doing our jobs so small businesses can continue to drive our economy in North Jersey.	https://t.co/gvcA6j2YZW
For breweries like Alementary, for craft beer lovers, for the New Jersey economy, for the safety of our citizens, Washington must reopen the government as soon as possible.

In my first term, I clawed back 16 percent more of our tax dollars - that's $290 per household in our District. I will keep working every day to bring more and more federal tax dollars back to North Jersey for our schools, our roads and bridges, and our infrastructure.
New Jersey residents got back a meager 82 cents for every $1 paid to Washington in 2017, according to a new report that highlights just how much New Jersey is subsidizing Moocher States like Alabama and Mississippi.  This is wrong and it cannot stand. 	https://t.co/cXI5zsEje5

We can do better, and especially in this era of divided government if we actually want to solve problems and get things done for folks, we have to work together.	https://t.co/7oqeeAvtkL
The current government shutdown is unacceptable -- it's costing our businesses, workers, and safety.  		I'll continue to do everything I can to reopen the government. Last week, we passed bills with bipartisan support to fund the government, and we'll do so again this week. https://t.co/R2x9DsUoJR

So she coordinated with local nonprofit Connect For Community and Thor Labs to help care for these students. Two years later, she puts together 175 bags a week with her mother and a few other volunteers for students across five schools, growing to six soon.

This town hall series would not have been the same without you.		I'm looking forward to hosting many more “Cup of Joe with Josh” Town Halls in the new Congress and always being available to talk with North Jersey families.
It is great to see so many people who care about our community coming together to have a productive discussion, and I appreciate Congressman Gottheimer taking these town halls to different diners across North Jersey and supporting small businesses like mine.”
River Edge Diner owner George Siderias told me, “I was excited to see so many people out to talk to the Congressman about what was on their minds and the issues that matter to them when they came to my diner.
I’ve really learned the importance of bipartisan problem solving from the scores of town halls and thousands of discussions.		By buying coffee and eggs, we have also supported small businesses from Bergen to Warren.
Every conversation that I've had at these local diners has helped to form my issue priorities and legislation in Congress. I’m always sharing stories and feedback from our constructive conversations with my colleagues.
As my first term comes to an end, I am deeply thankful that, in two years, I've had the opportunity to speak with thousands at 32 "Cup of Joe with Josh" Town Halls. https://t.co/jA3l7hoqvg

I am especially grateful for our first responders and men and women in uniform serving in our armed forces abroad, sacrificing their own holidays, to protect and families keep our country safe.
Earlier this week, I took a moment to visit the Capitol’s holiday tree to reflect and be thankful for all those working to make North Jersey an amazing place to live, work, and raise a family in 2018. https://t.co/3Wy1bPeIKS

We have to come to an agreement to fund the government so we can get this and so many more vital programs running again.
As a result of the shutdown, funding lapsed for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which provides life-saving domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, legal assistance to victims, and services to LGBTQ individuals.
We need to do everything we can to lower taxes and make living in New Jersey more affordable, and repealing the cap on SALT deductions is a crucial step in that process.
More than one million New Jersey families deduct more than $10,000 in federal taxes which means the federal Tax Hill Bill sent NJ taxes up, especially in northern NJ. The average SALT deduction in my District is more than $24,000.
One year ago today, the Federal Tax Hike Bill gutted the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for New Jersey, slamming the state with higher taxes.
Anyone requiring assistance with federal services or with questions about how the shutdown might impact them should please call my office at (202) 225-4465.
My office will continue to provide constituent services to ensure that no Fifth District resident is left behind because of the shutdown.
I will continue to work to get the government back open.
It is unacceptable that our security will suffer as the Departments of Homeland Security and State close, affecting everything from US Marshalls to airport security to drug interdiction. It’s time we solved problems — not shut down the government.
Shutdowns have an enormous impact on our economy, costing our country billions in lost economic activity and services.
Shutting the government down is no way to govern. I am down in Washington doing everything I can, working with both sides, to make sure we come to a solution and avoid a shutdown. I will continue to keep you updated as things change. https://t.co/lWK30lkSiI

I will never stop fighting for clean water and clean air for New Jersey families, and I will continue to call for testing, including discrete core testing, to ensure the Vernon Waste Mountain is not a threat to the community.

I want lower taxes and we are sick of footing the bill for the Moocher States.
It's time to fight back against double taxation and the Moocher States and reinstate to the State and Local Tax Deduction, so we can actually cut taxes for northern New Jersey families and small businesses.
More than one million New Jersey families deduct more than $10,000 in State and Local Taxes (SALT), which means the federal Tax Hill Bill sent NJ taxes up, especially in northern NJ. The average SALT deduction in my District is more than $24,000.
From my family to yours, wishing everyone a happy and family-filled Hanukkah. https://t.co/vdU2NKQERs
These commonsense reforms will help Congress deliver real results for the American people on their most important priorities that have been bottled up in Congress for too long.

...his unwavering patriotism, and his kindness toward all that knew him.
Even then, despite his towering legacy as a member of Congress, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, CIA Director, Vice President, and President, his humility during our chance meeting was fitting for the man that many will remember for his tireless commitment to our country...
I first met President Bush in the halls of the Capitol when I was 17, serving as a page in the United States Senate.
I was saddened to learn of the passing of former President George H.W. Bush. My thoughts are with entire Bush family as we remember the legacy of one of our country's finest public servants.

These commonsense rules changes will allow for the will of the majority to turn ideas into action and pass much-needed legislation.
The rules changes we are announcing today will make the House of Representatives work even better for the American people, and help remove the roadblocks to progress on these core priorities.
This November, voters not only asked for a new party at the helm, but asked for their core issues – health care, immigration, and infrastructure – to get solved.
I am pleased to report that, after months of constructive discussions, the Problem Solvers Caucus Democrats have reached an agreement to support Leader Pelosi so the Break the Gridlock rules changes will be adopted in January.
With health care, immigration, infrastructure, and jobs on the line, we simply can’t afford two more years of obstruction or gridlock. https://t.co/OEnJHvMiJH
Come January, Democrats will lead the House, but the Senate and White House will continue to be controlled by the Republicans. If we are going to get anything done, we will have to work together. 		https://t.co/xFcOovJJ21

This November, voters sent a loud and clear message: They want us to get real results on health care, immigration, and infrastructure. We need real rules reform to get legislation with broad support, an honest debate, and a simple up-or-down vote. https://t.co/TYeUpmsuu9

Like most of you, I’m sick and tired of the gridlock and obstructionism, when we have so much on the line. That’s why we are doing something about it for New Jersey and our country.
Again, in this era of divided government, we hope Leader Pelosi will join us in taking these concrete steps for change to help break the gridlock and pass meaningful legislation to fix health care, immigration, and infrastructure.
Most Americans would look at these proposals and tell you they're just common sense, and expect Congress to already work that way. Unfortunately, years of partisanship and ideologically-motivated obstructionism have undercut our governing institutions.
3. Every Congress, each Member will be allowed to introduce one bill for debate and a vote on a committee on which he/she serves. The bill must be germane to that committee's jurisdiction and have at least one cosponsor from the other party.
2. When an amendment (a proposed change) to a bill has at least 20 Democratic and 20 Republican cosponsors, it will get a debate and a vote when that bill is considered on the floor.
1. When a bill receives 290 cosponsors (or three-fifths of Congress), it will go to the House floor for debate and a timely vote.
We are asking Leader Pelosi to publicly support the following ideas of the “Break the Gridlock” rules changes that we first proposed in June to help spur immediate action on health care, immigration, and infrastructure:
The bottom line is this: We need real rules reform to get bipartisan legislation heard — not just more committees to study the problem. Bipartisan legislation with broad support deserves honest debate and a simple up-or-down vote.
If we are going to get anything done and move New Jersey forward, we will have to work together. With health care, immigration, infrastructure, and jobs on the line, we simply can’t afford two more years of gridlock.
The reality is that we are now living in an era of divided government. Come January, Democrats will lead the House, but the Senate and White House will continue to be controlled by Republicans.
Our rules proposal isn't about changing leadership; it's about changing a system that stymies the will of the common sense majority.
For six months now, the Problem Solvers has focused on changing the House rules, so we can finally get action on infrastructure (fixing our roads, tunnels and bridges), health care (premiums down), and immigration reform (allowing DREAMERs to stay and keeping our borders secure).
As with anything, there’s plenty of misinformation, so I thought I’d clarify a few things.
I’ve heard from many of you about my fight to change some of the House rules to get bipartisan legislation accomplished. The outpouring of support for the Caucus' effort has been incredible. Thank you.
I’m proud to stand with Republican mayors like Deirdre Dillon of Ramsey and Congressman @BillPascrell to launch the bipartisan fight to reinstate the State and Local Tax Deduction in the new 116th Congress.
On Election Day, the people spoke loud and clear: we need to cut taxes, not raise them. States like New Jersey that got stuck paying the bill for the Tax Hike Bill last year declared they are sick and tired of paying the bill for the Moocher States. https://t.co/yXnpEfFEk8

It’s basically a 7% tax increase on residents across the Fifth District. 	That’s why I’m making it a top priority in the new Congress to fight to get a full reinstatement of the SALT deduction so we can eliminate the double taxation devastating our NJ families &amp; small businesses.
When last year’s Tax Hike Bill gutted the State and Local Tax Deduction, it sharply limited NJ’s property tax deductions, eliminated interest deductions for home equity lines, and imposed a massive Tax Hike on Jersey families and businesses. https://t.co/oZpY5gzRUa

That’s why we’ve “wasted no time” in calling for a full reinstatement of the deduction in the new Congress. It is time to start cutting taxes for North Jersey. https://t.co/3QtzE7fd9X

These resources will provide more training for first responders, hiring more drug counselors, and improving coordination efforts with local educators and health care providers.
I'm at the Mahwah Police Department this morning to announce the town clawed back nearly $300,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice, one of only two grants given in New Jersey, to help fight this epidemic head on.
The opioid crisis in this country is devastating our families, neighbors, and communities with more than 40,000 deaths per year. We know that New Jersey is not immune and we need to do more. https://t.co/K3NzlWhPxR
They're essential to providing information and assistance to our small businesses to help them grow and thrive in New Jersey.
Glad to see so many great organizations from the Fifth District, including the Bergen County Division of Economic Development, the New Jersey branch of @SBAgov, @njchamber, and the New Jersey Main Street Alliance.
Last week, #TeamGottheimer attended the Small Business Forum and Luncheon sponsored by the @NJCitizenAction Education Fund and Wells Fargo. https://t.co/EMzFM6cnm0
Proud to be a recipient of the 2018 Medicare Advantage Champion award from @protectmyMA! I will keep fighting to protect Medicare Advantage for the millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities who depend on it. https://t.co/iqNXdAL9OU
Our ability to get up and lift each other up in even the hardest of times is what makes us the greatest country in the world and what cements my belief that our best days will always be ahead of us.
As it’s said in Proverbs, “A righteous man falls down seven times and gets up.” We must get back up and come together as a country.  That’s what we’ve always done in the face of tragedy.
The victims were targeted simply because of their faith, as they were fulfilling the sacred commandment to “remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Senseless acts of hate and terror like this have no place in our country and never will. https://t.co/l5yoF0ibUe
Today, we are all grieving for our brothers and sisters lost who were gunned down by a man consumed by anti-Semitism and hateful conspiracies. https://t.co/R6FPFkMwTE
Thank you to CEO and President Joanne Mandry and @CAFSNJ for your service in our communities.
Last week, #TeamGottheimer joined the annual celebration for @CAFSNJ–which helps communities across NJ with child care &amp; early education, drug &amp; alcohol abuse education &amp; prevention, in-home assistance services, &amp; much more to help support for our seniors, families and children. https://t.co/MFmNcgcIMp
Thanks to the help of Sergeant Verheeck and Trooper Kraljevich in Wantage last week, one of North Jersey's newest faces – Hendrix – was delivered safely with the help of Wantage EMS. Your quick action has the thanks and gratitude of all New Jersey. https://t.co/0PHjjyJbdK
My heart is broken hearing the news out of Pittsburgh, PA. God bless the members of Tree of Life and the courageous first responders who responded to the scene. Senseless acts of hate and violence have no place in our country and never will.
We can’t afford to raise taxes on anyone in New Jersey. These funds are key to my Tax Cut Plan, which delivers real tax relief from the Tax Hike Bill and protects property values for North Jersey taxpayers and homeowners. https://t.co/gG5sVFFNzp
New Jersey is fighting back against government bureaucrats at the IRS and Treasury who are trying to block New Jersey towns from lowering taxes for their residents through charitable deduction funds. https://t.co/vzfP9uyyUd

Thank you to everyone who came out to the Bergen County NAACP Freedom Fund Awards last weekend. Congratulations to all of the honorees, and thank you for helping to reaffirm North Jersey's commitment to ensuring equal rights and ending racial discrimination. https://t.co/cKAGFSOxwi
Please join me tomorrow for a Veterans' Claims Clinic in Rochelle Park. We'll have experts from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help with all your V.A. benefits, including compensations, pensions, employment, and more. https://t.co/3vTIMz9JMO
We are fighting back against the IRS and government bureaucrats trying to block New Jersey towns from lowering taxes for their residents through charitable deduction funds, which are already used in 33 states. We need actual tax cuts in New Jersey. https://t.co/q85jVQQVni
Last year's Tax Hike Bill took a two-by-four to New Jersey taxpayers, and the IRS’ attempt to raise taxes even more on New Jersey families exposes their cynical goal to continue delivering on their own political ends — sticking it to the Northeast. 	https://t.co/k6wFT5T0ki
Preserving clean water for North Jersey's families, children, and seniors is one of my top priorities in Congress. ICYMI: EPA finalizes $19.5 million plan to expand cleanup of Fair Lawn water. https://t.co/pQ0sUeDJNs https://t.co/ci0PUdRYPD
Congratulations to all of the honorees, including Captain Bill Sheehan, Norm Guerra, Sam Pesin, and Samsung Electronics.
#TeamGottheimer attended the Hackensack Riverkeeper Clean Water Gala to help honor the community leaders who are committed to preserving, protecting, and restoring clean water for all North Jersey. https://t.co/4rpQAit8zx
Across North Jersey, we have strong and diverse communities filled with people of many different backgrounds, belief, and religions.
Thank you to all of the religious &amp; spiritual faith leaders who joined me in Paramus to discuss the issues facing our communities and how to come together in a time when so many focus on what divides us rather than what unites us. https://t.co/rpSjssFVxP
Kay has dedicated her time to providing scholarships to low income students through the Summer Campership fund, and North Jersey couldn't be prouder to have her working to help our students learn and grow. https://t.co/wvaZe4N9Mj
#TeamGottheimer joined Freeholders Amoroso &amp; Ortiz to honor Kay Gellert at Bergen Volunteer Center's "Celebration of Summers in a Lifetime." https://t.co/RTwdp759RU
Yes, the IRS wants to raise taxes even more on N.J. families. Other states are also worried about their programs and I wrote to the IRS to demand they cut the red tape, so New Jersey residents can get lower taxes.
It’s time for tax cuts for Jersey. But even though these funds already exist in 33 states, and have for years, the political bureaucrats at the IRS and Treasury are proposing a new regulation that would eliminate this tax cut for families.
Last year's Tax Hike Bill gutted critical tax relief for NJ and made us America’s piggy bank. That's why I stood with North Jersey mayors this spring to announce my Tax Cut Plan, working with towns to help set up charitable tax funds to offset the gutting of the SALT deduction.
I'm in Ridgewood this morning to talk about fighting the IRS gridlock, so we can actually cut taxes in New Jersey. https://t.co/hjxzBMEfMl
Franchises like @Applebees are hallmarks of entrepreneurship and the American Dream, with so many getting their first job or their start as a small business owner.
Last week, I joined the team &amp; served the customers at the @Applebees in Paramus as a part of my #JoshOnTheJob tour. Thank you to @DohertyInc for hosting me, &amp; for all you do investing in NJ jobs–with dozens of franchises across NJ, part of the nearly 171k NJ franchise employees. https://t.co/P4pyTYJ6Pf
Independent testing shows the water coming off of the Waste Mountain has unsafe levels of lead. I've called again on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to further investigate this potentially contaminated Waste Mountain.
When I visited Vernon last week, I saw with my own eyes evidence of solid waste that is threatening the lakes, clean water, and public health of the Vernon community. https://t.co/NWo3ouiFVe

Last week, #TeamGottheimer joined the members of the Lodi Council in celebrating the 2018 New Jersey Little League Softball state champions – Fifth District's own Lodi-Wallington girls softball team. Way to go! You make North Jersey proud! https://t.co/j8KtuEmpJc
I saw with my own eyes the signs of solid waste, and independent testing confirms that the water coming off of the pile is unsafe levels of lead.

Congratulations to the Newton Volunteer First Aid and Rescue Squad on your selection as the 2018 New Jersey Outstanding EMS Agency at the 2018 National Conference on EMS in Atlantic City! 	https://t.co/fywcsvzsLn
I've called on all schools to make sure that every student gets the breakfast necessary for them to succeed, and on school districts to fully utilizes the federal resources available through the School Breakfast Program, so our children aren’t hungry at school. https://t.co/rxBUntrylg
The data couldn't be clearer: students who don't eat breakfast have a harder time focusing, make more errors, &amp; are more likely to be absent, tardy, &amp; to repeat a grade. Our children are rockets ready to take off to a successful career, but you can't propel a rocket without fuel. https://t.co/LbUjAyAgV4
Interested in applying to a service academy? Join us for our info session on 10/25 at Ridgewood High School at 5:30pm to learn about the service academies &amp; the application process.

The threat of this potentially contaminated waste being dumped next to Vernon's neighborhoods and reservoirs is a threat we cannot ignore. At the site, I have seen with my own eyes evidence of solid waste. https://t.co/Ebocb5vY3S
Thank you to our hosts the New Milford Fire Department, which was awarded $750,000 for a new fire truck from the grant this year.
Getting better return on investment for money we already send to Washington is key to getting money back from “Moocher States,” &amp; grants like AFG give our firefighters &amp; EMS essential equipment &amp; vehicles to help them protect our families &amp; neighbors from crime, fires, &amp; terror.
I joined fire houses from across North Jersey to raise awareness for FEMA's Assistance to Firefighter Grants, which last year helped claw back $1.7 million in our federal tax dollars to help better equip and train our local first responders. https://t.co/6XlJeNos1u
With $19.5 million provided through the EPA, Fair Lawn can now hold the reckless polluters who created this site accountable and a cleaner and more prosperous future – creating jobs, raising property values, and lowering health care costs for all.

But when owner Jeanette Iurato applied for non-profit status with the IRS, she didn't hear back for 11 months.

New Jersey needs real tax cuts, not tax hikes that only help states which already get millions more back from the federal government than they send.
The devastation of the State and Local Tax Deduction sticks it to New Jersey families and businesses, and the Moocher States only want to double down on their raiding of our federal tax dollars.	https://t.co/zEWMPq9spC

I visited the BMW North American HQ in Woodcliff Lake on my #MadeInTheFifth Tour.

The IRS leaves no doubt: making the SALT cap permanent significantly jacks up taxes on NJ families. Our state needs lower taxes to attract more businesses &amp; make living here more affordable for working families, not more of the worst parts of Tax Hike Bill https://t.co/x7YHBPpLYD
Folks in greater Vernon area deserve more options on the road. That's why I've worked w/ Coach USA to bring a new bus route that runs from Vernon Valley Plaza to Manhattan for a 60 day pilot. For it to become a permanent option, we need to spread the word! https://t.co/Dukcos5TOF

I spent hours looking through old pictures yesterday, and every one has her grinning from ear to ear. I love this picture of her.
I always saw my achievements as mom’s wins, too — and I think that’s how she viewed them.  I think it’s fair to say that I would be nothing and nowhere without her.
She was the fun, generous mom and aunt, and the grandmother who never said no to her grandkids.
She literally lived for her magnificent grandchildren, the loves of her life, insisting to me that she loved them more than I did, and, thankfully, she lived long enough to develop real relationships and make memories with my children.
She loved being a school teacher, but she saw her number one job as teaching and raising me and my sister Emily.
To me, Gwenn Kuskin Feldman was always larger than life. She was beautiful and graceful, with a smile that would light up any room and a laugh that could be heard for miles.  She loved to tell stories, often the same ones over and over – they’re legendary.
I can’t thank everyone enough for the outpouring of love and support these last days. My mom was one of a kind and I will miss her every day. https://t.co/Fo8cOdGxei

We've got to be tough on China, but we have to be smart and targeted in the way we levy tariffs. I will keep fighting for lower taxes for all North Jersey families and stand up against those who try to stick it to New Jersey.
New Jersey families cannot afford another Tax Hike like the one being pushed in Washington, which would permanently gut the State and Local Tax deduction. And our trade policies cannot work against New Jersey businesses and their growth. https://t.co/dJQj7dgko7

Treasury’s arbitrary fiat will encourage more people and businesses to flee New Jersey and leave every other resident of our state holding the bag.
What we cannot stand for, however, is this arbitrary and capricious and procedurally deficient turnabout in tax policy – deviating from the specific language and intent of still fresh tax legislation to serve its cynical political ends.
It’s clear that the IRS agrees with us that it cannot distinguish longstanding tax credit programs from the newer state tax charitable deduction programs.
Without any congressional authorization whatsoever, the US Treasury Department just jacked up taxes today on millions of Americans.  We will fight these shameless rules and will continue to fight for lower taxes for New Jersey families.

Incredibly sad news today. The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin taught us so much about how, as individuals, to live with grace and how, as a community, to treat one another. She will be missed.
THANK YOU to Sussex County Fairgrounds manager Gary Larson and everyone who made this year's New Jersey State Fair possible! The Fair is critical to our community and local economy, and hands-down one of my favorite New Jersey traditions. Looking forward to next year's! https://t.co/KITc0mdvtQ

On 9/11, terrorists counted on being able to rush and breach the cockpit knowing that the doors would be opened early in the flight. And they did. And today, the flight deck remains vulnerable when that cockpit has to open. https://t.co/FLf99QywOX

As LBJ said in 1965, "To apply any other test, to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race or his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice. It is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom." #VRA53 https://t.co/qUlIC4QTDs

Common-sense, bipartisan projects like Gateway and healthcare reform have been sidelined too many times by a system that empowers those looking to obstruct rather than find real solutions.

Our #BreakTheGridlock reforms are critical for North Jersey residents, whose needs are often sidelined by party extremists playing political games. These reforms will help us move forward on critical issues like the Gateway Project and health care reform. https://t.co/HxZZThPhQ3
In Congress, I will always fight to ensure New Jersey seniors, families, and people with disabilities have access to affordable, quality healthcare.
Today, 1.3 million New Jersey seniors rely on Medicare for their healthcare, 60% of Medicaid expenditures go to long-term care for the elderly, blind, and disabled, and 3 out of 5 nursing home residents in New Jersey are covered by Medicaid.
Fifty-three years ago today, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. https://t.co/MO5wKqUd2I

Miranda’s Law will save lives and save dollars. And there’s nothing partisan about it.
Through their pilot program, the federal Department of Transportation found that by reducing convictions, injuries, and fatalities, these alerts would pay back at 15:1 and pay for setting it up in less than a year.
When a driver’s home state motor vehicle administration receives notice of a triggering infraction, it is sent electronically into a national database. From there, within 24 hours, an alert goes out a school or school bus company.

I will always fight for Social Security because North Jersey seniors deserve stability and respect after a lifetime of hard work.
In May, I introduced my Seniors’ Security Strategy, which prevents attempts to snatch benefits from seniors to pay debts, ends the double taxation of Social Security income, and defends seniors from new Social Security and Medicare scams. You can read more about my plan below.
I voted against partisan proposals to end Medicare as we know it, lower the cost-of-living adjustment and reduce Social Security benefits, and I voted yes on the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act to improve oversight &amp; protections for SS recipients.
In Congress, I have worked for the Fifth District by fighting to strengthen Social Security and help New Jersey seniors, and I will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare. I am committed to protecting these vital programs for New Jersey. https://t.co/e5E2J4dR1L

#TeamGottheimer attended the Sussex Rural Electric Cooperative’s 81st Annual Membership Meeting, held at High Point Regional High School in Wantage. @SussexREC is the only Rural Electric Cooperative in NJ, and has been powering our community for more than 80 years. https://t.co/y3FYiWD7iy
This past Tuesday, I wrote to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the NJ Motor Vehicle Commission, &amp; the NJ Dept of Education asking them take immediate action to ensure all bus drivers are qualified &amp; experience the proper background checks to drive our children.
These three-point belts provide critical protection in the case of rollover crashes like this week's.
Last week, I introduced the bipartisan SECURES Act, which requires all school buses to have three-point lap-and-shoulder seat belts and encourages innovative measures to ensure students are actually wearing their seat belts.
We are all thinking about the families of all those injured in yesterday’s crash.
As a father and congressman, in the wake of the Paramus tragedy, I was troubled to see, yet again, another overturned school bus — this time on the N.J. Turnpike. These accidents highlight what we already know to be true: we must do more to protect our kids on school buses. https://t.co/JVGpgwmSaK

America is the greatest country in the world, and together we can stop this senseless cycle of gun violence.
But that isn’t enough. We must continue walking out and speaking up for common-sense gun violence prevention measures such as outlawing bump stocks, because now, more than ever, we must keep on fighting to keep our schools, children, and families safe.
Together, we supported specific, common-sense legislation to enhance school safety, improve background checks, and fund mental illness research, all of which were passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed into law.
I’m proud that, earlier this year, the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus came together to overcome the traditional partisan divide on this issue.
To honor #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, #TeamGottheimer wore orange and attended events at Upper Saddle River's Liberty Park and Ridgewood's Van Neste Square. https://t.co/ekHAP0WXHA

The risks of inaction are too high.
Iran must know that its destructive behavior throughout the Middle East will not be tolerated, and we must now work to ensure that the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism is never able to threaten the United States or our allies armed with a nuclear weapon.
There should be nothing partisan about our national security, nor our relationship with our ally Israel.
With the decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, we must now move beyond partisan gridlock and implement a comprehensive plan to better restrain Iran's malevolence and nuclear ambitions.
Beginning in October, the President declined to certify that the sanctions relief under the JCPOA is 'appropriate and proportionate' to the measures Iran has taken to terminate its illicit nuclear program.
But even if Iran were to fulfill all its obligations, the sunsets in the JCPOA would still permit Iran to resume its nuclear program within years.
Iran has violated international law by testing long-range ballistic missiles and transferring weapons to terrorist groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas, and Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.
Since the deal’s implementation, Iran has reaped the benefits of sanctions relief, twice skirted the agreement’s limitations on heavy water, and continued to flaunt its refusal to allow international inspectors access to military sites under the JCPOA’s weak inspections regime.
It also failed to address Iran's aggressive development of long-range ballistic missiles to deliver these nuclear weapons. These facts remain true today.
I opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, because while it may have placed temporary limits on certain aspects of Iran’s nuclear program, it did not permanently preclude Tehran’s pathway to the bomb.

I will continue to work with local, state, federal officials, and our heroic first responders to get Sussex and Warren Counties the help that they need.
We need to clear the downed power lines and get roadways open, so residents are safe ahead of the looming snowstorm. I commend the emergency responders and everyone on the front lines who are doing all that they can to help keep New Jersey families safe.
Based on what I am hearing from mayors, other state and local elected officials, emergency responders, and residents, I believe this step is necessary to keep North Jersey families safe.
We have snow on the way, below-freezing temperatures, and thousands still without power, heat, and running water.
In light of the impending storm, I’ve asked the Governor to declare a state emergency to address the impact and damage from Friday’s nor’easter and to get ahead of Wednesday’s looming storm.

Thank you to the many residents and businesses that have gone the extra mile to care for your neighbors and for being extra careful with the live wires.
I’ve also spoken the power companies to press then for clear timelines and answers. I will keep working with your excellent mayors in pushing them until every last light is on and every last tree is cleared.
I’ve been working closely with everyone from mayors and DPWs to our state representatives and the Governor to make sure that recovery efforts are as speedy as possible. Our phenomenal first responders have gone the extra mile, as always.
No one in Northwest Jersey has been spared by this brutal storm. Many estimates expect some residents in Sussex &amp; Warren to go two more days without power. I share the deep frustration many have expressed in the turn-around, especially as we face another storm arriving Wednesday.

It’s also why I’ll keep working around-the-clock to fight this Tax Hike Bill to the end.
I would love to bring actual tax cuts to the overtaxed people of New   Jersey's Fifth District. That is why my Gottheimer-Lance Tax Cut Plan would preserve the State and Local Tax Deduction in its entirety, cut our deficit, and keep taxes down for businesses of all sizes.
Their version of "fixing" this problem involves more benefits for Moocher states, paid for, once again, on the backs of Jersey families. Put another way, we’ve just been robbed by a bunch of Moocher States.
The Conference Committee’s proposed SALT "fix" to the Tax Hike Bill is insulting to our intelligence, demeaning to our hard-working families and small businesses, disastrous to our property values, and condemns our state to another recession.
It's a dark day for New Jersey families and businesses. https://t.co/DBW78aXM7E

We must use every tool in our arsenal to fight back, Jersey style, and stand up to the these greedy Moocher States that are shamelessly pillaging our state and future for their gain.
I want actual tax cuts for New Jersey, and I’ve been working across the aisle to get tax cuts. But this Tax Hike Bill represents yet another huge giveaway to Moocher States like Mississippi and Alabama — at the cost of a huge tax hike on our backs.
It’s another nail in New Jersey’s coffin.
It eliminates our ability to deduct state and local income taxes, brings back the AMT, and nearly eliminates our ability to deduct our property taxes and mortgage interest.   It will send jobs, people and businesses fleeing from our state and send housing prices plummeting.
That’s why everyone--from the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce to law enforcement to nearly every member of the Congressional delegation, Democrat and Republican alike--voted against the Tax Hike Bill.
This Tax Hike Bill is unmitigated assault and tax hike on New Jersey families and businesses. And, what’s worse, by eliminating the deductions we rely on, it’s a broken promise to every resident and business in our state.
