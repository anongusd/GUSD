3) this movie was robbed of an academy award. 4) teen movies stand the test of time. 5) @sydneyplace needs to move back to Mpls.
Main takeaways: 1) @adriangrenier should always play a Chase 2) @MelissaJoanHart is cool in every era
Cue the music!!!! I'm should've seen by the look in your eyes ba-ay-by, there was somethin missin.... #drivemecrazy
Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed. #misstimezone #drivemecrazy
Unveil Chase!!!! #drivemecrazy #fullofsurprises
Ray is the only loser in this movie. I'm sure there's something behind it. Like maybe he becomes batman. #appreciatetheart #drivemecrazy
Fun house mirrors proving to be a great identity analogy for Chase and Designated Dan to work it out. #appreciatetheart #drivemecrazy

Ideally all of the above.  https://t.co/MqiAptfTGz
"Don't you see? I've entered into their world." - Chase aka @adriangrenier in #drivemecrazy. #highschoolcliquefeuds
@GoodOnNetflix, it would be hard to find a film I like more than #drivemecrazy, but I'm open to suggestions....
Dance team costumes are ts rather than full costume. Low budget film or staying true to the setting? #appreciatetheart #drivemecrazy

In my mind I had romantic convos with my high school neighbor through our windows. In my mind it was @MelissaJoanHart  #drivemecrazy
@sydneyplace sorry, world. But if you haven't seen this classic film yet it's your bad. #drivemecrazy
Could there ever be a truer romance than that between Designated Dave and Dee Vine? #sacredlove #drivemecrazy
