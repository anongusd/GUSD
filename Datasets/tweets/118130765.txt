@kylegrantham my favorite pet theory is we end up with something like Medicare Advantage For All ‚Äî¬†aggressively regulated and subsidized universal private coverage
@kylegrantham the benefits for the govt plan under Sanders bill are more robust than even the Canadian system (includes prescription drugs, for instance) with virtually no out-of-pocket costs		but yeah, I think this is one of big divergences between the Sanders bill and its alternatives
@kylegrantham I was surprised Harris was so forceful ‚Äî but she endorsed the Sanders bill, which functionally if not statutorily ends private coverage, so it's at least consistent		some of the alternative M4A-like plans do keep private coverage, so I don't think this is a settled issue
I may be overthinking the semantics, but just for clarity's sake
ack, correx, Harris's tax plan is, technically, a major expansion of tax credits, not strictly a tax cut (though the same issue folks are raising about doing that and then a M4A plan that requires some tax hikes might still apply)

@bhbradlow I don't think it's one or the other exactly		but we agree Ds would do well to spend some time now preparing for the bad faith arguments and also, I think, fine-tuning an affirmative case for the regular people who might still feel some anxiety about big changes
@bhbradlow I think there is plenty of evidence that Americans get nervous about massive changes to the health care system -- again, the entire history of health care reform		but agree to disagree
@bhbradlow I'm just checking -- do you think I'm arguing the latter?		because I'm not and the piece doesn't
@bhbradlow agreed, a dynamic touched on in the piece!		this is not an anti-M4A article
@bhbradlow maybe that will prove to be true, I still think there is plenty of reason (beyond the media's conventional wisdom) to at least take these concerns seriously and prepare a counterargument
@RickT26388 I don't think we should treat this as simple, but I would just note that the piece does discuss the possibility that employers themselves might end up deciding they are better off under M4A, because costs to them are increasing
@bhbradlow and, again, polling showing broad satisfaction with ESI and the entire history of trying to pass health care reform indicates disruption is a serious liability for reformers		I think M4A supporters can win the argument, but also think they need to be prepared to make an argument
@bhbradlow this guy has private insurance, supplied through his employer (federal workers select plans on an exchange), so i think he is a perfectly fine proxy -- the opening anecdote is also a public worker, demonstrating the *problems* with ESI
@bhbradlow I would also highlight the KFF polling showing 80% of people with ESI said they thought it was good or excellent		this is not a manufactured point of view		but the piece is not even an argument that this is an unwinnable argument for M4A supporters -- it is in fact the opposite
@bhbradlow I'm trying to be civil but implying that I misunderstood or mischaracterized what I heard at six hours of focus groups across two days in two different states is really not cool
@CoachTA13 extremely same -- every team is bound to have a slump over 17 weeks, better now than later		and I implicitly trust McVay with two weeks to plan

@mujakigenki @GovHowardDean ha, yes, maybe single payer should have been in quotes
I think it can be simultaneously true that the problems with job-based insurance have become hard to ignore, creating opening for Medicare for all...		... and that ESI is deeply entrenched and Americans generally don't like disruption in their health care		https://t.co/QEUHstqJZ6
@mujakigenki @GovHowardDean yeah, one of my next projects is "single payer can actually mean a lot of different things, as explained by international systems"		so this is great fodder for that
@RStasch @GovHowardDean "Medicare" under the M4A plans does pretty much cover everything (which is a strength for its supporters)		there are allowances for supplemental coverage -- I would think that might ameliorate some, but not all, of the fears about disruption
@mujakigenki @GovHowardDean that's an interesting option!
