@AndrewSolender well i heard last week that the other two books will be the same story told from different POVs.
@PopulismUpdates Alternatively: Andrew Cuomo, Really, No!
@IAmKrishanPatel @PNWwonk We spent 8 years watching Obama truly believe if he could just bring the R Senators to the table to pass good policy. Meanwhile, the leading R in the Senate literally said his job was to make Obama a one-term President. Hard pass on doing it again.
@usawtfmJ1 Is the Army finally cancelled?
@XOofXOs it's hilarious - did you read the post about the scuttlebutt what the E-ring Army guys want and what they are saying?
@soonergrunt Dennis Leary!
Alright, who’s already DA select? Let’s get your promotion packet put together so you can get promoted on your way to face existential evil. https://t.co/jNA1y5iFLs
Oh cool, the Dem Gov of the second largest blue state shitting all over labor unions, a traditional base of power of his party. https://t.co/K4I8Ds9wua
@s1pog Yeahs it’s frustrating how hit or miss it is.  It’s happens in the Guard too.  I’ve get really reliable BN S1s and some not so reliable ones.
@s1pog Bn E7s are back? At last. That really hurt the ARNG states like mine with full BCTs.
@merii3 @Ms_Riley_Guprz Things you won’t find in the USMA yearbook profile of any African American cadet
@S1Your @BlondsOvrBaghd It’s fun because good S1s know how to find out everyone’s profile. And given that there are rarer profiles as well you have to know them if you are the delegate for the senior eater.
@BlondsOvrBaghd @S1Your Officer is best suited for assignments not involving interactions with subordinates.
@IAmKrishanPatel Given his dad was arrested at KKK rally (or adjacent to one), agreeing is not hard.
@pooleejones Be interested to see if this was funded by the wine or distilled spirits lobbying group or both?
@pooleejones Denis Leary has a funny rant on this when a study said the same thing about cigarettes. “What minutes am I losing? The ones where I’m shitting in a diaper and drooling on myself.” Then lights another cigarette.
@kenklippenstein This is what happens when you have to make content to be relevant. You say a lot of dumb shit.
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa I think Becerra is in play. What are thoughts any of the new OC Dems? Hill/Porter? In NY, I will be interested to see what happens ‘22 with Schumer and Cuomo because Hochul (current LG) would take either. Is there a city based Dem who would beat her? Jumaane W. just lost to her.
@AndrewSolender Why is the Tropicana Hotel in here connected to other gun massacres?
@AirPowerUnicorn Fact check: this is true. Only except the ending is much more mundane than having beaten an alien race.
@GodinezAd @XOofXOs @PatDonahoeArmy This is completely me. I have many aspirational piles of books I hope to get to.
@s1pog And at least half are generating force assignments at Sill, Benning, or Knox.
@agingerssoul 100% concur on this - I've got half a dozen friends like this scattered throughout the Army.
@Ms_Riley_Guprz somehow my excel changed to R1C1 once for no reason I could figure out - it was horrifying.
@FAO_Joel In almost 17 years, I have never ever held any assignment for 3 years, the longest was 28 months as a BCT S1. Two separate company commands for 2 years (DIV HHC and Recruiting Co)
@WTF_Judge Why? I’ve seen a dozen people do dumb shit like this in the military and it’s never not funny.
@pblest I’d add that in addition that in that same timeframe you never face any consequences for the dumb shit you do.
@jaredlholt just fucking kill me - that man has lived in NYC for how long and the craziest thing is him giving up his seat? I've been on the NYC subways may be a dozen times and have had at least one crazy thing happen each time I'm there.  Tapper sucks.
Hey remember like six months ago when it was revealed that AMI was attempting to blackmail Jeff Bezos.
@esnjay Sam, this is probably the MLCOA that these clowns are pursuing. The legal path to separation is hard and intensive, but if they just get you to give up and request resignation, it saves time. I see it all the time when we do officer separations and JAG is involved.
@IAmKrishanPatel or how they were regulars a CPK...
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa part of the Bundy Ranch crew
@IAmKrishanPatel lol, that was me 13-14 years ago with the jamaican jerk chicken pizza.
@joncprevo TBH, John Stennis from MS was pretty bad too and get an entire class of Navy ships named after him.
@Cattileesi if I was younger and more tech savvy I would have posted a gif of Derek Hough slow clapping a performance on World of Dance.
@Cattileesi slow clap
@daveanthony How dare those fucking kids, checks notes, apply political pressure to achieve a their goals?
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @politicsluo @JMilesColeman @cinyc9 @derekwillis @joncprevo https://t.co/0aTcaWNdWn
@SenhorRaposa Hard pass here - let's couch this in our terms. Dems sit out the Prez race in '20, refuse to participate because of Trump's criminality and illegitimacy. Trump wins, but Dems maintain House majority. Then Pelosi proclaims herself POTUS and gets UK, et al to recognize her as Prez.
@speechboy71 If only the entire media ecosphere hadn't spent all their capital on shunning/berating her for an utterly meaningless comment.
@daveanthony Dave, would Far Side even by funny now? It's too on the nose now. He would have to go to absurd lengths to out do what's going on. It's like the Onion, half their articles are basically true at this point.
@merii3 congratulations you have graduated to Staff Officer Jedi
@ChazNuttycombe i think he's waiting to go after Biden to overwhelm the cycle and provide a contrast to the old due running.
@inthesedeserts Man fuck all of this shit right here.
@SenhorRaposa In a sane world he is a serious threat to Hillary in 2020.
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev And they have to factor in being available for their M-day job, especially in a KD assignment. When they get 2 weeks of mil leave (if they are lucky), then have to shoehorn in other 2 week periods for resident phases. And that’s if their not in a mobilizing unit with 21 AT days.
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev And there’s never any discussion of like responsibility skills sets. Typically, people rising in the ranks have acquired a similar level of responsibility in their civilian jobs. They fave a decision in where to place their already limited time (job, MILED, family).
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev RC pax never, ever are and have to figure out how to do it while shoehorning it in their civilian jobs and lives with basically zero reimbursement. And they have to do it in the timeline of their Promotion boards.
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev I think we ALWAYS forget to factor in the RC in our decision making process. Especially with DL ILE or SSC. AC guys mostly get to attend as their sole and only job. Even the AC pax that attend in a DL format are still functionally being paid to do it.
@ryanlcooper Too many moderate voters looking for this pablum out there. Want a return to the Obama years believing they were quiet and uneventful only because they weren’t actually paying attention to what was going on.
@politicsluo Siri, show me a 30 second video on brainwashing.
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev I have a history of my states SSC attendees going back over a decade and not one has failed for academics. That’s upward of 90 attendees.
@Russ_Burgos @queenofthinair @FORSCOMLdrDev I run Selection process for our state. What is the intent of the GRE requirement? Creating a discriminator in the process? Are you paying for the tests?  Will ARNG education offices be funded to administer the tests? Does the GRE indicate a level of capability at SSC?
@_Dan_Ryan @ArmyDisneyDad Oh I agree with that. It wasn’t a dig on the concept, more a lament of my own state’s issues of not having enough officers to go to the school. I’m all for giving more non-std paths rewarded. We’re never short slots, we’re short people. Obviously being RC creates its own issues.
@ArmyDisneyDad @_Dan_Ryan What’s this? Hand-select? My state can barely get people to attend now. Half my states O5 board is guaranteed non select due to non completion of ILE.
@kenklippenstein @JordanUhl who needs money spent on things with actual, verifiable results? let's just back up the dump truck full of cash over that open bonfire.
@SolidVerbal forever and ever, amen.
@SolidVerbal given Kliff Kingsbury's immediate apparent knifing of Josh Rosen, did USC dodge a bullet by having him leave and prevent the drama he would have seemingly brought, both in a QB competition and constant questions about him replacing Helton or leaving for the NFL?
@inthesedeserts oh fuck, get this shit the hell out of here. Of course it's fucking grunt style, fucking fascists.
@SenhorRaposa @Ben_R_Sci I am glad Democrats are so intent on actually gaining power. It's kind of disgusting. If you are Democrat and actually want your policies enacted, you need to take the Senate to do it. These pols need to get on board.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo Not saying it's likely, but say it's like 2000 again and it comes down to Dade and Palm Beach and somehow the D pulls it out. DeSantis simply refuses based on voter fraud allegations, etc. Would this Supreme Court back Trump like the '00 one did GWB? That's the scenario
I mean DeSantis &amp; Kemp are absolutely at the top of the list.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo Given Michael Cohen's testimony that he doesn't believe there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses in '20, which GOV/SOS in a state is most likely to refuse to certify their state's results to prevent Trump from losing?
@BarstoolSC Oh cool, sounds exactly like old Kliff would have certainly helped the stability of USC with the way he is giving Rosen the heave-ho.
@daveanthony It's the fucking energy efficient light bulbs all over again.
@aes87 @daveanthony True, and it is trashy. And this is going to be why our civilization fails because we can't get our cross meat from fast food restaurants that's not even required to be 100% (remember the Taco Bell fiasco).
@daveanthony wait i thought they hated people who work at fast food restaurants (thus why they refuse to pay them higher wages). Why wouldn't they support something that closes all those restaurants?
@daveanthony @thedollop Wasn't the idea that White 'God-fearing' men were superior to all women and people of any other ethnicity?
@joncprevo @kkondik shouldn't any state where Trump is underwater/even polling wise be no better than a Lean R (I think KS, NE, MT, and MO all meet that). Also, Trump is also further underwater in MN, IA, WI, and MI than he is in VA.
@AlexHortonTX Alex, how much does it cost to train a marine to get to that point? Is $70K a good estimate? In that case it’s better to keep the experienced one than starting from scratch right?
@mattgaetz is a cowardly lickspittle.  Can’t even properly do Trump. Has to kowtow and lick boot polish to avoid consequences.  And all he wanted to be was mini-Trump. https://t.co/MvxIS3jWaf
@JustSchmeltzer @mattgaetz What a cowardly lickspittle.  Can’t even properly do Trump. Has to kowtow and lick boot polish to avoid consequences.  And all he wanted to be was mini-Trump.
@Readingisahobby @Cattileesi @VancityReynolds or @RyanReynolds? Need that clarification. There appears to be confusion about this on Twitter sometimes.
@IAmKrishanPatel @politicsluo Okay I’m misremembering that race, but you were right, she was the better candidate. Hope she sticks around for while too
@IAmKrishanPatel @politicsluo And he damned sure supported her though.
@IAmKrishanPatel @politicsluo Didn’t he only get like 5% or something?
@JordanUhl depressing that this will be viewed as fact by Gene's followers within 24 hours.
@ArmyStrang @PaulSzoldra this is correct PR pitch, Francis
@ArmyStrang @UweBollocks @pattymo this m'fer is absolutely going to run for president as a grievance campaign whatever happens to his stupid father.
@6ixNuck @daveanthony I don't think anything will happen, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't, given how precious a resource water is about to become. Any action taken by a country to cut off water to another should be considered an act of aggression/war and be subject to same rules as mil. invasion
@Cianaf i mean man, there were like other plays after the dee ford play. Are we forgetting the collective failure of the defense to do anything else to stop Brady after that play. Seems like that it was THOSE plays that mattered.
@dandrezner I mean, it's probably time for Pompeo to jump over to New Delhi and Karachi, like immediately, right?
@daveanthony Furthermore, shouldn't this kind of resource be considered an act of aggression and grounds of for some sort of collective international action against India. Also, surely this won't inflame tensions between two countries that already have historic levels of enmity.
@daveanthony oh cool, I'm sure what the world needs is another country with a major water, then food shortage that leads to massive migration flows as people attempt to survive. Haven't seen that happen recently at all.
@DrewVanDrese It's Gym Jordan - always love an enabler of sexual assault being allowed to feign indignation about anything. How he hasn't been hounded out of office is beyond me.
@s1pog And you are right, they essentially TDY because they had to file those trips on their travel voucher at the end of the mobilization.
@s1pog Well, functionally I believe the answer to this in general is if you get Family Separation Pay.  That's a deployment in my mind. Getting Hazardous Duty/Hostile Fire Pay is different. Also what type of orders you are on 12302 vs. 12301d, etc.
I am glad that @SenMcSallyAZ is OK with taking money away from blue state projects, especially when facilities across NY need asbestos abatement and have lead in the water. As long as the AZ based projects are good, Senator, good for you. Us in NY will enjoy our asbestos and lead https://t.co/32nxtqf8WL
@politicsluo Isn't this how everyone's day everyday really could shake out?
@ArmyStrang was this the old Kiel Auditorium or some place else? was at the history museum last week and they had pics of how beautiful the place was and wish it could have been refurbished.
@s1pog Honest question: during my unit's last mob, we had a couple of units/teams deploy to Kuwait, but had missions in AFG, Jordan, Iraq, and other areas (this was post-2011 Iraq drawdown) - are they deployed only at the times in the other countries?
@MattGertz @dandrezner I’ve been hoping for tweet this all day.
@IAmKrishanPatel Nothing against this Daley personally (don’t know his story) but decades of Chicagoans triangulated and powered over in the first Daley’s reign must be happy.
@usawtfmJ1 @CJ_usawtfm @SGMtheMan1 @WTFIOGuy Count me in on that Morgan.  I have some really shitty stories from this weekend of officers who were getting the run around on getting their awards and MILED docs in Iperms. Angered me a lot.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa What's up for grabs in 2020? Any other Assembly, St. Senate or CDs that could flip?
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa although they dodged a bullet with Travis Allen.
@ryangrim so bascially she has not clue about how social media and virality works? Fucking wonderful. Was she ever briefed on how the Arab Spring grew so quickly? Or the Green Movement in Iran?
@politico_chris @msdemocrats @HoodForGovernor looking forward to it. How do you identify party in MS given that the races are "non-party affiliated?
@KeraRolsen So gross. Love that the response of men like this is always to dig in and not do any self-reflection, directly in contradiction to EVERYTHING military professional development teaches us to do as good leaders. It's almost like we aren't adequately measuring outcomes in NC/OPDs.
@DemocraticLuntz @IAmKrishanPatel he really is going to be Billy Madison pulling up to high school in his Trans Am and REO Speedwagon shirt.
@MikeObach @leptopterygius He took his liberal/left-cred from getting fired from ABC. That confused everyone who believed he might actually speak more truth to power. Instead he makes shitty jokes and platforms Nazis and other crazy people.
@robrousseau @CNN Didn't CNN already do something like this for Women who support Trump or something?
@robrousseau @MDNOShaughnessy my god, regime change with no plan, that sounds, well, actually, it sounds exactly like the same thing we always do.
@FPWellman @armyguyJustin It's ridiculous. People who drink stouts are used to all sort of chocolate, vanilla, and dark fruit flavors. Then if you like sour/wild ales, you're getting into all the citrus fruit. FFS, Budweiser made micheladas and put lime in their beer and no one said shit.
@FPWellman Someone with an unsubstantiated sex no no just got nominated. Unsubstantiated but with plenty of evidence. Or someone in Fat Leonard fallout radius.
@barefootboomer @JoePlenzler @USMC @USArmy Monday Motivation - that is everyday motivation for us AG types! I adore ORB updates.
@daveanthony Weren't their kids at the State of the Union - like the one who was bullied because of his name that then fell asleep hardcore in the upper balcony?
@kenklippenstein @robrousseau Ken, don't give Winger Reddit an idea to prove how humans aren't mammals and immune to climate change.
@daveanthony your pod on the Confederate flag at SF cit hall really made me hate her even more than my own personal interactions with her office had previously.
@daveanthony I've been wondering when this was going to happen. He certainly did let the Tories really show how bad at governing they really are when they are beholden to a crazy Right-Wing fringe who believe everything they see on whatever the Reddit or in one of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers.
@vagrunt I got PTSD reading this frightening, dystopian excerpt.
@ParrottDoctor @sgtjanedoe Well, I mean, the guy could block magic spells from the most powerful wizard of his age, I'm pretty sure a bullet isn't really an option. Also he could read people's minds, especially Harry's, so it eliminate the surprise.
@sgtjanedoe @ParrottDoctor I never understood the admissions policy, do all British kids get an invite? What if they want to attend another country's school? I also felt a plot hole was how non-magical parents can keep the secret? Like, never once, did someone like non-wizard parents get drunk at a pub?
@JustSchmeltzer USAA
@robrousseau @disco_socialist My God, this is extremely depressing.
@robrousseau @JohnCornyn this fucking asshole quotes Mussolini favorably and then thinks we're the morons. Just kill me already.
@s1pog I like to stare at myself in the mirror too. :)
@RepMiaNoLove @JustinGunderman Worst senator contest between Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley...
@vagrunt by all means, let's subscribe to parenting where kids end up permanently psychologically damaged from fear of failing their parent's expectations. Forcing life-long psychiatric care to own the libs.
@disco_socialist I would argue you could draw a map like that between you and me given the sheer number of people pictured.
@jakebackpack It’s just depressing. I keep reminding people that how you treat the people you have power over is a direct reflection of your character. Her actions show a lack of empathy and respect. If that’s how she treats people she knows, how would she treat those she doesn’t?
@kenklippenstein This shit has to be illegal, we have a Senator openly agitating for war on Twitter. Threatening people and god I just fucking give up. Amazing this is where Marco wants to get into a dick measuring contest, but he would totally roll up his tiny weeny and go home if Trump said so.
@puckthepilot @S1Your Several 420As are in the top ten of all officers I have ever worked with.
@puckthepilot @S1Your How dare you besmirch the quality of the commissioned officer AG corps? It takes a lot of work to fuck up everything you just mentioned.  It’s an art not a science to be able to screw things up the way we do.
@dwdavison9318 It’s a total embarrassment. Right wingers will lap it up. As will the media.
@daveanthony I again am amazed at how consistently this website gets people to pull their pants down.
@RebornADemocrat @leslieleeiii I’m actually thinking that south Florida police departments and DAs are really skittish after what is coming to light with Epstein and want to make this kind of arrest and (potentially) prosecution as loud and visible as possible.
@XOofXOs @AirPowerUnicorn You stole my line, XO.
@daveanthony Wow it’s debunked already.  Powerful people really believe that their words can really make something true without any evidence?
@MotherOfDoggons @JABell27 @CharlieMike87 Totally with you.  Police are not trained to be mental health interventionists.  Nor should they be.  They have a different role.  If we had mental health professionals on call like we had police officers maybe society would be in a better place.
@ryanlcooper Holy hell.  Ryan, did you get control of the Bloomberg twitter feed tonight?
@SenhorRaposa Yeah the power differential is difficult to imagine. Especially with seniority in the house.
@SenhorRaposa It would only really be feasible in the single seat states and not even then. Does Phil Scott run against Peter Welch at any point? Or Steve Bullock against Gianforte? Maybe Mark Begich now against Don Young.
@Hagrid_Dobby @MaeKrugs @NastyNana16 @IAmKrishanPatel @DonnaFEdwards @amyklobuchar @ewarren @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris Asking the powerless to put names to their accusations? That never turns out poorly. Ask Christine Blasey Ford how attempting to bring the powerful to account works out. Or any of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. If she’s a bad boss to her direct employees how will she be as POTUS?
@NYTmag Despite your continued attempts to make me do it, I will not feel empathy to millionaires who refuse to change their circumstance to bring about the change they seek.  He’s far better situated to bring about the change he wants than a lower class citizen anywhere.
@theLAndmagazine @TheEchoLA @Mike_Eagle @ExileRadio @rhettmatic @BRAINFEEDER @stonesthrow @ArtDontSleep @HnRcrew @MCNocando @BATHSmusic Wish I could be there.  Have fun.
@AsInMarx I’m sure they already have reservations on Peter Theil’s Waterworld villas.
@mtsw @Trillburne Campaign Motto: the beatings continue until morale improves.
@ebruenig Jeezus I didn’t see the cc.  This has to go in the archive as one of the worst tweets of all time.
@clubtrillion @tatefrazier OMG. Did you bring a chiropractor or masseuse for Tate with you?
@IAmKrishanPatel @DonnaFEdwards @amyklobuchar @ewarren @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris +1 Krishan.
@david_j_roth This shit makes me want to drive into a bridge abutment.  If your trash as a politician your trash. Don’t get too invested in any of them because they will disappoint you.
@mtsw Yeah it’s maddening.  Old Repubs are getting more right wing as old Dems in blue areas move to the right. Total misread of where the youth are heading
@AsInMarx Like she is irreplaceable as a Democratic Senator from the bluest state in the fucking country.  There are a dozen politicians in CA who could be appointed to that position tomorrow that would do better than her. And probably not belittle kids worried that they were going to die.
@AsInMarx What a fucking embarrassment.  She looked like trash belittling her constituents.  More so considering she won’t be alive to see the worst part of what climate change will do.
@melaka_redux @aamyrivv254 @KateAronoff I think resignation might be excessive but her treating too young to vote kids as trash is bad.  They count in the census and so CA is apportioned representation based on them.  They are her constituents whether they are old enough to vote or not. She shouldn’t belittle them.
@melaka_redux @aamyrivv254 @KateAronoff https://t.co/8SIem4uQTM oh look African-American city leaders complained and she still put it back up. Dianne Feinstein is trash.  These two links took less than a minute to find.
@melaka_redux @aamyrivv254 @KateAronoff https://t.co/wCiNbqWstA definitely sounds like an art exhibit when she was trying to prosecute the people burning the flag.  My facts and my fats are straight.
@politicsluo This is spot on.  Dianne doesn’t care.
@libbycwatson How you act to the people you have power over will reveal your true character. If she treats people who she sees every day like trash, how is she going to treat the public at large when they criticize her?  I’m so depressed aboit the apologia for her.
@andrewperezdc @libbycwatson Seriously check out Josh Dawseys Twitter post for all the atrocious pro-Klobuchar responses: 1. Who hasn’t had a bad boss, 2. Trump pussy-grabs, 3. Proves she’s tough, 4a. Sexism, 4b. Why isn’t there an article like about a male politician?, 5. Makes her strong IMHO.
@aamyrivv254 @KateAronoff You do realize that Dianne Feinstein allowed the Confederate flag to fly from City Hall in SF when she was mayor to try to curry favor for a VP nomination.
@TheHipsterRebbe @inthesedeserts Yes that would be better.  I still get mad thinking about how she got away with playing footsie with the Confederacy WHILE mayor of San Francisco in order to try and get a VP slot.
@TheHipsterRebbe @inthesedeserts Alternatively: watch Dianne Feinstein turn a Dem leaning voter into a Republican.
@classiclib3ral The absolute fucking apologia in every post about AK's atrocious behavior as a boss is so depressing. Just because you as an employee were treated like shit as an employee doesn't mean your boss was right to do so, and it definitely doesn't justify Klobuchar being a bad boss.
@JustSchmeltzer You think Barr and Guiliani are leaking this supposed end?
@kenklippenstein yeah, I mean watch a bunch of 'powerless' employees sink a Presidential campaign. It's going to be great.
@classiclib3ral @jonathanchait well a neoliberal above all believes in the supremacy of the boss and, in a larger sense, capital, over labor. No surprise Chait, would absolutely side with her. Disappointing, but not a surprise.
@JustSchmeltzer what'd I miss?
@S1Your @s1pog @merii3 @LadyLovesTaft Simple answer is that I don't pick up the phone, I am always busy when you come by and I only answer e-mails from people who make the decision about me getting promoted.
@matt_mollinedo @TomiLahren Tammy doesn't know how to add.  Add it to her many other deficiencies.
@leslieleeiii Must be a lot of Dolphin fans on that police force &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
@SenhorRaposa @jackcurran49 Peter King too
@daveanthony @HJBenjamin @willmenaker Well, it's kind of sad that this is what brings him down, while the way the franchise handled Aaron Hernandez is just memory-holed.
@matthewstoller I mean it's pretty amazing how Cuomo views himself as all powerful politically that he couldn't manage to outsmart a first-term Congresswoman from getting Amazon to change their minds about coming to NYC.
@jackcurran49 you forgot Virginia Foxx
@soonergrunt @S6Comms they are heated!!!
@daveanthony and they are abnormally attracted to accomplishing their sexual criminality in Florida for some reason.
@ChazNuttycombe Like was there worry about a primary challenger from his right, or did that Beto poll spook R's, or is there even worse internal polling?
@ChazNuttycombe I'm just wondering why Trump made that tweet about Cornyn already.  I know Cruz was uniquely unlikeable, but Cornyn doesn't exactly inspire confidence as robust, young face for Texas. I'm grasping a little, but it would seem that it must have been in response to something
@daveanthony shocking that a tech company would attempt to establish rules that only benefit themselves and steal others' intellectual property for their personal profit.
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions Cool Max, maybe you can lead the seminar on the political history of US intervention in Central America, or perhaps the political history of the coups we fully supported in Iraq and Iran last century.
@lions_by not only would I be interested, I would help.
@charlie_simpson Glad the VA is not criminally underfunded or anything.
@DavidKlion David, idiots like Bret assume if they don't have a memory of something about leftists that it didn't happen.  Doing research is too hard for them.
@JoePlenzler @coffeeshopjihad What's Facebook?
@leptopterygius @CalebJHull Fucking idiots - weren't they just blaming her for Amazon skipping out in NYC? She can't be a master politician and dumb idiot at the same time.  Which is she, Caleb, a strategist or a dummie?  Make up your mind, asshole.
This Never Trumpers are a hoot.  They are going to be waiting for a long time for Mittens to do anything. https://t.co/Aq8zqjwWQS
@soonergrunt @MaxBoot Personally, I think his brains are leaking out of the holes in Max's head from the surgical attachment of that stupid hat.
@CoreyRobin Twitter makes it too easy to expose your ass.Just do a little research for Gods sake. But he had a predilection to say something bad about Jacobin and instead exposed his own idiocy. At least Twitter’s good for getting people to pull their own pants down and embarrass themselves.
@SenhorRaposa This seems an odd endorsement in all aspects, is there R internal polling that shows Cornyn underwater against Beto or someone else?
I was traveling all day.  Did Pachinko Machine really delete all his shitty tweets from yesterday?
@krenshar_posts @overdesigned The horror.  Millennials like to eat, drink, coffee and hand out with their friends.  And they spend 60 pounds a week on it?  My god, it’s worse than climate change.
@ClaraJeffery @leahmcelrath @ryangrim @tomwatson You two realize that every one of Ryan’s followers can see you two tweeting at each other, right?  Who needs a slack channel when you two are just tweeting out stuff to everyone who already doesn’t like you?
@daveanthony By all means people should have enough money to waste on shit like this while the rest of LAX, JFK and La Guardia crumble from lack of investment.
@daveanthony @AdamParkhomenko @jonrosenberg God Pachinko Machine is really going all out for that $10K slot in the middle of the board.
@DrewVanDrese @CNN @CNNPolitics Jeff Zucker shares more in common with Donald Trump than the viewers who will be subjected to increasing levels of right wing propaganda and normalization.
@AirPowerUnicorn @TyrellMayfield All of this, 100%. I can’t express my views because military officers having political situations never end well. And it takes a lot to find other officers that think like me. On social I can do find the people I saw values with and interact with them and be funnier about it, too
@politicsluo I helped.  I called him Pachinko Machine.
@FischerNBC6 @MichaelRyanRuiz Where can I order this?
@robrousseau @AdamParkhomenko Has anyone scrolled through his tweets to see if he trumpeted Harris’s numbers or is the Pachinko Machine too busy running dumb and wasteful protests outside the White House? Seems like he should have been building a donor network from all those people.
@AirPowerUnicorn I’m here.  It’s me.
@LoneBlueKH @classiclib3ral @TheRickWilson Look I’m not trying to focus on Bernie or any other Dem.  focus on the Never Trumpers trying to ratfuck the Dem primary.  Don’t let them do it.
@RPG_volley @terrancesavery I feel “Suck it Up, this change is Happening” deserves its own line.
@classiclib3ral @TheRickWilson When one of the top 2 or 3 Never Trumpers mainstreams a QAnon conspiracy theory about a leading potential nominee of the Democratic Party.  Nothing to see here.
@PatBlanchfield These fake Never Trumpers will all absolutely work to help Trump if Bernie is the nominee.  It’ll help them because they’ll be relevant for four more years.  But they absolutely work for Republicans to replace Trump top if someone like Bernie runs in ‘24.
@ArmyStrang @vagrunt @corpseinorbit Seal Beach CA has a ton of bunkers for sub launched nukes.  The base officially closed but guess what’s still stored in the bunkers.  The 405 Freeway runs right by it between LA and Mission Viejo.
@vagrunt Also there were 8 atlas sites in and around Topeka.
@vagrunt Not to mention the megaton penetrators that would hit Falcon AFB and Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado
@vagrunt I’ve seen a map that would be fallout zones from counterforce strikes.  Kansas would be totally drenched in fallout from strikes Warren AFB and SAC HQ outside Omaha.
@Cattileesi Sorry, I didn’t make the rules, but, yes
@SGMtheMan1 SAPR and POSH to all the yuks at Camp Buckner (the second summer).  Just really his embarrassment was a huge lesson and his P.E’s were all based on stuff that happened with him and his team.  Burned on my brain.
@SGMtheMan1 At USMA, we actually had this happen.  The head cadet of the Rabble Rousers (cadet coed cheer squad) for tagged for fostering a poor environment, including allowing sexual harassment and bad climate.  He was denied graduating with his class and spent the whole summer teaching...
@Cattileesi Against the grain.  Write a detailed thread refuting everything @TomHeartsTanks said about the AFCT.
@vagrunt It’s because Neera prescribes to the Law of Civility.  We must all be friends at the end of the day.
@SenhorRaposa NY Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is the same way.  Believe he had the best performance statewide of anyone in ‘18. While a Dem he’s relatively inoffensive and always in the news for saving money and getting good returns on investments. It’s possible to be non political in that job.
@daveanthony I bet this dumb asshole is fully supportive of Trumps tariffs make shit more expensive and driving companies out of business.  Fucking idiot.
@sgtjanedoe @TomiLahren Also too I didn’t remember her bleating about any football player accused of rape or domestic violence nearly as much as she does as any of them expressing their opinions.  And again who the fuck is she?  She thinks she earned her job as opposed to some rich asshole paying her?
@sgtjanedoe @TomiLahren Yes I’m absolutely sure people would line up to watch me build another key developmental assignment tracker like they pay to watch Tom Brady.  Also it seems like Tammy’s problem is actually with owners not the players.  As Colin K shows they can not pay a player.
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa Looks like you found your next project.  Have you tried ballotopedia?  It might be evident but they do have state specific pages that will list constitutional positions.
@daveanthony Who would be Gareth’s co-host for The Dollop about this?
@S1Your @s1pog @TomHeartsTanks Well I agree with you.  My entire state has one authorization for a PT.  I like the theory but we’ll run into the same issues with filling these slots like any other AMEDD positions.
@soonergrunt Man fuck that guy. My grandfather and father had massive heart attacks.  Both were normal weight for their heights.  My dad has lost 30 pounds in the years before he died and it didn’t matter.  I shouldn’t feel like I have a time bomb in my chest no matter what I eat or work out?
@S1Your @s1pog @TomHeartsTanks They published the alaract directing all units to put in order for the equipment without having in let the contract for who’s going to actually supply it.  Seems like it should have been in the other way around.
@ArmyStrang Where does Ted Drewes fall on this if you haven’t had it since GWBs first team?
@ArmyStrang Turning schools into for profit enterprises and having made up a fake drug dealer who threatened his life might cause some problems too
@WTF_Judge @IPPSArmy Highly unlikely.
@S1Your @merii3 @SNAFU_Sara @CSM_Gan @fortjacksoncg @BlondsOvrBaghd @IPPSArmy Back to the drawing board of witty replies and backhanded compliments about the illustriousness of our beloved AG Corps.
@sgtjanedoe @DrillDarkSide I know at least one officer exists.  I recruited him to my state.  I’ve never confirmed there exists any others where he came from.
@robrousseau @MrNashington @JordanUhl just fucking jesus - a word salad worthy of Michelin Award
@SKRollins @sepinwall GRRM is still an EP right?  He must not be able to change it that much from the show. (Unlike having Jaqen kill Amory Loach instead of the Being killed in the near pit in Harrenhal by Roose Bolton)
@theLAndmagazine look what made it across the country in the mail to NY.  So excited to get back to my roots.  Keep up the great work and can’t wait to subscribe. https://t.co/oRm5Wg0umj
@SKRollins @sepinwall yeah, there was discussion, but none of that (nor his parentage) was actually firmly delineated in the book in words.  Only when Season 6 and 7 aired were suspicions confirmed.  Best fake out is if GRRM actually kills Jon in the next book, then his parentage is moot.
@Politics1com @politicsluo Jeezus god, someone needs to get Beto to run in this race!!!!!!!!
@ArmyStrang When are you guys reviewing any movie from the Iron Eagle franchise?
@SKRollins @sepinwall I've red all five main series books.  Jon was stabbed and lying bleeding out at the end of the 5th book at Castle Black.  His mother is definitely never revealed in any of those five books.  Melisandre was also burned alive in a cage hanging from The Wall in that book, too.
@sepinwall Also, remember as far as book readers know, Jon Snow is dead!
@mcimaps who the fuck is this asshole?  We have to listen to what some guy who doesn't want to pay more taxes just because he has more money.  His opinion isn't any more valuable than any other Democratic primary voter. Let the voters decide.
@Tempiwmf I think it is (been a long time since I saw those). Also, too, tangentially related to Outbreak, but the Army was withholding the vaccine because they wanted to use the virus as a bioweapon and have the only cure.
@thedollop Yep, it's going to absolutely be a solution proposed on some Nazi reddit thread and make it mainstream when some politician from some red state mentions it like that fat porker who said he'd drown his kids if they were gay.
@thomaswright08 @SecPompeo umm, Saudi Arabia doing all of these things too, but we're fine with it?
@thedollop Some pharmaceutical company is going to absolutely develop and release a virus that kills millions just to be the only one with the vaccine.
@AndrewSolender @RadioFreeTom They filmed out by setting up the set vertically and having the explosion go up toward the camera at the top.  That's the NYC scene.
@ArmyStrang oh jesus, that's all we needed to do? LBJ or Nixon could have just gone out the Rose Garden and say we won and the Vietnam War would be over? Why didn't I think of that?
@ArmyStrang @disco_socialist well, isn't the opioid crisis basically a dry run for this?
@WTF_Judge it was good to know that the man who was the senior law enforcement official in the entire country believed in dumb tropes and stereotypes (drink Irish FBI agents?). I'm sure his beliefs had no adverse affects on the policies he chose to pursue. What a disgusting human being.
@robrousseau @virgiltexas @cushbomb All for Matt getting on stage just to see him call someone a soulless ghoul to their face for proposing tax credits or health savings accounts.  Would make my day.
@JustSchmeltzer Dumb part is she’s right.  The job were definitely going to pull in people who don’t currently live in NYC.  Can anyone explain why Ben gets to have this public of an opinion in anything?  Who the hell is he?
@leslieleeiii Rich people would absolutely pull a reverse Bane in Manhattan, seize the bridges, and pay for Blackwater to fortify the shores and do resupply by air and submarine.
@ChazNuttycombe @politico_chris ‘Bout time.
@vagrunt Oh god I hope there as good as the post recession NYT puff pieces about how rich people had to forgo 50 wedding guests for their opulent shitshow weddings and could only invite 300 people
@ArmyStrang @PaulyShore I'm in St. Louis starting Saturday - bring me, an utter nobody, on the podcast!  I have controversial opinions on how the second Red Dawn movies is the superior movie.
@joncprevo @SenhorRaposa By all means, they should burn all the money in CA, IL, NY, NM, and MA. They are all competitive.  Specifically, targeted ads in the most expensive media markets that voted for Clinton by 60-70 points will be a great use of money.
@stanimals @swin24 yeah, we need a sarcasm sans font or something.
@swin24 Don't forget to lob charges of antisemitism at anyone who justifiably attacks him.
@stanimals @swin24 it's sarcasm.

@beardedcynic473 @HellOfAWay Well Duncan Hunter will have a lot of new friends really soon. Disgusting pussbag criminal and immoral asshole.  No honor either blaming his wife.
@S1Your @TomHeartsTanks @Cattileesi @IPPSArmy Come on, we're AG officers, we have no boot straps.  And, Tom, had his taken away when he started liking Strykers over M1s.
@beardedcynic473 @HellOfAWay especially when assholes like Clint Lorance and Allen West give civilians a false representation of what it means to be in the military.  Duncan Hunter sucks, too.
@beardedcynic473 Mike, listened to you on @HellOfAWay just now.  Enjoyed it a lot.
@SenhorRaposa Someone's never heard of sarcasm.  This Caleb Hull guy is a moron.  And conservatives wonder why there are no successful conservative comedians.  They aren't funny and don't understand common comedic tropes that make people laugh.
@merii3 @S1Your Yeah, that's got to me the most shocking fact I've come across in a long time. MIND = BLOWN!
@willmenaker I'm fucking sure we could find someone who thought Idi Amin or Robert Mugabe were great bosses too, but again they were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
@MaxBoot Fucking great, let's have Democrats define themselves by what Republicans think of them.  Brilliant Max.  That's worked out so well every time it's been tried.
@kenklippenstein Wasn't this essentially Neal Katyal's argument for Kavanaugh?
@merii3 I hate them too, but I have to stand a couple hours every day because sitting too long screws up my back.  That is your future as an old HR officer!
@TheDCSentinel Maybe if these stupid douchebags would just fucking stop and think about what about Ilhan’s background (refugee from a country subject to decades of US intervention and proxy wars) would make her particularly suited to question Abrams in this way.  But that requires reflection.
@CoreyRobin What the American people accept being done in their name is shocking only if you refuse to open a book.
@Johngcole Abrams faces zero acccountabilty and the. Got to be buddy with the next generation of state department leaders when he should have been rotting in a cell.
@Johngcole This is the of shit you say ten years on at the high school reunion about the class bully, not someone responsible for deaths of thousands of innocent people and the destabilization of multiple countries.
@virgiltexas I told Max boot fuck you and that he belongs in prison after him stanning Eliot Abrams
@DanteAtkins Woah, lets tie it easy here.  Not reason to go to Level 10 on this right off the bat Dante.   Let’s ease into that fire take next time.
@soonergrunt Holy cow I was right.  It’s literally the only person who has to be around her for more than ten seconds at a time and he’s seen her in that sausage casing swimsuit.  Gross.
@ArmyStrang I would kill for the original Rampage.
@ConnorSouthard @MaxBoot he should have been serving honorably in a prison cell for the rest of his life for the number of people he got killed.  But I guess since they were brown, it was all OK, right, Max?
@soonergrunt wow, there truly is someone for everyone I guess - jeezus, I can't imagine wanting to spend a single second with her.  I wonder if this guy gets to see her in that disgusting sausage wrapping bathing suit she has.  Yikes.
@ConnorSouthard @MaxBoot Oh, the Iraq War all makes sense now!  Of-fucking-course, we were just restoring democracy by invading it, firing its entire army and bureaucratic personnel.  Fuck you Max Boot, I lost a lot of friends for your war-mongering.  You should be in a prison cell.
@thehill hey look it's David Duke but without the baggage.
@BradMossEsq Hey look, one of the primary architects of the Invasion of Iraq has a blind spot for his friend who also worked to overthrowing governments of Latin American countries.
@robrousseau @michaeljknowles @IlhanMN People wonder why we don't take the charges of antisemitism against her in good faith.  Just making fake shit up out of whole cloth.  And the people who follow him will believe it and eat it up.
@mtsw Caleb Hull is a no talent ass clown
@willmenaker @CalebJHull @IlhanMN What the hell, Caleb, bet you fully supported of Brett Kavanaugh and the Big D*ck Toilet Salesmen being disrespectful to Democratic members of Congress.  Elliot Abrams had to be pardoned, meaning he's a criminal.  And a never charged planner of genocides and military coups
@S1Your @merii3 @shopmyexchange I heard that a truckload of 60K energy drinks went missing in Texas yesterday.
@EoinHiggins_ Eoin, she was ensconced in Fox News until she got her MSNBC job and now none of her new friends feel it's couth to attack/ask her about the things she did that made this country measurably worse.  That's how she disconnects herself from accountability from her role in Bush'43.
@MEPFuller The worst part is the hope you feel each time it gets close and then crushes you as it shuts down again.
@EricKleefeld What the fuck is this senile asshole talking about?  He spent his career attacking other African-American people for not dressing like his TV character.
@daveanthony Provocative, willing to challenge conventional wisdom--Dave, you're a disruptor! Well done.
@dwdavison9318 it's fucking amazing that's the most accountability anyone involved in Iran-Contra has gotten since 1992.
@S1Your I'll have you know I reserved the right to pull my pants down and expose my ignorant ass the entire time while I was in command.
@politicsluo The embodiment of Matt Damon in The Martian.
@ArmyStrang OMG, it's really happening.  My shitty day just got 1000% better.
@ArtBeachTeach1 @TheLoveBel0w @SRuhle @AnandWrites Theoretically I agree with you.  However this is not borne out by evidence.  A vast majority of Americans opposed last year’s tax cuts yet the people with more money got their tax cuts. And the people with more money will always have influence disproportionate to the  rest of us.
@politicsluo it's kelli ward right?
@ArmyStrang @willmenaker Fucking something only rich white people will advocate for.  There's been this perception that anti-vaxxers are poor rubes fooled by fake information.  In fact, it's solidly upper middle class white people who think they are smarter than the doctors, but believe ISIS is in Mexico
@daveanthony Dave, we all know the answer to that, unfortunately. Seems like low-hanging fruit for the UN Human Rights Commission to investigate, especially with the proximity.
@SNAFU_Sara I have a guy who has a desk treadmill.  Imagine trying to do work like you are living in a West Wing walk n' talk scene.
@SNAFU_Sara I just had a delicious Reese's Valentine Heart.  It was everything I had hoped it would be.
@SNAFU_Sara this asshole doesn't even have the originality not to rip off the screen name of a way more famous person's twitter page.  Although it seems he did copy the more famous's guy's misogyny and general asshole-ishness
@Cattileesi well done, make sure your meme ability is listed on your next support form.
@SenhorRaposa To me, you've got to fight to have a chance, he's probably not running again in '26. Investment in KY in '19 GOV and '20 SEN is important to building back something in KY.  It'll be hard but you've got to rebuild the state party organizational capacity.
@SenhorRaposa There was an episode the Underdog podcast (the pod that followed Beto around during his campaign) where Wendy Davis did some actual real reflecting on what she screwed up (listened too much to consultants who told her to tack to the center and even to the right).
@SenhorRaposa I got into a Twitter spat with her last week because she was shilling for some prescription drug scam.  She went back and deleted her responses, so may be SHE IS RUNNING.
@robrousseau Are we sure they're not vampires?
@CJ_usawtfm Isn’t this when like the Air Force was blowing alll that money on its bands.  Someone thought the PR was more important, I guess.
@DougJBalloon It was in sunny Southern California so it had that benefit, at least.
@ArtBeachTeach1 @TheLoveBel0w @SRuhle @AnandWrites Show me one uber rich person from any era who has EVER voluntarily given up power for any reason? Why would we ever expect them to come to the table? They will always fight, it’s on the American public to force an accounting of them and system that allows them to get that rich.
@DougJBalloon I remember often in high school Conor would think him lording his ‘superior’ intelligence over us made him seem cool when it actually made him seem cruel and smug.
@leptopterygius @sgtjanedoe All I’m going to say is Florida’s gonna Florida.
@gelliottmorris Well that would align pretty closely with Schultz polling at 8%.  And those who say both are too extreme would go to Schultz and probably give the election to Trump.
@adamjschmidt @MichaelStahlke Personally I think a follow-up article should be to google how far away the nearest high school is that has metal detectors and then go find a kid who goes to that school and see what their life is like.
@ChazNuttycombe There have been some bad @SenhorRaposa food takes on here, but this take is worse than any of them.
@ActorAaronBooth @seanhannity wasn't there an @TheOnion article about them setting up a fake satellite antenna to beam only Lion Animal Planet videos or something to the White House.  Yeah, that needs to really happen now.
@merii3 @TomHeartsTanks @Cattileesi @USArmy lol
@TomHeartsTanks @Cattileesi @USArmy I absolutely desire the CSF deployment patch.  I played a couple of high school football games there.  I qualify, right @merii3?
@JABell27 @TomHeartsTanks ooh, you admitted a mistake.  I haven't seen a field grade do that in awhile.
@JABell27 @TomHeartsTanks too true.  Doesn't say much for the officer development scheme in the Navy.
@TomHeartsTanks some village is missing its idiot.  This asshole would never accepted this in any environment when he was a ship captain.  "Well, Captain, we shot down 6 of the seven planes attacking us during the drill, oh, that seventh one put two ASMs center mass and knocked out the ship."
@MotherOfDoggons does she not understand the concept altogether or does she just forget which is which?
@ChazNuttycombe Got to find a top-end candidate for ME and NC.  I know they are hard slogs, but they have to try.
@ActorAaronBooth even better.
@ActorAaronBooth wouldn't he be better served now by running against Ducey in '22?
@SenhorRaposa I mean jeez imagine if they devoted 1/10th of the focus that they did on Ilhan Omar's comments, Steve King would never make it out of a primary.
@SenhorRaposa nothing like running two campaigns in four years to gain this seat.  High hopes for this one.  Should be highly doable considering what I've posted in the past that John McCain was artificially buoying the concept of "Red Arizona."
@vagrunt this was the focus of an entire Seinfeld episode.  A black-and-white cookie did him in.
@brianbeutler this is the kind of punitive governing we can continue to look forward to.  A massive tax cut funded on the backs of mostly blue state taxpayers, the wall built with funds to recover/prevent disasters in CA and PR.  We can look forward to more of this from Repubs going forward.
So which Democratic Presidential candidates should actually be running for Senate? If politics is about the accumulation of power to enact policy goals, all these potential Senate candidates are sabotaging the ability of Dems to enact any sort of policy agenda starting in Jan '21
Without googling it, name one key policy, other than the wall, that Trump announced or advocated for at the State of the Union.
@cFidd @EricKleefeld President of what? His local homeowners association or PTA?
@amandamull The bagel shop near me started doing thin bagels.  Less bread still a whole bagel, so not as filling. Also are you talking length (top/bottom) or width?
@adamjschmidt My thoughts exactly.
@adamjschmidt Charlie Baker and Phil Scott and Nathan Deal and Greg Abbott and Steve Bullock too
@adamjschmidt Unfortunately your choices are Andrew Cuomo, Jerry Brown, Ralph Northam, Jay Inslee, Dan Malloy, Phil Murphy, Roy Cooper, John Hickenlooper, and Mark Dayton.  Kate Brown and Gina Raimondo too but they were pretty unpopular and won because their opponents were duds.
@jacobfhsmith @politicsluo The whole system is meant as a threat.  A Sword of Damocles over regular Americans with no interest in military service.  We needed to use it in ‘06/‘07 and Bush should have given he didn’t need to get re-elected.  Instead we just enlisted a bunch a criminals and drug addicts.
@TomHeartsTanks Sorry, Tom.
@Riley_McAtee I just started re-reading that book today to prep for Season 8.  I remember smugly laughing when The Rains of Castamere aired for the first time, seeing the Internet basically implode.
@S1Your Oh my god, I just had to do mine and I think I did a lot, but really all support forms for field grade officers are is claiming credit for the work your subordinates do for you.
@Scott_Brewer4 @Riley_McAtee well done.  To be fair, I'll always have the 2002 Western Conference Finals.
@SenhorRaposa This is totally clueless - the Dem Party has a great bench and has three ideal replacements for Northam, Fairfax, and Herring that could be elected in November if special elections were held.  Politico carrying the Dems in Disarray torch once again.
@Riley_McAtee Goddamnit, I hate that I recommended you do this.
@KeraRolsen My five year old self would be proud of you too.  My eyes betrayed be at 12 and thus I push paper in the army
@BibliotecariaRR @GustavoArellano @ArtWong128 @laloalcaraz I moved from south OC to NY for college in the late 90s.  Not NYC though.  It’s a great place (second only to SB-LA-SD metroplex) but so, so expensive to live.
@MollyJongFast @nycsouthpaw You’ve got to be careful of those foreign terrorist crab organizations
@HotlineJosh Within two minutes of this dumb tweet, Josh retweets Cory Booker calling on Fairfax to resign.  Amazing level of obtuseness here.
@theLAndmagazine any idea when it will ship nationwide?
@merii3 Fully endorse - Excels/Most Qualified already blocked on my profile for your next eval :)
@willmenaker fucking love even the whiff of accountability makes police officers think like they are in a war zone.
@merii3 @S1Your the second one is fake news.
@SenhorRaposa Like are Meadows and Jordan actually falsely liberal given their propensity for 'not conservative enough' protest votes.
@AsInMarx @politicsluo to quote Obama, please proceed, sir.
@MattGertz probably about the same as @speechboy71 who is named Michael Cohen.
@SenhorRaposa Right, but if she's voting against what the party votes because it's not liberal enough, wouldn't that be a false indication of her conservative-ness?
@SenhorRaposa No, a year-long CR, in addition to avoiding fights about the wall, also avoids making hard choices about other department funding levels.  It's actually bad if you care about the budgets because it allows no flexibility or growth of spending levels for changing situations.
@adamjohnsonNYC oh cool, a giant proxy war right next to the Panama Canal. What's a little internecine, multi-country war and assassination campaign that threatens global commerce as an added benefit. Oh and tens of thousands of innocent Venezuelans and Colombians murdered in the crossfire. Fun!
@adamjohnsonNYC but Adam that death squad warriors make excellent conversation at the DC dinner salons and can be pumped for recommendations for their kids to get into whatever college these ghouls go to.
@carlhannah @daveanthony Willful ignorance combined with Matt's propensity for hot takes on the fly on Twitter combine to his mentions getting demolished and (further) tarnishing his reputation.
@carlhannah @daveanthony it's even worse because he's an economist - a major part of the discipline is figuring out how to measure and quantify second- and third-order benefits.
@daveanthony Jeezus, Matt's an economist, knows all about side benefits accruing through investment in a major project, yet fails to see what exactly all the benefits accruing from a manned mission to the moon (science-wise) other than just getting there.  Amazing and clueless.
@politicsluo I would presume that she would serve in that capacity in an acting basis until the first fully scheduled election, which I assume she would run for.
@ryangrim @lhfang Huh, I guess that she assumes that she can inherit the characteristics of the people she defeats like some superhero movie villain?
@dwdavison9318 @HowardSchultz go get your shine box, Howard.
@SenhorRaposa Frankly, should there be one before the Congress has been in session for 90 days? Seems unfair to evaluate before there's been a couple of months.
@rockrichard just fuck, I bought that damned book and i'm staring at just getting more and more angry.  Walter Isaacson, Gay Talese, Leslie Stahl, and Gabe Sherman all blurbed what a great book it was on Amazon.  Three of these four definitely know the importance of fact-checking.
@SenhorRaposa me too.  The '09 stimulus allocated funds for high speed rail in the NE corridor. Would have allowed Boston to Buffalo line in less than 3 hours and connected to NYC through Albany. Right now Amtrak takes 2.5 hours.  Was supposed to reduce that to an hour. Shame it never happened
@daveanthony Everyone was all for this in the mid-90s in LA after the Northridge quake. Given the amount of insulation, wiring, and HVAC work that old buildings would need to be 'Green' certified, I'm not sure I understand the issue. Lots of jobs and subsidies to help home and building owners
@CapitalPockets @BFriedmanDC @HotlineJosh Yeah, I agree that if trains made a comeback, the TSA industrial complex would shift over there.  I'm not advocating for eliminating air travel, I'm advocating for a way to get from NY to Chicago in two hours, not six if you count the front end airport time (check bags, security)
@ryangrim @TheDCSentinel Ron Wyden stealing your bit
@Furrama @virginianpilot Well, as far as Norment is concerned, it is.  He's up in November.
@BFriedmanDC @HotlineJosh jeez, man, if I could get from Albany to Boston without having to go through NY or get to Chicago in a couple of hours without the security checkpoints and getting to the airport four hours early, I'm in.
@Doctrine_Man @AZCat89 @NerdVet touche, DM, touche.
Cool, Jerry Falwell, Jr. just endorsed DC statehood.  Thanks, Jerry! https://t.co/Ei6MT5dRkG
@SenhorRaposa Fucking MAGA guy going to run in one of the most ethnically diverse and disadvantaged districts in the country and thinks he can win.  Fucking Republicans are obsessed with her.
@AZCat89 @Doctrine_Man @NerdVet I mean everyone the Army Service Ribbon or ARCOT (Army Reserve Component Overseas Training Ribbon) tends to be the bottom right (As you look at a rack).  If that's suddenly on someone's top row, everyone would notice.  I've got to assume its the same for every branch of service.
@kenklippenstein Goddamn it, Ken, you know it's your brothers.  Krassensteins Unite!
@AZCat89 @Doctrine_Man @NerdVet I too left my OCP patches behind and had to run to the local MCS first thing in the AM and was late to my first meeting.  Furthermore, I can understand the CJCS, CSA, CSN and Commandant not necessarily saying anything (different awards), but the CSAF should have noticed!
@LA_Res_Tourist @mcmoynihan When people from VICE tore apart the galley release for its blatant inaccuracies (she went hard on them in the released excerpts)
@BrendanNyhan @KFILE Walter Isaacson, Gay Talese, Gabe Sherman and Leslie Stahl all wrote gushing recommendations that are used in the Amazon page for this book.  I wonder if this book exposing fact checking in non-fiction will also expose the falseness of the book “blurb” recommendation industry.
@mcmoynihan Goddamit I paid for that book.  I was leaning towards cancelling after the first fiasco, but the blurbs form multiple well known media people convinced me to take the plunge.  WTF?
@AZCat89 @Doctrine_Man @NerdVet Roger misidentified his position but the point remains.  Actually makes it even worse as it reinforces the reservists are all ate up even the generals.  I’m not sure how it happened - if it were upside down the awards would be he other way.
@geoffschwartz I disinctly remember almost every NE-IND game in the Peyton era being in Indy.
@Doctrine_Man @NerdVet Like we make mistakes, but a 4-star general is authorized an O5 as an aide.  Not to mention the various other staff officers and NCOs who must have not looked at this at all before allowing the CSAF to pulls his pants down on live TV. This is pretty much a career killer for many.
@IAmKrishanPatel @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa Fairfax and Northam appoints Perriello.
@IAmKrishanPatel @CTIronman yeah, he should see that.  Terry should pour everything into this and build momentum for a cabinet position.  He did a podcast highlighting how much harder a Republican Senate/Assembly made his life - think he would do everything he could to get 2 Senate &amp; 2 Assembly seats.
@usawtfmJ1 @TheWTFNation umm. SSD now? That's bordering on illegal, not just stupid.
@IAmKrishanPatel @CTIronman Wexton, Spanberger, too.  McAuliffe would be useful, too, though not in office.
@merii3 @S1Your No, I just re-purpose the spinner from a box of Bertie Bots every flavor beans to pick my suggested OML.
@mjhegar @ryangrim People barely making in America don't have time to find their chemo drugs or their insulin at the cheaper pharmacy.  Their time is scare and they're choosing between food and rent each month while trying to ensure their kids have coats for the winter.
@ryangrim @mjhegar goddamn it, what's so hard about not wanting to have to be a consumer about health care?  Why are we trying to force everyone to shop around?  Give people the medical care they need without them having to compare CVS vs Rite Aid.
@dwdavison9318 Tell you what, Eli, 'WE' will watch as your lead the revolutionary charge.  Oh, never mind, we know he's just going to cheer-lead bloodshed and civil war from afar like he was always does.  Why is Eli Lake allowed to opine on anything? He's always wrong and blood-thirsty wrong.
Yeah, having history books written when Reagan was president, having rats and mold making you sick and having to wear jackets and gloves to class because the heat is broken is so gauche.  How dare these kids want fairness? https://t.co/xK7FoGMpuM
@S1Your and if you really hate them you conveniently forget to remind your boss to submit it to HQDA in time for the DA board.
@emayfarris Policy bingo for class, Trump bingo for fun
@daveanthony The DC policy circle is really a no-fail industry.  I mean, ELIOT FUCKING ABRAMS, is back.  The man should have faced war crimes charges at The Hague.  Look how long Manafort hung around, too, despite obvious criminality.
@daveanthony does she realize she appears dumber with every tweet.  This is what happens when you only associate with people who don't actually face any consequences from any particular policy enacted (or not enacted) by Congress and the President.
@gmoomaw can it be mcAuliffe as a placeholder with Herring slated to run in '21?
@rockrichard @seanimus82 concur on Klay, he was basically a zero until he had that 50 point game a couple of weeks back.  Concur definitely on LeBron.
@rockrichard Don't disagree at all.  Fan vote skews to who's popular not who's better.
@robrousseau did you ever hear his interview where he said that the Women should be paid more in the movie/TV industry, but when asked if he was sacrifice his some of his salary to pay his female co-stars more and he said, "No No No"?
@rockrichard does it matter if we say no?  You're going to to do it anyway... :)
@ActorAaronBooth unless you run the government like a business.
This stupid asshole writes about the threat Donald Trump poses to America, then complains that Democrats won't run someone with Trump's policies, but without the uncouth behavior. WTF? If that's your belief, vote for the Dem, but Republicans down ballot. Otherwise, shut up. https://t.co/nQ5oyxBrEA
@cd_hooks it's more infuriating given liberal ballot measures more liberal than her positions passed statewide while she last to a cardboard cutout criminal
@LadyLovesTaft shouldn't this be on a "Out of Context" twitter feeds?
@Riley_McAtee will you be retweeting this hourly until it's not true.
goddamn, i'm so mad i missed dana perino's queso tweet as it happenend.
@ashleyfeinberg did she take a picture of her toilet after someone had too many beers?  what the hell is that?
@usawtfmJ1 @TheWTFNation @WTFNationRadio Is that near beer up top?
@jaredlholt the QAnon people are somehow more insane than resistance grifters now?  Holy mother of mayhew.
@UweBollocks can we tar and feather both of these assholes in whatever passes for the public square these days.  I'll let the third brother @kenklippenstein get a pass.
@UweBollocks Dick Cavett --&gt; Johnny Carson --&gt; Bob Barker --&gt; Tom Bergeron --&gt; James Corden --&gt; Will Menaker
@robrousseau Rob, i'm impressed that you came up with this and embarassed that I failed to seize this low hanging fruit.
@SenhorRaposa Drew, I think you were the only one!  You're on twitter, something must have come across your feed.
@SenSchumer well, Chuck, head on down there and fix it, then.  Bring Andrew, Kirsten, Bill and Letitia with you and get it fixed.
@jasongay sounds like an asshole that strolled by the newstand, read the paper, and then put it back and left without paying.
@UweBollocks jesus, because this is definitely something we should be wasting law enforcement resources on. Our country is dying from opioids flowing in and we're deporting rappers. This is fucking stupid.
@UweBollocks this is my favorite underrated food that hasn't really hit it big in the US yet.  I've never figured out why.  Let's encase our eggs in sausage.  How is this not sold drive thru at Sonic and McDonald's yet?
@Cattileesi @WestPoint_USMA Just kill me. I'm a USMA grad and could never understand what makes anyone who went there think they could act like this solely because they went there.  Congrats you went a college and graduated.  Just like thousands of other people every year, year after year.
@UweBollocks just made the same comment elsewhere - I'm sure there is no negative affects on infrastructure from such massive shifts in temperature at all.
@daveanthony I know, it's disgusting and meanwhile the city installs curved benches to prevent the homeless from sleeping on them and the homeless patrol will soon be making homelessness invisible in preparation for the Olympics. What a disgrace.
@joncprevo I'm sure 80 degree swings in temperature is totally normal and will have no consequences to infrastructure at all.
@SenhorRaposa I'm sure they'll have to write off OR/WA/NV and AZ now that Kelli Ward is in charge. And I'm sure Travis Allen is the perfect guy to bring back CA Repubs, lol!
@daveanthony Yes, send this guy down to the LA River to the people living in the rushes in the dry season, and see how great life is, or better yet force him to live in all the abandoned RVs under the 405 hoping not to get shiv'ed for the 'nice' trailer. Or trying to survive a code blue in NY
@SenhorRaposa Roy cooper just said he had to go.  I mean, if refuses, Obama’s got to reach out privately and tell him to resign.  If he doesn’t, then Obama’s got to go public.
@jacko2323 Holy hell, it means there’s other photos.  He has to go away now.
@daveweigel @IsaacDovere Damn it Dave.  This is the last frontier for that trope.  (It has to be!)
@dandrezner /snark
@dandrezner I’m sure this promotion was totally deserved and there’s nothing nefarious about it at all.
@politicsluo @joncprevo Once a clueless conservative, always a clueless conservative
@shannonrwatts @NRA Dana, Exit would Barbie, has logged on it appears.  Always refedhig to see her not at all disingenuous takes in things.
@RonaldKlain @crookedmedia I would gladly be corrupted by Big Donut.  And Little Donut for that matter
I was born in 1980.  I’ve never once seen someone wear blackface or dress up as a member of the KKK or done it myself.  Safe to say if you’ve done either of those things since the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, you might want to skip the whole elected office thing.
@ashleyfeinberg Yeah it was really bad
@rockrichard You'll have to get into Honolulu - O'Toole's is on the west of town, pretty close to the airport.  Irish pub, but there are a couple of good places around there to eat, especially Chinese, Thai, etc.
@KeraRolsen Kera, hit up Teddy's Bigger Burgers.  Also, Maui Mike's is a great rotisserie chicken place in Wahiawa up near Schofield.
@rockrichard are you willing to rent a car or not?  Not really any public tranist...Maui Mike's a great rotisserie chicken place in Wahiawa up near Schofield.  Teddy's Bigger Burgers.  Hit up the Arizona Memorial - public transit goes there.
@JustSchmeltzer @HowardSchultz But Eric, that just shows he’s pissing off the right people!
@BarstoolSC Keith Rivers
@pattymo I too abhor acknowledging social niceties perpetrated by others upon me. Those actions are an attack on me being a social outcast.
Look at this asshole blaming Kampala Harris for not knowing about something no one knew about until tonight.  Especially since the Harris tweet obviously refers more to Gillespie than Northam.  Seriously fuck off, ABC guy. https://t.co/8uO5QQFRNS
@johniadarola John, conservatives have been opining on women's uteri for decades.  They don't understand the first thing about any part of the female reproductive system, yet feel free to legislate about it.  Why should this be any different?
@WalshFreedom @RalphNortham Holy fuckballs,, he ran against a guy who espoused policies that the picture represents.
@jackcurran49 I think the Tom Perriello has to feel way, way worse.  There was clearly energy and support for a further left candidate, we just didn't realize it in November 2017.
@politicsluo seems like this would be a good time for Barack Obama to give Ralph a phone call and have a pep talk on why it's over.
is this a subtweet of Ralph Northam? https://t.co/cTMvpIoOPu
@leslieleeiii Leslie, I’m interested in you expanding on this if you are willing.
@politicsluo I mean all signs right now would be he would probably win in ‘25 as easily as he would in ‘21.  Sends this back to me when I’m wrong.
@politicsluo And it’s going to be seven years.  Herring has to switch to LTGOV now right?
@mcimaps bigger question is whether Fairfax can run in '21?
@SenhorRaposa I wonder what VA Constitution says.  I believe his term is less than half over so Fairfax can't run, based on other consitutional officer rules.
@SenhorRaposa Just shows you how utterly incompetent the VA GOP is.  They had FOUR shots against this guy and never ONCE thought to do oppo on his yearbooks.
@ActorAaronBooth it's his medical school - the Eastern Virginia Medical School Alumni Yearbook link is already broken.
@browntailedhawk @McF_Nbctoday @politicsluo It's not a high school yearbook photo - it lists that he graduated from VMI, so it appears to be a yearbook from his medical school.  I would have doubts that even in 1983 a medical school would publish something like that.
@SenhorRaposa The Eastern Virginia Medical School Alumni site is broken now from people trying to find this picture.
@rudnicknoah I mean, for hells, Northam has run races in '07/'11 for State Senate, '13 for LTGOV and '17 for Gov.  And his '17 race had a charlatan opponent that would have only been too happy to use this and it wasn't found until now? I assume that his medical school yearbook?
@SenhorRaposa Furthermore, President Harris could nominate Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg and anti-abortion people will still call her a baby killer and work to vote her out.
@SenhorRaposa If abortion is a voter's key issue one way or another, there is nothing ANYONE can say or do to get them to change their vote the other way.
@politicsluo @BenScionti I think the key point is that there’s a difference between having Nativa American blood in your family history and growing up with Native American identity/culture and some believe her claiming the ancestry without living the culture is problematic.
@JustSchmeltzer So they're basically say Next of Kin cannot make these end of life decisions?  Who makes it then?  Are we still in 2005?  Isn't this what happened with Terry Schiavo? Now it applies to kids?  Who pays for continued medical care for the forced living?
@DZBillFulton @iAmTheWarax what a fuck hole.  This is the same kind of shit reasoning / privatization strategy that is trying to kill off commissaries and PXs.
@vagrunt LOL, this is perfect.  I sense this is going to be the repeating theme of Cory's campaign.
@MichaelCastFS I still stan that that 2002 Iowa team with Brad Banks (that USC best in the Orange Bowl) was the most exciting team to watch that season.
@dwdavison9318 does he get paid by the word?
@p_jeanne97 @databaird @mehdirhasan @IanSams @larabazelon I mean FFS it's only a 29 minute podcast.  What a coward.  Listen to the podcast, man!
@mehdirhasan @7im To be fair, no one listens to liberals/lefties at the time.  See: Criminal Justice Reform, Iraq War.  A larger indictment of the default position towards punishment and war that our country accepts.
@kenklippenstein @tytinvestigates Ken, there was a terrible limo accident here in Upstate NY that killed two dozen people a few months back and the investigation stopped because of the shutdown.
In retrospect, a better question for Howard Schultz should have been, "When was the last time you went to a grocery store to buy a week's worth of groceries?" Follow-ups: "Which grocery store was it?" "How much did you spend?"
@AoDespair @BA_Friedman baseball
@jaredlholt Ripping off my credulous supporters to own the libs
Love the centrist pundits and politicos already afflicted with the "Howard Schultz pisses off the right people" Tourette's.
@willmenaker @rickklein @ABC What the fuck is this guy talking about?  He has a podcast about the intersection of sports and politics - why is he opining on Howard Schultz unless it's to highlight his cheapness in not keeping the Sonics in Seattle.
@willmenaker @stephenfhayes These dumbasses are all going to vote for Trump - they just have to remain ambiguous about it in order to keep pulling money in from The Resistance.  All grift, all the time.
@willmenaker @daveanthony Jesus, wasn't all the furor on the left for knowing she would cave.  She should stick to her guns and bring people with her instead of caving.  She jumped into this without be willing to fight and have the right message and language to win this argument.
@cjchivers @JimLaPorta @nikkiwentling Concur with this.  TRICARE referred me for a routine exam with a cardiologist and I had to wait 3 months.  The follow up was another 3 months.
@kenklippenstein They stole all my jokes
@DemmyIII @robrousseau @gatewaypundit @AOC He isn’t called the dumbest man on the internet for nothing.  Heavy is the crown and he’s gotta keep the dumbness meter on tilt at all times.
@IwriteOK @MaxBoot No, that would mean Max would actually have to experience the conditions caused by the policies he espouses. Then he might have doubts about them, you know real doubts, not doubts caused by a charlatan POTUS who Max thinks is too loud in advocating for the same policies he wanted
@ryangrim God what a shithead.  Even Cheney was smart enough not to say the quiet part loud.  Just reinforces my theory that Republicans never facing consequences for any action foreign or domestic just emboldens them to be more brazen and act more criminal.
McConnell can’t bring anything to the floor (see shutdown), Graham is going to more stupid shot like his Stone memo, and the “moderates” are going to be scared of their own shadows (see Gardner’s comments today)
I think we vastly underestimating the effect McConnell, Graham, Gardner, Burr and Collins having to get through a primary next spring is going to affect how crappy the Senate is going to be the next 12-15 months. They will have to stay close to Trump on everything.
@JudsonCarmicha1 @Popehat Lindsay’s got a primary to win!
@MaxBoot Jesus, Max we have been hitting hem with drone strikes for the last 5 years (or longer).  Dropping bombs on people is not terrorizing the populace?
@jacobfhsmith @politicsluo So what is Cory betting on here happening between the primary and the general?  He obviously believes he needs to get through the primary but he has to know this dooms him.  Is he just tying to avoid the embarrassment of losing a primary?  Why not just not run like Flake?
@jessespector @HowardSchultz You stole my tweet from this morning.  And it’s not just a small ratio.  We’re talking 10 to 1 or more
@robrousseau @gatewaypundit @AOC This man doesn't not how battery storage works? Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought an idiot than to open your mouth and prove it, Jim.
@ReignofTroy My Dad and his great stories about Pat Haden and JK Mckay.
@daveanthony @KamalaHarris yeah, because she made a lot of rich people seem dumb by stanning for her.  So, the moral is, as long as you punish poor people/don't embarrass rich people, you're in the clear.
@LeoShane We have a VA here in Albany, it could take me 30 minutes if I drive one way, less if I go another way.
@daveanthony @KamalaHarris fully endorse - it seems like the only person of any wealth that faced any criminal repercussions for any financial malfeasance last decade seems to Bernie Madoff and that was because he stole money from other rich people.
@robrousseau soylent billionaire?
@HoldenCasey My heart was in my throat the whole time trying to keep up with the results.  Then the notification came on my phone and I just had a vast sense of relief.
@TomHeartsTanks welcome, the rest of us soulless automatons welcome you to an existence of pure, unadulterated pain.  You will soon grow to enjoy the pain.
@JonnieBratwurst @adamslily @KFILE based on her record, this seems to be her whole campaign at this point.
@baseballot now I hope he runs in 2022 just to have to explain this.
@IwriteOK @benshapiro Ben is dumb.  Love all the conservatives rushing to Schultz's defense. Makes it kind of obvious who he's running for when you look at who defends him.
@Steven_Hyden To be honest, that’s the best way to experience Bari Weiss.  Otherwise your eyes would bleed from the stupidity.
LOL, the @HowardSchultz account has 9 tweets.  Each one has been ratioed at least 9 to 1.  Some as high as 11 to 1.
@robrousseau @ebruenig @MattBruenig if the federal government can run their years from 1 Oct-30 Sep, why can't socialists decide a year starts on 1 Feb and ends on 31 January? 😀
@TomHeartsTanks @barefootboomer Gentlemen, let's be honest, we'll pay the Colombian military to do the dirty work for us while Exxon and BP somehow magically end up getting all the oil.
@TomHeartsTanks Just saw that the go/no-go decision has to be made by October 2020, so the longer we got without a definitive answer, the longer the time before we actually execute this misguided fiasco.
@conor64 Conor has been a self-important jerk since high school.  This is a dumb idea considering Conor is concerned about people saying billionaires shouldn't exist while right-wing nationalists are running people over in cars and massacring Jewish people in Pittsburgh.
@PatBlanchfield I’m so sorry, Patrick.
@PatBlanchfield Oh my holy Jesus.  Just wow.  What do you say?
@tonybonesarelli The donors called.  I mean we all knew her saying it was too good to be true.
@daveanthony Didn't she literally get the truancy law passed through her advocacy as the AG?  She MADE the law.  If she doesn't build or advocate for it, it never becomes law.
@rudnicknoah To be fair, look at the fail parade of Repub election politicians.  The SOTU response ended Jindal's career and turned Marco into a water swilling joke.
@rudnicknoah didn't they have the ex-KY governor do it once too or was he still in office?
I hereby patent the Right-Wing/Rich People/Centrist term "Venezuela Tourette's"  It's an affliction when you blurt out "VENEZUELA!" anytime popular support in America climbs for socialist policies like Free College/ MFA or higher marginal tax rates for rich people.
@jordanzakarin no he considered paying his employees their wages charity.
@lions_by We're with you, boys.  Appreciate the weekly episodes - makes work much more fun.  Somehow you make me look forward to Monday
But doesn't someone have to explain how to pay for increases in the Defense budget? https://t.co/tQVvIk6Gdh
@Mikel_Jollett @cenkuygur @TVietor08 for the rich, it's easy to be progressive when you can rely on people donating to your foundation to help fund your "progressive" goals.  But once it comes time to actually use your actual money, they will fight to the death to keep their ridiculous level of wealth untouched.
What's fucking hilarious about this is that AOC has no power (yet).  Just her merely talking about the Green New Deal and taxing the rich and MFA, et al. has gotten Shultz and the rest of the soulless rich ghouls attacking her.  Sounds like she's on to something. https://t.co/lhKQGcowyT
@MattGertz Trump Watches Maddow!
@Lkatzenberg @MarineWithMoxie This f’ing a-hole just carries around potentially sensitive information on a yellow legal pad?  And then carries the pad into a briefing room with cameras?  Information that is obviously part of ongoing deliberations of the government. Just WTF?
@daveanthony @BootsRiley That man that Boots took on should just delete his account and start over on social media
@RL_Miller @SenJohnKennedy @marwilliamson Whenever you as a politician can take a cheap dig at a stereotype of a job and the people who perform it, you should just open that mouth big and wide and jam the whole foot in.
@BigDub1 @adamjohnsonNYC @briebriejoy ...to do and still got elected.  Then he did it.  And that’s in a city twice as big.  She could have led but it’s easier to whitewash.
@BigDub1 @adamjohnsonNYC @briebriejoy I mean you could argue that she was forced to be tough to be elected (not an argument I support) and re-elected.  That’s an indictment of the default nature of a politician being law and order.  But it makes her not much of a leader.  Larry Krasner told you what he was going...
@SolidVerbal lol, why this year - that's been USC's motto since 2009
@adamjohnsonNYC man shit - you hear interviews and think politicians/leaders have good ideas and then they disappoint you.  I guess this is the entire basis of Kamala's candidacy, say lots of shit, but when you were in power, you didn't actually use that power to affect anything you advocate.
@adamjohnsonNYC @briebriejoy I love how she's leaning into her criminal justice history with her campaign slogan. Shows she clearly lacks self-awareness of what a major flaw it is, which really doesn't bode well for how she'd react when she caves to Republicans on some policy issue or another.
@dylanmatt Instead he will burn piles of his money uselessly instead of keeping a Seattle institution from moving away.  His failure to keep the Sonics in Seattle show what kind of politician he would be.
@SolidVerbal Is this more of an indictment of Helton's play-calling or Daniel's play-making abilities?
@IAmKrishanPatel @SymoneDSanders I demand a livestream!
@rudnicknoah Look I'm going to take Hugh Hewitt's great interest in Schultz's run as him being convinced it's bad for Democrats and he really just wants Trump to win and is just too scared to come out and actually say so because then he stops getting invited on the Sunday shows.
@daveanthony @matthewstoller dynamite drop-in here
*keep
This shit is fucking stupid.  We (finally) got Dems to stand together throughout the shutdown and not cave, so naturally, the next work day leads with "DEMS IN DISARRAY" headline! https://t.co/t4K6XY4CFh
@RosieGray what the fuck?  He doesn't want to talk about his policy positions?  This vapid circle jerk of a campaign is a perfect encapsulation of what rich people think they can pull over on the poors they view as their inferiors.
@politicsluo @rudnicknoah says no American politician in history.
@ZumbielSam @Riley_McAtee lol, so true.  Poor Riley has to be the public face of this too.
News Flash: Being rich doesn't mean the rest of us care more what you say. Most likely, you're still the same asshole you were before you were rich.
@Riley_McAtee I'm here for every delusional Trade Machine screen capture regarding AD.
Can we have Mike Bloomberg and Howard Schultz please conduct a Hunger Games style competition in Central Park?  Only the winner gets to befoul our presence with their Presidential race.
@JordanUhl you forgot Gritty.  He has my vote.
@travis_view Wasn't it that Ginny Thomas meeting last week where he got yelled at?
@SenhorRaposa Beltway media circle jerks
@AndrewSolender Yeah, that guy's take is dumb.  There is no cross-over support between Gary Johnson and a core D voter.  If a person is thinking of voting for Gary Johnson and changes their mind to vote Trump, they were NEVER going to vote for Hilary or any other prospective D nominee.
Instead of burning all his money in a pointless Presidential campaign, why didn't Howard Schultz just buy the SuperSonics to prevent them from leaving Seattle?
Tom should have just said "I hang out with old rich white people like myself and here's what we actually think." If your going to be an old, racist crank, lean all the way in, don't dance around the edges. Wonder how this line of thought affected his journalism over the years? https://t.co/2WH5GWMr5d
Pretty sure Howard Schultz is the plutocrats' stalking horse as they seek a way to avoid the pitchforks they see coming.  Also, his candidacy was definitely cooked up in some rituals of the ghouls at Davos.
Love the ratio on his tweet!  11-to-1 and climbing. https://t.co/o0d98Mif0T
To be clear all of those Sunday shows should be destroyed by fire.
Why the fuck is Meghan McCain on my TV talking about the next budget deal?  She’s not a politician or a political correspondent.  In short she knows shit all as I do about what happens at the end of the current C.R.?  God the ‘meritocracy’ in DC is embarrassing?
@adamjohnsonNYC These rich people and their circle jerk coffee klatches. Privatizing SocSec and charter school advocacy is the kind of dumb shit you believe has national appeal only if you spend all your time jacking off at Davos and the Aspen Ideas Festival with other soulless ghouls.
@daveanthony @dylanmatt Yeah, it's ridiculous - your country's form of governance is only valid when outside countries do not attempt to interfere in it is a no good, very dumb take.
@WhoFdTheStork I think Nielsen is thinking about putting more brown people in cages or what she’s having for dinner on her date with Stephen Miller tonight.
@lrozen I demand a short story collection about what each of these ghouls is thinking at the instant of this photo.
@VLuck having read the first book well before the show, Ned felt so much more noble. Once it got put on screen, though, he turns into a total buffoon.
@KhouryGarrett @AramShabanian If I was forced to put my name in a tracker like this, I would absolutely put the craziest name possible.
@daveanthony Look at Baghdad Becky over here...
@SenhorRaposa Can someone in the media please ask him why they didnt get around to passing this wall when they had total control of Congress? If this thing was such an emergency, why wasn't its passed on Day 1 of the Trump administration. Would have been better than trying the Muslim Ban.
@lukeoneil47 Can we figure out when she might actually do this so I can subsequently avoid this hellscape for 24-48 hours.  I’ll catch up afterwards.
@daveanthony We should get a collective veto on some people being allowed to have twitter accounts.
@dwdavison9318 Is Charlie a vegetarian too?  Why is a cow or chicken's heartbeat not important?  Or better yet, why is the heartbeat of people already born not important?
@robrousseau Sigh, the 'resistance' will eat this up and we will once again not allow any nuance of understanding of what class consciousness is and how to address the disparities in class that are destroying our country and the world. Any article on Davos should make people understand class.
@ashleyfeinberg So he went to a chiropractor?  And is now advising people to never go to a hospital?  Avoiding possibly life-saving medical treatment to own the libs.
@usawtfmJ1 @TheWTFNation OMG and it's a cross-cut, too.  You're going to need more than one sweep with teh vacuum cleaner.
@daveanthony No one really ever faced any consequences for Iran-Contra, Iraq, or torture under teh trope of "Let look forward, instead of looking back." That mindset fully endorses criminality and encourage each future Republican administration to push further and further on criminal actions.
@daveanthony Jesus holy mother of god! No Republican malfeasance ever gets punished or ever dies.  This is why a critical absolute platform of the '20 Dem nominee must absolutely be seeking criminal action against any and all illegalities perpetrated by the Trump administration.
@IAmKrishanPatel @jacobfhsmith Check out this delusional podcast appearance by crazy Travis Allen saying CA Repubs should go full MAGA 		When Paradise became hell by California Nation via #soundcloud https://t.co/Fi1gAEHeBT
@Michaelrm62968 It’s coming.  It’s only a matter of time Peter Thiel just cuts out the middleman and starts murdering young people for their blood.
@IwriteOK This is the correct move
@JustSchmeltzer isn't that every night when he watches hannity?
Just, holy fuck, how out of touch and clueless do you have to be to use a VR experience to understand a refugee's plight instead of, you know, going to actual refugee camps and talking to refugees!!! https://t.co/zVVLDlBGYl
@KeraRolsen Any good places to read up on what you are briefing/discussing?
@politicsluo @BruneElections He would President Pro Tempore under a Dem Pres and could retire in '22.
@S1Your @OfficersIsland I take pride in not bringing a pen.
@DrewVanDrese @politicsluo Whatever the unlike button is, I'm smashing it right now.
@daveanthony Going to be fun securing the oil platforms, err, humanitarian aid centers in Venezuela soon
@daveanthony Why do we keep doing this?  After the last decade, this shit needs to be justified publicly - instead of a SOTU, Trump should drag his fat ass on TV and explain this and then we should get to vote on this like the audience in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?
@mehdirhasan Isn't this about the oil?
@SenhorRaposa Has Meadows served in the minority?  He might not actually know that his opinion on bills in the House matters even less than the security guard not getting paid that lets him in the building every day.
@mattyglesias She barely mentions him in her book.  Just a brief discussion on how her parents met.  I gather she would like to know more too given how little she talks about any role he may have had in her life.
@robrousseau @AOC no he would absolutely write her like Selena Kyle in Vice.  Dumb, fumbling around, but he would absolutely never have her luck into the right answer.
@sgtjanedoe Furthermore, this moron just needs to look at any county precinct voting map in this are to see how typically a city this are is.
@sgtjanedoe I love here now and there is almost no part of Albany that compares to any other city.  Even Syracuse and Buffalo have more developed downtowns.  This “city” is almost entirely suburb and if you go five minutes in any direction, your in Trump territory.
@RPG_volley I've had that beer - your going to be fun now that (I assume) the kid is up.
@AutisticGamer3 @KyleKulinski No, sorry, I was trying to be generally sarcastic about lacking self awareness.  I would never allow Ann Coulter to determine my decisions, politically or otherwise.
@libbycwatson God almighty, he’s too lazy to do post production?  Even the Obama Bros cut into their chatter to do separately taped ad reads.
@KyleKulinski JFC.  Her President is literally kissing Ann Coulter’s ring by perpetuating his shutdown.  God grant me the ability to have this level of a lack of self awareness someday.
@daveanthony Another little nugget is that she was offered AG tonreplace Holder in 14 and said no because she wanted to keep working in CA.  She was running for Senate less than a year later
@daveanthony I just finished her book - she's for every progressive policy under the sun in in it, but doesn't even mention Mnuchin or her failure to prosecute him in any way.  I would think it would be something she would want to tackle to at least explain herself.  She just skipped it all.
@politicsluo @stephenesherman 538 did a really good retrospective on this last in 2017.  Article and podcast here: https://t.co/Qeww5feyFh
@daveanthony what's the best horse related sequence in an action movie? True Lies?  Something Else?
@NavalAirHistory @robrousseau I don't understand why you can't just revote on Brexit? (sorry, stupid American question).
@NavalAirHistory @robrousseau well played.
Paging @BillSimmons https://t.co/oTMfZoJXIx
I would absolutely enjoy a travel-logue of the Freshmen Dem Congressmen following Mitch McConnell around in perpetuity... https://t.co/r6i6FJEZD7
@daveanthony by the way, thanks for engaging.  Appreciate your thoughts and love your podcast.
@daveanthony are major issues.  Him believing Timothy Geithner was high on the list of his failures.
@daveanthony Didn't mean to imply BO was close to FDR.  FDR was a traitor to his class in a good way and fought through Republican obstruction.  Obama's popularity is based entirely in that he is a normal human being who doesn't serve fast food at White House functions.  Policy-wise there...
@daveanthony i guess the answer is to just not let Fox News set the agenda.  We complain about how they are a partisan news organization.  Let's finally admit it and not let its bloviation and scare tactics dictate progressive policy-making.
@ArmyStrang Sweet Patreon Money!
@daveanthony will there be any discussion of Right Wing acting in bad faith.  Media will only cover fake outrage and not the benefits of them.  Both LBJ and Obama got 2 years, passed their stuff and then right wingers came in on fake outrage and immediately started dismantling everything.
@daveanthony ...passed.  Right Wing attacked viciously -- the O-care thing was especially egregious because it hadn't even been put into affect in 2010.  The media will absolutely vomit up any coverage of bad implementation of MFA (remember the ACA website) and Green New Deal and never....
@daveanthony Dave, I agree, I was just thinking about this, though.  I'm worried, because say best case scenario we get Bernie and a Dem Congress in '20, pass MFA and infrastructure and other stuff.  There will be a backlash - look at post-Civil Right Act and what happened after O-care was...
@daveanthony It's amazing what some people will do to avoid gaining popularity. Imagine looking at grassroots enthusiasm and polling showing widespread support for progressive policies, and then saying, "I don't know if I want to be popular...."
@ChazNuttycombe considering the dummymander in NJ is contributing to nearly a third of the House Dem majority, I'll say it was NJ Republicans.
@JustSchmeltzer Wonderful, another British government falls.  Amazing that for pocket change, Russia has basically destroyed the democratic legitimacy of both the leading governments of the international system.
@daveanthony @ebruenig Don't forget the union crushing, too.  Eliminated a potential source of organizing against him.
@daveanthony @ebruenig yet the people of wisconsin still almost made him a 3-term governor.  How does this happen?
@MattGertz I hate Thomas Friedman - he is to blame for all of this type of dumb reporting.
Which asshole conservative pundit is going to be the first one to write the "McDonald's in the White House ceremony shows how much Trump is in touch with his base."?
@mehdirhasan @michelleinbklyn A competent Trump clone will be terrifying.  There is some Republican out there right now building to that end.
@jaredlholt It is for someone who doesn’t recognize the positive influence of our immigrant community especially in our culinary arts and traditions.
@GideonResnick God are those jazz hands?  He really has debased every tradition, dumb as some of them were.
@ckshowalter @dawg4life99 God I hope rat Steven Miller had to order this at a drive thru
@AthertonKD God how embarrassing.  This is a man with decades of foreign policy experience and this is the best he can do.  For god sakes man, be bold one way or anotthe other.  Don’t split the difference.
@aravosis God this fucking disgusting.  This asshole thinks this qualifies as a gourmet meal.  Probably took Melania to Arby’s for their anniversary.
@krakowianin91 I’ll always agree with that sentiment even if it’s only to build infrastructure in a losing race.  But looking at the numbers, Dems were probably spooked by Kyl’s big win in 94 in what was a Dem seat then McCains huge 98 win, not realizing he was an exception not a rule.
Lastly, here's the total average.  McCain's strength in his six races gives AZ a red hue that, just from the numbers, appears solely to him as being an Arizona institution.  He makes AZ appear an double digit R state in the Senate.  With him passing, AZ is way more competitive. https://t.co/lqA7m6zail
You can really see the effect of Goldwater/McCain on this seat.  Their strength probably moved viable challengers to the Class I seat.  Seat was R+22.7 in Pres Years and R+26.8 in mid-term years. https://t.co/KMGGi7q95c
Arizona's Class 3 Senate seat is not nearly as close as Class I. This is due to being a dynasty seat (until now it was only won by Barry Goldwater and John McCain). This seat peaked for Republicans with McCain winning in 2004 by 56 points. But it was below 10 point margin in '16. https://t.co/aGT9ChZiw8
@krakowianin91 my only guess is that Dems misunderstood a 14 point win by Kyl with a 30 point Rep swing as meaning Kyl was popular, when in fact adequate investment (as we are now seeing) would have made it closer.  I mean it was a split Senate state until the 94 election.
@stillhere_AZ But I will tell you that that's the seat held by Goldwater and McCain.  Percentages are going to way more Republican.
@stillhere_AZ I'm working on it.
Furthermore, this seat has been contested 3 times in Presidential years (76, 88, 12) and four times in mid term years (82, 94, 06, 18).  Dems win the seat by an average of 5 points in Pres year (small sample, I know), and Reps win by 2.3 points in midterm year.  Total avg: D+0.62 https://t.co/EIoSEcLbdg
AZ's Class 1 Senate seat (won this year by Kyrsten Sinema has been contested 7 times since 1976; Jon Kyl had no opponent in 2000).  Democrats have won the seat 4 times and Republicans 3.  Furthermore, outside of the massive 1994 shift, races for this seat have moved toward Dems. https://t.co/C9iD6rXwxB
@DrewVanDrese @joncprevo I just got done reading their national epic trilogy by Henryk Sienkiewiciz, translated by WS Kuncziak.  Highly recommended.
@robertmays oh jeezus and it's not like there't not playing the game until after sundown or anything either.  Yikes.
@ArmyStrang Translated: Charters schools may be for-profit enterprises, but the investors are only in it for the philanthropy, which explains why we pay our teachers shit and won't allow them to unionize.  Also, too we close the schools when they don't make enough money.
@JustSchmeltzer @jdawsey1 I mean is he just going to have Steve take a Secret Service Suburban into Northern DC to pickup 100 Happy Meals?
@AHotchchick People value you, don’t forget that.
@JustSchmeltzer What i don't get is why all politicians wouldn't broadcast this?  We demand politicians take measure to fix intolerable working conditions, politicians should do the same.  I just understand why it's taking AOC to complain about this?  Why wouldn't Brown? Kamala? Bernie? Warren?
@robrousseau This is amazing.  What can't happen in Florida?
@AndrewSolender @AOC @CBSNews I'm not saying a reporter without those backgrounds can't report on people from those backgrounds, but I think it's important.
@AndrewSolender @AOC @CBSNews But I will never truly understand being food insecure or being trapped in a failing school or having my house foreclosed upon or having my family members deported. And, as a result, I will never understand/be able to truly imbue in my character how those events made me who i am.
@AndrewSolender @AOC @CBSNews or as a women.  No amount of study or experience or embedding is ever going to make me be able to inculcate what those experiences were like or how those experiences inform my world view.  I can read a lot of books on topics that affect people of color, women, and poor people.
@AndrewSolender @AOC @CBSNews Andrew, I respect your viewpoint on this, however, I am a white man with blind spots about race and gender that I probably don't even know I have.  I grew up with a stable, safe home.  I would never have an understanding of what it took to grew up poor or a person of color.
@joshtpm other than showing up like Snowden in Moscow asking for asylum.
@geoffschwartz naaa, chief, that ain't it.  Let's have him beat better than a 6 seed at home.  He blew a 21-3 lead to Marcus Mariota at home a year ago!
As if we didn’t already know John Kelly was trash, here is Kamala Harris’s account of his response the night the first travel ban went into effect.  Apparently John thought the country being thrown into chaos and people who worked for him affecting that chaos was beneath him. https://t.co/WxwPTZf7iN
@TheWilderThings No he’s definitely the PE teacher.
@AHotchchick As a USC fan, said the same type of thing before the '09 season (after Sanchez left early) when USC was 82-9 since '02. Within a year, Carroll was gone, USC was on sanctions, and USC went seven season before making the Rose Bowl again.  late end 90s Miami ended quickly too.
@Doctrine_Man Apparently, Duncan Hunter, Eric Grietans, and Ryan Zinke were unavailable for comment.
@ChazNuttycombe Jennifer Wexton in Maddow!
@brianbeutler Given the increasingly clear links between Putin, far-right parties in Europe and Trump, perhaps we should examine if Grennell is there as a cut-out to coordinate between Putin and the AfD, working to weaken the German governing coalition.
@leonardpierce Famous people identify more with famous people than with how people view famous people.  They see themselves in his fall (regardless of the reason for it) and wonder what they would do if it would happen to them to be brought down.
@decunningham2 that's a bold move, cotton, we'll see if it pays off.
@dwdavison9318 I would argue that she knows exactly how the place works and that is why she is trying so hard to change it.
@jaredlholt They want her popularity without actually having to do anything of things that made her popular.  Surface level only, no internalization of the reasons for her popularity being based in the policy positions she holds.
@DrewVanDrese @politicsluo @ArtfulButler @SenhorRaposa Well, let Ojeda put his money where his mouth is - get appointed and see if you can win in WV.  Then let's start talking bigger.
@ActorAaronBooth plot twist - Senate.
@ArmyStrang @sgtjanedoe Yeah, I tried to access Mypay this morning from my work computer on a military network.  It still gave me that message.  It always does from inside a mil network or from my home computer.
@SenhorRaposa oh so NOW he wants to talk about multiplicative benefits of policy and wants us to believe him.  If he believes in that now, he should be back in TPP and the Iran Deal.
@lauraolin imagine attempting to get elected to Congress and getting legislation passed and policy enacted that reflects the will of the constituents who elected you.  The nerve of this women, honestly! /sarcasm
@MattGertz these people are obsessed with other people's genitals.  I don't understand.
@pptsapper yeah, I'm confused, are you guzzling it by the bucket or sipping it tastefully in fancy glass?
@IAmKrishanPatel @JonLBranning hah, that's the ticket. the problem is the LTGOV, not him.
@jaredlholt what a bunch of fucking babies
@jaredlholt @EsotericCD Conservos always wonder why people on the left are so bad about facts and evidence not mattering.  Here's why - Steve King has been racist for a long time.  You get no pats on the back for noticing it now when you couldn't avoid it any longer.
@jaredlholt @EsotericCD Would we not make fun of someone who thinks the world is flat despite all the evidence otherwise?  There was ample evidence of King's racism before, Jeff's efforts to normalize and ignore it do not mean that it did not exist.  It must be enjoyable to not have to confront this.
@jaredlholt Republicans are actively trying to kill people through legislation by taking their health care away and zeroing out their food assistance, but @EsotericCD wants people to be nice to people finally realizing that Steve King was blazing his racism bat signal for years.
@IAmKrishanPatel @HoppyKercheval @kkondik @Sen_JoeManchin @WVGovernor he doesn't give a shit about Democrats.  Although if he wins, he gets to appoint his replacement: Senator Ojeda anyone?
@BFriedmanDC @GOP @tarrantgop I mean this is probably a pretty good proxy of anti Muslim bigotry in the Republican party as a whole right - baseline is 25%, higher if no one was paying attention or there'd been a recent
@rudnicknoah IA-4, CA-50 and NY-27.  Low hanging fruit that could easily be picked off and build her power.
@mehdirhasan It’s over there....somewhere.  It has brown people...err it’s all the Middle East.  I hate myself for even making these jokes.
This is absolutely my new favorite thing.  On a more serious note, wasn’t the suspicion when the Rockets lost the Clippers in playoffs a couple of years back and harden played poorly that he had a concussion? https://t.co/tqeGTOoKEX
@SenhorRaposa one fake missile alarm and, voila, popularity
@labornvain @SalamiSwamiCA @daveanthony @matthewstoller OK, twitter isn't the best for making points (who's responding to which comment, etc.).  I agree with you.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota Especially since David would absolutely be tilting at windmills if some media figure reporting something about Bernie without context and then tried to claim that they were limited to a single 280 character tweet.
@labornvain @SalamiSwamiCA @daveanthony @matthewstoller No, I don't.  I hate reductive Republican reasoning about taxes and the services they pay for.  I actually like his suggestion here.  I was merely remarking that he was knocking down socialist strawmen last year and he's now making the same suggestions that the left makes.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota @MoneyInPolitics @KamalaHarris I know - context is important.  And his excuse was bogus.  And damn me for responding to you, my mentions are full of Sirota's followers now.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota @MoneyInPolitics @KamalaHarris Is David Sirota unaware of how to thread tweets?  Because that's what he's basically implying by saying he was limited to 280 characters.
@insidetroy @ThePeristyle i mean jesus, Dan Orlovsky should at least get a call.  He's stuff on TV has been really good lately.  Would rather get in on him now.  He will be an OC shortly.
@owillis nothing beats the Trump's T drilling Pence's p hole
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota @MoneyInPolitics @KamalaHarris @BernieSanders Again selective journalism in support of his preferred candidate.  Perhaps not as bad as Markos giving all those roses to Pelosi, but he's attempting to chum the waters with every post.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota @MoneyInPolitics @KamalaHarris @BernieSanders muting sirota has been my biggest achievement on this hell website to date.
@SalamiSwamiCA @daveanthony @matthewstoller concur. I like a lot of what he says, but I can't keep his stances straight anymore.  Is it pragmatic socialist? anti-capitalist? Anti-monopolist capitalist?
@cd_hooks fuck, he still talks like he's a backbench Congressmen from Kansas.  Just kill me.
@daveanthony @matthewstoller it's been fun to watch this guy transition to full blown socialism every week.
@SenhorRaposa i'm sure they're crushed.
@AndrewSolender @VanDrewForNJ I guess he voted no on having his picture included just like he voted No for Speaker.
@AndrewSolender @KamalaHarris She address this in her book.  It's #1
@Doctrine_Man @soonergrunt I understand, but the difference is key.  Sorry to be that guy picking nits but she is still a convicted criminal, which carries with it all the attendant restrictions on her future.
@MattGertz @dandrezner Jeezus, instead of people in his organization making fun of his small head, they should be destroying him for his dumb tweets.  Young Kim, anyone?
@SenhorRaposa yeah, I think the -02s (MO,IN,NC) are all in play in '20 with a good Dem candidate.
@soonergrunt @Doctrine_Man wasn't her sentence commuted?  She wasn't pardoned if I am reading all the articles correctly.
@SenhorRaposa missed opportunity in MO-2?
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman do you have her new book?  I'm 50 pages in myself.
Well, here is the first major Dem Prez candidate to do this.  cc: @SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @JMilesColeman https://t.co/rMHy74K6Q9
@geoffschwartz Can Giants get Rosen for just #5 pick or does there have to be another pick in there?  Given his injury history, #5 should be sufficient.
OK, so I just saw people asking where to donate grocery money to furloughed govt employees.  So we already had health care and burial costs by GoFundMe?  We're just going to do government by GoFundMe now too?
@agingerssoul The guys an asshole, always has been an asshole.  I think the Camp Fire was an area that voted heavily for him, too.  We’ve discovered what it’s like to have someone with zero human empathy as president.
@agingerssoul The worst part is that I believe the federal govt is responsible for management of over half of the forest area in CA.  I think I red somewhere that the Camp Fire did not occur on state managed property so this is an even more vindictive statement.
@Rabe9 @willmenaker Wait I thought Bari Weiss said there were no politics in Australia.
@ErikWemple @AJentleson FTW when a major media outlet now believes the basic functioning of our government is a bargaining chip.  There is normalization of the worst kind.
@JustSchmeltzer It's amazing how he's side-stepped any serious accountability.  I mean what the most serious backlash he's faced for the last decade of his attacks on democratic norms?  Getting called Cocaine Mitch? Once had his dinner interrupted?
@SenhorRaposa If we've reach the point that any what was essentially a random white Republican in Missouri, we're long past that point in Alabama.  In fact, they could probably run a stock photo pasted to a 2x4 and Republicans will still vote for him in a general election.
I am so here for every moment of apoplexy that AOC causes every conservative. They are obsessed with her. https://t.co/5hbuUg8we1
@usawtfmJ1 @CJ_usawtfm @WTF_Judge @SNAFU_Sara I think the problem is she is ADOS?  She gets whatever BAH is in effect at the time her orders start.  So it will go down in 1 Jan if her orders cycle.  If Sara was on orders starting on 1 October, her BAH should absolutely not change until her current orders run out.
@SenhorRaposa Was there a more destructive to small-d democratic norms in recent history than these group of legislators?
@SenhorRaposa I just don't understand - who the hell do these assholes think a Democrat is going to vote for?  A Republican?
@grace_panetta she's on cocaine, isn't she?
@ArmyStrang I totally forgot about this movie. This is going to be awesome!
@geoffschwartz Geoff, they could quash this by simply showing how often other prior offenders like Reid get tested.  Release facts and then people will shut up. Being opaque about things only hurts them.  How many times did Lane Johnson get tested this year?  Did he get tested 10 times?
Where do I apply for the job where the NY Times job that allows me to charge the paper for my vacations with the only requirement to write vapid, uninformed op-eds about the country I visit?
@sophcw I visited for a conference in 2008 (flew in around ANZAC Day) and I remember the political situation THEN was crazy because of a migrant crisis of people coming onto the northern coast on boats.  I imagine it's only gotten worse. How many Prime Ministers have they gone through?
@PoliticsWolf The president's responsibility to ensure his government his executive agencies are open and operating is apparently not the overarching concern of the AP.  Fact checks can go away now.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @PNWwonk okay good news, sometimes you don't realize when someone disappears on here.  Well, except for Cameron.  We all know why Cameron disappered.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel Whatever happened to Andrew Damitio?  I just realized I hadn't seen anything from him in awhile and complete misssed if something happened?  What happened?
@jonathanvswan @daveweigel Pompeo, ever the reliable boot polisher and lick spittle.  He didn't have to say anything.  Instead he looks like a teacher's pet (I know, that's what he's trying to do, but it's still pathetic).
@ArmyStrang I was an ARNG recruiting company commander for two years.  I've never met a bigger bunches of squares in my whole life.  I didn't help matters, but they were all huge dorks.
@emptywheel I would argue the four network heads are higher on the list than Cuomo. They knew what was going to happen and they still ran it.
@aoxaMaxoa @emptywheel what kind of property tax break do you think CNN Tower has in NYC?  Who gets that taken care of?  Chris's brother, the governor of NY.
@daveanthony it's damn pathetic, because they cheer people  starting companies like Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and Tesla, never questioning that the people in charge of those organizations aren't prepared to run them. But they will absolutely stan an experience/seniority argument for AOC.
@daveanthony Does anyone want to tell him that's it's probably going to come to that anyway?
@jaredlholt I know he hates it, but I (and I'm sure dozens of others) leave a Krassenstein related comment in his timeline.  It's dumb but always bring a smile to my face.
@daveweigel Jeezus - this is worst tease for a WWE Triple Threat match of all time.
@DrewVanDrese see elsewhere on twitter: Trump can only go eight minutes before sniffing because after that the Adderall he snorted starts dripping back out of his nose.
@rudnicknoah more of this Noah - if CA GOP can be run by Travis Allen, VA GOP can't be any worse with Corey Stewart.  Maybe they'll do it.
@JMilesColeman @JenniferBoysko @RepWexton Wow!  I was hoping she'd manage to win every precinct, and she nearly did!  What were the differences in the two red precincts?
@ActorAaronBooth @JMilesColeman holy jesus, 40 points?  I saw @ChazNuttycombe I think say this district has a high population of federal workers who are probably not getting paid right now.  That would make sense, combined with us still being in the after effects of November.
@ActorAaronBooth @JMilesColeman what did J.Wex win this by?
@SenhorRaposa Missouri values a lickspittle who will take away their health insurance and broke campaign finance laws to facilitate his victory.
@rudnicknoah i think it was inevitable once Markos started SB Nation - he started having to make ruthless business decisions about aggregation and not paying writers, so it couldn't help but be more conservative as the other parts of life affect his thought processes.
@JustSchmeltzer @jayrosen_nyu @brianstelter @mlcalderone he successfully gamed the system.
I mean I understand the point of the response of all three of these people, but can't the Dems come up with someone other than a white person older than 70. https://t.co/wfMlhYpaJD
These Never-Trump assholes who jizzed in their pants for the Iraq War with WMD rhetoric can just skip their pathetic tweets about Trump's upcoming demagoguery on TV tonight.  Just take a knee, we don't need your opinion
@mitchellreports Well, it sure would be nice if, you know, we had an ambassador in place to arrange things like this.  Too bad the last one left in October 2017!
@BenScionti I see we've officially entered the 'Joe Manchin lobs grenades at all Dem candidates' phase of election season.  How 'bout this, Joe?  You're not running again, stand up for your party and convince your state what policy points key Dem pres candidates are important for your state?
@politicsluo the free marketplace of ideas has spoken.  Although it would really be nice for him to cost VA GOP another Senate or Gov race first.
@SenhorRaposa huh?  I wonder if he's joining to poison pill it.  Or if he's mad he didn't get immediately nominated to replace Mattis.
@politicsluo what in your estimation is the reason that the GOV difference has moved D+6.5 since '06, but R+4 since '08?
@rockrichard To be fair, he would have sent the same tweet with the teams switched if you had one.
@politicsluo what's the corresponding overlay at the presidential level?
@ProFootballTalk Jesus, I knew this article was coming, but even I was not prepared for it to actually happen.  Let's highlight how the #1 seed in the AFC's coach's worst trait is actually not the Achilles heel every sane person knows it is.
@charlie_simpson he wholly redeems himself if he does a video calling the actual Michael Bolton a no talent ass-clown.
@kenklippenstein Why does everyone of these morons insist on responding on Twitter to get further dragged.  Just take your beating and move on.  It’s like they believe that they are above criticism.
@ParkerMolloy Jesus.  Don’t we have more than 10000 hours of experience in this matter.  By all means let’s study the facts more.  Maybe they’ll change.
@daveanthony Cool so this idiot’s line of reasoning is why we still have to take our shoes off at the airport.
@ddiamond @nycsouthpaw @MikeIsaac Dave Chang did that a couple of times in the fall already on his Ringer podcast.  The William Goldman tribute BS did was also well over 2 hours, too

Can anyone tell me why the hell the Sergeant Major of the Army gets to be out of uniform at all these official events? I mean this is getting worse than the beret fiasco.

@ProFootballTalk hey look, Pete Carroll stanning an O-Coordinator underperforming.  USC from 05-09 cannot relate.
@ArmyStrang God go with you my friend.
Can anyone tell me what the fuck this means? https://t.co/pDqyM7zPrx
@SteveFryer It does give you a unique perspective to do just that.  To build the trust to be around long enough to see the kids of players.  I just remember how old I felt when Mark Sanchez (who was one of the SMCHS ballboys) was winning all those games at MV.  And I was still in my 20s!
@IAmKrishanPatel @CAGOP love this continuing GOP saga - we failed with a Trumpy candidate who couldn't attract all those No Party Preference former Republicans, so let's make the head of the party an even more Trumpy asshole.  That's a bold strategy, I'm sure it'll pay off.
@SteveFryer Love this viewpoint - just to make you feel old (sorry), I was reading you in 94-98 when I was in HS (played for Santa Margarita under Jim Hartigan).
@IAmKrishanPatel Mark Cuban has been blessed by his money to have never had to understand the differences between Republicans and Democrats and, more importantly, their voters.  A privilege only a rich person can enjoy.
@SteveFryer steve, really impressed you responded.  Never had someone write back to me like, especially someone as well known (read: famous) as you.
@SteveFryer Ok, can agree with that, as long as he can stop defining other athletes by their worst moments (see Baker Mayfield alcohol arrest).
@SteveFryer Steve, first off, I love your coverage and grew up with it. I'm glad Doug apologized, but sometimes a person's actions invalidate them having an opinion on things. Doug's actions at ND unfortunately do not allow him to pontificate on kids having to repay scholarships.
@JustSchmeltzer they need to so this no matter what Chuck agreed to Mitch with.
@GottliebShow @SteveFryer @Aground33Andy have you paid back your scholarship money from Notre Dame yet?
@ParkerMolloy wait i thought the whole weekend RW twitter was claiming no conservatives were actually outraged.  Jim Hoft missed the coordination memo?
@IAmKrishanPatel Not a dig, Krishan (Hell, i was only 12).  But the establishment politicians and press were so strong back then, that they beat back Jerry even though we know they hated Bill.  They didn't like anyone going against the conventional wisdom, and they had power to make that happen.
@IAmKrishanPatel Krishan I remember this period well. People viewed Jerry like they did Bernie in 16. As an outsider attempting to upset to apple cart with less votes. In 92, Jerry was considered crazy still by establishment (which was stronger), and didn't have the great credentials of 10-18 yet
@ProFootballTalk rooting for the eagles to win SB again so we can watch Philly combust in hot takes about who their QB should be in the time between then and the draft.
@ArmyStrang @disco_socialist I don't get it.  The entire premise of both this show and his first one (Home Improvement) was his wife, kids, neighbor, and/or co-workers preventing him from making buffoonish mistakes that dumb, uneducated men stereo-typically make. Why he continue to debase himself?
@daveanthony the last cry for civility from the uber-rich.  Cuban's not dumb, he sees what's coming and is attempting to wave off the anger.  Given how crappily he's run his team since 2011, he probably should have the team confiscated.
@AHotchchick This MF'er has the gall to talk about listening to everyone while he ignored sexual harassment/assault in his own organization and willingly enabled the perpetrator. I'm sure he was fully cognizant of people's opinion about that.
@bomani_jones I mean the guy should be applauded.  He missed 11 kicks, 5! of those times he hit an upright.  That's amazing!
love everyone piling on AOC's $21 trillion claim.  Did Glenn Kessler ever give GWB four Pinocchio's for Mission Accomplished or claiming Iraq had WMD?  What's that? No?  OK, let's move on then. https://t.co/Mwcp6HBegC
@PaulSzoldra FTW when you embrace full on tyranny and a military dictatorship!
@AndrewSolender Jerry was a golden candidate that can't be repeated.  He has a long history with CA and had been Gov before and delivered results for Latinos in CA. Newsom is still relatively unknown.  I mean Brown only won in '10 by 13 points overall.  Give Newsom some time.
@TheAtlantic @marinakoren cool, China reached 1968.
@EricBoehlert This better get fixed, especially since we will have 3 years of policy disasters (giant budget deficit, overblown defense budget, kids in cages, asylum, travel ban, trade war, etc.) on which to examine Trump's policies. Or they spend time on how the candidate responds to Tlaib.
@hilzoy YES! Jim Hoft has logged in with his ever important opinion.  I knew he'd have a quality, measured opinion grounded in fact.  /sarcasm
@daveanthony Fuck, I've never meant anyone who went my a nickname in college and then used a more formal name for professional reasons later on.
@AndrewSolender The man should be a dark cell underneath The Hague.  The sheer number of people that excuse the torture program brought about almost solely by Cheney's force of will is mind-numbing.  This is THE stain on America and Cheney caused it.
@DannyBKelly As a USC fan, wholeheartedly endorse this.  Carroll got in the way of winning every year after Leinart, Bush, White left.
@minakimes Jay novachek was really the pinnacle
@jacko2323 SONNY!!! FTW!!!
@NateSilver538 today's response to the Tlaib impeachment comments shows what would happened if we removed polling from political horse-race coverage.  Everybody with forum would be spouting off on what everything means without any actual evidence/polling to back it up.
@FPWellman @MeghannReports @USARECPAO @USArmyLABN Between this and the British recruiting adds attacking millennial stereotypes, is everyone going to just act like Trump now?
A huge sickout by TSA employees at Reagan National, Dullas, and BWI on 18 January (the next time Congress convenes for a home work week) would end the shutdown.
@jackcurran49 Having a tough time seeing how acknowledging the existence of Palestine is anti-semitic.  Having issues with the way Israel treats Palestinians is not the same as being anti-Semitic.  If we tie those things together, there's literally no position in opposition to Israel.

@SenhorRaposa Love when backbencher bemoan "politics" - what job did he think he signed up for. And he just ran for re-election?  It's not like he didn't know.
@SenhorRaposa Jesus, when the alternate is Tom Cotton, I'll take someone like Webb all week and twice on Sunday.
@politicsluo you would think if anyone would support that it would be Scalise.
@EricKleefeld Says something that he's for this punching, but not for punching Nazis, doesn't it?
It is my absolute goal in life be as hated by anyone as much as people on the right hate Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez https://t.co/yT3qCyefvm
@PenguinOfTroy I was just hoping we'd get through one season before we started having to give him pay raises.
@EricKleefeld the sad part is that at least half of that is people who think he wasn't Trumpy enough
@puckthepilot didn't helicopters fly SEALs over the wall on Bin Laden's compound?
@JustSchmeltzer True, it's all a giant grift.  I wonder how long before his toilet company gets a contract to replace all the toilets at DOJ?
@AN_Goldstein Andrea, I think it's the same reason that the top presidential corruption scandal of all time is not Iran-Contra instead of Watergate. We don't acknowledge screw-ups in our foreign/military policy. Similarly, why isn't our screw-ups in Afghan-Pakistan since the 80s more covered.
@vagrunt Just god, we should force dumbasses like this to do reading assignments - this guy gets Ghost Wars by Steve Coll.
@JustSchmeltzer I believe they were for sagging balls guys who hang low, so to speak
Marty Funkhouser and Mean Gene on the same day.  I'll reup my earlier comment, 2019 already sucks worse than 2018.
So was there a formal ceremony where Flake officially passed the “Useless Senator Crticisim of Trump” hat over to Romney?  My guess is it looks like a nerf basketball hoop so he  can get relentlessly dunked on for each pointless utterance.
Just shoot me, 2019 already sucks worse than 2018.
This is so awesome - I had Romney Family Feud in the office pool!!!
@JustSchmeltzer He's begging already and she's not officially the Speaker until tomorrow?  This is going to be fantastic!
@JMilesColeman Do you have a loyalty comparison of Poizner vs. De Leon?  Would be interested to see how closely the blue red divide matches even though there was no R in either race.
@geoffschwartz The problem for the Pac12 football is its two best coaches in the last 20 years both left for the NFL.  And that they allowed their best team to get knee-capped by the NCAA, when the SEC/B10 would never let Alabama or OSU get taken down by sanctions. Even the ACC protected Miami.
@EricBoehlert Imagine if she stopped and gave quotes every time.  She’d be criticized for being a media glory hog, always looking for the nearest microphone.
@daveweigel Dave it’s the only life anyone of Twitter lives.
@RubenGallego @Bencjacobs Today in terrible historical analogies.
@BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa @openelex I mean I know they have it for All federal and state legislative seats because they go to the bother of breaking out those results by county partials for all those races.  So they give us the sum, it wouldn’t be hard to show us the math, so to speak.
@fawfulfan So he doesn’t understand that if the government were run by the people of the rich window he wouldn’t get anything about a 2nd Amendment to hang on to?
@FPWellman Ahh, so they handed over the feed to Dinesh this week?
@BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa @openelex Yeah but that data has public interest.  It should be freely available.  If it already exists and is a record of how localities are voting, it’s in the public’s interest to be able to access it free of charge.
@SenhorRaposa God they are awful.  You have no idea how much I get discouraged trying to do rudimentary analysis.  At least their state/federal level County results are in excel.
@SenhorRaposa CA Dems have to be up there just going perfect in every state and congressional race.  Especially since Newsom didn’t seem to help in OC where so many of the races were won.
@politicsluo Not according to be twitter mentions after I responded to a Nate Silver post pointing out the objective fact that Bernie is not a Democrat.
@S1Your Wow I’m impressed by your ambition.  I hope to be as ambitious one day.
@S1Your @sgtjanedoe Oh there was definite fuckery.  That S3 was a fill in because they had to make the real one a battalion commander.  He did not get credit for that assignment, I’ll leave it at that
@S1Your @sgtjanedoe Something like this already happened to me in front of an Asst SecArmy.  I was burning both ends at a mob station.  My S3 took a picture of me sleeping at my desk after lunch one day, then put it in the next morning BUB.  He didn’t check that an SES level civilian wasn’t present.
@LOLGOP Isn't this guy an IRA car bomb apologist?
@S1Your ahh, but the key question is whether you are essential or non-essential personnel?
@encbarbero @JustSchmeltzer @JillWineBanks Well this would align with his propensity for taping conversations (remember GET ME A COKE!).  He keeps stuff like these phones because he's transactional and knows the phones hold value, even as what is essentially a fancy GPS tracker.
@SenhorRaposa naa that's not it - Ned Lamont FTW
@AN_Goldstein the best part is watching Arnold, a supposedly ageless cybernetic organism aging over the course of the movies.
@AN_Goldstein of course they did.  Meanwhile men are still allowed to grow the dumbest mustaches.
@AN_Goldstein also, as an academy grad, I wholeheartedly endorse anything that brings us down a notch.  Some of us are REALLY annoying.
@JustSchmeltzer @JillWineBanks Yeah, how many phones registered to Cohen were confiscated on the raid on his office/hotel room.  Was one of those phones the same phone?  Cohen was in on everything - would not be surprised if Dumbass Jr thought he'd be in the clear by taking Cohen's phone.
@AN_Goldstein You never seen Terminator?????  The sacrilege.
@AN_Goldstein Dumb man answer: As long as you keep getting your nails done to complement/match the stone in the ring, I think you're good.
@vagrunt What does that mean?  She’s obnoxious?  She like to cite useless facts?  I’m lost.
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 Because we desperately need urgent action in ‘21 and we need a team.  Some people will have to move left to do it and some people will have to move right to do it (if only a little).  Then we start building victories and building momentum for 8 years.
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 He’ll have to find a way get the policy aims he desires through the prism of our current political alignment.  If he can heave-ho Schumer, I’m all in, but he can’t lob grenades at all the Dems in Congress or he’s going to face a lot of resistance.
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 I hundred percent agree with you friend, policy matters.  I’m frightened to death about climate change and what it means for my kids.  I will vote for Bernie if he’s the nominee, but he’s got to build a coalition of people who are already serving.  They’ll be there on 1/3/21.
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 Cool, man throw them overboard and see what gets passed with a 60R-40D Senate.  We have to accept that there is room for them until more to the left candidates can get elected in more places.  Continue to pressure (more Green New Deal type shifts) and work on campaign finance.
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 Bernie took money from Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Kaiser Permanente.  Is he able to withstand the influence of their money in his policy making?
@AndrewSolender @RichardDreyfuss Bad facial recognition?  Although weren’t they in What About Bob? Together
@u4eahh @NateSilver538 AOC is, Lee Carter is, Ihlan Omar is, Ayanna Pressley is, Katie Porter is, Tammy Duckworth is, Jon Tester is, Tim Kaine is, the party contains multitudes.
@SheaSerrano Binge Mode/Rewatchables Mash-up.  Every F&amp;F Movie on consecutive days until the series is done.
@ashleyfeinberg Isn't this picture where a couple of patches are pro-Nazi?
@S1Your although the DD93 things - 100% agree with you on that.  I point generally in the direction of several E6s sitting in the outer office.  They get the hint.
@S1Your YouTube?  I have an iPAD playing all three Lord of the Rings movies all day.
@northwestraven1 @drewskki1 @NateSilver538 Well, he did take a leadership role in the Senate Caucus this year, although I disagree with his shenanigans in the VT Dem Senate primary (running as Dem, then declining so now Dem could potentially run against him).
@laflemm12 @drewskki1 @NateSilver538 It wasn't a hit on Bernie, I was merely pointing out a fact.  That may make him better in your view, but don't discount the fact that it bothers a significant number of people (based on polling right now) who are registered democrats and work hard for the party.
@drewskki1 @NateSilver538 Right, but maybe not to people are ARE democrats.
@NateSilver538 he's still not a Democrat.
@jkass99 Haa, before my brigade deployed in '04, we got a class on how to set up a TCP from an MP company.  The class was given to the entire battalion at once.  Quality stuff.
@joncprevo oh hell, if i was minimum wage Amazon factory worker with no health care, I would definitely do this when packing stuff just to freak people out.
@FPWellman @barefootboomer S1 Army: trying to figure out what the alternate AFCT event to the leg tuck is.
@soonergrunt @JaninSpoor cod pieces and shoulder pads.  Why are Republican presidents so fixated on fake masculinity?  It's almost like they are compensating for some physical and/or mental shortcoming.
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman would definitely follow in picking Senators from Blue states (Harris, Cortez-Masto, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, Duckworth, Bennet, Warner, Booker, Warren) to rebuild the executive branch.
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman In the running for AG or Interior under Harris/Beto/Sanders/Klobuchar?
@saulnewton @AlexanderMcCoy4 and that officer would be on the front page of Breitbart, Daily Caller, and Drudge with headlines "OBAMA POLITICIZES THE MILITARY!!!!!!"
@pptsapper @ArmyStrang I don't know what's worse, him having that hat or him trying to pass some shitty PX hat off as a MAGA hat.
@dwdavison9318 Gottleib's got that old-school Orange County (CA) conservative 'hate the poors' mentality.
@dwdavison9318 Gottleib transferred to escape credit card fraud at Notre Dame! I don't recall him having to pay back anything. You can attend 2 years(!) of any US military academy for free. As long as you leave before classes start your junior year, there is no requirement to pay anything back.
@LadyLovesTaft In 2003, we transited the major Big Island (HI) training area (PTA) through Kona airport.  We had just spent 10 days in the field firing hundreds of rounds of artillery. TSA proceeded to do those explosive residue swipe tests on everyone's ruck sack. That was some wild shit, too.
@MSMollinedo The media is so desperate for any patina of normality.  It’s literally the least he can do.  And it took him almost 2 years.
@zeigler4presid1 They should have a canister of Agent Orange in the background too.  Would bring the picture (and hypocrisy) together.
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman That job is hers for as long as she wants it right?
@BryantJordan @FPWellman Yeah I agree with that.  Presence was mandated.  Violating UCMJ was optional.  But where were the commanders and senior NCOs to quash this shit?
@PenguinOfTroy We’re going to get extra time in this awful game aren’t we?
@MichaelStahlke Stand up for beliefs in the face of verbal abuse, coward.  John Lewis got his skull fractured by a pipe in Selma and he’s afraid of bad words.  Lol.
@PenguinOfTroy Lol, below Doritos for sure.  Combos too.
@ActorAaronBooth Spot on Aaron.  Would gather there’s a large portion that have no idea who Harris or Klobuchar are.
@PenguinOfTroy Well USC shouldn’t be playing in any bowl named after a second tier snack.
@S1Your @usawtfmJ1 what shop do you think that officer with the trump flag violating UCMJ is in?  How much paper is this going to be?  Jeezus, what a moron. https://t.co/FxTwKA2Us2
@DanteAtkins Unless they work In the oil and gas industry and give money to Beto
@KrangTNelson @KenTremendous Man is a stretch right?  Doesn’t he wear diapers?
@SykesCharlie I hate it because both sides are not leaving a road back.  They are tearing up any bridge between them.  And it’s being done completely independently of anything either guy said.  The first one of then to tell their side to turn ire to other side is the smartest politically.
@H250U @LadyLovesTaft I prefer ‘SHAMRS1’
@FPWellman They got told they had to be there right?
@JMilesColeman I know no one likes them, but a map that sizes the blue or red by number of votes would show this even better
@USAWTFM_PAO 100% some asshole field grade or GO told everyone in that picture that they had to wear that gear to get in the picture.
@Never_ @JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota He's getting more annoying. Every hour is another tweet where he is responding to Twitter shit.  I understand what he is doing, why he is doing it, and sympathize with his points. However, there is more Sirota in my timeline than news posts.  It's too much - had to mute.
Wherein an American finds it safer to deploy to a war zone than to go to a concert or a restaurant in America. https://t.co/WNsPWDp6Lt
Love that Beto and Bernie supporters on Twitter pointing out legitimate issues with the opposites' records is basically making supporters of one side completely unable to support the other candidate.  Twitter sucks.
@IAmKrishanPatel @priaribi @TVietor08 @katieporteroc I forgot about PSA.  I was super impressed with her background and the work she had done previously.  I don't know why she wouldn't be pushed as a future leader of House Banking Committee.
@IAmKrishanPatel @priaribi @TVietor08 Krishan did you listen to @katieporteroc on Ezra Klein Show?  She was great.
@IAmKrishanPatel Have fun Krishan
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota Yeah, I don't understand why he doesn't just chill - Sirota's turning into Kaitlin Bennett, just posting to get people mad.  Totally a winning strategy that won't backfire at all when he's trying to figure out why people won't unite behind Bernie next year.
@robrousseau And they didn't even care as he got Alzheimer's and stumbled his way through the Iran-Contra illegality and was clearly taken advantage of.  Oh, and let Nancy and an astrologer run the White House.
@ArmyStrang What makes it more annoying is that CM had a ready-made way to attack Hawley (him leading the anti-Obamacare lawsuit while support pre-existing conditions), plus what turns out was illegal campaign finance stuff.  And she still couldn't win.
RT @MikeDrucker: Guys https://t.co/oYSCSXqhcx
@ArmyStrang I loved this movie-I saw it right after I got back from Iraq in '05 (after reading the book at the beginning of the tour in '04). I thought it brilliantly captured the ultimate futile nature of the military, training and training and training and never doing it. (Haysbert scene).
@JustSchmeltzer @SenSchumer Someone get Nancy over there, stat!
@ActorAaronBooth Lindsay up for re-election in 2020.  He'll be wearing a MAGA hat in the Capitol by Memorial Day.
@jbview @ballotpedia Yeah, I saw it there first.  They also started Triplex (when Gov, AG, and SOS) are all the same party.
@jbview Blame @ballotpedia. They started it.
@XOofXOs @steven_metz Hell, I wouldn't have made it past noon on day 1.  I have a four day pass starting tomorrow and will have a beverage in had for the 12PM EST kick of whatever bowl game is on tomorrow.
@JustSchmeltzer @jdawsey1 Someone will have ads up with this on TV soon right?
@ryanlcooper Holy shit, @ryanlcooper frame this!
@mehdirhasan Thank, @mehdirhasan.  Agree with this wholeheartedly.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota And I believe it falls in-line with progressive values.  Progressive values of humanitarianism don't end at our shores.  There is a fundamental issue that the left will have formulate a coherent strategy that fuses their domestic values with how to prevent humanitarian disasters.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota Furthermore, the effects of this are going to cause major issues.  There is going to be a deepening of a humanitarian crisis.  In addition, we are abandoning Kurds who have fought by our side since 1991.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota Eric this is exactly what my response is.  I agree with the end state, but the scaffolding that built this decision is important.  Why is Trump doing this and what is the decision process used to make it?  Was he offered something?  Is he attempting to get Erdogan to lay off S.A?
@JoePlenzler @LeoShane F’ing catastrophe.  Love that a dude with no military experience beyond company command and being a rather backbench Senator will now be running one of the largest organizations in the world.
@JoePlenzler @LeoShane This is totally going to Cotton.
@Cianaf @LeBatardShow was saying today that he hoped someone would say this so that the ensuing response would educate people about the difficulties of mental illness.   Leave it to Steven A to be the guy.
@S1Your @SNAFU_Sara It's a trap!
@MazMHussain And instagram with its own DM feature.
@JordanUhl Oh sweet god and baby Jesus!
@soonergrunt @jaketapper @jackshafer @POLITICOMag How many of these media scolds writing against this boycott would join a media pile on if CAIR advertised on Maddow or something dumb like that?
@FPWellman She also forgets the Bergdahl and Manning are both convicted criminals.
@usawtfmJ1 You will have to fight me for it!
@daveanthony Cool, Applebee's can decide whether women should access birth control based on corporate personhood, but they don't have the capacity to determine whether something is racist?  Fun take, sure it won't cause any issues or cognitive dissonance for Nate down the road.
@RogerMisso I used to say the same thing about USC football and other teams in CA.  This year we lost to Stanford, Cal and UCLA.
@JustSchmeltzer She can count.  Far better than repubs.  Far better than Trump.  I told you trying to throw her over the side was a bad idea.
@UrbanAchievr I'm confused - he's talking about the Obama Administration that wasn't an Administration any more at the time Flynn lied to the FBI?
@robrousseau I guess we won't get IHOP's heel turn as the white nationalist restaurant https://t.co/dIStmm4SbJ
@MikeObach @S1Your @usawtfmJ1 always happy to help.  Keep NY in mind if you ever want to come back to the ARNG/dark side
@eisingerj @nhannahjones It's the same conservative industrial complex/gravy train philosophy that allows a magazine as demonstrably destructive and wrong as The Weekly Standard to continue to exist until this year.
@Roellinfusco @robrousseau I know change is hard.  No one likes change unless of course the alternative is a fiery hellscape of flooded coastal areas, massive continuous wildfires, and massive famine.
@rudnicknoah @SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel This guy is going to run president, isn't he? https://t.co/jqhqiTpuu3
@robrousseau Pinker thinks everything is getting better.  Probably thinks Miami sinking into the ocean just offers a chance for more development and increases opportunities for more beach front property.
@MikeObach @S1Your @usawtfmJ1 I just called the HRC desk responsible for your type of action (502-613-6300).  They said that as long as your Security Clearance and Physical are not expired it should take longer than a month or so.
@daveanthony All those words essentially mean, "DO NOTHING".  Radical Centrism is essentially a stance for keeping things the way they are.  Although given the thesis of his last book, Pinker probably thinks the climate is going fine.  I suggest he be forced to live on the Marshall Islands.
@S1Your @MikeObach @usawtfmJ1 Mike, if you're talking about retiree recall, it usually takes 90-120 days.  HRC requests that all requests be submitted NLT 90-120 days before a scheduled tour, so it shouldn't be any longer than that.  How far along in the day count are you?
@mtsw @jbouie I wonder what they would say when they found out there are Starbucks on a large majority of military posts.
@robrousseau @IHOP Would be a major plot twist if they subbed in ‘golden pancakes’ for ‘white people’
@PopulismUpdates I just don't understand.
@EoinHiggins_ FBI is a lot like the military - once you climb that high in the bureaucracy, you start to believe that people actually like to hear you pontificate on everything.  High ranking delusion.
@tonyposnanski I remember when he attacked Lis Wiehl on air for disagreeing with his view on some BS or another and shut off her mic.  No spin, indeed.
@BA_Friedman Relentless Strike by Sean Naylor was pretty good.  Especially the fusion of operational to tactical.
@EricKleefeld Liberty University
@MSMollinedo Ben Shapiro must be mad that he got passed over for Chris Kyle, who is dead.
@TylerDinucci Did they put Chris Kyle in this photo?  They put a dead guy in this montage meaning they couldn’t find 8 hot living conservatives, lol!
@usawtfmJ1 @WTF_Judge @CrispinBurke @AndrewGreenzone @SecArmy I just don’t understand.  We’ve created uncountable number of systems to display every bit of data, yet I still have to create a memo for you to validate what SIDPERS or ATRRS or IPERMs or RCAS or RLAS already say.  GTFO!
@usawtfmJ1 @WTF_Judge @CrispinBurke @AndrewGreenzone @SecArmy No more extra memos or documents when we have so much paper to begin with.
@usawtfmJ1 @WTF_Judge @CrispinBurke @AndrewGreenzone @SecArmy I hate extra paper for no reason.  I have a former ARNG officer trying to go uSAR demanding the officer prove his commissioning source (state OCS).  His federal recognition of appointment document proves he met the requirement to be a 2LT.  His ORB also says he was OCS grad.
@WTF_Judge @usawtfmJ1 @CrispinBurke @AndrewGreenzone @SecArmy The LES requirement is bad. Use the UCFR-that’s the command teams validation of leave balances. Furthermore i wouldn’t care if the Soldiers request took them negative.  Their choice. I would inquire but allow if leave was to fly somewhere. If they are at negative then deny.
@WTF_Judge @usawtfmJ1 @CrispinBurke @AndrewGreenzone @SecArmy ARNG is paperless.  Electronic DA31s with digital signatures.  When signed back in leave is processed they DFAS.
@jackcurran49 Ok now do how they voted in ‘18 as well😀
@usawtfmJ1 @CrunchyOldDawg @S1Your More likely the bn cdr is a jerk and doesn’t want to expend Capital/look bad with his boss for waiting too late to get the ARCOM approved.  Or the BDE cdr is a jerk and won’t even consider it late.  Or probably both.
@TomMcCuin @usawtfmJ1 @S1Your I was a recruiting co cdr in the Guard.  Our career recruiters always got at least ARCOMs when they retired.  Many got MSMs.
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra Get used to it.  These clowns getting appointed now are going to be striking down all sorts of New Deal/Great Society Program’s over the next 20 years.
@DO4Vets @usawtfmJ1 @CrispinBurke @S1Your Yeah anyone can recommend an award.  I’ll be happy to get an ARCOM approved for this guy.  ARCOM just needs to be approved by an O6.
@usawtfmJ1 @S1Your It would actually increase the value of this trash award if it were written in crayon.
@usawtfmJ1 @S1Your Jeezus, how does this happen?  How do you let your BN CDRs ass hang out like this?
@S1Your @usawtfmJ1 good god.  We really need to ramp up our game here.  King Useless is in our yard. https://t.co/59a1A0uVUk
@SenhorRaposa @LPDonovan Isn't this just Kyl giving a huge FU to the Repubs?  I know he was a placeholder, but not sticking around until this point in 2020 really makes this a difficult hold in '20.
@NormOrnstein The next administration must act to prosecute Kelly and Nielsen for their actions.  We can’t not have an accounting for this.  We did that with the Iraq war and torture and it only emboldened Republicans to further depravities.
@Popehat The man was a F*cking 3-star general.  He would have absolutely destroyed a subordinate who lied to him.  He knows better.  So WSJ will excuse any level of misconduct in an effort to shield the president and his circle from any consequences or even being held to any standard.
@seungminkim @SenJoniErnst Jeezus holy god, is there lipitor provided as a post-lunch mint?
@xrismichael @usawtfmJ1 @S1Your Yeah, but that's low-level, I do that all the time.  Officer: I sent you a couple of awards to update my records for my promotion board two weeks ago; Me: Can you just send it again so it's at the top of my e-mail?  I do that at least twice a week.
@S1Your @usawtfmJ1 It's even better when the bird gets promoted, but holds the same job.  Then you blame a bird being missing and useless GO bureaucracy to add to the time to get things signed.
@costareports Hey anyone want to check on how many other defense contractor stocks he's invested in since being on the Armed Services Committee?
@CapnMarko @soonergrunt @sgtjanedoe yeah, it used to be that way by changed in the '00s.  That whole alcohol in government facilities thing.  I'm sure someone burned down an armory.
@GumptyD @SolidVerbal P12 intersectional H-A-H: UCLA: Texas, TAMU, Tenn, Oklahoma, Wash: LSU, Stanford: NW, TCU, UVA, ND. Ariz: LSU, Oregon: Tenn, Nebraska.  Georgia only played 2 OOC road games: Clem in '13 and ND last year.  Not much but better than 'Bama.  LSU: Wash and WV. Auburn: Clem (x2).
@usawtfmJ1 @S1Your Oh yeah that's the Admin God Badge.  I've only seen like 2 or 3 of those.
@soonergrunt @sgtjanedoe Fatigue management was always fun to manage when I was a division HHC commander because we would pull in all the senior field grade and senior NCOs from across NY. And the hotels always gave us crap even though we were filling rooms that would otherwise have gone unused.
@CapnMarko @soonergrunt @sgtjanedoe No man, states used to forbid sleeping in the armory overnight unless specifically approved by The Adjutant General of the state.  Liability concerns etc.
@S1Your An S1 only truly earns his master AG badge when they can blame all four in the same conversation.
@SenhorRaposa How much is him and how much is the bluing of the state?  I think Trunp accelerated trends here.
@GumptyD @SolidVerbal USC has played home-and-homes against with Auburn, Ohio St., Texas, as well as ND every year. Alabama will go from 2011 til 2022 without playing a non-conference roadie (Texas) and you won't play at outside south (ND) until '28.
@B_M_Finnigan ?
@JustSchmeltzer @realDonaldTrump Eric, what does he know about legislative negotiation?  He was a unremarkable, useless member of Congress and his only significant legislative accomplishment as governor was to pass a discriminatory bathroom bill through Republican held State Assembly or Legislature.
@GumptyD @SolidVerbal Your consistent ability to make the playoff is not the argument here. When you play actually games in Seattle, Autzen, Columbus, Austin, Norman, or Ann Arbor.  Your teamcan continue to not play tough OOC road games at your will, just don't expect not to have it pointed out.
@SolidVerbal Alabama has not played a non-conference road game since 2011 against Penn State.  USC in that time plays Notre Dame on the road every other year, plus has trips to East Rutherford, Arlington, Hawaii, Boston, and Austin.  Call me back when Alabama actually does that.
@ArmyStrang @vagrunt Major plot twist that I bet none of these homophobes were expecting while letting people die of AIDS in the 80s.
@IAmKrishanPatel @OfficialClayyy @PopulismUpdates Maria is worse in some ways given how much better the response was to Harvey.
@IAmKrishanPatel @OfficialClayyy @PopulismUpdates I’m talking foreign policy.  Only Paris falls under that.  I agree that is a huge failure that will probably end up as bad.  Domestically family separation is VERY bad, as bad as anything Bush did.  Katrina response was an epic disaster, but a lot of blame for that one.
@usawtfmJ1 The sheer insanity boggles the mind sometimes.  I’m amazed the Army doesn’t collapse from its own bureaucracy sometimes.
@OfficialClayyy @IAmKrishanPatel @PopulismUpdates You have to base your opinion in facts.  What are the facts you are using to say Trump is worse than Bush?  Trump is a disaster of epic proportions but he has still not done as much damage as Bush did.  So far Trumps embarrassments are all window dressing.
@OfficialClayyy @IAmKrishanPatel @PopulismUpdates Also remind me when Trump makes a decision that leads to deaths of over a million people like Bushs invasion of Iraq.  The sectarian violence destabilized the region and made us completely unable and ineffective in responding to the Syrian civil war in any way.
@OfficialClayyy @IAmKrishanPatel @PopulismUpdates Listen, I don’t know how much of the world you’ve lived in or experienced, but I’m telling you Bush is worse than Trump.  He invaded Iraq under false pretenses and instituted a worldwide regime of torture in the name of protecting you.  Is that something you are proud of?
@OfficialClayyy @PopulismUpdates @IAmKrishanPatel Furthermore everyday I get more and more concerned by the number of young people on Twitter who don’t understand that.  The invasion was a disaster of monumental proportions that is the keystone to a lot of why things are the way they are now in the Middle East, Europe, and US.
@OfficialClayyy @PopulismUpdates @IAmKrishanPatel God are we going to have this argument.  Outside of starting a nuclear war or ceding Alaska to th Russians, there is nothing worse Trump can do foreign policy wise than what Bush did by invading Iraq.
@politicsluo And let’s me honest Sherrill, Spanberger, Rouda, Cisneros, would all probably be Repubs in the 80s version of the party.  (Yes I know Rouda was a Repub even recently).
@politicsluo Yeah I didn’t get all that into her background once she got posted as a Safe pick-up.  I like Andy Kim too.
@politicsluo 2024 menendez replacement?
@usawtfmJ1 So all the units Soldiers were born in December?  What are the odds?
@robrousseau Rob, it's because Ezra sees a kindred spirit in Paul Ryan (wonky, numbers guy interested in policy, etc.) except he never understood Paul Ryan was a facade for someone dedicated to destroyed social welfare and it seems that Ezra was the only one that didn't understand that.
@joncprevo Jon can you post an excel list of targeted districts/members on each map? Because honestly the combination of this map is the battleground in 2020?
@stuartpstevens Man who yelled fire in a crowded theater wonders why there are 70 trampled bodies in the theater lobby.
@CharlesLCarter3 @JustSchmeltzer @benjaminwittes Right but that doesn’t mean we have forget it happened, and mention it as really 1B to Watergate in terms of illegality.  And in many ways it was worse because people were being killed by Iran-Contra.
@politicsluo I know, twitter doesn't allow a legitimate question to not sound like an attack.  Believe me, I would have loved for Jason Kander to have won in '16 or run in '18.
@politicsluo Why is the historical reason for VA GOV being one-term only?
@politicsluo did you forget he dropped out from KC Mayor due to mental health issues?  That would have happened during this cycle.  I don't think he pulls through.
@AndrewSolender @nytimes https://t.co/kxsooMpnGw
@AndrewSolender @nytimes To me hard-line means that there are certain things that they won't do (i.e. take a hard line on things).  As a result, we get things like threatening the debt limit or shutting down the government.
@AndrewSolender @nytimes when a cohesive group of hard-line liberals shut down the government, let me know.
@profcarroll @djrothkopf God everyone memory holes Iran Contra, something way worse and more illegal and world spanning than Nixon.  That’s was the worst one and GHWB parsons basically let everyone forget.
@charlie_savage So basically everything bad about Sessions without the recusal, with a dash of presidential pardon to eliminate criminal threats to the Presidency.  Literally a worst case scenario.
@kenklippenstein Ken, what did your brothers do to you growing up?
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah Wasn't Lamont's opponent pretty Trumpy, too?
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah is there a concurrent 'reddening' in Eastern CT.  I remember a CT GOV map and thought that eastern CT was turning more red.
@kenklippenstein given who POTUS is and believes, is this a negative that will cause a firing in this administration?
@fawfulfan you understand Kobach is only saying this to pursue a method of getting absentee voting banned right?
@mtaibbi isn't it funny that the two most derided as soft Repub POTUS's (Ford and Bush 41) were the only ones with the cajones to pardon shameful lawbreaking (Ford pardoning Nixon and Bush pardoning Weinberger).  Not saying they were right but they did it.
@PoliticsReid Overlooked: She was only one you listed running against another Democrat.
@MSMollinedo this is the ideal situation
@jacklgoldsmith Jack, did he or did he not play a role in advising George HW Bush pardon Caspar Weinberger, et al?  A pardon, which the special prosecutor said prevented the case from being resolved.  Iran-Contra is one of the biggest stains on our democracy in a long time.
@ActorAaronBooth He is going to sign it - his entire legacy is about the destruction of democratic norms and attacking left political interests.  What does everyone think the union busting was all about?  The voter ID?  The gerry-mandering?
@ArmyStrang I don't understand why it's hard.  A man this famous not owning up is a huge missed opportunity for everyone.
@JustSchmeltzer @benjaminwittes @SenFeinstein @SenatorDurbin @amyklobuchar Trump didn't pick a dude who worked for Bush for AG because he liked him.  He likes what he's done and his stated position on things that directly affect Trump personally.
@JustSchmeltzer @benjaminwittes All this shows is the entire DC establishment has memory-holed the entire Iran-Contra scandal, something that was worse than Watergate given the illegality.  Instead this clown Barr is the genesis of pardoning everyone and no one faced any consequences.  It's insane.
@CAinexile @SenhorRaposa That’s what I figured.  I just thought I had read he tended to be more of a jerk than Scott or Baker, but I guess as long as he wasn’t a racist jerk, it was good enough.
@SenhorRaposa I don’t think anyone beats Phil Scott.  Was Hogan more beatable?
@rodger I replayed it and you can physically see him stealing Bouie’s soul.
@thedollop Dave come to Albany NY and do the Cuomos!
@barefootboomer Well if your ultimate goal is to undermine the UN, why not put someone to show everyone else what you think of the organization?  Just don’t be surprised when the other countries do the same.
@eisingerj Accountability is for the proles, Jesse.  You’ve seen that more than anyone.
@ArmyStrang He could have gone for a blast from the past: “Fight them there so we don’t have fight them here.”  Perhaps Stan should have to go to a funeral or two for these kids that dies over there recently who were like five on 9/11 and explain to the families what they died for. Shitheel!
@tbschlink @rudnicknoah @SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman @politicsluo With the caveat the NJ is expensive , he shouldn’t have had to blow that much cash on that race.  Didn’t DSCC pump in $4M in the last couple of weeks too?
@rudnicknoah @SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman @politicsluo I thought he was getting tried again
@rudnicknoah @SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman @politicsluo Ok.  That’s why I asked.  But you don’t think he has fundraising issues from here on?
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @rudnicknoah I mean NJ SEN CL1 starts at Safe D at this point.  Unless he’s the incumbent.  But $113K COH seems low even coming out of a re-election cycle.
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @rudnicknoah Right I was more speaking the seat not him.  There’s no way he runs again, right?
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo i know he just won, but this has to be a really low COH for a Senator in an ostensibly safe seat? https://t.co/iWVlyVqfHY
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota @neeratanden Were they at CAP together?  Is there some history here?
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa sad trombone sound
@SenhorRaposa the island is very poor, the major source of employment were shut down (a farm) and the major export (charcoal) was priced out by Mexico.  Sound similar to other places that vote Republican?  Most survive on welfare.
@libbycwatson Douthat, in true fashion, saying the quiet part quietly.
@SenhorRaposa Super isolated, you basically need a pass to get there.  Tourists not allowed to interact with locals.  2010 Census population was only 170.  Mostly subsistence farming.  2008 total vote count: 40 (McC: 35, Obama: 4, Cynthia McKinney: 1)
@SenhorRaposa Drew, fun fact (having lived in HI for four years).  Those red areas on the west coast would be where most of the working class Hawaiians live because it has the cheapest housing.  The stretch on the northeast is heavily Mormon and mostly rural. Interesting correlation.
@BFriedmanDC 411.  I used 411 a lot.  An addition to this question is how did you figure out where friends were when you agreed to meet up before cell phones.  Just walked around until you bumped into them.
@lindaholmes @nytimes Hey, it looks like NYT headline writers are just like Twitter users.  They don't actually read the articles either.
@PoliticsWolf Isn't this grounds for suing to overturn what was passed based on the their super majorities being unconstitutional?
@jkass99 What's the donor base for Heritage?  How much Saudi/UAE money is getting funneled in there?
@politicsluo that offshore drilling stuff - it's a losing proposition, especially since his opponent yoked herself to Trump hardcore.
@BFriedmanDC Brandon, I just don't understand this at all.  The book Relentless Strike painted his leadership and organizational skills during 05-07 as top notch.  This is just a stunning lack of awareness and interest in the lives and livelihoods of Soldiers executing this 'muddle through.'
@JustSchmeltzer I'm with you on this one.  I've reading her autobiography from 2014 open right now.
@JustSchmeltzer Oooh, he's such a good boy.  Let's pat him on the head and give him a treat and scratch him behind the ears.  What a disgusting human being.
@Ericzku @cmclymer True, but he was still doing stuff in ‘85 and ‘86 and appearing publicly.  After that he was mostly off the grid.
@DavidNir @alexburnsNYT Don’t forget Young Kim’s victory!
@cmclymer Iran Contra pardons basically ignored.  Also, has anyone ever let us know who was in charge when Reagan had Alzheimer’s the last 18 months?
@Zeddary @overdesigned How is there always a @dril tweet?
@iamnotasophist @livingpotato @DrewVanDrese @decunningham2 Perhaps you should explain to your friends how exactly it was that Bush 43 used a justification for striking back at the perpetrators of 9/11 to attack their country, which had nothing to do with that attack.
@livingpotato @iamnotasophist @DrewVanDrese @decunningham2 @livingpotato my comment should have come with a sarcasm identifier.
@SCheneyPeters @marsecgina @NavalDrones @RogerMisso @WWATMD commercially "un-viable" technologies become viable when backed by sovereign governments.  Especially when those sovereign governments aren't accountable to their populations (Russia, China) and thus have no limits on what they can theoretically spend on such endeavors.
@ActorAaronBooth saw something that said 7 PM EST
@ryangrim @Ocasio2018 @RepBarbaraLee @RepSwalwell @rosadelauro Pelosi kind of has an obligation on this one given AOC's support in the Speaker race.
@iamnotasophist @livingpotato @DrewVanDrese @decunningham2 I never said the intelligence community falsified the evidence.  Congress said that assertions of the president and his administration were not supported by the available intelligence. POTUS claimed Iraq had C&amp;B weapons and would have a nuke by 2010, sounds like they made it up.
@livingpotato @iamnotasophist @DrewVanDrese @decunningham2 Well see how it was we just blundered our way into war by concocting evidence and hiding the truth from the American people while scaring the shit out of the American people (Condeleeza Rice's mushroom cloud comments).  Iraq was just sitting there.  It was their fault.
@RealSeanYoo Does he mean in each handful?  Cause that's how I generally do it.
@leiitontheline @MaxRose4NY Let's find out a physical trait that makes @bterris the most self-conscious and write about it in an article published in the Washington Post.
@forbesmm If the climate deniers in Congress have any courage, they will specifically not allow government funds to be allowed for this purpose.  Let them go on the record preventing this.
@SolidVerbal I'm hoping for wins.  If Helton is a better coach because he has two pretty strong coordinators now, so be it.  They should be grooming the next Kingsbury in the new staff or keeping an eye on someone who could fill that role.  If we get two good years out of Kingsbury, great!
@LoveEachother14 @TheBuzzOfLA @byphilcrawford @davidsirota I do agree with that.  An easy answer to this whole disaster would be public financing of elections.  That would eliminate most of this guessing game.
@elivalley Really?  Man there is really nowhere I can enjoy anymore.  I would always go there when I am in NYC.
@TheBuzzOfLA @LoveEachother14 @byphilcrawford @davidsirota I'm with you 100%.  You stated exactly what I've been trying to say since the beginning.  We're going to run out of voters real quick if we invalidate their professions and invalidate their willingness to donate money to support candidates that they like and believe in.
@LoveEachother14 @TheBuzzOfLA @byphilcrawford @davidsirota Your first sentence is what I needed someone to state for a fact.  I agree with your second and third sentences whole-heartedly.  My only question would be being an executive at an oil/gas company is incompatible with having progressive values?  No snark, serious question.
@TheBuzzOfLA @byphilcrawford @davidsirota I understand having issue with there not being a difference a donation from, for instance, Jeff Bezos versus a warehouse worker from Amazon.  Or there not being a difference between a donation from the head of Exxon and a donation from someone pushing paper in Houston.
@TheBuzzOfLA @byphilcrawford @davidsirota enlighten me, maybe i'm misunderstanding the argument.  I'm being serious.
@TheBuzzOfLA @byphilcrawford @davidsirota agribusiness or people who work in agribusiness?  There are progressive people in the center of this country who work in those industries?  I'm not talking about executives, but the office workers and HR people.
@byphilcrawford @davidsirota Money for agriculture industry or money from people who work in the agriculture industry? Should he not accept money from people who's employment is on a big farm because it's the only source of employment nearby?  Even if they have progressive beliefs and voting records?
@Skotchamo @JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota Everybody has to work somewhere.  Where do you think voters are? Should he declare that he's not going to accept any money from people who work in oil and gas, even if they are office workers or in HR?
@NavalDrones @RogerMisso @WWATMD Resource war, perhaps resource race should be a better term.  Having an icebreaker fleet to be able to facilitate movement through the area year round as it gets warmer.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota I think that this is going to alienate a lot of people if we start attacking where they work.  If you're going to start telling people to quit their jobs and the benefits (health insurance!) that comes with it when there's no safety net, that's a losing argument.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota her contributions received in her campaign.
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota empire-building and foreign wars.  Also, too Emily Sirota's #4 contributors were lawyer's and lobbyist's.  Why does Emily Sirota work work for lobbyists?  She's in their pocket?  I wouldn't say something without providing some nuance to the situation by detailing it was 6% of...
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota If we carry this logic through, no Dem should accept any money from anyone who works in oil/gas, chemicals, coal, etc.  Where does Sirota think Dem voters work?  I have problems with the military and what goes on sometimes, but does David not want my vote because he is against...
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota He's wrong and he knows it.  Jonathan Allen posted something that showed Beto was the #1 recipient of campaign donations from dozens of industries.  Sirota was disingenuous and he knows it.
@RogerMisso @WWATMD Man shit, we need those even more as the ice cap breaks up.  There is going to be a resource war in the Arctic and we need to be prepared.
@DrewVanDrese @iamnotasophist @decunningham2 The International Criminal Court in 2002 listed torture as a war crime.  Bush oversaw the implementation of a network of black sites that tortured and disappeared supposed terrorists.  I am not making arguments in bad faith.
@dandrezner He said this on David Axelrod’s podcast yesterday.  I cackled so loud people looked at me weird.
@DrewVanDrese @iamnotasophist @decunningham2 Furthermore, once we were in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and Abu Guarib were one of the single biggest radicalizers of Iraqi people.  Explain to me how all of that is OK.
@DrewVanDrese @iamnotasophist @decunningham2 Maybe he should have to justify why any of those things are OK.
@DrewVanDrese @iamnotasophist @decunningham2 I’m glad we can have a conversation about me instead of Eric, the torture apologist.  Also, too, can any of you explain the legal justification for the war in Iraq?  In addition, Bush instituted a world wide regime of torture that is still being covered up.
@GaryLegum I get confused all the time if it’s him or Brock that used to be Republican.
@decunningham2 No.  I could care less where you put Obama.  Bush 43 was one of the worst presidents ever.  This is every bit as bad as a Obama backer with blinders in.  Bush should be #5 and he doesn’t even deserve a letter grade.  The blood of 4K Americans dead in Iraq is on his hands.
@decunningham2 This a troll right?  Your putting a war criminal who oversaw an illegal invasion of a country,  allowed torture, and let New Orleans drown as #2?  This is patently absurd.
@XOofXOs @barefootboomer They all do.  It was the last time they could overcome Army bureaucracy just by sheer force of will.  They want that kind of unbridled power back.
@AndrewSolender #1 @kenklippenstein
@minakimes I need background on the triangular shaped tooth
So the Republicans stealing NC09 is going to be the reason the Roberts court upholds state laws banning absentee voting, right?
@Drivethelane21 Well aren’t they owned by their fans?  Their fans (mostly) want him gone.  In an odd way, classless or not, it’s the most responsive firing to a terrible loss.  It’s how fans would act if they were he GM.
@Drivethelane21 Then he should take it as a blessing.  Take a studio job.  The blame and pressure were only going to get worse.
@Drivethelane21 But he’s not now and hasn’t been for three years.  He’s wasted every year since the Super Bowl win.
@YahooForde Look UGA is good but man, I have no desire to watch their coach choke away a 3rd game in 12 months to Alabama
Why does every coach, even ones long gone from the profession like Tony Dungy, send up the protective shield for even shitty coaches like Mike McCarthy?
Tony Dungy!!!  The #1 reason to not pick up Kareem Hunt is not because he lied to his team!  It’s because he abuses women!!!!!  Why is this so f’ing hard?!!!
@JustSchmeltzer @BFriedmanDC You forgot about the Katra from Star Trek II/III?
@ProFootballTalk It should be turned upside down like in The Replacements.
@CharlesPPierce @PaulBegala They should be angry at their coach for playing with both hands pulling on the parking break in the last two games against Alabama.
@JMilesColeman I wish there was an emoji for the sad trombone sound
@btpanko @ChazNuttycombe I also wouldn’t be surprised if a couple of R internals made their way to them.
@decunningham2 @IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo Check out the Goldilocks trio over here
@ChazNuttycombe @Redistrict Yeah.  And it inadvertently caused a momentum shift in coverage and in the way DSCC spent money late.  Wonder if that money could have helped Nelson across the line.
@joncprevo This is shit.  The left is excommunicating them before they have even taken a vote.  They’re not even seated yet.  Can we get some actual history first?  Also I’ve noticed the silence on the left re AOC supporting Pelosi.  What happened there?
@ChazNuttycombe What do you think it was in response to?  Did they get force fed some bad R internal or believe the media trying to hype it?
@IAmKrishanPatel I lost a lot of respect for him after his airport freak out.  WHERE’S THE PLANE?!
@ArmyStrang Are you claiming Jarhead as a Christmas movie?  I mean the Christmas party scene is pretty funny.  Also too did you know there are not one but two sequels.  I personally had no idea until just now.
@ChazNuttycombe @cwgNAS Right, he did better there then Mel Hall, the D who lost by 9.5 points.
@ChazNuttycombe Shouldn't Donnelly run for IN-2 himself?  That was his district?
@sepinwall @KenTremendous @kumailn unacceptable this is your final answer if you've never had grilled peaches top by vanilla ice cream and honey.
@politicsluo maybe Rahm should focus on how he might be held liable for the Laquan McDonald cover-up.
@JustSchmeltzer @Kaepernick7 good lord - it's even worse given he has history of domestic violence.  NFL gave him a second chance and glossed over the history already.  They can't do it again.
@daveanthony Dave, we have to coordinate protests at his district offices.
@LikeIGive_Adam What cabinet jobs should Claire and Heidi get if the Dem wins in 2020?
@AndrewSolender was she that ROTC girl?
@AndrewSolender He is the poor man's version of Justin Amash.  Except he mixes in a dash of racist dog whistles.
@WTF_Judge @agingerssoul As a MAJ, I resemble this remark.
@BlutoTweets @MichaelStahlke I didn’t mean at CTCs.  I meant as standing formations.  God when our IBCT got its Shadow platoon, our AVN BDE commander staged a coup and even got out in charge of it and it wasn’t in his BDE.  It happened nationally too.  Army AVN controls UAV training.  The ER-UAVs go to CABs
@MichaelStahlke @BlutoTweets IBCTs are like that now minus the organic aviation.  In my 16 years of experience AVN will never allow battalion assets to not be controlled by an AVN O6 (even ARNG separate battalions controlled by state aviation officer, not a maneuver commander).
Da fuck with this?  She had eleven  chances in states he won, only won  four and lost one.  Then lost her only Clinton state where she was playing defense (NV). https://t.co/mqivxaUyP0
@IAmKrishanPatel @jacobfhsmith I’d start at 2 (Cox and Rose) and move up if there’s a good nominee.  I think a good nominee saves Horn and a good nominee with good environmental bonafides saves Cunningham.
@XOofXOs @redlegtigger I’ve got an opening at O5 in 35D and 59A
@jaredlholt Let her stay there until the tipping point - how does she handle the need to go to the bathroom?
@XOofXOs @redlegtigger XO, come to my state!  We always need quality officers to serve.
@ptcaslin @JMilesColeman @cinyc9 @SenhorRaposa @VanceUlrich How is the base data you used for your map broken out?
@ptcaslin @JMilesColeman @cinyc9 @SenhorRaposa @VanceUlrich Any way you can map these results on current CDs?  Or even do a comparison over time of areas where changed from Red to Blue over time. I remember being 14 when this passed and thinking that Republicans were committing suicide.
@ArmyStrang We need to mobilize the next liberal to hit him about this comment the next time he is on CNN.
@daveanthony I want Chuck gone - who's the replacement?  Bernie?  Klobuchar? Harris? Murray? Brown?  It has to be someone not running for Prez.  Which basically means Murray/Merkeley, right?  Durbin is just as much a squish as Chuck and is probably retiring in 2020.
@ArmyStrang yeah, I'm depressed that this asshole is considered a leading light of conservative intellectual thought.  How do I have a job where I can spew "Murder My Enemies with Helicopters" rhetoric and face zero consequences?
@FPWellman He had no problem being one of those Congressional caterwaulers about Benghazi.  But now that he’s defending murder and mutilation, it’s meaningless chatter.  It is a rather embarrassing that this he is the highest WP grad in an administration since Ike.
@robrousseau The plot to take down Pelosi has no comparison in the Senate because Seth Moulton is Chuck Schumer.  I would prefer someone combative her - I know she has other issues, but I believe Kamala would do well in this role.
@ChazNuttycombe If Joni has to keep propping up Steve King and Hyde-Smith, she might see some dropping numbers.  I would make an active effort to continue to tie her to the worst her party has to offer.
@JustSchmeltzer @emptywheel Or even worse both him and Corso are pulling yet another right wing grift for money.  Jill Stein learned so well.
@jkcommunicatio4 @matthewamiller Oh I agree with that - news reports have tended to be 3-6 months behind Mueller.  I'm confident he had this, and find it unsurprising that this comes out the day after the plea deal was null and void.  I was more commenting on that fact that it took this long for media to find it
@SenhorRaposa yeah, that was my guess after that poll came out.
@justinhendrix If it's what you say, I love it.
@SenhorRaposa Shorter Trump: GO VOTE FOR MY RACIST FRIEND!
@matthewamiller Jeez - for all the media has been digging into this for 2.5 years, that this only comes out now?  Wow!
@ActorAaronBooth isn't this what Saul's brother in Better Call Saul had wrong with him?
@robrousseau I look forward to Erick moving to the Philippines to enjoy the hospitality of that regime.  Seems to be all he wants in the world.
@robrousseau @HNHughson Also, too, this guy would piss his pants if he lived under Pinochet.  And seemingly admits he would collaborate with such a regime to kill people just to harm his enemies.
@daveanthony I admire the mental flexibility some will take to deny what's happening before their eyes.  I grew up in CA until '98.  We only had one really major span of fires (1994).  They've now had 3 straight years of catastrophic, community destroying fires.
@IAmKrishanPatel This disgusting fat momma's boy would piss his pants if he had live under someone like Pinochet.  He would turn into a simpering spineless pansy.  His confidence that he wouldn't end up on a helicopter is truly mind-blowing.  He's admitting he would collaborate with the govt.
@AlexHortonTX Also, too, spend a weekend night as a Staff Duty Officer in any brigade.  Alcohol, family unrest, drugs, DUI, and if it’s really a bad night, a Soldier ends up in the hospital or worse for doing something they probably shouldn’t have.
Holy Lamar Miller!  97 yards!
@SMM_lumani @AndrewSolender @daveweigel OK, so we should have to do deal with the drip, drip, drip of four years of stories of Al Franken grabbed a woman's ass or other pictures of him pretending to grabs the breasts of another sleeping woman.  And with Repubs dragging out and leaking the Ethics process in bad faith.
@ChazNuttycombe yeah, i got excited then clicked through and saw change and realized the spread was probably 15, not 5
@RepMiaNoLove this is wonderful news - she will play active defense against McSally or the fight will hurt McSally with the Ward base.
@kenklippenstein oh jeezus - so is this the new tack.  The last two years was Trump voters in red areas are still for Trump.  Now we're going to focus on Trump voters in blue areas, but not spend a single bit of time on profiling people who voted for Dems this year to see if there is a shift.
@AndrewSolender @daveweigel I just think the hypocrisy of Franken sitting out there to get hit by a fungo bat again and again leads to a bleeding of that suburban women support to throw up their hands and say "both sides" and vote R.
@AndrewSolender @daveweigel He was.  But can you imagine the last year of attack ads by Repubs?  He would have been in every single one.  Every Dem candidate would have been forced to state their position.  It was simply untenable for him to stay in position in light of all that was happening.
@pattymo @kathbarbadoro Shit I didn’t even know kendzior had actually written anything.  I thought she was VERY online.  Who knew?
@LinLorienelen @joaltroll @bitchylaughter @ASlavitt @NoortjeSchoute If I remember this correctly, something with way Trump and Rs attempted to mess with ACA going into ‘18 allowed states with exchanges like CA to offer their higher level plans (like Gold) for cheaper than what was supposed to be the general purpose affordable plan (Silver).
@politicsluo Trump can’t grow facial hair
@robrousseau Agree with this 100%.
@daveanthony Dave I agree with you friend.  It’s a terrible idea and it’s hard to feel so hopeless about it all.  That’s why I appreciate what you are doing with your new group.
@EoinHiggins_ Haha, Eoin got pre-owned by Neera Tanden.    /sarcasm
@daveanthony This seems brilliant.  We only have a vague idea of how the sun works the way it does.  Why not fuck with it?  But to be honest, we’re not going to do shit to fix global warming on our end, so their plan has a higher likelihood of being executed.
God this Chicago Detroit game is the opposite of everything Monday night was.
@qjurecic No because Justice Roberts seems to be the only one in the world to not understand why he, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh have their jobs.
Horses are running all over the place and here comes Chief Justice Roberts to comment on the fact that someone left the barn door open.
@qjurecic @chrislhayes Cool when is he going to say something about the nakedly partisan efforts of the spouse of one his associate justices and the perception her actions are having an effects in the so called independence of his Court
@kenklippenstein God this drone is the perfect addition to the Trump orbit.  He is Trump style grifter.
@ArmyStrang @MurderBryan I can’t believe this is still a thing.  I remember dumbasses on my deployment in 04 stuffing A bags full of new dinars to ship home.  I asked one a year later what he did with them.  He said he burned them at a bonfire.
@Popehat God bless him having the lack of self awareness to believe what he actually wrote.  Why does he think Bush appointed him and Alito?  Isn’t he a member of the Federalist Society?  Is he completely unaware of what that organization is doing to the concept of judicial independence?
@ArmyStrang That’s doughy piece of shit wishes he looked like that.  Also too masculinity in Piers mind can be defined by posting a picture like this with no self awareness of how his actual body has the consistency of fried dough.
@PeterHLemieux @chrbit3 @manerdm @KatieBoWill @TaraCopp Oh yeah, 100% with you on that one.  And I think Mattis is playing defense against Tom Cotton becoming SECDEF.  He knows what would happen if there are Trump cronies at Defense, State, DHS and Justice.  My only guess is this fiasco at the border was to prevent worse.
@PeterHLemieux @chrbit3 @manerdm @KatieBoWill @TaraCopp I didn't say they were exactly alike in all aspects, but make no doubt that Mattis will enforce the transgender ban if the courts lift the injunction.  They've been tossing enlistees who citizenship as part of their enlistment contracts.
@chrbit3 @manerdm @KatieBoWill @TaraCopp I wouldn't be so sure Mattis is as far from Kelly as you would think.  Kelly was Mattis's chief subordinate in 1st MARDIV.  They probably have more common ground on issues than you think.
@SNAFU_Sara civilian - ARNG almost never rewards those Soldiers.
So how would you feel if a family member's murder was used to leverage lower oil prices?  Pretty good or not?
@JustCameron__ Was kierstad or rouda the dccc preference?
@JustCameron__ Yeah.  I distinctly remember DCCC doing something tactical like that to prevent top 2 lockout.  Just demolished the 2nd Repub with ads to drive down votes and ensure a Dem made it through.  Stivers was a bad NRCC chair.
@JustCameron__ I thought money + Russian hacking went after Kierstad in -48.  Were they attacking the stronger candidate/clearing the field for Rouda?
@daveanthony @michelleisawolf @realDonaldTrump Just...there are no words.  My God.
@politicsluo I cackled when I saw news about Fudge.  Moulton and Ryan really stretched their necks out for no reason.  Just atrocious - no plan from the beginning.
@IAmKrishanPatel My Rand Paul libertarian streak says time cannot be managed by the government - everyone should have their own clocks.
@IAmKrishanPatel "openly" or "vociferously" -- she's 4H white supremacy certified.  She is the human embodiment of what we should see when we ask about all those white women who voted for Ron DeSantis
@JustSchmeltzer @jaketapper @sethmoulton Why would Jake share this - even if he believes it's newsworthy, it makes it implicitly seem that he agrees and/or is taking the side of Moulton.  Isn't there a CNN Opinions twitter account? Couldn't they have pushed it? Jake could have maybe retweeted that instead.
@JustCameron__ @MRKruge The first reply hit this on the head -- all of those makes those McDaniel voters more likely to vote for as opposed to sit at home.  Them sitting at home was what Espy needed.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe Yeah, from a strictly proportional basis - most ground made up in NC, GA, TX, and OH with maybe 1-2 seat pick-ups in AL, AR, IN, and MO.  I'm just trying to imagine what ground those 20 extra seats would have to be fought on to get to the 2010-level
@robrousseau @benshapiro This is the smart conservative?  Jeezus, the wingnut welfare circuit will prop up ANYONE without regard for actually having quality, intelligent positions supported by evidence.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe I'm also thinking there's a seat to be had in IN/AR, plus probably 2-4 in OH and probably GA?
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe given the House was a wave but also gerrymandered, where would the seats comes from to get Dems from +40 (‘18) to +60?  I figure there’s at least 2-3 each in TX and NC.  Where else?
@dwdavison9318 This has to be the stupidest shit I’ve seen today.  I can’t believe this combination of words actually appeared in this particular order.
@ArmyStrang That asshole can go first.  Seriously, f that guy
@ChazNuttycombe Don’t forget also that the oldest brother died in WW2.  He was actually the one Joe Kennedy wanted to run for Prez.
@SenhorRaposa @reveal Let me clarify.  It might not qualify as legally shady but it falls in that gray area over the way endowment funds can be used.  He used $215 million to purchase land for expansion when it should have been plowed into reducing cost of going to school (reducing fees, etc).
@SenhorRaposa McRaven did some shady stuff with endowment money while the President of the UT system.  If it’s more widely known it will be trouble.  I believe it was covered in an episode of the @reveal podcast
@politicsluo There is no version of this list that I accept without Walker and Kobach as 1A/1B for their attacks/delegitimatizaton of public sector employee unions and voting rights.  I can think of no elected officials who destroyed the ability of liberals to organize and vote more than them
@JustSchmeltzer Hey cool I really like football a lot.  I pay attention and have opinions on the weekly goings-on.  Can I get an interview?
@BFriedmanDC Inept Trent Franks in the back left.  He deserves an X I say
@samknight_one I, too, want to have so much money that I can just give six figures to any old company and never bother even mildly investigating what the company is or does.
@geoffreyvs We know it’s rowing upstream but Dems can’t not try.  They didn’t try in he LA runoff in Dec ‘16 and that seat was even more important in retrospect with what happened in AL a year later.  51-49 throughout Trumps first 2 years is a vastly different dynamic.
@IAmKrishanPatel I went to high school with people like that (SMCHS).  It rang true in some aspects but not in others.  In fact my HS was the closest analog to the HS in the show (rich private prep school) even though it wasn’t in Newport.  There were enough Newport Bros and their ladies though.
@JustSchmeltzer It’s like all of them were looking for a single non-white winner in their batch.  They all touted Kim knowing how long it takes CA to count their votes and that she wasn’t far enough ahead to fend off the VBM ballots.  They are f’ing clueless
@JMilesColeman This is better JMC humor.
@EoinHiggins_ I’ve listened to him explain what he does at Bain several times.  It seems a worthwhile pursuit, but he’s still ultimately working to benefit the rapacious company.  I don’t see how he overcomes that.
@Lkatzenberg This is disgusting.  Why do they write like he’s reading?  They know he’ll never read it.  Write what you want to say without being sycophantic.  It’s possible.
@joncprevo I just made the same sound
@JustSchmeltzer This whole fiasco is really rather embarrassing.  These jerks couldn’t at least have figured out who they wanted before tilting at windmills
@IAmKrishanPatel @BarbaraBoxer do they actually acknowledge that there was a wave?
@IAmKrishanPatel @BarbaraBoxer God they need to cancel the first panel.
@joncprevo @_BlueGeorgia_ PA-1, WA-3/5, AR-2, Marchant in TX, VA-5, whatever NC districts are competitive after their new map.
@NateSilver538 @dbernstein How far up PCH on the West Coast would you have to drive before hitting a red district?
@ArmyStrang I view this more as either that tank driving up the 5 in CA in the 90s or that LT in the 577 in VA last year.  Equal amounts of lawlessness and perception of invincibility.
@daveanthony It’s literally the same thing.  NYT is a carbuncle in society dedicated to minimizing the perception of how bad things really are.  What a disgrace.
@SenhorRaposa I was just about to tweet about this.  I’m more convinced it’s a DM gone public.
@IAmKrishanPatel Again, Repubs live in their own media ecosystem that allows a divorce from reality.  It’s her running for NRCC.  It’s Rohrabacher walking around like he hasn’t lost.  It’s Charlie Kirk declaring Young Kim a congreswoman.
@DrewVanDrese @Username_Redact @RyanCostello @kkondik These Repubs live in their own world with its own media ecosystem.  Anything that goes against them is obviously rigged against them politically.  He would obviously prefer that a state was so close presidentially he represented by 75% or more Reoubs because that would be fair.
@politicsluo Wait isn’t this in violation of his bail agreement?  I’m sure he’s only allowed to go back and forth to DC at this point.
@joncprevo Does retirement to prison count?
@AndrewSolender God this doesn’t even match up.  Basic map reading is hard.
@pptsapper OK, they were paid active duty pay for time they weren't on active duty.  I know it was an error.  In my experience, there is a cap on the % of any paycheck that can be taken out during recoupment.  Someone at state MILPAY dropped the ball - should have been linked in with demob.
@AndrewSolender @NateSilver538 Plattsburgh belongs is same boat as the other central NY towns further southwest.  Those towns lost manufacturing (Beechnut, etc.) and Plattsburgh lost the Air Force.  Agree on Saranac.
@AndrewSolender @NateSilver538 You cannot honestly believe NY-21 belongs in New England?  By demo its closer to central Pennsylvania than New England.
@cd_hooks top flight analysis, as always, Salena.  How can I learn to develop crack skills like yours?
@attorneygsb @dunlopfirestone @ggreenwald @PodSaveAmerica Miller did not have his own.  He would show up in some of their live shows.  Crooked Media has other worthwhile pods that don't have those guys. Pod Save the People, Hysteria, Keep It and With Friends Like These all highlight and emphasize female/minority views.
@AN_Goldstein @FPWellman Let's not forget that Grand Pooba of this community (Erik Prince) attempting to become a grand viceroy of Afghanistan.  It's almost like building a hagiography around that community and instilling a sense of being above the law inculcates a feeling of being above the law.
@Ungwhim_Gwhent @AN_Goldstein @FPWellman Classic military move - foist the problem off on another command or, in this case, the American people.
@AN_Goldstein @FPWellman Weren't Greitens and Zinke SEALs too?  I know the SEAL community had issues with both, but they were both in that community, and never forced out despite ethical issues in uniform.
@NateSilver538 @baseballot Nate, absolutely not.  People in NY21 will never accept it, nor will people in New England accept people in NY 21.  Furthermore, I think you are underestimating just how far west NY-21 reaches.  It touches Lake Ontario now.
@daveanthony Please do an episode on this episode ensuring to highlight the quality contributions of both Jay Carney and Tim Miller.  What scumbags.
@RogerMisso Veterans are literally making the choice between food and staying in school because his administration can't figure out how to pay the schools.
@AndrewSolender @MarkWarner The Berniecrats hate him - don't know if that makes him more likeable in your mind.  Given his background and my stance that it's going to take all-star Democratic talent administration wide to fix 2017-2020, SECDEF/STATE would be a better use of his strengths.
@SenhorRaposa Holy F*ck!  Is this guy complete unaware of what his candidate was saying about health care?  Or is it only "saying anything to win" if a Democrat does it?
@kenklippenstein Who knew that a man whose website was originally invented to rate the attrativeness of women would turn out to be a self-important, hyper-sensitive, vindictive asshole
@qjurecic Listen to the 2 This American life episodes with him on it.  The reporter clearly came to the conclusion that Flake either did not know how to use these levers or just didn't care to even though he clearly had the power to.
@SenhorRaposa OK, by this logic, Congressmen Stupid's CD also rejected same-sex marriage.  Please make that argument out loud and see where it gets you.  How about the other CD is allowed to have Hillary as President?  Especially since it went for Hillary by 15 points, and only lost CD-2 by 10
@mitchellvii Owning the libs by forgetting anything that happened last spring or last year.
@hilzoy go along to get along - don't rock the boat.
@IAmKrishanPatel Over under is always 9.5 seconds in these cases
@JustCameron__ God this is just a horrendous take. One completely dismissed from everything Repubs did to actively destroy their brand in the state.  Capper is having a Trump supporter as their GOV nominee with a close second being unable to find a second quality nominee to run against DiFi
@rudnicknoah @AndrewSolender @JakobDWebster Look, for me it came down to this.  Which jerk (Cuomo or Molinaro) was going to get things done with a Dem Senate and Assembly?  I already regret it considering Cuomo just spent all the money to help Delgado and Rose get re-elected in tax breaks for f’ing Amazon.  I hate Cuomo.
@RachaelBL @dandrezner @amazon It's like Boston and the Olympics
@rudnicknoah Isn’t the simplest answer that this was a DM that he accidentally posted publically.  Or even a draft that he accidentally published.
@nomoremister Love this debate happens when there is no commensurate outrage for people having their constitutional voting rights taken away because some random county clerk decides that an undotted i is enough to disqualify for non-matching signatures.
@EricKleefeld Don’t miss the guy front and center with the white power hand symbol
@gelliottmorris MITCH LANDRIEU!
@mtaibbi it's not about the bear - its about the commercial being a Q Anon call out: "I AM THE STORM"
@BFriedmanDC This is fun, I'll just add this into the continuing list of government benefits that Republican run administrations will make so onerous to obtain that people will give up rather than deal with the hassle of attempting to acquire what they're entitled to. This is Repub governance
Looks like there was room to grow in Beto areas and makes me wonder what happened this time around.
Add in that Bexar County (San Antonio), which Beto won by 19 points, was 3 points behind the state turnout rate (49-52).  Cameron County (Brownsville) was Beto +26 but 19 points behind state turnout (37-52).  El Paso County was Beto +49 but 5 points below average turnout (47-52)
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel Maybe there is something to this whole TX is just a non-voting state.  As of right now, comparing the Texas Senate Race from '12 to '18: 33% turnout yields a 27 point Cornyn victory.  52% turnout in '18 yields only a 2.63 point Cruz victory.
@rudnicknoah @BenJ_Rosenblatt I knew it, Cillizza IS contagious.  Calling @NateSilver538, please go retrieve @ForecasterEnten and pay him whatever it costs to ensure he doesn't slide into this kind of vapid, lazy coverage
@ArmyStrang My problem with that is ending up doing something like he did and insulting people literally running for their lives.  If you could shut him in a room with no internet access I’m good.  I mean what he said couldn’t have been any more insulting than what he might have said
@SenhorRaposa Or they could make a story line where his mouth gets stolen or broken and it has to be replaced with a new one.  And now you have a legit reason for a different voice.  Plus the reason/further reason for a villain.
@Johngcole Number are easy to use if you ignore all of the ones that indicate bad things about your party.  My favorite tack of his is, "Listen here Dems, I, honorable Republican, am here to show you how to win Republican votes.  Ignore your base because that always works out."  Hack!
@AndrewSolender Andrew, I agree with you.  A group of politicians only watching Fox News (who minimized the effects of ACA repeal and directly fed the fire of protests as all fake/outside agitators) is going to believe whatever propaganda it is that their party-sponsored media outlet spews out.
@AndrewSolender @Jonlando @joncprevo @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo Cuomo in Westchester: '10: +34, '14: +13, '18: +34.  Really shocking to me Mollinaro did as bad as Palladino.
@joncprevo @AndrewSolender @JakobDWebster @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo yeah no joke on this - he was already on a podcast talking about moderation.  I encourage the Assembly/Senate to have a dozen things he refused to even bring up over the last 8 years on his desk and dare him to veto
@AndrewSolender to be fair, that was Stefanik's line against Cobb too.  Hell even Repub State Senate and Assembly ads I saw here were all taking that tack too.  Faso just had bonus racism
@JMilesColeman @BradAshford18 Well I guess he should have run a better primary campaign if he really wanted to be in Congress.
@joncprevo @AndrewSolender @JakobDWebster @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo I will say there is something him doing crappy in Albany.  He only won it in '14 by 3.85%.  He won it in '10 by 36 points. but his opponent was Carl Palladino.
@SenhorRaposa @AndrewSolender @politicsluo @joncprevo Yeah, I was kind of shocked it was that low.  Although to be honest with you, that was the one I had the longest decision time over on Tuesday.
@SenhorRaposa @AndrewSolender @politicsluo @joncprevo I suspect that Cuomo was a drag on the NY ticket statewide, which makes their victory in the State Senate more interesting.  Albany County is one of the most reliably Dem counties in the state (it even voted Mondale in '84) https://t.co/tAx9q1PDTZ
@MeetThePress @LUnderwood630 Chuck Todd had actual Democrats in his show?!!  I didn’t know that was allowed.
@SenhorRaposa This is way better than your cupcake take.  That was not your best offering.
@mcimaps How does the disappointing gerrymandered result of house races factor in?  Win 47% of the vote and only get 25% of the seats.  Would picking up 2-3 seats have changed your view?
@JMilesColeman Does Walz win if he runs for re-election in MN01?
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe It would have saved us from this bloviating spineless gasbag for the last two years.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe Makes me wonder if she was lining up for ‘12 against Flake.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe It’s so sad given how dedicated she is to service post injury and post politics that she would have been a wonderful representative for AZ in any role.
@jazzmankyle @brianbeutler Right because cnn and msnbc aren’t dedicated pro liberal outlets in the way Fox is.  It won’t gain traction and both of those networks would go gallivanting after the next outrage and lose focus.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe I was reminded of Gabby Giffords today.  Would she be in Sinema’s place if she hadn’t been shot?  Or would she have taken on Flake in ‘12?  Or run for Gov in ‘14/‘18?  I don’t think she takes on McCain in ‘16.
@lukeoneil47 I agree with this.  Such under utilized terrain on his cowardice surrounding Vietnam.  And the fact that he won’t go even to Kuwait.
@rodger Um why is Miami #2?  They’re 5-4.  Do they have someone’s pick?
@Jonlando @JMilesColeman Right but if you don’t invest now you’ll never have anything there in a generation.  Imagine if TX Dems had good infrastructure in place when a once in a generation talent like Beto came along.  You invest now so that you don’t waste the SC Beto.  Or do nothing, that works, too.
@PopulismUpdates So room to expand the majority in 2020 is what I’m taking away (with good candidates and enough resources)
@JustSchmeltzer @jbendery Totally see Kelly seeing the original and stewing for the whole trip and getting back to Paris and telling the social media team to fix it.
@JMilesColeman Again, SC Dem party needs resources and investment.  There is clearly something to be built on here.
@jerkmotel Shorter Charlie: I don’t know how mail works.
@dandrezner And all will be primaried based on simply upholding the rule of law and sanctity of the electoral process
@hodgesmr @rudnicknoah @RepStevePearce @RepLujanGrisham This is how all election results maps should be expressed.
@ActorAaronBooth People are literally dying and running for their lives and Twitler is over here lobbing grenades at victims.
@astrangerland @JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Yeah.  I agree with those points.  I don’t think it would have mattered this year.  And the only GOV candidate that could have helped Beto was Beto.
@politicsluo Hopefully Hanabusa primaries him ‘20
@AndrewSolender @politicsluo Who’s the Dem candidate in ‘20?
@rudnicknoah @The_Viking95 SC Dem party needs help/resources. There is ground to be made there.
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa I know there wasn’t much a bench, but does a better GOV candidate pull Beto across the line?
@joshtpm So Adam got the short straw in the “who’s writing the both sides article” pool today?
@AndrewSolender God, google is hard.  Even someone as deeply unpopular as Hillary Clinton.  still got more votes than Trump in the non-NYC counties in NY.  And Repubs just nominated someone with the exact Repub profile that might win statewide against a scandal ridden incumbent and he lost badly
@IsaacDovere @Schwarzenegger VA is bad, but NC and WI are worse.
@daveanthony stay safe, Dave
@whothewu @daveanthony Oh shit, there's another one, i was only tracking the firestorm up near Chico.  My heart aches for my native state.
@S1Your @usawtfmJ1 umm, sorry, this woman is cooler than all of us combined. https://t.co/jewO1lOw0S
@LorenCrowe @dogfuq @DSAVeterans @CG_ArmyROTC @ArmyROTC @TheWTFNation @thehill You're forgetting the Pat Tillman fiasco
@daveanthony what now?
@mtsw counterpoint: he won't
@mtsw I encourage Patrick to go look at Alabama's congressional districts.  6R-1D and no race is even close
@Bainst06 @JenetAllDay Yup that’s where I live now.  Finally might get some progressive governance now that Repubs lost the Senate.
@RidgeKnapp @MaxShapiro_IL @ChazNuttycombe That’s what I was saying
@ChazNuttycombe @MaxShapiro_IL I’m kind of in on KY.  Mitch is going to have to suck up to Trump way more now that he’s running for re-election.  Let’s at least see who runs against Bevin next year and how they do.  Anyway forcing him to put up a fight there takes money away from TX, GA and NC
@iAmTheWarax Yeah this women works at a Harvard think tank focused on expanding knowledge and understanding of Sharia Law, so people don’t scapegoat and demonize it.  Then proceeds to treat all troops the way she doesn’t want Sharia Law treated.  What a hack.
@AndrewSolender @JakobDWebster @DemocraticLuntz All this year proves is time is a flat circle
@AndrewSolender @JakobDWebster @DemocraticLuntz Andrew, the Brooks Brothers Riot was a bunch of Republicans dressed up outside south FL election counting locations demanding votes not be counted.  They were led by former Secretary of State James Baker and enabled by FL SOS Katherine Harris.
@TheAtlantic @elainaplott What a joke.  Comparing a state wide race to a single district and then quoting Karl F’ing Rove on why Beto lost. Jeffrey Goldberg sucks!
@ActorAaronBooth @politicsluo Was he a candidate to take down Roberts?
@JenetAllDay Jenet, I agree that there are plenty of conservatives in CA (grew up in south OC surrounded by them) but I’m just saying I remember lots of them moving to TX too, taking their conservative beliefs with them.
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo @rudnicknoah @politicsluo Gents agree with all.  Trends (and population) are definitely shifting to making it easier to win NV/AZ/CO than in ND/IN/MO.  Give Tim Ryan a shot at Portman, see how close he gets then shift focus to GA.  Agree on taking on RonJohn.  Toomey in PA, too.  Throw Scholten at Ernst.
@SenhorRaposa @joncprevo @IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah @politicsluo in the long run demographically isn’t trading senate seats in MO, ND and IN for senate seats in NV, AZ and CO (in ‘20) a good trade for Dems?  Add in the possibility of another AZ seat in ‘20 for Doug Jones seat?
@jwgop Someone should post this tweet outside Marcia Blackburn’s new Senate office every day. Post it right over the engraved nameplate.
@gelliottmorris Come on Elliott.  Having a sinecure editorial position at the NYT means never having to back up any of your claims with actual data ever again.  Just write according your predisposed to believe or what some can driver told you.
@blueWRL @DonnyFerguson @EricKleefeld @longhornderek That’s another reason too.  And only 40% of those people voted for Beto.  I wish there would have been a follow up on where from and how long ago they moved to TX?  Plus, this % broken down by TX location.
@AndrewSolender Only other one would be New York City, New York County, New York, right?
@andrewdamitio Janesville: An American Story by Amy Goldstein had a great examination of this in relation to the car factories shutting down in SE Wisconsin.  It was really sad.
@DonnyFerguson @EricKleefeld @longhornderek This shouldn't be totally surprising.  O'Rourke is from TX, Cruz isn't.  Plus, a lot of people move to TX because they hate living with liberals in CA/NY/IL/WA.
@IAmKrishanPatel seven counties in FL too, plus three that had more votes for Scott.
@IAmKrishanPatel Yup, It's the first four that beat out Kevin Cramer in ND, too.
@samknight_one @kept_simple Makes me want it to happen even more now.
@samknight_one God, what a joke.  So Tucker Carlson is a hate-crime protected individual, but LGBT aren't?  Wonderful country we have here.
@SenhorRaposa Alabama does that (unsurprisingly) and it's such a pain the ass
@samknight_one isn't this DC?  Isn't this the same place that overcharged all those inauguration day protestors?  Who makes those charging decisions?
@ChazNuttycombe Start with NY!
Seven, 7!, separate counties in California (LA, San Diego, San Diego, Santa Clara, San Bernandino, San Francisco, Alameda) had more votes for just Dianne Feinstein for CA-SEN than all of the votes for Tom Barraso (136K) in Wyoming cc:@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @AndrewSolender
@andrewdamitio Andrew these are great points.  If you lay groundwork (high-speed internet) and find ways to attract companies to your area, it would help the economy up and down.
@travisl_97 @JustCameron__ Or, you know, actually winning her race.
@ChazNuttycombe got to try - can't abandon it completely.  Just to start planting seeds and ground game for the future (nourishing local dem committees/parties/ground game)
@LizMair @dandrezner Sorry, Liz, McConnell is now on a re-election cycle.  Has to be totally subservient now.
@rudnicknoah God reading the comments is great as they get more and more despondent.
@zachary_godwin @theKingScribe how likely is that?  Aren't both those chambers gerry-mandered to hell too?
@theKingScribe Cooper better get reelected in '20 or this gets worse.
@theKingScribe So there are enough Dem votes that there should be a least three more Dems here than there actually are.
@POLITICO_Steve Darcy Burner remembers!
@MattOrtega Go look at Charlie Kirk's tweet about Young Kim, way more dumb
@emilyjodell @BFriedmanDC @AmarAmarasingam Why does your organization do this - so people can become more informed and don't stereotype people who adhere to Islamic law.  Perhaps maybe you should be a little more true the tenets or that organization and not stereotype people in the military.
@emilyjodell @BFriedmanDC @AmarAmarasingam This is your organization's mission statement is: "Working with a global team of editors, we provide a platform to house primary sources of Islamic law, organize the people to critically analyze them, and promote research to inform academic and public discourse about Islamic law"
Marsha Blackburn should be forced to watch this clip and only this clip for the rest of her life.  She is a heartless, soulless, evil human being. https://t.co/RPu8O37ky9
@DougJBalloon Furthermore, Trump wouldn't hire him unless he was absolutely sure he would take actions that conform with the words he previously expressed.
@DougJBalloon furthermore, the guy has already said what he believes - why not believe him?  We knew what Sessions said and believed about key issues before he became AG, and, lo and behold, he took policy actions that reflected what he previously said.  Why would Whitaker be any different?
@DougJBalloon what happened to this guy?  This was like Keith Olbermann's go to legal guy when he was still on MSNBC?
@rudnicknoah @poozer87 @NYSenDems To be fair, Simcha and his 8 IDC friends all accomplished the same thing politically so calling them all Simcha is fine by me.
@fawfulfan @NateSilver538 Gotta try, gotta try.  Can't ignore, let it slip away.  Dems did the same thing in Louisiana run-off last year.  Gotta compete, regardless of the projected outcome.
@AndrewSolender @SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel Well, Joaquin better get cracking.  Beto started his campaign about two months from now.  It took all of that effort to get within 3 point.  Maybe two more years, plus a good ticket at the top will pull it across the line.
@AndrewSolender Google is hard.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @AndrewSolender I have Amy Klobuchar's bio on my desk
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @AndrewSolender Should Beto run against Cornyn in 2020?  Just continue down his current path.  Cornyn's milquetoast and as detestable as Cruz in his own way.	https://t.co/kLeTKItsZY
@Stephynb They have definitely changed - I was at Sill as all the tank were being loaded to go Iraq in the fall of '02.  Also, my wife's first husband was killed in Iraq.  I saw the uptick in issues in HI as the deployments ground on in 05-07.  Too much time away from families hurt a lot.
@IAmKrishanPatel jeez - did you got to the hospital/urgent care?
@SenhorRaposa @PoliticsWolf @kkondik That might be the better option here.  May be an uphill fight, but it would be better than waiting to lose his eat in 2022.
@Hasneeeee @SenhorRaposa I hate abandoning an area, but money can help shore up WI/MI/PA and considering the two state-wide races are with 0.5% in FL, money/resources should be spent time now to get more ground game in Central/South FL
@IAmKrishanPatel I was wondering where you went last night
@Stephynb Right, but uninformed people will just say, "Cost of doing business." I mean even Trump blamed that Soldier from Florida last year for getting killed in Africa.  "He knew what he signed up for."  If people cared the would demand a modicum of oversight from their Reps on its use.
@JustCameron__ Lol it's better than the one VA need last year that led to a coin flip
@BFriedmanDC this terrible take makes me so f'ing mad - if America is so concerned with veterans with PTSD committing mass shooting, it should take a significant step of curtailing one of the major causes of PTSD - endless deployment cycles to war zones that no one knows why we are in anymore
@AdamWeinstein Adam, serving in NYARNG - have two full time chaplains that can help
@JustinWingerter @rudnicknoah OK the polling identified a surge and a toss-up, but why would Russell believe he was not in trouble before that? The nation was littered with toss-up races in the suburbs.  Wasn't there a strategist in his campaign that would want to head that off with aggressive campaigning?
@DemocraticLuntz I did some short-hand on this and LA, Orange, and San Diego Counties had more people vote for just Dianne Feinstein than the winning vote totals for Tom Barasso in WY or Kevin Cramer in ND.  I would gather four of the five NYC counties are the same way, and others in FL, PA, TX.
@rudnicknoah @JustinWingerter Again, media silo.  They believe everything Fox says and don't consider information sources that they consider "liberal".  How many Rs got knocked out because they didn't believe that they were in a race?
@CombatCavScout You know especially since our entire political apparatus is dedicated to keeping their wages low and making health care inaccessible and unaffordable.  And then shitting on them for complaining about it.
@DemocraticLuntz It’s about time.  There are still pockets of rich white people (see Newport, Coto de Caza, and Ladera Ranch), but as it got built up those Dem voters just kept moving in).
Hey, uhh, anyone know what the DNC and DSCC are going to do to help out Mike Espy? #MSSen
@joncprevo I wish there was a dislike button
@SenhorRaposa He’s delusional. This is what happens when you only stick in your own news silo.  Bad news never sleeps in.  Any half-sane person knew Comstock was drawing dead after the primaries.
@ChazNuttycombe HI GOP, CT GOP has to be up there of whiffing in that meatball last night, CA GOP for being unable to find two viable statewide candidates in a state that big.
Cc: @SenhorRaposa @JustCameron__  @joncprevo you guys see this yet? https://t.co/saf98565X0
@Atrios It’s sad because there’s a legitimate Ebola crisis that is invisible in the news now.  Oh the irony.
@EricKleefeld See...very fine people.
@JustCameron__ @HarleyRouda Wish I could have voted for Harley too.  My current district (NY-20) is about as safe D as safe D gets.
@JustCameron__ @HarleyRouda used to live in Laguna Niguel (Marina Hills) about 2 miles off the Crown Valley 405 exit
@JustCameron__ @HarleyRouda mine did not :(
@OryxMaps @rudnicknoah @HarleyRouda @DanaRohrabacher Sigh, of course my hometown area (Laguna Niguel) went red.  A community full of rich white people with immigrant baby sitters and house workers loves them some Trump.
@laraseligman SECDEF.  Kobach is AG.
@pwnallthethings Session fired
@AndrewSolender OK, NJ rules are if vacancy happens more than 30 days prior to primary (~June) than election is that November.  If it's after, it's the following November.  But Murphy gets to appoint an interim too, so Dems wouldn't be down a seat.
@AndrewSolender NY-27 and CA-50 are definite specials.
@EoinHiggins_ @cushbomb I tuned in late --- what happend?
@SenhorRaposa @DemocraticLuntz The soccer mom for whom the bell tolls
@AndrewSolender @Iddybud well, the new leg would help out Rose by forcing Cuomo to fix the NYC transportation infrastructure.  and help out Delgado by shoring up health care access since that's what pushed him over the line.
@AtticusGF i got the feeling she was absentee, but that's another outsider view
@Iddybud @AndrewSolender Well, she can still do it in 2020.
@AndrewSolender oh for Stephanie Miner's quixotic bid for gov.  She could have gotten Katko.
@lachlan @oneunderscore__ Graham
@daveanthony @leslieleeiii then they secretly complain on Gab that they feel oppressed and can't express their views.
@_BlueGeorgia_ I was the pilot sweating in the Airplane movie on this one.
@joncprevo You better get a picture with Gary Peters stat
@joncprevo OC official results have Rouda up by nearly 2700 with all precincts reporting.
@AndrewSolender Andrew.  No one wants that.
@RogerMisso @baseballhall @AN_Goldstein @2VetsUpstate oh, there's a really good restaurant you should try...Alex's Bistro, 149 Main Street
@AndrewSolender guess it didn't occur to him that the disapproval might be because the investigation hasn't taken him down yet.
@alexis_levinson Is she auditioning for a slot in the administration?  Blame everyone but yourself, Trump will like that.  She should go on Hannity or Fox and Friends to sell this message.  Trump will love seeing Sanford getting crapped on.
@mattdpearce 333 seats is a lot of seats.  It took Obama 8 years to lose over a 1000 and that required massive gerrymandering in states like WI, NC, MI, OH.
@AndrewSolender how would this mesh with all the different lines - have to get rid of those, right?
@SenhorRaposa @joncprevo Senate 'gerrymandering' I know it's not a thing, but DiFi (not counting KDL votes) got more votes in just LA county, just SD county, just Orange County, than Cramer got in ND or Barrasso got in winning a whole state.  That I think is the problem.
@williamadler78 @BrendanNyhan isn't this further proof of the Bush Theorem - that the floor for any bad politician, even a horrendous one, lies somewhere between 25-33% (where GWBs approval rate floated between 06 and 08)
@RogerMisso Where to now, Roger?
@woodruffbets @samstein Would be great if they could investigate how her SF-86 ended up in the hands Paul Ryan’s Super PAC.
@JMilesColeman I know.  I’m just enjoying the little election dessert of this win.  I appreciate the hard work as you plow through the data.
@JMilesColeman @JMilesColeman where’s the GA-6 map?  And the cross reference with Ossoffs performance last year
@kkondik This guy has it.  Going to be a great congressmen.
@thetrillbillies Don’t forget the four guys at the embassy in Benghazi.
@jteeDC @bimadew Normally I’d agree except  that particular candidate dropped and out endorsed Sinema.
@andrewdamitio Everyone blames Obama for losing 1000 over 8 years.  Now Trump lose one-third of that in 2 years.  Won't be hearing that later today, I'm sure.
@daveweigel @JustSchmeltzer flipped back.  Last precinct came in +971 for Hurd
@AndrewSolender put that in your story!! :)
@_BlueGeorgia_ All precincts are in according to TX SOS site.  She won unless there was a tabulation error
@IAmKrishanPatel @BetoORourke @GinaOrtizJones OMG what is happening???!!!!
@JustSchmeltzer @DanRather https://t.co/2E5j3WBtqF  All precincts reporting and Ortiz-Jones up by 282 votes.  What happened?
@JustSchmeltzer @DanRather Eric, on another note, its going to fun to watch Cuomo squirm now.
@rudnicknoah TX SOS site has Ortiz-Jones up by 280 votes.  Says four precincts in Bexar by Bexar Cty website says all precincts are in.
@JustSchmeltzer @DanRather Eric, even TX SOS site has Ortiz up by 280 votes.
@JustSchmeltzer @AJentleson Who is that in the Senate?
@Trillburne Kobach and Walker will live on in Trump's Cabinet here shortly
@cd_hooks you realize he's going to be the next AG after Trump fires Sessions, right?
@daveanthony @Trillburne Someone had to take over Jeff Flake's useless role as scold of Trump's behavior while doing nothing to actually stop it.
@lpolgreen You realize both will be in the Cabinet in the next 2-3 months, right?
@IAmKrishanPatel That soul sucking homunculus will be in the Cabinet by the end of the year.
@Johngcole Man, I live here, I can't believe he'll do it.
@joncprevo he should have kept his mouth shut during the Kavanaugh hearings. Silence is cheap.  Trying to extract your foot from your mouth is hard.
@HumanistReport this happy horseshit has got to end.
@politico_chris @MinnesotaDFL Thank goodness, there was a time last year after Dayton was sick and Smith was appointed to replace Franken that MN looked like a Repub trifecta
@joncprevo Jim Himes is going to have to step up to the plate on this one.
@rudnicknoah Oh he's back from his Florida Man account?
@AndrewSolender Hunter next?
@AndrewSolender ?
@SenhorRaposa we've always been at war with EastAsia
@DemocraticLuntz @rudnicknoah But this is Republican-world, he will be promoted to AG to replace Sessions by Friday.  And every asshole Repub in Congress will vote for him.
@ArmyStrang I don't understand why he's so clueless sometimes.  He correctly states that Repubs are screwing things up on almost every podcast, but seems surprised when they do something especially heinous.  I don't know why - there's ample evidence at this point for him not to be surprised.
@AndrewSolender @FiveThirtyEight @spmaloney stupid jerk just had to run for AG.  Blame Cuomo for this one if it goes south.  He got Maloney to run to mess with Teachout
@SenhorRaposa @AndrewSolender Abigail Spanberger!
@McFaul Sec of Ag in next Dem administration
@DKElections Max was a great candidate and he focused on transportation infrastructure which is an even bigger disaster than it is in Manhattan/Brooklyn
@joncprevo Harris and Travis Counties have only early vote in - no day of yet.  That might be important
@AndrewSolender DDHQ has Stabeow up by 11% with 22.9%.  NYT only reporting 20%
@SenhorRaposa OK, NYT is only at 20%, DDHQ is ahead.  Too many screens and tabs!
@SenhorRaposa what is going on in MIchigan?  STabenow is down?!
@IAmKrishanPatel Krishan - this is great news!  Max is an awesome guy.  This is spectacular.  Makes up for losing VA-5
@DemocraticLuntz @JustCameron__ Damn it Gore did win Florida
@CombatCavScout WA-8 and UT-4, AZ and NV-SEN too
@CombatCavScout Especially my peeps in California - we need you out there in -10, -25, -39, -45, -48, -49, -50
@AndrewSolender @MaxRose4NY Does this make up for a loss in VA-5?
@AndrewSolender @DemocraticLuntz @MaxRose4NY @dandonovan_ny god, max winning would be great!
@AndrewSolender Donnelly out in IN?  I almost threw up
@AndrewSolender @SherrodBrown But I thought we had all seen a poll with Renacci at 56%
@AndrewSolender @AmyMcGrathKY @Ojeda4congress DDHQ calls VA-10 for Wexton!
@SenhorRaposa why do people say stuff like this - it's not that hard to get to 538 or Cook or RCP now?
@AndrewSolender I was up late for that one.  God I hope Danny pulls it out.
@AndrewSolender khakis!  Don't forget the khakis!
@ActorAaronBooth 2 minutes?  Is that a record?
@AndrewSolender Computer, Ipad, and phone.  It's madness I can't remember which tab is where.
@AndrewSolender @CNN Think Elian Gonzalez
@kenklippenstein did you make sure your brothers Brian and Ed voted, too?
@ryangrim I say we take the USS Missouri out of mothballs and make this clown sign on its deck.
@ryangrim Ryan, spot on here.  Compete everywhere, build coalitions/communities/organizations that exist outside of election time so that capacity exists to fight every legislative district in each state and nationally.  You know, kind of like Obama for America was supposed to do.
@JustSchmeltzer @JordanUhl I cackled out loud - this is almost as good as Triumph demolishing Ted Cruz
@AndrewSolender @ClareMalone Better be the Day 1 bill in NY State Assembly/Senate to expand access and increase resources for voting in NY - early voting, same-day registration, etc.
@ryangrim @CoryGardner I can't imagine a more 'drawing dead' Senate Candidate, except for that time John Ashcroft lost to the deceased Mel Carnahan.  That was funny.
@SenhorRaposa Why is this a thing?
@AndrewSolender yup
@AndrewSolender lol, saw your other tweet about London - come on, you know were all going to be up waiting to see if Don Young's career is over/Mark Begich becomes governor
@AndrewSolender I'm about 90 minutes out.  Gotta finish work and then head home.  Trying to hold off a sense of doom/joy until later.
@ZoeTillman @NAACP_LDF @JohnHMerrill Translation - I'm running against Doug Jones in 2020.  I can cheat as much as Brian Kemp.
@AndrewSolender Are you having rum already?
@dandrezner Will he be covering the effects of Jeffrey Goldberg's open cheerleading for the Iraq War had on our current political environment?  Or better yet, how Goldberg suffered zero consequences for such disastrous judgment?
@EricBoehlert bodes well for how he would run the state.
@base10 @mattdpearce yes
@PresidentBraden @graveyjones5 @phanthanhtom @baseballot You won't because the state is so gerry-mandered there is no chance a Dem could win Districts 1-6 or Repub to win District 7.  There isn't a Non-Safe Race there and there won't be.
@JustCameron__ I listened to a report that Orange County, CA stops counting absentee and mail-in votes until all after Election Day votes are counted - which makes sense from a categorization perspective (trying to keep track of early vs. day of voting).  Maybe the same in AZ?
@SenhorRaposa He doesn't know who Josh Hawley is, couldn't pick him out of a line-up.  Could have been told some random janitor was Josh Hawley and he would have believed it.
@SenhorRaposa Why are they trying to make James a thing?  I don't understand.  Why aren't they touting Cramer or even Hawley more?
@david_j_roth @jaketapper Do you think Jake got a memo from The Big Giant Centrist that picked him to be on 'Both Sides Watch' today?
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe @politicsluo Oh yeah, getting rid of MacArthur would make my day.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe @politicsluo Just tying to get an idea of what to look at in that early window.  I don’t start work for DDHQ until TX closes (doing -10 and -11)
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe @politicsluo So what’s the earliest race house wise that might lead to some indication one way or another?  VA-2/5?
@SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah @ChazNuttycombe @politicsluo is KY-6 really the bell-weather for the early night since it should be the first to come in?  Is there a result there percentage wise that bodes well for Dems to carry thorough?  Or Is her winning enough?
@SenhorRaposa in poll closing order: KY-6, IN-SEN, OH-12, WV-3, NC-9, NY-19, OH-GOV
@radleybalko where's the all of the above button?
@rudnicknoah I mean, every day I see another tweet about the value of the Reid turn-out machine in Nevada.  Invest in standing organizations that will leverage community outreach throughout the years between elections is vital.
@rudnicknoah again, people are vastly underrating candidates who put in work on the ground plant seeds for future victories.  McBath is using the networks Ossoff built to capitalize on the favorable environment.  Smart Dems in Texas will do the same, whether Beto wins or loses.
@pattymo Gee Eric, what type if fear is it playing off of?  He just does it troll us.  He can't be this obviously clueless - That burning cross on your lawn, it's arson, but it's not racist.  The noose hanging from your tree is a poor decorating choice, not a symbol of racist terror.
@daveanthony I would really like B to pass just to get the first tent pole in the ground on public banks.
@SenhorRaposa They should include the Nazi running in IL-3 just to be inclusive.  Also, I thought Republicans hated inclusivity and diversity.
@SenhorRaposa Lastly, they should be true to form and just include the Nazi running on their ticket in IL-3.
@SenhorRaposa Also, why no Cathy McMorris-Rogers?
@SenhorRaposa I mean good heavens Stefanik and Noem were in Congress for the last two years and the Republican Party did nothing to elevate them.  What the fresh hell!!!  I don't get the inclusion of Faso?  Let's elect another middle-aged, white man - that'll make Repubs more inclusive.
@SenhorRaposa It's amazing - why wouldn't you pick a Republican you KNOW can attract  Democratic voters like Baker and Scott and Hogan instead of people who  can't win without a decided party registration advantage.
@JordanUhl The nerve of a Democrat running to shore up his base and try to activate non-voters with a popular progressive message.  Why is it always Democrats that have to tack to the right to win voters?  Especially when even mildly progressive policies are popular in red areas of TX.
@JustCameron__ has he endorsed any female Republican candidates (other than Martha Blackburn).  I don't remember one for McSally...
@adamjohnsonNYC The global order has been dedicated to overthrowing their government since 1980 and had overthrown their government in the 60s and then installed a corrupt, oppressive dictator after that.  I wonder why they would have a problem with it.
@NateSander1 @SenhorRaposa Just further reinforced that Beltway Media always defaults to Republican talking points.  ALWAYS, without fail.
@SenhorRaposa Do you have any historical data from Nov/Dec 16 on the chances that Cook/Sabato/et al gave Dems of being +2 Senate seats after 2018?
@kitkat9301 @pareene Even if the special would have been held tomorrow, there would have been zero chance that Christie's appointment votes against Kavanaugh.
@CrispinBurke To me, this reasoning smacks of, "Imagine what we could do training-wise if we didn't have to worry about getting Soldiers to their families each night"
@SenhorRaposa a hold here probably means 50-50 (lose ND, pick-up AZ/NV), but leaves possibility of a Beto or Bredesen upset to get to 51 right?
@kitkat9301 @pareene The Dem governor can appoint his replacement - not sure when the special would be (in 2019 or in 2020).  That's why it was so important Murphy won because there was a period late last year that Menendez could be convicted and Christie would have been able to appoint a replacement
@Lkatzenberg and the corruption and attitude of the POTUS drifts down to the lower rungs of the administration like a foul fog.  See the man with his picture on your wall attacking perceived enemies at all times makes it seem OK for some faceless bureaucrat to do the same.
@lukerosiak You're kidding with this right?  Rick Perry handed out tax breaks like dinner mints to get all sorts of company to move to Texas from other states.  Isn't that a use of government resources in the pursuit of job?  Or is this kind of action only bad if a Democrat does it?
@SolidVerbal ACA'CEDRIC WARE, USC
@samknight_one Wasn’t she on chapo once?  What happened?
@ReignofTroy It was BS, I rewound that play and when Alene dived the RB was still in bounds.  Dynamite refereeing there.
@2VetsUpstate @DelgadoforNY19 YES!!!!!!!!
@SenhorRaposa Check out Baghdad Bob over here
@CrispinBurke Yeah this is really bad.  Where are the soft caps and LBV.  There’s not one officer and or CSM who doesn’t realize how crappy this looks.  This is really a low point.
@pptsapper This women is in the running to replace Ruth Baden Ginsburg.  Is she serious or just performing for Trump?
@classywarfare 21st regiment carried a gimlet (a small sword looking thing) that was really only worn during COC ceremonies, but 27th reg has an actual wolfhound that they trot out.  It’s great.
@classywarfare Something related to the existing regimental crest perhaps?
@IAmKrishanPatel @politico_chris @Barrow4Georgia imagine the good Barrow could do reversing all the damage Brian Kemp and decades of Republican voter persecution have wrought.
@politicsluo Punishing the poor of our adversaries in the most theatrical way possible to own the libs.  What a morally bankrupt man.
@EoinHiggins_ This theatrical shittiness - "POOR PEOPLE OF OUR ADVERSARIES - PREPARE TO BE PUNISHED FOR THE MISDEEDS WE PERCEIVE YOUR GOVERNMENT ARE COMMITTING AND WE ARE GOING TO BE OVERLY DRAMATIC ABOUT IT TO OWN THE LIBS."
@ArmyStrang Need specifics - is joining now or is he joining in '05-'06 when the  Army was enlisting guys who would spray section equipment in a connex with the door closed?
@zombieassbutt Why is that shirt so long?  Is it a onesie?
@ArmyStrang Shut it PAO - you know shoveling shit is your job!
@soonergrunt @CNN Oh you missed his face turn.  Trump pushed him to it
@SenhorRaposa Losing
@SenhorRaposa SACRILEGE!!!! You besmirch the good names of the York Peppermint Patty and Junior Mints.
@SenhorRaposa you better clarify...In leaf form or wrapped in chocolate?
@joncprevo actually having someone who lives in a district as a candidate is important to winning
@tcwittes And it probably worked.  Trump is too dumb to know and Pompeo is too Islamophobic to care to correct the lie.
@SenhorRaposa how many of people voting even know who Schumer is?  This is so stupid.  At least fall back on socialism or some other stupid trope.  Typical DC insider myopia
@JustSchmeltzer @ForecasterEnten @NateSilver538 I feel like the media is ready to jump on the Split Decision argument even if Dems win House and go to 50-50 in the Senate, with no look back to what the Senate map looked like in late November 2016 (defending 9 seats in Trump-won states).  It's ridiculous that Senate is in play
@rudnicknoah yeah that was my thought when I saw this comment, but I didn't want my mentions to explode by responding.
@joncprevo I'll be sure to add Rod Blum's name to my submissions to the next volume of "Profiles in Political Courage"
@esnjay So, forget to get a new sign or got a sign with a wrong year?
@nycsouthpaw Cool, cool, so a southern state has enshrined in its hate crimes law an indirect incentive for hate crimes perpetrators to ensure they kill their victims.  Sounds like an issue that needs to be addressed.
@Cianaf they picked even bigger buffoon than Hue - I mean, just wow.
@willsommer The building description right out of the recent Sean Parnell novel, Man of War.  I wonder if he plagiarized it.
@AndrewSolender @DelgadoforNY19 @FiveThirtyEight @MonmouthPoll @JohnFasoNy not surprising given the astonishingly high level of racist dog whistles in Faso's ads
@rudnicknoah Well, crap like this worked to bring down the Kerry in '04.  They think it can work because it has worked.  See also Shirley Sherrod.
@politicobsessed This is the ultimate of example of, "Just because you have a forum/space to write things, doesn't mean you should."
@MichaelCastFS If only there were some sort of documentary video evidence, perhaps a TV show, that showed what kind of head coach Hue is and how much a horrible manager of people he is...I would call something like that Hard Knocks.
@XOofXOs Remember, minimum TIG for O5 to be promoted to O6 is only three years as opposed to four year for O3 to O4 and O4 to O5, so things happen a little bit faster.
@elivalley They left Elliott Broody on their board of directors.  Says a lot about their morality
@DemocraticLuntz @Nate_Cohn Is OR-5 in danger or do we just not know?
@IAmKrishanPatel I would take most joy in CA-50/NY-27/NY-11/MT-AL (using Cook's ratings)
@rudnicknoah More like Ragamuffin Polls, amirite?  (I'll see myself out)
@MichaelCastFS Vastly overrating the 2011 10-2 season.  Outside of that Kiffin was 16-13 and 10-8 in P12.
@MichaelCastFS Really?  They went 7-6 in '12 and lost to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl.  Gave up almost 70 in the game he got fired.  Picked the wrong back up QB (Wittek over Kessler), reverse nepotism for his dad's awful defense.
@rudnicknoah +2 among women when every other poll has him down double digits?  How is this considered reputable?
@robrousseau Fascist leader or lively communicator? You Make the call;  Fascism comes to power - how can your leading privately owned corporations profit from the despotism and the inevitable massacre of innocent Brazilians....
@AndrewSolender @floridaguy267 fact-free living
@AndrewSolender @floridaguy267 Same as the unskew the polls guy from ‘12.
@Cianaf I heard it was a remote booth.  Crew in NY not in London.
@AndrewSolender Unless your opponent is Rob Woodall
@Local24Jessica @PenguinOfTroy Happened to me today.  Was out at 24-7, came back at 28-24 and out after the 4 and 1 TD
@JMizzle36 @B_M_Finnigan Right but it means 50-50 because NJ Dems nominated a crook.
@ReignofTroy I remember that clearly.  I was living on a second floor apartment and my downstairs neighbors were very angry with my screaming during the first half of that game.
@B_M_Finnigan Why is this shocking?  Can we please compare age with employment status?  Young people have jobs or are trying to avoid losing them.  Taking a random day off to vote as opposed to voting on the actually recognized Election Day makes a difference.
@adamjohnsonNYC I want a short story compendium on each of these patches and the hat and they relation with Rauner personally.
@MichaelCastFS @PenguinOfTroy if USC cleans house coach wise, do they start like UCLA next year (0-5 and 2-6)?
@SolidVerbal But really McVey #1, Chris Peterson’s on the list.  Bryan Harsin from Boise, Pat Fitzgerald, Jeff Monken from Army, Jeff Fisher and Jack Del Rios PR teams will definitely make it look like they got talked to.
@SolidVerbal The bigger question is if Nick Saban will use this to squeeze another mil a year out of Alabama.
@DanRubenstein @DanGreenspan No, the best is when it’s capped by an 1159ET kick for Hawaii at home.  Closest you can come to pure adrenaline.  You get all the TV games and then a tailgate and then Aloha Stadium serves frozen margaritas (or did). Best capper involved Boise returning blocked PAT to win 44-41.
@ShakerSamman Two choices: go as Scott Bakula in Quantum Leapx.  You can go as literally anyone.  Or just strap a piece of paper on saying: “Error 404 - costume not found”
@AndrewSolender And there’s no way those armed guards would ever become the enforcers of some oppressive regime in the future, controlling access to all sorts of public space to whomever the powers that be decide is undesirable
@joncprevo Pritzker in IL to appoint Duckworths replacement. Walz in MN to replace Klobuchar, Cordray to replace Brown, Polis to replace Bennet, Brown to replace Merkeley, already have Murphy/Northam to replace Booker/Kaine/Warner.
@joncprevo I’m more convinced than ever that it’s going to take a coalition of top Dems to fix this.  Need top flight people in every elected and cabinet position.  More important than ever to have dem gots to replace senators moving up....
@B_M_Finnigan Against all odds Dems hold all Trump state seats, win AZ and NV but lose NJ.
@kenklippenstein It better be the 2020 Dem nominee better make it an explicit part of their platform that they will pursue criminal action against her.  No high level prosecutions for Iran-Contra, Iraq War better not be repeated.
The GS Warriors made me cackle three times.  With 7:46 left in 4Q Knicks led 94-93.  With 2:04 left, GSW leads 121-100.  Durant made thee contested shots including 2 3s and when he missed long rebound to Curry for wide open 3.  Poetry in motion.  Also, GSW 47-16 in 4Q.
@ArmyStrang It’s an M777, the lightweight 155mm howitzer.  It’s towed by a brace under the front of the tube instead of the rear like the old 155 or the  105
@IAmKrishanPatel @FiveThirtyEight @GinaRaimondo He is.  I was in RI for a week this summer and again over Labor Day.  He was making no traction anywhere.  Small sample size but I should have at least picked up some sense of head momentum.  Crickets.
@fawfulfan Worse, he’s in the military, too. So ashamed.
@_BlueGeorgia_ Does that team have polling averages?  Does it adjust for house effects of polls?
@SenhorRaposa They'll all setting things up to deny the results of the election and claim voter fraud.  Also, too, don't remember them trumpeting early votes when Clinton appears to be ahead in '16
@rudnicknoah Cool, gotta spend that campaign money somehow - frankly it would make more headlines if he just burned it in front of his campaign HQ.  I didn't even know whose Gottheimer's opponent was until just now.
@AN_Goldstein Excess of young men is basically the plot of the last Chuck Palahniuk, Adjustment Day.  Also, too, a gender lens is important, pushing women into conversation/discussion/analysis is needed, because men will miss things like that.
@AndrewSolender @RRHElections Look at it this way, in 2016, NYC won the five NYC counties by 1.67 million votes (2.16M to 494K).  She won every other county combined by 66.5K votes (2.391M to 2.324M).  To have a moderate R win, you would need to make the five boroughs look like upstate.  Good luck with that.
@BobbyBigWheel Wait does this mean MAGA heads will start liking soccer to defend this guy and own the libs.  That should be fun
BLIMP! now.  BLIMP! in the future. BLIMP! forever.
@ArmyStrang It’s worse than you think they are 25 AND 26 series now.  Apparently their awesomeness could not be contained in a single number.
@SenhorRaposa Does Ojeda run if he wins this year?  Does he run if loses?  Does he beat Swearingen?  Does he beat Blankenship?  Does he beat Capital?
@ArmyStrang I mean if the border patrol is looking for help in processing asylum claims, I'm sure we can send down some HR Support Companies that could train up pretty quickly.  We could also mobilize a water company and some field feeding teams to feed them once they get across.
@TankCPTNemo @RonDeSantisFL I’d say Gillium was more like the alien ships in Independence Day.  He moved in slowly, settled over his target, and then simply erased DeSantis from existence.
@RogerMisso Never heard that one before.  How do we break that hold?
@RogerMisso We’re never going to get anything done in this state.  There’s got to a way to break this down.  We’re basically governed like we’re a purple state.
@EoinHiggins_ She will be THE queen for “PC culture run amok” for every right wing web site, podcast, web show and tv show.
@aravosis I was thinking about that report and it’s aftermath this morning
@Atrios I just don’t understand.  I live a mile from the HS she graduated from.  I’ve lived here for 8 years.  My in-laws have lived here for nearly 40.  They graduated from that high school.  There was never a time blackface was OK here.  Mondale and Dukakis won this are, FFS
@JustCameron__ Finally
@joncprevo @mcimaps To me it has symmetry to what republicans say about the lower class, that they choose to be lower class by their actions.  Maybe DeSantis should take responsibility for his actions if those actions lead racists to think he is racist.
@politicsluo Coakley lost by 4
@RogerMisso Too true
@politicsluo Angle and Mourdock only lost by 6 points.  Akin by 15.
@ChazNuttycombe Holy hell.  If only every trumpy a-hole folded like this as soon as left the Fox bubble and had to interact with reality
@RogerMisso Jeez go to the local high school and pick up a couple of desks.  It would make either of them look any more ridiculous than they do here.
RT @gelliottmorris: Today in Russia, 5 members of the opposition party and a media org were targeted in a series of attempted bombings. New…
@CapehartJ Really?  He blurted up Top Secret Source in ISIS of an allied country in the Oval Office to the Russian Ambassador just to show off.  He will brag about anything to make to prop up his massive ego.
@SenhorRaposa I live a mile from the high school where she graduated.  There is absolutely zero chance my community would let blackface fly.  My mother-in-law went to that high school and I know that wouldn't have been tolerated then.  Albany County went for Clinton in 96 by 33 points!!!
@NormOrnstein But Both Sides!!! Stacy was around when a flag got burned! /snark
Cool, cool: Cocaine Mitch gets and Lyin' Ted get yelled at during dinner: Oh where is my civility, Dems are a mob!  Bombs at Clinton and Obama: BOTH SIDES!!!
@CrispinBurke CIVILITY NOW!  CIVILITY NOW!
@ArmyStrang WTF?  WTF? MF'er WTF?  She had to write a whole memo apologizing for her racism.  God forbid she had to face some actual consequences for her racism.  Instead, she will continue to make 7 figures that could easily be plowed into real journalistic enterprises at NBC.
@AN_Goldstein I literally can't even with these.  I would love for Republicans to run one ad not full of distortion and lies.
@AN_Goldstein I think the this Faso ad with Antonio Delgado in a hoodie is high on the list, too https://t.co/TtkFJpggyQ
@MichaelCastFS Totally agree with that.  We can’t scheme a single crossing route over the LBs and under the safeties, especially with Tyler’s and Amon-Ra’s speed?  And we can’t find a single way to get any TE open?
@ArmyStrang Oh my god, traffic Armageddon.  The 101 is the worst possible freeway for that to happen on.
@JustSchmeltzer God it really is going to be a race between Thomas Gorsuch and Kavanaugh over who is going to be the worst, reactionary justice.
@ArmyStrang if you wait long enough (2-3 months), they'll just send you a check with the money.
@ArmyStrang So, we're at the point were Megyn's role is to let Baby-Boomer housewives not feel bad about the racism in their past instead of confronting it.  Can someone PLEASE tell what the constituency for her continue in this role?
@SolidVerbal Alabama should be declared Universal Champion after going 13-0, then the playoff should be whoever finishes 2-5 in the rankings.
@AN_Goldstein @commondefense Think you and Roger can get him on the podcast?
@neeratanden @fawfulfan This is how you build infrastructure for 2020 (Trump and Cornyn) as well as finding a way to beat Dan Patrick in 2022.
@AN_Goldstein @commondefense @AN_Goldstein do you think he can win?  I’m too far north (NY-20) to see anything other than the commercials.  It’s so close.
@VOBOE @AN_Goldstein @GinaAHarkins Her choice is what matters some jerk’s comment who doesn’t read an article close enough.
@VOBOE @AN_Goldstein @GinaAHarkins Okay thanks for correcting me.  I honestly didn’t see that.
@GinaAHarkins @AN_Goldstein What’s with the picture...she’s a highly qualified Marine and we get a picture of her in a bikini?
@JustSchmeltzer @AndrewGillum Totoally agree.  To quote Coach Yoast from Remember the Titans: Run it up.  Leave no doubt.  Especially since Gillums coattails could bring home Nelson and some toss-up D’s in the House
@brianbeutler Her pre-existing condition is her grandfather trying to steal her health care to give Sheldon Adelson another Tax cut
@DrewVanDrese @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe @SenhorRaposa @mcimaps @joncprevo @rudnicknoah @ActorAaronBooth @politicsluo Yeah it was sad to watch from afar.  Was also stationed in Hawaii under Linda Lingle.  Now finally settled in Safe D (NY-20)
@DrewVanDrese @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe @SenhorRaposa @mcimaps @joncprevo @rudnicknoah @ActorAaronBooth @politicsluo The inestimable Ron Packard, who retired in 2000.  That district went on to be represented by Issa, Chris Cox, John Campbell and now Dana.  A murders row of corruption.
@BFriedmanDC Only if she gives up her seat to run and lose
@DrewVanDrese @IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe @SenhorRaposa @mcimaps @joncprevo @rudnicknoah @ActorAaronBooth @politicsluo Fact about me:  I got my service academy nomination from CA-48 circa 1997/8.  No cheating - name the congressman.
@ChazNuttycombe @SenhorRaposa @mcimaps @joncprevo @rudnicknoah @ActorAaronBooth @politicsluo @IAmKrishanPatel over/under 1 on CA50, NY27 flip
@BFriedmanDC @MaxRose4NY I love Max.  Worked with him and he’s a great officer and leader.
@IAmKrishanPatel Valadao, Comstock, Paulsen, Royce, Curbelo, Coffman, Knight, Walters, Issa, Roskam, Ros-Lehtinen, McSally, and Denham.  Terribly Henry Cueller is worse than Hurd
@IAmKrishanPatel I would say he would be the last moderate but he has a trump score of 95.7 and a trump +/- of 34.8.  That’s 14th highest amongst House s.  Every R above him is retiring, leaving, losing or close to losing except David Valadao.
@ChrisVernonShow Evergreen tweet
@MSMollinedo So where does he go from here if he loses?  What is he doing in 2020? Is he running?  If he’s not and a Dem wins, is he in the Cabinet?  If so, where?
@BlutoTweets Jeez, well it should make easier on Day 0 of Ranger School now.  Used to be they’d just not count 40 or so and out you go.  Now they can tag you for form in the throw and the tucks.
@SenhorRaposa Yes, VA Senate (redistricting), Kentucky Governor (Medicaid Expansion), Louisiana (hold serve as Governor), and Mississippi (Solid Dem Gov candidate).  There's a lot to talk about - and if the media covers these, they can say that they aren't coastal-focused elites.
@fawfulfan don't forget the "office worker" that the black girl had to present her ID to after voting was also white.  Either they don't care or they wanted the dog-whistle to be loud and clear.
@joncprevo yeah, no coattails in Texas from the governor race since Beto is outperforming Valdez by 10 or more points.  So coattails would have to be his, if they existed.
@joncprevo Jon, not knowledgeable about how different models work, but would 538's model include an interrelated/down-ballot effect in its House model or is this just no way to do that?
@SolidVerbal Has there ever been a bigger discrepancy between how a team feels about its head coach and that coach's actual record as there is with Clay Helton and USC: two-double digit win seasons, two Big 6 bowls in first 2 seasons, and most likely another double-digit win season?
@mcbyrne @JustSchmeltzer We saw what Republicans would do - look at the cause celeb that scumbag Dinesh D'Souza became even though Obama had nothing to do with his prosecution.
@mcimaps I think people did not understand how much the tax scam would hurt New  Jersey.  The loss of the property tax exemptions is hurting Repubs.   Would also make sense why NY-01/02/11 are not SOLID R.  Would also be  interested to see how the high prop value areas of NY19 turn out.
@FPWellman @BryantJordan No, plane crash, don't forget about a plane crash
@rudnicknoah Noah, I’ve been wondering this myself but haven’t had time to do analysis.  What was the drop off from Obama ‘12 to Clinton ‘16 in Obama-Clinton counties, both in raw votes and percentage?  Then what will be differences in Trump-Stabenow/Brown/Baldwin/Casey?
@rudnicknoah @Callahan4Oregon I saw that yesterday.  Can he get it to a toss up with two more crappy polls?
@politicsluo I've worked with Max.  He's great!  He's earned a Bronze Star and Purple Heart during his tour.  Would make a great Congressman.
@mcimaps perhaps this was the reason for his kavanaugh statement?
@JustSchmeltzer Nope, consequences only apply to decade old actions taken by Democrats.
@joncprevo Politico shouldn't allow anonymous Dem strategists to continue to lob stupid self-defeating grenades like this.
@joncprevo What a shit-show of an article.  Direct quotes from Kellyanne Conway (NOT A DEMOCRAT) doing her usual gas-lighting, Brian Fallon (ex-Clinton spokesman) supporting Warren, the FORMER chair of the Iowa Democratic Party, and an anonymous quote.
@theJackVaughan @joncprevo regardless, to quote Beto: 'True to form'
@joncprevo Is this the official Tennessee GOP account or the fake Russian one?
@kedisonjr @JustSchmeltzer @kenvogel I have a strong suspicion that you've chanted 'Lock Her Up' once or twice and believe that the Clintons killed Vince Foster with the absence of any evidence.
@SenhorRaposa That guy didn't watch shit.
@JustSchmeltzer @kenvogel Or maybe Nikki Haley could really make a stand and resign now instead of December?  Or Mattis could say something since Trump has already effectively fired him by calling him a Democrat?
@JustSchmeltzer @kenvogel Cool, I love the fact that the President (and by association the VP) and the five ranking man in line to the President are actively aiding and abetting the coverup of a murder right in front of our eyes and nothing will happen.  Anyone in Congress want to do something?
@pptsapper My lasting memory of M777: I was the BN Maintenance Officer for first Army unit to get the M777 (2-11 FA in Hawaii) .  They shipped them over by boat and the salt air corroded all of the many rubber hoses on all 18 guns.  Field tm had to ship a complete BN of hoses from Picatinny
@XOofXOs Belvoir is pretty good too, especially down by the water.  Got to have one of the last Officer's Clubs.
@Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing @Callahan4Oregon the 538 model I mean
@EoinHiggins_ or good old Woodrow hiding behind JFK over there...
@Politics_Polls @GravisMarketing @Callahan4Oregon This is the only poll for this district in the model and it decreased the chances of victory for Schrader from 99% to 84%.  He puts out two more like this and suddenly it's a toss-up due to zero other polling and boom narrative - polling intelligensia, is this a valid poll?
@MollyJongFast It’s worse because his opponent is Christian.  He’s the disgusting racist frat bro we always thought he was when he started vaping in a congressional hearing.
@conor64 @dandrezner Her belief is that Americans value American life born or unborn.  If your brown and a kid, into that cage with you, or you happen to live in Yemen, here’s some bombs on your head.
@SenhorRaposa A natural outgrowth of Republican fact free living.  No evidence of something means that something exists.
@agingerssoul I really do hate that army hasn’t found a good model for ILE for part timers.  They’ve tried multiple models, but it still comes down to at least a year of grad school level reading and synthesis and there’s not even a masters degree at the end of it.
@agingerssoul In hindsight this tweet by me deserves the same punishment
@agingerssoul I thought I warned you against it.  Everyone I know who takes it hates it.  At least the DL version is self paced
@JustSchmeltzer @davidsirota No, listen to the This American Life episodes about Flake.  He is a politician who doesn’t know how to use political power.  He has the ability to throw the brakes on everything he moans about but is unwilling to throw sand in the gears to get what he wants.
@ReignofTroy I’m still awake in NY.  I believe it took 20 minutes to get from 5:00 to 3:40.  The game wouldn’t end.
@RogerMisso @pptsapper @august_cole I’d contribute an Army HR story to this!
@BA_Friedman LETHALITY is what we do on Army time.  Massive time wasting public relations is what  occurs on Soldiers’ time
@The_Viking95 @SenhorRaposa How many seats did a ten point win net democrats on this map?  Did they have even half?
@BFriedmanDC It’s like bizarro Ron Burgandy—unsubtle sexual comments followed by pseudo-intellectual drivel.
@MSMollinedo Because establishment people love nothing more than a formerly liberal commentator who punches left hard, with bonus Islamophobia
@ChrisVernonShow Jason can do all of things necessary to win a championship except design a winning game plan, scheme ways to take advantage of his two best players (Dak and Zeke), do something other than clap, enforce discipline, manage personnel, sign key free agents...
@SenhorRaposa Ed Cox prefers more low-key methods of intimidation, like purging voter rolls or simply not processing voter registrations or closing polling places or strict voter ID.
@ArmyStrang I'm sure that airman processing paperwork over at the air base certainly protected the hell out of the kids at Columbine or Sandy Hook or Parkland.
@S1Your @SGMtheMan1 Interest in Soldiers?  Bestill my heart.
@AN_Goldstein Ranks in the bottom third of three NCOs I senior rate.
Gee, I wonder where Mike Flynn and Erdogan got the idea that Trump wouldn’t object to kidnapping that Turkish cleric in Pennsylvania. https://t.co/APYPpd5Ma2
@mcimaps Shouldn’t she be angling for a run against Rubio?
@IAmKrishanPatel I left CA when Daddy Hunter was still around, so I haven't been subjected to the son.  I have to deal with random drivel from Peter King now.
@IAmKrishanPatel This is light-weight, go look up what Duncan Hunter said about his opponent with an Arabic name, even though said opponent is Christian.
@BFriedmanDC GTFU - what in holy hell is this?  I guess we've just memory-holed the  fact that he is the primary reason 5000 vets are DEAD unnecessarily!   And the million Iraqi civilian!  How are we  honoring him?  Wait, he gave Michelle Obama a mint.
@AndrewSolender check his twitter feed - he's on one of hardball or 11th hour once a week or so.
@pblest What propaganda! What publication was this from?  The communists made Pinochet murder all his people?  Guess we shouldn't be surprised - every Republicans uses the same excuse about supporting Trump.  Look what you leftists made me do, but I'm ignoring right-wingers killers.
@AndrewSolender He’s been never trumping for awhile now.  Regularly on MSNBC.  Hasn’t written the Nichols/Boot memo yet.  Still trying to do some bipartisan stuff in FL.
@SenhorRaposa Sheila Jackson Lee has some defense background in her committee work
@SenhorRaposa Yes.
@SenhorRaposa KY SOS does business stuff and manages land grants.  Maybe move her into Lincoln’s slot and move Lincoln to Labor
@SenhorRaposa Also Gwen Graham
@SenhorRaposa Jim Clyburn from SC?
@SenhorRaposa Terri Sewell from Alabama?
@SenhorRaposa What about Allison Grimes from Kentucky?
@politicsluo Or worse if he became too sick and the republica senate majority leader took over.  That was a thing for awhile.  Instant trifecta
@RogerMisso @CollocaEstate Love that place.  Went to a wedding there last summer.  Such a great place to spend a day with nice weather
@YahooForde If college football could be distilled into an essence, I’d want that play to be it.
@KT_So_It_Goes Never Trump conservative mantra was always going to be “Look what you strident liberals made me do.”  They are never accountable for their own actions.  What vapid cowards.  Also, Erick Erickson’s side is not the one I want to be on.
@XOofXOs But knowing what an S1 is supposed to do and which ones are a basic S1 and which ones a graduate level S1 is important.  Having served as one gives a unique understanding of that difference.
@XOofXOs Also, you can an appreciation for who is bad at being an S1.  You can figure out substandard S2s, S3s, and S4s even without having served as one because their mistake manifest quickly (getting smoked during an OPFOR scenario, missed chow in the field, etc.)...
@XOofXOs XO it is an invaluable experience for sure (served as IBCT S1 from 2011-2013).  You gain a new understanding for the importance of administrative SOPs and the value of quality NCOs at the lower levels who process awards.  You also find out who cares about their subordinates.
@Where_is_Puff Don’t you fly large multi engine aircraft?  How do we square this circle?
@keelyismyname I got to enjoy Sosh as a player in and around that ‘88 dodgers championship team when I was a kid and loved him then.  Loved his early Angels tenure as I aged into adulthood.  Been less in love as he has basically been GM in all but name and has the talent level slowly decrease.
@CavRTK @PatDonahoeArmy I’m doing one of these with my rapids machine and ID tag machine
@FPWellman Fred I tweated this last week, saw it while watching football: https://t.co/5OWQssn6AN
@pblest Oh good, he's a military lawyer - when does this have consequences for his commission?  If he's willing to treat sexual assault as such a joke, doesn't his ability to practice law for the military have to come into question?
@RogerMisso There’s a lot of personal reflection that all men need to make about how they interacted with women in their lives.  I know I’m doing it.
@JustSchmeltzer ANNEXATION OF PUERTO RICO!
@usawtfmJ1 oh that's going to be bad - how many "you ruined my promotion party" complaints are coming
@surfbordt @libbycwatson She spends so much imagination on this - just write another set of books already.  She obviously has tons of ideas that she wants to throw around, but doesn't appear to want to go about creating a narrative series around some of these ideas.
@RogerMisso Also, one less jerk at Heid's or Mother's Cupboard, as well.
@RogerMisso I never understood the urge of celebrities to trash a city, outside of a set of discriminatory/injustice situations.
@CJ_usawtfm @smoltexan I haven’t lived in CA in awhile but just had to spend over a month there in May/June going between LA, Orange County and San Diego and I didn’t see a single Cane’s.  This is a trash map.
@armyguyJustin Sorry the hallmark Christmas display was in my CVS last weekend.
Oh cool, NRCC endorsed racial dog whistle.  Hey look at that black thug, how dare he run for office! https://t.co/nMsITNwQBW
@Cville_TMP @XOofXOs I like to feel like I earned by liquor.
@XOofXOs I actually keep everything in the basement.  At least I get a little exercise when it’s time for a refill
@OrinKerr That’s happened to me three tones today: why are the marines running down the street?  What happened at fort Campbell?  Doppelgänger-gate?
@DefenseBaron That being said, the Brewster’s Millions aspect of this spending over the end of the fiscal year ought to investigated.
@DefenseBaron Does this not imply that the DOD only really needed ~17.5 billion a month and was this overfunded by nearly $260 billion.  Also, too, no one in the military ever wastes money when they get told to spend it all in less than 60 days.
@XOofXOs It’s almost like he works exclusively with S1s. That phrase should be inscribed on the AG crest.
@usawtfmJ1 I see your S1 bat signal.  What’s open?
@usawtfmJ1 Lol.  It’s fine.  I have plenty to do in the interim.  First DA boards plus a command board and possibly an SRB.  Fun!
@Where_is_Puff I’m think I’m sitting literally right behind you in this picture
@usawtfmJ1 True.  I use them as a matter of routine to avoid work.
@usawtfmJ1 WTH?  That’s even later than the last three years.  It’s good.  We can pass out the results and then immediately start the process for next year.  I’m told that LOI will be our early December too
@vonFoxhole Wil totally concur with this.  I was a laid back chill dude from Southern California stationed Hawaii.  Once I moved to the northeast I randomly start raising my voice at randomly inappropriate times in conversations and then claim I was speaking for emphasis.
@usawtfmJ1 Any info on when the SSC board results be released?
@usawtfmJ1 Sorry I only take guidance through G3 channels.  Please re-submit your request through proper channels.
@S1Your Well I’m sure you keep your list of grievances just as I do.  It’s fun building the list, not so much experiencing the events that lead to something getting on the list.
@S1Your No one ever appreciates the S1s dry witticisms.  It is the downside to our jobs.
@cinyc9 I’m really interested in how these maps continue to reinforce the “blue-ness” of even smallish towns like Amsterdam in largely rural red counties like Montgomery.
@pptsapper I’m sorry it was me.
@BFriedmanDC did you see that @ashleyfeinberg tagged correctly that 35 years ago Chuck Grassley was voting against the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday?
@S1Your @CattitudeLady No we talk about how we are avoiding work while avoiding the work.  It’s next level efficiency that we seek.
@kthalps No one gets excited, except of course Kathy if he resigns to run for POTUS.
@edsbs That’s like the third time he made a play like that tonight.  That’s the best the pac 12 has to offer.
@SenhorRaposa It’s literally the least he could do.  I bet he wouldn’t be able to pick any of them out of a lineup.
@SBN_BillC Syracuse is wasting prime opportunity here.  Should be up by 10.
@CharlesPPierce @joshtpm What’s the likelihood that the first 65 women agreed to this? How many other women got contacted?  Are there emails in some inboxes or voicemails on some phones of women who couldn’t be reached? Seems like a worthwhile lead to track.
@DavidOAtkins What better can we expect from a someone who, as the mayor, allowed a confederate battle flag to be flown three times (replacing it each time activists tore it down) at San Francisco city hall in an immoral attempt to get named as Mondale’s VP?
When my boss is out of the office.... https://t.co/C21oIPhMab
@RogerMisso Heard a twitter-spiracy last night that said Maloney ran to do what your  numbers showed (pull numbers away from Teachout upstate).  If you split Maloney upstate vote 70% Teachout, 30% James, does Teachout (their split of total upstate) end up winning AG?
@usawtfmJ1 Sometimes you save a perstat during a bus movement by counting myself then disappearing into the zero dark early darkness to resume work on the trail party.
@XOofXOs @pptsapper @armyguyJustin @TankCPTNemo It's funny - I got out of AC into ARNG.  Ended up promoted to MAJ prior to my USMA classmates by about a year.  Now they are all pinning LTC and I won't be getting my silver oak leaf for awhile.
@pptsapper @armyguyJustin @pptsapper Sign up now.  I had ILE and AOC finished within 2 years of promotion to MAJ.  It's a suck, but not too much.  The ILE portion only has 1-2 papers.  The AOC portion depends wholly on your instructor (15-1 ratio) and do a complete MA from start to finish as the project.
@usawtfmJ1 Yup.  Got drafts of every notification ready to go.  Results were pretty decent
@spartykev @usawtfmJ1 @S1Your Oh ok.  Typical though.  Poor S1 who doesn’t ensure his ETS’g enlisted Soldiers don’t get their award in the way out.  Also means the XO and Commander and CSM weren’t really keeping an eye out
@DavidLarter That, Because of government record keeping laws, this egregious bit of propaganda will never be deleted.
@spartykev @usawtfmJ1 @S1Your An ARCOM can be approved in by an O6.  Why is your state giving you the run around?
@XOofXOs @S1Your I’m sorry.  I always just say brigade kicked the award back and the clock restarted.
@usawtfmJ1 @S1Your @spartykev Silly S1s. Officers always write their own awards and have their boss sign it.  Then S1 has to come in and fix the terrible grammar and ensure that the battalion commander is not approving MSMs
@Where_is_Puff @LadyLovesTaft @Zaknafien_DC @ArmyStrang Have you read the Malazan Books by Steve Erikson?  10 main books and five related books of fantasy, military, and grit.  I have it above wheel of time and Sword of truth and just below GOT.  Great world building and overall plot.
@Where_is_Puff @LadyLovesTaft @Zaknafien_DC @ArmyStrang Right, he ended up writing six more plus another prequel and has now moved onto a spin-off with Nicci the bodyguard.  Debating on a re-read but realizing 17 500+ page novels don’t fit my reading schedule right now.
@Where_is_Puff @LadyLovesTaft @Zaknafien_DC @ArmyStrang Did you stop Sword of truth after confessor (book 11) or go all the way thru Warheart ( book 17)
@MikeObach @pptsapper Correct: 10 offices (DMPM (Derog Info Review), JAG, DMPM again, DCS G1, ASA, DAS, VCSA, CSA, SECARMY, SECDEF) for all UVP scrolls or DA boards.  That seems like a lot of fingers in the pie.
@PenguinOfTroy It reflects a general lack of trying to get fast players in space.  Look what happened on Tyler Vaughns crossing route late in the game.  Almost every pass before that was either a sideline pass or cross-field out route.
@MikeObach @pptsapper I've seen that happen a lot and no one cares.  There's zero accountability anywhere in the system.  There are proposed fixed but they are band-aids, not resources to fix the system as it currently exists.
@rarelyprofshnal @rrretired2008 @pptsapper That's correct all LT positions are coded as grade O2.
@timothyjwyant @pptsapper Also, I think it's frustrating because senior officers who should be accountable grew up in a different promotion system.  They don't see this and they offer the sop of back-pay instead of fixing the system with more resources.
@timothyjwyant @pptsapper totally agree.  The ARNG system is unsustainable.  I have a 2LT whose promotion has been in process for 276 days.
@rrretired2008 @pptsapper Not for 1LT promos in the ARNG.  Just needed to have BOLC complete and have 18 months TIG.  The officer doesn't even have to be sole position holder for 1LT promotions.
@timothyjwyant @pptsapper it's frustrating because it's not simply denying the recognition, it's the extended period of reduced pay that their duty performance earned.  We have allowed a culture of the lower rungs be crapped on in the name of "That's the way the Army is, suck it up"
@pptsapper I believe it is politically related - Congress demanded more intrusive background/IG checks and didn't resource any additional personnel or money to support the offices who actually have to do those checks.
@pptsapper I feel like states / RRCs should be allowed to certify 1LT promotions and all ARNG should do is publish the FEDREC.  If the states believe the officers should be promoted, ARNG should just do it.  Other UVPs should still go longer, but not this 1LT promos.
@pptsapper I hate it because it's disgusting.  The officers end up getting another eval as a 2LT when they should already be promoted.  At least those promos are back-dated and back-pay is paid.  No way it should take that long.
@pptsapper It's frustrating because when I was a promoted to 1LT in the AC I pinned black bars at exactly 18 months after commissioning.  They are taking longer for all of these unit-vacancy promotion.  They are over-cautious in scrubbing records for derog info.
@pptsapper @pptsapper this has happened over the last two years.  I'm not sure how they can fix it.  I'm trying to get our 1LT promotion packets submitted prior to the 18 month mark (you can submit 2-3 months early if they are BOLC complete)
@XOofXOs @XOofXOs we had this happen a couple of times.  Most likely, you will have to re-sign, then have the COL hand-sign, and then e-mail the evaluation to the HRC evaluation team for upload.  We had this happen when our Chief of Staff retired on short notice.
@RogerMisso I think it’s interesting to see the internal scaffolding of polling.  Getting to see response rates (and thus the inherent randomness of who picks up and where those pickups are) and the random changes in the overall %s based on the pickup rate.
@CombatCavScout What did we do now?  You only have to give the specific reason for the post not the virtually inexhaustible supply of men being dumbasses?
@XOofXOs Such a great concept.  Really an ideal synthesis for the current generation of field grade officers who grew up before the prequels came out.
@XOofXOs How is it?  On my TBR pile while I finish Ghost Wars.
@XOofXOs I run that selection process for my state NG.  I’ve heard the course is a suck, but generally the officers enjoy it.  I just think you already balancing this decision means it would be hard to plow through that long paper 9 months in when wondering if it was the right choice.
@XOofXOs Where do you stand on DL war college.  You should be able to apply in the next cycle.  That of course will had like four years though between the 2 years in course and MSO
@MatthewSitman @MatthewSitman he was like that In high school, too.  There, he fit right in with the kids of late 90s rich Orange County, CA Republicans.  His rise to this role was so unsurprising once I saw his first column for The Atlantic.
@jimgolby You should add Ronan Farrow’s War On Peace to that stack on he left (for symmetry’s sake) and read that.
