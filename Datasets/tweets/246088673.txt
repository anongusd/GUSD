We're going to be talking about the need to challenge corporate power and its role in rigging Washington to pass bills like the #GOPTaxScam through policies like more employee ownership, aggressive antitrust enforcement, and an end to the financialization of our economy.
The #GOPTaxScam means Corporate CEOs will have even less of a reason to make investments that create jobs here in America &amp; even more reasons to boost their short-term profits &amp; merge into even bigger corporations. And then they'll have even more power to rip you off.
By lowering corporate taxes, lowering taxes on the wealthy, and encouraging jobs to be shipped overseas, this #GOPTaxScam is only going to tighten the squeeze on working families and #MAGA voters.
Well, in the 1950s, 1 out of every 3 federal tax dollars came from Corporate America. Today, it's 1 out of 8. If this bill passes, it'll be much less than that. Big Corporations have successfully passed the buck for investing in America from their bottom line to yours.
When @realDonaldTrump talks about #MAGA, we assume he's talking about times like the 1950s, when the economy supported a broad middle class &amp; inequality was low (&amp; systemic racism prevented people of color from participating in this historic prosperity)
.@realDonaldTrump talks a lot about #MAGA and it's true that the rules that govern the economy have been written to squeeze working families &amp; *literally* allow big corporations and the wealthy to steal the value of their work.
This bill is historically unpopular - yet the Senate and House GOPs are willing to harm their constituents and imperil their political future just to appease the wealthy donors who fund their campaigns and pollute our politics.
This #GOPTaxScam is generational theft. It's also the last gasp of a system and a politics that have rigged the economy against the many for the benefit of a wealthy few.
