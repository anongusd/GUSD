11/ So endeth the lesson. 		For now.
10/ Or when a Dem President declares that the power to impose taxes rests with the executive, because emergency. 		There is no emergency. It's a lie. But by all means, buy into it. Nothing can ever go wrong with abuse of power. Gotta stop those brown babies.
9/ What you're saying is, "I can't get the Wall I want, so screw the Constitution and the law." Don't pretend otherwise. 		When a Dem President says, "Congress won't pass my gun confiscation bill, but I want it, so I'm declaring a national emergency" y'all cry to someone else.
8/ As a conservative, I'm not a *fan* of almost *any* of the long-running emergency declarations. I find them signs of abdication of responsibility on the part of both the exec and legislative branches. 		Some, perfectly legit, but all should be bounded in time.
7/ "But it's difffffferent," the writers of Serious Conservative Outlets like Gentry Breitbart will say, bending like willows in a strong wind. "This justifies blowing up one more norm, one more standard, one more Constitutional safeguard. We have to stop the Caraaaaavan!"
6/ So when some future Republican Congress passes a spending bill they REALLY love, and a Democratic President says, "Nope. Emergency. Taking the money for the Dr. Atheist Von Clinton Celebrity Abortion Center and Vegan Advocacy Farm kthnxbye" y'all can just sit the eff down.
5/ "Conservatives" now want to make the budget process of appropriations *enshrined in the Constitution* subject to Presidential whim alone.		From ‚ÄúNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law" to ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
4/ *Conservatives* used to be cautious about executive overreach, at least on paper. 		Now, they're cheering for a false flag emergency that will have long-running knock-on effects in the hands of the other team.
3/ This declaration is social engineering to make the lumpentariat of Trump supporters feel good about how he's going to Stop The Brown Tide and for short-term political spank-bank material for Sean Hannity and his imitators.
2/ That's just the political side, but you'll own it. You wanted a national emergency for a totally made-up crisis, and so you'll get more. 		No tool goes unused in politics.
1/ Every one of you "conservatives" gushing about the abuse of emergency powers owns it when a Democratic President declares a national emergency on Day 1. 		Whether it's on guns or abortion or  climate or LGBT issues, you just remember, you wanted this to be how things go.
