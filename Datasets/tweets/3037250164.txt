@FoxNews @LelandVittert @ElizabethPrann I am watching your show with coverage of the protests but see no Fox News Alert about @realDonaldTrump announcing a couple of hours ago that Saudi Arabia agreeing to up oil production by 2M b/d. This is major news https://t.co/iqe0EZNbxa
@Richardafowler If you really disagree with #RepWaters on her outrageous instigations then don't say "but.." after and then justify #Waters actions due to anything!!  You did this twice today. The "but" negates what you've said prior. @RCamposDuffy @KennedyNation @SandraSmithFox
@HuckabeeOnTBN @realDonaldTrump Thank you for the heads up. Will try my best to tune in. @TBN
@lh_carter @TeamCavuto @PressSec Sorry if I misjudged you. The words "To be fair...."is like saying "but.." after complimenting someone, it totally negates the compliment. Hope this helps you understand my tweet. Your initial comments with @TeamCavuto were right on.
@TeamCavuto Enjoyed your commentary on incident with @PressSec at restaurant last night. @lh_carter lost me when ending her commentary with "To be fair..." and started to present a justification for the behavior of the restaurant owner.   There was no justification for this.
@PeteHegseth Thank you for getting the liberal on the couch to admit that she, as a rep of the progressive left, is in favor of open borders. If other Dems would just admit what they really feel, the 2018 midterms will be a major red wave. @OutnumberedFNC
@SteveDoocy @realDonaldTrump  President Trump - Thank you for spending the time with @foxandfriends this AM and speaking with America. Steve - Great job asking our President some meaningful questions without any time to prepare.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President - Happy Flag Day 2018!!! https://t.co/Ae3UQCxgTv
@TheFive @GregGutfeldShow @TheJuanWilliams Juan - You don't get it. How dare you twist what #Greg Gutfield said about Otto Warbier. Thank you @kilmeade for keeping keeping #Juan quiet.
@HARRISFAULKNER  @OutnumberedFNC Please Tell @JessicaTarlov to keep up the Trump bashing. Every time she makes these outrageous statements we get thousands of liberal Dems to realize that Trump is doing everything to #MAGA.
@GarySinise Great performance tonight as you honored our veterans by singing along with our great Military "God Bless the USA".   Thank you for remembering our fallen heroes and recognizing our Troops. We live in a great nation. Happy Memorial Day!!
@RTNArtieMuller1 Congratulations on great turnout today in DC. We totally support your efforts in bringing awareness about missing Vets. Keep up the good work. God bless the USA. Happy Memorial Day!!
@TheLeeGreenwood We watched with great American pride your performance this morning on @foxandfriends on the USS Intrepid. Thank you. God bless the USA!!!  God bless all our people who are serving our country and we remember those who have paid the price ptotecting us.
@OutnumberedFNC @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER Glad to see a Dem on the couch who has an inderstanding of global politics. @thehonorablecsc id an excellent contributor to @FoxNews
@AGJeffBSessions WHERE ARE YOU?  We need you to take charge of all alleged infiltration of the GOP 2016 campaign by the FBI and others!!!
@MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures Maria - please ask @SteveScalise why we don't have the Republican votes to pass Goodlatt-McCaul bill now. Important!!!
@TheFive That's it. Juan has got to go. Now he defends MS13 as "terrible" but won't call them animals and said that fake news criticism of @realDonaldTrump statement was correct. Let Juan say that face to face with the victims families. MS13members are NOT human.
@TheFive @kilmeade @DanaPerino @greggutfeld Tell @TheJuanWilliams to keep defending the craziness of Bernie Sanders. Love it. Such  snowflake views will insure a GOP sweep in the midterms. Most Americans are smarter.
@AGJeffBSessions My wife and I have the highest respect for you as AG. Please give some indication that you are prepared to deal decisively to reign in the unjust &amp; out of control Mueller investigation.  You can do it.
@OutnumberedFNC Disappointed that you cut away from President Trump's Roundtable. I like to hear what Americans are feeling. Also wanted to hear what @marcorubio has to say.
@LelandVittert Sorry but you were quite rude to Lee Zelden this morning. I think you interrupted every one of his responses.   I wanted to hear his responses. @RepLeeZeldin
@BretBaier Heard you have interview with Comey on Jan 23. All this accomplishes is selling more books for Comey. I admire your reporting but this interview is a waste of time. Comey will not answer your questions. I will not watch this. Suggest you cancel!!!
@MariaBartiromo Please ask Rep Goodlatte when he expects to have his findings complete so AG can act. He needs to hold key people on DOJ in contempt if info is not coming immediately.
@HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedFNC Excellent lineup on the couch today w/@THEHermanCain.   Very good discussion on some important topics including the witch hunt by Mueller.
@PeteHegseth Thank you for strongly pointing out the errors that @GeraldoRivera brought up this morning blaming Israel for the misery that Hamas has brought upon its own people.  @foxandfriends.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Thank you for bringing these egregious pardons to the attention of American people.  Californians will vote Brown out of office - they have had enough.
@NHLBlackhawks @NHL Amazing night for Scott Forster.  Give my congrats to Scott. When are you going to draft him?
@DanaPerino Disappointed that you cut off @realDonaldTrump for his talk in Ohio on infrastructure. That is not like @FoxNews.
@IngrahamAngle You are a real patriot in exposing these terrible acts on your show tonight. America needs to hear the real effects of the results of allowing criminal illegal immigrants to go free.  Great Angle. Keep up the good work. We feel for the victims.
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER Two Dems on the couch this AM is too much for me. I am turning you off because I want to enjoy my lunch. Sorry we love you.
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @PeteHegseth    Should take a poll on those on the couch (before the briefing ) on whether @realDonaldTrump will impose the veto.
@realDonaldTrump This is true leadership!! Great to see that we have a President that is looking out for the American  people. Please veto this awful bill. Congress needs to deal with DACA, the Wall (real wall) and defund "Planned Parenthood".  Thank you.
@RepBrianFitz Just heard @RepLeeZeldin &amp; @RonDeSantisFL on @JudgeJeanine. Pls join them in congressional petition to have @AGJeffBSessions appoint a Special Counsel to investigate FBI irregularities in getting FISA warrants.
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER Great lineup on show today (Wed).  I can actually relax and enjoy my lunch.
@NRA I am an NRA member and advocate of 2nd Ammendent. Please support @realDonaldTrump in his efforts to promote tougher background checks and raise the age limit for legal purchase of AR15 and like arms to 21 years old.  It is the time to act and support @realDonaldTrump.
@FLGovScott It is very obvious that #SheriffIsrael must be removed from is job due to gross negligence of his officers on the scene. HAS to be accountability for not protecting the students. His removal would begin the healing process. Please do the right thing for the families.
@guypbenson @dbongino @united @united Ditto for me until you reverse your position on the NRA discounts.  Shame on you for being a political pawn of the progressive liberal left who do not want a real dialogue on better gun control that @realDonaldTrump is courageously putting forward

@JudgeJeanine GREAT Show tonight. Good questions to @realDonaldTrump.  Opening monologue is right on. I'd take it one step further and DEMAND that #Sheriff Israel RESIGN!!  He owes it to the family of the victims. This would start the healing process.
@SenToomey Read your email and encourage you to speak with @realDonaldTrump about moving quickly to bring forth the bill you and @Sen_JoeManchin sponsored. NEED SOMETHING NOW!!  Let me know if I can help.
@realDonaldTrump @AGJeffBSessions need to IMMEDIATLY call #PM Netanyahu to get Israeli help in how to prevent school shootings. Israel very successful here. Need action now!!!
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/o00v1zwfps
@FoxNews Fully Understandable!! People are tired with the left wing rhetoric that  comes out of CNN &amp; NYT.   Congratulations to @FoxNews and keep up the good work.
@OutnumberedFNC The Dems should be jumping for joy over @realDonaldTrump proposal for amnesty for 1.8M Dreamers.  @trish_regan has it right that Dems don't support because they want to see a few Dreamers deported before Nov.  Won't happen.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump was very unifying tonight but Dems would not receive it.  @TheJuanWilliams can never give any credit to our President. Tired of hearing that rhetoric. This is a night to support @realDonaldTrump
@OutnumberedFNC Great discussion on Senate actions. @PeteHegseth a big plus. We love Pete with his military experience. Refreshing to hear discussion without Liberal rhetoric.  We are on the right track.
@SenMajLdr Suggest you go for getting the Nuclear Option and gain real control over the situation. That way you can get one year budget and Schumer would be out of the limelight.
@SenBobCasey Stand up to the Dem party leadership and do what is right for our country. We DO NOT NEED DACA NOW. We DO NEED to support our Military. Think for yourself. Vote YES on cloture of the Schumer filibuster. I am from PA.
@jasoninthehouse Watching your interview on @FoxNews. We need you back in Congress, House or Senate.
@TeamCavuto Unfortunately typical textbook Democratic rhetoric from your guest #Mike Dukakis. They refuse to give @realDonaldTrump credit for the tax cuts or any of the good things done the last year.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Hope you will be given a chance tonight or tomorrow by @SenateMajLdr to redeem yourself from your support of the Schumer Shutdown.   Please vote yes to keep our great Military funded.
@SenateMajLdr I support your calling for another vote to give Dems a chance to redeem themselves.  Keep voting all night if necessary. Need to keep the great Military funded.
@SenBobCasey  As one of your constituents want to let you know that you have disappointed America and our great Military with your no vote tonight on the funding bill. Very bad!!
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER What a treat today - @danbonginoknows on the couch and no Ms Harf.
@kevincorke Good questions from you at today's Press Briefing,especially on immigration.  Thank you. @FoxNews
@jasoninthehouse GREAT job the last couple of nights hosting #IngrahamAngle. Look forward to more of your commentary on @FoxNews.
@marcorubio I see reports indicating you are now in support the Tax Bill. Thank you!!!  This will be great for Americans.
@SenToomey Great to hear that you are on the SR1 Conference team!! Let's get a great final bill to the House and Senate. Looking forward to seeing the final bill. @realDonaldTrump
@ANHQDC @FoxNews Map of Israel flashed on show today was incorrect. Judea/Samaria (called West Bank) is part of Israel. Map showed it incorrectly (PC). Pls correct in future.
@foxnews Watching CashinIn and disgusted at @TheJuanWilliams flagrant anti Trump bias defending @ABC FALSE news. Juan should get a job at CNN.
@RCamposDuffy @TheFive @GregGutfeldShow @TuckerCarlson @kimguilfoyle @DanaPerino Sorry to leave you off my tweet

@SenToomey Thank you for your important yea vote tonight for HR1. Please talk with @SenBobCorker to help get to yea. Should be great vote for America!!
@IngrahamAngle Great show tonight. Outstanding &amp; revealing interview with @McConnellPress. I have confidence now that America will get tax reform. Also good to hear positive comments from @marcorubio.
@realDonaldTrump @JBA_NAFW Have a GREAT trip. The senate has to come through for America. Need all the GOP votes. Looks promising. @mitch
@RepBrianFitz Thank you for your important Yea vote on H.R. 1 - Tax Cut bill.  This is an important step for Congress. Have a great Thanksgiving holiday
@RepBrianFitz STRONGLY urge you to vote YEA tomorrow on H.R. 1 Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act.  Passage is critical for improved economic growth. @SpeakerRyan
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Welcome home, Mr. President after a great trip. Now back to draining the swamp!! America needs the tax bill approved. Your help is appreciated!!
@realDonaldTrump God bless you on your trip back. We need your help in pushing through the House vote on the great tax bill. It is going to happen. #MAGA. @SpeakerRyan
@SenateMajLdr Why is the Senate publicizing its version of Tax Bill before House passes its Bill?  Are you trying to kill the whole Tax Plan?@SpeakerRyan
@TheFiveOnFox Tired of @TheJuanWilliams twisted criticism of @realDonaldTrump. Trump did NOT run away from the question on gun control.
@jasoninthehouse @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Great exchange with @JudgeJeanine. Good advice for President Trump to clean the swamp. Muller has to be questioned by @AGJeffBSessions.
@realDonaldTrump Amen!! That unity is the reason you are in the White House.  The Republican Party is getting stronger by the day.
@realDonaldTrump America is on the right track. Now we need the fake Republicans to come around or get voted out. God bless you and Melania &amp; your Cabinet.
@CalebJHull Great to see!!!
@SenToomey Please vote yes for Graham-Cassidy bill and urge @RandPaul to do the same. Americans need both of you on board.
@RandPaul Urge you to reconsider and vote yes to #Graham-Cassidy Bill to give many hurting people relief from O-Care. Our country needs you.
@SenJohnMcCain How can you "in good conscience" betray the Republican Party by your reported no vote on Graham-Cassidy bill? Pls vote yes.
@RandPaul Urge you to get on board with #GrahamCassidy. This is your last chance. MUST compromise!! Don't allow #Schumer to have a victory.
@realDonaldTrump @netanyahu Please do not meet with Abbas,as reported in media. Abbas as a terrorist supporter, CANNOT be a peace partner. Joel 3:2 and Genesis 12:3.
@realDonaldTrump @netanyahu Great news!!  Israel is under large threat from Hezbullah and needs our total support.

@POTUS Pls keep @AGJeffBSessions as AG to MAGA. He is great American &amp; has greatly secured borders. Don't worry about recusal. Blessings!
@TeamCavuto Great closing commentary on @POTUS dinner "meeting" with #Putin in Munich!!!
@RandPaul Disappointed with your @FoxNews interview after lunch mtg w/@POTUS. @POTUS read benefits of R&amp;R bill. Please vote yes to R&amp;R.

@FoxNews Chris Wallace interrupting RNC Chairwoman from responding.  Bad . #Wallace was much easier on Jack Reed.  Time to replace Wallace.
@POTUS @POTUS By  the waiving the Jerusalem Embassy Act you put Israel in danger and will delay the peace process.  You reneged on your PROMISE.
@POTUS By renewing the Jerusalem Embassy Act Waiver you are betraying Israel &amp; your Evangelical supporters.
@HARRISFAULKNER @MeghanMcCain Tell MHarf that there is no "but" about horrific action of KGriffin.
@FoxNews Watching #MediaBuzz reporting old news. No reporting on MS murders. Want to know what is happening in MS.
@nytimes SHAME on your paper for publishing name of Manchester bomber. You must reveal your source to US Administration.
@TuckerCarlson PERFECT!! Dems are indeed selling c**p to their constituents. Thank you for telling it like it is tonight!!
@POTUS CBN reports WH may use US Embassy move as chip to get Abbas to table. Move the Embassy now and Abbas will come by showing strength.
@HARRISFAULKNER @MeghanMcCain GREAT lineup on @OutnumberedFNC today. Great not hearing liberal rhetoric after all the terrible news from UK.
@POTUS From strong @POTUS supporter: We are holding you to your promise to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem now. Back your friend Bibi.
@KennedyNation - Correction!! There is no nation of Palestine (to which you referenced today on @OutnumberedFNC.)
@seanhannity Agree that no President has been treated so unfairly by media as has @POTUS. Thank you for your commentary tonight.
@jessebwatters A++ for making the Yale shrink look like a psychotic himself. Great pulling out the Goldwater rule &amp; exposing him.
@ericbolling ANNOYING listening to @Richardafowler. He is predictably negative about anything @POTUS tries to accomplish. Send him to CNN.
@RepBrianFitz Your ney vote on HR 1628 is most disappointing. Not good. You were elected as part of the Trump and conservative agenda.
@POTUS PM Abbas wants nothing but the destruction of Israel. Surprised that you were honored to host this bad person who incites murder.
@JudgeJeanine Your opening monologue this evening is right on!!  I am tired of hearing left rhetoric from Richard Fowler.
@MeghanMcCain Agree with your comments today to M Harf on Iran deal. Can't trust Iran. Iran deal is bad. Sec Tillerson should evaluate.
@TalkToRonEstes Congrats on your victory. We need your vote the approve GOP packaged to replace OCare! Saw you on @FoxNews this afternoon.
@RepDougCollins saw you on @FoxNews this afternoon. Keep up the pressure on GOP to come up with replacement for OCare!! Thank you.
@HARRISFAULKNER @MeghanMcCain Good to listen to @kilmeade on #Outnumbered Ooutnumbered. Please no more Richard Fowler. Love your reporting.
@HARRISFAULKNER Turned off #Outnumbered when Richard F said Trump is the loser after you said all America  is the real loser with OCare.
@SpeakerRyan THANK YOU for meeting with GOP leadership to get support on AHCA. Go forward under reconciliation to protect American families.
@JudgeTedPoe @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Saw you on @FoxNews today.  Need more GOP leaders like you who have learned to Govern! Congrats!
@JudgeTedPoe @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan
@SpeakerRyan Please publish list of Rep. Reps who refused to support AHCA.  Pls ID Freedom Caucus members on that list. No more secrets!!
@RepBrianFitz EXTREMELY disappointed in your disloyalty  to @POTUS, @SpeakerRyan on the AHCA.  Millions to suffer under OC &amp; PP continues!
@POTUS Listened to @JudgeJeanine tonight as you suggested. Great reporting!!  Revealing interview with MA Sheriff and School Sup't.
@RepBrianFitz PLEASE support the Republican AHCA to stand by @POTUS. This will be great for America! We need every vote.
@rushlimbaugh Great job presenting case in support of @POTUS to defensive @FoxNewsSunday.  Wallace only interupted you once.  Thank you!!
@FoxNewsSunday Chris Wallace is at it again not letting @Reince finish answering his question. Very biased questioning-not true to @FoxNews
@POTUS GREAT address to nation from FL! Thank you for significant progress on your plan to MAGA. God bless you, your family &amp; your staff!!
@SenBobCasey Why are Democratic Congress persons not allowing @POTUS to have his Cabinet? Remember that PA went for DJT in January.
@oreillyfactor Thank you for aggressively countering the liberal progressive rhetoric presented by @GeraldoRivera.  You stood for the truth
@FoxNews Just turned off Shep. If I wanted to hear all the liberal rhetoric from a news show I would turn on CNN.  Bye @ShepNewsTeam.
@ShepNewsTeam Diappointed with antagonism toward Mercedes. Need to rely on @POTUS security team. Don't need more "evidence" as you suggest.
@POTUS We support your ban on immigration from the 7 countries. The ban will allow time to set up vetting process. Keep up the good work!!!!
