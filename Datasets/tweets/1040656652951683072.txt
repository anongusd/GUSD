There‚Äôs INFINITE possibilities in the world and our education system is one of the main sources of the corruption in America.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with becoming a nurse, a stay at home mom, or a doctor but what is wrong is conditioning people early on in their development that those are the only options.
When I moved to Maryland and went to school there, I took mostly honors and advanced classes. 		At the same education level, those two states were extremely different in the way they educate kids.
In Tennessee, their education system is so crooked that a child care program is worth more credits than a STEM field credit. Granted, that was back when I was in school but from the looks of it there‚Äôs still growing racism, ignorance, and lack of education in TN and like States.
but that‚Äôs only going to benefit doctors and fortune 500s while the homeless remain homeless, sick stay sick, and rich stay ridiculously rich while the rest of the nation suffers.
Are they intending on us to all being sick and depending on pills in the future? I‚Äôm not trying to stir anything or inspire any conspiracies, I‚Äôm just stating the obvious. 		Too many people think ‚ÄúMore jobs= healthier economy‚Äù
Think about that for a second; We still have one of the World‚Äôs worst health care out there yet we are going to employ millions more nurses? How about system analysis specialists, accountants, entrepreneurs, system creators, statistics specialists, engineers, &amp;vibration analysis
Don‚Äôt you all find it odd how all these hospital careers are coming up (I think over 2 million) vs other job options?
It‚Äôs naive to think we don‚Äôt have the power to maintain our own Nation either. https://t.co/65Nre0wghu

We MUST prepare for peace and have more people at the top making this happen. 		War for peace isn‚Äôt a thing, preparation for peace is possible but a long term process.
I really don‚Äôt think that the US Government is all that bad and any flaws in the system are mostly due to the wars we have fought over the years which effected our policies, therefore effecting our nation.
Why do so many people dislike the American Government when their ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are based off of opinions, biased research, and news that‚Äôs funded by certain political parties.
I politely disagree. The very top only know how to fight wars, not to prepare for peace and that‚Äôs why we stay stuck in wars. https://t.co/erOGDxMbcQ

Happy House Estates was inspired by my mothers business, Estate Escape. My mother loves the 80s and I personally love The Weeknd‚Äôs ‚ÄúHouse of Balloons‚Äù use of Sioux and the Banshees ‚ÄúHappy House‚Äù. 		It was the glue that pieced all the inspiration of the bigger picture for me.

If your mindset is stuck at, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to change.‚Äù Your business will reflect that. If you don‚Äôt want to change your business, sell it.
Sex sells sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs the best way to do business. Using basic human needs as a sales pitch will only keep your business stuck in a primal mode. In order to advance, you have to take a look at your business system and change the bugs in it.
