@AOC I would even offer to drive down to New York and give you a ride, you should see the North part of your state on the way, very beautiful.

@ImranKhanPTI Why is it people from Pakistan and Saudi always start responding to a claim by being insulted. So defensive and emotional response. The fact is Pakistan harbours terrorists, very dangerous people who live in this country. Trump makes a very good point.
@SophiaFloersch @fia @hwaag_official @MercedesAMGF1 Good Luck
@mohammedsabr @Faik_Geci @Fleurdeprinte11 @kbsalsaud Do not involve Allah in this he has nothing to do with the actions of a murder who orders the killing of an innocent man that was speaking the truth. Saudi govt has many secrets to hide, have their ruler order the killing is not a solution.
@kbsalsaud Worst cover up in history, USA should deport Ambassador and close Saudi Embassy

@cathmckenna Not sure If fear is going to motivate people, factual information regarding climate change. Definitely a serious problem. Government needs to do a better job legislating best practices, carbon tax is not the best solution.
@realDonaldTrump Your presidency will be defined by the greatest correction in the stock market in history, when government interferes in a free economy only bad things happen. The auto sector, oil, manufacturing, agriculture all suffering from tariffs.

@Franktmcveety No way a farmer can pass along the increased costs imposed by the government to their customers. Farmers are price takers. Disadvantaged to operate a business in Canada by the various govts.  Farmers only represent .6 percent of carbon producers, home owners heavy producers.

@SenatorHousakos Well he’s not dressed up dancing, hasn’t invited any terrorist to events, CBC are liberals.
@realDonaldTrump Get out and vote
@JWaldner7 @Veenstra680 Oh boy that is stressful
@nytimes Hicks family has long history in New York, former mayor, several judges, Hicks family played a part in the American Revolution, Hicksville named after same family.
@Trump417 @foxandfriends @dbongino @POTUS Yah that is a little over the top, they act proffesional get more respect.
@RealJamesWoods Won the battle, likely lose the war. I called Trump to win way before anyone even considered him. My opinion this is the first mistake he may not recover from, young people, if the Dems actually show up and vote, issue for them they don’t have strong Candidates.
@Trump417 @foxandfriends @dbongino @POTUS People are politically charged, never seen so much fake news, division of the people. Young people at least getting involved, as long as they are not breaking the law and peaceful, well within the constitutional rights. USA was built on freedom.
@MajedAleisa Could be a political powder keg for USA Saudi relationship. Personally don’t think anything will happen too much money on the table between the two countries and Jared is right with the King, large contracts on the line.

@MajedAleisa @HamdanMohammed @MBRSpaceCentre Have the fortune to be personal friends with Sheikh Maktoum and other good citizens of UAE for over 20 years.  Country that creates stability And commerce in the Middle East. Strong leadership with a vision of the future and good partner of the USA.
@HamdanMohammed @MajedAleisa @MBRSpaceCentre Reason to be very proud, UAE has come along way in the last 100 years and even more so in the last decade. Congratulations and all the best.
@KTHopkins The police need hand guns, no questions asked and they need them today.
@Kateyor50351967 @TarekFatah @Blazingcatfur @ISNA_Canada @icna @LauraLoomer Not good
@emilia_suze @TarekFatah @ISNA_Canada @icna @LauraLoomer Liberals
@SenSchumer Agreed
@jkenney @RachelNotley Gentleman
@Ed_Sleiman @Banks_Todd Want ONTARIO to grow, eliminate land transfer taxes, reduce energy costs, minimize bureaucracy, harmonize city, region, provincial laws and departments, support business. Ontario by far one of the most bureaucratic provinces, taxes way to high.
@Cameron_Gray @ezralevant Welcome to the land of the free and the move of the brave, oh wait the land of politically charged.
@LauraLoomer @Banks_Todd See you in Montreal
@CandiceMalcolm @ezralevant Sad but not surprised
@LoriGreiner Want to support business, get rid of the liberal party, that’s at least a $500,000 business idea.
@VictorFedeli Mmmmmm
@krassenstein Not nice

@SenatorCollins See what happens this November
@ezralevant Hopefully they voted.

@HappyintheWest @Franktmcveety Apparently Syria wants to send him to Canada and the RCMP is unclear if they can arrest him once he arrives? As a result of the liberal government position.
@Paola_Dec1231 @GrassInCanada Wouldn’t happen in USA
@HappyintheWest @Franktmcveety In Saudi or Iran, tortured, find out what he knows and then he would disappear. Canada arrest him, then give him some money and then apologize.
@krassenstein I would call the police, this is not funny.

@TheBeatWithAri @SenBlumenthal My Grandfather (8x) Danial Clark, my cousin Oliver Wolcott and My other 10 relative who were governors in CT and MA who were the architects of founding the USA and signing the Constitution would be frankly disgusted and disappointed with current state of affairs.
@realDonaldTrump Amendment 1 of the constitution which you swore to uphold.
@SenCapito Appeasing the party is not necessarily the  best decision. There is allot of good Americans that could fill this position. His behaviour alone during interviews by senate committee reason enough for disqualification
@farmdane @TylerJanzen6 @originmalting Oh boy
@stillgray So wrong in so many ways
@MitchellLeitman @fordnation In Alberta speaking to minimum wage person energy cost went from $300 to $600 month after NDP took power and imposed carbon tax. Another challenge very difficult to finance, allot of people trying to profit from trading credits and take advantage of uninformed sellers.
@BullCrap44 @canadaunited1 There’s a reason why you have to be a certain age to vote. Schools should be teaching the structure of government, history, having mock trials including the existing President in todays politically charged....messed up environment, likely not the best idea.
@ShoemakerMicah @HopeFloeck Good job!
@thisfarmwife Thanks for making this video, well spoken words of encouragement, tremendous pressure for young people today.
@ShoemakerMicah @HopeFloeck Don’t
@fordnation What about retailers, 32 percent increase in wages over 18 month imposed minimum wage, more devastating then 3.5 percent top line, no protection from Amazon and online shopping, independent businesses suffered in Ontario.
@FaithGoldy My fathers family came to Canada before we were a country in hopes of a better life. The cost to save the lives of migrants small in comparison to money wasted by government, more then happy to spend money on saving lives. Fix the budget.
@realDonaldTrump Happy to focus on the future again, give predictability, Canadian $ way up yesterday markets responded positive
@SenatorHousakos Tough one, surprised America didn’t play hard ball with us before, they had all the cards except Trump wanted this done by mid terms to help with votes. Only card we had was to delay process.
@realDonaldTrump 7 days? Not much happens in 7 days,
Not much changed in USA politics and treatment of Woman. My Grandmother (8x) Herodias Long wrongfully persecuted and harassed. My  Grandfather (8x) Danial CLARK, was last prosecutor to throw out last witch trial case against 2 innocent. Ridicules this is happening 300 years later

@fordnation Toronto and Ontario has a serious debt problem, that is impossible to get out of, people seem not overall concerned about government spending as they too have heavy personal debt, credit cards, mortgages, car payments. Very serious.

@C_Mulroney @fordnation NAFTA disaster, Pipeline Disaster, Provincial debt disaster and Tory and Trudeau worried about the number of over paid civil servants. Toronto has the biggest voice in Canada, rural Ontario no voice. The 2 Ts need to be voted out by conservatives as fast as possible.

@mcmikex @brianlilley @frontline_RN @fordnation Taxes are reason why we have no money in Canada, add your income tax, property tax, HST, govt fees it’s over 50 percent of your income.
@mcmikex @brianlilley @frontline_RN @fordnation The link you just sent says $2.88 for 3.78 litres x 33percent fx=$1.00 litre cdn vs $1.14 cdn here. Add trucking, shipping costs end milk will go up. No supply management for beef pork and cdn prices are way higher. There’s a reason why almost everything is cheaper in USA.
@mcmikex @brianlilley @frontline_RN @fordnation Milk in USA cost $3.50  US gallon, or $4.69 for 4 litres. Shoppers drug mart in my neighbourhood sells milk for $4.50 for 4 litres. Want to save money stop smoking, drinking, eating out and cancel your cell phone and home internet, that’s a cartel.
@852852hk @brianlilley @frontline_RN @fordnation 90 percent of USA farmer bankrupt, suicide rate high, farmers in USA killing themselves sobwofe gets insurance. Coalition of farmers asking for same price for milk as Canada. Dairy farmers in US disaster, very bad.

@brianlilley @frontline_RN @fordnation Ag jobs related to supply management, 200,000.  Can’t sacrifice one industry for another, all jobs are important.

@RealJamesWoods Personally knew Ryan when he was a teenager, dated his sister for a time. He is a great person, hard worker and his family including his sister was exceptionally kind with strong values. So happy he turned out successful.
Unlikely NAFTA deal today, Trudeau will wait until he’s in a bigger corner and then give concessions and public will see we had no cards to play. We are not in a good position to negotiate, surprised US didnt strong arm us sooner.
@SawThroughIt @MaximeBernier Only $19 billion, individual numbers of farmer irrelevant once a dairy farm is gone it won’t be replaced, USA has lost 90 percent of farms since 1970 and very high suicide rate, serious issues with free market system and massive tax payers subsidies. Very serious issue.

@l_stone @monica_barona Sad to see the priority of some are all about votes with no regard protecting one of the last viable Ag sectors, that work, USA farmers are asking for 62 cents a litre vs Canada  76 (approx). Factor in higher costs in CDN price is same, politicians need to better understand.

@MaximeBernier Suicide rate of farmers in USA very high, crisis level.
@MaximeBernier The dairy farmers are important part of the entire farming industry, once there gone, processors could be gone, dealerships, suppliers.
@MaximeBernier Cost  $7.5 million on average to start a 60 cow dairy operation and you make $200 k year before taxes,with high risk and work 24/7  no holidays or pension, physical labour. Is this a good investment and could anyone do this ? Get rid of quota and the industry is gone forever.
@MaximeBernier Do you want to work 24/7, dairy farmers can’t leave farm, cows milked 2-3 times day, it’s like having hundreds of pets requiring constant attention, mechanical breakdown, diseases, weather, many other issues, very difficult to be a farmer.
@MaximeBernier Farmers in US are asking to be paid 62 cents  to survive. 90 % of farmers since the 1970s have disappeared, suicide rate high. Cdn farmers in Canada get paid approx 76cents but have higher costs and fair wages to employees and no billions in govt. handouts.

@Lamaggad @KSAmofaEN Twitter post is not interference, complete over reaction by the Saudi government.
@HBashmill @KSAmofaEN Twitter post is not interference, USA made similar comments, this is a political play by the Saudi government likely at the request of the USA. Saudi is interfering with Iran, and other countries.
@GeoffyPJohnston My guess the Americans and the Russians have some involvement. Follow the money and you will find the cause. What is the financial gain? Not large trading partners, neither country is security threat. Saudi only has a few moves to make, what else can they do? Limited options.
@jr_womack Mycogen
@JustinTrudeau Meanwhile Saudi kicks out our Ambassador
@oop00qoo @1396_sas @saadjabbar1 Don’t think they have this word in Arabic. Like someone says something to you, that you don’t like and you kick their ambassador out of the country, that’s not reasonable reaction. Maybe calling the ambassador and saying: “hey we don’t like this” likely reasonable limit.
@saadjabbar1 Of all the countries who shouldn’t post a picture of a plane flying into a building its likely Saudi, your government is the one who posted this picture.
@MajedAleisa Just the beginning, we have a saying don’t hick the bear
@YasirKSA88 @Stefan_BC Maybe Saudi should not interfere with Iran, shame on Saudi for suggesting to to return the bodies of pilgrims and use a mass grave, barbaric treatment. Saudi is interfering in US politics.
@globalnews @monica_barona Some forms are bigger then Bahrain, UAE is a tourist destination and Palestine what can I say, so all theee countries support human rights violations against woman?
@CBCToronto @monica_barona Oh all the countries to make and share a picture of a plan flying into a building, Saudi likely not the best choice.
@Operii @veryshady313 @saadjabbar1 No you want to fly plane into CN tower? Saudi is a safe haven for terrorists https://t.co/nKHMABtbJE

@SenatorHousakos Need the Conservatives back
@FlixBibeau @KAFTA78 @CanEmbSA Attending Bishop university back then, paying rent living in Quebec, like everyone else, Quebec resident.	Strong opposition to allow us to vote, this was happening across the province, McGill, Concordia.
@WiredSources @mahsti25metana1 What about Saudi
@Londx77 @KAFTA78 @CanEmbSA Good point
@CalgaryGeorge @wctranger Build the pipeline
@VP What about Saudi?
@dockaurG @EffieGib @MPRubySahota @PeelPoliceMedia @UWGreaterTO @OntLiberal Visited William Osler Hospital last summer in Brampton, they almost killed me, my opinion negligent, all to do with management and budgets.
@fredweisg Cheap HP, looks good
@1396_sas @saadjabbar1 Saudi Media is posting pictures of Toronto with a plane flying towards the CN tower, please explain your cultural meaning if this? https://t.co/qfL1smajeG
@drWbaghdadi @1396_sas Canada has helped more refugees then Saudi. Fact: 90 percent of Saudi  citizens are Arab, try and be Jewish or Christian and Become a Saudi Citizen or for that matter Iran.
@tomhanks Have the same shoes, super comfy, oh the car, very cool
@ahmadss36737196 @saadjabbar1 Understand your comments.  CAD defends the wearing of all cultural dress. Familiar with your culture, lived with and friends with your Royal family. We are stronger working together and from time to time it doesn’t hurt to listen what your neighbour has to say.

@farmersims Go through rad?
@KevinMalsom Might be able too, sell it to Japan
@KAFTA78 @CanEmbSA Seriously, you couldn’t find anything to criticize? Quebec is Nationalist, they voted to remain with Canada, not even a topic of discussion.
@saadjabbar1 No crossing a red line, it’s called free speech.
Saudi Arabia no Maple Syrup for you. Little extreme move to make over comments. In our Country your free to have an opinion whether or not it is liked by government. Understand it’s challenging for you to understand free speech and work towards peace.
@FarmerFalk Canadian Minister of Environment is likely losing it seeing these pics.
RT @FarmerFalk: Just finished helping beat the world record for number of combines running for 5 minutes or longer. 305 was the final count…
@thall8310 @sellis1994 Looks like a v8 power plant. Probably high HP and lower torque.
@krassenstein Society issues, interesting how someone can go out an buy 2 AK 47s and 600 rounds of ammunition and the police doesn’t have access to a database to determine if they were sold an by who? Since when did Christians go around shooting other Christians over political views.
@KTHopkins Women don’t attend funeral?
@bertbech @krassenstein No, shame as America is a beautiful Country
@krassenstein Met American Canadians, that live in Canada and won’t travel to the USA to visit family due to concerns of racial prejudice as they are of Mexican decent. Prefer to stay in Canada, sad.
@krassenstein We cancelled a family vacation to California, went to Mexico instead. Saved us money.
@SpartanFarmer Remember doing this
First experience with Alberta Health care, no wait, properly staffed, clean, quick to take tests, talented young staff, provincial wide data base shares test results with your family Dr and specialists, job well done by Alberta. Ontario disaster experience at hospital.
@CatheeMcKennnna @mogrant61 If combines stopped, half the world would starve to death, impossible to harvest millions of acres with anything else.
@Dr_ChrisSimpson @GodkinAg Undergrad, go get a job/experience, Grad part time after you know something other then what’s in a text book. Naturally not viable for all, likely makes sense for Business Students.
@Jstrack007 @slulead Excellent, Do you have familiy in Hazleton, PA?
@IHboog Drive up on a board
@RealJamesWoods @nytimes My Ancestor Edwin Lawrence Godkin , Editor Nation would be rolling over in his grave, agreed at one time you had to be intelligent, speak intelligent and about something meaningful. I Think Harvard no longer have Godkin Lectures, probably an iPhone App now.
@RodPhillips01 Two issues 1) middle class can pay more taxes 2) no one knows how to properly improve the environment, not convinced there is a solution other then people become more responsible and we change our behaviours.
@MitchellLeitman Don’t know the solution, have a few ideas, can’t afford to pay more. Maybe shop local, change consumer behaviours, legislation, invest in clean tech. Having better leadership.	Travel local, smaller houses, less urban sprawl. We personal now shave 1 car, walk to work, shop local.
@MitchellLeitman Move to Alberta
@PremierScottMoe @fordnation Can’t afford to pay more taxes anyways, government wants more then half of my pay cheque. Enough is enough work half the year for the government. Tax is not the solution.
@fordnation Don’t worry  can’t afford to pay more taxes. Half my pay check goes to the government and the other half to bills and living expenses, poor middle class.
@C_Mulroney @RodPhillips01 Carbon tax financial disaster for middle class who are already considered working poor. Approx 46 percent of a middle class family gross income goes to the government.
Property tax, HST, government licensing fees, Federal &amp; Provincial taxes income tax, fuel surcharge taxes at the pump, represent approx 46 percent of gross income of a middle class family in Ontario. Ontario pays enough tax. Carbon tax is not a viable solution.
@hoosierdaddy033 @cathmckenna High speed rail between Montreal and Toronto, 1970s the car manufacturer lobby groups quashed the idea. There’s lots of affordable communities along the St Lawrence river in Eastern Ontario.
@krassenstein Won’t happen
Liberal Carbon tax plan is not good for business, tax strategy is not the solution. Solution is much more complicated then using old method of using taxes to combat or fix a peoblem.
@JoshSchick3 @robertreese_4 Over priced
@agourmetfarmer @davidb43614 555?
@AndrewScheer Middle class pay the highest percentage of taxes, low income pay little to no tax, wealthy pay allot of tax however make enough money not to impact lifestyle. Middle class pay the most as a percentage of income, tax rates do not make sense for middle class, after tax working poor
@cathmckenna Conservative are fiscally responsible and have a viable financial plan for the Country. Liberals provide little to know environmental programs for the farming community.
@RodPhillips01 @fordnation @JustinTrudeau Scrap carbon tax
@cathmckenna Personally thought the plan does not make sense. Issue is we are a boarder country, high concentration of people in 4 cities, become unaffordable for most to live where the jobs are. High speed train rail to Windsor is one solution, live in affordable city with short commute.
@MitchellLeitman No one knows
@Met_mdclark CLARK people hard working

@SenJeffMerkley Impossible to hide anything with social median
@RealJamesWoods Sounds about right
@SenJeffMerkley JEFF you are the government not the Trump administration, each Senator is equally responsible for the actions of the government, finger pointing is not a solution
@fordnation Good job
@JebBush @POTUS Agreed
@AdamParkhomenko @onerahinz Negative
@fordnation $318 billion in debt, Province is Broke,the Premier has no choice to do more with less,have to cut expenses, what is the alternative? $500 billion debt.
@the_mikeskies @robertbenzie @Baird @TorontoStar @patrickbrownont Even better idea, and get rid of the county level of government in rural areas, My home town has 3 councillors works fine.
@PitstickFarms @WentworthFarms Very
@PitstickFarms @BradPeel3 Probably cost $300.00 each
@PitstickFarms JD can take the simplest piece of equipment on the farm and turn it into something over complicated.
@PitstickFarms Big money back then
@PitstickFarms Stop dreaming
@PitstickFarms 25 percent tariff to Canada?
@FoxNews @mahsti25metana1 @RepLizCheney @BarackObama Far less then the wasted money on failed government programs.
@robertbenzie @Baird @TorontoStar @patrickbrownont Reduce it to 12 very could, qualified and experi need councillor, they could easily manage the city. There are many corporations with larger budgets and complex needs that have smaller boards.
@TedKennedyJR @AAPD @BazelonCenter Could do anything, doesn’t mean anything, doesn’t matter who Is nominated the conservatives wouldn’t be happy.  She should focus on facts no speculation something could or could not happen.
@HunterWilsonJD We are talking about wheat not corn?
@jasonmauck1 Nice!
@jasonmauck1 How many pods per plant?
@HunterWilsonJD How many bushels per acre yield?
@krassenstein Listen to tape again, Sounds like referring how they are going to finance the new company, not to borrow money pay cash, not literally, meaning don’t borrow the money. I. Business term cash can refer to cheque, wire transfer. The issue is his morals(cheating).
@cathmckenna Nice city in the summer, good place to visit for 3-4 days. Lived there for 8 years during high tech bubble. Been back to visit, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver all world class, Ottawa’s moving in right direction.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Definitely sign of character, was his wife pregnant at the time?
@RealJamesWoods I know your cousin, sounds like something he would say, very interesting.
@RealJamesWoods Mental illness
@AaronBlake @kazweida Legal tender
@funder That not entirely correct, listen to tape, he asks are they going to fiancé the new company with cash, which in business means don’t finance. I’m not fan of Trump, all I can state is the fact, which is the problem now, allot of stories without facts.
@kazweida In business, referring to how your making a payment: borrow the money or pay cash, not literally with cash, use a cheque or wire payment. term cash usually means your not using borrowed money. Cash offer to buy Realestate means no mortgage.
@malbic_ @coleman_carly Important to take pictures, most men, self included find it painful, including Obama.
@RealJamesWoods That’s allot of guacamole
@VP @POTUS Almost all parts of Iran without water, some without power, south was hit by earthquake, money is almost worthless, citizens branded as terrorists, and when they protest they are arrested, is this a country you go to war with? 80 million fellow humans living in this country.
@MarkWarner Terrible
@dubyadirt Cornageden
@cathmckenna @SparksStreet Since when did we start drinking beer from a straw? Only drink that should be sold in pub is beer, cold or warm depending on country.
@SenSanders Starting of a humanitarian crisis in Iran, 80 million people, without water, without power, hit by an earth quake, currency is almost worthless.
@arabnews @kbsalsaud Both countries need to work toward peace and create stability in the region. Both sides bantering at one another only creates further tensions. Look forward to the day all Middle East countries are at peace with one another.
Prayers go out to the victims of the shooting victims on Pape St., Toronto. Father grew up in the area. I spent some time there, violence feels close to home. Becoming to  normal hearing about gun violence in TO. The city just added 200 more police. Don’t know the solution.
@HansontheBike @cathmckenna @BlacksWeather Crop maturing nicely, looking good.
@MaxROIFarmer No
@fordnation When liberal took power 2003, debt $138B when finished spending 2018 $312B, higher then 75 percent of countries, pace of growth is remarkable. Right up there with Greece, Italy, Japan and State of California. Interest rates continue to rise ONTARIO in trouble.
@MaximeBernier If Harper was Negotiating for Canada a deal would have been made.
@RealJamesWoods Genius
@FraserMacLeod5 @cathmckenna @WestcottWines @VBadawey @Chris_Bittle I agree, the feds should try an help farmers get carbon tax credits for Bio digesters in Alberta, none available, for farmers, clean energy. Farmers are the largest creators of carbon credits, when they adopt certain farm practices,with little to no support programs.
@FraserMacLeod5 @cathmckenna @WestcottWines @VBadawey @Chris_Bittle Agreed, Ontario weather is by no means extreme, try farming in mid west or Western Canada.		Falling commodity prices, rising interest rates, increased equipment costs, rising labour costs are much more serious issues the government should be worried about.
Snow run off from the Rocky Mountains https://t.co/dc9EtzzbEt
@cathmckenna @WestcottWines @VBadawey @Chris_Bittle Hot summer with rain is ideal condition for grain farmers. Ontario has one of the most ideal conditions to grow grain. I would take ONTARIO heat units as a farmer any day.

@krassenstein The same people could also help reunite Mexican families. The most powerful country in the world allegedly allowed a foreign government to interfere with the election of their President. The best election system in the world. So good we help other countries with elections.
@activist360 @onerahinz How did he get elected?
@bosslady2898 @Yanez1Angel @krassenstein A friend of mine is a lawyer in Canada, married a Mexican/American, they lived 10 years in USA, have children with Spanish names and now concerned to visit the USA, how sad is this, this is our new reality.
@maxarmstrong @nwherald If you know these farmers I know an empty dairy barn, ready to milk cows belong to a retired farmer in Lethbridge Alberta. Start milking ASAP, make 40 percent more revenue, Bette life, and I will lend th m the money to get going.

@oSu_WeedScience Where’s the slow moving sign:)
@MT_Integrity @jsreinecker Thanks
@jkenney Need to invest in Ag food processors.
@RealJamesWoods Sad comment
@simply_gary How much is a bale?
@Mike_OEL Farmers are resourceful, anyone who buys something at retail and sells at wholesale has to be.
@jsreinecker How many ton? Capacity (imperial)
@Pasztor79 Looking at your lawn, understand why you are selling.
@mahsti25metana1 The government has billions of $, US government gave them billions to agree to the nuclear deal, where is the money?

@SenatorDurbin @ILSoybean Feeling the pain in Canada, logistical issues, trade war, issues with GMO wheat/Japan, rising interest rates, record farm debt levels all issues farmers facing in 2018. Now a good to strong fall harvest adding more downward pressure on prices.
@mikebelan3 Send Pic of the MF articulating tractor pulling grain buggy, had one, great tractor
@RealJamesWoods And Burr was replaced by Wolcott JR who was related to Governor Daniel CLARK CT Grandfather of Governors of CT. I think Hamilton was also Burr’s cousin.
@RealJamesWoods My 6th cousin 6x removed. Aware of lot more stories.
@drew4955 Cool pic, congrats.
@AnnRoseT @RealJamesWoods What is the purpose of worrying about who the Supreme Court judge is if the legal system cannot be trusted by the people &amp; influenced &amp; controlled by a foreign government? 	Sounds to me people have lost trust and faith in the Democratic and legal system.
@RealJamesWoods People need to start acting civilized, working together and be hopeful of the future. Of all the potential candidates he is in the top 10 picks, qualified for the job, who else do they want as a judge. This is 100 percent related to the fact Trump picked him.
@realDonaldTrump My suggestion is do something about it, if your not happy, not mandatory to be a member, maybe impose more trade tariffs

@SenRubioPress @peymaneh123 Senator Rubio I stand beside you in support. 	Passed some young woman dancing in the local mall on the way home from work today and made me think of how difficult it is to accept the fact anyone would consider this a crime.
@kazweida Underlying root of this problem is deeper and older then many of us can begin to fully understand. Encouraging and supporting diversity and educating the youth on the merits of diversity is not an easy task.
