Rick Scott is campaigning this week -- here are some of the people who might not be joining him on his "victory tour"...
While Rick Scott is campaigning, 800,000+ Floridians remain stranded w/o health care coverage: http://t.co/8mQf257Hy9 http://t.co/IG8FrBXTvY
Happy National Teacher Day to Florida's amazing educators -- including the ones I'm proud to call my sisters, Cathy and Margaret.
Blessed to receive the endorsement of @EvaLongoria and the Latino Victory Project. Welcome to #TeamCharlie, Eva!   http://t.co/ogg9b9l8F1
My friend @DanGelber asks: What is Scott going to say to the 1 million FLs who now have health care under the ACA? http://t.co/gQT3wcrvR2
It's time to cut the pork and re-invest in our kids. Add your name if you agree: http://t.co/FZVSKjp1G5
After vetoing the pork, Scott should call the legislature back to reallocate the funds to education. Do you agree? http://t.co/ZCfk4e2DNw
Scott should judge every pork project by one test: Would this $$ be better spent helping Florida‚Äôs kids? http://t.co/ZCfk4e2DNw
I'm concerned that education funding in the budget is too low -- nothing is more important to long-term job growth. http://t.co/ZCfk4e2DNw
#HB851 shows that bipartisanship can allow FL to do great things. Moments like this should be the norm - not the election-year exception.
Almost 1 million Floridians got covered under ACA. I'm glad to be a loud-and-proud supporter of this law - it's GREAT!!
Even more Floridians would have coverage today if Scott had accepted federal funding for Medicaid.
Despite every obstacle to health care that Rick Scott put up, almost one million Floridians now have affordable health coverage.
