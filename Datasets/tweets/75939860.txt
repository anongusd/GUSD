Trump says Kim agreed to dismantle Yongbyon but that it wasn't enough: "That facility, while very big, it wasn't enough to do what we were doing. We had to have more than that."
Trump won't say he's still demanding "complete and verifiable denuclearization" by DPRK:		"I don't want to put myself in that position from the standpoint of negotiation."
Trump said Cohen lied but except when he said there was no collusion. "I was actually a little impressed." Also called the timing of hearing during summit "terrible."
Trump has pointed to the pause in DPRK nuclear tests as the sign that talks have been positive, says Kim promised he'll continue to halt tests:		"One of the things Chairman Kim promised me last night is he's not going to do testing of rockets and nuclear."
Trump says Kim offered to "denuke" some places but not the ones he wanted: "They weren't willing to do an area we wanted, but not the ones we wanted."
Trump: "Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."
Pompeo: "We asked him to do more, he was unprepared to do that."		Adds he's "optimistic" that "the progress we've made in the last two days puts us in position to do more."
Trump on Kim: "He's quite a guy and quite a character and I think our relationship is very strong... we had some options and at tis time we decided not to do any of the options... Sometimes you have to walk and this was just one of those times."

To the still photographers’ credit, they refused to shoot the dinner if no reporters were allowed in, which was the initial WH response. Because of that solidarity, a print and radio pooler were allowed in with the stills. Four print/wire reporters were still barred.
While the WH punished reporters for asking Trump questions, Trump reveled in the attention of the print photographers allowed into the dinner spray, asking Doug Mills to send him photos so he could share them with Kim.

More Trump quotes on spending deal, via pool:		“I’m not happy about it. It’s not doing the trick.” Says he is “adding things to it”		“Am I happy? The answer is no, I’m not. I’m not happy.”		Says “thrilled” with where they’re headed.
And in case anyone is curious if Trump is still fixated on Beto and last night's competing crowds: he just told the pool that Beto “failed very badly. From what I hear he had less than 1,000 people.”

The NFL took in more than $7 billion from its TV partners last season. But the league still calls the shots: 		“The only business arrangement I can think of where the buyer must continually flatter the seller is the sports TV business,” Costas said.
I’m as conflicted about my fandom as I am angry the Saints got hosed. But there is no ability for anyone at any network that has NFL game rights to express the concerns that Costas did re: concussions. Any time there’s an injury, you just cut to commercial!
During the Super Bowl, Nantz read several scripts about league outreach to African-Americans. He and Romo only once alluded to Rams-Saints no call that produced the SB matchup. Neither the oversell or the avoidance were credible.
This is a great piece that shows why the NFL of today has about as much integrity as WWE — it’s a billion dollar entertainment franchise that requires those who “cover” it on TV to avoid its many issues (anthem protests, garbage rules/officiating, player safety). https://t.co/kpbqcKdbxl

But Mulvaney indicated that the national emergency declaration remains on the table if Democrats say no to this, which he said would prevent 800k federal workers from getting paid: “If the bill is filibustered, people will not get paid.”
As for why Trump is backing this deal after saying he didn’t want to deal with DACA until after a SC ruling, Pence said he was “persuaded [by Democrats] that this is the right thing to do for the country right now.”
KUSHNER told reporters the speech clarified what Trump will support. "This is something that this White House stands behind," he said, nothing that the speech included what he called "overtures" for more comprehensive immigration reform down the road.

Given that statement, hard not to focus on this graf in @JuliaEAinsley's report:		"On the northern border, CBP stopped 91 people listed in the database, including 41 who were not American citizens or residents."		No outcry about a crisis on the U.S.-Canada border? Odd.
RT @tackettdc: “We think it was a productive session,” Pence said. “That does not mean to imply that we made progress in the negotiations.”
Nielsen, speaking to reporters earlier, seemed to indicate that -- whatever the numbers so far -- the government must act out of an abundance of caution:		"We have to get it right every day," she said. "One terrorist is too many."
This report, by @JuliaEAinsley, is brand new. It says CBP encountered SIX PEOPLE on the government's terrorist watch list last year:		https://t.co/wRra7T3DNA
Sec. Nielsen, asked about admin's claims of 4k terrorist apprehensions at the border, admitted that most were at airports. When @acosta read the 2017 State Dept. report stating there were no terror threats coming from Mexico, she said it was "an old report."
Asked about that, Pence said Trump has "made no decision on that" but also that he's "looking at it. The president is considering it." 		Also: "We'd be willing to address this w emergency supplemental funding...we honestly believe we have a crisis at our southern border."
Pence &amp; Nielsen, during lengthy reporter briefing, repeatedly emphasized that border situation amounts to an "urgent crisis." Perhaps the aim is to convince the public or pressure Dems back to the table; but also serves to create pretext for POTUS declaring a national emergency.

Also worth pointing out: little progress to show from here beyond the USMCA signing - and if a big deal with Xi was imminent, he'd undoubtedly be finding a way to tout it. And perhaps no good answers to the Russia probe questions he was sure to get.

@NoamLevey @evanhalper And the Department of Health and Human Services predicted that a regulation lifting restrictions on health plans with skimpier benefits would reduce sicker patients’ access to medical care and expose them higher costs.
@NoamLevey @evanhalper The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in regulatory filings that its proposal to curtail immigrants’ access to Medicaid and other government safety net programs risks increasing malnutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
@NoamLevey @evanhalper The Department of Education, which has taken several steps to scale back rules on for-profit colleges and universities, conceded that one of its rollbacks had left students with more than $50 million in additional debt.
Just a few snippets from this smart @NoamLevey @evanhalper piece:		The EPA, for example, calculated as many as 1,400 more premature deaths a year as a result of its proposed rule providing incentives to electric utilities to keep coal-fired power plants operating longer.

Peru’s president, less pointedly, is following suit. 		Trump is chairing this meeting to show toughness toward Iran and is getting scolded by leader after leader for withdrawing from the JCPOA.
My word, he is just torching Trump—criticizing “contempt for multilateralism” and alleging US foreign policy is driven by greed.		Trump, when he’s finished, simply says “Thank you, Mr. President.”
Bolivia’s president, seated two chairs away from Trump, “categorically condemns” the U.S. for reneging on it’s obligations under JCPOA and for doing so based on “false pretenses.”

Trump claims Dems, engaged in a “con game...know [Kavanaugh]’s high quality. They wink at each other—they know it’s a con game.”		“It would be an insult to our country if this thing doesn’t happen,” he says of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
