@wesjervey @WESH @SCPSInfo I think it is a walk-out, because they lef the school with one purpose. Because they are students, it was smart for them to coordinate it with their principal. Not sure what you mean by "better copy." I used both terms in my story.
@wesjervey @WESH @SCPSInfo No, most students I talked to organized the walk-out with the help of teachers and staff. I suppose you could call it a rally -- a rally where students speak and spread their message.
@KTmeetsWorld Just FYI: the school district DID allow these walk-outs. The principal mistakenly made that announcement because she wasn't aware of the policy.
@JoelDeb @WESH At the school walk-out I attended yesterday, I can say with certainty that 99% of the crowd was paying attention to the speakers, and voicing their opinion.
To be clear: the school DOES allow students to voice their opinions and peacefully protest. In fact, most teachers I talked to SUPPORT it. https://t.co/TI4wzHxDOi

In just a few minutes on @WESH -- I'll explain how a privatized security system works at a local airport. @MCO officials are looking into making the switch.
Cost is also not a factor in the decision to privatize security, I'm told -- airports do not pay @TSA agents. @SFB_Airport tells me they made the change simply bc they believe in privatization.	@WESH
.@SFB_Airport privatized their security a couple years ago. They saw no change in wait times. Most passengers don't know the difference. (SFB sees about 3 million passengers a year.)	@WESH

@Kylestef1 @TSA @MCO @WESH I recently got pre-check, and LOVE it.
@mojerzgirl @WESH @TSA @MCO TSA has suggested adding 19 more security lines.
What do you think about @TSA security lines at @MCO?	@WESH
Orlando passengers: IF security is privatized, you‚Äôll only see different people in different uniforms at @MCO. Screenings, pat-downs, &amp; all other procedures would stay the same. 	@WESH
.@MCO would be the biggest airport to privatize their security screening (if they vote to do so). 	@WESH
If a private contractor takes over screening at @MCO, all security procedures would be the same as at other airports. Employees would go through the same background checks as @TSA screeners. 	@WESH
If Orlando decides to implement private contractors for security screening, @MCO must apply for @TSA‚Äôs Screening Partnership Program (SPP). TSA then has 12 months to award a contract. (TSA‚Äôs ‚Äúscope of authority remains the same‚Äù)	@WESH
.@MCO has 26 screening lanes. Other airports that handle similar crowds (like Miami), have about 50 @TSA screening lanes. 	@WESH
.@TSA screened 21.4 million passengers at @MCO in 2017. Officials say Orlando is most efficient airport in the U.S. but still needs 19 more lanes to improve efficiency. 	@WESH https://t.co/U9SHmtoqae
