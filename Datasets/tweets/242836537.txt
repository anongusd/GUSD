There is another artificial crisis created by one man ‚Äì President Trump. We have bipartisan bills before us that could reopen the government. It‚Äôs time for Republicans &amp; Democrats to join together to tell the President to put a stop to these self-inflicted wounds. #TrumpShutdown
There is a crisis. It's the crisis at the kitchen table as families struggle to make ends meet. A crisis of morale for the dedicated people who serve our country, a crisis of confidence in the young people doubting a career in public service. &amp; the President simply walks away.
The great irony of the #TrumpShutdown is that it‚Äôs making our borders less safe. 88 percent of the DHSecurity, including 54,000 at CBP, 51,000 at TSA and 42,000 at Coast Guard are working without pay. IF this WAS about border security, they would be getting PAID.

From Appropriations Vice Chair Patrick Leahy: FACT CHECKING Pres. Trump‚Äôs Manufactured Crisis Over Funding His Proposed Wall https://t.co/XAuLexkKME https://t.co/8eQVmIMB5Q
If there was an ‚Äúurgent need‚Äù to construct a wall, Pres. Trump wouldn‚Äôt have to rely on so many blatant falsehoods. His obsession with a wall is nothing more than a desperate attempt to please his base and protect his ego. Read my full statement HERE: https://t.co/nhZDuvKy2y
#FACT: The Trump Administration has only spent 6 percent ‚Äì SIX PERCENT ‚Äì of the $1.7 billion the Congress has appropriated over the last two years to build or replace fencing on the southern border. That does not sound like an urgent need for additional billions in funding.
#FACT: Border fencing construction is not ‚Äúunder budget.‚Äù The largest stretch of fencing that Congress has funded, a 25 mile barrier in the Rio Grande Valley, has ballooned in cost, from $445 to $787 million ‚Äì a price tag of $31.5 million per mile for taxpayers.
#FALSE: Pres. Trump‚Äôs repeated claim that wall construction is under budget, and that additional funding for the wall is an urgent need.
#FACT: A staunchly conservative organization that advocates for restricting immigration, @CIS_org, issued a report concluding only 15 suspected terrorists have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border SINCE 2001.
#FACT: Approx. 10 ppl w suspected terrorist ties are prevented from traveling to the U.S. every day ‚Äúby air, sea, or land.‚Äù That does NOT mean they‚Äôre entering the southern border. &amp; a wall along our southern border does not stop a potential terrorist from flying into an airport.
#FALSE: Pres. Trump‚Äôs claim that we recently ‚Äúcaptured 10 terrorists‚Äù at the southern border over a ‚Äúvery short period of time.‚Äù
#FACT: At the end of 2017, arrests of people attempting to illegally enter the U.S. dropped to the lowest level since 1971. Between 2000 &amp; 2018, border apprehensions fell sharply from roughly 1.6 m. in FY 2000 to approximately 400,000 in FY 2018 ‚Äì that's a 75% drop.
#FALSE: Pres. Trump‚Äôs repeated claim that we have a crisis-level surge of illegal immigration at our southern border.
With border crossings declining for years, and no true crisis to point to, the President has spun a manufactured crisis to justify his ineffective and costly border wall. Let‚Äôs fact check some of his outlandish claims --
A #TrumpShutdown has REAL consequences for REAL people. Nearly 800k ppl would be furloughed just before the holidays or forced to work w/o pay. Services would grind to a halt. All, over a desperate attempt by the Pres to please his base &amp; protect his ego. https://t.co/xwXlU6UTln
What‚Äôs the impact of a #TrumpShutdown? 380,000 people out of work. 420,000 people forced to work without pay. 9 of 15 federal departments and dozens of agencies will shutter their doors, grinding services to the American people to a halt.  https://t.co/xwXlU6UTln

Every minute of Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony was credible. I‚Äôll never forget what she can never forget: the ‚Äúuproarious laughter‚Äù of Kavanaugh and his friend. I believe Dr. Ford, and I stand with her and other survivors. #IBelieveChristine
This FBI investigation was meant to shed light on the allegations. The White House instead used it to stifle the voices of dozens of individuals who had information that could corroborate the allegations. But no one can silence the voices of Americans who stand with survivors. https://t.co/nGfr6OoW3I

Thank you Emily. https://t.co/k0NVrxAmtT
Amen. https://t.co/ObxAVGgwlK
BOTTOM LINE: It‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúBart O‚ÄôKavanaugh,‚Äù or minimizing his contemporaneous drinking or misogyny in his yearbook. On issues big and small, anytime Judge Kavanaugh is faced with an incriminating or difficult question under oath, he cannot be trusted to tell the truth.
Ex. 5b-d: Emails also show that Kavanaugh prepped the AG for a hearing on post-9/11 detention policies, was looped in on legal questions regarding detention, &amp; was included on efforts to spin torture days after the ignominious Torture Memo was public. https://t.co/0571ODCbA4
Ex. 5a: Media reports have shown that Kavanaugh was involved in WH debates about the capture and detention of U.S. citizen ‚Äúenemy combatants‚Äù without access to lawyers. https://t.co/LTahAD6XAR
Exhibit 5: Kavanaugh stated under oath that he ‚Äúwas not involved‚Ä¶in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants,‚Äù a highly controversial set of policies pursued by the Bush WH in the wake of 9/11. False again.
THREAD #5: A point-by-point breakdown of Judge Kavanaugh's claims about his work on a Bush administration detention and interrogation policies.
Kavanaugh could have told me he was only involved in early discussions on warrantless wiretapping, but he did not directly work on the classified program. Instead he denied everything. Again, his testimony is just not credible.
On the same day, Yoo wrote a memo to Flanigan on ‚Äúthe legality of a ‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô electronic surveillance program.‚Äù This memo, along with another Yoo memo, provided the legal authority for the warrantless NSA wiretapping program detailed in the NYT article.
The reality? Ex. 4a: In a 2001 email to John Yoo, BCC‚Äôing Timothy Flanigan, Kavanaugh asks ‚ÄúAny results yet on the 4A [Fourth Amendment] implications of random/constant surveillance of phone and e-mail conversations ‚Ä¶?‚Äù https://t.co/EEaOj9oMcc
His reply: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing at all?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing at all,‚Äù he testified. He later reiterated in writing, ‚ÄúI had no involvement in meetings, briefings, or other discussions in shaping the program or the legal justification for the program.‚Äù
Exhibit 4: In 2006, I asked Kavanaugh about his knowledge of a controversial warrantless wiretapping program, disclosed in a 2005 article.  I asked, ‚ÄúYou had not seen anything, or had you heard anything about it, prior to the New York Times article?‚Äù
THREAD #4: A point-by-point breakdown of Judge Kavanaugh's claims about his work on a controversial wireless wiretapping program.
Ex.3b-d: In fact Kavanaugh was a point person on this nom, often the only WH counsel on Pickering emails. He worked with DOJ, edited talking points, talked with Congress, &amp; coordinated events. Merely saying Pickering was not one he ‚Äúprimarily‚Äù worked on is dishonest at best. https://t.co/EXBNYSklnM
Ex.3a: Emails show that Kavanaugh did substantial work on the Pickering nomination. He even drafted White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez‚Äôs op-ed praising and defending Pickering. https://t.co/UwnVrgmYFg
Exhibit 3: Kavanaugh distanced himself from the controversial nomination of Judge Pickering, testifying that Pickering was not one that he primarily worked on &amp; that he was not assigned to it. Once again, Kavanaugh left senators with an utterly false impression.
THREAD #3: A point-by-point breakdown of Judge Kavanaugh's claims about his work on Judge Pickering's nomination.
Even in written responses he sent in 7 months later, his only admission to working on Pryor was that he participated in general ‚Äúmeetings of a judicial selection committee‚Äù that discussed 19 nominees including Pryor. He did not correct his earlier, unequivocally false testimony.
The reality? Ex. 2a ‚Äì 2d: Kavanaugh was the one who first recommended Pryor. He was on the ‚ÄúPryor Working Group‚Äù and smaller coordination and strategy groups for the Pryor nomination.  He even apparently interviewed Pryor. https://t.co/q4MbCUL0FD
Kavanaugh testified repeatedly that Pryor was ‚Äúnot one that I worked on personally‚Äù other than a standard moot session (long after Pryor had been vetted). No senator left his 2004 hearing thinking otherwise.
Exhibit 2: There‚Äôs also Kavanaugh‚Äôs work on Judge Pryor, who called Roe an abomination. In a 10 minute exchange with Sen. Kennedy about whether he helped ‚Äúvet‚Äù (select and review) Judge Pryor, Kavanaugh explicitly denied any role in his vetting. That was objectively false.
THREAD #2: A point-by-point breakdown of Judge Kavanaugh's claims about his work on Judge Pryor's nomination.
Then there‚Äôs this: I‚Äôve seen nominees try to dodge questions before. I‚Äôve never seen a nominee flat-out refuse to answer ANY new questions, especially when it concerns their knowledge of a massive, multi-year theft. https://t.co/SChPDmMkHV
Ex. 1i,j,k,l: More inside, real-time info about what Democratic staff were researching, sharing, and tracking down. On controversial matters, the notion that such things would be shared ‚Äúby friends across the aisle‚Äù is just not credible. It‚Äôs laughable. https://t.co/dzGScaw5Lm
Ex.1h: Kavanaugh received a private letter from me &amp; other Dems to Sen. Daschle. It was never made public &amp; Kavanaugh had it before there was any mention of it in the press. Hard to imagine a savvy political operative didn‚Äôt know exactly what he had: a STOLEN nonpublic letter. https://t.co/AMjw9AwyLZ
Ex.1g: Here‚Äôs Miranda sharing what I was looking into regarding a controversial nominee days before her hearing. Miranda even asked for help explaining why it was relevant‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt learn about it from good faith conversations with ‚Äúfriends across the aisle‚Äù as he testified. https://t.co/0z6N6C93xF
Ex.1f: Miranda requested an off-site meeting with Kavanaugh and another Trump-appointed judge, Don Willet, wanting to hand them ‚Äúpaper‚Äù on Democratic senators‚Äô thinking. If legitimate, why not email or fax it? I just asked Kavanaugh about off-site meetings; he refused to answer. https://t.co/ADEYWYvkUm
Ex.1e: Kavanaugh forwards an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù email from another Republican staffer who appears in 1000s of emails with Miranda. It contains intel allegedly from a ‚Äúmole‚Äù with the subject ‚Äúspying.‚Äù I asked Kavanaugh in 2004 if he had heard of a Democratic ‚Äúmole‚Äù‚Äîhe did not answer. https://t.co/mVmjvyL4N3
Ex.1d: Here‚Äôs Miranda sharing he had it on ‚Äú100% info that Leahy is trying to convene the Dems this afternoon.‚Äù Clearly Miranda trusted Kavanaugh: He asked Kavanaugh to ‚Äúrefer to rumor, not to me‚Äù even when sharing the info with other Bush administration officials‚Ä¶. https://t.co/FNCYlggy4B
Ex.1c: Here‚Äôs Miranda sharing ‚Äúhighly confidentail‚Äù [sic] info about what Sen. Biden‚Äôs staff was advising him on a controversial hearing. It also says what my staff was sharing with other Democrats. If this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù info to receive, why label it highly confidential? https://t.co/k2id3OXYVi
Ex.1b: Here‚Äôs a memo Kavanaugh received in his inbox the day after my staff sent it to me. It represents extensive research on a critical argument that Democrats intended to make. If it were legitimately obtained, why would Miranda tell Kavanaugh it‚Äôs not for distribution? https://t.co/tSRKlATrNX
Ex.1a: Here‚Äôs Kavanaugh receiving a highly confidential letter written to me about a nominee‚Äôs position on abortion. It was so secret the sender believed she‚Äôd be fired if it got out. Miranda even said take ‚Äúno action‚Ä¶except as I request.‚Äù Kavanaugh responded minutes later. https://t.co/kA0h73LGCG
Exhibit 1: After Kavanaugh ally Manny Miranda stole 4,670 Democratic files on controversial Bush nominees, Kavanaugh testified, over and over, that he never received stolen materials or anything that appeared to be prepared by Dems or even anything ‚Äúuntoward.‚Äù That‚Äôs just FALSE.
THREAD #1: A point-by-point breakdown of Judge Kavanaugh's claims about the Manny Miranda email theft scandal.
In ‚Äò04 and ‚Äò06, his confirmation to the DC Circuit was at risk. He was known only as a hyper-partisan political operative. With a promotion in the balance, when asked under oath about his work in the Bush WH on controversial issues and nominees, he dissembled and misled.
It‚Äôs no surprise that Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs veracity is an issue now‚Äîit‚Äôs ALWAYS been an issue. When facing questions that may incriminate him, or place him in the middle of controversy, Kavanaugh has misled the Senate EVERY SINGLE TIME he‚Äôs testified.
THREADS AHEAD: Here are POINT-BY-POINT breakdowns, accompanied by exhibits and organized by topic, explaining numerous instances where Judge Kavanaugh misled the Senate under oath.

I said during the Thomas hearings that I believed Anita Hill, and I still do. The Senate must do better this time.  We have an obligation to the Constitution, to Dr. Ford, to Judge Kavanaugh, and to the American people to get this right.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination has been a flawed process from the beginning. Republicans have consistently sought to hide his record from the American people. This latest, most serious allegation deserves rigorous scrutiny.  The process must not be rushed through.
This is a crucial test for the US Senate.  The integrity of this body, and of our nation‚Äôs highest court, is on the line.
Dr. Ford has shown incredible courage. This allegation speaks directly to the nominee‚Äôs character then and truthfulness now. Before any other steps, there should be a nonpartisan evaluation by professionals trained on trauma-informed investigations.

President Trump should also reflect on Justice Kennedy‚Äôs legacy, and select a nominee who will be a fair-minded, independent jurist. It‚Äôs past time for the President to represent ALL Americans, not just a favored few.
Pres. Trump should listen to the voices of millions of concerned Americans worried that they are on the verge of losing their hard-fought, hard-won rights.  An extreme candidate who would jeopardize the rights of women, minorities and #LGBT Americans is unacceptable.
President Trump should use this time to do what President Obama did: Find a mainstream, consensus nominee who would garner broad bipartisan support. That means #DitchTheList.
There is no justification for rushing this process. Every Republican embraced the #McConnellStandard last Congress to allow the American people an opportunity to weigh in so close to an election. We can wait now, just as we did then.

Pres. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy needs to go. It makes zero sense to delay civil proceedings to criminally prosecute migrants with no records, who pose no threat, and who are only seeking refuge from unimaginable violence and terror in their home countries.
Indefinite incarceration of families is NOT the answer. I condemned incarceration of families during the Obama administration and will do so again now. Proven alternatives exist that are effective, less costly, and infinitely more humane.
Today the American people, through their forceful and justified outrage, proved they can drive change even during the Trump administration.  But we must not be fooled: We need to ensure that the 2,500 children already separated are promptly reunited with their families.

#CambridgeAnalytica was Trump before Trump. At the direction of Steve Bannon in 2014, it tested messages like ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù and ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù and tested policies of Russian President Putin. These later became the defining themes of candidate Trump. https://t.co/2FpAHgDg9Y

I hope the Supreme Court sees this ban for what it is: an unconstitutional religious test that has no place in a country settled by refugees fleeing religious persecution. This ban doesn‚Äôt just threaten the First Amendment, it threatens our nation‚Äôs very identity.

Here is then-Director of the FBI James Comey agreeing with a Department of Homeland Security report that citizenship alone, the premise of the travel ban, is not a reliable indicator of a terrorist threat. https://t.co/xLA5ABihxs
The President‚Äôs #TravelBan has nothing to do with national security. Watch what our top national security officials told me when I asked them about the underlying premise of the Travel Ban:
The President unveiled his #TravelBan days after taking office, a bid to fulfill his campaign pledge for a ‚Äúcomplete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.‚Äù ‚Äì a pledge that remained on his campaign website for months into his presidency, until I asked about it publicly.
Tomorrow the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case against President Trump‚Äôs #TravelBan on citizens from mostly Muslim-majority countries. #SCOTUS

I have never been more concerned for our nation‚Äôs institutions, and for our ability to stay united in the face of the real and ongoing threat of #Russian interference in our democracy. Enough with the partisan distractions. It is time we face this threat together as Americans.
The only thing this President has done in response to the #Russia threat is to disparage the very people who defend our country from such attacks: our dedicated law enforcement and intelligence professionals. With this President, it is Trump first, and America second.
It is worth remembering what is at stake here. This is not about the #NunesMemo or the Steele dossier. Both are side-stories. The only thing that matters is that a foreign adversary attacked our democracy in 2016, suffered no consequences, and is poised to do it again.

As President Trump brags that he‚Äôs ‚ÄúREBUILDING RURAL AMERICA,‚Äù here‚Äôs a reality check from the #BudgetTruthSquad: Donald Trump is a DISASTER for #RuralAmerica.

(4/4) I'm now fighting to include my amdt in the final omnibus Approps bill so we can protect patients and law-abiding businesses. With an AG determined to waste finite DOJ resources to prosecute even those who are compliant with state law, this amdt is more important than ever
(3/4) We need to protect the patients and dispensaries in the 46 states with medical marijuana and CBD laws. As Vice Chair of Appropriations, I offered an amdt in Committee to do just that ‚Äì and it was approved with a bipartisan voice vote.
(2/4) Make no mistake, the Cole memo NEVER PREVENTED the gov from going after bad actors, like those who traffic marijuana to minors or across state lines. ONLY reason to rescind the memo is because the AG wants to target patients &amp; businesses that are COMPLIANT with state laws.
In 2013, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I held a hearing on the conflict betw. federal laws and evolving state laws on marijuana. That hg. prompted DOJ to release the Cole memo. Rescinding that memo is a terrible, facts-backwards decision by Atty Gen Sessions.
