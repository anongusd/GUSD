@cvpayne Don't ask questions where there may be an answer that makes asking the question reflect poorly on you for asking.
@kylegriffin1 When you view the Manafort and Cohen charges you must conclude that Donald Trump and his children may also be involved in tax evasion, money laundering, and bank fraud.  It is likely to a greater magnitude.
@GOPLeader Congratulations,  you are the leading presidential sycophant.
@EdwardGLuce Selling golf club memberships from the oval office.
@PreetBharara Great point!
@GOPLeader Have you looked at the deficit lately?  You are to blame for that number.
@GOPLeader Learning that vulgarity from Donald Trump I see.  What a sycophant!
@tackettdc @shearm Michael Cohen is a comprimised man.  Donald Trump is even more comprimised.  The longer he is President the more the public will learn about exactly how comprimised this President is.
@mkraju That's hardly enough for such bad behavior.
@GOPLeader @RepMarkMeadows Guess again Kevin, your fellow Republicans all had the appearance of Trump sycophants.  It's a sickness among you, that you would sacrifice our Democracy for power.  Few people of character are left in the Republican House.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @NBCNews Mark Meadows is just one of the many Trump sycophants that are part of the House Oversight Committee.
@GOPoversight @RepCarolMiller You're participation in the Cohen hearing demonstrated that you just another Trump sycophant.  Find something else to do.
@gtconway3d The President is surrounded by a claque of scheming bureaucrats.
@PreetBharara Donald Trump has been speaking mobster for a long time.
@tackettdc Donald Trump regularly speaks in gibberish that comes from braggidicio, half-truths, and lies.
@TeaPainUSA @GOP Michael Cohen was just one of the many grifters in the Trump orbit.
@GOP Yep, just another one of the regular grifters in the Trump orbit.
@RepThomasMassie Are you a good congressman?  Is protecting a sick excuse of a president your job?
@RepGosar @GOPoversight Listen to Cohen.  You are wallowing in the mud with this pig of a president.
@RepMarkGreen There is no one in the Trump orbit that is credible.  So today your questioning of Michael Cohen facilitates the malfeasance of that universe.  This is not politics it's criminal.

@senatemajldr Let me explain it to you.  It's known as the federal deficit.  Fiscal responsibility once was a pillar of the Republican platform.  It's a prime reason to say we no longer have a Republican party.
@davidhogg111 We are counting on you to continues shouting out from your platform!

His actions placed his personal financial gain ahead of the need to beat back Russian attempts at interfering with American elections.
The lid has been pried back and it revealed that during his transition to office Donald Trump was promising to remove the Obama election interference sanctions and at the same time was promoting a real estate deal in Moscow.  This is a clear conflict of interest on his part......
Donald Trump thought he had nailed his secrets into a tight little box that could not be opened.  Now it seems that the Russia Investigation and others have removed nail after nail holding down the cover on those secrets.  ...............

Would someone please tell the President that there are liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans in civil service for all government agencies.  He should try refraining from his complaining about bias.  Grow up!
@johnpavlovitz I actually hope he makes it to 2020.  I want to see him humbled by the ballot box.
@GOPLeader When I consider the plethora of ways Republicans have chosen to alienate American voters I just shake my head in bewilderment.  Clean your own house up before district 23 ends up like 21.
@realDonaldTrump I am available for an interview if you send a plane around.  I have never been to D.C.  I not making any promises though.
@Mimirocah1 I don't really understand why everyone isn't saying that Trump directed his attorney to bribe those women to obtain their silence. That sure seems like exactly what they did. Bribery sure seems like the correct word with the correct connotation.
@GreggJarrett Thanks for sharing your thoughts, you saved me a lot of time I might have wasted reading that book of yours.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, we all know your record of military service.  Be smart, keep quiet about it.
@gimleteyemiami @davidaxelrod @JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump Impeached?  He'd be in jail by now.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump I don't understand why Donald isn't leaving at the end of the year with John Kelly.  It would be a perfect time for him to go so we could get off a good start in 2019.
@thehill Why? Oh why, did you hire him then?  If you want to see lazy look in the mirror.  That mirror will reveal a man too lazy to hire the best people as he promised.
@neeratanden I'm in district 21 and I voted against Valadao because he was a rubber stamp for Donald Trump.
If Tillerson was "Dumb as a rock" why did you hire him?  You promise to hire the best people.  Why aren't you doing that?
@DearAuntCrabby If only we could hear that from Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.
@CBCPolitics Don't worry she will get it "when hell freezes over."
@byaaroncdavis @shaneharris @karoun Will someone please ask Pompeo why his story doesn't match with Haspel?  Is he listening to the Donald Trump dog whistles?
@washingtonpost The next thing you know Donald Trump is going to start calling people on the phone telling them he is from Microsoft and that something is wrong with their computer.
@EricTrump @KellyannePolls Oh please!
@WalshFreedom I'd call it bat-shit crazy and obstruction of justice.
@GreggJarrett Let's be clear, the word wise and Donald Trump do not fit in the same sentence together.  The more appropriate term today is vindictive.
@Walldo @politicalwire #unhinged
@politicalwire Drug test?  A full psychiatric workup for DT is really more appropriate.
@AllenWest do you not realize that Donald is in water that is well over his head?  #GoldStar
@Clewandowski you be wise to let Donald swim in the deep of the pool by himself.  #GoldStar
