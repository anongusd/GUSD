@realDonaldTrump Trump is the opposition. He is very bad for our Great Country. He wipes his butt with the Constitution and the ideals of representative government on the daily. Now, off to my 9-5 to listen to all of my co-workers talk about how much they hate Donald Trump too.
@realDonaldTrump I saw a news report on Avenatti taking one of the children you kidnapped back to his Mother.  It made me really happy to watch them crying and hugging each other as they were reunited.
@ChrisCuomo The larger issue, as a common citizen, is that he is repeatedly abusing his power to attack private citizens and government officials, former and current. This is authoritarian and should be addressed officially, but it is not.
The official response from the Republicans on Trump's use of Presidential Power to retaliate and intimidate those who were involved in the investigation of election interference is treasonous too.  Enabling this wanna be dictator daily. They are unfit for office as well.
