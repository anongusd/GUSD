And that‚Äôs when you need a president like Klobuchar to get things done. Walk the walk instead of talking the talk. She has proven herself in possession of the skills and grit that it requires.
And I always hold this question for the progressives. Now there is basically no clear path for the Dems to win back the senate before 2022. How do they think they will get those three pillar issues through Congress without compromise?
The green new deal (she called it aspirational. I call it a dream) free college for all and Medicare for all.(the last two I really appreciate the efforts but given our debt and deficit no thanks)

@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu How do you know? You are the district commander or general?
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu Justify what? You need a UN motion to state that we are there for human peace and love. Goodness.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu Do you remember in 2016 debate Donald Trump trashes HRC‚Äúyou have no plan‚Äù. How do you know there is no plan. I may not have confidence in Donald Trump but I do have faith in my military and the experienced generals.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu The current plans are 1. Make sure Isis get further exterminated 2. Make sure Turks don‚Äôt get rogue with the Kurds.3 rein in Russia influence in Syria.4.make sure the safety of the civilians from another potential humanitarian crisis.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu I‚Äôm sorry bro but your logic is absolutely flawed here. If congress would get them back in several months , what‚Äôs the point of the withdrawal? To give assad and Russia and isis a holiday?
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu Check republican and democratic senators and reps. Check politicians of both sides.
@DeafChamber @tedlieu Do you even hear yourself? It‚Äôs in our best interest to make sure Syria doesn‚Äôt degrade into Russian backyards and Iranian and Turkish accomplice. But we are failing the strategic goal and the withdrawal is the last straw.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu The point is not being liked. The point is retaining strategic advantages and avoid more escalating situations.
@DeafChamber @tedlieu There is no solid ground whatsoever under this circumstances to pull the soldiers out of Syria.
@DeafChamber @tedlieu Dude democracy‚Äôs strength relies on its flexibility as well as its procedures. The right of president personal military choices is acquiescent under our living constitution like gay marriage and other issues. If congress don‚Äôt like it, they can introduce a bill to change it.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu getting hurt. It dose not mean and never means our military presence should disappear in critical parts of the world. Unfortunately, the Middle East is the most important one.
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu it‚Äôs absolutely wrong. The current ignorance and recklessness will lead to more severe regional conflicts and terrorism in the future at which point we have to put more men and women at risk to fight the evil fight. It‚Äôs our military job to cut off the risk of our soldiers
@DeafChamber @growing0up0girl @tedlieu I will say it again. We all cherish our soldiers‚Äô lives and I‚Äôm a centrist neither a solid dem or rep so I don‚Äôt hate trump, I just find him stupid and incompetent. However if you think cherishing our soldiers lives means sacrifice all strategic advantages across the world,
@DeafChamber @tedlieu And bro there is nothing in Middle East is about postureZ it‚Äôs real politics. When Russia snatch the influence over the Middle East, it will take US forever to recover.
@DeafChamber @tedlieu Yes they don‚Äôt have congress approval so that‚Äôs his job to get it done instead of blindly supporting withdrawal.
@DeafChamber @tedlieu Fighting isis is not a war? You serious? And what stats made you think they are completely annihilated?
@tedlieu By the way bring our men and women home is everyone‚Äôs wish but it is nowhere near sane under certain circumstances. If you are fighting a war , and you say just bring our soldiers home. That‚Äôs called surrender sir.
@growing0up0girl @tedlieu Sure sister. He absolutely owes this to people who support him all the way including me.
@tedlieu 3. Without US assistance and support, where do you leave the Kurds? 4. Do you think the US withdrawal gonna be followed suit by Russia? 5. What‚Äôs your diplomatic plan to sort it out? And without military presence, how are you gonna gain the upper hand during the negotiations?
@tedlieu 9. If the situation deteriorates in Syria and then there come another humanitarian crisis? Are you willing to send our men and women again probably with a much bigger scale? 10. Don‚Äôt ask people questions until you answer ours cause you are the public servant.
@tedlieu 6. If Syria continues to be a strong Iran and Russia ally in Syria, how are you gonna regain our regional influence or you think the Middle East means nothing to us. 7. What if ISIS revive and expand? 8. Are yousure by withdrawing our soldiers there won‚Äôt be a mess in the future
@tedlieu Here are the questions you need to answer. 1. Are you supporting a Russia backed Assad government who repeatedly showed no mercy to the civilians and do you think it‚Äôs the perfect end state for Syria ? 2 How does no military presence get us to the end state?
@tedlieu Just stop making excuses. This is a wrong and fatal mistake. Period. You can make all the arguments you want. It wont change the fact.

@tedlieu @POTUS You know I‚Äôm telling the bruta truth you might not like. Yet this is it.
@tedlieu @POTUS And there is this. If you think we can figure this out in a political way, there goes the hope. As soon as Russia controls the Middle East, we will have not a bit upper hand at all on the negotiation table. We will be humiliated in a harsh way even in the diplomatic approach.
@tedlieu @POTUS The US under Trump has already lost trust of our allies. I can assure you this will not make it better only to make everything stuck into mud situation once again. Then the US would have to send more men and women to sort it out. This is absolutely ridiculous.
@tedlieu @POTUS And sir you think no military presence in Syria will sort this out? You think when the US influence in the Middle East die down, there will be no one to pick it up? I bet you that Putin doesn‚Äôt think so. Plus where do you leave the Kurds? Let them be exterminated by Turkey?
