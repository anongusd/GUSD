@SerenityCH3 @StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @Dillanos Yes
@jondillabaugh Hi,Michael Avenatti owned Tully's coffee. They were a large chain of coffee shops. We are a wholesale roaster. We supplied his coffee. The $160,000 represented only a few weeks worth of beans. We cut him off when he wouldn't pay, he had to close. That's it!
@DaddyKGY @StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @Dillanos I Just want the money that is owed to my company @Dillanos. We hire great people regardless of political affiliations.
@bubbamike @SammyPiccolo @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @Dillanos We are talking about someone that actually owes me money. Not sure what your point is. Get political somewhere else. I just want to get paid

@bubbamike @SammyPiccolo @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti @Dillanos I‚Äôd ask him to pay up. This is not a political thing it‚Äôs roasting coffee and selling it to someone and getting paid for it as agreed!
