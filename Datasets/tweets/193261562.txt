@cheesyscot I have outrage over this also but more that these schools are gun free zones where school staff are not trained with guns to protect their students. All mass shooting occur in gun free zones.

@cheesyscot Oh Liberal tactic change the subject when you lose! These are two different issues. Read my timeline. I invite you to Southern border also.
@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir I beg to differ! Part of the need for a wall is criminal element. I lived the horrors on border while you stick your head in sand. Enough time spent on you.
@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir How pathetic a response. Is that all you've got? I presented you with facts. You are too afraid to see the truth. How sad you are. Have a nise day.

@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir I invite you and everyone who claim this is not true to have a campout anywhere on border where there is not a wall/fence. Spend the night! Watch out for cayotes ( not the 4 legged kind) Sincerely a American Border resident!
@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir Dismembered bodies left on U.S. side as warning. Go to YouTube if not removed to view them. The horrors go on and on! I was attacked by cartel gang member! Lucky to be alive as you are.
@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir Ranchers on border hesitate to use cell phones because lookout cayotes will shoot them out of fear ranchers calling border patrol. Ranchers have their doors marked in blood with warnings.
@DeplorableChoir @bigk20171 These criminals travel with women and children they pay the cayotes for. Yes human trafficking! 10 yrs ago I never say a rape tree, now they are a common site! 70% women and girls are raped.
@maxxx__power @DeplorableChoir The type of people crossing now are different than even 10 years ago. They are 16 to 30 year old males many gang &amp; cartel affiliated. Remind you of say EU Crisis???
