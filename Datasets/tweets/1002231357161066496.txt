@MilspecP @JeffWhiteCat Q 2913, dropped 3:54pm 3/2/2019
@SnowWhite7IAM @POTUS And Alan seems to forget that we are a "Constitutional Republic" not a Democracy.
@TrueEyeTheSpy @onthelastTrump The message is more important than the messenger.
@Headsnipe011 @TheJonGrubb here's the senate site, they have a calendar that's updated daily.	https://t.co/EdesAUpOwa	You might not have these twatt sites.	https://t.co/4MoaPNgy7Y	https://t.co/kxfXQ4FPWh
@FederalSpyGuy Just come back with some really great info.
@outlawjw @BiancoReal https://t.co/OOUwaBTKY8	This is a good article regarding the problems they have. More like 2T in debt.
@CassandraRules https://t.co/EdesAUpOwa	has the voting results of bills.	D's: Jones, Manchin &amp; Casey voted for it. 	These R's didn't vote:	Cramer (R-ND)	Murkowski (R-AK)	Scott (R-SC)	51 R's voted for it.	Would have needed 4 more D's to proceed forward, even if the 3 above had voted.
@Peoples_Pundit @mac3170 https://t.co/QAb4HrpOiB	https://t.co/oQ1CAFTrL3	Found these 2 accounts that give updates for the house and senate
@JackPosobiec Where's the rest of this document? it would be an interesting read.
@1776Stonewall Once everyone in the south saw the failure of Carter, he lost re-election in 80 due to his failed policies.
@1776Stonewall There was no switch, Nixon went after the rural D's in 72 and won them over. Hence they ran Carter in '76 attempting to win the D's back since Carter was a rural D from the south.
@Peoples_Pundit @mac3170 https://t.co/EdesAUpOwa	Is a link that I look at to see final vote count in the senate. Also has a calendar that gets updated daily with upcoming items in the Senate. I believe similar House site is available.
@Peoples_Pundit @mac3170 Will have to wait and see. Moonves is gone last several months and dont forget that "Ben Rhodes" brother CBS News Pres - David Rhodes is gone now as of the first of this year. An alot of this Jussie info from Chicago has been coming from CBS sources it seems.
@ROYALMRBADNEWS @ReenieKFarms I think it's more important what Q has shown us, not who Q is.
@1776Stonewall I'm a liberal and I want you to just give me the answer. I shouldn't have to figure out the correct answer. LOL

Supposedly the ledger was proven fake by someone within the NABU.

And they have a info sharing agreement. https://t.co/zS8fP7PvZ8
@Jordan_Sather_ I think you are going to be the poster child for conspiracy theory. LOL
@LisaMei62 Who funds Amazon? Must be the Clowns
@StormIsUponUs @2runtherace @POTUS Well we know Posochic has denounced himself with his Microchip BS.
@GregRubini @QdaYoda It's here.   https://t.co/CTgWmd6NbP
@GregRubini CEO-Moonves is gone, as well as David Rhodes (Ben Rhodes brother a.k.a. EchoChamber)
@RoscoeBDavis1 @tracybeanz Actually Rosenstein fired him.
@lukerosiak @vjeannek @Cernovich Check out a book called "Billion Dollar Whale" it's about the 1MDB scandal that's becoming public, they have a good explanation as to why the book from the 2 journo's that wrote it.
@LisaMei62 @realDonaldTrump When the Dept of Health shuts down your business, they don't allow you to reopen until you correct the issues, they don't allow you to say "we'll fix it" before reopening.	The same with OSHA, if you are building they shut you down until you correct the problem, not on a promise.
@DawsonSField If you want to read some great information about the 1MDB scandal, check out this book. https://t.co/1a67zFyyAP	I checked it out via my public library 3 months ago when it came out. Lots of very good info. It was the best book that I read last yr.
@TheRealHublife https://t.co/5ue2RL7o73	In 1987 DJT states that he's a Republican .
@LarrySchweikart @Oilersrebuild3 This probably means the FISA IG report will come out after the mid-terms.
@qntmpkts https://t.co/exejFpWgPC seems to be lagging with msg's. Question? Do you have the source available if other's want to run the site to further spread the msg's?
@actual_chaos @JKHomestead @redsteeze https://t.co/mMSAaYp81G	watch at the end Graham ask's questions about mil law vs comman law
@LexingtonAl Is this statement directed to me?
@LarrySchweikart @Avvocata_Bella Why Jan?? So he can appoint Flakey after he's done Jan 2nd?
@RealEyeTheSpy @Flavia1024 October surprise!!
@rising_serpent https://t.co/7ZQjAxKSBT		Here's the info
@rising_serpent I'll have to find the link, local law enforcement is saying he used a stolen ID.
@drawandstrike @hfinch61 @ChuckRossDC Reporter's should ask the D's daily when the testimony transcripts will be released and what's the delay in releasing them? DAILY! for 7 days, then every hour nonstop.
@canalvillere @LarrySchweikart @BreitbartNews D's would never do that. Remember Cocaine Mitch warned them when Harry Reid changed the rules for some votes that it would come back to haunt them sooner then they realize and look what happened. We have Gorsuch!!
@canalvillere @LarrySchweikart @BreitbartNews You are correct, hopefully a supermajority could get some laws passed. Just remember RINO's can be a problem at times. Do some research on ACA and see how they passed with using supermajority, (i.e. we need to pass this bill to see what's in it)
@canalvillere @LarrySchweikart @BreitbartNews Yes the Senate had 60 Dem votes in 2009. Do you remember how ACA passed? look it up. The senate and house each had a version of ACA. They had to go with the Senate version after the death of Ted Kennedy when his replacement was Scott Brown and the Dems only had 59 votes.
@woodruffbets @ChuckRossDC Does this mean Johnny Depp is a Russian Pirate?
@LarrySchweikart @rickterp752 Tim Scott:In 2013, he was appointed U.S. Senator by South Carolina governor Nikki Haley to replace the retiring Jim DeMint. Scott later won a Senate special election in 2014 and was elected to a full term in 2016.
@drawandstrike @ChuckRossDC They would rather bring the whole system DOWN to cover for 1 corrupt person. Great way to gut the C_A instead of the truth of 1 corrupt person.
@1776Stonewall Actually they have back pedaled on this as this afternoon due to backlash from parents
@SpaceCorpsUS @andylassner @TheRealHublife look where one of your favorite's is heading.
@mitchellvii @hfinch61 @therealhublife They'll bring out Obottom.
@drawandstrike Start by asking them this. "What if Qanon is real?"
@StyleKbs @SageAine1 @TheRealHublife @POTUS I agree, not discounting the info. Just want everyone to know it was from last year not very recent as I remembered when it happened.
@SageAine1 @TheRealHublife @POTUS This is from March, 2017 see attached source	https://t.co/TXgPYgTlUF
@TheRealHublife This makes you think.	https://twitter.c	om/STUinSD/status/1015029629361348608

@EyeTheSpy Why did the Chinese Space Station come down? was it naturally or did someone cause it to come down?
