The only thing crazy about these issues are @Hogan4Governor’s dangerous positions that would take MD #backward.
Did @Hogan4Governor just call a woman’s right to choose and common-sense gun safety laws “Crazy Issues?” Wow.
Whoops! Looks like the @WashPost said that about you too… http://t.co/s5Ht9sOwOo
.@Hogan4Governor - MDers want a leader with ideas and solutions, not someone whose agenda is “incoherent.”
But the @BaltimoreSun says that @Hogan4Governor has “little idea” of what MD is doing to fight heroin abuse. http://t.co/ROAsaUo48o (2/2)
The Heroin epidemic is a serious issue that deserves serious ideas. (1/2)
.@Hogan4Governor - the only person who calls your record bipartisan is you.
Check the facts @Hogan4Governor - you presided over the mass firings of Democrats http://t.co/ahUCxECmmA
Maintaining Maryland’s #1 schools must be a priority - that doesn’t happen if @Hogan4Governor cuts $450 million from school construction.
While @Hogan4Governor calls for cutting $450 million from school construction, Anthony Brown will increase funding to $500 million annually.
FACT: @Hogan4Governor said that he “absolutely” stands by his plan to cut $450 million in school construction funding.http://t.co/P9toP4DbPI
Larry Hogan has opposed investing in transportation infrastructure like the Red Line that creates jobs. That’s #DangerousforMD
The @BaltimoreSun disagrees with you @Hogan4Governor. They called your claim an “egregious falsehood”. http://t.co/UIbZaPbKD3
FACT: Anthony Brown will cap college tuition costs, ensure quality college education remains accessible to all MDers. http://t.co/cf6dk8jP2o
FACT: Larry Hogan appointed 11 of the 15 Board of Regent’s members who raised tuition on middle class families by 40%.
FACT: Larry Hogan attacks MD’s progress, but opposes universal Pre-K and would cut $450 mil. in school construction.
FACT: MD has made more progress than any other state in closing the educational achievement gap: http://t.co/eT9pGjyLUU
