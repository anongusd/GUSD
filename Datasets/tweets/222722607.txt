@RUSI_org @K_E_Brown27 Think about why people join these cults in the first place. It‚Äôs usually answering some psychological need they are unable satisfy through the normal channels in society. At the same time, there‚Äôs the possibility that some escapees are Trojan horses. Can they be deradicalized?
@RUSI_org @K_E_Brown27 If so, she‚Äôs going to need a lifetime of therapy and cult deprogramming. She talked about the beheadings with a casual tone and claims people should have sympathy for her. She seems off. The alternative is to reject the former cult members allowing anger and resentment to fester.

@BeeepBeeeeep @nowthisnews @justicedems @sunrisemvmt @AOC Fighting for abundance instead of promoting scarcity. That‚Äôs the better way.

@dean_dahl @mettaworldwar @ifeelfine72 @HughGifDrew @jljacobson @oyveyistmir_ @ryangrim @AOC We, by we I mean humanity as a whole, have already figured out how aging works.

@ForeverLogical We need our reps and senators to put bills together that ensure these people are essentially comped on all healthcare bills. 		They‚Äôll need access to a network of people who know what they‚Äôre doing and can help them normalize and hopefully ease their integration into our society.
@ForeverLogical These families, especially the youngest kids are likely going to need years if not a lifetime of therapy to help them cope and rebuild their psyches.		The US must take responsibility for all these people, their mental health and overall well-being for the rest of their lives.
@ForeverLogical It‚Äôs gaslighting and it‚Äôs meant to make you doubt your sanity. What we need is to figure out ways of reuniting these families once trump is impeached. It‚Äôs safe to assume the record keeping is nonexistent. So it will require DNA and proactive coordination between institutions.

@RhodyReport @megaholt @yashar Nice strawman.		You could just admit that you know nothing about ADHD or that maybe you were misinformed. 		But instead you felt the need to call the person you insulted narcissistic after they proved you wrong which, ironically, can be a sign of narcissism. Fascinating.
@PhillyPicks215 @efs120 @chasingandy @DoktorZoom @oneunderscore__ Journalism isn‚Äôt dying, it‚Äôs evolving.

Who benefits from attacking freedom of the press? Certainly not We The People.
@PhillyPicks215 @efs120 @chasingandy @DoktorZoom @oneunderscore__ Fighting climate change can be a lucrative industry all by itself.

@PhillyPicks215 @efs120 @chasingandy @DoktorZoom @oneunderscore__ Coal mining is coming to an end. It‚Äôs a dying industry that harms our planet. The people who do those jobs need to transition into different jobs and they need help to do it. Journalism isn‚Äôt a dying industry. We still need it. There‚Äôs no exigent need to transition away from it.
@PhillyPicks215 @efs120 @chasingandy @DoktorZoom @oneunderscore__ So this is about people‚Äôs feelings getting hurt? So now they harbor resentment for the messenger for delivering news of the inevitable? That‚Äôs not ironic, it‚Äôs selfish, vindictive and a waste of time and energy.

@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin It doesn‚Äôt make sense to be offended by a Gillette ad, so I guess that makes things about even.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Read the body language.
@carlosalazraqui @JohnFugelsang All communication is agenda based. You can‚Äôt avoid it. Even if it‚Äôs just annoying small talk in an elevator about the weather, there‚Äôs an agenda to avoid uncomfortable silence. Why are people so afraid of silence? I don‚Äôt know. But there‚Äôs always an agenda.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin If you‚Äôre paying attention, it‚Äôs obvious that she‚Äôs not interested. Why do they need to be stressed?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Thanks for proving my point. 		Crotch grabbing woman in club is looking to socialize. 		Woman walking fast down sidewalk, not looking to socialize.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Body. Language.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin If you thoroughly read the article, you wouldn‚Äôt need to ask that question. 		If you care so much about body language, why are you ignoring the body language of the woman in the ad?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Dude. Her whole body says no. The way she walks. The look on her face. All of that says no, clear as day. Read the cues.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Okay, let‚Äôs try science then		https://t.co/Pz6tV2aGg2
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin You made it personal first. I was just giving you what you gave me and look how uncomfortable you got. Women who put up with being harassed like that feel 1000x times worse. Treat people the way you want to be treated.
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Or he could be a big boy and let a woman walk by without harassing her. You think he‚Äôs the first dude to try that nonsense? How many times a day do you think she has to put up with that?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin You seem to be defending yourself more than the guy in the commercial. You act offended but you don‚Äôt seem to care whether or not you offend the women who have to put up with that crap everyday. Why should anyone care about your ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô if you don‚Äôt care about anyone else‚Äôs?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin And what if she wasn‚Äôt interested and the guy didn‚Äôt take the hint?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin Sometimes a change of perspective helps you see more than you saw before. 		If a guy you‚Äôve never met before grunts and moans at you in a prison shower, how would you feel?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin He was leaning on the wall doing nothing. 		She was on the go, walking fast, dodging people. 		Learn to see the signs man.		What if some random guy on the street guy did that to you? Would you feel disrespected?
@LouisEmerson16 @ResearchRwa @keithboykin What if the woman was your sister, mom or daughter, and some lazy looking schmuck disrespects them the way that guy was disrespecting that woman? How would you feel about it then?

@my2pitbullz @dbongino People living on the border don‚Äôt want a wall. It would cost money to fight them in court to steal their land just so you can put up a hideous looking set of prison bars.

@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal But right now, I‚Äôm sure voting blue is the right thing to do. And I‚Äôve learned to appreciate Democrat policies more. There‚Äôs far more nuance than republicans or right wing media portray. And I don‚Äôt like being lied to. So I‚Äôll be voting blue for the foreseeable future as well.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal I‚Äôve been a republican. Saw the policies weren‚Äôt working. Saw the democrats weren‚Äôt nearly as bad as republicans tried to make them look. My natural instinct to question everything eventually caused me to gravitate to the dems. Now I‚Äôm voting blue. Lots of cognitive dissonance.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Fascinating. I‚Äôm not even sure if Biden is the right guy for the job, he could be but I‚Äôm not sure. I was just curious about how you were making your decision. I think I understand now.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Using his office to enrich himself is an interesting way of looking at it. He wasn‚Äôt in office at the time but I think I get where you‚Äôre coming from.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal I agree and it‚Äôs what contributed to me not voting for her either. Except the whole thing was blown out of proportion by RU disinfo and right wing media.		As a result, irrational distrust of her lingered far longer than it should have.		Now look where we are. Was it worth it?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Sorry but it seems to me like an irrational fear of the unknown. I felt the same about Hillary giving paid speeches but ended up changing my mind when I couldn‚Äôt come up with a logical reason for distrusting it other than my own prejudice against Wall Street.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal But he‚Äôs not beholden to them. They ask him to speak. Both parties agree on a payment. He delivers the product. They‚Äôve gotten what they paid for. That‚Äôs the end of the transaction.		I agree it might open the door to a nefarious relationship, but he doesn‚Äôt owe them anything.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal What‚Äôs so wrong about giving paid speeches? I want to understand why it makes you trust him less.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal So aren‚Äôt you taking a leap of faith in the opposite direction by going against him by dismissing or otherwise devaluing his documented history in public life? Do you have any proof that he did anything wrong?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Do you even know what the speeches were about or who the audiences were?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Just because you can see it, doesn‚Äôt mean you will see it and realize the implications. Maybe he had other things on his mind at the time. What if he was busy grieving the loss of his son at the time and just happened to miss a few things? Should he be condemned for that?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal That sounds like you expect people to walk on eggshells or you‚Äôll assume they‚Äôve done something bad. Why not start by assuming a positive or at least neutral intention? Why assume the worst about people you don‚Äôt really know that much about? Do you know the audiences he spoke to?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Good point. But you‚Äôre not explaining why speaking engagements are inherently wrong. Lots of things can seem sketchy until you know the details. The human mind has a way of filling in the blanks with the worst things we can imagine.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal What if you didn‚Äôt realize that you may need to run again? What if you failed to anticipate the win of someone so bad, that you just had to go back and run again?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal If they paid for that speech, chances are they‚Äôll be listening closer than they would if the speech were free.		So I ask again, why do you assume all paid speaking engagements are wrong? What proof do you have that they‚Äôre all somehow inherently bad?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal If you had a chance to speak to people you don‚Äôt necessarily care for, and they were paying you to give them a private speech, would you use that opportunity to try to change their minds about a few things? Getting paid for that is just icing on the cake. Plus they‚Äôre committing.
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not livable. I‚Äôm asking what‚Äôs wrong with wanting more. Money is a tool that you use to get things done. If you were working with a manual tool and someone offered you a power tool, would you turn it down? Or would you put it to work and amplify your effort?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Anyone? Really? Interesting blanket statement. And you didn‚Äôt answer the important question. Let me refine it a bit. How can you know that all paid speaking engagements are bad, without knowing the context or what goals the speaker or the audience had in mind? Are you sure?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal Why do you get to decide how much is enough? And why so little? Maybe it should at least be 1 million. How can you assume that any speaking engagement is morally wrong without thinking about the context or the goal he has in mind?
@painter_nancy @USMCLiberal What other things would you have a former Senator and Vice President do to make an income?

Nevertheless we embrace our estranged brethren but reject the xenophobic fear and resentment. It simply doesn‚Äôt work. It does more harm than good. Let‚Äôs move beyond it. Any problem can be solved.
@BonBee81 @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets And I grew up watching Dukes of Hazzard. So what? But when you call it a rebel flag and accuse others of having conflicted loyalties- it brings up many questions. For example: What exactly are you rebelling against?
@richardpolitik Home is where the heart is. If your heart is full of hate and fear and greed, then that‚Äôs the home you built for yourself. No one is pushing you out, but you don‚Äôt get to push other people out either.
@richardpolitik @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets That‚Äôs rather dramatic. Your homeland is where you call home. If that‚Äôs here in America, then I‚Äôm glad to have you here. But pushing other people out will not be tolerated. History does not dictate our identity. Identity is an abstract idea at best. You are who you choose to be.

@AlreadyTheRobot @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Thank you. Sometimes I have trouble putting it into the right words.
@richardpolitik @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets It‚Äôa a safe bet anywhere you go you‚Äôll run into the same problem. 		When a man dates several different women and keeps getting the same result, we know he‚Äôs the problem because he‚Äôs the common denominator. Simple logic. Tough to accept. But simple to understand. Why fight it?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Now who‚Äôs engaging in political rhetoric?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You can lobby for any number of creative things but you choose to lobby for taking something away from people or preventing them from accessing it.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets In the past few years AI has created art and music. Think about that. A painting was sold that was created by an AI. Your job will evaporate. Eventually even money itself will become meaningless. Most people would be glad to have UBI during that very painful transitional period.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Controlling wealth means lobbying congress and the public to keep the laws in your favor. To make it easier to cheat the system while also making it harder for people to get started. By denying people welfare you are also engaging in control of wealth. Just not at the same scale.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets We can afford it if we stop being so wasteful and greedy.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets ... eventually all jobs will evaporate because intelligent machines will do it all. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before universal basic income is a necessity 90% of the people on this planet need because there‚Äôs no job there‚Äôs no other way to generate income. It‚Äôs inevitable.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets The one about welfare. If they need it for a while so what? We can afford it. There‚Äôs more than enough. The reason why it feels like there isn‚Äôt enough is because of who controls most of the wealth in this country. Besides...
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets No you‚Äôre using logical fallacies. Open border doesn‚Äôt mean no border. Open border doesn‚Äôt mean unsecured border. It means we welcome everyone with open arms and treat them the way we‚Äôd want to be treated if the roles were reversed.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets By blaming others for our problems we give them power over us. By owning the problem, even if it isn‚Äôt our fault gives us the power to decide how it works out. Are you sure you want to give all that power away?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets The same could be said about your argument.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You‚Äôre deflecting.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets It can be if we make it easier to come in legally. The infrastructure for that creates jobs. It‚Äôs a win win.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Actually, it‚Äôs mostly corporate tycoons using America as an ATM.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Well I already tried the conservative bias but it just wasn‚Äôt cutting it. You need 21st century ideas if you want to not only survive, but thrive in the 21st century. Besides, what‚Äôs more conservative than conserving a habitable environment? Think about it.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets They come here. Feel safe. Settle down. Figure out what value they can bring to society. Then they grow like happy trees into productive tax paying citizens. Soon we have a forest of productive trees all doing their part. The lifeblood of any economy is people.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Common sense has to actually be common... it‚Äôs not if something else is more common. Roughly 70% of the country disagrees with your stance and prefers one of two or three others. Their view is what qualifies as common sense.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Making legal immigration easier is an investment. Don‚Äôt worry, I found me.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Creating and stockpiling criminals is a sure way to bankrupt a country. It‚Äôs a moral disaster. Destroys families and lives. And for what? So a few greedy people at the top can keep lying about how they got so rich? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to invest in people and rehabilitate them?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets So you just want to see people punished and thrown away like trash?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Think of it as an investment in ourselves and the future of this planet because that‚Äôs what it is.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets We need more ports of entry and more people and more technology to process migrants and refugees. If there‚Äôs a part of the border that has a lot of illegal crossings, maybe that‚Äôs a sign we need a port of entry there too. More open registers eases the flow and creates jobs.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You ever been to Walmart or something when it‚Äôs really crowded and wish they had more registers open? What happens around the holidays when they don‚Äôt have enough registers open? How much more chaotic does it get? The problem is at our end.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets How exactly?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You seem to think that giving to others means less for yourself. While that sounds greedy, I‚Äôm not going to go there because I‚Äôd rather help you look at it from another point of view. Listen to this:		https://t.co/47lZETFHLR
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Government is an agreement. We agreed to it. Without force behind it, over 90% of people would be prey. As it is now, 1% control the money and we‚Äôre fighting that. If there were no government, there‚Äôs no currency. And brutal savagery as the primary recourse for grievances.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You assume that all people need is encouragement. Maybe that works for you. But that‚Äôs not the reality for everyone. Some people need something different in order to bring thier best. Those are the people you‚Äôre condemning.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Dude, if we had no government you would be prey to any human more willing to go just a little bit further and be just a little bit more savage. That‚Äôs dependency. No matter how good we are, there‚Äôs always someone better. And there‚Äôs always going to be someone who‚Äôs more ruthless.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Seems rather selfish and quite a bit ignorant of what reality is for some people. Try walking a mile in the shoes of those you would condemn.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Pride goes before a fall. Let it go man. We need each other whether you like it or not, so get used to it. Survival of the fittest also mean cooperation. Groups working together to a common goal. Right now, we can all unify behind climate change because it‚Äôs the biggest threat.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets So stop saying dependent on the government as if it‚Äôs a bad thing. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a system we‚Äôve agreed to. We also agreed it can and should be updated to accommodate the needs of future generations. That‚Äôs what keeps humans civilized. Without that, 90% of humans are prey to 10%.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Everyone is dependant on the government, even you. You just don‚Äôt realize it. You speak of laws. Who enforces them? How long would most Americans survive if there was no government, no court system, to enforce those laws we‚Äôve mostly agreed to? What if anyone could do anything?
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Gee do you think that how the Indians felt when white people started showing up? 		We use borders to define locations in space, not necessarily to prevent people from moving. The fact of the matter is America is built on migration. Without immigrants, America will wither and die.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets What you‚Äôre suggesting is inhumane.	Why not let them migrate and set up a proper system to better accommodate their needs? That‚Äôs an investment in America‚Äôs future. More people, from more diverse backgrounds means bigger and more diverse and stronger economy.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Your problem is you see it though a partisan lens rather than seeing human beings as human beings. Once again you apply identify labels so you can pigeonhole people into convenient little boxes. And you accuse me of engaging in identity politics. That‚Äôs called projection.
@FinanceBuzz @JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets And what if I told you most illegals currently in country are visa overstays that came in by plane? Is your wall going to stop a plane?
@JuanDeplorable @proud2bLib @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Key word being *history*. What about now? That photo happened this century. Let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs happening in this century, with the generations of people who are alive today.
@JuanDeplorable @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You seem defensive. It‚Äôs a perfectly natural reaction.
@JuanDeplorable @FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets The process is to cross the border wherever it‚Äôs safe, and turn themselves in to border patrol. That‚Äôs how it works. That‚Äôs what they do.
@JuanDeplorable @Jersey327 @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You can call them a refugee the moment they‚Äôre forced to flee their homes. If the situation were reversed, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd want to be seen that way. 		I think it‚Äôs interesting how you accuse me of being obsesssed with identity as you sit there deciding who gets tagged as what.

@FinanceBuzz @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets I think of America as an amalgamation and augmentation of the ideals of many countries. We adopt the best ideas and expand them as far as they will go while discarding what we know doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs not a perfect system but we have advanced science quite a bit in a short time.
@kasthur66 @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets Not exactly. We‚Äôre friends with the Irish. They‚Äôre our allies. But what‚Äôs the current relationship between nazis and the United States? Or the confederacy and the United States? We fought wars against them and the ideas they represent. We declared the ideology wrong and immoral.
@Jersey327 @PaulBlu @joncoopertweets You can be a refugee and still love the country you were forced to leave. The problem is the confederate and nazi flags represent ideas the United States went to war against. Waving those flags is more like an invasion. And it‚Äôs a perfect example of conflicted loyalties.
@techreview @martingiles I always thought the entanglement was broken once the photon was disturbed or measured. I assumed that included when it gets absorbed by an electron. But if old entanglements can be recreated... that... changes everything. Great. I‚Äôm not gonna be able to stop thinking about this.
@techreview @martingiles Wait, QED tells us photons don‚Äôt actually bounce, but are absorbed and recreated by the electrons that absorbed them. Are you telling me entanglement is recreated as well? If it‚Äôs maintained throughout, what does the other photon do while its twin is ‚Äòinside‚Äô some electron?
@PaulBlu @joncoopertweets When bigots talk about migrants ‚Äòinvading‚Äô and having ‚Äòdual loyalties‚Äô because they carry the flag from the home they‚Äôve been forced to leave, they‚Äôre really describing themselves and their own conflicting loyalties.

@lady_entp Intp having stronger Ti and Si would probably be constantly reminding entp of how things went the last time they did that thing that time and offer strategies. Entp having stronger Ne and Fe would probably be pushing intp to take more risks and have more fun engaging with people.

@thegreatkhalid If you can throw yourself into the part as deeply as some really good method actors do, maybe this alternate version of you doesn‚Äôt even have social anxiety. Think of it like a form of hypnosis. It‚Äôs a long shot but for the freedom to just go out and be relaxed, it‚Äôs worth a try.
@thegreatkhalid I think the best costumes have *some* truth to them. So imagine the person you would be had you chosen a different life and become that person when you need a break. Social anxiety is tough so hopefully by being preoccupied with the disguise, you won‚Äôt notice it as much.
@thegreatkhalid To go the extra distance, maybe wear glasses and change your eye color along with some fake tattoos, temporary hair coloring, and possibly some hair extensions. And wear clothes Khalid would never wear. Superman looks taller and more built than Clark Kent because of his posture.
@thegreatkhalid Perhaps some type of disguise? If you can change your appearance, body language and vocal tones just enough so that if someone does recognize you, you can play it off and be like, yeah I get that a lot. Tell them you do impressions or act like you can‚Äôt sing so you can‚Äôt be him.

@AmpSyndicated @Newsweek @UMassAmherst Is sadness the only driving force in people‚Äôs lives? Is that what motivates people to achieve whatever the hell they want to accomplish? It might be part of it. But emotions are more nuanced than that. There‚Äôs far more dimensionality and complexity to what drives people.
@AmpSyndicated @Newsweek @UMassAmherst Well I am a psychopath. You got that part right. I think. Maybe. Perhaps. Ahh it‚Äôs besides the point. But I didn‚Äôt call you sad, I said lonely. You said sad, which is very telling. 		Do you feel sad?
@AmpSyndicated @Newsweek @UMassAmherst This tells me you feel isolated, which is natural for someone who subscribes to an ideology that deliberately isolates itself. You are not alone. But emulating or defending nazis cannot be tolerated. So I ask you, who do you choose to be? What type of future do you want?
@AmpSyndicated @Newsweek @UMassAmherst Actually, it was more than ‚Äòjust one tweet‚Äô. First you started by defending nazis while attempting to muddy the waters. Then, with a cursory glance at your feed, I find these lovely gems:		(interesting location BTW üòâ) https://t.co/6Dg1k15KRT

@PCtheNPC @Newsweek @UMassAmherst Why are you defending nazis? Is this really what you want to be doing with your life? Where will you be 10-15 years from now if you keep doing the same things you‚Äôre doing today? Be honest- Is that where you want to be? Is that who you really are?

@Tom_Winter He has a one dimensional view of reality.
@trot_emelia There‚Äôs no single solution to halting and reversing climate change. But if we put serious collective effort into a series of smaller but still scalable and interconnected solutions, I believe we can make a lasting significant systemic change for the better, in record time.
@trot_emelia Thing is, we can‚Äôt just take it away from people. They‚Äôll freak out. So instead you‚Äôre offering them better meat. Homegrown. Just like Elon Musk is offering them a better truck that makes them want to go electric. They have to want it. And I think it‚Äôs possible to make it happen.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss We could literally grow the meat. The off grid folks can grow their own meat. Less fresh water is needed and less pollution is created to feed everyone. Farmers and workaholics have a significant purpose to add meaning and seasoning to their lives. Everybody wins.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss A significant amount of greenhouse gas can be reduced by going vegetarian. Something like ~15% of greenhouse gasses are produced by agriculture. Namely cows. But I know people won‚Äôt go for it. They love meat. So why not clone the meat instead of raising and killing so many cows?
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss Probably not Colorado, I think I‚Äôm just thinking of places with mountains. But maybe. Either way, it would be catastrophic for the entire country. Either through direct or secondary impact.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss The rural folks might think well, it‚Äôs just the coasts, doesn‚Äôt affect middle America. Except it does. Where are all the costal refugees going to go? Likely wherever the new coastline is. Places like Montana, Colorado or anywhere that is guaranteed to be above the new sea level.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss But before we can get there, we need to survive long enough. So I focus on carbon first because that‚Äôs the most direct link to pollution and sea level rising. We need to breathe and it would be nice if we can save the coasts and not have to abandon them for higher ground.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss Perhaps. We need to get to that nanorobotic stage where we can recycle every last molecule. The goal should be to empty all the landfills, superfund sites, toxic waste sites and recycle all of it. A complete cycle with no waste. Solar panels, wind and water turbines everywhere.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss Now that I got all the doom and gloom out of the way, here‚Äôs some hope for the future and a way to step back and see the bigger picture of where we are and where we‚Äôre going:		https://t.co/TO0EB8iPj3
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss We also need to reduce the amount of CO2 we produce. If we do both, reduce production of CO2 and increase consumption of CO2, we just might be able to create a new equilibrium for the climate that allows us to maintain all our creature comforts. If we don‚Äôt, we lose everything.
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss Basic idea is this: Life on Earth is a series of chemical reactions. The chemical balance is altered by industry. We have industrial lungs, engines, furnaces etc. consuming O2 and producing CO2 faster than trees can process it back into O2. We need industrial trees for balance.
@RichardHaass @ProudResister Same game over and over again. With climate change and a host of other problems breathing down our necks, we simply can‚Äôt afford to play this game anymore. It‚Äôs time to make them play our game. Healthcare. Education. Training. Replace rural coal economy with rural green economy. https://t.co/Fvzf971MBC
@trot_emelia @StevenBeschloss There‚Äôs time. But it will take massive collective effort. To help focus everyone‚Äôs attention, Congress could work some legislative magic that turns carbon into a commodity to be captured, traded, sold and recycled into useful products and textiles. Capture &amp; trade. Air scrubbing.

@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Making a plan and actually carrying out are different things. Do you have any real evidence?
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not very scientific. A scientist has to be able to look at data objectively and not emotionally. What hard evidence do you have that there are lies? Give real examples. Show me real evidence.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump So much negativity and hatred. Tests don‚Äôt fail simply because you don‚Äôt agree with them.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS They are the same because people fall for them based on circumstantial evidence. It‚Äôs not content so much as the mental and psychological processes used to determine what you believe as true. And what you choose not to believe.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump Oh now we‚Äôre blaming Soros. I see. Well, you definitely need to take this test then: https://t.co/JTNXBpq6a5

@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump I know I‚Äôm nuts. It‚Äôs pleasingly obvious to me. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm wrong. See, I‚Äôm willing to criticize myself. Are you willing to criticize yourself? When was the last time you admitted you were wrong about about something?
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump If you‚Äôre not angry, why are you yelling?
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs what cult members usually say.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump üòÇüòÇ Figures you‚Äôd be a narcissist too. I mean after all, it‚Äôs a cult of narcissism.		Eventually you‚Äôll wake up and look in the mirror and realize how much time you wasted alienating friends and family to support a tyrant or perhaps you‚Äôll just keep being angry and projecting it.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump Apparently, I have a propensity for escaping them too. Do you?
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs a difference you know, between psychotic and psychopath. Look up the signs of psychopathy. Do your own research and see for yourself.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump No, he kicked the can further down the road and in 90 days or whatever the time they decided is up, he‚Äôll either take the deal he already rejected, (probably rehashed like NAFTA 2.0) or he‚Äôll kick the can again. Such is the way with narcissists who claim to be lone saviors.
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump Aww... you‚Äôre concerned about me. How touching. I‚Äôm concerned about you too. Do you know what it‚Äôs like to be in a cult? Because you‚Äôre in one. I can tell because I used to be in one too. And I used to act exactly the way you‚Äôre acting now. Ever heard of psychological projection? https://t.co/dkHqqsXpYx
@CleopatraOwen17 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre just saying that because you see the resemblance and it bothers you. You assume I‚Äôm doing it as an insult when in reality I‚Äôm just sharing useful information. Stop being so negative.

@FCHSBandAlumni @mad_hines @charliekirk11 Einstein could have easily helped Germany create the atomic bomb. Then where would we be? Imagine if the nazis got the a-bomb before we did.

@NetDenizeNet @snarkytoes I think it‚Äôs obvious by now that there are people with money and resources who seem to prefer spending that money and resources on denying and muddying up the waters of climate science rather than addressing the issues. The question is who would do such a thing and why?
@NetDenizeNet @snarkytoes Lol. You asked a (rhetorical?) question. I gave you an answer. A bit cryptic but still an answer. Then you made it about me for some reason. I agreed because I‚Äôm a bit narcissistic, but then I elaborated slightly on my original point.
@BulletinAtomic We need to plan for worst case scenarios such as what happens if they decide to cut down every tree. I doubt they would but we can‚Äôt get caught w/ our leaves down on this one. What if some accident or miscalculation in resource mining causes massive deforestation/desertification?
@Julianneinmoab @marilynboner @BenMcAdams @NancyPelosi Because it‚Äôs a pivotal moment and the people trying to mess things up are afraid of her. If they weren‚Äôt, they wouldn‚Äôt have spent so much money and effort attacking her over the years. Pelosi is effective. Anyone interested in the job should be trying to learn from her.
@NetDenizeNet @snarkytoes Well considering I spent years swimming through their propaganda... it‚Äôs only logical. Wrong. But logical. Learned helplessness is one thing. Can‚Äôt blame the victims for believing lies. But instilling helplessness through acts of institutional subversion? That‚Äôs much, much worse.
@NetDenizeNet @snarkytoes Good question. I think the answer is multifaceted. A convergence of paths taken by people with various but not dissimilar interests and goals. Some may even think they‚Äôre doing the right thing because of a narrow-minded, myopic and ultimately flawed belief system.

@joseph_sadik @Well_Regulated_ @john_sipher @NRA Perhaps that can be worked into our criminal justice system.

The logical extension there is complex electron orbitals can be seen as paired up antennae. Dipole vs monopole etc. 		My mind is strange.. https://t.co/yVSHFzYcdt
@Pinche_Pi @Sugar__Lumps @Just_SomeChick @elechner1 @SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump The speed of light is always the same. But not for the reasons you might think. 		When it slows down in glass for example, it‚Äôs because photons are being absorbed and recreated and absorbed and recreated by electrons until it reaches a surface boundary.		https://t.co/Bs1LqrXaYO
