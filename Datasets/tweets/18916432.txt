Today, we bid farewell to @JohnDingell, a patriot who embodied ‘service before self.’ Every member of the Congress should try to emulate the vim and vigor that John brought to the House daily. John’s impact was profound and he will be missed by many.
RT @HenryLouisGates: On tomorrow night’s episode of #FindingYourRoots, we share stories about the ancestors of @TulsiGabbard, @SpeakerRyan…
Congressman Walter Jones was a true gentleman, a man of deep faith, and a man of principle, who selflessly served the people of North Carolina’s 3rd District. I was proud to work with him in the House of Representatives and my heart goes out to his wife and family.

Proud to sign Criminal Justice Reform legislation and send it the president to become law. Redemption is at the heart of the American Idea. These reforms will make our communities safer &amp; create a smoother path for the incarcerated to successfully reenter &amp; contribute to society. https://t.co/XpwbXxnNZO
The House is indebted to Secretary Mattis for his service. With our country’s defense in his hands, we have become a safer America at home, and a more commanding force abroad. His patriotism and grit are matched only by his humility and graciousness. https://t.co/5vgtUgYvhM
The House just passed criminal justice reform. This is something I have believed in for a long time. There is no reason a person who wants to redeem themselves, work hard, and contribute to their community should be deprived of that opportunity. https://t.co/zbMQnHpeOc

Becoming Speaker was bittersweet because I was leaving the job I always wanted: being in charge of tax policy as chairman of @WaysAndMeansGOP. So as Speaker, I did everything I could to pave the way for real, comprehensive tax reform. https://t.co/WYAMMb35RN
There is no way that that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be the law of the land if we had just started last year. It took years of work in the @WaysandMeansGOP committee, and that’s the reason we were able to hit the landing in 2017. https://t.co/sewdrCufWG
It was 2007. House Republicans had just lost the majority, and I was sitting in a deer hunting tree stand one Saturday morning. That’s when I decided to go big and put together a completely comprehensive plan to update the nation’s entitlement system and reform the tax code. https://t.co/NNafZREowl

7 million. That’s how many job openings there are across the country—more jobs than people seeking them. That forces companies to pay higher wages and benefits to attract workers.

Unfortunately, Washington Democrats are holding funds to rebuild our military hostage over an unrelated issue. This political strategy is irresponsible and downright dangerous.
To ensure our military has the tools needed to complete their missions, and is able to stay one step ahead of the rest of the world, we need to fully fund the @DeptOfDefense.

Continuing resolutions are not ideal to fund our government. The only roadblock to a long-term government funding bill are the Senate Democrats’ filibuster threats.
That’s what was so baffling about Washington Democrats lambasting the use of continuing resolutions following the #SchumerShutdown.
For a jog down memory lane, here are the spending bills stuck in the Senate:	- July 27: defense package for national security priorities	- Sept. 14: all 12 appropriations bills	- Dec. 21: disaster relief funding	- Jan. 18: funding for our troops &amp; children’s health insurance
The thing about regular order is, the Senate has to do its job. (Read: To pass a long-term funding bill, Senate Democrats can’t filibuster every spending bill the House sends its way).
Let’s make one thing clear: Republicans don’t want to use continuing resolutions to fund the government. That’s why the House made it a priority for spending bills to go through regular order. https://t.co/GZSNf2OHvR

Day 1 of the #SchumerShutdown is almost over. Senate Democrats once again blocked a non-controversial bill that would fund the government, America’s military, and health insurance for 9 million children.
Senator Schumer said in 2013: "I believe in immigration reform. What if I persuaded my caucus to say, 'I'm going to shut the government down...unless I get my way?' It's a politics of idiocy, of confrontation, of paralysis."	 	"Politics of idiocy." His words, not mine. https://t.co/aF2ZWePuYj
Senate Democrats shut down the government over a bill they have no issues with—a bill that keeps government open and extends health insurance to nearly 9 million children. They opposed a bill they don't even oppose. We do some crazy things in Washington, but this is madness. https://t.co/SW4YPzKTfc

One party in one house of this Congress is deliberately holding our entire government hostage. This did not need to happen. But it is important for people to understand why it did. https://t.co/4F6cGZLHKX
The federal government is needlessly shut down this morning because of Senate Democrats. They need to stop this reckless game and vote for the bill to keep government open, pay our troops, and fund children’s health care.

Senate Democrats are charging into governmental chaos. They should abandon this reckless shutdown strategy and join the House in keeping the government open and our troops funded.

The American people, especially our men and women in uniform, deserve better than a government shutdown. Senate Democrats, do not block this funding bill. Keep the government open.
The House has done its part to keep the government open and now Senate Democrats will have their choice. There will be a vote. Will they block government funding and children’s health care?
In 2013, Senator Schumer said this very tactic represents “governmental chaos.” And yet now he’s actively orchestrating a shutdown. #SchumerShutdown
Do they actually oppose children’s health insurance? I don’t think so. Do they have a problem with the funding resolution? No. This is about extorting unrelated policy through a government shutdown.
They are threatening to shut down the government altogether over completely unrelated issues. They are treating our men and women in uniform like bargaining chips.
Senate Democrats are very clear. → They want a government shutdown as leverage. They are taking funding for the government and funding for our troops hostage. This is their strategy. They are open about that.
Last night the House voted to keep the government open and reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Today, Senate Democrats are threatening to block that bill and force a government shutdown.
Senator Schumer, do not shut down the federal government.				Do not jeopardize funding for our military and for our national security.				Do not jeopardize funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.				It is risky. It is reckless. And it is wrong. https://t.co/1NLeGDY20i

Job creators need the certainty of permanent rate cuts in order to make long-term investments into their businesses. https://t.co/8XlwrwQhaV
