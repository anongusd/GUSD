@RVAdirt I would go with my trusty ‚ÄúLegalize Gay Marijuana‚Äù shirt.
@emilyt804 @RVAdirt The Libertarian Party has supported those issues since its inception 45 years ago? Gay marriage too! Our first Presidential ticket was an LGBT+ man and Jewish woman. We have a Sex Work plank in our platform.
@AP4Liberty With the way Republicans have no regard for the cost of what they legislate, that sounds about right.
@mdotbrown You need three things in the playoffs. Effective ball movement every possession, control the boards, and win turnovers. That‚Äôs efficient basketball that preserves possessions when the possessions matter the most. Having a clutch scorer when ball movement stalls creates champions.
@mdotbrown The difference in the game with no hand checking creates two different eras of basketball. It‚Äôs what allows Harden to get leverage and space in his stepback. I‚Äôd be bodying Westbrook with early pressure and lead him into contact in the paint for 48.
@mdotbrown Giannis plays defense at a level that Harden couldn‚Äôt dream of. Guys like Iverson were elite playing the passing lanes, but were sieves elsewhere. Every entry pass and jump shot was easy. That‚Äôs difficulty in gauging stat heavy categories with ball dominant, heavy usage guards.
