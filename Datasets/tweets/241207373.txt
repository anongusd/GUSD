Will return home after votes today, but continue to keep eye on #HurricaneFlorence. #SouthJersey residents know all too well damage &amp; destruction massive storms can bring - encourage those in harms way to listen &amp; follow instructions of emergency officials.
NJ voters who continue to send same tax&amp;spend lawmakers to Trenton enable policies that make NJ one of most expensive to live in w/ highest property taxes.  I support less taxes on hard-working #SouthJersey residents (which I am one) - my focus as a federal legislator. Frank https://t.co/D3iukDOJ5f
House to give final approval of first 3 annual appropriations today w/ critical $$ for VA care &amp; military construction projects, sending bill to President. Expect strong bipartisan support after Senate 92-5 vote last night - I will vote YES.
Agreed with you that Trenton/state lawmakers haven't found tax it doesn't want to levy on #SouthJersey residents. Exact reason I continue to OPPOSE additional tax penalties on federal level, such as making $10k SALT cap permanent &amp; proposed gas tax increase. Frank https://t.co/gjL9KFvmZm

Strong bipartisan vote to approve FY19 National Defense Authorization Act. Sets military policy for next year &amp; includes largest pay increase for our troops in nearly a decade. Senate will act next on conference report, sending to President Trump to sign into law.

It's accurate that New Jersey got screwed in federal tax bill, hence my NO vote. Many benefits for residents of other states, but not win for many #SouthJersey families.

Joining @987TheCoast at 8am to talk local Cape May County &amp; national issues. Tune in #SouthJersey
I am disappointed House is unable to come together for a bipartisan solution to the ongoing failures in our immigration system.
It authorizes &amp; appropriates billions in federal $$ for border security enhancements including physical structures, deployment of technology, &amp; additional personnel.  It reforms &amp; eliminates multiple visa programs which have been increasingly abused.
Today‚Äôs bill codifies into law that parents &amp; children detained at U.S.-Mexico border not be separated. It provides certainty for DACA recipients, who came here through no fault of their own, so that they can continue to live &amp; work in our great country that many have only known.
I voted YES on Border Security &amp; Immigration Reform because to vote no = reaffirm status quo of nation‚Äôs immigration laws which are not working by any metric/observation. Bill is not perfect nor everything I would choose it to be; compromises are necessary to advance good policy.
Thx for calling in #SouthJersey. Appreciate questions on North Korea, Middle East peace, National Security team &amp; upcoming elections. Hour always seems to fly by. 		Will be joining @987TheCoast at 8am tomorrow to talk Cape May County issues.

My staff &amp; I will spend weekend going through details of bills slated for a vote, I welcome thoughtful, respectful comments from #SouthJersey residents on immigration proposals on my Facebook page https://t.co/HovDSMJKpb. Headed home now. Frank

House is tentatively slated to vote on number of immigration reform proposals next week, which addresses high priority issues including DACA recipients, current asylum rules, border security including $$ for physical barriers &amp; existing visa programs.

The United States, working with our international partners including Israel, must remain committed to ensuring Iran has not and will not acquire nuclear weapons.

Until latest proposal is dead &amp; sunk, will not let up! #SouthJersey has repeatedly made clear - Dem AND GOP Administrations - drilling off our shores = not wanted nor practical. Applaud unwavering efforts of biz @VisitCapeMay @AcChamber, enviros @CleanOcean &amp; concerned citizens.

While I clearly disagreed w/ some policies due to neg impact in my district, I stand willing to work w/ admin to improve #SouthJersey residents' lives, including fair trade, reduce Rx drug cost, provide for our veterans, support law enforcement &amp; strengthen national security.
From rebuilding our military &amp; crumbling infrastructure to immigration, President Trump continues to tackle head on some of nation‚Äôs most pressing issues; Congress should follow his lead.

I remained in Washington throughout weekend &amp; will remain until government opens. My offices are open but appreciate patience as more than half my staff is furloughed w/o pay along w/ thousands of #SouthJersey employees &amp; contractors at FAA Tech Center &amp; other federal facilities
While 535 members each have own legislative priorities &amp; would want additional non-related items included, simply no justification for voting against proposal. Latest &amp; completely avoidable example of Congress‚Äô inability to work together &amp; accept good &gt; pursuing perfect. Frank
I have always argued shutting down government is NEVER a good option. Failing to pass a bill that keeps government open &amp; authorizes Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for 6 years ‚Äì a bill w/ broad support from Democrats &amp; Republicans ‚Äì is irresponsible &amp; frankly insane.
Senate‚Äôs inexcusable inaction delays services to our veterans &amp; seniors, leaves in limbo thousands of #SouthJersey federal employees/contractors &amp; their families, and threatens planning for critical national security ops while leaving brave men/women of military serving w/o pay.

While improvements made to retain deductions for medical &amp; educational expenses, the $10k collective cap on state/ local income tax &amp; property tax deductions will be detrimental in my high-tax state of New Jersey. I will be voting NO as it is in best interest of #SouthJersey.
When #taxreform debate began, I made clear what I could &amp; could not support in a final bill. Hard-working #SouthJersey residents already face excessive taxes from Trenton, thus preserving key deductions at federal level would be critical to garner my support.

Headed home to #SouthJersey. Looking forward to speaking w/ innovative high school/college students @Stockton_edu #StockHack event &amp; change of command @177thFW ceremony.
Hard-working residents already face excessive taxes from Trenton, cannot compound burden by eliminating state/local income tax, capping property tax deductions &amp; removing those for med/ed expenses. While support reforming/simplifying tax code, NO vote = best for #SouthJersey
When #TaxReform legislation introduced, said my support was dependent on preserving key deductions critical to taxpayers in my high-tax state of New Jersey. Regrettably this bill did not meet that standard.
By responding on social media &amp; staff confirming my NO vote to #SouthJersey callers to set record straight. Plenty of #FakeNews peddled by special interest groups, applaud those who question. Appreciate your tweet. Frank https://t.co/gy1DKcpc8k

Critical that FBI investigation into Russia along w/ ongoing bipartisan House &amp; Senate investigations remain of highest priority for nation.
Next FBI director must be independent voice for bureau, specifically for its continued investigation into Russia involvement w/ our election
Timing/manner by which FBI Dir Comey was fired are deeply troublesome &amp; believe White House must be more forthcoming in explaining decision
Bipartisan Congressional investigations will continue. Actively seeking additional info on President's decision before commenting further.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on finding the right compromise that is also the right policy for #SouthJersey and the country.

Cannot craft healthcare policy w/o input of our constituents, medical pros &amp; orgs like @AARP who speak for most impacted by proposed change
#Obamacare has failed on key metrics &amp; I remain committed to repeal. But we cannot rush replacement w/o regard for real life implications
I planned to vote NO today on this specific #Obamacare replacement bill, but it is not a declaration Obamacare should stay. It shouldn‚Äôt.
Headed to meeting of full House Republican Conference in Capitol. Always willing to listen but I remain NO on this AHCA bill. Frank

Regrettably, current healthcare proposal falls far short &amp; is not better for #SouthJersey. I will be voting no on American Health Care Act.
Prior votes to repeal #Obamacare underscore what I have long argued - we need better healthcare system that is more affordable &amp; accessible.
Congress deals with a lot of issues, but nothing is as deeply personal to every American as healthcare.
Also heard concerns how proposed changes affect coverage for children, providing care for elderly parents, or cancer &amp; diabetes treatments.
Not a day goes by that I do not hear about #Obamacare‚Äôs devastating impact on individuals and small businesses in #SouthJersey.
Clear #Obamacare failing = collapse of public exchanges to double/triple-digit premium increases, affordability promised never materialized
