My office will be open from 9 am - 6 pm EST. https://t.co/wBKOSD99U9
For now, I will remain in Washington, DC and continue working with my colleagues for the 3rd District until we fund and open the government.
We in the House voted to keep the people’s government open.  The Senate’s inability to fund the government and keep it open is bad governance.

I urge my colleagues to set aside any political games or partisan brinkmanship and come together and fully fund CHIP. The health of our children is at stake.
Families should not be worried about losing coverage for their children. 	And the fact this Congress cannot muster the ability to pass a long-term extension to CHIP funding is confounding to say the least.
Around 85,000 Iowa children rely on CHIP for their health. If we don’t act families and children will suffer. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, and we must pass a solution together.
I will be talking about the critical need to fund CHIP in about 15 minutes from the House Floor. Families should not be worried about losing coverage for their children. #ia03

The bill doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, increases the Child Tax Credit and preserves provisions Iowans rely on like the medical expense deduction. Students and parents will still deduct tuition and student loan interest.
I voted to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because Iowans need tax relief and this bill provides relief to hardworking Iowans across the Third District. My focus has always been on middle and low income Iowans.
The bill is passed! I voted to give hardworking Iowa taxpayers the relief they deserve. Soon Iowans will see more money in their paychecks #ia03
Read the full analysis here: https://t.co/jDOATwALws
The analysis also found households making more than $1 million annually would see their share of the overall tax burden increase each year.
A new Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found households earning less than $200,000 annually would receive a majority of the benefits of the tax plan. Which means much needed relief for middle and low income Iowans.

"They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them." - 1 John 2:9-11
"But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness."
"Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble."
"Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness."
Political discourse is something we can pride ourselves on in America - but hate is disgusting and must be condemned to the core.
I wanted to acknowledge and condemn the hate and pain we have seen this weekend at home.
From a land that has seen the pain and deep divisions hatred has caused throughout history
It is just after 2:00 am here in Israel where I am wrapping up my travels and meetings and will begin my journey home to Iowa tomorrow.

Financial CHOICE Act protects consumers &amp; lifts the heavy hand of Washington out of Iowa Main Street so our communities can continue to grow
Financial CHOICE Act protects consumers in #IA03 from deception &amp; fraud and ENDS taxpayer bailouts of big banks. https://t.co/bw2RbdI6Cc
House passed Financial CHOICE Act cultivates Main Street economic growth by removing roadblocks to access to capital from local institutions
House passed Financial CHOICE Act - alleviates the crushing burdens placed on our rural communities by Dodd-Frank https://t.co/bw2RbdI6Cc
Our local and smaller institutions didn't cause the financial collapse of 2008. But Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all approach punishes them.
Dodd-Frank makes local banks in towns like Glenwood &amp; Creston follow same regs and rules as those applied to JPMorgan Chase in New York.
Dodd-Frank forced Main Street to live under the same crushing regulations of Wall Street - gave folks fewer choices &amp; lacked accountability
Dodd-Frank made big banks bigger limited Iowans’ access to capital, raised bank  fees, made mortgages more expensive https://t.co/bw2RbdI6Cc
Dodd-Frank dumped mountains of costly rules &amp; regulations on  hardworking Iowans forcing thousands of hometown banks to close their doors.
Dodd-Frank Act was written with the intention of protecting consumers but created nightmares for community banks &amp; local credit unions.
#IA03 small businesses have our interests in mind &amp; we must keep them in mind when passing laws &amp; issuing regs https://t.co/bw2RbdI6Cc https://t.co/uZnfVFSXoI

@MurphysicalLaw One missing or abducted child is one too many. This is good common sense policy to protect all kids.
H.R. 1808 Also better protects growing number of kids who go missing from state care or are victims of sex trafficking.
