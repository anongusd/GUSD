@ColinONeil @ewg @KathyCastorFL Glad to see people are recognizing that farm practices are linked to #HAB algal outbreaks! Programs like #EQIP in #FarmBill18 are important, but this is ultimately going to require us to buckle down and tackle runoff pollution from factory farms.
#WRDA just passed the Senate 99-1. On to the president.
#WRDA would also aid in detecting unregulated toxic contaminants in drinking water such as #PFAS. The bill would result in more testing by requiring smaller systems to test too‚Äîlowering the threshold from systems serving 10,000 people or more to systems serving 3,300 people.
#WRDA would also authorize a $225 million sewer overflow grant program, with a 20% carve out for green infrastructure. That's particularly helpful for some communities, particularly those that can't afford interest rates on #DWSRF loans.
Senate votes today on water infrastructure bill (#WRDA) to double #DWSRF authorization‚Äîup to $1.9 billion by FY 2021. Much needed to replace lead pipes.

Thanks to @SenGaryPeters for calling this important hearing today on #PFAS drinking water contamination. We‚Äôre all thankful that this issue is being taken seriously. #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/4tOE7cX2AB
@SenatorShaheen: ‚ÄúWhy, 10 years after issuing a non binding alert level for #PFAS, do we still not have a binding health protective standard?‚Äù	@EPA essentially said it‚Äôs up to @EPAAWheeler to decide whether it‚Äôs necessary.	Spoilers: It is!!!
@SenatorCarper: ‚ÄúI believe there is enough science to make a determination on #PFAS. Do you?‚Äù	@EPA: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù	Carper: ‚ÄúWhen will EPA issue binding protections?‚Äù	EPA: ‚ÄúSome number of years.‚Äù
@SenDougJones asked if @EPA has experienced any pushback from industry on whether to designate #PFAS as hazardous substances. EPA said no. That‚Äôs important, because this should mean that federal protections for PFAS are much easier to implement (from a political perspective).
@EPA says ‚Äúas the science emerges, we will look back at this issue and adjust health advisory levels as necessary.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt an issue that‚Äôs in the past that we should revisit. This is a current health problem and there are still no binding federal protections.
@SenatorHassan: ‚ÄúWaiting for more research may not get people the help they need right now.‚Äù This is crucial. We don‚Äôt have time to run analytics on all 3-5 thousand types of PFAS, we need an enforceable and health protective standard ASAP.
@NIEHS says that living near a facility that produces #PFAS is linked to higher blood levels of the toxic chemicals. Nothing revolutionary there, but good to get that on the record.
@NIEHS says DDT and PCBs are still inside every one of us, despite federal actions. That‚Äôs their fear with #PFAS‚Äîeven after we act, the problem will persist for years to come.
@NIEHS says that ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt research our way out of this,‚Äù saying we already know enough to extrapolate about the unstudied chemicals. There are 3-5 thousand PFAS compounds, too many to study individually. We already know enough to tighten protections for all kinds of PFAS.
@DeptofDefense is here to testify on contamination due to their firefighting foams. However, they are saying that they are only responsible for 3-6% of the #PFAS problem. It‚Äôs is true that the problem is bigger than DoD, but doesn‚Äôt alleviate responsibility.
This #PFAS hearing will consist of 2 panels. The first panel includes witnesses from @EPA, @DeptofDefense, @NIEHS, and @USGAO.
Background on PFAS can be found in the @EnvAm press release, linked above

@RepDebDingell pushed #EPA hard today to ‚Äúcreate that sense of urgency that cuts through bureaucracy‚Äù to #ProtectCleanWater. Also at stake, at least 5 military sites in #Michigan that have #PFAS contamination from @DeptofDefense.
@FrankPallone: "This hearing is a good start, but the communities affected by #PFAS contamination need more than just a hearing....We need a binding, enforceable, and strong drinking water standard." Spot on.
Point of clarification: these are human-made chemicals, produced in manufacturing. They're present in a lot of common non-stick coatings, like in cookware and pizza boxes. There are upwards of 5,000 different kinds of #PFAS, each with their own uses and risks.
@RepPaulTonko pressed @EPA to commit to regulating two of the best-known types of #PFAS toxic chemicals. EPA's witness wouldn't commit, asserting it's ultimately @EPAAWheeler's call.		This is where Congress should step in and make a law.
@DeptofDefense testimony: "We believe we're leading the way on fighting PFAS."		One of the best known sources of PFAS contamination is the firefighting foam that DoD uses on its bases. At a minimum, DoD SHOULD be cleaning up its own messes.
@FrankPallone: Congress should play a central role in regulating #PFAS chemicals. The current Safe Drinking Water Act is insufficient.		I'd agree that we need more robust protections for our drinking water.
So far, the #SubEnvironment #PFAS hearing has largely been a summary of the problem. In short, the chemicals are still poorly understood, but we know they're an emerging problem. @EPA and @DeptofDefense are present to share what they're doing.

@NPAA_net's Mr. Patrick Neu (paraphrased): I am not a scientist, but it is common sense that pollution is contributing to this algal outbreak problem. Urban sprawl, commercial farming, and runoff are contributing.
@CLEH2OAlliance's Bryon Stubbs finally brought us to the problem fueling algal outbreaks: nutrient loading. Glad that this is finally entering the discussion. #HAB
So far, at the @SenateCommerce hearing on harmful algal blooms #HAB has revolved solely on monitoring and research. No talk of the human pollution that fuels toxic algae outbreaks, or how to protect against it.

Taking a step back for a moment, the tone of the #WheelerHearing at the Senate #EPW committee has been quite cordial. Democrats seem to want to offer Wheeler the benefit of the doubt, and the opportunity to differentiate himself from Pruitt.
@SenatorCarper is asking @EPAAWheeler about #CleanCars at the #WheelerHearing. Wheeler says there are a lot of factors to consider in his rule on car emissions, including highway safety etc.
Protesters are interrupting the #WheelerHearing at #EPW, holding up signs with Wheeler's face that say "Pruitt's Puppet" https://t.co/qlJQAtcEW2
@EPAAWheeler says that #EPA permitting and enforcement needs to have more certainty. His predecessor's policies convoluted "certainty" with a compete lack of environmental protections. #WheelerHearing
@EPAAWheeler has moved on at the #WheelerHearing to promote Trump's tax law.
Wheeler is starting off his testimony by touting the economy at the #WheelerHearing, suggesting that environmental protections and economic development can be achieved hand in hand.
@EPAAWheeler is speaking now before #EPW, delivering his opening statement at the #WheelerHearing.
@SenatorCarper is asking for @EPAAWheeler to explain the EPA's war on science, and called him out on falsely inflating costs for clean water protections in his fight to dismantle regulations. #WheelerHearing
@SenatorCarper is lightening the mood at the #WheelerHearing, suggesting @EPAAWheeler might need something "stronger" than his Coca Cola before the end of the day.
@SenJohnBarrasso is currently hating on the #CleanWaterRule. He claims the rule is "ridiculous," and cited an example of a farmer being fined for digging a ditch in his back yard. Unfortunately for that example, ditches are explicitly NOT affected by the rule.
@SenJohnBarrasso is starting off the #WheelerHearing by praising @EPAAWheeler for his efforts to increase transparency at EPA.
@EPAAWheeler is now here at #EPW as the #WheelerHearing gets under way.
@SenatorCarper draws attention to a "trend," as @EPWGOP and @EPWDems vote different ways on all the nominations today at #EPW. Business portion of the #WheelerHearing has now concluded. Stay tuned.
#PeterWright's confirmation passed #EPW as well.
@EPWDems all voted NO on #McIntosh. @EPWGOP voted YES. Nomination passed.
Straight partisan vote currently underway on #MaryNeumayer at #EPW. Nomination passed the committee just now.
@SenMarkey referred to the #PeterWright nomination as a classic case of a "fox guarding the hen house"
@SenatorCarper is not a fan of the #Neumayer nomination https://t.co/VRMBkuraot
@SenWhitehouse says he plans to vote against confirmation of CEQ Nominee Neumayer. "Close vote" on Fleming.
Speaking #EPW's nominations, @SenatorCardin says he plans to "vote with his hopes rather than his fears"
@SenatorCarper is now speaking now before the Senate #EPW committee, highlighting his concerns about CEQ nominee #MaryNeumayer.
@SenJohnBarrasso just started the hearing. Before the #WheelerHearing  starts, they will be working though other official business (Including 4 nominations, one of whom is Mary Neumayer).
This is the first time that @EPAAWheeler will appear in his capacity as EPA's Acting Administrator before Congress. #WheelerHearing
Today I'll be live tweeting the #WheelerHearing at the Senate's #EPW committee! Just grabbed my seat. Senators are starting to trickle in. Proceedings start at 10:30am.

Only part of the story: the same measure passed the House as part of the Farm Bill--on the same afternoon. Water lovers: stay vigilant. #CleanWaterRule @EnvAm https://t.co/dc8LHulEqo
@realDonaldTrump and @EPAScottPruitt's move to eliminate the Clean Water Rule--on top of everything else--will "destroy wetland mitigation banking at the federal level." https://t.co/kho9Iw3POZ @EnvAm #CleanWaterRule #ProtectCleanWater
The House's Dirty Farm Bill is the thing to watch today. Dirty water, destruction of forests, and pesticides are all on the docket. https://t.co/CMAZFGPzlL #FarmBill18
Scott Pruitt is undermining bedrock environmental laws. Anyone who cares about the Clean Water Act needs to follow this. https://t.co/5l82TZ0wPg
