@senatemajldr @SenSchumer the gov. shut down is getting more and more absurd each day. Act as a branch of Gov. work together and act as a check on the prez. We need Congress more then ever. Please.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @FoxNews You have committed sexual crimes... oh wait they where against grown women... never mind not as bad. Plus your white. Feel free to grab pussy, my apologies.
@KamalaHarris Thank you for coming to my small town. This means alot. To know you are on our side. This will be a chalange. We need all the help we can get. I am proud to call you my senator.
@KamalaHarris Happy birthday, I am so proud to be your constituent. You give me hope that there is going to be a better tomorrow.
@Slate I think you made a giant leap. Warren choice to disclose her ethnic  backround. She did not set a standard or a norm. She was not forced to by Trump or other pressures. Rather I think she showed how ridiculous the idea was.
@realDonaldTrump Remind them to register... oh yeah I forgot you do not believe in democracy.
@rgay The structure of a good paragraph.
@PhillyD I undersand where you are coming from, but it's much better to say,  Trump's behavior and Rick Scott's are abnormal and wrong or countour productive to our democracy than prais Rubio for do a normal task.
@PhillyD It does not matter what "side" his crowd is on. The "crowed" are his constituents. You are setting a very low bar. He should not be praised, it should be expected.
