@allinwithchris Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
@MHarrisPerry What I think I'm hearing is Give me your tired, your poor, Your (white) huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
@Morning_Joe Why does Palin smile when she talks of impeachment?  Because she enjoys it.  Sick
@Morning_Joe Christie is about Christie.  He thinks Christie is wonderful.
@Morning_Joe Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
@upwithsteve Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore

@ThomasARoberts Let me get this straight.  People in CA we yelling "we don't want you" to children?!
@mrich1201 So some young black men in hoodies walk in with guns -- what then?  Is the protection for Whites Only as the signs used to say?
@allinwithchris Deja vu all over again.  I'm old enough to remember vietnam "advisors". #ISIS
@edshow My water and my crop and animal water comes from the ogallala aquifer.  Promise no leaks for at least 1000 years. #ogallala
@krystalball GOB - Government Of the Bigots - that's the reason for all of the resistance, and children suffer. Maybe GOL - lowlifes.
@maddow Cochran was more likely talking about boys' torture of animals rather than sex.
@hardball Their lies caused the deaths of more than 4000 Americans plus many others.  When will they go to jail for war crimes?
@TweetAForYes Cheney et al lied, causing the deaths of more than 4000 Americans plus many others.  When will they go to jail for war crimes?

@chrislhayes More than 4000 American lives were lost based on lies.  Who is going to jail?
@dailyrundown Dave Brat says tie wages to productivity.  OK.  It has shot straight up with the advent of technology, so should be $100?
@maddow The crazies won against Cantor.  Good news for the Dems.
@SteveKornacki I didn't know being black was an impeachable offense.
@allinwithchris What about the Koch's subsidies for oil?
@chucktodd I see kids escorting people.  That's why D-Day.  Maybe someone will take public note of that.
@JoyAnnReid So when is Adam O’Neal going to run for gov?  Can he move to Texas?
@edshow Let me see, is being black impeachable?  It is according to some.
@PoliticsNation ..social welfare organization.. must not be organized for profit and must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare.
@RonanFarrow So when is Richard Martinez going to run for office?
@MorningJoeguest This is not for serious discussion, but could someone make the Coke ads go away?!  Kinda cute first 1000, but no more.
@NowWithAlex I get my drinking water and crop water from the ogallala aquifer.  Promise no leaks for 100 years?
@Morning_Joe And now the bad guys know the government knows where the girls are.
@allinwithchris So some black youth walk into a place in their hoodies carrying long guns which they have full legal right to do.  OK?
@edshow Sure would like to see you on Morning Joe to educated Joe re xl
@hardball Condoleeza Rice or Susan Rice?  Think I'd rather have Suzan on my side.

@PoliticsNation appalachia kids are white - that's it -  ALL kids need food!!
@maddow The nutballs plan to take the country back from that uppidy ..... That's their real agenda.  It's always the agenda of bigots.
@edshow #KXL No spills over the ogallala aquifer, my drinking water, for 1000 years, right?  How many temp and perm jobs?
@hardball The repub base will not accept anything Obama likes because he's black, perios.
@upwithsteve I didn't know you could impeach someone for being black. That's their real goal
@msnbcDisrupt GOB - Government of the Bigots
@msnbcDisrupt Let's see who was pres during Beirut Marine Barracks Bombing?
@edshow Discussion: KXL leak detection -- what happens to ogallala aquifer if there is a leak?  And how many temp vs permanent jobs?
@edshow How many temp jobs from KXL? Permanent? How long to detect when and where a leak? Guarentee no leak 50 years &amp; no harm to ogallala?
@chrislhayes How about #iraq
@maddow Bachmann needs to answer WWJD before she opens her mouth. No way would He do 911!!
@MorningJoeguest How many construction jobs KXL provide? Permanent jobs? How will leaks be detected?  How long to locate? No leaks 50 years?
@maddow Above all, we should remember that Reagan was actor.  Was the whole thing an act?
@tamronhall Come to the East side of Lubbock some day.  Smelly cotton seed oil mills etc.  Poor minorities are often in industrial areas.
@edshow Top 1% pay 30%? Shouldn't they pay 99%??!! #edshow
@edshow What are health laws re shutting down public restrooms?
@thecyclemsnbc Look up cell phone and Hedy Lamarr

@Morning_Joe Nominate CC.  The dems will love it!  NYC might love him, but ask us in LT.  Try to bully us in West TX and see what happens!
@hiltzikm Will Ted Cruz change his mind about Obamacare based on what he's heard from followers? -- NO! http://t.co/e68pZvwziN
@allinwithchris So CC the bully begs SA, who suggested nuking people he doesn't like.  So the phone goes off at 3 am -- No thanks1!
@dailyrundown One Dollar One Vote
@msnbcDisrupt I like what Paul said = it's the math, stupid!
@craigmelvin #whatathebigi CC thinks it's all about him
@upwithsteve Why would anyone want CC the bully as pres?  Like to guess how a West Texas reporter would respond to his abuse?
@Morning_Joe Why do Kochs spend their money?  To get rid of laws that protect fellow Americans.  That's un American.
@CharlieRoseShow Why in the world is Carter seen as anything less than a great president, considering all he did?

@Morning_Joe Teach the parents at the same time.  Undereducated parents don't know how to help prepare their kids for school. #education
@Morning_Joe Lots of kids don't have easy internet access.  They need book stores and libraries.
@Morning_Joe Read the law re the IRS situation.
@Lawrence Have they ever discussed the law vs IRS regulations?  Looks like all or most of this would go away if they got into the law.
@hardball Please don't think all of us in Texas are under Cruz control.  From Lubbock.
@maddow Bill Wolffm can't hear you - turn your mike up.
@SteveKornacki I don't think Joe is seen as tough enough and she would be the first woman.
@Morning_Joe What's Rand Paul’s solution for lowering health costs?
@JansingCo My Brother’s Keeper is a great idea, but the kids will fare better if the parents become educated.  Teach them at the same time.
@Lawrence Repubs start by assuming we are stupid.  Was at a "town hall" where the only ones the guy would speak were the suits.
@edshow The rich guy confirms what I have thought for many years -- one dollar, one vote.  #jobsearch
@maddow Remind me, what grade are these repubs in? #4thgraders
@Morning_Joe Define Middle Class.  I think some think it's $500K #middleclass
@maddow I can't hear your producers very well.  Can their mikes be turned up?
@hardball Sure glad we are not going to have Christie as pres #bully
@PoliticsNation #stand Sounds like Jordan Davis was the one who had the right to stand his ground
@Morning_Joe How about whole milk and heart? #fatheart
@Morning_Joe Education is the key.  Ex, some jobs pay about 100k/year still green out of school:http://t.co/aaBWnii8Fw #Education
@Morning_Joe We should remember that Reagan was trained as an actor.
@maddow Can't hear Bill Wolff.  Looks like executive producer would make sure mike turned up.
@TheLastWord Grimm *did* make the repub's real response to the sotu
@MHarrisPerry My son was allergic to pampers, etc. so we used cloth and washed them.  Speak to that.
@Morning_Joe We in the rest of the country are so concerned about DC, NY, NJ and the Upper East Side (don't know, don't care what that is)
@Lawrence What a contrast - KIND kids then Christie’s perception problem!
@edshow Follow the money for us re TPP, Ed
@MorningJoe NY monthly food stamps = 147.75 per person per month.  Who around your table will feed on that for one month?
@Morning_Joe there would be no war if those who made war had to go to war
@Morning_Joe often, uneducated parents don't understand value of education -- educate parents
@Morning_Joe what do we pay for petro superiority -- discuss problems with fracking -- haven't heard much about it lately
