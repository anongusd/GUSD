#TXSenateDebate what we learn moving fwd, identity politics works for everyone and is now a “must have more” for Cruz. Just not when Obama did it. Beto loses momentum on message. Cruz takes the lead imo. We’ll wade through the polling in the coming days.
Cruz pivots to “peace through strength” but it has him off balance at least.
My point: get Cruz to, in the same response, support free trade and remark on “a price to be paid” and if tariffs is that price. Remind audience, tariffs are taxes. Not once once was the term “fiscal prudence” used when it could have been so many.
@BoBosBack Agree to disagree
@BoBosBack I’d prefer a conservative standing up there, but there wasn’t one.
#TXSenateDebate Overall: Beto has the better message on majority (not all) of topics but did not execute. Cruz won on the message of misleading character assasination. Cruz has yet to stand on any policy, remarks are largely Beto is a radical liberal. Very. Little. Reason.
#TXSenateDebate Is this a real question here? The reins on these two needs to be let go.
#TXSenateDebate All Beto needs to do here is say, “There are no more conservatives, look at the tax cuts. Marijuana could create federal revenue, which would justify reducing the tax burden.”

#TXSenateDebate Tax cuts is not the pivot to point to substance. Recent polling shows the national message has failed miserably.

#TXSenateDebate This would be the very first time I’ve heard a collective Santa Fe response that they overwhelmingly desire “more guns in schools.”
RT @elainaplott: Cruz just forced Beto O’Rourke into saying, multiple times, “I fully support the Second Amendment.”
#TXSenateDebate Cruz drawing muddy lines between Beto and “bad stuff” playing the allocation of sentiment game. TX is largely not a fan of HRC. How many times will he put HRC and Beto in the same response?
#TXSenateDebate Cruz reminding us of our fathers GOP. Beto would be right to make a heel turn here to point out the grand ol party has lost sight of fiscal prudence.
