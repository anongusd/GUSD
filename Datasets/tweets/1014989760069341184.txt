No matter what you have been through as a Satanist, I do not need to become who you were to move anything forward. You were you. I was me.
I have no desire to stay in a holding pattern of having to conquer. I want to thrive doing the things I love to do and am good at. If you refuse to believe I'm good at anything while you count your money made from my intellectual property, then what?
It seems that the only way those of you that use me for attaining wealth and information can change it up for me a little is to conquer jealous sabotage. If you don't care, which seems to be the case, I suffer. I wish that wasn't what was driving you.
Being stuck in a holding pattern feels awful, but I choose to look toward Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith.
I'm crying because people are so bored with my life that they would prefer me dead.
Just because you see my past present and future does not mean that you know me. Information does not necessarily reflect truth.
Satanism in its various forms has taught and pretty much completely brainwashed people to believe that I am a bad person because I am not a Satanist and that my purpose in life is to be raped and thwarted in any attempt toward having a successful life and journey forward.
I wish I wasn't eskewed as a conquered being by the exasperating wealth of information there is about me. I'm a real person with needs and wants and hopes and dreams. I have realized today that progress is left up to those that refuse to believe that I really am who I am.
This was a created day by God. I will look up today hoping for another one tomorrow with sunshine in it.
For the record in my own heart, I was never a Satanist, I never wanted to be a Satanist, and I will never choose to be a Satanist. My sorrow for being tormented by the followers of that religion are great.
I have basically been reduced to a blow up doll with brain waves.
Acting as if my life affected others at one point, I am constantly being reminded that I am worthless and unimportant in life and made to look and act like the biggest fucking fool I would have never have been had it been my choice.
After 36 years as a born again Spirit filled Christian, I have been informed that I have to be turned into the one satanist while everyone else acts as a Christian. Just a side note:  no real Christian would turn anyone into a Satanist.
After watching every person I come into contact with getting hooked up beyond their wildest imagination while I waste away in sorrow and unending hopelessness, I am dumbfounded by the stark contrast.
It's interesting to me that what makes people cheer up these days is still jealous sabotage.
To all those that daft punk people for fun, being a Christian is hard. Jesus empowered people to thrive in life and eternity. Maybe try that.
I'm so used to the finger pointed at me that I forgot what it feels like.
Wow. I intended to reach out to relate to anyone who has felt isolated by their idiosyncratic intimacy barriers and I got walloped with accusations and insinuations about every area of my life that people could find something in particular they identified as a weakness.
I have an idiosyncratic intimacy barrier that has left me wasted and alone even inside of a relationship. It's not something that can be counseled through. I'm happy for people that don't have to go through that.
Idiosyncrasies accepted by true loves can both increase the love quotient in a relationship and cause the size of the heart of the acceptor and cause both parties to believe in deeper love. Deeper calls to deeper.
To all the male baby boomers that have been given everything they've ever wanted by their kids, ask the Holy Spirit for renewed vision and purpose.
RT @SecretService: The Secret Service sends our heartfelt condolences on the passing of Former President George H.W. Bush. Timberwolf, you…
Appreciate and honor one another.
Some people do not want jealousy out of their lives. If they stop being jealous, then they want people to be jealous of them to feed their egos.
As you develop a "filled up" relationship with the Holy Spirit, a "filled up" life of your own may come out of it. All the jealousy you have or had will lose its lustre.
Going through the stages of grief as a way to get through loss as it relates to dealing with jealous sabotagery may leave an empty space.  Seek the Holy Spirit and ask Him to fill it up.
Hebrews 11:6 says God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.
The Bible says in Exodus 20:17 not to covet(be jealous of) your neighbor's spouse, house, employees, tools, mode of transportation, or anything else that they have.
Some delicious lemonades:		*"I'm sorry"	*"I'll fix it"	*new beginnings	*fresh starts
When in the bargaining stage of loss due to the grieving process in order to overcome a lifestyle of jealous sabotagery, learn to make lemonade out of the lemons you  earn from the mistakes you made(make).
When going through the bargaining stage of loss which involves the "what if had I scenarios," allow yourself to be embarrassed.
When confronting anger in the loss sequence, massage can be key. Toxins may get released, so grab a protein drink and some water and hydrate.
Breathe.
If hate wells up within you as you confront loss(es),  a jealous binge on sabotage isn't the only route.
When confronting addictive behaviors while dealing with the anger stage of loss, make space for dance. In the Bible, King David danced.
The anger stage of loss can be tricky, especially when it comes to dealing with addictions.
If my theology is off by saying Jesus said feed my sheep when the apostles argued about who was greatest in the kingdom, I'll remember that He taught a lot about sheep.
To all the peeps with hope filled lives full of loving friends, family, love and laughter, thank you.
Dousing the fire that has burned within me for Jesus and for a fulfilling existence must pay at a very high rate.
For all the suicides that are blamed on people's inability to go on, I believe most people want to thrive so bad, they don't know how to get there any other way than death. I hope that other people than me get to experience that thrive through life outside of hopeless peril.
For what it's worth, my intellectual property has been robbed a smidge.
I have my dad to thank for my newfound inability to hope for love and a life that includes being loved back by the people I have poured my absolute complete blood(literally), sweat and tears into. His cynical smile and obsession with my demise and hopelessness leaves me as that.
The man of my dreams finds me not worthy of romantic love and as, basically, a commodity for hedonistic females to prey upon. I've beheld a lot of disappointment in life, but have let out a prolonged sigh of defeat as a romantic.
To my kids that care, I don't know which dumpster I will be left to sleep in from one night to the next, but I am grateful for the times I have had with you.
Every celebration in the Bible involved feasts without a tauting eye over your shoulder begging to disdain you in the community.
To those evily sabotaged as to have their unwanted girth as a woman maintained by Satanists to keep them from eating in a manner that kept them ever evolving in the joi de vivre as the Bible depicts so clearly it would be in the Kingdom come, it could have been so good.
I, Nicole LeAnn Clairmont, do hereby renounce any offiliation with and hope to somehow place a legal restraining order in the system against any member of the medical community that is reversing my body's natural chemical tendency towards healthy metabolic function.
Girth and physical appearance is an issue of such great magnitude in today's society. I am personally met with the grave consequences of satanists that thwart and disregulate my balance of my body chemistry.
We all have gifts and talents and life is made up of seasons and beginnings and ends like nature is.  Satanists will not stop at reversing the natural processes in nature, I have noticed.  Why is this?
The twelve disciples argued about their individual greatness in the Kingdom and Jesus' reply was "Feed my sheep."  Thus, the body of Christ matters in simply resolving unmet socio- and religious economic ends. That does not indicate a totality on the front lines.
The giddiness that forms out of unresolved grief over losses in life over lives, maybe, due to jealous cravings for power and eviling down of one's useful human endeavorers is somewhat unresolvable due to the presence of choice given by what I believe is God.
The smirk. 	The problem of evil. I have realized in recent years that no matter what I do, the problem of inherent evil in the system still persists.  I do not believe in the Yin Yang philosophy.
It is possible to be intimidating while not being terroristic. Some individuals cannot avoid their intimidating presence due to the nature of their breadth and width and their scope.
I've learned in my journey travels that knowing too much about the future can disengage you from the present moment's interchanges. The loss of interest in the skills that each person has gained through their personal unequaled life experiences can be a great loss to society.
When you live with the reality of being orchestrated against, it can be difficult to see outside of your propinquity of endangerers. I've thought how Jesus didn't heal everyone he came into contact with, but He did say that we would do even greater things than He. Look up.
When I was a little girl full of dreams and visions for my future, I didn't realize that I would circled by vultures of every kind, some inside and some out. I'm learning that what people were taught love is does not have to be left undiscoverably and discountably different.
Being -doned and made into a living Ouija board by powers that be so that I may be used for their glorification has taken the joy of life away. I know that I am not well liked but, blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anyway. I know that was not His plan for my life.
Walking by the Spirit is not the same as divining.
The longest streak of having my words divined by the stars from people that do voodoo, black arts and black magic to entertain themselves is an obliterating way to walk out existence. I am sad every day that people can't find a better way to go through and get a life of their own
Tiffany, what am I saying tomorrow at 5:00 pm sharp?
The notion that someone else thinks for me is very laughable. I'm aware of telepathy and mentalism and that men don't like a mouthy woman.
Being used like a rag or a towel because I choose to turn the other cheek has been the longest duration of torment of my life. I wish to pieces that I wasn't treated like a white trash doormat.

Ecclesiastes 3:3 may be scary for some. Read Matthew 5 all the way through.
In light of those who endure a season of mourning or grief, Isaiah 61:3 is a good promise to hold steady with. "To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning."
In different scriptures in the Bible, it commands us not to sorrow.  To avoid confusion, remember that it says that there are seasons too.  A season of grieving when needed is important. Read Ecclesiastes 3.
What comes after the stages of grief?  Joy. "His favor is for life; Weeping may endure for a night, But joy comes in the morning." Psalms 30:5

Do unto others as you would have them do to you. You probably wouldn't want to be used up, socially disgraced, and stolen from blind. Think before you act out of jealous spite.
To process loss, you may have to learn how to grieve. It's a skill.
Processing the loss of what you lack(ed) in a mother child relationship may lead to victory over jealousy.
What is a mother to you?
I've been promised today to be in a constant state of flux while peace remains with the masses. It never will cease to amaze me how this is still possible.
The hate that I have endured from every side diminishes my ability to hope for my future. Until my final breath, I choose to love and serve Jesus always hoping that one day that love will return. A workman is worthy of his hire. It is what it is.
At 39, I have realized that the woman's liberation movement has done nothing for me. In 2018, women thank men for punishing them for their inherent womanhood.   I'm not a feminist, but I do wish that, somehow, there could be some way to increase the level of basic humane respect.
If every religion's nirvana place is to have sexual intercourse of some kind with a god, what happens when god's don't want sex with those generalized eastern and western mystics?
Being unwanted and unseen as a viable human being is reason for disenfranchised daft punked to wander through surreal sorrowful existence with decisive desire to love and befriend hoping one day love and frienship returns and burdens of curses of perpetual deadendedness lifts.
You may not know me as well as you think you do.

This is a sentence to use for Tauting.
Goodbye to a season that has come to an end.
Being tortured and made to suffer does not equal growth or a greater level of Christianity to me. It just stunts your ability to thrive.
Being servant hearted is one element in a Christian walk.
Humble does not mean humiliated and meek does not mean dead.
If it is that important for you to have me be lowly, all the mental abuse will probably drive me to that point.
If you want to get to know me, stick out your hand and say, "hi. I'm so and so. Nice to meet you."  And so on. Going through every back door to get to know my brain and my repertoire does not get you to the heart of me, me.
People tell me constantly, "I want to be you, just not the 'you' part. I just want to be and do all of the things you are and do and get in life."  This is my very sad reality-everyone getting everything they can out of me and trying to replace me.
If you are not an M.D. and you want to be one, then what with me?  I am not your problem.
There are a few jobs I do NOT want:  R.N., Social Worker, Nutritionist, a man, a Psychologist, a Pastor.  Please stop hazing me to do things I am not even remotely interested in doing.
I have never wanted nor do I now want to be a man!
I have never met a soul that has been tortured as endlessly and intricately and indelicately as me. People cannot stop hazing me. Not one of you would make it through even a minute of my existence. Please stop trying to make me into who you want me to be-a replica of you! I am me
Spilling truth is not the same as spinning hate. If hearing the truth feels hateful to you, what then?
Playing with someone's body chemistry to get an agenda across is pretty cowardly.
It's not too much to ask to be loved back.
Your filters color for you everything that I do and say. Remember that next time you judge me.
Respect goes a long ways.
To my son's, I'm sorry you are embarrassed by me. I am drowning in embarrassment by your sarcastic attitudes.
I am aware that I'm being lied about pretty much 24 hours a day. What will happen if you take responsibility for your own heart's motives?
To my daughters, God created you beautiful. Use it to glorify the beauty of Jesus.
If the only thing that wakes you up in the morning is the desire to burn my inner light out so that I'll be a Satanist instead of serving Jesus like I am made to, there is nothing I can do. I do not want to be a Satanist.
Sabotage is not something I ascribe to. To those that hold me in chains of their unforgiveness, let go please and allow the light of Jesus to permeate your soul until it is full. I do not want to be a Satanist. Please allow me to serve Jesus and to work out my own salvation.
Even if my kids never claim me as their mother, some of them are so eaten up by jealousy, they are overrun by it. It's ridiculous for famous people to have to apologize for their successes to those who have not attained the same position in life.
Some of the people groups that have shown me the most disdain in life surprise me because I have no memory of intentionally offending them. Their grimacing smiles remind me to keep my heart open and not wither away from the disease of jealousy.
Thank you to God for life. It is painful and muy duro, pero una bendicia con el regalo de musica y el arte.
Good providence to those that have made a life out of making empty promises and who have done not much more than use me for their personal gain and glory. I pray some day you will change but I won't hold my breath.
The ability of jealous people to forgive hurt feelings and offenses that stem from conversations and interactions that span over a lifetime can be overcome with a choice to embrace the other's well being in life and love. I think of it like shifting from 1st to neutral to 3rd.
Jealousy in others is the one thing in life that has impacted my ability to have happiness, a positively impacting position in life, healthy breathing relationships, a self image that promotes success, an identity that allows for a reputable reputation, and a future.
I'm jealous of people who don't have an infinite number of people working against their success in life and we'll being. Jealousy is the most horrendous disease I have come upon. My jealousy brings misery.
In the Bible, it says " the wages of sin is death."  However, Jesus died on the cross to pay those wages. To find true asylum from your pecados, you have to accept that He did it for you and that it was and is enough.
Obtaining more information does not necessarily equate to seeking truth.
What is your motive when you whisper to the heart of God?
I met some people that don't think personal growth is possible. It's quite unnerving.
https://t.co/rPUEeV8y84
Friendship, counsel, an open heart and an open mind, eye contact, music, company matters.
Jesus set a standard of two way relationships with His 12.
Unidirectional relationships where one person bears the weight of other individuals" sin is unethical.  Jesus died doing this a long time ago. He did it hoping that we as people would enter into a two way relationship with Him in a spiritual dimension.
Giving unconditional love and acceptance to users creates apathetic monsters.
I have hung out with Satanists because they are people with hearts. I'm pretty open about my Christianity but I'm not a Bible thumper. I put my Bible gently on your head and say " boop."  I don't want into the Satanic religion. I just don't.
Haircut and color(dishwata ain't it)	Getting 100 layers of dead skin off my feet	Gloves	Hat	Scarf	Shoes	Glasses
Ok. Lets do it again. 1132.00	150.00. School loans	100.00 makeup and toiletries	35.00 underwear	Food outside of a homeless shelter that doesn't offer meals	Pants	Shirts(blouses, sweaters, tanks,)	Dresses(to wear to work at a job where you shouldn't wear the same outfit everyday)
You were told I was stupid my whole life. Then what?
Loneliness is killing me.
You don't have to be a Buddist to be.
Is it that important that you whiteface me as you come up to me and start touting me to my face?  I'll just wear whiter makeup. Does that work?
When I look into my heart in a contristic fashion, I find sins. I say hurtful things sometimes that I wish I could take back. To all of the people who have judged me for other sins,  "judge not lest ye be judged."
For the record, what is love to you as a Satanist?  All I know of a Satanist version of love is my death due to false and ingenuine people rallying in a bully fashion against me in the court system?
The reason I do not want to be a Satanist is that the Satanists I am surrounded by are ingenuine and false about what I say and do. If I don't want to give you a paragraph answer to a direct question, that doesn't make me a liar. I live on levels in realms. So do you.
Is it too much to ask of you witchcrafters to stop hexing me?
For the record, I have never volunteered to be homeless a day in my existence.
Is sadomasichism really the only solution you have to offer to a woman?
I am not a feminist or a female shovenist hedonist. Why do I have to be homeless and dead every day?
In Revelation, the book of the Christian Spirit filled life Bible, I read about humans reigning as Kings in the end.  To be a King, you have to allow others to be in a service position to you. Its plausible that women might make good Kings. Can you, as a man, serve a woman King?
The only way out of jealousy that I know of is contrition of heart and a right spirit. Sometimes that means you need a heart melter and repairer out of a friend.  I have a state of being of an open heart. It is the hardest position in life I have ever known.
Your jealousy sucks ass.
I see that for me to have any form of recognizable recognition that isn't a state of emergent infamy would just sink me back through histories of public dissolution of me as a person.
Love is a verb.
To all the 60+ year old men who scoff at me, have you ever thought about discovering peace in the valley of the shadows of having a conversation with a woman that isn't into grazielliing her way to your disoluting toutful lack of state of respect?
Being doesn't mean you are stationary or worth less or don't matter.
I never signed up to volunteer in life positions. Working for free is the most insurmountable sexist bigotist shovenistic trial I have been through.
The hate and spite that I get from women is insurmountable. Jealousy of anything about me as a person is the worst disease epidemic I think this world has ever known. Grow up and be happy for someone when things go right for them.
I realize now that to be in with Mike means to be against me. I am sad.
Even upon my death, I will not raise Tiffany's banner high.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A SATANIST. I GAVE MY HEART TO JESUS CHRIST AT 3 YEARS OLD. IF YOU DONT GET IT, YOU DONT GET IT. IF IM NOT YOUR FLAVOR OF CHRISTIAN, OH WELL.
To the sweet Mike I used to know and love, thanks for the memories.
I am a Christian who has NO desire to be a Satanist. Please stop proselytizing me and trying to turn me into a Satanist. I believe in GH and JD. If you don't and they don't, I still believe. I am not Satan but if society wants to place me in that position, please don't. 😥
I'm honestly not well versed in popular literature, but I have never met anyone who was made out to be a lie by way of being detested through and through by mentalized satanic works.
Until I'm dead by Mike's mighty right hand . . . .
To all the parents that find me detestable, I know that you all believe you are and were as perfect as God. There is nothing I can do to change that.
What kind of a future for a suffering homeless individual who has spent themselves loving and tolerating the hateful while even all day today was wished dead countlessly. I'm sorry you hate me. I want to live. 💄
Being tested is not a cinch. Being tested by one person is not a cinch. Five situational testings is even less of a joke. Millions at a time testing one person. Tiring.
In as of a day of particular stressors which no one but me can attain to because of the incessant plea from others that I don't matter. I'm looking forward to one day having a place of my own where I can paint. Loneliness and a desire for waged employment. It has been a hard week
To my kids	It is very painful to know how much work has gone into getting me out of your hearts. If you can't read this, I send it out to the system.
I am independent like a cat. If you have ever had a loving cat, they are very affectionate, playful, but they run their own game with you. Its very much like dance with cats, lead follow follow lead.
It could have been good, GH.
I'm being told that I am going to be TURNED again tonight. Satanists will not let up on me. It feels like death to be hunted like this. I don't want to be like you. I want to be me.
The heaviest burden of my life right now is that I have individuals who are well studied of the brain trying to split my personality.
I do not want to be a martyr Christian. If you don't want Jesus, that is your choice.
To any of my kids that wanted to get to know me, I'm sorry for what life has handed me and you.
If you have watched my involvement in Satanic rituals, I'll tell you a truth. I became a Christian at age 3. I also was forced at an early age to be a Satanic High Priestess. I imagine that I'm not the only person that has had a heavy burden to bare with a smile on their face.
To all the mother's of my children, you are free to approach me to introduce yourselves. I've had a weird life. You don't have to judge me.
Either way, I have many women in my life that want me to know what it is to be COMPLETELY TOTALLY ALONE for eternity. They want me single and without children.
I know what's up the pike. I'm told that my kids have been taken from me, and that I'll spend my existence either in prison or a mental institution. I'm not guilty or crazy and I love my kids.
Because of what I've gone through, I've experienced having God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit taken from me.
I used to sing a Christian song that said "you can't take God away from me. You take my life, my land , my liberty. Lock me up, I'll still be free cause you can't take God away from me."
From some of what I've been through, I've learned that some Satanist churches call Jesus Satan and Satan Jesus. Its also been confusing to my senses to be in Churches that manufactured the feeling of the Holy Spirit while they worshipped Satan in a Christian like setting.
The Spirit realm is real. You don't have to use a oujie board or do a seance to access it. I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit today. Its been a long time.
I have been told my whole life as a Christian that Satan is a liar. I guess we'll have to see. If he loves Jesus now, he does. If he doesn't, he doesn't. He can be tortured just like me.
I have talked to Satan before. I asked him if he wanted Satanists worshipping him and he said, "no".  He told me he submitted to God.
I love Jesus Christ. I don't know if Jesus Christ loves Himself. I don't know if Jesus Christ wants to serve a God that believes in a tribune based faith where God(not Satan), Jesus, and the Holy Spirit run things. I believe that Satan does not want to be worshipped.
Congratulations on your resistance against me and everything I am and everything I believe. I pray you have peace in that resistance. Hate is a powerful force. Enjoy it.
I DONT WANT TO BR A SATANIST!  WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO TURN ME?
The unfathomable disrespect is so debilitating. Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!
I'm rediscovering my history in the mental health system for the last 13 year's. I've been alone without friends for most of that time. This world is a lonely unfriendly place. I'm thankful for the minutes of sanity I've experienced.
Why do you want me to be like you and do the things you've done?  Then I'll feel how you feel?  Then what?
The streaming stacatto sound of crazy make crazy make crazy make blowing my eardrums out. You want to be the good ones and me the bad. Your force against me is great.
Ruining my life has is and will forever be so sweet. 😥
I am astounded by the power that mental health workers have to ruin lives.
My life is a crazymaker's paradise. What then?
"Nicole,	This is the public. We all want you dead."		"Public,  I'm sorry you feel that way. Love, Nic"
People keep telling me they know the end from the beginning. Must be a fun ride for them because they always smirk when they say it.
Tick tock 😥
I have just been informed that experience with life without me is that it's better. I was offered a knife to end my life.
Something I've noticed about people who hold onto the idea that God is good usually play a role in good change.
To people that are mad at God, I don't have much to offer except that I hold onto the Biblical idea that God is good. He doesn't really protect us from all harm but He is still good.
I am fully disinterested in trying to solve the homeless and poverty stricken epidemic. I've been homeless and working on it for 13 years and for 5 years before that when I was actually working and not homeless. I am hoping that someone will take the torch and take on this cause.
To anyone who doesn't want me dead, I'm sorry for what will occur if people are successful in ending my life this round.
Una pregunta		To the Satanists in the house,	do people get to pick their own religion still?
I know God in a new way today.
This loneliness is unparalleled.
Lastly, on my way down the slide with 25 babies in me, none of my children to hold, no husband, no money, no house, no job, I no longer trust Rodney, Mike, Carey or Tom. Thank you 4 men for giving me a futureless homeless existence without love. I loved you four so hard.
What I meant earlier is that the moment you stop needing me to waymake, you start suiciding me and threatening my life. Why, Trump, am I still broke and homeless?
I'll give YOU a heads up. I MATTER. Oh, Lucifer. Oh, Satan. and Oh, Jesus. Who is your heart set on TODAY?  As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord Jesus.
The moment you stop needing me in your vision, you start sucking me.
Since I'm the waymaker for all you power types, then what?
The public flogging and humiliation of me this week of me probably wasn't the brightest idea. Mike, I really did look up to you.
I wonder a lot if anyone else has ever gone through everyone wanting them dead everyday. Its quite a weird thing to wake up to every morning.
Bye inner calm.
Mike	You are the caddiest female I have ever met. 	Nic
OCD it is then. 😥
with the gross in depth details of my private life. You have a private life.  I don't anymore. Cherish your privacy. It is a gift.
A sad thing in my life is that Mike will NEVER think or say of me that I am a good person. He LOVES people who hate everything about me. I wish to the bottom of my soul he would find some remain of goodness in me. I try to follow the Bible. Sorry to all the people I've offended
😥
Mike		I accept that you are you. There is not a thing I can do about my reputation after you get done with it everyday.
Thank you to the people who have dedicated their time to bettering our nation. To the Senate and the House and then some.
Hedonistic witchcraft in 2018!  Wow😥
To all the mother's that did a horrible job of raising your kids, then what with me?
The importance of pleasure.
To all the witches in the system, is there ANY room for me(a not witch) or are you all gonna keep at it?
If you get famous because of me, congratulations.
Will it hurt you to admit you could learn something from me?
Mike told me I'm undergoing court to go to prison right now.
A trusty friend through the words of a song just reminded me of what it feels like to be "EYES OF FIRED"    		it's the most intense spiritual experience of life, in my opinion.
Do witches have any other agenda than to make other people commit suicide?
Shed look at some ideas for the quiet room. Again no interest.
Today, I wrote my homeless shelter roommate a note asking if she needed some help since she has a walker. She said no and she's not interested in me as a friend or my help. She's a writer and I'm pretty sure she's writing about me but whatever with my boring existence. I asked if
Good to know.
Tiffany, if I am dead, who are you going to read ahead?
17 years ago I was at Portland Neurosurgery working and came home to my roommate sitting on the couch watching the news repeat the plane crashing into t he building over and over.
I am being charged forth to walk out in traffic and get hit by a bus. Tracy, can I afford that this month?
Tracy, what's the timeline for you to sabotage the actual marriage part of the marriage?
When you feel the deep groaning and urge for me to commit suicide, is there any alternative in any of your other parts:body, mind, soul and Spirit?
Again, I believe in glory to glory.
? to Tiffany's way of destiny
Zita wants me to ask for forgiveness for hate. 		I'm not sorry. I hate evil. I just do.
God, as I know Him is not into my well being, but I still believe with all my heart He is into yours. Make the best of what you've been given. It matters in the system, in my opinion not asked for.
I'll let you know now I have been well used to help men get better at relationships WITH OTHER WOMEN!  I DONT WIN IN ANY EQUATION!
Hopeless oceans of body wrenching tears are still not enough. I may not be attractive to any man because I'd rather be happy go lucky, spin my umbrella, and smile than to wade through cycles of depression.
Begging and pleading to merciless individuals produces?
Loser me down?  That's hard. I have no love, no friends, no job, no future and everyone against me. I don't think you will break a sweat on that one.
Having people like Zita and Tracy in my life to always bring me down and make sure that I feel like a loser. Who gets that in life besides me?
To all the gals who get whatever they want no matter what they do, here's to you.  💄
If you are struggling with assigning value to something intrinsically valuable, hold your palm out and open cupped and feel the weight of the importance.
Peace. Be still.

An addiction to someone else's suffering is something that deserves attention in my opinion.
It's interesting to listen to people go on and on about how nice it is to take credit for my intellectual property.
Oneness, not ONE. We are all different. 😎
What is it about a confident woman that gets on a man's nerves?
Astrologists who are into it, what are the heavens like?
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever	Amen
Our Father who art in heaven	Hallowed be they name	Thy kingdom come	Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven	Give us this day our daily bread and	Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those trespass against us	Lead us not into temptation but	Deliver us from evil
To the people who hate on me constantly, what should a judge judge as a criminal offense?  Enough so to place them in jail or prison?
Mike, the guy who claims he met me in high school and doesn't know me, has made my life into a living fiery he'll of a joke.  Thank him if you need me to be crawling out and into my skin with emotional pain. I'm a singer too. 😥
Getting to know someone does not mean studying someone like a bug under a microscope in a homeless shelter.
If I ever get out from under what's keeping me down, I want to live from glory to glory, not in a satanic fog of ups for downs.
2 Corinthians 3:18	Bible https://t.co/96epKbb7P9		But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from gloryto glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.
To HCMC,		How irritated do I have to be?
I am the most disrespected person I have ever known.
I am a Republican.
RN's that WANT to be doctors, #1, surrender your license, go through Social Worker training, and then go to med school. 		In my opinion, Doctors should staff hospitals with Doctors with Doctor pay. Cut the witchcraft shit out completely.
It won't happen, but this was my "evil" plan. RN's that don't want to be doctors,  go through Social Worker training. Then, work as Home Health nurses.
I was premed in school. What I noticed was that most nurses wanted to be doctors. I wanted to be a doctor, not a nurse. Most nurses I've been around think they know more than doctors.
I have been horribly abused by witches. I am not a witch and I don't want to be one. In my experience personal, most nurses I've met are witches. A lot of nurses hate me because of things I have said about nurses not being necessary.
Mike, make a list of the women I hate that I will be forced to have in my life. I know you want me to be their bitch.
He has accomplished his goal. No one loves me. Good job, you. 		Im trying to figure out what to say to someone who singularly uses me for everything I have with nothing in return except empty promises about the future. 		It hurts that you get excited when people lose interest.
Channel 5 in Minneapolis,  what can I do for you?		Nicole Clairmont
You hate me because I don't think I'm nothing without you.
Mike,		What do you need me to hear from you and your tyrannical friends?		Nic
I get it. YOU GUYS want me to listen to you tear me down with nowhere to go. That's called black arts. You must all be witches.
I don't get why rich assholes get to decide who I am and what I do with my time?
It's a class thang. I wouldn't understand.
Was the best day of your life the day in February 2005 that I became homeless?  Lots of people aren't satisfied that I'm in a homeless shelter. They want and need me to bite the curb again. I am terrified to be on the street again because I don't want to get raped. My knee hurts2
4. Decide if the rush of adrenaline you get from fucking someone over due to your jealousy is worth your relationship. 	5. Find a you inside of you that you can be satisfied with.
5 steps to not letting jealousy take over you:		1.  Do the 12 steps. It will change your life. 	2. Try to find a reason to be happy for the person you are jealous of. 	3. Take an antianxiety medication for the surge of anxiety that takes over your body. 	Continued.
If you want to do a heart check on me to see if I need my heart broken because I STILL DONT LIKE YOU, be you. I do not believe I have to love or like everyone. That is my belief system religiously. Zita, I can't change you. Please let me hate you.
A little note about being near me. I have zillions of beings that don't want me to be happy. They will go to the farthest galaxy fly to the highest sky and scrape the lowest low just because they are jealous and don't ant me happy or secure. Good luck.

Jeremiah 29:11	Bible gateway NIV	"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."

2 Corinthians 3:18	Bible gateway NIV	And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
Something that has never made any sense to me is trashing someone's life to fuck so you may then bless them.
I will tell you a little secret. Making someone more homeless doesn't make them more receptive. It most likely may break their spirit. If breaking someone's spirit is your goal in life, please don't bother to talk to me or ask me for anything. 	Love,	Nicole
What runs the thing that makes everything go right?   Jealousy. 		I am so disheartened by this evil reality.

Trying to survive sabotagers on steroids is amazingly impossible sometimes.
The professional relationships between men and women hopefully consist of a base level of determined respect and dignity.
Is it necessary for a woman to be demeaned in order to be accepted into an high position?  Greek orders aren't the only examples on which to transition a person from one position in life to the next.
I have something to say. Practical stewardship did not go out of style this season.
What a joke I have become to you. I'm sad for how disrespectful you have been and for downtrodden you need me to be in order for you to function properly.
I believe longevity, in relationships, comes from the build up of moments where a memory was made.
When you endeavor to be the you that you love and appreciate, you may arrive at a place in life when you are brave enough to lose people who don't let you be you.
Being raised in Christianity, and still practicing, I believe in walking by faith instead of operating in everything I do and being driven by fear.
To all the Pastors I know and love,  I appreciate that the Word needs to go forth. I don't really want to preach but I am available to you for insight and direction. You are loved. 😊

I am in a hell created for me by a myriad of stalkers that have spent their entire lives making sure that I would never be successful at anything I set out to do. I have so many stalkers, I swear to God I can't count. I am constantly being taunted to be on the unsafe

To any victim of abuse that has ever tried to hold onto any positive feelings for me, your suffering matters. I've barely been touched lovingly in 4 years. Babies die because of that.

approached by those that knew of Him.  I'm not Jesus. He was an real historical figure that changed the world. Love matters.
When it said in the Bible that Jesus became of no reputation, I think it meant that He did not back down from the high priests. I did not believe it meant that He chose to take on a "bad" reputation. He was a teacher, a preacher, and a healer. He needed a "good" reputation to be

Me and Mike officially over in every way.
when I was woven together in the earth.
For you created my inmost being;	    you knit me together in my mother’s womb.	14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;	    your works are wonderful,	    I know that full well.	15 My frame was not hidden from you	    when I was made in the secret place,
were written in your book	    before one of them came to be.	17 How precious to me are your thoughts,[a] God!	    How vast is the sum of them!	18 Were I to count them,	    they would outnumber the grains of sand—	    when I awake, I am still with you.
Wikipedia
even there your hand will guide me,	    your right hand will hold me fast.	11 If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me	    and the light become night around me,”	12 even the darkness will not be darkto you;	    the night will shine like the day,	    for darkness is as light
Where can I go from your Spirit?	    Where can I flee from your presence?	8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there;	    if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.	9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,	    if I settle on the far side of the sea,
4 Before a word is on my tongue	    you, Lord, know it completely.	5 You hem me in behind and before,	    and you lay your hand upon me.	6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,	    too lofty for me to attain.
Psalm 139		For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.		1 You have searched me, Lord,	    and you know me.	2 You know when I sit and when I rise;	    you perceive my thoughts from afar.	3 You discern my going out and my lying down;	    you are familiar with all my ways.
Planned obsolescence, or built-in obsolescence, in industrial design and economics is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become obsolete (that is, unfashionable or no longer functional) after a certain period of time.
I now have a heart for those women and men who have been stalked until their stalker replaced them in life and love. Love to all the kids that watched it happen.
I've been through it b4, but I know true rejection desolation isolation and obsoletion. Thanks to all who participated in getting me there.
Galatians 4:6 New International Version (NIV)		6 Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba,[a] Father.”
Mark 14:36 New International Version (NIV)		36 “Abba,[a] Father,” he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
Romans 8:15 New International Version (NIV)		15 The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again;rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.[a] And by him we cry, “Abba,[b] Father.”
Having God's presence dissipate from my being while alone in the dark while alone as I'm alone being alone in an alone state. What is the next level of hell?
My newest pain is being looked over by someone who dotes on those who work wholeheartedly against my success.
Everyone I'm around demands thanks, money, position, fame, counsel, and my demise in every form.
I have never met someone like me during my 39 years. During my 39 years, I have been stalked and sabotaged unto homelessness and death in every form it comes.
I am interested in the laws about federal mail fraud and what a judge considers important regarding someone's intellectual property on paper.
What happens if you store letters outgoing because you are not ready to mail them and someone breaks into your things and opens them up for their own personal gain?
A curiosity question:  What happens if you hand a letter to someone for the purpose of them pitting it in the mail and they open it up right in front of you, throw it away and smile?
ENTITLEMENT. What does the Bible say about who we are in Christ, as believers?	Equally, is it acceptable to impersonate someone and make them obsolete?  I wish not.
If you are living "off the land" unnecessarily, there is still time to pack your bags and find a place in this world. I've been on SSDI for 10 years and people constantly complain around me about it. I worked for 20 years before I received it. I've worked for free ever since.
To me, hedonistic individuals are the Bain of society. I don't see them as go getters or strong survivers. I see them as criminals. I see them as underminers of truth and dignity.
Masonically, and with most religions, I am seen as the Bain of society, historically and futuristically.
Being disposable is a journey I never wanted to go through. It's continuous and unbareable. I've always believed that God's judgement could end lives because of the Red Sea closing on Pharoah"s Army and because of the flood with Noah.
I still believe faith and love can move mountains.
Is there antiapathetic life out there?
Stalking is unwanted or repeated surveillance by an individual or group towards another person.[1] Stalking behaviors are interrelated to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. 	Wikipedia
Wouldn't it be weird if a person's life was completely on display 24 hours a day?  It would be even weirder if the only people around that person judged them vehemently?
Black arts is the most debilitating experience I have ever undergone. I wish someday to be free of its use by individuals I am around. It will be a good day for me when people live their own lives instead of mine.
I've been thinking a lot about people who have been mentally tortured and abused for extended periods of time. Instead of exposure, I believe tender loving care to be the solution for healing for most individuals. PTSD is complex.
I once told a man that he was my deepest ocean. I did not know that the ocean was hate and humiliation and spite.
The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivativemarkets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller profit margins.
I have an ablation coming up. My life has flashed before my eyes a time or two recently. If I could, I would tell all the kids I know, "Make good decisions while you are still in your right mind. Maybe it matters."
Its weird to watch power hungry individuals.

frown (also known as a scowl) is a facial expression in which the eyebrows are brought together, and the forehead is wrinkled, usually indicating displeasure, sadness or worry, or less often confusion or concentration. The appearance of a frown varies by culture.
God is love.  Love is a force of nature. Love is a physical force. https://t.co/gBOsmumjh6
No matter what your experience is with Jesus, the idea of Jesus from the Judeo Christian Bible still remains. He taught us how to live. Love does not have to be brown nosing your sworn enemies. Jesus was very intellectual and curt with the high priests.
What to do when you are told NO ONE LOVES YOU ANYMORE!

God, as God is known to me is a smidge more nudgy. Jesus taught us how to pray and how to live. God is a loving judge and keeper of souls. I choose to pray to all three with my life.
I really can not figure out what, besides Jesus would will stop a torturer from torturing. The Holy Spirit is a gentleman. That's how I was raised. If He nudges you to stop what you are doing, it's probably in your best interest and everyone else's.

Torture (from Latin tortus: to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological suffering on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim.

To lose this weight, I am doing my best to promise my body some fat and sugar so that it will burn fat and sugar. Tiffany Idea is a stalker of mine. I have no way of controlling her agendas and her mouth.
I weigh 292 and after walking for hours a day during the last 5 year's, I'm mostly muscle. I am recovering slowly from a supernatural birth process of seven babies who have been claimed to be had by Tiffany Odea.
I would like to say a few words about my weight. I have endured non-anorexic starvation through having black arts done to me for about 13 years. I am pretty connected to my body and know how to pull out of a starvation type syndrome my body is in.
I have a cosmic question?  Why am I in a homeless shelter constantly on the verge of being put to th he street?
bile reduction in the stomach. Many are interested in my diet choices. I have had so much pain that I am loaded with Bile. When it centers itself in my stomach, I get rid of it. Most of the foods I choose help me delete bile.

What kind of a paradigm shift do we have to go through to respect each other?
Prostitution. I am threatened on every side to get pushed into it because of my socioeconomic status. I'm not into it. Being a confident female doesn't exactly pay off in our society, especially if you're re not into hedonism.
When I talk about religious economic systems, I'm speaking of the way each religion,to speak of, has formed and shaped the world's way of exchanging services. Some people get paid to work and some don't.
Trying to get through to me might be impossible. I'm so tired of being blackballed.
Religious economics. Now what?
