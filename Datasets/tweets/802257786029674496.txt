@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump Why shouldn't this man be mocked? I feel its just as important to criticize someone in the oval office as it is to respect the position. The position. Not the person in it...
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump I'm curious, are you insinuating there's a problem with insulting the sitting President or is it just Donald? I'm sure a man by the name Barack Obama has mutual feelings...
@RepLarryBucshon Agreed entirely, nonetheless, would you say Barak Obama and Bill Clinton were victims of this very same "presidential harassment"? I'm sure you remember Jacket Gate....
@realDonaldTrump Negotiations***......
@realDonaldTrump You're digging yourself quite the hole there....
@RepMullin Aren't you in Oklahoma? How much are you affected by a border wall on a border, I'd guess,  that's least a few hundred miles from your closest city?
@RepRWilliams Mr. Trump doesn't seem to be shy on any form of media even his own Twitter account, not to mention the numerous rallies across the U.S... It seems as if we here plenty of our president. #passthebill
@realDonaldTrump What about the hundreds of thousands of murders committed by Americans of Americans...?
@realDonaldTrump If I'm not mistaken, don't 50% of immigrants migrate via airplane? Therefore, isn't there an illegal immigration population that travels with a mode of transportation in which a wall does little to no help?
@NBCPolitics Yes!!!!
RT @NBCPolitics: Reporter: "Can I ask you about the omnibus?"		Sen. Kennedy: "Yeah, it sucks."		Read more about the omnibus spending bill:…
@RepStephMurphy I think we can pass a bill that does that without 2300 pages of misinformation and excessive military funding...
@replouiegohmert You should call it "National our Government paid for you to be here, allowed you to come thru and sell us your opiods because White people like White powder Day"....	Why not introduce a bill that puts term limits on boys like yourself?
@RepBlainePress No, you voted on a 2300 page bill you didn't read...
@RepMarkMeadows Don't necessarily agree with your reasoning but please appose anything 2300 pages long that you havent read entirely....
@HouseGOP My priority is feeding the some 1 in 7 children who don't eat enough, house the homeless (considering there's plenty of vacant buildings every city approved) and removing politicians from their role as they continue to pass legislation that does NOT benefit us nor our priorities
@RepPittenger @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan Oh boy, more toys to play with while our mathematic, scientific and historic knowledge goes kaput.... terrific
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I follow my income meticulously, and there's been no difference in the amount I make. Can you explain this?
@realDonaldTrump Sorry, this is Fake news
@realDonaldTumpr @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump How come you didn't respond to me?
@realDonaldTrump It's fairly late, don't you need to be in bed?
@JimInhofe Is it an appropriate time to talk gun safety and regulation yet?
@realDonaldTrump Where does that figure come from?
@FoxNewsResearch So, what I'm hearing is, even with Obama not declaring his 2017 a SOTU, which he could have, same goes for 2009 and 1993, Trump still lied saying this was "the most viewed SOTU in history".. very curious to see your comparison of Trump's false statements to Obama's and Bush no.2
@SenateMajLdr It seems odd corps. are willing to give higher wages once they benefit from this exact bill. Ironically, many of these corps. had committed to bonuses, and some layoffs, prior to this tax reform. Senator, you seem to be only approaching this from one perspective.
@realDonaldTrump Obstruction of justice is deemed as unconstitutional... Nixon luckily got to resign before impeachment. I hope all "obstruction" is brought to light.
@GOPChairwoman @GOP Many of those same companies were actually committed to those bonuses prior to the tax bill, ironically, many of them, like Wal-Mart for example, increased wages as they laid thousands of people off...
@realDonaldTrump I feel the American public feels/felt the same way about your tax returns
@RepMarkMeadows There was not a single ultimatum hidden inside that CR? Seems a bit strange democrats would simply refuse spending for CHIP recipients...
@SteveScalise Are the republicans no longer a part of the Senate or House? This is a two party problem @SteveScalise 	There are ultimatums hanging in the balance and you know this as well as all other Senators, Congresswomen and Congressmen. This is up to you all
@timkaine We were there in D.C. Together We Rise.
@RepBuddyCarter @HouseCommerce I checked, the bill you voted for in September last year, strictly passing on party votes with only 3 of your colleagues voting Nay, furthered CHIPs funding yet raising premiums to Medicare beneficiaries,  shortening grace periods to pay premiums for those a part of the ACA....
@NatResources @SenateDems @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @RepGosar @replouiegohmert @westerncaucus @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan I didn't know Schumer ran the whole Senate, despite GOP control of both chambers....
RT @SenSchumer: .@realDonaldTrump should heed his own words:	“if there is a shutdown I think it would be a tremendously negative mark on th…
@SenateMajLdr Aren't the Republicans a part of Congress, too? This shutdown is not one sided, no different than the 2 week shutdown in October of 2013 or in 1995. This isn't a party problem, this is a people problem.
@SpeakerRyan Do you have any concerns other than your military's funding? If so, what? Do you feel there should be an end of discussion and a garunatee of CHIP? That DREAMers living here, born here, secured by the 14th amendment (purposed by your party decades ago) rightfully should stay?
@DesJarlaisTN04 Was it not the democrats who increased the military's funding during WW1 and WW2? There's already been tweets from GOP reps all saying the same thing. Where's the diversity? Are there any concerns other than our military's funding, if so, what? There's more to it than that...
@SenateMajLdr Then what's the hold up?
@RepBillJohnson I think Paul Ryan already tweeted that... almost exactly word for word.... good to see the diversity of the GOP...
@SpeakerRyan @USNavy @USArmy @usairforce Who are we at war with?? What's the point of an overly funded military when we have under funded education?
@FoxNews @Johnny_Joey Actually, our national anthem was written based on an old British tune about the flag that still stood during the invasion by the British onto Fort McHenry, nothing to do with the improvement of America considering it was written in a time of slavery, lack of women's rights, etc.
@DickDurbin Indeed! What are your thoughts and biggest requirements for a secure and lasting program that will ensure children won't lose coverage based on any factors?
@realDonaldTrump Actually, after watching the whole thing unravel, it seemed Stephen didn't want to answer questions asked of him, only questions he had "prepared" to answer. Also, we are quite curious if Fox News is also considered "fake news" or is it just CNN and everyone else?
@realDonaldTrump If we require ID for voting then should we also make retrieving an ID card simple (for all of us) to obtain and not costly. All voters should have equal access to vote. Nevertheless, studies show there's been less than 100 reported cases of voter fraud (shy of 3.8 million)
@timkaine Thank you Mr. Kaine for speaking on behalf of the less fortunate. We all need to act towards those with nothing as if they had given everything to you.
@JeffFlake I find it equally disturbing, the mere fact the current administration isn't in question or believed to be at fault. Mr. Flake, do you feel our sitting president has been completely innocent of any wrong doing since taking office? If so, or if not, do you plan to speak or act?
When one must, one can.
A happy and joyous holiday season for you all. May you be embraced by love, happiness, and peace. Much love to you all.
@JimInhofe Merry Christmas! But, one must not forget, Christmas was moved to December 25th centuries ago for it was already instilled on pagan traditions. Based on the context and "clues" of the Bible, we can safely assume Jesus was born in the month of Tishri or mid-September. Just saying.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, We appreciate the individual tax cuts, however, there are certain portions of this bill that seem to be more concerning than conclusive. There's much to agree upon, even more to discuss. I hope one day We get an opportunity for more than a brief moment to share words.
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I noticed a hand full of those judges were passed by slim margins. Thoughts as to why?
@SpeakerRyan Is there possibly a simplified graph for individuals to see just exactly how much they will be saving under this tax bracket versus what it once was?
We need legislation to ensure acts of hate, incivility, and greed can't occur in our nation. We need leaders who stand by the people 100% of the time. We need not have legislation that is promoted and passed by one side. This must be for us all. 		For the love of all....
Congress woman/men, Senators and @POTUS :		We, Humane Campaign, are seeking to improve the living standards of human beings internationally. We start in the U.S. for this is our home. We can't fix what is broken in our neighbor's home if we don't address what is broken in ours.✌
@ttsp767 And I have to say I should've known it would be the NY TIMES or The Washington Post
@ttsp767 Prefect, thank you much. We do our best to ensure we have the facts and that the facts are authentic. By no means do I believe what our President says, I know all to well of the never ending list of fallacies. Same goes for Congress. Each side of the aisle needs to stop leaning.
@ttsp767 @JimInhofe @POTUS Surprisingly, even though there isn't a source for your graph, I have no problem believing that. Still, would like to see statistical evidence provided by an authentic proving the statement/tweet by @JimInhofe
@FoxNews @seanhannity The Watergate scandal resulted in a Republican President, without an opportunity of impeachment, resigning, leaving the White house lawn by helicopter with a "sign-off" to America. Do you feel Trump and those involved should face the music?	@seanhannity @FoxNews
@JeffFlake I disagree. Decency is the quality of being decent, to be respected but to be adequate. You can't give a homeless man a dollar and feel you've done a good enough, give a hug, wise words of encouragement and do it tomorrow. It's not about one vote @JeffFlake it's about each vote.
Congress and Trump: 	Can we work towards brighter futures for us all? Senators, Congresswomen/men can we create legislation that seeks progress and betterment for us all, moving up the steps of Capitol Hill not steering left or right only forward? 	@POTUS 	@TheDemocrats 	@GOP
@lisamurkowski Please do, Lisa. Both sides of the aisle should have the same intentions for keeping children's health programs in tact.
@JimInhofe @POTUS Is there any sort of statistical proof with representation that would back this statement?
Congratulations to Doug Jones. First democrat of Alabama since Howell Heflin. Roy Moore, like John Conyers and Al Franken you should be held accountable for your actions, nothing overlooked because of your status, wealth, or religious affiliation. 	Live by the words you speak.
Is there something I can do?
March in DC. Monumental moments for woman and all human beings of this country. POWER to the PEOPLE!!	Long Live AMERICA https://t.co/vk83uovRUs
