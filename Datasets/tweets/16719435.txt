@Freeyourmindkid It’s well known that the one subject that racists absolutely detest discussing is RACE. Any mention of it sends them into a racist tantrum.
@HillaryzMyHmgrl @Freeyourmindkid Used by 9 out of 10 #MAGAts and #BernieBros. (The other 10% are just flat out IDGAF racist.)
@Freeyourmindkid So all it took was being ratioed on Twitter to make her a racist. 	Such a strong “ally”.

@jaded_sister @Freeyourmindkid That’s what racists tend to do. It seems the only way they know how to respond to charges of racism is to be MORE RACIST.

@jupiterboy99 @realDonaldTrump I get the feeling Ivanka is just cozying up to him until it’s time to pull the plug, just like the rest of his kids (and Melania).
@realDonaldTrump Funny. You didn’t seem to have a problem with his “lying” when he did it for you for over 10 years.
@marcushjohnson Easy. “Free college” is “writing a check” for White people.

@wordlass1 @SallyAlbright @robjshearer Most larger schools, yes. Many smaller schools don’t have the donor base (or the student base) to maintain a viable program. 	That being said, for kids who play in high school, it often can be a ticket into college.
@SallyAlbright @robjshearer Someone should remind him that college football is how many White (and Black) kids get into college. 	Sounds like more magic-pony emo s#it to me.

Hey #MAGA. If these same words came from Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, would you still assume it was anti-Trump?	That you see a call to unify in “love versus hate” as an “attack” says more about you than it does about Mr. Lee, or even TRUMP. Maybe more than you want. https://t.co/CDcK9T36Ue
@KamVTV @realDonaldTrump Enlighten me, please. At what point did Mr. Lee call for mobilization against Trump?  I don’t recall him mentioning Trump by name. 	Was it the part where he said “Make the moral choice between love and hate”?

@DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump And nowhere in this speech does he mention Trump by name. 	It’s telling that a call to mobilize in unity out of love instead of hatred is seen as anti-Trump by him and his Trumpanzees.

@mgranville1 “The good news is, there are fewer candidates vying for those votes.”		The bad news (for Bernie, that is) is that it’s because they’re not the most reliable voting bloc.
@psrmiami @mmpadellan Republican pols are too chicken-s#it to challenge him. And Republican voters are to blinded by their racism and xenophobia to vote against him.
@mmpadellan I feel the same way. As much as I’d love to see him perp-walked pu of the WH in handcuffs, I think it’d be so much more satisfying (not to mention devastating to his ego) if he were to be thoroughly rejected by the American people in 2020. I believe it would literally kill him.

@brat2381 @veterans_i Damn right. https://t.co/utkPNcBVWW
@Anootchka Yeah. I was actually called that, along with the c-word. They’re not very imaginative (or bright TBH).
@JoyfullCat @alley_alley1 I got it. She was expanding my analogy by satirically claiming men voting for Bernie because he’s a man. Like his supporters claim we support women candidates because they’re women. Remember when they called us vagina-voters.

@coolmomT @notcapnamerica That and grapes in the chicken salad. 🤮🤮🤮🤮

@notcapnamerica This is what happens when you escape from the bio-dome you’ve been living in since the 80s and no one’s told you yet that it’s 2019.
In the meantime, I’ll be over here, supporting MY candidate. #KamalaHarris2020
So when y’all say “we need to all come together”, say it to the Bernie folks who insist on alienating themselves from the rest of the party like spoiled little bitches who can’t have their way so they take their ball and go home.
Here the thing. Kamala Harris is my early favorite for 2020. That doesn’t mean I’m going to attack Beto supporters, Warren supporters, Biden supporters, Booker supporters, etc. . The only candidate’s supporters attacking everyone else is Bernie Sanders.
@AngryBlackLady @bpizano67 I’ve been BLOCKING the sun (get it?) all day. https://t.co/KP5klXXuuW
@gryking Trump won’t endorse Bernie outright for two reasons. 	1. What little base he has left will immediately REVOLT. 	2. It’d be a dead giveaway that they’re both backed by Putin.
@AngryBlackLady He must’ve deleted this because I can’t find it in his TL anymore.
@MarkKawate Right. Because anyone who doesn’t support Bernie must be a Republican. 	Funny how only Bernie supporters say that. I’ve yet to hear anyone else say “if you don’t support MY candidate you must be a Republican”. I wonder why? 🤔
@highndryHOUTX Totally with you there. As much as I like Biden, I’m not gonna back that train either.
@AngryBlackLady So he’s saying Bernie Sanders’ secret identity is Dr. Martin Luther King. 	#ThanosSnapYourFinger https://t.co/2NISwdqzMP
@dilemmv Actually most Dems HAVE moved on, which is why many of his 2016 supporters are OVER him. #StillNotFeelingTheBern.
@T_FisherKing @asoldiersvoice @kasie @BernieSanders A major symptom of “White Knight-itis” is an inability to talk and listen to Black people without being totally condescending, coupled with the arrogant presumption of knowing what’s best for Black people having never actually lived amongst us.
@Anootchka Or an astronomical number of followers on an account that’s barely a month old.
@girlsreallyrule @bannerite I check profiles before responding. If an account is more than two years old and the follower count is still in single digits, they get invited to the BLOCK party. (Or I may MUTE with a snarky comment.)

@KikiCharles @bradleygt89 And he’s NOT a Democrat.
@jsuipasdesleurs @andrew_braun That’s going to be one of the go-to talking points when engaging us “neo-libs”. Be ready for cries of “neo-liberal”, “shill”, “corporate Dem”, “vagina voter” (even if we support Beto), etc.. They can’t sell their guy so they have to tear down everyone else.	#NotTodaySatan

@Cmusiclover @HavokHawk @happylife09111 @SoulfulStitcher @Fdr1942 @cnnbrk Neither has he, most likely, outside of Fox News. Notice he hasn’t cited any sources.
@DrApsalar @realDonaldTrump They believe this exonerates them. They want validation for their racism and think this gives it to them.
So I guess it’s a good thing you’re NOT a journalist. https://t.co/VwMaytXlh8
@edselford @realDonaldTrump Because you voted for a RACIST. It really is that simple.
@Gmomma5boys @realDonaldTrump What? That the attack may be a hoax? I already admitted that. Try to keep up.

@AngryBlackLady @SharkFu Done and done.

@justneedavacypl @i_rocc_croccs @Eyes_Glued_Open @mexchewy @Freeyourmindkid At what point did I say AOC was dangerous, or even mention her (or CandiceO).  I merely made an observation about ADOS. 	If you can’t keep up with the conversation, you should probably just keep quiet.

@tracypac @notcapnamerica It’s all they do because it’s all they have. They can’t point to a single accomplishment for Bernie other than “he’s leading a revolution”, so they have to tear down other candidates and anyone who supports them.

@JamesRubino16 @Mikel_Jollett https://t.co/iwZqfVOCYS
@hood_cookie They believe that if it’s a hoax it will somehow exonerate #MAGA and all of the racism and hatred that’s been enabled by this administration. That’s why they’re desperately clinging to the idea.
@safetysecurity @maydaymindy9 @MichaelAvenatti Oh I’m sure that’s in her plans. She’s got the divorce papers (and the DNR order) ready.
@JohnFugelsang It’d depend on HOW I had to “make her happy. I’d seriously consider strychnine as an alternative.
@GLSCHWALL @MollyJongFast @LindseyGrahamSC I truly believe that Trump is @LindseyGrahamSC’s rebound relationship from John McCain.
@a_for2day @notcapnamerica That’s always been my theory, and the #MAGAts are mad that they didn’t make the cut.
@notcapnamerica Because he continues to whisper the sweet nothings of White victimhood in their ear, and it gets them “moist”.
@joncoopertweets @JohnLeguizamo Hate tempered with the fact that she’s about 7 years late.

@Kennymack1971 Like I always say. Jesus Christ was the only true progressive, and he died 2,019 years ago. These purity progs need to learn to settle for what they can get today.
Folks claiming the Jesse Smollett attack was a hoax because two Black men (from Nigeria, no less) couldn’t possibly be homophobic clearly haven’t been listening to Hip-Hop music over the past 30 years or so.

@tonyposnanski They are, believe me. That’s why they never use a face pic as their social media avatar.
Love how all of the #MAGA folks are saying “see, it wasn’t #MAGA because they’re Black” are blissfully ignorant of how they’re exposing their racism by implying that #MAGA is only about WHITE people.
@sbc_woke Your not even trying, are you?
@wilfrediscasti1 Right. Because we all know that there are NO BLACK Trump supporters.  #MAGA is just for the WHITE folks. 	(Wow. They don’t even see it, do they?)
@Jayc153 So what about it?  Oh, I see. This let’s all of the other gay hating racist White trash men of #MAGA off the hook. (Because clearly there are NO Trump supporting gay hating BLACK #MAGA, right?)

@Jonwayn03567652 @realAliTweets Then maybe they should avoid the interstate. It’s a know fact that driving SLOWER than the flow of traffic is MORE  likely to cause an accident than driving WITH the flow. That’s why some interstates have MINIMUM speed limits.
@JeffersonObama Or could it be they’re ashamed he’s so physically and mentally out of shape and need to paint a fantasy image of him.
@krassenstein Likely these are the same 45% who believe that same-sex marriage ruins the sanctity of marriage.
@realAliTweets People who insist on driving the speed limit on the interstate.

@MrDane1982 TBH “comfortable” was a relative term for me. I didn’t so much “come out” to my parents so much as let them figure it out on their own (which they eventually do), and by then I was in my late 20s so they didn’t really have much choice but to be ok with it.

Also, the majority of the people here illegally are here on EXPIRED VISAS. (For the intellect challenged, that means they came here LEGALLY.)
@RepMarkMeadows You people had total control of Washington for two whole years. If border control was really that important to you you’d have done it yourselves already. https://t.co/LWU7enejtp

@brucewilson @MrMurder37 @riotwomennn @OldRussetPotato The “Black Israelites” are a bunch of faux-intellectual bigots, but I’ve never seen them physically (or even verbally) confront or threaten anyone.

@Dont4get6000000 @AngryBlackLady You know I just love when people like you not only prove racism exists, but try to actually justify it.
@thomaskaine5 It’s ALWAYS been they way.  It’s just that now we have a president* who enables it in his supporters and they’ve become emboldened.

@funder @realDonaldTrump His inauguration crowd was the biggest ever. https://t.co/ytLis3i4M0
@funder @realDonaldTrump Listed alphabetically or chronologically?
This is why he’s so willing to destroy America and even those who foolishly still support him.  As with everything else, its all about HIM.  Not security, not illegal immigration, its about HIM and trying to be better than Obama...a goal that will forever be beyond his reach.
#Obamacare, while not perfect, has clearly helped many more people than not, and most Americans approve of it.  It will be the thing that most people will remember about his administration.  Trump wants to be remembered, and he sees this wall as his “legacy”.
I’ve come to realize that Trump’s wall is not just about projecting his racism to his base.  It’s also about his desire for a legacy, and his pathological jealousy of Obama.
@ProudResister @Eykis @realDonaldTrump As a Black Gay man I’m statistically far more likely to be harmed or even killed by some good ol’ all-American White boy than by any immigrant or foreign terrorist. These Trumpanzees are just afraid of being persecuted like they’ve done to everyone else.
@69heyjude @MKGenest They want the end of the world to happen. They voted for Trump to hasten the “end times” because they believe they’ll get into heaven when the rapture happens. Much like radical Islamic terrorist believe they’ll be rewarded with 72 Virgins in heaven if they die in a Jihad.
@Ione96191674 @MKGenest @Merri__Magic They’ll just blame immigrants, and Black people, and Hillary, and Obama.

@Qanadasentme And yet you’ve not disproven a single one of them. So...
@BaltoBucci @Mikel_Jollett Their ignorance and general hatred of “others” blinds them to the fact that they’re being used as pawns. As long as Trump whispers sweet nothings of racism, bigotry, and xenophobia they’ll fall on their knees worshipping him.
@MaxHoops68 @Mikel_Jollett @DebraMessing Nice whataboutism. 	You realize you’re actually admitting Trump lies when you try to justify it with examples of others doing likewise (and in one case the erroneous statement was retracted).

Looks like another unfortunate edit. They skipped the part where Jerry freaks out the dancer leaving work. #TwilightZoneMarathon
@janinefrompgh For at least the first two seasons he did cigarette promos during the trailers for upcoming episodes. #TwilightZoneMarathon
#TheDummy. IMO one of the more scary AF episodes. For me it reminds me of this movie trailer. #TwilightZoneMarathon https://t.co/uNG6gQ3IVZ
Imagine if those aliens had run into @realDonaldTrump. They’d probably destroy the Earth believing he was about to attack them with his “Space Force”. #TwilightZoneMarathon
#HocusPocusAndFrisby could easily be done today in any urban neighborhood barbershop with pretty much the same characters. #TwilightZoneMarathon
Not for anything, but if I were Marie I’d be happy to parade that arm-candy around like, “Yeah, Bitches. Suffer.”  #TwilightZoneMarathon
Aww. What a nice gangster. He let pops keep his money. #TwilightZoneMarathon
@Kiner110 By season 5 he’d pretty much disposed of the on set ciggies. #TwilightZoneMarathon
@xiaorongda Yeah. Except the models are all White. No doubt if it were done today they would be Black and the episode would be really creepy. (Hope you’re reading this, @JordanPeele.) #TwilightZoneMarathon
PS Also his real life wife passed away during taping of the episode. #TwilightZoneMarathon
#TheTradeIns is a rather IRL sad episode because the actor who played Mr. Holt (Joseph Schildkraut) died soon after it was made.  #TwilightZoneMarathon

So Comfort is saying that if the town starts gossiping about Jeff and some skank from the city, she’ll believe them.  I couldn’t have her as a girlfriend, let alone a wife. #TwilightZoneMarathon

I just wonder how Esther knew what music to put on for Gerald.  #TwilightZoneMarathon
Marge Moore is that kind of full-sized woman who’s totally ok with her weight.  Live your truth, girl.  #TwilightZoneMarathon
Can you imagine that piano in the White House?  Mueller would gather more evidence against Trump and his #GOP cronies in a day than he has in an entire year.  #TwilightZoneMarathon

This episodes a stark reminder that you should always check up on your elderly relatives on a regular basis   Make sure they’re not holed up in their basement hiding from Mr. Death. #TwilightZoneMarathon

@onlymeindc Trump is their idea of what a “real man” is. One who subjugates and dominates women into subservience. An idea probably passed down from their parents (most likely their fathers). I shudder to think what kind of boyfriends/husbands they end up with.
@IanOundo @Cubanitoray2005 @KingJames @donlemon Trump is threatened by strong Black Men and strong Women. That’s why he gravitates towards people like @DiamondandSilk and @kanyewest, and why he’s so determined to retroactively destroy @BarackObama.

@alanap98 @DearAuntCrabby @MSNBC I’ll support any DEMOCRAT running against Trump. 		Note the word DEMOCRAT. 		BERNIE. IS. NOT. A. DEMOCRAT.
@DearAuntCrabby @MSNBC Beto. But then again if you put anyone up against Sanders (other than Trump) I’d choose them as well. #StillNotFeelingTheBern

@EdKrassen Except with cheese you can cut the moldy part off and it’s still edible. Donald is more like the turd that won’t flush down the toilet.
@BravenakBlog He’s had over 25 years to “fight” for his policies. At some point one must wonder how hard (or if) he’s actually “fighting”.
@thehill Can someone point out to the @GOP that “privately” expressing dismay at @realDonaldTrump (or waiting until retirement) isn’t an act of bravery. It’s an act of cowardice.	If you people can’t stand up to him while you have skin in the game, you’re just a bunch of punk-asses.
@beemerw21 @debtwigg @StephenKing “Under the Dome” came close.
@StephenKing Unfortunately so many of the people I know who voted for Trump (thank God none of them are family) are so emotionally invested in Trump that talking to them is impossible.  They’re that die-hard 38%.
@realDonaldTrump OMG You’re serious, aren’t you? Workers going without paychecks this Christmas and it’s “poor you”. https://t.co/Mz7ILM8QgM
@marcushjohnson But, you know. Millionaires and billionaires. Right?
@HillBeverlyhill Regrets voting for him, or regrets that he hasn’t accomplished what he promised. There is a difference, and I always qualify when someone claims they’re sorry they voted for Trump.
@StevenBeschloss Criminal background checks.

@tribelaw The thing is Bernie IS NOT a DEMOCRAT. Which is why he and his magic-pony goon squad have no problem attacking other Democrats. Fortunately they are a shrinking minority (which explains why they’re attacking every other Democrat).
@CitizensFedUp https://t.co/Uie7sdHl6Z
@jlw9903 @lynnv378 They’re going to do the same thing to whomever else they see as leading the polls.  I’m waiting on the attacks on Biden since he leads St. Bernard in just about every poll I’ve seen lately.
@lynnv378 @Phillygirl1441 It’s not you.  I’m not on the Beto train either, but I won’t attack him or his supporters.  So far the only people attacking other candidates are Berners.
@raininblack @bpolitics A Black single-mom in this situation would be told to “stop freeloading off the government” and “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps”.  White folks, on the other hand, get “thoughts and prayers”.
@arracado @bpolitics Probably not. It was all about punishing the people they hate to them. They’ll just vote for Trump again if he runs in 2020, or the next guy spouting his populist racism if he doesn’t.
In other words, they got what they voted for.  https://t.co/pccOxqZ7hg

@rolandscahill I just thought of something. Wouldn’t it be hilarious if México set up the GoFundMe page themselves to get the #MAGA idiots to “pay for the wall”?
@ReasonVsFear I know that’s rather harsh. But it’s about the only way to explain why they reject younger candidates with similar platforms (even Hillary was at least a 90% match with Bernie) in favor of an old guy who’s been in DC over a quarter of a century and has very little to show for it.
@ReasonVsFear They - Bernie and Trump - are seen as the “daddy” who is going to fix their problems and forever protect and take care of them. It’s the main reason most young Bernie supporters insist on following an old White guy as their savior. Quite simply, Daddy issues.
@ReasonVsFear It’s a pernicious form of Stockholm Syndrome. They - both Trump and Bernie supporters - have been convinced that they have been, at best, forgotten by the rest of America, or at worst, the victims of some vast conspiracy that keeps them from what they feel they’re entitled to.

@sheagrimm @BravenakBlog And Jew hater. Don’t forget Jew hater.
@MrDane1982 @9kittens Over 25 years in politics and all he has done is name a couple of post offices, attach himself to everyone else’s legislation, and co-opt the ideas of others as his own. 		And that’s the stuff I can say without landing in Twitter jail.

This may be an unpopular opinion, but I’ve always had more respect for #MAGA than I ever had for Berners. At least MAGA Nation have lack of education, mental instability, and unchecked inbreeding as excuses for being deplorable. Berners like THIS are deplorable on purpose. https://t.co/jIpqmb4gNN
@pugbandit *bot*
@pugbandit I suspect this was probably a Bernie not, since it was in response to my thread about Bernie supporters.
@rudepundit Is “effluvia” the same as “Santorum”.
Heads up. I was just trolled by what was clearly a bot pretending to be a Beto supporter talking smack about Kamala. Russia is at it again trying to start some s#it. Don’t fall for it.
@MysticSepia Of course. He’s making noise to get attention because he sees many of his 2016 supporters deserting him. He needs to keep his core cultists engaged.
I dare him to say all this with Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton in the room. https://t.co/UJ1USpw5Ub
Future Bernie Sanders supporters. https://t.co/0D2zvNvW7J
@SocialPowerOne1 Can we put THEM on the other side of it?
@myserenity69 @SoCallls @FLOTUS Maybe she could just plagiarize Michelle’s memoirs.
Notice that none of them are trying to bully everyone to their POV (so far, anyway). Which is probably why most of us are still open to supporting any other candidate EXCEPT BERNIE. 		Just a bit of food for thought.
Your overtly aggressive and mean spirited tactics were a turn off in 2016, and they’re even more so now. Your attempts to bully everyone to your point of view will backfire like they did in 2016. You may want to take a lesson from Beto and other candidates’ supporters.
...vagina voter, c#nt, Jew hater, Republican, or a slave on the Democrat plantation. And because of that, I’m more than open to voting for Beto if he wins. That will NEVER happen with Bernie, and it’s mostly because of YOU.
But see, here’s the thing. I’m not going to attack or berate Beto supporters. The reason for that is so far they have not attacked or berated me. I have not by any Beto supporter been called shill, neo-liberal, corporatist, establishment...
Hey Berners.  I’m presently not a supporter of Beto for president. I like him enough, but for me it’s an experience thing and I’m drifting towards Kamala. That’s not to say I won’t change my mind in the future, but for now I’m just not there.
@DesignationSix Actually we should all just troll them with the tag #ThoughtsAndPrayers. https://t.co/MyYloKhCuO
@BravenakBlog Still not on the Beto train, but I know I won’t have to hold my nose to vote for him (or bathe in Pine-Sol after), unlike a certain 74yo grifter with the initials BS. 	#KamalaAnyoneElseButBernie2020

@AngryBlackLady I truly get the feeling she wasn’t allowed to hang with all the popular girls in High School And has resented it ever since.

@Undorkins @IJefTomI @BravenakBlog Then why do you care what we think about Bernie?
@BravenakBlog I like when the Bernie brats tweet whole entire paragraphs about how they don’t care what I think. It’s like irony is a foreign language to them.
@Ange_Amene But I thought that’s what they were looking for, the “perfect progressive”. Apparently the only politician who’s allowed to be flawed is St. Bernard.
@analyticswonk @ndrew_lawrence @AnnCoulter Well, that and gritting money from her coven.
@atDavidHoffman @AishaStaggers Didn’t you know? That’s what the Space Force is for. We’ll just build a Death Star to shoot them out of the sky.
@BravenakBlog So Dems are either too arrogant or too weak. 	You know, I’m beginning to wonder if some people just love being miserable.
Considering that it’s conservatives who have always attached the stigma to being Gay (like they do everything else), I say...KARMA. https://t.co/OJWEvpqgw3
@J_in_RVA @washingtonpost They don’t want us invading their “exclusive club” of Black conservatives. In fact, I’d even go so far as to say Black Republicans actively resent and despise the Black community. Probably because they know they’ll never be truly accepted by their new White “friends”.
@J_in_RVA @washingtonpost Furthermore, they’re not at all interested in opening up the party to other minorities. After all, if we ALL became Republicans then they wouldn’t be “special”. That’s why they use demeaning phrases like “Democrat plantation” and “political slave” to describe other Blacks.
@J_in_RVA @washingtonpost #GOP to them is a status symbol that they’re superior to the rest of Black America. That they’re good enough to hang in the “master’s” house. Sadly they fail to realize that they’re merely tokens to be exploited to other White conservatives (the “Black best friend”).
@J_in_RVA @washingtonpost I’ve always had a theory around Black Republicans. To them, their party affiliation isn’t so much about politics as it is about status. They feel they’ve “made it”, so they don’t want to hang around the rest of us “ghetto folk” still on the “Democrat plantation”...
@washingtonpost Mia, Honey. The only message Republicans have had for minorities for the past 50 years or so had been DROP DEAD. And we’ve heard it loud and clear.
@politico If he means THIS kind of “chaos”, I agree. https://t.co/8N4NZ3STeU
@SallyAlbright I know a lot of 2016 Bernie supporters who are so over him now. That’s why they’re trying to bully folks into supporting him, and trying to shut down talk about any other candidates. They know their numbers are dwindling.
@SallyAlbright But...but...BERNIE SANDERS IS THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN EVER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW I’M TYPING IN ALL CAPS. SO IT MUST BE TRUE. #snark
@BravenakBlog It’s the difference between supporters and “fans”. Supporters work hard to help your campaign. Fans are only there to soak up atmosphere. Hillary and Obama had (and still have) supporters. Bernie has “fans”.
@Brimshack @RawStory Of course she knows. Otherwise she wouldn’t be able to make money off of them.

@TruthsMinister @KevinWalsh222 @smcman100 @gingercaddy @filmpunk86 @eclecticbrotha @_waleedshahid @VanJones68 They know this (even if they can’t admit it). That’s why they feel the need to bully and shout down anyone who disagrees with them.
I haven’t committed to Beto for 2020. But the fact that Bernie Nation sees him as a threat gives him one in the plus column from me.
@chuck_meek Bernie Bros. #MAGA has the excuse of being barely educated, unsophisticated, and mentally unstable. Bernie Bros are a$$holes on purpose.
@notcapnamerica White college hipster kids are BERNIE’S base, and they’re a notoriously unreliable voting block (which is why he lost in 2016). That’s why he can’t win unless they shut down any and all talk of anyone else running.
@davidmackau @ByRyanBrooks Hey Berners. Beto thanks you for coalescing MORE support for his candidacy. 	You guys are really bad at this. 	(Speaking as someone not yet fully committed to Beto.)

@RMaryFL1 @BravenakBlog And therein lies the danger of the whole Bernie cult. The minute he’s force to capitulate to anything more than 2 centimeters to the right of what they stand for they’ll abandon him and sit out the next subsequent election. Next thing we know...President Donald Trump Jr.

@wiggligirl @marcushjohnson They just can’t fathom in their minds that anyone could possibly not like Bernie, or that he could lose against who they call “the worst candidate in history”.
@wiggligirl @marcushjohnson It’s also why they believe everything that happens to them is a part of some vast cosmic conspiracy against them, and why they continue to believe the primaries were “rigged” against Bernie.
@wiggligirl @marcushjohnson Their problem IMO is that it’s been ingrained into them at an early age that they’re “special”, that it’s all about them. That’s why they walk around with the attitude, “you need is more than we need you” when,!in reality, the reverse is true. https://t.co/BoMG28hD7b

@soledadobrien @brickladyat7 They spent two years giving him free press so they can have their man bites dog story. They’re starting to realize they bear some responsibility for his ascension, so they’re desperate to push the narrative that he’s worthy of the job to absolve themselves.

@laalex2 One other thing. I and my siblings were raised by a working mom (as I’m sure many people of my generation were). And she was every bit a part of her children’s lives as you are of yours. That utopia where moms were able to stay home with the kids only exists on 50s sitcom reruns.
@chelsanneshen @laalex2 I honestly believe the person who conceived the crock-pot was a working mother.
I’ll bet she does the vacuuming in pearls and high heels too. https://t.co/fFhA7MMxVe
@MrBlifil @laalex2 Or turning tricks in the red light district.
@laalex2 I’m not knocking stay at home moms, but this kind of self righteousness ignores all of the working moms who hold it down and can still love and spend quality time with the family. Get over yourself.
@laalex2 She forgot..	RIGHT SIDE	Completely dependent on spouse income. 	Unable to care for self/kids if spouse can’t work.	Financial prisoner. 	Vs. 	LEFT SIDE	Being to pay for her own stuff 	Can take care of herself/kids if husband can’t work.	Can leave his ass.
@MrDane1982 Glad to hear. Sure she’ll be better soon.

@mscole227 @TheRickyDavila “Trump is not fit to clean their toilets.”	If the universe was in any way fair that’s exactly what Trump would be doing.
@TheRickyDavila The fact that they can do it is just another way the Obamas show the world (and those in attendance) how they are miles above the Trumps in class.
@Dax_x98 @BernieSanders I’m going to say Yes. Then work to make sure THAT. NEVER. HAPPENS.
@Karoli @sweetnonnie @MSNBC has been the anti-Hillary channel since as far back as 2008. Their slobbering over Bernie is one of the reasons I stopped watching them.
@hoosierhackerpr Of better, why not just form your own  party?
@hoosierhackerpr If that’s the case, then why TF do you care what the rest of us think?  If your guy is “the most popular politician ever”, then why can’t y’all just support him without attacking everyone else who doesn’t?

@LeslieEscoto2 @notcapnamerica Trump can read?
@1954Astro @Cool2bCorgi @notcapnamerica @CHOCLABLOVER They could have thrown some real “silent but deadly” shade by pulling out the Purell and passing it around right after they all shook Trump’s hand.
@notcapnamerica That look like, “Yeah, I see you motherf#ckah.”

@Carlos_Thomas @OjPats4 Yeah. How ‘bout that. Maybe if they spent more time registering voters and getting them to the polls instead of trolling and attacking on social media...#BernieWouldaWon.

@notcapnamerica Watch. I’ll bet within the next week or so he’ll announce a rally in some pro-Trump area of the country where his true believers can gather and he can get his fix.
@notcapnamerica TBH I truly believe he’s suffering from a kind of “adulation withdrawal”. Notice when he’s around people who are smarter, better respected, and more liked than him, and who generally look down on him he seems aimless, unfocused, and disconnected.
@irishrygirl @LindaCollins11 I’m waiting for the magical moment when Van Jones tells us he “becomes President*”

@scurtainrod @BravenakBlog That’s pretty much the Bernie platform. “Why should we have to actually have to work to get what others have worked for?”  That’s why they’d rather co-opt the Democrat party instead of forming their own because it’d be too much like work. https://t.co/dyXGPkfG3R

@kpereau @BravenakBlog A lot of Dems that did in 2016 are over him now. People are onto him and he won’t have Hillary to kick around this time.
@POOetryman @BravenakBlog @NoBordersNoWall They always claim the primaries were rigged against him (ask them how and listen to the crickets). So they think they’re entitled to a do-over.
@BravenakBlog @NoBordersNoWall I’ve been muting Berniestans like this all weekend. I guess they’re starting to realize how many folks are “woke” to his BS and are desperately trying to convince everyone that he’s still popular.
@CHURCHLADY320 @fawfulfan I’m gonna just be honest. As long as it isn’t from the KKK, terrorist orgs, or Satan, I’m just not gonna lose sleep about where a candidate gets their money from. I just care what they’re gonna do with it, and what they plan to do when they’re in office.
@chrislongview @BravenakBlog Blue hats with the slogan “Making Never Never Land Great Again”. #MNNLGA.
@RobertaSaidThat @BravenakBlog Layer that with Trumpanzees.
@BravenakBlog That “only Bernie can save America” sounds an awful lot like “Only I can save America”. And we all know who made THAT statement.
@VoxNihi1i Your guy lost to “the worst candidate in history”. So what does that say about your “polls”?
@cheseth You realize “my girl” isn’t running, right. Time to find a new tune.
@J_in_RVA @CyborgDynamic @sardonicleftist They truly convince themselves they are the victims of some vast government level Democrat conspiracy that seeks to keep them down. They’re the stars of their own “Hunger Games”.
@CyborgDynamic @sardonicleftist @J_in_RVA Right. The primaries were rigged to give Hillary a whole 4m more votes. Yeah, ok. 	You know the DNC doesn’t run the primaries, right? They’re run by the states. 	But please. Continue with the self victimizing conspiracies.
@notcapnamerica Lost to “the most unpopular candidate in history” according to them. Go figure.

@Plzclap4jeb You really thing I’m going to take a question like this seriously from someone with the screen name of “Jeb” and with a picture of Jeb Bush in his bio?
@AimeeHypatia @TheStagmania He’s not terribly popular among men either. He has a core group of emo progs who are desperately trying to convince everyone how popular he are.
@TheStagmania I’m seeing a lot of folks on Twitter who say they were for Sanders in 2016, but not now. His toxicity and that of his “bros” seems to be a bit of a turn-off. 	Imagine that. Being a toxic a$$hole just isn’t popular.
@brianstelter Hmm. The three things Republicans are absolutely NOT about.
@DaddyDaddymac https://t.co/bR5s8eMuId

@word_34 @isteintraum Every White male Republican in Congress 	...and Bernie Sanders.
@Michael26826508 Like Trump, Bernie doesn’t care how his supporters act towards others. As long as they worship and edify his name, he’s cool with them being obnoxious asses.
@Ghostfan19 Great for you. Congratulations.

@Marjee123 @msleen1970 @DeniseMMurray https://t.co/BZ7PAZWBaw
@mattsharpe74 If Bernie is so popular, why don’t you just go ahead and form your own party?	Of course you’d have to build coalitions, establish an infrastructure, adopt a platform, raise money, get endorsements...	In other words...you’d have to do WORK. 	(Guess I answered my own question.)
@NancyLineJacobs https://t.co/Aik3IebgHR

@PassTheSalty @code_name_v Whatever I may think about Santa Claus, I believe that’s the parents’ job and she overstepped. If she’s really wanted to enlighten someone, she should sit down with Megyn Kelly.
@slattfri Bernie is my absolute last resort if it comes down to a choice between him and Trump (or any Republican). IMO he couldn’t possibly be worse (nor could Homer Simpson, for that matter).
@Anootchka @RedRick1917 @HennyGcup @adamcbest I always wonder what these anti-capitalist folks do for the holidays. Do they go out and chop down their own tree (and with what, since  they’d have to pay for the axe)? Do they give home made gifts? And come Christmas time do they just have a lick off the same turkey leg?
@adamcbest @shivabeach But no one can wag their finger like Bernie. 		I mean, just look at how he wags that thing. 		So sexy...		So sexy...		#snark https://t.co/xcbxdGajzm
@C_Hateley @UndeadZaroc Probably because Clinton and Bernie voted the same 98% of the time they were in the senate together, and their overall policies practically mirror each other (most of them originating with Hillary). Bernie just makes unrealistic promises that his supporters blindly fall for.
@Smokey_pawsback For tweets like this I ask myself 3  things...		Is it worth my time to respond?	Do I really feel like smacking them down?	What kind of mood am I in? 		Fortunately for you I’m in a good mood, I really can’t with you right now, and I’ve already wasted more time than you’re worth.
@savinggrace1969 @notcapnamerica You know it.

@chrislongview @notcapnamerica IKR. The main reason I stopped posting over at DKos was because it became Bernie-central in 2016.

@marcushjohnson Of course they do. Otherwise they’d have to admit that Sanders was a dick of a candidate whom no one liked but them.
Louder for the Berniestans in the back! 📢📣🔈🔊 https://t.co/aj2MMdAUf0
@CyborgDynamic @J_in_RVA Funny how everyone but Bernie is a corporate shill. Is that really going to be your argument for the next two years?  “Bernie Sanders is the only true progressive.”
@J_in_RVA @CyborgDynamic Absolutely. And just to show the children how adults act, if by some quirk of the cosmos Bernie actually gets the nomination (he won’t) and the choice comes down to him or Trump, I’ll even hold my nose and vote for Bernie.
@BarbaraLNewsome And how many candidates has YOUR party elected?  	Oh, right. I forgot. YOU HAVE NO PARTY!
@huskiefan_geer @islandsoulqn Honestly I don’t want Hillary to run again either (not that I wouldn’t support her if she did). As far as I’m concerned, America had its chance and blew it. She should just kick back and enjoy her family.
@IJefTomI @MrDane1982 That’s what so many are afraid of, and why so many support Trump (and to a lesser degree, Bernie)
@deaf258 @RijuColonDee Says one who supports the guy who’s NOT a Democrat. 		And it’s “pimping” BTW. (Funny how proofreading works.)
@_NotFakeNews_ @Fleurdelisazure Actually they’d be arrested on suspicion of terrorism and sent to Gitmo.

@SpookyAlienClod I’m sure all 4 of your followers agree with you.
Still finding it hilarious that the people who support the guy who isn’t a Democrat - and refuses to become one - call anyone who doesn’t support him a Republican. 	Their grasp of irony is roughly on par with that of your average Trump supporter. https://t.co/yj02Q83GXR
@CindiPargressiv Since you’ve pretty much already decided you’re not going to vote for any candidate that doesn’t have “100% Pure Progressive” seal of approval from Bernie Sanders, why should anyone waste time kissing your asses just to satisfy your sense of self importance?
@BravenakBlog That would be bad news for Starbucks, as his followers would have to dip into their latte cash.
@portersure @debiowens IMO it’s more like when after a night of what you thought was unbridled passion you wake up to an empty bed and $200 on your night table. And now all the boys are dragging you behind your back. https://t.co/lpQIkftJQD
@lisapoet @BloodshotEyes1 @bigmihart You’d think he and his followers would do that. But then that would mean things like building coalitions, adopting a party platform, raising money, organizing...you know, actual WORK (and time).
@Austin316ths Ok. So far because I don’t like Bernie I’m...	A Jew hater	A Republican 	A corporate shill	A Hill-bot	I don’t want healthcare of for kids to go to college 	I want poor people to die. 		Maybe we can create a hat for the Berners saying “make fairytales come true again”.
@MarkAndrewSmith Right. Because only the purest of the pure progressives are allowed to have any opinion at all, and then they must be “Bernie approved”. 	I wonder if you people really know how you sound anymore, or if you’re just totally ok with sounding like the barely educated #MAGAts.
@doc_next @Red3Biggs @anypigslft @schmackelstan @KaiserinKai Didn’t he say his wife lost them, or something like that.
@Liebchen59 Exactly how is merely answering a question and expressing an opinion “interfering” with your right to vote for your candidate?		Triggered much?
@NR_Garrett I refuse to call myself progressive for just that reason. I prefer the term “pragmatic (I.e. sane) liberal”.
@EDub56 Dude. You really think I’m going to be a millionaire someday?  And just what lottery ticket is going to make that happen?
@ArthurManfredJr 😭😭😭😖😖😖 Oh boo hoo!  Another nameless faceless social media avatar I’ll never meet says he doesn’t like me. What ever will I do? 	(In case you don’t recognize it, that’s sarcasm.) https://t.co/z0gSHLt592
@qedigiv Apparently to them Women age 3 years for every year a man ages.

@mtomsic4 @ourprogressive Yeah. They do that. You’re not a true “progressive” if you don’t believe that all rich people are evil, or that the way to end racism is to make everyone rich and throw all the evil greedy bankers in jail.
@mtomsic4 @hatt1 @ourprogressive I hate Donald Trump with the passion of 1000 white hot suns. But I’ll never hate on him for being rich.
@mtomsic4 @hatt1 @ourprogressive I’ve never bought into the idea that the 1% are somehow “evil”, or that they’re somehow obligated to make some grand altruistic gesture with their money for the rest of us.
@bowiegrrl11 @leftyjennyc He’ll just blame us “low information” POC voters for not being smart enough to accept him as our White Knight.
@leftyjennyc Can’t wait for that to happen... https://t.co/uiwFBP929L
I’m going to propose an early Nwe Year’s resolution. Can we STOP speculation on the next Mueller “blockbuster” indictment until it actually happens? https://t.co/iPbLLtBFR1
@goldengateblond @bertbech Somehow I’m thinking this was written by a WHITE person (probably male).
@zippyhorsemom @Brasilmagic An episode of “Adam Ruins Everything” (@truTV) explains this beautifully. How once people become married to an idea, presenting them with facts that counter that idea can feel like a physical attack to them.
@Brasilmagic https://t.co/R0r0rDSZsl
@leftyjennyc Harry Potter.
@mzgee41 @socalledsaul @ForecasterEnten Because he has no financial infrastructure or coalition of his own. Like his followers, he wants all of the benefits, but doesn’t want to do any of the work. (Aka free stuff)
@2gatorindo I like many of Bernie ideas. I just don’t think someone who seems to go out of his way to alienate Women and minorities, and dismisses our issues as “distractions” is the right person to put forth those ideas.
@hexidecima @Dingodog @NickPisca @KamalaHarris @GOP Not just a woman. Black candidates, POC, any candidate under 50 it seems. It always struck me as strange that this “hip”, “new” voting block of “young” voters is so quick to throw their lot behind yet another old White male.
@shenanigatyr @chbacon @SpectatorUSA What part of BERNIE IS NOT DEMOCRAT are you people just not clear on?
@dudleypj @jjdebenedictis Because media needs their “man bites dog” story. BS could die tomorrow and they’d still claim that he should be the “front runner”. Eyeballs and mouse-clicks.
@Shizzletheland The one who believes all Black people are poor?	The one who says White people feel uncomfortable voting for Black candidates?	The one who calls issues affecting POC a “distraction”? 	The one who seems neurotically obsessed with rural White voters?		Sorry. But that’s YOUR guy.
@PemaYongchen @mannyvu89 @SneakyMaus @zelduh @GrayShadowTech Trying to have an intelligent conversation with Berners is a migraine trigger for me. Beyond just throwing some shade their way, I usually just mute them.
@anarchotokonoko I support people who ARE Democrats. You support the guy who ISN’T. 		But I sound like a Republican. Ok.
For all of you who keep asking “Why don’t you like Bernie... https://t.co/dK5i8EN6Lq
@reesetheone1 It doesn’t matter. To the Berners he will always be the victim of some vast DNC conspiracy to deny him the presidency to which he was entitled.
@socalledsaul @ForecasterEnten Except he’s not a Democrat. But yeah to all the rest.
@subrochick What’s even funnier is I’m being accused of being Republican by people who support a guy who isn’t even a Democrat.
From the guy calling himself Putin Bot... https://t.co/HnGYAHnINf
@JFKramarz You know Hillary isn’t running, right?
@NoParty2020 Here’s the thing. I don’t dislike Bernie’s policies. I dislike Bernie. There are plenty of other actual Democrats who share the same vision, and will actually work to accomplish them. I support REAL Democrats. Not haters who only use the party for their own ends.
@uResist Except evidently it does to you, since you feel the need to convince me how popular he is.
@anypigslft @doc_next @KaiserinKai @schmackelstan I’ve been blocking and muting all weekend. It’s like they’re I’ve blasphemed against their savior.
@nlvalcke @Rave_Dubin I’m just amazed at how four little words - WE DONT LIKE BERNIE - can get them so riled up. As if they just can’t fathom how anyone could possibly not like him.
@Selendrile @jealmazan24 Get back to me when you figure a way for that to happen that doesn’t involve pixie dust. https://t.co/870y2xJZKH
@nlvalcke @Rave_Dubin Don’t you know? Hillary and the DNC rigged all of the primaries with their insidious establishment funded mind control Ray. #snark.
@notlikenormal I just love throwing that line they used against Hillary back at them. “I have nothing against a crotchety senile old man for President, I just don’t want THAT crotchety senile old man.”
@Trayofbees I’d that going to be your answer to everyone who doesn’t support Bernie Sanders? “You want to kill poor people.” 	I support ACTUAL Democrats who DON’T spend time trashing the party and its voters, or make magic pony promises they have no idea how to keep.
@katiecannon2 @KaiserinKai @anypigslft @schmackelstan You’re right. I’m NOT. And proud of it. https://t.co/WUUsvElfkI
@GeeLedger How about more funding for inner city schools and better pay for teachers so those low income kids can actually get into the “free college”.	Strangely enough I hadn’t heard THAT proposal from St. Bernard.
@KaiserinKai @anypigslft @schmackelstan Don’t you just love how those of us who choose to support ACTUAL DEMOCRATS with realistic plans are accused of being REPUBLICANS by people who support a guy who routinely trashes DEMOCRATS and refuses to become one.
@stucam7771 Except for HIS... https://t.co/Kv7NgigYI5
@cal5k @litbrit @SenSanders This is the thing that gets me about Thea so-called “Sanders independents”. They’ve all indicated they won’t support anyone more than .5 inches to the right of Bernie, but expect the rest of us to kiss their asses for their support.
Thank you. https://t.co/F2SBgZpf2n
@huggybuddy1 @msEMcB @chbacon @SpectatorUSA And yet look how easy it was to trigger rose twitter with four little words...	WE. DONT. LIKE. BERNIE. 		Yeah, I’m the one with the man-crush.
@Splatypus76 @chbacon @SpectatorUSA His registration. He’s an INDEPENDENT officially.
@johngromada Plus his personality seems as volatile as Trump’s. We don’t need a lefty version of #MAGA.
@johngromada If Bernie won the Democrat nomination I absolutely WOULD vote for him, just as I did Obama in 2008 even though I was for Hillary in the primaries. 	I have nothing against Sanders’ ideas. I simply believe he’s not interested in working with people he would need to move his agenda.
@elainelayabout @chbacon @SpectatorUSA But I thought voting the Dem line was BAD. 	I mean, you can’t complain about how “corrupt” the dem party is, while at the same time complain whenever anyone points out that Bernie isn’t a Democrat. Pick a line and stick to it.
@nic47jd There are plenty of better candidates, with REALISTIC policy positions and who can actually explain how to accomplish them.
@Faerywolf Still see u.
@_memorable2 And yet I still see your post. So...
@BlueneckfromPH Translation: “Be nice to us and kiss our asses or we’ll vote for Trump...again.”
“YOU’RE BEING DIVISIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL. YOU’RE DIVIDING THE PARTY. WHAT ABOUT UNITY.” - All the angry pro-Bernie responses to a post they could have easily ignored, from a 52 year old Black man they don’t even know and whose opinion they say they care nothing about.
@CLIFFORDBIFF You angry Bernie supporters are dividing yourselves. All I did was post a tweet which you could have easily ignored. https://t.co/2uByDjgFYo
@TrueTanker You realize you’re pretty much admitting to being a “Bernie bro”, right?
@ShinGokaiRed Right. That’s why there are so many angry Berners responding to this thread. Because I can’t let go. https://t.co/hV6CUyUZRr
@juliejunket @bdaruna Most of these low follow accounts are bots that are triggered whenever an anti-Trump or anti-Bernie post gets over a certain number of like minded responses. Their purpose is simply to overwhelm the thread with negative responses and shut it down.
@readtoomuch OMG. A nameless faceless person I don’t know and will never meet says she doesn’t like me. My life is so over. What ever will I do? I’m sure there’s a support group for people like me. Maybe I should just end it all now. 		Nah. I think I’ll be ok.
@msEMcB @chbacon @SpectatorUSA Once again for those of you challenged in reading comprehension. BERNIE. SANDERS. IS. LITERALLY. NOT. A. DEMOCRAT.

@shielapul If you want to get into a debate with me, look me up when you’re in the Baltimore area and we can do so in person. I don’t “debate” via social media because I’m an adult with better things to do than argue with an avatar.
@jmartinez_1231 So much reaction to words on a screen from someone you’ll never meet. I suggest you re-evaluate some things.
@tobybuckwyler #ShitLibs? Really?  	Ever notice how the #BernieBros and the #MAGAts sound exactly the same?  And then they wonder why we reject them.
@hollis517 You could have stayed out of “we” by simply not responding and ignoring the post. Blocking and muting works too. Needy much?
@Truthbe44018911 @TheArchitectLDK @SenSanders THIS right here is my problem with Bernie supporters.  WE’RE supposed to listen to HIM and “give him a chance” (which we’ve done), yet none of you will even consider any candidate, idea, or platform more than 1.5” to the right of St. Bernard because of your precious purity. https://t.co/fLD4ghYHFo
@jclabaugh1 A lot of people love cheese puffs.  That doesn’t mean they should be the nominee.
@Jernzyjean SELFHINESS?  	Really if you’re going to try and be clever, learn to SPELL.
@mls617983 @caro_indacity @indigoace I guess they don’t consider the BLACK President we elected in 2008 and 2012 a Democrat because he didn’t give them their magic pony they wanted (single payer health care).
@kurtwonderstone If you were really interested in me purging you, you would have done it yourself.  I mean, your Block/Mute functions do work, don’t they?
@bamothertrucker You mean the Russian propaganda that led Bernie supporters to believe that HRC was just short of Satan’s concubine?  THAT Russian propaganda?
@fritchee @RicardoRiveraNJ @carogonza @DNC Yeah.  Most of the pro-Bernie responses are.  I’ve just been sharpening my wit with some of them, then muting them.
@Daniel__Why Funny how “unity” to you folks always seems to boil down to “support OUR candidate or lose”. https://t.co/VFavFV17iX
@thegnc @patronusisotter If the two of you actually bothered to read the verse and comprehend it, you’d understand the gist.  It basically means don’t argue with idiots.  Hence I’m putting you on mute.
@BadMamaJamaKris Actually you could have simply blocked me. The fact that you wasted so much time on such a verbose tweet says a lot more about your emotional state than it does mine. “Emotionally needy” would be my assessment.
@TheeLoganC Um. On what fantasy planet is the Democrat party Sanders’ party?		People like you are the reason some states resist legalizing weed for recreational use.
@randalgraves79 It’s mighty “not-reading-the-whole-thing” of you to not note that...	1. I was speaking of Bernie supporters. 	2. I said 2/3, not ALL. 		But go ahead and do the victim thing. It suits you.
@wendeelue And if all of those crowds actually voted perhaps there’d be something to this whole #BernieWouldaWon nonsense you people insist on clinging to.
All these 2 and 3 digit follower count accounts trying to convince me how popular Bernie is. #smdh. https://t.co/1NXpPPZUsx
@letyofrogrow @DustBowlBlue Yeah. He only took about half the corporate donations Hillary has, and voted WITH her over 90% of the time. But hey, play the ultra progressive social justice warrior if it makes you feel like your saving the world.
@MisterRenewable “Nobody gives two shits about your opinion anyway...”		So far... 	1,200+ responses	1,200+ RTs	6,800+ likes		BTW. How nice of you to take the time to tweet about how no one cares about my opinion.
@RobbDawson4 Tell that to the Bernie supporters who spent all of 2016 and the subsequent years since doing exactly THAT!
@GrenHennis You do understand that the Block and Mute functions are available, right.
@adesantisb Um...no I shouldn’t. Because I don’t. So... https://t.co/TFImYxaVPP

@Lennyash Yes. I am. As always. So who are you?
@jerrycannon5 Yak dung is better than anyone from the #GOP. I’m not gonna support it for president.
@HereinOhio And millions more DON’T. Which is kinda why he LOST in 2016.
@polidan_sharon @judoplyr Yeah. That was it. Move the party left. Yeah, ok. https://t.co/wU4ts1je9S
@Swikky He’s just your garden variety Vermont millionaire who’s worked in the senate for 20 years and has taken corporate donations. 	But yeah. You go with that “not a corporate shill” line?
@MikeDeVillaer Elites like Bernie Sanders?  Oh, right. He’s NOT a Democrat. He’s only a 70+ year old White guy who’s worked in DC for over 20 years, takes corporate campaign donations, and just happens to also be a millionaire. 	But he’s not a Democrat. So there’s that.
@Redpolkadot58 Good for you. https://t.co/mwQ1D6T7XI
@moscaron @tazarae20 But he should be the front runner. Tell me again how that works?
@OG_JOHNSON84 @DNC A new wave of the most notoriously unreliable voting block in America. Which means he’ll do about as well in 2020 as he did in 2016.
@DavidStLouis14 Tell me. Where is the magical island you all come from where all of this happened?
@AlexisG141Opz Then you do you, Sweetie. And stay out of grown folks business.
To you Berners calling for unity and saying we’re being “divisive” for not liking Bernie. Where was the “unity” in 2016 when 2/3 of you were too butt hurt to vote for Hillary in the general? If you’re still all “Bernie would’ve won” you don’t get to say shit about unity. https://t.co/gGqNfw9X7C
@DamagedHells2 As opposed to a noun, a verb, and “millionaires and billionaires”.
@msbeakmom @sdgold60 @SenSanders I’d actually take you seriously if you spelled her name right.
@MasterBasstard @Jenfeds73 “Helped get passed” as in signing on to laws written by others. You know, like most first year senators except he’s been t in the senate for over 20 years. Try again.
@Arete77 Funny how Trump bots and Bernie bots sound so much alike. It’s almost like they were programmed in the same country. Eh, comrade?
@MartiONtheHill I’m sure some 2000 years ago they said the same thing about Jesus. Except in His case it was actually true.
@ellsburysfans @ResisterMr Geez, people. HE LOST! Get over it. https://t.co/bMyva9wfPi
@HelenSavage @indigoace So you’re ok with someone outside the party determining who our party leaders should be. 	I suppose you’re also ok with tyrants outside our country determining who our president should be.
@Rustypfa I would. But then you wouldn’t see THIS. So I’ll MUTE you instead. https://t.co/2H5VSaTnQB
@LtComdrData Because they’re bots. They’re programmed on a loop to block the fact he’s not a Democrat.
@ParkerW55912092 You people consider anyone who makes more than 6 figures more than you “corporate”. News flash. Bernie took (and takes) money from corporations just like everyone else. He’s been in the senate for over 20 years, and he’s a MILLIONAIRE. 		Gee. That sounds rather CORPORATE to me.
@lindalp111 Except that HE LITTERALLY IS NOT A DEMOCRAT.
@loveylovett @JonPoillon @HillaryClinton He can “angle” all he wants. He will not get my support for 2020.

@HutchLeah If it ain’t YOU, you don’t need to worry about it.
@KeepinUpWithCDJ @oneunionmom @karinchu And sabotaging the party when he loses.
@MysteryCr8tve @KingNoNose @nailsthatglow Plus they also know how to build a coalition of support. Something the “participation trophy” generation in this country don’t seem to understand.
@TheArchitectLDK Or you can just grow TF up and accept that not everyone loves your savior for whatever reason and move on.
@StephenPJohnso3 @tazarae20 Or I simply don’t like Bernie PERIOD. It’s really not that complicated.
@KLyman67 You and your 16 year old are free to like who you want. I don’t like him. Try not to act like a two year old and just accept it.
@gusytots Well it’s like this. I don’t like guacamole. Now I won’t explain WHY I don’t like guacamole, just like I won’t explain why I don’t like Bernie Sanders or how the two are related. BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE TO.
@Valkyrie2P Right. It was the DNCs job to explain to a man who spent 20+ years as a senator how the democratic primaries process works. https://t.co/DFrb3UYS2d
@FRDMFGHTRS Bernie was in the Senate for over 20 years. His window for the presidency closed A LONG TIME AGO. He needs to take a seat (and so do  his supporters). https://t.co/D6MsxQAOO9
@davidtkhayes Perhaps if he registered and ran AS. A. DEMOCRATS instead of trashing everyone who supports them...
@carpepax It’s TWITTER. Not the Yalta Conference. Get a life.
Dear Bernie supporters. We get that some of you support Bernie because you want free stuff and to work out your daddy issues. But the rest of us simply DO NOT LIKE HIM, and we’re tired of explaining WHY to you. Just accept it, deal with it, and move on. https://t.co/hI4sufZrrV

@rawideasinc @beckysterne Huh. 	Seriously. Do they even bother to program you bots with understandable English?
@franksparaco @RitaJ2011 Like he won the 2016 primaries...oh wait. HE DIDN’T.
@GenericMike5885 Yeah. But toddlers can’t vote, so...
@WalkerStorage @davidtkhayes Maybe come up with a viable 3rd party... https://t.co/vMSNcpHZye
@LibbyLane10 Of course he fails to mention (and his supporters fail to realize) that he himself IS a member of that 1%.

You know, if the Bush family really want @realDonaldTrump to stay away from poppy’s funeral, they could just plan it on a day there’s a high chance of rain. He can’t work an umbrella, and we know he’s not supposed to get the gremlin he wears on his head wet. #MAGA https://t.co/muScfqFIEz

@spiraldancer2 @TopRopeTravis That not too far from the truth, as I’m sure Trump is the “bottom” in that relationship.
@Newsericks @TopRopeTravis @realDonaldTrump Simple. America being humiliated on the world stage by a Kremlin puppet “makes liberals cry”. So they’re ok with it.
@TopRopeTravis Probably for the best that there’s no press allowed. I mean, do we really want to see Donald give Big Daddy Vlad his monthly Blow Job?

@quinndmitchell @djrothkopf I willing to put money on it that they’ll have him assassinated once he’s out of office. 	Do you honestly think secret service will take a bullet for him?
@djrothkopf The thing is his cult of Trumpanzees don’t care about how the rest of the world sees America, as long as they get “their country back”. (That is, the conservative fantasy utopia that’s only ever existed in 50’s TV sitcoms.)
@RawStory I’ll ask this once more.	Trump?
@JoyAnnReid I’m actually certain we’re going to catch a hot-mic of Putin ordering Trump, “Come here, Boy!”
@Unpersuaded112 The military may not take his orders, but he’s got enough mentally unstable gun nuts who are willing to answer his call, and even die for him, to wreak havoc when he’s finally forced out.

@essenviews That being said, if they did and were truly repentant about it, I’d consider forgiveness. But it would be a long time before they’d ever have my trust again, if ever.

@windycityhomo @MrDane1982 @BetoORourke Likeability is one thing. Show me that he’s the righ man for the job, on his own merits, and I’ll happily support him. Start selling him as some savior (hear that, Berners) and I’m moving in the other direction.

@Rosie The 60 year old #GOP strategy of instilling fear of “otherness” in their supporters, inspiring th to vote against their own interests, thus ultimately resulting in TRUMP.
@stucam7771 @kmorga1 They’d rather live in poverty than see anyone else gain more than them.
@stucam7771 @kmorga1 It’s a zero sum game with them. They truly believe that for someone else to succeed, it must come at their expense. So they’ll happily vote and work against their own best interests to keep from having to “give up” anything.
@stucam7771 @kmorga1 Remember. This “significant minority” literally went to war against their own government to maintain the right to enslave other human beings. And when a Democrat president signed civil rights into law, this “significant minority” left the party en-masse in protest.
@stucam7771 @kmorga1 Just look at history and you’ll note that this “significant minority” (aka White conservatives) have never been inclined to do right by any outside group if it is perceived that said group might benefit at their expense.

@ParkerMolloy If someone says Merry Christmas to me, I smile, thank them for their well wishes, and wish them the same.  PERIOD.  Likewise if they say Happy Holidays.
@ParkerMolloy I generally say “Happy Holidays” because, having friends who worship differently than me, I recognize that not everyone celebrates Christmas.  And I’ve yet to have anyone, Muslim, Jewish, or Athiest, go Linda Blair Exorcist when I occasionally send a “Merry Christmas” their way.
@ParkerMolloy Fake politi-Christians have turned their own beloved holiday (which is rooted in secularism, BTW) into a political tool just to “own the libs”, as if we’d have any problem at all if someone says “Merry Christmas”.

@JackKingston 1. Fewer people are on food stamps because they’ve been CUT OFF. 	2. Unemployment across the board has been trending downward for the past several years. 	3. THERE HAVE ALWAYS been more jobs than workers.  PERIOD. 		But your guy plays golf, so there’s that.

My admiration for this woman just increased x1000. https://t.co/tl6UawnHX4
@FINALLEVEL @missb62 That’s why you do screen grabs.  So their shame will live forever.
...it will finally dawn on him just how empty his life has been.  How worthless, and utterly useless he has been as a man, and it will be too much for him to live with.		Like I said, you could ALMOST feel sorry for him.  But with someone like @realDonaldTrump, not quite. &lt;end&gt;
...he’ll commit suicide.  Yes, that’s the word...SUICIDE.  Because when he no longer even has the adulation of his mindless cult lemmings, when his sycophants have no more use for him, when he’s left with a wife who loathes him, and children who are waiting for him to die...
What I’m going to say next is going to sound heartless, so I’ll apologize in advance.  But I suspect, in fact I’m willing to put money on it, that within two years of @realDonaldTrump leaving office, either via resignation, being voted out, or God forbid, finishing a 2nd term...
This is why he rages against BOTH Democrats AND Republicans who stand up to him.  Because he’s a bully who cowers in the face of anything he can’t intimidate to his will.
This is why he rages at the press, because they don’t give him the respect to which he feels entitled, and desperately craves.  This is why he rages against Obama, because Obama has what he never will.  This is why he rages against 2/3 of the country, for not validating him.
Frankly, he RESENTS these people.  This isn’t what he wants.  It’s merely a fix to get him through his next crisis of inadequacy.  He takes it the way a crack-fiend takes a hit off the pipe.  It feels good for the moment, but soon after he’s left feeling empty and lonely.
You know what I think irks him most?  It’s the knowledge that the only people who’ll ever “love” him are the barely educated mindless rubes who attend his rallies.  People who he otherwise wouldn’t give the time of day.
Hell, he’ll never receive the respect W Bush has.  When you can even clear THAT bar, you are truly pathetic.
An even a monumental achievement like becoming POTUS (with help 😉) doesn’t earn him the respect he so obsessively craves.  This is why the Obamas pretty much occupy a rent-free luxury suite in his head.  He knows that he will never achieve the world-wide respect that O has.
Instead, they see him as the rest of us do.  A crass, classless, unsophisticated buffoon who can only use his wealth to destroy rather than to create.  They see him as unworthy and beneath them.
This is a pattern that has continued throughout his entire life.  He inherited his riches, so he feels entitled to respect from other people of wealth...Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, other captains of industry whom he desperately wants to see him as their equal.
This is a man who has never received respect from the people who are most important to him, namely his parents.  And growing up, he’s probably never received respect from teachers, other children, other family.  Honestly, I suspect he was bullied as a child...mercilessly.
You know, I’ve come to realize something about @realDonaldTrump.  Something which could almost make one feel sorry for the guy (almost, I said).  Donald Trump is a truly sad, pathetic man.  Really, he is. https://t.co/zAaHLKPOCo

@tinamichelehaze @smaqcksaidso @VettingBernie @thedailybeast @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum @staceyabrams @SenSanders Exactly.

@NoTweetSaker @JenniferADevon @supertaschablue @thedailybeast @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum @staceyabrams @SenSanders He wasn’t calling them out. He was excusing them and trying to rationalize.

@AmandaMarcotte I used to try and engage, then I just started muting them. Nowadays I block them outright. They’ll say it’s because we can’t stand up to “the truth” (aka THEIR truth), but the fact is they’re simply unworthy of the energy it takes to argu with them. 		Proverbs 26:4.

Y’all are feeling some kinda way about the pumpkin pie thing. Truth is not many Black folks (that I know) are really into PP. The general preference is sweet potato pie. (Conversely, not many Black folks I know are into sweet potato fries either.) #ThanksgivingWithBlackFamilies
This is truly the thing. We’ll be up all night chopping, slicing, mixing, and preparing, put the turkey in the oven midnight the night before, get up at 5am to take it out, and after all that...we STILL end up not eating until at least 8pm. #ThanksgivingWithBlackFamilies
@Kennymack1971 No more excuses, White America. Trump epitomizes the hateful racist disease that has infected America since the beginning. If you’re with him...YOU. ARE. A. RACIST. and will be scorned as such. #WalkAwayFromMAGA

To White people who’ll be having  #ThanksgivingWithBlackFamilies. The following are FORBIDDEN at the Black Thanksgiving:	Stove Top stuffing	Kraft Mac and Cheese	Raisins in the potato salad (or the stuffing)	Pumpkin pie	Cranberry sauce not from the can	Pleas act accordingly.

@peterdaou Some people say Graham became this way when McCain died. I believe he was always this way and McCain’s death gave him the go-ahead to let his conservative freak-flag fly high. Like a widow who decides to start dating again right after the funeral.
@bemuir_ronkon79 @cameraman1961 @notcapnamerica @grandoftwo That also explains why they are so easily manipulated into voting against their own interests.

@glenn87027633 @9kittens They just can’t stand the idea that anyone is happy while they’re miserable.
@glenn87027633 @9kittens That’s pretty much par for Trumpanzees. They’re so filled with hatred and resentment that they’ll gladly suffer whatever happens as long as the people they hate suffer as well.
NBC station fires reporter for wearing MAGA hat while covering Trump rally https://t.co/6FshSVmAwM
@CharlesMBlow I shudder to think what they’ll do to undermine it. There are still plenty of spaces where #LGBT discrimination is legal.
@KevinMKruse Yeah. That seems to be the evolving excuse among Trumpanzees. “Those liberals were mean to me. So I’m going to vote for the racist admitted sexual predator so he can nominate sexual predator to the #SCOTUS. That’ll fix ‘em.”
@realDonaldTrump Why do you always assume people are being paid to protest you?  Is it because paying people is the only way YOU can get them to show you any kind of affection (or sleep with you)? https://t.co/ROMdSepcAm
@TopherSpiro @ArrogantDemon It’s a “conscience speech”. She’s really trying to rationalize her vote to herself. Like her fellow Republicans, she still needs to believe she’s a “good person”, and all those other “bad Democrats “ are just picking on her.
@pbtips @BravenakBlog Usually it’s said by people like Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, and highly paid (and usually WHITE) political pundits from the comfort and safety of their nice cushy luxury condos.
@Minuteman04 I’m about to make a major move to Baltimore for a new job. I could really use that Soros check right now (among with one of those Obamaphones).
@BravenakBlog But you know, “We just can’t be against Trump, we need something to vote FOR.”		How about being FOR NOT having a President* and a party that has dedicated itself to the destruction of our democracy.
@BravenakBlog And worse yet they’re trying to say it’s because Black folk didn’t vote enough to counter THEM not voting.
@BravenakBlog https://t.co/2OTttNt0Ql
@TheyWereStolen KILL BILL! comes to mind.
@GameKween @iamroxxyhaze That’s because White people in America never really see themselves as racist, but as victimized by the targets of their racism.
@RudyGiuliani The “shame” here is this “investigation” was a complete farce whose true intent was to give fence sitting Republicans needed cover to vote as they had always intended. There was never any interest in the TRUTH. #WeSeeYou.
@peterdaou YES. IT. IS.

@mohamad_cheri @PatriciaBuress @KimmiAnne77 @krassenstein @datblaxican @julieorth2 @Nike So does that mean #MAGA Nation will all be crashing their Ford trucks into brick walls in protest? https://t.co/ihTXvlB9tA

@BravenakBlog The funny thing is the people always calling for the “fresh faces” are willing to throw their lot behind a 77yo White guy who’s been in the senate for over 20 years. Go figure.

@MrDane1982 He doesn’t care. He’s a straight White Male so none of this affects him personally. Typical Bernie Bro.
Retweeting for two reasons. 	1. Beautiful and very relevant message. 	2. It triggers the hell out of #MAGA Nation. https://t.co/d4BjGQeTAA
@MrDane1982 Yeah. But they’re all establishment corporatist shills. #snark #sarcasm.

@Kennymack1971 Read it and the author does sounds like someone trying to save themselves from consequences when this administration finally goes down. Kinda like the Nazi soldiers in Valkyrie.
Is it just me, or is anyone else wondering if perhaps Lindsey Graham may have wrote this?  I mean, maybe his sudden ass-kissing of Trump would be the perfect cover.  https://t.co/bCfqbRk0Nb

@JCTheResistance @MatthewWolfff @JennyWilsonUT You know what they say about a broken clock...
Buying Chick-Fil-A to protest LGBT. 	Buying Starbucks to protest the “War on Christmas”. 	Smashing Kerugs to protest for Sean Hannity. 	Burning Nikes to protest against Colin Kaepernick. 		Pro-tip for #MAGA Dumbasses. Protests are supposed to cost THE OTHER GUY $$$.
Watch this whole thing BEFORE commenting. Genius. https://t.co/nOare7Ughf
@BravenakBlog I hear it was along the Via Crucis (Stations of the Cross).
@GryphonWerks @coleyworld They’re pretty used to “dry-humping”. It’s the only action most of them get with anyone who’s not a relative.
@CoaleAmy @coleyworld Even if I didn’t like their campaign. Let a kid of mine burn a $200.00 pair of sneakers I paid for. EPIC wouldn’t begin to describe the ass-whooping they’d get from me.
@reebytalk @coleyworld They’ll smash their Kerugs and buy Starbucks and call it “protest”. Companies should piss #MAGA Nation off more often.
@TheGoodGodAbove “Look at me. I’m burning my $200.00 pair of sneakers to protest a football player who doesn’t give a s#it what I think. Yeah, I really owned those libs, didn’t I?”
@coleyworld These are the same people who’ll buy a Starbucks coffee and say their name is Merry Christmas to make them write it on the cup in protest against the “War on Christmas”. 		These people really don’t get protesting, do they?
Name them and shame them. IT WORKS.  https://t.co/uXCE3j2Jcl
@CarlosM61269234 @glisten_777 @TheGoodGodAbove She should make his dumbass go barefoot until he can buy his own sneakers.
@tonyposnanski Maybe Ford should use him to advertise their trucks. I can just see #MAGAts being triggered and stupid enough to purposely crash their pick-ups into brick walls in protest.

@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You’re right. The people who work at businesses that are closing because of Trump’s trade war won’t recover. Nor will the federal workers who were screwed outnof a pay raise, or the folks who stand to lose their health care, or the 2500+ people who died in Puerto Rico.
@notcapnamerica Most likely they were “influenced” by their White husbands.
@GeorgeTakei You know they say if you’re an evil creature in this life, you’ll come bac as an even lower form in the next. 		Which begs the question. What kind of evil SOB slug was Donald Trump in his previous life?
@GeorgeTakei I’d like to come back as a Bonobo Monkey. Seriously. All they do all day is eat, sleep, and f#ck (and they have same-sex relations too). Yay!
@realDonaldTrump I don’t really like John McCain, or Meghan, or Cindy, or anything they stand for. But I will say this. Meghan McCain thoroughly OWNED your ass today. And the best part is that you’re too stupid to realize it, or know why.

@Kennymack1971 I suspect @DiamondandSilk make up the majority of that with their hair alone.
@leeleeb50 @windmillcharger I doubt there’d be a eulogy. He’ll be the the WH version of Eleanor Rigby. 	“Donald Trump died on the golf course and was buried along with his name. Nobody came.”

@Olivia_Emisar @QueerAspie1 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I suspect “tolerable” is pretty much normal for people who actually tweet a lot (as opposed to just retweeting).
@Rontildawn @BravenakBlog @Fangirl31 Or simply “people”. That works.
@BravenakBlog Because acknowledging the racism forces them to look at a part of themselves with which they identify, and which they hate. 		I think they call it shame.
@Cindystargazen @4YrsToday But you know they will. Because Trump says so.
Saddest thing about this is his supporters will actually believe they’ve made a fortune as they’re reading shut-off notices for their utilities. https://t.co/u5Gs7H2hD9
