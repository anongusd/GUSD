Tune in to @JansingCo at about 10:10 to hear me discuss the #GOPbudget and its devastating impact on the middle class
Plain and simple, the @HouseGOP budget is a middle finger to the middle class, Democrats will be laser-focused on it over the next 7 months
Read todays @WashingtonPost: DCCC Chairman: House GOP budget will define the next seven months leading up to midterms http://t.co/X7Zcr5T708
Getting ready to speak to @PressClubDC about the toxic GOP budget and 2014 landscape
RT @PressClubDC: Democratic Congressional Campaign Chair @IsraelDCCC to speak at Newsmaker today, 10 a.m. http://t.co/Grl87bK8G1 #NPCNews
House GOP is once again hypocritically voting for the same changes to Medicare that they’ve been vilifying for years http://t.co/tKmhX2Gamw
Democrats will shine a bright light on these flawed priorities every day from now until November
Budget will dial back investments in college education, let roads and bridges crumble and give tax breaks to corps that ship jobs overseas
GOP is doubling down on their efforts to give every advantage to the most privileged at the expense of hardworking middle class families
GOP budget makes crystal clear that they have turned their backs on the middle class so that they can stack the deck for special interests
There are now 12 open seats House Republicans must defend http://t.co/z5sBkeDfnD
Voters in #MI04 have a history of backing members of both parties, supporting President Obama in 2008 http://t.co/z5sBkeDfnD
Yet another senior Republican committee chairman is abandoning Boehner and his toxic Republican Congress http://t.co/z5sBkeDfnD
There are now 11 Republican-controlled open seats that have been made more competitive by GOP departures. http://t.co/VEjCPIFGLT #MI08
Voters in #MI08 have shown that this district is competitive - supporting President Obama in '08 and nearly in '12: http://t.co/CheXtNhOAn
Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee Boehner's broken Congress #mi08 http://t.co/VEjCPIFGLT
Getting ready to talk to @edshow about the new Ryan Budget that will continue to put special interests ahead of the middle class
DCCC had our best ever Feb. Raised $6.4M and have twice as much on hand ($34M) as at this point in '12. Thanks to all who made it happen!

Enjoyed talking to @hardball_chris about the importance of Dems staying on offense on ACA. Americans are rejecting GOP repeal obsession
House Republicans are tired of defending - or tired of even being part of - the most dysfunctional and reckless Congress in recent history.
...and today, senior Republican and Natural Resources Committee Chair Doc Hastings is abandoning House Republicans' sinking ship as well.
Yesterday, the most vulnerable Member of Congress chose to retire rather than be dragged down by this toxic Republican Congress...
