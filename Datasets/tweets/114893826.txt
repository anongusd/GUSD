@jamestanton @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @mrdardy Thank you James! You've got that creative visual mind that I wish I had.  I was a number theorist and algebraist but  counting sheaves kept me up at night (groan)😊	@dmarain
@HarMath @johnjoy1966 @jamestanton @mrdardy You and other great educators  bring my ideas to life! My instincts told me that this would be a rich problem but when we can share our ideas they soar! 😊 @dmarain
@johnjoy1966 @HarMath @jamestanton @mrdardy Remember John when I write these I don't see all the nuances and advanced mathematics that you&amp;others might see. My instincts tell me it is a rich experience for the students to explore. I saw some of the relationships you're talkin about but I probably will miss many😊 @dmarain

@HarMath @johnjoy1966 @mrdardy @benjamin_leis @robertkaplinsky @jamestanton @JohnAllenPaulos @dmarain 	Fred, 42, the period (length of repeating cycle) comes from the number of positive integers ≤49 which are relatively prime to 49. This is symbolized phi(49)=42. This means that 10^42  leaves a remainder of 1 when ÷ by 49.

@johnjoy1966 @mrdardy @_eylem_99 @benjamin_leis @HarMath @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath @dmarain I'll post something as soon as I get back from driving my daughter to work!😊
@mrdardy @_eylem_99 @benjamin_leis @johnjoy1966 @HarMath @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath @dmarain it comes down to looking for pairs of factors of 180 both of which are even:	2,90	6,30	10,18
@johnjoy1966 @mrdardy @_eylem_99 @benjamin_leis @HarMath @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath @dmarain John, did you see my reply to Jim in which I said there are three solutions one of which is 1988?
@mrdardy Then it makes sense to ask what	sin²x + cos²x = 1 actually means. Graphs, tables may *suggest*  it's an identity but we need another way to be "sure". The circular-based definitions provide such a way. @dmarain
@mrdardy That's what I was referring to!😊	@dmarain
@mrdardy @dmarain First I made sure they understood the diff between identical &amp; conditional eqns. Classify: 3x²-4=7-2x²-11+5x²	We can PROVE it's an identity by transformation of one side but it  IS an identity because both sides evaluate to same values FOR ALL REPL OF x (domain)
@mrdardy @_eylem_99 @benjamin_leis @johnjoy1966 @HarMath @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath @dmarain Building on your last step, Jim, I believe this leads to 3 possible values for k, one which is k=1988. Nice problem!😊😊
@MissNyetTrump They're terrified of losing their white privilege and the possibility of retribution
@MissNyetTrump It's actually 3.9% but they really rounded up! 😊

@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath Looks good. So what is the base 2 decimal base you currently are up to?	@dmarain
From my Twitter account 12-27-18		Compare, contrast	 0.1111... (base 2) and	0.9999... (base 10)		@dmarain @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @mrdardy @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath #MathProbs_Pedagogy
@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath You're on the right track! There is an algorithm but of course it's more fun wracking our brains (up to a point!) @dmarain
@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath Jim, I agree!😊 Now determine the base 2 representation of 0.1 (base 10)😊! What do you predict? @dmarain
@HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath Here's another one for you guys that follows up on Fred's suggestion. Convert 0.625 (base 10) to base 2! Have fun! 😊😊 @dmarain
@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath Agree, Jim. Considering other number bases helps children to explore more general relationships that can ultimately be investigated through algebra.	@dmarain
@HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath OK, Fred you have until New Year's to create a 5-page activity or dig up the one you did back then!😊😊
@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath There is an algorithm for converting base ten decimals to binary decimals. Interestingly, when it is applied to 0.999..., the result is 0.111... 	Before one worries about the rigor of such operations we want the creativity/curiosity to flow freely! 😊
@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @benjamin_leis @aranglancy @MrATeachesMath @CatalystInc Why not! Even though we have more experience and background many of the questions we raise in our own minds may very well be raised by students!

@HarMath @DavidKButlerUoA @johnjoy1966 @aranglancy @mrdardy @benjamin_leis Fred that's great. I'm guessing you use tree diagrams per John. I got 3 * 4 * 2=24. Jim's nice variation of counting multiples of 3 provides contrast with the multiplication principle used for individual digit problems. @dmarain
@mrdardy @HarMath @DavidKButlerUoA @johnjoy1966 @aranglancy @benjamin_leis Jim, I agree with making an organized list: 300,306,330,336,360,366,390,	396 etc	This can lead to a  combinatorial approach.

Asked my GS how they were expected to find a rule from  input to output after they complete the columns. His reply was "oh we just use guess-test-revise." I did a couple more with him with ∆x=1and he saw the pattern. He asked me if that would work if ∆x≠1 and 🙂🙂🙂	@dmarain
@mrdardy @johnjoy1966 @HarMath @DavidKButlerUoA @aranglancy Hey, Jim, I'm always cranky and I'm not even in the classroom! 🙂🙂 I'm trying to understand what the developers of this were thinking. Perhaps giving two rules for the columns is setting up ∆x and ∆y for linear functions. I would have done it a bit differently! @dmarain
@HarMath @johnjoy1966 @DavidKButlerUoA @aranglancy @mrdardy Agreed! My grandson was confused because they're giving two separate rules for the input and output and then asking for a third rule relating them. I'm just wondering if anyone has seen this as a way to developed a function relationship? I I think it's a mistake.
@mrdardy @johnjoy1966 @HarMath @DavidKButlerUoA @aranglancy Jim, I'm an advocate for multiple representations but the table could generate confusion if we're developing input-output relationships. So your frustration means you're not in favor of how this is being developed? @dmarain
I understand why rules for columns are given -- students can complete the table and then develop an input-output rule. However it goes against my grain for developing function concepts. Any thoughts? @dmarain @johnjoy1966 @HarMath @DavidKButlerUoA @aranglancy @mrdardy #MTBoS https://t.co/IYT5qlcOdO

I've read how Japanese children learn and when they say the Japanese equivalent of one-ten-two they are connecting it to one 10 *plus* one 2! Is it possible that the teachers may have been thinking area or perimeter rather than place value.
@DavidKButlerUoA @mrdardy @HarMath @aranglancy @johnjoy1966 @dmarain 	Agreed. Visual and physical representations of numbers are very important however I was addressing the issue of the difficulty our children have in remembering the *names* of numbers!

@mrdardy @HarMath @johnjoy1966 @DavidKButlerUoA Jim, my real purpose is to encourage math educators to think about their normal routine (taking out an egg carton) and how they translate to an appropriate math activity. Pretty much anything we do is connected!

@johnjoy1966 @HarMath @mrdardy @DavidKButlerUoA @benjamin_leis By the way I know everyone has seen variations on this problem or this exact problem. Typically you're using some digits to make every number from 1 to 100. I chose this for its accessibility. Modify as needed!
@johnjoy1966 @HarMath @mrdardy @DavidKButlerUoA @benjamin_leis One idea is to have that student  be tasked by the group to check the arithmetic.
@johnjoy1966 @HarMath @mrdardy @DavidKButlerUoA @benjamin_leis That may be true but my observation is that the student who is challenged will sit there feeling frustrated (and terrified of the teacher looking at her/his work). They feel less threatened in a group and even if they are relying on others it's worthwhile.

@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 Absolutely that causes confusion! A southeasterly wind could be represented by a vector opposite to the one I suggested! Lots to unpack here...
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 Direction, heading and orientation are not the easiest spatial concepts for most human beings. My take is that FACING Southeast implies that the car is stopped whereas HEADING SE means the car is moving in that direction.
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 Yes that's what I meant! My communication skills are declining with age!
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 Acting it out is the best approach for any age in these kinds of problems! What I meant was that we can start with simpler direction problems for younger children and then introduce more geometry and trig as students move up.
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 Acting it out is in my view the best way to learn. This is begging for a kinesthetic approach and I see this topic as one that grows with age. Symbolically we can represent Direction as a unit vector and turning as a rotation of that vector. Much much more here...
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 And David when I first tried to make sense of these I had to walk it myself! I was not blessed with great spatial sense so I brought up this question because I think it's a challenge for many of us! But nevertheless important for students to learn.
@johnjoy1966 @HarMath @mrdardy @DavidKButlerUoA That's an interesting "frame of reference", John!😊😊😊
@DavidKButlerUoA @HarMath @mrdardy @johnjoy1966 I'm concerned about the classroom environment for children to begin to make sense of direction. I believe we all accept that children have to act these out to make sense of this. Technology can only enhance active learning.
