Dear Christians, the kindness of the Holy Spirit should show on your FACE when reflecting on Israel’s future glory DAYS. The retribution they received in the past was FAIR, but YHWH has a FLAIR for forgiveness…and restoration. Marquis
Dear Christians, is your nation blood-THIRSTY? REVOLTING. But the true REPUGNANCE EMITS from the Body of Messiah, filled with members who daily violate YHWH’s sixth commandment against murder. It’s in the heart- hatred because of skin COLOR…your fellow SISTER or BROTHER. Marquis
Dear Christians, when FASTING, is it an Oscar winning performance with you? Do you like when others ASK because of the drama you PRESENT, how LONG it has BEEN, and how much longer? Your act is STRONG, but you weaken YHWH’s resolve…to reward. Marquis
Dear Christians, it's not healthy CONTINUING to speak to the dead after their passing as if they're still living. They're at rest. YOU are not, as you talk as if those you held DEAR can actually HEAR. Keep their MEMORY alive with FUN pictures, not ONE-on-ONE…SOLILOQUIES Marquis
Dear Christians, does your brand of righteousness differ from YESHUA’S? It SHOULDN’T. Do you give lesser credence to His expectations because grace is all that really matters- adding to His earthly message? This come from WITHIN and YHWH doesn’t approve of…the SPIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the beauty that is in the earth, that is- nature, is ABSENT DUE TO the politicalization of the ENVIRONMENT. What has the left or right to do with healthy HABITATS? When it comes to good stewardship, why must "liberal" or "conservative"…be ATTACHED? Marquis
Dear Christians, the patience of the Spirit is like gold found by an earnest treasure SEEKER. You long for permanent REPRIEVE from earth’s afflictions, but there's still work to be DONE under the hot SUN. THEREFORE, rely upon the SPIRIT for RESPITE…until YOU'RE raptured. Marquis
Dear Christians, it was YHWH’s will that Yeshua should die by way of the criminal to demonstrate the connection between the Son of MAN and HUMANITY. He was considered BROKEN by the broken world- the SPOKEN, broken LAMB who was, in fact...the great I AM. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, so you have made ATONEMENT for your sins by going before the cross. What’s next? CASUALLY trying to fit into the local ASSEMBLY as if it were the neighborhood country club? No. Your AIM is now proper TRAINING- as you are now…on the clock. Marquis
Dear Christians, neither Hell nor the Lake of FIRE are POPULAR topics in the ASSEMBLY, but taught they still must BE…because SCRIPTURE REFERS to them. Marquis
Dear Christians, HARDEN your face while keeping your heart SOFTENED when your back is against the WALL of INTOLERANCE. Your Faith is RELEVANT, so don’t allow those who DISBELIEVE in your God to DECEIVE you into thinking you’re UNINTELLIGENT for CHOOSING TO…follow Yeshua. Marquis
Dear Christians, THROUGH YESHUA YOU have been made light out of DARKNESS for the PURPOSE of PURSUING perpetual RIGHTEOUSNESS, so that YHWH may be GLORIFIED as the MOST HIGH and His Son…as the Lord of your LIFE. Marquis
Dear Christians, the peace of the Spirit comes in HANDY when having DIFFICULTY STANDING while being refined. The goal isn’t to wear out, but down- to the point of complete submission. You aren’t being asked to grovel, but to grow continually into…Yeshua’s likeness. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua redeemed you from Babylon, where the INTIMACY of the ASSEMBLY was foreign. Oh the LUXURY found in this great CITY! The BODY can appear dull in comparing. Though the fortunes of the DEAD will SHED easily at a time ALREADY set…on YHWH’s calendar. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH is interested in what RESIDES INSIDE the womb of WOMEN; thus should the entire Assembly SHARE His CARE for this individual’s life…placing THEOLOGY above IDEOLOGY. Marquis
Dear Christians, even secular leaders are under YHWH’s DOMINION, and should He decide to use any to further His agenda, that is His prerogative. WHO are YOU to disregard Biblical methods…in voicing your OPPOSITION? Marquis
Dear Christians, the Father CHOOSES whom He wants to serve Him, THROUGH His Son, but the lost still have a choice to respond in the affirmative or negative. While it is FOOLISH to DECLINE, YHWH doesn’t force anyone to…accept a new DESIGN. Marquis
Dear Christians, why concern yourself with the origins of your daily BREAD when your heavenly Father desires that you’re FED a healthy diet? Not only is He a concerned PARENT, but what good are you in serving His Son if your body is suffering…from FAMINE? Marquis
Dear Christians, the Holy Spirit provides lasting JOY, but it isn’t for your ENJOYMENT. While in the EMPLOYMENT of YHWH and Yeshua CIRCUMSTANCES will intend to discourage, but the Spirit is mightier than those EXPERIENCES, so you can remain in FORM…in the STORMS. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOUR SCORN for those leaders and armies who terrorize for evil gain is defensible; their ACTIVITIES are MADDENING. You SAY THEY deserve to burn in hell? That’s BIBLICAL- but so is the GOSPEL. Recall that Yeshua’s BLOOD COVERED them…too. Marquis
Dear Christians, so you RESPONSIBLY PRAY for the lost? Commendable. What of those in the ASSEMBLY who are struggling to STAY afloat? When did you last fall to your KNEES…to PLEAD? Marquis
Dear Christians, just because the lost are of the world, it’s erroneous to CONCLUDE that nothing they ever DO is decent. The heart of the matter is INTERNAL and THOUGH they need redemption, REFUSING to accept what some mean for your good on holy GROUNDS…is out of BOUNDS. Marquis
Dear Christians, when was the last time you WITNESSED YHWH doing something truly MIRACULOUS? But, you SAY, “That was just for the Bible DAYS”. Scripture does not support this declaration, so remove it from your EMBRACE and ask for…stronger FAITH. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH is a God of order, but that doesn’t MEAN HE can’t PLACE chaos in the lives of those who turn their FACE against Him. You say that by doing so He acts contrary to His nature? His goal is to RESTORE ORDER, so that you once again RESEMBLE…His PEOPLE. Marquis
@TomiLahren @AOC @foxnation I wish more people would pay attention to what comes out of the Congressional Budget Office. I love the fact that they are nonpartisan. Marquis
Dear Christians, after deciding to follow Yeshua, you could encounter persons who shared your former DIET, who aren’t BUYING IT. Don’t drain TRYING to PROVE YOU have different TASTE these DAYS, though THEY MAY leave when they see you’re CONTENT…with your new CONVENTIONS. Marquis
Dear Christians, when was the last time you had your spiritual eyes CHECKED? They are SUBJECT to blurriness and you need HEALTHY vision if you’re going to spot the lost and FOUND, and distinguish between the FREE…and those still BOUND. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is Biblical evidence for the zodiac- what the book of Job calls the Mazzaroth. AVOIDING the secular uses doesn’t require IGNORING the study of- RESEARCHING how the HEBREWS USED the constellations as SIGNS…signals in their LIVES. Marquis
Dear Christians, that Yeshua is the Son of YHWH and as a result is Divine is unsettling to many in search of religion. Monotheism is INDEED APPEALING, but there are some MISLEADING TEACHINGS that turn away. There is only One Father…so what’s the PROBLEM? Marquis
Dear Christians, you are members of a royal priesthood. As SUCH, you should CONDUCT yourselves THUSLY, so others in search of SAFETY will turn to inquire of your condition. And like a faithful servant, you’ll point to Yeshua, who will EMBRACE…and ERASE. Marquis
@TimBryantRadio I agree! Thanks for reading, Tim. Marquis
Dear Christians, why do you RETURN to PORN? Why do you go BACK to CRACK? Why do you REVERT to HURTING yourself and others? Why do you RESTORE what was supposed to be NO MORE? Marquis
Dear Christians, there are members of Yeshua’s Body who are COMFORTABLE with hearing the GOSPEL, but no more. ACCOUNTABILITY sounds too JUDGY and ESCHATOLOGY too dreadful. Yet, those topics are also ESSENTIAL…not to receive DEFERENTIAL treatment. Marquis
Dear Christians, HISTORICALLY, there was a time when the southern Kingdom of Judah was punished for IDOLARY by having her heart and mind DIVINELY closed to holiness…clogged for a SEASON to righteous REASONING. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Holy Spirit is the Chief instructor for BELIEVERS, and all in the Assembly who hold the office of TEACHER should be filled before expounding interpretations of SCRIPTURE…HEARERS deserve the truth. Marquis
Dear Christians, discipline is not just PUNITIVE, but also CORRECTIVE and solidifying. Yeshua’s followers shouldn't have to experience punishment, but the Spirit will consistently work to expunge bad habits so believers become FIXED...not allowing their flesh to ECLIPSE. Marquis
Dear Christians, the FOOTSTEPS of the RIGHTEOUS will not be without uneasiness while walking out the Faith, but that is part of the cost associated with Christian discipleship. Your focus mustn’t BE on the PAIN, but on what you’ll GAIN…at the end of the journey. Marquis
Dear Christians, picture the beautiful scene of EQUALITY in New Jerusalem, where none will BE without food, drink…or SHELTER from SWELTERING heat. Marquis
Dear Christians, learn the difference between Legalism and Righteousness: The former requires ADDITIONS to the Law, while the latter is an EXPECTATION, and is reflected by…obeying the Law. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU WHO find your strength in the economy of your nation- DO you USE the Most High’s NAME in VAIN? Attesting that He is your God, you instead serve markets and CURRENCIES; there is CLEARLY…a DISCREPANCY. Marquis
Dear Christians, IN the END there won’t be a single WEAPON that will DEFEAT the KING OF KINGS. Following the millennial reign of Yeshua, the attack on Him and His people will yield no fruit, as those who initiated will come to UNDERSTAND that they are indeed…only MAN. Marquis
@yashar As someone who suffered from childhood ADD, I think there needs to be more education and conversation about the difference between ADD and ADHD. I was taught and grew up understanding that there was indeed a distinction. Marquis
Dear Christians, when you pray for the Most High to INTERVENE in delivering you from ENEMIES be open to the POSSIBILITY that He may have a difference of opinion in the style. If you aren’t careful you’ll BEGIN to RESENT and your relationship with YHWH…will STRAIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Spirit of YHWH has to strengthen YOU THROUGH exercises so you’re an affective soldier in Yeshua’s army; a FEW of them will SEEM EASIER for you than others. However, when some soreness does kick in don’t be ALARMED…you’re becoming better ARMED. Marquis
Dear Christians, why turn to the world's water for refreshment when all it really does is dry you OUT? There is nothing ABOUT what it has to offer that will improve your needy CONDITION. YHWH’s PROVISIONS provide the best chance…for survival. Marquis
Dear Christians, what you SEE on T.V. regarding other COUNTRIES isn’t the complete truth. Is there economic NEED? Yes. However, often the spiritual climate doesn’t correlate. In many CASES, their spiritual HEALTH outshines the poverty of…WEALTHIER NATIONS. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, another REASON for Israel’s BEATINGS was because of her UNCEASING IDOLATRY. So, you are not COMPLETELY immersed in- fill in the blank. But, more of your ENERGY is used for your wants and less for what Yeshua demands…you fit the PROFILE of a DEFILER. Marquis
Dear Christians, some of you are swift to EXPLODE when you hear of grave injustice. Yet, you were TOLD the account of MATTHEW, WHO went from thieving tax collector to DISCIPLE because Yeshua took time to share the GOSPEL…with even him. Marquis
Dear Christians, ATROCITIES hit Israel’s ENEMIES- EVENTUALLY. You don’t like YHWH’s timetable because you don’t understand it. PERSECUTION can be EXCRUCIATING, but when you don’t get direct Divine INTERVENTION- now…keep your ATTENTION. Marquis
Dear Christians, Paradise will be perpetual REST from WRESTLING with the seed of sin. Your spirit will no longer strive with FLESH and your mind will be RELIEVED with having ACHIEVED…final VICTORY. Marquis
Dear Christians, signals come in many FORMS; you just have to be open to receiving them. They are WARNINGS. Indications that YHWH and Yeshua are on the verge of displaying ire for insolent…ingrates. Marquis
Dear Christians, parents must learn to comfort their CHILDREN after DISCIPLINING to avoid exasperation. YOUTH will grow to despise if all YOU show them is SEVERITY. You want their RESPECT, but you’ll become the OBJECT of their ANTIPATHY with your DEBILITATING…PARENTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s wrath is not UNRELENTING, but tied to REPENTANCE. When His people have proven through their actions that they are THROUGH MISUSING His grace, then they are granted PERMISSION to CONTINUE with…their holy MISSION. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Lord shows no favoritism when it comes to serving His PUNISHMENTS for DISOBEDIENCE. When one falls into the hands of an angry GOD, you will SUFFER- BEFORE returning to SOLID GROUND, where you should now remain…SOUND. Marquis
Dear Christians, not all prophetic utterances in SCRIPTURE came to FRUITION in the immediate FUTURE. Studying Biblical timelines ACCURATELY is important for correct interpretations. FAILURE to do so results in UNSASTISFACTORY teaching. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Lord’s JUDGEMENTS are JUST, and yet HE's still a God who loves ARDENTLY. Why, then, MUST there BE created a false DICHOTOMY? He isn’t either or, but both. MANY in the ASSEMBLY just choose to ignore His justness…BELIEVING that it just sounds too MEAN. Marquis
Dear Christians, one reason the Lord would raise up ENEMIES against a believer’s COUNTRY is the STEADY worshipping of a false god instead of or next to their professed true God. And ONLOOKERS will stare in awe at what once was…but is no LONGER. Marquis
Dear Christians, one symbol of the Holy Spirit is fire, which is warming- but it also burns. You are delusional if you BELIEVE that you aren’t ever going to BE discomforted by the THIRD MEMBER of the Godhead. The Spirit is not here to CODDLE…with a baby’s BOTTLE. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, if you are not attending to your GARDEN, then what do you expect will arise from the ground? Are you interested in hordes of WEEDS, rather than healthy TREES? The Gardner dislikes the former and so PRUNES…even if you’ve TUNED out. Marquis
Dear Christians, the stains of SIN vary in depth in every BORN-AGAIN believer. Yes, you have been CLEANED enough to enter PARADISE should you DIE tonight. But, YESHUA still REMOVES RESIDUE as you walk. Don’t be dismayed…by the time it takes for some to GLEAM. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Lord, HISTORICALLY, raised up ARMIES to attack the FAITHFUL turned REBEL. The Bible does not indicate He will never do it AGAIN. THEN, why DO MULTITUDES believe this METHOD is….now DETESTED? Marquis
Dear Christians, respecting the faiths of others is good, but not all roads lead to Heaven. Christianity holds the essential TRUTH. And while YOU must VALUE free will, keep hold of your sense of URGENCY…for those still outside of the ASSEMBLY. Marquis
@smerconish @CNN As a former victim of rape and after listening to the facts of this case, while I agree that he is not responsible for turning the women into sex slaves, he knew he was breaking the law and deserves to be punished for that only, though I wish it were a felony. Marquis
Dear Christians, GENUINE VISIONS from the Lord are given to anointed leaders of the Church, as identified in the book of EPHESIANS- for the Church. They are not a psychic PHENOMENON or DRAWN from shady…attention seekers. Marquis
Dear Christians, numerous enter the ASSEMBLY with baggage from broken temporal FAMILIES, which often includes fractious SIBLINGS. Sadly, they interact SIMILARLY with their brothers and sisters in Messiah. There is no righteousness…in RIVALRIES. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Church is supposed to be BEAUTIFULLY juxtaposed to the ugliness of the world. When you look HONESTLY- is this what you SEE? If you have DIFFICULTY then it’s PROBABLY because there has CEASE to be a clear DISTINCTION..what some might call EXTINCTION. Marquis
Dear Christians, what REASON(S) do you give for any to QUESTION your passion for the Faith? Is it your lack of Biblical knowledge? How about the ABSENCE of SERVICE? Possibly, are you devoid of any FRUIT? When was the last time you spoke openly of…your ROOT? Marquis
Dear Christians, for whom do you save your expression of genuine LOVE? ENOUGH of leaving out the males in the Body. Their MASCULINITY is not compromised by hugging them or speaking a gentle word when appropriate. You should have an AFFINITY for showing affection…to all. Marquis
Dear Christians, every member of Yeshua’s Body is lovely to Him. He can handle your present appearance, as a VESSEL still broken, but ACCEPTABLE. But you who could care LESS about your BROKENNESS, with your "Christian" CASUALNESS as EVIDENCE…still look unsightly. Marquis
Dear Christians, how deep is your QUEST for permanent REST from sinful habits? While it is the Spirit who empowers one to live in holiness, you still must have the DRIVE…to stay ALIVE. Marquis
Dear Christians, it is NECESSARY for members of the opposite sexes to learn to relate in a more HEALTHY FASHION. Platonic INTERACTIONS where real intimacy still EXISTS beyond the SURFACE is missing…much to Yeshua’s DISSATISFACTION. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, there's no REASON the topic of sex should be taboo in the Body as if members of the Godhead were opposed. Were it discussed more, and with TRANSPARENCY, then members of the ASSEMBLY would be less LIKELY to go out of bounds- out of CURIOSITY…or OBSTINACY. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is work to be done at NIGHT when CRIME is at its WORST. There are PERSONS ORCHESTRATING the EVIL- on their way to HELL. Why wait until they're in JAIL...before going to share the GOSPEL? Marquis
Dear Christians, WALKING in wisdom can be EXHAUSTING when all around you is foolery. But, keep up the MOMENTUM. If you stop to listen you will be TEMPTED to DIGEST- throwing off your DIET...while the SPIRIT is PROTESTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, Christian AUTHORS should be measured with the same ruler that all spiritual ENDEAVORS are: Does the Holy Spirit lead? Before YOU pick up their BOOK...LOOK first, at their FRUIT. Marquis
Dear Christians, sometimes marriage is a two-way street- both should not always be traveling in the same direction. You're MARRIED, but it's UNHEALTHY not to give space to BREATHE. You don't love them LESS because you grasp the concept of...POSSESSIVENESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, giving IN to SIN is not just a bad DECISION.  In the same way it CONTROLLED prior to your CONVERSION, your submissive  ROLE now will produce greater FRUSTRATION because although you could have chosen DIFFERENTLY, you gave in to your flesh...WILLINGLY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, it is unfair to expect any MAN to “take it” without fail. Their MASCULINITY should not be tied to their ABILITY to withstand any pressure the world throws at them. None are YHWH…though some try to make them that WAY. Marquis
@TomiLahren It's a problem with insufficient formal education in Economics, in my opinion. Marquis
Dear Christians, be reluctant to consider agrarian life too provincial for YOU. The HEBREWS were healthier because their foods were grown NATURALLY; and while they moved more SLOWLY, they also lived more COMPLETELY…and longer. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, do not SPEND your days hoping for a long life for the sole purpose of filling it with MEANINGLESS pleasures- none of which will last after you've taken your last BREATH and entered DEATH. Your soul yearns for more than...EMPTINESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, take heed when you tell YHWH you are going to do SUCH and SUCH. When you go before Him, you say MUCH, but then do little. The Most High is UNIMPRESSED with your...hasty GESTURES. Marquis
Dear Christians, what is your incentive to SUCCEED in the workforce? Is it the NEED to OUTDO a fellow EMPLOYEE? Do YOU put your nose to the grindstone TO parade your prestige? What an OVERACHIEVER. Though neither of these are solid behaviors...of a sanctifying BELIEVER. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Church is in the business of building up- TRUE. But, she also has the RESPONSIBILITY of tearing down TOO. Walls of division, for example; as well as all barriers that threaten the spiritual VITALITY...of YHWH's FAMILY. Marquis
Dear Christians, Not everything in life is FUNNY. So, you NATURALLY have a SUNNIER disposition than your neighbors? GREAT- YHWH made no MISTAKE; be who you are. But the rains come. Find the serious bone in your body before the Body of Messiah finds you of...little use. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH has a particular DISDAIN for the VAIN. But, there is nothing wrong with wanting to look physically attractive. Just because you work out to stay in SHAPE, doesn't mean your motivation is to leave others GAPING...at the mouth. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, allowing sexual lust to drive all your DECISIONS is a recipe for the Godhead's just retribution. Sex wad created for marriage- where there is freedom to ENJOY. Members who EMPLOY RECREATIONALLY outside of YHWH's LAW act no DIFFERENTLY...than the FALLEN. Marquis
Dear Christians, recognizing that your intellect is limited and your thoughts fallible will make your walk easier. Remain dependent on the SOURCE; you will have less to show REMORSE for as you…stumble toward perfection. Marquis
Dear Christians, those who “never learn” even after REPEATED SPIRIT-led attempts to correct such EGREGIOUSNESS need to be left ALONE…to BEMOAN in utter misery. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is reason to FEAR a wicked ruler, but don’t live in it. They are deceptive, until they tire of wearing their mask. While the mind may gravitate to what’s offered initially, BEWARE of the long-term EFFECTS…they’ll be SUSPECT to say the least. Marquis
Dear Christians, DO YOU know anyone in the Assembly who TRIES to HIDE their hatred? Not the RIGHTEOUS KIND, motivated by love for Yeshua. But, one of the secular VARIETY. Don't pretend you don't NOTICE...EXPOSE it. Marquis
Dear Christians, what makes the Good News good? OBJECTIVELY, it starts with the END of ENMITY with YHWH. It continues with the release from bondage. But what follows is open to perspective. Some are excited about the benefits...of family. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Church should BE SPEAKING out LOUDLY against all forms of wickedness, as the Spirit LEADS each member. Don’t shy away from CONTROVERSY, fearing a loss of PEACE. The world is far from living in Yeshua’s peace as IS…it’s your job to continue His. Marquis
Dear Christians, teach the YOUTH to embrace the TRUTH, rather than fear it. DECIDING to LIE is conditioned behavior. It is commonly the result of exasperation. “I prefer to avoid the TRUTH because when I tell it, I’m still ABUSED”…why? Marquis
Dear Christians, taking advantage of the POOR by IGNORING their IGNORANCE when it comes to things financial is worthy of YHWH's contempt. What each need is proper EDUCATION...not sneering CONDEMNATION- nor CONDESCENSION. Marquis
Dear Christians, you GET what you give, though not always in the PRESENT. Your life should reflect Yeshua’s. And WHEN you HAPPEN to be reviled for reflecting Him well, continue giving what’s good. In the long run you’ll be pleased with what the Holy Spirit…pressed out. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, disrespecting PARENTS is no light matter. You DISAGREE with words or actions? Fine. FERVENTLY? Fine still. But you turn a new leaf, and an UGLY one at that, when you haven’t JUSTLY “had it up to HERE”, and your mannerisms turn…SEVERELY impious. Marquis
Dear Christians, anger is one thing- unrestrained wrath is ANOTHER. One is spiritually healthy and the OTHER unsafe. TEMPERS have consequences ILL-CONSIDERED when emotions fly high. Learn to RELEASE without INCREASING the heart rates of those listening…for Heaven’s sake. Marquis
Dear Christians, having a DISPUTE and there seems to be no RESOLUTION? How about turning to YHWH- FIRST. The outcomes without Him will prove WORSE, as no TRUE wisdom will have been USED, and all parties INVOLVED will leave incomplete…as the problem wasn’t really SOLVED. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, do you have “FRIENDS” less interested in your spiritual walk and more in CAROUSING because it’s less BORING? You should detach yourselves from such poison before your position becomes more PRECARIOUS…than it already IS. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s FAVOR is BETTER than the compliments of mankind- often laced with insincerity. And after considerable practice through the Holy Spirit, it is easier to OBTAIN and MAINTAIN than the LATTER’S, who REQUIRE that you PLAY their ENERVATING…games. Marquis
Dear Christians, is it your PREFERENCE to amass great wealth at the EXPENSE of an AUTHENTIC relationship with YHWH and Yeshua, rather than gaining honestly and at a slower PACE, though other FACES may look on…with derision? Marquis
Dear Christians, backsliding is a dangerous ACTIVITY and never the intention of Yeshua for someone who has entered the FOLD. What EXACTLY about your OLD lifestyle is attractive to YOU relative…to the NEW? Marquis
Dear Christians, SO you don't like reading the BIBLE. You have your reasons, to be certain. But, none negate the FACT THAT you are supposed to read it...anyway. Marquis
Dear Christians, EASY money is APPEALING for various reasons and many iniquitous have acquired with the admiration of onlookers. Refuse to COVET what you can’t GET with the same tactics because you decidedly prefer….RIGHTEOUSNESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, is your nation on firm standing? Check the moral COMPASS of the POPULACE- that includes the secular and the Church. If your country is CRUMBLING, it's more than likely that both groups are filled with the SLUMBERING…in desperate need of a wake-up call. Marquis
Dear Christians, the eyes are more than windows to the soul; they are also a TOOL for spiritual MOVEMENT. They can be USED to REENERGIZE the lethargic and admonish the complacent. Don’t fear using yours…for DISCIPLESHIP. Marquis
Dear Christians, DO YOU USE your tongue for unsavory purposes? The lips are for HEALING, REASONING, and accountability- not for murderous PROVOCATION, ISOLATION, or…corrupting. Marquis
Dear Christians, SIMPLETONS SPEND too little time in the WORD and too much in the WORLD. It is no wonder, then, that THEY are so easily SWAYED into ENGAGING in acts of…debauchery. Marquis
Dear Christians, it is wise to work if it is within your abilities. Laziness is a vice that deserves RIDICULE and expect no one to help YOU after CHOOSING, with a clear mind, to remain SEATED because you prefer EASE…GRIEF is your gift to the earth. Marquis
Dear Christians, those in the BODY WHO SEDUCE because they’re LONELY are no better than the lost who mirror in their performances. Playing coy may work on your prey, but the Holy Spirit is UNAMUSED and YOU’RE making a MOCKERY…of CHRISTIANITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, FATHERS should IMPART meaningful INSIGHTS into their sons and daughters, while allowing them to question if so INCLINED. Take no offense, but be prepared to answer TRUTHFULLY. There’s no harm…in their wanting depth and CLARITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, learn to adopt “love” as a state of being- pushing past emotion. When it becomes WHO YOU are it will be easier to reflect when you’re not in the MOOD to EXUDE it…with others. Marquis
Dear Christians, monitor SOURCES of wisdom. Spend fewer moments on persons’ outside appearances and MORE on their FRUIT PRODUCED. If what's seen is ROTTEN, THEN disregard age, title, or POSITION and don’t discount the idea of receiving pearls from a… “lesser” EDITION. Marquis
Dear Christians, that King Solomon ruled with extraordinary wisdom is well KNOWN. Be well in reminding yourself, however, that his ruling wisdom was not, in fact…his OWN. Marquis
@andrewrsorkin I agree- there needs to be a greater amount of financial/economic literacy taught to all sectors of the U.S. populace. In my opinion, tax incentives should be rooted in fairness and a vigorous national discussion on the 16th Amendment is in order. Marquis
Dear Christians, it might do you some good mentally to TAKE a BREAK from toiling to CONCENTRATE on Heaven. YOU DO have the right to look FORWARD to a REWARD when you leave the earth. You are not being selfish in CONTEMPLATING what AWAITS you…for a job well done. Marquis
@ChrisEvans I love the pic, Chris. We need more genuine animal lovers in the world. Marquis
Dear Christians, you have freedom of SPEECH- then SPEAK out against those leaders who encourage the DISMISSAL of BIBLICAL BEHAVIOR, while FAVORING the popular “pagan”; hold their feet to Holy FIRE and ignore the IRE of the lost, who SEE the world…with moral SUBJECTIVITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, a STUDY in Marine BIOLOGY would increase your biome COMPETENCY, and perhaps you’ll BE less LIKELY to discount those whose passion is for KEEPING the earth’s waters…CLEAN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the wicked have no right to enjoy the same blessings YOU DO as obedient servants of YHWH and Yeshua. Some suggest this idea is unloving, but to assert otherwise…is un-Biblical. Marquis
Dear Christians, your FRIENDS may indeed STICK with YOU THROUGH THICK and THIN, but none are your God. Each are there for your BENEFIT, but none are FIT for worshipping, so stop expecting them to MEET…all your NEEDS. Marquis
Dear Christians, what about YHWH are you prepared to RELAY…to the next generation? Marquis
@CaerwynnD @MomTrixie @RepSpeier @HASCDemocrats Thank you for your sentiments. My experiences were excruciating and I am still suffering from the effects. I do hope that if there are others who had similar childhood experiences with the military they will come forward. I believe in accountability and healing. Marquis
@RepSpeier @HASCDemocrats Thank you for this panel. I'm a former military dependant and childhood victim of repeated rape by a service member over several years. I never received justice because of the military culture then. Please focus on this childhood related issue too. I'm sure others suffer. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s MAJESTY is worth CONSIDERING- often. He is both FATHER and RULER. It will help to keep the FLESH in CHECK in tempted MOMENTS of COMPLANCENCY…and definance. Marquis
Dear Christians, in a world of INEQUALITIES, at birth mankind’s TOTAL DEPRAVITY is UNIVERSAL, as is the OPPORTUNITY for redemption. It's a Church DISCIPLINE to distribute words of healing so that all may once again share the same…improved CONDITION. Marquis
Dear Christians, why do you struggle with PRAYING aloud in groups? Do you fear speaking incorrectly? Yeshua provided the model. Stop comparing yourself to what others are SAYING and remain TRUE TO your Lord’s template. Your voice…is also valuable. Marquis
Dear Christians, running for cover into the arms of the world when evil seeks you out is disadvantageous. Disappointment doesn’t sympathize well, and in the long-run your eyes will have swollen shut from angst. Your heavenly Father’s arms are STURDIER and…WORTHIER. Marquis
Dear Christians, the strength of YOUR salvation is the Holy Spirit, who equips with the POWER to obey YHWH’s Law. Rely on yourself and you will fail REGULARLY; MISERY will BE your life-long…companion. Marquis
Dear Christians, you are not all-knowing as it relates to your future or others. You might get along better if YOU REFUSED to walk as if you were. Trying to fill YHWH’s SHOES PROVES exhausting- doesn’t it? When will you get the CLUE that your feet…don’t fit? Marquis
Dear Christians, in your fervor to spread the Gospel- to enlarge the Kingdom, your expectations ought be realistic- for timing is everything. You are planting SEEDS, through your words and DEEDS, but then you must WAIT…for the RAINS. Marquis
Dear Christians, how can you sing while still living in the captivity of the earth? By the RESILANT power of the Holy SPIRIT. Yeshua released you from spiritual bondage- YES. But, you haven’t entered Paradise YET. The earth is UNRELENTING…so SING to escape its misery. Marquis
Dear Christians, protect yourself from placing Yeshua above YHWH- from putting the Father beneath the Son. Both are members of the triune Godhead, EQUALLY, but there is too a HIERARCHY. BIBLICALLY, Yeshua told His hearers from whom HE derived…AUTHORITY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, Do YOU give UNDUE REVERENCE to your local church building? Be responsible, for sure, for its CLEANLINESS and regular upkeep, as stewards. Though, the building is not YHWH. Monitor your habits to safeguard your EYES…don’t turn the building into a SHRINE. Marquis
Dear Christians, MAKE no MISTAKE, you are servants of YHWH and Yeshua. It is fine to acknowledge yourselves as sons and daughters, as well as younger siblings- you are. HOWEVER, you also have an OCCUPATION…as a DISTRIBUTOR of INFORMATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Assembly is supposed to dwell UNITED. Yeshua never INTENDED for His Body to be DISSEMINATED in the guise of denominations- each denouncing untruths in the others. There is one Truth. The Spirit should BE LEADING…not the wisdom of man. Marquis
@TheDailyEdge The U.S. Congress needs to do a better of educating the general electorate about how both Houses operate - General rules and such, which includes committee operations and voting procedure. An enlightened electorate is better equipped to follow and to make decisions. Marquis
Dear Christians, your confession came with the paste of Yeshua’s BLOOD, binding you to His LOVE and requirements for WALKING IN UNION. While LIVING out the Faith, is there any EVIDENCE of an ADULTROUS relationship…with the world? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, what is the ORIGIN of SINFUL pride? Yeshua walked with decency despite the crowds who followed and listened because He was led by the Spirit- not His flesh. When you have ACHIEVED, you too can maintain HUMILITY by giving your FLESH…no RESPITE. Marquis
Dear Christians, one incessant violation committed by HISTORICAL ISRAEL was disregarding the Sabbath, where no work was to be conducted. The people were more interested in prosperity than OBEYING YHWH, who EXPECTED them to REST…from laboring. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is coming a day when the fruit of SEEDS SOWN long AGO will be harvested and carried into the barn for safe-KEEPING. The WEEDS with their entanglements won’t enter the same ROOM- they who like to parade their TOMBSTONES…in the most gaudy of manners. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you are in declining health and can sense an untimely death knocking at your DOOR, maybe repentance is in ORDER. You have plans to SEE your POSTERITY, but CURRENTLY your lifestyle is offensive…MARRED by sinful ODOR. Marquis
Dear Christians, even among those who do bear children naturally, at some point down the line ADOPTION may be a better OPTION. It beats the alternative for those who were CONCEIVED…but are now causing BEREAVEMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, after you’ve been cut down to SIZE for PERSISTENT DEFIANCE- blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the Father and Son’s INTENTION is for RESTORATION. To the REGRETFUL…both specialize in FORGETTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, it's EASY to get discouraged over the prevalence of evil in your nation. If you're now desensitized to IMMORALITY, though not engaging too, then revival is in order.  It’s like your spirit has DEADENED- your ears DEAFENED to the call for righteousness. Marquis
Dear Christians, AWAKEN from your dream-like STATE, which AIDS your MISTAKEN PERCEPTION that your walk as a DISCIPLE will be devoid of TROUBLES. Reality is a healthier PLACE to exist in. Don’t INUNDATE SPACE with COMPLAINTS…be GRATEFUL that YHWH stands with you. Marquis
Dear Christians, do you maintain a balance between Heaven and earth, as it relates to your eyes’ focus? It is CHALLENGING, to say the least. Both require your attention and ABANDONING one at the EXPENSE of the other…is DAMAGING to your WITNESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, Israel lacks PEACE because her Prince doesn’t RESIDE on the throne. That doesn’t RELEASE you from the responsibility to pray for much. Yeshua is still missing from the LIVES of masses. TEMPORAL peace will come later, but the SPIRITUAL can be FOUND…NOW. Marquis
Dear Christians, your heavenly Father should be the first Person YOU turn TOO when in need of comfort. No EARTHLY vessel SHARES His CAPACITY…to CARE. Marquis
Dear Christians, it's sensible to PRAY for YHWH's armor every morning, as you walk the battlefield of LIES that DEFINES the earth. Neglect and DEADLY arrows penetrate your BODY. Keep it off and you’ll become just as TOXIC as the other NOXIOUS SOULS…CONTROLLING the world. Marquis
Dear Christians, is it possible to live a life free of SIN as Yeshua COMMANDED, while still walking with the seed INSIDE…to which you should have DIED? Marquis
Dear Christians, to suggest that ALL in Israel are LOST is to show a lack of knowledge. There are MISSIONARIES in the COUNTRY and many souls have been won. Do some sound research before OPENING your mouth and BELTING out evidence of blind...PREVARICATIONS. Marquis
Dear Christians, another WAY that cultures worship YHWH distinctly is in their manner of dress. Don't be RUDE in PRESUMING the CRUDENESS of a member's character because based upon where they live, showing some SKIN isn't inherently...TITILLATING. Marquis
Dear Christians, a good indication that your mind is in need of rest is the sudden INABILITY to think CLEARLY and then to speak COHERENTLY. The bed has long since been calling...it's time you answered. Marquis
Dear Christians, IDOLATRY is DISHEARTENING to YHWH for a number of REASONS. To begin with, the practice SCREAMS, "I don't love YOU", as something a little less than wholly CONSUMING...has arrested your attention. Marquis
@smerconish @CNN @cnni @Harvard As a Christian I am very interested in the connection between the Faith and Science, including astronomy. I also wonder if there are Christians who wrestle with extra-Biblical scientific truths, such as the possibility of alien existence. Marquis
@WPfilm In my opinion, the Church, holistically speaking, doesn't teach enough about the function of the Holy Spirit, hence why many struggle to live life, daily, through the power of the Holy Spirit. Marquis
Dear Christians, don’t be shocked when YHWH has decided He’s FINALLY had enough with an ENEMY- and responds ACCORDINGLY…His patience isn’t permanent. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, is your political party AFFILIATION also your sinful AFFLICTION because it has long since become…your god? Marquis
Dear Christians, you aren't WAY off BASE in thinking YHWH should bless you financially for OBEDIENCE to His Son. This was, after ALL, a PROMISE made to Israel in COMPLIANCE with the LAW. But, do you have tunnel vision? It isn’t the only WAY YHWH DISPLAYS…His favor. Marquis
Dear Christians, a Talmid was a Jewish scholar- often translated as “DISCIPLE”, as WELL. They were utterly devoted to Yeshua durying His time. TODAY it’s common to HEAR a believer SAY, “I’m no Bible SCHOLAR”,- explaining their IGNORANCE…excusing their INCOMPETENCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, The book of Psalms confirms that the Father and Son are not the same. In many verses there is EVIDENCE that the two are not SYNONOMOUS. So, stop scratching your HEAD in trying to UNDERSTAND how they are One, yet not. It ISN’T YHWH’s INTENTION…TO CONFUSE. Marquis
Dear Christians, stop with the age discrimination. Just because one is young it doesn’t mean they don’t deserved to be punished for mal-behavior. YOU think their physical appearance is CUTE OR ADORABLE. But, their conduct is DEPLORABLE and your GUSHING is…DISGUSTING. Marquis
@richny, I have tried to search on the Internet for https://t.co/UGMIxeumQb opinion guidelines for submissions. Can you help? Including where I send them to? Thanks, Marquis
@TwitterMoments @AOC I have mixed sentiments about the Green New Deal as is, but I do like the spirit of the measure. Can someone tell me if anyone or group has ever given serious consideration to Hydrogen-based energy usage, as an alternative to fossil fuels? I would love to read about it. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, one filled with the Holy Spirit has joy EVEN in the midst of their ENEMIES. You PROBABLY don’t have a smile on your face- an indication of happiness, but neither is there a scowl, as the focus is on the VICTORY you SEE- and YES…even in the DISTANCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, are YOU thankful that with your ties to YESHUA you have access to the heavenly Father’s agape love, which isn’t based upon lust or EARTHLY kinship, both of which can be FLEETING and UNHEALTHY. How often do you tell Him? How often do you…show Him? Marquis
Dear Christians, there are those living in spiritual Egypt who are curious about YHWH’s wonderous works. If any were to encounter you- could you TELL? Could you make the SALE? If your RESPONSE is a lengthy PAUSE then you need to return…to the Word. Marquis
Dear Christians, a motivation for reading the Bible is to learn of YHWH’s miraculous DEEDS. If HE did them “back THEN”, He is CERTAINLY capable of doing them AGAIN…so why LIMIT HIM? Marquis
Dear Christians, the subject of Geology is worth reviewing. One might gain a better APPRECIATION for the CREATION account in GENESIS and be reminded, once again, that YHWH is not opposed to the SCIENCES. Marquis
Dear Christians, one DEFINITION of REDEMPTION involves paying off something- like a debt. When you were lost you INCURRED numerous debts and rather than allowing YOU TO CONTINUE rotting in prison, the Son SECURED…with His blood. Marquis
@ChrisEvans Sorry if I sound ignorant, Chris, but what took you to the Senator's office? Marquis
@TwitterMoments In my opinion, commemorating the passage of the 19th Amendment is worth clapping over. It would be nice if more of the general electorate were familiar with Article V of the U.S. Constitution. There are other issues worth considering today. Marquis
Dear Christians, when you are suffering from SICKNESS keep it CONTAINED so others don’t become CONTAMINATED. You are not loving your neighbor by showing INDIFFERENCE to their healthy state. STAY home and ENGAGE in…self-care. Marquis
Dear Christians, do members of your temporal household grimace as they watch you act like Messiah in front of everyone else outside your “HOME”, while they’re GROANING behind closed doors at your devilish DEMEANOR…and BEHAVIORS? Marquis
Dear Christians, just because music is secular, it doesn’t make it inherently sinful; listen to the lyrics before passing judgement. The spirit of the song might still uplift and casting it ASIDE because the Godhead doesn’t RESIDE in- may result in your missing…out. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH communicated with Moses and Aaron, AUDIBLY, in a cloud. The Holy Spirit too SPEAKS to believers today, but one must be disciplined to hear ACCURATELY. So, if a member says the Spirit SPOKE to him or her, why do you PROVOKE him or her…with disbelief? Marquis
Dear Christians, you don’t have to be a singer to make joyful sounds to YHWH. Let not your inability to sound professional deter obedience. What He’s listening for is not perfect PITCH, but the RICHNESS of your…sincerity. Marquis
Dear Christians, how does Yeshua’s sovereignty sit with you? He's Lord of ALL. Do you feel CLAUSTROPHOBIC in admitting? Do you prefer to reign in some area of your LIFE, so don’t feel quite RIGHT about turning it over? Perhaps your KNEES NEED more contact…with the earth. Marquis
@TwitterMoments I'm looking forward to listening. It is my desire that all parties vested in the national emergency conversation/question will have, if they haven't done so already, carefully examined the U.S. Constitution first. Marquis
Dear Christians, in the HABIT of taking CREDIT for the Spirit’s work? When ministering to the NEEDY to whom do you ascribe the ABILITY to LAST for hours? What about recalling Biblical PASSAGES or speaking with courage? All are supernaturally IMPARTED…GUARD your thoughts. Marquis
Dear Christians, you BELIEVE that YHWH is good, but what is your DEFINITION? Is it CONDITIONAL? Does He CEASE being who He is when your circumstances become unfavorable? YHWH’s essence is constant even though happenings aren’t. Don’t tie His nature…to the natural. Marquis
Dear Christians, are you IMPERIOUS about your RIGHTEOUSNESS? You have a right to be PLEASED about your redemption- you SUCCEEDED in giving up your LIVELIHOOD for the good of the KINGDOM. But, your tones might need adjusting if others are turned off by your LOUD…PLOWING. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua, while MODEST, POSSESSED strength. The media disserves when portraying the Lamb of YHWH as victim, rather than as an agent of His Father who walked to CALVARY, WILLINGLY. So, TOO when telling the story, it’s your DUTY to speak in...victor’s terms. Marquis
Dear Christians, there’s no harm in awaiting the ruin of the repugnant HOLISTICALLY- for Scripture tells their future; but using all your ENERGY hoping for their DEMISE leaves little TIME for PRAYING. Your AIM should be their HEART…though hard when yours is equally DARK. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, the compulsion to SIN, as well as easily giving IN should have ENDED with your salvation EXPERIENCE. While the SEED continues sitting DEEP in the flesh, it should no longer LEAD. Does it? Why IT…instead of the SPIRIT? Marquis
@Merck Merck, I commend you for your dedication. In my opinion, better treatment of the earth (concerns pollutants and what have you) and more research into the medicinal benefits of undiscovered foliage would be positive steps forward. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is no such thing as reincarnation. Your life has a BEGINNING and an END- it is LINEAR, not cyclical. So, conduct yourselves knowing that a conclusion will be reached and afterwards REPAYMENT for your life’s…STATEMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHY SHY from comparing ancient religions with CHRISTIANITY? It's intriguing- some of the SIMILARITIES between “their” gods and YHWH; Greek and Roman MYTHOLOGY, for example. It's not promoting syncretism to analyze and REFLECT…it is not DISRESPECTFUL. Marquis
Dear Christians, waves crashing all around you? Perhaps you traveled farther than the Holy SPIRIT…INTENDED. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Lambs Book of Life is a record of the names who have inherited Heaven, but your heavenly Father is also AWARE of details. Your goal should not THEREFORE BE to MERELY enter the GATES, but to MAKE sure YHWH has no reason to express His…disappointment. Marquis
Dear Christians, why is it so difficult for you to FORGIVE? Is it your position that by pardoning you are GIVING IN? The Father and Son gave in WHEN you first WENT before the CROSS- and neither One came ACROSS…as RESENTFUL. Marquis
Dear Christians, RESTORATION to wholeship is an involved process. The idea is to one day fully mirror the outward PERFECTION of Yeshua, who was born UNBROKEN. Let Him focus on your CONSECRATION and the SPIRIT, your SANCTIFICATION; and be PREPARED…to SHARE. Marquis
Dear Christians, what are some ways you can PERSONALLY help your local ASSEMBLY feel more like a COMMUNITY of intimate neighbors who are invested in each other’s WELFARE…much like EARLIER disciples did shortly after Pentecost? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, don’t CONFUSE a country’s politics with their RELIGION, even if the TWO are closely ALIGNED; thus, you avoid unfairly MALIGNING and PRACTICING...DISINGENUITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH judged the wicked ANGELS justly who REBELLED. The treachery resulted from free will. Scripture doesn't assert the remaining had their freedom stripped for precaution. Those who still serve CHOOSE TO DO so. Don’t TEACH what’s Biblically…out of REACH. Marquis
Dear Christians, having a hardened heart is worse than clogged ARTERIES; the LATTER is ACTUALLY EASIER to self-detect: DIFFICULTY BREATHING and SLEEPING are two signs. The FORMER requires the spotting of ANOTHER, as the person ILL is now…UNSKILLED. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, the Spirit may be urging toward domestic MISSIONS. There are PROSTITUTES downtown, for EXAMPLE, WHO need the GOSPEL. Their bodies are UNCLEAN and BETWEEN the hours of eleven and THREE THEY belong to a PERVERT who, by the WAY…also NEEDS CONVERTING. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, you expect YHWH to DEFEND your country against her enemies, but YET, in it perhaps there are an INSUFFICENT number of the COMMITTED, which explains the FOREIGN…ANTAGONISM. Marquis
Dear Christians, you are to stand and resist the Devil through the power of the Holy Spirit- not flee in fear. Doing otherwise is an insult to the Godhead, in implying, through your ACTIONS, that THEY, in Satan…have met their MATCH. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua takes no delight in any teachings that suggest Israel was ETERNALLY separated from YHWH when SHE HOLISTICALLY rejected the Gospel message. There’s no Biblical SUPPORT for this claim and those who do PURPORT…sound anti-Semetic. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, INTERESTED in rousing the anger of the Most High? Pay little to no ATTENTION to the abused CHILDREN in your NATION- THOSE still at “HOME” or in the system who’re rarely given a VOICE…because they can’t VOTE. Marquis
Dear Christians, watching the news can BE DEPRESSING because it SEEMS all one SEES is negative. But that is INDEED the world you live in- lost. You should BE inspired to pray more FREQUENTLY, not to, instead…watch less T.V. Marquis
Dear Christians, notice how UNSIGHTLY barren TREES look. No one who has the means keeps them AROUND unless awaiting the time to chop them DOWN…and throw them in the fire. Marquis
Dear Christians, it’s excruciating to watch the SINFUL enrich their pockets, obstacle FREE, while a multitude of the FAITHFUL live in POVERTY. Though, why QUESTION this OBSERVATION as it relates to the world when it's KNOWN that the world takes great care…of its OWN? Marquis
@smerconish @RalphNortham @CNN @cnni I'm in the minority with my opinion, but I believe he should NOT have to resign. I am a Christian and listened to the video. He looked and sounded "repentant" to me. That picture was taken in 1984. It is 2019 with no evidence that he still reflects that painful picture. Marquis
@retirementhound People generally want to live long because of goals they want to reach. In my opinion, it isn't the idea of getting old, inherently, that's unappealing, but what often accompanies- forgottenness, for example. What's often lacking is ample empathy from those looking on. Marquis
Dear Christians, the earth moans in AGONY over the seeming APATHY of those who were given TEMPORARY lordship. No, it can’t PRESENTLY BE like EDEN because of the fall, but must it resemble a CESSPOOL?…Is this how Christian mankind is supposed to RULE? Marquis
Dear Christians, you are INITIALLY, INTENTIONALLY, saved by grace- inheriting the righteousness of Yeshua. That same righteousness is a prerequisite for entering Paradise and later, the New Jersusalem. You initially OBTAINED it. Are you still MAINTAINING it? Marquis
Dear Christians, when you PRAY and don’t hear from YHWH immediately, are you left believing that the answer is, “No”? or that your BEHAVIOR, while you’re growing, is of LOWER CALIBER than the seasoned next DOOR- thus, why He is IGNORING? More patience…less presumption. Marquis
Dear Christians, is there no appeal to CONVENING with your Church family outside formal GATHERINGS? Do you find they are too COLD or OLD-FASHIONED? How about sharing some HEAT. INQUIRE about their STYLE before FILING them away as…”Not for ME”. Marquis
Dear Christians, what is one adjective other believers would USE to describe YOU? Would the word “serious” come to mind? What about “thoughtful” or “reflective”? Would any STRUGGLE to define you as anything other than…CASUAL? Marquis
Dear Christians, WHO would YOU rather serve- a God that was FEARED by NONE, and so no ONE ADHERED to a single commandment, but fulfilled, instead, their selfish whims at the expense of others, or a Ruler that required RESPECT, with high EXPECTATIONS…benefitting all? Marquis
@TheView A worthy topic for considering. I would be more in favor of Election Day being moved to Sunday without making it a federal holiday- a great number of employees and employers would have no related stress. We have too many holidays in the United States, in my opinion. Marquis
Dear Christians, strengthen your understanding of the scientific community instead of running from it, believing you have to GUARD your HEART against IT. The SPIRIT will LEAD you to READINGS and YHWH will open your mind, if NECESSARY, to grasp what you don’t…NATURALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, not everyone worships YHWH the same WAY YOU DO. There are cultural differences equally valid as yours. SO why frown at THOSE who RAISE their hands to PRAISE instead of keeping them in their LAP?...Why is their a GAP in your mouth? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, bullies are typically starving for proper ATTENTION. While SOME are products of permissive and indulgent parenting, others result FROM negligence. Your consternation OVER their BEHAVIOR is fine, but their guardian(s) PROBABLY deserves your…ANTIPATHY. Marquis
Dear Christians, what is it about your life that INDUCES you to place greater VALUE on the TEMPORAL rather than the SPIRITUAL? Is it the distractions? If so, remove them before the Lord has to. His ways…are weightier. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU WHO like to refer to Yeshua as your Rock, recall that most rocks have a peculiar BEAUTY to them- true, but they are also jagged, giving the ABILITY to sharpen other objects. You are the object of Yeshua’s AFFECTION…so EXPECT to be PERFECTED. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you ALLEGE to believe and YET are living IN SIN, WHEN YOU go TO petition YHWH, your PRAYERS fall upon…deaf EARS. Marquis
Dear Christians, one of the Holy Spirit's duties is to EMPOWER. There are sheep who entered the fold after having spent their prior lives COWERING, and so when the Spirit urges they are prone to WONDER. Don’t be SURPRISED- for you are supposed to be LIVELY…not SLIGHT. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, those NATIONS who take their stand against Israel for unjust reasons are also standing against the Most High, who’ll eventually bring them all rather LOW…with their PEOPLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, ensure you’re daily wearing the shoes of PEACE while walking in the desert’s dead of HEAT. You will come across salty persons whose arrows are aimed at your sound mind. Don’t allow their DEEDS to force your RETREAT into…retaliation. Marquis
Dear Christians, don’t BE so QUICK to REACT when your ENEMY throws out the first heavy punch. Sometimes it is best to just step aside and after hitting AIR, watch as they fall to the ground…and just stay THERE. Marquis
@sunny @TheView Congratulations Sunny on New York. Those are good steps. I don't believe in statute of limitations at all for various reasons. I only wish there were federal laws in place to cover the nation. I too was a victim and received no justice as a child. Marquis
@TheView Congratulations Sonny on New York. Those are good steps. I personally don't believe in statute of limitations at all for various reasons. I only wish there were federal laws in place to cover the nation. I too was a victim and received no justice as a child. Marquis
Dear Christians, be proactive in praying to YHWH to guard your thoughts. Not only DO YOU wrestle with sinful RESIDUE as a Christian still growing, but there’s also fleshly temptations from your surroundings. Alone, you don’t have the power to CONQUER…the DARK. Marquis
Dear Christians, why live in terror over DYING as if you cannot bear the thought of letting go of what will be left BEHIND. If you know you’ll be in PARADISE- rejoice…it’s NICER. Marquis
Dear Christians, don’t EXPECT the world to act like the Church- that’s foolery. Be UPSET that the Church acts like the world…that’s disgusting. Marquis
Dear Christians, do you perceive the MOST High’s method as laissez-faire, as EVIDENCE by the lack of faithful leaders at their POST, guiding the Assembly in the ways of RIGHTEOUSNESS, while your country is still prospering? Do not mistake His ALLOWANCE…for ABSENCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, being casual about STUMBLING as if Yeshua condoned half-hearted devotion is like MUMBLING your profession of love. Where is the passion?...What’s the point? Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH isn’t MONITORING your every movements, WAITING for your MISHAP so He can ZAP you back into submission. While He does expect perfection, KNOW that He isn’t perfectionistic, but patient…keep GROWING. Marquis
Dear Christians, so YOU sacrifice constantly for YHWH? TO whom DO you show and tell? By chance is what you need to give up the megaphone carried under your arms- used to announce your ACTIVITIES…on behalf of the ASSEMBLY? Marquis
Dear Christians, NOT a single soul is a possession of yours. Desist from treating others as if they are. If your LOT in life has afforded you BETTER THERE'S no need for GUILT- perhaps you did BUILD it. But, be AWARE of the lost who walk with such AIRS…and don't go THERE. Marquis
@HowardSchultz A good reason, in my opinion, for all Americans to become politically independent. I believe, much like George Washington, that political parties/factions do more harm than good for our country. Marquis
Dear Christians, after nine months expecting mothers give birth- most often great pains accompany, but then joy FOLLOWS. Stop expecting the Holy Spirit to allow for a HOLLOW faith. There will be great discomfort while walking the earth…but then joy follows. Marquis
Dear Christians, when Yeshua ascended with the cloud back to His home in heaven it WASN’T a PERMANENT PLACEMENT. Scripture confirms that He’ll be back and more than once; the first will be BRIEF…for those who’ve earned the RELIEF. Marquis
Dear Christians, is the Church a place of REFUGE for YOU from life’s troubles? It should be. But, while you are resting and RECEIVING the PEACE you NEED, messages of coping should be heard so when you RETURN to the world, you will have LEARNED…how to take another step. Marquis
Dear Christians, the sword of TRUTH is a USEFUL TOOL when addressing the intellectually LADEN who are BENT on your conversion from Christianity to secularism. It is your fault if your FACULTIES are dulled to the point of DEFEAT, because you fail to KEEP them…sharpened. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is a distinction between the children of YHWH and His ENEMIES. All of mankind are not one big FAMILY. Those who haven’t accepted Yeshua as their SAVIOR don’t share the same privileges as those who have…such as YHWH’s FAVOR. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you’ve ever been accused falsely, take your cause to your heavenly Father and allow Him to DEFEND. In the END you’ll have much better success than if you tried with your own HANDS to…extinguish the DEFAMATORY. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you can’t see anything but NIGHT, even during the day, you’re no longer walking in truth. Dawns are always on the HORIZON. Be patient, but don’t count the hours - it will only prolong your suffering. What's needed is a benign ATTRACTIVE...DISTRACTION. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, there is a DIFFERENCE between getting even, personally, and expecting that those who have conspired against you will be JUSTLY re-paid by the Most HIGH. Your guilt is UNJUSTIFIED…and UNHEALTHY. Marquis
Dear Christians, have you ever shared OPENLY of how Yeshua saved you from the depths of DEPRAVITY? There is no SHAME in PROCLAMING from where you were delivered. No one has any business GRINNING over your former SINS WHEN their previous RESIDENCE…was just as dark. Marquis
Dear Christians, part of your prayers are supposed to include a request to keep you from sinning. DO YOU believe that YHWH has the power to AID you in…ABSTAINING? Marquis
Dear Christians, King David was not perfect. While he was a man after YHWH’s own HEART, he wasn’t that way from START to finish. David faltered because he allowed his flesh to WIN, and afterwards he had to sincerely REPENT…before relief was SENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, are you concerned that your LIGHT shines too BRIGHTLY? Are you fixated on the idea that others will think you’re trying to put on a SHOW, SO your actions are practically nil? Focus less on what “they” THINK and keep BLINKING…or YOU’LL RUIN your sight. Marquis
Dear Christians, because of deficient earthly parents a number among the lost and found have GREAT difficulty RELATING to the heights of YHWH’s love for His children. If you have the appropriate connection, ensure that YOUR INEPT NEIGHBOR…knows the DEPTHS. Marquis
Dear Christians, have you ever been the victim of EVIL? Do you MARVEL at the magnitude of depravity exhibited by some of MANKIND? WHY lose yourself in “whys” and “hows” when the answer is behind the TEMPORAL…BECOME COMPETENT in SPIRITUAL warfare. Marquis
Dear Christians, how is YHWH MAGNIFIED in your LIFE? From your lips is His NAME used in VAIN, contradicting your kneeled confession? The idea is that people are SUPPOSED to ASSOCIATE YHWH with holiness. Is He DIMINISHED in any way by your brazen…BLEMISHES? Marquis
Dear Christians, musical INSTRUMENTS are INSTRUMENTAL in worshipping YHWH. They help to prepare the heart and brain for the hour’s message, like they helped the Israelites prepare for war. CLEARNESS and ATTENTIVENESS are REQUIRED…for both ENDEAVORS. Marquis
Dear Christians, FORMER PRISONERS know the RELIEF ASSOCIATED with their RELEASE from CAPTIVITY- it’s EXHILARATING, and for MANY the sentiments are long-lasting. Why isn’t it the SAME for those who spent their lives...SPIRITUALLY CHAIN-GANGED? Marquis
Dear Christians, ARE you in a current state of feeling FORGOTTEN? MAYBE it’s WARRANTED, as the ASSEMBLY is filled with the INWARD focused. Perhaps you are the cause because YOU TOO are inward…neglecting to speak out. Marquis
Dear Christians, dancing to illustrate your joy in the Lord isn’t a sign of immaturity or “Pentacostal” OVERKILL. A little ZEAL is harmless. Having your spirit REVEAL how it really FEELS without regard to the CROWDS is…ALLOWED. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Monarchy of Yeshua is not everlasting. According to the Bible, He will one DAY have to return His sovereignty to YHWH, who is FATHER of all and so deserves the highest…HONOR. Marquis
Dear Christians, shepherds should be prudent, rather than prudish and, thus, showing they’re FOOLS. It’s one thing to encourage RULE following; it’s another to PRETEND that all CONTEMPORARY behaviors are worthy of…CONTEMPT. Marquis
Dear Christians, as you are seeking the face of the Lord, do you ponder His current countenance? What expression DO YOU believe you’ll SEE upon capturing Him FULLY? CONTENTMENT or BEWILDERMENT…with the status of His Church? Marquis
Dear Christians, sharing with others of how YHWH has BLESSED you is not boasting, NECESSARILY. It’s all in the tones and body language. Still, others need to hear as a matter of INFORMATION and…INSPIRATION. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, your sinful CONDITION, inherited from Adam, entitled you to hell. It was YHWH’s MERCY, unmerited, which ORIGINALLY saved. Apply this principle to people now WHO are as corrupt as YOU were THEN…dead in SIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, are YOU inclined to blend the Father and SON into ONE as if there is no difference between the TWO? While they share the same essence, aquiescing to the casual conviction that they are interchangeable in RHETORIC…is HERETICAL. Marquis
Dear Christians, when walking through the VALLEY of the shadow of death, remain aware of the fact that shadows are not REALITY. While you may have moments filled with DREAD…you are not, in fact, DEAD. Marquis
Dear Christians, praying for Israel is OBLIGATORY; not just for her SAFETY, but spiritual PROSPERITY, as well. And those who have been called should answer SWIFTLY…with their FEET. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is nothing wrong with petitioning YHWH for LUXURY if you’re DESERVING. Who says the definition of CHRISTIANITY…is PENURY? Marquis
Dear Christians, “God” is  a title. Perhaps it will help you to relate to your HEAVENLY Father more PERSONALLY if you were to refer to Him by his actual NAME…your relationship won’t be the SAME. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua was not on Earth to abolish the Law, to those who INSIST IT'S ANACHRONISTIC. It was for the delivered from Egypt- that is, from a country where darkness reigned. But, the spiritually lost was also RESCUED- so TOO for them the Law is EQUALLY…LEGAL. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Holy Spirit is in the business of ensuring you perceive your HEAVENLY Father UNROMANTICALLY. He's not rocking in some antique in the SKY with a twinkle in His EYES- MESMERIZED and chuckling to Himself as His so-called children…engage in mischief. Marquis
Dear Christians, love for YHWH professed from your lips should compel a loving lifestyle, which involves interactions with neighbors- including those living outside GATES…you CREATED. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU’LL remain spiritually fit by thanking YESHUA for His painful death on the cross on a regular basis- decreasing the likelihood of TAKING the FAITH for GRANTED now that you’ve been PLANTED…in more fertile soil. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, YESHUA’S RIGHTEOUSNESS was given TO YOU as a gift, as opposed to having to work for IT. YET, it does take effort to maintain while wrestling with your lower nature still attached to FLESH…refusing to give you REST. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, what EXCUSE DO YOU have for not shining in BRILLIANCE as younger siblings of the Son? YOU WHO have access TO the Word and can MOVE freely without fear of verbal retaliation…or incarceration? Marquis
Dear Christians, the ASSEMBLY is walking in darkness though it does have eyes to SEE. What it NEEDS is a jolt to remove the SLEEP- thus reducing its heaviness. Once LIFTED it will once again BE FIT to bring others…into the light. Marquis
Dear Christians, the spoken TRUTH is highly underrated; not to mention the tendency to skew it when it SUITS. You are violating a variation of the ninth commandment each time you diverge from…divulging. Marquis
Dear Christians, mental ILLNESS is not ADDRESSED SUFFICIENTLY in local ASSEMBLIES. CONGREGATIONS are filled with disciples wrestling with DEPRESSION, for EXAMPLE. Suicide Ideations are AMPLE and shepherds must become more AWARE of those just sitting THERE…suffering. Marquis
Dear Christians, having a lack of MONIES is no reason any should BE denied arbitration against the WORLDLY. The more affluent should provide fellow members with what’s NECESSARY to prevail in court so they aren’t MISTAKEN for someone who can be…TAKEN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the OPPRESSED would like nothing LESS than fair treatment and JUSTICE. They need a voice to speak up on their BEHALF- not LAUGHTER…or indifference. Marquis
Dear Christians, birds swim and fish FLY because that is how they were DESIGNED. You were crafted to one DAY fellowship with YHWH. The former BOTH GO with the FLOW without any RESERVATIONS. How do you justify your HESITATIONS? Marquis
Dear Christians, it’s sad if going to church has BECOME a CHORE for you. Exactly why do you find it CUMBERSOME- WHY do you feel you’ll DIE from BOREDOM? Marquis
Dear Christians, how SERIOUS do you take REPENTANCE? When was the last time your confession was accompanied by tears because the SIN you COMMITTED called for IT? Making personal ATONEMENT should be a grave MATTER- AFTER all…Yeshua’s was. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHY are you content with the LIE that the God of the Bible is only a God of love? YHWH also hates, and so does His SON. The only ONES who can’t accept this TRUTH are spiritually DELUSIONAL, and so find solace…in faulty adages. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHERE did you get the idea that anger was…INHERENTLY sinful? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, WHEN was the last time you requested that YHWH clothed you with His armor? The shield of FAITH CAME with the EQUIPMENT YOU now have access TO because of your adoption…but you still have to request IT. Marquis
Dear Christians, what is the problem with your thought PROCESS? Why do you FRET as you observe your nation acting contrary to the TEACHINGS of Yeshua when all secular SOCIETIES are devoid of the Spirit? You should be PRAYING- not staring…DISMAYED. Marquis
Dear Christians, who does your company consist OF? Are you concerned ENOUGH about your reputation that you keep great DISTANCE between you and the WICKED? You’re FOOLISH if YOU fail to DO so. When they perform from their NATURE…you won’t be perceived as any GREATER. Marquis
Dear Christians, how successful would you be at causing flowers to bloom by the wave of your hand, or fruit to come forth with a whisper? YOU WHO are not the Creator of the UNIVERSE are incapable of creating out of CHAOS- so why DO YOU go from DOUBTING…to SCOWLING? Marquis
Dear Christians, questioning YHWH is not irreverent. Your heavenly Father is not going to SMOTE you with a lighting BOLT because you DON’T understand this or THAT and believe that you are better off ASKING than MASKING…your frustration. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, the original EDITION of the Scriptures are referred to as the Autographs by CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIANS; they were without error and without TRANSLATION. Today, the Bible has been RE-WRITTEN more than once- each with differing WORDS…how ABSURD. Marquis
Dear Christians, have you ever explored nature with its animals in their natural HABITAT? There are lessons to take from how they INTERACT with their environment. For example, several know that when the sun is blazing it’s time to stop for a SPELL…to REPEL the heat. Marquis
Dear Christians, as clay are you OPENED to being MOLDED by the Potter? Bear in mind that shapening has UNPLEASANT ELEMENTS to it. As you are being PRESSED…remain IMPRESSIONABLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, even the WEATHER is UNDER the thumb of YHWH. Not a drop falls from the SKIES that He hasn’t AUTHORIZED. The Diests are in ERROR…with their PERSPECTIVE. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU WHO live in a nation that murders GROTESQUELY- DAILY. How much longer do expect the Father and Son to remain SILENT among the RIOTING? Remember the Great Flood? There are other ways of responding…to rebellion. Marquis
Dear Christians, animals hold a special place in the eyes of YHWH and Yeshua, but you are more special still because you are made in their IMAGE; However, that doesn’t mean that they unjustly…DISCRIMINATE against them. Marquis
Dear Christians, have you ever suggested that the Holy Spirit was wrong when attempting to guide you in the proper direction because you don’t really want to move that way? Stop bereaving the SPIRIT just because you aren’t interested in…hearing IT. Marquis
Dear Christians, do you walk around in spiritual MATURITY, but FALSELY BELIEVING that your CONSECRATION and SANCTIFICATION are complete, while displaying otherwise? SADLY, you can’t SEE what others can- …why? Marquis
Dear Christians, educate yourself on the roles of the Spirit, for there are MANY. Leaning on your own UNDERSTANDING when reading the Word GREATLY decreases the PROBABILITY that you will comprehend…ACCURATELY. Marquis
Dear Christians, GUARD your HEART so that it does not follow all that is SENSED- thereby reducing the likelihood that your Lord will be INCENSED by your lack of…good SENSE. Marquis
Dear Christians, animals are instinctive- RELYING upon sheer FEELING to act. It is unwise to live in similar FASHIONS, as EMOTIONS are ephemeral. Operating on URGES will result in sounds of the DIRGE playing in its minor KEY while others are LAMENTING over…what’s over. Marquis
Dear Christians, to those whose children have LEFT the nest and now you’re feeling BEREFT- take a BREATH. It is good that both you and they have SPACE to FACE yourselves. CO-DEPENDENCY on anyone other than YHWH is…UNHEALTHY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, IDLENESS is unbeneficial. Getting LOST in your THOUGHTS so that now you are doing absolutely nothing is unproductive. Your INCLINATION to remain STATIONARY has now INCREASED, and now you’re useless…to say the LEAST. Marquis
Dear Christians, educate yourselves on the roles of the Spirit, for there are MANY. The SEALING is vital, but if you limit the function here, solely, you’ll have a poor FAITH; and when the Books are opened you'll have a poorer CASE…regarding your work in the Kingdom. Marquis
Dear Christians, have the courage to tell your friends the truth even when they are at their LOWEST if doing so will raise them higher. Don’t FOCUS on their current DEMEANOR and you won’t give in to your INNER RANCOR…enticing you to stay quiet. Marquis
Dear Christians, Bildad was one of Job’s so-called FRIENDS, who offered lousy GUIDANCE during his tribulations. Do you have one of THOSE who SUPPOSEDLY mean well, but give off more TOXINS than…OXYGEN? Marquis
Dear Christians, what do you think when you see persons living on the STREETS? Have you ever made the decision to walk up and MEET one and listen to their ACCOUNT…WITHOUT sneering? Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH has made Yeshua your Judge at the end of your service. In His robe and with gavel, judgement will be PRONOUNCED. As He ANNOUNCES a verdict, your spirit will either QUIVER or feel gratitude…for its DELIVERANCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, poverty is widespread even among members of the Church. What are you doing to curb their ills? Do you have extra CLOTHING to spare, or do you LOATHE the poor, BELIEVING that they’re DESERVING…”I mean, they must have done SOMETHING”. Marquis
Dear Christians, look around. Not everyone has a life like yours. And as you’re GAZING, what you’ll SEE will BE appalling. And, there’s no use rubbing your eyes as if you’re dreaming and trying to wake up. “The world is BROKEN”, is more than a…SLOGAN. Marquis
Dear Christians, what is your purpose on the earth? Many in the Assembly ponder in VAIN, for Scripture PLAINLY REVEALS that as children of YHWH and siblings of Yeshua, you are on the earth…to HEAL. Marquis
Dear Christians, how adept are you at showing REMORSE? The heart is the SOURCE, but are your facial expressions in sync with what’s leaving your lips? So you’ve APOLOGIZED- does your new behavior QUALIFY…as a witness? Marquis
Dear Christians, words shoudn’t be wasted; choose them with CARE. Once they enter the AIR they can’t be retrieved. VIEW them as having great VALUE. Don’t diminish it by tossing them out like rancid trash whose destiny is the DIRT...beneath the EARTH. Marquis
Dear Christians, Spiritual EXASPERATION is not the EXPECTATION of Yeshua for his SHEEP. If you notice you’ve REACHED this point, don't stay- walk to a smoother area for RELIEF. Your GRIEF didn’t happen BRIEFLY. In the future pay attention to those that led to your…lying. Marquis
Dear Christians, TEARS should not go on for YEARS. There is indeed a TIME for WEEPING, but then it should CEASE- less you go BLIND because you refuse to FIND better ways…to cope. Marquis
Dear Christians, angels aren't to be worshipped, but prayed for to ASSIST in spiritual warfare- evil EXISTS. Don't tell others that after death they become ANGELS in an attempt to comfort; your ANGLE is misguiding. Finally, angels are REAL, so stop…CONCEALING. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, there is no second CHANCE after you DIE. Your LIVES should count now. For after your last EXHALE- when you’ve bid your last FAREWELL, you’ll have not another occasion to show Yeshua that your wedding vows were more than just…words. Marquis
Dear Christians, when involved in a conversation with ANOTHER, REMEMBER that silence on your part is essential after sufficient words. It takes TWO, and yet when YOU insist on CONTINUING, how is the other to CONTRIBUTE? They also have THOUGHTS…worth getting ACROSS. Marquis
Dear Christians, seek to acquire wisdom on a daily basis through prayer. YOU may have knowledge, but do YOU know how to exercise it? YOU may have understanding, but what’s the USE, if YOU don’t know how to…USE it? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, AKIN to a good earthly parent, your heavenly Father doesn’t ignore bad behavior, though perhaps you would rather He did. And perhaps you would prefer that He gave you whatever you wanted. You APPARENTLY don’t want a Parent, but something…ABHORRENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, accusing YHWH of MALICE when events aren’t going your WAY is DANGEROUS. YES, He is listening, but YOU ASSUME Him to be mercurial like some of the ancient gods. It is illogical to CONCLUDE that HE’s anything, but good. It’s a matter of...ONTOLOGY. Marquis
Dear Christians, the fields of ASTRONOMY and its cousin ASTROLOGY are worth examining BIBLICALLY and SCIENTIFICALLY in obtaining an accurate understanding of the prophetic SIGNS of past, present, and future…TIMES. Marquis
Dear Christians, IT'S helpful to turn to VETERANS in seeking answers to some of your perplexing QUESTIONS regarding stumbling. If you’re SPONTANEOUS then faltering will occur more often than not. Ask those more SEASONED about the benefits of a more…REASONED approach. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOUR days on the earth are finite. BEFORE completing the charting of your life, ensure that service is included in your plans. With all the brokenness in the WORLD, it’s UNIMAGINABLE that you couldn’t fit something WORTHY onto your…ITENERARY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, do you have a healthy appetite for RIGHTEOUSNESS? As you walk around interacting do you leave a bland taste in the mouths of others like flavorless MEAT? You are to be salt for those currently rotting…dying to feel COMPLETE. Marquis
Dear Christians, foolish people lack security, though convincing them of MUCH can be CRUSHING if you insist on STAYING for the DEBATE going in circles. You and THEY are on different PLAINS, and thus your words are HATED…and WASTED. Marquis
Dear Christians, the wisdom imparted in others can, at times, BE difficult to reflect yourself when the ENERGY isn’t there to do so. When YOU are drained from DEPRESSION your IMPRESSIONS become SKEWED. Thoughts lack clarity and given ADVICE is lost…in NIGHT. Marquis
Dear Christians, have you ever wished you weren’t born? Has your anquish ever been so DEEP that even WEEPING fails to comfort? Do you feel GUILTY for THINKING that YHWH is a CRUEL RULER for allowing TRAGEDY? Don’t FRET in FORGETTING that HE can handle…all your emotions. Marquis
Dear Christians, Satan is not YHWH’s opposite, but His and YESHUA’S TOOL for discipline. As long as you’re walking in obedience then there is no need to fear Satan’s operations. And while he’s CUNNING, stop blaming him for all…your SHORTCOMINGS. Marquis
Dear Christians, what comes to mind when you hear the name, Job? “SUFFERING” ought be APPLICABLE. NOTHING in the GOSPELS should leave any with the impression that even a faithful disciple’s LIFE will be devoid of STRIFE. Marquis
Dear Christians, hold your temporal leaders accountable FOR where Caesar’s MONIES go. The MORE you disregard the greater the likelihood CURRENCY will be used for purposes you DISAGREE with. Your IGNORANCE might be a HINDERANCE to…JUSTNESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically, the number four SPEAKS to the earth. Unfortunately, mankind still SEEKS ways to plunder what was GIVEN for stewardship, and THEN wonders why it's ailing. Your DOMINION BEGAN in EDEN, but the INTENTION wasn’t for you to…DEVOUR. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, have MEN and WOMEN troubled you so that you have begun to displace their shortcomings onto your heavenly FATHER, believing He is an equal FAILURE? While YHWH has a personality, He is not human. Never equate HUMANITY with the sovereign…DIVINITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, at what POINT do you RELINQUISH STUBBORNESS and ask for mercy from the Most High? An onset of DISAPPOINTMENT changes you not and hardship is just brushed off. You are indeed a tough case to CRACK…like a STACK of impenetrable bricks. Marquis
Dear Christians, do not think so HIGHLY of yourself that you have to be lowered to SEE PLAINLY that you’re no better than the believer walking next to you on the same JOURNEY. SELF-CONFIDANCE and ARROGANCE…are not SYNONOMOUS. Marquis
Dear Christians, it is UNWISE to show everyone all the cards in your hands, unless you trust them with your life. It is not a matter of craftiness. EYES can be intrusive and shifty. Keep your hand CLOSE…CLOSED to ARTFUL SHARKS. Marquis
Dear Christians, the MOURNING period is not the same for all believers. A WARNING for those rays of SUNSHINE, whose early KINDNESS will be rebuffed…roughly. Marquis
Dear Christians, BLIND allegiance to any earthly ruler is like FINDING a cloud in the sky and fixating on its shape even as the thunder claps. You can’t hear the DANGER- you’ve become a STRANGER to its sound. You FOUND the CLOUD COMPELLING, and now…there’s LIGHTENING. Marquis
Dear Christians, as the Bride of Yeshua, your physical APPEARANCE and COUNTENANCE ought display your love for the marriage. On the earth, SPOUSES are interested in how the other DRESSES and what their facial expressions REFLECT. Is it ADORATION…for the ASSOCIATION? Marquis
Dear Christians, one way to measure the AUTHENTICITY of Scripture is to study HISTORIOGRAPHY. Compare names and dates found in the Bible with primary source DOCUMENTS to increase your CONFIDENCE and RESOLUTION that what you’re reading…is the TRUTH. Marquis
Dear Christians, are you a good manager of your MONIES? DO YOU know the MEANING of disposable income, and gross versus net? What about DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN a want and a NEED? Does your lifestyle…MISLEAD? Marquis
Dear Christians, Scripture records five LEADERSHIP roles Yeshua assigned to the Church: Pastors, TEACHERS, Evangelists, Apostles, and Prophets. Those walking in these SHOES should ensure they are indeed supposed to be wearing them…WHO commissioned YOU? Marquis
Dear Christians, while Yeshua is the Head of the Church, the ASSEMBLY ACTUALLY belongs to YHWH. Yes, pay homage to the One whose blood was shed on CALVARY, but don’t forget…who sent Him to suffer. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblical numbers have meaning; five is the number for grace. There's YHWH’s grace in sending Yeshua to die. But, He too has GRACE to give while you’re running this RACE, so that you don’t have to dwell on those old habits that…hindered your existence. Marquis
Dear Christians, located south of the Sinai Peninsula, the Red Sea seemed the END for the Israelites, as the EGYPTIANS pursued. A miracle of YHWH, the parting waters became their salvation. A marvel that should've come to mind when they were later FOUND…DOUBTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, for various reasons not all members of the ASSEMBLY, CLEARLY understand what they are READING when opened to the Word of YHWH. That’s why group STUDIES are sometimes helpful. Lend your FACULTIES to Yeshua’s flock…so they too can flourish. Marquis
Dear Christians, even in today’s culture, names carry SIGNIFICANCE. When approached by the CURIOUS, why is your response, “I am a METHODIST” or “I am a BAPTIST”, etc.? Why is not, “I am a CHRISTIAN”…why is this not your ADMISSION? Marquis
Dear Christians, enemies of YHWH love telling lies about His children. The world likes to POSIT that you are UNINTELLIGENT. Stop BELIEVING that your FAITH has to TAKE a rather front seat to REASON. Belief comes first, but YHWH has also given the capacity…to explain it. Marquis
Dear Christians, don’t be quick to judge another’s desperate BEHAVIOR. It is RARE that one considers the morality of their DECISIONS when their PROVISIONS have not been MET, and they haven’t been given ADEQUATE INSTRUCTION in…CONSTRUCTING prayers. Marquis
Dear Christians, as HECKLERS make fun of you for showing that you are serious about sanctifying, don't be DUMBSTRUCK as you look UP and notice that MANY claim to BE...fellow MEMBERS. Marquis
Dear Christians, REMEMBER that Yeshua was a TEACHER and a CARPENTER; thus, HE was too skilled with His hands. As DISCIPLES, YOURS are a necessary tool, as well as your arms. There are people who need touching and HUGGING…convincing that you aren’t trying to MUG them. Marquis
Dear Christians, Prolonged depression could be mental illness. It is foolish to STAY in BED, DREADING to touch the floor, and SAY to yourself, “I’m just really sad and can’t SHAKE it off”. You' are no less of a CHRISTIAN in ADMITTING that you might need…psychiatric help. Marquis
Dear Christians, Chanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, COMMEMORATES a REDEDICATION in the month of Kislev. Jerusalem’s Second Temple was DESECRATED by the GREEKS in 167 BC. The HOLIDAY is observed for eight days, as a reminder of when the Jews were not…ACCOMODATED. Marquis
Dear Christians, “FAITHLESSNESS” sounds soft when received by the EARS, but the TEARS that will follow from those receiving reproof from the King of RIGHTEOUSNESS, will be EVIDENCE of its damaging DISPOSITION…endure in OPPOSITION. Marquis
Dear Christians, even though you have been FREED from the bondage of SLAVERY, the residue still remains, thus the STRAINS of the disciple to RERAIN from old sinful ways…while walking. Marquis
Dear Christians, JOURNEYS to the past can be painful, depending on what you're returning to. It's a sad COMMENTARY that not everyone had an agreeable upbringing, but still if one looks hard enough they’ll find something USUABLE in IMPROVING another’s...present or future. Marquis
Dear Christians, there are also singers in the Body of Yeshua and their voices are vital for healing and PREPARATION. Give them the SATISFACTION of recognizing their gift and…CONTRIBUTION to the Church. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH does have the power to keep your enemies at bay while your’re serving HIM in the KINGDOM; but, while He is omniscient, and thus knows EVERYTHING, if you want a safe haven then you still must pray…in the name of the KING. Marquis
Dear Christians, when the eyes of your heavenly FATHER are on you for GUARDING there should BE solace and SERENITY because you have a God who loves you because of your shared IDENTITY…with the Messiah. Marquis
Dear Christians, discouragement comes in many forms from the world. Putting doubts into the minds of Yeshua’s disciples is one FORM. Causing THEM to QUESTION their denoucement of cultural NORMS with accusations of arrogance. DISMISS them before you began…REMINISCING. Marquis
Dear Christians, in what ways are your daily lives, daily offerings to YHWH? An offering is something in your possession, which you give up to someone else. YHWH instructs for the purpose of SUBMISSION. You obey to retain your POSITION in the Kingdom. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, FRIENDS are not cheap COMMODITIES and the term shouldn’t be used so LOOSELY. Just because they know your name and a few of your interests that doesn’t mean that you should trust them INTIMATELY. What’s MISSING is the SHARING…of lives. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH can use a non-believer to accomplish HIS plans; He IS, after all, Ruler of the whole EARTH, and not just of those who have been…RE-BIRTHED into the Christian faith. Marquis
@RyanPhillippe Ryan, if you're referring to Twitter, I don't understand why some of you actors allow others to have Twitter accounts in your name. Specifically, in answering your question, I would contact management directly, if you haven't already. 😀Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, excessive SIN will result in SATAN carrying you far AWAY from the PLACE of righteousness. Once removed, your SPIRIT will not enjoy its new RESIDENCE, though your flesh MIGHT…from what HEIGHTS have you fallen. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Passover REQUIRED the SLAUGHTERING of a blemish free animal. Yeshua was a Passover LAMB, as His LIFESPAN included no SIN. No other person prior to HIM was eligible for the same TITLE...though the BIBLE contains a number of righteous who were close. Marquis
Dear Christians, because you’re a layperson and not a recognized leader, you do not have PERMISSION to just lie around. They weren’t COMMISSIONED to do all the work, while you WATCH- like a BLOT of stain, INELASTIC, doing nothing but...ruining the rest of the FABRIC. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, how BRAZEN to bring SIN into the Church BUILDING. YOU arrive TO CONTRIBUTE TO the latest GOSSIP, rather than FELLOWSHIP. On your agenda is lustfully catching the eye of him or her, rather than listening to the TEACHER…for FURTHER training. Marquis
Dear Christians, even LEADERS NEED encouraging words. It’s far EASIER to CRITICIZE-praising DEFIES human nature. How unfair not to build up or EXTOL persons whose jobs take a merciless TOLL on their BODIES, and then complain when they lack the ENERGY to LEAD…EFFECTIVELY. Marquis
Dear Christians, you struggle with the concept of TITHING because you find it financially BINDING; but, you forget that YHWH OWNS it all and what you do have is on LOAN. BE grateful that HE allows you to retain a PLURALITY…of His possessions. Marquis
Dear Christians, with the Holy Spirit dwelling within in you, your insight into spiritual matters is KEENER, but you still have to intentionally FOCUS- else you’ll BE stuck with marginal ABILILTY to GLEAN…from the SURFACE. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Hebrew calendar was based, in part, on an AGRARIAN cycle, with Nisan BEING the first month. Yeshua understood THIS, and thus HIS parables used allusions that were relatable…to the POPULACE. Marquis
@ChrisEvans I enjoyed the video, Chris. I too am an animal lover. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is nothing inherently wrong with having a ROLE MODEL, so long as they do not become your IDOL- leading you to ABANDON…the SECOND COMMANDMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Bible does record the names of a NUMBER of MOTHERS. Those who wrote the books of the Tanakh did live in patriarchal times, but these men of the Jewish FAITH did not HATE…women. Marquis
Dear Christians, standing up for yourself doesn’t suggest that you’re in love with conflict. You BELIEVE that turning the other CHEEK allows others to ABUSE YOU as if they were given a blank check? Your impoverished thinking is the REASON…you remain MISTREATED. Marquis
Dear Christians, uncomfortable with the idea of serving in the ARMY of the Lord? Is it the TERMINOLOGY? “I would rather serve the Prince of Peace.” BE ASSURED, they're the same PERSON. HE never spoke of a life FREE of STRUGGLES...the early disciples had TROUBLES. Marquis
Dear Christians, VACILLATING THINKING is unhealthy, but SOMETIMES it is WISE to change your MIND after receiving additional INFORMATION regarding a specific SITUATION. Remain fixed on a decision on principle ALONE…and buffoonery is SHOWN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Godhead expects servants OF YHWH to tithe. Yes, it's an act of LOVE, and, yes, you have a choice. But, when you withhold the Most High’s ten PERCENT, you're walking in DISOBEDIENCE. No one is EXEMPT from this financial SUM…regardless of INCOME. Marquis
Dear Christians, Senior PASTORS are indeed the SHEPHERDS of the CHURCH and should be respected as SUCH. Failure to obey whom the Lord has placed as temporal head of the local assembly is disobedience to the Lord himself. Where is the HONOR in your…IMPROPRIETY? Marquis
Dear Christians, WHO misinformed YOU in teaching that your success in life and your lifestyle are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE? Do you believe that because you’re under the grace of the CROSS that you can still behave like the LOST- AD NAUSEM without ADMONISHMENT?...ASTONISHING. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you’ve been CALLED to marriage, ensure spiritual COMPATIBILITY. Too many HAUL themselves down the aisle without taking sufficient INVENTORY of each other’s life STORY to determine if they’re on the same PAGE…or are the same Christian AGE. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is nothing wrong with a public declaration that you require YHWH’s help, if true. You’re not sounding cymbals for ATTENTION at the MENTION of His name when not in private, unless your heart is there- OTHERWISE…refuse to listen to LIES. Marquis
Dear Christians, you have an obligation to monitor the behaviors of your siblings; if you find any STRAYING, don’t turn your head the other WAY in disgust. Face them directly and firmly remind them of their CONFESSION…determined to leave an IMPRESSION. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, SIN is your common ENEMY. Perchance, does it keep WINNING because as an ARMY you’re ill versed in TACTICS and so, as a PRACTICE, sin crushes you in every battle? There’s no NEED for constant DEFEAT if you’ll just COMMIT to READING…the NEW TESTAMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, When families fight there are generally no survivors, as members are skilled in going below the BELT; and as the acuteness is FELT the reactions are equally disastrous. At the conclusion there is nothing left but BAD BLOOD, and…MATTED MUD. Marquis
Dear Christians, an honest assessment of spiritual obstacles in your path to completed SANCTIFICATION would be APPRECIATED by the SPIRIT if you’re having difficulty HEARING, and thus STEERING CLEAR…of sin. Marquis
Dear Christians, overly concerned WITH all details of all days of all persons, you are WRITHING in no PEACE. By chance, could YHWH have delivered you a blow? It is REST your mind NEEDS, so it is BEST to CONFESS what brought you this unpleasant…BREEZE. Marquis.
Dear Christians, the fear of the Lord is missing from many members of Yeshua’s Body. Lions are lovely and can be TAME, and despite the beauty of their MANE, their roars, when warning…are dreadful. Marquis
Dear Christians, when you’re surrounded by foes, appeal to your heavenly Father for RESCUE…and to USE YOU. Marquis
Dear Christians, if CURRENTLY under the DISCIPLINING hand of the Lord and you’re wanting Him to RELENT, then REPENT and refuse to return to those EVENTS that SENT His hand…to BEGIN with. Marquis
Dear Christians, adequate PREPARATION for whatever the future may bring shows an EDUCATION in wisdom. Waiting until the last minute to execute what was prepared the minute before isn’t CLEVER, but physically…SEVERING. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU WHO enjoy the REPUTATION of being AUTHORITARIAN, consider your demeanor in light of your discipleship. Yeshua was a leader and, yes, was firm when fitting, but He wasn’t abusive, and thus was more effective in ACCOMPLISHING…you are DEMOLISHING. Marquis
Dear Christians, much controversy EXISTS over the ORIGINS of the Queen of Sheba, with some SPECULATING that perhaps she was from the Horn of Africa, and others POSITING that it was modern day Yemen. Avoid emotional BIAS and focus on the…FACTS. Marquis
Dear Christians, King Solomon took a solemn approach in dealing with those whom had been conquered. The MEN were CONSCRIPTED into manuel labor; among them were the HITTITES, AMORITES, and PERIZZITES…nations COMPRISING iniquity. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua WAS a peace OFFERING to YHWH, CAUSING the enmity between Him and mankind to officially END. Once AGAIN, the Old and New Testaments are COMPLIMENTARY in telling the complete STORY…of the Son of Man. Marquis
Dear Christians, HISTORICALLY, JERUSALEM was not a CITY on the MOVE until it later became a major hub of BUSINESS. You MISS out on the RICHNESS of Israel as a place not INTENDED for romanticizing by neglecting to INVESTIGATE some of its past domestic…UNDERTAKINGS. Marquis
Dear Christians, wherever you GO, the Church FOLLOWS; as you are a part of it, it TOO is a part of YOU. Be AWARE and take greater CARE of ensuring that others have the correct VIEW of a gathering for the OUTCAST that YESHUA did not intend to receive constant…BACKLASH. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH is OMNIPRESENT…dwell on IT. Marquis
Dear Christians, perhaps you think YHWH’s standards for holiness are too HIGH…WHY? Marquis
Dear Christians, working alone in the Kingdom is counterproductive and contrary to the teachings of the King. There is too much to DO for any to MISCONSTRUE the job DESCRIPTION of the CHRISTIAN- you are to help REDEEM…as a TEAM. Marquis
Dear Christians, walking with the Lord doesn’t assure a LIFE free of STRIFE. Know that on the RIGHT road there are still rocks and holes that believers will stumble over and fall into because of growing PAINS- and then there’s still…the RAIN. Marquis
@TheDannyPino @TVLine @MichaelAusiello Danny, I too am looking forward to watching. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, the OMNIPOTENCE of YHWH is under-discussed in some circles and questioned too much in others. In either INSTANCE, it doesn’t make Him any LESS all-powerful. TRY to find comfort, but also SOBRIETY in this characteristic…of the Most High. Marquis
Dear Christians, your temple is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, and because it is in need of repairs, keep out of the Spirit’s way. “Your will be done”, should be done with as the Spirit is LEADING and you are FEEDING, and then displaying…fruit. Marquis
Dear Christians, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who were EVENTUALLY grafted into Jacob’s immediate FAMILY for legal purposes. Read the Bible to learn how PROPERTY was DISTRIBUTED among the EARLY…HEBREW PEOPLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, What do the terms, “brothers and sisters” in Messiah mean to you? Are they CUTE EUPHEMISMS, or are they deeper in meaning? To be CERTAIN, if you’re a CHRISTIAN, your heavenly Father doesn’t view your child relationship with Him as “cute”…be ASTUTE. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you are an EMPLOYER, please REMEMBER that in REALITY you are no more valuable than your EMPLOYEES. You may have a greater title and a higher SALARY, but before the One whom you all serve, you are loved and are expected to honor…EQUALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, you don’t always have a choice in PROJECTS EXPECTED to be completed, and it is tempting to cry foul when you’ve drawn the shortest stick. But challenges can BE REWARDING if you stick to them; learn to embrace and you won’t succumb to…BITTERNESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, order results in efficiency. If given a task with multiple steps as a large group, division of labor is undoubtedly wiser, allowing for less cloudy thinking. As long as all share the same mission, there is no HARM in HARMONIZING…with your co-workers. Marquis
Dear Christians, if a PARENT, THEN what you PASS on to your sons and daughters should BE PREDOMINATELY spiritual in nature, for it is EVERLASTING; material goods should be SECONDARY and should not leave your children…SEDENTARY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, you admit that Yeshua is King of kings, but in what ways is it OBVIOUS that He is Ruler of your life? You are a citizen of His KINGDOM. How do you show that He has DOMINION? Marquis
Dear Christians, civility DICTATES that the utter decimation of your ENEMIES is utterly UNNECESSARY; Love MANDATES that you offer REDEMPTION. This shouldn’t be beyond COMPREHENSION for the former spiritual convict…now CHRISTIAN. Marquis
Dear Christians, consoling does not come naturally to everyone, so you should not PURSUE everyone when a crisis comes to YOU; for you just may get your feelings HURT when they do not SHOW OVERT gestures of empathy…because they can’t. Marquis
Dear Christians, there are myriads suffering in bondage while passerbyers simply smile in passing; sometimes it’s because those suffering are simply smiling BACK-because they LACK…FORTITUDE to show the TRUTH. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s majesty is unrivaled on Earth, so why try to MATCH by ATTACHING your name to lights in the SKY and ATTRACTING the BLIND; THOUGH in doing SO, they only receive partial SIGHT… while living in the NIGHT. Marquis
Dear Christians, “legalism”, is a lousy defense as to why you don’t take the commands of Yeshua literally. Choosing to view all His teachings as metaphorical so you don’t have to actually obey what you feel is DISCONCERTING…is DISTURBING. Marquis
Dear Christians, you and YHWH MAY share the same goals, but desire different paths of reaching them. Put your plans AWAY, no matter how appealing, because your heavenly Father is looking at the bigger PICTURE, and His vision is…CLEARER. Marquis
Dear Christians, it was Aaron’s rod, not Moses’s, that was first used to capture Pharaoh’s attention and to deliver the first three PLAGUES. These DAYS MOSES GETS all the CREDIT, though he had COMPANIONS who helped…shoulder his BURDENS. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, there are several DIFFERENCES between the Old and New COVENANTS. Perhaps a central distinction involves the parties to whom the two were offered. The original extended to those delivered from Egypt; the modified…to the REST who were born in BONDAGE. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically speaking, the number nine refers to prosperity. You would be wise to focus on spiritual AFFLUENCE before attempting to acquire wealth…to INFLUENCE others. Marquis
Dear Christians, MIGHT is not found in the HEIGHTS of men and women, but in their armor worn. The Helmet of Salvation grants firmness to the mind so that those wearing it, while not seeking it, don’t mind the heat of battle, which threatens to soften FACULTIES…GRADUALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, public DISPLAYS of SHAME may or may not warrant gloating by spectators- it depends upon the REASON for disgrace. Was he or she TREASONOUS? Don’t hasten to TEARS when the culprit…deserves to be JEERED. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, GENERATIONS are lagging with spiritual lethargy- they’ve lacked the power of the Holy Spirit. Where there’s no power, all that’s left is POTENTIAL, which is INCONSEQUENTIAL when it comes to a working disciple who needs ENERGY…ESPECIALLY in this CENTURY. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, HUSBANDS WHO mistreat their wives are too INTO themselves. They are uninterested in the welfare of their spouse, thus their RESPONSES are focused on receiving their own WANTS, while she regularly goes…without. Marquis
Dear Christians, SO, you are the head of your HOUSEHOLD. How do you define it? Are you INSPIRING? Or…are you a TYRANT? Marquis
Dear Christians, the ROLE of the earthly father is more complex than the way it’s often carried out. To PROVIDE masculine strength? YES. To give masculine GUIDANCE? Still TRUE; but these are just…a FEW. Marquis
Dear Christians, relatives can BE TAXING due to PERSONALITY CONFLICTS, but all of your INTERACTIONS don’t have to resemble war scene DEPICTIONS. Take time to accept them for who they ARE and your relationships will go…FARTHER. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, SONS are not DESTINED for lust-filled lifestyles, and yet there ARE FATHERS in the CHURCH who prepare them for SUCH in providing IMAGERY of SULTRY figures; their GROOMING is ABUSIVE and INTRUSIVE, and shouldn’t ELUDE…authorities. Marquis
Dear Christians, newborns are supposed to bring joy to their parents, not heartache. If you struggle with your emotions IN DEALING with INFANCY, classes in REARING will result in fewer parenting INFRACTIONS…like unseemly FRACTURES. Marquis
Dear Christians, Asher, a tribe of Israel, was located around an area in GALILEE; a lesson in GEOGRAPHY will benefit a disciple of YESHUA, who SHOULD be able to recognize, on a map, key LOCATIONS of Biblical…SIGNIFICANCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, the origins of man is worth investigating. ANTHROPOLOGY is FRIENDLY and the Christian’s FAMILY TREE extends beyond Adam and EVE. Earlier civilizations had their part to play in YHWH’S worldy drama. You will feel more SOLID with your…acquired KNOWLEDGE. Marquis
Dear Christians, disorder is NEEDED to disrupt CONTENTMENT with ill-deserved COMPLANCENCY; a shock to the system SELF-SATISFIED with what it used to IDENTIFY as SIN, but has since given IN to its…VIOLENCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s JUDGEMENTS are CERTAIN. OVERSENTIMENTALITY is an unhealthy SCENCE and your decision to view the MOST HIGH as an endless SUPPLY of love without regard to obedience is certainly a foolish ONE…to be BLUNT. Marquis
Dear Christians, what are you examining while reading SCRIPTURE? What are you looking FOR? Is it an EXCUSE to justify your personal beliefs…or is it the TRUTH? Marquis
Dear Christians, Age isn't always the best indicator of leadership POTENTIAL. Above all, wisdom is ESSENTIAL, and while it should increase as one grows older, the root is experience. There are young whose harsh LIFE has induced them, HENCE, to APPLY earlier…good SENSE. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, who rejoices over the SINS of their ancestors? If your tongue doesn’t sing the praises of such poison, what of your FEET? Do you BELIEVE the way you live showcases, BLISSFULLY, the product of your past…or the soberness of your salvation? Marquis
Dear Christians, when one has lived their life well there is nothing wrong with honoring their virtues by re-telling their deeds. Perhaps some will hear and their hearts will SOFTEN…giving a fresher fragrance to what is currently…ROTTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, in your conversations with the world, how often do you credit YHWH for His works? What about Yeshua, or the Holy Spirit? How are others to form an opinion about the GODHEAD, when your silence speaks for you INSTEAD? They might as well be…DEAD. Marquis
Dear Christians, DIPLOMACY is not dereliction of one’s Christian DUTY to show strength toward your ENEMIES- it is not APPEASEMENT. But, when given the option of life or death, the former is the better one; and yet it can’t be ACHIEVED if your enemy won’t be…RECEIVED. Marquis
Dear Christians, use discernment when engaging in leisure and ignore updated forms of divination, which would place your trust in anything or one other than YHWH. You MAY find them ENTERTAINING, but your spirit is becoming…RECHAINED. Marquis
Dear Christians, Secular governments exist to carry out YHWH's will. You don't live in a theocracy where only your God’s LAWS exist for order’s SAKE, which as a believer you should be DRAWN to ANYWAY. A society can't function in CHAOS, where the LOST are…free to revel. Marquis
Dear Christians, evildoing in places of AUTHORITY must never be celebrated by those who are subordinate. SUPPORTING in any form is an example of faithlessness and those who ENJOY must reconcile such…with their Christian EMPLOYMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHY is there no OUTCRY over the sieging of the Church’s riches? There was a time when love welcomed all and members’ patterns of living EXHIBITED DEFINTITE allegiance to Messiah- the founder of the FAITH…where are the OUTRAGED? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, not all TRADITIONS of the early Church are dismissable; just because they did it is an insufficient explanation as to why churches of today are no LONGER; the “FATHERS” were successful in many of their ENDEAVORS…try reading some of their LETTERS. Marquis
Dear Christians, rebuilding the ASSEMBLY is a skilled ACTIVITY that those just out of the gate have yet to develop PROFICIENCY in. You who are called to TEACH in the FAITH must MAKE it your BUSINESS to TAKE EACH NOVICE and compell them…to become competent. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, the WEAPONS of spiritual warfare include the SWORD, which is the WORD of YHWH. You keep failing in your battles with the Enemy, not because your weapon is dull, but because you perceive it that WAY- so on your shelf it STAYS, while the Enemy is…SLAYING. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, in a SENTENCE, there will be nothing LESS than SILENCE from Heaven in the area where you reside…where there is no REPENTANCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, following in the footsteps of UNRIGHTEOUSNESS will ensure you receive the same JUSTICE. Why walk replicating perverse depictions of Christianity when Scripture provides the appropriate model? Yeshua did not move…like those in modernity. Marquis
Dear Christians, just because you petition YHWH, it doesn’t MEAN HE is going to SAY, “Yes”. Stop assuming you’re going to get what you want when you haven’t examined your motives, and you won’t become so discouraged that you no longer even BOTHER…with the FATHER. Marquis
Dear Christians, for safety reasons, when disaster strikes and you must pick up and just go, avoid foolishness in looking back to SEE what you are LEAVING BEHIND- every second counts and your TIES will BIND you there to STAY…and there you will LAY. Marquis
Dear Christians, there's no need for histrionics when you're in need; it’s in the BEST INTEREST of no one because in the moment you WEAKEN your AUDIENCE- DECREASING their TOLERANCE level. Your performance is quite COMPELLING- but, leave the SMELLING salts…alone. Marquis
Dear Christians, when making a request of a NEIGHBOR, CONSIDER the circumstances and always choose MODESTY…over FLATTERY. Marquis
Dear Christians, good listening skills include eye CONTACT. Make it a HABIT not to look AWAY when ENGAGING. Proper communication can’t OCCUR if you PREFER shifting where you are LOOKING while the other is…RELAYING. Marquis
Dear Christians, what sins DO YOU still cling TO? Unless you suffer from mental illness, you’re making a MOCKERY of CHRISTIANITY by claiming to have died to SIN…while still LIVING IN it. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, are you a fair-weather FRIEND? When it gets cold out do you run IN, while your COMPANION is left to freeze? When the rain pours, do you bolt to nearest SHELTER for the BETTER? What will become of them? Where did you get your DEFINITION…of FRIENDSHIP? Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, REBELLION is no light affair. Turning against family- kingdoms, when unwarranted, is REPREHENSIBLE and INDEFENSIBLE. Your loved ones are now EXASPERATED at your EXAGGERATED…decision. Marquis
Dear Christians, lying LIPS extend good TIPS, but leave a bad taste in the mouth of the receivers. The problem is that, often, the disagreeable sensation is unnoticed until what has been EXTENDED has placed a DENT on the BODY…now THROBBING. Marquis
Dear Christians, when wicked rulers are EXPOSED they should no longer IMPOSE their wanton deeds on the MASSES; for suffering EXISTS at the sight of those on high “getting away with murder”…while remaining in such LOFTINESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, laypersons, who are not professionally equipped to minister, can still SERVE. Church leaders throw CURVE balls WHEN INSINUATING that one must have a degree to be effective. So, they are not on STAFF…why LAUGH? Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically, the number TWO speaks TO confirmation. Consider that solo encounters offer little credibility, but the truth is STRENGTHENED with an ADDITION. When you have a serious word to speak, bring someone else ALONG- to help move BEYOND…doubt. Marquis
Dear Christians, a nation’s moral climate is governed by its SEAT. SEEDS of corruption are sown in the HALLS of LAWS due to apathy or lust for SELF- at the expense of everyone ELSE. After its temperature has been taken, take control of the LAND…while it's still STANDING. Marquis
Dear Christians, when illness strikes you’d do well to turn to YHWH for remedy and if so the Spirit points to temporal medicines be wise and PARTAKE- while FAILING to neglect the signs which would NAVIGATE to more intense CARE…a message for the CAVALIER. Marquis
Dear Christians, seasons can CHANGE unexpectedly and WHATEVER REIGNS supreme in your life will topple with the WEATHER, whether your’re prepared…or not. Marquis
Dear Christians, your PRESENCE is a REQUIREMENT in a local assembly. Staying HOME- ALONE is not an option, as YOU have no VALUE there. You’ve already been given a general invitation, but you were not asked to RSVP…INTENTIONALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, do not entertain any notions that you aren’t expendable. You're useful so long as you're walking with the Lord. But, in the KINGDOM there's SOMEONE who's committed to the CAUSE, but hasn't been CALLED up front. Keep SINNING and you’re out…and they're IN. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU WHO are young must submit to your parent’s authority. You have not yet arrived at the age allowing you to tell them, “No”. Refusing to honor is flagrant VIOLATION of the fifth COMMANDMENT…and now your life will be SHORTENED. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblical numbers have meaning- three stands for HOLINESS. REFRAIN from COZY friendships exuding warmth, but emitting no life. You are to REMAIN DETACHED from the world…with its DISTRACTIONS. Marquis
Dear Christians, what you have built up will come crashing DOWN when you step outside the BOUNDARIES the Father and Son have ESTABLISHED; and when you’ve been BANISHED from your EASE, it would BE unwise to rebuild without first…reconsidering. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, as a token of your APPRECIATION how about offering a gift as a GESTURE. LESSER animosity would you encounter, even if mild, if you grasped that the desire to be affirmed is UNIVERSAL. No one likes…UNGRATEFULNESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, spiritual DEPRAVITY will result in temporal POVERTY. Robbing the Godhead of what they’re OWED will put you on a new ROAD leading to a dead END- and here, perhaps, you will remember all the time SPENT lying about your…loyalty. Marquis
Dear Christians, in the Tabernacle there was a veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of HOLIES. Read the Tanakh to learn the rest of the STORY and to gain greater awareness of the connection between that veil and the one that was torn after Yeshua…was burnt. Marquis
Dear Christians, Judgment Day is not dated on a false calendar. Yet not many believe it's REAL- based on their testimonies. While the exact time is CONCEALED, you’ll see. And when you stand before the throne, what will be said by He who SITS? Will you like….His COMMENTS? Marquis
Dear Christians, ACCURACY is not an ACCIDENTAL THEME in Scripture. The beauty in Solomon’s TEMPLE, for EXAMPLE, would not have been SEEN if plans had not been followed to a T. Take your CUE, then, from those WHO…built before YOU. Marquis
Dear Christians, you have the tasks of AIDING in BUILDING two TEMPLES- neither of which are SIMPLE to do. Your personal is your BODY and your corporate is the ASSEMBLY- both ought be built DILIGENTLY. And the first need not be DONE…before starting on the other ONE. Marquis
Dear Christians, acknowledging all participants on the TEAM won’t GUARANTEE VICTORY, but it will increase MORALE; your failing to do so is…IMMORAL. Marquis
Dear Christians, parents are to MIRROR the CHARACTER of Yeshua so their children know what it looks like. But the mirror is for grooming purposes, as well. Parents are to teach their children how to improve their own QUALITIES by...MODELING…without CODDLING. Marquis
Dear Christians, life must go ON when he or she has GONE. Homes must be cared for and jobs have to CONTINUE- persons still depend on YOU. Beds won’t give nourishment and sitting until you can no LONGER 'cause of the SORES now under will only CONFIRM...a new INFIRMITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, the seniors AMONG you are to have health PROBLEMS that those YOUNGER don’t have to BOTHER with. They are not children, but greater care must be AFFORDED if premature fatalities are to be THRWARTED; attend to them without stripping them…of their dignity. Marquis
Dear Christians, are you culpable when it comes to PERCEIVING salvation as FREE, as if no COST was associated with the CROSS? When you KNEEL, indeed a DEAL is being made INHERENTLY. You AGREE that in exchange for His life, yours now belongs to Him…a bartering SYSTEM. Marquis
Dear Christians, strength is an asset in the Body of Messiah. In these days it is another valuable that should be sought through prayer- DAILY. LOGICALLY, if you INQUIRED more you would ACQUIRE more, and your journey, with BATTLES, would leave you less…BAFFLED. Marquis
Dear Christians, it is not impossible to live a life of righteousness with the filling of the Holy Spirit. Mind you, it is not your power that enables VICTORY- SUPERNATURALLY, but the gift from YHWH; and Yeshua REQUIRES it…so seek to THRIVE with it. Marquis
Dear Christians, So you CONCEDE that CONCEIT has no place within the ASSEMBLY. Then why stand for your siblings’ snobbery outside Sunday’s WALLS? CALL them out. They were good enough to talk to during the 11am hour. What’s CHANGED? Why is there now…a new ARRANGEMENT? Marquis
Dear Christians, how long are your private deliberations, if you have any at all? Acting upon IMPULSE is REPULSIVE behavior. Your first thoughts are seldom the best ONES and most of your precipitous activities can’t be UNDONE. TAKE CONTEMPLATION…seriously. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, FORGIVENESS is not an option when approached with SINCERITY. “But, I am not READY”, is an insufficient EXCUSE for YOU who were yourselves forgiven by Messiah. At the right time? Yes. But, being a NEW creation, the time for YOU to forgive is always…now. Marquis
Dear Christians, who are you trying to IMPRESS with your INSISTENCE that you REMAIN ETCHED in the stones of buildings after you’ve LEFT? Is it your intention to encourage false WORSHIPPING or IDOLATRY? Please REFRAIN from endorsing your NAME when it isn’t…YHWH. Marquis
Dear Christians, details are instrumental when instructions are GIVEN, so learn to LISTEN CAREFULLY. It is an exercise in mental ACUITY. CASUALLY HEARING while your thoughts are WANDERING is not only LAZY, but could lead to an UNTIMELY and extended…RAINY season. Marquis
Dear Christians, does chaos flow through your VEINS, REIGNING supreme, leaving you DRAINED- STRAINING the air of those who share your space? Where is the PEACE from YHWH? INCREASE your requests for the ESSENTIALS to maintain…good MENTAL health. Marquis
Dear Christians, loved ones can induce such DEJECTION as to make darkness look like life’s chief OBJECTIVE; and it is not atypical to seek for your REMEDY something WRENCHING. But, why does not King David enter your THOUGHTS when you’re…thinking of DEPARTING? Marquis
Dear Christians, the broken and the BRUISED, the tattered and the USED, all need the healing touch of the Savior; so, when they enter your PRESENCE as GUESTS, be an EXAMPLE…showing each AMPLE welcome. Marquis
Dear Christians, why are you walking in EVERLASTING shame as if your heavenly Father never pardoned you for previous SEPARATION, which he did without HESITATION. Don’t allow others’ reminders of your PAST to keep you in a permanent CASTE…of disgrace. Marquis
Dear Christians, wickedness cannot remain concealed FOREVER. Crimes kept secret tend to surface sooner or LATER. Already known to your CREATOR, be assured that what’s buried under the EARTH can, on top of the same TURF, be RESURRECTED- so stop playing…RUSSIAN ROULETTE. Marquis
Dear Christians, egocentricism plagues the CONGREGATION. Such a CONCENTRATION on SELF leaves no room for anybody ELSE. How tragic that the sharp SPOTLIGHT SHINING inward fails to ENLIGHTEN your…SIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, YOU need help on the battlefield, as YOU are not personally equipped to fight in SOLITUDE. Stay cognizant of the TRUTH that YOU are a relational being that needs to learn how to relate if YOU are going to avoid being…SUBDUED. Marquis
Dear Christians, Generosity shouldn’t be so problematic to show. But, you say, “I’m not a generous mood”. MOODS are MUTABLE, while your spirit is connected to One who is FIXED. So, SKIP the sad EXCUSE- you WHO CONCLUDE that your feelings…matter. Marquis
Dear Christians, if you’re wanting in temporal SUSTENANCE, turn to the Assemby for ASSISTANCE. It isn’t the world’s job to provide for what's LACKING. But, at times you go without because you aren’t ASKING the right people. When you’re HURTING, turn FIRST…to the CHURCH. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH does not DWELL in a single earthly VESSEL, including a building, for He is omnipresent; and being in all places SIMULTANEOUSLY, He SEES CLEARLY the actions of all his CHILDREN…nothing is HIDDEN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Holy Scriptures CONTAIN distinct MANDATES that BELIEVERS AGREED to observe, though it is impossible to achieve SUCCESS without the Spirit’s…REFRESHING. Marquis
Dear Christians, as members of ROYALTY your influence is POTENTIALLY GLOBAL. While traveling, with the Son ever in front, remain SPIRITUALLY HEALTHY in keeping parts of your BODY bare, allowing better access to what needs to be SEEN, while the Son is still…CLEANING. Marquis
Dear Christians, Mishaps happen because the earth is in a fallen STATE, and so tons of MISTAKES are MADE. But when they transpire elect to learn and not wallow. Prevention is a safer TOOL to USE while rebuilding your temple, than is REACTIONS to your constant…ACCIDENTS. Marquis
Dear Christians, CHILDBEARING should begin with PRAYER. Just because you are ABLE, it doesn’t mean you are CAPABLE…of parenting. Marquis
Dear Christians, after you have made the decision to follow Yeshua, your temporal FAMILY should want to in-kind if they haven’t ALREADY. But, if they don’t, be wise regarding YOUR LORD, FOR He is your Master and they are not; REMEMBER…you SURRENDERED. Marquis
Dear Christians, life goes on after DEATH. When your loved one has taken their last BREATH it is APPROPRIATE to LAMENT, but don’t linger. As a child of YHWH it is certain that you’ll be reacquainted in the future, but for the PRESENT- stop SITTTING in prolonged…sulking. Marquis
Dear Christians, just because you HEAR it, doesn’t mean you should become ENDEARED to it, or you just may find yourself…INJURED. Marquis
Dear Christians, exhaustion is not a sign of cowardice. The bones and muscles in your body need RELIEF, and at times your cells need to BREATHE. What support can you offer your brothers and sisters when they CALL, if you can barely move…at ALL? Marquis
Dear Christians, even among those WHO do not proclaim TO dwell in the house of the Lord, do YOU have good REPUTE? Does any among them ACCUSE of IMMORALITY? ARE you LIKELY considered foul to the lost and THEREFORE treated…like a leper? Marquis
Dear Christians, DISGUISES are CONFINING. Extra energy is exerted when wearing a MASK, and your MASQUERADING is ENERVATING to those whose presence you center yourself around…while BOUND. Marquis
Dear Christians, you won’t always find yourself in the comforts of your home. For as you're GUIDED, some ENVIRONMENTS will bring less CONTENTMENT than others. The ground beneath will not give way because YOU are now someplace NEW. You are there for a REASON…CLEAVE it. Marquis
Dear Christians, DO not DO anything rash TO a rival of YHWH who MAY one DAY prove beneficial to the Kingdom. WHO you SEE PRESENTLY cannot DEFINITELY BE who you’ll see TOMORROW- SO, give them a CHANCE…to ENHANCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, you who wear the name of Yeshua on your personhood and are recognized as such by the general public, make it your BUSINESS to REPRESENT Messiah’s INTERESTS with candor and considerable resolve to resonate…His mission. Marquis
Dear Christians, SOPHISTRY is dangerous PHILOSOPHY to adhere to. The wisdom of man is inferior to the SPIRIT’s…so why depend on IT? Marquis
Dear Christians, why do you stare at the troubles you see, rather than turn upward? The nervousness slowly building up in your system will soon IMMOBOLIZE and through your EYES what now AILS…will now PREVAIL. Marquis
Dear Christians, at your lowest ensure that you have support from your family in MESSIAH, who should want to be by your SIDE during such solemn moments; their PROXIMITY is a NECESSITY…while you are GRIEVING. Marquis
Dear Christians, walk WITH CONFIDENCE as the Spirit leads you on this JOURNEY. Think of it as a TOURNAMENT that you are…DETERMINED to WIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, the weapons of spiritual WARFARE are potent and effective if you DARE to put them into effect. How about using the shield of faith, so that as arrows are flying TOWARD, what winds up BEFORE you will be…ABSORBED. Marquis
Dear Christians, KNOW that you have spiritual FOES plotting against you REPETIVELY, WAITING at the chance to infiltrate; and you who are UNAWARE and totally UNPREPARED will face TRAGEDY…ASSUREDLY. Marquis
@ChrisEvans Thanks for the rec., Chris. Marquis
Dear Christians, after you have been PROMOTED because of your job PERFORMANCE do not FORGET to show gratitude to YHWH, who provided the WAY. You PRAYED for it…but did you THANK Him for it? Marquis
Dear Christians, those who are on the open battle field facing direct PERSECUTION because of their UNION with Messiah need REASSURANCE that their present HINDRANCES aren’t eternal. They too require your PRAYERS…apart from your own AFFAIRS. Marquis
Dear Christians, melodies can be soothing if you’re listening to the right notes. Not all tunes should be tolerated, however. Know which music is harmful to your SPIRIT and choose not to go…near IT. Marquis
Dear Christians, do you LIE when speaking of your DISCIPLESHIP? Do people say you're “Born AGAIN” because of what you’ve spoken to THEM, though your ACTIONS LACK? Do your speeches garner silent applause? YOU WHO love others hearing it…while inwardly grieving the Spirit. Marquis
Dear Christians, as warriors in the army of the Lord your strategy should be PREEMPTIVE. Do not GIVE your opponents a leg to stand and fight on. In its place, keep your hands out and be the FIRST to EXTEND…before they BEGIN CURSING you. Marquis
Dear Christians, how about some RECIPROCITY while expecting to RECEIVE from the Most High. A covenant involves more than one party and there are stipulations attached. Your choosing to ignore while spiritually BLIND doesn’t make it any less…BINDING. Marquis
Dear Christians, caution concerning WHO you turn TO when the going gets TOUGH. As if your current predicament wasn’t painful ENOUGH, you invite greater calamity when looking to the world for AID…DOWNGRADING your relationship with your heavenly Father. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is power in teams, rather than in CONSTANTLY exercising your INDIVIDUALITY. Your ENEMIES remain united in their quest for DOMINATION. While the Assembly of YHWH with numerous DENOMINATIONS remains largely UNGUARDED, and thus spiritually…RETARDED. Marquis
Dear Christians, while MISERY can BE attractive COMPANY, choose to surround yourself, instead, with PRAISE; and on some DAYS when your enery is telling you, “No”, say “Yes”, ANYWAY. Here you will find HEALING…DEFEATING what’s debilitating. Marquis
Dear Christians, consider the source when SEEKING ADVICE. Think TWICE about SPEAKING to “Joe” who has not sought wisdom from YHWH, or “Judy” who hasn’t EITHER. NEITHER one will tell you what is NEEDED, though both might tickle EARS with what you INDEED…want to HEAR. Marquis
Dear Christians, you should take OFFENSE when Yeshua’s IMAGE has been MARRED. The same SCARS placed upon the Head when members act UNNATURALLY are placed on the rest of the BODY…for the entire world to SEE. Marquis
Dear Christians, so you’re ANXIOUS over adversity BECAUSE you think you will crumble at the slightest HINT of DISAGREEMENT when relating to any other; your hearts pound SEVERELY when even HEARING of altercation. How odd…how jarring. Marquis
Dear Christians, deliberate DEFIANCE of YHWH is ALLIANCE with DARKNESS. As children of light whose associations with the DIM ought be LIMITED, quit yoking yourselves with the LOST as if you have never CROSSED paths with…the CROSS. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHY go back to where sin lives, like a moth to the flame, when yours already…DIED? Marquis
Dear Christians, the Ark of the COVENANT was a PERMANENT fixture, originally KEPT inside the Holy of HOLIES. However, it was not WORTHY of worship. Stay clear of believing that the cross hanging from your NECK itself is deserving of your…RESPECT. Marquis
Dear Christians, The leaders among you need to show CONSIDERATION for their well-being. Being in front of the CONGREGATION takes its TOLL, and you've been TOLD that your body isn't yours. To continue LEADING, listen to your PLEADING members when they tell you to…pause. Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH’s character was evident to the ISRAELITES through His provisions. Hannah’s, Samuel’s mother, BRIGHTNESS RETURNED after LEARNING of her stifled conception. After you have been provided FOR, are you still YEARNING for…MORE? Marquis
Dear Christians, where you come from, the PLACE you were born, does BEAR significance. Your roots should SHARE SPACE in your life as a WITNESS. Refuse to acknowledge and you will MISS connecting with someone. Your LIKENESS is a key in their ACCEPTANCE…of the Gospel. Marquis
Dear Christians, seldom thoughts on REDEMPTION will result in CONTENTION arising WITHIN. Giving up one’s LIFE by DYING in abject humiliation, though INNOCENT, MEANT forsaking friends, reputation, and above all- TRUTH…for the RUTHLESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, use strategy WHEN relating to others, THEN relationships will prove more ADVANCING because you are probably GRANTING persons the opportunity to remain ORIGINAL, and thus…VISIBLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, walking WISELY may require you to avoid looking so BLITHELY- REGULARLY, ESPECIALLY when that is not how you ACTUALLY…feel. Marquis
Dear Christians, famines come in many forms and the CONGREGATION is currently suffering from STARVATION. While there are some whose scant diet does include milk and bread, the former is spoiled and the latter STALE- you who are also…confined to BRAILLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, If DECLARED that you will DO, expect others to believe YOU. You AIRED it, and perhaps with little thought. Learn when to keep your hands down because you cannot do it ALL; and since the BALL never entered your hands to begin, you are unlikely…to drop it. Marquis
Dear Christians, responding to the call of DUTY on behalf of the ASSEMBLY involves correcting misperceptions that those outside have and ASSERT. Your not wanting to get HURT is insufficient reason to evade…wrangling. Marquis
Dear Christians, intimacy with Emmanuel should be CONTINUOUS because of His SELFLESS act on the cross. To take one unloveable because of their condition and WED anyway, as he BLED tiresomely, is a DECISION worthy of more than DERISION, as relayed through your…polygamy. Marquis
Dear Christians, each member of the FLOCK has a PART to FULFILL while climbing UPHILL- not one of which is of lesser value than any other. After adequate preparation, participate while ASCENDING. All others, stop DEFENDING…inactivity. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically SPEAKING, names had MEANING. For example, Adam comes from the Hebrew word for blood- giving readers insight into his nature. Naturally, the Bible would become more relatable if those READING would CONCEDE that deeper STUDYING…is FURTHERING. Marquis
Dear Christians, your emotions must never saturate your BODY so that your FACULTIES are inoperable. While strong sentiments can indeed be virtuous, they become vicive when detached from the HEAD. INSTEAD, balance is BEST…more or LESS. Marquis
Dear Christians, it takes strength to go against the GRAIN when others insist on SUSTAINING the STATUS QUO; learn to say NO when those around attempt TO seduce YOU with softeness regarding your sanctification. Otherwise the Spirit’s conviction will become…unconvincing. Marquis
Dear Christians, the darkest clouds can produce rains for survival- it’s a matter of perspective. Choose not TO VIEW the world through the lenses of permanent DESPAIR, for THERE are not many worse choices one can make than seeing falling man as just broken…beyond REPAIR. Marquis
Dear Christians, heeding directives when they pertain to your LIVELIHOOD shouldn’t be MISUNDERSTOOD as suggestions, for there is a DIFFERENCE: Directives elicit DELIVERENCE, while suggestions evoke…weak gestures. Marquis
Dear Christians, governors come and go like the passing wind; and when they have left it's those who REMAIN who insist on encasing them in their BRAINS- now STAINED, as if the memory isn’t enough. Such practices are IDOLATROUS and UNLESS it ceases…your spirit sour. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, WHEN selecting those WHO will preside over YOU, two factors matter chiefly- Whether their moral performances align with Scripture, and does their tongue move you to act when it matters MOST, like after a spiritual or temporal illness…has been DIAGNOSED. Marquis
Dear Christians, you turn to YHWH to forgive your SINS, but THEN you arise from your knees, doing it AGAIN- and AGAIN, and AGAIN. Have you pondered over your PLIGHT? There's something not RIGHT about repeating the same TRANSGRESSION…and after such sincere CONFESSIONS.	Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, DECISIONS uninspired by genuine INSIGHT will turn your busy days into endless NIGHTS, and your LIFE will become a showcase of FOOLERY because you BELIEVED what man told YOU, instead of turning TO…YHWH. Marquis
Dear Christians, hospitality is a hallmark of Yeshua’s followers. Failure to extend with COMPASSION because of SELF-ABSORBTION conflicts with the traditions of the early CHURCH…BESMIRCHING the name of Messiah. Marquis
Dear Christians, there are times when CIVILITY is INEFFECTIVE. While spewing INVECTIVES is rather unbecoming, too much RIGIDITY results in your opponents not taking you SERIOUSLY. It takes passion to persuade ENEMIES of the ASSEMBLY to surrender…and submit. Marquis
Dear CHRISTIANS, your PROVISIONS are GUARANTEED, so long as you continue LEANING on your heavenly Father, with His expectations for holiness. However, once your departure is PROVEN by continual irreverent MOVEMENTS, what once was plentiful will be…no more. Marquis
Dear Christians, the creativity of the MOST HIGH is UNDENIABLE. Nature ATTESTS to the MAJESTIC make-up of the Earth. Consider praising Him on a regular basis for His artwork- for YHWH is not a God who expects His servants to serve…solely. Marquis
Dear Christians, female leaders are not un-Biblical. Deborah was a sitting judge of Israel for a season, chosen by YHWH to impart wisdom and DIRECTION to a suffering people. Let none condone the MISPERCEPTION that females may only FILL MENIAL roles in serving…the Body. Marquis
Dear Christians, one day the nations will face judgment by the SON OF MAN. At His COMMAND persons of every country will bow, acknowledging His REIGN. Why COMPLAIN now of a rigid Ruler, whose death bought your FREEDOM…allowing you residence inside His KINGDOM? Marquis
Dear Christians,		Covenants are typically BINDING. When they are made with enemies of the Christian STATE, whom YHWH HATES, those who SIGNED in disobedience, as their behavior INDICATES, should expect nothing less…than the Lord’s most destructive fury.		Marquis
Dear Christians, WARS are fought FOR reasons that are most unattractive. And when all is said and done, those reasons will be forgotten as lives resume normally. But, if you are called then you must respond, and with FERVOR…if you expect to FURTHER your cause. Marquis
@BarackObama Mr. Obama, I hope you are doing well these days now that you are no longer President. I pray for you daily.  Marquis
@TheDannyPino Danny, I enjoyed watching your character on SVU. Why did you leave? Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime Chris, I like watching your show, but as a male survivor of child rape, I really wish you wouldn't limit your vocal outrage to female victims only. You speak of your wife and daughters, I can understand why. But, males have and do suffer too. Thanks, Marquis
@terrencehoward @EmpireFOX Terrence, looking forward to the new season. Marquis
Dear Christians, why expect a loving Father not to discipline DISOBEDIENCE amid cries of an Old TESTAMENT God- whose character hasn’t changed and who woudn’t tolerate a NEGLIGENT earthly PARENT. If He blesses those who obey, then why WON’T He punish those who…DON’T? Marquis
Dear Christians, Your battles needn’t be PERSONAL as you follow LOYALLY behind the Prince of Peace. LEARN to TURN the other CHEEK, so to SPEAK, and commit your enemies to YHWH, who has a better WAY of dealing with them…ANYWAY. Marquis
Dear Christians, after continuously giving your BEST it is time to…REST. Marquis
Dear Christians, do you find yourself struggling with SHARING those items you CARE most about? Such behavior isn’t indicative of just children, but of believers who place PARTY above human COMRADERY. Yes, you earned YOURS, but sometimes the POOR just need…help. Marquis
Dear Christians, passing PREJUDGEMENTS before weighing all the EVIDENCE, so that the ACCUSED is PRESUMED guilty at the first announcement is unloving and an exhibition of INSENSITIVITY- your lack of EMAPTHY…is telling. Marquis
@LeoDiCaprio Leonardo, I've been following the causes that you've given a voice to, and am grateful for actors like yourself who take time out of their professional life to assist those whose own voices aren't as effective. Marquis
Dear Christians, there are PLENTY OF CITIES, both near and afar, that are DESPERATE for Christ’s REFLECTION. If called by the Spirit, will you exchange your life for the CHANCE to ENHANCE a grieving SOUL…who has yet to be TOLD the Good News? Marquis
Dear Christians, when GIVEN a COMMISSION to complete, such as what the Head of the Church has tasked His Body to do, it is incumbent upon members to DEMONSTRATE their FAITH through movement, and not with the GAIT that will result in…STAGNATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, if the Most High is trustworthy in following through on His WORD then it is ABSURD for you who sit low to RENEGE on your DECISION to walk in the footsteps of His HIGH PRIEST…so CEASE with VACILLATING in your DAILY conduct. Marquis
Dear Christians, the tribe of Joseph PROPHETICALLY represents the future Gentile nations GRACIOUSLY grafted into the olive TREE. Understanding Biblical PROPHECY is KEY to interpreting the intended relationship between the native and wild STOCK…that some choose to BALK. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Bible is a historical DOCUMENT CEMENTING the area given to the ISRAELITES. It isn't RIGHT that confusion ensues among the POPULACE regarding THIS topic. Though, ACKNOWLEDGING doesn't excuse WRONGDOING done to those who believe DIFFERENTLY…SINCERELY. Marquis
Dear Christians, an INHERITANCE typically disregards MERIT, but that doesn’t suggest zero expectations…following the ACCEPTANCE. Marquis
@dicapriofdn @LeoDiCaprio Leonardo, thank you for your dedication to wildlife preservation. Marquis
Dear Christians, consecration is an ACUTE process that all who have their sentence COMMUTED must undergo. Though you are not aware of what's transpiring UNDERNEATH, this gift, non-BEQUEATHED, is indeed arduous and your habitual praise to the LORD of Lords...is in ORDER. Marquis
Dear Christians, even persons in POWER find themselves facing trials and tribulations every NOW and again. The grass is not always as GREEN on the “other” side as you find yourself BELIEVING every so often; so it is BEST to keep your presumptions…RESTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, it is the inflexibility of the hardened heart that makes it USELESS, and UNLESS mercy is extended, its vessel will sadly be at dangerous ODDS…at the hands of an angry GOD. Marquis
Dear Christians, darkness is an enemy of LIGHT and hordes of those living inside enjoy the HEIGHTS of their depravity; they will SCOLD you for your OPPOSING choices. Simply stand your ground and watch as those who stand theirs TUMBLE...STUMBLING over their own rhetoric. Marquis
@TheDannyPino @RDR_NYC Danny, glad to see you are an animal lover. Marquis
Dear Christians, allowing yourself to become victimized by deception is a sign of MENTAL and SPIRITUAL LAZINESS. When presenting your REQUESTS before YHWH’s throne, include DISCERNMENT…otherwise you will continue to LEARN the hard way. Marquis
Dear Christians, FOOLS don’t USUALLY assess a situation before making a decision and then acting upon it. On the CONTRARY, they are often HASTY and only after the dust has settled from the fouled AIR, is an evaluation conducted- to some’s consternation…to THEIR ruin. Marquis
Dear Christians, though the tribe of JUDAH was chosen as the one from which YESHUA of Nazareth would derive His earthly lineage, it was far from perfect. REFRAIN from placing man on an unwarranted pedestal. Not only does it scream of INHUMANENESS…it too is IDOLATROUS. Marquis
Dear Christians, the DAWN of each day SPAWNS new ideas and renewed VITALITY. ACTUALLY, the morning should also reinvigorate spiritually, as you begin with prayer and reflective READING…reminding yourself that Christianhood is a state of BEING. Marquis
Dear Christians, Your heavenly FATHER is also your PROTECTOR who wants to maintain your safety by holding at bay persons CONSPIRING to drag you through unholy FIRE- MAYBE because of ENVY…PERHAPS they’re just LAPSE in general morality. Marquis
Dear Christians, taking up arms is an unpleasant ENDEAVOR; there ARE losers on both sides. On one stands VICTORY EQUALLY brandishing emotional wounds. On the other lies defeat...and without an opportunity to REPENT in the EVENT they were destined for a lower place. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically, the number twelve means GOVERNMENT. Although YHWH did not originally CONSENT to earthly kings, you are to nevertheless regard them with RESPECT…not NEGLECTING your duties to spiritually INTERVENE when you PERCEIVE the necessity. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is an appropriate FEAR of the Lord that is helpful to SHEEP who apparently must WEEP from His rod, in light of the fact that SHEER love proves insufficient in…KEEPING them from wandering. Marquis
@ceciliaofbruns1 @CuomoPrimeTime @ceciliaofbruns1, Thank you, likewise. Marquis
@terrencehoward Terrence, I saw you on Live with Kelly and Ryan this morning, what a novel idea with geometric lamps- shapes for lighting! Congratulations, and good luck with your latest endeavor. Marquis
@thetamblyn @CuomoPrimeTime @CharlesMBlow @thetamblyn, Thanks for your sentiments, Tam. Love you, Marquis
@thetamblyn @CuomoPrimeTime @CharlesMBlow @thetamblyn, Yes, the U.S. military knew because it was reported and investigated. I was seven years old and in the room, and was told, "These things do not happen to little boys". Marquis
Dear Christians, why frown at the COMPATIBILITIES of THEORIES and Theology- of the earth and Heaven? Why ignore DATA and STATISTICIANS because you assume they're naturally at odds with your personal POSITIONS? The God of the Bible isn't anti-Science...just SELF-RELIANCE. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime I was a victim of childhood rape, multiple times, and was unbelieved even by the U.S. military because I was a male, and so never received any justice...even to date. I can understand why some people never come forward. Marquis
Dear Christians, are you EQUIPPED for LEADERSHIP? Maybe you need to step up to a plate not previously CONSIDERED, disregarding inner-BICKERING that may tell you to remain SEATED...SELF-DEFEATING. Marquis
@CNNOpinion Does anyone know where to find CNN op-ed/Opinion submission guidelines? I've researched and can't find my answer. Thanks, Marquis
@RyanPhillippe Hey Ryan, just learned of Shooter's cancellation. I am sad for you, as I know you worked hard while playing your role. Do you have anything new on the horizon? Marquis
Dear Christians, Joshua, son of NUN was YOUNG when he took the HELM from Moses. It is, thus, not beyond the REALM of possibility that the God of all CREATION could, with no HESITATION, raise up someone with no silver HAIRS to advance His agenda…no matter who’s STARING. Marquis
Dear Christians, from the TRIBE of LEVI came the fastidious priests of Israel. Taking care that Christ's Body is LOCKSTEP with the sentiments of her SHEPHERD- down to the LETTER- is still EXPECTED; by the One who sits enthroned...you'll receive no penalty for precision. Marquis
Dear Christians, AGING doesn’t have to be a DEGRADING process; remaining nostalgic, always yearning for what's elapsed in DREAD of what lies AHEAD keeps you crippled. Find ways to have your experiences of PAST…leave LASTING imprints on the generations following. Marquis
Dear Christians, ABANDONMENT is an ABHORRENT state to reside in. Yet, there are those walking in a season of suffering who insist THIS as their permanent ADDRESS because they MISS their sunnier disposition from friendlier weather…why the DISDAIN for RAIN? Marquis
Dear Christians, there is nothing INHERENTLY wrong with material PROSPERITY, as long as your acquired resources aren’t RESERVED for only those whom you have decided are…inherently DESERVING. Marquis
Dear Christians, an inability to grasp the correct MEANING of what you are READING in Scripture could stem from a lack of prayer. Prior TO, do YOU ask the Father to fill you with the Holy Spirit for wisdom and UNDERSTANDING?...a request He wouldn't mind readily GRANTING. Marquis
Dear Christians, the prerequisite to RECEIVING the blessings of YHWH is OBEDIENCE to the Godhead. What gall to BELIEVE that continual DEFIANCE to what they COMMAND will LAND you anything but their CONVICTION…to begin WITH. Marquis
Dear Christians, when it seems your faith is about to fail, cling to the promises of your ROCK, and refuse to put any STOCK into NAYSAYERS who would lead you… ASTRAY. Marquis
Dear Christians, is your dwelling place SANITARY? While this question may seem out of the ORDINARY, it is worth meditating over. Maybe the reason you remain under the WEATHER is because your home is ALTOGETHER…filthy. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is soon a day of rest for the honest LABORER who HARBORS no deceit in relating to the Godhead or their NEIGHBOR. The Christian identity encompasses a plethora of truths that should stay CLEAR, including the fact that your "faith"...is also a CAREER. Marquis
Dear Christians, remember your former ENSLAVEMENT? A source of ENLIGHTENMENT, as you are sanctifying you may feel a new weightiness that compels you to stop exercising; thinking back on CHAINS might force you to focus, instead, on what you’ve GAINED so far…keep going. Marquis
Dear Christians, sexual PURITY is MISSING- ecumenically SPEAKING; lust, especially among the youth, is a lasting AILMENT that daily DERAILS the shallow thoughts of eager vessels who won’t pause long enough to resist POLLUTING, and thus…RUINING. Marquis
@TheDannyPino Hey Danny, if you have a quick second, can you explain to me the meaning of this Tweet? Thanks, Marquis
Dear Christians, sadly FATHERHOOD is MISUNDERSTOOD even in the Church; his Biblical role goes beyond that of the traditional sole provider, SOLEY; too HE partakes in the healthy RAISING of his CHILDREN, so WHEN they are older and more ABLE, they are also…STABLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, PARTIALITY has its place among the ASSEMBLY (the truth should be favorable over all lies), but it must remain in BOUNDS- lest your sentiments be FOUND…wanton. Marquis
Dear Christians, there will come a day when the ENEMIES of CHRISTIANITY will show REMORSE for the horrendous COURSES of action BESTOWED upon THOSE who followed faithfully behind the King of kings; but for now continue with TEMPERANCE…and patient ENDURANCE. Marquis
@prattprattpratt Chris, how humorous! Marquis
Dear Christians, MURDER, whether UNDERCOVER in the heart, or explicit, is foul, and all should remain firmly affixed to a zero-tolerance policy while LEADING in such DARKNESS- and YES, this does include…BULLYING. Marquis
@ChrisEvans Chris, thanks for posting, as I am an animal lover. Marquis
Dear Christians, ROOTING out sin in the Body is like removing a piece of rotting FRUIT from your basket after discovering it among the fresh; no one wants to touch it out of fear of getting DIRTY, but it is NECESSARY if you want the rest to THRIVE…to stay ALIVE. Marquis
Dear Christians, you are expected to OBEY Caesar while walking the earth; it is not OKAY to dismiss one law HERE or THERE, unless it is PROVEN that failure to do so will show you in a lesser light to the One…who can MOVE mountains. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Feast of Weeks is a celebration of sustenance. On this day, Torah was given to the ISRAELITES, CITING the requirements for righteousness; it is also known as PENTECOST, enabling those who were once LOST to now accurately ECHO...YHWH’S NARROW standard. Marquis
Dear Christians, bregrudgingly giving because you believe it is INOPPORTUNE speaks VOLUMES about your heart condition and it is DEAFENING; it is worth MENTIONING that its LINGERING SICKNESS could result in your MISSING out on properly connecting with your…consecration. Marquis
Dear Christians, what you digest from your TABLE should ENABLE you to continue walking long after you’ve put away the utensils and PLATES; if what you ATE relentlessly leaves various ACHES, CONSIDER your reflection in the MIRROR…is this what CHRIST looks LIKE? Marquis
Dear Christians, serving false GODS should sound more than a little ODD- it should sound FAMILIAR; multitudes of struggling BELIEVERS regularly SUBMIT by gratifying their sinful nature and refusing to QUIT; how curious…how brash. Marquis
Dear Christians, in what WAYS do you contribute to the world, DAILY? No one expects you expend energy you do not have, but even a faint SMILE may help someone needy…walk just one more MILE. Marquis
Dear Christians, when the Prince of PEACE disciplines it’s because HE is not PLEASED; it is unwise to LEAVE your life in the same disarray that attracted His actions to such an undisciplined CADET…as if the Lord isn’t really UPSET. Marquis
Dear Christians, consistent COMPLIANCE with the TEN COMMANDMENTS does not turn you into a LEGALIST; what it does SUGGEST is that you love your heavenly Father and Savior enough to take them SERIOUSLY…HABITUALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, the God you serve is an all consuming FIRE who will rescue you out of the most DIRE straits; in return, He asks for your complete DEVOTION, with no COMMOTION regarding His EXPECTATIONS…in CONSIDERATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, a lack of humility gives RISE to questioning EYES among LIVES looking for reasons to disregard the CHURCH; they remain HURT when lips espousing brotherly love choose to adorn their fine communities with GATES…finely coated with the color of HATE. Marquis
Dear Christians, not everyone who offends you is entitled to your clemency; the deserving includes non-repeaters who’ve demonstrated willingness to improve upon past ERRORS, RATHER than brazenly indulging in the BASE...and under the banner of Yeshua’s GRACE. Marquis
Dear Christians, Your RESPONSIBILITY when PARENTING stretches beyond instilling good values; foremost it requires introducing your offspring to the LIVING WATER, who was first SLAUGHTERED and is more concerned with their spiritual TOTALITY…than He is in their MORALITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, Yeshua’s death on the cross MEANT the opportunity to END your orphaned CONDITION. Now that you are no longer alone, how often do you spend time with your heavenly FATHER…do you even BOTHER? Marquis
Dear Christians, there is no good reason to PERCEIVE your heavenly Father’s DECREES as INTRUSIVE when they are designed to keep you in good standing. Holiness, by definition, is an EXCLUSIVE state and your EVIDENCE of remaining is shown by your perpetual…ADHERENCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, WHY fear your enemies when the MOST HIGH remains in control eternally? Moreover, if your livelihood should be removed, and thus the earth is no MORE, what’s in STORE for you pales not in comparison to what you’ll leave BEHIND…as a REMINDER. Marquis
Dear Christians, Learn to find CONTENTMENT in what YHWH has INTENDED for you ONLY; BEMOANING what belongs to someone else sends a message that you are possibly disinterested in your BLESSING…unfavorably IMPRESSING the One who bestowed. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblical numbers have meaning; eleven is indicative of CHAOS. While traveling in the wilderness, take great care not to get LOST by fixating on the mirages that will appear to DISTRACT- DETRACTING you from your DESTINATION…and with intense DEDICATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, though the PATRIARCHS of Israel were indeed sons, their COUNTERPARTS were still esteemed by YHWH; some FODDER to reflect upon for those who assume our heavenly FATHER, today, takes little interest in His DAUGHTERS. Marquis
Dear Christians, refusing to ASSIST those seeking refuge is illustrative of UNRIGHTEOUSNESS; perhaps because you have never walked in their holey shoes, you are being unholy in your CONTEMPTUOUS…response. Marquis
@FoxNewsResearch I have a question regarding the U.S. Supreme Court - why are there any justices, liberal or conservative, relying upon case law to render opinions rather than the U.S. Constitution alone? Marquis
Dear Christians, the boundaries in which you dwell must always be warm and hospitable; for anyone passing THROUGH will take “Christian” QUES from…YOU. Marquis
Dear Christians, your journey on this earth should be marked by milestones of MATURATION; if you are not GROWING while walking, even while KNOWING this is Christ’s EXPECTATION, then your rewards in the HEREAFTER…will be LAUGHABLE. Marquis
@AC360 @CNN I liked what I viewed last night on CNN concerning RBG- I found it rather enlightening. It would do the public a great service if CNN did similar profiles on other Supreme Court Justices- both past and present, including the relatively unknown. Marquis
Dear Christians, looking outside yourself to the necessities of others, doesn’t require ignoring your own; relationships in the BODY ought BE reciprocal. Everyone SUCCEEDS when each other’s NEEDS are met…MUTUALLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, in fighting in the army of the Lord, make sure you are properly EQUIPPED; at the top of the list, ensure that all misplaced fear has been…STRIPPED. Marquis
Dear Christians, It is unwise to vow to do ANYTHING. No one knows what the days ULTIMATELY bring, no matter your well-intentioned planning. Eyes become narrowed when others fail to follow THROUGH; and YOU wonder why they HOLD- such bitterness…it’s because they were TOLD. Marquis
Dear Christians, would your heavenly Father BOTHER to even consider your OFFERING if he knew what you were doing prior to presenting? Making AMENDS requires genuine REPENTANCE; you’ll make no inroads with YHWH by simply presenting your…dollars and CENTS. Marquis
Dear Christians, REGULARLY attending an ASSEMBLY of like-minds may reek of conventionality to some modern adherents, but there are advantages. For starters, your walk toward glorification needn’t be a LONELY one…if ONLY your ANXIETY didn’t govern your DECISION-MAKING. Marquis
Dear Christians, sexism of any form should never be found in the behaviors of any child of YHWH; neither should one’s gender GENERATE STATEMENTS of a biased nature…danger abounds when our ill-perception of males or females CREATE an unfavorably hostile STATE. Marquis
Dear Christians, if one CENSUS was taken, for records sake for INSTANCE, of self-proclaimed BELIEVERS, but whose manners DECEIVED, and another one of LEGITIMATE heirs whose EITIQUETTES spoke for themselves, as well…among which LIST would your name be in the MIDST of? Marquis
Dear Christians, are you a blessing to others as DIRECTED by the Holy Spirit? Search your heart, and if anything short of love is DETECTED, go before YHWH to PRAY that He dislodges it...so your inward CURSING doesn’t unexpectedly WORSEN those undetecting- undeserving. Marquis
Dear Christians, The character of YHWH was best EXEMPLIFIED by His Son- whom the world CRUCIFIED. Contrary to some OPINIONS, it is not impossible for his younger children to likewise SHOW; THOUGH, it takes IMMENSE PRACTICE, and the FACT IS…not many are up to it. Marquis
Dear Christians, INTERCESION may produce a BLESSING for a wayward sibling who’s in DANGER of Emmanuel’s IRE. Think ABOUT a former ACCOUNT in the past when your actions would make even Satan blush…and then rush to your KNEES to INTERVENE. Marquis
Dear Christians, a false prophet has knowledge that will APPEAL to HEARERS longing for INFORMATION suitable to their own AMBITIONS, without a MENTION of the TRUTH…decline to eat of their FRUIT. Marquis
Dear Christians, is it your fault that the average person has bought into the idea that the FAITH is full of the WEAK when you SPEAK? When the Lord returns will the Bride still be in DISREPUTE? Will you be directly responsible for Her receiving His…just REBUKE? Marquis
Dear Christians, "spiritual dehydration" sounds unpleasant; it rings of thirstiness. If your spirit is parched from lack of partaking in the Spirit's activities then it shall never be QUENCHED, and your STINT as a CHRISTIAN will have BEEN...a waste. Marquis
Dear Christians, you aren’t going to be PRISTINE when you arise from your KNEES after your first MEETING with Yeshua of Nazareth, but declared righteous- morally JUSTIFIED…in the EYES of YHWH. Marquis
Dear Christians, you are ACCOUNTABLE for one another, in deeds and in SPEECH. When one observes that a fellow DISCIPLE is LIABLE to fall, rather than staring with gaping MOUTH...REACH your hands OUT. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime Chris, I am a Christian and I do think it is possible to be both Pro-Life and Pro-Death Penalty. I am. I value life, but I think there is Biblical New Testament Basis for the death penalty in certain cases; I use Romans chp.13. Marquis
Dear Christians, your proximity to YHWH is close, compared to what the Israelites were afforded. How NEAR are you to your heavenly Father?... How DEAR is He to you? Marquis
Dear Christians, when possible, your confrontations should ultimately edify. Think about the goal of the ENCOUNTER. Is what you are really AFTER a resolution, OR, an introduction to the next...Revolutionary WAR? Marquis
Dear Christians, are you a STENCH to those who carouse in SEWAGE? Not because of your lifestyle, but because of your persona. Does your COUNTENANCE SUGGEST a PREFERENCE for better people? Not for intimacy, but for...daily interacting? Marquis
Dear Christians, rebellion against YHWH in proclaiming that you prefer your better days in Egypt, from whence you were SAVED, is not only DEPRAVED thinking, it reeks of improper training. Gaze ahead. You will desire to return to the GROUND...if you keep looking DOWN. Marquis
Dear Christians, a loud voice of reason is required to hush fearful tones. Do not spread your MESSAGE while you yourself lack CONFIDANCE. No one will be moved, and you will be to BLAME...for their lack of CHANGE. Marquis
Dear Christians, Miriam was an early leader of the Hebrews, serving with Aaron and MOSES. Too, a modern-day Prophet or PROPHETESS can encourage the MASSES when they feel the early onset of their...LAST breath. Marquis
Dear Christians, sometimes it is helpful to evaluate your "sufferings" relative to those dwelling outside your BACKYARD. So you only have one CAR instead of two. Well, consider the person SLEEPING in their one vehicle. ...Are you WEEPING? Marquis
Dear Christians, How unwise to ignore a blaring alarm, alerting of impending DANGER. You won't heed the warning of a caring STRANGER because you don't know them? How foolish. You don't know the weather man or woman on T.V. ...yet, you still BELIEVE. Marquis
Dear Christians, Passover is recorded in Scripture for the purpose of informing readers of an instance WHEN Divine INTERVENTION mattered MOST, but also to POST parallels between the Old and New TESTAMENTS. However, many won't even read Torah...to their own DETRIMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, lamps PROVIDE light for those whose LIVES are hindered, cloaked in total darkness. The Church is a lamp for the world, but there is currently a shade that needs removing, because though enhancing to the eye, it's detracting to SOULS...wanting to be whole. Marquis
Dear Christians, "work" is symbolized by the number six in the Word. The Father and SON created in such FASHION; your efforts in working are firmly rooted in faith- YES, but it LESSENS not the expectation for personal growth from SEED...and FREE from entangling WEEDS. Marquis
Dear Christians, let what YOU CONSUME by mouth keep you single-minded, so your thoughts don't suddenly waiver in the WIND, leading you to BEND YHWH's rules...for holiness. Marquis
Dear Christians, repentance is more than an expression of SORROW. One also must attest that TOMORROW will be different from today- you will no LONGER remain ANCHORED...to sin. Marquis
Dear Christians, among the Body of Christ, every member has a unique ASSIGNMENT, and solitary CONFINEMENT won't get the job done; the expectation is for EACH to REACH the goals given by the Father, Son, and Spirit...though you can't work while filled with RESENTMENT. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Levites were like the early DEACONS, ministering to Aaron, his SONS, and the Tabernacle too; they were called- not SELF-APPOINTED. The ANOINTED do not VOLUNTEER...for APPEARANCES sake. Marquis
Dear Christians, neglecting families for more spiritual PURSUITS is not going to earn YOU more rewards in HEAVEN; this particular batch of LEAVEN needs removing to avoid SEPARATIONS...and paying REPARATIONS, thereafter. Marquis
Dear Christians, your journey on the Earth is AKIN to the Israelites' walk in the WILDERNESS; learn of their struggles or you'll MISS what the SPIRIT is trying to teach you about...submission. Marquis
Dear Christians, what do you deem VALUABLE? Do you ALLOW the cares of the world to cloud your PERCEPTION? Some INTROSPECTION is in ORDER...BEFORE answering. Marquis
Dear Christians, idolatry extends beyond fixations on graven statues to SMELLS, as WELL as sounds, touches, tastes, and thoughts. If you cannot TELL the difference between an INFATUATION and harmless ADMIRATION- PRAY, and then AWAIT...sound CLARIFICATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, The Day of Atonement was a solemn occasion, inducing reflection on our elder siblings, who were more than relieved over the annual TASK- because it wasn't LASTING. Yeshua, the consummate HIGH PRIEST, deserves at LEAST the same COURTESY...REGULARLY. Marquis
Dear Christians, murder is no light subject, and all will AGREE that it FLAGRANTLY violates the LAW; but, the BRAWLING in the heart that SECRETES EQUALLY potent BILE...is just as VILE. Marquis
Dear Christians, sowing SEED for future NEEDS means you won't go hungry when craving; nourishment is vital for a vibrant Body. Causing a DEARTH of food because you refuse to delve into DIRT will HURT you now...and later. Marquis
Dear Christians, is it right to give the God of the Bible second-rate hand-me-downs; to give Him your service after INVESTING your BEST elsewhere? Be WARY of this custom- your heavenly Father takes it VERY...seriously. Marquis
@USATODAY I remember watching a video years ago chronicling the details of this horrendous tragedy. Gruesome. The Emmett Till murder and the flagrant miscarriage of justice that followed were painful examples of why the 20th Century Civil Rights Movement was so necessary. Marquis
Dear Christians, mourning the dead is HEALTHY and a NECESSARY part of GRIEVING. However, the comes a moment when it is TIME to LEAVE the tears BEHIND; you can't go on LIVING if you're continuously GIVING BREATH...to DEATH. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Israelites acquired a land, 'flowing with milk and honey', but its blessings were provisional; so, too are YHWH's provisions for his children of TODAY; yours are DELAYED when your actions...BETRAY. Marquis
Dear Christians, REVERANCE for one's PARENTS is an ancient tradition, and some traditions need revisiting; looking back will benefit SONS and DAUGHTERS who won't RUN to the aid of the tired and BOTHERED- you...WHO have better things to DO. Marquis
Dear Christians, declaring all that you don't like is an abomination to YHWH is disingenuous and will lead to DISASTER; your personal tastes MATTER, but not as a replacement of TRUTH; such practice is not merely UNCOUTH...its unbiblical. Marquis
Dear Christians, does your sweat and blood go into your growth as a disciple, or is your committment to Christ marred by mediocrity? Are you wrestling toward perfection to show dedication to the cause, or do you give others CAUSE to PAUSE...and QUESTION your CONFESSION? Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime @VanJones68 As a former victim of child abuse, I am disgusted by the fact that although child abuse, in all its ugly forms, has been a national pandemic for some time now, the issue does not REGULARLY receive the attention it deserves by ALL levels of government. Marquis
Dear Christians, death to the SIN WITHIN is multi-step, and so requires daily walking; first, there's the cross, followed by sanctification...GRUELING, but TRULY rewarding on days of victory. Marquis
Dear Christians, UNFORTUNATELY, MASCULINITY and FEMINITY have been HIGHLY secularized; there is no place for chauvinists or doormats in the Church, as both pervert the image of the GODHEAD...for a proper reflection, rather than the world, turn to the Word INSTEAD. Marquis
Dear Christians, basic HYGIENE applies to all members of Christ's Body; humans are sensuous BEINGS and other SENSES should not have to take OFFENSE because you may choose...to neglect. Marquis
Dear Christians, your overexposure to some lights disregards the MANDATE to respect the body entrusted like delicate FREIGHT; increase your general knowledge of ENERGY and you will SEE how better off you'll be in the long run...consider the SUN. Marquis
@WalshFreedom I stay annoyed with this process every cycle. Judicial nominees should be independent thinkers, rather than ideological ones. And it is disingenuous for any one not to assert that Presidents from both parties are guilty of being partisan when it comes time to appoint. Marquis
Dear Christians, you who bear children and you who help to CONCEIVE, BELIEVE that what YOU TWO produce can be of great use to the Kingdom of YHWH...if you'll both agree not to get in the way. Marquis
Dear Christians, all things edible are not for EATING - feelings are FLEETING; continue to rely upon your instincts, while refusing to draw distinctions, and soon illness will set IN, and not long after...your END. Marquis
Dear Christians, drawing a line in the sand and refusing to step over when enticed is a sign that YOU VALUE harmony with your Groom; adulterous ACTIVITY is...TREACHERY. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is a healing element to FIRE, for those who don't fear PERSPIRING; some need to go only near, while others must go THROUGH- but, after singeing from the heat, you'll enjoy...like the smell of tea, freshly BREWED. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblically, the number seven speaks to completion; YHWH works in epochs and when they have all ended it will mean an ACCOUNTING for His COMMUNED household; now is OPPORTUNE to make sure yours...is ASTOUNDING. Marquis
Dear Christians, why live in perpetual guilt over past dwellings in darkness when all things old have been made NEW; STEWING over REGRETS BEGETS deep DEPRESSION...a painfully unncessary LESSON. Marquis
Dear Christians, you claim to have faith, but are you a walking testimony to being light like the Son of MAN; does whomever you STAND next to believe the same thing you DO about...YOU? Marquis
Dear Christians, refusing to utter, though you know the TRUTH, is indicative of RUTHLESS behavior; what USE is your SERVICE to the great I AM if you allow NERVOUSNESS to keep lies lingering...to the detriment of innocence. Marquis
Dear Christians, so, once AGAIN, you did not INTEND to SIN? How maddening. Still, as humans covered in the blood of the spotless Lamb, take comfort in His one-time SACRIFICE; your stained LIFE was still viewed worthy enough for salvage...and for helping to salvage others. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Prince of PEACE is DISPLEASED with those SHEEP who are more than amused with chaos engulfing nations; turmoil is anathema to the Christian anthem of agape LOVE...let's make every effort to rise ABOVE. Marquis
Dear Christians, like freshly BAKED unleavened bread, no spirit should BREAK on account of your yeast-filled words; tongues are poisonous when, with HATE, they criticize...for criticism SAKE. Marquis
Dear Christians, on the cross, Yeshua was a burnt offering to his Father- a rather pleasant aroma because of his consistent obedience while walking the Earth; the fragrance you RELEASE in serving the Lord should be...equally PLEASING. Marquis
Dear Christians, like Aaron and his sons, the family of YHWH is a united perpetual PRIESTHOOD; the Israelites once UNDERSTOOD the gravity of this ROLE, so too must you grasp the significance of what has since been...BESTOWED. Marquis
Dear Christians, you were SAVED for YHWH's use; now that your name has been ENGRAVED in the Lamb's Book of LIFE, STRIVE to be continuously usuable in reflecting the righteousness of His SON...until YHWH'S work is DONE. Marquis
Dear Christians, the Church is not a BUILDING for merely COMMEMORATING the acts of Yeshua and the early Apostles who followed; it is a collection of diverse PEOPLES made up, purposefully, of the seasoned and the...FEEBLE. Marquis
Dear Christians, there was a mercy SEAT in the HOLY OF HOLIES, though only the high priest could approach. Today that seat is available to a multitude; we can all go before it...now too we can all show it. Marquis
Dear Christians, Biblical numbers have meaning; ten points to the LAW, for which believers should remain in constant AWE over the PRESIDING Holy Spirit's power to keep all...ABIDING. Marquis
Dear Christians, TEACHERS are vital LEADERS in the Church; the RESPONSIBILITY of CHIEFLY instructing on Biblical issues should hold no small place in the eyes of Yeshua's SHEEP...who should WEEP at the thought of spiritual ignorance. Marquis
Dear Christians, starting each day devoted to reading and prayer is a sign of spiritual maturity; waiting until later when it better SUITS is FOOLISH- AKIN to BEGINNING a new medicine without first reading the LABEL...how DISABLING. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is no place for obdurance among the Body of Christ; bad habits from long ago should not age with your FAITH, refusing departure...blind to GRACE. Marquis
Dear Christians, impatience is a rather undesirable character trait to POSSESS; you STRESS being on TIME above all else, but your deficiency far surpasses those who don't always FIND themselves arriving...on schedule. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Chris, we have too many societal pandemics our federal government isn't taking more seriously, in part because they make everything into a partisan issue. In addition to gun violence, what about: homelessness, mental illness, ethnic bigotry, and child abuse, for example? Marquis
Dear Christians, YHWH provides gifts for His creation for a PURPOSE other than self; while you may be NERVOUS at the thought of using, CHOOSE to DO, so that others will BENEFIT...from your DECISION. Marquis
Dear Christians, asking for forgiveness can sometimes TAKE great effort, but relationships are at STAKE; bringing misfortune to former friends doesn't have to result in permanently SHATTERED...PATTERNS. Marquis
Dear Christians, consecration is a concentrated cleansing PROCESS that necessitates patience; NEVERTHELESS, though grueling, the effects are GRATIFYING and in the eyes of our heavenly Father...equally SATISFYING. Marquis
@DalJeanis @jsf33 My point exactly. Thanks for the "follow" and supporting comment. Marquis
@CoachDavidLeake Hey, David, you followed me earlier this evening, I noticed on my Twitter page. I greatly appreciated it. Did you mean to unfollow me as well? Thanks, Marquis
Dear Christians, clothing makes several statements REGARDING your identity; BARRING a lack of understanding about perception, what you WEAR...should remain free from ENSNARING. Marquis
Dear Christians, when volunteering as A DISPLAY of love, what is brought to the TABLE should ENABLE others working alongside to perform with greater ease; even ENCOURAGEMENT through the SWEAT...is BETTER than nothing at all. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime Thanks for the interview with Sabato Jr., Chris. I like it when you interview both Republicans and Democrats. Marquis
Dear Christians, where you WORSHIP, at a synagogue or in CHURCHES, is of lesser significance than the heart of the MATTER; AFTER you leave services...are you better equipped to serve? Marquis
Dear Christians, our HEAVENLY Father despises those who complain ENDLESSLY when asked to give a red cent beyond their own DESIRE; His IRE is stoked when those who have it...refuse to part with it. Marquis
Dear Christians, GOOD leaders WOULD never assume the masses that FOLLOW have HOLLOW heads; just because one is behind and not in front, their thoughts are still worth CONSIDERING...a good leader will still give them a HEARING. Marquis
Dear Christians, celebrating WICKEDNESS by intimately gathering with MALICE - persons whose hearts and minds are filled with MALEVOLENCE - rather than with other disciples, shows a lack of discipline; fellowshipping with like BELIEVERS...will keep you CLEANER. Marquis
Dear Christians, BORROWED monies shouldn't need returning TOMORROW; those who ASK aren't BASKING while doing so anyway- so, why expect...repayment? Marquis
Dear Christians, remaining culturally set apart from the world doesn't imply the wearing of BLINDERS; as a REMINDER, one has to SEE who and why they must lead...to CALVARY. Marquis
@jsf33 Jonathan, I am black and a Christian missionary and see nothing wrong with the N-Word being used by anyone when speaking in an academic context, whether in referencing history or its varied use in current culture. Marquis
@THR Well, I am black and a Christian missionary, but I disagree with the decision by Netflix. ANYONE using the "N-Word" in an academic manner, whether in referencing history or it's impact on current culture, should be able to use the whole word without fear. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Hey Chris, I liked what U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III said about the topic while on the House floor the other day. In replying to naysayers, the essence of his message was that we can most certainly take care of BOTH. Thanks for your passion on the show. Marquis
Dear Christians, immobilizing fear of YHWH is no WAY to walk in the footsteps of Yeshua; if, while laboring in the hot SUN, no work is actually being DONE...perhaps your "REVERENCE" is the DETERRENCE. Marquis
Dear Christians, so you are YHWH's treasured POSSESSION? Might I, then, make a SUGGESTION: keep yourselves purified - undefiled - and continuously set apart as HOLY...for His GLORY. Marquis
Dear Christians, though you may feel otherwise, you cannot do "it" all by yourself; the human body is made of multiple parts for multiple REASONS...learn them and then enter into a prolonged SEASON of togetherness. Marquis
@RepJoeKennedy Rep. Kennedy, I just listened to your speech on the House floor regarding the immigration polies of the United States. Excellent speech. You are very right...we can do BOTH. Thank you for your efforts. Marquis
Dear Christians, false ACCUSATIONS based upon mindless SPECULATIONS will damage the REPUTATION of another; your sister or brother in Christ deserve better than...idle gossip. Marquis
Dear Christians, your insistence on GRUMBLING at every turn will eventually result in the TUMBLING of your congregation; wisdom dictates arguing sensibly - though still with passion - while remembering GENTLY...it's not always about, "ME". Marquis
Dear Christians, it behooves all to have an ATTITUDE of GRATITUDE when thinking about your blessings when received; but the attitude must first begin with... "THANK YOU." Marquis
Dear Christians, when enemies are in PURSUIT, either CONTINUE walking as if your steps will result in their boredom, or turn and face them head-on; your decision will determine the OUTCOME...both in the short and LONG RUN. Marquis
Dear Christians, bondage comes in many forms, but one doesn't have to remain in the SLAVE CHAINS they were born into; the CROSS means freedom...though the COST is high. Marquis
Dear Christians, family MEALS are an opportune time for pausing to DEAL with life; always striving without ceasing is no way to carry on with it...as if your last breath depended on it. Marquis
Dear Christians, defining your neighbor by any scale other than, "Does this person exist?" may promote unintended BIGOTRY among the CITIZENRY; acceptance - not tolerance - is the NAME of the GAME...anyway. Marquis
Dear Christians, the seniors and youth can grow in wisdom together; the former in remembering that the young can be headstrong, YES, but their vibrancy is, NONETHELESS, beneficial, and the LATTER in deferring to the golden for "guiding" MATTERS...as a display of civility. Marquis
Dear Christians, the COUNTENANCE of ARROGANCE is unmistakable and set facial expressions are undeniably dead ringers for what is brewing in the heart; keep your nose parallel to the GROUND...so only humility is FOUND. Marquis
Dear Christians, secrets have a way of telling on themselves when least expected; therefore, trust only him or her who has proven their worth...unless you don't mind the intel you prize the MOST traveling from COAST to COAST. Marquis
Dear Christians, hardening the HEART is an ART form one should never seek to LEARN; the only reaction it will EARN upon gazing at the finished product is one of...condemnation. Marquis
@cspanhistory In reading the above, I am reflective. In reflecting on the current U.S political climate and ineptness of our government, in my opinion, our general electorate needs a lesson on Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, and if moved to do so, members need to act upon it. Marquis
Dear Christians, uncontrolled wailing is a sign of immense dissatisfaction; but, pay attention to non-verbal signals too because not everyone who BEMOANS...GROANS out loud. Marquis
@gabrielsen_ As a Christian, I pray daily for Kim Jung-Un and his people; I am warmed by President's Trumps recent efforts with North Korea. For those who are upset with Trump's diplomacy because of North Korea's human right's record, I sincerely hope they are equally upset with ours. Marquis
Dear Christians, how ironic that "I" lies at the center of SACRIFICE; give up "I" and there is nothing left to focus on, so we can now turn our attention ELSEWHERE...and stop STARING. Marquis
Dear Christians, some people need evidence to BELIEVE; it is impossible for them to CONCEIVE of the possibility that someone once in the GRAVE can now BRAVE life, and with vitality...so show them. Marquis
Dear Christians, continuous disobedience begets DESTRUCTION; choosing a life of CORRUPTION will certainly ensure that suffering ensues and you will only have yourself to BLAME...for the fanning FLAMES to follow. Marquis
Dear Christians, compassion is not for having, but showing; COMPASSION without ACTION is useless...like a barren TREE in the dead of summer HEAT. Marquis
@CuomoPrimeTime As someone who has a history of mental illness myself, I wish the media would stop citing suicide statistics as if they actually include ALL accounts. i am certain that not all suicides or suicide attempts are reported. Marquis
Dear Christians, never tolerate unscrupulous conduct; remaining silent out of TREPIDATION is a clear INDICATION that you are not committed to the cause...of righteousness. Marquis
@CNN As I mentioned yesterday regarding another suicide, in my opinion it is time for the world to spend more time addressing mental illness. I can personally attest that suideal ideations and attempts are no light matter. So many people are in need of awareness and help. Marquis
Dear Christians, some things buried need resurrecting and fast, lest the covered dirt asphyxiates those still living; hiding from the PAST won't produce anything LASTING except...baneful anxiety. Marquis
@TwitterMoments Kate Spade's suicide is a painful reminder, in my opinion, of how much more awareness needs to be raised regarding all forms of mental illness. As someone who suffers from Major Depressive Disorder myself, I know the dangers of unwanted intrusive and ruminating thoughts.  Marquis
Dear Christians, do not SPEND an INHERITANCE unwisely; others will soon despise and the debts ACCRUED from monies ABUSED will eventually leave you...flattened. Marquis
Dear Christians, the nations surrounding you are worthy of attention; in a world full of DARKNESS one is REMISS in not offering blazing light where the blind are TORN...and withered hearts are the NORM. Marquis
Dear Christians, while on the job, working hard is better than hardly working, as the clock is ticking; your work ETHIC should REFLECT dedication, rather than...dereliction. Marquis
Dear Christians, reunions can offer restoration where there is brokenness; in some instances PERMANENCE doesn't offer the CHANCE for healing ailing BODIES in desperate NEED of...solidity. Marquis
Dear Christians, the advantages of self-control are many; costly MISTAKES are made DAILY by those who allow passions to control every MOVE...a display of FOOLERY. Marquis
Dear Christians, thievery comes in many forms; and taking anything that does not BELONG to you is not only WRONG, but woundful too...to the detriment of ALL INVOLVED. Marquis
Dear Christians, peace in the midst of destructive STORMS may not always leave you feeling WARM; yet, the alternative will leave you drenched in heavy RAINS...possibly for DAYS. Marquis
Dear Christians, Power and SERVICE can COEXIST; leading with EMPATHY will enrich your LIFE-JOURNEY and will ensure those who follow...do so with joy. Marquis
@vicenews Perhaps a valuable lesson can be learned by all future U.S. Presidents, no matter their political persuasion; if they haven't already done so, make political appointments only after heavy reflection, lest one fall victim to the Law of Unintended Consequences. Marquis
@TwitterMoments By the way, my original comments are not referring to ABC's legal decision. Rather, it is my opinion that it is morally wrong to punish another individual or an entire group for the actions of one person. Marquis
@TwitterMoments What a deplorable decision by ABC. I completely disagree with Roseanne's statements. However, why punish the entire cast of a show - one that had nothing to do with what was published on Twitter. I hope the cast complains and demands their jobs back. Marquis
@marthamaccallum @therealroseanne @RealCandaceO Well, while I find her comments rather inappropriate, I do not agree with ABC's decision at all. Why punish an entire cast of people who had nothing to do with what Roseanne wrote on Twitter. I hope they complain to ABC and demand to have their jobs back. Marquis
Dear Christians, because the human BODY is MAJORITY water, perhaps, in this instance, more is better than less; dehydration is not a good LOOK...read a BOOK. Marquis
@JohnBerman @NewDay Congratulations John, I look forward to watching you during your new time slot. I enjoy watching your passionate presentations.  Marquis
Dear Christians, truth is not relative; there are some INTERPRETATIONS that spawn from beclouded IMAGINATIONS...AVOID these POLAROIDS. Marquis
Dear Christians, temptations don't have to lead to TRAUMA; all the DRAMA associated one can avoid by firmly fixing your eyes upon HE or SHE...with no COMPLICITY. Marquis
Dear Christians, while our heavenly Father did not INTEND for earthly families to become BLENDED, still those with "step" attached to their title are entitled to love; enmity toward the new simply because they did not BEGIN...must END. Marquis
Dear Christians, the youth of TODAY don't always DISPLAY acuity when making decisions; nevertheless, numerous examples do exist where their behaviors indeed mirror WISDOM...so, praise THEM. Marquis
@WalshFreedom Joe, while I assert that the North Korean government certainly has evil aspects to it. I am uncomfortable with referring to Kim in the same way; my research on the history of the country has revealed that which reeks of tradition, rather than blind malevolence. Marquis
Dear Christians, CONTEMPLATING on the LEGACY you want to leave behind when your journey's over is worth consideration; those who follow THROUGH long after YOU deserve...the best. Marquis
Dear Christians, bad habits are DRAINING, yet many make PAINSTAKING efforts to avoid dropping THEM; how sad...how DIM. Marquis
Dear Christians, living in lust just because doesn't keep you in good standing with others living too; what feels good NOW will eventually...keep you on the GROUND. Marquis
Dear Christians, favortism where children are concerned should concern ALL; treating some like DOLLS while the REST like repugnant PESTS is wholly...contemptible. Marquis
@ChrisCuomo I agree with this statement Chris. Unfortunately, not enough Americans have the necessary information on mental illness, including those themselves who suffer unknowingly. In my opinion, mental illness is a world-wide pandemic, and the masses everywhere needs educating. Marquis
@thetamblyn Hey Tam, I hope all is well in your life, and that you are healthy these days. Marquis
Dear Christians, some messages are worth listening to, DESPITE your HEIGHTENED disliking of the messenger; what you HEAR could help STEER you in a better direction...than you are currently walking. Marquis
Dear Christians, CONFESSING that all we POSSESS should have purpose is spiritually HEALTHY; being WEALTHY has merit...so long as we are not ensared by it. Marquis
Dear Christians, constant ENVYING is way too time CONSUMING; so you don't have what they have...make a choice to ABSTAIN from excessive COMPLAINING. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is nothing shameful about physical BEAUTY; the attractive persons you SEE  in front of you are worthy of CONSIDERATION...not disdainful CONDEMNATION. Marquis
Dear Christians, dreams can PROVIDE helpful GUIDANCE, provided the receiver is receptive; blanket LEERINESS, however, will keep the spirit perpetually...WEARY. Marquis
Dear Christians, even CONCEIVING of DECEIVING to get ahead is a dangerous path to set one foot upon; decide to WALK and sooner or later...you are certain to get CAUGHT. Marquis
Dear Christians, agreements should not be entered into LIGHTLY; a firm, but POLITE, "No", is, at times, the ANSWER...a life ENHANCER. Marquis
Dear Christians, every family TREE has LEAVES and branches that look rather unsightly; they are indeed ROTTEN...and should not be FORGOTTEN. Marquis
Dear Christians, measure compatibility among peers with SLITS before hearts are HIT with settlement; consequences will ensue for failure to ABIDE...the eyes can LIE. Marquis
Dear Christians, death is an inevitable part of LIFE; any INNER-STRIFE related to the idea should CEASE...live in PEACE. Marquis
Dear Christians, sacrifices are meant to be difficult because in giving up you are being STRETCHED; what remains shall be ETCHED...in your memories. Marquis
Dear Christians, embracing new BEGINNINGS means saying goodbye; but, not all goodbyes...have good ENDINGS. Marquis
Dear Christians, true healing rarely takes place OVERNIGHT; many BLIGHTS require multiple steps...before any signs of recovery. Marquis
Dear Christians, looking back has VALUE when YOU keep what you see in perspective; staring too long may impair your vision...permanently. Marquis
Dear Christians, interceding for ANOTHER regardless of their skin COLOR is right; your looking out may really help someone else in...need. Marquis
Dear Christians, sibling RIVALRY can withstand any FIRE if those involved will  pause and consider; burning up...benefits no one. Marquis
Dear Christians, contemptuous LOOKS, as if you've already read the BOOK, are vile; people need more than passing glances...before passing judgement. Marquis
Dear Christians, living in FEAR as if disaster is always NEAR is unwise and stifling; constant uneasiness can easily be removed, though...with deliberate insistence. Marquis
Dear Christians, many causes are worth fighting for, but battles don't have to be bloody to achieve one's OBJECTIVE...of AFFECTING change. Marquis
Dear Christians, sometimes separations are a necessity; if only for a SEASON and if for no other REASON than...induced reflection. Marquis
@ChrisCuomo lol- I can tell by your facial expressions on CNN that you are not enamored with "royal family" news. Marquis
Dear Christians, contrary to popular belief, lies do not exist in various shades...WHITE does not make it RIGHT. Marquis
Dear Christians, there is no need for confusion when communicating; just say what you MEAN...leaving others feeling far less GREEN. Marquis
Dear Christians, no man or woman is an island; it pays to leave your own backyard every now and AGAIN...nothing ever good comes from staying WITHIN. Marquis
Dear Christians, animosity is destructive; it benefits no one to hold a grudge til death do us PART...what a rather unpleasant ART. Marquis
Dear Christians, TEST ANXIETY could be a sign of one's lesser ABILITIES at coping...when the harshest of winds begin blowing. Marquis
Dear Christians, just because they don't walk and talk, and breathe the way we DO...Animals still have rights TOO. Marquis
Dear Christians, life's STORMS are NORMAL; rains are undoubtedly followed by less cloudy days...revealing the strength of the sun's unwavering rays. Marquis
Dear Christians, your FAMILY isn't necessarily limited to your bone and marrow, for even these members can sterilize what would otherwise be...healthy. Marquis
Dear Christians, conflicts CAN produce hearts and minds at greater ease, so why avoid them...just to keep the peace? Marquis
Dear Christians, your senses can have consequences...if not used sensibly. Marquis
Dear Christians, Loneliness is a miserable State to live in; it is  always cold and the people living there are rather self-centered. Marquis
Dear Christians, the God of the Bible is not anti-Science...just self-reliance. Marquis
Dear Christians, when everyday people look at others they see the entire Body...not just the Head.  Marquis
@JensenAckles @jarpad @mishacollins Thanks for the link, Jensen. Marquis
@jarpad @CreationEnt @JensenAckles @Austin_Police @TheTankeroo I love the picture, Jared. Marquis
Every U.S. tax payer should contact their U.S. Representative, Senator, and the White House, voicing their strong disapproval at those who approved a 1.3 Trillion dollar omnibus spending bill without having read the 2,200 pages first. Marquis
@Omolagunju Hey Tosin, please call me Marquis. Doing well. How are you and your family members?
I like your character Jared. Marquis@jarpad
Zack, have you ever considered doing anything on Broadway? Marquis@ZacEfron
Chris, what a compelling debate between Jealous and Santorium. Marquis#CuomoPrimeTime
Good luck tonight Chris; I'm looking forward to the show. Marquis#CuomoPrimeTime
Chris, I found the show interesting tonight. I looked forward to seeing what happens tomorrow night. Marquis#CuomoPrimeTime
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Looking for to watching your show tonight, Chris. Marquis
DECEPTION is an evil game. All players involved who INSIST on playing will come to a bitter end...and then, my friend, when the game is over, and lives have been ruined, onlookers will be dismayed at the tragedy before them...If only the FOOLS had followed the rules. Marquis
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Chris, do you have plans to continue anchoring until you retire from working? Marquis
The truth is not always easy to speak, but NOT speaking it not only makes YOU look weak, it too keeps those around you in a crippled state - people who need healing.. not perpetual feel good feelings. Marquis
@ZacEfron @DisasterArtist Interesting video Zac. Marquis
