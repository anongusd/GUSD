Separating families during emergencies when all need medical care should be a last resort. #DHTrauma outreach lecture
In emergencies, first responders are called to do the most good for the most victims. #DHTrauma
There is conventional care that we provide daily and there is crisis care that we provide during emergencies. Both are important. #DHTrauma
Chance favors the prepared mind. Quote from Dr. Chris Colwell. #DHTrauma lecture
Emergency preparedness has a new take for medical professionals today. We must be prepared when something happens. #DHTrauma Outreach...
Our November #DHTrauma lecture will start any moment. Dr. Colwell will cover emergency preparedness lessons learned from Colorado Shootings.
