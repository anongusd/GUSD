Thank you @repjohnlewis and the Faith and Politics Institute for an educational and memorable weekend on the civil rights pilgrimage! #FPICivilRights @FaithNPolitics https://t.co/tYFGHafWGP
Eventually the Alabama National Guard was nationalized and the siege ended. Thanks to Pastor Baxter Morris for welcoming us.  #FPICivilRights https://t.co/RSOve5erqF
In May of 1961, the church hosted 1500 worshipers and activists when a mob threatened to burn it to the ground and lobbed in rocks and tear gas. MLK, John Lewis and others asked Attorney General Robert Kennedy to intervene.
Sophie and I just attended the service at the Historic First Baptist Church in Montgomery. In this church, Reverend Ralph Abernathy preached. It was the site of mass meetings to organize the bus boycott and was a refuge for the freedom riders.
We had the honor of laying a wreath at the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Civil Rights Memorial and taking a pledge to continue the fight for justice and equality. #FPICivilRights https://t.co/f4X7pgiqTo
While at the church, we heard powerful words of reconciliation from Peggy Wallace Kennedy, the daughter of former Governor George Wallace, as well as from Caroline Kennedy, daughter of John F Kennedy.  #FPICivilRights https://t.co/xJU6Nutmky
Visited Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King was pastor and organized the Montgomery bus boycotts.
We visited Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma and heard songs and stories from Bettie Mae Fikes and Chuck Neblett. They spoke about the important role that music played in fueling the civil rights movement. #FPICivilRights https://t.co/RKhRRcuUWn
RT @FaithNPolitics: Today we followed in the footsteps of history. A true honor to again join @repjohnlewis and reflect on the sacrifice of…
John Lewis just shared his experience and explained why the effort to protect votings rights continues... #FPICivilRights https://t.co/T95rNAuiX8
On March 7, 1965, John Lewis led a 600 person protest march from Selma to Montgomery to elevate the issue of voting rights. They were stopped at the Edmund Pettus Bridge - sprayed with teargas and beaten with clubs.
We visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, the nation’s first memorial dedicated to the the human loss suffered during the era of racial lynching. #FPICivilRights https://t.co/wRjkyCTNPB
There was a powerful performance of a play about the 4 young girls who lost their lives in this church following a bombing. We also heard from @SenDougJones who prosecuted two of the men who perpetrated this terrible act. Stay tuned for more updates this weekend #FPICivilRights https://t.co/bdjHxVuJQy
Sophie and I will be in Alabama over these next few days with my colleague @repjohnlewis on a Civil Rights Pilgrimage. We started the day with a visit to the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
Last week, I was fortunate to attend the Asia Pacific Cultural Center’s 21st Annual New Year Celebration in Tacoma, featuring the beautiful island and culture of Hawaii!

From the permanent re-authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, to the creation of Washington’s first two National Heritage Areas, this bill represents a huge win for Washington state!  https://t.co/nXGtdc2QaI
The bipartisan #PublicLands package delivers on our region’s long-standing priorities to protect our environment and support continued access to our public lands for generations to come.
Growing up on the Olympic Peninsula, I’ve seen firsthand how our public lands have captivated both visitors and residents alike and served as key economic drivers for our local communities.
One of the most sacred rights as an American is the right to vote. I’m proud to join @RepTerriSewell and @repjohnlewis as a co-sponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act to strengthen election transparency and ensure equal access to the ballot box. Congress must #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/mWzqbGN9ej
Today, I'm excited to vote for a #PublicLands package that will permanently reauthorize the #LWCF, boost rural economies, and allow future generations to continue to enjoy our natural landscapes. Stay tuned for more! https://t.co/GP9YdbMVPs

Tonight the House passed a true bipartisan compromise that keeps our government open and upholds our nation’s values. While it’s not the agreement either party would have written on its own, it represents the best possible deal to responsibly fund our gov’t and secure our border.

It was wrong that the 2017 #TaxScam opened up the Arctic for oil and gas drilling. It violates the rights of the Gwich'in people, worsens climate change, and threatens local ecosystems. That's why I'm a cosponsor of the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act!
Americans deserve a government that works, and I'm excited the new Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress has announced its new members. Welcome aboard! I'm pumped to start working towards bipartisan change to get Congress working for the people again.
I spoke this morning about how the federal government must uphold its treaty and trust obligation to Native American communities, and also work to combat the enormous risk that climate change poses to our region. This is non-negotiable. https://t.co/b1DlcDU98S
How cool is this? (pun intended...) #WomenInScienceDay https://t.co/knTdhUlhn4
We must be vigilant in speaking out against harmful rhetoric by people in both parties. I’m pleased to see Rep. Omar has apologized. Our politics should be free of anti-Semitic rhetoric.
One of the more disturbing elements in our country today is the rising use of anti-Semitic rhetoric. I never thought I would see the day when an American President would declare that people chanting anti-Semitic rhetoric were “very fine people.” https://t.co/BbdcC6eLEB
I joined my fellow @SEEC members for a discussion with @SpeakerPelosi and @USRepKCastor about our priorities for combating the #climatecrisis, including reaffirming our commitment to the #ParisAccord, investing in green infrastructure, and creating more green-collar jobs.

Earlier this week, I met with the NW Indian Fisheries Commission to talk about protecting treaty rights and the need for federal funding to recover our salmon and orca populations. Also, a special thanks to Chairman Forsman of the Suquamish Tribe for stopping by the meeting! https://t.co/J9PTCfX3Hm
It was a great honor to serve with John Dingell. I learned so much from him and continue to learn from his wife @RepDebDingell who serves with such distinction. I’m so sorry to learn of his passing and ask everyone to keep the Dingell family in their prayers.

Here's more on the bill! https://t.co/pBX7d6DYjf
It’s important to restore public faith in our democracy. Protecting voting rights, strengthening ethics rules to ensure that public officials serve the public interest, and reducing the role of big money in politics are vital first steps. #HR1 does all these things. 🇺🇸🗳️🔦
Americans deserve to know who is paying for the political ads they see online, and we deserve to know that the nation’s election watchdog is walking the beat and protecting our democracy.
I’m excited that the first bill the House has taken up this year, #HR1, includes two bipartisan proposals for which I’ve advocated- the #HonestAds Act and a bill that reforms the Federal Election Commission, the nation's election watchdog.
Americans deserve a Congress that approaches its work in innovative new ways. I’m honored to have been chosen to lead the committee tasked with coming up with the ways to modernize Congress and get it working for the people again. 		I can't wait to start.		https://t.co/lYgfLhs9sw
This committee represents an important step forward in renovating the House.  Americans deserve a Congress where they have a say and things get done.  They deserve a Congress that uses cutting-edge technology and that is as diverse as our nation. 2/3
It has been clear for a long time that the House is a fixer-upper. Every time bills are written behind closed doors or passed without debate, every time Americans feel like they don’t have a say and too little is getting done, people lose faith. Congress needs to do better. 1/3

The @seattletimes is right: Veterans deserve better. It is unacceptable that veterans aren't receiving the GI Bill benefits they've earned. The VA must pay #veterans what they're owed, &amp; the government must fix the breakdowns that led to this problem. https://t.co/jHntf5Rc4p

Federal workers in our region maintain Navy ships, care for veterans, deliver the mail, welcome visitors at the national park, prep timber sales and do other critical jobs. Cancelling cost of living increases is wrong for them - and for our local economy.  https://t.co/NmUEh7BxLm
Federal workers aren’t Democrats or Republicans when they’re at work. They are public servants that prep timber sales in federal forests, welcome visitors to national parks, ensure citizens can get the services they need, and keep us safe. 		They are not pawns in a game. https://t.co/bqd7TM9BuR

Today, we remember the 20 children and 6 adults from #SandyHook Elementary who were taken from us six years ago. In my time in Congress, I've seen far too many moments of silence and far too few moments of action. That must change.

If you are a veteran and your #GIBill stipend is late or you've been underpaid, there is a #Veterans Administration GI Bill hotline that may be able to help: 1-888-442-4551		If that doesn't work and you live in WA-06, let me know: https://t.co/ktAX5S6xNt		I work for you.

I'm also going to keep fighting against actions that contribute to #climatechange,  harm our environment and risk our region's jobs and economy, like the plan to drill for oil off our coasts.
These funds will help the tribe build a new school on higher ground to make sure their kids are safe when disaster strikes. I'll keep pushing for investments that make tribal and coastal communities more resilient in the face of rising seas, and under the threat of tsunamis.

About 40% of Americans in rural communities don’t have #broadband. That makes it harder to start a business or do homework.

A healthy Puget Sound is important for so many reasons — including the ability to go catch (and eat) some crabs! Yesterday, my family had a great time out on the water pulling up some crab pots.

HAPPENING NOW: I'm having a conversation with some of the folks who are helping our friends and neighbors battling #opioid addiction and leading the effort to address this public health crisis. We are on Facebook Live. You can tune in here📺: https://t.co/3tlMJgQm6p
Today's vote tally 121 for &amp; 301 against the #immigration bill was a bipartisan rejection of a compromise between the far right and very far right. I'm for protecting our border, reforming the system and certainty for dreamers. That's why I'm for the bipartisan #USAAct.
Today w/ @CongressmanGT @SenAmyKlobuchar @sensasse &amp; a bipartisan group of lawmakers, I introduced the Skills Investment Act of 2018. It creates lifelong learning accounts. Workers can use these tax-advantaged savings accounts to learn new skills &amp; thrive in our changing economy.
Public unions fight for better pay, fair working hours and safe workplaces. That benefits every worker.  #Janus #union https://t.co/zZ6hku5ggq
I’m disappointed by today’s Supreme Court decision to uphold the travel ban. This is bad policy that Congress needs to fix. #SCOTUS
Congress should make it easier to participate in our democracy, not harder. On the 5th anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, Congress should protect and expand the right to vote by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act. #RestoreTheVote
Update #3: I was unable to meet with any parents today but will keep trying. ICE has offered a tour later this week and I will return. In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting for our American values. #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/vK0pX5Ioyg
Update #2: The Presidents exec order did not reunite separated families. It’s difficult just to visit them. The challenge of reuniting families will be immense. Especially for young children who can’t communicate. #familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/ekzclIfu61

The #LWCF has built parks in places like Tacoma and protected forestland and shellfish beds in Kitsap and Mason Counties. The LWCF's 600 projects in our region support WA's $1.6bn outdoor economy, and thousands of jobs. Congress must prevent it from expiring in 100 days.
Today the House passed a deeply partisan #FarmBill, the same exact one it failed to pass in May. The Farm Bill is supposed to be about people, but this bill is not. I spoke out against it in May, and it is just as bad now as it was then. https://t.co/hwybgvczn8

Today I joined communities in Tacoma as we recommitted ourselves to furthering Dr. King’s legacy. We must work towards a society that recognizes and fixes the systemic injustices that prevent far too many of its members from being able to write their own destines #mlkjrday https://t.co/Oz2b7p9fet
Great to see everyone tonight at the Shelton-Mason County Chamber of Commerce Awards! Thanks for doing business here! https://t.co/yMJMMBJpjh
I stopped by Paneltech today. There’s a sign in my office that says compete with everyone, everyday, everywhere, forever. That’s what’s happening in Hoquiam, thanks in part to an @SBAgov loan which helps Paneltech sell what they make here overseas and compete in more places. https://t.co/8UQpb7Sj5l
Happy Friday from a rainy Westport! I’m here talking to fishermen about the salmon habitat restoration, jobs &amp; how the plan I oppose to drill off our coasts could affect folks in our neck of the woods. https://t.co/7wgjQYFGx1

New Year…Newhouse—I recently had a chance to sit down with my friend and colleague @RepNewhouse for my podcast. Tune in to hear about differences in working in Congress vs. the WA state legislature, beer, and as always, our favorite movies. https://t.co/cfFbTIKb8D
If you serve our country, we should have your back.  I’m proud to announce an opportunity in my office for a #veteran through the Wounded Warriors Fellowship Program. RT to share with folks that might be interested. More here: https://t.co/DEhkKQvh1C
Today is #lawenforcementappreciationday. It has been a really tough week for our community. Officers, dispatchers, support staff and families—thank you. Say thanks to a police officer today if you see one.
I am following the developments closely, and will work to support Sheriff Pastor and other relevant authorities as this situation unfolds.
We also grieve with Deputy McCartney's colleagues who have put their own emotions aside as they search for the person that did this so our community can seek justice.
I read in news reports that Deputy McCartney was 34 years old, a veteran, husband and the father of three young boys. While I can't personally imagine the pain his family is feeling, I hope they know our community grieves with them today over the loss of a brave &amp; selfless man.
I am holding Pierce County Sheriff’s Deputy Daniel A. McCartney and his family in my prayers this morning.
The Mochi Tsuki Festival on Bainbridge Island was fantastic!Thanks to the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Community and President Clarence Moriwaki for the mochi, origami lessons, and the amazing Taiko Drumming. Tess and I had a blast!!! https://t.co/zJgJnCJVLU

For decades, Democrats &amp; Republicans agreed that opening the waters off our coast to drilling would be shortsighted &amp; wrong. It could threaten our fisheries, shellfish growers, tourism, &amp; jobs in key sectors of our economy. I’ll be fighting against the Trump Admin. proposal
Before serving as your Representative I worked in economic development, so I always enjoy meeting with local leaders who are working to grow our economy &amp; bring more jobs to our region.

Today I’m voting no on the #taxbill, which I think is a tremendous missed opportunity to grow our economy, boost small businesses, and help middle class families get ahead. Here’s why: https://t.co/4UOV63cRMH
I’ll be following this closely as the NTSB does their work, and will use the full power of this office to help the people who are affected by this tragedy and to try to prevent future tragedies like this.
Thanks to the passengers who got out of their cars immediately after the incident and bravely pitched in to help people—that tells you all you need to know about how strong our region is. We have each other’s backs.
Thanks to the federal, state, and local officials who are working to respond to this as well as to the news organizations who have been working to keep everyone informed with the facts.
Thanks to all of our amazing first responders and medical teams around the region who responded so well and so quickly, to the teams at Joint Base Lewis-McChord who helped out today, the Washington State Patrol, the Red Cross and our community blood centers
On behalf of our community, I took to the House floor to express our condolences to everyone affected by the #AmtrakDerailment today. I am thinking about everyone back home tonight. https://t.co/oCTgLySI6E

Quick summary of how the #taxbill treats the middle class. https://t.co/NbdOaWrSxz
I offered to work with Republicans on #taxreform because I believe we need good tax reform. Instead #specialinterests wrote it behind closed doors.
The #TaxBill adds trillions to the debt, it will lead to slower economic growth than paid-for tax reform. As a result of the growing debt, Americans will see slower wage growth, higher interest payments, and fewer jobs.
I voted against the #tax bill today. It caters to the wealthy, raises #middleclass taxes &amp; adds to the debt which slows growth. https://t.co/iwjszRCZTB #derekvotes https://t.co/YcJwo4xIik

Glen on Facebook said "Welcome to the 21st century... important questions and answers at &lt;140 characters each"
You may see some effort to update these laws. (4/4)

I know it's frustrating, but I'm optimistic there are folks - on both sides - who want to get our nation - and this Congress - back to work.
Part of the problem is that both parties need to stop defining success as making the other guys look bad. That gig is up.

Simple principle: If you don’t do your job, then you shouldn’t be paid! Congress should live by the same principle (2/2)
