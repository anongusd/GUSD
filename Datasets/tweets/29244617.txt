Fellow Republicans absolutely light @AGJoshHawley on fire in this Politico story. Their assessment of Hawley and his campaign: lackadaisical, sluggish, low energy, squandering his shot. And Republicans' reaction? "Pissed" and "disappointed."	https://t.co/raqmZAYqDL
Kansas still looks like a deep red state when you consider that Democrats haven't managed to find candidates for three top offices just two weeks before the filing deadline. That's bad news for the party this year and even worse for building their bench.	https://t.co/WaFS1B0SiD
To hear Gov. Eric Greitens tell it, yesterday's developments confirmed that he's been innocent all along. But the governor still faces another felony charge, and lawmakers who support impeachment say nothing's changed. This isn't over.	https://t.co/A8RWyFEc5m
