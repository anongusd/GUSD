@RealBasedMAGA @frokensverige I don’t know which country she’s in but seeing as she’s speaking English I can only assume they’re broadcasting from an English speaking country and that is a little hypocritical to be criticizing multiculturalism when its that very same thing that affords you to live there.
@RealBasedMAGA @frokensverige The only intolerance she shows is when she goes on to talk about multiculturalism and the west which apparently doesn’t have right and wrong because we are a democracy and we don’t get our laws from a God.
@RealBasedMAGA @frokensverige What is she saying expect that she as a Muslim and other Muslims should not accept Christmas to participate in celebrating it because it goes against their beliefs? Maybe intolerant of her to tell other Muslims what to do but where did she say Christians can’t celebrate Islam?

@CarlHagberg69 @HansHedenby @EvaBazo1 @Attilapia Förberedelse till våldtäkt?...oavsett om han kände till tvånget eller inte eftersom att flickan ändå är minderårig och man rimligen kan anta att han ämnat fullborda äktenskapet han ingått i.
@CarlHagberg69 @HansHedenby @EvaBazo1 @Attilapia Inte medveten om att flickan tvingades? Var han medveten om flickans ålder?

@Alisand3 @ik238 @SenFeinstein You do and no, you can’t seek asylum from an embassy. However you can argue why they don’t seek asylum in Mexico although personally I feel it’s because Mexico is not safe for a refugee as people are also fleeing Mexico, but the argument is valid.
@ik238 @SenFeinstein She just said they’d be doing it legally if they presented themselves at a point of entry seeking asylum and she didn’t mean that’s “one” legal way of doing it. It’s the only way to seek asylum. You can’t apply from your own country. Why, I’m not sure but that’s how it works.
@truthtruncheon @Abdulaziz_MSM @salahuddinsidd5 @cnni I’m not saying something can’t come out of nothing, it obviously can because the universe did but you’re trying to argue something can’t come out of nothing therefore there must have been a creator.

@OxyFPS @AnthonyMackie I also don’t believe the police is more racist than any other people, and I find movies like these to be incredibly unfair, but when a few of them get away just as if a few criminals got away with their crime scot free it corrupts the entire system, needlessly.
@OxyFPS @AnthonyMackie Do rich African Americans also commit violent crimes at the same rate? Poverty and social issues go hand in hand with crime in any society.
@OxyFPS @AnthonyMackie I don’t understand this argument comparing criminals to cops? Of course there is always going to be bad people out there in the world that do bad things that’s why in every society we have a criminal justice system complete with laws and police officers to protect the public.
@FoxNews Why is he making the assumption that men won’t qualify for asylum and therefore will have to cross illegally? Do only women and children qualify for asylum?
@jullian_king @ChibweChikwa @HelenClarkNZ @siphophiri @PaulKagame Of course it’s relevant. In countries where women don’t fully have equal rights or face discrimination (male preference over girls in who gets an education, FGM etc) it’s not unfair to set a quota based on gender. In contrast it assures fairness and a more natural balance.

@MarshaWarfield Why would she go back to that same store? Seems like she’s looking for attention.
@MarshaWarfield The mother yelled at her because she trust her pelvic at her child. You can see her in the video although she seems to have forgotten that part saying the mother just “decided to yell at her” and so that’s why she called the police on the little boy.
@jekarrenbauer @Nyheterna Men de var ju så enade. Hur kan de ha varit det om de inte ens hade en plan?

@Sanspareille @shaunking suspicious because men aren’t victims and we would assume they had a sexual intention with their actions. Of course no man would do this just to get attention because a man wouldn’t want this kind of attention.
@Sanspareille @shaunking She sexualizes young black boys and by calling her a racist we are in a sense also treating the little boy as a grown man. Women are histrionic or attention seeking showing a lack of boundaries if they act inappropriate while if a man sexualizes a child it is immediately very
@Sanspareille @shaunking And furthermore if this was a white man, although maybe they wouldn’t bend over the register like that, and the victim a little black girl and he thrusted his pelvic at her because she “touched” his ass would anyone be calling him a “racist”?
@Sanspareille @shaunking I did see that. To be honest it looked like she walked up to the register to bend over it as if she thought someone was looking at her ass  right before the child is about to cross her path as he’s leaving the store. I think she’s mentally ill and severely lacking in boundaries.
@bern821 @Aton_Eloh @shaunking Clearly this woman isn’t well or perhaps severely lacks boundaries because even if he had touched her ass the more reasonable response would be to turn to the mother assuming the boy doesn’t know what’s appropriate behavior not turning it sexual by making lewd gestures.
@bern821 @Aton_Eloh @shaunking Was she air-humping at the little boy? It looked like that’s what she was doing that prompted the mother to go back inside the store and tell her off which is what made her mad enough to call the cops because the mother pointed out she did something inappropriate at a child.
@shaunking This is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen and she’s just smiling the whole time. If she knew that was a book-bag and she accused a child of sexually assaulting her anyway then really I think she is the one sexually assaulting the child making sexual allusions at a child.

@TheJeffBurkett @thehill How do you conclude she was done? Reading the article and looking at the picture it looks like she was still speaking which he himself acknowledges in his apology.
@TheJeffBurkett @thehill Obviously she wasn’t. He took the microphone from her.
@TheJeffBurkett @thehill Reading the article it was her turn to speak. He had the chance to rebuttal after her if he just waited his turn.
@Eli414 @thehill @DRQuam To be fair this doesn’t have anything to do with women. Debates are intense and some people can’t handle them so they get angry instead of coming up with an argument. We can’t assume he wouldn’t do this to a male opponent given his behavior.

@xxSachinx @IndiaToday @ShivAroor Not sure what’s so illegal about refugees but people who say that don’t care about taxes or how much blood you donate. They see Indians in their country and think England should be for English people just as you just wrote, “India for Indians”.

@ceboboe @FoxNews @RepSwalwell Well then even if that were true an investigation would be quick and easy and maybe even prove she’s lying but if you’re arguing it doesn’t matter because he was a minor you obviously believe he did it.
@ceboboe @FoxNews @RepSwalwell Attempted rape is still illegal wether you’re a minor or an adult. Ridiculous argument. You don’t get a pass because you weren’t caught or the victim was too ashamed to report it if the statue of limitations haven’t run out yet, assuming he’s guilty as you seem to be doing.
@thehill Being the victim of a crime like embezzlement doesn’t compare to the shame and guilt or personal violation you feel as the victim of a sexual assault not to mention no one would argue it’s your fault for being so gullible in the first place the thief had no choice but to rob you.

@ViralCancer @thehill Which isn’t the same as what he did doesn’t amount to sexual assault.
@ViralCancer @thehill Or they just can’t prove he sexually assaulted her but he admitted he physically assaulted her or threatened her to such an extent that it counts as felony assault. It depends on how you interpret that last answer from the Alaskan law department.
@ViralCancer @thehill Although I do see now they only say the assault isn’t classified as a sex crime. It doesn’t say wether they mean the felony assault he plead guilty to or the sexual assault he was charged with. It’s kind of a vague answer.
@ViralCancer @thehill The article states felony assault doesn’t classify as a sex crime because that’s what he plead guilty to, not that the initial chargers of sexual assault don’t classify as a sex crime. If it can’t be proven it means they can’t prove he did it, not that it isn’t a sex crime.
@ViralCancer @thehill accepted the deal because of his rehabilitation prospects.
@ViralCancer @thehill Your right he plead guilty to only 1 count felony assault which isn’t a sex crime but the governor now wants to toughen the laws for sex crimes. It doesn’t say his actions didn’t meet the requirements for sexual assault or kidnapping, maybe they just couldn’t prove it, the judge
@ViralCancer @thehill Why would they prosecute him and make him plead guilty to chargers he can’t be prosecuted for? You can’t trump up a charge for a crime that wouldn’t classify under the charge.
@ViralCancer @thehill He plead guilty of sexual assault and strangulation and there was even a kidnapping charge. Why would he plead guilty to those chargers if the law didn’t classify his crimes as such?
@thehill I guess every laywer in Alaska can now sue on behalf of their clients. “My client who was unfairly sentenced to prison also wishes to get a second pass keeping in mind the time they’ve already served and good behavior” since apparently sexual assault isn’t illegal in Alaska.
@thehill No wonder he got away with this as there was apparently no push back from the D.A who also thinks the man lost his job so he’s already suffered enough that he shouldn’t be held accountable for the consequences of his own actions too.
@thehill So he was charged with kidnapping along with sexual assault? Does that mean this wasn’t even some random woman he met in a bar but someone he actually kidnapped and then sexually assaulted and he gets a pass? Because he says he’ll never do it again? And this is legal in Alaska?

@john_daloia @gracieleo5 @CBSThisMorning So wouldn’t an investigation prove all that? He could clear his name.
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews And saying he shouldn’t have to bare the weight of the metoo movement? Right now he’s bearing the weight of whyididntreport because of Trumps stupid comments and now her terrible arguments.
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews The fact that there aren’t any more allegations against him from the time of his job as a judge doesn’t prove anything. Maybe he simply grew up, stopped drinking and realized what’s at stake as he got a little smarter. The second allegation isn’t as incredible as it seems.
@bearden_white Why would they say that though? I get it happens and I don’t disbelieve you but legally what is the relevance? If you’re drunk you can’t remember? If you’re dressed suggestively it means you went out intending to have sex therefore it’s more likely it was consensual?
RT @RonanFarrow: A new allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh surfaces, this time from his years at Yale. The latest from…
@CarlSowers3 @MSNBC Would your allegation be credible? Are you being nominated to the position of justice of the Supreme Court for life? Could you be extorted to sway your ruling? Also what were you wearing, how much did you have to drink, are you a proven liar who makes facetious allegations online
@PandionInt @terrycrews I guess the only thing stopping people from making up allegations they know can’t be proven or disproven is that no one wants to put themselves through all this just to smear someone’s name with a mere allegation though if they are lying they do run the risk of being exposed.
@cdoboe_doboe @NPR @KQED They can’t say “Clarissa”?
@tedcruz that she thought it was her apartment just because she’s a police officer. It seems to me he’s riding the anti-BLM movement and blue lives matter wave for the sake of it to appeal to a certain voter base while at the same time blaming Beto O’Rourke of being racially dividing?
@tedcruz This specific case doesn’t make any sense. The cops defense that she thought it was her apartment or the evidence that has since circulated against her. She never mentioned drugs. Ted doesn’t think so either. He certainly doesn’t really believe we should all take her word for it
@FoxNews This will likely piss off some conservatives.

@romyreiner @thehill Their reasoning is that it didn’t happen, he didn’t try to rape her or he didn’t do anything wrong but maybe they fooled around or something cause “if it did happen...there wasn’t even any intercourse, maybe a touch...” and all boys do this?
@thehill Pin someone down and try to rape them?Actually most high school boys don’t go that far but what an odd way to defend someone? Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations, does he really appreciate them making excuses for him?

@CharlotteCordet @amydeaugustine @CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama I didn’t make a straw man out of anyone’s argument. I simply responded to the hyperbole language and the suggestion that regulations are put in place merely to sabotage and control the people with the added intention of destroying America.
@CharlotteCordet @amydeaugustine @CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama Who are you referring to me?
@misterbadkat @thehill So he tried to rape her because she’s a slut? But you apparently think he tried to rape her if you’re arguing she deserved it.
@TIME 😱
@amydeaugustine @CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama I’m from Sweden. What’s wrong with living here?
@amydeaugustine @CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama Really that’s what regulations are?Why don’t we let people do whatever they want then? Why do we have laws? Is it just to control people and keep them down?
@CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama Is it illegal to move your business elsewhere and hire foreigners?
@CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama But back to the point what does removing regulations have to do with companies moving their production oversees? Are you saying Obama was the reason companies started doing that with his regulations?
@CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama Don’t companies have the right to hire whoever they want?
@CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama So what is the president supposed to do about that if companies want to move their factories oversees because it’s cheaper and hire poor people from poorer countries because you don’t have to pay them as much?
@DeniceBradbury @CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama How will a wall raise wages for the working class and what about the tunnels or the people overstaying their visas? How will a multibillion-dollar wall stopp that? How is the wall currently in place over large portions of the U.S- Mexico border stopping illegal immigration?
@CJohnston329 @peace1 @ABC @BarackObama What are regulations? Why do we have them? Why didn’t anybody else think of that if it were that easy?
@politico A lot of victims within the movement also don’t come forward until years after so what does that say about them? So far Sarah Sanders is the one that’s been the smartest about her public statement. One things clear though, they seem to really be against an FBI investigation.
@realDonaldTrump I don’t understand the point he’s making. If he was saying there’s no proof and why did the Dems sit on the information for so long I would understand or even it’s not the jurisdiction of the FBI but to claim they don’t really want to know as a reason against it makes no sense?
@realDonaldTrump They don’t want to know the answers? So the Dems are saying they want an FBI investigation because they don’t want to know the truth? They’re only doing this to destroy and delay and therefore an FBI investigation isn’t necessary? What the fuck are you hiding?
@realDonaldTrump So it was just a little bit bad then? Like a forceful kiss? Groping but only using one hand? And that’s why she didn’t go to the police because it wasn’t that “serious” not because it didn’t happen? He doesn’t seem to be denying the attack occurred at all.
@AP What does he mean “that bad”? Shouldn’t he be saying it didn’t happen?
@ABC What’s more interesting is who’s doing the presidents job for him since it’s obvious he doesn’t know what he’s talking about when he speaks (or maybe he’s trying to sound stupid on purpose because he thinks his voters are stupid or to make us believe he is stupid (?))?
@SusanMahne @FoxNews @7eleven I wonder what choice that kid has to say no to his mother (if that was indeed her son) if let’s say he doesn’t want to steal things and be a public nuisance like his mother.
@gavinseim @FoxNews @7eleven Although I question the 5000$ reward over 200$ worth of product, probably says more about society than the police, it’s not ok for her to throw coffee and tell her son to steal some stuff on the way out. She could’ve asked the pricing before and where’s Child services.

@Politikern96 @Sambandet @strandhall @sdriks Kan man se sig själv som djupt religiös kristen då som svensk? Vad är det för skillnad exakt mellan judendomen och kristendomen i den aspekten? Om man har två föräldrar, ena same och ena svensk, hur gör man då?
@thehill I feel sorry for the media that have to report on Trump because no matter what he says it’s so ridiculous nobody will believe he really said it.
@hardball @MSNBC @megynkelly Maybe because of what Megyn Kelly has had to go through she thinks that’s fair and sees this as Dr. Blasey Fords only option but how is it supposed to be “empowering” as she puts it if it’s all on his terms without a proper and unbiased investigation?

@Politikern96 @Sambandet @strandhall @sdriks Ja, man kanske ska hålla ett val. Man kan prata med hur många judar och samer man vill men om man inte frågar alla kan man ju inte säga att alla känner likadant. Därefter kan man säga att de judar och samer som inte ser sig själva som svenskar inte är svenskar.

@MerreToto @JonatanH Är inte V med dem rödgröna? Vad händer om V röstar med S och MP? Vad händer om SD röstar med Alliansen eller om Alliansen väljer att samarbeta med SD? Kommer dem hålla vad dem lovat eller kommer man göra som man gjorde när SD kom in i riksdagen?
@MerreToto @JonatanH Ja, om man räknar bort vänstern så.
@MerreToto @JonatanH Ja, därför att man inte vill acceptera valresultatet så klart och vill att S ska vika sig och låta alliansen bilda regering. Valresultatet är som det är.
@MerreToto @JonatanH S fick flest röster och majoriteten av befolkningen vill ha S som sin regering men du resonerar att det inte är så för att de tappat väljare men då har moderaterna tappt flest väljare enligt det här valresultatet. Eller är det C som ska regera?
@buydebts @Reuters Are you insane? Can you make sense? I think you need help, sorry.
@Politikern96 @Sambandet @strandhall @sdriks Kan man inte vara både same eller jude och svensk på samma gång och alltså ha minoritetsställning på grund av ens unika kulturarv? Måste alla svenskar ha minoritetsställning för att det ska vara rättvist?
@buydebts @Reuters Did she have sex with another politician 200 years ago? What are you talking about?
@AlphaMALE384 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Since when has the US ever played fair? Of course if they did China manipulating their own currency would have been unfair. I’m not sure you grasp the concept of fairness. It seems to me it’s only unfair if other countries do whatever it takes to win.

@MartinH157 @WAndyKnight1 @BBCNews I guess these Russians are just poisoning themselves then. Maybe they just hate themselves for not loving Putin enough.
@Sambandet @strandhall @sdriks Varför då antyda att hon hittar på saker som SD inte sagt? Hon hittar ju inte på att Björn Söder uttalat sig på det sättet utan du menar att judar och samer själva inte ser sig som svenskar och därför hittar Annika Strandhall på.
@MerreToto @JonatanH De vann valet alltså ska de få styra Sverige. Alliansen kan lätt fälla de rödgrönas förslag om SD röstar med dem. De kan också mot vad de lovat sina väljare gå ihop sig med SD för att i efterhand bli större än de rödgröna. De kan inte kräva att S backar för att själva få regera.
@AlphaMALE384 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump It’s their currency to manipulate. What’s unfair? Does the U.S play fair or do they play to win? So China beat the U.S at their own game. How is it any different? A trade war is just petty and unjustifiable. Diplomacy would have been the better answer.

@feminspe @strandhall @sdriks Kan man inte vara båda?
@Sambandet @strandhall @sdriks Men då hittar hon ju inte på. Både Björn Söder och du menar på att judar och samer inte är svenskar. Sen kan man argumentera för det hur man vill.
@Kaksmulorna @casvaIuir @FredricMorenius @Nonemo @GlbSocialism Var tror du att kontanterna går?
@MerreToto @JonatanH Vad försöker du komma fram till?
@FredricMorenius @Nonemo @GlbSocialism Hur många svenskar skulle egentligen klara ett sånt prov? Förutom de mest övergripande delarna som alla kan.
@MerreToto @JonatanH Valet. Vad annars?
@MerreToto @JonatanH Ja, om socialdemokraterna fick 28% av all röster och alla andra partier fick mindre. Moderaterna, det näst största fick bara 19%.
@FredricMorenius @Nonemo @GlbSocialism Eller hur ska man lösa frågan? Ska man bara ge skydd och uppehållstillstånd till asylsökande men inte rätt att rösta förrän de lärt sig tillräckligt bra svenska och klarat ett prov i samhällskunskap?
@FredricMorenius @Nonemo @GlbSocialism Dem flesta invandrare som jobbar och går i skolan behärskar nog svenska tillräckligt för att kunna göra sig förstådda i tal och skrift och hänga med i konversationer, sen kanske det är lite svårare att förstå politikerna och hänga med i debatterna på tv. Är man inte svensk då?
@FredricMorenius @Nonemo @GlbSocialism Ska de alltså inte få rösta menar du därför att du anser att deras kunskaper är undermåliga? Ska de då tvingas betala skatt, inkomstskatt moms etc om de inte får vara med och bestämma hur de vill att Sverige ska styras?
@MerreToto @JonatanH Då anser de att de vunnit kanske för att de ändå blev största parti även om de inte skulle tro på blockpolitik.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump He initiates a trade war against China because China has been taking unfair advantage of the U.S economically (so has the U.S.). China retaliates, the farmers are the ones to take the hit so they blame China, then he blames China and ends up looking like the good guy basically?
@Lauritab @ABC Every women is in a position to do something about it right away unless they’re being held captive or blocked somehow from going to the police. So now you believe her but you don’t believe it was kavanagh who did it?
@Lauritab @ABC How do you know? You just said you knew women who fear coming out so why do you think she waited so long?
@ABC It goes in line with what he’s said about women who speak up about sexual harassment in the workplace. He thinks women lie to destroy mens carrier and get money (he doesn’t realize his dad’s lying) so he sees this story where there isn’t any proof and he thinks she’s lying too.
@thehill Why did he have to say that? Why do these republicans and Fox News people feel the need to act so defensive every time? Why can’t this woman be responsible for her own actions? What does that have to do with other police officers? Why keep enabling these “bad apples”?
@AP That’s all you can really ask at this point and they did it. Smart choice. You have to investigate for proof.

@growlingpanther @lewiesmom @politico If what you mean to say is all high school boys are guilty because they are accused then it would be sarcasm, still not what you’re saying though. You’re implying all guys could be guilty of inappropriate sexual behavior which is a whole nother thing.
@growlingpanther @lewiesmom @politico I was referring to your initial tweet where you imply all high school boys do this; not that there isn’t any evidence to this story and therefore we can’t judge but that we should lock up all high school boys because they all do this.
@ArtTomas4 @politico What an excellent point, because then it’s ok?
@growlingpanther @lewiesmom @politico Obviously you don’t believe in facts or you only believe in them when it’s convenient to you otherwise you wouldn’t have made up the part about a kiss just to fill in the blanks on what you believe might have happened. There isn’t any proof that’s all. Not all HS boys rape.
@growlingpanther @lewiesmom @politico How can you say this woman is lying and in the same breath claim all high school boys do this? Either he didn’t do it and it’s wrong or he did. Where did you get kiss from? She said he tried to hold her down and rape her not kiss her.
@thatdudedurrell @BlackRoses_888 @politico It’s unfortunate then that the republicans tried to hide and block information on him because it makes him look guilty of any accusation even when there isn’t any evidence. Kind of played right in to the Democrats hand there then huh right along with the way he answers questions.

@vja3000 @ConfidentialGa You’re saying it makes a difference in a child’s life wether they are raised by a straight couple or a gay one therefore straight parents could in some cases be preferred at the discretion of the agencies, unless you didn’t mean that either. Problem is there are too many kids.
@vja3000 @ConfidentialGa So you’re saying they’d rather be alone without parents until they age out of the system than be with loving gay parents and potentially be bullied by their peers? Maybe we should let the kids decide then?

@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Och säger då att de inte är riktiga svenskar och därför inte passar in och det är ju det här som är det skickliga i talet.
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus grund av den höga arbetslösheten bland invandrarna, alltså är inte invandrare integrerade bara för att de jobbar (?) så varför är det så svårt för ”...dem här invandrarna att få jobb?”. Finns det kanske grupper av invandrare som jobbar och grupper som inte jobbar och inte får
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus integration. Att man jobbar och är med och bidrar borde rimligen betyda att man är en del av samhället men det hjälper inte att man ger dem jobb utan det är tydligen fortfarande ett problem även om invandrarna jobbar för vi ser ju problemen med ökad utanförskap i samhället på
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus ordentligt eller inte kan anpassa sig av olika skäl -men är det arbetslösheten bland nyanlända som ännu inte hunnit lära sig svenska som är problemet?- utan det är oklart vad eller vilken specifik grupp invandrare han isåfall syftar på. 	Han pekar på jobb som ett mått på
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Sen talar han om ”förutsättningar” att bli svensk utan att gå in på något specifikt men går vidare på att vi bemöter nyanlända på deras villkor däribland språket för att de ska integrera sig. Han säger egentligen aldrig att invandrare inte får jobb därför att de inte kan svenska
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus ”Jobb är viktigt.” ”Bara invandrarna får jobb så kommer allt att lösa sig....” ”Det händer ju inte.” ”Det blir inte så och därför så måste man ställa sig frågan: varför är det så svårt för de här människorna att få jobb?”.  ”För att de inte är svenskar och inte passar in”.
@Iskra A body that just won’t quit.
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Invandrare som hoppar SFI och går arbetslösa när de inte får jobb för att de inte kan svenska alltså?
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Du gör som du vill å förståss upp till dig hur du väljer att tolka JÅs svar om han syftade på nyanlända som han menar inte får jobb därför att de inte kan svenska och inte förstår våra sedvanor (är det ett problem)?Eller är det invandrare som inte kan och inte förstår vår kultur?
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Nu går vi runt i cirklar. Det är inte nyanlända som söker jobb utan invandrare som är redo att börja jobba. För nyanlända som inte kan svenska finns SFI. Det är lätt att säga att någon inte passar in men på vilket sätt är dessa invandrare som talar svenska inte svenskar?
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Man ger inte asylsökande som inte har arbetstillstånd eller kan svenska jobb? Dem får ju gå i skolan för att lära sig, svenska, det svenska samhället på SFI där dem får betyg som alla andra. Det här handlar om invandrare som JÅ menar inte får jobb därför att dem inte passar in.
@LiEriks @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Kan man inte identifiera sig med både den kinesiska och den svenska kulturen om man bott i Kina hela sitt vuxna liv till exempel och blivit en del av samhället? Ja, du kan förklara vad Jimmie Åkesson menar med att det tydligen inte löser problemet att en invandrare jobbar?
@Fredrik_Sandh @annieloof ”Smälter in i miljön”? Om man vill ha ett jobb får man inte vara annorlunda eller sticka ut ur mängden menar du?
@Fredrik_Sandh @annieloof Det han sa var att invandrare inte får jobb för att de inte är svenskar och inte passar in och pekar ut jobb och språk som viktiga förutsättningar (men bara för att invandrare jobbar löser det tydligen ändå inte problemet), inte att invandrare som inte anpassat sig inte får jobb.
@ZZCOOL @BellaHellz @thereseverdun @Mariastockhaus Kan man inte känna sig både svensk och ha en annan kulturell identitet? Om man har föräldrar från två olika länder då?
@LucyDane4 @thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Men tydligen är det inte tillräckligt för invandrare jobbar utan bara för att invandrarna får jobb så tror man att det löser allt så det är ju fortfarande ett problem?
@thereseverdun @BellaHellz @Mariastockhaus Blir man kines när man gått i skolan och lärt sig kinesiska då? När man fått jobb och börjar betala skatt till Kina?

@jrg0569 @ABC Does that go for men too?

@AndrausPetorius @ABC So you think he’s lying about being pro-life?
@pg_gustafsson @kidahl @evgud Det var två exempel som tog några dagar att ta fram och det är ju lite det som är grejen. Det handlar inte om enstaka fall man använder emot SD för att visa att dem inte är perfekta utan problemet är ju att det här händer gång på gång igen. Vad beror det på?
@tistel @nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Ok, visst jag ska inte anta att han menar något annat än illegala invandrare men då har inte finansieringen av den legala invandringen något med diskussionen att göra.
@tistel @nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Och sen antar jag att han egentligen menar invandrare och inte illegala, vilket är viktigt att skilja åt eftersom att invandrare inte är illegala bara för att dem kommit hit och sökt asyl, men har jag fel i det antagandet?
@tistel @nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Skrev han inte det? Var det jag som hävdade att skattepengar går till illegala?
@Jeff_Ahl Vill ni inte skicka hem invandrare?
@tistel @nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Men visst vi kan diskutera. Är det fördomar att tro att invandrare jobbar och betalar skatt och tillockmed skapar jobb och generar vinster för Sverige?
@tistel @nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Vilka fördomar har jag sedan 1 klass? Det jag skrev och frågade var om invandrare och asylsökande är detsamma som illegala och om illegala får skattepengar eftersom att det är så lätt när man blandar ihop termer och människor så där att man inte själv vet vad man menar längre.
@Sn00wman @Sorenjuvas @sdriks Det betyder att vi fritt får utöva vilken religon vi vill utan inblandning eller påtryckning från staten.
@Sorenjuvas @sdriks Ja, det kan man ju säga att dem är.
@Sorenjuvas @sdriks Nej, religionsfrihet för kristna religoner men inte islam. Om man är muslim och kommer hit till Sverige har man ingen rätt att få höra böneutrop tydligen men kyrkklockor däremot är inte att anse som avvikande och främmande och alltså inte lika provocerande...
@nikos_chef @pedersenerik @LOSverige Går skattepengar till illegala? Ser du alla invandrare och asylsökande som illegala?
@evanrachelwood How convenient for him as a man. He gets a slave.
@TrumpChic @LeonardAzuka @AP @realDonaldTrump How am I insulting his intelligence? Did Trump not say this? What’s so common sense about looking up to a man that doesn’t respect you? You could rationalize his statement to not mean everyone in your country if you think you’re the exception but why would you want to do that?
@LipponenSami @evgud @LenaHansson130 Men hur många gånger ska man använda det argumentet? Det är klart att sånna här uttalanden från enstaka personer drabbar partiet särkilt när det händer gång på gång.
@kidahl @evgud Vilka antisemitiska kommentarer har dem andra politikerna från dem andra partierna lagt upp på Facebook?
@Mancitybobby2 @Janeybean22 @MaggieAstor But there’s always an element of shock. No matter wether you think the person is going to become aggressive or not it’s such an aggressive act, especially the way he really puts his hand around her chest, you’re literally paralyzed with fear and you don’t know what to do.
@Mancitybobby2 @Janeybean22 @MaggieAstor He is doing something wrong but she’s afraid to say something because it’s rude even though it’s clear as light what he’s doing, to say something like that to a respectable bishop (while he disrespect her), in the middle of a ceremony with all those people watching.
@jk_rowling What a strange counterproductive argument? Are you calling Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson racist?
@LeonardAzuka @AP @realDonaldTrump He doesn’t love you. He calls your country a shithole country and doesn’t want your people coming to his.
@CommishFountain @AndrewGillum But if they can’t live because you don’t pay them enough they still have to go on government welfare payed by the taxpayers? I don’t understand this asinine argument. I could employ everyone too and create millions of jobs if I didn’t have to pay them except now I get free labor.
@KrisWilliams @FoxNews ...is not a real journalist and couldn’t hack it on her own so she has to track down formerly famous people currently down on their luck, to embarrass them just so she has something to give to her editor that lets her keep her job one more day.
@ABCPolitics @ABC Sing.
@deoncole If I sat next to you I’d have to talk to you. I couldn’t just ignore you without it being awkward.
@deoncole The shades, the gum, the way you are sitting...I want to party with you and hang out with you but if I’m looking for a seat on a flight and I can’t find an empty one I’m going to sit down next to the most neutral person I see that won’t dominate my territory. That’s human nature.
@dwandad1 @deoncole @Raqi_4Real I saw that too. Didn’t even cough which definitely means it’s a regular thing for the baby.

@iamjohnoliver Why is what China is doing to the U.S different then what the U.S has always done to the rest of the world? Or is China not allowed to win?
@iamjohnoliver Why does Peter Navarro think Trump needs another economist to provide insight to his instincts if he believes Trumps is always right? Why wouldn’t an economist be able to provide his own in-depth analysis?
@TDBaum @ABC @jonkarl Because he just died. It’s not like McCain died to make Trump look bad?
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders Union isn’t really market, neither is franchise monopolies banding together to push down wages. Unions are the check and balance to the corruptions of capitalism but that being said if this is all in order to a free market how then can you say they aren’t “worth” the pay-raise?
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders And as you say the workers have a right to not work there if they don’t agree to the level of compensation which is what has happened here. If the restaurants don’t want to pay their workers they don’t have to hire them, they can do the work themselves.
@KestonBean82 @Vulcaz @gio_time @SenSanders Yeah I mean you’re not actually supposed to live off of you’re earnings. You could just live off air or something.
@D____Marshall @foolsandkids @SenSanders Not if I provided you with enough hours to give you a fixed income per month though.
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders What you are talking about is if all the workers unite to use their power which is kind of what’s happened here.
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders And what will people live on in the meantime? If all the other restaurants are offering the same?
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders Doesn’t deserve it? How much do you think watching someone else’s restaurant and selling their food for them, making sure it’s nice and clean is worth an hour if we’re talking the fast food business. Would you stand for an hour and sell burgees for me for 5$? 6? 8?
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders Wether they are easily replaced or not is irrelevant. What matters is they provided the labour Disney hired them for regardless of who can perform the same labour.
@foolsandkids @D____Marshall @SenSanders And food and rent and healthcare aren’t needs?
@Kimble09 @RiqueTheRuler_ @Juic3E87 He said “that nigga is the best...”. Is this another Yanny/Laurel?
@bodebliss54 @politico I think if he ever met himself or a version of himself he’d be the first one to call that person out as an idiot and he’d be very loud about it, pointing out their faults and making fun of them. He just wouldn’t be able to realize they’re him.
@ConstanceWu Taking off your shoes inside your house is just common sense. More like the rest of the world versus America.
RT @politico: Well that was bizarre. Catch up with Trump's televised phone call today with Enrique Peña Nieto as they announced the U.S.—Me…
@politico So it isn’t an exaggeration every time the press reports how bad it went? Lots of people don’t know how to work those phones but he has no idea what he’s talking about in regards to the subject matter. I’m curious to know what Trump would think of himself if he saw what we see.
@SenSanders By essentially subsidizing unsustainable business models, how are we affecting innovation that could better our society?
@SenSanders Which is basically what below minimum wage is. Instead of taxing, wouldn’t minimum wage fix the problem? Minimum wage and tax cuts to incentivize business and reduce government aids?
@SenSanders Exactly. Why should the taxpayers have to subsidize employers so they don’t have to pay their workers just to increase their profits? If your cost outweighs your profit you don’t have a business. Why should the government subsidizes the dreams of people who are bad at business?
@foolsandkids @SenSanders You don’t think the workers generate sales for the company? Why should the CEOs be entitled to that money?  Anybody could be successful in business if they didn’t have to pay their workers. True innovation is more then moving capital around by collecting other people’s money.
@jeremymstamper @SenSanders Why even pay them at all? Why can’t they work for Disney for free?
@realDonaldTrump Is 52% good?
@amanda51381 @jk_rowling @lumos (4) when they are desperate. We’ve already seen he’s shady business-dealings and general dishonesty among other things and that is just what he is prepared to do to maintain his ego. So to do this to punish parents who are fleeing out of a desperate situation is cruel.
@amanda51381 @jk_rowling @lumos (3) which is why it’s a misdemeanor at best but a person like Trump who started complaining about how the media portrayed him when anyone running for president who sounded the way he does wouldn’t have been taken seriously, would be the first one to expect the rules bend for them
@amanda51381 @jk_rowling @lumos (2) Problem is sometimes asylum seekers are illegally denied their right to seek asylum by immigration officers who turned them away even at a legal port of entry. That being said it’s hard to say anyone wouldn’t jump the fence to save their kids if that was the only alternative
@amanda51381 @jk_rowling @lumos (1) You’re assuming she voluntarily left her child behind and that they give you a choice. Are you sure about that? We do needs rules and if she didn’t enter through a legal port of entry she should be deported together with her child and seek asylum at a legal port of entry.
@realDonaldTrump “Sympathy”? “Respect”? Really, he has respect for the late McCain and his family? But then how is he going to say how he woulda-coulda-shoulda gotten away in Vietnam? Why can’t he just find something nice to say but use words he actually means so they don’t sound so hollow.

@AndyWaters1000 @4johnbdawe @BBCWorld Since you’re suggesting because she’s generally considered beautiful he must have enjoyed it and must have wanted it, it couldn’t have been assault and therefore I’m asking you if it were a woman and a hot guy like Channing Tatum would you be saying the same?
@AndyWaters1000 @4johnbdawe @BBCWorld So I guess if we were talking about a young woman instead and a hot older guy in the same position you’d be saying the same? Or are you going to tell me it’s not the same because men and women are supposedly “different”?

@kelly_naimepas @4johnbdawe @BBCWorld “Seduce” is a problematic word and not mine to begin with.

@kelly_naimepas @4johnbdawe @BBCWorld Maybe what’s beautiful to you isn’t attractive to him but because she’s beautiful he couldn’t possibly have been sexually assaulted by her? He had to have wanted it because guys always want to have sex all the time?
@4johnbdawe @BBCWorld So if she wasn’t beautiful then it wouldn’t be the same?

@BrittanyRDixon @ABC I know but it’s hard to just let them go especially if they turn around and decide to take some more wigs. The store owner need to learn how to handle kids like that better so they don’t have to go trough that whole situation ever again but it’s difficult with kids like that.

@chriscolton1980 @KristinaZanotti @ABC No it’s not “the first” person or one person. Sweden’s decided to not give afghan people that are coming now or the ones that came a few years ago asylum, and they are deporting them because they say Afghanistan is safe now. That is what people like Elin is taking an issue with.
@beveridge @culver931 @lynshackklet @matthew_wintle @Serenit97952855 @PaulMiller1313 @ABC She didn’t break any laws.
@silicon_valets @BBCWorld I use the word brave because she put herself at risk live-streaming with her face and name on Facebook an action that would go on to go all over media and undoubtedly will serve her a lot of negative exposure for a long time ahead, all for something she believes in.
@silicon_valets @BBCWorld She already has. She’s an activist, it wasn’t a coincidence she was on that plane. She found out about the deportation though a friend in the camp and bought a ticket. The reason is that Sweden stopped giving asylum to people from Afghanistan because they say it’s safe.
@TIME So he had “fifteen minutes of fun” but didn’t have sex, but had outercourse with his clothes on but eventhough she was unconscious it was consensual yet he wasn’t trying to have sex because his clothes were on and at the same time nothing happened?
@chriscolton1980 @KristinaZanotti @ABC What law? You mean the decision to not grant them asylum?
@Dasher12231 @ABC It doesn’t matter you and I weren’t there. The fear has to be reasonable.
@Dasher12231 @ABC He didn’t run up to him to shove him unprovoked. The man was arguing with his partner at his car because he thought they didn’t deserve to park at a handicapped spot. If I did that and they pushed me off and knocked me to the ground for it I wouldn’t shoot them.
@chriscolton1980 @KristinaZanotti @ABC His family were all granted asylum and have residency because they came earlier than him but the afghan people coming now are being denied and deported.
@chriscolton1980 @KristinaZanotti @ABC They’re refusing to take young afghan men now because they say Afghanistan is safe.
@Dasher12231 @ABC Hence no reason to fear for his life. The consequences are for the police to decide if the man had called the police to report an assault. He does not have the right to shoot him for simply pushing him.
@Dasher12231 @ABC It doesn’t because his so called fear for his life isn’t reasonable here. All he got was shoved. There wasn’t any reason to think the man was going to kill him after pushing him off and even if he was afraid the man stepped back after he pulled out his gun.
@svtnyheter Bättre att förövaren betalar än samhället. Hur mycket pengar kostar inte redan förövare samhället för att inte tala om hur mycket de kostar deras offer om man nu ska tala pengar?
@Dasher12231 @ABC No you can not go around shooting every person that shoves you. Even when you’re assaulted you do not have the right to do whatever you want, especially not if you’re the aggressor, approaching someone else’s car arguing with them and standing in the way of their car.
@Dasher12231 @ABC Anger for shoving him perhaps, anger for taking a parking space he thinks the guy doesn’t have a right to. However from the deceased mans point of view he comes back out and sees a man approaching his car arguing with his partner. Does she have a stand your ground right?
@Dasher12231 @ABC The man standing up is taking a step back as the man on the ground pulls out his gun. The man on the ground still decides to shoots him in the chest, ultimately killing him. This is not self defense, it’s anger.
@Dasher12231 @ABC  https://t.co/9NkbJH38O7
@salgodfolife @ABC Was he?
@ABC I guess it’s ok to shoot and kill every person that shoves you now. Maybe women could use this law against every man or vice versa that approaches them to say slap their ass without permission and say they were afraid for their life. People get raped and murdered all the time.
@Dasher12231 @ABC It was not unprovoked and it was a shove.
@TweepOut @ABC I’m not going to Miami or Disney-world after this. I’m done with Florida until they change that law.

@culver931 @lynshackklet @matthew_wintle @Serenit97952855 @PaulMiller1313 @ABC I see, I guess I was just confused by you calling him a criminal.
@culver931 @lynshackklet @matthew_wintle @Serenit97952855 @PaulMiller1313 @ABC But it wasn’t him trying to delay the plane or stop his deportation so again how does that make him a criminal?
@JRod198036 @chriscolton1980 @ABC What?
@JRod198036 @chriscolton1980 @ABC Do I have to wash them and clean up after them too because they can’t do anything for themselves? They managed to flee and cross half way around the world all by themselves but you seem to think they’re completely helpless with nothing to offer society?
@JRod198036 @chriscolton1980 @ABC So you are against migration and asylum? Taxmoney pays for refugee camps and schools to learn Swedish, I say let them work before they get their residence and pay their own upkeep which I’m sure they wouldn’t mind but I’m fine with paying taxes that goes towards that.
@JRod198036 @chriscolton1980 @ABC No I’d rather they just get jobs like everyone else.
@lynshackklet @culver931 @matthew_wintle @Serenit97952855 @PaulMiller1313 @ABC Sigh...when did he break the law?
@chriscolton1980 @ABC So you have no reason or arguments for why young Afghan men should be denied asylum, you just don’t care because they’re Afghan?
@chriscolton1980 @ABC Yes London and Afghanistan are exactly the same.
@vannessarae1 @ABC ...able-bodied men who you assume don’t want to work?
@chriscolton1980 @ABC Yes they deem Afghanistan to be safe. Is it?
@culver931 @matthew_wintle @Serenit97952855 @PaulMiller1313 @ABC But how does that make him a “criminal”?
@NPR Finally I was waiting for that. Didn’t even know there was a lawsuit.
@MitzieH6 @BBCWorld In Afghanistan sure.
@guardian Social engineering to make your life seem interesting so you can be like, the most popular kid in school. Really healthy.
@TheDoorman666 @erinbliss @BBCWorld No they don’t think...just no but I can see why would want to stop now. Bye.
@TheDoorman666 @erinbliss @BBCWorld But did he enter the country illegally which is what you claimed, not that he is illegal because he’s being deported, or as an asylum seeker?
@erinbliss @TheDoorman666 @BBCWorld Could be any number of reasons but probably because sweden or the immigration handler thought Afghanistan is a safe country and therefore he doesn’t need asylum. Doesn’t necessarily make it so.
@TheDoorman666 @erinbliss @BBCWorld No that just mean he wasn’t granted asylum...
@Gary68445205 @jbmorgado @BBCWorld Lol. You keep telling yourself that. Of course you are different. You’re not like them. I mean after all you are you!
@TheDoorman666 @erinbliss @BBCWorld How do you know he is not an asylum seeker but an “illegal immigrant”?
@olofcoco1 @BBCWorld What has he done?
@silicon_valets @BBCWorld Regardless she was very brave, not grandstanding and although she doesn’t know his particular case she does have an informed opinion wether or not Afghanistan is safe and therefore wether we should be deporting refugees back there or denying their asylum claims.
@MitzieH6 @BBCWorld Or were he to attain legal residence he could just look for a job and work like everyone else...
@guardian Hopefully there will be an interview with her soon. From what I have recently read about how our government deport afghan men sometimes seemingly illegally I would like to know the full facts of this matter.
@Anthony55635408 @katmc68 @mbooton @guardian No it doesn’t have to be something bad. He just wasn’t awarded asylum.
@mbooton @guardian By that logic I can make any assumptions about you. You can’t just make stuff up.
@politico ...I do not think it means what you think it means...
@WLThornhill @Rakpenguin63 @BBCWorld As you said and I did too.
@WLThornhill @Rakpenguin63 @BBCWorld Ok so different details but the shoved guy basically shot and killed a man for shoving him.
@WLThornhill @Rakpenguin63 @BBCWorld Ow so it was the screaming guy who shot the man in the car, later as he got out, over parking because he pushed him for harassing his partner at the store. I must have read the article wrong cause it said the harassed person got shoved and then shot the man in “self defense”.
@BBCWorld I guess the “stand your ground” law now means kill anybody that angers you and claim self-defense. Other people in other countries have to control themselves.
@WLThornhill @Rakpenguin63 @BBCWorld But does he get to kill him for that? For approaching him, screaming at him and yes shoving him. I’m not saying it’s right but you don’t go killing every person that harasses you unless they’re actually trying to kill you. Then it’s self defense, otherwise it’s just provocation.
@ABC @GStephanopoulos I think he’s just stupid and influenced by Putin willingly. I don’t think Putin has something on Trump that Trump knows about or cares about.
@svtnyheter Det var samma debatt runt SD förra valet om man skulle tysta ner dem eller diskutera rasism och dem kom in i riksdagen. Människor som blir influerade av att se rasistiska organisationer demonstrera öppet på gator och torg har redan bestämt sig och dem når man inte genom tystnad.
@thehill This was an act of terrorism. What did the other side do?
@thehill There is video footage of James Alex Fields jr plowing his car in to a crowd of counter-protesters in what police call a deliberate attempt, killing Heather Heyer, so I think we can safely say it was never about protesting history being rewritten or white southern heritage.
@SenSanders I can create millions of jobs if I didn’t have to pay any employees so I can do even better than Disney’s CEO and then if my employees need money they can all go to the government and get payed in welfare from the taxpayers!

@BBCWorld 3rd one on the right blamed the victim “because it was late and she should have been at home doing dishes” and argued giving him the death penalty would only make it worse for rape victims because it would force rapist to kill so they don’t get caught. His mother cries for him.

@thehill Wow he’s finally stopped being confused and figured it out...
@RayDavi41500652 @FoxNews Right, asylum seekers trying to illegally cross after they were denied their right to seek asylum through a legal port of entry are the same as rapist, murderers and “MS 13 terrorist”. Illegal immigration is a problem but under the circumstances a misdeamor at best in it self.
@RayDavi41500652 @FoxNews Is that your term for immigrants?
@FoxNews “If he can retreat”. So does he have to try and run and then if they follow him he can stab them in the leg? Hard to prove intent but if it’s reasonable to believe they would follow him then he obviously couldn’t retreat. Florida stand your ground laws aren’t the answer.

@FoxNews Any surplus after the bill for the detention center and their own food and shelter along with any eventual cost for their children has been paid goes to them. That way they’re not stealing any jobs and there’s no profiteering from cheap labor plus an incentive to work hard.
@FoxNews I don’t see what’s wrong with detaining asylum seekers who turned themselves over to border patrol at a legal port of entry to seek asylum until their application is processed and determined. They can work to support the detention center, their upkeep and their children’s school.
@FoxNews Are they all illegal though or is it a blanket statement? Are you lumping all migrants like asylum seekers who sought asylum in a legal port of entry, together? They can’t help the fact that embassies and consulates don’t have the right to process asylum applications.

@Colony14 @Tpinkfloyd @TheDemocrats Just google it and read up on immigration laws. You don’t have to take my word for it. Embassies and consulates do not have the right to process asylum applications.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats You also can’t apply for citizenship on a regular visa. A visa is only a visa for what it’s intended for. If you need to run immediately you don’t have the time to apply for citizenship or possibly an immigration visa and wait.
@Colony14 @Tpinkfloyd @TheDemocrats Immigrants aren’t even eligible for welfare. America runs on illegal immigrants willing to work for less.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats For the record I think it’s a stupid system. It would be much easier if you could apply for asylum at a nearby embassy and consulate but maybe they are afraid too many people would apply for asylum if they made it too easy? You also can’t apply for asylum on a visa.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats Sigh, just google it and read up on the actual rules.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats Embassies and consulates do not have the right to process asylum applications.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats You can not seek asylum from a consulate or an embassy.
@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats It’s not on Mexico if they’re picked up while still in Mexico by U.S border patrol agents to be detained in America. Seeking asylum means your application must be proceeded which means temporary passage or detainment until your case is determined.
@RepJuanVargas @HispanicCaucus Why keep the children though? Doesn’t it cost more to keep the children then let their parents take responsibility for them?
@Colony14 @Tpinkfloyd @TheDemocrats Is America full? If America has received it’s maximum quota of refugees the correct thing to do is to deny them asylum maybe as a form of speedy process directly at the border, denying them the chance to apply indicate an obstruction of justice.
@Colony14 @Tpinkfloyd @TheDemocrats Correction, not embassies or consulates for asylum, just legal ports of entries.

@Tpinkfloyd @Colony14 @TheDemocrats Some are being turned away at the legal port of entry after stating they wish to seek asylum and sometimes they are detained and separated from their children before even crossing the border illegally.
@Sam86797703 @TheDemocrats But had she actually tried to cross trough it yet before she we picked up or was she just sitting on the Mexican side of the rio grande when the agent picked her up and crossed her over to detain her?
@Colony14 @TheDemocrats If Mexico is so safe why don’t you go there and see for yourself. Travel trough Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez and Mexico City. Shouldn’t be a problem if all that’s lacking is welfare benefits.
@FayHern20934525 @RealPaulWinters @CNN You mean trough a legal port of entry, can’t apply for asylum from an embassy, but many are turned away at the legal port of entry after they state they are seeking asylum.
@nowthisnews @HispanicCaucus @RepTedLieu He’s breaking the rules but “decorum” is a weak defense in face of what’s going on and a pathetic excuse from the people who approved of this policy.

@mprince1801 @TheDemocrats Is Mexico a safe country?
@Sam86797703 @TheDemocrats Well she was picked up by a border control agent on the rio grande. Doesn’t say wether she had actually crossed the American border yet before he picked her up.

@CNN Why are asylum seekers lumped together as illegal immigrants? Is “illegal” just a label? And why are their children taken? They didn’t break the law, they crossed the border seeking asylum. The US is free to deny them that and deport them but has no right to take their children.

@JimPaine18 @CNN Seeking asylum isn’t illegal!
@sueieque52 @CNN Seeking asylum isn’t illegal. You would understand that if for some reason you had to flee the country with your family one day.
@toweroftruth @CNN They still don’t give their kids back even if they do that and if she’s seeking asylum she probably doesn’t have that choice.
@RaidersHLP @ThatTrashThing @CNN So they deport her if they don’t think she has a case for asylum. She still didn’t break the law as seeking asylum isn’t illegal and doesn’t deserve to have her kid taken away nor does the kid deserve to be separated from her mother.
@CNN How do you seek asylum legally? If they were really crossing the border illegally then why aren’t they turned away at the border or arrested by border police?

@CBSNews The practice of separating children from their parents is hardly going to deter anyone seeking asylum if they and their family are facing death anyway. Yes they could be lying about their situation but do they want to question the children. Innocent until proven guilty.
@CBSNews How do you apply for asylum legally without crossing the border? The Un declared seeking asylum a human right. There are no legal ways to travel to seek asylum but you turn yourself over to the police and say you are applying for asylum and they can’t deport you for that process.

@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA Not all states require licenses and permits.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA George Zimmerman committed a crime when he stalked, shot and killed Trayvon Martin and he’s out and loose threatening Jay Z via twitter.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA Just to be clear I’m not attacking gun owners. I just believe there should be more regulation.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA How do you know they are normal people? Or that they are trained? There is no such requirement to buying a gun.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA Expect in this case the black female student was sleeping so what good would a gun have done her? The caller however could have shot her in her sleep if she had a gun, especially if she felt motivated by the fear of knowing the other woman might shoot back.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA I mean what if that woman who called the cops on her black fellow female student napping in the common room and prior to that the black students friend, a male black student, telling him he doesn’t belong there, had a gun? I’m talking about these kinds of biased confrontations.
@mikethe615 @NRA Not so safe, especially when dealing with untrained people, hence “public shootouts”. And by suggesting as a police officer the police can’t always get there in time, she is essentially telling people they should arm themselves albeit to protect themselves but nonetheless.
@mikethe615 @NRA She is defending the right to guns because the police can’t always get there in time which is fair but also means people will use their guns to defend themselves during a crime (also fair) or at a perceived threat (a problem), the criminal will shoot back, inside or outside.
@Keith_NRA4LIFE @NRA So what happens when said assholes have a gun in their hands instead of being armed with just a phone? How would those confrontations end?

@its_me_again93 @FoxNews @DLoesch Or buying a gun from a friend which is legal for some reason?
@its_me_again93 @FoxNews @DLoesch The NRA is a very powerful lobby organization, they donate a lot of money to politicians. Am I or am I not correct in my understanding that in most states you don’t need a permit or a license to buy a gun, they just run a background check on you if you’re not at a gunshow.
@its_me_again93 @FoxNews @DLoesch I never said anything about gun makers nor were the money of the NRA comes from.
@its_me_again93 @FoxNews @DLoesch I don’t understand what you mean by “I am the NRA” but whatever. The NRA are the reason your politicians can’t vote on more sensible gun laws meanwhile these mass school shootings keep happening. Why defund planned parenthood?
@FoxNews @its_me_again93 @DLoesch How about the NRA fund school security, take some responsibility.
@Azurielfloof @NRA Ok, well if you believe that then surely you’re for having some restrictions on guns with more common sense laws.
@its_me_again93 @NRA What was confusing?
@NRA A police officer telling the public to arm themselves so they can engage in public shootouts because the police can’t get to you in time. More guns for the people calling the police on black people and more guns on those black people for when the police come.

Had the situation been the other way around and the black student called the cops on the white student for napping in the common room area just because she assumes that person doesn’t belong there or felt “uncomfortable” it would have been equally wrong.
@BBCWorld (5) Also there’s another article that states the student callers first complaint about the common room not being for sleeping, suggesting she knew the student, before calling the cops and then it isn’t clear what she called the cops for precisely or what she tells them, only that
@EyeDubya1001 @1LogicalMan @BBCWorld Her experience is irrelevant to be clear.
@AmandaJoyceHall @Yale But why is this a Yale problem and not a student-who-called-the-police-on-you problem? The police handled it all wrong. They have to respond to all calls (?) but they acted defensive and told you, you weren’t being harassed which didn’t give you a chance to make a complaint.
@EyeDubya1001 @1LogicalMan @BBCWorld Are the black people calling the police on the white police officers? Are the white officers being interrogated by police officers because black people called the police on the white police officers?
@BBCWorld (4) job. So if the student caller decided to do this again and started calling the police on her every week would it be considered harassment then? By telling her she is “not being harassed” he is not giving her a chance to make a complaint with them against the student caller.

@EyeDubya1001 @1LogicalMan @BBCWorld What? What are you talking about?
@BBCWorld This problem would go away if people who did this had to pay a fine every time they do this.
@BBCWorld I understand police have to respond after a call has been made but once they established the person in question was a student there they should have asked the ID of the caller and why she made the call esp if they’re from the same dormitory and she should have seen her before.
@1LogicalMan @BBCWorld Really that’s what you got from this story. Aren’t you at least a little outraged that people like this student who called the police on a sleeping student are waisting police resources? The police are far to busy for this crap.
