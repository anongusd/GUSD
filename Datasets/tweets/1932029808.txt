@realDonaldTrump Trump promotes literacy of a book he has never read. 	Yes, more people should read what is actually in the bible, they would be horrified.	But, we do have separation of church &amp; state in this country.	If they want this, how about other religions too? Like, the Satanic Bible?
@realDonaldTrump Trump is the worst president in US history, he is the face of modern republican corruption. All republicans need to be voted out of office and trump needs to be arrested.

@sbdad8 @NBCNews @NBCOUT You say this without any evidence. You are the one stuck in a right-wing bubble.
@sbdad8 @NBCNews @NBCOUT Back then, democrats were the conservatives, now the republicans are. Try again. I bet not a single klan member, neo-nazi or white nationalist voted democrat.
@sbdad8 @NBCNews @NBCOUT Stop calling yourself a christian. 	Republicans are not humanitarians or charitable. 	Republicans represent the worst in humanity. Greed and self-righteousness. 	Fake christians abusing religion for personal gains. Republican scare-tactics only work on the blind followers.
@AriMelber For what? To give the lying liars a national platform to lie some more?	MSNBC didn't air Huckabee lies, why give the other criminals air time?
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Trump has militarized ICE &amp; the border patrol, now they are abusing their power on trumps command. This is what happens when you demonize a group of people.
@NBCNews The Trump era?
@NBCNews Even trumps Christmas tree is trolling America with that russia themed decorated tree.
@CNNPolitics No. End of story.
@NBCPolitics Translation: Trump does NOT care about the troops.
@TruckingAcross @CNN Sure, insult instead of addressing the issue. 	If all you have is name calling, then you lost the argument. 	Done.
@MSNBC @NBCNews It is very obvious, that is all a lie.
@NBCPolitics Translation: Trump admits his guilt.
@TruckingAcross @CNN Blah, blah, blah...term limits...blah, blah, blah. You want to put a band-aid on a much bigger problem.
@NBCNews Perjury is a punishable offense. 	Should be enough to warrant impeachment.  	2019 is not going to be a very good year for Trump.
@TruckingAcross @CNN Same way Mitch McConnell is a millionaire.
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Who told you that? 	Where do you get your info from?
@jaketapper @LiberalUSA1 It's almost like trump wants to go to prison. 	Or...	Maybe, trump thinks if he can use SCOTUS to get out of criminal charges. 	Then can run for a third-term, by manipulating the courts.
@thedailybeast @rackupsoon2 Add this to trumps list of things that make him look guilty. 	This will not end well for him.
@TruckingAcross @CNN The twitter equivalent to "I know you are but what am I?" lol	Too funny.
@TruckingAcross @CNN Ad hominems? Laughable. I wouldn't expect anything less from someone who breathes toxic fumes for a living.
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion With the right light, yes you can.
@AdHominoid @MSNBC You call fake outrage with fake outrage? Really? Trump logic. Claim everyone else is doing the thing you are doing. Using bad logic as propaganda? Pathetic.
@TruckingAcross @CNN The worst thing about the republicans: they have to be against everything the democrats do, even if they want it too. Sad.
@CNN And if you do not like the truth, too bad. Facts and evidence do not care about your uneducated opinion.
@TruckingAcross @CNN One doesn't have to do with the other. Bad logic.
@AdHominoid @MSNBC Republican logic = Whataboutism, bothsiderism, &amp; straight up lying. 	Refugees have the legal right to request asylum and due process. 	Children are not supposed to be in concentration camps, families belong together.	Trump has militarized ICE &amp; the border patrol.
@CNNPolitics Obstruction of justice, grounds for impeachment. 	This criminal enterprise needs to be brought to justice.
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion No. Wrong. 200 years of since the industrial revolution, all that black smoke we put in the atmosphere went somewhere. Car exhaust doesn't vanish into the void, it all goes somewhere.
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Only when I get into twitter arguments with random, anonymous people on the internet. Conversations with uneducated people literally lower my IQ. Insult matches and partisan "discussions" that go nowhere do not benefit anyone.
@topspin1617 @foxfie_ca @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion The Vice news documentary is really compelling. All that black residue on the ice didn't magically appear there.
@MSNBC How much is this going to cost us? 	Are they authorized to use lethal force?	When are the lawyers going to drag the trump administration into court?	Where is congress in all of this? 	Is anyone going to be held accountable?
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion The fact you don't understand my comment proves my point.
@CNN Job 1: Get money out of politics.
@PalmerReport Yes. The End.
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion @NPR @vicenews @AJENews @AP No. It is you who thinks everyone is a lying to you, sign of a paranoid mind. 	I bet you believe everything trump says, don't you?
@CRPolitical @topspin1617 @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion You are just lying to yourself, scratch that, you let opinionated talking-heads or trump himself trick you into believing everything is a lie. Must be terrible for you running around thinking this way. Sad.
@topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion People like this never have a good answer to "where do you get your information from?"
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion @NPR , @vicenews , ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, @AJENews , @AP
@CRPolitical @topspin1617 @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion More bothsiderism. Lazy politics. A hallmark of the uneducated.
@CRPolitical @topspin1617 @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Read the fine print: "Dean Burnett doesn‚Äôt actually agree with any of the claims in this piece, but don‚Äôt let that stop you commenting or shouting at him on Twitter"
@topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Right!
@CRPolitical @topspin1617 @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Do YOU consider @vicenews a real news source?
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion That is not a real news source. Try again.
@foxfie_ca @topspin1617 @CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Anarchist and nihilists have no valid opinion worth considering. 	They sit at the kids table.
@CRPolitical @topspin1617 @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion I bet a thousand dollars you will not cite 3 of those "sources". 	I guarantee they are right-wing, non-scientific sources.
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion Okay, Breitbart, VOA &amp; the Daily Caller are nothing but right-wing leaning opinion propaganda. And I call bs on you NOT watching Fox news, Sean Hannity is on Fox.
@CNN She doesn't count, she's not even human. 	Another republican monster pretending to be a christian.
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion No one gets rich on climate science, that is the real myth. 	I bet everything you know about climate comes from Fox news and Infowars. 	Having a "difference of opinion" doesn't make you educated or smart. 	Smart people know when to admit they don't know.
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion No, it is not a simply answer. You conservative want to boil everything down to an over-simplified answer. Sorry to be the one to tell you, life is more complicated than you think it is. I am not a scientist, I couldn't explain it properly. Not my job to translate to redneck.
@CRPolitical @CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion You have heard of a thing called "Google", right? 	I'm not the idiot whisperer. 	Doesn't take much to educate yourself, and alt-right media doesn't count.
@CNN @profadamsobel @CNNOpinion You will never convince republicans otherwise, they are to far gone to believe any truth.
@joncoopertweets Yes. Trump supporters are not good people.
@nprpolitics This is trump actively working against the will of the American people.	Trump is a criminal and an unconstitutional president.
@NBCNews More taxpayer money being wasted on a war against refugees that no one asked for.	Trumps criminal administration needs to held accountable.
@cspan Does anyone actually believe him?	I do not. Trump is covering up his involvement in this crime.	This criminal enterprise needs to come to an end. 	Hopefully, Democrats can restore some sanity to our government in January.
@CNNPolitics Ivanka is clueless and complicit in her fathers crimes. 	She isn't fooling anyone.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You mean the rapists and pedophiles that are pimping out the refugee children you have locked up? No one cares about what they think.
@dbongino @realDonaldTrump Fake. Maliciously edited. All you see it what you want to see. Traitors.
@realDonaldTrump Too bad trump university never taught you this kind of stuff. 	You are obviously clueless how any of this works. 	Worst. President. Ever!
@realDonaldTrump One company hiring 600 people isn't going to change much when Ford And GM are laying off thousands of employees. This will not make you look good, no matter how hard you try. You failed as a president.
@realDonaldTrump TRUMP IS FAKE NEWS!!!
@HillReporter @Vernielu Fox is state-run television. 	A dictator in the making.
@ProudResister Clean coal.	Alternative facts.	Now, safe tear gas?	What's next? Friendly bullets? Peaceful guns? 	A good dictator?
@NBCNews Trump can't handle the truth.
@essenviews Republicans love to victim blame whether it be sexual assault, refugees, or murdered journalists, republicans are increasingly becoming authoritarian.
@samstein @maxwelltani Fox news is just another branch of government in the trump administration.
@nowthisnews @KenThomasRoss Ohio wants the "Worst State in America" award.
@ABCWorldNews @ABC @DavidMuir Lock him up!
@thedailybeast No one in the trump administration used facts or evidence. They lie, cheat &amp; steal. 	Someone needs to hold them all accountable, obviously republicans won't do it.
@CNNPolitics 60% disapproval is still too low. No one should be happy with what Trump has done with our government. He acts like a dictator and only enriches himself.
@AP_Politics I don't think it really matters what Trump thinks, no one takes him seriously and expects him to stand trial for violating the constitution. Trump has done nothing to help the economy or our environment, no one expects much from him. Lame duck president for two years.
@realDonaldTrump See, and you thought we were joking about trump wanting to be a dictator. But, no, you didn't listen. If this is taxpayer funded, I vote no. 	You'll never get the funding to do this, not with Democrats in charge of the House.
@RawStory Authoritarianism 101.	We were not joking when we said trump wants to be a dictator.	Installing Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, trumps thinks he will be able to overturn the election results for 2020.
@mjfree @GM Here in Michigan, I was surfing the #BlueWave with Whitmer and legalizing marijuana. Ironically, most of the MAGA in Michigan are factory workers and farmers.
@RawStory Funny, I do not remember President Obama throwing tear gas at refugees legally seeking asylum or detaining them permanently.
@ABCWorldNews Is this the winning trump was talking about?
@krassenstein Does trump need to write "I am dictator" across his forehead for people to wake up?	Or is it, his cult followers want a "strong leader" to take control?	Apparently, some people like dictators. 	I am not one of those people.
@4YrsToday Trump propaganda channel? Sad.
@RawStory Most American Christians are not very Christ-like. All they do is cherry-pick the bible for the parts they like, ignore the rest.
@thedailybeast We don't believe a word trump says either, so I guess it's a stalemate.
@AP_Politics Trump only hears what he wants to hear. He has already done a lot of damage to our economy, he only cares about enriching himself, not helping everyone else.
@ABCWorldNews President Treason once again oblivious to the reality on the ground, while lying to the American people. Trumps justifies caging small children and family separations, if he had it his way, there would be more violence.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like trump is getting scared. Every time trump points the finger at other people that's when you know he is guilty.
@realDonaldTrump It's really obvious trump is guilty. 	Keep on tweeting, traitor, everything you tweet can and will be used against you in a court of law.
@politvidchannel Trump lies because his cult followers will believe him. 	He lies to convince himself. 	He lies because he has no accountability.
@realDonaldTrump T is for treason.
@MarkBrewerDems @VotePulver @MIGOP Maybe now we can fix the roads, lower car insurance, and have clean water. 	Democrats would be wise to rush the commercialization of recreational marijuana, the money generated will benefit us all.

@RawStory Add this to the list of  trumps crimes against humanity.	The unchecked and unconstitutional president strikes again.
@realDonaldTrump This tweet is a distraction from the trump administration tear-gassing women &amp; children at the border. Refugees exercising their rights to asylum are being treated inhumanely and unconstitutionally.	#resist

@RawStory Trump reaps what he sows.
@dennisupdike @NBCNews Self-enrichment doesn't count as working either.
@dennisupdike @NBCNews Technically, he doesn't work at all. He makes all his cronies do the work and just parrots what they tell him to say. He basically admitted in the Fox interview he doesn't think when he makes decisions.
@NBCNews 57% of the time trump isn't doing his job. 	Probably higher since he doesn't much	even when he is in the White House.

@chuckl567 @NBCNews That makes no damn sense.
@ItzZeroDaHero @NBCNews There was a time before trump when republicans just had a difference of opinion, not militant right-wingers. Inciting violence is not part of free speech.
@PattyOLimerick Oppositional is not a word. What are you talking about?
@realDonaldTrump You do nothing but demonize the Democrats and now you expect them to be bipartisan? You've lost your mind. America has bigger problems than border security, you would know this if you did your job.

@ChuckGrassley Stay in your lane, Chuck. Obama never attack our justice system like trump. Your partisanship puts America in danger of foreign influence, but i'm sure you already knew that.
@realDonaldTrump "Border safety" is dog-whistle politics. We get it, you don't like POC, stop using government resources for your racist agenda. Having trump as president makes America less safe. Not impeaching him is unwise.
@HuffPost Well, no one said he was an inspirational president, unless you're a white national.
@realDonaldTrump Once again, trump tries to undermine our justice system. 	No, trump, judges are not going to uphold your unconstitutional policies. 	We are a country of laws, but criminals like you don't follow the rule of law.

@realDonaldTrump Once again, republican logic trumps reality. Weather and climate are two different things. Climate change creates extreme weather, cold and heat. It is chaos in our ecosystem, just like trump in global affairs.

@realDonaldTrump A "business man" from NYC, a reality show celebrity is going to analyze military tactics and strategy? Once again, you are NOT the smartest person in the room, you have no military experience, You are not as tough as you think you are.

@BionicLatino @NateSilver538 @Lawrence Intentionally or not. That is all these numbers do. They are part of an antiquated system. Landlines are dinosaurs, and how they collect data is flawed. They do not count for the unknown and the unknowable.

@realDonaldTrump Women &amp; children, some of them I bet are Christians. Innocent people desperate to escape gang violence and political corruption, being met by a corrupt and morally bankrupt politician.
@DavidCornDC Republicans pretending to be christian playing dictator.
@AP_Politics Not very christian, nope, not very christian at all.
@TeaPainUSA Trump is doing his part to get Democrats elected.
@voxdotcom A coded message to his cult followers to continue the violence.
@RawStory Fox news is a joke. The real fake news.
@MLivePolitics Mike Pence "Mr. Conversion therapy" is wrong, about many things. Unless there is ballot tampering, he doesn't understand the democrats enthusiasm right now, we are ready to vote!
@CNN Both-siderism: the idea that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù are at fault absolves them of their responsibility for participating in politics.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, it is called @FoxNews

@JennLam2099 @NBCNews You're fooling your self.
@MLivePolitics 1. Both-siderism: the idea that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù are at fault absolves them of their responsibility for participating in politics.	2. Yes. Dehumanizing any group of people incites violence.
@voxdotcom Deplorable's sent bombs intended to kill political opponents. 	Deplorable's shot up a church because the president dehumanized refugees. 	Sleeping giant? You're over-estimating their population size.
@NBCNews Thanks in part by trumps hateful rhetoric. Words can have consequences.
@RawStory No, the shooter did. Don't "blame" CNN. Check the guys social media posts, he said it himself.

@DeplorableNew @FoxNews She did win (the popular vote), by a lot. Only reason trump won was by cheating.

@sheila_mintz @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Name one thing they have said that promote violence. You can't, because they do not. Only in the minds of people who are attached to their political ideology. If you read that in Breitbart or any other right-wing media, it is a lie.

@sheila_mintz @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Only in the pages of alt-right websites of Alternative facts. I am a liberal, and I promise you, no one that is taken seriously is promoting violence from the left. If anything, they want to be more like hippies (peace, love, &amp; happiness).

@PaulCat711 @FoxNews And...here come the programmed snowflakes...lol
@StephenMCarter4 @AP Everyone is cashing out. They made more money, at the expense of others.
@AP Absolutely meaningless. All this means is the rich keep getting richer. While we pay higher prices on everything.
@ReutersPolitics Russia has been proven to have attacked our elections and they get an invite to the W.H.? This is more collusion done in public, congress is weak and feckless.
@FoxNews Traitors doing traitorous things. More collusion out in the open, without any repercussions or consequences.
@FoxNews @michellemalkin Walls don't work, there are these things called tunnels, maybe you've heard of them. 	More border patrol agents won't help, most of them are unlawfully killing innocent people. Just accept them and acclimate them to American life. All should be welcome.
@FoxNews City officials cannot use their position to advocate any politician. 	And...awwww poor white people getting a taste of discrimination. Too bad, so sad.
@NBCNews This is reminds me of Israel and Gaza. Trump won't complain when soldiers start shooting people.
@RawStory Covert? That was covert? Kind of obvious, if you're not a partisan hack or high on pills.
@FoxNews How about you spend sometime in prison first. Traitor.
@FoxNews Why would there be a man-hunt if the bombs were fake? 	You cannot have it both ways Fox news.
@FoxNews They don't have a home to go back to. The "loophole" is the Geneva Convention and the United States constitution. Republicans are no humanitarians and have low moral standards.
@AP_Politics @debriechmann @AP He only wants to lower drug prices on opioids, keep his supporters sedated enough to believe everything he says.
@FoxNews In other words, "I got caught and I am going to whine about on tv".
@ReutersPolitics Cheat to win, the republican way.

@FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst If only republicans would pay attention, instead of playing politics.
@FoxNews Trying for the insanity defense. Only a moron would believe this crap.
@realDonaldTrump Funny how a low rated president thinks he is respected or even liked. 	Your hate and ignorance has inspired white nationalists to be violent. 	If your political party attracts nazis's and white supremacists, you are the bad guy.
@FoxNews @SecNielsen BS! You have every intention of shooting people. It is obvious.
@FoxNews @SecNielsen You also have to follow the laws of the land. You are merely an employee of the government, not the government itself. You work for us, not the president.

If YOU do not understand why people protest, then its time Republicans take a long look in the mirror. People are not upset just because of the "red team". The actions taken by R's is literally destroying America.
@LindseyGrahamSC This is not a "win". Kavanaugh isn't out of the woods yet. He can still be impeached.
@Supreamscream @CoryBooker You mean fighting womens right, the constitution and our basic human rights? Yeah, why would anyone fight so hard for those things? Give it a rest, republicans are criminals hiring their own judge. I would never side with a Republican, they are traitors.
@marcorubio That would never happen, Democrats aren't colluding with Russia to rigged the elections like Republicans are.

@stepkelch @CNN Once again, Republican logic clouds peoples brains. It's not about picking sides. That is the problem with republicans, always thinking in terms of absolutes.
@timothyrbrewer @CNNPolitics The Republican agenda is not the same as the Democrats, not by a long-shot. It's not an extremist position to stand your ground on moral issues. People can be religious all they want, just keep it out of politics. Separation of church &amp; state.

@thedailybeast Proof that Republicans govern with the bible. They are trying to make America a Christian state. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!
@MichiganRadio Cannabis: Marijuana is a derogatory remark towards Mexicans. Michigan government has been gerrymandered to favor republican politicians. Conservatives govern with the bible, and Christians do not believe in free will.
@stephen_gethin @benberzai @TheAtlantic @AdamSerwer That would be religion, belief in some magical powers that doesn't exist. We will not be governed by the bible, the most violent book ever written. People use religion to justify racism, homophobia, isolationism, and genocide.
@destinloan @FOX4 The word Marijuana comes from the late 1800's, when people believed Mexicans went crazy when they smoked cannabis. Somehow the word stuck around.

@SouthernSnow21 @USATODAY Wanting to the whole truth to be made public is not crazy. Why do republicans want to cover up the truth? I am not Antifa, but am against fascism, which is something conservatives want. When the kkk and neo-nazis are on your side, you do not have the moral high ground.
@kampegaardjesse @palmm_p @USATODAY The vocabulary of a fifth grader, and mentality of a second grader. If all you have is baseless insults, then you have lost the argument. This is why people hate trump, he emboldens anti-productive inclinations from the worst among us.

@_AlexanderHammy @aintwesomething @NBCNews @infowars After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates ‚Äî including possible connections with Russia.
@_AlexanderHammy @aintwesomething @NBCNews @infowars The Free Beacon ‚Äî which was funded by a major donor supporting Mr. Trump‚Äôs rival for the party‚Äôs nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida ‚Äî told Fusion GPS to stop doing research on Mr. Trump in May 2016
@_AlexanderHammy @aintwesomething @NBCNews @infowars During the Republican primaries, a research firm called Fusion GPS was hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, to unearth potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump.
@_AlexanderHammy @aintwesomething @NBCNews @infowars It's not a theory. There is hard evidence, and many people have already pled guilty. But, I know, you don't care about that.

@smokntoes Oh yes, try to blame the education system, weak argument. Considering people like you want the bible taught in schools.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Revisionist history to justify racist tendencies of current conservatives. One name: David Duke.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Anti-fascism? Yes, because Republicans are pro-fascism. This is America, not Russia.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics These are the facts republicans just cannot understand. https://t.co/faZxyr2XUQ
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Democrats before the civil rights era were the conservatives, and republicans were the liberals, learn American history.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Liberals are the modern day hippies, but yeah, we're so violent.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Sad part about republicans, they won't admit the KKK and neo-nazis are on your side, that should tell you something. And it was a conservative who ran people down at the Unite the Right rally.
@CNNPolitics Trump has no interest in uniting our country, division is good for his bank account.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics "Love one another as I have loved you." Something republicans do not do, hence, fake christians.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Just stop calling yourself a christian, you are not a good representation.

@smokntoes @CNNPolitics You have no right to talk about communists, when republicans are actively thanking Russia for interfering in the 2016 elections. Fake patriots too. I know what the 2a says and christians misinterpret it. "Judge not lest thee be judged." sound familiar?
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Baring false witness is a sin too, ya know. You really are a fake christian. I know more about the bible than you could possibly imagine, like how many times its been transcribed over the centuries. But, yeah, go read.
@NBCNews This is what happens when people vote republican, a government without morality.
@smokntoes @CNNPolitics Lets just say, you're not going to heaven for the "values" you hold. The things you said about McCain, Jesus won't like that. Plus, pro-gun NRA is not very christian either. You really need to go read the bible.
