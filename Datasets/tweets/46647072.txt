The #StarSpangledBanner was an Armistead family keepsake for 90 years after the War of 1812. #FlagDay http://t.co/0UAJQwUmxA
The red “V” on the #StarSpangled Banner is thought to be an “A” sewn by Louisa Armistead, widow of  the commander of Ft. McHenry. #FlagDay
Each of the 23-inch-wide stripes on the #StarSpangledBanner were made up of 2 smaller strips sewn together. #FlagDay http://t.co/TaNHR7wSwR
The #StarSpangledBanner's stars are made of cotton and each measures approximately 2 feet across. #FlagDay http://t.co/TALw8i5qEf
Original #StarSpangledBanner was 30x42’. It now measures 30x34’ &amp; a star is missing(due to souvenir seekers) #FlagDay http://t.co/vKz2umURMZ
The #StarSpangledBanner's 15 stripes represent the 13 original states and the next 2 states to join the union– KY &amp; VT. #FlagDay
The #StarSpangledBanner's blue canton is wool dyed w/ indigo while the red stripes are wool dyed by the roots of the madder plant. #FlagDay
Pickersgill and her assistants spent approximately seven weeks making the #StarSpangledBanner &amp; smaller storm flag. #FlagDay
Pickersgill's mother, daughter, nieces, indentured servant, and slave are believed to have helped  make the #StarSpangledBanner. #FlagDay
In 1813, Mary Pickersgill made 2 flags for Fort McHenry – the 30x42’ #StarSpangled Banner and a smaller 17x25 storm flag. #FlagDay
In honor of #FlagDay, we will share #StarSpangledBanner flag facts today. Also- lots of great events happening today! http://t.co/BfvvlZ3CYB
