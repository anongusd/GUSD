@MEPFuller Oh sorry, no I meant he denied the offer was made. Not the meeting. 		The meeting definitely happened.
@MEPFuller Because if you remember, Pelosi opponents raised this issue after the 2016 election. 		And instead of expending political capital on the issue then -- which is strongly opposed by CBC and CHC -- she did lots of other things to try to placate restless members
@MEPFuller Pelosi's spox denies that ever happened. 		But even the fact that this is being talked about -- and Pelosi is in the mix -- shows what a shift the caucus has undergone since the election
Pelosi's spox says she's "sympathetic" to the effort. 		Meanwhile, Rep. Perlmutter, one of the "rebels" told his colleagues Pelosi offered the term limits proposal during a meeting in her office yesterday (Hi @MEPFuller, who reported that bit first)

‚ÄúA number of us as women of color are saying there needs to be a leadership role created for Barbara Lee," Rep. Jayapal told me yesterday of their plan to ask Pelosi.
Lee's loss in the caucus chair race caused a lot of heartburn for women of color earlier this week. So this move by Pelosi will be much welcomed.
‚ÄúAs a leading African American woman with a place at the decision table, the appointment of Congresswoman Lee is even more meaningful as we mark the birthday of her friend: the trailblazing Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm," Pelosi says.
The move to elevate Lee to Steering co-chair comes as a group of House Dems were preparing to ask Pelosi to create a new job for Lee in their leadership ranks
Pelosi will be expanding leadership of the Steering and Policy Committee (the panel the hands out committee assignment for Dems) from two co-chairs to three

-Rep. Jeffries was elected caucus chair earlier in the day		- Several races still to be decided: DCCC Chair, Caucus Vice Chair and DPCC Chairs (some may not happen until tomorrow)
JUST TO UPDATE:		- Pelosi secures speaker nom		- Hoyer elected Majority Leader, Clyburn Majority Whip 		- Caucus now considering Assistant Dem Leader post (Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, current DCCC chair, running unopposed)
@seungminkim @lbarronlopez @NancyPelosi I thought of you!
Pelosi told the caucus she thought she was going to get 170 votes. 		Her allies see this as big win
@lbarronlopez @NancyPelosi Officially, yes! Was driving me bananas some outlets alerting the nomination before the vote was even tallied!
The question now is how many of these opposition votes are firm "no"s on the House floor come Jan. 3.
Pelosi OFFICIALLY clinches speaker nom with 203 yes votes, 32 no
Pelosi dismissing questions about Rice's statement during press conference outside the room where votes are still being tallied for her nomination
"We remain united behind our goal of new leadership and intend to vote against Leader Pelosi in Caucus and on the Floor of the House,‚Äù said Rep. Rice.
STATEMENT From Rice on Pelosi meeting: "Moments ago we met with Leader Pelosi and tried to engage her in a reasonable conversation about leadership transition. Unfortunately, our concerns were dismissed outright." 1/2
The caucus is now starting the speaker vote -- Pelosi running unopposed but several members expected to vote against
AND NOW Problem Solvers announces "major rules reform" agreement with Pelosi
All three were mum as they left. Rice wouldn‚Äôt say how she plans to vote in caucus or if they offered/took a deal. 		‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve made my position very clear,‚Äù she said.

Moving on to caucus chair vote also means Dems have avoided a nasty fight over changing caucus rules, at least for now (could come back up later today)
Caucus is now considering chairman election ‚Äî Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Kildee l, DWS, Vargas and Velazquez nominates Jeffries. 		Rep. Barbara Lee backers up next
Rep. Joe Kennedy will officially nominate Pelosi to be speaker 		Then eight Democrats will second the nomination, including three incoming freshmen: Escobar, Hill and Craig
‚ÄúThis race probably provides the clearest fork in the road as it relates to whether generational change is viewed as a priority or seniority and experience within the institution is more decisive," Jeffries told me.
Lee is pitching herself as a history maker ‚Äî she‚Äôd be the first African-American woman elected in the top tier of leadership		Jeffries says this race is about generational change &amp; fresh perspective in a caucus that has had same leaders for 12+ years
While top three are running unopposed, there are several contested races down ballot including caucus chair		Rep. Barbara Lee, 72, a progressive stalwart who has been in Congress for two decades vs. Hakeem Jeffries, 48, an up-and-comer who helped lead Dems msging this cycle
The new ballot allows members to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on Pelosi as opposed to having to write in another candidate. 		Pelosi allies are hoping this satisfies freshmen who called for new leadership during the campaign
Hi, hello üëãüèº. House Dems meet this morning to pick their leaders. 		Pelosi will easily clinch speaker nom. But she‚Äôs modified the internal ballot to make it easier for freshmen to vote against her. 		The latest w/ @rachaelmbade @BresPolitico 		https://t.co/Z1aJxMD4Zp

6. And even if they do get someone to run ‚Äî that is a huge IF ‚Äî can that person get enough freshmen on board when Pelosi can promise new members perks like committee assignments etc? https://t.co/exOpn1i0i5
5. On the flip side of the coin, that‚Äôs why you have a group of current members quietly trying to organize behind a Pelosi alternative right now. 		It‚Äôs hard ‚Äî Crowley was their guy; Pelosi is Queen; Does anyone even have the infrastructure to take her on? https://t.co/UflEi5q7Iy
@alivitali I looked at the list, I think it‚Äôs great you guys put all of this in one place and reached out to folks who hadn‚Äôt been asked yet. 		I think many of the 50 are squishy too though.
4. So then we get to the caucus vote vs floor vote split. 		If no one credible has challenged Pelosi in caucus, are all of these candidates really going to vote against her on the floor, her allies say? https://t.co/kBS5eQCrQX
3.
