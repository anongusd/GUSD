@WanemacherAdam @MaryPatFlynn1 @DrDenaGrayson @MelissaJPeltier @realDonaldTrump Heil, Drumpfler!
@WanemacherAdam @MaryPatFlynn1 @DrDenaGrayson @MelissaJPeltier @realDonaldTrump It was the Nazis who took on the resistance!
@louisrosasguyon @MJimenez3000 @real_defender @realDonaldTrump DARES, not DATES, but, then again, @realDonaldTrump wants to date and mate with @IvankaTrump! So, maybe you’re on to something!
@CKent4523 @davey7163 @Phyllisannefox @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I despise Trump, but you’re wrong!
@Phyllisannefox @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I despise Trump, but that’s not how it works, Sparky!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump JUSTICE FOR CANADIANS AND MEXICANS — ALL AMERICANS!
@chirodale1 @TheStevenThomas @realDonaldTrump It doesn’t work that way!
@MaryPatFlynn1 @DrDenaGrayson @MelissaJPeltier @realDonaldTrump The low resolution makes this impossible to read! Please post a link!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I AGREE! INDICT THE CRIMINAL @POTUS @RealDonaldtRUMP!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump No, WE don’t!
@realDonaldTrump Indeed! Explain the wall not being up instantly when you became President, your incestuous pedophilial relationship with @IvankaTrump, six bankruptcies, claiming you own Trump Winery when their Web site says you don’t, your clothing line made in foreign nations and your taxes! https://t.co/f0E5xa7vdA
@ScottMcBuckets @j_stevens1985 @KamalaHarris Your research would reveal the USPS is lowest on the list of those shipping illegal immigrants across the border!
@KamalaHarris Well, then — @RealDonaldtRump is worse than a chump wanting a baby bump in @IvankaTrump via an @POTUS jump and jump of her rump, but the TRUE EMERGENCY is the announcement by @KamalaHarris that, though Constitutionally ineligible to serve as POTUS or @VPOTUS, plans a coup d’etat! https://t.co/1ypD8M0LIe
@B52Malmet Maybe they deserve it!
@realDonaldTrump Isn’t it nice to want? We want you impeached and we’re all waiting for satisfaction! https://t.co/W6h3L9jSUP
@Amy_Siskind Because he’s not aDemocrat, like Trump ...!
@EricTrump TEAM CHUMP HUMP RUMP BUMP, not FAMILY TRUMP! https://t.co/7fRqxbc0ve
@staceyabrams If she does say so herself!
@realDonaldTrump #SOTU⁠ ⁠ ⁠ BORING
@mjoll @LandofOzVicki @VeniceRiley @KamalaHarris What’s your position on “abortion rights,” then?
@realDonaldTrump Your mis-administration must end!
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump It’s shaped like North America and Central America! https://t.co/QWdaGC1hnL
@realDonaldTrump • 199 Criminal Charges	• 37 People/Entities  Charged	• 6 Trump Associates	• 7 People who have plead Guilty	• 4 People Sentenced to Prison	• 1 Convicted by a Jury
@realDonaldTrump Right! Indeed! End your WITCH HUNT of those who are investigating your criminal conduct!
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump No, America does not love the tRumps, since the tRumps are the ones who create #FakeNews!
@realDonaldTrump Yes, your son is a sad, pathetic chip off the old liar!
@dlewicki @realDonaldTrump @MarbleChurch Trump is a chump, but why are you trashing him?
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Trump is a chump, but, then, leave him alone! https://t.co/utN1hiyx38
@IngrahamAngle @FBI @CNN Your what hurts? Oh, your butt hurts!
@KamalaHarris @POTUS @RealDonaldtRump is a pig, but you’re still not eligible to be President for not being a Natural Born Citizen and for not being male!
@realDonaldTrump Greatest Whiner in the History of our Country! KNOW COLLUSION! No Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there? #FakeTruth #TrueLies
@KamalaHarris is, no matter her place of birth, not a Natural Born Citizen of The United States and, thus, is not Constituionally eligible to serve as President of The United States of America! The same for Barack OBAMA, John McCain, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio! Oh, and only men ... https://t.co/KdkdMDo7EC
