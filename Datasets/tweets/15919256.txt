I want to be sure everyone sees this important correction. The 174 percent increase to Latino votes was in EARLY VOTING, not overall. That much of an increase would have put it way over 2016. I'm sorry for misleading you. I went back over the numbers and confirmed with @DCCC.
Making an important correction on this thread. DCCC says the percent increases are to early voting, not voting overall. So Latino EARLY VOTING was up 174 percent not voting overall.

The GOP has asked the White House to order investigation of Kavanaugh. Now the bottom line could shift.
@UnkyWarthog It is a reference to the action because some people may be confused. Yes Flake had a  caveat but it was not voted on. My tweet was to inform people confused by the process. The bottom line may change but right now his nomination was advanced.
@UnkyWarthog Yes. There was talk about a one week FBI investigation before a full Senate vote but that needs approval from leadership and the White House.
The bottom line is the Senate committee voted on partisan lines to send Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the full Senate today.
