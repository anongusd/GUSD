@BriannaWu My teenage son is very proficient in the use of the civilian equivalent AR15, and he often enjoys target practice at the range under my supervision.
@BriannaWu You're wrong. US citizens use them to defend their homes &amp; families, and several have even used them recently to thwart deadly home invasions.
