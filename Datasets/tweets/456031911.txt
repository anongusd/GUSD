No shame if Trump doesn't want the headache of the Presidency at 71. He said didn't know how hard a job it is. His voters could vote HRC
There is no Constitutional provision or Federal law that requires Electors to vote according2 the results of the popular vote in their state
Some people are saying Trump supporters might switch electoral vote to HRC because she's leading by 2 million votes. I don't know but...
According to WSJ,trump "didn't realize how big a job President was" That's reassuring...not! His face said it all election night &amp;with POTUS
