@tatedoll Not really negative or constructive? It's just fact. I'm so sick of little girls bitching about not wanting to "get out of bed" for college today or "my coffee wasn't right." Boo-hoo. Trying living in your car with a kid to raise. Those are real problem. That's all I'm saying.
@WilliamShatner @Google @GooglePlus The problem is, it wouldn't be able to accurately decipher which accounts are genuine. Because people like me who have to beg over and over for help would be categorized as dummy accounts. But it's not. 😞 https://t.co/b2MNCdJRbR

@realDonaldTrump You really want to help Veterans out? Then allow us to use our "earned" VA home loan for whatever type of home we prefer(RV, mobile home, etc.) without all the damn restrictions. We earned it. We should get to decide how we use it!?! 🤨
More than 330M people in the U.S.? I'm asking for a lot less $ than that. Just a dollar and a share/retweet would go a long way. Please help us get this going? We could really use the help. TIA. 😔 https://t.co/b2MNCdJRbR
