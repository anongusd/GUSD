Ambassador Joseph Westphal, the American envoy in Riyadh, traveled to Jiddah in Sept. 2015 planning to see Mohammed bin Nayef; but he was rerouted at the airport and sent to see MBS instead ‚Äî an unsubtle suggestion of who was really boss....
As tensions rose between the two most powerful clans of the royal family jockeying for power, "the royal court around MBS, even dared to try to kidnap a member of the Abdullah faction in Beijing in a brazen operation in Aug. 2016 that reads like a chapter in a spy thriller."
When King Abdullah slipped into a coma in Jan. 2015, the royal court tried to keep his mortal illness quiet as they speculated about succession possibilities, including the chance that Abdullah‚Äôs son Mutaib, head of the National Guard, could become king.
