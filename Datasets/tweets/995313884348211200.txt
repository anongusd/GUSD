@VZWSupport And the today! I received a text  from Verizon saying they will no longer send free reminder text that it was a fee based service. Just tired of it. My bill has nearly tripled since Verizon bought Alltel. They know have no other choice but pay a high bill.
@VZWSupport Then I'm not to sure but I'm pretty sure  got screwed out of a two hundred dollars. Then a mo th later I noticed I was being charged 70 for unlimited data  on my home phone! When I should have only been paying 17.99 or something.
@VZWSupport Then when I upgrade my phone in the fall 2018 salesman says get 200 off Note 9 when you add a line. I added a home phone line bought the phone. Get home a couple days later look at my bill. He added a home phone and another cellular phone. Had that fixed.
@VZWSupport Started last year when you took away free cloud service. You asked me to pay for cloud service, I turned you down. For 2 months after I had a daily notification on my phone to buy Cloud service. That's where it started.
#Aggravating since Verizon purchased #Alltel, #customerservice has failed me time time again, #Verizon constantly finding ways to charge more fees. All the extra fees, Guess go toward your bonus @HansVestberg_? Wish you would find ways help people save money not hand it to you!
Way to go @verizon add another fee to try and make your bottom line! #corporategreed might as well just take free out of all of your policies and promotions! Oh and throw another five dollar fee for #shitsandgiggles https://t.co/za6HcmVYbL
