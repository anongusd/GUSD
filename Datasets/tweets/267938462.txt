I hope that because of his status as a public figure we can shed further light on DHS policies and procedures and that She‚Äôyaa can appear as a witness before the Immigration Subcommittee to help draw attention to these issues. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/szbTfkMkXi
Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech? It looks like that. If so, that cannot be tolerated in a free society.
Recently he released a song criticizing the activities of the DHS in its treatment of immigrant children at the border. It was just a few days later that ICE chose to arrest him.
And as a successful artist, he is able to give voice to the views of so many Americans who are critical of Trump Administration policies, activity that is protected by the First Amendment.
As it appears he poses no danger to society nor does he appear to pose a flight risk, questions arise as to why this individual remains in custody rather than released on bond while his immigration case proceeds.

The Trump Administration ignored these concerns and issued a policy that prioritizes mass deportation and mass detention over common sense and humanity. This is an anti-woman, anti-immigrant and anti-family policy. It is mean spirited, unnecessary and it should be reversed.
And worse, the medical neglect of pregnant women in immigration detention was well documented in a recent administrative complaint to the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
The detention of pregnant women is particularly concerning because these centers often experience outbreaks of chicken pox, tuberculosis and other highly contagious diseases that can have life threatening consequences for the mother and baby.
The so-called ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù Trump Administration‚Äôs decision to detain pregnant women is shameful. Pregnant women need specialized medical care and immigration detention facilities are not equipped to provide specialized obstetric care. https://t.co/nsT0v6Fv3V

But we are not going to allow this without a fight. The Amash-Lofgren amendment to S. 139 would prevent law enforcement from accessing this information without first obtaining a warrant, and would protect the immigrant community from the Trump Administration‚Äôs deportation agenda.
It also fails to prohibit the use of information collected by Section 702 in any Administrative proceedings, including #immigration courts.
In fact, the Trump Administration has already begun attempts to prosecute parents of #immigrant children and this bill would give them an expansive tool to separate families.
S. 139 would allow the Trump Administration to use this powerful tool against DREAMers and others without immigration status.
This bill is supported by the Trump Administration, and nothing would stop the communications collected, stored, and accessed by law-enforcement agencies from being used as a weapon against #immigrant families for investigation, detention, and deportation.
The House will vote on reauthorizing #section702 surveillance tomorrow. This program collects communications - including emails, phone calls, text messages, photos, and more - of individuals inside in the United States who communicate with individuals outside the United States.

In the short term, Trump may appease his base with this decision, but the continued degradation of our humanitarian immigration policies will have long-lasting impact on the success and prosperity of our Nation. https://t.co/2XXUicAq2q
Economic analysis suggests that today‚Äôs decision to deport Salvadoran #TPS holders will cost the United States $31 billion over the next 10 years. You can read that analysis here: https://t.co/TKuhcn0RNA https://t.co/b9tISe4gDj
This will not just affect Salvadorans, but also their U.S. citizen spouses and children, the American employers and employees who depend on them, and the countless communities across the Unites States they helped build and live in today. https://t.co/0hoOz7ngW7
It forces Salvadoran #TPS holders to reconcile the danger that will face their families and loved ones upon return to El Salvador, with the prospect of tearing their families apart, and the uncertainty of undocumented status in the United States. https://t.co/E33yg7RCnf
Yet in one stroke, today‚Äôs decision from President Trump rips legal #TPS status from nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, many of whom have spent decades legally in the United States, starting families, working, studying, and contributing to their communities. https://t.co/T7ETpnXLY4
El Salvador has among the highest murder rates in the world, including one of the highest rates of femicide. In 2015, a woman was murdered every 16 hours in El Salvador. And from 2010 to 2013, 95 percent of murders in the region were unsolved or unprosecuted. https://t.co/hmOIYOqz6P

Without #NetNeutrality there will be harm to consumers, innovation,  free speech and our economy.
Overturning #NetNeutrality rules would leave upstart innovators stifled at the starting line instead of competing online.
Eliminating #NetNeutrality would be a paradigm shift - transforming internet so providers become gatekeepers who control what users can do
Due to #NetNeutrality, innovators - and therefore consumers - benefit bc big companies can't prevent startups from competing on the internet
On 2nd anniversary of #NetNeutrality, celebrate that internet providers can't disadvantage disruptive newcomers w/ barriers to the internet
The Internet was created as a neutral platform leveling the playing field for sending &amp; receiving info, #NetNeutrality protects this spirit.
