Lindsey Graham was just chased down the hallway by protesters screaming and shaking their fingers at him. Doesn't stop interview with Fox. "These people can yell all they want to. Doesn't matter. I believe him."
Calling a committee vote tomorrow morning indicates Republicans have a lot of confidence Kavanaugh squeaks through. It also suggests, some sources are telling me, that Susan Collins was reassured with what she saw. That would make confirmation a lot more likely.
That question @KamalaHarris just asked - Did Kavanaugh watch Ford's testimony - is the same question Senator Howell Heflin asked Clarence Thomas. Thomas also said he didn't watch.

After his uneven, halting Fox interview, Kavanaugh's allies were worried. Said he wasn't defending himself adequately and told him he had to be more forceful and specific. They got what they wanted.
I doubt it's accidental he's channeling Clarence Thomas, whose forceful rebuttal to Anita Hill was a factor in salvaging his nomination. "This is a circus. It's a national disgrace," Thomas told the Judiciary Committee in 1991. https://t.co/1DIiWGIUjX

At this point it's hard to imagine this hearing moving the needle much. Everyone has already made up their minds about whether this did/did not happen. And the pressure on Republicans to move forward and confirm will only grow from here. https://t.co/Qp9jMayQAP
..."No horror in my life has been so debilitating. Confirm me if you want. Don't confirm me if you are so led. But let this process end. Let me and my family regain our lives."
Many Republicans say they wish Kavanaugh would defend himself more forcefully. But there's no way he could say what Clarence Thomas did in 1991: "This leaked on me, and it is drowning my life, my career and my integrity. You have robbed me of something that can never be restored.
"It is uncertain whether much can be done to prevent a recurrence of this week's debasing drama, so extraordinary in that no one could take any satisfaction from it." (A reminder: THIS WAS 1991)
"Perhaps the ire is reaching new levels... and the mishandling of Judge Thomas's nomination will complete the formation of a critical mass of outrage. Perhaps a lot of incumbents will go."
"...and then encouraged him to tell the Judiciary Committee, in effect, that most of it was irrelevant. Judge Thomas insisted, to general disbelief, that he had never even discussed Roe v. Wade, the abortion decision that has obsessed political and legal circles for 18 years."
"The country has been brought to this point by a whole cascade of failures... Having nominated David Souter, a man who had written little about constitutional questions, the Bush Administration this time chose a man who had left a substantial and highly controversial paper trail.
"If (Thomas) is defeated, he will become a martyr to some, a villain to others, but what will be remembered about him by most people will be Professor Hill's accusations."
"Violent conflict is not unknown on Capitol Hill... But nothing quite like this."
Reading R.W. Apple's NYT analysis on Day 1 of the Anita Hill hearings 27 years ago, it's like he time traveled to 2018.  "The thing that turned people's stomachs, the thing that made them wince ...was the degradation imparted by the whole spectacle, not just a few dirty words."

Because if you missed it, Trump said on Fox this morning that he could see a future in which abortion is left to the states, meaning Roe overturned.

For every social conservative who rolled the dice and voted for Trump, their gamble just paid off in enormous dividends. (56 percent of those who said Scotus was "the most important factor" voted Trump.)
@JamesFallows There were lots of reason, I totally agree w you. I’m saying a big factor was the reminder Hillary gave them that they were “deplorables” and, of course, Trump’s constant harping on that.
@brianschatz It’s Twitter!
@esglaude I certainly don’t think that’s the only reason he won. Just one of many I picked up after spending a lot of hours talking to his voters and Republicans who don’t necessarily like him but feel compelled to defend him anyway.
@MarkHarrisNYC I agree. There are countless, unquantifiable reasons he won. But my problem with the bulk of these criticisms about reporting on the Trump coalition is that the left doesn’t want to hear it explained unless the answer is “they’re all racist and stupid.”
@esglaude Are you sure about that? What data says that another, hypothetical Dem nominee would have won? All I’m saying is people often gloss over how motivating it was to feel ignored, talked down to, voiceless. Trump exploited that and still does. It only helps him.
This is exactly why Trump won. Dems &amp; the media dismissed controversies that seemed small and exaggerated (a lot of which certainly were.) But they were galvanizing for Republicans who are highly reactive to being told by the media “this is not a story.” https://t.co/VJPVodCyzr

@jonlovett Bad form on my part. But you guys aren’t giving enough credence to the Nixonian, Silent Majority issue here. A lot of Republicans are galvanized by what they see as an angry radical left. And Trump loves to fan those flames.
@HeerJeet @brianbeutler I shouldn't have blocked Brian. But you guys are portraying Gina as something she's not. Being a Ron Paul activist six years ago doesn't make her a MAGA diehard today. She's conflicted about Trump. A lot of Paulite libertarians were and still are.
@JamilSmith My issue with this criticism is that it's distorting her role as a "Republican activist." Being a Ron Paul person six years ago does not means she's some MAGA diehard. She's not that. Lots of Ron Paul people, including Paul himself, say Trump is dangerous.
@Timodc @noPynchonhere @brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw Fractions of them were drawn to Trump, sure. So were fractions of Jeb voters, eventually.

@froomkin @nytpolitics You’re mischaracterizing my story and misunderstanding the issue. How is being a former Ron Paul activist possibly discrediting when she’s describing being a Republican who has conflicted feelings about Trump and isn’t happy about what political discourse has become?
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw You obviously don’t understand Republicans very well. “Right-wing” is lazy shorthand and totally misses how different Ron Paul and Donald Trump are.
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw Because she is a former Ron Paul activist that somehow makes her less credible as a source to describe feeling conflicted about supporting Trump? That makes no sense.

For an FBI director to say that he felt compelled to document encounters with the president because the president might lie is just surreal
