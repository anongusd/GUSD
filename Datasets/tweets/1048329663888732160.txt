@andylassner @Twitter @TwitterSupport I reported him too. Crickets
@brianstelter So they’re doing nothing?  Got it
@WalshFreedom Since his approval rating is 38% he needs someone to tell him he’s “great”. America ain’t gonna.
@ddale8 Same!
@KaivanShroff @CNN Love this!
@oliverdarcy @cnn should be next!
@joncoopertweets #hero
@chrislhayes Yes.  Whenever I complain about Trump to my husband... he says, but the economy....  that is the only reason he still supports him
@jimsciutto What a dummy 🤦🏼‍♀️
@jdawsey1 He really does lie about every single thing. Seriously?!🙄
@TopRopeTravis Hope hope hope
@admiralmpj @LaineyRubin @MSNBC Same stupid reason @CNN has Rick Santorum on.
@jdawsey1 Good. Maybe he’ll quit the presidency to run trump tv into the ground instead
@ShawnSE2HD @oliverdarcy It looks like he is reporting facts not telling anyone how to run a business.
@brianstelter https://t.co/dN9eo2gVDl
@RVAwonk That was f’ing horrible. He was an embarrassment
@SWHTown30 @andylassner @HoustonRockets You’re a horrible human being @SWHTown30
@TravisAllen02 I see what you did there! 💪🏻
@SenatorCollins Hmmm. If only we knew someone in the govt who could do something about this
As a citizen of the United States I hereby condemn the actions taken today at the US border in San Ysidro, the firing of tear gas by Border Patrol at migrant women and children, and call for the President of the US to be held responsible for crimes against humanity.
@oliverdarcy That’ll show us...
@TheRickWilson Will the new chapters be available on kindle?
@EWErickson @WalshFreedom So you’re a scientist now?
@joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump What a successful witch hunt 💪🏻
@jwgop In the third person. 🙄
@TheRickWilson Scientists rock! 💪🏻

@CillizzaCNN Taking a page from Trump, are we? 😂. Happy Thanksgiving!🦃🍁🍽
@joshscampbell Same
@jaketapper #iseewhatyoudidthere
@JacobAWohl You should eat some romaine lettuce. MSM reported you shouldn’t eat it therefore it must not be true. According to your logic
@kjothesmartass Totally stealing this! https://t.co/OJ3kvRhL1i

@SenBobCorker @SenatorMenendez Thanks for doing something
@WheresMyArk_23 @JacobAWohl https://t.co/VNkQDTZ5cz
@JacobAWohl Because it’s not true? 🤷🏼‍♀️
@jimsciutto No it doesn’t matter because he is lying.  HE personally benefits. The country doesn’t
@GovMikeHuckabee @Uber @lyft You don’t know how to use Uber
@jimsciutto He seemed nervous to say the wrong thing to his audience of one
@ChasingOzPhotog Either way I recommend getting it checked out!  Better to be nothing than something. 👍🏻
@WalshFreedom Another piece of the racist puzzle
@ChasingOzPhotog Yes!  Horrible stomach pain and hurts to move and even walk. Got to ER ASAP.  Mine rupture and I had a major seizure. I waited too long.

@CyrusMMcQueen Go to cvs and grab a bag! 🤣
@RawStory What did she say?
@CyrusMMcQueen Storage closet?
@CyrusMMcQueen Garage!
@PamKrugerwriter @jaketapper Poor George Soros.  He’s blamed for everything 🤔
@chelseahandler Yes please
@Acosta Stop going to these hate filled rallies.  He would then have nobody to spar with. Stop sending pool reporters and stop reporting on what he says. Less attention, less oxygen. Less hate. ❤️
@TheRickWilson They need to stop sending pool reporters too.  Immediately
@JoanAnzelmo @katierogers I say don’t even send the pool. Trump wouldn’t know what to do without the media there.
@jimsciutto Don’t listen to trolls Jim!
@joshscampbell @CNN @BrookeBCNN @KateBolduan @KaraScannell @ShimonPro Always awesome!
@sam_vinograd @joshscampbell @AshaRangappa_ @CNN Love you guys!

@funder @realDonaldTrump Are you listening @FoxNews
@delatiffanyhunt @Scaramucci @Twitter @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the explanation! 😊
@AmoneyResists @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Tweet of the day!
@PeteHegseth @RealSaavedra In this case his political affiliation matters.  🙄
@Scaramucci @Twitter @realDonaldTrump What does shadow ban mean?
@ParkerMolloy Someone told me it’s because he doesn’t want the reporters questions to be heard
@RedSox #DoDamage https://t.co/WmQp9UgYnP
@Amy_Siskind Complicit. Period
@MarkHertling So true!
@TheRickWilson Truth!  I just got followed by someone waaaay worse twitter feed with a big red x in his name
@GeraldoRivera @JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Outsmarted or lied 🤔
@RepSwalwell Congratulations!! ❤️
@abbydphillip @CNN does NOT suck

@TeaPainUSA @DineshDSouza There’s two at the Time Warner building he could check out ... right now
@chelseahandler @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews And stop sending reporters to cover them. Even if they are not on tv.  Trump would go mental
@MichaelAvenatti Will Kavanaugh keep his job after all this?
@EmmaKennedy He makes my skin crawl.  Similar to someone else we all know 🍑🤡
@EmmaKennedy Yes!  If this claim proves truthful does Kavanaugh keeps his job? 🤔
@TheRickWilson That was the best he could do then I guess
@jimsciutto @PressSec His speechwriter did a good job
@TheRickWilson Yup
@CillizzaCNN Is he talking about himself? 🤔
@Acosta @CNN rocks
@jdawsey1 What?  I don’t understand. He’s so eloquent 🙄
@TheRickWilson What in the fuck?
@realJeffreyLord @Acosta @brianstelter Why are you talking?  Ugh
@Acosta Did we expect anything different 😓
@katierogers Does @axlrose know his songs are the theme for racist rallies??  🤔
@marcorubio Dude.  Shhhhh
@bubbagump324 Doesn’t even make sense 😡
@TomiLahren Grow up
@VeniceRiley @TheRickWilson Giving potus topics for tonight’s rally
@kaitlancollins Pre-programmed lies.  Got it 👍🏻
@jonswaine @4everNeverTrump Cast of swamp creatures
@bubbagump324 He was just on cnn too. He must be walking the streets of NYC looking for cameras 🤔
@samstein We were hopeful but sarcasm doesn’t always translate on Twitter 👍🏻
@CillizzaCNN Thought it was already finished and ready before midterms?🤔
@joshscampbell Oh please...
@CillizzaCNN Always so well spoken and sincere 🙄
@ChrisCuomo @CNN ❤️
@jimsciutto Stay safe Jim ❤️
@IvankaTrump @CNN @SecretService You reap what you sow.
@PressSec You reap what you sow
@maggieNYT I want to like him but he makes it pretty difficult 🙄

@SenWarren @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenMarkey @RedSox #GoSox !
@NicolleDWallace Same.  I can’t look at him and when hear his voice I want to scream
@CillizzaCNN But does that automatically mean they’re criminals?  Wtf?

@CillizzaCNN That’s so weird
@MollyJongFast @thehill Won’t
@kylegriffin1 Cuz she’s not an idiot
@kaitlancollins 🙄
@maggieNYT Oh he’s dumb....
@Acosta Just stop going!!!  If the media isn’t there he has no show .... that would infuriate him
@JohnBerman @RedSox @Yankees Thank you for the levity in my twitter feed today! #DoDamage
@joshscampbell Be careful!!
@JohnBerman @RedSox #GoSox
@davidmweissman @TomiLahren I wouldn’t know
@RobinMehler1 @matthewamiller I just posted this too 🤣
@matthewamiller SPOT ON https://t.co/HtJ6qspyeT
