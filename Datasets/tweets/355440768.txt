HELP DEFEAT Senate Bill 817 in Maryland that says during stop, search, arrest, a police officer is prohibited from asking immigration status &amp; correctional facilities personnel from notifying fed. immigration enforcement agents about a held  illegal alien's release date/location
if they are asked about citizenship  status and fight deportation in court. So not only is Senate Bill 718 a  "Sanctuary State" bill, it also funds the legal defense of illegal  aliens if law enforcement dares ask about immigration  status.
Senate Bill 718  ties the hands of law enforcement prohibiting government, correctional  or police officers at the state and local level from asking about  immigration status or citizenship. This bill also provides for illegal  aliens to recover  court costs and attorney fees...
Help us defeat two bills  Senate Bill 718 and Senate Bill 817, which are both  bills that would effectively turn Maryland into a "Sanctuary State" for  illegal aliens.This legislation expressly restricts  the federal government's ability to deport illegal aliens from our country
