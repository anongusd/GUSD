@RealDeanCain @FoxNews @PeteHegseth Point taken. This has turned into a great conversation on both sides
7/ It‚Äôs never been about the flag, it‚Äôs never been about support for vets. It‚Äôs always been about giving white people a way to stick it to these uppity negroes getting rich playing sports.
6/ President Trump has inexcusably and purposefully  sought to re-ignite and stoke this fire from minute one. The only reason this is interesting to him at all is because the players are back. If his concern was respect for the flag, he‚Äôd have called Jerry an SOB.
5/ The problem, @RealDrGina is flag / anthem absolutists often reveal themselves to be hypocrites like Jerry Jones did...  https://t.co/3UvKfOeuUD
4/ The notion kneeling during the anthem is disrespectful is bizzare to me because our culture has defined kneeling as sign of reverence - more reverent than standing. So remind me how a sign of reverence is disrespectful to the flag? ‚Äî&gt;
3/ Most importantly, I have had the solemn duty of kneeling before the families of fallen heroes to express the gratitude of the  President of the United States and the service chief on behalf of a grateful nation. ‚Äî&gt;
2/ I choose to stand and sing with my hand over my heart, cap off. I kneel when I talk to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I knelt when I proposed marriage, I knelt before my mother‚Äôs casket (a woman I consider an angel). ‚Äî&gt;

@dbwilljr @goldietaylor I agree with that by and large. I‚Äôm asking how we determine the motive - the outcome is clear - the officers committed a crime. We‚Äôre basically talking about subconscious or intentional bias. Again outcome same, but isn‚Äôt it worth the inquiry?
@WhitHaney Not worried about that piece bc that‚Äôs easy to accomplish in DC. Great nations humbly wear their shortcomings on their sleeves, learn from their mistakes. What makes America great is just that - we‚Äôre honest about our history and never stop striving to be better.
@goldietaylor In my view, these officers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent - full stop. Now, my question is how do I determine whether they are motivated by racism or some other anti-social tendency? People can behave like goons and not be racist can‚Äôt they?
@WhitHaney I agree. I‚Äôd like them to include the Holocaust museum, the recently opened museum dedicated to the African American experience as well as the Native American museum.
@WhitHaney To your mind, if folks are wearing t-shirts with swastikas, Hitler‚Äôs face, and self identify, is that an inappropriate use? (I do agree the term and the comparison is often overplayed)
@dbwilljr Agree. I usually describe it as structural inequality because I truly believe we can get CJR done. Prison reform is great, but without sentencing reform what‚Äôs the point
@goldietaylor I remember it, and if I‚Äôm not totally crazy, I tweeted about it. Remind me, were the officers disciplined (I assume the answer is not in a meaningful way)?
@goldietaylor I learned about the importance of having allies from my incredible friends in the LGBT freedom movement. Calling everyone racist diminishes the power of the moniker,  it alienates those who care deeply about CJR, and it does nothing to make my son survive his next traffic stop
@goldietaylor I am with you on that, but it‚Äôs not what they said! I‚Äôve also seen white officers march with those protesting structural inequality in the system, and I know white Judges who have gone rouge when legislators failed on CJR - so we don‚Äôt want these people as allies? 1/ Con‚Äôt ‚Äî&gt;
@Head_Sanford @goldietaylor Put this way I agree: Law enforcement officers work in a system that is nowhere near color blind or class blind.
@lati21cela @goldietaylor Thank you for yours as well m‚Äôam!!! I have to say it #GoNavyBeatArmy
@Political_QRM @votevets M‚Äôam, I give you credit for expressing that respectfully. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs just not an opinion grounded in fact.

5/ These pictures, these recordings tell a chilling story that should bring both the absurdity of the Trump Presidency and the depths of his depravity into stark focus. ‚Äî&gt;

@KyleKashuv At the UNGA, not UNSC. Of a particular Iranian President who was particularly vulgar and offensive prior to the walkout. We don‚Äôt walk out of the Security Council. It deepens Israel‚Äôs diplomatic isolation. The veto is how Israel gets protected, not childish stunts...

@Scotttaylorva It‚Äôs not just the Navy thing either (TYFYS), it‚Äôs a competence thing. It‚Äôs not even that the media has it out for ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù although I admit the media has it out for incompent and/or grandstanding.
So @RepScottTaylor would be a perfect example of a conservative who goes on @NewDay and gives the impression Republicans can actually run something and do it well. This isn‚Äôt about politics, it‚Äôs about substance, and Scott brings substance.
It is beyond me why anyone puts @mschlapp on air. It‚Äôs an utter waste of time listening. We have plenty of real conservatives willing to make a substantive contributions. https://t.co/EvO6IBMDVU

@KyleKashuv @PJMedia_com @GregPittman1957 True that, but I suspect you did know this was going to shake things up and stir drama. Doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs a reason to interrogate you for engaging in a lawful activity and it‚Äôs certainly no reason to call you named.

@GregPittman1957 @Jovisoul @KyleKashuv Greg, stop digging yourself deeper. Some of us are trying to get something done on guns and have been for a long time, and I‚Äôve been at every school since Columbine, so don‚Äôt even go there. You showed a stunning lack of judgement that principally benefited the NRA.
@PJMedia_com @KyleKashuv @GregPittman1957 Before you get too excited, I entirely disagree with Kyle on guns, and shall we say, I know more about guns than he‚Äôll ever hope to forget. Doesn‚Äôt change th  math on the fact Kyle is 16 and the teacher, I assume, is an adult.

@SpudDaniel @KyleKashuv My point is Kyle received a ROBUST defense from adults like me (by his own admission) whose opinion Kurt actually cares about. Which similar situated people did that for David? You realize most of his act is making conservatives look rabid right?
@SpudDaniel @KyleKashuv The media has exploded. Google Kyle‚Äôs name. He‚Äôs more famous than me! What you saw here is people like me who know Kurt told him the truth.  Not everything is a grand conspiracy against conservatives. Those who claim otherwise are as asinine as he is.

4/ I don‚Äôt agree with Kyle about guns. I used to, but I had my own come to Jesus experience and my heart changed. He has no obligation to conform to my world view or yours. Take it from and old friend, Kurt, it‚Äôs time for a vacation.
3/ He‚Äôs acting exactly like an unusually smart 16 year old who occasionally commits the apparently grievous sin of acting his own age. That‚Äôs not evidence of pathology, it‚Äôs healthy.
Kyle, not unlike his peers, occasionally let‚Äôs his newfound notoriety get to his head and sometimes he‚Äôs a smartass on Twitter... (con‚Äôt)
