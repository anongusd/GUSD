If you truly believe all culture is borrowing &amp; no one can claim original ownership or grant permission, it doesn't make sense to defend yourself with the "permission" of Chinese in China. (Also, the qipao is a Manchu garment anyway.)

@j_zimms (I hasten to add that I also like Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus, Siouxsie, and all those European symphonic metal bands, but that was after Evanescence)
@j_zimms my "goth" phase started and ended with my first-ever CD being Evanescence, I am sadly not cool enough to understand this joke

I can't stop thinking about the pale, extremely goth teen in last night's dance class who miserably whispered along when the teacher made us all yell "I AM A B-BOY OR A B-GIRL."
Huh. https://t.co/xv5W9ttvan
