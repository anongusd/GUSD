We strongly encourage anyone who is discriminated against in areas of housing, employment, or public accommodations to file a complaint with Colorado Civil Rights Division. #copolitics #LGBTQrights
The fact remains that CO has a civil rights division &amp; anti-discrim laws that equally protect the fundamental rights of all Coloradans. Businesses may decide what products or services they offer, but they do not get to pick and choose who they offer those products or services to.
The very narrow ruling by the Supreme Court in Masterpiece vs. Colorado Civil Rights Commission does not change our country’s long-standing principle that businesses open to the public must be open to all. #copolitics
No matter who you are, who you love, or what you believe, Coloradans across our state – including LGBTQ Coloradans and their families - are still protected under Colorado law from discrimination in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations. #copolitics

Pure and simple, these anti-LGBTQ religious exemption laws are bad for local economies and bad for business. #LiveAndLetLive #HB1140 #RFRA #coleg #copolitics
Laws that ensure businesses serve people on equal terms without regard for their customers’ race, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity - as Colorado &amp; many other states do - are consistent with our Constitution’s guarantee freedom of speech &amp; equal treatment under the law.
Even if an LGBTQ couple offers a perfectly healthy, stable, and happy family to a child in the adoption system or in foster care, an agency could turn the couple away and deny that child a family, simply because of who they are. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA #coleg #copolitics
Every child deserves a family. If this bill passes, Colorado would join ten other states that have passed license-to-discriminate laws in the areas of foster care and adoption. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
As a nation, we agreed long ago that businesses that are open to the public should be open to everyone on the same terms. Businesses shouldn’t be able to pick and choose who to serve based on their beliefs. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
This mean-spirited, anti-LGBTQ bill is completely contrary to our Colorado values, and is an insult to the thousands of LGBTQ Coloradans who work hard every day and contribute to our economy. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
Freedom of religion is important; that’s why the First Amendment to the Constitution already protects it. Still, that freedom doesn’t give any of us the right to harm others, or to discriminate.  #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
Whether it’s obtaining a marriage license, adopting or fostering a child, working at a job, or accessing healthcare, HB-1140 would create a license to discriminate against LGBTQ Coloradans for practically any reason. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
This proposed bill defines “religious organization” so broadly that it would open the door for any individual or business in Colorado to discriminate against any LGBTQ person by claiming their religious beliefs give them the right to do so. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
This bill would roll back the clock on critical protections for LGBTQ Coloradans, upend our state's longstanding laws against discrimination, and create a damaging backlash that would harm our booming business climate and nation-leading tourism economy.  #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive
This proposal goes as far, if not farther, than the infamous Amendment 2, which resulted in Colorado getting a reputation as the “Hate State.” We don’t need to turn back the clock on all the progress we’ve made.  #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA
Whether it’s in the areas of adoption and foster care, health care, housing, marriage, employment, or public spaces, HB-1140 is designed to roll back protections for LGBTQ Coloradans and their families in nearly every facet of their lives. #HB1140 #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA

Under this bill, an individual or business could claim to be a religious organization because they do not have to be affiliated with a church or a house of worship. #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA #HB1140

Freedom of religion is important; that’s why the First Amendment to the Constitution already protects it. Still, that freedom doesn’t give any of us the right to harm others, or to discriminate. #LoveAndLetLive #RFRA #HB1140

Many transgender people cannot get their birth certificates updated because they cannot afford surgery, it is not covered by their insurance, they are too young for it, they don't want surgery, or they have a medical condition that prevents them from undergoing it. #HB1039 #coleg https://t.co/oKxpGHey1i

This is one reason why Democratic attorneys general in 16 states and DC are challenging the decision and working to appeal the decision as quickly as possible. These states are defending the ACA even though the Trump administration is not. We won’t go back.
Because of the ACA, less than 6% of LGBTQ Coloradans are uninsured. It has undoubtedly touched the lives of every LGBTQ person in the country, along with millions more. All of those gains are at risk in the lawsuit. #COhealth #COpolitics
If upheld, the case would eliminate the entire ACA. It would end Medicaid expansion, gut the insurance subsidies for low-income people, require seniors to pay more for prescription drugs, among many other changes. #COhealth #COpolitics
“Coloradans need to know that we aren’t going back to the bad old days of being charged more because you or someone in your family has diabetes or asthma or high blood pressure or any other health condition,” - Commissioner Conway #COhealth #COpolitics
Also, the Colorado Division of Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway says “Guaranteed health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions is enshrined in Colorado law.” #COhealth #COpolitics
In the meantime, the ACA and its protections remain in place. This has been confirmed by the Trump administration multiple times through statements such as "HHS will continue administering and enforcing all aspects of the ACA as it had before the court issued its decision."
The same is true for the ACA's nondiscrimination protections: nothing has changed and you should always expect to be treated with respect by health care providers and insurers. #COhealth #COpolitics
Nothing has changed because of the ruling. Folks who enrolled in 2019 coverage should pay their premiums and expect their coverage will continue without any interruption. #COhealth #COpolitics
On Friday, a federal district judge in Texas issued a ruling stating that the Affordable Care This ruling - which has been widely criticized by conservative and liberal scholars alike - will eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court. This will not happen until 2020 or 2021.

Instead of waiting for Washington to do the right thing, Colorado’s taking action by introducing the FAMLI act — a bill that will support working families by providing paid family leave! #cofamli #HB1001 #paidleave #FMLA25 #fightingforfamilies #coleg https://t.co/CLXNAgnGDM
32% of U.S. families have taken time off to care for family members and loved ones.		But did you know that number is even higher for LGBTQ families? 42% in fact. #cofamli #HB1001 #paidleave #FMLA25 #fightingforfamilies #coleg https://t.co/L5CtdzkA6T

*Why don't they and their families get your support?
Hey Mr. President -- you know what "warriors" YOU are undermining?		Thousands of patriotic transgender servicemembers who fight to defend our country's freedom. Why don't they and their get your support? #SOTU https://t.co/hTuLhlPMXs
We keep hearing from the President about support our military and troops.		You know what's a good way to do that? By not banning the thousands of transgender service members who put their lives on the line to protect our freedom from service. #SOTU https://t.co/EfvAikOHrF
These immigration policies the President is prancing on about will tear #LGBTQ immigrants apart from their families. #SOTU
"Good moral character."		What the hell is that supposed to mean? #SOTU
The President is now talking immigration.		We say: #CleanDreamAct and #CleanDreamActNow!!! #SOTU
This xenophobic rhetoric the President is spouting off is incredibly dangerous. It sows division and anger, and it puts innocent people in communities of color -- including #LGBTQ people -- at risk. 		It is not fit for the #SOTU.
We agree with the idea of paid family leave, Mr. President. That should absolutely be passed.		Now... can you get all of your Republican colleagues on board? #SOTU
Hey Mr. President...		What life-saving services that #LGBTQ Coloradans and their families depend on do you plan to cut to pay for this infrastructure plan, after you did the great tax giveaway for the wealthiest of the wealthy and mega corporations? 🤔 #SOTU
When the President talks about "rolling back regulations", don't forget he's also talking about doing away protections for #LGBTQ workers. #SOTU https://t.co/lB6vbgfdly
"Religious liberty" as the President refers to it -- unfortunately -- is code for religious exemptions, and licenses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Coloradans. #SOTU https://t.co/W7kaSdjEGK
Mr. President -- religious liberty IS PROTECTED. In a little thing called the 1st Amendment. #SOTU #LGBTQ
