I still wanna punch Lockwood in the face every time he's on the show tbh. Manchester Black's gotta dice him up with the sword. 👀
I have things to do, but there are dogs here...
Also ignore the fact I look terrible here. I lost nearly 90lbs since this lol. Second/profile photo is proof. 😂 But she is perfect. Completely stunning in real life. Really cool to meet. And I'm always on the lookout for what cool new stuff she's got going next. https://t.co/mm4rjFu0aR
It was really cool. I melted. I died. And I'm super happy her career has taken her lots of cool places since. She's a superstar whether she's playing a free show online, popping up in Black Lightning (😍😍😍), or places like Pitch Perfect 3.
She was down to earth and sweet. She was somewhat confused by the random specific album I picked aside from the new one. When I explained I was already a fan she was genuinely surprised because she had figured anyone there had come just for Morgan and she lit up.
I had vip, so I got to meet Morgan &amp; get things signed &amp; had a great time &amp; met really cool people specifically at this show. After the show Andy was at the merch table selling her stuff. So naturally I needed to go meet her 😍😍😍 &amp; buy the 2 cd's I didn't have copies of.
Then a few months went by, Andy was in the process of releasing One Step Closer. Morgan went on a Spring tour. Andy was the opener...So this is like the perfect show for me. My favorite singer who I've been lucky to meet a few times &amp; a singer I love and totallllly crush on.
So I was supposed to see Morgan James (my favorite singer) open up for Brian Culbertson with a friend. Morgan got a really nice opportunity and had to drop off from the show at the last minute and Andy happened to take her place. I immediately fell in love...
In case anyone thought I was kidding.....I have A LOT of music memorabilia, but meeting her is still one of the coolest show memories I have by far. I think I've threaded it before. Andy is amazing. 😍 https://t.co/Yi122DgxQJ
This is the fun content I needed today. She's a Prince stan. 👀 As someone who stans and is pretty much in love with Andy Allo, if we find out Kamala listens to her stuff aside from what he worked on with her, I might just die of happiness. https://t.co/vLkhNQJAWO

@StateBanjo Nothing's going to outright stop trafficking w/o hitting the direct source though. This is like addressing a symptom.	 I'm viewing it through the lens of closing Silk Road didn't stop drug/firearm trafficking but it made a dent. Bay area has a massive child trafficking problem.
Whether it achieved its intended impact is another issue. Sites like it are one of the main ways these kids get moved around. But I'm really just failing to see the other side I guess.
Maybe it's how I keep seeing it all framed, but she wasn't the only supporter of the acts &amp; the main point was to help kids who clearly don't have agency of their bodies. Maybe I'm not exposed to this world, but I'm failing to see when this became a major negative for everyone.
I'd like to know why she's the ONLY 1 getting heat for this when the point of closing the site was to prevent kids being trafficked, when those same abused kids are highly likely to INVOLUNTARILY be sex workers, &amp; these complaints seem to be by those who willingly choose to be. https://t.co/nnbtfOddM1

@Lemondrop1990 A lot of these early ones are just name recognition. He's popular mostly because of Obama, it being a white area, and the lack of vetting of his record (things like creating the bad 94 crime bill and Anita Hill will sink him). Kamala being ahead of Warren is huge though.

Also Shuri. ❤ Letitia Wright was phenomenal.

Letitia Wright singlehandedly made me want a spinoff film. https://t.co/i4yxxGpxaL
As an MCU/super hero film, for me personally I think you can only make a case for Winter Soldier, Civil War, or Infinity War itself above it.		As a deeper film/commentary on real life, it was on another level. I genuinely haven't liked any movie as much as it in years.
Me tonight.		On a related note, since I won't be home &amp; I did watch this movie in theaters multiple times &amp; more than the others in the MCU, I'm going to be gutted if it doesn't win anything. Black Panther was a great movie all around. Loved the intricacies. Loved the references. https://t.co/5yKHTDbZld

Shoutout to the random woman who won a 23,000$ jackpot right before I walked by. Give me some of that good luck today. Lol
The kids got a lesson on how the real world works w/ the Senate. There are more important things to care about.		Also, think. If she resigns for deLeón or whoever else you want; We lose 1 of the strongest Dems we have, involved in many committees that check Trump. Who benefits?
Seriously, people losing their damn minds over an edited video. Could she have come across better even in the full vid? Sure? Does this remotely matter right now? No. Stop. She absolutely should not resign. She offered the 16yrold an internship even after the "didn't vote" joke.
I'm more concerned that I picked up on the video being edited when I was wasted last night while a lot of people I like fell for it than anything DiFi actually did. Sunrise is sick for using kids like that. She passed stuff last week. This is worse than their stupid Pelosi stunt.

@notcapnamerica He was under a gag order, but it was limited to the area surrounding the courthouse, now it's a full gag order.		When he inevitably screws up again, he'll get jail pending trial &amp; because he got off easy here it's a lot harder to legally challenge the judge's fairness later.

@alpha1beta I've taken so many lately I feel bad, but I'm hoping they'll approve it. I'm not skipping Thursday. Plan was head down after work. But already off yesterday and missing Friday and next Monday for this trip. 😬
@msuamie And on top of that, I had already told her I wanted to go slower (because she was kinda freaking me out speedwise, and I'm a weird one who actually wants a regular relationship, lol)
@msuamie I had someone write me multiple paragraphs &amp; demand I lose her number for ghosting her a few weeks ago. I went less than a full day without answering, she was aware of my schedule, aware of some heavy family health issues that have been going on (all trending upward..slowly, lol)
@msuamie Thank you. 😊		Yeah lol I've had a couple funny dates where the other person's photos turned out to be a bit old. 😂 I am way too relaxed about even just exchanging numbers. I really need to vet dates more. Everyone I know in real life would agree with this, lol. 😂😂😂
@alpha1beta So do I call out? They know I'm sick and are caught up on all family health stuff. Worst seems to happen right after I'd get done my main stuff....😐
@msuamie Like any time last year or even within a few years, yeah I kinda get it....Now it's just like...Whyyyyyyy???  😂😂😂
@msuamie I'm awful at judging photos to know which are good, bad at making profiles, &amp; usually introverted. It's a bad combo lol.

@ScoutForKamala I despise him, but without evidence that he'll bring people together &amp; actually stop those things, I don't think a marginal improvement for me as a straight white guy is worth sacrificing everyone else's needs. If he shows improvement in the proper areas I'll consider the vote.
Additionally, he mentioned he's not crazy about ditching the filibuster.		With his specific agenda/identity, aside from being unable to explain it; it'd be political suicide for an R to help him get 60 votes on most of it.

@CandiceAiston I followed the parody account for a few weeks and had to unfollow it because I kept forgetting it wasn't actually him, and I'd get super annoyed because of how spot-on it was. He's too much of a living parody of that stupid site tagline.
Vinnie was absolutely right not to do any "reunion" shows after Dime's death imo. It was his brother. People should've respected Vinnie's wishes more instead of pressing him more about it. He was always open about how affected he was.		*Looks at Phil's highly problematic self.*
A scorching hot take that may make me lose some metal cred-		My favorite Pantera album is "Power Metal", not something one would expect like "Vulgar Displays of Power". Fwiw "Cemetary Gates" is my favorite song by them though.		My other hottake is I actually preferred Hellyeah.
I'm glad I got to see Vinnie before he passed. Hellyeah was terrific live and I'm happy I got through my nerves to make it to that show because it was at a time where I didn't have that under as much control as I do now.

@bootybootybry47 Lol. All good. I'm tired this morning so I thought I did screw up for a sec lol. It's a great deal allaround imo. If Clippers trade Danilo they can afford 2 max guys like the Knicks too. Even if they don't get AD they're set up for future moves instead of treading in the west.

I'm not fully up to speed on this at the moment, but what I read suggested it was initially not reported by msm because neither side of the story could be independently corroborated, &amp; then it was published by conservative-leaning media which led to everyone commenting on it.
It's okay to multitask &amp; say Northam should resign &amp; that Fairfax's accuser also has a right to be heard. These independent things don't negate each other.

Trump will probably say racist things at the SOTU no matter what &amp; if he attacks Harris on top of it, Abrams could completely ether him with how well she can explain race and identity issues/politics. She's amazing at nuance. She could have a field day here.

Gurley's usage wasn't some big mystery. He's a better outside runner &amp; the Patriots defense takes away the edge. Anderson is a good one-cut guy for inside runs. The Rams o-line got overwhelmed at times. McVay got conservative with playcalls at the wrong time. It's pretty simple.
Colin supporting positive things and genuinely doing some good things, Colin being politically ignorant to both parties, Colin spreading uninformed misinformation about politics, and Colin having problematic allies, are all not things that are mutually exclusive.
And I support him being on a team, because statistically and circumstancially, he should be. The Broncos offer came before he knelt and was a paycut before it was justified. Elway wrote pro-GOP garbage on team letterhead, he's clearly not gonna try to get him even now.
Reminder that despite his message on justice reform, Kaepernick threw a fit &amp; didn't vote because Bernie lost, used his growing platform to make uninformed comments about Hillary &amp; Trump being the same, &amp; counts the highly problematic SK as an ally.	 https://t.co/9x0mN5WKhG

RT @greggrosenthal: Sony Michel is receiving surprisingly little pop for gaining 355 rushing yards and 6 TDs in 3 playoff games.
I'm less salty about the Edelman MVP because of lost bets, but still salty because I do think it should've been Gilmore, Hightower, or Slater. Hell if Gronk had gotten a couple more yards on that great diving catch, he would've won it. Annoyed at the PED suspension this year too.
I did cleanse my defective hearing this morning with Outkast on the way to work so something good came out of it.
Can we now say that Adam Levine is just JJ Redick with more tattoos in place of muscle instead of making fun of JJ?
@wookietim @Bravewriting She still has her loyal following, but Cardi turning them down was a big story, and it's not clear that Christina was even asked, but they played "Moves Like Jagger", and she does have a part in that song that wasn't played.
Finally, how did you do the one part of that Spongebob scene that nobody would've cared about? Just closing the damn set with "Sweet Victory" probably would've redeemed a good deal of it.
NFL already dropped the ball by not getting Metallica for the recent San Francisco 1. Hopefully we get something better than Pitbull or Flo Rida with Miami up next. The shows will never come anywhere close to that Prince one though. Just go get Beyoncé, Gaga, or Bruno again tbh.
I DO like a couple Maroon 5 songs, and they mostly played anything I really would've wanted, minus one or two songs. But yeah, I feel justified in not paying the crazy prices to see them live. Don't see how it's worth it to me tbh.
So why couldn't they get Andre and just give us Outkast as the show? Why couldn't Ludacris get involved? Did they just not ask Christina Aguilera to be a surprise guest for "Moves Like Jagger"? Travis Scott just did nothing for me. I liked Big Boi, but he didn't get enough time.
I initially said the halftime show was "fine but underwhelming",  but upon further review it was trash. In my defense I was way more focused on the amazing 6-Man Tag Match on NXT for Halftime Heat. Gargano, Ciampa, Cole, Dream, Ricochet, and Black were phenomenal.

@BsAuntie @Bravewriting NJ law was unclear about if it prevented anyone from running for both at the same time since the existing law was simply that someone can't hold more than 1 office at the same time. Murphy basically clarified that he's ok. He's already raised about 8mil for reelection. He's fine.

I'm firmly Kamala2020, but I'm excited for yet another strong candidate to enter the race. I wouldn't be surprised at all if Harris were to put him in a cabinet position if she were to win &amp; I wouldn't be surprised if he did the same. I hope supporters recognize their friendship.
Gov Murphy signed a law to allow Booker to run for President and Senate reelection simultaneously because he wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He has a way out if his numbers aren't great early. I will enthusiastically vote for his Senate reelection as I did for Menendez.
Booker should be judged solely on his policies/politics as any other candidate, and not her's. He's done plenty of good for cj reform (&amp; I'm a Devils fan, he was absolutely right about fighting the old team owner). I will enthusiastically vote for him, if he wins the nomination.
For those who don't recall this though it'll likely be vetted in the future, fairly or unfairly. Dawson was a very pro-Bernie supporter. She then became a very pro-Stein supporter once he was out, and among other things denounced closed primaries which bothered me a lot.
If you'd like some specifics, naively kissing Sanders' fans asses when they were always going to do the racist attacks they're doing seemed dumb to me..And Dawson is very problematic if she's involved in any meaningful way though I wish him personal happiness in his relationship.
I like Booker. I'm a NJ voter. That said, he's not really in my top5 at this point for the Dems. He was initially, but some of his politicking rubbed me the wrong way, not so much a change in policy. He'd absolutely get my vote in the general &amp; in his Senate reelection though.
I see the RNC wasted no time in being racist to Booker... 🤦‍♂️ A lot of heavily coded language there..

I was a little active in 2016, but not as much as I should've been. I tried to push people about the courts, firearm control, etc. but feel I should've done more.		I did more in 2018 for the midterms. It still didn't feel like enough.		I'm already doing what I can for 2020.
I'm hoping it stays productive like it's been &amp; just hoping everyone stays vigilant since the bots &amp; trolls haven't slowed down. Let the primary be a clean "fight". If Kamala doesn't win like I want, I'm not pulling some "or bust" bs. I want the Dem nominee in the White House.
Personally, I'm very much for Kamala 2020. I have friends who are Gillibrand 2020, Warren 2020, still undecided since it's so early, etc. It feels like conversations are more productive. People are more educated about the divisive tactics. People I know seem to be vetting more.
Like obviously it's ridiculous that a certain group won't just shut up at this point with the toxicity and unfair attacks, but it's nice to see people still countering that bs, even if it's against candidates who may not be their top choice, or even a future backup choice.
A lot of people I ended up following since 2016 who are active about their politics are either already super into certain early candidates (like me), undecided, or waiting on some unannounced ones. It's refreshing that everyone's still defending against disinformation &amp; bs.

Maybe Dean Ambrose just wants a schedule that doesn't have him wrestle almost every day of the year? Or he really is just crazy and misses violence. 🤷‍♂️		If the reports are true I hope this doesn't inexplicably cause blow back towards Renee due to stupidity by fans or the company.
@SER1897 Tbh from anything I've seen, his campaign so far is "white supremacy &amp; protect my money, but I'm not Trump". He went further in calling AOC's tax proposal &amp; Harris' M4A endorsement unamerican, + was using "silent majority" in early vid. He'd wreck the US worse than the Sonics.
Howard Schultz has already said Kamala wanting M4A is unamerican,  made similar comments about AOC wanting to tax billionaires, (so 2 poc) &amp; used "silent majority" in his 1st campaign vid. Evidently his campaign theme is looking like it's just white supremacy.

@BoobPunchTina Wooooooo. Thank you 😁
Andddd apparently my tv did not record further so I'll have to dig for more on the town hall. I probably should've used hashtags or something, but Kamala was brilliant tonight.
The MeToo answer let her briefly mention her time as a sex crimes prosecutor, and probably be the first politician I recall acknowledging that there are male victims. I liked her answers.
Yes, yes, 1,000 times yes for Universal Pre-K. ✔✔✔✔✔		Also incredibly on-point about the "they don't care about other people's children" part.
The slight pivot to the LIFT Act was the proper answer to the false moral equivalency question. Like what the hell was she supposed to say, "Down with capitalism"? 		I'm a little surprised she didn't mention the worker bill of rights she wants in there. Cut for time I guess?
Kindof a pivot on bringing them home, but tbh it worked since the obvious implication is that she will properly take precautions.
I know I read the answer previously, but wow....Watching the full firearm violence answer was powerful.
The nicer way of saying "don't be a dumbass" as a response for what to say to the "a man has to run" question was also great.
Investing in green jobs. ✔✔✔		And support of a green new deal that specifically accounts for the need to train for those jobs. ✔✔✔
She really did prosecute for-profit colleges.		Taking more of them down is a positive.
Her recent history backs up her DACA answer and her border security stances. And she is absolutely right not to trade people as chips.		And anyone whose ever glanced at data even passingly knows she is absolutely correct regarding the transnational gangs.
"Make sure you're not the last" answer is money. This entire piece about breaking barriers just oozes hope.
100% on-point with the speaking like a leader points. Her courtroom experience shows itself again.
The M4A position answer seems idealistic. It's not my expertise, but my line of thinking is that we need to protect the ACA first, then expand to a mixture of private and public. I'd like a variation of M4A but I don't know the best way to get there. 🤷‍♂️

People with actual prosecutorial backgrounds have said this is a conspiracy indictment that just doesn't use that word. They're totally right.		Mueller's holding plenty more based on this. I'm inclined to believe Brennan's take that more "name" people will be indicted soon-ish.
In timing with the emails that suggested they talk about mystery bs health issues, it's already reported that Hannity seems to have taken cues from it and started that "reporting" around then. Recall that Cohen named him as one of his very few clients under oath.
Campaign related people-		Seems like Steve Bannon is one.		The other seems possibly Don Jr., Eric, or Jared.		Curious about the campaign-tied reporter though- Gonna guess Hannity or Jones if it's someone important namewise, or someone unimportant tied to Bannon via Breitbart.

Follow the money for most of the people involved and follow the data to make things airtight.
Manafort could theoretically be charged with state tax crimes or something similar if pardoned. Stone doesn't seem like he would be. Something equivalent to "treason" to a non-legal person (not a charge of treason) would be pretty tough to ignore.
Outside of Trump's own family, I'm not really sure who could be more valuable to truly flip. He's already angling for a pardon. You need an ace to make it politically impossible to pardon him without an impeachment, especially if there's no easy equivalent state crimes to use.
Beyond a reasonable doubt is a tough standard to hit. He wasn't charged with conspiracy, but better data collection likely gives them that to use in their pockets.
The "wiretap" theory seems like the most interesting answer. Maybe needed more to tie what he wasn't charged with together a bit more tightly. Things like how Wikileaks/Guccifer ties to Cambridge Analytica targeting, Psy Group, troll farm case, etc. Better leverage to flip him. https://t.co/LtXSz4EmUP

@MrDane1982 If Mueller's going based off of House Intel interviews, Jr. if it's someone in the family. Prince if not. With Jared, you have to be careful about not tipping off more people. With reporting that Middle East parts could resurface, &amp; Intel wanting Prince again, he seems logical.

Also personally, I'd be petty as hell about endorsing someone who tries to blatantly build me up for their own image when they couldn't bother to endorse me, as he never actually endorsed her in her race. But whatever. There's a lot of time. She'll make her own call eventually.
Truthfully I couldn't care less who she endorses, but speaking just politically, this just makes sense to me. It seems like the "safe" option that would be easiest to defend to her constituency rather than the guy who supported dumping toxic chemicals in poor latinx communities.
Since I keep seeing "AOC will endorse Bernie" as a shield already, doesn't it make more political sense for her to eventually endorse Gillibrand? Senator from her own state, votes the most against Trump's cabinet picks, &amp; progressive punch scores her as more progressive than him?
@notcapnamerica I'm just going to provide your mentions with this letter to various Senators from the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children, as it relates to the site they keep attacking her over, and the general statement that CA particularly has a problem with child trafficking. https://t.co/aH9wa2HJxL
@MrDane1982 It took me less than 10 seconds on google to find an article that acknowledges that video, and says "he still voted for it"......🤷‍♂️		Oh and more about his touting of that "tough on crime" record partly with that vote, and how he voted against the demilitarization of the police. https://t.co/dyOMJMiCaY

@WVPoliticChaCha Tbf, I'm not sure what he expected to happen there. He only recently resigned to focus on the campaign didn't he? He barely had coverage. Tbh, I never saw him making any impact. Buttigieg might not get many votes, but I wouldn't be shocked if he at least gets an appointment.
Judging by the media finally covering harassment issues related to his campaign, it seems like he'll actually get vetted this time, and not be allowed to act as a hanger-on for months after he mathematically loses. When he signs his JFA will he actually raise a cent this time?
Will Sanders answer for no-showing the Deripaska vote when he was busy for just 1hr(not 10), better answer for voting against further Russian/Iranian sanctions, or defend voting against Amber Alerts or voting for the Crime Bill &amp; anything that led to the "Bernie the Bomber" name?
Did Ojeda, the "Democrat" who voted for Trump after being a heavy Bernie Sanders supporter, bow out of the race today because of the reports of Bernie's pending announcement? Feels a bit coincidental.

When I was lucky enough to get tickets from Andrew WK at the Stone Pony to see him and Marky Ramone doing Ramones hits, that was actually our first concert together despite how many I go to. It's a really great memory for both of us.
I can't see him recovering enough from the latest setbacks to see Mott the Hoople. I know he'd love that. Hoping he's good enough by the time Bryan Ferry gets here in August though to maybe try that. We don't really see shows together, but the few we have have been extra special.
I have a lot of weird music things in common with my dad for some of the more classic bands I'm into. The part that makes it weird is he didn't get me into any of his favorites like Roxy Music, Thin Lizzy, Mott the Hoople, or even Ramones. My favorites led me to them eventually.

And if she doesn't win, I look forward to voting for many possible great alternatives. For me though, I strongly support her, and I'm hoping for the best.
With how tough last night and today have been for me, even with the hopeful outlooks with my current family health situations, I realllllly needed Kamala's official announcement today. I'm a complete mess today, but she fills me with so much hope for the future.		For The People
In conclusion, there are some things that should be questioned. But she was a stellar, progressive prosecutor. You can use Google, I don't need to hold your hand. She looked at things case-by-case, as she should. Kamala 2020. If she doesn't win, there are plenty of good options.
The death penalty does not statistically achieve its primary purpose as a deterrent to crime. That's aside from being immoral &amp; aside from its other issues. Harris not seeking it due to ideology was the right move. She knows the data I've studied. She knows the immorality of it.
As for her not seeking death for the copkiller, I back her on that. Regardless of raw emotion, capital punishment is useless as a deterrant, which is its main job. It's unsafe. Thise who administer it are largely untrained, there are ethical questions about prisoners who WANT it.
What did he donate to her over the years anyway? Like 11k through multiple companies? That's chump change in that state. The non-prosecution was a decision based on evidence for court, not a relatively irrelevant donation when she was scoring multi-billion dollar settlements.
The $25 billion dollar mortgage settlement is the largest of its kind. She rejected a very large settlement to fight for that. That's someone who'll take on big banks similar to Warren &amp; her CFPB-backing, not someone "owned" by them because a team decided not to prosecute 1 guy.
She was a damnnnn good prosecutor. She has some questionable things like specific defenses in taking state appeals to defend some trash officers. But noone in that line of work is going to be absolutely perfect. She was highly progressive. To say otherwise is to be dishonest.
There are differences between both issues of course, but to attack an AG for enforcing a well intentioned law are doing so because of only the negative results, and not even acknowledging any positives that came via alternatives such as diversionary programs.
Families who get dinged for truancy law violations are often suffering and need social services they may not know they have access to, similarly to those kids with the curfew violations. Enforcing those laws is a way to ultimately guide them towards resources that may help.
I met with people who did arrest sweeps as part of the planning process, scoped locations, made educational materials, etc. I was the lead "assistant" on this. We also watched vids about other cities' curfew laws and just shook our heads at how blatant their issues were.
The point was- 1. Let's keep kids out of the system for dumb things like curfew violations &amp; truancy. 2. Let's actually give them help. 3. Let's show how useful diversionary things like curbside/stationhouse adjustments are. 4 Let's show that the chaplaincy programs work.
A coalition, made up of police, the county ag, basically every relevant social service agency within the county, &amp; the group I was with did a special curfew sweep with the newer police chaplaincy programs as a result of finding this.
1 of my old jobs involved me organizing &amp; mapping juvenile arrest records. We found that in the 3 main cities/towns I looked at, curfew violations were abnormally high in terms of arrest rates compared to crimes that were actually serious.
There's gonna be so many bs attacks on Kamala about actually enforcing truancy laws when people don't comprehend that prosecutors &amp; law enforcement also don't like them, but many use them to steer people towards social services &amp; programs that actually help the kids &amp; families.

@lisalunu He's a legit evangelical though. The old couple's shadiness and the stuff with Russians alllll gets explained though, just keep watching.
@lisalunu There's a scene with him taking his shirt off in a room (early one) and it focuses on his tattoos. He has a nazi reichstag on his back, a skull, and an iron cross. His past gets addressed more in a future ep. The very brief exposition part happens in ep 11 or 12.
He was an evangelical villain, not an alt-right villain. They had multiple scenes showing it was his past &amp; how he was afraid of it &amp; he even got to have an exposition. If he was his old self than that would've been more accurate. He was a variant of the Mennonite comic villain.
I saw a lot of articles about how Pilgrim was an "alt-right" villain though before this season came out....He wasn't. He was an evangelical with an alt-right PAST as a neo-nazi gangbanger. He was literally Season 1 Punisher if he were still following orders and super religious.

I don't remember much besides them having anxiety about it last time there was a long enough shutdown but it all worked out. I told him what Kaine did to push for the pay &amp; I think that helped him stay a bit more calm about it back in the hospital. Dad's a Dem. He hates Trump.
Dad had an aortic aneurysm and needed to fix a relatively common valve issue, he's just old so the recovery's tough. Been home over a week now. Back in the hospital all he could talk about was being thankful he wasn't furloughed since he's retired with a supermarket job.

@GOPLeader @HouseGOP The administration is already violating court orders for reuniting families. Your party has no true sense of guilt about any of this. Anyone in NJ who remembers casino strikes knows Trump doesn't care about the struggling federal workers. McConnell can end this at any time.
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP This is transparent nonsense when there are bills Mitch could bring to a vote to fix things. You're a co-equal branch. You can act like it. Besides, Trump ended DACA &amp; there are thousands of kids in cages or separated. It's on you, former Speaker Ryan, and your party in Senate.
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Instead of holding 800k+ workers hostage because Mitch polls poorly/Trump polls better in KY, &amp; Mitch is up for 2020 reelection, you could just push him, then resume this nonsense of trying to pass blame since this won't pass with House D's as it lacks a pathway to citizenship.
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Or McConnell could just pass the unchanged bill that previously passed the Senate unanimously while R's controlled both chambers, which House D's re-introduced/passed, override a veto as wall money was offered before, &amp; you could work on something better; not just amongst R's.

Even if Rand Paul hadn't blocked that, there was 0 chance such a broad resolution was going to get through unanimously. I'd like to know more about previously reported foreign efforts to steer voters towards him &amp; Stein after the primaries were over. It still feels underreported.
He was 1 of 2 Sens to vote against additional sanctions (98-2 vote) &amp; the explanation was that this contortion was to somehow to protect the Iran Deal despite us ending up pulling out anyway. His past extremely broad Russia resolution also had 0 shot at clearing unanimously.
He evidently picked during this vote to meet with the women from his 2016 campaign who sent him a letter regarding sexism and harassment. For context, Gillibrand delayed campaign kickoff to do this vote.

@Bravenakwrites I won't vote for him either. I don't trust the 1 Sen that did not vote period on stopping the removal of sanctions on Deripaska after his shaky reasoning for his last rejection on a related matter. Plus his ACTUAL voting record and stans are both trash.  https://t.co/SaBc18Zasd
@BSO I'm only disappointed that Matt Barnes isn't somehow in this story.
Casual reminder that Sanders' 2016 chief strategist Tad Devine was a witness against Manafort &amp; directly in multiple pieces of evidence at his trial in light of Bernie not voting regarding the removal of Deripaska's sanctions. Tad was among those who 1st pushed Bernie to run.
So is there any particular reason why @SenSanders didn't vote on the measure to stop the sanctions on Deripaska from being lifted? It failed to get 60 votes despite 11 R's voting for it. It was only short by 3 votes so he would've been a critical vote.	 https://t.co/SaBc18Zasd

It's gross that people keep blaming Gillibrand for this. He should do the right thing &amp; talk to those donors who keep supporting him &amp; tell them to quit blaming her. He should man up &amp; tell them he is responsible for his own actions instead of being a silent misogynist. 5/x
Of course he was a very likable Senator. It sucks that he did trash things. If he were a Republican Senator, you would all be praising them. The calls for his resignation lended moral credibility in the future during the Kavanaugh hearings...&amp; he was still replaced by a Dem..4/x
W/ his resignation, Booker &amp; Harris gained (&amp; kept) spots on the Sen. Judiciary Committee, where both (especially Harris) have been outright terrific between hearings for Kavanaugh &amp; Barr for example. Sessions tripped himself up. Franken really didn't do much in that instance.3/x
Defending sexual harrassment/assault victims has been a consistent strong point for Gillibrand, not a thing she's flipped on. She isn't responsible for the man's actions or even his choice to resign. He is. Additionally, Dems gained several major benefits from the resignation.2/x
11 Dem Senators called for Franken to resign, not just Gillibrand. Minority leader Schumer, Casey, Brown, Hirono, &amp; Harris were just some of the others. He is responsible for his own actions. There were 8 accusers. Stone's media connects just gave him a heads up. 🙄 1/x

@Every1SayIMBoss Just let R-Truth be the women's champion. I'm sad they didn't let him fight her. Lol.		Probably Liv if they were same brand. Like start with a feud cuz they're basically the same, then they become friends or something. I'm not really sure who fits with her.

All the other white guys that got sad at me for tweeting mildly about Tulsi being trash earlier after about 2 minutes of googling to be sure I had proper context for part of it are reallllly gonna be sad when they find out us straight white guys aren't the Dem base.

I don't care about her enough to go further on this tonight. I'm not voting for her and I'm out anyway. Her history is long enough for you all to vet on your own and make your own decisions. It's a "hell no" for me though for whatever that's worth. We can easily do better.
In critical votes according to Progressive Punch, out of eligible Reps, she went progressive only 76.53% of the time, and holds an F district rating. She's a 92.39 (156th overall) in lifetime progressive votes. Seth Moulton is actually slightly ahead of her for context re: ovr.
That example was from while she was a state rep. A cheap shot would be using her father's presidency of a group called "Stop Promoting Homosexuality America" in the 90's. She turned 18 in 99. Hold that specific example against her conservative state rep father.
Tulsi Gabbard as a Hawaii state rep testified against a bill allowing homosexual civil unions and called supporters of it "homosexual extremists" that the Democrats shouldn't support over a majority opinion. I called her homophobic in the last tweet. I didn't stutter.
RT @TheStagmania: Y’all can stop tweeting about Dems “eating their own” because Tulsi Gabbard is absolutely not on our team, no matter what…
RT @CharlesPPierce: So Tulsi Gabbard is more offended by Maizie Hirono than she is by Bashar al-Assad?	Got it.
@KaraCalavera #GotPredictions Tyrion is killed for his mystery deal with Cersei being likened to treason. When Dany takes the throne without his guidance she becomes the mad queen he was worried about. Jon "sacrifices" her, then defeats the WW &amp; abdicates like Aemon did. Sansa rules Westeros.
@Biancadelarosa8 I genuinely can't come up with another reason for why anyone likes her. I'm convinced it's that and using her as a justification for their own shittiness.
@Biancadelarosa8 I know how this is going to sound, but I'm convinced she's only relevant because bernleft &amp; farright look past or endorse her homophobia, dictator apologizing, genocide denial, &amp; Bannon's admiration of her because they want to bang her &amp; think that means they aren't still sexist.
Tulsi Gabbard is an Assad apologist, homophobic, admired by Steve Bannon, &amp; a genocide denier. She is an atrocious candidate for Democrats on her own merit. I welcome the fact that her campaign's donations should be heavily scrutinized for violations.

Wentz is the franchise QB. We're lucky to have both guys. Foles  is clutch. But most in history? Stop. He gets the ball out fast. When he has protection like last Sunday the odds favor him, as they would for most quarterbacks. Some hits he DID take would've been sacks for others.
Foles is a slightly above average QB with a sample size of 40+ games that shows he gets lucky sometimes. He's a great fit with this team. When the line plays well he has an easier time taking risks. Wentz does need to hold the ball less instead of always looking for the big play.
Primarily Eagles fan here, but Lol absolutely not.		Foles performs well in the playoffs because he doesn't hold the ball long, has a quick release, &amp; excels at play action and rpo's/scheme fit. When oline plays well, his risk is mitigated a bit. Line stepped up greatly on Sunday. https://t.co/f0NXyR0NTx

@Usbros_mh A part of why I strongly like some of the candidates I do is the Judiciary Committee experience, Kamala's background especially.
@Usbros_mh My first choice is Kamala Harris. I like others like Klobuchar, Booker, Gillibrand, Castro, and Brown as well. I like Beto a lot but prefer that he runs against Cornyn in 2020.
@Usbros_mh I feel that though she means well &amp; does seem to try to improve whereas Bernie has been fully tonedeaf only focusing on class, she needs to continue to be more racially inclusive in her economic stances. Like more on universal pre-k first less on free college.
Yeah she was a Republican...over 20 years ago, so get over that as an argument against her. I don't dislike everything she's for. I strongly support the CFPB for example. I think she generally means well with a lot of things. I just prefer a lot of other candidates.
I've been skeptical about Elizabeth Warren forever, but my dislike of her wouldn't prevent me from voting for her if she's the nom. I just strongly support far more people than her. I'd rather her than Biden/Bernie, but prefer so many others above those 3.
