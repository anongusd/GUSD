Corruption in #ElSalvador has run rampant for too long. I urge President-elect @nayibbukele to follow through on his campaign promise to call for a #CICIES.
#TPS has been extended through Jan 2020, providing a reprieve to over 250,000 immigrants from #Haiti, #ElSalvador, #Nicaragua, and #Sudan. Good news, but thousands of others are still feeling the urgency for protection. #SaveTPS
the Expanded Background Checks Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), passed by a vote of 228-198. Both bills now await further consideration in the Senate.
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), passed by a vote of 240-190. H.R. 1112,
I call on my colleagues in the Senate to listen to the will of the people and pass this package of bills, so they can be signed into law.”
More than 90% of our country support these commonsense steps and I want to thank Rep. Mike Thompson and Rep. James Clyburn for introducing them.
By extending the background check system to all gun sales, not just licensed dealers, and extending the time frame for a check to be completed, we can ensure that our laws are effective and American lives are protected.
These bills close dangerous loopholes in our background check system that have allowed otherwise prohibited purchasers to obtain deadly weapons.
I was proud to stand with my colleagues as we sent the Bipartisan Background Check Act of 2019 and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 to the Senate.
That changed this week.  The House of Representatives passed two, long overdue, bills that strengthen our background check system.  As a member of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,
For years, Congress has offered nothing but ‘thoughts and prayers’ when innocent civilians lost their lives to the gun violence epidemic that is plaguing our country.
Proud to reintroduce the Respect for Peace Corps Volunteers Act w/ my colleague @RepGarretGraves.  My full statement: https://t.co/mvrDTTPLhd
I am proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to save lives by passing #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. We can’t afford to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue, this is about American lives and the people demand action to #EndGunViolence.
I sat down with @Nfarvardin, President of @FollowStevens and  to talk about the importance of encouraging students to pursue a career in #STEM. https://t.co/Z2QQMSwudO
Today, at the @HouseBudgetDems hearing we discussed the countless amount of flaws of the #GOPTaxScam – middle class Americans are suffering, and we must ensure benefits of tax assistance goes to those who need it, not to line the pockets of the top 1%. https://t.co/2gUHLnLo5J
Yesterday, I voted for the most comprehensive conservation legislation in a decade. It permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, designates over 1 million acres of wilderness, and expands national parks. This is a major victory for our natural heritage.
Yesterday, the WHEM Subcommittee of @HouseForeign held its first hearing on the #humanitariancrisis in #Venezuela. Thanks, @MarcelaEscobari @SantiagoACanton @MoisesRendon for your testimony. #ElMundoEstaConVzla https://t.co/cSelEkwrEB

I met with #AIPAC representatives from #NJ08 to discuss their concerns about the on-going conflict in the #MiddleEast.
STEM is critical to the progress of our country which is why last night I voted for H.R. 425, supporting veteran’s involvement in STEM education, computer science, and scientific research.
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 276, which recognizes employees who demonstrate excellence beyond the classroom. Last night, H.R. 276 passed the House &amp; awaits action in the Senate.
The Cuban referendum does little more than affirm the Communist party’s stronghold on Cuban life. The Cuban government’s oppression of the opposition proves that their intentions were never for a free and transparent referendum. My Full Statement: https://t.co/cQM9R6xYeT

I am pleased that my colleagues were able to draft bipartisan, bicameral legislation that focused funding on priorities such as infrastructure, affordable housing, research and development, grants to address the opioid crisis, and community development.
Yesterday’s vote rejected @realDonaldTrump $5.7 billion wasteful border wall proposal, instead allocating money for key programs that impact daily life in our communities.
Last night, I voted in favor of a compromise bill that prevented another gov't shutdown and returned longer term stability to millions of families across the country. Hardworking Americans should never have to work without pay or face missed paychecks due to policy negotiations.
Today, I sat down with Chairwoman @KarinaSosa_2, a member of Parliament in #ElSalvador, to discuss #TPS and #DACA for Salvadoreans in the U.S. More than a million Salvadoreans reside in the U.S., many of whom went through great danger to come here in search for safety. https://t.co/9m61LtP8nQ

The past 35 days have yielded only sorrow and frustration for hundreds of thousands of families across the country. Hard working Americans shouldn’t have their paychecks held to further policy negotiations.
While I’m happy that the shutdown has ended, short term CRs are not a responsible way to fund the federal government. We must ensure that all departments receive adequate funding so they can plan and execute vital work.
The shutdown is severely impacting our national airspace. Groundings at @LGAairport and severe delays at @EWRairport are signs that the system is breaking down. This shutdown needs to end. My full statement here: https://t.co/1ubkHnvHa3
I strongly urge the @Senatemajldr to get on board and work for the people – not just @PresidentTrump. H.R. 648 is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that improves border security while ensuring that Americans are paid for their work. It is time to end the #TrumpShutdown
This bipartisan compromise legislation was negotiated by members of the House and Senate last year and has funding for ports of entry security improvements, hiring additional immigration judges, and assistance in Cent. America to address root causes of migration.
H.R. 648, which passed by a vote of 234 to 180, provides funding for 8 of the shuttered government agencies and includes over $1.6 billion for border security measures.
Today House Democrats once again voted on a bill that will help reopen the government and #EndTheShutdown. For far too long American families have been held hostage and are facing serious financial problems because of the #TrumpShutdown
I hope that Mr. Guaidó can restore democratic institutions in the country and commit to protecting civil liberties and human rights for all. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/K3yhz7gl7X

On this day 61 years ago, the people of #Venezuela ousted an oppressive dictatorship and now they are rising up again. It is clear the socialist experiment in Venezuela has failed, leading #Maduro and his cronies to think only of themselves and their bank accounts.
I vow to work with my colleagues to combat prejudice and discrimination and fight for those who sacrifice themselves in service to our country.
This directive undermines the foundational values of our society and I am deeply concerned by any court rulings that could result in this ban being implemented.
The Administration’s ban prohibiting transgender individuals from military service is institutionalized discrimination.

I remind @senatemajldr that Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government and therefore our actions should be based on the will of the American people, not just the will of one man at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The House of Representatives is working every day to reopen the government because it is our duty to return stability to the 800,000 impacted federal employees, their children, their parents, their friends, and their communities.
To date, the House of Representatives has sent six shutdown related bills to the Senate and none of them have been taken up.
Another resolution that the House voted on, funding the Department of Homeland Security through February 8, 2019, passed the Senate just days before the shutdown began.
@senatemajldr claims none of the House’s resolutions are workable, yet a set of these resolutions, reopening six of the nine impacted agencies, passed in the Senate last year by a vote of 92-6.
Since the start of the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed numerous bills that would end the government shutdown while the Senate has not voted on a single bill to reopen shuttered agencies.
Today is the 26th day of the partial government shutdown and it is long past time for the Senate to vote on reasonable legislation.
Today, it is my honor to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore on the House Floor and oversee the morning hour. https://t.co/Hrz5JoD9nB
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”- #MLK. Today we honor a true inspiration to the American people as we recognize his 90th birthday.
Their shameless discrimination and oppression of ethnic and religious minorities is a disgrace and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to shine a light on these brutal tactics.
We must not allow #China to continue getting away with punishing innocent civilians.
Today I met with advocates to discuss the terrible #HumanRights abuses taking place at the hands of the Chinese government against the #Uighur population.  Millions of people are being unjustly imprisoned in concentration camps and having their basic rights violated.
It is important to conduct a census which is comprehensive and accurate. I will continue to work with my colleagues in advocating for the removal of a citizenship question from the 2020 Census.
I welcome the ruling of U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman blocking the Administration’s addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. This question would discourage census participation which is used to calculate critical resources for states and communities.
As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I pledge to work diligently with my colleagues to determine if the President is negotiating away America’s security behind closed doors. The American people deserve to know the truth. My full statement here: https://t.co/db846pH4cD
It is deeply troubling that President Trump has reportedly gone to great lengths to conceal the contents of his conversation with Vladimir Putin. This continues the President’s reckless trend of emboldening leaders that actively seek to undermine American national security.
I applaud the passage of this bill which provides critical resources to help some of the most vulnerable in our communities. It now awaits further action in the Senate.
Today, the House passed H.R. 430, the TANF Extension Act of 2019 which will temporarily extend much needed assistance to low income American families with children.
#Maduro continues his attempts to extinguish democracy from #Venezuela. I am grateful that Juan Gaudió is home safe and can continue to lift the oppressed voices of Venezuelans against this brutal regime. My statement: https://t.co/PVpohIxmCR
Raising the rate which banks can devote to Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) will accelerate American entrepreneurship – growing small businesses &amp; our local economies. More info can be found here: https://t.co/5eg9czmJyA
Going to the @HouseFloor to vote on H.R. 116, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2019 – bipartisan legislation to increase capital investment in small businesses.
Please see my weekly Washington Review for a recap of what I focused on this past week in Congress: https://t.co/Mur2YWD2zr
I’m pleased that H.R. 266 passed by a vote of 240 to 179 on the House Floor. I call on @SenateMajLdr to take up the numerous bills passed by the House that would end this shutdown.
This bill would fund the Department of Interior and its agencies at last year’s funding level. This would reopen museums, put park rangers back to work, restart the EPA’s conservation work, and gives thousands of federal workers the pay they’ve earned.
Shutting down our parks, shuttering conservation programs, and keeping paychecks from the men and women who keep it all running is immoral. Today, the House is voting on H.R. 266, which would fund the Dept of Interior and all the agencies it oversees.
Large numbers of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staff have been furloughed, putting a stop to health enforcement activities and state grant allocations. Essential staff is still working on disaster response issues but they are working without pay.
The #TrumpShutdown has effectively shut down services at national parks and nearly 3/4ths of Interior Department staff furloughed raising the risk of visitors getting hurt and of misuse of the lands.
We have a responsibility to carry on this legacy of conservation for future generations – just as our predecessors did for us.
Our national parks are our natural heritage – decades of conservation work have made it possible for our generation to enjoy the bounty of our nation’s natural wonders.
I call on @SenateMajLdr to hold a vote on these, and other key appropriations bills so that we can end the #TrumpShutdown and restore order to the federal government.
These two pieces of legislation would open vital federal agencies and restore stability to thousands of families across the country which is why I just voted for them on the House Floor.  H.R. 265 passed by a vote of 243 to 183 and H.R. 267, passed by a vote of 244 to 180.
and stolen millions of dollars on the backs of the Venezuelan people. I stand firmly with the Venezuelan people and applaud our friends and neighbors in the region who will not recognize his presidency. See my full statement here: https://t.co/0lTlb9NTDK
#Maduro and his regime has run #Venezuela in the ground, and his inauguration is a complete sham and a slap in the face to the Venezuelan people. #Maduro has ordered his cronies to violently oppress the peaceful opposition
And the shutdown has threatened state highway and transit construction projects, many of which are funded by Congressional grants. Passing H.R. 267 keeps these projects running.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseen by the Department of Transportation, has been forced to stop its work on thousands of safety investigations. H.R. 267 keeps puts this critical agency back to work on behalf of all Americans' safety.
Passing H.R. 267 puts these important agencies and workers back to work with the pay they earn for keeping our skies safe.
The shutdown has forced the FAA to suspend processing of pilot background checks, putting new pilot hires on hold. Our nation already has a shortage of qualified pilots.
Also, our nation's Air Traffic Control (ATC) operators, who keep our airspace orderly and safe, are working without pay and training of new ATC staff has been suspended.
Currently, the majority of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) staff who work to certify aircraft safety have been furloughed.
H.R. 267 would reopen the Department of Transportation, restart safety and oversight programs currently on pause, and pay the Americans who keep us safe.
Currently, individuals trying to use a Federal Housing Administration loan to purchase a home are facing delays because of the staff shortages and the delays could grow the longer the agency is impacted by the shutdown.
By passing H.R. 267 we could ensure that these inspections resume and rent assistance programs receive funding – eliminating the risk of evictions due to lapse in coverage.
Thousands of people rely on rental assistance programs that are funded through HUD and the shutdown is unnecessarily putting these individuals at risk of eviction if it lasts long enough that previously appropriated money runs out.
95% of staff at the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been furloughed and health and safety inspections of housing for the elderly, disabled, and low-income families have been suspended.
H.R. 267 would fund key agencies under the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development that have been drastically impacted by the #TrumpShutdown.
In addition, this bill would fund the Department of Agriculture – including conservation programs, food safety and inspection, agricultural research, as well as loan and grant programs to help farmers and the undeserved in rural areas across the country.
Also included in H.R. 265, is funding for the Food and Drug Administration, which during the #TrumpShutdown has stopped some of its routine food safety inspections due to forced furloughs.
Without additional funding, millions of families who rely on SNAP for basic nutrition will face extreme uncertainty as the Trump administration could not ensure that the benefits would continue if the #TrumpShutdown continues until March.
Under H.R. 265, $103 billion would be provided for domestic food assistance programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and school breakfast and lunch programs.
These bills would reopen a number of departments impacted by the #TrumpShutdown and restore vital operations that millions of Americans rely on every day.  So let’s break down what is covered by each bill.
Today, the House of Representatives will be voting on two appropriations bills – H.R. 265, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act and H.R. 267, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Act.
Great speaking with David Gutierrez, the Ambassador of Belize, I look forward to a continued relationship between the U.S. and Belize. https://t.co/1RLmfhAfgb
Going to the House Floor to vote on a bill that would reopen a portion of the government currently effected by the #TrumpShutdown.  By reopening the IRS we can ensure that Americans do not face significant delays in their tax refunds.
@RealDonaldTrump, you should help Americans manage their forests instead of keeping critical government assistance from them - and this tweet doesn’t change the fact that FEMA is one of the agencies shuttered thanks to the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/P3ZDDm1Lyk
Earlier, I discussed the value of Taiwan’s involvement in Latin America and the need for continued engagement with Alexander Tah-Ray Yui, The Taiwanese Director General of the Department of Latin America. https://t.co/Z1lS4RBlDA
As an immigrant and the Representative for the 8th District of New Jersey, I reject the President’s fear mongering and believe that America will always be great so long as we remember our creation as a country of immigrants.
He claimed migrants are causing a humanitarian crisis at the border, but the true humanitarian crisis stems from President Trump’s complete repudiation of American values, history, and culture.
He claimed migrants are violent people when statistics show that undocumented immigrants commit less violent crimes than the general population.
He claimed a wall would stop drug trafficking across the border when government statistics show that most drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry.
He claimed migrants are driven here solely in the hope of economic gain when most are fleeing violence, drug cartels, and hunger.
Last night, President Trump lied to the American people from the Oval Office.
I stand with the 97% of Americans who support background check laws. Congress must act to save lives and pass #HR8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. #NeverAgain
@realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr must understand the burden being placed on TSA workers and federal employees here in NJ &amp; across the country.
Earlier today, I stood with @senatormenendez, @SenBooker, &amp; @RepDonaldPayne at the @EWRairport to demand an end to the partial gov’t shutdown. https://t.co/vo73jVWc8a
This #CervicalHealthAwarenessMonth learn more about prevention, cervical health and HPV: https://t.co/utIHtwRaer
Did you know HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer? Cervical cancer affects roughly 13,000 women in the United States, yet it is preventable through vaccination and regular screenings.
Robust, independent investigations into government corruption must be carried out. Any alternative is unacceptable.
Today’s #CICIG announcement is another blow to the protection of #democracy and #humanrights in #Guatemala. President Morales’ contempt for the institution is a roadblock to peace, prosperity, and security for the Guatemalan people.
Last night, I voted to end the government shutdown and I call on my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.  Read my full statement: https://t.co/2XC79jg5FA https://t.co/V0XOuphpyq

Absolutely an embarrassment for the U.S. to undermine our allies the Kurds. Again. President Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of Syria is nothing short of a gift for the Iranian, Russian, and Syrian regimes to have free reign over the region.
More information on the @pressfreedom report can be found here: https://t.co/DVn0GnKT4W
Through the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I hope to work strategically with our international partners on this issue. 4 journalists were murdered in #Mexico alone this year &amp; just last week, the #Nicaraguan gov’t raided press offices that are critical of the #Ortega regime.
Global #pressfreedom is tragically in crisis and, absent significant leadership, will only grow worse. Congress must fight to protect journalists and press institutions at home and abroad – a society committed to justice requires a free press.
The brutal murder of #JamalKhashoggi is sadly part of a disturbing international trend. A new report from @pressfreedom shows that the number of journalists killed for their work nearly doubled in 2018 compared to the previous year.
I joined @GovMurphy to congratulate @NJTRANSIT on a milestone in installing positive train control, a critical rail safety technology. I will keep working in Congress to give them the tools they need to keep commuters safe. https://t.co/N9G1lTTgag
#Guatemala deserves a free, transparent government – not a tool to enrich the powerful
If President #Morales thinks he can hoodwink the international community &amp; impede justice, he should know the world is watching. We are monitoring the visa revocation of 11 #CICIG staff members who were working on some of the most important anti-corruption cases in the country.
The ACA continues to remain in effect while challenges make their way through the courts. Maintaining the health care of millions is one of my top priorities, and I will continue fighting to preserve access to care through legislative solutions with my colleagues.

H.R. 7245, The #Venezuela Humanitarian Relief, Reconstruction, and Rule of Law Act of 2018 takes a comprehensive approach by authorizing desperately needed humanitarian aid while increasing the costs of supporting the #Maduro regime and holding these officials accountable.
#Maduro has incrementally dismantled Venezuela’s democracy while repressing, marginalizing, and rejecting the basic needs of his own citizenry, this can’t go on any longer.

President George H.W. Bush was a true patriot who worked earnestly for the American people. Regardless of politics, he will be remembered as a model for leadership, compassion, and public service. While the country mourns his passing, his legacy will live on far into the future.
This will be disruptive to NJ's economy and I will continue to strongly oppose these efforts.

We must do better and work to ensure that our institutions protect the values that they were founded on.
I am extremely concerned that this confirmation will forever change the very nature of the Court. The Senate was entrusted with protecting the nonpartisan independence of the judiciary but instead they rushed through the process to confirm a political actor.
Anyone nominated to the highest court in the land should be held to an equally high standard. Both before he was nominated and throughout the confirmation process, Brett Kavanaugh displayed blatant partisan behavior unbefitting a Supreme Court Justice.
Dr. Ford deserved to have her story heard without prejudice and even though the FBI did not speak to her during their investigation, I commend her for all she has done for survivors of sexual assault.
Today’s vote confirming Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice was frustrating and disappointing. The vote happened without a thorough FBI investigation into numerous accusations of sexual assault.

The uncertain fate of Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein underscores the urgency with which Congress must #ProtectMueller. The Special Counsel’s investigation is not a partisan issue and I urge Speaker Ryan to bring legislation to protect the Mueller investigation to a vote immediately.
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to #DelaytheVote on Kavanaugh who is now facing multiple credible allegations of sexual misconduct.  This is a lifetime appointment and any claim of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.
This is a prime example of why victims choose not to report their attacks. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, there are resources available to you: https://t.co/s6rFfZyTyM https://t.co/Zox2EZtUyj
The President’s tweet dismissing Dr. Ford’s experience minimizes the real and long-lasting trauma that thousands of individuals suffer from. The rhetoric used by the President only reinforces the stigma victims face when coming forward.
Today on #POWMIADAY, we recognize those soldiers who have never returned home, while serving this country. The sacrifice that has been made will not be forgotten.

Happy Labor Day #NJ08. This Labor Day, we reflect on and remember the laborers past and present who fought for the workers rights that allow millions of us to #MakeItInAmerica.
@jimmymoralesgt @CICIGgt The work of @Ivan_Velasquez_ and his team is building a secure, prosperous future for Guatemala under the rule of law, not appalling corruption. My statement: https://t.co/8Euy1zMhxe
#Guatemala is made weaker by @jimmymoralesgt's unacceptable decision not to renew the mandate of @CICIGgt
For 29 years, my friend @RosLehtinen has been a model	public servant and inspiring hero for her community. Her impact as the 1st	Hispanic woman elected to Congress is immeasurable. She will be greatly missed as her time in Congress comes to an end.
55 years ago today, the March on Washington was only the beginning of our	fight for civil rights and justice in America. Together, we must continue the fight,	and work to advance legislation that ends discrimination and treats all	Americans as equals.

The Manafort guilty verdicts and Cohen plea deals show thatPresident Trump had no intention of keeping his promise to ‘drain the swamp’. He has done the exact opposite and enlarged the ‘swamp’ by surrounding himself with corrupt individuals.
My statement on this troubling pattern: https://t.co/OjcY8ROgAr
#ElSalvador’s decision to cut ties with democratic #Taiwan is simply alarming. #China’s continued economic encroachment in the Western Hemisphere is destroying shared democratic values between nations in favor of deceptive promises.
Democratic principles &amp; a commitment to human rights – not slashing zeroes off the #bolivar – are the only way forward.
Toying with inflation won’t end the starvation and suffering of the #Venezuelan people. The rot of corruption at the core of #Maduro’s regime is responsible for this crisis.
Aretha Franklin was an American icon who used her legendary voice to lift up the marginalized. In addition to creating timeless classics, she stood up to injustice and was a force in the civil rights movement. My thoughts today are with her family and loved ones.
John Brennan is a great American and this politically motivated attack shows that the President cares more about settling personal scores than protecting our national security.
Using presidential authority to retaliate against critics is a tool of despots and goes against the foundation of our democracy.  President Trump revoked John Brennan’s security clearance to punish him for exercising his First Amendment rights.
It created a safety net for seniors and the disabled that millions of hardworking Americans have paid into. As we celebrate #SocSec83, I will continue to fight for the principals enshrined in the Social Security Act.
This week marks the 83rd anniversary of the Social Security Act, a vital and historic piece of legislation signed into law on August 14, 1935.
The firing of FBI Agent Peter Strzok is already being used in political attempts to invalidate &amp; cripple the Special Counsel’s investigation. Americans deserve the truth which is why Congress must act to protect the investigation and ensure that it continues.
@maziehirono Good stuff Maxie.
The United States must continue to stand with the Venezuelan people and support their calls for a more democratic #Venezuela.
This alleged attack will be used by #Maduro to further consolidate his grip on power and justify a crackdown against his own people.
The recent “assassination attempt” against #Maduro is already being manipulated by him as a distraction from his regime’s oppression and corruption.
There should be no hesitation – printable plastic firearms would exacerbate an already rampant epidemic of gun violence. Guns, no matter what material they are made of, need to be regulated to save American lives.
The Trump Admin's proposal to roll back Obama's fuel efficiency and emissions standards is reckless and is another direct attack on New Jersey. Their logic for this proposal defies logic, and I will work in Congress to put a stop to it.
My colleagues and I wrote a letter to Sec Pompeo demanding a reversal and that he reinstate #TPS for these 400,000 individuals.
Their own State Department officials told them it would be disastrous – that these individuals may not be guaranteed protection returning to violent conflict. But the Trump Administration rescinded #TPS for Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Haitians anyway. https://t.co/yLlh58R4Qb
Proud to work with @RepEliotEngel @RosLehtinen @RepDavidValadao @NormaJTorres to restore, peace, security and the rule of law for millions of innocent people who’ve been oppressed. My statement: https://t.co/a7oXnOa12j
Today my colleagues and I urged the Administration to use the Global Magnitsky Act and hold individuals accountable for their role in transnational criminal organizations.
Outstanding news that Puerto Rico is raising the minimum wage to $15 for workers rebuilding badly needed infrastructure.  A testament to @ricardorossello’s investment in the future of the island and its people.
I look forward to working with my colleagues to explore how we can craft a fair and effective system that prevents sky rocketing costs from restricting care.
I firmly believe that everyone should have access to quality, affordable health care which is why I am a member of the newly formed Medicare for All Caucus.
I have been a proud cosponsor of H.R. 676, the Expanded &amp; Improved Medicare for All Act, since May 2017. Our health care system needs reform and this legislation would establish a national, single-payer health insurance program that builds on the existing Medicare program.
Instead they shot down the Secure Our Democracy Act, a bill I am proud to cosponsor, which increases sanctions on any individual guilty of tampering with our elections. When will the GOP take the integrity of our democracy seriously?  #ProtectOurDemocracy
House Republicans had the opportunity today to stand up for the American people and act on concerns about the future of our electoral system.  #ProtectOurDemocracy

Venezuela is crumbling under the oppression of Maduro. The world cannot abandon Venezuelans in their time of need. Proud to stand with my colleagues @RosLehtinen @RepPaulCook and @RepEliotEngel to introduce H.Res.1006, urging more action to resolve the #Venezuela crisis.
President Trump must immediately denounce any requests from foreign countries that place American citizens in danger, undermine our diplomatic corps, and seek to weaken our country on the international stage.
That any President would even consider turning an American citizen over to Russia for questioning is outrageous and dangerous.  Especially since Russia’s track record of human rights abuses is well documented.
Unlike the President, @McFaul is a true American patriot who shed light on Russia’s human rights abuses and did not yield to Putin’s intimidation and smear campaigns while he was our ambassador in Moscow.
By not instantly and unequivocally denying Russia’s nefarious request to interrogate American Ambassador @McFaul, President Trump is showing once again that he is Putin’s puppet.
We cannot forget the lessons of the 2017 hurricane season and must use our experience to prepare for this year. Today, I attended the Emergency Management Subcommittee hearing to receive updates on what FEMA administrators are doing to protect Americans for the upcoming season.

Scott Pruitt is gone and the EPA can finally start working on behalf of Americans’ health. Yet, Pruitt's last official act was a gift for polluters who want to skip current pollution standards and use old, super-polluting engines. This is unacceptable and Congress must address it
The world must turn its eyes to #Masaya &amp; #Monimbo where multiple reports show #Ortega paramilitary gangs holding anti-government protestors, including the parish priest, hostage inside a church. As #Nicaragua cries out for freedom, we cannot allow this dictator to crush them.
Pressure the White House to fully implement bipartisan sanctions we already passed last year. Demand the relevant committees draft up new ones. Americans are desperately waiting – our democracy needs defending.
Speaker Ryan, if you are truly concerned about the “menacing” actions of Russia: take action, you are not powerless. You are Speaker of the House, with a President of your own party in power.
My full statement: https://t.co/f8wuG42BXY
It’s Putin’s word vs the findings of US intelligence agencies, where brave Americans have greatly sacrificed to serve this country. President Trump has made it vastly clear who he sides with. His silence today speaks volumes and leaves our democracy vulnerable to future attacks.

I am relieved that Scott Pruitt has finally stepped down from his role as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. His continuous abuse of his office clearly proved that he was incapable of leading one of our nation’s most important agencies.
I wish everyone a safe and happy Independence Day with family and friends! Celebrate all the values our country strives to embody – inclusivity, resilience, and equality.
123 members and I demanded the Inspector General of each department involved in the zero tolerance policy to investigate &amp; report on each department’s ability to reunite these children with their parents, beginning official federal action to bring these families together
Along with @WhipHoyer and my @HispanicCaucus colleagues, we demanded an official report from Homeland Security, DOJ, or HHS on the status and well-being of every child separated under the zero tolerance policy, holding these agencies accountable for their actions
H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct would ban any Homeland Security, DOJ, or HHS official from removing children under 18 from their parents or legal guardians, unless the child is determined to be in danger
The fight against the Trump Admin.’s Zero Tolerance policy is ongoing. We will not let our country become a place that terrorizes families as a deterrent to seeking asylum. Here is what I am working on with my colleagues in Washington to #KeepFamiliesTogether:
After the tragic events yesterday, @capgaznews journalists continued working in the face of violence to provide their community with the news.  They are absolutely courageous. It is time for Congress to step up and finally end this American epidemic of gun violence.

#Janus attacks the very engine of growth for the middle class – unions. Workers’ ability to negotiate for fair wages, safe conditions, and secure retirement is fundamental to our economy. My full statement: https://t.co/DaQVHxZufa
Beyond maddening to hear a President of the U.S. disparage our justice system &amp; call for the end of immigration courts. Our nation was founded on the tenets of due process, fair trials, &amp; human rights. These aren’t inconveniences, they're the foundation of our nation’s strength.
As a nation we are currently facing many trying and critical issues, it is imperative that we move forward with civility at the forefront of debate during these pressing times.
Recent events illustrate just how bitter our nation's politics have become. It is extremely important that we raise the level of discourse and treat everyone with respect regardless of political party.

Encouraged to see 189 of my colleagues and many of my fellow New Jersey representatives join H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct. Seeking asylum is not illegal and does not deserve twisted punishment. We must stand up for the vulnerable in these critical times.
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 6135, the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, which would end the 'zero-tolerance' policy of the Trump Administration. Forced family separation is inhumane and un-American. My full statement: https://t.co/AfEMc77suw https://t.co/Ls3Seh4qh8
Outrageous that the House GOP and White House continue to shrug their shoulders at the separation crisis. When it has become our national policy to inflict unnecessary trauma on children and violate the rights of asylum seekers, inaction speaks volumes. #FamiliesBelongTogether

On Tuesday, my colleagues and I wrote to HHS Sec. Azar and detailed why #TitleX is so critical for millions of Americans. I will continue to push back against any moves by this Administration to restrict funding. #ProtectTitleX
Restricting #TitleX funding is a deeply partisan, ideological attack on affordable health care for women. A “gag rule” on providers who offer abortion services would block access to cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams and more for low-income women.

When the #GOPFarmBill cuts $23 billion out of SNAP funding, they’re shaving dollar &amp; pennies off the little assistance recipients have. If the GOP really wants to help working families get ahead, they’ll grapple with the reality of SNAP and stop trading in dangerous stereotypes.
Throwing stricter work requirements on jobs that may already be vulnerable or unstable and wasting their time with job training programs is destructive. It prevents recipients from getting home, receiving the food they need, and keeping their families fed. #GOPFarmBill
The GOP would like to paint a picture of a luxury food assistance program that keeps Americans out of the workforce. The reality of SNAP is that the vast majority of adults who are required to work, do work, and are struggling to support their families. #GOPFarmBill
- The average SNAP recipient only receives $132/month. 	- The average family on SNAP spends just 10 months in the program. 	- 2/3 of SNAP recipients are children, elderly, or the disabled.

America is done waiting for our infrastructure to enter the 21st century, and our nation’s workers are ready to get started. Today, I discussed the critical need for federal investment in infrastructure with a number of groups from diverse industries:
Four months later, the #GOPTaxScam is showing its true colors. Meanwhile, American families desperately wait for real legislation that puts their priorities first &amp; actually delivers more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks.
“Bigger paychecks” – 87% of Fortune 500 companies have announced no plans to share their tax cuts with employees https://t.co/k3CbQaqpox #GOPTaxScam
“Fairer taxes” – The richest Americans are receiving $51,140 in tax breaks, while the poorest are only receiving $60, according to the Tax Policy Center  https://t.co/Dz6Mj5olLr #GOPTaxScam
“More jobs” - A survey by the National Foreign Trade Council found that 4 out of 5 employers don’t expect to hire more American workers or pay bonuses. https://t.co/4m3usXzmAF #GOPTaxScam
On December 15th, when the conference report on the tax bill was released, Speaker Ryan announced, “This is what the American people have been waiting for: more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks.” In honor of #TaxDay, let’s check in on these promises:
The GOP called their tax plan a “middle class miracle” that would lift up the US economy. Now we know this scam only paid lip service to middle &amp; working class families, while giving away over $250 billion in corporate stock buyback schemes to executives: https://t.co/eNHXdlXAh8
Last week, I called for Pruitt’s resignation or firing from the President and continue to call on my colleagues in both parties to do the same.
Continued revelations about Scott Pruitt’s behavior confirm the obvious: he must resign. The GAO has now found that his private lair inside the EPA was an egregious misuse of taxpayer funds. https://t.co/lE9G6r6qfs
We cannot let radical political influences shut science out of the public arena. My colleagues &amp; I demand that Speaker Ryan allow us to vote on the Scientific Integrity Act, which would set standards across federal agencies for scientific credibility in public policy. https://t.co/51LTiKEgDb

Step 1: Drain federal funds for handouts to the 1%. Step 2: Realize your plan explodes the deficit by $1.9 trillion. Step 3: Attack Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid to cover up your mistake. Even GOP Sen. Bob Corker knows this “balanced budget amendment” is a dangerous sham. https://t.co/KnZobzPiG2
A foolish, politically-motivated citizenship question on the census could actually risk billions in federal funding for law enforcement, fire, and safety units due to inaccurate numbers. I joined my CHC colleagues in requesting a meeting with Sec. Ross on this issue. https://t.co/cSC9YLaQCJ
Proud to highlight communities in #NJ08 that were named Qualified Opportunity Zones by @USTreasury. Elizabeth, Kearny, Bayonne, Newark, Jersey City, West New York, &amp; Union City have all received tax incentives to spur long-term capital investments &amp; increase economic development.
We are reminded on #HolocaustRemembranceDay each year that we must passionately fight for peace over hate time and time again. We can never forget the millions of innocent lives lost. #YomHashoah

#Trump’s latest attacks on Mr. Mueller’s investigation threaten the very integrity of our democracy. Every Member should be alarmed at POTUS’ open threats to fire Mueller &amp; speak out against this flagrant assault on the rule of law. This demands action from Congress.
Yesterday’s updated report from the CBO shows that the GOP’s tax plan will explode the national deficit by $1.9 trillion over the next decade. Republicans claimed this bill would grow the economy, but instead it will place a massive financial burden on future generations. https://t.co/VF5hguqw47
While #Trump obsesses over his corruption scandals and wastes time getting his briefings from watching TV all day, the US is abdicating its role on the world stage.

#6MonthsAfterMaria Puerto Rico has shamefully still not received adequate help from the federal government. This was an historic disaster requiring an historic response. Our response in Puerto Rico should have been as rapid and intense as our response in Florida and Texas.

Celebrating #PublicSchoolsWeek is a reminder of the value that public schools bring to our country. Committing ourselves to equal access to quality public education is the best investment our nation can make.
In 2016, @ASCETweets graded infrastructure in the US as a D+.

#Tillerson’s dismissal is a sad reminder of #Trump’s contempt for diplomacy. Removing SecState while our country faces aggression from the likes of North Korea and Russia, displays yet again that the President values personal politics over the nation’s best interests.
Thank you to @Defenders for a 100% on their 2017 Conservation Report Card. Proud to work in Congress to protect our natural heritage for future American generations.
#InternationalWomensDay is a reminder for me and my colleagues in Congress that we cannot rest until full gender equality is realized in our country.
The important work of @Ivan_Velasquez_ and the @CICIGgt must be protected and allowed to continue. The rule of law must be strengthened in #Guatemala and corruption must be weeded out at every turn. Proud to meet Ivan with my colleagues @RepPaulCook &amp; @RosLehtinen https://t.co/brIVTwKUrS

Proud to stand up for Net Neutrality, and be an original cosponsor of the H.J.Res 129. This resolution is Congress’ chance to restore important Title II protections and stand against the FCC’s decision last year. https://t.co/nSkVA3r5Nt
Somehow the federal budget for Housing &amp; Urban Development doesn’t have enough room for Community Development Block Grants, but we magically have money for a new dining room table? Secretary Carson’s actions are despicable.
Standing today with my House &amp; Senate colleagues for the introduction of our #NetNeutrality CRA, it is clear that we have the momentum to overturn the @FCC’s disastrous decision from two months ago. The Senate needs just #OneMoreVote to preserve Net Neutrality &amp; #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/qvAYiKHoJ2
RT @RepDonaldPayne: Yesterday, @RepSires and I wrote to @GovMurphy , urging him to replace outdated pre-2007 diesel trucks at the Port Newa…
In the coming weeks, I plan on addressing even more aspects of the gun violence epidemic with my colleagues. This most recent mass shooting in Florida can be the last. Congress has not only the power, but the duty to act now.
H.R. 4052, Keep Americans Safe Act, prohibits the transfer or possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices that hold greater than ten rounds. Large capacity magazines have been central to so many of these tragic mass shooting and have often increased their deadliness.
H.Res. 370, titled Moments of Silence Are Not Enough, ties displays of sincerity to action. The House would be required to follow any moment of silence held for a tragedy involving gun violence with a committee hearing on the issue within 10 legislative days.
H.R. 3947, the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, bans the creation, possession, transfer, or sale of bump stocks and other firearm accessories that convert semi-automatic guns to fully automatic. There is no reason this vicious loophole should be open any longer.
H.R. 3962, the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2017, requires any individual who orders ammunition online to verify their identification in person with a licensed dealer. The bill would also require vendors to report exceptionally large sales to the U.S. Attorney General.
When I return to Washington on Monday, I will continue to demand that Speaker Ryan bring up legislation immediately to address the epidemic of gun violence in America. There are a number of bills I have cosponsored along with my colleagues that we can begin consideration of:
Emergency Migration and Refugee Assistance is cruelly eliminated in the #TrumpBudget, along with a 17% cut to remaining Migration and Refugee Assistance Accounts, continuing a pattern of targeting some of the most vulnerable populations in the world
#TrumpBudget includes a $3 billion loss in humanitarian assistance, 23% cut to global health funding, and 20% cut to PEPFAR, the president’s emergency plan to fight AIDS
After a disastrous year on the global stage, the Trump Administration still does not heed bipartisan calls to change directions on foreign affairs. #TrumpBudget learns nothing from their mistakes &amp; wants to slash International Affairs Budget by 30%
#TrumpBudget plays favorites with the education budget, decreasing Dept. of Education by $3.6 billion, but instituting $1.5 billion for private school voucher programs. Destabilizing our public education, a bedrock of our democracy, just to boost private and charter schools
#TrumpBudget continues this Administration’s vengeance against environmental protections. EPA loses 25% of its funding under the plan.
#Russia attacked our democracy and they will attack again. In light of today’s serious indictments by Special Counsel #Mueller, President Trump must enforce bipartisan sanctions against Russia for the sake of our electoral system. My statement: https://t.co/RbbWlh5NiN
February is #AmericanHeartMonth. Learn more about how you can take preventative measures such as stress management and healthy eating: https://t.co/K8Sh3VNJqa
The only real infrastructure action in the #TrumpBudget is asking state and local governments to shoulder the costs of a grand plan. This long-awaited package is half-baked at best.
Amtrak grants get the chop in #TrumpBudget, down to $738 million down from $1.5 billion in FY17
#TrumpBudget merely points out that the Highway Trust Fund, which funds the restoration of our roads, will run out of money by FY2023. Yet, it does not offer any solutions.
#TrumpBudget slashes the Department of Transportation’s discretionary spending by 19.2%, from $19.3 billion to $15.6 billion, crippling chances of even securing the infrastructure we already have
President Trump has dreams of a grand transformation of our nation’s infrastructure, but when it comes to the #TrumpBudget it’s clear his Administration isn’t serious at all
My heart breaks for the 17 innocent lives lost yesterday in Parkland.  It is a national tragedy that Congress has yet to enact comprehensive gun reform legislation in the face of these senseless shootings. I call on Speaker Ryan to act now: https://t.co/33y3gEUyi1
This morning, I attended a Subcommittee on Railroads &amp; Pipelines hearing on the continuing process of installing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology in the US. Passenger safety depends on the future of PTC &amp; we cannot delay the process any longer.
The Organization for American States can do more to promote democracy &amp; human rights for Latin America. Today’s Western Hemisphere Subcommittee examined how the US can further work with @OAS_official to address its challenges &amp; foster its important leadership for the region.

The HOME Investment Partnership Program is the largest federal block grant to states designed exclusively to build affordable housing for low-income households. Gutting it attacks the backbone of our nation’s efforts to address housing inequality #TrumpBudget
Community Development Block Grants are also central to the funding of Meals on Wheels. #TrumpBudget would leave the program in crisis.
Community Development Block Grants are the indispensable, flexible tool for local governments to execute projects as ordinary as sidewalk repairs and as critical as emergency response. CDBG was vital for NJ’s response to Hurricane Sandy. #TrumpBudget cuts them entirely.
#TrumpBudget apparently believes that housing isn’t a problem for millions of Americans &amp; eliminates Community Development Block Grants, the HOME Investment Partnership Program, &amp; the Low Income Energy Assistance Program
#TrumpBudget risks pushing vulnerable families into homelessness and further burdens those already experiencing homelessness. In addition to cutting the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development by 14%, it cruelly eliminates funding for repairs to public housing.
The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant helps keep families together and prepares low-income parents with job training. #TrumpBudget slashes TANF grant by $1.7 billion in just one year.
Since his days on the campaign trail, President Trump has long promised a bold, aggressive, state-of-the art infrastructure package. Unfortunately, the plan his Administration unveiled yesterday is a certified lemon. My statement: https://t.co/Pdighu4PSF
In addition, #TrumpBudget even weakens what would be left of Medicaid. Imposing work requirements and substituting block grants for funding would effectively choke the program’s reach. This is simply not a plan that seeks to help vulnerable patients and their families in any way.
#TrumpBudget carries the mantle of this administration’s vicious attack on health care, cutting ACA cost-sharing reduction payments that help low-income patients pay for out-of-pocket costs and issuing a devastating $554 billion cut to Medicare and $250 billion cut to Medicaid
And would there even be enough money to fill the box? #TrumpBudget reduces the SNAP program by $17.2 billion in one year and $213.5 billion over 10 years. There is no awareness of how important this program is to vulnerable American families.
After one Trump Administration contract barely delivered 0.02% of promised meals to Puerto Rico, I have trouble putting faith in the President’s idea of converting SNAP into a box delivery service #TrumpBudget
The #TrumpBudget both undermines protections for the middle class and openly attacks the elderly and vulnerable
I am proud to see NJ step up to help Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria and will continue to fight for hurricane victims through my work in DC.
Here in DC, I joined the successful fight to block FEMA’s premature end of food and water distribution on the island and worked with my colleagues to secure additional federal funding for schools that take in displaced students.
Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico over 5 months ago, but full relief has yet to be delivered and a return to normalcy seems tragically far away. Yesterday, I spoke at @GovMurphy’s signing of EO #10, creating a commission to assist the 30,000 displaced Puerto Ricans in NJ. https://t.co/GlKCb3i4ks
Parades won’t fund health clinics for servicemembers or programs that help disabled veterans adjust to civilian life. Let’s really celebrate our military, and not dump millions and millions down the drain on an expensive #militaryparade when we have real problems to fix.
I stand firmly with my friends @RosLehtinen &amp; @RepEliotEngel. The rule of law must prevail in #Guatemala &amp; @CICIGGt Commissioner Ivan Velasquez must be allowed to freely continue his important work. The United States strongly stands behind Commissioner Velasquez. #IvanSeQueda https://t.co/fE2PsBpGCW
Each year, I ask appropriators to robustly fund our Community Health Centers because I know how critical they are to New Jersey families. Today, I sat down with Metropolitan Family Health Network to learn more about the most important issues facing health care centers today. https://t.co/W1dOSGjvWb
I sat down this afternoon with members of #AICUNJ, including Dr. Eugune Cornacchia, President of my alma mater @saintpetersuniv, to discuss legislative priorities for higher education in New Jersey. https://t.co/IqPprr2YB9
Met with Capt. Felix Pacheo III of Hudson County, who is in DC on behalf of the National Narcotics Officers Association Coalition, to discuss his important work in law enforcement and keeping our communities safe. https://t.co/4qO0F2BYLP
Sat down with @NationalDefense to discuss the Arsenal at @Picatinny_NJ and its importance to New Jersey’s economy and technology sector. https://t.co/KlbRlUp1wa
At today’s @HFACDemocrats hearing I took the opportunity to ask why this Administration refuses to do what is needed to stop Russian interference in our elections and how the US can guard our elections from future attacks. https://t.co/rdMSgwI2wh
Rescinding TPS does nothing but further attack vulnerable immigrant communities in the United States. This morning, I met with NJ members of @TPS_Alliance to discuss legislation regarding TPS designations. https://t.co/ePzl4cD2bv
FBI leadership’s opposition to the release of GOP memo portraying factual inaccuracies reaffirms the document as a threat not only to sources important for national security, but also to the integrity of the ongoing probe by the special counsel
Thinking of all my colleagues, the other passengers, and everyone involved in today’s tragic train accident in Virginia. Hoping all those at the scene remain safe.
The President’s speech last night included exactly what was expected. Equation of immigrants to criminals, hollow promises on infrastructure, and a promotion of policies that will hurt American workers. My statement: https://t.co/qMy4UIvECW
Tonight I will be on @NJTVNews @Telemundo @News12NJ &amp; @CNNEspanol discussing my decision to not attend the State of the Union. I hope the President comes to understand that we want a leader who stands up for every American.
The 8th District is home to thousands of immigrants, myself included. We will not stand for this extreme rhetoric and behavior that erodes the office of the President and our nation’s values.
This past year, I’ve heard repeatedly from my constituents about the vitriol coming from this President directed at immigrants. It is not normal and simply unjustifiable.
Today #WeRemember how quickly hatred and prejudice can grow into injustice and tragedy. On this International Holocaust Remembrance Day let us honor the memories of the victims and commit ourselves to never letting history repeat itself.
122 American DREAMers lose their status every day during the #TrumpShutdown, uprooting their lives and opening them up to unimaginable deportations
The 9 million children who are insured under the CHIP program will continue to be held in political limbo during the #TrumpShutdown
Federally-funded health centers have to put their life-saving work on pause because of the #TrumpShutdown
During the #TrumpShutdown, our military will go without pay and the Pentagon will be in the dark about its future spending
#TrumpShutdown is the result of irresponsible governing. Playing games with our national budget has serious consequences.
I have always been willing to work with my colleagues and will continue to do so. We already have bipartisan solutions to the problems we face and legislation ready for a vote. When will the #GOP – the governing party – finally come to the table?
The Pentagon desperately needs certainty for their budgeting. Our military cannot live and die by every four week scuffle that Congress coughs up. National security depends on long-term planning and stability.
The Republicans have owned both chambers of Congress and the White House for an entire year and have yet to provide a budget for our government. What is taking them so long? #TrumpShutdown
For months, we have urged the #GOP to work with us to fund the government and avoid this #TrumpShutdown. Now time has run out, and we are being asked to support another short-term CR that ensures more chaos and confusion for our government.
I’m here in DC ready to fund our military, protect 800,000 Americans, fully support Community Health Centers, &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown. We already have bipartisan commitments to fix these problems and legislation that is ready to go. Waiting on GOP leadership to keep their word. https://t.co/KlkMzz9ErR
Here in Washington and at home in New Jersey, however, we will not back down. Into the new year, I will continue to fight for all New Jerseyans.
4) Repeatedly tried to strip away health insurance for over 900,000 vulnerable New Jerseyans by repealing the Affordable Care Act
3) Torched protections for the colossally important Jersey Shore, opening it up to dangerous and potentially disastrous offshore drilling projects
2) Waffled on his Administration’s commitment to the seriously important Gateway Tunnel project in Newark, potentially killing the huge economic boost it would provide to the region
1) Gutted the federal state and local tax deduction &amp; increased the share NJ residents pay in federal income tax, all in a state that already disproportionately sends more money to Washington than it receives in services
Today is not only the beginning of the #TrumpShutdown, but the one year anniversary of this Administration. In honor of this eventful year, here’s a look back on what exactly President Trump has delivered for New Jersey:
Due to the #TrumpShutdown federally funded agencies are preparing pink slips to go out to employees.  The chaos of the White House and the GOP has put critical services that millions rely on, like health care, at risk.
Proud that my bipartisan bill with Rep. @MarioDB, the Global Health Innovation Act of 2017, passed the House last night by a vote of 423-3. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/N0rmfHTkig

We were not elected to kick the can down the road over and over again on issues for the American people. We were elected to come together and govern.
DREAMers are Americans. They do not deserve to have their lives hang in the balance due to political games. Today I met with NJ DACA recipients and @MakeTheRoadNJ to listen to their stories &amp; discuss legislative solutions. https://t.co/q1I0dLX0D6

In honor of Martin Luther King, Jr,’s birthday, the National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks today
The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspires Americans each and every day to pursue the course of justice, even when it appears most treacherous. Today let us remember his tireless work pursuing equality and all that is still to be done.
Congratulations to @APSuperREP on his appointment to NJ Education Commissioner. After his outstanding work as superintendent of Asbury Park, New Jersey’s future will be in great hands.
It is disgusting that the President of the United States has no regard for American values or the immigrant experience. His comments are downright insulting to countless American families like mine and others in the 8th District, who have worked hard to build new lives in the US https://t.co/bC9JspN5i4
Electoral integrity was the subject of today’s Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing that I attended. Free and fair elections in the region are critical for not only the security of our country, but the progress of human rights throughout the world. https://t.co/GpgdEuZNVM
Time has passed since hurricanes devastated Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands, but help is still urgently needed. Met with @1199SEIU and @1199SEIU_NJ today to discuss what Congress must do to help the health care crisis currently facing hurricane victims. https://t.co/FKNLEPTb3j
With recent events in North Korea, Russia, &amp; Venezuela, we have turned to sanctions as a tool to protect our national security interests. Today, I attended a @HFACDemocrats hearing on how effective these sanctions have been and what measures the U.S. has previously pursued.
Declaring El Salvador too violent to visit, but at the same time ending TPS protections for the Salvadoran parents of 190,000 American children. This Administration’s current TPS policy is cruel and unnecessary #SaveTPS https://t.co/o9Z9yoP6bu
If Florida can get an exemption from this offshore drilling proposal, so should NJ. I’m joining a bipartisan group of my NJ colleagues to send a letter to Sec. Zinke demanding that he protect our shoreline and the nearly $45 billion in revenue it brings to our state every year. https://t.co/AWkQqyJcA2
I have trouble believing that Pres. Trump, a former Atlantic City business owner, doesn’t understand how important the shore is to the Jersey economy. Opening all U.S. waters to offshore drilling was foolish from the start, but now they want to play favorites &amp; give exemptions?
These individuals will lose their livelihoods, and New Jersey will lose the $448.3 million these Salvadoran residents generate in annual state GDP. Far more seriously, 3,900 American children in New Jersey now stand to lose their parents #SaveTPS
The 200,000 Salvadorans that the President targeted yesterday were forced from their country by devastating earthquakes. Now, they are being forced to give up the stable lives they’ve built here &amp; return to a still-recovering nation dealing with serious systemic violence #SaveTPS
The decision to end TPS is politically motivated and extremely reckless. Salvadorans who receive Temporary Protected Status are taxpaying residents of the United States, have passed multiple background checks, and are productive members of their communities #SaveTPS
January marks the 126th anniversary of Ellis Island, a proud landmark of the 8th District. For 12 million people, Ellis Island was their first step on to American shores. Today, let us celebrate the island’s importance to American history and our legacy as a nation of immigrants

Happy New Year #NJ08!
The anniversary of the Clean Air Act is a reminder of how we must fight for the protection of our planet to secure the health of our future generations
#DidYouKnow today in 1973 the Endangered Species Act was signed into law? Safeguarding our environment and fortifying our own health begins with protecting endangered and threatened species.
Americans loudly opposed the GOP tax plan by a 2-to-1 margin, and somehow this is cause for a White House celebration? House GOP needs to get back to work.
Celebrating a tax plan where 83% of the benefits will only go to the richest 1% of Americans is ridiculous. Doing so while CHIP remains unfunded and our government nears a shutdown is downright shameful.
Today’s tax bill re-vote underscores what a sloppy, rushed process this has been. Real tax reform is not just a talking point, but delivers meaningful, lasting change for American families. Not special deductions for the rich.
Read why I voted No on the GOP tax plan: https://t.co/XCcBWGWsRa https://t.co/V4Yt6ikP4Z
Carved out benefits for private jets &amp; permanent reductions in the corporate tax rate. The House GOP has just gifted the wealthiest Americans an unbelievable Christmas present, and paid for it by blowing up our national debt.
My statement: https://t.co/72B0eCFjR8 https://t.co/UzX2ddfLZV
Because of the GOP leadership’s unwillingness to repair DACA, 12,641 DREAMers have lost their status, throwing their lives into chaos. As a cosponsor of the bipartisan Dream Act, I have been working with my colleagues to support a clean passage of this necessary legislation.

11,912 #DACA recipients have lost their status since the program ended. We need a clean #DreamActNow. It is irresponsible &amp; immoral that we would leave our nation’s young people with this burden. Today, I met with a group of DREAMers to listen to their stories. https://t.co/IVFuLGuRlA

I will continue to push for these measures that especially affect our nation's young people, and work with my colleagues to pass a stable, long term budget.
Short term stop-gap funding is no way to govern or deliver solutions for American citizens. Keeping our gov't open is an obvious objective, but bipartisan priorities like passing a clean Dream Act &amp; reauthorizing CHIP absolutely must be addressed before the end of the fiscal year

Americans loudly rejected the Republican’s awful attempt at health care reform. Why are they now using the #GOPTaxScam to again increase the burden of medical costs on those already suffering?
Tonight, our fight against the #GOPTaxScam does not end. We cannot allow a plan that raises taxes on 82 million Americans, kicks 13 million Americans off health care, &amp; adds $1.7 trillion to the debt to burden our country.
When the wealthiest Americans will receive 52 times the tax breaks of middle class families, it’s no secret who the #GOPTaxScam is designed to benefit

The #GOPtaxbill is another appalling attack on affordable, quality health care by the GOP
@WaysandMeansGOP Our tax code should be crafted to help the millions of Americans who will need this deduction in the future to help rebuild their lives
@WaysandMeansGOP The cruel #GOPtaxbill would kill this deduction even as Americans are recovering from devastating hurricanes &amp; wildfires in recent months
@WaysandMeansGOP Current tax law provides a deduction for damages &amp; property losses sustained from natural disasters.

Happy #HispanicHeritageMonth! May it be a time of learning &amp; celebration of all that Hispanic Americans have contributed to our society.
Premiums for autism, asthma, and pregnancy would soar under #GrahamCassidy. This is a thoughtless, heartless approach to health care.
#GrahamCassidy would let states turn back the clock on pre-existing conditions. We cannot allow this bill to become law.
Cutting Medicaid funds is not a solution for health care. Instead, it’s a cruel burden to place on working class Americans &amp; their children
If the Senate GOP wants to help lower premiums for Americans, why introduce #GrahamCassidy, which would cause premiums to skyrocket?
The Senate GOP calls this a serious health care bill, but won’t even wait for a CBO score to see its true impact #GrahamCassidy
#GrahamCassidy is the most disastrous version of #Trumpcare the Senate GOP has offered so far
For those who would like to donate to Puerto Rico’s disaster recovery efforts, please visit https://t.co/A49xlZIH6a
To all those celebrating Rosh Hashanah, Shana Tovah!
#GrahamCassidy breaks any promise we as members of Congress have made to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans
Block grants, the core of this bill, would punish states that chose to provide for their citizens &amp; expand Medicaid under ACA
Coverage for pre-existing conditions becomes optional. An indefensible policy to allow. #GrahamCassidy
900,000 New Jerseyans could lose their coverage #GrahamCassidy
New Jersey would lose $10 billion in federal funding for health care #GrahamCassidy

Repealing #HCR would increase the number of uninsured in the 13th District by 104,000 http://bit.ly/dFdGZc
Today I voted against repealing health care reform http://bit.ly/dFdGZc #HCR
If #HCR was repealed, new plans would no longer be required to cover preventative services, like mammograms + flu shots, w/out cost sharing.
If #HCR was repealed, 326,000 in NJ would not know if they are receiving value for their health insurance premium dollars.
If #HCR was repealed, 166 NJ employers would not be receiving help from the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program.
If #HCR was repealed, insurance companies could cut off insurance due to a single mistake on an application-326,000 in NJ  would be at risk.
Please join us at 11am EST in the nationwide moment of silence to honor @Rep_Giffords, her staff and the other victims of this tragedy
103,905 people on Medicare in NJ would see significantly higher prescription drug costs if #HCR was repealed.
If #HCR  was repealed, 27,800 young adults in NJ would lose their insurance coverage through their parents' health plans.
This Congress I am focused on job creation, our transportation systems, and livable communities. What issues are important to you?
If #HCR was repealed, Medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup. Nearly 1.3 m NJ seniors would have to pay extra to stay healthy
Repealing #HCR would mean  nearly 1.3 million NJ seniors who have Medicare would be forced to pay a copay for preventative services.
Just sworn in to the 112th Congress-- looking forward to serving the 13th District!
Repealing #HCR would mean nearly 5 million New Jerseyans would again be vulnerable to lifetime limits on what health insurers will pay.
