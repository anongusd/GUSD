@Parents4Privacy @leoniehaimson Foreign exchge different area of law than migrant students,different area than immigration status-3 different things 2of3 can b part of data
@leoniehaimson @r_stickland @DianeRavitch Nothing to do with their immigration status

@Parents4Privacy @leoniehaimson https://t.co/C9kNqMFEXl
@Parents4Privacy @leoniehaimson So in addition to whether or not a family is eligible 4 migrant funding, one could also make point re whether student is exchange student
@Parents4Privacy @leoniehaimson Foreign exchange students have F-1 visas and there generally needs to be funding for them from a host government or NGO
@Parents4Privacy @leoniehaimson This section is about foreign exchange students not immigrants.

@stryanDB For those of us who believe we should provide home for far more Syrian refugees (I have called for at least 100,000 by end of 2016
@jayhawkjack certainly not what they told me
@Greeblehaus @HKoren The vetting process is strong already, SAFE Act makes it stronger, adds congressional oversight without slowing it down
@HKoren  I support both allowing more Syrian refugees to come here and better vetting	https://t.co/ZMC8IRkIEC
@stryanDB it's not about polls, it's about common sense. We should let more Syrian refugees in and improve our screening
@stryanDB I support us accepting more refugees as well as improvements to the already strong vetting process
