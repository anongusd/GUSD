@CurtisAkers_ Warm weather team similar to dome teams. And hence the to 2002.
@CurtisAkers_ Your team plays in a dome. They don‚Äôt play well in the cold. What‚Äôs dumb about that? 1999-2002 Bucs same problem.
@CurtisAkers_ I‚Äôm trying to help you find an excuse.
@CurtisAkers_ Cold changes field, harder to dig in with clears to block. Harder for receivers to pivot and turn on routes. Muscles collide differently and stiffen. Wind alters football trajectory in passes. Cmon you know I gots more reasons than chilly players.
@CurtisAkers_ lm trying to figure out how one of the worst defenses did that to the mighty Colts. Must be the chilly temps
@CurtisAkers_ Fair analysis. Excited to see how a team that plays indoors ever does well in winter weather.

Refresher on the 94th- (R) Yancey won initial vote by 13. (D) Simonds won by 1 vote in recount. Recount official had concerns on a contested ballot. Judges gave ballot to Yancey. Tie. Board of elections drew name from film canisters. Yancey winner
In the 94th-Both camps have looked at legal options in the past based on this potential outcome. We are asking (Simonds) that now
Yancey‚Äôs name is drawn from bowl. Balance of power in Richmond goes to Republicans. 51-49. But this may not be the end-waiting on response from Simond‚Äôs camp https://t.co/tkmAxjoY1F

@M5B1tch @Eric3653 @ijspurcell @cardinals150 That‚Äôs not entirely accurate. Many of the ballots counted in the recount were of similar nature. I.e attempting to discern what the voter intended.

@maxbballin1 How long did that take?
#nonnewstweet you know it‚Äôs that time of the year when dad shows his true colors https://t.co/HY3yGCpn21
That line through was the key to turning this to a Yancey vote-according to judge panel https://t.co/tBFYXOu03W
Here you go. This is the ballot in question. This turned the 94th into tie https://t.co/FaBIXbSE3X
@npwaugh Really!??
Waiting for decision by board of elections https://t.co/mV2tRjKZvu
Or a coin toss https://t.co/27QSEWFKaM
For those of you wondering-these elections laws can date back years. Hence the legal terms ‚Äúdrawing lots‚Äù
@malinafoldesi Likely decided by chance
The decision on what ‚Äúdrawing lots‚Äù will mean goes to the state board of elections. Precedent has been set for a coin toss in Richmond. 1st time a recount has been overturned attorneys say
@dbloom 3 judge panel doesn‚Äôt reveal their party lines. Unanimous decision
@ShotgunWillard @kesayers Actually it can be determined as straws, name out of hat or coin toss
How to decide 94th district goes to state board of elections
Deliberation took 2 hours. Decision was unanimous of 3 judge panel. Ballot appeared-to the judges-to be a vote for Yancey.
3 judge panel agrees rules single ballot is a vote for Yancey. 94th district is tied.
Clerk is getting the ballot now. Judges will review. Attorneys will argue. Then a decision will be made that will have a huge impact on Virginia politics.
Judges rules they will review the contested ballot. Election official believes it to be a Yancey vote. If judges rule it is-this race would then be a tie.
There is a ballot in question in the Simonds vs. Yancey election. 3 judge panel deciding whether or not to review it. Would have been a Yancey vote. Judges deliberating now
@alexis_morrell @WAVY_News Let‚Äôs go SSPP!
Final count-Shelly Simonds 11,608 to Del. David Yancey‚Äôs 11,607
One vote put Shelly Simonds over the top in Newport News changed the balance of power in Richmond. More at 430
Not official but numbers going to court from recount will be Shelly Simonds winning by ONE vote.
@INDOT_WCentral @WTHITV Man-3 years after I leave.
From absentee there is 1 for Yancey and 1 for Simonds. She‚Äôs in the lead with only the envelope of provisionals left.
Final vote counts coming up. Simonds still up by 1, so far. https://t.co/P49e2Ivrja
Now some confusion over recounting of provisional ballots. Meanwhile election team is wrapping up absentee recount.
Now absentees and provisional ballots being looked at. But Shelly Simonds for the first time today overtook incumbent Del. David Yancey. In lead by 1-that‚Äôs right-1 vote.
Last precinct added 1 vote to Simonds. For now it looks like she is in the lead. First time she has over taken Del. Yancey today.
Ok now there has been another change and the vote numbers are tied. One precinct and absentees.
The balance of power in the House of Delegates could rest on 1 vote. Btw this isn‚Äôt official.  Just the running tally https://t.co/E5wO3sq1u7
Now they are checking it and saying it is 2 more votes for Simonds. In other words this election is separated by 1 vote.
Now there is a discussion of it was plus 3 for Simonds or not. Dont hold your breath. May not be a tie
Now it‚Äôs tied
3 precincts left and the lead is down to 4 for Del. Yancey
Down to 4 vote Yancey lead. Last check.
Attorneys for Democrats and Republicans arguing. Told by election officials to keep it down
I don‚Äôt know if I have understated it-but 6 votes could sway the power in Richmond. From a Republican general assembly to divided government.
Now Yancey lead down to 6. With 1 ballot being looked at. 6 precincts to go. Coming down the home stretch
A quick reminder-don‚Äôt go near the ballots https://t.co/Q27ryYJeKo
Here‚Äôs the stakes: if Del. Yancey keeps lead-the Va. House of Delegates stays in Republican Control. If Simonds wins-it‚Äôs a 50-50 toss up.
A handful of precincts left to recount and incumbent David Yancey holds a 7 vote lead over challenger Shelly Simonds.
Del. Yancey picks up 3 votes. Challenger Simonds picks up 6. Yancey lead Down to 7 vote margin with more precincts to go. Lead started day at 10 for Yancey. https://t.co/BzjhAtqJmL
David Yancey and Shelley Simonds pick up a vote. So far +5 in the recount from Simonds.
Once again not official. There are many precincts left to count
Challenger Shelly Simonds has picked up 5 votes so far. Gap with David Yancey was 10
4 precincts recounted Simonds picks up 4 votes *this is not an official record*
*this is not official* but with one district complete election officials marked +2 simonds https://t.co/fEPyolQdzd
Machine goes through roughly 300 votes a minute. Between 200-250 votes total will need to be hand counted. Viewed as irregular votes. Total cost to lease machines is $15000

All the votes waiting to be re-counted https://t.co/nY00fXYyz9
Right now the Electoral board is dividing up all the ballots. Several precincts are split into multiple districts. So the board has to remove the 93rd and 95th ballots. So they are only counting the 94th. https://t.co/cHY2tMKtC6

@medbarth T Jeff is a big Burr detractor. Not a fan
@medbarth There are many reputable. Considering most records on Hamilton and Jefferson come from themselves.
@medbarth Fallen founder did. Milton Lomask as well. Fleming on the duel. American emperor. The list is extensive. I have an aggregate viewpoint
@medbarth I've only read duel histories for a year. And Burr biographies. It's my only hobby.
@medbarth Other letters say reserve and possibly wait again on a second
@medbarth Don't you miss this??
@medbarth He was found not guilty in 2 separate trials. And technically that "overt" ruling keeps ppl who are speak ill of the gov from going to jail
@medbarth Burr was acquired bc no evidence showed him committing treason. He did however have plans to do what Sam Houston did 30 years later.
@medbarth Which a smooth bored gun with a hair spring trigger would have caused to go wild. Why shoot at all-if you said you wouldn't shoot.
@medbarth The two were at the nadir of their careers. I think both had deep depression
@medbarth Hamilton would "reserve his shot.;twice" When he fired his 2nd couldn't explain it. The guns chosen were Hamiltons. Used by his son Philip.
@medbarth I've been on a Burr kick since college. Forgotten hero
@medbarth It better not be because of that play... where he left out Hamilton installed a quick trigger in his gun to get a jump on Burr
@medbarth GW who burned all correspondence that painted him in an unfavorable light. Hamilton who proposed Federalist secession. Give Burr a chance!
@medbarth Also his chief accuser of treason was a general who was Spanish agent 13. Acquitted
@medbarth Or-pushed to expand the right to vote-women's suffrage and immediate abolition of slavery. And saved Hamilton's life during the revolution
