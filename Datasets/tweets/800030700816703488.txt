@KTHopkins maybe its time to hop into bosts and conquer other peoples land again. would that cheer you up?
@peterdaou the day they overlooked his mocking of the reporter and received hardly any severe backlash from msm, was the day i realised trump can say or do anything.

@itsJeffTiedrich i think the fact msm is reporting on trumps holiday to vietnam for a few days instead of the jaw dropping accusations by cohen means trump has won. its no coincidence he was with kim jung un while cohen testified as was shiny ball moment. and it worked.

@onebigham @DavidWohl @CNN you refuse to answer any of my questions. typical.ill def seek you out next time someone aggressively jumps ahead of me in the super market queue so you can hospitalise them to a)teach them a lesson about queue jumping and b)just in case i also feared for my life.thats MB logic!!

@mitchellvii and what if teachers dont want or refuse to be armed?
@mitchellvii its a contrived question.its the equivalent of saying if i was a judge in a car crash &amp; the only person to save you was a convicted killer you were sentencing and he threatened to save you only if you didnt sentence him.would you offer him the pardon or die ?
@dumptrump33 even better why not just get police to do a degree in teaching and get armed police teaching children? then maybe the redundant teachers could join the police force if they like backfilling them?
@mitchellvii pretty extreme "joke" bill. and very unfunny/ tasteless. but that probably sums up most trump fans.
@tribelaw this assault rifle is pure indulgence for gun lovers.bit like when mcdonalds sells 1 litre  fizzy drinks. people dont need either. only difference is fizzy drinks cant be used to kill.

@lovethisnation_ @AnnCoulter youre still missing the point. course i would retaliate. but she has used the story to fit her narrative. she probably got giddy with excitement to hear the perpetrator was somalian and got so excited to hit the key board she didn't even spend time finding out her name. sad.
@Jcrowton0007 @golfball984 @AnnCoulter or just nuke em all! be alot quicker.
@lovethisnation_ @AnnCoulter i detest any form of violence and dont wish well on any aggressor. but pointing out in bold lettering which country the perpetrator is from for the soul intent on creating division within a community is wrong and unhelpful.she has meerly used the poor victims story as a pedestal
@RangerJ78 @AnnCoulter so many wrong points in your message im not sure where to begin.but the glaring one is ann never mentioned muslim. and this is the problem.she said somali. and by inference you now believe all immigrants are muslim and then associate this with all sorts of negative connotations.
@lovethisnation_ @AnnCoulter but on this example she is more concerned who the perpetrator is. as opposed to caring for the poor victim. using capital letters to highlight in fact all she cares about in the sad story. does she even mention her name at all? no. she is both lazy and trying to incite hatred.sad

@davidschneider @AsBrexit yet rest assured there are many people out there who would gobble this up.
@nickreeves9876 it appears may has decided there really are only two options. one is tanking the economy and we are all poorer off or civil unrest.she is trying to avoid civil unrest at all cost ie hard brexit if need be.our poorer future is now being decided out of fear only. fear wins.SAD.

@realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost "Don't believe these phony numbers, the number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35 [percent]. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." 	FAKE President Trump on the unemployment rate last year. You started fake news, what you reap you sow.
@dumptrump33 whats even more disturbing than even the robotic rump is seeing him there in that company. not only does it look wrong, it makes a mockery of politics in general.
@dumptrump33 they havent "caught on" yet even with his 1000 odd lies for 2017. i am seriously beginning to wonder what on earth it will take for the magats to cop on and finally see the charlatan they voted for?
@grahamlithgow i know. may as well just do this properly hey? go back to bartering and toiling the land for food. and then we can sit around our log huts and william wallace style beat our chests and enjoy our new found " freedom" from horrid EU.

@murray2147 @mitchellvii ryan owens. he was the first person to sadly die due to trumps arrogance and false bravado and wanting to appeal to his base. three other navy seals were also wounded too. may he rip. i could go on
@murray2147 @mitchellvii he has already killed 14 innocent people single handedly directly due to his own self absorbed narcissistic decision making and actions. thats not protecting life at all. thats destroying it.
@mitchellvii i believe bill mitchell knows he is clinically insane. its a damned miracle he is even able to conduct daily affairs all by himself considerably his inability to think independently.
