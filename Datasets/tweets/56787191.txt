This is why we need you to make calls to your members of congress RIGHT NOW to tell them to sign on to @RepJayapal's improved #MedicareForAll bill. https://t.co/DlE8u9POQ8
... with no financial barriers to care, through a single payer system, that would reduce overall national healthcare spending while improving health outcomes. Any public option bill, including #M4America fails to do all of these things.
Do not let the media and establishment policy world tell you that there are "multiple" #MedicareForAll plans. There are not. There is ONLY ONE option that truly ensures that ALL people living in the US have a guaranteed, single-standard of safe therapeutic healthcare...
There are only two bills in Congress for which the answer is "yes" to all these questions: The #MedicareForAll bill being introduced by @PramilaJayapal and the #MedicareForAll bill being introduced by @BernieSanders.
3. Will this cover all necessary care? 	4. Will patients be able to choose their providers? 	5. Will this reduce total national expenditures on health care, w/o compromising quality care?
When you evaluate different proposals for expanding health care, I encourage you to think about the following questions: 		1. Will this guarantee therapeutic care for every person living in the US?	2. Will this eliminate financial barriers to care (copays, deductibles)?

Finally, it is astounding that @USATODAY would publish an article in which EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE IS A LIE.  It is outrageous and deeply irresponsible. 		Now, I'm going back to fighting for the healthcare that every person has a right to. We're going to win #MedicareForAll
10. I repeat: #MedicareForAll will drastically improve Medicare for seniors. More benefits, less cost.
9. There is not a single private insurance health plan that offers the same benefits as an improved and expanded Medicare for All plan, as can be seen in #HR676 and #S1804. Once again, no private insurance plan is, or will ever be, as good as improved Medicare for All.
8. NO ONE WOULD BE DENIED CARE UNDER MEDICARE FOR ALL. NO ONE. but right now, tens of millions of people are denied care because they cannot afford it. It is a disgrace.
7.5. Also, have you tried to see a specialist in Washington DC? Because my wait times to get into specialists here are MONTHS LONGER than my friends in Canada, where they have a single payer system.
7. There are currently outrageous lines to get emergency care in hospitals across the United States. #MedicareForAll will reduce these lines bc patients will receive preventative care, greatly reducing the burden on ERs in the US. (Just ask registered nurses who work in ER)
6+. Under Medicare for All, every single person will receive the healthcare they need, regardless of how much money they have. There will be a single standard of care for all patients, and national health outcomes will be GREATLY improved.
6. #MedicareForAll will not lead to mass rationing of health care. It will stop the rationing of healthcare in the US RIGHT NOW. Today, tens of millions of ppl do not receive healthcare because they don't have insurance, or they can't afford their copays and deductibles.
5. When Mercatus projected that #MedicareForAll would cost $32.6T, it showed in the same study that this would account for $2 TRILLION IN SAVINGS to overall healthcare spending in the US. (Also, the study did not account for all the savings we see in #singlepayer systems)
4. Democrats have not slashed Medicare by $800 billion. This is a lie. On the contrary, Republicans have consistently suggested cuts to Medicare. In fact, they proposed a $537 Billion cut to Medicare in the House FY2019 budget proposal https://t.co/KP7JZw63K4
3. Trump has NOT kept his promises on protecting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. He has explicitly supported legislation that destroys these protections. ALSO, insurance premiums have continued to increase during his time in office, and people cannot afford them
2. Under #MedicareForAll, you could see ANY provider that you want, without any copays or deductibles. This is not possible in ANY private insurance plan. There will never be a private insurance plan you would want to choose instead of #MedicareForAll.
1. both @SenSanders legislation and #HR676 will improve Medicare for seniors while costing them less. It will cover dental, optical, and hearing, eliminate copays and deductibles, and lower the prices of prescriptions drugs so Medicare is paying less for meds.
I haven't tweeted yet about Trump's USA Today op-ed, mainly because here at @NationalNurses we know that #MedicareForAll is absolutely necessary for ALL patients so we're busy organizing to win it. 		The entire op-ed was factually wrong or totally misleading. Here's why:

The thing is, #MedicareForAll isn't a new idea. In fact, Obama supported #singlepayer when he was running for Senate in 2003. It was a good idea then, it was a good idea in 2009 when his administration refused to make it happen, and its a good idea now that the ACA has failed.

and 2) GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING can magnify the argument, and convince the American public. Why are recent polls showing widespread support for #MedicareForAll ? because @NationalNurses @DemSocialists @CPDAction @OurRevolution and others are canvassing, teaching, organizing.
When Chait argues "it's just too hard" to convince ppl they will pay less and get better healthcare under #MedicareForAll, he misses two crucial points: 1)the argument for #singlepayer is correct, and every other industrialized country shows that.
Why? bc ESI plans have copays, deductibles, and limit which docs you can see. Millions of ppl with ESI plans can't afford the out of pocket costs. So yes, working people CAN be convinced to transition to #MedicareForAll, and judging from recent polls, they already are convinced.

Here's a good explainer to better understand the abhorrent Senate health proposal.  https://t.co/yblCtRWV9N via @voxdotcom
Cuts to Medicaid are paying for tax breaks to wealthy. Rich are robbing the poor. This is class warfare.
Calls and protests are working - but we MUST keep it up! These R senators could announce opposition in order to make a deal on the bill. https://t.co/C3F01z3bqd
What happens to state budgets then? Do they cut money for public schools, infrastructure? Effects of Senate Trumpcare are far reaching.(3)
If there is a health crisis in a state - like the opiod crisis happening now - State govts will NOT get more fed money to cover costs. (2)
These Medicaid cuts are vicious - they will get worse every year, and will fail poor people when health crises hit communities.
This is where @SenateGOP gets rid of coverage for mental health, maternity care, hospitalization. This is  outrageous. https://t.co/r8IK1Cb7kv
Insurance lobbyists saw this bill before the American people, absolutely disgraceful. https://t.co/kA7KqnhpDg
