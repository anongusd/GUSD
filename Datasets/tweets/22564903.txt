#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. Is 5% of your income a reasonable cost for health insurance?
#YouNeedaWill Do you have step-children? It is time to get that estate planning paperwork done.
#OhioLiquorPermit Does your liquor license fit your business needs and goals or is it time to transition into another type of license?
#YouNeedaWill Single parents need wills. It is time to get that estate planning paperwork done.
#YouNeedaWill Do you want everything to go to your spouse? Get a Will. Do you want everything to go to your children? Get a Will.
#areyouexpecting is commonly asked at final hearings for an OH divorce or dissolution because if a child was consumed during marriage, the husband may be presumed to be the dad even if the child is not biologically his unless there is a court order addressing it #NotBeingRude
#ItIsTime Get a Will when you love your relatives, and get a Will when you don’t.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. The court may consider a post secondary education (ex. college) expense for an older sibling as a possible reason for a deviation.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. The court may consider whether an obligor’s spouse can provide health insurance coverage for the children.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. The amount of spousal support arrearage will not be a factor for the new formula.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. Maybe the obligee will want to send out the obligor’s resume in cases regarding obligors that are voluntarily underemployed or unemployed.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. Different factors may be considered B4 imputing income to underemployed or unemployed; has there has been a continuous &amp; diligent effort to work; is temp or part-time work avail, is work avail at less than the previous wage earned, etc.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. Before requiring obligor to provide health insurance coverage, a court may consider the length of employment &amp; whether there is stability of health ins coverage (ex. if the obligor is a job hopper who does not consistently provide health ins)
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. The factors a court may consider differ from what the child support enforcement agency can consider so the amount of the child support obligation could differ depending on which forum is used.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. The formula will no longer max out at a combined gross income of $150,000, so higher income obligors may end up having to pay more child support.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. One of the factors for the calculation will be the number of children the obligor has - even if the obligor is not providing financial support to them.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing. There will be a self sufficiency reserve for low income obligors. It will be set at 116% of the federal poverty level. This could reduce the amount of the child support obligation for those with low income.
Tourist jailed for collecting seashells on Florida beach https://t.co/iIT5IlSg8u
#ohiochildsupport When the law changes, there will be a cap on the child care expense; the age of the child will be a factor. This could end up reducing an existing child support obligation if one parent has enrolled the child into an expensive day care.
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing; the obligee may be required to provide health insurance for the children instead of the obligor
#ohiochildsupport laws are changing; does the obligor spend at least 90 or 147 overnights with the child(ren) per year
