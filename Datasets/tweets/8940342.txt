8/ 136 years ago, then-Gov. Joe Ireland, rallied legislators to protect the public endowment from steep fees. "Shall we guard and increase and protect this fund as a sacred trust,” Ireland asked then. “Or shall we throw it away?" https://t.co/OaEH36nJhL #txlege https://t.co/H2781jjACU
7/ Outside fund managers have charged the endowment more than $1 billion in fees during the past decade. But that's a conservative figure. The fund's administrators refused to provide a full accounting of fees and expenses, despite public records requests. #txlege
6/ The Permanent School Fund is now under the control of two separate boards that argue over who has the best returns on investment. They report their returns publicly only gross of fees, not disclosing how much outside fund managers are paid. https://t.co/OaEH36nJhL https://t.co/SZ0JwIKS3z
5/ Garry Mauro, former Texas Land Commissioner in the 1980s and 1990s, was shocked at the annual average of $207 per student during the past decade. https://t.co/8sfltlwB3m
4/ With the rapid growth in student population, that means the fund paid an average of $207 per student annually over the past decade, compared with an average $322 over the prior two decades, in inflation adjusted dollars. #txlege
@_SusanCarroll @davidhunn 3/ The amount dropped to an average of $986 million annually over the past decade from an average of $1.14 billion in the previous 20 years, after figures are adjusted for inflation.
2/ A yearlong @HoustonChron investigation by @_susancarroll and @davidhunn found that the Texas K-12 endowment is sending less money to schools than it did decades ago, in real dollars. https://t.co/OaEH36nJhL https://t.co/PReLzTkYnr
1/ Texas' founders created a trust in 1854 that was supposed to help forever fund public K-12 education. It has grown to $44 billion, bigger than even Harvard's endowment. But it is broken. https://t.co/OaEH36nJhL https://t.co/A7bbxoUe4H

13/ Read our stories, watch videos with victims and perpetrators, or view our database of the ~220 church leaders/volunteers that were convicted or took plea deals for sex crimes since 1998. #churchtoo #SBCtoo	https://t.co/C7AtyC0ch0 https://t.co/F63N1PZn0B
12/ Other leaders agreed: "The fact that criminal activity occurs in a church context is always the basis of grief," said Augie Boto, interim head of SBC Exec Comm. "But it’s going to happen. That statement does not mean that we must be resigned to it.” 	https://t.co/GZgfwJ2D4X
11/ Current SBC president @jdgreear and others are again trying to address the issue. But Greear said he has little power over SBC churches, and that "change has to begin at the ground level." #churchtoo #SBCtoo	https://t.co/9U0AwfnPx9
10/ At least 35 pastors, employees or volunteers who exhibited predatory behavior were able to find jobs at churches during the past two decades. Some registered sex offenders returned to the pulpit. Others remain there, including at a Houston church. 	https://t.co/viWNXtyEna
9/ Leaders say they have little oversight over the SBC's 47,000 autonomous and self-governing churches. Yet they've ousted at least four churches for accepting homosexuality, which the SBC opposes.	 	They've rarely done the same for convicted sex offenders. #churchtoo #SBCtoo
8/ The SBC does not track ordinations or abuse allegations. "It's a perfect profession for a con artist, because all he has to do is talk a good talk and convince people that he’s been called by God, and bingo, he gets to be a minister,” one activist said.
7/ Some died from suicides or drug overdoses that loved ones blame on the trauma		"So many people’s faith is murdered," said one victim. "I mean, their faith is slaughtered by these predators.” #churchtoo #SBCtoo 	 https://t.co/PZj16cRajL
6/ The youngest of the 700 victims was 3. 		Many more were adolescents who were molested, solicited, exposed to pornography, photographed nude or repeatedly raped by youth pastors.		https://t.co/w7ruqsUdYK
5/ They left behind more than 700 victims, many of them shunned by their churches. Others said church leaders —including past presidents or prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention — mishandled abuse allegations in their own churches or seminaries. #churchtoo #SBCtoo
4/ Since 1998, ~380 Southern Baptist church leaders or volunteers have faced sexual misconduct allegations. Most were convicted; others were credibly accused or successfully sued, or later confessed/resigned. More worked in Texas than in any other state. #churchtoo #SBCtoo
@ExpressNews 3/ Since 2008, when leaders rejected reforms meant to curb sexual abuse, 250+ people who worked or volunteered in Southern Baptist churches have been charged with sex crimes. Nearly all were convicted, took plea deals or have pending cases. #churchtoo https://t.co/Q4AqjM0ALk
@ExpressNews 2/ We analyzed thousands of pages of news reports and court docs to find sexual abuse/misconduct allegations against Southern Baptist church leaders/volunteers. We interviewed hundreds of victims, church leaders, offenders &amp; law enforcement officials.	 	Here’s what we found:
1/ In the past 20 years, a disturbing number of Southern Baptists with formal church roles have engaged in sexual misconduct, according to an investigation by @HoustonChron and @ExpressNews: https://t.co/8RZyiu4oM9 https://t.co/zKREoqupAZ
