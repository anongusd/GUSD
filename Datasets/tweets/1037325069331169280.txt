The products arrive to Puerto Rico, at exuberant prices. Leaving Puerto Ricans to purchase the worst quality, for the most money. The shipping industry loves the Jones Act, but you know that. Get rid of the Jones Act.
@realDonaldTrump  when you buy the paper towels for Alabama, you have to pay more, because of the Jones Act. As it stands, ships from all over the world, are not permitted to dock in Puerto Rico. They must first go to the U.S., then come to Puerto Rico.

@DavidBegnaud Forensic sciences has been denied any assistance from the U.S. Bodies are in body bags, unrefrigerated, furthering decomposition. It's an atrocity. Hundreds of families are waiting months, to bury their loved ones.
@cate_long This is one person of thousands. Bodies are left in body bags, unrefrigerated, which creates further decomposition. Puerto Rico's request for further assistance, from the United States was denied. The U.S. has exacerbated this atrocious situation .
@DavidBegnaud This is 1 story of thousands.
The backlog is immense. Bodies are left unrefrigerated, lying on floors, in body bags. Therefore, bodies are experiencing unnecessary decomposition. Forensic sciences, where the autopsies are performed, was denied any assistance by the United States. https://t.co/h8wal8y2xX
@GOPLeader have your party do some research into Socialism. They sound like a bunch of fourth graders, howling at the moon. While you're at it, they need to learn the difference between weather and Climate change. Snowballs, are not the best visual aides.
The Oslo police and the FBI, are investigating the forged requests for Trump to receive the Nobel peace prize. The origin of the forgeries came from the United States. Another embarrassment for our nation. Guess Trump tried signing them with left hand.

Although the CIA had refused to provide Kushner with the clearance. Kline,also approved 30 other Security clearances, despite 'unfavorable information.' Since Kushner had connections with foreign leaders, he shouldn't have received this top secret clearance.
Jared Kushner's top secret clearance was rejected at least 40 times. Carl Kline, a prior Pentagon employee, was hired to provide  secret Security clearances for the White House. He overruled all  depts.and provided Kushner with his top secret clearance.
I continue to ask the president, what is happening with the drug cost cuts, that he said he would negotiate. However, so far, this year, 16 drug companies hiked their prices. The inability for Federal employees to buy medications, will kill someone! https://t.co/ZVEqsscQV4

If only the 28% that support the wall, would do some research. They would find that Trump needed a platform, and they couldn't think of anything. Then 'walls' was decided because of his real estate. 'Walls' was a word he would remember. That's all it is!

that's safe to eat, and no money to buy it. Unemployment will go up. Our GDP goes down weekly. Our economy loses 6 billion a week. Look at, federal budgetary costs, foregone services and economic disruption. Shutdown undercuts our country's entire existence.

@realDonaldTrump Our massive humanitarian crisis is thousands of children locked up in cages. Children torn away from their parents. Living in sub standard conditions, covered in bed with cold, aluminum blankets. Children have been sexually abused by staff.

Future? AG William Barr's partisan conduct, should make him ineligible for the position. His opinion, that Trump can't be investigated/indicted, should be enough. He's a Mitch McConnell.

@thistallawkgirl Trump's trying to cut Medicaid.
@novelmcbowers Very interesting, lots to take in.
@CristobalJAlex @AOC @politico The article states she "made enemies," however, doesn't define who those enemies are. Also, mentions three Representatives, all of which are helping Representative Ocasio-Cortez through the labyrinth of Congress. Politico loses with this story.
Center for Medicaid and Medicare Systems, CMS, and Trump agree to cut Medicaid. Trump will try this, without Congress approval. This will affect 75 million Americans. 1 in 5 depend on this system, many which are children, Seniors and Nursing Home patients.

@GeoffRBennett @PressSec @nytimes Sara Slanders never gets her facts straight. The "president" is a National Security threat. The FBI did the investigation, because they suspected Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia.
Today: Trump is trying to sidestep Congress to Cut Medicaid through a block grant. We all need to be alarmed. Don't be surprised if Medicare is next.
If you watch Sean Hannity interviewing Trump, he keeps telling Trump,"you can call a National Emergency." "You can get the money from the Pentagon." That was his message to Trump, that was not an interview.
So that he can continue to debilitate our country, until we are so desperate, he'll ask Russia for help. that will be his dream come true. https://t.co/VwLnW9udNo
@TomSteyer Trump corruption at its finest. Absurd!!
@The_UnSilent_ He would hope it's Russia, and he would feel like a winner.
Remember, in plain sight he shared confidential Israeli info with the Russians. Counter intelligence occurred because it appears the president is a national security threat. The president is an agent for 	a hostile country. Trump is working for Russia.
The FBI had 'reasonable suspicion.'	Trump was the subject header of an investigation. The FBI Intercepted communications, because they suspected that Trump was working on behalf of an adversary. He was knowingly working for Russia.
@realBashBrother Just keep on trucking baby..!
As a result of this #MitchShutdown #TrumpShutdown  our nation is losing $2 billion a week. Our GDP decreases daily and our AAA Credit Rating in the world is diminishing. 	Now, why wouldn't I think this destruction of our Democracy is related to the Kremlin?
