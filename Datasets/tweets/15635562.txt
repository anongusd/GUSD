cutting spending by $15 billion, including $6 billion from schools, $3 billion from colleges and $1.2 billion from prisons- welcome to CA
@jessecheng1 @UCstudentregent another way to look at it: having this increase would mean that student fees rose 17% from the previous year!
@jessecheng1 @UCstudentregent this comes out to be a 7% fee hike on top of the may increases.
@jessecheng1 @UCstudentregent divide by 2 gives us an addit 167.5 m/ year of cost 2 cover which about equals a fee up of $545.56/per student
@jessecheng1 @UCstudentregent But the UC accumulate 335mill from natural inflation and over enrollment which hasnt been addressed.
@jessecheng1 @UCstudentregent I actually started crunching numbers and it looks like the 800m is going to be covered for now.BUT
@UCStudentRegent if any fees are raised it will not surpas a 5% mark as oppose to 20% which probably would cover all 800 million dollars.
@UCStudentRegent CSU depend more on state funds than UCs So i feel that its little to 0% chance of more increases for the comming year

interesting times everyone... The recession has just started picking up speed. think about it
@Schwarzenegger Regent Marcus I agree w/ @JohnGaramendi! we need 2 support AB656! we need 2 go 2 sacramento and hve them hear us next time!
RT Regent Marcus: I agree with @JohnGaramendi! we need to support AB656! we need to go to sacramento and have them hear us next time!
RT @jessecheng1: Reiss: We need a campaign, fight for AB656, because other Dems want OilSeverance for other things
@jessecheng1 that is why we do not sell our oil to us.
@jessecheng1 This is a good bill that economically has no flaw for CA. fyi our oil is more expensive than the middle east
@jessecheng1 so this bill would tax the sales of that oil and we would be taking money from other countries instead of our own citizens
@jessecheng1 California produces oil (suprise suprise) and we actually dont sell it to ourselves but we sell it to other countries!
@JohnGaramendi I AGREE to your arguement about the oil severance tax!!!
RT @mark_yudof: Chancellors speaking at Regents meeting: all caution cuts leading to brain drain from their campuses. We have to stop it.
@jessecheng1 SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT COME ON!!!!
@jessecheng1 did also wear your uci pride tie????
@jessecheng1 do you know how much we rely on state gen funds?
RT @mark_yudof: Hearing some alarming facts about "brain drain" from UCSD. Top faculty going elsewhere, taking advantage of better offers.
