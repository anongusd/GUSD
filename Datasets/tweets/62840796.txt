@thehill I see another white man with anger issues, who doesn‚Äôt own a suit jacket, who doesn‚Äôt care about our constitution, the American democracy or what being President of the United States really means @Jim_Jordan. It‚Äôs not party over country.

@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Thank you! Now let‚Äôs implement #RussianSanctionsNow
@SenatorBaldwin How do you like those crumbs @GOP
@GOP 17 people died last week, killed by another white American terrorist with an AR-15 and you are still focusing on Crumbs. It‚Äôs really crumby that so many in the @GOP are sell-outs to the @NRA. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain
@ScottMStedman @lauferlaw And yet @MSNBC gives her s platform in which to spew it. #RussianSanctionsNow

@NancyPelosi Why on earth didn‚Äôt you speak to her prior to going on Sunday morning News? This really hurts us with the Alabama election. We need to hold ourselves to higher standards.
@renato_mariotti No part of this tax plan benefits women.
@SpeakerRyan Yes you are and it‚Äôs not through tax reform. You will be a legend and you will be remembered for colluding with Russia and a crazy man. We are voting you out!
@kylegriffin1 Why does he still have security clearance? @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
Do you know the real facts - @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/kmybcj7kNe
@marcorubio This tax reform bill does NOT benefit the average American
@marcorubio Have you denounced Roy Moore yet?
@Stonekettle @dorotheascloset This is truth and all do these people need to be voted out of office. @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan
@AoDespair @NancyPelosi Why?
@SenGillibrand And vote our women like @NancyPelosi who put party before principle.
@NancyPelosi @RepJohnConyers Bullshit Nancy! Bullshit. Party over principle. How, how as a women can you take this stance. You will be voted out.
@lkmcgann It‚Äôs time for @NancyPelosi to go!
@WhiteHouse If only we had planes, we could have a true tax break
@RedTRaccoon @NancyPelosi needs to go
@shannonrwatts @NancyPelosi - Really? So lame. I expect more from you as a women and a congress member. Disgusting... and this is exactly what‚Äôs wrong  with both parties.
@BillKristol They both need to go!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Very dangerous ground we are on. @MitchMPOTUS @SpeakerRyan when will Congress take some action. Our country is built on free press.

@realDonaldTrump Peas in a pod. You both are NUTS!
@DebraMessing Let‚Äôs change that. Let‚Äôs pick 5 congressional leaders and call, email and tweet them as a collective group with the same message. Who‚Äôs in?
@RevRichardColes @dorotheascloset Not the young men. I worry about Trump and his cronies. I worry that our religious leaders in the country put party over principle and sacrifice our you g people. That worries me. #MeToo
@realDonaldTrump I wish you felt the same about domestic terrorism and assault weapons.
Today, my birthday - I am thankful that we do have our freedom. I am thankful to those who fought for it, those who preserved it, those who sacrificed for it. #neverquit

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @Varneyco If you happen to run into President Trump in there, please encourage him to resign.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don‚Äôt you have a meeting with Russia to get to?
@SpeakerRyan You are going to need to legalize weed in WI so that we can all get high to understand this reasoning. Cindy cannot live on $30K a year. Your tax plan sucks

@realDonaldTrump Lots of horrors "I did try &amp; fuck her. She was married. I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn‚Äôt get there. I just start kissing them. I don‚Äôt even wait.

@WhiteHouse I am all for tax reform that helps the average American. This bill doesn't do that. It will not pass.
@KamalaHarris We will keep using our voices. It's just surprising we have to fight so hard for something that is crystal clear.
@FoxNews Angels are weeping..this is our reality?
@thehill That is the response you would expect from a Russian spy. @GOP  how much longer do we all have to deal with this shit show?
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump should be impeached and in jail. If the worst thing he ever did was shoplift we would be so much better off.
@SenateGOP @SenToomey At the cost of the average American!
@shannonrwatts We let it be and everyone needs to vote in upcoming elections. More women and minorities need to run for office.

@FoxNews @TezlynFigaro there is a reason for that. We don't encourage child molesters to run for office. It's time to let go of the party rhetoric and support each other.

@seanhannity @Nutrisystem if you support this man who thinks that a 14 year old is giving consent to sexual abuse I cannot support you.

@realDonaldTrue @Haven_Resists If we were not reeling from the latest white terrorist assault weapon attack on our country's children, in church this might be funny.
@FoxNews Yep, no one can handle a terrorist with an assault rifle #GunReformNow
@senorrinhatch Hard to do the right thing when you took $97K from @NRA. Stop praying &amp; search your conscience for these kids who were murdered in church
Congress, when will you quit praying and take some action? @MitchMPOTUS @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP https://t.co/32aoEyuu8p
@FoxNews @PeteHegseth Yes, Pete maybe all the church goers including their children could hold on to their assault weapons during the church services.
@SpeakerRyan White guy, assault weapon. We have a domestic terror problem &amp; we need serious gun reform. Congress needs to stop letting the @NRA buy them
@GregAbbott_TX @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @SpeakerRyan @MitchMPOTUS @POTUS @NRA Guns have no place in church. God is  giving you a sign, are you listening?
@WineGuy711 @GOP @POTUS @TheDemocrats Absolutely, stop fighting and work together for gun reform @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
@GOP @POTUS Take some action. when Isis is involved the President wants to take immediate action. Why doesn't our govt address guns in the same way?
@katiecouric We are letting power, money and greed drive our decisions vs our hearts #GunControlNow
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP https://t.co/j1dXup3swW
@SteveDaines The prayers are appreciated, but when will Congress act on more restrictive gun controls? Domestic terrorism is killing us #GunControl
@sendavidperdue We really need you to both pray and pass some more restrictive gun controls. #SutherlandSpringsChurch
Amen! https://t.co/W906euU2bT
@JimInhofe Prayers are not enough, Congress must act now or be voted out. Domestic terrorism is killing us! #SutherlandSprings
Everyone is praying &amp; no one is considering that these sense acts of violence might be a sign from God to actually do something! #GunControl
@SenCapito People are no longer safe when they pray. More restrictive gun controls are a must. What are you waiting for?
@SenatorIsakson Prayer isn't enough! It's time for more restrictive gun controls. Domestic terrorism is worse than Isis!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe God would like for you and Congress to impose some more restrictive gun control. Domestic terrorism is far worse than Isis
@marcorubio I will say it again, all the prayers in the world will not stop the use of automatic weapons. It's time for more restrictive gun control.
@SenatorLankford Mine too @SenatorLankford when will Congress take some action on more restrictive gun controls. Domestic terrorism is as important as Isis
@HouseGOP Mine too, is it time NOW for some more restrictive gun control? How many more people have to die in these mass shootings?

@SpeakerRyan Be sure to publish the tax breaks for everyone who earns under $75,000 a year - BEFORE the vote.
Women need to to stand up and speak our truth to take away the power of people like him. https://t.co/bqpPKH8YXt
@realDonaldTrump Please be sure to publish the cuts for everyone under $75,000
@GOP Why don't you work on a real healthcare plan vs. making him wrong. You don't get it and this is a stupid tweet.
@jaketapper Par for the course with this Administration. #sad
@SpeakerRyan We are surviving you my friend!
@SenateMajLdr @DeptofDefense Maybe Congress could give them your pay raises and your medical benefits @SenateMajLdr ?
@SethAbramson And yet??? Nothing from the @GOP to address this. This might be how they could make America a bit better.
@tedlieu How bad are things with our Congress that this has not been addressed. A back door to Russia! WTF?
Given all of Trump's free speech, this should not even be up for discussion. https://t.co/npyo4zfmpJ
@pacelattin Well now, she is a model.
@FoxNews @PressSec @POTUS @HillaryClinton The Amish called they want their dress back and the lesbians want the pearls.

@tedcruz Liking porn you didn't like-that's cruel. Or is it?
@adamcbest Trump needs bible verses and porn to compete

@HouseGOP Great! Thanks
@GOP @POTUS Oh is that what he is doing. I thought he was selling hats, promoting books, and encouraging racism!
@realDonaldTrump If only he could get you quit tweeting stupid stuff.
@realDonaldTrump Russia = rigged!
@TODAYshow Such bullshit!
@thejoshpatten Unless you have grilled hot dogs and if you are from Chicago and add celery salt. Heaven!
@KamalaHarris Amen
@RepBrendanBoyle Made me laugh out loud and yet sad.
@ANNELAMOTT My son and I just rewatched the Hunger Games series. It was therapeutic.
@PalmerReport Drinking now.
@PalmerReport Don't we all?
@KamalaHarris That's intentional. What can we do to get the @GOP to act?
@GoldmanSachs @thrive @ariannahuff Can some people still sleep with what is going on?
@WernerTwertzog Priceless!
@SenWhitehouse We know it will be, but are there a few crumbs for the rest of us? I doubt it.
@RepBarbaraLee Yes we do and I guarantee you that is not on the current administration's list of things that are important. How do we change that?
@ChuckGrassley Um... yes and isn't that telling!
@cmclymer And that means to love your neighbor as yourself. All your neighbors: the gays, the trans, the blacks, the people who really need you.
@VP Oh your back after the pardons and trans bans. Thanks!
@AnneFrankCenter @IvankaTrump We need more than equal pay. Until women hold seats in government and on the boards of major corporations we won't have power. We need power
@AgnesAnneM @thereversefIash @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Flpotus hold my shoes.
@getongab @realDonaldTrump This I love
@realDonaldTrump So your saying we should not take their money now, but instead take Russia's?
@ChrisMurphyCT I worry for all of us.
@Scaramucci @POTUS Please pass the crack pipe...we are not seeing it over here.
@repjoecrowley @realDonaldTrump The man doesn't live in reality. Lalalalalala
@SenatorCantwell Me to Maria!
@SenatorTimScott I am all for tax reform. That said I am more worried about Mr. Crazy behind the wheel. And Nazis, hurricanes, civil war...
@SenateMajLdr Oh your back...that's good.
@SenThomTillis @POTUS Are you on drugs?
A picture is worth 1000 words. He was selling hats and crowd size. https://t.co/3JWLlvSOT4
@JohnPiper Maybe a Russia Statement too! Thou shalt not be peed on...
@JohnPiper You could also write a statement about hate for Charlottesville!
@JohnPiper Only 60 churches are open in Houston during an historic flood. Write a Houston statement on that!
@lizdyer @ceonyc @JohnPiper Make sure you share it!
@PeterAlexander She definitely didn't go with the sensible shoes!
@JoelOsteen And yet...didn't want to open the church doors. Such a hypocrite!
We all need to open our eyes. This is happening, for real. https://t.co/gx5IMZx0m5
@Thia2 @kylegriffin1 @enamoramiento1 He might think he is on one? He is mental!
@SenToomey @POTUS You only need to do this if you empower nazis, kkk &amp; others Absolutely the wrong direction to take the country unless civil war is the goal.
Where's the love button! https://t.co/d6Kai6hNt1
@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump I love you!!!! Keep tweeting back @VicenteFoxQue
@HouseGOP While the tax code may be broken we have much bigger fish to fry. It's time to act regarding POTUS.
@RepSwalwell Will Congress act?
Amen. https://t.co/yHfrq4k3FB

@EVNdraws @PalmerReport I hope she stays safe.
@VP @POTUS @TxDPS @TxDOT @GovAbbott Oh right, after promoting books, walls and his big win last year in Missouri. How do you live with yourself? #HoustonFlood
Hard to believe, and yet... https://t.co/QJuZqOjmnI
@HouseGOP at this point we need for you to protect all citizens and defend the constitution. Anything short of that is lip service!
@Amy_Siskind And again this morning with tweets about the wall and his big win in Missouri. He has no inner compass.
@Ofelia5613 Be safe!
