@NBCNews I wish the entire press Corp would have taken off their shoes and thrown them at him! FFS!!!!!!!!!
@NBCNews Kinda like Spicer yelling ‚ÄúApppprilllllll like she was a child.‚Äù  These men are reprehensible.  @AprilDRyan

@aparnapkin Can someone please just create an app for this.  I also need to more accurately track my crimes with a color coding system so when I am on the spot I can better cover my tracks instead of just getting red faced and child like.  I‚Äôd also like to track brewski‚Äôs per hour.
I ‚ù§Ô∏èwhat @AmericaFerrera said on @VanJones68. What the hell is @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @GOP so vein popping outraged about? What an absolute disgusting time in our history.  (My words, not hers). #Kavanaugh is not owed that lifetime position. It belongs to all of us. üá∫üá∏
RT @Augustus709: Please, stop with this nonsense that Kavanaugh's life's been "destroyed."		So he may not get promoted and will remain a fe‚Ä¶
@MichaelAvenatti Because he wants to ‚Äúsay‚Äù that he did all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things.  It is a joke.
