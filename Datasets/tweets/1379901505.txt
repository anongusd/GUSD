@TX21Indivisible @chiproytx In terms of the corporate tax cut, that was done to make our industries more competitive globally. It will take time for that to fully register in increased federal tax revenues. Casting judgement on the new tax law is quite premature, esp considering that it’s only a year old.
@TX21Indivisible @chiproytx “... individual income tax receipts were up by 7.8% compared to the equivalent 10-month period.” Strong econ growth (created through tax cuts &amp; deregulation) is needed to be able to pay down the national debt.
