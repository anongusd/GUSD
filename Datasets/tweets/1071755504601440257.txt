most of us look outside of ourselves for happiness. This is a futile pursuit. Striving towards any external goal, while noble if done with pure intention, will never be the cause of happiness...‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Happiness is not something that should be pursued as an end result,happiness and being contented in life should be the starting point,happiness increases the more you give it away,so the key to happiness is simple make somebody else happy and happiness will find you...
