@LandonHall @BresPolitico @POLITICOPro You‚Äôre right - skepticism is warranted with this president‚Äôs policies.
@codytfenwick Fair that Pence‚Äôs recent views haven‚Äôt been excavated (and @pauldemko detailed some of Pence‚Äôs strategic problems. https://t.co/1zpoilC08a)		But the doc who persuaded Pence is now US Surgeon General. And the official policy of this HHS is to support needle exchange to reduce HIV.
@ZackBergerMDPhD The tweet right before that links to multiple examples of how the Trump/Azar agenda has alarmed public health folks.		The point I was seeking to make ‚Äì¬†on HIV, at least some advocates and scientists believe there is enough potential common ground to make progress.
8) Anyway - here‚Äôs the story, out from the Pro firewall. https://t.co/0KSc9qFsfU		If I missed something, or you have questions (or tips!), my DMs are open and I‚Äôm ddiamond@politico.com by email.
7) Among the questions that we‚Äôll be tracking:		- Will Trump keep pursuing efforts that hurt HIV patients even as he makes this big, new promise?		- Does Trump‚Äôs team, which has committed to other major healthcare goals, have the organizational competence to pull all of this off?
6) For folks who ask ‚Äúwhy is Trump prioritizing HIV now?‚Äù it‚Äôs a combo of things, per reporting.		- His health team sees it as a problem, with 40,000 new HIV infections per year	- They also see it as achievable goal, given science and trends	- Potential for bipartisan appeal
5) That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs especially necessary to scrutinize the people ‚Äî¬†and policies ‚Äî¬†that Trump is putting in place here.		But worth noting the administration (even Pence, who changed his mind)¬†supports policies like needle exchange and other accepted public health tactics.
4) One clear issue ‚Äî which our story details ‚Äî¬†is that Trump has spent two years making *many* moves that created setbacks and distrust with HIV advocates.		Am v. familiar with this, because we broke a lot of those stories like https://t.co/YDUu6gO3we and https://t.co/krJR2wB0oX
3) For folks suggesting that Trump will just announce ‚ÄúNo more HIV‚Äù ‚Äî¬†or something worse ‚Äî¬†that‚Äôs not the plan.		U.S. health agencies are standing by to unveil a bigger strategy post-speech that evokes traditional, nonpartisan efforts. At least some AIDS advocates are on board.
2) In the U.S., Obama similarly pledged that HIV transmissions could be ended within a generation. Independent health experts also believe it‚Äôs possible. 		Here‚Äôs a great @HelenBranswell story on the theory vs the strategy of stopping HIV/AIDS. https://t.co/KZO0SPe6TS
1) It‚Äôs not implausible to pledge to end HIV outbreaks ‚Äî¬†in fact, the World Health Organization has set the same goal of ending HIV transmission by 2030. https://t.co/E7kvMTpNIv		So Trump would be following in other countries‚Äô footsteps with this promise.
Seeing many reactions to this story that are somewhere between snark and skepticism ‚Äî¬†which makes sense, given the Trump administration‚Äôs track record on HIV and LGBT-related issues.		Think there are a few details that might help non-health care folks w context. (thread) https://t.co/A86sckQNwW

Now out from the firewall. https://t.co/0KSc9qFsfU		Trump‚Äôs new pledge to fight HIV would come after two years of moves ‚Äî¬†like trying to cut AIDS funding and pursuing anti-LGBT policies ‚Äî¬†that have often alarmed scientists and HIV advocates.

I was talking to Trump appointees this week who were excited about planned health innovation models the administration is launching.		Those models were all made possible by provisions in the ACA. If the whole law‚Äôs illegal, those initiatives would be too.

@dariustahir @Farzad_MD Beto will likely lose, Abrams is a slight underdog and Gillum is a polling error away from losing. (Could they also go 2 for 3? Sure!)		The only point is that many Dems‚Äô three most exciting candidates could be facing a tough Tuesday.
@Farzad_MD https://t.co/pZttFrW9WC https://t.co/zTGro7SA2I
@sberg0 Probably between 10-20 percent, yes, when using projections at 538 and elsewhere.
@KBorkman We‚Äôll see! Beto is a longshot; Abrams is more like 40-60; and Gillum is a decent favorite but a polling error away from losing.		The only point ‚Äî¬†the three candidates that folks are most invested in could very easily lose on Tuesday. Alternately, two of three could win!
@dgleick (Sorry.)
@doug_starkey Honestly, don‚Äôt know. In the past, have heard a lot more from conservatives. Would imagine among 100k followers (and 1,000-plus replies) gotta be more than the few dozen who weighed in.		Not making too much of it.
A plurality of responses mentioned Beto, Abrams or Gillum (and often, all three) as the candidates they‚Äôre really, really hoping to see win. There‚Äôs a good chance that Democrats go for 0-3 in these races on Tuesday. https://t.co/1EYQCpXndC
