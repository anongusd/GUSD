@HillaryClinton Thank you Hillary. Oh how I wish I could have addressed you as Ms President.
@SenBobCorker @SenatorMenendez Senator I finally agree with one of your decrees.
@KellyanneConYou I feel that is more or less a joke for a reason.
@JoyAnnReid Wow
@DanRather And Trump believes it's all because Californians don't know how to rake leaves up.
@theycallmebob @jaytrainerband Well done Bob. We now have control of one house. What does it mean? It means this administration doesn't get a free pass on every nonsensical idea it considers important.
@PreetBharara No one wants to hear from Trump tomorrow neither.
@AngelaBelcamino No you're not the only one. I know there are millions who find 2020 too many years away.
@AngelaBelcamino Angela after reading a few of your posts I feel your beliefs and political decisions somewhat match the same for me.
@ChrisJZullo Good luck
@theycallmebob Thanks Bob.
@Stop_Trump20 Your nuts.
@theycallmebob Anyone who treats another human being like trump spoke to Jim Acosta should never be allowed to hold any kind of news conference again. Obviously trump was never taught honor or civility during his formative years.
@katstails @MuslimIQ @janiszilly That's unbelievable and tyrannical behavior on this Administration.
@SaysHummingbird I hope he is, sooner than later.
@robreiner Your so right!
@UKCoachCalipari Thank you sir, very well said.
@staceyabrams Stacey please keep your fight up. I pray every absentee, lost and late vote is counted in your favor.		Michael Schenck
@kasie Oh Kasie Beto has provided portions of Texas with a more enlightened Government during his political life. I have spent a tremendous amount of time in Texas. In fact my best friend lives in Ft. Worth. Texas needs the honesty, direction and intelligence that Beto provides.
@HardballChris @BetoORourke Yes
@GOVERNING Wow
@SteveSchmidtSES ....War, 5 years after his first election. My draft number was in the teens so my travel ticket would be called to that war. I was accepted to college, no easy task back then. It was my only time I voted for a Republican ticket and obviously my last.
@SteveSchmidtSES Steve in 1969 I turned 18 and immediately registered to vote. I registered as a Democrat all because my parents were registered as Democrats. My first vote in a Presidential affair was for Nixon all because he stated he would end the Vietnam.....
@theycallmebob @jaytrainerband Thank you Bob. Our freedom is precious. It has been defended for more than 250 years. Our vote is as important as defending a line in the jungles of a battle.
@MeghanMcCain @ABC Megan he'll be watching you.
@maydaymindy9 Well Mindy I wish America hope and justice tomorrow. We all need new leadership and direction.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Guys I'm watching you before the mid-term elections! I'm asking the nation to vote with your hearts tomorrow. We all have to provide a free Democratic Life for America, one that accepts everyone to it's boundaries. We must change our red beliefs to blue dreams and desires.
@jasonbaum Jason, I just posted basically the same possibility. Can this happen? What a wonderful political team and the best way for corrective means to lead our United States.
@phun_wang @AlexChampet @JoeBiden @MichelleObama @DrBiden @BarackObama Yes
@TomBradyworld Well I think the world now must believe that Tom Brady is the best quarterback of all time. Who can top this man at this position?
@freak1ngawesome Babe! She certainly appears to be the loving animal I could take care of and she for me her entire life. 		Since the passing of my last dog, is it possible that I may have an opportunity to give her a wonderful home!		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky 	859-699-0176
@phun_wang @AlexChampet @JoeBiden @MichelleObama @DrBiden I think I've said this before but here it is agin; is it possible that you decide to run for President and former President Obama run along with you as your Vice Presidental selection? If the current statutory law allows it, count me as vote #1.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, KY
@iammaewest OH I like you Linda and this post. Carry on and good luck.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@Stop_Trump20 @SusansBB Wow! What do you think? Do you think he ever's listens to his dad? I don't.
@SRuhle Oh how I agree. Thank you sir. We all need devotion like what you exemplify.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump He knows it only helps his wealthy buddies. I'm not a political know it all, I do though know when the dark side is being pulled over my eyes.
@LunaLuvgood2017 Luna I think I already smell some deception. This race must be watched very closely for all of America. For all of our Freedoms that so many have died for in the past!
@robreiner Thank you, thank you and THANK YOU Julia. Everyone must listen to the sanity you speak. To the honesty of the times we all are suffering thru today. Vote. Vote to make a Democratic Society safe.
@fashionPerfec Sandra it appears the picture you have posted was taken in St. Marks Square. I'm curious, I'm I right?
@SophiaRyan25 Sophia I enjoy your work. Please continue your great discoveries.
The World’s Most Incredible Secret Gardens https://t.co/GWBOQSkneA via @ATInteresting 		Thank you. A very beautiful and satisfying view of our world for someone to enjoy their Sunday morning coffee. Please keep up your great work.
@EarlOfEnough Katy I hope you cast your ballot before you traveled to GA.
@UKAthletics Hey, Hey, Hey Kentucky is the team to send Georgia back home trying to figure out what they did wrong. What they did wrong is not understand KENTUCKY is a TEAM to be feared and misunderstood for their play on Both Sides of the ball. Go Big Blue!!!
@UKAthletics Hey, Hey, HEY we need to send Georgia back home wondering what they did wrong!!! Well one important thing they took wrong, Kentucky is a Team to be feared and Reckoned with. Go, Go, GO BIG BLUE.
@babe_tsunami 		Hey Snowflake 		We have two more years of Trump. Know what?? we have only 3 more days of a Republican Congress and Senate. Vote them OUT. We need, no require Democrats in Both House's. Tell everyone go VOTE!!!!!
https://t.co/o6IUZu3slN
@CaptainsLogAz Hey I'm voting! I'm going to vote straight Blue up and Down.
@robreiner Again Rob thank you for your wise voice during this critical time in America's history. We indeed are at crossroads that we all must cross with honesty, dignity and justice amongst everyone.
@Brasilmagic He is beyond crazy!
@SusanStark_ Well Susan I think most of us know how love feels.
@SEC @UKAthletics Well eels like every year about this time during the season, 4 sometimes 5 SEC teams are ranked in the top 10 teams in America. Very fitting.
@TrisResists @RHeathervaughn @briantylercohen @TheSWPrincess @TrinityResists @Lady_Star_Gem @TopRopeTravis @B52Malmet @MatthewWolfff @meg_Y12 @lfkraus @CaptainsLogAz Wow. Did you guys install new shingles up on the roof?
@Eugene_Robinson Thank you Eugene. I admire your work and certainly your commentaries on MSNBC.
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe Andrew I wish you a successful campaign. I happen to be a resident of Kentucky so I can't cast a vote for you. I can though vocally state that your words, desires and future directions are exactly what the State of Florida not only needs but certainly requires. Good luck my man.
@Vicki_in_Iowa @MSNBC @SteveKingIA I certainly agree Vicki
@theycallmebob Thanks Bob. How can we turn these people away? So Trump says this little girl is carrying a disease? If so I would think we have the capacity to provide medical care!
@kasie I wish he would serve as an independent.
https://t.co/T7VOE6JisB
@Redistrict @costareports @CookPolitical Dave I've only once provided a red vote in the past  49 years and it turned out to be one provided in error and that vote was way back in 1968. Everyone must vote Blue 5 days from now. We are at a precariously and required cautious point of time NOW!
@thehill I'm watching Trump on tv. His response to the crowd size walking thru Mexico is a figment of HIS imagination. We have 5 more days to vote for a Blue Wave of understanding and resistance.
@Brasilmagic Sarah, I think you guys need to understand it's going to take both Houses to screw around with the Constitution.
@kasie What in the world are you guys talking about? Are you going to throw your vote away? May I remind everyone, your VOTE is the most Powerful tool you possess. Do what ever it takes to cast your Vote.
@Turnip2020 My wife and I voting with the Democratic Party straight up.
@mikememoli @LUnderwood630 @JoeBiden We need more and more for Joe Biden.
@KendallBreitman @JustUnitedd @MSNBC @alivitali I agree. I wish somehow we all could go back to a paper vote.
@TODAYshow My gosh, after this woman serves whatever sentence she receives she should never be allowed to drive again.
@theycallmebob Yeah red is just not right! We all need a Democratic Congress. Vote, Vote Blue! Let's All make it Right!!!
I’m attending Team Claire’s event, “Get Out the Vote Rally with Claire and Vice President Joe Biden” – sign up now to join me! https://t.co/Nqz2GzUqME
@robreiner Mr. Reiner, I remember watching you on my father's tv way back in 1956. I was 5 years old then. My mother made sure we watched your weekend show every week, even the reruns. Sir I have high regard for your comic ability and now your wisdom. Thank you!
@NotJerryTipton Beautiful! What else can I say?
@funder Wow! Tell me if this doesn't represent a double standard!
@theycallmebob Well sir we pray the Blue find their way to the Voting booth next Tuesday.
@theycallmebob As always, thanks Bob. One more week, 7 days and we begin seeing the light at the end of a very dark tunnel.
@Eugene_Robinson 		Sir I personally wanted to send you a note of my satisfaction for your appearance on MSNBC. Your work and more importantly your comments regarding the President, along with the Government workings in Washington are unmatched. Thank you.
@AnerisMusic Appears to be one for everyone's perpetual library.
@UROCKlive1 @FoxNews I look to your help to fight his actions. America must continue its "welcoming" attitude to the poor, the tired, the hungry and all people who seek freedoms from persecution. The Statue of Liberty must remain strong and tall.
@mikeallen This man is beginning to turn America into HIS belief of what freedom means for the United States! His actions are insulting all Americans. He's obviously planning to change the marquee or meaning at the Statue of Liberty. All Americans who are born prior to 2016!
@deprxssives Please, why would you want to bite me? I thought you and I were friends?
@EricKadavy 		Sir I admire your service and your dedication to America's freedoms enjoyed by the millions back here in the States. Eric I hope your command and fellow servicemen stay safe and find yourself back home soon.
@universityofky @UKFootball @UKCoachStoops Oh my Gosh. Who's payin' to fix the ceiling tiles? But know what, who cares after such a climatic win this past Saturday. What a Team, Whata Team!
@Slate How can you phrase a word used by possibly only the electoral society in an effort to minimize the massacre conducted within a place of worship!
@MyGingerRoots Well 'Ginger' I must admit you certainly still look seductive!
@tjbeisner Hey everybody we need some good news over all of the horrible news we suffered thru this past week. If we win I hope I'm there so I can catch a ride on his back!!!!
@SRuhle @AliVelshi @VelshiRuhle Well I also wish you a Happy Birthday Ali. I missed Stephanie's show this morning. I won't miss your telecasts later today. I hope Stephanie can storm your set with birthday wishes from America. We certainly need some good news over the past weeks bad news!
@CalebJHull @RealWoodyVanErk @MarshaBlackburn @LindseyGrahamSC Please South Carolina vote this man out!!!
@CJPatruno @Spiritual_Annie EVERYONE!!!!!!
@KassandraSeven @deejay90192 Oh I agree wholeheartedly.
@theycallmebob @fireflye10 I agree with your purpose. It seems the young guys feel the 	Bi-Yearly vote isn't important, yet I think there are 31 Governor races. I might be wrong with you hat, not sure.
@theycallmebob @fireflye10 Bob will you or can you put something together to honor the victims of what happened yesterday in Pittsburgh?
@NormEisen @trump_versus Norm my heart mourns for the individuals who lost their lives yesterday and suffered by the hands of the deranged shooter in Pittsburgh. Can you post your thoughts regarding this tragedy?
@thehill Thank you Mr. President. The young people of America need to hear your voice! You are admired and the most recent President remembered by our young persons who can state this Country's concerns which they can hear. Keep your voice on the airways for the upcoming election!
RT @EdKrassen: Please support these Democrats Running for Senate!		@SenBillNelson - FL	@RosenforNevada - NV	@SenatorBaldwin - WI	@clairecmc…
@CNNTonight @donlemon And Don can you understand, digest or more importantly believe that a man elected to serve and lead our Country state that Arming Parishioners at our places of Worship is an answer to the violence that America is experiencing!! God is Crying!!!
@thehill I really now question if you do have any kind of heart in your thinking, reasoning and decision processing. I'm now to be greeted by someone armed with a M-16 and then someone holding a collection basket at church!!! God is crying not only by the callous act but also your words!
@NBCNews @MariannaNBCNews Sir look at Don Makson's post. It's NOT a World problem, it's an American problem. A problem exacerbated by YOUR lack of control with America's gun laws. Now, per your thoughts, I'm to be greeted at church with a M-16 and then a collections basket. God help America!!!!
@RVAwonk @honestyquest Caroline can you believe this man's statement! I question if he has any scruples, if he hasn't suffered some kind of a mental failing of some sort. Rest assured, GOD is crying right NOW. GOD does NOT want a M-16 greeting HIS parishioners at each service!!!
@JDiamond1 .......is this man coherent? How can anyone suggest providing Armed Guards at  places of Worship. He says the World has become very violent. No sir, the World hasn't become so violent, America has become very violent since you have become the President! !!!!
@JDiamond1 It's so hard to believe that a President would make a statement like he did regarding the shooting at a Synagogue, a place of Worship! He thinks that armed guards should now be posted within Synagogues, Churches and all places of worship!!!!		My God!!!! ........

@kylegriffin1 @bruce79038687 Mr. Vice President we need some encouraging light to our Country's very dim political life. Please announce your Presidential Candidacy for the 2020 Democratic Ticket. Our Country is in dire need of your direction now more than ever!
@4YrsToday @Boatoptional2 Ask the question if Trump is our worst President of all time?
@HillaryClinton @deejay90192 Hillary, I've used my rite to vote for 49 consecutive years. Only once did I vote Republican and that was when Tricky Dickey stated he would end the Vietnam War. Oh he did, 5 years too late. Mrs Clinton I am a true Blue Democrat straight up for the past 48 years.
@EricSchultz @BarackObama @tammybaldwin @Tony4WI Thank you Mr. President. Your public persona is matched by No One! Can you or would you run as a Vice-President nominee along with Joe Biden running as our new Presidential nominee?		What a team! Can I dream of this possibility?		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@adamgoldmanNYT Maybe not. Hey I live in Central Kentucky. I've been to the City many times, especially during the 80's. I've never had a problem up there.
@SteveSchmidtSES I guess Steve, your pegging your next book, and wow, it certainly appears it will be interesting.
@adamgoldmanNYT Well Mr. Goldman I believe in our police departments, especially when several agencies work together to apprehend a potentially serious individual.
@thesarahsutton @ssia22 @hitRECordJoe Hey thanks for posting your correct name Sarah. I have a niece named Sarah, very nice name.
@nowthisnews Sir, thanks. Thank your for a clearer picture of why the South Americans are traveling to the "land of the free." Of what hardships they have suffered and now the hardships imposed by Trump!
@mommajessiec Hey, he watches you for one of two reasons, he hates to see you leave and or he loves to watch you back up the car!
@SardonicTart @Peauxtassium Sorry you missed the 1.6 billion, or did you?
@ssia22 @hitRECordJoe Hey Ssia I used to smoke! I finally quit 18 months ago. I started smoking when I was 12 years old. I'm 67 now and gosh I now feel 20 years younger. 		Way to go!
@CatHall87 @hitRECordJoe Hey I'm not judging you. Obviously your honest. And your just stating what is comfortable for you. Thanks.
@TheView @MeghanMcCain Megan we all know you had a wonderful teacher, a person of righteousness, a father of servitude. Your standards are far above most people here in America by your God given pedigree from your father. God rest his soul.
@theycallmebob Thanks Bob, your words ring a symphony of wisdom.
@hardball @nytimes @peterbakernyt Well either he shows just how dumb founded he is OR where his true allegiance stands!
@ward_annie @kazweida So here I am texting to you by the grace of God. Not a burn mark on my body. I do though suffer with some aches but I still can get out of bed each morning. I have a wife who has been thru hell with me. God gave me the love of my life times ten!
@ward_annie @kazweida One burn mark. I was knocked out. Three drunks who were behind me ran up to the car, dragged me next to the highway and then left. A farmer heard the crash, came running down to the scene and then called 911.....
@ward_annie @kazweida Well I wish you good luck. Insurance can be an enemy as a person turns older. I can attest to that statement. In 1988 I hit a 30" diameter oak tree by the side of a road head on with my corvette. The car burst into flames yet I didn't receive.......
@ward_annie @kazweida Annie thought I would send a picture to you and show you that I Do still have some hair.
@ward_annie @kazweida https://t.co/l3vIm9iKaO
https://t.co/R5K6SsltjN
@ward_annie @kazweida Well Annie I'm older than you but it's so nice that you and I think, breathe and walk in the same beliefs. I so wish now that former Vice-President Joe Biden would make it official and finally say he intends to put an end to the madness in Washington in 2020.
@politico We must!
@deprxssives Oh forget that. I tried that before. I ended up catching mistletoe from them.
@deprxssives First please let me know a name I can call you. Second which person is "pretty"?
@ProudResister @jannsloan And Ryan I will vote Democratic straight up.
@ProudResister Well Ryan I don't see one Democrat that voted for this bill. Hmmmmm!!!!
@ward_annie @kazweida So your texting with a 67 year old fellow. Good thing, I still have all my hair and it has remained brown all these years. I've seen a lot. I've remained married to the same women, an Italian, for more than 41 years. I have 3 children and 6 grandchildren.
@ward_annie @kazweida Hey Annie a little info. I voted only one time for the red ticket way back in 1968, my very first time to vote. Tricky Dicky was going to end a war in Vietnam. He did but 4 years too late. I have voted as a true Democrat ever since.
@ward_annie @kazweida Hey, I don't want anything like that to happen. I'm just an old dude trying to relax during my retirement years.
@ward_annie @kazweida Annie, I'm confused. What do you mean regarding the"hate"?
Robert De Niro wins ovation for 'Fuck Trump' speech at the Tony awards https://t.co/8T5e1yUgKx		Mr. De Niro thank you, thank you for your voice of sanity. I have placed my vote continuously for the past 49 years and rest assured I will vote again in 2 weeks.		Michael Schenck
@kazweida Kaz, oh how I agree with you. Now have we possibly put ourselves in harms way?
@thehill Hey, to everyone who happens to be viewing this site, how would you feel or better yet, would you feel scared to open your door, find a small package and pick it up with what's happening right now!
@loisbaker88 @EmmaEvaaa Lois, are we looking at a true post?
@mschlapp Schlapp please try to understand the right side of our political climate. Sir you appear that your direction always veers left regardless of the facts.
@_SJPeace_ Beautiful Heros, especially during the times we all are facing with the type or possibly non-typical Government operating in Washington today.
@deprxssives Are you sure? Why me? What are you going to do now?
@realDonaldTrump Sir where is your Presidential leadership, where is America's direction to make our Country safe? My God How can we call you President? America is under attack, have you directed the FBI to start an investigation into the bombing acts currently being directed to our citizens!
@SRuhle Where is our Civility in America. Where is our President? His Remarks regarding the Government's investigation into the terrorist acts toward our residents in this Country is very unpatriotic bordering on treasonous acts that must be accounted to.
@deprxssives I agree.
@potuspoker And by the way, I have voted BLUE for 49 years every since then and will once again November the 6th.
@potuspoker Hey, I voted Red one time and only one time way back in 1969. That year I turned 18. Wow I could vote, but also be drafted. My draft number was 19. I was going to Vietnam! So I voted for tricky Dicky! Oh he ended the war, like 4 years too late!!!
@BrookeBCNN @StephenAtHome @UNCMJschool You are so correct. I practiced Architecture for more than 41 years having built an office which employed more than 25 individuals while providing the General Practice of Architecture. Words are as important as stones in my designs!
@robreiner @ianeBeE And Rob look what happened today Wednesday, October the 24th!!! Someone used this post as their playbook to send bombs of destruction to all who are noted in your dissertation. And as you state the most powerful tool we all have is our FREE VOTE!!!
@JoeBiden Thank you Joe. "This Division, this hatred, ""certainly"" this ugliness WILL end" once you announce your Candidacy to Lead this Country once again. Mr. Biden, I would be honored to call you MY President Biden!
@SenJohnKennedy Sir I don't agree with your style of Governing. I do though certainly agree with your statement. Whoever has mailed the suspicious boxes WILL be caught. And once apprehended this person should receive the Max!		CNN evacuated the entire building!
@rorosaunt Anderson I LOVE it. She just doesn't quite understand reality. How and why she continues to operate in somewhat powerful positions has to be the result of her husband!
@UROCKlive1 I've never liked someone lying to me. Typically someone who lies usually is also trying to hide something or someone!
@deprxssives That much what?
@JohnMLevitt Hey, great John. I'm watching you right now on MSNBC. You are so right. We have to CHANGE Congress. The Democrats have to get out and VOTE. Come on guys Get Out And VOTE!!!!
@theycallmebob And you can always count on my voice for your support!
John Lewis: I've had my skull fractured for the right to vote, 'vote like you’ve never voted before' https://t.co/RJLlYRlvIh 		And John I also have had my skull fractured, by a druken stupor! This time I vote for my Future, my Children's and grandchildren's Future!
@theycallmebob Oh Bob you are so very welcomed. I welcome your work as often as you can post it. Again I hope America hears my voice and your work November 6th.
@theycallmebob Bob, I'm not sure how many "Thank You's" I've posted on behalf of your work but again Thank You. Thank You so much. You deserve the Gold Award, the Gold Medal for your type of work.
@theycallmebob Bob, we, and please note, WE of Ameica, pray the Sounds of Silence is strongly heard November 6th. VOTE so that your Voice is heard!!!
@SaysHummingbird Wow, I Normally state a remark "unbelievable". Well not the case here, I certainly believe this post.
@ChrisMurphyCT I remember that party! It made it on a lot of National airwaves.
@ChrisCoons Senator I trust your posts far more than I trust Trump's.
@KatyTurNBC Thanks Katy.
@gedragsprobleem @_SJPeace_ Hey that's great. Thanks for posting the beautiful video. It shows how wonderful all Americans truly are.
@deprxssives Gotta, what's your first name? I'll talk with you then anytime.
@deprxssives Why are you saying this? Who is disappointed?
@Scarlett_Jo Scarlett, wow, I personally can watch "Lucy" as long as probably as long as it took for you to prepare for the role. Great Job!
@Scarlett_Jo Who's not?
@agooding58 @KarrenKuk @tbell1968 No, I think he's very honest. He may carry humility with his persona though.
@deprxssives Hey I'm 67 years old. I guarantee I have many good stories to tell.
@deprxssives Or the fear of losing it. Though I may have lost something many years ago in the sand on a beach.
@deprxssives Hey Gotta, what's your first name? And by the way I don't think I've lost anything that I can't remember.
@KathlynBrady7 @Me78120345 Well Kathlyn, on November 6th we must take control of both the Senate House and the Seats of the Representatives.
@HistoryInPix Wow!!! All men should ALWAYS recall what women go thru in an effort to please our enjoyment as they walk among our everyday activities.
@UROCKlive1 Oh how I agree with you!!!!		We all have to get out and vote Blue!!!		If not it's possible that Free thought and choice may start an erosion too hard to recover from!
@Stop_Trump20 Kentucky
@TheRickyDavila @Eleven_Films As I've already posted, my vote will be the color of my eyes-blue straight up, on everything straight up!
@Stop_Trump20 As I have for the past 49 years, I will press the blue tag straight up.
@Amy_Siskind @EngagednEnraged @BrianKempGA @GovernorDeal .....I believe so strongly that you, your bus load and the entire country of Black Folk not only deserves the right to cast their vote but hopefully can give us another wonderful leader such as former President Obama!
@Amy_Siskind @EngagednEnraged @BrianKempGA @GovernorDeal Thank you, thank you and, well, THANK YOU. I'm a 67 year old Caucasian, a white folk. I live in Kentucky. I'm a retired Architect and I've done a lot of work in Georgia, in fact I had an office in Atlanta for 3 years. My middle child is a former UGA student and...
@theycallmebob @thedavidcrosby @EngagednEnraged Ohhhh Bob and you sir, David, I remember so well goin' into the corner bar, gettin my beer, head to my bar friends and then some a-hole get in front of the juke-box and play Nugent's crap over and over again!!!
@deprxssives Are you questioning Trumpism?
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Bob that's what our Lord has given all of us, a wonderful and hopefully healthy life with family and love. I don't think Trump can come close to thinking like that.
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Hey Bob, my Grandson is with me right now. He just got here. He just turned 13. He's my first grandchild out of 6. I have a wonderful family, how about you
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 I think he enjoys the traveling. His wife travels more than he does. She has a job that takes her across the US
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Right now he went out with my wife to get some dinner so he's not here right now. He's flying back to Chicago tomorrow. His work takes him around the Country.
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Well Bob, who know's what may happen in Chi-Town. Have you ever been up there?
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Hey Bob, how ya do'in today? My Son finally has shown up. He lives in Chicago. He came into town yesterday to watch the Kentucky Wildcats play Vanderbilt. Geez we had a tough time but we ended winning by 7. Anyway I'm going to send you back with him up to Chi-Town.
@PortlandBabs Oh No! Sorry. I'm a True Blue Blue Man all of my life. Nixon taught me very well on the importance of the Democratic Voice.
@PortlandBabs Well it's been a while since the last time I spoke with you, so how's things going out in Cali'? Are you guys trying to keep a Blue Wave rolling across America? 		I would love to see the red State of Kentucky turn to the color of my eyes-Blue!
Hey Dave, you have to watch Bob's work. I've spoken to him about you. 		Dave spread the Blue Wave.		Mike https://t.co/GnHynvMq24
@theycallmebob @usafmsgt53 Hey Bob thanks, It seems like only a portion of my previous messages were making it to you. My Brother-In-Law, David Trivisonno, knows more people than I have ever met in my 67 years of existence. 		He certainly can help to spread the Blue Wave!
@theycallmebob Well thanks Bob. My Brother-In-Law
@theycallmebob Love It, Love It. Where's Steve "N" playing next? Or can they pull a Green John Deere up behind 'em?
@theycallmebob Thanks Bob, I feel a BLUE Moon Rising!!!!

@EdKrassen @DawnMorey2 Damn Right!
@SaysHummingbird This man should Not be allowed within 5 miles of the White House!
@SaysHummingbird Don't we all remember his rants and his complaints about President Obama. Trump doesn't deserve the same singular salutation as President Obama.
@billmaher @ramona7rae Hey Bill I've watched you grow up on late night. I think your voice represents very important statements for the Democratic Free thinkers in America. Thanks and I hope you continue your attacks towards our current state of affairs!
@heathermhuber84 @lotusblossum163 @1pissedPolack Hey Heather, I've walked this life for 67 years and honestly I can't recall ever trying p-  someone off intentionally. That's not to say I haven't. And if I ever have, I hope that whoever I may have upset has forgiven me. Hey I know I'm not perfect.
@ReginaRed4 @1pissedPolack @lotusblossum163 Well they can AFTER they leave my house first! I've got 2500 sf hat needs their special hands.
@1pissedPolack @lotusblossum163 Unbelievable, both of you! Go out, meet new people, talk to someone who might be lonely but forget about having a sparkly kitchen. Nuff said unless you two work inside an operating room. Wow!
@StephenKing Stephen I'll probably have to wait to read your work. It sucks but I had to retire from my practice 4 years ago so my availability to purchase your work will probably not happen. I do though have numerous pieces of your books in my library.
@SRuhle To deal with the results of the collision I now take 5 tabs of pain killers each day of my life. I'm very religious regarding the prescribed timing of each dose. Do I enjoy the medicine, No. Do I require the medicine, Yes.	It sucks!
@SRuhle Steph I had a serious car accident way back in 1988. I crashed a 1985 Corvette straight into a 30" oak tree situated on the side of a road where a 90 degree turn also exists for this road. As you may guess the tree won in this situation. So.........
@SRuhle Stephanie I personally think your very good with your reporting. I've seen the sun rise for 67 years and I watch you every work day, especially during the political climate of today. I have to send you TWO separate postings so please look for a continuation.
@Deva_With_An_E Mr. President, thanks. Oh I so wish somehow a third term could somehow rise from the soul of Roosevelt.
@PortlandBabs Hey I stated the South Side of Louisville, actually about 20 miles from Ft. Knox a very large training center for the Army. It's where people in the Service learn how to operate Tanks in War. And Babs I personally witnessed some crazy fighting!
@RainMaki @FLGovScott @GOP Get out and Vote!
@RainMaki @FLGovScott @GOP Hey RainMaki I so much agree with your statements. And I feel we are at an immense and the most serious election at a Mid-Term I have Ever experienced in my life! This includes the Mid-Terms during the Vietnam War Period!
@SenSchumer @Morning_Joe Senator help us in Kentucky. We need honest direction sir. I agree with your comments on Morning Joe! Please help us turn this State Blue. I'm 67. Obviously Healthcare is a number One concern for myself. Thanks for all of your help sir.
@Deva_With_An_E Dwell thanks. Whatever it is, we all should see how important it is to protect all species of animal life!
@CharlizeAfrica @CharlizeAfricaf @CTAOP Charlize I admire what your doing, your time and funds you have unselfishly given.
@PortlandBabs Well thanks. At the time I grew up on the South Side of Louisville, Kentucky. It was a rough area. Going to College was typically unheard of. So now, I'm a retired Architect and have been blessed with a wonderful wife, three children and six grandchildren! Wild huh?
@PortlandBabs Hi Barbi. I certainly like your post, background photo and obviously your appearance. I'm a happily married man for more than 41 years. 		I missed the Vietnam War by going to College which was unheard of back then. My question, is your brother still with us or has he passed on?
@JillEmerson_ @SusanStark_ My gosh, is this a real animal. Not only does it carry a tremendous amount of scientific curiosity, it provides a concrete base for a new line of plush toys!
@KamalaHarris @MsMariaT Ms Harris I have religiously cast my vote for the past 49 years for the Democratic Party.		I thank you for your vigorous work towards the upcoming elections. I will once again cast my ballot with the Democratic Contenders in the State of Kentucky.
@PeterAlexander @PhilipRucker I wonder if Trump had anyway to verify that comment!
@KathleenBorski So what do you do Kathleen?
@Lisabwilson @SusanStark_ Beautiful. Have you seen any Crocodiles?
@KathleenBorski My day has been nice today. I live in Kentucky. The sun is out, but it's chilly for me. Right now it's 45 degrees.
@rachey56 That is the most outrageous myth I've heard or seen. My autistic grandson loves to express his desires, his needs and his wants. The guy is now becoming more sociable, a trait that is so difficult for many individuals afflicted with this disease.
@DaniloBlandon79 @dianne_hornick @realDonaldTrump Hey, hey, hey the man is helping America's peanut farmers of America. How many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are consumed in "Our" White House is now a guess!
@MKGenest @dianne_hornick Don't worry- be happy.
@dianne_hornick Well it's nice to see the camera working again!
@Deva_With_An_E Hey I can't argue with that feat. I have no idea how you guys handle it even without a shirt.
@Deva_With_An_E What exactly is it? I agreed Deva it is fairly cute but it appears it enjoys chewin' most anything.
@KathleenBorski So how are you?
@KathleenBorski And did you really mean what you sent by your text?
@KathleenBorski Are you there Kathleen?
https://t.co/5Ihl5bnnur
@McFaul Michael thank you. It would be nice that the Menisci Act be published. I'm even not sure of the correct spelling of the Act. Because of my high respect of your understanding of all current legal matters, your comments would also be highly welcomed.
@deprxssives Not true, well at least for me that's not true.
@deprxssives Well I don't get this
@deprxssives Your right
@MFtaai @deprxssives Well great
@deprxssives Well too bad
@deprxssives Agree
@deprxssives Wow, please rethink that statement. Go to mass tomorrow or buy a blueberry muffin.
@deprxssives What? Nice long gentle sex?
@deprxssives Listen God is Always with you. God is with all of us Always.
@mvintocavel @deprxssives Well did it happen
@deprxssives Oh I agree
@deprxssives I'll pass on this one
@deprxssives I agree,
@deprxssives Great. It's nice to hear you have a true love with the same person. I believe God wants us to spend our lives together with one person while we're here on earth.
@deprxssives You need to tell me what she did and then I can respond.
@deprxssives No I told you earlier, I'm married to a wonderful women with Italian heritage. She was born in Cleveland and moved here when she was 17. I met her when she had just turned 18. She's 64 now. We have shared many years together.
@deprxssives I think everyone deserves respect even people who have broken laws. They need help, education and training.
@RosettiLeonardo @deprxssives I guess this is your kind of guy. Here's what I look like, an older kind of guy. https://t.co/JClncFAnJv
@deprxssives It's hard for my machine to pick up your pictures so I'm passing on this post.
@deprxssives Well I really don't care what people think of me so I feel I don't care what other people think so I try to remain happy.
@deprxssives I've tried to answer all of your posts as honestly as I could. I've tried to remain simple and I've had a few smiles during the answers that I've given. I hope you find them somewhat unforgettable anyway.
@deprxssives Well you may be speaking regarding your sex, I'm not sure. I personally take a normal shower, obviously being a man.
@deprxssives Oh I do believe in the last sentence of your post. God is Almighty and I truly believe he has amazing plans for me.
@deprxssives Hey DON'T lay in bed and cry. If it's 2 AM get up. I see you smoke, grab a cigarette and a nice book. Like a tv commercial here says stay in your comfy pants. Relax, enjoy.
@deprxssives Well men have problems also. Because of my age and my near fatal car accident, I don't sleep very well every night. In fact I'm texting with you and it's nearing 11:45 tonight.
@deprxssives Well I'm not sure what "feeling" your speaking of.
@deprxssives I'm sure it's none of my business. So why did you post it?
@deprxssives Well I hope not. I don't work any longer but my wife does. She works hard taking care of children with mental disadvantages. I try my best to help her, I cook, I try to clean but somethings not a very good job. But we're still together.
@deprxssives Why do you have these? Is he important to you?
@deprxssives I find being alone somethings as a nice way to look to inside yourself and determine your the most important items you love.
@deprxssives Sorry not sure who Mia is.
@mvintocavel @deprxssives Well I can't respond, I really don't understand your statement. Maybe because of my age I not sure what NGM is.
@deprxssives Why, give it another chance. Give it 3 chances. Gosh I told you I've been married for 41 years and let me say, there where many times I needed 3 chances.
@deprxssives Know what! I try not to complain about too many things any longer. It's taken a long time but I finally figured it out, life is just too darn short.
@deprxssives Who drank too much? I gave up alcohol way back in 2002. Then I guarantee you I drank too much.
@deprxssives My Geeky way!! Why?
@deprxssives Well good luck. I feel you might be able to conquer many things during your life. I'm not sure what your age is but I feel you have a whole life ahead of you.
@deprxssives Well I don't think I'm unlucky. I have a loving wife, three beautiful children and 6 wonderful grandchildren.
@deprxssives You know this should be embossed on the highest building in every city across the world.
@deprxssives Well his Son's Jesus Christ. I was raised a Catholic and as you, believe in our Lord Almighty.
@deprxssives Yeah I agree. The lives of people around the world are so different from one society to another.
@deprxssives Hey, hey, hey give yourself some time. I'm 67 years old. It took me some time to understand simple things. I think my wife now believes I understand her after so many years together.
@deprxssives No I have not. I am though very interested in World Affairs.
@deprxssives Well I am happy. Right now I don't think I have offended anyone.
@deprxssives I'm not quiet sure what your speaking about.
@deprxssives Well the researcher must be right.
@deprxssives Hey my life has shown change. In 1978 I totaled a corvette and was pronounced dead. And now here I am answering your postings.
@deprxssives Well thank you.
@deprxssives Oh I'll probably answer your texts sometime in the future
@deprxssives I'm sure you won't. You don't even know who I am.
@deprxssives Probably, I always have been.
@deprxssives Well I'm not sure what happened. Will you tell me?
@deprxssives Well a hug probably would be nice but I feel I live very far away.
@deprxssives I try not to make that mistake. Temperatures are the most important attribute.
@deprxssives Oh I agree.
@deprxssives I agree.
@deprxssives Well again I can't comment about that.
@deprxssives Oh and I agree heartily with that statement.
@deprxssives Why not. I see changes everyday in everything!
@deprxssives Gotta, I'm a man. I've been married to the same women for 41 years and I'm not going to ask her that question.
@deprxssives Well in an hour I'll be in bed. It's after 10 at night right now. Hopefully I will smell your perfume and wake up.
@deprxssives Oh I'm not sure about that statement.
@deprxssives Well that's fantastic.
@deprxssives A though one what?
@deprxssives Well you really don't know who I am.
@deprxssives I don't quite see any images. Can you show me?
@deprxssives Again, I'm a guy so you may be talking to your boyfriend, I dunno.
@deprxssives Hey Gotta Stay, I always try to be sincere!
@deprxssives I'm not sure what she asked her husband. Will you tell me?
@deprxssives Oh how I agree with you with that statement!
@deprxssives Hey I'm a guy so it's hard for me to relate to that statement.
@deprxssives What bad things do everyone happen to do?
@deprxssives I seldom have bad days anymore.
@deprxssives I'm curious, where did you come back from?
@deprxssives No I've been married for 41 years and I still love my wife.
@rebeccamalagon1 Thanks Becky! U make more sense than who sits in the hall!
@peterbakernyt @AshleyRParker @carlottagall @ddknyt Its beyond today's understanding how anyone can be submitted to such a horrific death. So far the Trump Administration appears to be covering up some sort of connection to this barbaric action.
@WesSmith123 Kill the tax cuts stupid!
‘Lighten up, Francis’! Daily Beast/MSNBC’s Sam Stein is legit pissed at Orrin Hatch and it’s just fantastic https://t.co/2kBmvux3Gx via @twitchyteam		Hatch needs to go and retire to his millions. His time has past. I pray the blue wave can clean the Chambers.
@davidaxelrod David I live in Lexington, Kentucky, approximately 22 miles from where Trump held a rally this past Saturday. Sir I definitely avoided his campaign rally, for himself. I only wish his term would end sooner than 2020!
@JohnsanLinda @loisbaker88 Yeah wow! Where is the stadium planned, or is this a dream proposed by a design firm! Having practiced Architecture for close to 41 years, I find the posting a long away possibility rather than an actual project!
@USATODAY Is it time to decide if Donald Trump is truly an American. Geez America must, no is required to protect its citizens.
@TraveIbIog @AbigailWilsonAW Abigail have you traveled to Vietnam?
@TracyFisher_ Wow! I consider this a gift from our Lord for everyone's enjoyment.
@TracyFisher_ Well Tracy, where do these animals congregate in the world?
@travelvibes8294 Well who's working toward this type of mass movement? I'm 67 and I doubt I will see such a beautiful means of travel in my lifetime.
@mmpadellan Hey Brooklyn Dad, I'm 67 and retired now. I had to retire because of physical problems. And guess what, the only funds being sent to me from the Federal Government (my only source of income) is what I paid into Social Security from when I started working at the age of 14!
@SteveSchmidtSES @WilliamLongino2 Steve you have more power than the typical American citizen. Barring the safety of your own life I ask for your investigative research regarding this barbaric act.		Michael Schenck	Lexington, Kentucky
@RepJohnYarmuth @RepCheri @HouseGOP Sorry Sir, since my Representative Senator happens to be Mitch McConnell I feel my concerns regarding any changes to the current Retirement Distribution Funds will fall on deaf ears. 		I'm 67 years old and I ask for your help to protect my only source of income.
@RepJohnYarmuth @RepCheri @HouseGOP And Representative Yarmuth, I a 67 year old retiree cannot request a positive fight against any
@JoyceWhiteVance @jacoker2 I can only say, God is always on the side of the righteousness. This gregarious act of brutality must be viewed punishable by All civilized, God Fearing Countries. I look to all individuals which command a National following such as you Ms Vance.		Thanks
@JoeBiden @NORTHER64691120 Thanks Joe. Please, Please say your running. We need your guidance, truthful directions and your sincere leadership.
@saba_h @StormyDaniels @NYMag @TheCut Thank you Saba! One very important missing picture which could be added....................................................A                                Pregnant Mother holding her 2 year old daughter's hand!
@iammaewest Thanks so much. My heart bleeds for simple affection that if everyone practiced this world certainly would be a far safer place.
@iammaewest All of us need undying love and affectionate help everyday!
@PhilipRucker Thanks Philip for your honesty in your reporting. We all know you work your tail off.
@iammaewest Obviously she had a job far above her pay scale. She should find a job behind a counter at a hamburger restaurant.
@MollySchenck1 Hey my name is Michael Schenck. Are we related?
@rosstump1 You know, when he was running for President I remember he stated all he ate were Big Mac's. I can't even begin to guess how many Big Mac's he has consumed to put on so much weight!
@naturalphotos__ Beautiful
@mertonia @penneyewart @Defendario @SethAbramson I also thought his clearance was downgraded.
@macloviop @honestyquest @paulkrugman Mr. Perez you are so very correct!
@EmilyEve7 Emily were you at this castle?
@EmilyEve7 Thanks Emily Eve. Very nice post.
@EmilyEve7 I love this post. I love History. I live in Lexington, Kentucky where a good amount of Civil War affairs were enacted. Again thanks.
@EmilyEve7 @JessStaccy @nature Beautiful, Our Lord provides so much beauty thru His work!
@robreiner Rob I ask you to keep reminding the GOOD people of America of our Freedoms. Our Democracy is precious and it has to be protected.
@RantingOwl RI was born in Louisville, Kentucky. Is this where you moved to?
@SenSasse Sir you speak eloquently while being questioned regarding your beliefs. I do though question your desires of Governing the people of America.
@ABCPolitics @TheView Ben you have to get back a little bit Eastward. Geez the taste of a White Castle burger will remain on your mind until you can figure out how to bring a restaurant to Nebraska!
@theycallmebob Hey Bob keep it going. I'm one small nut in a bucket of metal. I have to believe I'm older than you. But your originality will help you to enjoy your days your whole life.
@theycallmebob It takes just a few to make a difference. Correct me if I'm wrong, just a few good men founded a new country, America!
@theycallmebob Hey thanks so much. I went to school, studied Architecture, practiced that craft for nearly 40 years. I feel I can recognize an artist and sir I consider you an Artist in the video world of today.
@theycallmebob Do you go by Bob, is that your name. Since I'm retired, living on social security funds I spend a lot of time on the web. My wife still works as a teacher assistant, minimal salary but at least we have descent medical coverage.		So Bob, thanks.
@theycallmebob Wow, sir you know how to tug at all true American's hearts. Sir I personally live on a very minuscule salary from my retirement funds. I wish I could help your cause(s) but I'm financially strapped.
https://t.co/5XaEfTKnuN
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Love it
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 I love it. So sick of Trump. More, we need more if 2 more years are going to remain red!!!
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 Wow, oh wow, oh WOW. You guys are great. We need more and more and more. Our current leadership needs direction as shown by your smooth collective dancing and passionate presentations!
@theycallmebob @Me78120345 More, please more!
@thepaperword Mia, I hope you stay well enough to continue your postings. Many of us are not well right now. We cast ballots in 3 weeks. Hopefully we all can begin a healing process then.
@Staggfilms Thanks, everyone in America needs some humor to get by day to day especially for ToDay!
@JohnJHarwood I agree John. I've been a Ms Stahl fan for years, too many to count.
@SaysHummingbird When did this happen? Where did this happen? I believe a severe penalty should be imposed on this fellow. Jail time should not be excused neither. This man is a danger to the neighborhood!
@SaysHummingbird Yeah.
@thedailybeast Well which or what agenda? Republican or Democratic?
@Yolie_Rios @AliVelshi @JoyAnnReid Guys agree with all of you. Ali I personally am so thankful you relocated from Southern Africa. I feel your also happy to be here the greater United States.
@ZTJ42 @KentuckyMBB Appears to me "Dancin"
@KentuckyMBB If I had 2 hearts they both would be painted on this team's upcoming season's video posting. Gooooooo	                                                                         Kats, Kats	                                                                             Cats
@AllThingzTRUMP @thedailybeast I'm lifelong Democrat. This act should NOT be spoken about, even in a stupid prank.
@PortlandBabs @SenBlumenthal Barbara, thanks for your posts, seriously! Anyway I'm curious and I'm hopefully curious, did your brother come back home from that horrible war?
@SenWarren @Kris183769281 Thank you Senator.
@PortlandBabs @SenBlumenthal Lady do you know actual thing about Vietnam? My draft number in 1969 was the lucky number of thirteen. What was yours?
https://t.co/6JuEVa7BKi
@krassenstein @jamie_nix Don't worry, be happy I'm Voting!
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff though I live outside your Congressional area, I intend to select one button this November, the Blue Button, Democrats for all selections!
@tammy40444732 Tammy do you have a pierced tongue? If so did it hurt like hell to get that done?
@RubberGuardBish Hey Ell I certainly agree with your absolute of our current state of affairs. How this man became the most powerful man in the world can only be attributed to Russia.
@Stop_Trump20 @shirleygirleeee @acoad1111 @dewaaier112 @Markbreeden @RPottery @murrayb560sl @phildevine1 @EliasDelagarza @mark777day @IreneSevier @belltown96 @islandertmt Maggie I financially cannot support your cause. I do though can state on the web, I do support your action!
@DanRather Dan I live in Kentucky. I've personally had the pleasure to do a lot of building design work in Eastern Kentucky. The people of Eastern Kentucky are hard working and loyal to their word.
@regan11218lane @UROCKlive1 Angry, I'm 67 and have voted blue from the time I turned 18. Why? Well the horrible war in Vietnam was raging. Right now I believe America is fighting the war of "Trump". Again I find the color Blue the only lever I can pull.
@UROCKlive1 Your dissertation is aspiring. Our Country has fallen into troubling times. Yesterday's Oval Room broadcast was a sickening portrayal of our Freedoms under attack.
@senatemajldr Senator, though I belong to the opposite party you subscribe to, I ask that you help stop any foreign armament sales to Saudi Arabia.
@LunaLuvgood2017 Luna, I admire your voice. I also admire the freedoms we all have in America to express our dissatisfactions!
@DanaScottLO @Augustus709 @Clara_Resists @StormResist @TheSWPrincess @NatCookResists @TrinityResists @Elastigirl2018 @1Jedi_Rey @Minervasbard Scully, I'm born American. In my early years I used a small caliber rifle for hunting. I gave that practice up in 1969 when I left home to attend college. I'm not opposed to firearms used for the hunting of animal game. I totally oppose concealed firearms.
@EdKrassen My vote is the only defensive tool I own!
@EdKrassen Hell Yeah
@glenn87027633 Yeah? Wait and see!
@lauriecrosswell We'll whatever you do I like you Laurie.
@LauraLoomer Wow! Frankly texting, Nikki seemed to me the only positive thinker in the Trump Administration. I personally will miss her statements on our World Affairs.
@lauriecrosswell Everyday! Can I ask what's your job?
@lauriecrosswell Laurie do you work, what's your job?
@lauriecrosswell Well thanks Laurie.
@lauriecrosswell Laurie I'm a religious Democrat. I placed one vote for a Republican only once who promised to end a war in Vietnam. And now I believe that vote was misplaced. So at the booth coming up 30 days from now I will press the blue button for everyone who runs for public office!
@DHallerman @JohnBrennan @vampire6442014 @realDonaldTrump Thank you Dave, I have religiously placed my vote for the past 41 years and always will place my vote so that my Voice will be heard!
@SenatorDurbin Thank you Senator I only wish one more, just one more Senator would have followed your lead.
@SenJohnKennedy This Appointment to the Supreme Court will tarnish Legislation for possibly 35 years or longer. I question why a second candidate could not have been explored and possibly presented to the House for consideration as a Supreme Court Judge.
@DavidCornDC Senator thank you for this comment.
@kasie Senator Collins-Why?
@SenatorDurbin I so hearty agree Senator!
@SenBobCorker Sir please keep your comments to yourself, wife and children. Don't you think that any women could correctly identify someone on top of her! My gosh!
@MSNBC This man must NOT receive a seat on our highest court in America. He certainly demonstrated his partisan belief, gender opinions and Judicial temperament throughout his Judicial hearing on the Hill!
@elwasson Well
@SenSchumer Sir he not only owes Dr. Ford an apology, he owes the American public an apology.
@morningmika Thanks Mika. Obviously the monies being put up by the Republican Party is fueling this assault on Democracy.
https://t.co/D568yRfZGF		Mika 		I want to express my total disappointment for the possible appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In fact I personally feel this man should be stripped of his current position as a judge of all courts in Washington!
@JoeNBC Joe I personally watch your show every morning working with Mika. Please note, I'm totally against the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In fact I feel the man should be stripped of his current position as a Judge in Washington!
@SaysHummingbird This man should try his best to understand what the emotion "compassion" means.
@SaysHummingbird It's horrible!
@RepAdamSchiff Oh I believe all of America, Republicans, Democrats, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Men and Women must be disgusted with this man's continued mockery of the basic principles of normal life!
@1pissedPolack Ladies, five more weeks and this Country will find a Blue sky once again. Somehow Kavanaugh must Not be appointed to a very important seat that he so certainly does not deserve!
@amcmahon05 @CynthiaAlksne Thanks Cynthia, as always you speak truth with wise knowledgeable facts!
@SenateDems Thank you!
@JuliaEAinsley Huh. I question why the FBI feel that way.
@kenvogel @Alyssa_Milano @illuminator99 Beautiful. I hope she's not upset. She represents America 's heart, America's beliefs and American virtues.
@ABC I'm of the profound belief that anyone, for that matter, everyone must present an appearance of civility in front of a camera. Especially a camera that is telecast across the Nation with a worldwide audience.
@RWPUSA @jannsloan Certainly smells way across the wires.
@Michael_Ceraso @bex0760 @thehill Mr. Ceraso Calm down! First I'm not sure if you have any children, if not please note that children, even my grandchildren read these posts. Everyone's comments warrant consideration but normally civil consideration.
@thehill I'm not sure how this man can look at, speak to, kiss and touch his daughters and also his wife after his Shameful display on National television
@stonecold2050 Yes Kelly Ann, who more truthful than women.
@CynthiaAlksne @MSNBC @AymanM Thank you so much Cynthia for your candor and honest reviews. I'll be watching this afternoon.
@MSNBC Mr. Graham, and please note I question if you deserve the dignity of the connotation as Senator, who cares how it was leaked. I thank our Lord and Savior that it is public knowledge now. This man should be stripped of his Judgeships.
@FaceTheNation No, as a Supreme Court Judge, any Judge on any Court, can not "sweep" anything under any rug!
@FaceTheNation @SenAmyKlobuchar Senator I also agree with your very professional statement. As a recovering Alcoholic since 1992, Mr. Kavanaugh exemplify' the same traits of someone who is tied to the chains of this disease.
@FaceTheNation @SenTomCotton Senator Cotton came very close to calling Ms. Ford a liar. He did state that he felt she was sexually assaulted but not by Kavanaugh. 	Wow!	Cotton should give up his seat and find a job somewhere picking his namesake!
@mjfree A person with a problem with drinking will deny having a problem always.
@Janet4OH @NewDay Janet I just watched your testimony on CNN this morning. I just want to say I support your campaign. I personally cannot send funds due to my limited income. 		I do wish you success in the upcoming election.
@amyklobuchar Senator please accept this transmission as my hope that Mr. Kavanaugh will NOT be appointed to the Supreme Court.		Thank you,		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky 	40515
@DanRather Thank you Dan. Sir America still listens to you with open ears!
@SamuelLJackson Thank you Samuel.
@SamuelLJackson Yes Samual, this man wreaks with an alcoholic lying breath.
@SamuelLJackson Whoever! Thank you, thank you and well thanks. I haven't laughed out so loud for quite a while.
@thehill Thank Ms Ford. Your Testimony tore at America's heart. 	Your courageous act will change my grandchildren's lives. Thank you.
@Alyssa_Milano @GManfan64 As a recovering alcoholic, I can assure the Country this man appears to have a drinking problem.
@SenatorDurbin Thank you Senator.
@HardballChris Chris this lifetime Democrat thanks Senator Flake more than I can say. My heart is heavy that he is not returning to the Senate after this year. I do though understand his decision.
@SenWhitehouse Thank you Senator. I only wish your voice, beliefs and directions may be followed by many Americans in this country.
@USATODAY Bring mr Judge to the Senate hearings!
@RiegerReport @BradMossEsq I personally watched, believed and followed the Senator's statements regarding our Government. If his vote favors a sexual assaulter I then question his true belief in our Constitution!
@JeffFlake Senator I ask sir that you please look to your heart and vote No to Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. My grandchildren need a Judicious Mind to insure the righteous beliefs of our forefathers.
@SenBobCorker Senator, I a lifelong Democrat, have watched and listened to your thoughts and advice during your Senatorial profession. No longer! Sir I pray Mr. Kavanaugh is Not seated on our Highest Court.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends Why are you going to try to now break my right speaker like you tried with my left speaker yesterday! Sir I now Never care to see you on the television again!
@SenBillNelson Thank you for your honest actions sir, America requires an unbiased and thoughtful person on our Highest Court!
@SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems America saw his answer. I believe this man somehow bought his way into the profession of the practice of a Governing Judge.
@SenatorDurbin Sir, America watched your requests. I also felt he took a swallow of water every time he stated a lie. And he drank a lot of water today.
@SenBlumenthal Senator, I ask somehow you may somehow keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. My own Senator, Mitch McConnel would obviously burn this request. My children and grandchildren cry for a fair impartial mind to insure our forefathers voice for America.
@robreiner And Rob your %100 percent correct!
@MichaelSteele Thank you for your position. A FBI investigation must be  conducted. Right now he can't recall how much beer he drank.
@NormEisen Norm I personally pray this Country will listen to Dr. Ford's testimony.  This man cannot receive a lifetime appointment to Govern this country, in fact my belief now is that Kavanaugh should be stripped of his Practice as a Judge!
@SenBobCasey Thank you Senator your statement and beliefs are commendable.
@HardballChris Thank you Chris! Yes Ms Ford is a Breath of Fresh Air. I feel why the Senate happens to try to hammer Ms Ford's fear of flying only emphasizes Ms Ford's credibility. I too fear flying since that mode of travel is not a common practice for myself.
@washingtonpost I ask that an investigation start regarding this attack and any or all additional attacks.
@DanRather Mr. Rather my answer, is no, it probably will not clarify a drunken night more than 30 years ago. Now with 3 more claims of misconduct, Mr. Kavanaugh should not only be appointed to our highest court, but I believe he should be stripped of his current appointment!
@DanRather Most of America prays that this "Bombshell" will finally sink this man. Again and again I have stated my total disregard and opposition to this man's appointment to the Supreme Court.
@funder @realDonaldTrump 58 seconds of beauty. Oh how America cries for his leadership today!
@ChrisCoons Senator, thank you. I, my wife and grandchildren all believe that Mr. Kavanaugh must not sit on our Highest Court of this land. And please note, I previously provided the connotation for Kavanaugh as Honorable. Sir this man is NOT honorable.
@dcexaminer Senator Blumenthal, I ask for your vote to block Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. Today's allegations by a third women regarding sexual misconduct is three times to many for this man to sit on our Highest Court!
@davidaxelrod @GOP David let's pray its disastrous!
@Acosta The Third Women! Come on America. Stand up. Kavanaugh cannot sit in the highest court in our land and determine how our grandchildren shall live! 		Make your voice clearly heard to your Senator!
@RepJoeKennedy I agree
@dcexaminer Well Senator, it's now stated Kavanaugh's ambition in high school was to drink 100 kegs of beer and expose himself to as many women as possible. I would think than can leave some lasting stains.
@SRuhle @JonahNRO @MSNBC Stephanie what's your thought's on Rob Rosensensteiin's possible exit by the White House?
@SenBlumenthal Senator I ask that you cast my vote to reject Judge Kavanaugh's selection to the Supreme Court. My children and grandchildren must have a fair and impartial Judicial person to provide life changing decisions in our country.
@dcexaminer I ask the Senate to reject Judge Kavanaugh's selection as a Supreme Court Judge. My grandchildren must have an impartial and Honest Judicial person who can render non-partisan decisions sanctifying the laws as founded by our forefathers!
@SenGillibrand Thank you Senator!!!!
@JackieScott14 @robreiner Thank you Senator for providing insurance to the American public that my granddaughters may live with the safe freedoms that America was founded upon!
Secretary Clinton,		With more than 49 years of voting experience in our great country of the United States, I can think of only Two former Republican Presidents that have provided government principles for All of America and not just the financial few!  https://t.co/Ljc5SJujjq
@MedicVet68 @hemipanther I agree!
@RealDonaldTrFan Sir how about the other 329,990,000 other Americans who find it difficult to put food on their table.
@TheCatsPause247 I believe we should make it into the top 20 not the the top 25!
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump I never have trusted this fellow.
@SRuhle @TheOnion Stephanie count me as one who found this broadcast dumbfounding also! I'm 67 years old and I can emphatically state I never attempted an act reportedly preformed by Judge Kavanaugh.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Stephanie I'm a 67 year old man who has been blessed with two girls and one boy for 40 years. My only wife certainly understands my disgust of someone like Judge Kavanaugh. I ask the Senate to reject this man's selection to our highest court.
@j_m_santiago It is just unbelievable that Dr. Blaisy-Ford is being subjected to the horrible newscasts now being aired across America. Ms Sandra Ford Mendler, her sister-in-law has honestly presented Dr. Blaisy-Ford's beliefs and honest accounts regarding Judge Kavanaugh.
@Sydd_wolf @mia_wiley98 Yes it does along with a nice hot sauce!
@PaulBrown_UK @Browns @SkySports @BBCSport @ESPNCleveland @FoxNews Congrats. We all hope the 1980's are back! We need to watch the Browns carry the victory flag in February 	of '19! The country cries for the Browns to finally say we are Super Bowl Champs!
@MSNBC Obviously this man can no longer remember when he cruised the streets of New York when he was 17 or possibly he does. What scared 15 year old girl know how to contact police officials or even notify her parents of a possible rape act.
@SRuhle @InStyle Stephanie, I'm currently watching your broadcast today. Please ask your panel what "15 year old, male or female, would not only bury a horrendous act of possible rape, they would be also fearful of their very parents regarding such an act!".
@Amy_Siskind I agree Amy, America must stop this man.
@SophiaLamar1 @thinkprogress And so stupid!
@tedlieu @honestyquest Yes Sir your Congressman. Please add my name, Michael Schenck, to the list asking for accountability to Judge Kavanaugh's past.
@SenWarren Senator I, Michael Schenck, also request a full investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh's past. He will assist in determining my great grandchildren's rule of life! We need a full accounting of his life not just a snippet.
@JoyceWhiteVance The Country should support her. I'm sure it has taken every waking breath of courage to publicly share her horrendous episode
@JohnWDean Mr. Dean, I find your comments, essays and public statements honestly sound, thoughtfully presented and enjoyable to hear. Thank you.
@UKFootball @TerryTouchdown3 @MikeHartline1 Terry, you are continuing the excitement of Big Blue Football in our Wildcat Country. Awesome game this past Saturday. Thanks for making "Big Blue" your color of choice!
@DanRather Mr. Rather# I remember way back during the Vietnam War you reported from the actual front lines as bullets whistled by your position. I went to college rather than wait for my draft number to be called. You reported truth then as you do now!
@thehill Anderson, thank you for your consistency of reported truthfulness throughout your lifetime of broadcasting. I look forward to many more years of your continual coverage of current events throughout the world.
@ChrisCoons Senator, I respect your comments regarding Judge Kavanaugh's possible "attempt of rape" 36 years ago. I sir, Michael Schenck, ask that you please lead the task to abort Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
@robreiner Thank you Rob, please add myself, Michael Schenck, to vote Kavanaugh down.
@CynthiaAlksne Cynthia, I thoroughly agree with your MSNBC statement; "see the if Kavanaugh will take a lie detector exam and ask him if he tried to accost the now informed lady and did he lie on the witness stand".
@AC360 @andersoncooper Anderson I just watched your telecast regarding the poor fool's claim you were kneeling in water for a broadcast regarding the flooding in North Carolina. I wonder if the poor fool has ever suffered through an actual flood!
@ChrisCoons Thank you Senator!
@ChrisCoons Senator, I ask for your direction, support and possibly lead to first extend this man's hurriedly confirmation to our highest court. I personally believe Judge Kavanaugh has been given opportunities that "normal" hard working Americans have dreamed of!
@SenFeinstein Senator, thank you for your statement. Senator though I live in a "Red" State, I have voted Blue my whole life. Senator your public comments now strengthen my personal beliefs in our due process of elections.
@imillhiser @AinsTx I have, since the beginning of his Senate hearings, asked that he be barred from holding a seat on our most high court.
@kwelkernbc Kristen the Senate cannot appoint an accused individual to our highest court in our land. My grandchildren require a fair and bi-partisan voice in America!
@SenFeinstein Senator, again please abort Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. With the serious allegations presented by Ms Brown my great grandchildren deserves a fair judicial mind on our highest court.
@politico Why
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce I personally enjoy your comments on the various life important issues you address. 		Thank you,	Michael Schenck
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce, I just watched your remarks today regarding Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. Now with questions arising to his moral character, I repeat my concerns, he will provide negative legal ramifications onto my great grandchildren!
@JoyceWhiteVance Thanks Joyce, we all must voice our concerns regarding Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court!
@SRuhle @ClubVelshiRuhle @MSNBC @VelshiRuhle @AliVelshi Stephanie, I question which storm will be more devastating, Florence or Manafor! My concern, Manafort's devious dealings will still impact my great, great grandchildren's freedoms in this great land.
@RonWyden Sir I, Michael Schenck, ask for your power and vote to protect my children's, grandchildren and great grandchildren's freedoms by blocking Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court!
@ToddRuger @BrettKavanaugh I, Michael Schenck, Lexington, Kentucky ask Sir for directive to abort Judge Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. My children, grandchildren and great grandchildren must enjoy the freedoms this great Country still have for life!
@SRuhle @WillieNelson Glad you will play Willie.
@Matsamon @DawnMorey2 My God, if true we have to reexamine the powers of the police system.
@AinsTx @JoyceWhiteVance @BetoForCongress My best friend, my former next door neighbor lives in Ft. Worth. I personally have performed many projects thru out Texas. I love your great State and I'm excited at the possibility that it will flow blue.
@SenWhitehouse Thank you sir, it's my pleasure to have someone in the Senate that I feel serves to protect the week.
@ChrisCoons Please, your Honorable Senators, listen to the American majority to block Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.	Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@JohnWDean @honestyquest John I enjoy your comments on CNN. And now I find your posts intriguing as well. I hope you continue for years to come. Stay safe.
@AliVelshi @ClubVelshiRuhle Ali, thank you for your commitment to various "on-site" fact based reporting to current events. America is blessed with your concerns and beliefs in truthfulness.
@SRuhle @InStyle No, no, NO Stephanie, thank you. Thank you, for your daily truthful reporting. Your loving inflicted truthfulness of daily newscasts when this Country needs to understand the pain carried by "Current News"!
@AinsTx @JoyceWhiteVance Hey, it's wonderful to see a Red-State articulated gal speak the reasons, the truthfulness and life concerns of the blue wave!
@ABC The kids will be caught. The kids should be taught something regarding human feelings, human beliefs to help one another.
@gschweitzer @ConfuciusX8 I'll follow!
@tonyposnanski Thank you and here here!
@RealDonaldTrFan Really! Rain is wet?
@RepAdamSchiff American citizens must stand and protest this administration.
@tomberryiii @HardballChris @JohnKerry Put a shirt on Mr. Berry. Maybe your comment will wear better.
RT @tomberryiii: @MichaelSchenck9 @HardballChris @JohnKerry If you haven’t missed an episode of @HardballChris you absolutely have no life,…
@EricHolder Mr. Holder, sorry. Somehow the "r" escaped my initial post regarding your "voice" in the White House.
@Comey @jannsloan Thanks.
@EricHolder M. Holder many Americans would, require, your voice once again in the White House.
@monk1551 @SenBooker @LunaLuvgood2017 I agree!
@HardballChris @JohnKerry Thank you again Chris. In January of 17 my wife, a very beautiful women, told me I should watch your show. Chris I have Not missed an episode since and certainly look forward to tonight.
@AsleyElissa Well thanks Asley. I always enjoy making new friends and having different people to text with.

@CNNTonight @donlemon Thank you for your support of my personal beliefs also! America needs to wake up
@SenatorDurbin Senator, I Michael Schenck, Lexington, Kentucky, oppose Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. I ask for your Leadership in an effort to block his appointment!
@robreiner Please Rob, America needs, requires your assistance to stabilize the Executive Office!
@RepSwalwell Senator Booker
@SenatorDurbin This is not 1918, it's 2018! How can true Americans accept this treatment of children and families of South America what Nazi Germany presented to the Jewish Society in 1922!
@SteveSchmidtSES Steve I thoroughly enjoy your comments expounded nightly across MSNBC. Thank you.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@SenatorLeahy Senator this man consistently lies.
@MichaelSteele @KamalaHarris @SenatorLee_cmc Mr. Steele Judge Kavanaugh has many dark secrets in his past that he continues to avoid during his confirmation Hearing. Why must American Citizens, our children and our grandchildren accept a Judge who has "lied" during his confirmation hearing!
@JoyceWhiteVance I personally believe the Senate Confirmation Hearings for Kavanaugh have degraded the Country's Democratic process of Law. Why is Kavanaugh's full history of Case Law not available for Committee review?
@nytimes Thank you. We all know it was courageous to publish editorial.
@thehill Senator Schumer I agree with your fight to abort Kavanaugh's seat onto our highest court in America. 	Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@ChrisCoons Senator Coons, I, Michael Schenck, Lexington, Kentucky agree with your statement. The American people need someone who is totally candor with their past to seat themselves onto our highest court of the land.
@SenatorDurbin Senator, please note, my observance of Kavanaugh's answers to various questions, he consistently has stated untrue answers. His face begins to turn red during an answer which bears reasonable thought to his truthfulness.
@SenatorDurbin Senator I'm totally opposed to Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. He has provided several untruths and purposely have tried to change the question posed to him!
@tackettdc @alexburnsNYT Thank you Sir. Our Country certainly needs, requires, your Honesty and Leadership qualities today and for my grandchildren's freedoms.
@billprady @rmayemsinger Yes I think we did. When he states a known lie or a fact that is not within his belief, his face turns red!
@McFaul Michael please begin a run in public office. We need to someho right the ship of Democracy!

@KamalaHarris This man just stated in the Supreme Court hearing of his appointment to the highest court in our land that "The President could Not be subpoena to a Court of Law".		Geez, he thinks a President is above our laws!
@AC360 @carlbernstein Yes, I'm personally disturbed. What damage and what sacrifice has this Country suffered through Trump's Presidency and now the possible report of our weakness?
@SenatorDurbin Yes, Tomorrow!
@SenatorDurbin Senator, sir thank you for your questions within Judge Kavanaugh's hearing. You have stated my very concerns regarding the Honorable Kavanaugh's confirmation to this lifetime post. It is imperative that All of his past rulings have adequate time for review.
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse Disrespectful interruptions from individuals inside Judge Kavanaugh's current judiciary hearing is not only disrespectful, it exemplifies this Country's lack of courtesy and Law itself.
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse This hearing must be postponed until adequate time can be allowed for All Americans to review Judge Kavanaugh's history regarding his confirmation to a lifetime seat for this Country's highest Court!
@ChrisCoons I question why every disruption has been instigated by a female protestor. Cannot everyone accept the founding rules as outlined by our fathers of the constitution?
@ChrisCoons I sir, a lifetime Democrat, cannot condone the consistent disruptions being condoned inside the Senate hearings regarding the Honorable Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to our highest Court in this great land. Judicial decorum must be adhered in the greatest judicatory land I know!
@PattyMurray Senator all American Constituents require your voice to sound the concerns of the contentious Kavanaugh Judicial hearing. Are we not still a "Democratic" society, all with an equal voice?
@BillClinton Thank you Mr. President.
@SenWhitehouse It is wonderful to memorialize a true hero.
@mitchellnicola @DawnMorey2 @realDonaldTrump Wow! It's so nice to see how this man extends America's friendly welcome to the world!
@rebeccagberg Thank you Ms Berg and special thanks to hopefully our next President Joe Biden!
@UKFootball Yes and Yes and yes. We all back our Wildcats and Coach Stoops!
@MikeLupica Why demoralize a University any further than what they suffered yesterday! I happen to be a True Blue Fan, yet cannot condone any childish act by anyone.
@JoyceWhiteVance @flwrman For the respect of the man that this Country, the world, has honored this past week we all must act as Joyce has stated.
@MollyMcKew @GManfan64 @SenJohnMcCain No Molly, Our Lord and Savior cried with tears of joy!
@PacePacee @dcexaminer Why?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Yes!
@DanRather Thanks. This day should be part of all future history books and part of required reading by all high school freshman!
@superlorna69 @rmayemsinger Agree. And I'm watching Mrs. McCain listening to Danny Boy while she checks her phone.
@NBCPolitics All Americans have to rise up and remove this man's golf ball. A man who fought for our Freedom is currently being memorialized in America's historical journals by Americans of greater Statue than this man will ever achieve!
@dcexaminer Megan I know your father sits in Heaven and shrugged our Savior in the arm and said "that's my Daughter"! Well done. We all loved your Father.
@AliVelshi Unbelievable! How can this man still believe he should sit in the historical Oval Office while this Nation, the entire World memorialize John McCain's life. The last American Hero this Country so dearly loved!
@CBSNews Beautiful for this Country's time of tribulations.
@robreiner Yes Rob. Everyone in this country, the Great United States, a country that today eulogized an American Hero, must utilize their Power and Vote. Vote for your children and their children. Vote for Freedom!
@ChrisCoons Vote NO!
@kasie @jack My God! Someone needs to get that guy's computer! Quick!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain Well Mr. Graham, thank you for a respectable farewell to the only War Hero that I have known in my 67 years on this earth. No one may never have governed this Nation as President better than Kennedy in my lifetime.		Farewell Sir. Smooth sailing forevermore!
@ClubVelshiRuhle 		Guys I'm huge fan of your broadcast. Your statement regarding how this year's wage increases are negated by the cost of living's increase is somewhat erroneous. What about retirees living on a fixed disbursement!
@ClubVelshiRuhle
@Dax_x98 @ConfuciusX8 Geez! Well I question what these same individuals would say if they so happen to have the despicable act performed on themselves!
@JeffFlake @kyrstensinema @RepMcSally Well I've always have stated my wife governs my household far better than myself. Butt I'll repeat myself sir, America will still miss your wise voice on all needs requiring our safety and fortitude in this great United States.
@JoyceWhiteVance Yes Joyce! Americans, both sides of the Aisle, must and basically are required to protect our free speech!
@NBCNightlyNews @kevtibs It is so nice and, well, God directed that "good" news can be posted today.

@TRafaelCimino @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Thanks T Rafael
@Morning_Joe @SenFlakeStaff @JeffFlake Senator, though I reside out of your voting district, I wain to your future disregard to maintain your seat in the Senate. Sir I respectfully ask that you please maintain your voice in the House of the Senate for the better of all America!
@CNNSitRoom Well CNN just reported that Trump has ordered the White House Flag to once again be lowered to the 	half-mast position respecting the passing of our last true American hero.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Thank you Scott. This Country begs for truth, honesty and morality.
@MSNBC This man should not be allowed in the same office where so many great men once sat.
@HardballChris Thank you Chris. There are very few Hero's of stamina that I can recount in my 67 years on this earth that can follow in his footsteps. God's house is now blessed with his presence.
@JeffreyGoldberg @kurteichenwald God is not part of Trump's vocabulary. How can "Honor" be expected from this White House?
@tombrokaw Tom thank you, thank you and Mr. Brokaw thank you. Sir I'm 67 years old and I personally cannot determine Trump's childish regard to the passing of this war Hero! You on the other hand deserve the honor of Mr. aforementioned to your God given name.
@kasie @SenJohnMcCain Thank you Kasie
@MichaelAvenatti Michael		I'm supporting your case(s) against Trump. Though I think you should let the Internet rest in remembrance of John McCain this weekend!
@JoeBiden Joe thank you so much for your heartfelt memoir for John McCain. May I also plead for your submission to run for the upcoming Presidential Election.
@JohnBrennan Thank you Sir for a very fitting memoir.
@JeffFlake @SenFlakeStaff Senator I too, as so many true Americans, carry a heavy heart with the passing of a true American hero. I ask sir that you please maintain your seat within the Senate. Our Country requires the honesty and loyalty that you provide.
@JeffFlake Senator, I too mourn the passing of a true and great American. I also mourn your upcoming departure from the Senate. Sir your departure will be felt across America. I ask that you please reconsider your past direction and continue your great leadership.
@SRuhle Stephanie, thank you for your poignancy. And yes I too pray that somehow we can return to the years of Kennedy, Obama and now John McCain. Pray we all will see Joe Biden in 2020!
@BillKristol Thank you Bill.
@MichaelSteele @cindymccain @SenJohnMcCain Thank you Michael for your thoughts and thank you Cindy for your loving posts for our last living hero.
@kylegriffin1 Dear Honorable Goodlatte,	Please accept this post as my agreement with the Judiciary Democrats to protect Mr. Mueller's probe and any "possible abuse" of pardon power by Trump.	Michael Schenck	Kentucky
@DanRather @lauriecrosswell Dan I believe the Majority of Americans await a quick solution for the removal of Trump from the office he now holds.
@ShinobiNinja Wonderful! In this day of trumpism' this Country needs your voice sounding across America every day!
@robreiner Thank you so much for your daily posts of true reality. I pray your voice never becomes silent.
@nora_kelly @JeffreyGoldberg Nora, we all should not forget about Roger Stone. Do prison cells now offer a "3" bed establishment?
@hardball @HardballChris Chris, America awaits the release of this book. I'm guessing your completion of this journal must await the daily changes within this White House.
@JohnJHarwood Know what? I personally will avoid his comments every time now. I will mute the episode if he appears or as in this case I fail to click on the post.
@AlbertBrooks Wonderful Albert!
@MetalConcertApp This man needs serious mental medical help.
@axios Wow! This man should finally understand that retirement to his bedroom may salvage his history.
@RepJoeKennedy My Lord! How can America allow this to happen!
@GMA @MichelleObama WOW! Thank you Michelle! And please allow me to address you by your Given name since my given name, Michael, certainly strikes similarities!
@JohnBrennan Mr. Brennan, like our forefathers stated nearly 2020 years ago, YOUR freedom of speech is not only allowed but certainly required during this dictatorial time in our history!
@Amy_Siskind All true Free Americans agree.
@EricHolder How can we start the removal process of this autocratic and imperialistic person who currently occupies our Country's White House!
@nypost We all hope your health remains strong Joe. The Country needs and requires your immediate direction!
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan We all have to begin the process of removing this maniac from OUR Oval Office! John Brennan presents two human traits that Trump cannot-truth and honesty!
@UKCoachCalipari And Coach we all are proud of them too. The Blue Nation of America looks forward to the upcoming season!

@RepAdamSchiff Dear Representative Schiff please pursue the course of justice for the United States. Donald Trump must not be allowed to try to Govern our laws.
@Acosta Wow, what was handed to this crowd prior to Jim's appearance?
@hardball Wow and wow, can hard working America continue to withstand this man's rape of what wealth we still have?

@RepAdamSchiff Mr. Schiff I was born in Louisville, Kentucky obviously the same city that the leader of the Senate currently resides in. Sir I personally ask for all of your support, direction and fortitude to somehow begin the removal process of our current President.
@funder @realDonaldTrump America has to defend it's rule of law, it's righteous desire of freedom and God's teaching of love.

@SRuhle Oh how I agree!
@thehill Senator you have a residence in Louisville and I live in Lexington. Senator I ask for your support. Vladimir Putin must be barred from the White House. Countless American lives have been loss defending this great Country from the tyranny that this man represents.
@TheBeatWithAri @DavidCornDC My God!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator Schumer this must not happen!!! How can we invite our enemy to dinner! What is wrong with this man?
@SenWarren @Novartis @realDonaldTrump I personally live on a fixed social security income and still have a mortgage to pay. Drug costs rival my food costs and I know I'm not alone in this country concerned about rising costs!
@MarkWarner Senator every American must follow Mr. Coats and contact every Senator to begin the process of removing Mr. Trump from office!
@MichaelAvenatti @publicjustice Michael I admire every word you just posted! I pray for their lives as well as for every American. How can we remove Mr. Trump from his office? The very freedom of every American is currently under attack with this Administration.
@StephenAtHome Guys if you replay the video of his throw, it almost hit The First Lady in her chest area.
@CBSNews As a former business owner for more than 40 years I commend the business owner and I can proud to say we live in America!
@DavidCornDC @hardball Can't wait.
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey though I'm a pure Democrat by heart for the past 49 voting years, I've admired your political advice for the past few years until today. How can you now support this President after his "2 step" yesterday with Putin?
@robreiner Everyone must make contact with Senators and House of Representatives, voice their disheartening concerns and demand action to protect our Freedoms and our children's Freedoms.
@HardballChris Both of our Governmental investigating agencies (FBI &amp; CIA) must secure the translation notes from Trump and Putin's meeting this morning in Helsinki! America's freedom, lifestyle and fundamental Democracy is in serious jeopardy !
@MittRomney @dandrezner Senator the Senate must subpoena Trump's conversation with Putin!
@MarkSalter55 @jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain Oh I agree!!!
@DemGovs I've signed it earlier. I would sign it everyday if I could.
@HardballChris Thank you Chris, I'm watching your show right now. What a day to come back with what happened in Helsinki! How can we correct the current leadership of our Great Country?
@NBCPolitics And you know, I don't have any dirt in my front yard!
@TIME Senator oh how I wish your health could resurrect and propel your leadership to the White House. The current President today repealed his Oath of Office to hold this great United States above all adversaries.
@RepJoeKennedy @tribelaw @realDonaldTrump Yes !
@thehill Finally Mr. McConnell I can agree with your thinking.
@JohnKasich @hardball @MSNBC @HardballChris @CNN @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @POTUS Thank you
@jxcamp @thehill Here here
@DeniseGundelfi1 @JoeBiden I basically posted the same message a month ago.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Stephanie I watch you every workday morning. Why? Because of your astute comments especially ones regarding this current President!
@Lawrence And what I've ever seen either!
@thehill I agree, agree, AGREE!
@MarkWarner Senator Warner, thank you for your quick reaction to today's comments by Trump. I can only think Trump needs to get his hotel complex started in Moscow!
@LindseyGrahamSC @WillieGeist Aren't we all in America concerned about our future Electoral process in this great nation. I'm personally worried about my grand children's life, their children's freedom and the basic advantages afforded to everyone in this great Nation! And so sickened by Helsinki.
@AltonCM @SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Carol I so heartily agree with your posting.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump How can American citizens hold Trump up as President of this great nation after even the so little bit of information shown regarding this mornings Helsinki's Summit!
@JohnKasich @SRuhle Speaking as a Democrat for my entire voting life, nearing 50 years, I agree entirely sir with your statement today regarding President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin.
@thehill Horrible
@morningmika @realDonaldTrump Mika I personally watch you and Joe every morning. Obviously I enjoy your reporting regarding the news that is important to America. May I ask at what time do you start a typical work day?
@BillNeelyNBC @MSNBC As already stated, it's a Sunday Morning Miracle!
@BillNeelyNBC @MSNBC Thank you Bill for your on site postings regarding the Thai Cave rescue!
@Pontifex Father it is being reported as of 9:30 EST that four boys have successfully been removed from the cave in Thailand. The world prays to our Lord for the safety and survival of all remaining young individuals.
@AmyMcGrathKY @JennaBushHager Amy again and again I marvel with joy your constant reviews and Governmental advice!
@TIME And this man says he believes in God?
@politico I think the White House should somehow become acceptable to the conclusion of reuniting the families torn apart by Trump's Administration!
@WalshFreedom @RadioFreeTom Joe I whole heartedly agree with your response; it is very sad as to what people think of a leader of the strongest nation in this world that "lying" is ok!
@VoteMarsha @realDonaldTrump And fuel more violence like Virginia!
@BetteMidler @BetteMidler8 Bette thank you, thank you and thanks. We need open minded people to govern Kentucky more than we have since the Civil War! Only Democratic minded individuals should apply in this typical Republican State!
@robreiner Rob I watch MSNBC and CNN every day. Your voice regarding our current State of Democracy is an important word all Americans should listen to with true diligence.
@CNNPolitics Senator Warren, though I'm limited with mobility and I live on a very strict financial budget please note I support all of your endeavors. Please keep up your fine work.
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews What in the world is wrong with you? Jim was stuck in the back of the crowd! How else could he ever have had any chance of the President addressing his concerns!!!
The Twitter Rules https://t.co/ED8RpoIh7m		Why is my tweets suspended with Pope Francis?		Account concerning:		Michael Schenck
@1NadineSmith This twitter post reeks with distaste for that city employee.
@AmyMcGrathKY Amy count on a vote by me, Michael Schenck, Lexington, KY. I'm slightly disabled right now so I can't offer much physical help. I do speak very highly of you to everyone. I pray that your office phone will move from Georgetown to Washington this November.
@356ettt @thehill What is wrong with you? Children can read and probably better than you. Express your beliefs with a civil tongue. People across the world can read your remarks.
@CNNPolitics Mr. President we all miss your review and wise conscious regarding the current affairs of America. Wouldn't it be wonderful if somehow Joe Biden would announce his candidacy for Presidency and you somehow were named his Vice-President. Can that possibly happen?
@thehill Trey Gowdy must have lost his memory and/or forgot how to read. The Bin Gaze investigation, of which he was part of, took more than 2 years before a partial report was released.
@CBSNews Our Government and the people of America HAS to do something with mass killing in this great land of America. Why? Why are people killing each other? The Capital Gazette printed today "Speechless".
@thehill President Obama, please provide a more public response to our country's current problems and concerns. Our Country now needs your guidance more than when you were in the White House.
@CNNPolitics Do we, as most of the world, also question President Trump's understanding of truth telling!
@thehill How can anyone make such a derivative and such child like statement like this man!
@ABC Ms Wood I'm behind you. Please keep all of your work, discoveries and requests for public assistance in the news fronts.
@SenWarren Senator Warren, I ask as born American, your assistance to the correct treatment and human decency that should be afforded to all people who seek asylum within our country. Families must remain as an intact family.	Thank you,	Michael Schenck
@treyradel What in the world is wrong in your mind?
@robreiner Yes, yes, YES!
@megynkelly I most certainly agree
@SenJohnMcCain The world should have always known President Trump's alliance with Russia.
@ABC How can this man believe he is a christian!
@Comey James I really believe in most of your published views. Please provide me of your current work involvements, attitudes, etc.	Thank you,	Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@WillieGeist Willie please help me also. After you get your ship, send me what's left over. My retirement benefits are not anything to live off. Thanks.
@washingtonpost Any God loving and True American should never kneel during the playing of the National Anthem. How many lives have been sacrificed for the playing of this beautiful piece of work!
@AmyMcGrathKY Amy you have continued the "Women's March" here in Kentucky. Congrats to a much deserved Victory. I look forward to your upcoming victory in November!
@MatoKuwapi @KristophKnudsen @tasneemunited @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorReid @WhiteHouse You are exactly right! This man never Governed by his Party but by the heart of America.
@chucktodd I watched Paul Manafort this morning (5/4/18) walking through the courthouse grounds for a hearing regarding his legal battles. This morning he displayed his true feelings for his wife by hurriedly moving in front of her and never once assisting her while they walked.
@SRuhle 👇👇👇👇👇❌❌❌
@MSNBC I hope not!
@UKCoachCalipari Well it's good to hear Coach that's it "all good". Get well soon. 	Michael Schenck 	B of Architecture 	Class of 74
@JoeJ2009 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Profits!!!!
@JebBush @TheBushCenter Everyone in America should have the opportunity to be able to "read"!
@JebBush @TheBushCenter Though raised as a democrat, I always followed Mrs Bush, with what she was doing and her undying belief in America that everyone should be able to "! This past Tuesday we lost the "Mother" of the United States.
@MSNBC I ask everyone if they can recall when Trump remarked about how many times President O'Bama played golf while he was in office!
@CNN Senator, party politics should not over-ride moral servitude and Governmental direction. You have demonstrated sound decision making policy, please think with the hearts of all Americans before making irrational statements regarding this President!
@chrislhayes Chris I personally enjoy your reporting every evening. Your work is always in demand to watch in my home.
@Acosta @PressSec Sure!
@cnni Senator I, like so many Americans, wish you recovery from your affliction. God is with all of us thru all of our life as you well know. And thru your outstanding service to this Country everyone wishes you a safe journey to happiness.
@ABC Mr. Bevin I feel you must have been sexually abused during your school days to make such a mis-informed statement about missing classroom study!
@MSNBC @TheRevAl Joe I personally would love to see you run. I pray that the Democratic Party will see the shining light you can once again provide to this Country!
@Pontifex Thank you your Highness. We Americans need your prayers more and more everyday.
@AlisonForKY This man seems to continually state and sometimes create nonsense!
@MSNBC Evil must be removed from society. It may take Military action against someone who uses chemical attacks on men, women and children!
@ABC Please please someone in this child's school must help!
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/LireudCKhB
@AmyMcGrathKY Amy please start talking about your views, what you believe in, and how can we in Kentucky benefit from your leadership!
@ABC Senator McCain has dutifully stated the World's concerns and disgusting lawlessness which exists in Syria! The United States need to lead a charge in correcting the horrible atrocities which afflict the Syrian society.
@UKCoachCalipari Coach please try to keep him! His stock will climb tenfold after a second season under your hand of guidance!
@HardballChris America needs leadership NOW! https://t.co/bW3ATvUG8t
@CNN  https://t.co/1wRjM8qnq7
@ABC Please provide the "rest" or continual information regarding this terrible accident and the Troopers rehabilitation.
@JoyAnnReid @DLoesch To all of America how can we, a God Loving people, move thru our daily activities and NOT now consider Legislation regarding arms for mass killing! Joy please, thru your platform speak to our Government Leaders regarding to the True understanding of our 2nd Amendment Right!

@UKCoachCalipari @WenyenGabriel Happy Happy Birthday Wenyen. Hope to again say this to you next year!
@HardballChris Chris this current President states that the reason for the mass killings in this country is due to mental problems! Well we all know the NRA has Trump in their back pocket. This USA should lead the world with tougher gun laws.
@hardball_chris 	Chris our great President states that mass killings are due to mental problems. Certainly not because anyone can buy a gun  for mass killing!
@Pontifex There was a tremendous March today in several major cities around the world your Highness. I personally watched the Youth of America state their concerns in this World Wide March for Lives. Violence in America, wow there are 46 children shot in America everyday!
@washingtonpost No
@UKCoachCalipari Coach you, always a Master took a team dominated by gifted Freshman and again, showed the World what it means to be a "True Blue Wildcat".
Coach, I graduated from UK in 1974. I certainly cannot recall a season such as this season we have the pleasure to experience. I now look forward to a strong #9 Championship. Way to go! https://t.co/qDRhXdPwHT
@realDonaldTrump Gun violence is acceptable to you?
@realDonaldTrump Why aren't you saying anything about the students sitting with their backs facing our beautiful and historic White House?
@ABC Wonderful to see a little one so involved in a musical life and such a loving mother and father who supports him.
@UKCoachCalipari Coach we're all ready for you to paint Boise a Wonderful Wildcat Blue!
@fake_donald_t @realDonaldTrump Wasn't Kelly Anne working with you???
@UKCoachCalipari Coach I agree Boise is a beautiful City. I personally traveled to the city often. I designed many "Albertsons" supermarkets and corporate offices are located in that wonderful town. Let Boise State and the Country see beautiful "Wildcat Blue"!
Happy Birthday Anthony. You know we all still hope you come back to Lexington! https://t.co/kOBxxOOpt6
@hoopshype Who was the player who committed the horrible foul at the bucket? I agree with whoever, that player should never be allowed to play another organized basketball game.
@realDonaldTrump Obviously the World looks forward to your meeting and a possible momentous period of history!
@VictoriaJustice Thank you for posting this clip. All animals are certainly smarter than what we give credence to.
@cher It's beyond my rational thinking how any educated individual could ever take the life of such a majestic animal!
Wow! Just another reason why no one stays at the White House to work! https://t.co/csYtvhw9FR
@CharlieDaniels Yeah your part of the elite not the common. We "commoners need protection.
@UKCoachCalipari Coach I just sent our Lord a small prayer for Tyris. I really don't know him but he obviously is a child of God who must have touched many lives.	Michael Schenck
@KeithUrban Keith		You know God provides us all with special gifts. Your voice and musical training now provides the world with art and enjoyment that even God must be pleased with!	Thank you for sharing your gift with the world.		Mike Schenck
@UKCoachCalipari Coach the "And Brave Men, Too" certainly wets my appetite too! I happen to be 67 years old. I had a draft number of either 13 or 19; I can't quit recall. My Mother did everything she could so that I could attend UK in 1969 and become "Blue to The Bone"
@CBSNLive What happened to teaching one and another what our Lord stated long, long ago, "Love thy Neighbor as you Love Yourself".
CBSN Live https://t.co/Q0dXzdYd2m via @CBSNLive		MSNBC stated this morning the USA far exceeds all other Countries with gun related murders each year.	This was part of their report regarding what classrooms are teaching for safety precautions during a normal school classroom day.
BEAUTIFUL https://t.co/2fxtnnk2tD
@DonaldJTrumpJr I'm so sorry Mr. President, I meant to say your Son and Daughter-Law.
@DonaldJTrumpJr 🖖
@DonaldJTrumpJr I don't agree most often with what you say President Trump, yet I do whole heartily agree with your statement regarding your child and son-in-law. People who perform such dangerous acts will hopefully suffer the full effects of our law!
@chloekimsnow 		Chloe		Congratulations! There's nothing I can ever say to your accomplishment. You are now someone who many young women look to emulate someday!		Great job. Relax and enjoy your made History!		Mike Schenck	Kentucky
Fallon is so right! It's time for all of us to find the "time" to love each other and work for peace around the world! https://t.co/2fxtnnk2tD
@Pontifex Thank you so much your Holy Father! It is so wonderful that you, our guiding light, can speak to the world with it's current technology.	Michael Schenck 	Lexington KY	USA
