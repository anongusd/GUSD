@influx_Divine You as well Sir I‚Äôm calling it a night on here thank you for speaking with me
@influx_Divine Correct and I can not tell you how I knew it many things just come to me with a deep state of understanding
@influx_Divine You are so correct Sir half of what you just typed also played in my headphones as I listen to an old Don Francisco song
@influx_Divine Hence we are reborn and born again in His Salvation
@influx_Divine I think it goes back to ‚Äúconjugal love‚Äù
@influx_Divine From my studies I have found that Angels being former humans have a little jealous streak in them as well since they can no longer physically love...
@influx_Divine And please call me Scean (Sean) it is great to find another human just as passionately in Love with The Father, Son and Holy Ghost
@influx_Divine I‚Äôve never considered Glorification an actual physical  process but now as I contemplate it, it becomes more clear that it had to be a physical process for the Resurrection to happen.
@influx_Divine In my eyes a failure to move or act could possibly be very close to sin

@Just7Me And since this information is now public information and since I will be having to represent myself in the 4 all claims suits now in process. Anyone got a ‚ÄúSuit‚Äù I can borrow???
@Just7Me No. Ive been denied SS disability twice and I am getting ready to file again. I am also about to file for California SNAP card for emergency food. But it will take time. My new benifits start Dec 1 so the lightüí°is getting brIghter with time
@Just7Me The second and third were the Sunday before Labor Day just weeks ago. She was held and then let out in bail so I had to pack everything I own move it out and find a way to get all 35 miles down the freeway. She has threatened to get me back for pressing charges
@Just7Me I understand feel your frustration. The only reason i continued to rent then room was I had my own full bathroom no real income till August so I had to scrimp to get by till then.  After the first assault and head injury while she was intoxicated on beer was March.
@Just7Me I have a duty to report abuse neglect or self abuse and neglect. In this case it was all the above. My hands were and still are tied.
@Just7Me Her undergraduate graduate and doctorate are in substance addiction and alcohol abuse. On her last arrest she stated to her public defender that she only took the classs to learn how to get out of these things. As an individual that holds a professional license in the state of CA
@Just7Me With individual there are 4 documented attempts for myself and her friends to arrange for her acceptance into a medical rehab facility. There is no way she could handle going cold turkey and will have to be medically detoxed via iv fluids.

@Just7Me @TVLine Correct, I believe every state will have the program if they don‚Äôt already. I know here AT&amp;T offer the same promotion if you send in a copy of your snap card which I don‚Äôt have or use.
