"Fear is the condom of life" says Oscar winning Director Alejandro G. Inarritu ((Birdman) backstage.  It keeps you from enjoying things.
Best Actor Eddie Redmayne still giddy and making faces backstage while addressing reporters. Was rocking his Oscar in his arms like a baby.
Backstage Julianne Moore said her husband was first to see Still Alice - told her she would win the Oscar. BTW her dress prettier in person
He went from suicidal teen to Oscar winner--Graham Moore's speech for adapted screenplay for The Imitation Game. #inspirational
RT @TheAcademy: RT @BuzzFeed: THAT WAS AMAZING. GAGA!!!!!! http://t.co/dhqDuZwnr1
#Oscar number from Sound of Music : If there was any doubt that Lady Gaga could sing...wow.
Idina Menzel and John Travolta NOT listed in the #Oscar program as presenters. Kept the joke under wraps.
‚Äú@AmyLewisKFBK: @newsbabe1530 @kittykfbk And why was Joan Rivers omitted?‚Äù Not officially in the film industry--but still!!
Was NPH's intro to Jennifer Aniston "who deserves to be here" a veiled reference to her being overlooked for "Cake?" #Oscar
Patricia Arquette talked about the dreaded "mani-cam" at the #Oscars--she didn't get one--had other priorities. Refreshing!
Backstage winner Patricia Arquette says she didn't see  but heard about Meryl Steep's enthusiastic response to her acceptance speech.
The #Oscar announcer just told the audience to refrain from applause during the upcoming "In Memoriam" segment.
The creatively quirky Grand Budapest Hotel with 3 awards now so far. Don't think it will pull in the major ones though.
‚Äú@CarlaMeyerSB: Tell it, Patricia Arquette. And never fix those teeth. #Oscars2015‚Äù I agree Carla--she is a rare breed in Hollywood!
Jennifer Lopez next to Meryl Streep at #Oscars?  Who does the seating chart?
@kittykfbk Best Sup Actress Patricia Arquette from Boyhood wore a dress designed by her best friend from childhood.
First in 25 years and probably last time I'll see an #Oscar host in briefs!  New high or low? I think NPH pulled it off.
Backstage Best Supporting Actor J. K . Simmons says he still won't get on Twitter! But he does believe in phone calls--especially to parents
J-Lo looks like a R-rated Cinderella at the #Oscars
No surprise J.K. Simmons winning Best Supporting Actor for Whiplash. How about the 6000 pearls in presenter Lupita Nyong'o's dress!
#ad Oscar opening nice blend of sentiment and spice. It bodes well for a night led by NPH!
