@blakeney_jc @MsJuneDiane His comeback has sparked a huge debate on whether he should be able to come back to comedy. The #metoo response is that he should not and many men disagree. They refer to the movement as over, so this original tweet was a statement that it is not even close to being over.
@blakeney_jc @MsJuneDiane The timing of the original tweet corresponds with Louis CK's comeback to standup less than a year after he was forced to admit he committed sexual offenses against women for years and intimidated them into silence and leaving their careers.
@blakeney_jc @MsJuneDiane The men who are worried about the #MeToo movement are the ones this tweet was directed toward. Not only are you not an offender, but you are part of the movement to hold offenders accountable and call them out. We need more men like you in the movement.

@RheaButcher I know today's headlines are super scary, but they don't reflect what the court actually did. Keep fighting? Yes, of course. But the court was very careful and continuously acknowledged these fundamental rights in this ruling. Today was not a step backward for civil rights.
@RheaButcher Kennedy concluded that based on strong language by the Commission against relgion in general in the public sphere. I havent read Kagan's opinion yet, but I suggest everyone get into the legal weeds on this case. The ruling hasnt done much legally but kick the can down the road.
@RheaButcher The court didn't conclude much of anything except that the the baker didn't get a neutral hearing from the Colorado Commission. "...whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving facts similar to these, the Commission's actions here violated the Free Exercise Clause."
@GeralynWichers @MarisaKabas @thatpeterfox We need a societal shift. We've been taught that women interact w/one another primarily competitively to seek the attention&amp;favor of men.

@blakeney_jc @PhilBryantMS and paying taxes for law enforcement is considered bearing the burden of others? What about maintenance on roads and bridges? Education? We all benefit from and need these things. Citizens are free to profit from their enterprise w/o worrying about meeting the needs listed above.
@blakeney_jc @PhilBryantMS But we need them though. All of those services are barely functioning. Because theyre not profitable services there is no incentive for the private sector to take them over. How will we have them for the public to use if we the people who use them don't fund them?

I don't know the trends for drug charges. I'm also sure that abuses are rampant, just like in everything else in criminal justice. I complain daily about that. But this video has me scratching my head. I need numbers and cases.
All of my argument is anecdotal, but most of the defendants I know who stay in jail don't stay their bc they can't make their bond. They stay there because their bond has been revoked for a new offense. Or their bond has been set high bc of repeated violence.
I'd really like to see some actual evidence of this. Prosecutors don't set bond/bail amounts. Judges do after argument from both sides. Everyone has a right to a preliminary hearing. The prosecutors I see are careful to say they can't argue for bonds a person can't possibly meet. https://t.co/V8xulNbNed
