@dean_kinslow @TruthStreet2020 @3_elle_tiger @24chadster @RealJamesWoods @tedcruz @BetoORourke I‚Äôve seen #BetoOrourke signs from Dallas-Arlington-Fort Worth to Austin and Houston. I‚Äôve also seen them throughout small towns in west Texas as well as east Texas. Regardless of where you stand, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre exercising your right to vote.
@dean_kinslow @TruthStreet2020 @3_elle_tiger @24chadster @RealJamesWoods @tedcruz @BetoORourke Well I care what all elected officials say especially since they‚Äôre supposed to represent their constituents. From one Texan to another, I respect your opinion. I just happen to disagree with it as well.
@JohnHammon @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I hope he does deliver on established laws but we don‚Äôt know that yet. It‚Äôs the fear that he will not.
