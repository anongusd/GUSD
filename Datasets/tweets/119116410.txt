@accessbank_help For the records, I opened account with Intercontinental Bank &amp; not Access Bank. And all I'm saying is honour my request &amp; close the accounts
@accessbank_help Seriously, contactin me hasn't changed anything &amp; it won't change a thing about the way I feel towards Access Bank. Close my accounts period
@Carl_Ikeme While we are standing by you in our prayers, I wish you good health and long life. #staystrongcarl
@accessbank_help Please @cenbank instruct Access Bank to honour my instructions and close my two accounts with the bank. Enough is enough!!!
@accessbank_help I need you to presume that the Accounts are closed already. Your ample questions are only &amp; really infuriating me. Stop wasting my time pls
@accessbank_help Holy Moses!!! What manner of JAMB questions are these? Kindly close these Accounts and stop bothering me. Infact, I HATE relating with you.
@accessbank_help For the records, I will again state clearly that I asked the bank to close my accounts because of its SHARP PRACTICES and EXORBITANT CHARGES
@accessbank_help @cenbank In 2013, Account Closure Request was submitted at Adeniyi Jones branch and on 22 Nov 2016, I submitted another at Ajose Adeogun branch.
It is so unfortunate that Central Bank of Nigeria @cenbank has so much empowered banks to cheat and exhort Nigerians massively. #ouchSOS
