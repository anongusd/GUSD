If you're a Republican voter looking for an alternative choice to Trump in the 2020 primaries, consider voting for Bill Weld. He's a former Governor who's a moderate and an infinitely better option for President that Trump. https://t.co/jcjpQHNZw7

Trump ran in a major party, not as an independent. The most successful independent presidential candidate was Perot in 1992. He received 18.5% less of the vote than H. W. Bush, who also lost. If @HowardSchultz runs as an independent, it is all but certain he will lose. https://t.co/w1Ts6mTKdz
