The Trump administration is setting up a panel to deny climate change facts that almost all scientists agree on at a time when we can't afford to be silent in our response to climate change. This is NOT the path forward. https://t.co/YaDezMA1kc
Elections matter. For the last 6 years, the American people have been denied the opportunity to have their voices heard in the House on sensible gun safety bills. That changed today.
So proud of my colleagues in the House, especially my good friend and Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chair @RepThompson for his leadership and perseverance over the last 6 years to get today’s important legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales passed.
After years of inaction, the House is set to vote on 2 gun violence prevention measures: H.R. 8 (universal background checks) &amp; H.R. 1112 (to close the Charleston loophole). I urge you to contact your representatives and encourage them to pass these bills. https://t.co/fqymSzMZVL

These numbers are heartbreaking: Gun violence is the second most common cause of death among children in the US, according to one recent study. Another found that 85% of children 12 or younger who were shot to death from 2003 to 2013 were killed in a home. https://t.co/OlBAG9FJUi

My heart goes out to the love of John's life, his wife and my friend, @RepDebDingell, and to the Dingell family and his many friends and admirers. We will miss you John. You were one of a kind. https://t.co/yxyffGguzp
We lost a great American last week with the passing of John Dingell. John was a giant, but also a wonderful friend and mentor. He taught me to "know your district, and vote your district." We could use more of that in Congress these days.
The bill would require the VA to conduct a study exploring this claim while ensuring the website is in accordance with federal guidelines. With the passage of this bill, we can take the steps necessary to address these concerns and ensure equal access for all veterans.
I often hear from disabled and visually impaired veterans that they cannot access the VA website, despite federal law that requires accessibility for all. I am pleased to announce the VA Website Accessibility Act that I introduced passed the House today with bipartisan support. https://t.co/hJqGPSvc9K

While a bump stock ban is an important step, President Trump continues to suggest that teachers should be armed. The long-awaited Trump Administration School Safety Commission Report does the bidding of the NRA and scapegoats civil rights protections as a cause of mass shootings.

With such a staggering difference, it’s estimated that Latina workers stand to lose more than $1 million over a 40-year period due to the wage gap. We must do more to strengthen our workplace protections &amp; expand opportunities for all! #LatinaEqualPayDay
In fact, Latinas earn approximately 53 cents for every dollar made by white, non-Hispanic men, meaning they must work all the way into November 2018 to earn what these men took home in 2017 alone. #LatinaEqualPay
With 3 million households across the United States headed by Latinas, 40% of those households live below the poverty line. That's shameful. It’s time to make #EqualPay a reality &amp; pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. https://t.co/TyHF6sFuEX

Will we stand up for democracy? For freedom of speech? Will we stand up for our fellow citizens? Will we stand up for our common values as human beings? We only can if we exercise that most precious of rights in a democracy—the right to vote.
The acts of anger &amp; fear that have played out across this nation over the last two weeks underscore exactly what is at stake in this election. We are being tested as a nation.
We have a Constitution &amp; a Congress for a reason. I urge all Americans to reject any effort to shred our core values of respect &amp; diversity &amp; civility.

While women make up over half of the American workforce, they are significantly underrepresented in the aviation industry. In fact, less than ten percent of airline mechanics, flight engineers, repair personnel, and airline pilots are women. https://t.co/fzcRFAKcz5

We ought to be doing all we can to ensure towns and cities across Connecticut get the assistance, resources, and funding they need to implement a successful school breakfast program.
And the numbers don't lie: studies show that children who are well-nourished are ready to learn &amp; thrive in the classroom. Students who eat school breakfast score 17.5 percent higher on standardized math tests &amp; attend 1.5 more school days per year. https://t.co/zyvlE6mh2J
When our schools do a good job of providing access to healthy foods, parents can go to work and know their children are taken care of for the day and that good meals are available.
We cannot let this go unnoticed and unchallenged. An absolutely heartless decision that will further harm already vulnerable communities. https://t.co/3ubz8c12M6

If we remain committed to finding a solution and understanding about the role burn pits play in impacting the health of our service members, however, we can do everything in our power to limit burn pit exposure for future generations of service members to come.
Understanding the health effects of burn pit exposure may take decades &amp; we may never know the full range of substances that service members were exposed to during their tours in Afghanistan &amp; Iraq.
I also called on them to explain what they are doing to ensure the proper oversight &amp; accountability for contractors that run burn pit operation centers.
But, there is more we can and should be doing. I sent a letter to Dept. of Defense Secretary Mattis, asking him to release info about what steps they're taking to improve their understanding about the health effects associated with exposure to burn pits. https://t.co/4xSxFn06oO
Last week, the House passed legislation that included funding for burn pit centers and research--which is a great first step in addressing serious concerns I have about the long term health effects have on our service members. https://t.co/34YANS6MtP

As Vice Ranking member of the @Transport Committee, &amp; nearly 6-year member of the Water Resources Subcommittee, I am proud of the work we have done across party lines for better policy &amp; more federal funding to ensure safe drinking water and less flooding across our country.
So many of our cities and towns have been ravaged by floods over the years, with the loss of lives as well as the loss of millions of dollars of property. The Army Corps of Engineers has an important role to play in safeguarding our communities from these risks.
On Thursday, the House passed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which included three of my amendments that would authorize important U.S. Army of Corps of Engineers’ feasibility studies that will benefit a number of communities right here in CT. https://t.co/ID9vUGSfRF
It's no secret that improving our country's infrastructure has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress. But, infrastructure goes beyond paving roads &amp; building bridges. It means having structurally sound &amp; sufficient water infrastructure systems in place as well.

Exploring the lasting health impacts of burn pits on our military men and women is long overdue, and I hope this step will continue the dialogue about how to best treat and care for our veterans.
You can read more about what this means for veterans in Connecticut and across our country here: https://t.co/34YANS6MtP.
This week, the House passed a funding package that funds several important agencies and projects. There is one section I am particularly proud to have worked on: getting language from my bill, H.R. 1279, the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act, included into the final text.
Our military men and women deserve acknowledgement and study of the health impact of burn pits. And, most importantly, our veterans deserve care for any harm they endured in service to our nation.
The courageous men &amp; women of our military who are endure toxic exposure and risk their long-term health on our nation’s behalf deserve the very best health care. We must not repeat our shameful inaction after the Vietnam War.
While it's important we pay attention to the visible wounds of war, our veterans also suffer from less visible conditions that result from environmental hazards. I’ve heard from veterans throughout CT who suffer from health complications that were likely caused by burn pits.
We owe it to all veterans to ensure that they are able to access the benefits that they have earned through service to our nation--and that includes taking the necessary steps to expand how we get their benefits and useful information to them.
According to the Blinded Veterans Association, there are an estimated over 130,000 legally blinded veterans in the US, &amp; 1.5 million with low-vision. My bill, the VA Website Accessibility Act, would make the VA's websites &amp; digital tools more accessible to the visually impaired.
Yesterday, I testified before the @HouseVetAffairs Health Subcommittee to discuss what we can do to encourage a more user-friendly experience for people with vision disabilities while using the VA website. https://t.co/cflXuqZOAU

We should not deny any veteran the medical treatment they need to live healthy and productive lives. I am proud to stand with my colleagues in calling on the VA to provide these veterans the care they deserve. It is the right thing to do.
The VA’s prohibition on surgical treatment for veterans experiencing gender dysphoria is not only discriminatory, but it also puts the health and well-being of transgender veterans at risk.
Caring for our military servicemen &amp; women is one of our top priorities. And, for the more than 163,000 transgender veterans who selflessly answered the call to service, that means ensuring they have ability to access gender affirming surgeries. https://t.co/EEQo173aWD

We need real, comprehensive immigration reform that will not allow this administration to find new excuses and justifications as to how they can legally rip children from the arms of their parents.
Their pain, their suffering, has stayed with me long after my visit with them. Just thinking about what horrors these families have lived through, and what this administration is putting them through, is incredibly distressing and heart-wrenching.
I am unable to forget, unable to shake, the conversations I had back in June with mothers being held at the Port Isabel Detention Facility in Texas, who pleaded with me to please find their children, to reunite them.
Well said, @rosadelauro. This administration hopes we will forget about the abuse they are inflicting on these families, that we will move on. But we can't &amp; we won't.

Investing in our transportation network goes beyond filling pot holes and building bridges. It means modernizing our rail network, adding positive train controls to our rail cars, maintaining clean tracks, &amp; expanding service to areas that need it most.

That's why it's more important than ever for Members of Congress to protect the independence of the Mueller investigation from interference by the President or anyone else.

Families burying their loved ones at Arlington National Cemetery should be allowed to focus on their loved one’s funeral service and not have to worry about strangers watching from drones flying overhead.
Arlington National Cemetery is a sacred national shrine—but it is also an active cemetery conducting up to 30 funeral services for American service members and veterans every day.
One provision included in this year's bill is my amendment that would call on the FAA &amp; DoD to come together &amp; coordinate a plan to prevent the unauthorized flight of unmanned aircraft over Arlington National Cemetery in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere of the cemetery.

With this resolution, we are reaffirming Congress’ support for the Americans with Disabilities Act and calling on Congress that we work to ensure equal access for all citizens.
That means for many Americans with disabilities, having access to public buildings in their communities provides not only access to important taxpayer-funded services, but also supports self-sufficiency and dignity.
Almost 20% of the civilian population in the U.S. lives with a disability, &amp; more than 3.5 million veterans receive service-related disability benefits. And for those living with a disability, seemingly simple tasks such as going to the Post Office can be incredibly difficult.
Proud to join @rosadelauro, @JohnLarsonCT, @RepJoeCourtney, &amp; @jahimes to introduce a resolution that would recognize the need to improve physical access to a number of federally-funded facilities to all people, especially those with disabilities: https://t.co/ydTK6ln70s

We must protect our democracy. We cannot allow this behavior to go unchallenged.
President Trump and Congress need to work together to ensure that our elections are safe and secure from foreign threats. As a Member of Congress, I have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and defend our country and the American people.
It is even more disturbing that this press conference took place in the same week that President Trump made deeply destructive comments that denigrated some of our closest allies and weakened our critical alliances.
The President had the opportunity to lead with strength against Russian efforts to undermine American elections, and he failed.
The President has sworn an oath to protect our democracy from all threats foreign and domestic democratic institutions. To side with President Putin against our own country is both shocking and appalling.

Our country's strength comes from our ability to work together. For this to be a place of freedom of all, we cannot pit ourselves against each other based on what someone looks like or where they come from. It's time to stand up for each other &amp; come together.
Let me be clear: these policies are shameful &amp; they damage our nation's moral standing &amp; economic competitiveness. The blame should be firmly laid at the feet of the President &amp; it is his decision &amp; his policies that have caused the unconscionable separation of families.
Under President Trump's direction, ICE is separating terrified children from their mothers, deporting spouses of military veterans, eliminating due process in immigration proceedings, and stigmatizing immigrants with no criminal record.
During my trip to the U.S. Border, I met with border patrol agents who were utterly conflicted about carrying out these policies. Many of these agents have families who depend on them &amp; their income to pay their bills, keep food in the fridge, &amp; a roof over their heads.
Over the past few days, I have heard a number of folks call for the abolishment of ICE. While I agree that ICE is in need of reform, abolishing it will not end President Trump's dangerous &amp; inhumane immigration policies. That should be our priority.
Caught up with @SamanthaColind2 yesterday in #Danbury. It’s because of families like hers that inspire me to keep advocating for comprehensive &amp; compassionate immigration reform. There is so much more we can be doing to fix our broken system. https://t.co/MdPDn32g6d

I will do everything in my power to oppose and stop this dangerous proposal from going forward. This is not what our country needs.
Plus, this measure is likely to lead to increased violence and crime, harming the well-being and quality of life for folks everywhere while the gun industry continues to remain exempt from federal health and safety regulations.
This is a thinly-veiled attempt to boost falling gun sales &amp; to make it easier to export semi-automatic rifles, handguns, and sniper rifles to other countries all while threatening the security and stability of communities across the globe.
This Administration doesn't need to be helping the gun lobby anymore than they already do. In fact, the Administration's proposal frees up exports of the same sort of weapons used in the mass shootings at Sandy Hook here in Connecticut, the Pulse nightclub, Las Vegas, &amp; Parkland.
The gun lobby has already succeeded in preventing this Congress from voting on—or even debating, for that matter—comprehensive gun reform legislation despite the fact public support for common-sense gun reform is at the highest level in years. https://t.co/OPCSXJmKCW

Journalists should not have to worry about being shot in their newsroom any more than children should have to worry about being shot in their classroom.  All lives are precious. The madness must stop.
Harmful rhetoric that encourages violence against reporters, like those at the Capital Gazette and at papers across the country, must be condemned swiftly and harshly.
If it turns out that the shooter chose his victims because they were reporters, that would raise additional concerns. Make no mistake - an attack on our free press is an attack on our democracy.
The reporters at the Capital Gazette and their families deserve our compassion, but also deserve Congressional action to reduce gun violence.
More families who will be grieving the loss of a loved one who will not be returning home tonight While there is still much we do not know about what happened today in Annapolis and why, what we do know is this: these shootings must stop.

I call upon all of my colleagues — Democrats and Republicans — to put politics aside and work together to pass legislation to undo this anti-Muslim immigration ban.
Ever since the President issued his first travel ban last January, I have been in touch with colleagues, constituents, and community leaders, and I stand ready to provide assistance to any Connecticut family who is endangered by these executive orders.
This ban has had the effect of keeping students from their studies, scientists from their labs, and parents from their kids. It will not make America safer. In fact, by excluding immigrants based principally on religion endangers our security.
Today’s decision will be a stain on our nation's history. But history will also remember which of our political leaders stood up for our American values — and which were willing to judge people based on their faith and country of origin.
It deliberately targets people of a single faith, Islam, for discrimination and hostility. It reinforces Islamophobic sentiments at a time when religious communities throughout the country are being targeted by violence.
Incredibly disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the President’s ban on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. This ban is immoral, inhumane, and fundamentally un-American. https://t.co/5HXMGIuKS2

It’s all beyond heartbreaking.
I spoke extensively with one woman whose 12 year old son, her only child, was separated from her within 2 hours of being detained. She doesn’t know where he is. She has no other family--no other children.  No parents of her own. Lots of tears and fear.
They are not allowed to make phone calls unless they have money on a credit account, which many don’t.  ICE claims that they can/ will find their children if the women ask. The women say they ask every day.
The rest don’t know where their children are. Some have been at the facility for a week and some as long as six weeks. All were in tears. Asking for help to find their children.
Only one had spoken with her child (a seven year-old now in New York with family). The children are as young as five.
This is the Port Isabel Detention Facility, where we met with 15 recently detained women, all of whom had their children separated from them. https://t.co/ObNHUkQaBo

This change starts with the leaders of an organization being accountable for their own words and actions and setting the right example for their employees.
In fact, many of these employees are veterans themselves. We owe it to our veterans and VA employees to change a workplace cultures that allow for bad behavior to continue. https://t.co/z3uTb8QLFy
The VA employs over 370,000 people across the country whose primary goal is to assist our veterans who have dutifully and honorably served the United States.
I stand by my original statement, which can be found here: https://t.co/W2u6FlIvAI
We needed balanced reforms that would have benefited CT farmers, consumers, &amp; tax-payers without gutting vital anti-hunger efforts.
It pains me that in order to assist our hardworking farmers, who make a critical contribution to our economy, it had to come at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people in our state.
In fact, over 56,000 hardworking people in Connecticut are eligible for and participate in food assistance programs.  And across the country, 265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals.
SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combating poverty in CT and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.

I'm committed to working across the aisle w/ my colleagues in Congress to reach broader consensus on the full range of immigration issues including DACA, high skill visas, &amp; agricultural visas. We must reach a bipartisan consensus that fully acknowledges &amp; addresses these issues.
The immigration bills that House Republicans are calling for votes tomorrow do nothing to resolve the appalling situation at the border and fail to fix our broken immigration system.
Simply put, detention centers are no place for children, with or without their parents.
What’s more, this runs against a decades-old court-ordered prohibition against holding children in custody long term.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, keeping children locked up can cause them negative physical and emotional harm, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
This Executive Order still fails to address the fact that keeping children in detention has the potential to do real and permanent harm to vulnerable children. https://t.co/pXLUScIZnu
Today, let us honor these refugees' strength and perseverance and amplify their stories of resilience. Let us celebrate their contributions to our communities, who through their shared talents, skills, cultures, and customs, inspire our country to be one of action and integrity.
Our country was built on the shared value and commitment that all humans—regardless of where they were born in the world—deserve an opportunity to pursue an education without interruption, to learn and grow as individuals, and to fulfill their dreams.
Many of these families have fled violence and threats and are seeking a safe life for themselves in the United States and elsewhere.
According to a recent UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report, there were 68.5 million forcibly displaced people in the world, including 25.4 million refugees. That's 2.9 million more refugees than the year before.

The fact that this Administration is separating children from their parents at the border goes against our shared values as Americans. It is also appalling to task our customs and border patrol agents with inflicting this type of harm.
To inflict this level of trauma on some of the most vulnerable can only be described as a crisis of conscious within the Trump Administration that in turn reflects on our country as a whole.
We, as a nation, have a moral obligation to assist these families. As a mother of three, my heart breaks at the thought of these children waking up each morning not knowing when they will be with their parents again. https://t.co/NXvS9t7ztb

And not just a vote on gun safety, but we must also speak out against violence &amp; discrimination as well. We need to bring federal anti-discrimination laws into line with our American values.
They deserved so much more. Their lives were painfully and tragically cut short. This Congress owes them the respect they deserve. And that means holding a vote.
Here we are, two years later and still not a single vote in Congress on gun safety legislation. This is not how we should be honoring the victims of Pulse Nightclub shooting.
We must take action to stop the terrible epidemic of gun violence, which takes 92 lives on a typical day in our country. So many bright futures robbed. So many families torn apart. So many communities left to pick up the shattered pieces.
Hatred or violence targeting any community – whether based on religion, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else – is a betrayal of our values as Americans.
But words, on their own, are not good enough. We need to address the root causes of this attack and work together to prevent more families from suffering the same heartbreaking loss.
It is two years later, and I want the survivors and families of this tragedy to know that I still continue to stand with them, to grieve with them.

No company, no state or federal agency would have an employee assistance staff of six to serve 9,000 employees. Neither should the House of Representatives. Our dedicated staff deserve better.

The gun industry, which already has special protection from civil liability and is already exempt from many federal health and safety regulations, does not need any more assistance from this Administration.
This proposal will threaten the security and stability of communities across the globe and is likely to lead to increased violence and crime, harming the well-being and quality of life for folks everywhere.
This proposal is a thinly-veiled attempt at boosting falling gun sales by making it easier to export semi-automatic rifles, handguns, and sniper rifles to other countries.
This is another yet another example of the Trump Administration promoting the economic interests of the gun industry over the lives and safety of Americans across the country and now, people around the world. https://t.co/Yuku3uE477

I am calling on my colleagues to come together to rewrite the Farm Bill &amp; to find a better, balanced, &amp; bipartisan approach that funds these essential agriculture and food programs.
And these hardworking dairy farmers make a critical contribution to our economy here in CT &amp; to our quality of life. I will continue to support bills &amp; amendments that allow for balanced reforms to benefit CT farmers, consumers, &amp; tax-payers w/o gutting vital anti-hunger efforts.
As for our dairy farmers? Well, milk prices have dropped almost 40% in the last few years, and dairy farmers in New England are struggling to bring in the revenues they need to stay afloat.
In fact, over 56,000 hardworking people in Connecticut are eligible for and participate in food assistance programs.
Cutting more than $23 billion in nutrition assistance for families is simply wrong. SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combating poverty in Connecticut and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.
I am disappointed that the Farm Bill we were presented with today—despite provisions helpful to Connecticut’s dairy farmers—fails to protect the health and welfare of too many Americans. https://t.co/8X7zopjy3i

Today, this Congress had the opportunity to honor and support veterans of all service eras by voting for this bill. It is time we treated our injured veterans of all eras equally and expand VA caregivers programs to all injured veterans.
That is why since being elected to Congress, I have authored legislation in every session to expand this assistance for family caregivers. My bill, the CARE for All Veterans Act, was included in the VA MISSIONS Act, which passed the House 347-70.
Family caregivers, the true partners in delivery of healthcare to our veterans, provide loving and essential care at home to our injured veterans from bathing and dressing, housework, and transportation, to administering physical and medical therapies.
Since my first days in Congress, I have heard from veterans and their caregivers about the important assistance provided through the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. https://t.co/fprCTCyCyd

Behind their joke is a serious sadness in how we treat our veterans. We ought to be doing right by them from the start. I’m turning to my colleagues to support these bills that will transform the lives of veterans across our country when these bills come to the floor for a vote.
Some of these bills are ideas decades in the making. I hear time &amp; time again from veterans across CT about how important legislation like the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is. They joke they are glad they “didn’t die before seeing this bill go forward.”
Plus, we’re taking additional steps to ensure that the veterans peer counseling program includes a sufficient number of peer counselors for women veterans and will focus on the mental health needs of female veterans (Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act).
And, included in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is legislation to assist veterans exposed to Agent Orange and in the Korean DMZ so that those exposed during a period of testing become eligible for compensation and healthcare benefits.
Also, we’re doing more to ensure veterans are able to receive medical treatments and compensation for their exposure to toxic substances that affect the quality of their day-to-day lives long after their military service has ended (Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act).
We’re making good on our commitment to our wounded warriors by ensuring their family members have the resources they need to care for them at home (CARE for All Veterans Act, which will be included in the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Outside Networks Act).
And furthering our understanding on how medicinal marijuana can help veterans manage chronic pain by expanding our research efforts into the issue (VA Medical Cannabis Research Act).
Like ensuring our heroes’ benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living and putting more dollars in the hands of the men and women who served our nation and their families (Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Act).
Yesterday, during the House Veterans Affairs Committee markup, several of my bills and amendments to help veterans were cleared to go to the House floor for a debate. That means we’re doing more to take care of our veterans. https://t.co/7JN6zvXxTI
We cannot truly honor the sacrifices of our military men and women if we aren’t fulfilling our commitment to them to after their service has ended. Far too many veterans today don’t receive access to health care and the resources they need to be successful after their service.
And, as the weather gets nicer, I am looking forward to getting back out on the trails &amp; enjoying the hard work folks put into making these paths so wonderful. Maybe my friend @rosadelauro will want to join me there, as it goes through both our districts!

Effectively cutting off the access to care for those who most need it is incomprehensible to me. I will forcefully oppose--and women and men throughout this country will forcefully oppose--any attempt to rob Americans of health services that they depend on for survival.
We need more access to quality health care, not less. This change in priorities will not reduce the rate of abortions. What it will do, though, is make it harder for women throughout the country to access vital services like pap tests, HIV screenings, and breast exams.
Title X exists specifically to ensure comprehensive, evidence-based contraception, and reproductive health services to people across the country—including thousands of patients right here in Connecticut.

This is one step of many I plan to take during my remaining time in office to challenge the issue of sexual violence, and I look forward to continuing this conversation with my colleagues.
It recognizes the unique needs of these survivors &amp; calls for research that draws attention to the disproportionate levels of sexual violence and the impact of sexual violence on a diverse survivor population.
The Resolution affirms a commitment to elevate the voices of historically under-served communities and currently disenfranchised in an effort to end sexual violence and provide support for survivors.
We need to affirm our commitment to elevating the voices &amp; needs of historically disenfranchised communities in the effort to end sexual violence including immigrant survivors, survivors with disabilities, survivors of color, survivors of child sex abuse, and LGBTQIA+ survivors.
They will have the resources they need readily available to them so that they may advocate for themselves &amp; their communities.
And that’s exactly why I am saying something. Just because this happened does not mean I should exclude myself from the conversation &amp; not try to change the culture so that the next generation of leaders will not have to endure such treatment.
I can see how, to some, me speaking out about this seems hypocritical. They may ask themselves, “How can she support this resolution when something so awful happened in her own office?”
April is #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth. But for the survivors of abuse, their pain &amp; experiences cannot be resolved in a calendar month. We must do more. That’s why I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Sexual Assault Awareness Month Resolution.
What frightens me, though, is that these numbers may actually be much higher. Sexual violence is an under-reported crime, especially among those living with a disability, where they are at an increased risk of being sexually assaulted.
In fact, the same National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let Her Learn Survey found that 1 in 5 girls aged 14 to 18 has been kissed or touch without consent, including 24% of Latina girls, 23% of Native American girls, and 22% of Black girls.
According to the National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let Her Learn Survey, it found that 38% of LGBT teen girls reported experiencing sexual violence, compared to 21% of all girls.
And when you break it down by group, the rates are even higher: Among transgender people of color, 65% of Native Americans, 59% of multiracial people, 58% of Middle Eastern people, &amp; 53% of African Americans are likely to have been sexually assaulted.
According to a 2015 US Transgender Survey, 47% of transgender people are sexually assaulted.
And it goes beyond what happened in my office—this issue is systemic across the board. It spans across organizations, businesses, universities, and even into our classrooms. The more people I talk to, the more I realize how commonplace this behavior has become.
When I look at what happened in my own office, and despite the mistakes I made in handling this particular situation, I am able to see and understand how this culture can be created and maintained.
For far too long, survivors of sexual violence have been forced to live in a culture that thrived off their silence—a culture that became complicit in their suffering.
My bipartisan bill continues the important work of encouraging more people – and especially women – to consider careers in the high-skill field of aviation and aerospace.
Women bring new perspectives, backgrounds, &amp; problem solving skills to the table – traits we know are necessary to compete for the high-wage jobs of the future. With an aging aviation workforce, we must do everything in our power to broaden &amp; deepen our pool of available workers.
At a time when only six percent of pilots are women, and women comprise just over a quarter of air traffic controllers, we need to elevate the initiatives happening in the private sector to encourage women to join this important sector of the workforce.

My bill was marked up last week during a recent @Transport hearing. You can view my remarks here: https://t.co/aarkJORsTp.
Less than 10% of airline mechanics, flight engineers, repair personnel, and airline pilots are women. And with nearly a fifth of aerospace engineers nearing retirement age, filling those jobs are vital to keeping our aerospace &amp; aviation industries up &amp; running.
And that is exactly what my bill, the Promoting Women in Aviation Workforce Act, is all about: ensuring education, training, mentorship, outreach, and recruitment opportunities for women to bring them into the aviation industry.
Women like Shults bring invaluable experience &amp; skills to the table. We ought to be providing women the tools &amp; resources they need to be successful in aviation.
It’s no wonder that Shults’s family &amp; friends describe her as a pioneer in the aviation field, and as a woman who broke barriers to pursue her goals. She faced discrimination along her path to success, but she never let it stop her. Instead, it motivated her more.
As a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, she understands the importance of being properly trained &amp; prepared for all situations—especially the ones you hope to never find yourself in.

Coming together at the table is only one part of the equation, but it is an important one. I plan to use the remainder of my term to continue these types of conversations &amp; to find bipartisan solutions that will help reduce the number of gun-related deaths in this country.
It’s measures like this that we can implement that keep our families safe and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners. We do not have to pick and choose between the two.
Last week, my colleagues and I introduced the Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act, which provides federal grants for states to implement "permit to purchase laws," which are statistically proven to reduce gun homicide deaths. https://t.co/7rwe6mMlD8
It’s a step forward in talking about figuring out which laws &amp; policies actually work in keeping our children safe, wherever that may be. Whether that is at school. Or a movie theater. Or a concert. Or at church. Or simply on the streets.
There is so much more we can do. And today’s bipartisan school safety forum, convened by @SenBillNelson &amp; @marcorubio, is one step forward by calling for lawmakers &amp; advocates to come together for a desperately-needed conversation.
Parents like Nicole and Mark did not ask to become a part of this movement, a part of this narrative. Nor did folks in Colorado. Or Las Vegas. Or Sutherland. Or Chicago. Or Hartford.
No, it is not Nicole that has failed. It is Congress. It is Congress that has failed families and communities across the country. It is Congress that has failed in its responsibility to take more meaningful steps to prevent gun violence.
And that angers me. Because Nicole has not failed—Nicole has become a part of a larger movement to change the conversation and culture around gun violence. She has turned her tragedy into action.
During today’s school safety forum, @NicoleHockley said that when she first heard about the shooting in #Parkland, she felt like she “failed.” https://t.co/dFCfnpwsrn

This bill just won’t cut it for Connecticut families. This will hurt our neighbors in need. We ought to go back to the table and put forward a bipartisan solution that does not place budget cuts on the back of the most vulnerable in our communities.
Plus, with insufficient funding and vague language about how to implement new programs within the two-year required timeframe, these requirements are solutions in search of a problem.
And changing the work requirements will ultimately do little to help unemployment. Rather, it will just add more red tape to the system.
Cutting billions of funding over the next ten years in nutritional assistance for families is not reasonable reform. SNAP is critical to preventing hunger and combatting poverty in Connecticut and across the country, particularly for families with children and disabled veterans.
This bill will hurt Connecticut families, where 13.9% of residents are food insecure and 6.0% are very food insecure—meaning thousands of families are living without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.
Reading over the text of the #FarmBill &amp; stunned to discover some of my colleague’s still insist on cutting crucial funding from the SNAP program. As it currently stands, this bill would increase food insecurity &amp;hardship for many working-class families. https://t.co/Yb3U7lU31t

We can harness the resources and technology available to us today to change the conversation around gun violence. It's time for action.
While there are more steps we can—and should—take to keep our families safe, this is an important step forward  that would make our communities safer while respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
Compare that to states like Missouri that repealed their permit to purchase law in 2007. Almost immediately, they saw their state’s firearm homicide rate rise by 25%.
We’ve had this law in place here in CT for a number of years and the numbers don’t lie: it works. According to a 2015 study using CDC mortality data, permit to purchase laws reduced firearm homicides by 40%, which translates to 296 firearm homicides avoided.
This bill, through federal grants, would incentivize states to enact laws requiring folks to obtain a license before purchasing a handgun and would close dangerous loopholes in our existing federal laws that put our families, friends, and neighbors at risk for harm
We must do more to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. That’s why yesterday, along with @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBlumenthal, @ChrisVanHollen @RepRobinKelly, @RepAdams, and I introduced the “Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act.” https://t.co/7rwe6mMlD8
Horrified to hear of the tragic events today in #NewMilford. These events are becoming all too common in our communities. As we continue to learn more about what happened, my thoughts are with the victims’ families at this time. https://t.co/y9woY4vb2z
I hope to continue bipartisan conversations like this during the remainder of my time in Congress to ensure we properly fund research projects that will translate into healthier and safer communities.
Everywhere I go in Connecticut, I meet people whose families have lost loved ones to drug addiction. The stakes are too high to limit access and make it harder for folks to get the care and treatment they need to overcome their addiction.
And leading health researchers agree that combating the opioid epidemic needs to be a collaborative effort that prioritizes putting patients first— &amp; our research should determine which avenues of treatment work best.
We need to find ways that encourage &amp; support the innovative work of companies like Protein Sciences that play a key role in keeping our communities healthy.
@ProteinSciences, a biotech firm in #Meriden, is developing cutting-edge, life-saving vaccines to treat and prevent a variety of diseases, like their groundbreaking, egg-free flu vaccine, Flublok.
And investing in research &amp; development means a more equipped and better prepared country to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Understanding patterns of violence and what we can do to make our towns and cities safer requires a hard look at what policies work and what we can to do strengthen existing policies in place.
Great meeting with @PeteSessions &amp; leading health experts to discuss the importance of investing in research &amp; development to confront public health concerns—like gun violence, an issue no community is immune to. https://t.co/2cKOhQ0AXi
Congratulations to @SenDuckworth on the birth of her daughter, Maile Pearl (and for becoming the first sitting senator to give birth). Wishing you and your family all the best during this wonderful time!
Let's keep supporting women &amp; girls who inspire us every day with their smarts, strength, &amp; perseverance in the face of adversity. And we can do that by paying them the same amount as their male colleagues for equal work. #EqualPayDay
Over the course of a 40-year career, the average woman loses $418K to the #WageGap. And in CT alone, this costs women $15 billion per year. That’s less money to save for their retirement, for their healthcare, for their families, for their education.
It’s 2018. It’s time we focus on ending pay inequality &amp; making sure all women have the opportunity to succeed in the workplace because even amongst women, there is still a pay gap. https://t.co/QkQkwlXnBU

Unfortunately, tonight’s town hall at Pomperaug High School in #Southbury has been postponed. Be sure to check back here for updates and future town hall events.
I am disappointed in this decision, and I look forward to the constitutional challenge the Administration should rightly face for this cold, calculated, and heartless decision.
To go forward with this ban is a direct insult to these soldiers who fought to protect the very civil liberties this President seeks to hinder.
This decision sends a shameful message to folks across the country--and frankly, to the rest of the world--that their government doesn’t care about their civil rights or their safety.
Protecting the freedoms and rights of some does not impede on the freedoms and rights of others. That is an anti-LGBTQIA+ talking point with no real truth and merit.
This decision is cruel and unconstitutional, and contradicts what Trump believes this will do: make our country safer. To ban transgender troops will make our country less safe &amp; send a clear message to the rest of the world about our values as a nation. https://t.co/GmnLjrs8RG

It would also recognize that school safety is one piece of a larger puzzle; that Aurora, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and so many other shootings that have occurred in America didn't happen in classrooms.		We need to make everyone safer everywhere.
Bold action would build on the positive aspects of @POTUS' proposal, such as closing the gaps in the NICS system, giving students and teachers the tools to spot and report signs of violence in our schools.
... and only makes a vague call on states to adopt the kinds of extreme risk protection orders that have saved real lives in Connecticut. 		Where's the fearlessness? Where's the boldness?

Finally: if we attempt to arm every teacher, or 20% of teachers, or every seventh teacher, or any number of teachers, what does it say that we're asking America's educators to spend their time in target practice, not educating our kids?		This proposal is beyond flawed.
What happens if a teacher is sued for actions they take after they've trained? Who pays, the school, the district, the teacher? How will the guns be kept in the classroom? What if a student gains access to a weapon?
And then there are the many (obvious) flaws with training every teacher to handle firearms, as law enforcement officers and gun owners have been pointing out: who pays for guns and training? Who assesses the quality of training? What if teachers are injured during training?

What #Russia's agents allegedly did - generating a torrent of real (or real-ish) looking comments on social media designed to manipulate public opinion - continues to happen to federal lawmakers (present company included) today.
Profoundly disturbing news on #Russia's interference in our democracy. 		Raises significant questions that I fear are being lost in the discussion: what does it mean when it's easy for a foreign power - or anyone, for that matter - to manufacture public opinion online? https://t.co/grI8jRP77Z

And I prayed that today, at long last, finally, after so much senseless violence, Congress will locate the backbone to protect our kids by making it possible to get a Gun Violence Restraining Order anywhere in America.		It's one step, but it's an important step.		#GunReformNow
I thought about how @RepDonBeyer, @RepCarbajal and I introduced legislation to make Gun Violence Restraining Orders a national standard to save real lives, just like we have in Connecticut.
Last night, I thought about how Connecticut put a Gun Violence Restraining Order system in place to protect families from dangerous individuals with access to high-powered semiautomatic weapons.

Gun owners have children too. Sportsmen and women have a stake in safer schools and communities. All of us have a responsibility to confront this epidemic of violence and do it now.
I was on a phone call this afternoon when I looked up to see images of children running out of schools, hiding under desks, and walking past armored vehicles parked outside their school. I am beyond sick. Nobody should want this for our country. No one.
We think of America as an exceptional country. We are - we are the exception to the rule that mass shootings do not occur in schools, churches, concerts, and other public locations on an alarmingly regular basis.
The events in Parkland are hitting far too close to home. I'm sick for the students. I'm sick for their parents. I'm sick for the community, for the first responders who once again are forced to treat an American school as a war zone...

As I saw at the #ProblemSolvers meeting this morning, there are plenty of my colleagues in both parties who want to reverse the trend toward dysfunction. We should throw out this CR and work together in a meaningful way.
In recent years, we've seen continuing resolutions shrink in length from year-by-year to every few months to just a month or two. There is nothing rational about the way we're doing business.
Let's remember one thing: our government was never -- never -- supposed to be run by continuing resolution in the first place. We are supposed to pass budgets. We are supposed to provide funding for federal initiatives.
I've had to look small business owners who produce key components for our defense and aerospace industries in the eye and tell them we don't know if their contracts will be delayed or disrupted.
I've had to look #CT children using #HUSKY in the eye and tell them we honestly don't know what will happen to their health care in 2018.
We are currently considering what would be the fourth continuing resolution since September. No business would survive if it ran itself the way our government has for the past several months.
And thank you for all you’re doing, Maria! https://t.co/CAIwaRRcup
@USCBO found that a 10-year renewal of #CHIP would SAVE the gv't $6 billion - there's absolutely no good reason why #CT kids receiving #HUSKY should be held hostage in CR discussions. A standalone renewal should (and would) have bipartisan support.

Again, thank you to @theneedledrop and those who reached out to request an explanation on my vote. While we won't always agree, I will always do my best to explain my thinking and welcome folks' calls, e-mails, letters, and tweets.
In the end, I reject as false the choice between civil liberties and national security. I've always evaluated specific proposals in this realm individually on their merits, and I'm going to continue to do so.
The amendment also would have required us to publish the sources and the methods we use to gather intelligence, which could hand our adversaries a golden key to unlock the means to harm our citizens.
Probable cause is often absent in specific intelligence and counterterrorism cases, when time is of the essence and often makes the difference between life and death for Americans at home and abroad.
It would require a probable cause warrant for lawfully-acquired data even in cases involving foreign individuals on U.S. soil communicating with terrorists or targets of our intelligence collection efforts.
Yesterday's amendment would go far, far beyond the balance of civil liberties and national security I've long sought to preserve.
However, I want to talk about why I viewed yesterday's amendment differently from the pro-privacy efforts I've supported in the past.
I also voted for two amendments in the House that would limit funding for warrantless searches and protect private information, both of which passed.
For example, in 2015, I voted for the original USA FREEDOM Act to end bulk collection, prevent overreach, and require the FISA courts to be more transparent about their operations.
I’ve also supported a number of legislative efforts to rein in FISA abuses and ensure we're maintaining the balance between civil liberties and our responsibility to protect national security.
First and foremost, I voted in opposition to final passage of a blanket extension of FISA. The authorities delegated under FISA have been abused.
Hi Tony (et. al) -- I want to address yesterday's FISA votes directly with you. https://t.co/TZj4UsbHV2

That is no way to run a country. I hope my colleagues will hear &amp; address these very real concerns when we meet in January to discuss the CR again.
So no, I could not, in good faith, vote for a CR that continues to hurt CT families &amp; immigrants. I want the government open, but not if it comes at the expense of working families &amp; immigrants.
This CR will force people without documentation to continue to live in fear &amp; agony as their livelihood is used as political leverage.
The CR does nothing to address #DACA recipients or #Dreamers living in CT (&amp; across the country) who are worried if they will be allowed to stay in this country. To work in this country. Continue to live a safe life in this country.
&amp;, even if the CR provides enough to fund Husky, it’s only for a few months—max. Will CT families receive another letter rescinding insurance coverage again? This CR forces CT families to walk on eggshells, wondering when their children’s insurance will be ripped away.
#CHIP funding issues are still very real concerns for CT families who depend on Husky A &amp;B for their children’s healthcare.
It is not a real fix for serious issues that need to be addressed with real thought, consideration, &amp; debate. Not a rushed job to hold us over until the new year.
However, this CR is an insult to the values Connecticut families have made explicitly clear through the thousands of calls &amp; messages I’ve received in support of #CHIP, #DACA, &amp; many other programs.
First, let me be clear: there’s no doubt in my mind that we need to keep the government open. Families across the country deserve a working government.
Yesterday, I joined my colleagues in voting “no” on the proposed continuing resolution (CR), which would fund the government until 1/19/18.
On air with @am1220wqun to discuss how we can work together to preserve health care for #CT kids.
Stood w/colleagues this morning to call for bipartisan renewal of CHIP. Families of 17k children in #CT who rely on HUSKY for coverage are counting on us to do the right thing. https://t.co/hBRRRJQDoj
Now that the FCC’s rolled back #NetNeutralty protections, it’s time for Congress to take action of its own. #SaveNetNeutrality https://t.co/KvubfZKke8
Congress’s inaction on CHIP (and rushed action on taxes!) is shameful at best, immoral at worst. We need to do better. Our children, their future, and the success of our state, depend upon it. 9/end
With the money being spent on this tax cut, we could fund CHIP for 915 years. Let me repeat that: 915 years. 8/
And that’s just it—Congress has prioritized tax giveaways over our children’s health programs. They’ve reduced families to numbers. It’s wrong. 7/
Another letter from Washington Depot: “We are a week away from Christmas, &amp; what should be a happy time of year has now turned into stress. How am I going to get insurance for my kids? My kids are the future of this country. What is Congress doing to protect their healthcare?” 6/
She writes: “I fear that w/o assistance, I will have to forego preventative care &amp; my children's health will suffer &amp; will end up costing more in the long run. It's unfair that corporations will benefit from tax breaks when my children will suffer as a result of an awful bill” 5/
Take, for example, a single mother in Sandy Hook, who recently reached out to my office, distraught that her kids will lose their Husky insurance beginning in 2018. 4/
Cutting funding for programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Plan will leave millions of Americans across the country without reliable sources of aid.  Here in CT, that means families risk losing Husky A and B. 3/
And yet, for parents throughout CT, instead of enjoying the holiday season with their families, they are worrying about their children’s health insurance thanks to inaction on #CHIP. 2/ https://t.co/Qghxc8Wrfh
Being a parent is one of the toughest jobs in the world. It is also one of the most rewarding. 1/
Aerospace is a key sector of Connecticut's economy, and with nearly one-fifth of engineers set to retire, we need to broaden and deepen our pool of available workers. Glad the House passed my bipartisan bill to encourage women to consider careers in aerospace today. https://t.co/kKfGZIHDNw
In short: this tax bill isn't about putting money back in your pocket. It's not about making your health care cheaper. It's about giving politicians more concerned with 'optics' and scoring 'wins' than helping actual people a 'win' to close out 2017. Shameful.
We were promised a health care plan that would cover everyone at a lower cost, and yet, millions of Americans will see higher premiums or end up uninsured altogether.
We were told that families could fill out their taxes on a postcard. Guess what? Nobody's getting a postcard next year.
This bill was supposed to create jobs and raise wages. Instead, it's a generational theft that will heap trillions of debt on our kids and grandkids to make more billionaires happy for the holidays.
We were promised that working Americans could keep more of their hard-earned dollars. Instead, a majority of the American people, and especially folks in #CT, will see their taxes increase under this plan.
It's worth reflecting on just how many ways this 400-plus-page monstrosity of a partisan tax bill fails the promises that were made to the American middle class.
Thanks for having me on the show, Alan, and for giving me the opportunity to remind folks that I'm absolutely voting "no" on this awful tax bill that will hurt middle-class families in Connecticut. https://t.co/BS6CU2Y15N

Heading to the House floor soon to speak on my bipartisan Women in Aerospace Education Act and to vote for final passage. I'm glad that we could work together as Democrats and Republicans to do what's right for our economy &amp; scientific fields. https://t.co/pw9kyHyE8k
My heart is with all those lost and those hurt in the derailment this morning. https://t.co/ACIuzbkwFQ
That's what we should've been doing all along: working together to craft legislation that will strengthen family budgets and create jobs in America in a fiscally-responsible way.
Let's get one thing straight: I want tax reform. Middle-class families need tax reform. Small businesses need tax reform. This bill isn't tax reform at all. If and when it fails, Republicans and Democrats should find a way to work together on a plan that helps Americans.
Most of the people I represent would see little, if any, benefit from this tax plan, while those who are already doing exceedingly well will received huge windfalls.
It still blows a trillion-dollar-plus hole in the federal budget at a time when nonpartisan experts are still warning us of the long-term consequences of our accumulating national debt. Remember fiscal responsibility?
The tax bill still raises taxes on millions of working people to pay for benefits that will accrue solely to multinational corporations, the wealthiest people in the country, and the heirs to their large estates.
The "changes" made to this tax bill haven't changed my opinion of it one bit - it's still a ripoff of Connecticut's middle class families. https://t.co/Ev1k7aTHow

#HonorWithAction is trending, and frankly, the concept behind it has been for years now. Veterans, families, law enforcement, responsible gun owners, and advocates are tired of a Congress that refuses to listen.
My colleague from #NV is right: thoughts, prayers, and moments of silence are important, but on their own, they are not enough. Let's #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/QagaQK7vtp
My colleague from #CA notes in advance of tomorrow's anniversary - mass shootings have happened throughout the United States, touching rural, urban, and suburban communities alike. We must #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/EaWAaIo0tz

@HouseGVP We need a bipartisan path forward on guns that recognizes the 2A rights AND the safety of every American. Closing the gaps in our background check system with #FixNICS is a step on that path. Reciprocity isn't. #StopCCR
@HouseGVP So-called "reciprocity" will make it even harder for law enforcement to do its job. Worse than that, it contains especially extreme language holding officers personally liable for questioning a concealed carry permit. Police officers could be sued directly. #StopCCR
@HouseGVP For years, we've been told that national standards aimed at ending gun violence would harm the rights of states with weaker gun laws. Well, what about the states who've chosen tougher standards to keep families safe? #StopCCR #EndGunViolence
@HouseGVP Let's break down the concept of #CCR for a second: many states throughout the country have passed tough concealed carry standards that respect Americans' 2A rights. "Reciprocity" would allow people to travel to states with weaker laws and get a license to carry. #StopCCR
@HouseGVP The bad news = #FixNICS is being advanced at the same time as "concealed carry reciprocity" legislation, which would allow people to have hidden guns virtually anywhere &amp; any time. #NoCCR
@HouseGVP The good news = bipartisan #FixNICS Act to strengthen our background check system is being considered by the House Judiciary Committee.

@jahimes In other words, this #TaxPlan would take from our future to give more to multinational corporations today. It's wrong, and you can bet I'm opposed to it.
My colleague @jahimes says it best: fiscal responsibility isn't just an issue for "deficit hawks" - it matters to anyone who cares about investments in schools, roads, tech, nat'l security, and other key priorities.
Yet those currently ramming this partisan #TaxPlan through the House are casting aside any concern for the long-term fiscal impact of their actions.
Throughout President Obama's tenure, we heard time and time again of the importance of reducing the national debt.
I say *at least* because of the difficulty of calculating the massive interest payments we'll heap on our children and grandchildren just to give the wealthiest Americans a tax cut.
Now we find out that this #TaxPlan would raise the national debt by *at least* $1.7 trillion over the next ten years. https://t.co/UgpJej0494

It's already outrageous that teachers have to use *their own money* for classroom supplies. We want to make them pay more?
Right now, teachers get a small break on their taxes - $250 - to offset costs in the classroom. This plan takes that away.
Say you're an elementary school teacher in #CT who spends hundreds (if not thousands) of $ - your own money - for supplies every year.

We need to think about the ways we can leverage our knowledge and tech to build PR &amp; USVI back up &amp; build them even stronger.
I told them in no uncertain terms that their response has not been good enough.
Earlier in the week, I met with officials from FEMA, DHS, and DoD to discuss the federal response to Hurricane Maria.
We need to stay in Puerto Rico &amp; USVI until the job is done, period. Any suggestion that our emergency efforts might end early is offensive.
Residents of Puerto Rico &amp; USVI are real people, and they are U.S. citizens - not just a burden to the rest of the country.
They are facing a humanitarian crisis, with too many lacking food, water, and shelter.
Let's get one thing straight: Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; USVI need our help.
@TaxPolicyCenter We can do better. Let's work together for #FairerTaxes instead of offering budget-busting, middle-class-family-punishing tax plans. https://t.co/F77nt4O96l
@TaxPolicyCenter claims the Majority's tax plan would explode the deficit $2.4 trillion over the next ten years. #FairerTaxes? Not exactly.

With more than 20 veterans dying by suicide per day, the vast majority by firearm, we have a responsibility to take action. #gunsense
This hastily crafted, overbroad bill does not and will not help our veterans or our communities. #gunsense
There are things we can and should do to reduce veteran suicides while fully respecting the Second Amendment. #gunsense
Also deeply concerning that @HouseVetAffairs advanced this highly partisan bill with no hearing &amp; with only bare minimum required notice.
H.R. 1181 would also upend the carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise agreed to in the 21st Century Cures Act. #gunsense
The bill sets a nearly impossible standard for the VA to prevent a veteran who is at risk of harming themselves or others from buying a gun.

GOP health care bill asks working families to #PayMoreForLess. Higher premiums, fewer benefits. Insurance execs making &gt;$500K get a tax cut.
Key takeaway on GOP health care bill: Millions of Americans will lose their health coverage. Their coverage will be replaced with nothing.
This bill is only a replacement in that it 'replaces' benefits for working families with tax breaks for the wealthy. https://t.co/XGq7EKYFjE

3/ This #MuslimBan is just as immoral, inhumane &amp; fundamentally un-American as the 1st one. Our nation gains nothing from it. We lose a lot.
2/ @realDonaldTrump's EO will undermine our counterterrorism efforts, diminish US standing in the world &amp; put our troops at risk #MuslimBan2
