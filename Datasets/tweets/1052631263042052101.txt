@ACLU You do nothing for people who are suffering severely in crooked divorce court situations, and having their rights trampled on like they don't exist, put you action where your money is!  Do something! @FCLUORG
@LetUsGetHonest @FCLUORG Who is the judge of "Unreformed, abusive, violent, and or a batterer or the enablers"? Is it a baseless accusation in a divorce case where lawlessness runs rampant or is it REAL evidence of REAL incidents?  Real is Real and should be denied ALL rights including freedom. Reality.
@LetUsGetHonest Parental Alienation IS a form of child abuse, one of every two claims of DV arising from a divorce situation or a cohabitation separation issue before the courts is false. If YOU had an abuser in your case, that's your issue and NOT the statistics.

What I see as a despicable act is Parental Alienation, this MESS caused by, more often than not, BOTH OF YOU is already a nightmare so... make it worse for your kids, tell them story's that aren't true, make them believe it and remove one parent from the picture... just for you? https://t.co/koKMuylt5Y
When Parenting isn't Shared kids lose, when Vengeance is your mission in the courts, kids Lose, when that urge to get even fills your case in the courts, Kids lose, when You think you deserve more regardless of the situation, Kids Lose.
