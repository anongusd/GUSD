March 4th, 2019	The Day A Republican Seanator @RandPaul voted with the Democrats to leave our borders wide open for drugs, gangs, terrorist, human &amp; child trafficking &amp; illegals draining our nations wealth providing millions of voters to Dems. https://t.co/TsXJsUE7gf
@WWavesforever THE INSURANCE POLICY
The fake Dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton. The FISA‚Äôs were based on a lie. The FBI &amp; the DOJ became the witch hunt. Rendering this 3 year long investigation as a biggest farce ever perpetrated on our nation. Master Puppet Barack Hussein to destroy our country.
Angel Moms should be standing outside @RandPaul office immediately
If Nader &amp; his goons want to investigate wealth of our billionaire President and his family earned over a lifetime, we will investigate how the swamp with their $174K salary lead them to millions dollar mansion &amp; private jet setting &amp; multi-millions in their checking accounts.
Did @RandPaul not see the hundreds of billions of cocaine &amp; fentinol apprehend by Border Patrol ? Enough to killed the entire population of America.
If he thinks his neighbor whopped his ass, what does he think MS-13 would do to him? They would render his children Fatherless. He hasn‚Äôt been paying attention. They stabbed you 1000 times, cut out you eyes, after they behead you with an axe. These gangs are now targeting LEO.
@buzzman888 @ArizonaKayte @RepJerryNadler Swamp Rat = Term Limits.
