.@padresolalinde ‚Äì an open supporter of Mexico‚Äôs new president ‚Äì refuses to accompany migrants beyond Mexico City and told me the caravans are causing political problems on both sides of the border
Most Catholic-run migrant shelters refuse to accept caravans, consider the convening of caravans to be reckless and find caravan travellers full of false hope. They also think it‚Äôs a bad idea to bring so many migrants to Mexican border cities, which are often insecure
Mexico‚Äôs interior minister says ‚Äúthe evidence is damning‚Äù against Pueblo Sin Frontera ‚Äì which the Mexican government accuses of recruiting migrants to join caravans. PSF flatly denies the accusation and says it doesn‚Äôt organize caravans in Central America https://t.co/TufIYCoLwA

@escritor_mexica It's sad that the business model of many Mexican media outlets is government advertising
@escritor_mexica You get foolish questions at press conferences everywhere
@jameslfredrick @EPN EPN's press attacks were much more underhanded: spyware, control through advertising and other threats
Apparently, this problem in Mexican media means AMLO supporters don't want to hear questions from people they think were easy on EPN ‚Äì but also any question (however legitimate) from any reporter, which might put the president in an uncomfortable position
The reason for the displeasure with posing tough questions to the president is that a lot media outlets during the @EPN administration went soft on the then-president and attacked AMLO

And the obsession with building a big refinery and selling cheap gasoline https://t.co/FUgqznrazD
