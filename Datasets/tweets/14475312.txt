@f_storms @BrianaMorgaine @Bplans @liveplan @paloaltosoft Richard, are you suggesting that using tools, resources, or advice about naming a business makes you "incapable of naming your business?" Isn't using available help generally a good idea? Does that make you "incapable?" That seems harsh to me.

Ouch! Or they've found true happiness ... or one of them is lying? #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/NHyQv5dvaO
A10: peas in a pod. Correlation *and* causation. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/Usp7y5eSyl
A8: Isn't that the natural process, stepping stones, of growing up? Win some lose some, swallow some losses, open up your mind and learn, state your problem honestly, then brace yourself. A good boss will appreciate it, a bad boss won't. So deal. That's life #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/Yk9s9pgPAa
A7: Listen, understand, digest. Be able to restate either side. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/y6HElHclvf
A6: Too often it means leaving sores to fester ... breeding regret, frustration, and disappointment ... until we trip on the toxic conflict that should have been avoided. The problem is knowing which is which. #BizapaloozaChat. Not my strength, for sure. https://t.co/0jbJjgGXcb
Amen to that one. Brilliant, sad, and true. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/FZd0i88sc5
A5: Isn't it possible that conflict is either win-win or lose-lose, almost never win-lose? #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/IhbYPjh0WU
A4 ... I heard a new phrase recently, used in an ebook by @d_scott ... "Motivational Listening." Brilliant. #BizapaloozaChat
A4: First diagnose ... conflict isn't generic. Some conflict is unacceptable, divisive, unfounded. And some conflict is the seeds of growth, innovation, and strength. Nurture the good conflict and squash the bad. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/Gdk8FJEKvn
true that #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/KUrfsCXaS2
A3: I could say that the purpose of conflict is growth. But damn. Truth is some conflict is just toxin, no purpose and no benefit. And some conflict is as necessary as rainy days. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/64pSs1q1wl
beautiful! Thanks @quickmuse for this one. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/vJXf8nrey0
A2: Conflict is to life and most relationships as rain is to weather. We're all so frustratingly human. Until we perfect people (fat chance) conflict is part of the healthy mix of being human and not isolated. #BizapaloozaChat. https://t.co/tpzF3IJGpn
@_TomGReid @MarkC_Avgi @DIYMarketers Oh no, @_TomGReid wait a minute ... d'ya mean sarcasm is conflict? Oh dear. üòØ#BizapaloozaChat.
A1: My problem with this question is that I mistrust mine and everybody else's self assessment on how we are in conflict. It's like how everybody thinks they are good at driving and strategy. Everybody thinks they avoid conflict. Then they don't. #BizapaloozaChat. &amp; ostrich https://t.co/wvV3RpuSFk

The Role of Statistics in Business Decision Making  by @alevit via @AmexBusiness | OPEN Forum https://t.co/eskru7oNv1 #smallbusiness
I gotta go now thanks all for an excellent #BizapaloozaChat and especially @DIYMarketers for keeping this going all the time, while the rest of us come and go. üôè
A10: Participate in social media offering useful information, and being informative, funny, interesting, and true. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/X3tmrLEpLJ
A9: Write a book and promote the book. Sell it or even give it away to some large organizations as a premium for membership. Share your expertise on a blog or guest posts. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ucKRpEDKae
A8: I'll be forever grateful to @SaldanaHM who suggested back in the 1980s that there was a product to be created from my consulting business. It's so much easier to promote a product than to promote oneself. Executing on that thought changed my life #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/9u4LAYj5Cz
A7: Worlds apart. Spamming is always bad, like shouting into a crowd. Self promotion is offering information about yourself to people who want it, when they want it, in the right context and the right degree. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/6lQbhStik9
A6: Easy for me. I love it when there's a forum or platform that makes self promotion easy. In that context, I love a microphone ‚Äî when asked. When it's what's expected. Love it. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/16IMZhk80X
A5: Could there be a bipolar reality with this, so that self promotion is typically either raw unaccomplished newbies, on one end, or successful people who take it as a part of a successful business, on the other. Two extremes, ends of the curve?  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ua2RhfnRX1
A4: I wrote "Irony: seems like people who call themselves experts, gurus, mavens, and inspirational speakers usually aren‚Äôt." Am I too cynical? That was in https://t.co/xLLWHdgtFw #BizapaloozaChat
A4: As I was growing up I was taught that bragging was unseemly and one's work should stand for itself. Too bad that's attitude doesn't work well in business. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/68wlwaSczj
A1 Good point, and important. Mix is important in this question. Some small percentage of self promotion is acceptable, right? Too much is ugh, off-putting, counter productive. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/XLNC883psu
A3: Yes @DIYMarketers has my answer. I second that, word for word. It's tough to handle because marketing is fundamental for any real business, and the individual (as in the expert business) should also be marketing. But its hard to let go the misgivings. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/fjmLlQkAZ4
@DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic @Bplans @liveplan Cool! I'll be available. üòÄ
A2: It's a hashtag.  I tried for a while to get away with it by adding the hashtag #humblebrag ... y'know, kind of self deprecating ... but I stopped it quickly because my efforts seemed awkward and obvious and the self-deprecating hashtag didn't work. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/YAlSLEf5C4
Yeah, me too, but in my decades in the expert business I've seen that the work speaking for itself is a bit of a luxury.  We live in an attention-starved world and promotion, done right, creates attention #BizapaloozaChat  I wish I'd been better at it. https://t.co/SbztfAsB1Z
@IvaIgnjatovic @DIYMarketers Working for @bplans and @liveplan plus summer hiking trips with daughters and vacations with family, a big family reunion, lots of stuff. Thanks for asking #BizapaloozaChat
A1: I envy people who do self promotion well. I think I could have accomplished more if I'd been more at ease with it. #BizapaloozaChat My problem has been so many people do it poorly and come off as full of themselves and obnoxious. I never wanted to be one of those. https://t.co/WFz1tYLJQ2
Apologies to @DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic and other regulars .... lots of good reasons like busy, vacations, travel, and more busy .... sometimes the 5 pm time where I am is hard #BizapaloozaChat but I missed you.
Finally back to #BizapaloozaChat this afternoon ... seems like it's  been forever, because it has been weeks and weeks ... one thing after another, but I've missed it sorely

A9: About 10 years ago had someone in my company who was out sick post a selfie on Facebook. At the beach. Oops. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/KDnfRIN7Gu
A8: Photoshop. Take a selfie of yourself and replace you with somebody else. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/7i9LFDJw23
A7: Because mirrors. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/0SQeS7xZcS
Wow 	@_TomGReid you are really on with the images today. üëç #BizapaloozaChat
Ok then my bad ... that was me that introduced the head shot theme. I was trying to help selfie-obsessed people rationalize. No more Mr. Nice Guy then. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/thZPEXIM5b
Yes, of course this is generational. And for lots of good honest reasons. Any normal human finds their relationship with mirrors grows steadily worse over time. Fact of life. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/2TX62KTdL9
A4: Honestly, I appreciate selfies when they come from the special people in my life. I'm grateful they swallow the vanity and shoot it and send it. But that's just a few people special to me. For all other humans, sorry, boring. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/xgjvgmqf74
A3: The point isn't what selfies communicate, but rather, can they? Do they? Is a selfie a useful tool? I've never considered selfies as communication, but maybe I should have. That's a thought-provoking question. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/SkjC3jMBQj
And on the other hand, let's be honest here, almost everybody in business has to have a head shot now and then for business purposes ... most of us show them here on Twitter. Right? Isn't that a business-practical link to the motivations involved in selfies? #BizapaloozaChat
A2: I think it's a natural extension of all of us being so damn human ... it's just technology giving us the equivalent of a mirror on steroids. And don't tell me normal humans don't look at mirrors. #BizapaloozaChat  Selfies are just that instinct amplified. https://t.co/iwmpyHn5Vi
@DIYMarketers One thing my world doesn't need is a new way to offend people. #whoneedsthat #BizapaloozaChat
Aw come on, let's be fair ... so do teenage boys, men, women, old, young, and people in between too. Let's not blame selfies on young girls only. Harummpgh. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/jY8yIIuvoa

Well said ... great image ... and is that not also a picture of collaboration? #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/PbhJLTff5Y
My favorite quote on selfies: "If you want to know what someone fears losing, watch what they photograph." #BizapaloozaChat
Oh dear no, not me, my wife and daughters would re ROTFL at that ... fashion and I live in different universes. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ZrJMTUC8C4

Definitely my favorite answer #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/hLKYdnku7m
A7: Depends on context, object or person making the impression, and the person receiving the impression too. Some of us care about factor X more than others. #BizapaloozaChat First impressions are in the eye (ear, nose, etc.) of the beholder. To some extent. https://t.co/EpZlI6qnC1
A5: Doesn't that depend a lot of the specifics, and also the person? One person is fixing on appearance, another voice, a third the handshake, maybe somebody fixing on something as substantial as what's being said? Or is it all the same? #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/vG9jl2oKdV
A4: Because people are all of us so irritatingly annoyingly human. We think with a blink. And we dig in quickly. All because that's easier. the routine is easier, and deciding once and sticking to it is easier. It's so much lizard brain ... but so are we. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/6ieyp47L62

Thanks again @Bizapalooza and @DIYMarketers and all of you for another fun #BizapaloozaChat
A10 I vote for @seqadvisory and @IvaIgnjatovic answers to this one. I'll drink to that (either one) #BizapaloozaChat
A9: Sure. All you do is redefine "it all" and "now" to make that work. Cheryl Crow lyrics from 'Soak up the Sun' come to mind: 	"I don't have digital	I don't have diddly squat	It's not having what you want	It's wanting what you've got" 	#BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/lEql4eudWQ
Yes "Harness the Power of Fear." https://t.co/KaCbQXnms4 #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/rDQbbeZcOV
A8: yeah. And nothing I do works all that well ... we are all so annoyingly human at times. I think what I actually do is become a royal pain. Not Zen enough ever.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/R1WMCLTaPr
RT @DIYMarketers: @_TomGReid @RJinTO @Timberry Hmmm I'm feeling a new hashtag coming on #FakeFomo		#BizapaloozaChat
A7: First get all the info you can, do the homework, get the data, and then throw it into the soup along with instinct and gut, and boil long enough to trust it, and then season to taste. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/C6rqVSpjqQ
A6: OMG no. I get so many opportunities to do, say, think, be the wrong thing. Go down the wrong path. F things up. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Sr4ZcnTzfY
Yes, exactly; but that's just the dark side of it. It's also a force for good, leads us to try new things and stay open. And ‚Äì to reinforce a theme ‚Äì drink from every cup. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Iv96JeFtK3
A5: FOMO is a force, to be harnessed for good ‚Äì awareness, alertness, openness to new things, etc. ‚Äì or can become too. It's what we do with it, and how we use it, that matters. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/XRakfyVeS6
A4 we used to have blocks of time, hours at a time, when we could focus in and do just one thing. We were able to get so much more done! #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/2PN9LYvigk
Dorrie I love that image too but it's not a movie. It's a photo ... I took it ... of my wife and two of our daughters, in Yosemite, below Vernal Falls. So long ago that we could still safely drink the water (sigh...)  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/SWp6iSVpqG
A3: It doesn't "force" us. It tempts us, invites us, eases us unconsciously into moving too fast, like the warm water invites the frog to sit until it boils.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/xuWfq7B45U
A2: For me it takes a time machine to go back to when we could dip a tin  cup into any stream in the High Sierra and drink that cold clear  bracing water without worrying about ciardia or salmonella or the like  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/BohddigEkw
serious or not, still made me laugh. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/PAJfbLFvtF
A1 to me it means new things, new tastes, smells, experiences, open up, live more, don't necessarily stick to the interstate on the journey. #BizapaloozaChat don't knock it 'til you've tried it. https://t.co/Vec8KDjR83
Nice Spring days, breaking into blue skies and reaching 70s in the afternoon ... but don't tell anybody. The party line is that it is always gray and raining in Oregon. Keep the secret. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/yGxcd4JCkN
OK I'm joining from Eugene OR USA   #BizapaloozaChat
@DIYMarketers At least last week I missed #BizapaloozaChat for a good reason ... visiting daughter and her husband who recently moved back to Oregon (Portland) from NYC.
Looking forward to #BizapaloozaChat today, at the top of the hour. I have to miss it too often.
My answer to How can you be leftist and an entrepreneur? https://t.co/yqnD4lIiQb
Yay! Congrats to @OctaneAI featured app in @Shopify ... with great metrics. CMO @BenParr says "we have made our customers over $1,000,000 in additional revenue" since launch last month. No, I'm not objective, but still, great to see a startup making money for its users. https://t.co/L8BvbGLVbt
How Your Browsing Behavior Affects What You Pay Online https://t.co/RanlJyXr05 "personalized pricing" ‚Äì your browser knows how much you'll pay; and is selling that info to stores, airlines, etc. Gulp. https://t.co/WfPvxn41sg
@ABQDaddyDoms Sorry, totally positively absolutely not what I do, not what I know, not what I want to do, ever.
RT @OutpostTeam: If your team uses inboxes like info@ &amp; sales@ then you know that email gets‚Äîcomplicated.		We're helping teams end the hass‚Ä¶
@ABQDaddyDoms Not my expertise. What I do know as an investor is that patents are hard to get and a lot of them don't protect anything well enough to be worth money. And businesses scam patent hopefuls too. So go carefully, with people you trust, and good luck with it.
My answer to What advice would you give to startup founders seeking angel investors? https://t.co/0hAcL62LPP https://t.co/3mTZ4RU4ht
@ABQDaddyDoms Tough one. I've never heard of anybody paying anything for an idea. Transactions do happen after things are locked up into a patent, but rarely, because few patents are actually worth real money. And getting the patent is either hard work, big bucks, or both.  &amp; Go Irish.
Thanks for the mention. üòÄ https://t.co/HiQDTyVJ9X

A10: Easy one for me. "You should marry her." 48 years later, still married to her. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/s37ILze9Qm
Mark, @Mark_BCP I like that. Straight and honest. And me too, by the way. Exactly what you said. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/MZrBBtTVWq
A8: I never thought of my nerdy me-centric business plan software business https://t.co/MOWYT8tFJz as a family business ... until my children grew up. My daughter @MommyCEO took it on from a running start and grew it stronger and better than ever. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/v3BL33dGiC
A7: First, ask, listen, and ask more, and really listen. Dig into the weeds. Figure out what specifics worry you, and why. Share those specifics, in detail, not the big picture. And listen really well, again, and ask more questions. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/pAEj6pP5lp
A6: What frustrates me about the idea of friendship is fake friendship. Confusion between friendship and expedience, selling, clients, customers, mailing lists, and ‚Äì my least favorite ‚Äì the alleged business practice of 'networking' #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/xDmXsncHbE
A5: Telling the truth when it's hard. Easy truth rolls off the tip of your tongue. Hard truth takes time and effort, and caring. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/bBawSN2mk4
A4: no offense to anybody, but the more friends you have, the weaker your definition of friendship. Apologies for curmudgeondom. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/TFr1E2vIEl
Wow @TaxHacker I love the West Wing reference. Great story. I just saw that one last week, by coincident (rewatching West Wing to remember what the US was supposed to be)  #BizapaloozaChat
A2 for me it's a long slow understanding of the importance of quality over quantity. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/xVuI7DLcze
A1: Friendship is the ultimate reciprocity. The only way to really have a friend is to really be a friend. Recursive to an extreme. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/oLBOWh3bJb
@DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic Yeah, been a good long while. Not playing Waldo or Carmen Sandiego, just wrong place and wrong times ... #BizapaloozaChat  ... all good.

Gotta run (two words that contradict our whole chat) but thanks @DIYMarketers and all for another fun chat.  #BizapaloozaChat
Ha, you could scroll down ... but it's not your memory, it's that Q9 woke us all up to all of that real life and consequences baggage that kind of contradicts the good side of wild. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Sk0Okr1xPt

A8: Struggling to come up with an appropriate Yoda-like phrase for the paradox in this one. If it's wild all the time then it's not so wild, right? Wild to the extreme becomes just plain crazy? Or some such... #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ZfA8g9UzK7
A6 It's the natural condition of being a parent. You learn to live with it. Take the good with the bad, and all that #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/LcuoqxZ5ht

My answer to How can I find a startup idea? https://t.co/TFsk2qj3iM #startups https://t.co/HkKdAyC9ke
@IanGertler @IvaIgnjatovic Thank you Ian and Iva  #BizapaloozaChat
Amen. Great visual. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/jXWAeU7VEN
@DIYMarketers @JKatzaman Green tea doesn't cure insomnia, that's for sure. #BizapaloozaChat
A5 Not for me anymore, for sure ... but decades ago, when I was an undergrad at U. of Notre Dame, the local bars in South Bend used to all serve green beer on St. Pattie's Day. And not green beer as in very fresh, but green as in the color. I bet they still do. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/vzkBIqUXl3
Don't want to spoil all the warm and fuzzy, and I consider myself fortunate indeed for many reasons ... but I can't resist adding, just to temper it all, that a person I much admired used to say, when luck came up, "the harder I work the luckier I get." #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/pIN2YTrYnZ
I know that long uphill feeling. I had to learn to enjoy the view where I was, on the way up, instead of rushing to get to the mirage-like top that isn't really the top. #BizapaloozaChat Slow down an enjoy the climb. https://t.co/EIDDqkOOYw
A3: I believe that life is better when the good luck is coupled with gratitude and acknowledgement that I've had good luck. Nothing spoils good luck as much as whining that there wasn't more of it. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/uujZKrXr2e
Aha! there's a 'great minds think alike' moment, for sure (re my A2) Although you said it more concisely. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/U0VylXzvst
A2: Problematic. For me at least, the metaphorical pots of gold are like climbing the next hill, thinking that it's the top ... and finding there is always a next hill beyond that one I was aiming for #BizapaloozaChat Who remembers the song "the bear went over the mountain?" https://t.co/z5Dns7tgmO

Thanks all &amp; @DIYMarketers and @Bizapalooza for another great #BizapaloozaChat ... it's gotten to big to try to list names. That's a good thing. Great subject, questions, people. Thanks all üëè
@steve_dodd Yeah, I see that, but lovin' it. Great minds and all. That's a good thing. üëç#BizapaloozaChat
Wow, hats off for this one, so excruciatingly true. Two thumbs up for @Kathryrnclang #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/VkfrJBglWt
A10: 1.) Save the planet. Environment and climate 2.) Reverse the cycle that makes money = political power = more money = more power. End the trend of distribution of wealth. 3.) Education for all. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/l0stPh1tsC
A9: Exactly. Make this my answer to Q9 too. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/uVKNGeVV6P
@DIYMarketers Yeah, I got that, but still. At least a year. #BizapaloozaChat
A8: Gulp, an hour? What? That's harsh. Can I have a century? Maybe a decade? How about at least a year. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/cz9igS6n6u
A7: I second @Steve_Dodd. John Lennon's 'Imagine' #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/3Y4lF42pn1
@IvaIgnjatovic @mark_BCP @_TomGReid .@IvaIgnjatovic makes a good point here. #BizapaloozaChat
A6: Education for all, everywhere. And connectivity for all. And potable water, and homes, and health care. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/dLtZwjdxsY
A5: I'm with @_TomGReid and @Mark_BCP on this one. Golden rule. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/0KWudNx6Bp
Amen to that, and here's saying from your lips (or keyboard) to God's ears. I sure hope so. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/pYx5IFdRDi
A4. The keyboard. Camera and video recorder in everybody's pocket. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/4QyjZ9xFh7
And separated opinion from fact, and strove to make fact as objective and evidence-based as humanly possible (disclaimer: I was mainstream journalist for 10 years, in the 1970s) #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/G5lK9A0w4s
A3: I'm interested to see what others recommend. I can't think of a single one. That is a tall order. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/zDHOXxeBTd
I'd like to think that's called education. But maybe that's hopelessly old-fashioned of me, or hopelessly optimistic of education. Sigh.... #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/iqZAu16f6O
@DIYMarketers Yes, in a way ... decades ago when the FCC fairness doctrine required equal time, and media businesses had to appeal to the middle, with fact and evidence based reporting, to survive. #BizapaloozaChat
A2: that sense of powerless that is spreading like an infection. A version of the cat in the hat ‚ÄúAnd this mess is so big. And so deep and so tall, We cannot pick it up. There is no way at all!‚Äù #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/4qdoJsyKIf
Yes please. And could we, maybe, please, also separate 'will of the people' into categories that differentiate people who actually follow and understand issues from lemming and sheep people who blindly follow their tribe no matter what? #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/RFmP20YbAE
A1: I would develop a pervasive add-on to give some kind of a truth (as in research, evidence, science) rating to plaster all over the Internet to distinguish actual evidence-based reporting from propaganda and lies. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/DRlSVZasi9
@JKatzaman @DIYMarketers @mark_BCP @AskWhatNext I saw that too, really interesting piece. Ironic though that I wouldn't have seen it if hadn't have shown up on @Medium ... and now here it is on Twitter (given the point the author makes) #bizapaloozachat

Gotta run thanks all for #BizapaloozaChat
A10: clean energy (fingers crossed) #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/AmUuqGimET
Yes, thanks for this one, totally agree. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/7bGtAlnKZu
A9: I absolutely love the trend away from massive big enterprises and towards smaller more focused businesses that live on their authentic stories ‚Äì their fundamental differences ‚Äì more than fabricated branding. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/kuV7H7b5Lu
A8: some trends stick and become mainstream when they make life, and people, better. When they improve us. For example, authenticity, transparency, tolerance, human rights, equal rights. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/2uhawpF0wH
A7: I've always jumped on technology, from way back in the 70s through today, the latest and greatest seems like the right way to go. Especially portability, and keyboards, and connectivity. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/BkEVXNHtcf
Yes, thanks, there you go. In a nutshell. @Seqadvisory: "Vision." Jobs, Gates, etc.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/pTvV3XirP8
A6: Yeah ... watch what the millennials are doing. Or better still, middle schoolers. Funny how often that works these days. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/kDGmOnlv5k
Yes. It's not that necessity is the mother of invention ... it's that invention is the mother of necessity. Because it's possible, we want it. Today's game-changing innovation becomes tomorrows necessity. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/RBJjNiKPLy
A4: Some trends are precursors of permanent change. Some are just fashion, temporary, in essence trivial. And where the trend lives, what it's about, makes a huge difference. Authenticity, for example, matters. Bell-bottom pants don't. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/zEDKLAbZHi
For me I have more questions than answers ... is trend vs. movement a matter of permanent change, evolution towards better? Irreversible change (I hope)? #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/zuTopHKJnN
A2: Can we call #Metoomovement  a trend? I'd like to think it's a tipping point, a sea change forever,  evolution of consciousness of right and wrong ... so a phenomenon. Is it  a trend? #BizapaloozaChat
Forecasting Models: What You Need to Know - Bplans Blog https://t.co/jWnN25GY0L #forecasting #businessplan #businessplanning via @Bplans #financials https://t.co/325AOW6lJa
Yes, thanks, there you go. Well said. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/2sLE9zZXqy
A1: As I've gotten older, probably predictably, I've grown more aware of the trade-offs of moving too fast towards mirage trends that wear out before they really take hold. Reacting too quickly to trends can turn one into a follower, not an original. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/zeFyEIfDBk

True that. So that one thing is way way short of enough. It's that plus truth telling, education, integrity ... lots of one candle lighting too. IMO. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/vu9RFO9jm9
Thanks Ivana, but no. And blushing. I had to change and I did. That's all I'm saying. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/DtBOFpH3FZ
A10: First, make laws governing prejudice and enforce them. Second, guarantee equal opportunity (not equal results, necessarily, but equal opportunity for sure). Third, collective telling of the truth. Repeatedly. Rinse and repeat.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/TcmpKBYSmx
A9: Me? White male, born in 1948. Years of realizing how my whole demographic grew up prejudiced in several ways. I was raised to oppose racism &amp; xenophobia but we were all homophobic and male chauvinists. The choice was change or be an a-hole, I prefer change. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/E2wZxixO3s
A8: I suppose there is an entire taxonomy of types and subtypes, degrees, threat levels, resistance levels ... #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/UdDHxIpTAS
A7: Take awareness -- essential first ingredient, which is why ignorance plays such a strong part in prejudice -- and add integrity and a healthy sense of right and wrong.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/LaPIPOW236
A6: Hmmm ... could it be that we are aware of assumptions, normally, as we make them ... and prejudice is a quiet insidious toxin that poisons us without us realizing? #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/8VYda8UBbQ
A5: Experiencing prejudice inspires some to be better, to resist, to fight against it ... and, sadly, makes others believe it, accept it, and unintentionally settle on status quo. We need to cheer those who fight, and inspire those who settle #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/v2sYOUjQPG
A4: It's absolutely essential. Humans can evolve, and change, for the better. We can at least acknowledge we are equal. We can overcome the prejudices we inherited. We cannot let ourselves be divided into tribes. #BizapaloozaChat Even if some people work for division on purpose. https://t.co/GGmiAVafmF
Respect to @Mark_BCP "Narrow mindedness. Influence by others. Fear. Hatred. Jealousy." And let's add in ignorance, and also demagogues whip us prejudice to control followers, create a common enemy, manipulate #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/JStnVdgv0z
A2: We pre-judge to simplify. A cloudy day is probably cold, south on 101 to San Jose probably has traffic. The problem is that when we do it with people, we all lose. It becomes noxious, toxic. Justifies hate and fear. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Z3NRvCriDU
"All we are saying, üé∂ is give peas a chance." #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/8XD1Faq8ep
A1: Ignorance. Pat answer, perhaps, maybe too trite, but think about it. Prejudice is an acquired trait, influenced by fear, but it can't thrive without ignorance. Babies aren't prejudiced. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/y2EB7DGbZy
Hi Iva, funny how we like the good weather of course but we do get used to normal, meaning (in our case) gray and rainy in February. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/V8hgMhFewt

A4: Television. Streaming. My timing, not the networks. HD and yes, wow, UHD. Due regards to Perry Mason, Bonanza, Twilight Zone, Dick Van Dyke show and all that, what we get these days is amazing. Sense8 in UHD, for example.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/JcHOEscwtI

Thanks all for another interesting #bizapaloozachat ... so many of us tonight, delightful chat, thanks to all. Thanks especially @Bizapalooza and @DIYMarketers and @StrategyStew (multiple personalities?)
Thank you, blushing, nah, you ask the right questions. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/wTsGDqxTLM
A10: Imagine a flock of birds flying so close that they make a pattern in the sky. Then think of each bird as a decision made, and how a continuum of congruent decisions creates a pattern. Often big goals can only be achieved as collections of small decisions. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/wS9767zdO1
A8: Polar opposites. Living in the moment is settling in for a while to think about this one. Instant gratification is jumping to Q9. It's relaxing into peace with what's there instead of grabbing for what's next. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/QIRqyLBgh8
And in that context, yeah, skepticism has become a survival skill. Sifting truth from oft-repeated lies. God grant me the courage to tell the truth, the patience to resist lies, and the wisdom to tell the difference. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/UKziZwiePw
A6: Anger. Angry words, emails, tweets ... anger is not always biodegradable ... especially when it spills from words into typed words. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/PhcTUJNIpg
laughing, y'got that right! #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/ZstKNCtRaw
But no, wait ... what about slow dancing? Slow food? Slow isn't always bad, right? #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/zO1KUn1J9g
A5: Isn't civilization and socialization at least in part about putting a hard protective shield around temptations? We build rules that include a lot of "no, not that" or at least waiting for the right when and where. Emphasize waiting #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/mKNtPKp9yv
Thanks Iva, right? Don't we all hate waiting? It's a necessary evil, at best.  #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/ZCljQu4HtJ
For me it's bandwidth speed from the Internet provider. Give me instant change at the same millisecond I click the mouse, or press my finger. No reason to wait, no inherent reward for waiting, extreme impatience. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/AmWXsoCDMs
A3: Hmmmm is it a culture of impatience, or have humans always been impatient and technology gives us more instances more often of immediate delivery, so the bar goes up, we expect instant, and complain quickly when we have to wait #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/QUZsL3qj2d
A2: That one's troubling. I'd end up quibbling over the circumstances, lots of 'it depends' and 'sometimes' and 'it depends.' Instant gratification isn't all bad. Like a software download, tell me it's bad if the download happens immediately. No, right? #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/wPQJD52TTY

A10: My favorite #smallbiz hack is: Planning as management. Not the big business plan, but the @leanbizplan that is small, focused, easy to do, and reviewed and revised regularly. I love the quote: "the plan is useless; but planning is essential." #bizapaloozachat
Hmm ... secrets to small business success? @Rieva says "people who listen are more successful than people who don't." @BarryMoltz adds "It's really hard to listen after you've had some success. #bizapaloozachat
A9: My tip for business owners is STOP trying to please everybody. Divide and conquer. Focus. Trying to please everybody is the secret to small business failures #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/5VaORlUZaA
A8: As a business grows, it needs to respect functional channels and functional expertise. A very small business might be able to manage by consensus, but a growing business needs to respect fundamental differences between functional areas #bizapaloozachat
A8: Don't know the secret to delegation, but I do know that the secret to guarantee micromanagement and failure of delegation is to second-guess results on tasks you delegated. Shut up and empower, or you doom yourself to constant micro management #bizapaloozachat
Love this: @Rieva says people are looking at negative reviews to see "if there is a thread of authenticity" that makes reviews credible. My take: people can smell fake from a mile away #bizapaloozachat
@ramonray Ramon, BTW, big wave, all the best :)
A7: Don't kid yourself. Getting your team to buy into your vision or mission is not about what you say, formally; it's what you decide. And it's what you do, day to day, all day every day. Live it yourself, or forget it #bizapaloozachat
Yes, well said. Planning is steering your business. And it's planning, with regular review and revision, not just the plan.  #BizapaloozaChat cc @leanbizplan https://t.co/E8wlli7d5R
Interesting. Quoting @CarolRoth, @BarryMoltz says if the business is all about you, then you don't have a business, you have a job. So learn to bring in others, delegate, and let it be all about the customer, not all about you.  #bizapaloozachat
A5: There is paradox here. Entrepreneurs are people who do things their own way. Almost by definition, they are different, each individual. So we can't do the profile of the generic entrepreneur. IMO #bizapaloozachat
Yes, so important. @Rieva says small businesses should not compete on price. I'd add that your price is your strongest marketing message, and low price doesn't work except for some very large enterprises like Costco #bizapaloozachat
A4: we definitely overvalue getting outside investment in entrepreneurship over the bootstrapped startup. Result is that people think getting investment is the goal. It isn't. Making the business work is the goal. Do it yourself and own it yourself is a good idea #bizapaloozachat
A3: Focus first on cash flow. Manage on cash flow, money in and money going out, and if you do that right, profits will likely follow. You'll see the key drivers earlier than if you manage just profits #bizapaloozachat
A2: on the other hand, I could easily argue that failure to offer real value to customers is an important part of business failures. Giving value can compensate for a lot of mistakes. #bizapaloozachat
A2: why small businesses fail data is skewed and distorted. Many causes, multiple factors, and few failed owners really know. But I'm with @Rieva and @BarryMoltz re planning and cash flow https://t.co/EfvCxfKcHz  #bizapaloozachat
A1: I started my business to escape boredom while not going broke. More time building software things, while still paying the mortgage and such. Do what I like and support the family at the same time. #bizapaloozachat
My congrats to @Rieva and @BarryMoltz for release of Small Business Hacks https://t.co/isFn2w0DqD #bizapaloozachat
So @Rieva says main causes of failure are 1.) lack of planning; and 2.) cash flow problems (that good planning might solve) and @BarryMoltz agrees with emphasis on cash flow statements. #bizapaloozachat

A10. Start with the understanding that the opposite of throwing yourself into uncertainty is either delusion or death. So yeah, hi there uncertainty, do come in. Make yourself comfortable. Plan to stay a while. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/SKEGrsEX3I
A9: the key to decision making is finding a balance between risk and reward; and understanding that each of us has our own risk relationship. No hard and fast rules. Know your self and your situation.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/3bzfiRqgLj
A8 somewhere in the mix there between leadership and uncertainty is the ability to gather the data, respect the information, do the work to know as much as possible ... and then the leap to not believe it. Or at least, not blindly. #BizapaloozaChat
A8: True. And also true that some of the worst nonleaders in positions of power, now and in the past, have had psychotic compulsions to strangle uncertainty with their megalomania. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/tRsn5QtFCl

A7: not knowing everything is a start. Knowing what we don't know is good too. Don't assume that anything that has always been true still is. Or that anything that was always wrong still is. Question every assumption.  #BizapaloozaChat
Thanks Iva for this one. Laughter and applause. New one to me, but yes, you got it.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/iwEmAvFRIH
A6: "Accept uncertainty?" Hell no! Embrace it. Make love to it. Source of wonder. #BizapaloozaChat
Yes, there it is. #BizapaloozaChat Exactly. https://t.co/Sr2KIXzIOB
A5 uncertainty is one of those things whose greatness comes from considering the opposite. No truth, no beauty, no dreaming of the future without uncertainty. It's the stuff of magic and mystery.  #BizapaloozaChat
right on! well said. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Ll9OvUBf6T
A3 and furthermore, think of it this way: uncertainty is why we play the game. #BizapaloozaChat
Exactly. And that process, when done right, is called planning #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/52zNCPiNfN
A3 and I've been a planner, professionally, for my whole adult life ... because planning and uncertainties are natural lovers. We don't overcome uncertainty. We plan for it. We invite it in for supper. And buy it breakfast.  #BizapaloozaChat
So we create imagined predictability, sort of like the turkey predicts the human is a friend for 999 days, then gets slaughtered on the thousandth. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/DWppQIA0Sh
A2: uncertainty makes us nervous because we're programmed wrong. We create false uncertainty to hide us from the stark reality of it. Sort of like we create fire to hide the darkness. Except the fire is real.  #BizapaloozaChat

RT @liveplan: As you look at growing and planning for your business in 2018, check out some of our best articles from 2017‚Äîincluding our up‚Ä¶
A10: for me, ironically, the key to making SWOT useful is to take it lightly. Don't let it be some ponderous MBA thing, just a useful tool to lighten the brain. Get out of the routine. #bizapaloozachat
A9 I've done planning for big companies and it's frustratingly slow, like charting a course for a very big boat. I love planning for smaller businesses and startups because you can get your arms around the whole thing. Speedboat fast and effective #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/7cgox8gRV5
A8 remember that strategy is focus. It's what you don't do as much as what you do. Think of the sculptor and strategy is what she removes from the block of marble.  And think strategy, tactics, milestones, and essential business numbers #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/mthvv3Chhp
A7 confession: when I've tried #SWOT for personal decisions, I look later and discover that I unconsciously tweaked the bullets to arrive at the conclusion my gut wanted to get to. But that's just me. And at least I was aware of it (sometimes) #bizapaloozachat
A6 For ideas and applications, in case it's useful, I've put the entire text and all illustrations of my latest book 'Lean Business Planning' for free on the web at https://t.co/L7Ebo2DOXk ... just click next and so on to read it there ... or browse key points #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/8vsEQn6azC
A5 for me #SWOT is powerful because it's simple, very easy to understand, and matches the way most people think. The key to any of these frameworks is whether they lead to useful ideas and clear thinking, which I think SWOT does #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/7UtVjRzw20
A4 use #SWOT as a warmup to a regular planning review. Use it to get unstuck. Use it to bring people together into a team, dealing with possibilities, as a first step to establishing a plan. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/d9vQM1UuAv
A3 #SWOT is brainstorming, which means a lot of bullets is better than just a few allegedly good ones. The first goal is quantity. Include everything. Don't sweat the categories that much, just get the ideas onto the lists. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/KtzATgY5aQ
A3 My article on SWOT Analysis https://t.co/jwHlZdo4Rp on @bplans and there's a downloadable template there #bizapaloozachat
A2 I start with SWOT: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Brainstorming, great for groups, gets us thinking about strategy.  Ultimately strategy is focus, doing what's most important instead of trying to do everything. SWOT gets the ideas flowing. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/VgnB4yujg4
A1 planning should be lean, just what you need, not big texts in the beginning. Planning these days gets a bad rep because too many people think of it as the old-fashioned formal use-once-and-throw-away business plan. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/DNiLJvpUet
OK I'm off to #bizapaloozachat as guest today, talking about SWOT and lean planning in general. My favorite chat each week and happy to be doing more today. Are you familiar with SWOT? Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities &amp; Threats? An easy entry into strategy, IMO https://t.co/GTJ6t1c9J1

A5 If I were more disciplined I would always use editing because I've never had editing that didn't make my work better. But damn, it is so hard to add that extra step, and that extra person, into the process. Takes so much patience. #BizapaloozaChat
#BizapaloozaChat chuckling. That's a yes this is really true "yeah really," not a sarcastic rolling my eyes "not really." Appreciate the question because it's so hard to tell. Really. https://t.co/wSe5CJX5AE
A3: I agree with others on how-to, make it useful, make it interesting ... but there's also a lot to  be said for 1.) make it real experience, with actual pain if it fits the context; and 2.) people like to read about fails, maybe even more than successes #BizapaloozaChat
"The competition for creating great content is huge" @Bizapalooza on  #BizapaloozaChat about blogging for 2018. Yeah, really.
Nice ... @Bizapalooza @Crestodina ... bandwidth and resolution very nice on your Facebook sharing this morning. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/hws2hftfws
joining #BizapaloozaChat ... I hope. @DIYMarketers, do I see you have Twitter problems? Mine seems normal.

Yes, that too. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/zededNAxMK
Yes. It's buying the symptoms instead of the cause. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/1jvH3lu01I
Good reminder: fundamentals #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ee0Imc89vs
A10: the most common mistake is impatience. What makes people know, like, and trust you, in social, isn't what generates quick measurable results #BizapaloozaChat
Microinfluence? Isn't that what parents have when kids become teenagers? (Sorry, couldn't resist) #BizapaloozaChat
A9 More money than time? Pay somebody to create content. Pay them to give the people you want to reach value in good information, advice, research ... to be useful, interesting, funny, inspiring #BizapaloozaChat
A8 more time than money? Give value. Create content. Give the people you want to reach value in good information, advice, research ... be useful, interesting, funny, inspiring  #BizapaloozaChat
Really good reminder thanks @SymphonicHQ #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/WxlCsTD79d
A7 in the real world, not everything of value can be tracked and measured. Return on relationship, for example? Long-term credibility, too #BizapaloozaChat
A7 measurement is a big problem because how do you measure a negative, i.e. what's the loss for lack of presence? It's not as simple as analytics suggest because selling and social are uncomfortable with each other  #BizapaloozaChat
A6 next question is about who you want to reach. Personas are a good tool. You need to understand the people you want to now, like, and trust you.  #BizapaloozaChat

So-o-o-o-o true: Patriotism vs. Nationalism, by Jen Sorensen https://t.co/aCi3DlDGHR thanks @SorensenJen and @thenib too. Makes me proud to be a patriot. https://t.co/N7By0QFxtP
I love it! Of course. The best intuition is guided by logic. üëç https://t.co/6sNvryz8yi
I have to run ... bye all and thanks for a great chat. @DIYMarketers, once again, you make me (and us, I assume, from the tweets) think. #BizapaloozaChat
A10 It's all about having a good match between the goal of the communication, the type of issue, and the styles of both communicator and listener #bizapaloozachat
A9 this question prompts the first time in a long time I find myself rooting against technology. My intuition tells me it can't happen, won't happen, and ought not to #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/4V27fY83Tl
A8 with intuition we have to guard against the tendency to assume that what didn't work in the past still won't work, and what worked in the past will still work. Clean the cobwebs. Question that when it happens.  #bizapaloozachat
Interesting thought. It has never occurred to me. Doesn't that kind of thinking insult men, women, and intuition? #BizapaloozaChat  (three for one) https://t.co/3oO9oomr4a
A7: That's stereotyping, not okay, obsolete and it was never that cute anyhow.  #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/sHJgQRm3U7
Yes, agree, this is an important insight. Logical thinking requires listener patience not always available for communication and relationships #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/Y6Xff6aNVo
Yes, I like that. Hadn't heard it. I like it a lot because intuition is often logic that's deeper than "just" logic. Intuition is rarely outright illogical. It's just not as easily parsed as real logic #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/ZVFaPX81hk
A5 False: intuition isn't as simple as emotional. It's experience, common sense, and subconscious too. But yes, logic is emotionless. #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/19owoGZfvH
A4 totally agree with @IvaIgnjatovic @DreaVilleneuve &amp; others that here too, you need both. Live in the middle, the convergence, not either side. #bizapaloozachat
Yes, agree ... and the opposite is also true ... force the data to submit to intuition. If things aren't right, figure out what's wrong (usually it will be bad data) #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/WgifOQTzsD
A3 (and a bit of A2) a powerful reality check is forcing common sense and logic into the same room with each other, and if either one is unhappy, then worry; something's not right #bizapaloozachat
A3 logic is reasoning that reaches conclusions via demonstrable steps. Common sense is jumping to a conclusion based on experience.Very different things.  #bizapaloozachat
A2 I want to improve my balance, to respect both sides fully. (Tweeted to the tune of Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now.'  #bizapaloozachat
Yes, thank you Tom, well said. What we need is balance. Dive into the data, wring it out, but don't trust it fully #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/J87pH6IXao
I like "intuition is another set of data" and I respect subconscious a lot too. Data's interpretation is wrong more often than people's interpretation #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/J0PjjYrrlj
Funny you should mention that ... I thought I was going to hate it ... but I'm always thinking about "on the other hand" so yes, turns out I like it #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/8C8S3kzVtN
A1 I'm a spreadsheet-and-analysis lover strongly influenced by intuitive. So I know when and why to ignore the analysis. #bizapaloozachat Myers-Briggs tests tell me I'm schizo
And yet I see lots of bad data, including illogical bad data, and way more logic in intuition. Intuition is mostly (but not always) logical. IMO #bizapaloozachat (repetitive because I forgot the hashtag, sorry) https://t.co/Vp0qUsVTV9
Ha, big grin.  I've seen a lot of illogical data in my time ... more than illogical intuition, in fact. Come to think of it I haven't seen much illogical intuition at all. https://t.co/Vp0qUsVTV9
Joining #bizapaloozachat tonight hi @DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic my question to start is why isn't it intuition vs. data or intuition vs. analysis. Intuition and logic isn't as much either-or. Do I have that wrong?

.@DIYMarketers @Dnewman @sittingpretty61 @radkejen @SuzanneStewart1 @IvaIgnjatovic @SmallBizOpinion @Clevecarole @KarenLKay thanks for another good #bizapaloozachat
A9 probably not a popular opinion any more, but I still think good writing, including grammar, spelling and such, is a good thing in content #bizapaloozachat
A8 Maybe it's just me, but I respect more the experts who can change, evolve, and admit having been wrong at one point or another. True experts can say "I don't know" and "I was wrong."  #bizapaloozachat
A7 I think the most common mistake in choosing a niche is choosing a niche instead of letting the niche and you morph together.  #bizapaloozachat
Brilliant: @DNewman says "You are the least interesting topic in your entire business."  #bizapaloozachat
A6. Social media is amplified word of mouth, potentially. But it only works with consistency and quality over the long term. Takes patience. Those who want instant gratification will be disappointed. Be interesting, useful, funny, unselfish; and don't sell  #bizapaloozachat
Thanks @DNewman great advice on not repelling comments. Lock on to them as testimonials. Always be collecting a kudos file. Golden. I've always been bad at that. I appreciate the reminder #bizapaloozachat
So @DIYMarketers and @Dnewman I think claiming "expert" is legit, but nobody should ever claim "guru" ... let that be said by third parties, or not at all.  Do you agree?  #bizapaloozachat
Yes, this is crucial. People turn off very quickly. And we can all smell fake from a mile away. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/iU3OaN5J0j
Yes, well said #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/kFV2B0WW5m
A3: One of the main components of trust is knowing, and admitting, what you don't know. Another of the shades of saying no.  #bizapaloozachat
Ok credit @DIYMarketers too on what you don't do. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/eb2hlpFhAC
hmmm @Dnewman you are channeling Michael Porter now, strategy is about what you don't do ... #bizapaloozachat  "I wasn't brave enough to write the niche book, so I wrote the general book instead." Cool!
A2: it's like sculpture, starting with a big block and chipping stuff off. To find your niche, carve out the things you aren't doing. Identify who isn't in your market. It's a redefinition of focus. #bizapaloozachat
Hey @dnewman, I love the concept of "commodity advice." I hadn't heard that phrase before, but it serves to label something that I've seen a lot of. Way too much "commodity advice" around the SMB world #bizapaloozachat
A1 not sure of secret to success; but I am sure the secret to failure is trying to please everyone #bizapaloozachat

Thanks again @bizapalooza @DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic @mark_BCP @JKatzaman @SmallBizOpinion nice chatting with you... 	 #bizapaloozachat
.@strategystew yes, of course, "You have to do a mix of both"  #bizapaloozachat
A10 in some ways it's a tough choice: you either pay or get a time machine to lever off consistency and history.  #bizapaloozachat
A10 ... but paying for attention is business, it makes money, I do it, most of us do it. Can we do biz without it?  #bizapaloozachat
A10: Organic reach is orders of magnitude more power, the equivalent of the traditional editorial vs advertising.... #bizapaloozachat
A9 I vote with @JKatzaman "algorithms are SEO get-rich-quick schemes." #bizapaloozachat
A9 harumph I don't like the algorithms of any of them.  #bizapaloozachat
.DIYMarketers that was nice of you, thank you #BizapaloozaChat https://t.co/qiDetygbMS
A8: Is anybody else amused, or threatened (I am both) by the idea of bots writing for algorithms for bots, recursively? #bizapaloozachat
A8 people can smell fake. I don't know about others, but I have to write for people not algorithms. Don't know any better  #bizapaloozachat
.@strategystew yes please. We used to call that options and preferences, and they were ours, not the algorithm's. #bizapaloozachat
A7 Damn so important. How to get respectfully-put stuff I disagree with, without signaling approval? Viewing ‚â† approving #bizapaloozachat
@DIYMarketers Ok we all know the problem, but don't exaggerate &lt;grin&gt;  #bizapaloozachat
Just for the record, a website is never done. Or ought not to be. Like sharks, keep moving or dead.  #bizapaloozachat
.@IvaIgnjatovic and there's the all-too-familiar "Hi [first name] ... "  #bizapaloozachat
A5: Facebook does monetization better than Twitter. Users might not like it, it might be bad for society, but share prices #bizapaloozachat
A5: @bizapalooza / @DIYMarketers you said earlier, it's about advertisers. I hate it but I also understand. It's a business #bizapaloozachat
.@mark_BCP re "haven't figured that out yet," thanks, I recognize myself there too, with a chuckle. Right on! #bizapaloozachat
@DIYMarketers oh yeah, good point ... and of course advertisers can buy attention on Twitter too.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 how about being useful, relevant, funny, interesting, and so on? Maybe that works? Sometimes (crosses fingers)... #bizapaloozachat
RT @strategystew: A3  Algorithms actually save me time, by showing me what I care about. #BizapaloozaChat
And oops, sorry for Q instead of A ... I hate it when I do that.  #bizapaloozachat
A3: But we have apps and such, hashtags, on Twitter. Right? Am I mistaken on that? Twitter is still algorithm free? #bizapaloozachat
RT @DIYMarketers: A3: Don‚Äôt be fooled. Algorithms aren‚Äôt about users, they are about advertisers. #BizapaloozaChat
A2: I want control. Give me buttons to check, drop down lists, options, and selections. Don't do it for me. Dammit.  #bizapaloozachat
A2: Algorithm-driven social media is doing terrible damage to our society. It's too easy to confuse bots with people. #bizapaloozachat
A1: And 140 has become a medium, powerful, unusual, and focused. It was different. I'm going to miss it a lot.  #bizapaloozachat
Thanks @IvaIgnjatovic fine for me, thanks.  You?	 #bizapaloozachat

.@DIYMarketers @steve_dodd @IvaIgnjatovic @JKatzaman @DreaVilleneuve @NiteStar @mark_BCP &amp; others good chat, venting.   #bizapaloozachat
A10 As in War Games the movie. The only way to win is not to play. Deal with your bad behavior and nobody else's.  #bizapaloozachat
A10: Huge question. Listen first. Think. Pause. Look in the mirror. Is it you? Give it time. Speak softly. Listen again.  #bizapaloozachat
A9 forgiveness heals the person who forgives as much or more than the person forgiven. It is its own reward.  #bizapaloozachat
@NiteStar Great point. #bizapaloozachat
Yes, right on! RT @steve_dodd "Bad behaviour with good manners is very dangerous!" So true, and important, too.  #bizapaloozachat
A8: bad manners strike me as awkward, unfortunate, but correctable, while bad behavior is more than that, and matters.  #bizapaloozachat
Because ‚Äì back to #stopbullying ‚Äì bullies win. They get attention. People back down. people get hurt.  #bizapaloozachat
A7 but while we reward attention more than integrity, success more than fundamental values, what can we expect?  #bizapaloozachat
A-whatever: Because we as a society reward bad behavior. Social media isn't the cause, it's the amplifier #bizapaloozachat
A6: Could we at least settle for not rewarding bad behavior? Maybe as a start towards recovery from where we are now?  #bizapaloozachat
@IvaIgnjatovic is it really their true nature, or are they lulled into it because they are surrounded by it?  #bizapaloozachat
A5 Just as understanding leads to good behavior, ignorance endorses bad behavior.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 So easy to be an ***hole while alone on a keyboard, facing anonymous printed words. Not fully human.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 Social media, sadly, amplifies the power and reach of bad behavior. Doesn't have to. But it's used that way.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 @DIYMarketers right on (again). Attention is now the pinnacle. We compete for attention, not respect.  #bizapaloozachat
A3: and when did the phrase "politically correct" override decency? As if bigotry is just"not politically correct"  #bizapaloozachat
A3 RT @DIYMarketers As human beings we CANNOT stand being wrong. We‚Äôd rather be right than be happy. So, we make excuses. #BizapaloozaChat
A3 we're training humans to be nasty by rewarding nasty humans. Who gets the table? Who gets the seat on the plane?  #bizapaloozachat
A2 seconding @StrategyStew clear evidence that anonymity increases meanness. Look at comments anywhere.  #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers @IvaIgnjatovic @steve_dodd Oops, not that I'm complaining about that. &lt;grins&gt;  #bizapaloozachat
A2 Yes, exactly: RT @DIYMarketers "not for the better. People feel they have the right to share whatever they are thinking" #bizapaloozachat
.@IvaIgnjatovic hi yes do jump in ... @DIYMarketers started asking for good news, but got none.  #bizapaloozachat
A1 I've recently reconnected with the work of Rob Sutton @Work_Matters, related to how to identify and deal with ***holes. #bizapaloozachat

@DIYMarketers Thanks for the thought but I've never been good at ad copy. Instead I got good software reviews back when reviews still mattered ...
A10: I get more from talking to 3 real people for 20 minutes each than from surveys of 10,000 #bizapaloozachat
RT @katrinajuliafit: Do you need clarity in #business #entrepreneur 	@liveplan is amazing!		&gt;10 years use + #7figureresults		#health #wealt‚Ä¶
A8 Razor-sharp focus. Empathy. Short crisp clean phrasing. Blind belief in product. Grammar optional.  #bizapaloozachat
A7 No. Copy that converts is a specialty skill. Know because I lack it completely. I'm a good writer. But not sales copy.  #bizapaloozachat
#Emailfail Just got invite to pay $1K to be listed in 'rising young entrepreneurs.' After 4 decades in business. Rolling my (old) eyes.
A4: Benefits not features. Jump out of yourself and see it as readers will read it.  #bizapaloozachat
A1 the secret to great sales copy is that you don't think of it as great sales copy when you read it. You just read it.  #bizapaloozachat

@DIYMarketers @Bizapalooza @mark_BCP @JKatzaman @IvaIgnjatovic and others thanks, nice chat.  #bizapaloozachat
.@JKatzaman "The joy of buying" is way too often short-lived and illusive.  #bizapaloozachat
A10 no question that in our society convergence of factors push people to buy things while hoping for experience.  #bizapaloozachat
RT @DIYMarketers: @DreaVilleneuve @Timberry New Hashtag! #RockYourSmile #BizapaloozaChat
Ivana @DIYMarketers wow, thanks for that about that disk. Good old days. You made my day. So there's my experience.  #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers the first time you chatted is great example of healthy relationship between things and experience.  #bizapaloozachat
A8 my first car transformed my life.  #bizapaloozachat
A8 my first computer (built my own in 1981) transformed my life.  #bizapaloozachat
Yes! RT @DIYMarketers I also think a lot of this stuff is about knowing what makes YOU happy. Not what society says #bizapaloozaChat
A7 parenthood. both best and worst.  #bizapaloozachat
A6 all of this stuff is about balance, give and take, specifics. Things can turn bad or good depending on factors #bizapaloozachat
RT @DIYMarketers @mark_BCP So sweet! My Nana always said, getting married is easy, staying married is the thing.  Right on! #bizapaloozachat
Mark @mark_BCP so cool re the ring exactly the same for me and my wife. 25th. For the same reason.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 wide range of relationship between things and experience. Things can heighten or detract. The skis and the run.  #bizapaloozachat
A3: Some things generate experiences. The car makes the drive.  #bizapaloozachat
A2: Tricky question. For example, I'd prefer a week at the beach to a month at the beach.  #bizapaloozachat
RT @IvaIgnjatovic: A1 I know one thing: having an Aston Martin (a thing) would bring so many SUPERB driving experiences #BizapaloozaChat
A1: I suspect there's a hierarchy of values factor too. People need food, clothing, shelter first, experience later.   #bizapaloozachat
A1: I've seen research that says experience makes us happier ... but then you can find research to prove anything #bizapaloozachat
We've certainly seen a lot of the dark side of Facebook these days.  #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers yes, pics and responses remind me of the good news from social media, while we have so much bad news.  #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers the wedding in the Cascades, no question.  #bizapaloozachat

Thanks @Bizapalooza @DIYMarketers @DreaVilleneuve @Tyr interesting chat once again.  #bizapaloozachat
And with my story, I have to admit, I was dealing with an ideal client. Smart, perceptive, demanding, fair.  #bizapaloozachat
S-o-o-o-o true @DIYMarketers: "you have to know the numbers of your business."  #bizapaloozachat
To manage dependency I asked my client, face to face, not in writing, for 3 months warning if problems loomed. They agreed. #bizapaloozachat
And @TYR hi Dustin (waves)  #bizapaloozachat
Yes and it led to seven more years of consistent repeat (but not exclusive) business. Worked out great.  #bizapaloozachat
There is so much paradox in this topic area. Because repeat business is golden. And focus is essential.  #bizapaloozachat
A8 to avoid dependency we have to constantly market new clients, but still respect repeat business. Very very hard to do.  #bizapaloozachat
@DIYMarketers Yes. Scary. Lucrative. But it was literally an offer I couldn't refuse.  #bizapaloozachat
Once a big client offered to buy all my hours for the next year if I promised to not work for competitors. I said yes.  #bizapaloozachat
A6 Once I managed to diversity within a large biz by consulting for different groups: Latin America, Japan, Europe, etc  #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers I guess I got you with sycophancia ... I made that word up. Comes from sycophant.  #bizapaloozachat
A6 yes the customer is always right, but the client not necessarily https://t.co/KjxysuE4eI  #bizapaloozachat
A5 stress, lack of sleep, sycophancia, fear ...if  it becomes about relationship instead of deliverables #bizapaloozachat

.@DIYMarketers, @Bizapalooza @IvaIgnjatovic @TheCharlesIBe @SmallBizOpinion @DreaVilleneuve &amp; others thanks for the chat #bizapaloozachat
Thanks Charles, great list! #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/3GvITQiqo9
A10: Causes of stress, triggers, are different between work and real life. But solutions are similar. IMO. Stress is stress #bizapaloozachat
RT @SmallBizOpinion A9) Coping and managing stress are similar. I prefer prevention: detecting &amp; removing it first #BizapaloozaChat
A9 coping with stress is surviving it. Managing stress is reducing it.  #bizapaloozachat
A8 but in the biology of it, stress makes all mammals run faster, jump higher, and lift heavier. It's not about efficiency #bizapaloozachat
@IvaIgnjatovic Yes, thank you.
A8: Deadlines, focus, necessity and so on make us more efficient. Stress just makes us more annoying.  #bizapaloozachat
A7: Say what? Me? How could you even suggest it. Not me! That could only have been their imagination. Sigh... #bizapaloozachat
A6 problem is that stress is physical, literally chemical, and in response to non-physical problems it's really bad for you #bizapaloozachat
A5: Laughter. I've literally stopped working and gone to Youtube to watch Robin Williams, Steven Wright, etc.  #bizapaloozachat
A5. Stop, pause, think, breathe. Close your eyes. Feel it. Recognize it, call it out. "This is me and my stress reaction."  #bizapaloozachat
@IvaIgnjatovic Iva I get it. It happens all too often. Creeps up and we don't realize. #bizapaloozachat
@TheCharlesIBe @DIYMarketers Thanks Charles (waves) I like your point about adrenaline rush. That makes sense. #bizapaloozachat
A4 sometimes in a spare moment, a pause, I'll realize that my upper jaw aches on both sides. That's stress.  #bizapaloozachat
A4 that's really tough, the frog in boiling water problem. Stress builds slowly and settles in. Can become habit.  #bizapaloozachat
.@Bizapalooza "I thrive on pressure" is more about focus, and competitiveness, than straight stress. IMO #bizapaloozachat
A3: None of us performs better under stress except for stress/danger to be escaped by running, jumping, lifting, etc.  #bizapaloozachat
RT @DIYMarketers: 'we've elevated modern "stressors" to match being chased by a mastodon #BizapaloozaChat
RT @DreaVilleneuve: A2: Never just live with stress - the long term effects are really damaging. #bizapaloozachat https://t.co/H203eqw5HY
A2 stress is our bodies getting juiced up to run like hell from physical danger. Temporary. Not for living with. #bizapaloozachat
A2: Live with stress? No. Understanding stress helps. There's a great book 'Why Zebras don't get Ulcers.' Explains a lot. #bizapaloozachat
A1: I find that labeling helps, especially with a long exhale. Oh, yeah, this is stress.  #bizapaloozachat

A6: distraction is just one of the causes of procrastination. It's a subset.  #bizapaloozachat
@DIYMarketers Yeah but I've learned the hard way that the in sync feeling can be wrong, which becomes clear only later. Just me, I hope. #BizapaloozaChat

Pardoning Arpaio is our president saying yes I am racist and I'm proud of it and I don't give a damn about the courts or the constitution.
RT @IronStache: .@realDonaldTrump pardons racists like Joe Arpaio because he admires their racism.		This is white supremacy.

.@DIYMarketers really well done thanks you and @johnhall ... and @SusanSolovic is excellent, great choice for next week.  #bizapaloozachat
.@TheCharlesIBe love your A10. Well said.  #bizapaloozachat
Thank you @DIYMarketers and @JohnHall and fellow chatters. Excellent chat once again.  #bizapaloozachat
.@JohnHall I love "I don't know anything for sure." Right on! Uncertainty is a sign of intelligence. Even maybe wisdom. #bizapaloozachat
A9: our world is full of people who are in the expert business. Good content validates expertise.  #bizapaloozachat
Thank you @DIYMarketers you are on my list with @SmallBizTrends @Ducttape and others. &amp; my grownup kids too #bizapaloozachat
A7: How NOT to do it. Somebody I know said "people can smell fake from a mile away."  #bizapaloozachat
A7: There's a paradox with influence. If it shows that you're trying, then you aren't succeeding.  #bizapaloozachat
A6: and also content marketing gets harder all the time. Takes patience. Consistency over a long time.  #bizapaloozachat
Fascinating: @amynowacoski sez "I think most influencers are a caricature of themselves, and that's fine." #bizapaloozachat
A6: But good content is no longer needle in a haystack. It's mountains of needles and hay mixed together. No sorting. #bizapaloozachat
.@DIYMarketers @JohnHall confession. Can't answer all unsolicited emails. Not that good. Or generous. Not enough time.  #bizapaloozachat
.@amynowacoski cool! I like your influencer taxonomy. Righteous, rebellion, etc.  #bizapaloozachat
A4: wide range from artifice (sleaze) on purpose, on one end; to honest advice, opinion, experience, on the other.  #bizapaloozachat
.@SmallBizOpinion interesting thought. I do respect influence as advice. Great quotes. Real experience. Real value #bizapaloozachat
A3: we're obsessed with "influence" because traditional advertising-based marketing (i.e. shouting) is waning. #bizapaloozachat
A2: Influencer pet peeve: self-styled startup experts who have memorized all the clich√©s but not ever done it.  #bizapaloozachat
Hi @JohnHall &lt;waves&gt;  #bizapaloozachat
RT @Bizapalooza: A2- Roll my eyes. Influence is something that reminds me of gurus and ninjas of digital space. #BizapaloozaChat
A2: My reaction to "influence" is skeptical these days. I smacks of selling reputation and trust. Makes me nervous.   #bizapaloozachat
@TheCharlesIBe hi Charles good to see you in chat again. :)  #bizapaloozachat
A1: Some of the best influence is putting labels on phenomena that people recognize better with that label.  #bizapaloozachat
@DIYMarketers thanks for asking. Fabulous. Three days totally off the grid, on the water/campsite, with family. Amazing. #bizapaloozachat
A2: the phrase "brand" is diluted from overuse. We need new vocabulary. It's about being true to a business persona.  #bizapaloozachat

@DIYMarketers not as analytical as it might seem. The analysis becomes a punching bag or a target.  #bizapaloozachat
A9: I need to do the analysis, dive into the numbers, see the data but not believe it. Poke holes. And then digest.  #bizapaloozachat
@IvaIgnjatovic good point, but what I do, I control. But I also take risks on what my customers will do &amp; I don't control #bizapaloozachat
A8: I'm pretty comfortable with the risk of making mistakes. I've had so much practice. #bizapaloozachat
RT @Bizapalooza: A8- if my decision impacts other people more than me, then taking risk is difficult. #BizapaloozaChat

.@TheCharlesIBe right on! Certainty reverse correlates with knowledge, experience, intelligence.  #bizapaloozachat
A7: The secret to fear is to harness it up into useful alert attention. Turn fear into management, not inaction.  #bizapaloozachat
A6: re @SmallbizOpinions we admire "extreme sports" etc. only the winners. We camouflage risk in inattention.   #bizapaloozachat
A5: Is this you? ‚Äì¬†I feel risk averse but when I look back on some decisions, years later, I'm socked at how risky.  #bizapaloozachat

A8: Recognize that what matters is what you do not what you say. Actions. Who you are, not who you say you are. #bizapaloozachat
A7 Never assume we know anything about anybody without knowing them. Understand what pre-judging really means.  #bizapaloozachat
Evolution of business has increased the effectiveness of the story over big-budget formulaic branding #bizapaloozachat
Stories often tell truths that factual information doesn't. Look at how all great religions depend on stories.  #bizapaloozachat
.@Dove so sorry, you, not Ponds, great ground breaking campaign against female stereotypes.  #bizapaloozachat
Opps ... I meant Dove, not Ponds. Inadvertent but significant problem there, re branding.  #bizapaloozachat
A5 I love ground breakers like the Ponds campaign against stereotyping and disturbing female stereotypes. Well done.  #bizapaloozachat
.@BusSavvySavant well said: "Cast as large of a net as possible. Why limit your business."  #bizapaloozachat
"Diversity" is often a legitimate response to coded opposition to diversity in today's over-politicized divided discourse #bizapaloozachat
