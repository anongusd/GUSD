@crau87 Kinda feel like that was the point – regardless of outside events, there should be some correlation…but it’s not there
@crau87 But – shocker – did coincide w/ massive redistribution of wealth to the richest among us
@crau87 Analysis undermines what cuts predicated on: redux of r8s over 65 yrs had little association w/ savings, investment or productivity
@crau87 But if cutting taxes on rich benefits econ, we shld see correlation btn those cuts &amp; econ growth - finds that claim tenuous at best
@crau87 Doesn’t really compare to 2 eras…analysis over 65 yrs from 1945-2010.
