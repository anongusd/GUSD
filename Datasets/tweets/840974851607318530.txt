@OversightDems @RepCummings Don't Felix Sater's records become unsealed this year?
@GOP Perhaps background checks are a good thing!   You should have done one on your former RNC Finance Chair. @tedlieu
@JohnAvlon Now they're being even more disingenuous by submitting articles about Cohen for the record written by publications they've attacked as "fake news" for years.
@SassyKadiK How many times will Trump now reference himself as a Vietnam vet?
@Alyssa_Milano The GOP's plan is to try to discredit Cohen by calling him a liar, cheater, and thief.  He was the President's right hand man for the past 10 years.  One GOP Congressman even tried to argue how unethical it was for him to record the president ordering him to engage in bad stuff.
