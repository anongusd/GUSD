It‚Äôs important to know where your money is going, especially when it comes to funding schools. Rep. Comer offered an amendment to have an audit on compliance costs. Democrats say they oppose it.
Democrats don't trust the people closest to kids in schools to protect them from outside threats. They've called yet another procedural vote to make that misguided point clear. #schoolsafety
Democrats just blocked @CongressmanGT's amendment to make sure IDEA gets fully funded first. IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services. This impacts over 6.5 million students.

#Smallbiz owner: Instead of forcing their regulations on states, #OSHA should work w/ stakeholders to establish the most effective rules.
Occupational Safety Expert: #OSHA makes sensitive data public w/o any context, which could cause serious harm to employers.
#Smallbiz owner expresses concern that some #OSHA regs could actually be counterproductive toward making workplaces safer.
Occupational Safety Expert: #OSHA‚Äôs focus on recordkeeping is misguided, not likely to lead to improvements in workplace safety.
#Smallbiz owner: These #OSHA regulations will do little, if anything, to promote safer workplaces in the roofing industry.
Occupational Safety Expert: #OSHA‚Äôs approach in recordkeeping rule shifts costs of protecting workers' privacy from the agency to employers.
.@RepWalberg: #OSHA‚Äôs new recordkeeping rule will  jeopardize  the privacy of workers' personal information.
