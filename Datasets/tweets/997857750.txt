I continue on in that struggle for just equality, anti-sexism, anti-patriarchy, and dismantling of the toxicity of misogyny. Onwards, dear ones.
We have a long way to go. In our churches, in society, in our work together. But this is something that was on my mind today as I prep for a lectures on women in the Reformation. Grateful for clergy and leaders (all women) in my youth who preached that Word and sacrament.
A lot of the leaders struggling for women‚Äôs ordination, the dismantling of toxic patriarchy in churches, also empowered work for LGBTQ rights, ordination, justice, and inform our church‚Äôs work like this draft @ELCA social statement on ‚ÄúWomen and Justice‚Äù https://t.co/ef3oKHMtBh
Amazing women who were clergy‚Äîmy pastors‚Äîhelped to form my faith, discern my callings, protected me as a young LGBTQ kid and helped me come out at my most fearful moments.
One of the gifts I celebrate every day: the first women were ordained in the Lutheran church (ELCA)‚Äôs predecessor church bodies in 1970. While recent in the long scheme of things, I was born well after that date. I have never known my own church without women‚Äôs ordination.

The planet depends on new resolutions. We might just call that ‚Äúecological consciousness‚Äù though.
But all in all, it helps to do an inventory of one‚Äôs electrical and utility footprint and ask 1) what changes can we make ourselves for climate, 2) what changes can we join with others to advocate for, and 3) what changes can we create despite of perceived impossibility.
Small changes, privileges I chose to give up have contributed naturally to lower bills, a much smaller ecological footprint where I live, and increased creativity. Not for everyone, and I still travel‚Äîwhich is something I‚Äôm cutting down and coping with (my grandparents are dying)
Folks are going to start talking about resolutions soon, given the new year. Three years ago, as part of a move and conscious choice, I stopped having 1) a car, 2) a tv, and 3, a microwave. Modern conveniences can be necessary, but I found that I‚Äôm walking, reading, cooking more.

Our ethical relations and entangled histories expose how little work we‚Äôve done to rethink our creatureliness and kinship with other animals. Everyone should choose a companion species (Haraway) and begin to do the work.
Moral of the story: Derrida and a few others made the point that we need to focus and multiply the differences of animal-human animal interaction to better see the ethical tangles. I think a class like this shows us how little we pay attention to any animal.
We watched films (Dumbo) and read novels (The Tusk that Did the Damage by Tania James) that artistically thought through the deep questions.
We read about the history of American circuses (Susan Nance‚Äôs work is unparalleled).
We focused on postscolonial reading of African wildlife and the history of safari and the ivory trade.
We asked into questions of extinction of elephants, poaching, human-elephant conflict, and the cloning of mammoths.
We read the histories of human interaction with Asian and African elephants in work, war, art, hunting.
We read biographies of scientists who studied elephant family structure, gender, sexuality, matriarchy, sound, communication. (Cynthia Moss and Katy Payne, among others)

Thus concludes my first end of year list--imperfect, provisional, but a brilliant collection of books in religion and ecology that should be read both in and outside of the bounds of theology proper. More to come, of course. later! Share the list widely... cc: @cenhs
Finally, Elizabeth Johnson's interesting book, *Creation and the Cross: The Mercy of God for a Planet in Peril* takes on traditional Christian understandings of the cross as a salvific event to further her understanding of an eco-themed "deep incarnation."  Written as a dialogue! https://t.co/zfrjrZrJYM
T Wilson Dickinson sensitively takes the Paul (yup, the apostle) and Kierkegaard as guides to imagine what a radical religious ecopolitics of creation looks like--a way for him of navigating the disempowering present of ecological despair and structural ecological injustice. https://t.co/rCIMAzKtXz
This one's a bit of a cheat, but @christyzen ground?breaking work on ecojustice and water is out with a second edition, updated and with new reflections on water scarcity and #NoDAPL at Standing Rock. *Just Water: Theology, Ethics, and Fresh Water Crises* https://t.co/Sqip85lSJt
Mark Wallace's *When God was a Bird: Christianity, Animism, and the Re-enchantment of the World* makes a strong case for a Christian animism and the enfoldings of bioregionalism with an animated creation. https://t.co/1F8YqVxJVK
Virginia Burrus' *Ancient Christian Ecopoetics: Cosmologies, Saints, Things* positions a ecocritical take on ancient Mediterranean Christians through the three fragments of her subtitle, engaging khoric cosmology, queer ecological saints, and new materialisms. https://t.co/kOdP314gsQ
.@ericdaryl's brilliant *Inner Animalities: Theology and the End of the Human* does brilliant work on critical animal studies and contemporary theological anthropology to think about the inner constitutive animality of human critters and how that gets obfuscated, used. And more! https://t.co/1mFdmgWzcv
*Meaningful Flesh: Reflections on Religion and Nature for a Queer Planet* edited by Whitney Bauman is a project I was fortunate to contribute to with @the_eco_thought and others. We work queer ecological readings of religion and theology. Read mine here: https://t.co/4qsAMVNxMo https://t.co/CFLBcW3gVi
Patricia Cox Miller's *In the Eye of the Animal: Zoological Imagination in Ancient Christianity* looks at the critical animal perspective of ancient Christian texts to look at the inextricable ways animals are thought with, made metaphors of, and theologically deployed. https://t.co/q7SpLRk2ND
Catherine Keller's' brilliant *A Political Theology of the Earth* sets forth an political ecotheology taking earth seriously and the struggles of our planetary commons in the wake of climate catastrophe. (Disclaimer: CK was my PhD advisor and mentor, so I'm totally biased here). https://t.co/MtkHWYKEO0
First up, *The Bloomsbury Handbook of Religion and Nature: The Elements* edited by Laura Hobgood and Whitney A. Bauman. A great introductory texts looking at the field of religion and ecology from perspectives of the elemental topics and metaphorical elements of creation. https://t.co/EHuXDoROtc
At the end of the year, I go back over my fields of theology, theory, religion, and ecology to see what new books stood out. Good theological texts often don't get the press they deserve. So, here's my first short list, 10 Theology and Ecology books to read from 2018:

God is weak, seductive and persuasive rather than coercive, always in a process of becoming and creative transformation in relation and response to the creativity of the universe. It is as true to say, Whitehead once said, that the God creates the world as the world creates God.
Radical theology, process theology, feminist and queer iterations of theology that transform notions of divinity and reject omnipotence have been my home for decades now. These movements did the hard work of breaking up omni, patriarchal, hierarchical notions of god and church.
I‚Äôm deeply grateful for forms of radical theology, and especially radical process traditions. I don‚Äôt go for the death of God but for the death of a certain picture of God. Theological concepts like omnipotence or an ‚Äúall powerful‚Äù divinity never made sense to me, were violent.

Theology and religious studies friends: We're soon entering December which means "end of year" lists, top tens, and gift ideas. Which books of #theology and #religiousstudies impacted your work the most this year?  I'll share my list later this week... @AARWeb @ChristianCent

Glad to have @seandhenry visiting my Ethics of Embodiment class tomorrow to talk about education, embodiment, and theology. Seems like a brilliant way to round out a lovely term!
I would really love it if the @ELCA Churchwide began to create a new Social Statement on Life in the Wake of #GlobalWarming. It's been decades since "Care for Creation" came out, and it's time for a stronger Lutheran voice on #climatechange  @ELCABishopEaton @ELCAadvocacy

@FedExHelp Thanks, done!
A little irked at @FedEx today. Was expecting a package today, but received an email that "Customer not Available or Business Closed." The odd thing is that the doors to the office are wide open, someone's been in reception, and I've been nearby all day. Frustrating.

@Pennamiriel Ah cool. Yea FT does excercise some good independence, stand on its own. That‚Äôs a very fun few weeks, though. As someone who can‚Äôt stand Barth, I do like the RBrief for some reason. I think it feels differently poetic of his.
@Pennamiriel I sometimes worry that placing Barth with Kierkegaard has this unseemly temptation of colonizing SK‚Äôs multiplicity with Barth‚Äôs kritical outline. Which texts did you put together? How‚Äôd the dialogue move?

We don‚Äôt lift up or study the stories of LGBTQ religious folks, advocates, justice-seekers nearly enough in news, scholarship, and queer media. Solidarity means celebrating justice across lines of religious and nonreligious and humanist difference.
The discomfort felt by some on LGBTQ inclusion in mainlines pales in comparison to the LGBTQ lives violated, lost and ignored by misogynistic and homophobic incarnations of Christianity. I‚Äôm grateful, then, for LGBTQ Christian leaders taking charge to transform churches.
I‚Äôm a big fan of Presiding Bishop Curry, but every time a leader uses a phrase stating there is ‚Äúhurt on all sides‚Äù when it comes to LGBTQ inclusion in churches, I‚Äôm let down: there‚Äôs a difference between someone‚Äôs ego of privilege getting hurt and structural historical violence. https://t.co/CZtYMOFJdK

@cindy_w_brandt Universal cosmic hope seems about as progressive as you can get, perhaps. But to answer your question, no, the church isn‚Äôt unique in this. It just has old habits and recurring wisdom that often remind us and unsettle our memories into the future.
@cindy_w_brandt Time and time again, church becomes an event where strangers learn to sing together, where offering a stranger a sign of peace and desire for justice is relearned over and over, where people are told they‚Äôre loved not because of their work, not because of what they deserve.
