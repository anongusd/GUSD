@PITTERHOTSPITTA @ChakaSwan @FlyinnDoLo_ I haven't followed Soulja Boy's career for obvious reasons, but what you're saying on a whole is seriously on point. It's cool to love whatever song was popular when you were in high school/middle school but not at the expense of real artists who are always innovating.
@EthanJTenorio @ChakaSwan You need to re-examine your entire perspective on music if you think an entire generation of music was inspired by Soulja Boy.
@Doodledoodlezes Decades ago. They're a shitty team. That's my point. The fact that I'm not an NBA player doesn't give them an excuse to be trash. They're trash.
@Doodledoodlezes Did what?
@Doodledoodlezes When's the last time Souljah Boy did something really impressive?
@Doodledoodlezes I was being sarcastic.
@Doodledoodlezes Oh yeah that's a good point! Sort of like how I was watching the Knicks the other night and I was really pissed that they were losing, but then I realized I don't play basketball, so now it's okay that they're terrible! That solved everything!
@ChakaSwan Souljah Boy's bitch ass didn't invent or popularize any of those things. Music for teenagers is the basis of the pop music industry. But other rap artists and other genres did that creatively and he doesn't have a single actually impressive song that won't be soon forgotten.

@PeteByron1 @STARZ So the idea of pressuring white people not to be hateful toward black people was not, in fact, a substantial part of black politics in the 60s/70s? I understand it somewhat differently lol
@PeteByron1 @STARZ In the 1960s, black people did not profess an exasperation with anti-racist attitudes. They marched, and sometimes died to fight racism. The idea that black people in the 60s/70s were  unconcerned with white racism is the most laughable revisionism I think I've ever come across.
@PeteByron1 @STARZ Welfare came along 30 years before you were born so that was made up
@PeteByron1 @STARZ Only white people say this.

@iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I'm not Israeli, although I've been there. I'm not religiously Jewish, although I grew up as such and rejected it. Semitic, to be fair, is a word that I don't feel is really helpful to the term "anti-semitic", and if it was up to me, anti-Jew would be the popular term. That fair?
@JohnShipmate @iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich No. I don’t.
@iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich So you’re saying I am not a Jew because it’s not my religion. Is that what you’re saying?
@iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I didn’t say anything about Israelis at all. Criticizing Israel isn’t inherently anti-Semitic
@JohnShipmate @iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich You’re a non-jew being hateful toward Jews. If a British guy hates Russian people or vice versa, I think that would be racist.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I’m not mocking jews when I do that. Jews understand the joke.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I am white and a Jew.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Racist against who? Lol
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich No I’m making fun of Internet Nazis
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Ironically. I am a Jew. It’s a joke.
@JohnShipmate @iSquidposter @CrossBalkan @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Not in itself.
@ConcernedPug_ @iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich This started from a post putting jews in triple parentheses. There’s only one reason to do that in-ironically, and it’s to shame jews.
@JohnShipmate @iSquidposter @CrossBalkan @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I feel that that statement is fine, in itself. I know how it’s used, to put down other people. And that’s disturbing.
@JohnShipmate @iSquidposter @CrossBalkan @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich So I’m not white?
@ConcernedPug_ @iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Ethnically he’s black and white. But maybe he would reasonably tell you differently. His skin color is not white. These complexities are a fact of human life.
@ConcernedPug_ @iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich There’s nothing strange about my statement
@ConcernedPug_ @iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich My ethnicity is both white and Jewish. They are both my ethnicity.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I am ethnically white. I am ethnically Jewish.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich It's a religion and an ethnicity. It's both. I'm Jewish, I don't believe in god or Judaism. It is my ethnicity.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Can you be Catholic and white?
@ConcernedPug_ @iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Are you actually outraged that somebody is saying that they're white and jewish at the same time? Or are you pretending to be confused
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I'm caucasian and male. But somehow I've never been called a racist or been yelled at for being white and male. I wonder why.
@iSquidposter @ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I'm not stereotyping you're race or ethnicity. It's your actual views and who you're associating with. No matter what I do, there are people that will hate me and put (((parentheses))) around my name because of my background. That's called hate.
@iSquidposter @CrossBalkan @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich It's a race, ethnicity, and religion. It's not my religion. It's my race/ethnicity.
@iSquidposter @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Pointing out somebody's race/ethnicity for no apparent reason implies a problem with the presence of that race/ethnicity. I think that's pretty clear.

@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Oh okay. That response explains everything!
@JohnShipmate @CrossBalkan @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich So what was the reason to point out their ethnicity in the original comment?
@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich So you are into creating stereotypes about someone
@CrossBalkan @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Pointing out somebody's ethnicity for no apparent reason clearly implies a problem with that ethnicity.
@JohnShipmate @ConcernedPug_ @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich Then don't associate with people like @WhoaTriggers
@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich I'm using it in reference to myself, as a joke. You guys are using it for real, because you want people to know who's a jew and who's not, for....hmmm what's the word....RACIST reasons.
@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich @mcpb knows what I'm talking about
@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich And please stop the horse shit lie that you just told that you were under the impression that it wasn't racist. You're fully aware that it is.
@ConcernedPug_ @JohnShipmate @FredChrist10 @WhoaTriggers @iSquidposter @DevonGraham31 @ShellySchafer @CChristineFair @Cernovich It's not a joke. It's turned into a joke when Jews like me use them. A joke on you guys.

@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Well that's unfortunate. Not as unfortunate as lynchings and gas chambers, though.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro If they're Nazis they deserve it. We've gone over this. Bye now!
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro They can get violent. But it's not horrifying violence, it's beating up Nazis, or rioting in response to Nazi-apologist speakers. Sorry, it's not equivalent. NCAA hooliganism is worse.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro ...sounds like more bat-shit Antifa conspiracy theories.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Sounds like more bat-shit Antifa conspiracy theories.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Antifa are rowdy college kids that are down to riot and punch a Nazi. They are not equivalent to the Nazis or Klansmen. Sorry buddy.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Fair enough. 		(...they're Nazis, not right-wing protesters.)
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro They have two articles with two takes on what they were chanting. Both are racist.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro From the article: "The protesters in Charlottesville chanted "Jews will not replace us"."		https://t.co/GdLh7qhXb3
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro You led this conversation into a racist conspiracy theory while arguing that it is what these guys were chanting. This conversation has been a little bit of "should we punch nazis" and a lot of "those guys are ok people"
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Meaning this is a racist conspiracy theory. Considering all of the guys who went down to Charlottesville are children of immigrants.
I voted for Nixon. That's weird to write.

@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro I'm fine with violence against fascists. Fascism is simply a physical menace. It's not political, in my opinion.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Who's the "you" in "you will not replace us". They were pretty clearly saying "Jews" in my opinion, but let's say they weren't. Who's "you"?
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro https://t.co/LHlfmNR6GJ
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro How hard is it to be horrified by a Nazi march.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro So if one guy marches alongside a second guy with a swastika, he isn't himself equivalent?
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro "In Charlottesville there was nothing about Jews. Only a statue being torn down for political correctness." Denying the existence of a Nazi march, which is what it was.		" Also, the term Nazi means nothing else then "Someone a leftist disagrees with". " Denying their existence.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro The idea that we should leave Nazis alone instead of harming them, is ideologically valid. To say these guys aren't Nazis? That's incredibly disturbing.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro No, because you're bending over backwards to pretend those guys in Charlottesville weren't Nazis. When you and I both know they were. But you defend them anyway. Clearly signifying a hateful or otherwise untrustworthy thought process.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro You are a neo Nazi apologist, I’m done with this.

@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Another vague accusation. I don’t have time to argue decades old regional politics
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Because he was blaming immigrants for all of the problems of society. Should he have been murdered? No.

@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Dude, they were wearing swastikas, screaming "blood and soil". Meanwhile "You will not replace us" is a very racist phrase.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro This happens to politicians on all sides.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Harping on the stupid college kid that called you a Nazi just as a nasty term for an argument they disagreed with is not helping you win arguments against the idea that you are.........DEFENDING NAZIS.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Are you sure it's not because you're bending over backward to defend Nazis? If they're wearing swastikas, then why is it so hard to understand that they were screaming about Jews? You can judge a man by his enemies and by his friends.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro You're nitpicking socialist ideas to confirm your bias, and you're succeeding in pointing out problems. You're not succeeding in explaining how the free-market system would guard against it's own similar problems.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro That's easily solvable by changing the law to give smaller companies a leg-up (with their own program a big company isn't applicable for? Just brainstorming). Going to the anarcho-capitalist system would just have these companies buying up all the raw materials.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Screaming "Jews will not replace us" and wearing swastikas? That's pretty clear-cut, don't you think?
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro I'm confused...are you a Nazi? The idea was that Nazis deserve violence inflicted against them.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro And they pay for this lobbying with the massive capital they have from being...too goddamn powerful for too long.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro No, they're usually lobbying to REMOVE regulations.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Violence against far-right authoritarians does not legitimize violence against free-market advocates. You're giving me all sorts of ignorant pseudo-academic ideas, but I'm not advocating violence against you at all. What you deserve is a good old-fashioned VERBAL ass-whooping.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro That's a libertarian fantasy. Go try to compete with one of these big companies from the ground up, you will be stifled very quickly.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Monopolies are quickly crated from no antitrust regulation, then companies can do whatever they want because the workers can only slave away for a limited choice of employers. So no regulation makes it easy for a business to force somebody to work for them. You're in a fantasy.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Nothing corrupt about good old-fashioned free-market systems! They ALWAYS play by the rules!
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Yes, it is both capitalist and socialist. Both ideas contribute to what you have. That's why the right-wing cherry-picking Venezuela/Cuba/China arguments don't go very far.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro You're nitpicking for the purpose of destroying a socialist program as if the benefits of a free-market system would solve every problem. Just regulate the Polish migrant workers more lol
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro So just eliminate the Polish migrant-work aspect of the program...
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro These aren't problems with socialism, they're problems with corruption.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro "social plans", "criminals getting away with money" hmm sounds like vague and meaningless accusations
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Why would I only ask a Venezuelan? There are 180+ countries and everywhere you’d want to live has implemented a healthy amount of socialist ideas. Ask any Dutchman.
@Bismarc44222810 @Raider_Glace @TheButcherOf303 @FredTomas5 @bennyjohnson @benshapiro Communism is not the ultimate leftist ideal, it's just the most extreme. It's idiotic to think everybody who is a "leftist" is attempting to form an authoritarian communist state. You guys made up that accusation so you can have a safe space against any socialistic progress.

@TimothyS Are you being sarcastic?
@dionyvillalta @ArianaGrande @MacMiller Your tweet doesn’t address the tragedy at hand. It disrespectfully implies a greater importance to a separate aspect of the story with another person as the main character, and it’s very inappropriate.

@NotEdBoon @mtracey See? Buzzwords. Not a coherent description of a tangible scenario.

@AbleN15 @joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow The "knee-jerk" refers to apologetics of every single action of the Russian government. I can't think of one issue raised regarding Russia that people on this part of Twitter can safely say "okay, that wasn't a good move by Putin".
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow The questions keep going because this seems not to be something measurable. So knee-jerk Kremlin defending doesn't solve any problems. Even the ones we probably started.
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow A press release here and there is a vague, but valid answer. I obviously ask because this has turned into severe contrarianism.
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow When/where is a fair time to criticize an act? My original question was regarding how the US government can fairly do so. But media too. What would constitute an appropriate criticism?
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow Fair enough, but you're still not answering the question.
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow ...so then what is an appropriate time or place for a US government or media entity to sharply criticize a Russian policy? Never?
@joeydefiant @ggreenwald @democracynow So the answer to my question is that there is no point where that is appropriate?
@ggreenwald @democracynow Honest question: To get past accusations of what-about-ism, what amount of self-reflection and/or reform would allow for fair US criticism of Russia? At what point is it fair for us to strongly criticize Putin? Isn't there always policy we can point to as hypocrisy on our part?

@ClayAlabaster @TheGreatFlood14 That does not excuse another's actions. This has been the excuse for sexual assault literally since the dawn of mankind. Grow up

@CartaphilusMFR @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 I understand this argument. I’m now asking you what methods are being floated to “enforce” monogamy. It should be very clear at this point that I’m looking for the *method*. Not the goal, the *method*.
@burrovago @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 Fair enough. So what does he mean? What methods should society use to enforce monogamy? And please use specific examples.
@burrovago @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 Did what suffice? Nobody has explained what he might actually mean using tangible examples.
@CartaphilusMFR @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 If that’s not the case then what’s a clear of example of something he’s talking about. What’s a social convention that enforces monogamy? He uses that phrase in his tweet, clear as day. So what’s an example of that?
@burrovago @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 If you think that’s so ridiculous then explain what he actually means without vague terms
@boostahfazoo @omniai @EricKleefeld That’s how not to interpret it. But how should we in fact interpret it?
@CartaphilusMFR @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 Exactly. So nobody knows what the fuck this guys talking about.
@CartaphilusMFR @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 What are the social conventions? How would that work?
@CartaphilusMFR @omniai @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 ....but how? What exactly is he advocating?
@DANGEROUS_media I don't know what this tweet means. But listen, how is this "enforcement" to be done? We're not talking about whether it should be. I don't think it should, but devil's advocate, HOW can it be enforced, instilled, encouraged? What's the plan here?
@victorymonk @omniai @EricKleefeld This says that it should be socially promoted, culturally-inculcated. But how? What's a method for doing so?
@DANGEROUS_media But you're not answering how monogamy can be "enforced"? I don't agree that it necessarily should, but devil's advocate, how can it be enforced?
@DANGEROUS_media @omniai @CathyYoung63 @snarf_PhD @EricKleefeld Again, he didn't mean rape. But then what are these social conventions?
@boostahfazoo @omniai @EricKleefeld What would constitute "speaking honestly"?
@boostahfazoo @omniai @EricKleefeld Can you think of any one way to do that? Even just "encouraged" monogamy if we're going to assume he used an unfortunate word. I can't think of any acceptable ways to do that. (and this is devil's advocate, I don't support that cause)
@boostahfazoo @omniai @EricKleefeld Well you can practice polyamory, or choose not to be married, but regardless what is your point? Or his point? How would monogamy be "enforced"?
@omniai @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 “Deserves” isn’t the best word to use. But this is understandable, he may very well be a lunatic if “enforced” is his chosen adjective
@1Fashionisima @MarkDice He’s saying Michael and it’s an event about a guy named Michael.
@omniai @EricKleefeld @CathyYoung63 He had to have known that a journalist could write those words without elaborating on it, if he wants to throw crazy-sounding language out there without a full explanation, then he gets the backlash that he deserves, not our pity
@omniai @EricKleefeld How can we oppose it if we don’t know what he meant? I’m also disinclined to interpret it as rape but an explanation is needed before any interpretation

@wolfpack1ep @MarkDice Lol “or some shit” that’s very impressive

@LitaTweets @SallyAlbright What I want you to say: how Bernie's outsider status has anything to do with "white supremacy"

@LitaTweets @ImProGrammar @SallyAlbright I’m a Hillary voter, I also concur that we must be pragmatic. I don’t think Bernie would have won. So what makes Bernie Sanders’ candidacy “white supremacy”
@LitaTweets @ImProGrammar @SallyAlbright Yes, but can you or @SallyAlbright articulate why he should be labeled a “white supremacist”?
@LitaTweets @ImProGrammar @SallyAlbright But what does this have to do with “white supremacy”?
Trump will not scrap the Iran deal tomorrow, which he'll justify based on the faith of other actors (Macron) that he'll blame down the line when he wants to look tough again.
@SallyAlbright Can somebody actually extrapolate what she's referring to here? Was this a typo? For real, what made her apply him with that label?

@seec_rider @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC Holy shit, I never even considered that. That's the most insane connection of all. Alex Jones believes in Pizzagate, and has an audience with Trump. Please, for the love of humanity what is the left equivalent of that? Farrakhan is the closest, and he has minimal influence.

@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC lol
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC Has Trump ever denounced an endorsement from a far-right group?
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC Fair point, but Obama quote in the article: “anti-Semitic and anti-Asian statements are not going to lift us up”. And here's Obama telling him to fuck himself: https://t.co/UbPffmj4wg
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC No, his ideas are not influential. There's no wave of Farrakhan-centric voters. The BLM movement isn't fueled by Farrakhan nonsense. Maybe an extremist here and there, but they are kept in line. Alex Jones and Infowars have an audience with the POTUS.
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC The loony aspects of Farrakhan's political perspective are not influential on the left. It's fair to bring him up. But if that's the best example then it proves my point. Infowars is far more influential to the right than Farrakhan's nonsense is on the left.
RT @sextsbot: Let me cover your oily laptop
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC Fair example to bring up, but Farrakhan has a crazy side and a reasonable side. One is occasionally celebrated, and the other is laughed at. Farrakhan does not have the influence Alex Jones has.
@davidharsanyi @BillySullivan7 @redsteeze @JoeNBC lol ok
@davidharsanyi @Jimjone38053148 @redsteeze @JoeNBC But then what's your answer? What's an Alex Jones, Infowars-level piece of lunacy that Bernie Sanders has espoused?
@davidharsanyi @Jimjone38053148 @redsteeze @JoeNBC Was referring to @redsteeze, my apologies if that isn't your perspective.
@davidharsanyi @BillySullivan7 @redsteeze @JoeNBC That was suspiciously vague. Give me the names you're referring to.
@Jimjone38053148 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC This guy thinks the idea of being a socialist (not even a communist, just a "democratic socialist") is equivalent to the accusation of crisis actors and false flag attacks.
@BillySullivan7 @davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC Because the left checks itself like adults are supposed to. When I meet a leftist that still spits 9/11 truther nonsense, I make it clear that they're an embarrassment. But the right can't keep their psychos in line. Alex Jones goes to the WH and mostly crickets from the right.
@imarknova @redsteeze @davidharsanyi @JoeNBC Bernie Sanders might even have more influence on his movement than Alex Jones does on his. And that is not an issue, Bernie Sanders is not dangerous. If you think he is, that's cold war propaganda. Alex Jones believes Sandy Hook is a false flag attack, and he knows the president.
@redsteeze @davidharsanyi @JoeNBC You think it's just as insane to say that you're a democratic socialist as it is to accuse the Sandy Hook massacre of being staged? Yes or no.

@davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC No, they're both meaningful parts of their movements. So tell me how Bernie Sanders' ideas are as dangerous as Alex Jones
@redsteeze @davidharsanyi @JoeNBC To vote for socialists.
@davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC What's a Bernie position that would be equivalent to the accusation of crisis actors? What's the absolute, craziest, kookiest idea that Bernie Sanders supports?
@davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC There isn't a whole movement behind the violence that James Hodgkinson committed. Sure, he's not the only nominally leftist psycho, but it's not a meaningful part of the left. There's no household-name on the left equivalent to Alex Jones, who has WH access.
@davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC If you've written about the danger of conspiracy lunatics taking over mainstream politics, good on you I guess. But then that would seem to agree with the sentiment behind the original tweet.
@redsteeze @davidharsanyi @JoeNBC I assume that was some sort of ad hominem attack, but cool word salad bro
@davidharsanyi @redsteeze @JoeNBC That's a stretch.

This tweet is amazing you all suck
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju How long was the whitewater investigation? Just curious
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju This is your conspiracy theory. The dossier that much of it is based on has not been verified *OR* disproved, but you've chosen to decide that it has been disproved because it backs up the idea that the entire investigation is a conspiracy against Trump.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju "...Nunes said he reviewed “intelligence reports” that showed “incidental collection” on some unnamed Trump transition team members after the election in November, December and January. Nunes said he believed the incidental collection of information was legally obtained."
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju No evidence of misconduct here. https://t.co/UVnqbx7NGH
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju And he may in fact scold the FBI over being biased towards Hillary in 2016. If McCabe was fired for a good reason, it still doesn't help your fantasy that the FBI is a conspiracy against Donald Trump. The guy is a fucking crook and you're not going to run away from that.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Exactly. The fact that that happened undercuts the idea of all of this anti-Trump deep state nonsense
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Well I can't really comment on who was right or wrong between Horowitz and Obama's DOJ, but the very fact that his report is coming out at all is proof that the FBI is not just a tool of the democratic party.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju I read the texts. There is a regular run-of-the-mill fuck-Trump bias, and so they were demoted. No "evidence" besides the secret society comment that was clearly a joke that the FBI is trying their hardest to destroy Trump for the fuck of it. This is a CONSPIRACY THEORY.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju IG report will be from a man who investigated Obama's most famous legitimate fuck-up, the Fast &amp; Furious scandal, and it was hard on the democrat president. Again, there seems to have been some sort of bias, because all reasonable humans are biased against Trump. We shall see.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju LOL that's not the issue. He's a Trump-connected lawyer that's now in charge of the organization that is investigating Trump. Can I have a full explanation as to how that isn't an example of EXTREME corruption?
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju You'd be flipping if this was about Hillary: "Some civil liberties organizations expressed deep reservations about Mr. Wray, a litigation partner at King &amp; Spalding, a law firm that advises Mr. Trump’s family real estate empire." And you have the nerve to claim corruption.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Let's say that Trump-empire lawyer https://t.co/Hys5fcuLcn and Russia-tied businessman https://t.co/TVOnvNLiys  Christopher Wray did legitimately fire McCabe. That's one human being who could have easily and understandably been anti-Trump.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju You.Are.Deflecting
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Whoa now THAT is a deflection. You switched from to vague points about what you like about his political decisions. His policy decisions are ending because he will most likely lose congress, get impeached, and go to fucking jail.

@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju More deflection. Have fun pissing your pants waiting for Trump's indictment
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju They didn't leave on their own. They were forced out by your supreme leader. He's scared shitless because he obstructed justice.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju And yes, there seems to have been a bias against authoritarian former game show host and rapist Donald Trump. But there also was a bias against Hillary Clinton. Horowitz's report will address both. And he's not Devin Nunes, he's an FBI agent. So get ready.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju I just explained that they were fired for no good reason. Instead of explaining the legitimacy of their departures, you deflected with the "spin" accusation. "Spin" is buzzword that usually means nothing.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Page &amp; Strokzy, on the other hand, legitimately fucked up, so they were taken off the case, which is par for the course and not uncommon. If there was a conspiracy like your mystical anarchist propagandists have convinced you of, you would never have even heard their names.
@unseen1_unseen @kyleadalton @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju If Comey had any good reason to be fired Trump would have done it to his face instead of the chicken-shit way he did it. McCabe was pressured to retire only for being friends with him. Rybicki quit for, unrelated. Baker was fired because Trump is scared of him.
People would write "Hee-Haw is the number one show in the country right now?" and then post GIFs of sassy reality show women rolling their eyes. #IfThe70sHadTwitter
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju No, some of them got fired for no good reason, some of them got taken off the case and weren't even fired.
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju All of these people left under totally different circumstances, this is a conspiracy theory to explain away Trump shady firing of the FBI director and tarnishing people like McCabe just because his wife is a democrat
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju How do you know they haven't?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Explain all of them. lol Page?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju That says it's not yet verified, not that it's just false. Law enforcement looks into it. That's how it works.

@unseen1_unseen @BillyHeym @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Lol the FBI ruined her political career, that's the plot hole in your conspiracy
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Conspiracies to distract from the fact that not everyone is a mystical anarchist in this country
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Exactly. A political wing of a political party wouldn't do that to somebody supposedly working for that party. He was a man with a bias, like all of us.
@BillyHeym @unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju "Insurance policy" is a far cry from political wing and we all know this
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju How do you know what's been verified and what hasn't? Are you at the FBI?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Law enforcement agents investigate rumors and hearsay.
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju I'm making fun of him for being a thick headed crackpot
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju And Trump is failing to turn the FBI on the DNC for the record
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju But these are conspiracy theories. Two agents were fired from the case. It was Peter Strozk who was investigating Hillary and now he's being accused of pro-Hillary bias?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju If the DNC had funded research that let's say accidentally tarnished Hillary, and you were FBI, you would look the other way and not look into or use the information?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Let's say Steele had a political motive. Does that change whether the FBI should use the information?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju You're using the word "front" like Alex Jones
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju Lol they're all republicans at the FBI. It's relatively harder to find democrats even working in the building.
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju How? For using DNC-funded research?
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju And it's also an inconvenient but legitimate source of information. If the tables were turned, the right would use and has used any dirt on Hillary they can find, regardless of who paid for it.
@unseen1_unseen @AlanFromMars @dvorakoelling @mkraju "A footnote that the dossier may have been political is not the same as saying the dossier was funded by the DNC/Clinton campaign as political opposition." Yes, it is the same. Because FBI agents don't skim over footnotes. It was included in the FISA application, Nunes is lying.

@ggreenwald @svzwood 3) Nobody should be calling you traitor for pushing back on the Trump/Russia narrative, but it's strange how somebody who has been rightfully dedicated to transparency has so quickly and decisively brushed off the entire idea that our election system was affected at all.
@ggreenwald @svzwood 2) “My best guess is he’s just ignoring these things in favor of the less difficult argument that some people who are backing the Trump-Russia narrative are full of shit.”
@ggreenwald @svzwood 1) Nobody should call you a traitor for stressing due process for Trump &amp; Russia, or for anything else for that matter. Twitter is full of lunatics and they're not all nazis.

@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ So if you met a Haitian person or African person there would be no way to judge them based on their race? Makes no sense with your overall views.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ You can't answer because you're answer will either be racist or it will admit that the genetics are irrelevant. There are many organizations that help people escape the racist culture that has swallowed you up. I don't know how old you are but it's never too late.

@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ No, it's not. Genetics is a biological concept, but it doesn't apply to everything. lol you have dodged my very simple question like 12 times at this point. You are scared of answering.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Let's try this: Is there anything about my genetic make-up that you can assume based on what I've told you?
@mjgon64 @neontradition @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS The "name" comment was about Trump and his people.
@mjgon64 @neontradition @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS Then why did you re-tweet it.....
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Your entire worldview seems to about judging people based on genetics. I've asked you to judge mine, and you won't because you're scared.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Okay so it's not fair to judge people based on their genetics?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ You're using the word "hyperventilate" to distract from your cowardice. You're too scared to answer the question.
@mjgon64 @neontradition @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS And I didn't even see that you have Rothschild conspiracies in your profile. I thought it was a Zionist account. You are a piece of shit. Do not contact me.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Still can't just answer a simple question. What is your opinion of my genetics?
@mjgon64 @neontradition @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS @mjgon64 You're a truther (translation: paranoid lunatic) so please don't retweet me or contact me in any way. Thanks.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Your whole attitude is that genetics should be used to judge somebody. What is your judgement of my genetics? Let's forget being Jewish for a moment if that's so confusing. What is your opinion of my genetics?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ lol I have no idea why you keep accusing me of asking that. What is your opinion of my Hungarian/Polish genetics, and what is your opinion of my cousin's Hungarian/Chilean genetics? You're pretending to be confused because you're too scared to answer.
@neontradition @mjgon64 @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS We occupied Haiti for 30 years in a pissing match with Germany, upheld 2 generations of right-wing dictatorship until it wasn't convenient anymore. Now we're going to call them names?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ LOL you are terrible at dodging questions. What is your opinion of my family's genetics?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ It's worded in very direct terms. What is your opinion of my genetics? What is your opinion of my cousin's genetics? I'm Hungarian/Polish, he's Hungarian/Chilean, we're both Jewish (genetically). What is your opinion of our genetics?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ It sounds like you're far too scared to comment on race when somebody is confronting you directly.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Nice dodge. Please answer my very direct question about my personal ethnicity. Also, we're Jewish, so you can certainly give me your opinion of that as well.
@neontradition @mjgon64 @teressaryan @DineshDSouza @POTUS https://t.co/NwbpT7h3eb Want to address this history?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ If you think it's fine to judge somebody based on race, then I'd like you to use my ethnicity, and that of my family member, as an opportunity to explain your views. I think this is a perfectly reasonable request.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ I am Hungarian on one side, Polish on the other. My cousin is Hungarian on one side, Chilean on the other. What is your opinion of my genetics? My cousin's genetics? Don't bother with the "calm down" defense. You can answer the question if you're not too scared.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ 1) Modern, pluralistic, empathetic societies.		2) You're permitted to be a racist, or whatever you want to call it. What you're not permitted to is a force field against horrified non-racists.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Nice try. Answer the question please?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ So your argument is that human biodiversity means we should treat people differently based on their race?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ From you guys: "Although we might put it differently, Identity Evropa shares @POTUS's sensible view that immigrants coming from countries like Norway are preferable to those coming from countries like Haiti." One group of people is more preferable than another? This isn't racist?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ You have a video narrated by Richard Spencer. Explain how he is not a racist?
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ You have a section on eugenics on your website. How is that not racist?	https://t.co/uAK6PuHHm7
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Oh actually, I already know. Identity Evropa is a white supremacist group. You're an actual racist.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ What does that question have to do with my criticism of @AprilDRyan's softball questions? Hey by the way, quick yes or no: are you a racist? Just yes or no.
@neontradition @AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ Struggling.
@AprilDRyan @shin_inouye @CapehartJ He's either going to ignore you or he's going to say that he is not a racist. The way you're asking, it sounds like you're seeing whether he says yes. You asked Sanders whether slavery was good or bad. All this does is gives them an easy way to verbally deny their bigotry.

@seanhannity @CNN @NBCNews HAHA you god damn idiot this is an NBC story
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc How come you can't respond to anything I wrote? You're scared
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc You keep coming back without a response because you're too scared LOL
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc You didn't respond to what I said about Sessions confirming that the investigation is pointless. LOL coward
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc A lot of information you're too scared to respond to. Who's the snowflake? Lol pussy
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc Meanwhile, @ronjon484, I'll be coming back to this thread with all of the juicy developments as Jeff Sessions continues the investigation he already confirmed was pointless.
@RonJon484 @garrettmlnyc Cool name-calling, bro. Lot of information you didn't respond to.
@garrettmlnyc And according to JEFF FUCKING SESSIONS IN THE HILL, a Trump official you love quoted in a news source you trust: Sessions/Rosenstein in letter to the Senate tried to suggest there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear bribery case. 	https://t.co/ljvjKfzatH
@garrettmlnyc "According to The Hill, the FBI did not inform the Committee on Foreign Investments of its scrutiny of this behavior prior to the Uranium One decision. Right now there’s no evidence it was linked to the Rosatom deal, however."	https://t.co/gVkb4eZLTg
@garrettmlnyc Dems are interested in the informant William Campbell and what Holder's FBI did with the Mikerin evidence, but it was unrelated to CFIUS and the Uranium One deal. That was about Russia's "Megatons to Megawatts" program. 	https://t.co/XYCk8FxFaf
@garrettmlnyc Stewart Baker, top lawyer in the GWB admin, CFIUS expert (says she probably wasn't even aware of the vote): "Is it possible that the Russians thought they needed to do this and that it would help them? Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it actually did."	https://t.co/TFqGsph3gD
@garrettmlnyc So you're just left with the $500,000 that Kremlin-linked Renaissance Capital paid Bill to speak in Moscow, which would be questionable if Hillary controlled Uranium One "sale", and if the Committee on Foreign Investments had the Machiavellian power of which you fantasize.
@garrettmlnyc Meanwhile, the $145 million you're referring to when you vomit out inaccurate statistics? $131.3 million was donated by Frank Giustra, who sold his stake in Uranium One in 2007, so that connection is a fantasy.
@garrettmlnyc Excuse me? Sold? What kind of nonsense article gave you the impression that anybody "sold" the uranium to Russia (Who had not attacked our election process in 2010)? There are 9 seats on the Committee on Foreign Investments, and they only "approve" deals, they can't stop them.

@DZBillFulton @cooptodahoop1 @USMC @JerardF This account isn't simply a Marine either, it's in the public domain making murder jokes. Dark war jokes are a fact of life, but saying things like "We kill at everything we do" on a public account representing the Marines is nauseating.
@umknicken @cooptodahoop1 @USMC @JerardF I was at the border when I was at the Golan Heights, and I saw smoke from the war in Syria. Closest I've been to a war zone. In Israel, I didn't hear anybody make jokes about killing palestinians. I don't think the IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) makes murder jokes on their feed.
@UrQuanKin @USMC @JerardF No, but that situation represents the reason you should at least cut out the cutesy jokes.
@blakeatenn @cooptodahoop1 @USMC @JerardF "Offend" isn't the word. But it's nauseating to see the account that represents the whole organization making a joke about killing people. Every armed force fucks up sometimes. But show some respect, considering that you don't always kill the right people.

@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen You keep saying "if", too scared to say it on the record. Should a woman be charged with a felony for performing an abortion on herself?
@kylegriffin1 See? This is a softball. Weaseled through it like she always does, but she did not fall into any sort of trap, and a question was wasted.
@bob_toomey @JerryBrownRocks @kylegriffin1 Two white guys making slavery jokes.
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen And do you think that situation constitutes that?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen "If"
@thiannon_rhomas @KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @conservmillen Yeah, he's deflecting. What if a woman has a blackmarket abortion. Should she be charged with a felony for doing this to her body?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen This is a blatant deflection. A woman uses whatever means (black market pill, wire hanger), to perform an abortion on herself. Felony?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen But one of those? Those are all felonies. Women should be charged with a felony for taking an abortion pill? That's a yes or no question.
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen You're too chicken to answer this because you know how ridiculous it would be.

@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen If abortions are illegal, then if a woman takes a pill to have an abortion, what should the punishment be?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen No, not in the past. In the future, if it is made illegal. You know what I'm asking, quit deflecting like a coward.
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen Conspiracy to commit murder? Am I missing something?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen It is. Meanwhile, what should the punishment be for a doctor who has performed an abortion?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen And you are not answering the question. What if a woman performs an abortion on herself? What should the punishment be?
@KennethWShelton @onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen It is illegal to ask a person to kill another person.
@onlyJeffDavis @thiannon_rhomas @conservmillen Then tell everybody what you think we should do with a woman who has admitted to having an abortion? What should the punishment be?

@michaelbd @benrhodes Yes, and you probably (or maybe) care about dreamers. But whataboutism got a reality host in the WH so why don't you look to the future.
@michaelbd @benrhodes That's your only point today? Good job National Review!
@michaelbd This whole sentiment is distracting from @benrhodes tweet re: kicking out the brown kids. Care about them? Or just the evil Dem president?
@michaelbd "Well Ben Rhodes and Obama are at fault." Okay! But they're gone so link one of your articles or something.
@michaelbd Valid point. So tweet about your proposed policy.
@michaelbd Because that person is not in office right now. You're not even framing it as a lesson that can be learned from O's mistakes...whataboutism.
@michaelbd Whataboutism is complaining without ideas. You want to call out other presidents? Incorporate it into an actual argument.
@michaelbd Then that work should be a lot more value than aimless whataboutism.
@michaelbd But "calling people out" is not useful. You write for National Review, how bout some policy?

@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana from your own link: "...benefits rose sharply in the 1960s and then fell in the 1970s and 1980s, when out-of-wedlock births rose most."

@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana No problem! "...benefits rose sharply in the 1960s and then fell in the 1970s and 1980s, when out-of-wedlock births rose most."
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana They're not. But you're not addressing the 7% figure that was clearly made up.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana From your own link "...born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present."
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana Your whole point is about the idea that it was only 7% before LBJ came along. Where did you get this idea? Where did you get this number?
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana Single mom and "without a father" are different. And again, this doesn't address your weird 7% statistic that is total nonsense.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana This is out of wedlock, not "without a father". And it doesn't address that 7% figure that seems to be made up completely.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana This was a made up statistic. You must know this is made up.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana Look them up where? I'm asking you where you're getting these stats. You continue to be the one that looks like an idiot with no response.
@arsenalgooooner @bofm1313 @Loki_louisiana I'm asking you about that statistic about LBJ. If you don't answer, this thread makes you look like a stubborn racist. (Because you are one)
@arsenalgooooner @bofm1313 @Loki_louisiana why did you post that meme again? And no, half of them fought to keep it going.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana So you're basically admitting that that statistic is just made up.
@bofm1313 @arsenalgooooner @Loki_louisiana You're a troll. You can't possibly believe the statistic in your meme.
@arsenalgooooner @bofm1313 @Loki_louisiana Well there is audio similar comments: "Down south n------ vote more than white people!". But this guy is just racist trolling.

@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque But I'll admit, The @theintercept, which often posts beautifully written articles, employs Robert Mackey, too bad you guys hate him.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque This is honestly starting to feel like this whole 'gaslighting' thing, if I may use that buzzword. In this case, I'm starting to see it.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque They need to investigate this, but @ggreenwald just mines for the few stories that went overboard and labels this as loony.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque AN OFFENSIVE ASSAULT ON REASON lol to have the big bad evil MSM investigate a cyber attack from a foreign country?
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque LOL this asshole Greenwald covers his bases for like 15 words and then refers to the issue as an offensive assault on reason.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque Is about the RELATIONSHIP between US and Russia. Not seriously discussing a foreign country's relationship to us is bizarre obscurantism.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque See, this is what I'm talking about. This scandal (which would be completely paranoid to dismiss as a large-scale IC/DNC lie, let's face it)
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque As opposed to just not knowing how to run a good election, that they are *purposely* perpetuating the status quo. Hanlon's razor?
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque You said that their ideology is to blame. Expand on this ideology. Because all I'm seeing the idea that the DNC *likes* the status quo.
@Humble_Planet @Joel_E_Harris Here's a reply directly to you re:anna marie morris. Why would you ask how the N-word is racist? Are you actually confused as to how?
@BBCNews That was a long read before they noted what she had said. True that it's not for the headline, but burying it hundreds of words in? Weird.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque Link me to an article they've written that really addresses the injustices of the Putin regime, and I'll be glad to discuss. Walk/chew gum.
@KnightofCali @TheGreatCleiton @ggreenwald @yaffaesque This is a conspiracy theory at this point. The idea that the DNC hates poor people and just loves war so much that they've fabricated this.

@NPR How bout twisted approach to Jews am I right
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle It's not a force for good. It's not a force for evil. It's a group of humans. It's what we make of it.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Eliminate the FBI. Wow.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Priority=Rule of law. FBI about to be led by the guy who represented Rosneft. Does that mean nothing to you? Shouldn't he be investigated?
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Imagine if there was no pressure on this issue like you guys all seem to be arguing for. He'd be unchained, micromanaging the FBI.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle This is my point: you guys are empty contrarians. The DNC and some conservatives are concerned with an issue. So...knee-jerk denials. Babies
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Can someone give me an real answer to what you would do if Flynn/Manafort were dems? Explain the COMPLETE lack of outrage at the moment.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle But the DNC agrees with me. So that means you guys think it's overblown or fake, because you're contrarians.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Cyber warfare . Lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. Money laundering. FBI in danger of being micromanaged Hoover/Nixon style.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Find out exactly what happened so that we can start on serious electoral reform, find any collusion, out any foreign agents like Flynn.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Pressure.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle And the idea that because we can't solve an issue completely we should ignore it? This is how republicans argue against every regulation.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Getting out of the Middle East? Russia is not helping us stabilize that region creating more future wars for us waste money on
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Not gonna help that issue if he's firing the FBI director
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle How about law enforcement violence?
@Mobe_Edick @macklemore Lol
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Conservatives need to be part of the argument. You guys have no problem apologizing for Putin, but a republican in America? Oh no.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill @davidfrum And so you all think the opposite. Babies.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill @davidfrum Why not this then? Because you think there's no Russia scandal! You're in a fantasy because the DNC thinks something
@tcddoyle @JPDreammaker @khuxford Yeah blow the system up man! Susan would be so proud!
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill We can have a real conversation about state cyber security, cyber warfare.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Maybe. Either way we can fix the election system that all of us rightfully complain about.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill @davidfrum Please forgive me. And also tell me what you would say if David Frum came out for a position you agree with. Would you tell him to fuck off?
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill @davidfrum Oh I autocorrected to the wrong your. Dude I'm really sorry.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle What should we do about Trump and Russia? At least Frum is trying to get his base outraged. Comey fucked up, at least he's trying to fix it.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill That's the tangible evidence lol he fired the FBI director. FIRING THE FBI DIRECTOR. If this is really not THE thing...then why'd he do it?
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Vague whataboutism
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Yeah "we got killers here too."
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill In conversations about war? Of course. Watch this: yo @davidfrum you're axis of evil speech is a stain on our country's history.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill How is that not tangible?
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Explain what you just said in the context of Archibald Cox whoops I mean James Comey getting fired. Still just smoke?
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Right now Russia is a thing. But right now Frum is not exactly a fuck. So let him help if he wants.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Lol "FBI director fired, but some of the people that didn't like that have other policies that I didn't like. Let's just ignore it."
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle It's a pickle, man. But he's finger waving, you guys are all sweeping this under the rug completely. This is not a conspiracy theory.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Policy should be verbal pressure without this mob of whataboutism
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Because the DNC and guys Frum are outraged, so in response you are not, with vague whataboutism and no idea to deal with it. Contrarian.
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill All you guys do is complain about media problems and issues of democracy. The country with no free press hacks our election system? Meh
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill How is it unreasonable to be outraged at Russiagate?
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill If Kristol wanted single payer healthcare you'd hold him up and say "see even the neocons coming around". But not Russia, thats inconvenient
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill And you have one reason for that be something to argue about. That you want the Russia story to go away. Because you are contrarians. Babies
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill DNC thinks Russia is an issue right now, so you think the opposite. FIRED FBI DIRECTOR WHILE INVESTIGATING HIM. Frum is outraged. RIGHTFULLY
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill On every issue no. But this isn't about Frum, he's being used as a proxy for this dumb narrative that it's all a smokescreen. "Axis of evil"
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Is the argument simply don't throw stones until you yourself are a utopian society?
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle But ok, I'll help you out: So if we close Guantanamo they're gonna stop murdering journalists?
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Barely. Vague whataboutism
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle You wanna talk about Russia? K. Give me a non-sarcastic policy position on how to deal with this precise problem.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle So he will? What does this have to do with Frum?
@Projekt29 @jeremyscahill Your position on Russia is about that speech? He's making the same points as everybody. But Frum thinks something so you think the opposite.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Every time anything  about this regime is mentioned...whatabout this, whatabout that. There's killers in America too...Russia off the hook.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle Don't like sanctions? K. How about verbally putting pressure on him to stop murdering journalists, so that this comes to light.
@JPDreammaker @khuxford @tcddoyle This is my point. Because you're so scared of looking like a cold warrior you now cannot criticize another country.
@khuxford @tcddoyle @jeremyscahill Hugging? Welcoming? When? How? A few retweets? This isn't Frum, you just don't want to talk about Russia it fucks with your narrative
@khuxford @tcddoyle @jeremyscahill So why does this deserve time. W called Trump racist, his standing in history is helped every time he criticizes Trump. So should we not?
@khuxford @jeremyscahill Chris Hayes laughs at him and he had no response. There's a clear issue, but...meh. The DNC is into it, so you're not. Contrarian babies.
@khuxford @jeremyscahill All this skepticism is about refusal to criticize this persons regime, yet goes out of his way to bitch that David Frum is getting retweets?
@khuxford @jeremyscahill The entire issue is about Putin lol There's a foreign government that is going out of their way to mess with us. He murders JOURNALISTS.

@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum @chrislhayes He's not unique but what's your point? Let's not investigate this Russia issue? Are you just poking holes? This isn't policy it's bitching.
@SeanMichaelE @jeremyscahill @davidfrum @chrislhayes Pence is a creep, that's fair. But think he's a very easy target, and at least Bannon will be gone in that scenario. But what's your point?
@SeanMichaelE @jeremyscahill @davidfrum @chrislhayes How should this be investigated then?
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum @chrislhayes So sweep Russiagate under the rug completely so that David Frum's self esteem is kept in check?
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum @chrislhayes How is somebody going to DIE because Frum has a perspective on this scandal. Do you hear yourself?
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum First it was made up, then it was exaggerated, then it was unproven, then he FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR. Guys a crook is it that hard to accept?
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum When @chrislhayes articulated Russiagate on the podcast, scahill didn't even push back. Frum's allowed to participate. Fucking babies.
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum If Frum agreed with you on an issue you'd be all about it no matter his past or other current positions.
@SeanMichaelE @BeerdHead @jeremyscahill @davidfrum This is childish. You guys seem very scared your militant Russia skepticism is going down the drain with every Nixonian move Trump makes.
@BeerdHead @jeremyscahill Would you let @davidfrum push you from getting hit by a bus?

@Cowctus That scene has both.
@Cowctus just a subjective argument, do you see why that kind of screenwriting would be more worthwhile than the stuff he's putting up?
@Cowctus a Jewish kid growing up in b'more in the 60s dresses up like Hitler for Halloween and it freaks out his Jewish family.
@Cowctus fair enough. Let me ask you, what's your opinion of this clip: https://t.co/SH3w9I01U5
@Cowctus the idea that I'm going "off the rails" on you is basically synonymous with "harassment"
@Cowctus and if you do think you're being harassed right now by being politely questioned about your ridicule of Disney, cmon who's the ❄️
@Cowctus I don't think engaging in this conversation is "off the rails".
@Cowctus "trump's job now" curious what do you mean by this?
@Cowctus same logic: can't handle simple business decision by company that will never have power over you. Have you failed at being an adult
@Cowctus a parent with a kid who gets called that all the time? that already has problems to deal with?
@Cowctus Yes, rhetorical terms. True, nobody's being forced to do anything. I don't know what you think is the biggest problem in America.
@Cowctus I've used the word "retarded" SO many times in my life, just like you've been doing. But not in a job interview. Not to a parent.
@Cowctus the motive seemed to be to continue making almost the same zillion dollars they would without him, but without Nazi jokes.
@Cowctus I'm scrutinizing the idea that people are being forced to approve somebody else's idea.
@Cowctus how is he "shut down"? One of several large corporations he deals with no longer wishes to continue their business deal with him.
@Cowctus When you bring up a topic not for any reason but to offend somebody, you show your colors
@Cowctus When you bring up a topic not for any reason but to offend somebody, your joke doesn't add any clever observation
@Cowctus "If it's done well." Exactly. When you bring up a topic not for any reason but to offend somebody, this is what happens.
@Cowctus who said they aren't jokes?
@Cowctus If a nazi joke gets somebody fired and that's what you think is the most important to solve in America today, that's pathetic
@Cowctus what if you decided to cut a business deal because the person was boring you, don't you have that choice?
@Cowctus do you like really clean inoffensive G-rated humor?

@ppc59 well in the meantime you better make sure you and your loved ones have healthcare, this fantasy about getting rid of ACA is deadly.

@ppc59 from the bottom of my little whiney cityboy (agnostic) Jewish heart: what would Jesus do. Be honest here.
@ppc59 so by "turn the other cheek", he meant: those who disagree with you shall drown in their own sorrows once you gain power?

@jeffkessock whoooooaa you are fucked up
@jeffkessock "more"
@jeffkessock go apologize to Seth Rich's parents
@jeffkessock worse than Trump? You'd prefer Trump?
@jeffkessock about the activities of our son that night. We should be focusing on the perpetrator at large.”
@jeffkessock that at the moment a murderer remains at large, there remains unfounded press speculation
@jeffkessock "It’s unfortunate and hurtful,” his parents say, in a statement to Newsweek,
@jeffkessock "The slain man’s parents...are distressed by the apparent political exploitation of their son’s death by Clinton’s opponents"
@jeffkessock lets see
@jeffkessock they're probably from USUncut or some garbage so you won't post it
@jeffkessock Stats aren't magic, you gotta point them out...
@jeffkessock lets see
@jeffkessock he endorsed Hillary. Enough. move on from him if you think this is more important but damn man. Literally endorsed Hillary.
@jeffkessock yes we do. Go with the Dems no matter what. He's made it very clear
@jeffkessock no, SHE doesn't WANT your vote. Vulnerable Americans like undocumented immigrants and children in Flint NEED your vote.
@jeffkessock Bernie really doesn't like this mirror-image "were fucked with both of them" nonsense so you need to put his name up there too
@jeffkessock to show the prevalence of this bizarre idea that the two parties are mirror images of each other.
Well I blame you for going out of your way not to vote for her.  https://t.co/VbmNCp0LKn
This is the exact definition of post-primary ignorance. guys saying blame Hillary if WE help elect Trump. https://t.co/jPnJBL39kC
@jeffkessock "Trump isn't beholden to the establishment" if you search that, you will find Trump idiots pointing that out
@jeffkessock that was outward trump support, what you just tweeted. I know it's not really what's intended deep down. But look at this tweet
@jeffkessock my point was just to show that this attitude becomes *inadvertent* Trump support. Now you're actually defending the guy
@jeffkessock *you're
@jeffkessock Bernie is clearly done running. Stein is a loony that nobody seems to like outside of a few percentage points. What's the plan?
@jeffkessock I can guess which two candidates you'd like to replace her with. If we both know that isn't happening, then why berate Hillary?
@jeffkessock then why not #TrumpDropOut ?
@jeffkessock Giants-Saints next week. I hope saints forfeit. But I don't think that they actually will....
@jeffkessock why are you asking her to drop out? It's not something you do when you have money and support in the last phase of the fight
@jeffkessock trolling is when you're messing with the person to make them mad, I'm trying to address what you just wrote
@jeffkessock this is not what trolling is, I'm asking a very specific question it's pretty relevant
@jeffkessock is that the anti-Hillary plan from the left? Not an indictment but a personal decision not to run?
@jeffkessock it's not rhetorical by any means
@jeffkessock Convince Hillary Clinton to decide not to run. That's the plan?

@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock if a socialist meme misspelled 'independent' or 'existence' there'd be so many common core jokes.
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol yeah a little something for everybody
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol don't this nuclear family era that you're so nostalgic about included domestic abuse without any recourse
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic @willdit would be hilarious but I do not endorse this theory
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol @willdit @Praxial_Logic lol no comment
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @willdit @Praxial_Logic neither
@jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic @willdit @HalleyBorderCol you guys are talking about common core like they're eating your children
@jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic @willdit @HalleyBorderCol or just don't have the skill to explain what you think should change in the curriculum
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol @Praxial_Logic and when we ended slavery...that was...PROGRESS!!!
@HalleyBorderCol @willdit @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic they're fetuses
@HalleyBorderCol @willdit @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic you don't like the idea of ending slavery?
@willdit @jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol @Praxial_Logic when they were conservatives. Progressives are always on the good side of history
@HalleyBorderCol capitalism and socialism exist together in this country. Out there it was just fascist pseudo-communism
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @willdit @Praxial_Logic sold weapons to Iran. You'd cut obamas fucking head off if he pulled that shit.
@willdit @HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic if it does I want you to come back to this thread and gloat. It's here to stay.
@HalleyBorderCol gravity can kill you. we still use it.
@HalleyBorderCol and even bigger govs stopping them.
@willdit @HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic I dunno but proportionally way less than in the 50s for example. Progress.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic fire breaks out in your lab? My tax dollars have to come and save your racist establishment?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic then you do not agree with civil rights. You cannot discriminate on publicly regulated land.
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol wouldn't have conceded if he won. Enough, now we have yuge problems were gonna get together and solve.
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol the fact that he almost won is inspiring and productive. he didn't win.
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol he won in a lot of ways this year. just not the primary.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock had Bernie won, it would be even further to the left. Conservativism is almost dead. Marginalized.
@HalleyBorderCol the democratic platform (sorry @jeffkessock I appreciate Bernie but he isn't the nominee) is the most liberal ever. EVER.
@HalleyBorderCol still haven't answered. Name a time that we can look back and say "good thing we defeated those progressives"
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic everything you like too! Everything good we've ever done was because of progressivism
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic That's exactly the point!
@HalleyBorderCol the modern Republican Party fought every piece of progress tooth and nail
@HalleyBorderCol not one of the things I mentioned was helped by republicans lol
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic I'm Jewish. You think it should be legal to write "No Jews" outside of your physics lab?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic it is a progressive idea, and most conservatives have accepted this. Progressivism won.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic 4 times that the conservative party fought progressive ideas tooth and nail and lost.
@jeffkessock there will still be a federal military? That's my point
@jeffkessock so we're not getting rid of the program under your plan?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic all opposed by conservatives. inverse situation? When did conservatives ever help anybody
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic just a recap: civil rights, row v wade, marriage equality, the Great Society, ACA
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic medicare
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic Medicaid
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic social security
@jeffkessock we're not advocating that we devolve into state militias are we?
@jeffkessock I'll guess neither of us like a lot of what the military does. Don't we still need a federal military? Big govt is here to stay
@jeffkessock @HalleyBorderCol @Praxial_Logic still has to be pretty powerful right? A smaller more efficient military would be great
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic the right to marry who you want
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic healthcare reform
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic freedom for women to do what they want with their body
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic civil rights
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic but when was there a time when all the conservatives truly saved the day
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic as anecdotal/disagreeable these ideas are, these are just criticism of progressivism
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic are you going to link to times progressivism kind of failed? The govt is far from perfect
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic what's a conservative movement without any big govt that even lefties like me can agree worked?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic when did a conservative idea save our ass?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic LBJ was a racist. Agreed
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic  hard to answer because everything good that ever happened in this country, big govt helped.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic so we can give progressives of both parties credit.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic progressives left the GOP and joined the Dems, and racists left the dems and went to GOP.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic exactly. So when did the conservative idea EVER save the day?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic other times progressivism didn't work as well. when did conservative ideas ever save the day?
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic if somebody asked me when progressivism saved the day, I'd say the civil rights movement.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic when did the conservatives come in and save the day. EVER
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic these are all arguments for times big govt didn't do a great job. That's not my question
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic this chart seems to be an argument that big govt didn't help education in this instance.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic every war we've ever fought was a big govt operation
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic when did anti-progressivism, conservative ideas ever save the day.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic every good thing ever to happen in this country it was because of big gov't like it or not
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic well what was a time where we went backwards in regulation and it worked out.
@HalleyBorderCol @jeffkessock @Praxial_Logic why? By and large, this is already a socialist country and were better off for it
@WowIHateIdiots @HalleyBorderCol that's not what grammar is
@HalleyBorderCol meanwhile what is it with alt right racists and cartoon frogs. That is NOT a rhetorical question.
@HalleyBorderCol a fake news story about an un-PC comment that was supposedly made 30 years ago and you're calling other people petty
@WowIHateIdiots @HalleyBorderCol that's like writing "fuhck"....it doesn't change the pronunciation
@WowIHateIdiots @HalleyBorderCol 'retard' and 'reetard' are pronounced the same
RIP Gene Wilder, I've always felt that he tied with Hackman at the top spot of the gene list
@HalleyBorderCol so she probably just can't spell lol
@HalleyBorderCol the extra 'e' doesn't change anything. One 'e' already elongates the sound.
@HalleyBorderCol I think it's that the woman who wrote the book can't spell
@HalleyBorderCol why was it even hyphenated? Lolol
@HalleyBorderCol lol this meme spells 'retard' wrong
@FelllF @swin24 @AnnCoulter Hillary said abuela. Your argument is that if she can say a Spanish word trump isn't racist? These are NEO NAZIS
@FelllF @swin24 @AnnCoulter trump follows, gets material from supremacist Twitter accounts written by people that want Jews like me gassed
@FelllF @swin24 @AnnCoulter it's proof she's a corny old white woman big fucking deal.
@FelllF @swin24 @AnnCoulter they called coulter the C-word, I know republicans are scared of bad language hope you don't have nightmares
