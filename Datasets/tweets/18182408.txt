I am tall, but I was awkward &amp; the worst basketball player on the team in middle school. The dad coaches like Judge Kavanaugh gave me the courage to keep going out onto the court. Can’t be overstated how much of loss he would be to those young girls. Crushed.
The calendar is an important contemporaneous piece of corroboration in this matter.
I went to public school when I was young. When I transferred to parochial school, the first thing they did was hand me a calendar planner we were required to keep.

It was wrong when sexual assault victims were demeaned by our legal system, and it is equally wrong now to deny the accused due process protections and basic reporting standards. (3/3)
A news report where the only corroborating source is a person who did not witness the event in question is not journalism. That is unsubstantiated gossip, &amp; possibly defamatory. 		A tribunal where the accuser gets the last word does not comport with due process. That is mob rule.
