@tomweber_MPR your story this morning ... i was not ready for! üò≠üöó
@_RyanWinkler @larryrjacobs It‚Äôs dangerous to equate media coverage with campaign success. Obviously you know this.
@_RyanWinkler Mark Dayton is a millionaire.
@_RyanWinkler @larryrjacobs Unbelievably to me, despite your years in the legislature, I‚Äôm not sure you get how the news media works. Tim Pawlenty is, and will remain, inherently newsworthy. Every candidate for #mngov will have to work 10 times as hard as him. Stop fanning the flames.
This woefully misunderstands Pawlenty‚Äôs news media savvy. Pawlenty is inherently newsworthy (and know it) and will continue to draw headlines until the end of candidacy. It doesn‚Äôt mean DFL candidates are failing. They have to work 10 times as hard for every headline T-paw gets. https://t.co/qlD5CYQ0ck
@_RyanWinkler @TimPawlenty @larryrjacobs Of course not. He‚Äôs a former governor who (for whatever ‚Äúunknown‚Äù reason) (he‚Äôs bored, hot take) has decided to run again. Doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs a communication problem. It means he‚Äôs newsworthy. Doesn‚Äôt advance #dfl‚Äôers to pretend there‚Äôs a problem. Unless you‚Äôre a pundit.
@_RyanWinkler @TimPawlenty Therefore @larryrjacobs‚Äôs point (and your point) is moot. #dfl candidates for governor have been active in their messaging. The latter point is not my contention with your position.
I have a ton of respect for people who are smart and capable. But as #DFLers, let‚Äôs not pretend the cake is baked. The people have not yet spoken. This kind of uninformed messaging doesn‚Äôt help. A play, in several acts. @_RyanWinkler @larryrjacobs @epmurphymn @RepTimWalz https://t.co/B0o1xwFKp1
@_RyanWinkler Your tweet doesn‚Äôt address the matter. #dfl candidates for governor have been communicating about this for weeks. Quit spreading false rumors. You are a party leader.

False narrative about the #mngov race has been circulating regarding @TimPawlenty . @epmurphymn has been blasting his horrific record for weeks. I‚Äôm not agnostic, but assuming there‚Äôs a #DFL nominee is extremely misleading.
@_RyanWinkler Ryan, @epmurphymn has been doing this for weeks. Check her Facebook page for one second.

@GoldenGopherHFC is defending 10 players who may have obstructed the investigation and used scare tactics to silence the victim.
@GoldenGopherHFC is defending 10 players accused of gang raping an intoxicated woman. In succession. To "train" her.

@jakeloesch @5hauser a family of 4 in Moorhead on silver plan could pay $1100/year less in 2015 compared to this year. Hard 2 win that one.
@RachelSB  fam of 4 in Moorhead on silver plan could pay $1100/year less on MNsure in 2015
@John_Rouleau @JohnLivReynolds @SenatorBenson there are no deductible plans available.
@bbierschbach hard to make argument against Mnsure when fam of 4 in Moorhead on silver plan could pay $1100/year less in 2015
@SenatorBenson @JohnLivReynolds premium for family of 4 in Moorhead on silver plan making median income down almost $1100/year.
@SenatorBenson @JohnLivReynolds I don't know off hand but I bet commerce knows. Enough to have a major impact for Minnesotans in need.
@John_Rouleau @JohnLivReynolds @SenatorBenson agree with you.  You don't seem to understand "premiums" are different than "financial help."
@SenatorBenson @JohnLivReynolds in line with second cost silver. Different for everyone. Not an easy soundbite. Again, #shopandcompare
@bgolnik I think that the fact that 350k have gotten affordable health coverage is a major victory for Minnesotans.
@SenatorBenson @JohnLivReynolds financial help is more available than ever before. People should shop for themselves &amp; make own decisions
@JohnLivReynolds @SenatorBenson emphasis on affordable.
@bgolnik 54k (approx) since 10/1. Also, Minnesotans on public health plans aren't invisible. They're Minnesotans too.
@SenatorBenson @bgolnik we've accurately reported that 350k people have gotten coverage thru Mnsure. People come and go. Again, fact of biz
@bgolnik also you didn't answer my question- what's your plan?
@bgolnik pretty sure hundreds of thousands of people who got affordable coverage would disagree.
@SenatorBenson @bgolnik it's means 350k have gotten affordable coverage through MNsure. People in transition come and go. Fact of the biz.

6) (and final) Shop and compare on MNsure to ensure you get the best deal for you and your family.
5) For a second year in a row, Minnesota has the lowest health insurance rates in the nation.
4) More Minnesotans will be available for financial help and tax credits by choosing a plan through MNsure.
3) In 2015, people will have significantly more choice of plans on MNsure and in every corner of the state.
2) Minnesotans have received more than $20 million in savings through MNsure this year to lower the cost of health coverage.
A couple quick recap tweets from today: 1) Nearly 350,000 people have enrolled thru MNsure &amp; have affordable, comprehensive health coverage.
@John_Rouleau that is incorrect. We are encouraging people to shop and compare. Better deal for Minnesotans. #
