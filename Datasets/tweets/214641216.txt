@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld Wow. GTK your true colors Joe.
@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld Of course, but then why did you begin with “Hello?” Instead of “Hello Councilman, can you talk a bit about what you’ve done to champion the homeless epidemic in both Cincy and else ware?” You began accusatory from the get go. I’m only defending healthy dialogue on both sides.
@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld Ok Joe, you’re being passive aggressive unless you can post something tangible the councilperson has done or hasn’t that has adversely affected the homeless. What are you referring to exactly that PG has or hasn’t done? You began this.
@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld Well then don’t you think something more appropriate would be to ask him? You completely began with an accusatory tone like he did something adverse to the homeless, like a vote or something. That’s what had me perplexed.
@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld 2/2 otherwise I don’t get your “let’s dig just to dig” disposition.
@JosephWMead @Clevecarole @PGSittenfeld Ok I’m going to be blunt now. PG’s post was a general statement and you charged in about homelessness and that elected officials should be prepared to take grief. Well ok but if you’ve got something to say directly to PG about his stance or activism of homelessness, say it. 1/2
@JosephWMead @PGSittenfeld Apparently your post refers to something else to which I’m not knowledgeable.
@JosephWMead @PGSittenfeld That was not the spirit of the statement. As someone who has traversed both rural and urban areas of Ohio, it is well-said.
