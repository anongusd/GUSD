@WTPDavid @paulmitche11 @johnmyers To be clear, I think it is awesome that so much care and attention is taken to ensure that every vote is counted.  But there are millions of outstanding ballots that we have in hand right now and counts that have not been updated around the state today. We can do better.
@johnmyers But why then make excuses for a broken system? It‚Äôs clearly underfunded and could be better - let‚Äôs do it.
@paulmitche11 @johnmyers The reason there  is a gap between elections is specifically for the transition. California is amazing and there is a reason it takes so long to count the votes - but it‚Äôs also a problem that should be solved.
@paulmitche11 @johnmyers If you‚Äôre elected to Congress, staffing an office and making your plans to be the best representative you can be for your district takes some real time which is being swallowed up managing the counting situation in close races.
@johnmyers Let's fund it better! It is lousy and it hurts our democracy by not allowing elected leaders to use the precious time between elections and swearing-ins to actually prepare for office.
@sarahewk @johnmyers Exactly -- let's get more!
@johnmyers Paul isn't wrong - we should do better. The other way to consider this apples &amp; oranges comparison is to consider all 30 of those states are capable of counting their ballots in a fraction of the time it takes those 2 counties &amp; the most innovative state in the Union to do it.

With his defenders like Brian Kilmeade warning, even today, of diseased hordes trying to get in our country -- knowing that such false rhetoric has sent some Trump supporters on a violent path -- this is a dark and dangerous moment.
Instead, this one has been casually tweeting about baseball and is back onto vigorously inciting people against the press as the enemy of the people.
Any other president would have been a moral leader in healing us after the worst massacre at a synagogue in our history and the largest plot to successfully send bombs to American leaders, including at news organizations.

@realBenShapero Buffy advised President Obama throughout his campaigns and presidency. She earned her stripes as a community organizer fighting the most important progressive battles in the country.  The fact that you think he shouldn't have endorsed her until he endorsed anyone else is strange.
@ericbroder @BuffyWicks @JovankaBeckles No but seriously, what's the deal on the space mind control priority from Jovanka? Is there a space mind control agenda for the legislature too? Are there tin foil hats?		Buffy sided with Hillary while Jovanka helped Trump get elected with Jill Stein. That's who Buffy sides with.
@ericbroder @BuffyWicks Why did you leave out Jovanka's mind control leadership?  You're making it seem like she doesn't want to talk about that.		Also, Buffy was a proud Californian who served on President Obama's campaign and in his administration. Denigrating her experience is dishonest.

(5/17) ‚Äì on taxes, energy and cutting foreign aid ‚Äì though not in a hyper-partisan way.  The differences with the way our president ran his campaign are obvious and sad but offers hope for a different kind of politics that still exists in not too distant reaches in our country.
(4/17) But even beyond that, consider these lines ‚Äì crafted with @jwgop and @marksalter55 ‚Äì from a Republican presidential nominee and you‚Äôll see what a remarkably different kind of presidential candidate he was.  Some of it is indeed grounded in GOP orthodoxy

@meredithk27 @HotlineJosh And for historical context, almost 40 Republicans have retired this cycle -- less than 10 retired in 2006.
@HotlineJosh @meredithk27 We don't agree.  Culberson is not a near must-win, it is one of dozens of competitive seats of which we need 23 for a majority. And his performance in this poll says not much about whether there is a D wave, it says that he's in for a tough race.
@HotlineJosh @meredithk27 In the last D wave in 2006, we didn't win every seat in a blowout - competitive races were close throughout and we didn't win them all (e.g., Gerlach, Shays, H Wilson, et al.).  But every R under 50 at this point was in trouble - this poll shows an incumbent with a tough road.
As a life long Bills fan, it is so weird raising a little Warriors fan - when they basically win all. the. time.

in the same way the handling of Katrina collapsed support for Republicans in 2006 -- that die is not exactly cast just yet.
While I do believe the table is being set for his and GOP disqualification with key voters should he mismanage a national crisis --
Trump is well above water with independents (52%-34%) ‚Äì Obama was ahead as well at this point, at 60%. Not extraordinarily different.
Trump has a 51% disapproval, that means 49% of Americans are staring into the dumpster fire thinking 'Yes!' or 'meh, let‚Äôs see how it goes.'
Though 1 in 3 voters give Trump an F, a higher number (37%) give him an A or B. (Also, are you kidding me, America!?)
No you‚Äôd rather not have his numbers ‚Äì but they‚Äôre not exactly fatal. Take today‚Äôs McClatchy poll for example.

@samsteinhp it is possible to cover this story without promising apocalypse because of a phone call. No major outlet has achieved that.
@alexburnsNYT @mckaycoppins And if you look at the breaking news alerts and stories on this, there is a lot of that.
@alexburnsNYT @mckaycoppins My problem is the general lack of self-awareness around reporting assumptions about Trump instead of just facts.
@alexburnsNYT @mckaycoppins  I didn't call it a distraction. Trump said he was going to treat China like this and then he did.
@blakehounshell Further, if there isn't a new rift, as the breathless breaking news alerts promise, it sets him up as winner in the exchange
@blakehounshell but to treat this like it's out of character only makes him stronger with his base.
@blakehounshell the middle finger to China is the approach he promised. Maybe the consequences will be suboptimal...
@blakehounshell This is reminiscent of the press explosion when candidate Obama suggested he'd be open to talking to Ahmadinejad. But...

Carson and Cruz didn't have major gaffes but certainly lost ground tonight. Might be the reason that Trump doesn't actually lose steam.
While I can't wait for the movie, I do question the marketing decision to advertise for Straight Out of Compton during the GOP debate.
In the 2012 debates the GOP crowd booed a gay vet. In this debate, the crowd cheers Kasich going to a gay wedding. Undeniable progress.
Expected GOP to spend time disqualifying themselves on immigration - didn't expect Rubio's disqualifying race to the right on choice.
Key takeaway so far: Everything the GOP candidates say is mired in the past - Reagan, Iran hostages in the SEVENTIES, even the Godfather.
The Republicans seem more focused on Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton.  Didn‚Äôt see that coming.
Huckabee says "pimps"		People who had that on their GOP Debate Bingo Card are both surprised and elated.
RT @jonfavs: Watching a focus group of Trump supporters right now would be the most interesting anthropological experiment in the world.
Serious question: Don't you wish there was a little box on the screen that just had a live feed of the Trump camera, the entire time?
Did Ben Carson just paraphrase Obama on "stupid wars?"  (Answer: yes)
Bush cannot figure out how to talk about Iraq.  It's uncomfortable to watch.
John Kasich most deft at dealing with Trump.
Thank you, Donald Trump.  You have made this debate everything.
Megyn Kelly/Scott Walker exchange probably the most important of the night - it will live deep into the general if he's the nominee.
Scott Walker on @PPFA is the biggest reason he can't be elected.
I guess Rosie O'Donnell isn't going to get her 30 seconds to respond.
Rubio calls himself the candidate of the future, Bush says he was known as "Veto Corleone" (a movie older than me).  Just saying.
