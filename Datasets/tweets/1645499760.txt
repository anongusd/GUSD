@Roberttimestwo It would be a perpetual negative cash flow scheme to fund the border with technology without a border wall. Same as what Israel uses for terrorists.
@Roberttimestwo Who do you think is funding all this terrorism?
@realannapaulina @emmy600 They do that at night btw.
@Roberttimestwo The amount of money required to cover the entire border with agents would be prohibitive.
@Roberttimestwo A Russian charter flight ferrying 224 passengers and crew to St. Petersburg from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, crashed soon after taking off early Saturday, killing everyone onboard. Who do you suppose did this? Nov 01, 2015
@Roberttimestwo Use Google Maps and zoom in on the New Mexico - Mexico border. There are huge gaps there anyone can just walk over into the United States.
@Roberttimestwo So you don't think that Iranians support terrorist organizations with all those billions Obama gave back to them? Do you think it's a smart idea to have sections of the New Mexico border wide open?
@Roberttimestwo Do you seriously believe for one moment the Iranians have halted their Nuclear ambitions?
@Roberttimestwo Both supported the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East.
@MHarrisPerry Tikkun Olam, tzedakah and gemilut hasadim #Progressive #Jewishguilt
@krassenstein Tikkun Olam Today.
The phrase ‚Äútikkun olam‚Äù was first used to refer to Jewish #social action movement in the 1950's. Social action programs like tzedakah (charitable giving) and gemilut hasadim (acts of kindness) and other #progressive Jewish approaches to social issues. #Liberals #Pelosi #Schumer
@JannaWilkinso69 Only half, the liberal media has silenced everything to the right of center.
@EdKrassen Yep Tikkun Olam...repair of the world.
@Dubroq So you think it was a smart idea to return that $$$ back to Iran? Now they can stick their noses up at the deal Obama made and resume Nuclear ICBM aspirations.
@RobertEverett13 You probably think returning that $$$ was a smart idea right? Billions of dollars Iran can now use to further there Nuclear ICBM aspirations.
@csedgman How's this? The members of the Obama Administration National Security Council PSD-11 Task Force recommended a US Government embracement of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood in Islamic countries of the Arab Middle East. So did Mohamed Atta.	https://t.co/Rnbs31tG1g

@ItsWhatsername Mohamed Atta was a Coral Springs Resident too! Another GOOD reason to be wary of immigrants from the Middle East! That's why we need a wall to prevent them from coming through the southern border.

@staymaddening @EdKrassen @POTUS Most level headed common sense people understand there needs to be border security that prevents all kinds of societal ills. Pelosi and Schumer are just pandering to their base. Why? Because they'd be out of a job if they gave into the @POTUS policies.

@staymaddening @EdKrassen @POTUS If you bothered to read Article II Section III it specifically states that 'the President on extraordinary occasions *convene* both Houses, or either of them'.

@tedlieu You're making it sound or appear acceptable to murder/kill indigenous Americans all because immigrants commit less crime, which of course is not acceptable.
@ThomTheProphet @tedlieu There is one fact that's undeniable, Americans are being murdered by undocumented criminals coming across the border. Nothing can lessen or mitigate that fact.
@TrumpAgitator @tedlieu Sounds like you're attempting to mitigate the tragedies of Americans and their family members getting murdered by people coming across the border.
@ThomTheProphet @tedlieu That's a value judgement on your part. The fact is that no one institution has exclusively studied crime all along the US - Mexican border. Immigrant is a broad brush, and includes many who are in fact not from Mexico or Central America.
@tedlieu Cato vice president for research Brink Lindsey agreed that libertarians and liberals should view each other as natural ideological allies. üëàü§®
@tedlieu In 2006, Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos proposed the term "Libertarian Democrat" to describe his particular liberal position, suggesting that libertarians should be allies of the Democratic Party.

@chiaincharge @thehill That's 17 trips. You'll need to pull a freedom of information at the GAO to find out the average cost of one trip. Good luck with getting that information.
@veesharma07 @DonaghyRay @dcexaminer Congress has enacted a Presidential Succession Act on three occasions: 1792 (1 Stat. 239), 1886 (24 Stat. 1), and 1947 (61 Stat. 380). The 1947 Act was last revised in 2006.
@chiaincharge @thehill You claimed Each trip to Mar-a-lago costs US $3M which is bullshit. That report was for Obama's trip to Palm Beach.
@veesharma07 @DonaghyRay @dcexaminer That's not what the 1972 law covers. It specifically says "in the even both President and Vice President" perish or are removed at the same time.
@chiaincharge @thehill The GAO report in question, one of very few available estimates of the cost of presidential travel, did not say exactly that a trip to Mar-a-Lago cost $3.6 million. The report covered a specific trip Obama took in 2013 covering two cities including Palm Beach.
@chiaincharge @thehill Both presidents Obama &amp; Trump went to Palm Beach. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama‚Äôs 2013 trip.
@chiaincharge @thehill Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu on Hawaii. Like she couldn't have a vacation in Florida for a quarter of the cost, and be close enough to negotiate.
@chiaincharge @thehill The California Democrat's suite, a posh Hawaiian resort, which she has rented for the past two Christmases, goes for $10,000 a night. Plus the cost of the security detail to local taxpayers of $34,000.
@chiaincharge @thehill Well, sorry your feeble mind feels the need to debate with a lesser account.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer Presidential Succession Act 1792. Section 9 in the event of the removal, resignation, death, or inability of both the President and Vice President, the President pro tempore of the Senate was next after the Vice President, followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer Still don't get the Secretary of the Treasury over the Secretary of Defense. Makes little sense.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer IF Trump were to die in office, then that would make the speaker of the house 2nd in line after the Vice President. However, even if the President were to be removed from office the Vice President being President would chose another Vice President.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer That's why Bush used to call the speaker of the house 3rd.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer No. The Speaker of the House is 3rd in line to be President. Pence is 2nd.
@TODAYshow @AviFlyGirl @SavannahGuthrie @NancyPelosi O'l Nancy has just shown her playing cards to @POTUS . She feels it's racist against latinos to have a border wall, nothing to do with cost, but she can live with the consequences of an occasional murder by undocumented migrants.

@briantylercohen O'l Nancy has just shown her playing cards to @POTUS . She feels it's racist against latinos to have a border wall but she can live with the consequences of an occasional murder by undocumented migrants.
@funder Why? Because the democrats think building a border wall would a sign of racism against latinos. It has nothing to do with the overall cost.
@myserenity69 @joefaz @SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi just played her cards, it's no longer about the cost to build a border wall. Nancy and her entourage consider a border wall *racist* against latinos. She's anthropomorphizing a wall for crying out loud. #BuildThatWall

@TrinityResists @B52Malmet What Kennedy clearly did not call for was a massive increase in the number of immigrants being admitted to the United States.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet In 1958 the ADL not only endorsed, but published Kennedy's calls for a more liberal US immigration policy. The immigration reforms Kennedy called for went well beyond their original intent and produced many unforeseen consequences.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet To this day, there is a strong feeling that, had it not been for the highly restrictive immigration policies of the US (and other countries), many of Europe's Jews could have been saved. That's the crux of immigration policy being forced today.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet Do some research for once in your life, and stop parroting the loony left.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet The mix of immigrants, legal and illegal, shifted dramatically in favor of Latin America and Asia ‚Äì a fact that Kennedy, in later years, would attribute to illegal immigration.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet It's pretty obvious ever since Ted Kennedy's immigration policies. Kennedy and the ADL-a division of B'nai Brith, the most prominent Jewish organization in the United States-found a commonality of interests.

@PoesLaw2 It would be foolish to choose any other weapon, since anything less than firing 100% of the time for a first shot could result in none of them getting killed after everyone's turn. Which means they all die with 100% certainty.
@PoesLaw2 Assuming "Apu" goes first &amp; selects 'A' revolver that fires 100% of the time, his best chance of survival would be to kill Marvin. That would leave "Groyper" with only a 6 out of 10 chance of killing "Apu". That's nearly a 50/50 chance.

@PoesLaw2 If the waiter in the puzzle openly pocketed a $2.00 tip that leaves $28.00. The waiter was given $30.00 by the guests, so giving them each $1.00 back leaves $25.00 from the total, but no one really knows what each individual meal actually cost. It should also be you and 2 frens.
@PoesLaw2 But he keeps $2.00 as tip, and gives back $1.00 each. That's $5.00, so if the total is $29.00, he must have pocketed just $1.00 to make $30.00

@PoesLaw2 He pocketed $1.00, made each pay $9.00 instead of $10.00, while tipping himself $2.00. If you add the stolen $1.00, the total tip is $3.00, which would be a 10% tip.

@thedailybeast What was that thing POTUS said about countries outside the US?
@PoliticallyRYT @RodStryker Probably been smoking too many doobies.
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson They most certainly are in retrograde, displacing natives here or elsewhere would be unthinkable for them today.
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson That is nothing more than a utopian ideology pushed by the far left, machines can be made equal, humans as individuals can not be 'made equal' by policy.
Why is the progressive left today afflicted with cultural tribalism?
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson There's only one conclusion here, and that is 'progressives' are in retrograde.
@JannaWilkinso69 Where's the General?
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson Well how about this 1800's picture here? Manifest destiny was the progressive's motive for westward expansion displacing natives. Progressives now would be outraged. https://t.co/ZEtdahCDve
