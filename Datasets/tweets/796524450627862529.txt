@blake132berdine @olgrcich The criminals get their guns from states with low gun laws, by raising the laws and making them stronger, it will become harder for criminals to get their weapons and commit mass murder, once again, no one said we would ban all guns.
@blake132berdine @olgrcich But it‚Äôs not illegal to purchase guns in!!!... wait for it... wait for it... INDIANA! Where the criminals get their guns from the state with eased restrictions on gun laws!
@blake132berdine @olgrcich And we don‚Äôt want to ban all guns, that‚Äôs not what this is about. It‚Äôs just about making it harder for criminals to get their guns in the first place. It‚Äôs our job to make sure the world is a safer, better place, and weak gun law states are where we start.
@blake132berdine @olgrcich How does going into a state (Indiana) with minimal gun laws, buying a gun, and taking it across state lines sound illegal? It‚Äôs completely legal, it‚Äôs just wrong. We need consistency within our laws so they are universal and we don‚Äôt have this type of inequality between states.

@therealmontes00 You say that that‚Äôs not the solution, then what is? If education and reform is not the solution, what is?
@therealmontes00 What you‚Äôre missing is it‚Äôs not just school shooters. School shootings are just one part of gun violence in America. We need reform now, to prevent gun violence. It‚Äôs students, it‚Äôs gangs, it‚Äôs children, it‚Äôs mentally ill people, it‚Äôs criminals, and it‚Äôs the problem plaguing us.
@therealmontes00 The difference is I just cannot stand quietly by while thousands die at the barrel of a gun. We need to do something, and compliance with gun violence is not that.
@therealmontes00 With that type of mentality nothing would get done. The solution is action, wether it be passing laws, more background checks, or just education. Even by this discussion we have had, it‚Äôs some sort of action because hopefully through this someone will become educated on the issue
@therealmontes00 So are we supposed to stand idle by? You say we don‚Äôt make gun laws more strict, but you say that school shootings are ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù. If you want to do something, but you don‚Äôt want to pass laws to prevent deaths, then what‚Äôs the solution? You‚Äôre standing in compliance with terror
@therealmontes00 This country‚Äôs gun laws are too loose, and the consequences are shown every single day in America, and every 60 hours on school campuses.
@therealmontes00 The gun show loop hole isn‚Äôt fixed? The senate shot that down in December! Private sellers at a gun show don‚Äôt need any sort of background checks, or even an online gun seller! Anyone can obtain a gun without the knowledge of even their name.
@therealmontes00 One thing we could do is pass REAL federal background checks. The next is ban semi automatic weapons used in mass shootings. School shootings don‚Äôt take place with hunting rifles, it‚Äôs with military grade weapons they obtain from their parents closet that their dad got at a show.
@therealmontes00 You‚Äôre mistaken. According to everytown, where this statistic was gathered by ABC, CNN, NBC, and the Huffington Post, a school shooting is defined as any time a firearm is discharged in a school or on campus. Not just ‚Äúfinding a bullet‚Äù, but actually firing the gun near students.
oday, is sadly routine for our nation. Tomorrow, there will be another shooting. There will be another school shooting within the week. There will be another mass shooting this month. It‚Äôs too late for many, and the rest of America cannot wait longer. We need action now.
d against the most simple, blanket federal background checks. It‚Äôs not a time for ‚Äúprayer‚Äù, or ‚Äúgrievances‚Äù, and ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù, it‚Äôs a time for action. It is the time and it has been the time for years for gun control, and that is something as a nation we need to get accomplished. T
There‚Äôs been a school shooting every 60 hours in our nation. It‚Äôs not just school shooting though, it‚Äôs the toddler getting into their parents closet, the night club shootings, the gang violence, the senseless murders of thousands. Despite this bloodshed, 23 current senators vote
@therealmontes00 oh okay, so since no one died, it‚Äôs okay. Any gun on a school campus is terrifying and those kids deserve recognition for their traumatic experience.
@Kaylaannnh You‚Äôre seeing 8 on the guardian, that definetly explains why that is wrong and the actually number is double that improper statistic
@Kaylaannnh  https://t.co/tI5S5V8Pef
@therealmontes00  https://t.co/pYmTlgYvH0
@Kaylaannnh There‚Äôs been 18 school shootings so far, not 8.
