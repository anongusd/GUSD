@JPaperno @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I agree with you on most of this.  Our differences are about the effectiveness of walls and the enforcement of laws.  Build the wall and change the laws.  But to not secure the border via wall and not enforce the law seems misguided.
@JPaperno @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump This is a terrible argument.  But onward...  What about the safety of border patrol when interacting with people illegally crossing the border?  Why have that risk at all?
@medwoman1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Getting on a plane and getting a Visa to come here are at least a form of vetting.  According to the reasoning of the original post Canada does not have the same problems for people to flee.  The cost of the wall is less than 15 mins of federal government time.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Why cant we do both.  Based on your accurate description the wall should be built first/now.

@Steve_Yo_ @SenSanders EPA, USDA, BLM, FDA, CPB.  All of which have unelected leaders making rules for America.  Who voted them in, who holds them accountable, how successful are average citizens when steamrolled by these organizations?
@Steve_Yo_ @SenSanders All those unelected people who make rules and laws.  Most of the letter organizations.  Basically an entire political class that is unaccountable to the people.

@DeadWoodMedia1 @VoteOjeda2020 That podcast is a great start to getting in the weeds on the public funding problem.  Charter schools and vouchers offer some more choices.

@DeadWoodMedia1 @VoteOjeda2020 @voxdotcom The largest problem was falling birth rates.  The population was shrinking but roofs still need replacement and buildings are not cheaper to heat.  It was a great overview of a great centralized plan gone wrong despite the best of intentions.
@DeadWoodMedia1 @VoteOjeda2020 @voxdotcom Specific to the podcast...  people wanted to keep small schools in local communities.  This was impossible.  Instead they settled on having 1-4,5-8,9-12[or some variation all in different communities  close to each other.  This destroyed local community.
@DeadWoodMedia1 @VoteOjeda2020 I mean capitalism bad seems like a silly argument in a field that needs innovation to stay ahead and give the best possible student education outcomes.  This seems like a case where different may equal better.
@DeadWoodMedia1 @VoteOjeda2020 Interesting take.  @voxdotcom had a very interesting future perfect episode about school funding.  The real problem seemed to be getting money to keep schools in communities.  Huge inefficiencies abounded.

@TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire This is a very interesting tactic.  Sure I make 100s of mistakes a day.  I apologize for suggesting no Jewish person could be racist.  From my point of view no group or person is absolute in beliefs or action.  Sorry you saw it that way or that it came across as such.
@TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire Anti-conservatives would argue we have not a d can not start from equal footing in America.  Both stances are correct.  Both stances are incorrect.  The real truth is in the middle.
@TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire Not at all.  100% agreement that any person can be anything they choose at any moment.  I think the real question we are taking to task is equal opportunity vs equality of outcome.  Conservatives think we are starting from a place of equality simply by being American.
@LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire I should have put logic in quotes.
@LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire By this logic you sound like an anti-semite.  Not that you are an anti-semite but you are calling a Jewish man racist.
@TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire I respect and understand your opinion.  I think "right", "conservative", and other punditry titles have broad definitions.  Not only broad but personal.  Again I have to mention that for cause effectiveness lumping all this together under racism seems misguided.
@daggerandpen @LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @realDailyWire So in short you are unwavering that @realDailyWire is a racist organization?  When is the last time you listened to any of its shows?
@TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro @TalibKweli I love you, your music, and your interview with @daxshepard was mind expanding.  Thanks for tweeting a reply.  My worry is the false equivalence that started this tweet thread is completely ineffective toward the goal of eliminating racism.
@LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro Wait a second..   Are you saying all people who support Ben Shapiro are racist against black people?  Like you can just write off everyone who is a subscriber to @realDailyWire as a bigot because @benshapiro has some hot takes on a few issues?
@LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro Interesting take.  Is it possible some conservatives really believe in equal opportunity universally?  Would it better this argument by not assigning the worst possible motives to the other viewpoint?  To be specific calling Ben Shapiro racist  vs conservative.
@LeeBrown1273 @TalibKweli @Run_556 @Twitter @benshapiro Does it further the cause to lump Ben Shapiro into this argument?  We need more words to describe people.

@partyofthepeopl @RealSaavedra This sort of falls under funny regardless of who you are.  She was sadly serious.
@realDailyWire I really wanna vote for him but will I get the chance?
@realDailyWire I feel like I am in another @KidRock for Senate moment...
@robert_flanagan @TheEllenShow Ha Ha Ha.  No I just go to LA often.  I am guessing you see no problem in the hypocrisy of million dollar homes burning be national news via celebrity tweet while people are living on LA streets overdosing.  Both are terrible and tragic but only one is news...
@TheEllenShow A drive around downtown LA speaks a different message.
Exciting times coming up on the house floor. https://t.co/MfG2uhEd6w
@JasonIsbell Also okay to use frigidaire in place of refrigerator depending on where you are from.  Music keeping its regional slang is one of the many reason I love acts that use this for effect from Mos Def to The Drive By Truckers.
@jeffisawake All of it?  The politicians?  The Gators?

@ElishaKrauss Always stepping on his own message is a tragedy for his approval numbers.
@MaxBoot To be clear the more autonomy for mission completion and resource availability the better job it can do to fulfill said mission.  Budget is 1000x better than a more with less message.  Ask me how I know...
@realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Hilarious
@StormyDaniels Many things can be said about Mrs. Daniel's, but no one can say she is not beautiful or funny.
@jbendery @jonfavs 10 hours and 11 minutes is 10 years in today's news cycle.  Of course a person grows in 10 years.
@aplusk @glennbeck If the numbers stay this close and the population is increasing then the gun death rate is still going down.

@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump What state?
@jodikantor @maggieNYT Could it be that Democrats want to raise taxes?  Why is anti-semitism the cause?  Are Republicans not saying the same things about non-Jewish Democrats?
@JeremyKrantz @jaketapper What state and district are you in?  Voting for @LarrySharpe is awesome if you are in NY.  Other than that R all the way down.
@jaketapper Vote Republican!
@RandyRRQuaid Get well soon and thank goodness you voted early.

@partyofthepeopl @UniteVoteRed @marcmolinaro @LarrySharpe Sharpe only needs 30%.   The Republican in this race will get less than 10%.  Sharpe will get more votes than the Republican.  Your logic is backwards.  All that aside @LarrySharpe has amazing ideas that will improve life for all New Yorkers.
@UniteVoteRed @partyofthepeopl @marcmolinaro Vote @LarrySharpe
