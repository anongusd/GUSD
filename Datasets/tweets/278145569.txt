Read my op-ed on why the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act shouldn't be considered controversial via @FoxNews https://t.co/GvVF7tL4uD
This is a bill I sponsored in the House and support wholeheartedly in the Senate. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will, too. There should be nothing controversial about providing necessary medical care to a newborn child.
Today, the Senate will vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Bill, which ensures that babies born as a result of a botched abortion receive the same care as any other newborn. Essentially, it‚Äôs a bill against infanticide ‚Äì this vote should be a no brainer.

We discussed this and more at our @SenateCommerce committee hearing this morning. It is important to ensure that we meet the needs for expanding broadband in our communities while also protecting our networks from foreign adversaries.
As we look to expand broadband, we need to ensure the technology we are using is secure. We should be mindful that winning the race to 5G requires a whole of government approach and collaboration with the private sector.

304,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January - nearly twice the number forecasted. Our pro-growth policies are providing real results for the American people.
Senator Sasse just asked the Senate to unanimously pass S. 130, a bill to stop infanticide. It is unconscionable for the Democrats to obstruct legislation that protects life.

If fuel economy policies force auto manufacturers to produce vehicles that customers do not want or cannot afford, no one wins.  We need realistic fuel economy standards, and harmonization of standards. Thank you, @EPAScottPruitt, for leading on this issue https://t.co/lCYUK7Aef4

It's time we stand with the American people instead of standing with Silicon Valley. You deserve online security. Big Tech is not entitled to your information, and you should be in control of your virtual 'you.' 		https://t.co/fgpWvHlWJb
Big Tech companies pretend to care about privacy, but the truth is, they have been selling the privacy of Tennesseans' to the highest bidder for years. You need to know who has access to your information, and what they are using it for. https://t.co/WFpU2uxCwS
And we thank Secretary Shulkin for his service.
We are forever in their debt, &amp; they deserve our utmost respect. For this reason, we have to have a leader who understands the needs of our veterans, &amp; can give them the best care possible. We look forward to Ronnie Jackson's tenure as Secretary of Veteran's Affairs.
Our veterans make the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. They put their life on the line so we, here at home, can be safe. As Americans, we are constantly reminded that freedom isn't free, and it is our service men and women who make us the best nation on earth.
Mark 'Universal Income' Zuckerberg has made billions of dollars by selling your information. You have a right to online privacy. https://t.co/SFHoiixyID

Further, I applaud President @realDonaldTrump for nominating Deputy Director Gina Haspel to take over at the CIA as its first female Director.
He has impeccable leadership skills and will represent our country well as head of the State Department.  We thank Secretary Tillerson for his service and wish him well.
Mike and I worked together for several years in the House and on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I know him to be a man of integrity.   He did a tremendous job protecting our country from foreign threats as Director of the CIA.
These numbers speak for themselves. This is what happens when you have a businessman in the White House, and Republicans in Congress dedicated to cutting taxes and lifting regulations. 		https://t.co/KXtFNJP3q0

Good luck to Team USA! We're rooting for you!
We must pass this budget, and give our military the adequate funding that they need to do their job.
From Iran and North Korea chasing nuclear weapons to China's build up in the South China Sea, we are facing threats from all corners of the world.  I am tired of reading about our brave men and women dying in training exercises.
The military is the backbone of our great nation and the blanket of security under which we rest.  I will always stand with our troops.  Always.  They have been let down, and the American people have been let down. Our leaders have to do better.
The fact that lawmakers would cast this aside in order to fulfill their own political narrative is baffling and shameful.
Their family and friends risk losing a loved one, but know the dignity of their decision. These brave young men and women are extraordinary, and their selflessness deserves our total reverence and respect.  Period.
When our service men and women volunteer to defend this country, they put their lives on the line each and every day for our freedom. They make the ultimate sacrifice, because they know the magnitude of their decision and the honor in their choice.
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the Democrats have proven once again that they care more about illegal aliens than they care about our military and healthcare recipients. The Pelosi/Schumer shutdown is disgraceful. They should be ashamed of themselves.
Enough is enough. It's time for my colleagues in the Senate to stop playing political games and do their job.
Out of fairness, out of respect, and out of loyalty for those who put on the United States uniform and defend this country, I voted today to fund our military and support their efforts. https://t.co/zP1D6jILhv

No coincidence that on the one-year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump's  inauguration, Schumer and the Dems deliberately shutdown our government. Their move is nothing more than an attempt to score points with their ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù radical base &amp; their Silicon Valley donor class.

What are the Senate Democrats saying no to? They're saying no to six years of children's health care funding. They are saying no to funding our military and our security forces. It's #shutdownsaturday, but we're here, and we're working. And we're waiting on the Senate. https://t.co/TxyyZhkAxo
They have let their constituents, and all Americans down.
Democrats have also shown they have no desire to protect our nation's borders and provide security for Americans. Bc they wouldn't come to the table for a simple compromise they have put the lives of our children and our seniors in danger. Shame on them for their selfish behavior
I am so disappointed that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate thought it was better to play political games than fund our military. Our men and women in uniform, who sacrifice so much for our safety, deserve more than this total disregard for their service.
We took a big step forward today to protect the lives of the unborn. https://t.co/WG1BFK1alw

If the Democrats really cared about the Dreamers, they would have come to the negotiation table. I am disappointed that the Democrats chose to let both the Dreamers, and their constituents down.  Political games should not be played when the stakes are so high.
Tonight, I voted to fund our troops, our seniors, and our children. The Democrats have proven once again, they will put the lives of millions of Americans, and their livelihoods, all at risk to fulfill their own political agenda. Republicans were very clear what they wanted.
Tonight, the House will vote to keep the government open. https://t.co/npnh1whw0v

I agree with @realDonaldTrump- years of crippling regulations, crushing taxes, and corrupt politicians hurt our economy, and hurt our farmers and ranchers. Thank you, @POTUS, for ending so many of the crippling Obama-era regulations that hurt Tennesseans.

The economy is finally on the upswing after years of being suffocated by Obama-era regulations.  Today the Dow crossed 25,000 and we added 250k jobs in Dec. This is what happens when you get government out of the way and let the private sector do its job.	https://t.co/XYtcxBYib3
Washington has a spending problem. We need to send some government programs, like Medicaid, back to the states. Tennessee's elected officials know what Tennesseans need more than the federal government does. 	https://t.co/lQPejhIvJM
America‚Äôs timid response to the '09 Iranian Green Movement was a mistake. Iran is censoring and killing protestors once again. The awful Obama nuclear deal has only emboldened this oppressive regime. We stand for freedom. Thank you for your leadership @nikkihaley @realdonaldtrump
Let's secure that southern border, and let's end illegal entry. https://t.co/cR3H6KOBpy
The Iranian regime is no friend of freedom and we made a terrible nuclear deal with them.  Brave protestors are once again shining a light on Iran‚Äôs brutality.  Thank you @realdonaldtrump for standing with them in their quest for freedom.

Washington has a spending problem. It's time Congress tackles our deficit, and finally balances the budget. Watch me this morning on @AmericaNewsroom discussing why it's so important we stop reckless government spending.

@realDonaldTrump signed the #TaxCutAndJobsAct into law. This means you get to keep more of your hard earned money, and you're going to see the economy grow. The Obamacare individual mandate is now gone. Too many Tennesseans were forced to buy health insurance they didn't want.

It's taken 31 years, but the time is finally here. I'm on my way to vote yes for #taxreform. This bill will give much needed tax relief to hardworking families, and allow small businesses to once again thrive. The government isn't entitled to your hard-earned dollars. https://t.co/tVZf1a35vr

We need to ensure that the internet cannot block or throttle users. This comes from light-touch regulations from Congress, not unelected bureaucrats. https://t.co/Bzr0jstvsG
Obamacare-era "net neutrality" is nothing more than a code word for government takeover of the internet. These regulations stifled internet investment and growth, and gave tech companies a free pass to censor users and block free speech.
There's been a lot of confusion around the term "net neutrality." People have been led to believe the Obama-era rules mean a free and open internet for users. This is simply not true. https://t.co/D1RKpAE1DS

Happy #BillofRights Day! On this day we remember the tremendous foresight of our Founding Fathers in ensuring that above all, the rights of the individual should be protected. The original 10 amendments to the Constitution remind us that as Americans, we have a core value-freedom
The internet needs light-touch regulation so you are guaranteed fair and free access. Obama-era net neutrality rules hurt investment and innovation. We need our internet across the country to be up to 21st century standards. 	 	https://t.co/5LSgOS4X9F
Watch my interview tonight on @WKRN about #NetNeutralty https://t.co/TnNBAVt9y3
These regulations hurt broadband expansion (which is your ability to get a provider), and network investment (which helps companies innovate so you can have faster internet). We need to permanently enact rules that prevent throttling and blocking- but that's Congress' job.
Could you get online before Obama's net neutrality regulations? The internet was not broken, and did not need the federal government to enforce overbearing regulations to "fix" it.

Obamacare is unaffordable, and being forced to buy it is an infringement on your liberty and freedom. We must repeal the individual mandate in the tax bill. Here are three numbers that will shock you: https://t.co/SlnkIvM3jE
Obama's EPA rushed harmful &amp; unrealistic fuel economy standards out the door days before leaving presidency. These regs compromise choice, safety, &amp; affordability- raising average price of a car by over $3k. We need realistic standards that don't hurt auto industry or consumers https://t.co/yH7G024Fej
Obama-era ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù is nothing more than a fancy phrase for government-controlled internet. We fully support @AjitPaiFCC. https://t.co/xwHxipPOwD
We need to look at the vulnerabilities in our immigration system and take action to fix them. https://t.co/5JCJ1cSoRa
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should keep the Senate's repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. In TN, health insurance premiums have gone up 176%, and 122,000 people chose to pay the fine because health care is unaffordable. Let's get this off the books. https://t.co/VgKN1jtKou
I hope that @EPAScottPruitt and @SecElaineChao will do what is right and reassess the Obama administration's rushed midnight rule on the national program and the unrealistic and harmful 2025 emissions standards.
Auto manufacturers in my district constantly tell me that we need realistic fuel economy standards, and we need harmonization of standards. If fuel economy policies force auto manufacturers to produce vehicles that customers do not want or cannot afford to buy, no one wins.

We have to use this time as a tipping point to address the overall issue of inappropriate conduct in the workplace--the lack of respect, the diminishment of women, pushing women aside--and end it.
The @washingtonpost reported that The Office of Compliance paid out $17 million for 264 settlements of federal employees to resolve sexual harassment and other claims over a period of two decades. These are taxpayer dollars. I think it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the name ‚Äúnet-neutrality.‚Äù Net-neutrality regulates the internet, and is the opposite of a free and open marketplace. I fully support @AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs decision.  Read my statement here: https://t.co/rkY2hNXrbD
@realdonaldtrump‚Äôs executive order needs to be in place. What you don‚Äôt want to happen is sanctuary cities popping up that are going to be a safe haven or a magnet for more illegal immigration and criminal activity.
What happens if you want to have a sanctuary city for other parts of federal law evasion? Sanctuary cities are a danger to our communities and cities, and a danger to rule of law. I reintroduced the CLEAR Act, which will block funding for sanctuary cities. https://t.co/vBqMn4pxfX
