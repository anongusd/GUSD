Americans should be in charge of their health care decisions and dollars‚Äînot the government or insurers.		Learn more: https://t.co/AQAo7bup30
Instead of putting government bureaucrats in charge of our health care, we should empower the people. 		The Health Care Choices Proposal makes a down payment toward a commitment of reducing health care costs and expanding health care options and innovations.
We also know that government control over health care would require crushing individual tax increases‚Äîonly to be trapped in an inferior system with no option to escape. #MedicareForAll
Other countries with government-run health care have experienced frustrating wait times for basic medical care and sometimes dangerous delays in critical treatments and surgeries.
The national anxiety created by Obamacare‚Äîwhich resulted in massive premium increases, higher health care costs, and fewer coverage options‚Äîwill not be solved by doubling down on government control.
With #MedicareforAll legislation, the Left acknowledges that Obamacare failed‚Äîbut now demands a government takeover of our health care system.
The American people deserve more access to higher-quality, lower-cost health care. We should be able to keep the plans we like and the doctors we trust.		Government-run health care (like #MedicareforAll) does the exact opposite.

Today is an opportunity to take a step toward ending the rampant devaluing of human life.		I commend @senatemajldr for bringing this bill to the Senate floor so that all Americans can see where their senators stand on such a critical, live-saving measure.
A fundamental disrespect for the inherent value of other human beings is the seed that gives birth not only to an acceptance of the killing of innocent children, but also to racism, sexism, ageism, and other bigotries.
Declaring that some human lives are less worthy because of their stage of development is destructive to our civil society and breeds inhumanity toward others, not just toward the unborn.
Sadly, a number of politicians bought and paid for by the abortion lobby have become so radicalized that they will vote today to endorse infanticide.
Opposition to the #BornAliveAct that argues the mantle of ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù is deeply flawed‚Äîbecause the bill applies to children who are already born and outside their mothers‚Äô wombs.
Most people believe that terminating a life after a helpless baby has taken her first breath is inhumane and must never become acceptable law in our land.		Americans who value life expect the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to easily pass the Senate today.

With very limited exceptions, #HR8 would require citizens to pay to obtain services from a for-profit business called a federal firearms licensee prior to transferring any firearm to another person‚Äîfor any reason.
But certain members of Congress have recently taken this general consensus as an opportunity to introduce #HR8‚Äîa poorly constructed bill that would impose significant burdens on law-abiding citizens by mandating ‚Äúuniversal background checks.‚Äù
Federal law reflects this general consensus by barring felons and those with histories of serious mental health problems from legally purchasing or possessing firearms unless their civil rights have been restored.
Very few people disagree with the idea that certain individuals should not be allowed to legally access firearms.

These actions would better deter Russian use of low-yield nuclear weapons and better defend America‚Äôs @NATO allies from Russian cruise missile threats.
While the U.S. should continue to encourage the Russian government to return to compliance with #INFTreaty, in parallel, it should develop and field new low-yield nuclear weapons as well as improved conventional ground-based cruise missile systems and cruise missile defenses.
Russia‚Äôs willful disregard of the treaty, increasing belligerence, and contempt for international law magnifies America‚Äôs urgency to respond to this threat.
Five years of failed attempts to convince Russia to comply with its INF Treaty obligations‚Äîwhile the U.S. has remained in compliance‚Äîis long enough.

Radical feminists concerned that nearly all sex-segregated spaces, colleges, sports, dormitories, and women's rights in general will disappear if ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù becomes a protected class and the dangers this poses to women and girls.
Lesbians who have been punished for having the audacity to say that men are not women.
People who have transitioned, and then detransitioned, concerned with what this ideology will do to children.
Medical experts concerned about how adding "gender identity" into civil rights law would cause physical and psychological harm.
Parents who‚Äôve already experienced grief, despair, and witnessed medical harms as they attempted to get help for their gender-confused children.
Who could be against a law that promises equality and bans discrimination?		A growing number of people across the political spectrum are raising alarm about the so-called #equalityact		Here‚Äôs a short list:

Announcing force reductions without explaining to Americans how the administration plans to follow through on the excellent national security strategy the president laid out to the American people last year represents a significant failure in leadership.
In the case of Afghanistan, U.S. interests include preventing the country from yet again becoming a sanctuary for global terrorism and a source of instability in the region that threatens America‚Äôs strategic partners.
In the case of Syria, while a permanent U.S. footprint in the country is neither practical nor desirable, the administration must explain its actions, demonstrate its plan is suitable, and inform Americans how it protects our interests and serves the larger regional strategy.
An abrupt pullout of U.S. forces in Syria and Afghanistan without adequate preparation could lead to a return of ISIS and the Taliban to power, thus overturning all the hard-won gains made by U.S. and allied forces.
The recent actions on Syria and Afghanistan are disappointing. 		In both cases, the administration failed to adequately explain U.S. policies, how they served America‚Äôs interests, and how they support U.S. regional and national security strategies.

The American people should commend the Departments of Homeland Security and State for achieving a winning deal.
The U.S. and Mexico are broadening cooperation on a range of migration-related issues and earlier this week, Mexico committed an unprecedented level of resources to this effort.
.@ana_r_quintana says: Today‚Äôs announcement is a game-changer for U.S. efforts to counter illegal immigration and address the challenges in Central America.
Simply put, this is good policy by the administration, and Congress should follow its lead in legislating common-sense reforms to our immigration system.
Adjudicating asylum claims in Mexico would help resolve the ‚Äòcatch and release‚Äô dilemma, reduce the deadly human trafficking incentivized under current law, and give our immigration officials more time to fairly and judiciously handle claims.
The policy announced today ‚Äì one very similar to recommendations by The Heritage Foundation ‚Äì is a positive step in the right direction.
.@dr_inserra says: America‚Äôs asylum process should be judicious, fair and efficient‚Äîand offer those who qualify the opportunity to obtain relief from persecution. Unfortunately, the current process is broken, backlogged and bureaucratic, and in desperate need of repair.
Today DHS announced a new agreement with the Mexican government in which the U.S. will return individuals in the country illegally to Mexico while their immigration cases move forward.

Want to dig deeper? Here‚Äôs more detail about the Health Care Choice Proposal: https://t.co/O7SvVyL5Aw
Greater flexibility and resources to the states means that all Americans, even those who are chronically sick, have access to more health plans at better prices.
The plan would convert existing spending‚Äìwhich today goes to insurance companies‚Äìinto a grant that states would use to ensure chronically ill patients have access to the health coverage of their choice.
Ultimately, Congress¬†should support legislation¬†that further empowers states to accomplish this goal. Conservatives have a plan to do just that.¬†The Health Care Choices Proposal¬†calls for Congress to undo Obamacare's damage by letting states innovate.
Instead, Congress should let states review their health insurance regulations and pursue innovative ways to make coverage more affordable and accessible to Americans‚Äîregardless of their income or medical status.
Congress should resist any knee-jerk reactions that prop up a failing health law.	¬†	And they don't need to buy into the false dilemma that only Obamacare allows Americans with pre-existing conditions to get coverage.
This legal verdict is a reminder that Obamacare‚Äôs faulty architecture was created by Washington and we should not expect Washington to make it better.

Interpol rests on the belief ‚Äî or the assumption ‚Äî that its member nations are willing to abide by its rules. 		If a majority of them vote to elect Prokopchuk, that can only prove they do not care about those rules. 		More: https://t.co/xvQ64T5JiN
The only possible explanation for this, if it comes to pass, is that a majority of those nations agree with Russia &amp; China that Interpol is an instrument of power, not law. 		In other words, they accept the abuse of Interpol because they abuse it, or plan to abuse it, themselves.
None of this is in any way secret. 		Russia‚Äôs abuse is no secret. Prokopchuk‚Äôs responsibility for it is no secret. 		And yet, if reports are correct, a majority of the member nations of Interpol ‚Äî acting through its one-nation, one-vote GA ‚Äî believe he is fit to be its President.
He had the clear and acknowledged responsibility under Interpol‚Äôs rules not to abuse its systems. 		But instead of stopping the abuse, he permitted it, facilitated it, and endorsed it. 		The abuse is his responsibility.
Every single abusive act* that Russia has perpetrated through Interpol since June 2011 was sanctioned directly by Prokopchuk.		(*the harassment of William Browder, of Estonian politician Eerik-Niiles Kross, of businessmen Igor Borbot and Alexey Kharis, and much more)
Russia is certainly not the only abusive state in Interpol‚Äîbut it is a major one and Russian abuse is more significant because it has been so blatant, so often repeated, and is so clearly part of the wider and malevolent strategy of the Putin regime.
Tomorrow #Interpol could elect as its President the man most responsible for Russia‚Äôs abuse of the Interpol system.		If you don‚Äôt fully grasp just how perverse that would be, read on üëáüèΩ

... but even in its current form, it offers a way to help Americans suffering under high health costs and fewer choices, a clear alternative to the progressive agenda‚Äîand a serious plan to alleviate the health care anxiety in the country.
That‚Äôs why conservatives created a strong framework on which to build. 		Efforts to refine and improve this proposal can and will continue...
90 leading conservatives have already endorsed the Health Care Choice Proposal as the path forward.		This is a sharp change from 2017, when Congress fell short and failed to unify behind an Obamacare replacement plan. 		Our families cannot afford continued failure.
And they‚Äôre able to do all this without new federal money or micromanagement of the market.
Data show that this proposal builds on a promising emerging trend. 		We found that when states have been given even a little bit of freedom from Obamacare‚Äôs mandates, they‚Äôve been able to lower projected 2019 premiums (by up to 43%) while ensuring the sick retain access to care.
Instead, federal funds would be placed on a budget and sent to states to help people access a quality private coverage arrangement of their choice‚Äîincluding the vulnerable poor and sick.
The proposal also would do away with Obamacare‚Äôs flawed subsidy structure in which insurance companies receive taxpayer subsidies, dollar for dollar, as they raise prices.
Everyone who gets a government subsidy for health care would get new control over those dollars and be able to apply them to a plan of their choice rather than the one a bureaucrat picks for them.
The proposal relies on a fresh framework. Patients would be able to choose the coverage arrangement that works best for them from a wide array of options, including direct primary care, short-term limited duration plans, catastrophic coverage, or ‚Äúgold-plated Cadillac‚Äù coverage.
The Health Care Choice Proposal would make coverage far more affordable‚Äîlowering premiums by up to 32% according to the Center for Health and Economy. 		Moreover, it would ensure that everyone could access a quality, private coverage arrangement of their choice.
Fortunately, conservative policy experts, working together at the national, state, and grassroots levels, have developed just such an alternative.
But politicians need to do more than simply oppose. Instead, they must finally offer a compelling alternative for all Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.
Politicians who reject that approach must also reject half-way measures like ‚Äúpublic options‚Äù and new federal reinsurance programs‚Äîall of which double down on the problems we have today and would expand the government‚Äôs role, driving up costs and reducing choice even further.
Make no mistake: Under these schemes, the government decides what gets covered, who gets what care, and when. 		It would reduce access to care and dramatically increase wait times. In Canada, where health care is government-run, some wait nearly three months to get an MRI.
But new federal government health schemes will not bring better, more affordable care to most Americans. 		Most would lose their current coverage because it would become illegal. Nor could individuals or families purchase coverage outside of the government‚Äôs system.
We can expect repeated efforts to push various forms of a government-run health system over the next two years. 		More than half of the House Democrats have signed onto a bill implementing this vision, as have 16 senators.
Yup, you‚Äôre reading this right: the same cadre that drove up health costs and cut health care choices for 15 million people by breaking the private market now want to do the same thing for the rest of the country.
Regardless, their silence allowed Democrats to retake the rhetorical high ground on health reform. 		Liberals used the opportunity to build the case for replacing Obamacare with even more government-run health care.
... or perhaps it was because there was no consensus on how to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions. 		This gave the left an opening to attack conservatives as wanting to kill people with pre-existing conditions (which is obviously egregiously false).
Despite this dynamic, Republicans ran away from an issue that had been a source of political strength in recent years. 		Perhaps it was because of their failed attempt to repeal Obamacare...
Americans care immensely about health care‚Äîin countless polls the number one issue voters said they want their elected representatives to address is the high cost of health coverage.
Health care is a top concern for many Americans‚Äîand members of Congress must now decide how to move forward. 		Their task: provide a coherent answer to our national anxiety over health care.		Here‚Äôs how they can. üëáüèΩ

Jeff Sessions served his country and @TheJusticeDept with distinction. Although he had a rocky relationship with President Trump, he brought many welcome changes during his tenure, including a renewed emphasis on fighting violent crime, illegal immigration, and the drug epidemic.
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese, who served under President Ronald Reagan, released this statement:
On behalf of The Heritage Foundation, I would like to thank my friend, General Sessions, for his commitment to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution.
During his time at the Department of Justice, he focused on priorities important to the American people, including strengthening our borders, protecting religious liberty and freedom of speech, and improving public safety.
