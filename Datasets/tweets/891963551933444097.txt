These people are very low IQ- their plan is a pie in the sky bunch of crap. They haven‚Äôt thought any of this through. AOC a was offed a spot on climate change committee and turned it down.

Socialism is bad for the common people bc standard of living takes a huge hit, but the ruling class lives like royalty. That‚Äôs why our politicians on the left will push it if they can. https://t.co/lBWo1VdSc9

After seeing what‚Äôs in the Green Monster, it seems that AOC is as clueless as they come. This massive spending package would blow the budget so bad that we‚Äôd never recover.

@FoxNews Ok, Buffett, we like your songs, but your politics suck. You‚Äôre just another liberal elite, unaffected by the socialist agenda you are pushing. The ideology you propose is unsustainable. At some point, our deficit spending is going to make us the next Greece, or worse, Venezuela!
@GabeHoff Yes it‚Äôs necessary. What that woman needed was a little instant karma, but no good conservative would provide it. In America, free speech shouldn‚Äôt invite a liberal nut to splash you with chocolate milk. Keep poking that hornets nest and you‚Äôre gonna get stung! Vote Red! MAGA!

@BrennaSimonSays @conservmillen @arabbitorduck Not sure what you are defending, but abortion, not contraception, is the crux of the left‚Äôs obsession with Roe v. Wade.

We have the house, senate and presidency, yet we roll over to whatever nefarious and painfully transparent demand they make. No reason to feel guilty about driving the agenda our party elected you people to enact. Get a pair!
@seungminkim @benshapiro What a sham. As if 30+ year old undocumented allegations can be investigated and actually yield any useful conclusions. When will republicans stand up to the gangsters on the left who seem to own them? Get a pair, guys!
@kcchiefsfan1982 @jessesingal Patsy 2.0!
@StefanieAKR @TyMitch9 @CalebJHull Flake? Yes he is. This lame duck senator is flexing his muscles for the libs. He folded today when confronted by a former female ACORN operative who is funded by Soros, under the guise of bipartisanship. The dems  NEVER compromise! Rhinos are their dupes! Grow some balls, guys!
@headphonetheif @TheJeffBurkett @CalebJHull I think your side is itching for conflict. Antifa? Just a symptom of your sickness. I just want freedom, and liberty!
@JimSCook @sahilkapur You don‚Äôt want any disagreement with your socialist agenda, do you?
@JimSCook @sahilkapur Block me asshole
@JJTurnUpdaMusic @sahilkapur I can guarantee you- if the dems could have done the same, they would have. You think they have played nice and been ethical?
@HD_RG13 @washingtonpost Like you are a qualified arbiter of that
@MichelLauzon @washingtonpost The test was a joke, and we still don‚Äôt know who paid for it.
@heavensentjo @washingtonpost Yes, he‚Äôs very partition. He will be upholding our constitution, which libs can‚Äôt be trusted to do. They want to rewrite it to meet their current needs. They want to be socialists, redistribute like Venezuela, and ruin our system.
@Trelexus @washingtonpost Clinton, a seasoned liar is cool as a cucumber. Lies roll off her tongue like the truth.
@Statistar30 @CalebJHull You can thank her democrats for that. The underhanded way they handled the allegation.
@headphonetheif @TheJeffBurkett @CalebJHull You are the sociopaths.
@TennesseeMAGA1 @CalebJHull Doxxed = Betrayed private documentation.
@TyMitch9 @CalebJHull Survivor? You have info the rest of us don‚Äôt? You were not listening when nobody corroborated her story. I feel sorry for Ford, as something happened to her, but I don‚Äôt see how any reasonable person can conclude that Kavanaugh has guilt.
@Solaire17674798 @CalebJHull Dem tantrum. They see socialism and abortion slipping away.
@CalebJHull Libs are filth, and the scumbag deep staters did this. Fire the filth! We go low and you go high? Hah! You people couldn‚Äôt get much lower.
@edsohn80 @ezraklein Scum
@Mont_Jiang @ezraklein Only difference is the Bill Clinton really is a sexual predator. Why don‚Äôt you nuts believe his accusers?
@CryptoPopsicle @ezraklein What facts? It‚Äôs all allegation and reconstructed memory. No evidence EXCEPT against the allegations.
@LPFF1 @ezraklein You mean Kavanaugh is not letting them talk over him or put words in his mouth. If the dems wanted the FBI to investigate, why did they wait for weeks, instead of making a request themselves? They tried to get Kavanaugh to ask for an investigation. Underhanded, despicable scum!
@SilvinhaChicago @ezraklein I think Blumenthal is a worthless, lying piece of crap. He‚Äôs representative of what‚Äôs wrong with the senate.
@sarcastamy @VWanjikuN @ezraklein @KamalaHarris Harris is smart but just another twisted lib. Freedom for me.
@jaketapper @benshapiro As right he should
RT @RealCandaceO: Kavanaugh has me on the brink of tears. 		The determination of this hearing is so much bigger than people realize. 		This‚Ä¶
RT @benshapiro: Ford believes Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Kavanaugh believes he didn't. Only one has any corroborating evidence for t‚Ä¶
@FoxNews @SenBlumenthal Yeah, President Trump has loads of confidence in the FBI and their ability to conduct an impartial investigation. Drain the swamp! MAGA!
@JaguarNut33 @RealCandaceO Just a bunch of abortion crazed libs piling on.
@glangendorf01 @RealCandaceO Where is your evidence? There was none, or Justice Thomas might still be incarcerated.
@irishlass423 @RealCandaceO @RedWavePaige Nobody punished as a result of the lies of tawanna and sharpton. Sharpton achieved credibility with left as a result.
@OfficialDHam @NickieRhoads @RealCandaceO Unless the libs have their way, we are a country with a constitution and laws governing  both our behavior, and the process by which crimes are adjudicated. Now, we are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Hopefully, the sanity of conservatives will trump the impulses of libs.

@SimonBooks A pile of his own self-concocted bull crap!
@FAIRImmigration @MarketWatch I‚Äôll believe that when I see the illegals paying taxes. I can‚Äôt hire illegals and then write off the cost b/c none of them have taxpayer IDs. Yes, they contribute to our economy, but the bulk of what they earn is sent back to Central America, without a dime in income tax paid.
@StruxMel @seanmdav @dbongino What is most striking to me about this is that it‚Äôs primarily about abortion, and the libs desire to protect Roe v. Wade, and continue to use abortion as a form of birth control, instead of the much simpler and more moral use of easily available pills, condoms, abstinence, etc.
@jaxresister @realDonaldTrump Unfounded bullshit as imagined by Bob Woodward.
@JRMichigan2017 @realDonaldTrump You have no sense
@real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump You and your ilk are the lawbreakers. Liberals have no ethical boundaries when it comes to their agenda. Lie, cheat, steal, misrepresent, bribe, whatever it takes to achieve their ends. The party that fought efforts to end slavery projects their depravity onto those who ended it.
@SATIRE_SEVS_DFS @realDonaldTrump Hey, guess what? Democrats have run Flint, MI for a long, long time.
@CayBorduin1 @GacilosMariz @JCNSeverino The dirt comes mostly from you lefties.
@realDonaldTrump Here‚Äôs an approach- why don‚Äôt you read the unredacted docs, and black out anything you feel will jeopardize our allies and our own personnel and methods. Then we can all see the lies behind the fisa warrants.
@stormyvixxen @realDonaldTrump Clinton, Kerry, and Obama are the ones who sold out our country.
@GEMevent @RealJamesWoods I watched those idiots pretending they couldn‚Äôt stand up to the wind as Flo came ashore, thinking about how poor their performances were, then I saw Anderson Cooper standing in a ditch in Houston, trying to spectacularize the moment, and later trying to rationalize. Fake!
@freeme0215 @RealJamesWoods James Woods is a patriot!
@iskandrah @RealJamesWoods Nobody is quaking in their boots. Most reasonable citizens are simply incredulous at the depths to which this vile old woman will sink, and surprised that the left approves, you included. She is a crooked career politician. Way past time for term limits!

@gordon_hughes2 @kennethrpreston @kharyp Typical lib trying to lay democrat bs on the conservatives.

@KJEdwards21 @RealCandaceO @sarahjeong The count went from less than 20 to 3000? Sounds like a liberal invention to me.
@TD_BEELZEBOSS @girlpowervoter @HillaryClinton She might be more presidential, but that‚Äôs where it ends. She‚Äôs a smooth snake of a politician, and would drag us further left. We don‚Äôt want to make the rapid transformation that Venezuela has, from prince to pauper. Capitalism works!
@sprizz324 @HillaryClinton Sure, justify!
@MNP_34 @HillaryClinton She is the ‚Äúout‚Äù President.
@girlpowervoter @HillaryClinton What is wrong with you delusional libs? Madame President? Let me remind you- she is a loser.
@moviegoerlib @HillaryClinton Nope. She‚Äôs totally fake and corrupt. Totally undeserving of any kind of praise. Thinks, and acts, only on her own behalf , and always has.

@willyslyfe @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO What do those three have in common? All multi millionaires!  They can live however they want, but some of us depend on a robust economy to give us the economic freedom to live the way we choose. Democrats can‚Äôt provide that.
@cap54 @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO It‚Äôs not about brains, pal, it‚Äôs about the socialist leanings of your party. The rest of us don‚Äôt want to wind up like Venezuela, Cuba, and myriad other socialist countries taken over by authoritarian administrations and ruled by force. Constitutional Freedom for all!
@wisdomspeak_ @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO Absolutely right! I‚Äôm not hearing much from our leaders about their efforts to make clear to conservatives how important their midterm vote is. C‚Äômon Republican brass, lets get organized and outdo the dems at their own game! Got to get out and vote!

@972_834 @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @POTUS @PutinRF_Eng We don‚Äôt care what he did- we wanted change after 8 yrs of divisive, lying, liberal Obama, preceded by many years of elected officials not keeping their promises.

@AmericansVoice2 @realDonaldTrump Even if we don‚Äôt agree with them, they are free to express themselves. The majority of us are at odds with this small fringe group, and the Prez did not arrange their demonstration, nor fund them, unlike what the dems do with antifa.
@TSnowflake45 @realDonaldTrump Typical leftist vulgarity. Can you express yourself without speaking like a pig?
@chemosh933 @JackPosobiec @JacobAWohl Because antics ARE the fascists!
@JackieVhmedic @realDonaldTrump The democrats have gone to extraordinary lengths to block and disrupt the Trump agenda, turning a blind eye to every sort of underhanded activity and uncivil behavior. Our side did not do same to Obama, until we saw how he had deceived us. Had hope for keeping promise to unite us

@MonsterInTheWH @DanScavino Yup- time for mueller to show some results after all this time and money spent. Trump is right- witch hunt!
@CathyFo58142999 @realDonaldTrump He hates the slanted media, of which Bezos is a part.
@NihonSaram @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Sour grapes, crybaby. It‚Äôs the Democrats who don‚Äôt want accountability in our elections, because they have so many fraudulent votes.
@ThatGrasshopper @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Why worry about paper ballots when you‚Äôre not worried about who is voting? How about government issued voter ID cards to go with your paper ballots? No takers on your side, eh?
@ReeceTheButcher @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Nobody needs to hack anything to best you wacko socialists in an election. The real Americans spoke in 2016, and Trump beat Hillary in accordance with the law. If you were truly Democratic, you‚Äôd accept the result, like we did with Obama, whom we had hoped was a man of his word.
@jim_oregon @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump @SenJeffMerkley You people are crazy!
@kerit71 @realDonaldTrump Do your homework, dumbass. We have been subsidizing the USPS for years. They have lost billions for many years. Let Bezos deliver his own packages.
@feathertail1 @realDonaldTrump USPS has been unprofitable for years, just like many government run businesses. Privatize them so they will be run like businesses. Let‚Äôs cut government down to size!
@N_AmerSolutions @realDonaldTrump @USPS More profitable at whose expense? Bezos needs my money? So he can continue to propagandize through WAPO?
@CathyFo58142999 @realDonaldTrump Of course- so why not let those of us who pay taxes subsidize shipping for Amazon, so that Bezos can become even more wealthy. If the USPS is obsolete, maybe it should be phased out and replaced by a more contemporary and useful organization.
@dikell3 @JackPosobiec @joesbooks So carter page is dirty- why has the entire Trump presidency, to this point, been clouded by this BS? Now Mueller wants to grant immunity. This is an investigation in search of a crime!

@June_Draws @kungfuspam @WhiteHouse Check out the Chicago Trib article of August 21, 2017, by Stephen Moore- Trumps Real Record. Trump has done more to uplift blacks than Obama. Black income actually fell under Obama. Trump has lowered black unemployment, and is trying to give blacks a leg up with school vouchers.
@kungfuspam @WhiteHouse Wait, wasn‚Äôt it 90% black people in the last admin? Why is that not ok? You sound a bit racist on this.
@mackslenoo @WhiteHouse Maybe the police and fbi could have stepped up and done their job to prevent that to which you are referring. There are always going to be murderous wackos, and if they don‚Äôt have guns, they will use knives, rocks, trucks, poison, or whatever else they have at hand.
@CarlGore @SoitenlyBob @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump But. It as ineffective as the last administration
@ilovetervurens @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump When you can spell
@olivia_i_i @WhiteHouse If this is so hard for you, why are you looking at it? Go watch some Obama admin highlight reels.
@RonWolfe57 @RyanAFournier @WhiteHouse What alternate universe have you been living in? The Obama crowd are as corrupt as they get. Can‚Äôt wait until justice is served on all of that crowd, and believe me, it‚Äôs coming!
@EspinalGeorge @WhiteHouse He has addressed many more important issues than Obama.
@threejuniormnts @WhiteHouse White is bad, right, snowflake?
@gbwags @WhiteHouse Yeah, that‚Äôs real important. JFK, Clinton, Edwards, and many others on the left have committed their own and indiscretions, while in office. Trump‚Äôs was many years ago while a private citizen, and what he did was consensual, unlike the rapist Clinton.
@Afh65Andy @WhiteHouse Sure, Trump is responsible for Israel having to defend its border against a Hamas incursion.
@timclamm @WhiteHouse @POTUS What a joke! After the totally corrupt Obama admin continually lied to us, denied constitutional rights, and covered up their crimes, you can‚Äôt be serious.
@sohren43 @WhiteHouse You lefties are the fascists, doing your best to stifle free speech and a free press.
@memario28 @WhiteHouse @POTUS There was no serious pursuit of truth in Benghazi and Clinton email dump. Special Prosecutors never assigned. Comey judged it himself. Total coverup by Obama Admin. The Establishment doesn‚Äôt like it when an outsider makes them look ineffective and corrupt.
@20Fathoms @WhiteHouse Oh, like Obama did? Never felt less represented or embarrassed than when Obama was in office.
@art_bosch @WhiteHouse @POTUS From the guy who dreamed up having his chopper taking rounds. You have to be kidding.

@Miminorton9 @RevMarkF @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Whose cash was on those pallets?
@tamisaint13 @WhiteHouse @POTUS What a great deal- give Iran access to over 100 billion dollars, so they can spread terror around the ME, in return for almost nothing. Who makes a deal that is unverifiable with people who continue to say ‚ÄúDeath to America ‚Äú, and continue to hold our people hostage? Nobel? Hah!
@Truth_Seeker59 @BarackObama @robreiner @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Do what I said. Obama is history. I had hope for him, but he was a horrible, divisive president who operated outside of our laws. Good riddance! Trump is definitely flawed, but he has America‚Äôs best interests in mind and will be a better prez than Barry .

@Truth_Seeker59 @BarackObama @robreiner @JoeBiden You three should buy some land and start a country.
@EdKrassen @BarackObama History will remember Obama as our worst and most divisive president
@nylitgirl @BarackObama Like I care what you think
@BlueRev0luti0n @BarackObama It was a very bad deal for everyone except Iran
@nylitgirl @BarackObama Amazingly egotistic, and just as ill informed.
@BarackObama PS: Why no hostage return, and what‚Äôs with the pallets of cash? My guess is you were trying to earn that Nobel that they gave you on the come. Your deal has increased destabilization in the Middle East. Iran can now afford to meddle everywhere. Death to America is their mantra!
@BarackObama If you had forged a deal that was in the best interest of the world, one which included verification and at will inspections of every inch of Iran, maybe your deal could stand. Why give Iran access to over one hundred billion dollars, no strings, if you are concerned about war?
@uptownterri @WhiteHouse Yes- one republican and a cadre of Democrat councilmen, etc.
@uptownterri @WhiteHouse Tell your Democratic officials! They are wasting your tax dollars.

@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Race baiter. No racism in our side- it‚Äôs you clowns stirring up the hate.
@Pita_Pea @vickieslade @JulesNZ26 @realDonaldTrump Correct. I was referring to ruining our healthcare when blaming obama.
@Pita_Pea @vickieslade @JulesNZ26 @realDonaldTrump I wasn‚Äôt referring only to the left- both parties are living in la- la land when it comes to responsible spending. Out of control spending by big government must stop or it will contribute to our eventual downfall.
@TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump That sounds like a great reason to close a school. No police up there to investigate and tell them to go away? What about the high school terrorists who are trying to usurp our constitutional rights because the local sheriff and the fbi failed to act on information about shooter?
@vickieslade @KarenW0727 @Pita_Pea @JulesNZ26 @realDonaldTrump You just have not considered everything.
@Pita_Pea @vickieslade @JulesNZ26 @realDonaldTrump Thank obama for out of control medical costs. Conservatives are happy to help those who can‚Äôt help themselves, we just don‚Äôt think a welfare state works, especially long term. We need a balanced budget, no more deficit spending.
@Lkmfday789 @WhiteHouse Thank your liberal buddy Jeff Bezos!
@TruxTrains @WhiteHouse You can thank obama for your healthcare problems.
@JordanBrandes @WhiteHouse Robert Johnson, founder of BET, spoke recently, telling the black community that something is going right for them under Trump. Historically low black unemployment coupled with a narrowing of the income gap between blacks and whites is an improvement over Democrat welfare. Think!
@WorldAndScience Maybe the Deathstar looks like Mimas!
@TeryeA @realDonaldTrump @nonagrandma1374 When obama was elected, I prayed that he would unite the US as he promised. Did nothing to oppose him. Instead, he did the opposite and completely divided us. Worse, his foreign policy was lunacy- he gave away the ranch, and denigrated the US to the world. Worst Pres. EVER!
@TeryeA @realDonaldTrump And he will never make idiotic policy decisions like Obama did. He won‚Äôt give a hundred billion to our avowed enemies who want us dead. He won‚Äôt give away the farm on climate issues. He won‚Äôt draw a red line in the sand and then wimp out when it‚Äôs crossed. Thank god for Trump!
@WhySoitenly @realDonaldTrump That ought to tell you what your opinion is worth.
@MrsAmerica1776 @TheRealMrAleem @VP You have lost your mind, snowflake.
@TheRealMrAleem @VP ... conduct by the democrats and their leftist followers!
@DanteBanducci @VP We are preventing Assad from carrying out a purge of his people, you ignoramus. Your wimp obama threatened the same thing, but his balls were not up to the job. It sounded good to him, until the chips were down.
@DBDxTheUx @VP Your punctuation sucks, too, Snowflake!!!
@DrMalone @jimmykimmel @rsmale @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @RobertMuellerr Kimmel is a weaselly little dirtbag, look at his past. He‚Äôs no better than trump in his treatment of women. The Man Show! Infantile sexist garbage.
@DrMalone @jimmykimmel @rsmale @seanhannity You‚Äôre telling your delusional version of the truth. You can‚Äôt help that you drank the koolaid.
@deecee3737 @BarackObama I‚Äôm neither looking for or encouraging followers, a hole. I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs approval regarding my politics. I could care less who you are or how many follow you on Twitter. You probably won‚Äôt remember why you‚Äôre a socialist if you succeed in getting your way.
@oddmanout @realDonaldTrump And you‚Äôre so smart- dying to become socialist. You people are total morons. Thank God for Trump- without him, we‚Äôd be listening to whining from Hillary, while she screwed things up even more than obama.
@ClenchedFisk @realDonaldTrump Obama knew what he was doing. He was destroying our country. He did nothing but screw up every pact and deal he made. He hates the US. We had hope for him, but we‚Äôre glad he‚Äôs gone now that we‚Äôve seen what he could do.
@Clark408 @realDonaldTrump Investigation by the crooked fbi, who used a phony dossier and incomplete info regarding its source and purchasers to enable their investigation. Get a life libs and busy yourselves trying to find a candidate you can elect to replace him.
@mgilpatrick @realDonaldTrump Like the stock market did anything good while obama was at the helm.
@mermaidproperty @rgblight @realDonaldTrump You eat meat? It‚Äôs cultural. Accept it.
@eagles_tess @KathleenPenny9 @JoPiarulli @realDonaldTrump Asshole
@cliffgallegos @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs working for those who elected him. You want Hillary in there?
@NatalieTweetsRE @foldberg1 @ChaMamasHouse @realDonaldTrump And the three clowns who preceded Trump did what? They bent over and let china steal US intellectual property and restrict our imports to China, creating a huge trade deficit. Trump is trying to improve the situation- give him a break, and don‚Äôt pass judgement before the outcome.
@SulzyckiRhea @jimmykimmel @seanhannity BTW- you‚Äôre a nobody!
@SulzyckiRhea @jimmykimmel @seanhannity Everything you libs do is a dirty job. Get yourselves out of the gutters.
@rholynsix @jimmykimmel @seanhannity The Democrat way- hit ‚Äòem below the belt, do whatever it takes to get your way. The hell with ethics!
@aintwesomething @jimmykimmel @seanhannity Is that you, Joe Biden? Always want to get physical, instead if solving things by using your brain.
@DrMalone @jimmykimmel @rsmale @seanhannity You‚Äôre projecting again, asshole!
@bobbygmccurry @jimmykimmel @seanhannity I‚Äôm getting a lot more sleep since these clowns took over for Johnny Carson!
@ImmoralGOP @IStand007 @lynn1219 @buffwon @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @Disney We gave obama his shot, without whining about the election result. I truly had hope that obama planned to unite us, as he promised. It soon became obvious that was never his intention. We were very gracious to the Obama‚Äôs, and gave them plenty of time to perform as promised.
@KAYLEEBURRIS @billjr_shaffer @Learning2GetBy @realDonaldTrump @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer Trump is definitely the solution to the mess obama left behind. Tore the Middle East apart and then ignored it as it descended into chaos, made some ridiculous agreements on environment and nukes divided the USA, blew up our deficit, and more. Trump is the remedy! Maybe too late!
@Inkatt @stephenpeters2 @realDonaldTrump @amazon You, are a little whacked, too. Your wife may be making cake, but it‚Äôs at the expense of us taxpayers!
@stephenpeters2 @realDonaldTrump @amazon Yeah, right- we need Amazon to help bankrupt USPS!
@realDonaldTrump In addition to taking advantage of the rest of us, Bezos warps reality through WAPO. Time to levy some taxes on Dr. Evil!
@niceaccount96 @Natersh13 @paulaplain @TheJordanRachel @realDonaldTrump I get paid by living in freedom, you silly lib. Not interested in your big government taking away my constitutional freedoms and buying votes with free stuff.
@deecee3737 @BarackObama I never asked anyone to follow me, and, unlike you, I don‚Äôt measure my worth by how many I have. I feel sorry for you, man. You are twisted.
@deecee3737 @BarackObama Such an open mind- what a reasonable free thinker you are, snowflake. Its people like you that are the problem. You mean nothing to me- thank god I didn‚Äôt see your photo!
@deecee3737 @BarackObama Bullshit!
@KayeLinda @BarackObama Inclusion, diversity, and intelligence are fine, provided we don‚Äôt become a socialist country by continuing to expand the welfare state. Help those who truly need help, but insist on productivity from the able. Our country was founded on self sufficiency, not big government.
@PetersIsaiah @Alpha_Lady1 @krassenstein @BarackObama You can win, unless you are unprepared. Most of the military will not bend to dictators.
@Alpha_Lady1 @PetersIsaiah @krassenstein @BarackObama The progressives have no respect for the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution. Those deep thinkers anticipated the challenges that we would face, and created checks and balances to deal with them. Sad, but they did not anticipate career politicians. Term limits needed!

@Qristine @realDonaldTrump Stupid snowflake.
@trump51_50 @politico @FLOTUS You‚Äôre referring to the Clintons and Obama‚Äôs, correct? They hold the records for fleecing the American public!
@kinsonian @politico @FLOTUS Can‚Äôt write a sentence without profanity, eh genius?
@WattersonVickie @politico Agreed! All the libs are wise ass bullies, but without a double standard, they‚Äôd have no standards at all. Bunch of socialist crybabies.
@Growsbeak @weaver_victweav @edwardbrowden @politico Like I said- you‚Äôre a hater. Dickhead!
@Growsbeak @edwardbrowden @politico Dickhead!
@trump51_50 @politico @FLOTUS Yeah, all that and community organizing, divisiveness and some really bad agreements, policies, lies, and lawlessness. Ahhh, the gold old days. Glad they‚Äôre gone!
@liberalchik @realDonaldTrump Yeah- we had a country controlled by a liberal minority, who used every dirty trick in the book to further their cause. Their dream of an unreachable utopia was the goal. Take a look at the mess that was once a thriving Venezuela. People are pouring over their borders to escape!
@Aurum420 @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryRoss @POTUS @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Too much dead time on your hands, Snowflake. Get a job!

@momul1 @Sister10084763 @DennisG58878004 @MichalDouglas9 @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @WhiteHouse Just your corrupt mainstream media making you think you‚Äôre a majority!
@momul1 @Sister10084763 @DennisG58878004 @MichalDouglas9 @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @WhiteHouse Wrong! Take a lots less time to ship out the insane lib minority. We are a majority!
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt kid yourself. The definition is: One who dreams of utopia but is so lacking in intelligence, does not realize that there is no such thing. We must all work at some pursuit to provide for our own needs.                    I‚Äôd be thrilled if utopia was reachable.
@milleronia @realDonaldTrump Keep dreaming
@Likes_Legos @asomer @1234periwinkle @Adorable_Todd @realDonaldTrump Your dem buddies are far more corrupt and free spending with our tax dollars. Ruining low income communities by addicting them to ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù while running up unsustainable debt.

@gigglechick @realDonaldTrump Giggling dipshit!
@SuperCdn @realDonaldTrump He MADE China intervene! You people are wacko!
@DarthShelbert @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who supported the cream puff Obama. Here, let me give Iran, who is holding US citizens, 100 billion plus, for absolutely nothing, so they can continue to spread terror across the world. Stated goal: Death to America!	Moron. Hater.
@DonovanColleen @realDonaldTrump Sick libs with NO AMMO!
@TomWellborn @ericharding @realDonaldTrump @ClintonFdn You libs are sick pups- grasping at straws! Take enough photos with a motorized shutter and you find frames like that one. It would be nice if you had anything of real substance on Trump. So he had an affair. At least it was consensual. Bill Clinton, JFK,  and more!
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump If you had any reasonable degree of intelligence, you‚Äôd understand that what we believe in is freedom, and prefer govt. to be minimal, not involved in every facet of our lives. Your ‚Äúeeeew‚Äù says a lot about your level of intelligence!
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump Says one from the party of slavery. Conservatives ended slavery, I might remind you, Snowflake. No racism or homophobia here. I believe we should assist all truly in need of assistance. Also believe the welfare state oppresses minorities, and keeps them beholden to govt.
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I‚Äôm not trolling anyone. Barry. I call it discourse- the civil exchange of ideas between rational individuals.  I simply responded to your tweet. Hey, check out section A of WAPO, Sunday, March 4. Article on the exodus from Venezuela. A real crisis.
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse People have to take at least some responsibility for their own needs and wants, or societies will become anarchies. Life requires some unavoidable work. Utopia is a fantasy.
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Our economy still functions despite political graft and excessive entitlements, but, at some point, there will be a backlash. Nice thought, take care of everybody, but look at the unsustainable deficit, even now. Your way doesn‚Äôt work, long term. History shows this, if you look.
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Yes, I think that‚Äôs a bad thing. Take a look at socialist countries, snowflake. We are not ants or bees.  With no reward for hard work, productivity will drop dramatically under socialism, making your utopia unreachable. Just look south to Venezuela- starving- eating zoo animals!
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse And you are a high minded aristocratic tool of the socialists, just too damn dumb to realize it!
@barryonash @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Ok, pal, justify the Oakland mayor blowing the whistle on ICE raids to arrest criminal MS13 members. Your kind use violence to accomplish your agenda, so I guess you feel an affinity with the criminal alien thugs, eh?
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump Can‚Äôt avoid the biased MSM- their propaganda is everywhere. We know what‚Äôs going on, just support the conservative view. You denigrate Trump b/c you‚Äôre a hater (attack appearance) and intolerant of opposing viewpoints. God save us from your socialist utopia. Let Freedom ring!
@nyc_oz @realDonaldTrump Great. You go ahead and storm the ramparts, snowflake.
@Khanoisseur @realDonaldTrump They did it for their own benefit, not to do us a favor.
@ZAdomavicius @clw4usa @realDonaldTrump Those car plants aren‚Äôt here because the foreign car makers like us- it‚Äôs because they make more money that way.
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre going to be the surprised one, Snowflake! You think you and your ilk are a majority. Hah! Just wait til the midterm elections.
Sheriff Scot Israel, should be ashamed. Bragged about lowering the crime rate, when in reality, the statistics were skewed by his (and Obama‚Äôs) policy of reducing arrests of minorities. Skin color should have no influence on holding people accountable for their misdeeds!
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump The propaganda comes from your side.
@PatriciaC221 @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not me that‚Äôs being conned. I prefer freedom to what libs are pushing. Hopefully we‚Äôll never wind up like Venezuela, but remember this exchange if we do.

You obviously are not affected by the criminals or you‚Äôd agree.
@alt_fda @VP @POTUS What a joke. You clowns want to protect criminal aliens- these people entered our country unlawfully.  Most of them are people just trying to improve their lives. Those working, following our laws and paying taxes should be left alone, but for cities, counties, and states to....
@TrumpTROLLER007 @VP @POTUS The real a-hole is you, Snowflake. We gave obama his chance even though he wasn‚Äôt our choice. He screwed things up royally. Give trump a chance to do his thing. Or.... you can spend your next four years resisting, with zero results.
@boss420lady @Jackneworth @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got, Snowflake? Focus on something less superficial and more important. I‚Äôll bet I could easily poke fun at some of your physical attributes, just like you could mine. Grow up, get a life!

@th3Shad0wKn0w @realDonaldTrump You mean that her fraudulent voters were ineffective? She still got loads of votes from the usual democrat tactic of bussing illegals from poll to poll, and dead voters. Dems don‚Äôt want to secure the polls because they count on fraudulent votes for their success.

@choctawridge1 @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiffCA @tedcruz @SenBobCorker @JebBush @marcorubio Liberal bullies. You resort to childish personal attacks.

@mwestly222 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse That was generations ago. Why don‚Äôt you and Bernie move somewhere and start a commune? Oh, wait, he can‚Äôt leave when his crooked wife is in prison.

@ASRichards75 @dsgerstel @Greendeco @MarkAndy5 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse @POTUS Typical vulgar lib response.

Let‚Äôs have term limits!
@starbouche @realDonaldTrump Whacko liberal. Hillary got more votes on the left coast because Californians have created an unsustainable welfare state, and hooked their population on a free ride.

RT @SagaciousLawyer: @realDonaldTrump Like and Retweet if you believe Donald J. Trump is an AMAZING &amp; INCREDIBLE President! #MAGA
@Jahmai11 @realDonaldTrump You won‚Äôt see Jesus with a weapon in his hands, except in a Democrat depiction of reality.
@GeorgeAFuller @realDonaldTrump Idiots! All of you libs.
@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump The Dems need to step up- little crybabies can‚Äôt accept the election. The won‚Äôt get something for nothing from Trump, who set clear conditions for a deal. Guess the thought he was a sucker. Sorry!
@ArgentinaMama @realDonaldTrump He left it to the legislative branch, whose responsibility it is to make laws. Obama is the one who overstepped his authority and created DACA through executive order. Time to change our laws if we are not going to enforce them. Wake up whiners!
@Nathancmanning @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs just trying to make a deal that will solve our immigration problem, once, and for all. Not just another amnesty.
@9Gweedo @DebbyPepWatson @HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump No border security, no DACA deal. This is not a new condition.
@DebbyPepWatson @HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump And the democrats, fbi and justice are the mafia.
@mrshahtstuff @bubble_1011 @MrMokelly @JamesMc30559324 @realDonaldTrump @JTaylor_1956 But then we are faced with  the flow of illegal aliens, illegal drugs, and other contraband continuing unchecked. People are dying as a result, and it needs to stop. We need to know who and what is entering our country. Why have a country if you‚Äôre not going control the border?
@Kaepernick7 @Usher Congratulations, Mr. Kaepernick. I think you are onto something- decisive action to tackle social problems can really make a difference. This is the way to make change, unlike showing disrespect during our national anthem. Keep up the good work!
@bluskysea @LCVoters He has been under investigation for nearly a year, and Mueller has found nothing of substance. Stop obstructing our President.
@CooperJ1099 @dcrosby818 @cbassols @EdwinShaffer7 @LCVoters Bill and Hillary have a lot to hide, but they have their foundation to obscure the fact that it enriches them and their friends.
@JudyBoyles1 @BRuehmer @LCVoters Obviously this woman is suffering delusions. Hold on to your seat as your dreams are denied, or worse.
@HuffPostPol It‚Äôs so helpful to have you anticipate a bad outcome. You‚Äôre supposed to report the news, not editorialize. You are everything that is wrong with the MSM!
@RepTimWalz Like obama ramming things down my throat was normal.
@SenatorHassan You mean kill her fetus instead of using some effective form of birth control to avoid pregnancy in the first place? Don‚Äôt we have laws governing the killing of humans?
@EricHolder Right, Eric. And Loretta Lynch had a nice conversation about grandchildren on the tarmac with Slick Willy.
@THELanceLenzi Your tweets are worthless bs- like I said, keep making up ‚Äúfacts‚Äù to support your indefensible arguments. Stick with fashion.
RT @FrankNoto3: @tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin Google the Sagimahara stabbings. 19 dead, douchebag, and‚Ä¶
@SFJAZZER @realDonaldTrump Because of the law, doofus
@DonaCastilloMcI Bet youre missing a tooth like that jackass in your video.
@tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin Google the Sagimahara stabbings. 19 dead, douchebag, and there have been other fatal school stabbing there in Japan. Get your facts straight instead of just spewing bullshit propaganda, comrade. Make up lies to support the story in that little brain of yours.
@THELanceLenzi Unfortunately, for you, your mouth is much bigger than your brain.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump Accuse- that‚Äôs a Democrat tactic.
@DonaCastilloMcI Banging your head like that has affected your brain function.
@DivaSigne @Felicia1669 @ummmno21 @realBigBalls @realDonaldTrump Fasten your seatbelt and get ready for the ride
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump Who is doing the dividing? The Divider in Chief, Barack Obama, and his minions.
@JaceLovesBooty @RealEagleBites @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin I‚Äôm not crazy about his ego, but he beats the hell out of obama
@THELanceLenzi All BS from you and your kind.
@THELanceLenzi Fasten your seatbelt for a few more years of government for the people, and keep your vitriol to yourself, clown.
@VicOfBunswick @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin Hard to defend yourself from big government tyranny and the kind of dirty dealing practiced by obama and his ilk without guns.
@SenFeinstein @CecileRichards Access to what? Abortion?
@JoaquinCastrotx @NPR @NPRinskeep @MorningEdition @realDonaldTrump Save your breath, lib.
@half_ass_hippy @bew1006 @RittNancy @Trace88529604 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Kept resisting, and keep refusing to accept reality, man. That‚Äôll help.
@half_ass_hippy @bew1006 @RittNancy @Trace88529604 @WhiteHouse @POTUS You‚Äôre not half ass- you‚Äôre a complete ass. One of the problems is that half the people out away from San Juan are squatters who don‚Äôt even own the land they have commandeered. The other half have illegal connections to the power grid, and have been stealing power for decades.
@RittNancy @Trace88529604 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Perhaps they should get their corrupt butts in gear, and put their island back together.
@tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin But when there are no guns, they will use knives.
@tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin My point is that it‚Äôs not the gun that‚Äôs responsible for death- it‚Äôs the maniac using it. If guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns.
@tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin You make no sense, man. What about the numerous truck attacks that killed many? What about the terrorists with box cutters, who crashed planes into buildings? I can name many more violent attacks that resulted in mass death that did not involve guns. All it takes is a crazy man.
@MichaelSinger48 @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin It‚Äôs a murderer problem, not a gun problem.
@mulberryjane @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin More liberal stupidity. What law would prevent what happened?
@JaceLovesBooty @RealEagleBites @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin Riiight! Better to have Obama‚Äôs failed policies and idiotic agreements, as well as all of the democrats stealing from the people. They live like royalty while telling us we need to get used to a lower standard.
@tgilbert_13 @BigPuno @TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin How many laws are you going to need to prevent killings? There are many ways to end a human life, and someone intent on murder will find a way.
@TBPInvictus @realDonaldTrump @GovMattBevin The NRA defends our constitutional right to own guns. A person is responsible for the killings in Kentucky, not a gun. Had a gun been unavailable, the person would have used other means to accomplish his misdeeds.
@imsofull @betsyamc @afghanvet @VP @POTUS Non-residents serving in the military? I smell something fishy.
@THELanceLenzi Trump lies less than Hillary and Obama. Trump is also less of a liar than you, you hysterical liberal. You don‚Äôt know what a nazi is, apparently. It‚Äôs hard to take you seriously when you can‚Äôt correctly use punctuation and grammar.
@THELanceLenzi Talk about drinking the koolaid- you‚Äôve completely fallen for the bs the liberal dems push.
@SethAbramson No, but we have a big indication of his bias and his plotting with his mistress to get Trump. Not enough sense to keep his biases private and separate from his work. No place for that in our system. The truth will out!
@SethAbramson Keep dreaming, snowflake.
@LuvMalibuBarbie @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump A more experienced politician would just give us more of the same. I disagree with your side, but have felt unrepresented by my side for a long time. Too much inacation and too much answering to the donor class. It was time for Trump, not a career politician.
@jonos100 @karawithasmile @realDonaldTrump Trump couldn‚Äôt undo what obama did if it hadn‚Äôt been done with ‚Äúhis pen and his phone‚Äù. If it had been actual legislation, it would have been a much more detailed process. President Trump was elected to undo much of what obama did. Sorry.
@Ms_B_DuBois @realDonaldTrump No bot here- I‚Äôm a thinking, feeling, reasoning human. Nothing mechanical or programmed about my reactions, so give me a break with the bot tag.
@realdramaimp Got a lot to say, eh?
@EZgoin76 @mcshernj @DanimalSB @realDonaldTrump Dirty Democrat dealing!
@EZgoin76 @mcshernj @DanimalSB @realDonaldTrump Keep dreaming.
@THELanceLenzi @realDonaldTrump Nobody is taking a thing from me, because I‚Äôm not looking for anything. I have, however, received a few things back that were taken from me by the obama admin. Big Govt bureaucracy and the resulting waste and theft is not something we support. Less is more for us.
@brilliantorange @realDonaldTrump Whatever, snowflake.
@realdramaimp I could care less about followers- I‚Äôm just rebutting the BS that I‚Äôm subjected to.
@krassenstein Our economy seems to be coming back to life. Go ahead- credit obama.
@soulwhisper2016 Trumps net worth has fallen since he was sworn in. Not so for the clintons and Obama‚Äôs.
@onegoal777 @realDonaldTrump Typical stuff from the left. Not enough brains to actually make a statement.
@joxer136 @realDonaldTrump Being a sanctuary state is legal?
@realdramaimp @realDonaldTrump Whiner!
@THELanceLenzi @realDonaldTrump Like you Democrats would have allowed the Republicans to appoint a justice if the roles were reversed. Obama did enough damage with his failed policies and agreements
@GeorgeAFuller @realDonaldTrump You and your ilk are the crybabies
@brilliantorange @realDonaldTrump Not as bad as OBAMA
@Ms_B_DuBois @realDonaldTrump Ain‚Äôt happenin!
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump It would be nice to see some peace, love and tolerance coming from you, my whiny friend.
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs doing a much better job than his predecessor, hater.
@chicagocraig @WhiteHouse You clowns are the hypocrites. Trump is acting for all of us. Things are improving for all of us. Wake up!
@THELEAKONASA @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr Crybaby. We gave obama his chance to ‚Äúunite‚Äù us, as he promised. We really hoped he would be good for the USA. Instead, look at the damage he did. Backwards with Pres Trump ? Hah!
@jonos100 @karawithasmile @realDonaldTrump Undoing the horrible policies of obama is absolutely a major accomolishment. Have you heard the latest regarding Hezbollah and how obama prevented US law enforcement from coming down on their drug dealing and money laundering in the US? All for his bad deal.
@mauriciohenao @realDonaldTrump Take your own advice
@GrimmReaper101 @realDonaldTrump Riiight! Obama wanted to give everyone everything they needed- unsustainable! Blew up our National debt. Really wanted to socialize our economy, but wasn‚Äôt bright enough to realize that we had no ambition to be like Venezuela. Capitalism rules- get working!
@Professing_Prof @realDonaldTrump Obama ceded our leadership to everyone. Kissed Putin‚Äôs behind
@rvanbree @realDonaldTrump You people are sick- too much time on your hands?
@karawithasmile @realDonaldTrump President Trump has accomplished more in a year than Obama did in eight!
@holybilal @realDonaldTrump We crossed and voted as we wished, and elected the right candidate. Take your off base vitriol back to whatever hole you crawled out of.
@TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump You mean measure DOWN to Obama. Over the eight years Obama had the helm, he gave us outrageous, unconstitutional, and unsustainable policies, agreements, and legislation. 	High unemployment,  little growth, over regulation, and dirty dealing were the hallmarks of his admin.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump More profane rhetoric from the left. Lacking the intelligence to do anything else.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump Clearly from people with nothing better to do with their time.
@DivaSigne @Felicia1669 @ummmno21 @realBigBalls @realDonaldTrump What makes you lefties so crude? If you had anything other than hate to add, I could understand.                   I did not vote for obama, but when he was elected, I hoped he would unite us as he promised. I resolved to support him and give him his chance to govern. Not you?
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt listen to the lefties who have lost their minds. Keep working for all of us.
@DonCole64 @rubyred93 @realDonaldTrump Who‚Äôs delusional? Obama suppressed prosperity through bureaucracy and over regulation. Trump set the economy free again.
@mearner @realDonaldTrump Nobody is trying to prevent legitimate votes from being cast.
@TrumpDotDotDot @realDonaldTrump Dems talking about kleptocracy? Give me a break.
@keithvoice @realDonaldTrump Lost the popular vote because of the huge populations of New York and California. That‚Äôs why we have electoral votes- so the sparsely populated middle of the country still has a voice in elections.
@JohnH2o @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt forget- democrats bus their voters to the polling places, multiple polling places!
@lazpujol @realDonaldTrump You have no idea how many fraudulent votes are cast in every election.
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump If a photo ID was required to cast a vote, the Democrats would lose that phantom part of their base that has been helping them win elections for many years. They will continue to resist efforts to prevent illegal votes from being cast. Time for change!
@writer61752 @HillaryClinton Might as well add a few more felons to your party
@Shan_Mixhelle @toots717 @kidchico @HillaryClinton Sure- turn a blind eye on all of Hillary‚Äôs hijinks. She and Bill took millions from the Russians for not objecting to the Uranium One deal, and let‚Äôs not forget her email scandal. She clearly took efforts to destroy evidence and cover her tracks. Dirty dealings.
@BowlNamedJames @dotcomm212 @Gatekeeper24 @realDonaldTrump Honest scrutiny is expected.
@adriabutterwick @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a sick pup
@jackschofield @realDonaldTrump Hillary and Bill are the ones with the Russian cash, pal.
@jackschofield @realDonaldTrump You are tripping, man. Come back to earth. You people really have lost your minds.
@jray9091 @realDonaldTrump Can‚Äôt stand the truth, can you? Political partisanship is alive in Justice Dept. and FBI. There is no room for that in a free society.
@littlesueellis @Wildsteamroller @laxietoo @MrsAkerblom @JohnnyBledo @realDonaldTrump @mikefarb1 You don‚Äôt have to recognize him. We elected him.
@laxietoo @MrsAkerblom @JohnnyBledo @realDonaldTrump @mikefarb1 What you didn‚Äôt count on was how fed up many of us were with feeling that our elected officials did not represent our interests and answered only to the donor class.
@JohnnyBledo @realDonaldTrump More BS from your side
@JanzforCongress @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should do your jobs in a nonpartisan fashion and avoid using made up ‚Äúfacts‚Äù as the basis for an investigation targeting our president. If you don‚Äôt understand where POTUS is coming from, you are not conscious.
@gillovnot @realDonaldTrump None of them were sending classified documents. Hillary  and her staff were, and then she deleted them to avoid us finding out about her nefarious shenanigans.
@syedarifniazi @realDonaldTrump America has been in sociological decline for a long time. Government freebies and Democrat policies have caused a decline in what makes America great.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump Your tweets are pornographic
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump Lib has become an insult because of the liberals penchant for incomprehensible gibberish and ‚Äúfacts‚Äù plucked from the air or from the ever inventive mainstream media
@DivaSigne @Felicia1669 @ummmno21 @realBigBalls @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre going to be miserable for at least the next eight years, and hopefully longer. You people are the haters, in spite of what you try to put on us. Obama and Hillary enriched themselves at taxpayer expense. Trump doesn‚Äôt need our money. He‚Äôs not perfect, but he‚Äôs our pres!
@DonaCastilloMcI Trying to knock some sense into that thing atop your shoulders?
@JoyAnnReid Since when is the US responsible for your bad decisions? Should have done your homework. Sue the company that defrauded you.
@TitusNation Partisan politics have no place at Justice and FBI.
@chrislhayes Yes, the Russians were bringing the truth to light. Sorry that it disagrees with your agenda
@Dargamogirl @VP @POTUS Another classy democrat
@patric_reynolds @VP @POTUS You‚Äôre speaking of obama and Hillary, correct?
@RecoveringPolAd @Drew4748481 @rosie514 @VP @POTUS Yes, like obama did anything to reduce spending. He totally blew the budget
@_DimwitTrump @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I guess Obama was too busy vacationing to fix it during his eight years. Trump has been in office less than a year
@SarahShutter69 @realDonaldTrump Thank you!
@TonieSnell @realDonaldTrump Helpful comment, hater
@Cramerstrasse @realDonaldTrump Thank Obama for his huge chunk of our debt, and for trying to pick winners in our economy. Solyndra, Tesla, etc., instead of letting free markets determine the winners.
@raycom777 @realDonaldTrump You mean like Obama‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs selling 20% of our uranium to Russians for millions to Bill and Hillary?Just wait- the truth will out!
@pebert2 @realDonaldTrump And you express yourself so eloquently.
@maxmazyn @realDonaldTrump What about the billions Obama gave to Iran, state sponsor of terror, and avowed enemy of the US?
@KPotluru @Scuba_Mimi @adreamersview @Jared_Tims @realDonaldTrump Because you have nothing else to offer
@LoralynHegland @realDonaldTrump You are confusing the Trump administration with Obama‚Äôs, and Clinton‚Äôs, who both used their positions to enrich themselves and their friends and donors. Pay to play with Hillary!
@screennamesbite @realDonaldTrump Someone should stand up for the god-given rights of the Iranian people.
@MichaelSchmel11 @realDonaldTrump Many of us are tired of ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù being used to buy votes and eliminate the incentives for many of our citizens to go out and be productive. Conservatives generally don‚Äôt disagree with helping those who can‚Äôt help themselves.
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump The person I called a nazi has a hitler-like avatar. He/she insinuates that Trump is a nazi, which is ridiculous.
@heathertromble1 @ARNY8315 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity I was talking about Venezuela. I mentioned it to illustrate what happens when dictators seize power and a country socializes its industries. Venezuelans are starving because Chavez and Maduro have ruined their economy by removing the reasons work hard.
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump It would be nice to simply do a little debating, rather than be attacked and ridiculed for offering an opinion. I have avoided commenting for quite some time, and now I‚Äôm rethinking making additional statements because it‚Äôs clear that those who disagree are not open minded.
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump I guess the mainstream media misrepresented reality.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump Says nazi boy
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump As I said, just expressing my right to free speech, not seeking followers. Unlike you, I have no need to be validated. You libs are uninterested in opinions other than your own. I seek not to demean you, I simply seek to state my opinion.
@ARNY8315 @heathertromble1 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Exactly, which is where the US was headed under Obama, and would be on the same path had unscrupulous Hillary been elected. Sorry about your bursted balloon!
@heathertromble1 @ARNY8315 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity I don‚Äôt need followers. I know my opinions are shared by many others. These happen to be my first few tweets.
@heathertromble1 @ARNY8315 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Just exercising my right to free speech, snowflake. Just like a lib- yours is the only opinion you want to hear.
@ARNY8315 @heathertromble1 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Which response?
@mrbangla @bahler_david @realDonaldTrump This President isn‚Äôt forcing anything, unlike Obama, who destabilized more than one Mideast nation, and then stood by as they melted down. He didn‚Äôt even back up his ‚Äúred line in the sand‚Äù after Syria used chemical weapons on its citizens to suppress their rebellion.
@DragonCat936362 @realDonaldTrump Obama and the mainstream media warped reality daily.
@DragonCat936362 @realDonaldTrump More made up news from the Left!
@Weingar2Marilyn @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Duly elected president. You are low IQ and full of bias.
@PamelaDraper @GO6271954 @realDonaldTrump Except time
@karlwireless @realDonaldTrump Goodbye to US govt. getting its fingers into everything. We do not want the bureaucracy getting into things that are working fine(with the exception of when Facebook and others censor content).
@spicysnacks @realDonaldTrump Our ‚Äúpress‚Äù needs to be humiliated. They report their (your) opinions rather than unbiased reporting of events.
@BigThinkr @realDonaldTrump Having hallucinations, snowflake? Internet is up and running, and is being censored by the libs that run large parts of it.
@davidtkeogh @realDonaldTrump The fourth estate? The mainstream media is a joke, snowflake. Propaganda.
@Felicia1669 @ummmno21 @realBigBalls @realDonaldTrump What, not getting your free stuff?
@immalamp @realDonaldTrump We don‚Äôt need their oil, now that Obama‚Äôs pen and phone policies are over.
@Alt_FedEmployee @realDonaldTrump The kind with a constitution, snowflake!
@mrbangla @realDonaldTrump They are only stifled by you libs.
@NancySara_78 @realDonaldTrump He has always said that. Libs are the ones stifling free speech- antifa.
@heathertromble1 @ARNY8315 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity You don‚Äôt sound very smart yourself. Left to you, we are the next Venezuela.
@heathertromble1 @ARNY8315 @bobo55728473 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity A college degree is not required in order to have an opinion. When Obama was elected, those of us who did not vote for him kept our mouths shut, and hoped he would unite us, as he promised. 8 years later,  his agenda was clearly not what he professed. Trump was truthful.
@TiarshawShaw @Gatekeeper24 @dotcomm212 @realDonaldTrump Sounds a bit totalitarian to me. Trump was duly elected. Your suggestion that  his supporters be wiped out is just more of the off base, warped logic that seems to come from you crybabies. Who‚Äôs a nazi?
@dotcomm212 @Gatekeeper24 @realDonaldTrump Trump is representing those who elected him. He supports ALL of our Constitution, not just the parts he likes. He is merely defending himself from the twisted reality being forwarded by you libs who have lost your minds.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs you with the swastika on your arm, right?
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump Every news group except Fox was doing the same for Obama, glorifying his inept regime, which stood by doing nothing as they helped the Mideast melt down and ISIS nearly establish its caliphate.
@InXanadu @realDonaldTrump You libs are some twisted folks
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump He was elected, right?
@DuszaLukasz @realDonaldTrump And Obama gets no blame for his moronic Middle East policies and agreements.
@NatikaMonroe @realDonaldTrump More lies from WAPO
@bahler_david @realDonaldTrump Oh, so our Pres. is supposed to remain silent as the totalitarian govt. of Iran stifles the will of its people? Feeding the terrorists instead of its citizens. Get real.
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Pres Trump has done nothing to stifle the press. He is merely pointing out the bias and inaccuracies that are printed daily. Wake up, snowflake!
@syedarifniazi @realDonaldTrump The way I remember things, Obama spent eight years dividing us, and implementing ridiculous policies and agreements. Just when was our government authorized to force us, against our wills, to purchase something? My healthcare costs more than doubled, for much worse coverage.
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump If the Democrats had been willing to be bipartisan...
