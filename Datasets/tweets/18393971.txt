@afrosypaella I was thinking about places like East Atlanta and seeing hipsters/local whites around Black folks. More in a contemporary sense. But yeah, the segregation is there.
@JamilaRobinson Just a thought while roaming East Atlanta. Between gentrification and how most of the hangouts are in small areas, you see Blacks and whites around each other a lot.
The thing about NY is you can do a ton of things without socializing or interacting with people. In other places you‚Äôll get bored quicker, unless you start making friends.
Sometimes the challenge is creating a universe where you matter. Where people say hi, you have a secret handshake, and the bond between friends is unbreakable.

Passing through Bedford and Fulton in the Stuy, and madd people of the Islamic faith are preparing for prayer. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight.
The weirdest but best way to describe my social life is walking through Crown Heights at 4 am on a Monday morning. Like a silent, lonely street after a zombie apocalypse.
Sighting number 2: a white guy with an Afro Punk shirt near Union Square. Y‚Äôall gotta stop inviting people to the cookout...
Gotta finish packing for my trip to Oakland. So ready for this damn vacation.
Meanwhile said artist was probably covered by the Black press and worked in Black spaces as white ones overlooked them. But nope, some white snob just magically discovered them.
At some point I'll write about white people seeking out older, neglected Black artists and wanting to claim control of their stories. They become the ones who 'saved' them from oblivion...and are showered with praise for doing so.
@HolyShitSnackss I can see them for 7.50 thanks to my BAM membership, but we can do that
@HolyShitSnackss I almost saw it last night, but ran home to eat tacos and dodge the rain
I don't even like talking about 90s hip-hop because some white guy in his 40s is waiting to latch onto me in order to make his hipster fawning not seem dickheaded. And then they hate you when you don't want to be the Black friend.
The thing I hate about studying obscure Black subjects is white people try to lord ownership of those areas...but secretly depend on you to validate their fascinations. Crate digging, Black films, painters, you name it.
I sometimes watch A Different World as it airs each morning on BET Her. Today they're showing the first episode of season 6, without the Aretha Franklin intro. It felt eerie to not hear her voice at the beginning, only to learn of her passing shortly after.

The thing that worries me about MoviePass is how this may affect other Black startups. If they fail, will VCs become even stingier with supporting Black entrepreneurs? (Hint: Probably so.)
All the President's Men is a great film, but I dunno if that could happen today. I wish it would, but would anyone believe it in the faux news era?
Historically it's always described as a 'complicated' relationship, but it's not. And when you look at the ways white women are protected by society, it extends to the language used to describe them in the antebellum era. They were also rapists, but nobody calls them that.
Watching Mandingo reaffirms my belief that white women were raping male slaves. If a slave does not have the power to consent - which they wouldn't because they are a slave - they are being raped. But you never see it described this way.
Did I say Mandingo is a really terrible film and I don't get how it became a cult classic? It's more of a soft porno than a honest look at slavery...

And I'm not bashing the writer. I (kinda) get what she was going for, but that's a complicated topic. One that involves asking why the field has widened for Black creatives like Donald Glover and Issa Rae. Maybe it's that Hollywood wouldn't tell their stories before?
There are some topics I will never pitch to most outlets. Call it self-censorship, but I don't care to explain certain things to a non-Black audience. Some shit is not meant for them.
This is so weird...why would you write this at the NYT? Does it challenge their views, or invite more fetishism? It's not something that even your super progressive white liberal who reads the New Yorker and saw Get Out three times will understand.
This is why I don't tackle Black topics in mainstream publications. Whatever critique or conversation starter the author had was not only lost in the shuffle, it invites others to project their problematic views. (See the white people in the comments. Or not.)
I dunno if I should say this...but is she writing for a Black audience or a white one? This comes off as so, so bewildering. https://t.co/8DI2Yq4Q76

Comedians like Chris and Dave talk about race a lot, which plays well with a guilty white audience. Others who are 'successful' saturate the field to boost their stardom. But most Black comedians aren't seen as 'money makers.'
You can't have a honest discussion about Monique and Wanda without mentioning how race plays into this. They're largely perceived as Black comedians, and to Hollywood their audience is 'limited.' Which means they don't attract white people.

Shola Lynch makes a great point about finding other Black creatives like Kathleen Collins. "There are more stories to be told. She's not a unicorn."
Nina Collins, daughter of Kathleen, will release a second book of her mother's writings. She didn't think so many people would fall in love with the first one, 'Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?'
Four people of color and one white woman for album of the year. Seems the Adele controversy caused a (black)lash. #grammys #GrammyNominations

@1nePhenomenalMe Right, he said that in the panel. He didn't want the film to be two hours of relentlessness.
Jordan was asked about the Golden Globe nomination. He called it "awkward," and noted for a Black audience the film is not a comedy. While there are funny moments in the film, it was intentionally designed so there wouldn't be any jokes.
Jordan and Daniel wanted to nail the right reaction for that scene. Daniel brings up a time when went to a Comic-Con, and someone said he looked like nighttime.
Daniel Kaluuya said filming the micro-aggression scenes was hard. He had to do multiple takes of the part where the white guy says "Black is in fashion."

Wayne Shorter noted that Coltrane's father was a preacher. You can hear that in his playing, if you listen closely. #ChasingTrane
Coltrane developed the melody of Alabama using words from MLK. His music was words in a different language. #ChasingTrane
I kinda prefer hearing from the musicians. Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Sonny. All have the better observations.

But Disney could buy the X-Men and Fantastic Four back. That's a possibility.

The law was supposedly created to stop interracial clubs in Harlem. It was largely enforced but mob-owned venues could dodge fines.
It's believed that Monk, Holiday and Charlie Parker went broke because of this law. They couldn't perform in their own city.
Same during the jazz days, but it was widely used against Harlem venues. Giuliani enforced it as part of his broken windows policing. https://t.co/uq9OdywxhO
Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday. All lost work in NY because of this draconian law.
This law affected Black musicians and venues the most. The local jazz scene was harmed by it, and hip-hop was a target later on. https://t.co/zAjHoKnlWP

@julietmbeverly That's sad and very unsurprising.
@fredaraMareva Yep. It's hard to make a living as a journalist, so Black writers turn to academia for the paycheck. Thus, journalism becomes a white field.
There's a great risk our era of Black music will be remembered through whitewashed, non-impactful writing. That shouldn't happen.
I can read something like Amiri Baraka's Black Music and be blown away each time. But you have to let those voices be heard.
The writing at so many outlets is forgettable. Nothing that's going to redefine music criticism, or be featured in an anthology.
You see critics praising writers like Greg Tate, Kelefa Sanneh, Hilton Als and such. But someone had to open the door for them.
Like young Black writers with refreshing perspectives and input on the music. Instead we get these warm turkey, forgettable takes.
I see so many young Black voices trying to be heard, with things to say about this music and culture. But nobody gives them a shot.

@TalibKweli @kzshabazz @SandyDarity @YOUOVEROWEUS Very true. I can travel to places like Ghana, but many Ghanaians can't get a visa to come here.
Why are so many books by Black authors out of print? Especially ones before the 90s? Wait, don't answer that.
The article says this book is considered the most insightful perspective on Coltrane. It's highly praised by jazz critics, yet out of print.
The decline of Black music outlets, and the hardships facing the Black press, means white ones dominate the space. But they don't diversify.
The same is happening to Hip-Hop. White outlets can endure these hard journalism times. Black ones can't. https://t.co/MmoAl5QBak
One should always speak from their angle. But music criticism is currently dominated by one group of people. And it's not right.
That's because most white critics don't situate jazz within a Black cultural context. It's 'American' music to them, mostly.
Most jazz books are boring to me. They're written with a emphasis on the music, divorcing it from the time and place it came from.
That to me is such a rare, important voice in a field dominated by older white critics. It's the same problem I'm going through.

On top of this, Geri had a piano duet with Patrice Rushen. THE Patrice Rushen of 'Forget Me Nots.' Man (or woman), what an evening.
I was dying to see them together. Their shows at the Village Vanguard were always sold out, so I wasn't gonna miss this.
And then she performed with the ACS trio: her, Esperanza Spalding and Terri Lyne Carrington. EVERYONE was talking about this group.
That evening was beautiful. Geri's touch and Carrie's visuals were something for the eyes and ears. A really amazing combination.

This is basically whitewashing. Oh and Gil and Brian never gave a fuck about Dylan.
@dascruggs And during Black Music Month
And this erases Black artists like James Brown and the Last Poets, who were clear influences on Hip-Hop. What a load of crap.
@TheWisdomBody Rolling Stone has never written anything good about Hip-Hop. Never.
For some outlet to try this, especially one with no credibility in Hip-Hop, is ridiculous. It's disrespectful to Gil, and Hip-Hop.
It mostly started with Clive Davis giving him the title, but rappers from Mos Def to Kanye consider him as such. You can't suggest otherwise
To be clear, Gil was never comfortable with being called the Godfather of Rap. But there is no way Dylan can claim the title over him.
And now some outlet like Rolling Stone wants to make Dylan the "Godfather of Rap." Because that's who they always preferred.
The fact he was always being compared to a white artist is peak caucasity, and I wouldn't be surprised if Rolling Stone did this too.
Gil couldn't be accepted on a larger level if there wasn't some white equivalent to compare him to. And he hated this.
Aside from Gil being called "the Godfather of Rap," they used to call him the "Black Bob Dylan" in his early days.
I'm basically writing a book about Gil Scott-Heron. This take is trash for so many reasons https://t.co/ob2H7Zk0Yx

Unless @shadowandact can find a film with a Black director, Black cast and a nine figure budget, Black Panther could be the first.
Bad Boys 2 was 130 million, but Michael Bay directed that. Ditto for After Earth, with M. Night Shyamalan as director.
Red Tails was made with $58 million. Next is Straight Outta Compton with $50 million. And those are the exceptions, not the norm.
For Black Panther to have a Black cast, Black director and a nine figure budget? As far as I can tell, that's unprecedented.
Quick thought: this might be the first Black film with a budget of $100 million. If so, that would be huge and groundbreaking.

And I never knew that much about Black Panther growing up. But this feels like the Black superhero team flict I've always wanted.
Everything from the cast, the outfits, the representation, the action. Goddamn. The trailer is everything, and then some.
Seeing the Black Panther trailer feels like...cloud 9 for me. A validation of my childhood dreams, finally coming true.
After sitting through the X-Men films, a good Blade trilogy and Spawn, I was ready for the next thing. But it was just a dream.
So of course I wanted to see them in a big picture. Something that centers them instead of token heroes on the periphery.
Then I got into Static Shock, War Machine and such later on. I was a comic book fan, but these were the ones I felt connected to.
I was most attached to the Black X-Men characters. Storm, Synch, Gateway. Bishop. I would pretend they were the most powerful.
That and the X-Men were the two comic books I cared for. I didn't realize it back then, but it was about the representation.

@GoonTherapy Sounds interesting. Needs hot sauce or something tho
You only have to go back to the Whitney Biennial from a few months ago to see what I mean. There's a conversation happening.
Like, how many great Black artists from his time were never recognized? Is the art world righting a wrong, or chasing a trend?
Do we appreciate Basquiat because he was a genius? Or because of his association with Warhol?
Personally, I feel that too many Black artists are only recognized in death. Or have to be validated by some white institution.

It's why Sidney Poitier looks brown in one film, charcoal Black in another. Bad lighting/color balance distorts Black skin hues.

I want to see Ebony thriving. Many of their early stories are downright amazing. But they gotta get their ish together.
Granted, they seem to be in financial trouble (remember the photo archive fiasco?), but that's not an excuse. Pay your writers.
@dascruggs It's a frustrating situation. Their recent attempt to sell their photo archive underpins this.
Been around long enough to know people, and to hear which outlets you should avoid. I value my writing too much to get played.
There's kinda a reason I have the bylines that I do. Some outlets I would love to write for, but they gotta respect your hustle.
The fact a white writer was paid before Black writers owed from years ago is...American? Like, le sigh.

Been watching a lot of @HenryLouisGates lately. First his new Africa series, then Many Rivers to Cross. Now? And Still I Rise.
But his audacity to depict Black beauty will endure any outcome. He was a great artist, and nothing will ever detract from that.
Perhaps he will receive his due in death, as is the case with most Black artists. Or he'll be fetishized and exploited like Basquiat.
His passing last week was a huge loss. The art world has largely ignored his impact, but that doesn't diminish his legacy.

You should watch the Freedom Riders documentary. She basically told Robert Kennedy eff you when he wanted to stop the bus rides.

The documentary just supposed my statement. A Black family can rarely stay in the middle class for more than 2 generations.
MLK said the white mobs in Chicago were worst than anything he had witnessed in the south. Think about that.
Also, the history of banks upholding segregation is something rarely talked about. Just look at redlining.
They're talking about the 'Black belt' of Chicago. Important to understand this when discussing the city.
Pullman Porter jobs are considered some of the first Black middle class jobs. First chance to earn more than other menial jobs.
Is the Black middle class just idealism, not a financial reality? Upward mobility is not a consistent thing for Black people.

@chaedria Through these things and engage with each other without these factors getting in the way.
@chaedria Widely, it creates a narrow view of our culture. That's why I still factor white supremacy into this. But yeah we gotta break...
@chaedria When great cultural statements like Boyz in The Hood and Daughters of the Dust are created, but only one gets distributed...
@chaedria I hear you. The diaspora needs to have a more open dialogue about this. We have to learn from each other.
Also, a Black woman giving birth to the first baby in decades? I get the metaphor, but it kinda felt...something was off.
Finally watched Children of Men. This film is relevant for all of the wrong reasons. I kept waiting for someone to say Brexit.
@OsandiSekou @chaedria And other R&amp;B and AA artists. It was seen as the way to break Bob to AA audiences.
@OsandiSekou @chaedria DJs like Frankie Crocker were breaking Bob Marley records, but during US tours Bob was an opener for the Commodores..
@OsandiSekou @chaedria That sounds about right. They probably played reggae at block parties, but not as a staple of DJ sets.
@chaedria How we are perceived worldwide. And oftentimes, we fight with each other about this when the miscommunication isn't our fault.

@chaedria Us differently. At the same time, this is often used to erase other cultures within the diaspora and lump Blacks together...

@chaedria Also real quick to this point: I think the problem here is that our impact is widely spread because of America's position....

@chaedria What they are facing. I think you're right in a sense, but I also see this debate on Twitter and there's a conversation happening.
@chaedria The younger generations are thinking about this and are figuring out how their own histories of colonialism and such factor into..
@chaedria Our generation, I see the same process happening with Black Brits too. And based on the Black Brits I follow here on Twitter...
@chaedria This is probably true, but just as we are still unpacking the legacies of slavery and racism here in America, especially with...
@chaedria *melting pot. And invisible in the sense that we couldn't be erased as a threat from their consciousness.
@chaedria National identity the way that we're seeing now. In America, the so-called melting, white people could never render us invisible.
@chaedria That's true, but also I don't think the population number was enough to form a vocal group which caused Britain to question its..
@chaedria Large enough that we are a significant amount of the population, and could have a voice which threatens American racism.
@chaedria Yeah I kinda agree, but I think that's because of the specific conditions of America. Personally, I think that our numbers were...
@chaedria lol, yeah if you couldn't get the dance floor moving your career was over. the crowd decided if you were hot, or not.
@chaedria I'd have to verify this, but I think Kool Herc often played funk and disco records because Jamaican music wasn't popular with AAs.
@CharlieBCuff Erased or abused by global anti-Blackness. Same thing with Black British people. The entire diaspora is marginalized by this.
@CharlieBCuff Others within the diaspora. As a whole, the diaspora lacks control over how our cultures are perceived. Everyone gets...
@CharlieBCuff Though, I would say this is more of how the west appropriates and commodified AA culture, and uses that to stereotype...
@CharlieBCuff It's probably not wide-sweeping anti-AA bias, but there appears to be some resentment towards the popularity of AAs globally.
@CharlieBCuff I don't know if I would frame it the same way, but there is truth to what she says. But it's largely on an individual basis...
@lesliepitterson All of us need to connect more. Social media is great to help with that, but there's a lot of miscommunication as well.
@lesliepitterson For sure. That way we can all understand these distinctions better, as you mentioned in your first response.
@Ashley_Reynolds Yep, I done brought entire subs with me before lol
@JanelWLOX *faints*
@lesliepitterson But also how AAs were influenced by Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah and such too. The diaspora has always exchanged ideas.
@lesliepitterson This is true. Many icons in AA culture were non-AA, ie Marcus Garvey, Stokely Carmichael, Shirley Chisholm, etc
It's a lot to unpack, and not really an argument I often have. Especially on Twitter, where you don't have enough characters.
Development of our tradition of activism and what we are fighting for, and against. Our situation molded this.
I don't think our culture is superior or more radical to any other diasporic group. At all. But I think this factors heavily into our...
The genesis of AA culture started within a mostly white nation. I think this has a lot to do with our thinking and approach.
I've debated with a few friends how radicalism within the AA community developed differently from most of the diaspora.

So it's not surprising that pop/white culture struggles with this stuff. The relevancy of Hip-Hop is decided by Black people.
Things like battles on wax or DJ battles were not things that truly appealed to pop culture. They are still Hip-Hop expressions.
It's still Black folks who define how cool, or uncool, these moments in Hip-Hop are. That hasn't changed, at all.
Hilarious seeing media outlets rushing to cover Remy/Nicki and using terms like drag/shade. They don't know the culture.

Sam has been holding down the MCU fort since day one. He even has several cameos in the Agents of Shield show. The man puts in work.

In short, Camilla Long centers her whiteness in a very ham-fisted take. It's never about Black people. Bravo, white woman.
What a white thing to say. A film with a Black cast, that explores homosexuality and has some drug dealing? It must be for a white audience!
And obviously Moonlight can't be for Black people. It's too critically acclaimed and/or artsy for a Black audience to care.
In her efforts to mock her white peers, she assumes she knows what 'the Blacks' want in a film. Because she knows what Black people want.
Camilla Long uses her 'review' to bash how white critics have approached the film. The opening sentences are thinly-veiled proof of this.
I can't read her review because I don't care enough to support the Sunday Times. But the first few paragraphs are hot nonsense.

@TracyBrandes Gotcha. Wanted to make sure I didn't misinterpret your tweet!
Adele is the latest white artist used by the #GRAMMYs to uphold a prejudice. It's as simple as that.
@TracyBrandes Like put them on blast? Or something else?
And let's not forget that Solange wasn't even nominated. The #Grammys snubbed the entire Knowles family.
Remember when this happened? When rappers boycotted the #GRAMMYs? It's all related. https://t.co/ycFlTs30Oz
There's a history of disrespect at the #GRAMMYs that needs to be addressed. It needs to be challenged.
Adele isn't the first white artist to be put in that situation. She did okay, but challenging the #Grammys would've been better.
RT @slb79: If Beyonc√© were to stop performing for the Grammys like she stopped giving press, their ratings would see a significant decline.
Adele's message is appreciated. But this is exactly why Frank Ocean and others boycotted the #GRAMMYs.
