Here's an unrolled, easy to read version of my earlier thread on the Alex Acosta story today... https://t.co/4G8giI2j7J
Did I mention that Alex Acosta is now a Trump cabinet official? Right now? Still? https://t.co/F0inu2uUY3
So, a federal judge just ruled that the current Labor Secretary gave a secret non-prosecution agreement to a prolific, serial child sex offender -- then broke the law by agreeing with the guy's defense team that they'd all keep it secret from the victims.
And which prosecutors did that specifically? Was it someone just working below Alex Acosta that he might not have known about? Someone he just didn't adequately supervise on this case? 		Uh, not according to the judge. Read this: https://t.co/OBxcztevut
Today, as Brown sums it up, the judge ruled that, "while prosecutors had the right to resolve the case in any way they saw fit, they violated the law by hiding the agreement from Epstein’s victims."
The basis for the civil case that led to today's ruling was the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which should have *blocked* Acosta from doing this deal in secret with Epstein, without telling his potential victims. 		Here, Julie Brown sums it up elegantly: https://t.co/sNCoACvYIk
(State prostitution charges, really? If you're a grown-ass man doing this to children, is it really the most important thing under the law to know whether or not you also gave the kids money?? Arrrrgh.) Forgive the aside.
That had not been established in court before in part because Acosta, as US Attorney, gave Epstein a non-prosecution agreement for all fed crimes - a deal that extended to all his potential accomplices.  Acosta instead let Epstein plead on *prostitution* charges in state court.
For the Epstein case itself, this is a breakthrough because for the first time, a court is confirming Epstein's serial abuse of multiple minor girls (a federal crime) in Florida, elsewhere in the US, and abroad.
Julie K. Brown at the Miami Herald @jkbjournalist is the one who broke this open. Her story is the best one you'll see today summing up what has happened:		https://t.co/dx1lAyBW6y

(And yes, this is my long-winded way of telling Susan no, honey, sorry, I can't take this Friday off. Or Monday. But maybe someday soon? Probably not, but maybe?)
But the Special Counsel's Office confirms to us that the extension of that DC deadline is just for the defense. 		Prosecutors still expect to submit their sentencing document about Manafort, in DC, by this Friday.
In DC however, the judge had set this Friday (2/22) as the deadline for sentencing submissions from both the prosecutors and Manafort's defense.		Today, Manafort's defense asked for -- and got -- an extension so they won't have to file until Monday 2/25.
Last week, we saw the sentencing submission from the Special Counsel's Office in the Paul Manafort case in Virginia (19-24 years, millions in fines and restitution). 		Manafort's defense has not yet filed their own sentencing memo in the Virginia case.

And then one last intrigue on p.66:		Judge: “All right. I just have one question for my public minute order. The REDACTED, the fact that REDACTED is still sealed. So I should not use that in my minute order, is that correct?”		Both sides agree, correct. 		But what could that be?
And then starting on p.50 a whole bunch of pages that look like this: https://t.co/aFQPMWsvhy
“...advancing a new version that’s less inculpatory of REDACTED was significant enough to set off alarm bells with his own lawyers.”
p.44 On the (apparently campaign related) other DOJ investigation Manafort lied about...		Judge: “The evidence suggests that he decided to obscure what had taken place to shield possibly Mr. REDACTED. This withholding of facts, this begrudging behavior...”
“... I’m not sure I buy that because the point of seeking cooperation from a person at the highest level of the campaign was to obtain accurate information about the acts of others, in particular what transpired REDACTED. So it’s very troubling to me.”
p. 41		This is new. This suggests the mysterious “other” DOJ investigation Manafort lied about is an investigation that also relates to the Trump campaign:		Judge: “Defendant suggests that it’s not really that important because it wasn’t about his own wrongdoing...”
“...doesn’t have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link.”
“... This is a topic at the undisputed core of the Special Counsel’s investigation into — as paragraph B of the appointment order put it — ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign.’ Mr. Kilimnik...
p.40		Judge: “We’ve now spent considerable time talking about multiple clusters of false or misleading or incomplete or needed-to-be-prodded-by-counsel statements, all of which center around the defendant’s relationship or communications with Mr. Kilimnik”...
p.30		On what the judge describes as Manafort’s “pattern” of “dissembling” about Kilimnik:		Judge: “Denying the meeting REDACTED was denying a contact that was part of what the Office of Special Counsel was investigating.”
p. 27 		“This is an example of a situation in which the OSC legitimately concluded he’s lying to minimize things here... 		This is a problematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.”
p. 26 On Manafort attesting as to Kilimnik’s state of mind...		Judge: “I think it’s also fair to say that advancing that version was not just relaying what Kilimnik said, it appears to be an attempt to exonerate him.”
“... that the record supports a finding that the Office of Special Counsel’s interest in tracing the flow of funds to Manafort particularly from REDACTED and vendors associated with the campaign, was material to this investigation.”
p.23 On that same $125k payment...		Judge: “I find this was a matter about which he provided intentionally false information to the Office of Special Counsel, the FBI, and the grand jury. 		I also note — without deciding whether I have to make this finding or not —...
p.16 On the $125k payment toward Manafort’s legal fees...		Judge: “The record doesn’t seem to reflect confusion and the defendant didn’t profess to be confused. He does appear, though, to be making a concerted effort to avoid saying what really took place.”
p. 11: Judge then says Manafort’s claims about his declining health in prison were simply asserted by his lawyers with no effort to back the claims up with any support. 		Judge: “It left the impression that the issue was left in the pleading for public consumption, but not mine.”
p.10: “My concern isn’t with non-answers or simply denials but times he affirmatively advanced a detailed alternative story that was inconsistent with the facts.”

(It is no spoiler for me to say here that the solution to the fictional nutball president in "Camp David" is itself nutball, but still...)
In other words, fiction is entertainment -- especially a roiling little potboiler like this one -- but in the right circumstances it can also help us get our head around how we might/should/could handle extreme circumstances we might otherwise never anticipate. Anyhoo.

The basic idea was that an obscure 1965 political thriller (written by Fletcher Knebel, the author of Seven Days in May) had an eerily similar premise. 		This was subhead on the cover of the book: "What Would Happen if the President of the U.S.A. Went Stark Raving Mad?" https://t.co/yNKYsSUOdv

full remarks here...		https://t.co/m3fWlsOEwT
We are privileged to live in a country that is governed by the rule of  law. It is easy to take for granted. I am thankful for Law Day and  events like this because they provide us with an opportunity to reflect  on the genius of the American Constitution.  		 Thank you.
And, Lincoln concluded, “let it become the political religion of the   nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave   and the gay of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions” keep  the rule of law.
—  let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls,  and enforced in courts of justice.”
“Let reverence for the laws,” he implored, “be breathed by every  American mother … let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in  colleges; let it be written in Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs --
Abraham Lincoln believed that the best way to ensure the survival of our  “edifice of liberty and equal rights” is to enshrine reverence for the  rule of law in the hearts of the citizens.
Lawyers and judges bear great responsibility for implementing and  explaining those principles. The further we get from the founding  generation, the less we appreciate how much everything depends on people  rather than paper.
Our system of government is not self-executing. It relies on wisdom and  self-restraint. In a democratic republic, liberty is protected by  cultural norms as well as by constitutional text.
Ultimately, in our system, sovereignty rests in the people. When “We the  People” established the Constitution, it was a relatively novel  concept. And “We the People” remain responsible for protecting it.
That tension – the power of  each branch to say no – is one of the things that protects liberty.  		 Each of us has a role to play in protecting this unique and indispensable feature of our constitutional order.
The push and pull among and between the branches is bipartisan.  It  exists regardless of which party is in power. Justice Scalia explained  that Americans should “learn to love the separation of powers,” even  though it frequently leads to controversy.
Prosecutors collect evidence and decide whether it establishes a crime  that warrants prosecution. We do not determine guilt.		 I know that judges and legislators are sometimes frustrated by executive  branch decisions, such as prosecutorial charging decisions.
And the people check both the  federal and the state governments.		 Separation of powers can be frustrating. Prosecutors are sometimes  disappointed when the judicial branch acquits someone it thought was  guilty of a crime. But that is part of the genius of our system.
— that convert the  Bill of Rights from a paper assurance to a living guarantee.”		 The Founders dispersed power both horizontally and vertically. The three  branches of the federal government check one another. The states and  the federal government check one another.
Justice Scalia explained that “it is those other humdrum provisions—the  structural, mechanistic portions of the Constitution that pit, in James  Madison’s words, ‘ambition against ambition,’ and make it impossible for  any element of government to obtain unchecked power --
than a  written guarantee of rights, because a written guarantee is only as  powerful as the system in place to protect it. Our constitutional  structure, and the separation of powers embodied in that structure,  represents our government’s defining feature.
But the Constitution  originally had no Bill of Rights. The issue  was considered during the  Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in  1787, but the Constitution  was ratified without it.  The Framers were more concerned about our government’s structure...
It  has served a big and diverse Union from the horse-and-buggy age to the  space age to the digital age. No other Constitution has achieved that.		 Our Bill of Rights, containing the first ten amendments, is often  regarded as the pride of American government.
According to the World Bank, the average constitution has a lifespan of  about 19 years. Ours has lasted more than 12 times that—and it has  endured through the most dynamic period of change in human history.
and the money it appropriates is  being properly spent. But  oversight is not intended to eliminate the  line between executive  branch authority and legislative branch authority. 		 Our Constitution has provided us with the most stable and resilient legal system on Earth.
Here's the back half of Rod Rosenstein's public remarks yesterday...		Congressional oversight is important. Congress must be able to hold  hearings, conduct inquiries, and require reports so that it knows the laws are being faithfully executed...

Incidentally, that’s part of why witnesses are supposed to be protected. It’s not just about their physical safety, it’s also about treatment of them (by parties related to the matter they witnessed) that’s designed to queer the case.
The same logic applies to Comey and all the other corroborating witnesses. The more they’re mistreated (unjustly maligned, randomly demoted, etc) by POTUS, the more “biased” vs the President they will be made to seem.
If McCabe is right that these actions against him are intended discredit him as a corroborating witness for Comey’s account of his firing, then the invective and taunting by POTUS have a purpose: make sure McCabe will be seen as having good reason to hold a grudge vs POTUS.
