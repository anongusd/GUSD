And that is how my wife's family all became completely and utterly embarrassed and I now have this incredible story to tell. Oh, and the elderly people did not wish to buy the enormous sphincter stretcher unfortunately.
An elderly gentleman and his wife approach Karen and say, "You have some very nice antiques here and some very odd stuff too."		Karen is confused. "Odd stuff? Like what?"		"Oh I'd better just show you..."
Come Saturday, they are in full yard sale mode. My daughters are leading people into the house and giving them the spiel about how everything not in this room is for sale, make an offer. Karen is monitoring the house and my wife is outside taking payments.
So they get back to cleaning...Aaaand forget about the box.
Oh. I may have forgotten to mention. Chris is Christopher. Christopher with the ultra conservative bible thumping dad, remember?
Discussion ensues on how to deal with this monster in the closet and it is suggested that everything be boxed up and shipped to Chris at his dad's house, where he's staying. https://t.co/Y2GdS6Edds
Once gloves have been acquired, Black Snake Groan is re-boxed and put on a shelf to be dealt with later...
They manage to shoo the girls away and since no one wishes to touch this python, the hunt for kitchen gloves begins.
The adults scramble to hide the fantastically farcical phallus that is staring at them from the floor...
The adults are dying, no one wants to touch it since who knows when this humongous one-eyed willy was last cleaned.	.	.	.	.	And here come the footsteps of little people who in no way should be exposed to such things. https://t.co/H5bKyzQ3i7
There, lying on the floor, in all 18 inches of 4 inch diameter glory is...	.	.	.	.	.	a giant	.	.	.	.	black	.	.	.	.	.	gleaming	.	.	.	.	replica	.	.	.	male	.	.	.	.	genitalia. https://t.co/0ABw1Wc3lL
Let's take a short moment to reflect that these adults are Chris's aunts and uncle. One of them has just screamed and there are two young girls in the house rapidly on their way to investigate.
**THUMP** https://t.co/nwKqNQ7H4s
She opens it and screams dropping the box, spilling the contents. https://t.co/ys4oazzklO
As they are going through the things that Chris left behind, sorting out what is salvageable to send and what isn't, they come across an unlabeled shoe-box. Karen remarks that it's kinda heavy. https://t.co/p7U61YbSY1
Joined by their second sister, &amp; my two oldest daughters (12 and 7) the 4 siblings began cleaning out &amp; sorting what remained in their mother's house. They spent all day Friday cleaning and sorting. What they found when they got to Chris's room is the subject of our little tale. https://t.co/jYlKmlQmG8
But this isn't about that. This is about the after "party." So buckle up buttercup...
Chris's dad is a ultra conservative, evangelical, straight-laced guy. When my wife called to figure out why the car had been stolen and the house ransacked, she was given the run around. Eventually, my wife, her sister (Karen) &amp; brother, drove out to retrieve the car.
My wife allowed Chris to continue to live in the house for a while and then when a foreclosure notice arrived on the house, Chris decided to loot anything of value and take my MIL's car and disappear to go live with dad in New Mexico. https://t.co/t7LeDwt3EC
My mother-in-law passed away a while back. Not entirely unexpected. She was quite ill. One of her grandchildren, Chris, had been living with my MIL and helping take care of her. After she died everything was left to my wife.
Ladies &amp; gentlemen, I'm going to step out of politics because we all need a laugh. 	It's long, but trust me, it's worth it. It's mildly NSFW...not because of images or language though. Told from my human Dad's point of view.		All names are made up to protect the innocent.

8/ I asked my humans for a Twitter account because I'm determined to fight the battle on the field of the enemy's choosing. So here I am. I will call out the hypocrisy, the lies, &amp; the absurdity of this regime; sometimes with sarcasm, sometimes seriously, but always...
8/ I also realized my new little brother was growing up in a red state where hypermasculinity and this new normal was being lauded. I couldn't let this become the norm.
7/ I realized that my 3 new sisters were growing up in a world where the most powerful position in the world was held by a man who bragged about assaulting and trivializing women - and that other old white men were laughing about it.
6/ When the election happened, my 6yo sister cried. She wanted @HillaryClinton  to win, as did the family. It was shortly after that I noticed the little things that were happening when we watched the news. Nazis being praised, journalists being attacked, &amp; rights being eroded.
5/ My humans spent a lot of time with these 4 new people. I liked the two little ones best...they were constantly dropping food on the floor from their highchairs. I came to love them and them, me.
4/ Then one day they introduced me to a 4th little person. She wasn't sure what to do with me and grabbed my ears a lot. That same day the 3 others moved in. My humans told me that they were going to adopt these 4 and they were my new brothers and sisters.
3/ They were loud and the little one was kinda stinky. But they only came around once in a while. Then my humans emptied my room and took away my couch from the office. They put two beds in the room but wouldn't let me on them at all.
2/ I'm just a dog. I should sniff the grass, chase the evil rabbits, eat out of the trash, counter surf, and be happy, right? Up until about 3.5 years go, I probably would have gone that route. But then my humans started bringing these three little people around the house.

@BenKing253 @WhiteHouse I apologize I misspoke. The market will rise because the middle class and poor generally don't invest. They don't have the money. The market will continue to rise trickling up the wealth to the rich. The stock market is really not a good indicator or economic strength.
@BenKing253 @WhiteHouse Yes because for 7 years the stock market was falling at a record rate daily. It took just over a year for Obama's policies to recover the market, I expect that the same period would take place to crash it again...about the same time that tax bill kicks in.

@CAWeAreMueller @2HawkEye2018 I'm of the same mind! That analogy change from a melting pot to a salad always stuck with me. It felt more right to me. I just love the concept that each immigrant/culture brings a new flavor that on its own is good, but together is amazing without becoming inseparable.
@AmySeeksTruth @realDonaldTrump Apparently it was a "small electrical fire."		I maintain it was the pits of hell opening up...as evidenced by, well, extra evil squirrels in the yard and 45 is still president.
@CAWeAreMueller @2HawkEye2018 I was told once that the melting pot analogy was incorrect. It assumed that we lose our identity &amp; meld together. We are more like a tossed salad.
