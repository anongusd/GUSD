1/1 We are witnessing the daily erosion of American Democracy. The time has come to do more than tweet. Confrontation is the next step. Representatives go to eat, attend church, attend functions hold townhalls, have offices in your district, find out where.
Peaceful Nonviolent Resistance should be our first approach. There are plenty of resources available to learn how. I suggest start with this:	https://t.co/aV1YXtlQuF

@MalcolmNance Frightening times! Having lived through the turmoil of the 60's in the U.S. , that's saying a lot. I remember seeing the numbers tattooed on the forearms of holocaust survivors as a kid and the fear of the riots of the 60's. I think America is lost!

When Trump was elected I expected hatred from the Irish. Instead nobody mentions him. I think they feel sorry for us and are probably worried too.
When I first moved to Ireland I took so much hate for GW Bush. People would first ask "are you Canadian" not wanting to insult, but when I said American they let loose!
I'm embarrassed to say I'm American!
