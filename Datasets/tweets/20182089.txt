You may recall that Barr has said he would “absolutely” guarantee that special counsel Mueller would not be fired without good cause. Barr has also said it would be “unimaginable” for Mueller, the lifelong Repub. and former FBI director, to do anything that would warrant firing
President is presumably delighted that his new AttyGen Barr will not recuse himself from Russia probe as Sessions did. "Senior career ethics officials advised that General Barr should not recuse himself from the Special Counsel's investigation," a DoJ spokesperson says

On This Day. 	1933: Franklin Roosevelt - who had survived an assassination attempt two weeks earlier - rode to the Capitol for his swearing in. He and Hoover - who he crushed with 57% of the vote and 472 electoral votes - could barely speak to one another https://t.co/trBmPx1mmY
On This Day. 	1929: Herbert Hoover was sworn in. What a terrible year it was: the Great Depression began (made worse by tariffs), and on Christmas Eve, the Oval Office was destroyed by a fire https://t.co/tv819BVLKo
On This Day. 	1925: Sworn in for his own term, Calvin Coolidge added a third floor to the mansion  (here under construction), including a cool sleeping porch on the roof. Deeply depressed after the death of a son, he slept around 11 hours a night plus long naps each day https://t.co/YfbOpfdZQR
On This Day. 	1921: Put into office by what remains the biggest winning election margin ever—26.17 points—Warren Harding was sworn in. His administration was riddled with corruption on a grand scale, and his personal life was beyond sleazy. Died 2 1/2 years into his term https://t.co/71LDPBOblH
On This Day. 	1913: Woodrow Wilson was sworn in. Led U.S. through WWI, golfed more than any POTUS (by far). His crippling stroke in 1919 led to perhaps the greatest coverup in presidential history https://t.co/n0wph5Lwve
On This Day. 	1909: William Howard Taft was sworn in. He wanted to be Chief Justice, but his wife wanted him to be POTUS. He eventually got the job he really wanted anyway. Only person to be both POTUS and (years later) Chief Justice https://t.co/DmjyIl6hB4
On This Day. 	1905: Sworn in for his own term, Theodore Roosevelt built the West Wing during his White House years. TR - a top five POTUS - loved, loved loved the job, perhaps more than any other President https://t.co/2KeEXIqA1J
On This Day. 	1897: William McKinley was sworn in. His 1901 murder put Theodore Roosevelt in the White House
On This Day. 	1889: Benjamin Harrison was sworn in. Only grandson of a President. Only one of five to lose the popular vote	1893: Cleveland was sworn in again. Only POTUS to serve two non-consecutive terms and is thus regarded as the 22d and 24th
On This Day.	1881: James Garfield was sworn in. Shot four months later, died two months after that - after sloppy and unsanitary doctors botched his medical care	1885: Grover Cleveland was sworn in. Called the "Buffalo Hangman" because he'd been the executioner of Erie County, NY
On This Day. 	1869: Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in. He was an honest man, but many people around him were not; his administration is regarded as one of the most corrupt https://t.co/dAgxJvCih2

On This Day. 	1861: Abraham Lincoln was sworn in. Regarded as the perhaps greatest POTUS; led U.S. through Civil War. Assassinated five days after it ended https://t.co/LDY1qiEcE7
On This Day. 	1857: James Buchanan was sworn in. Did nothing to stop the approaching Civil War
On This Day. 	1849: Zachary Taylor was sworn in. “Old Rough and Ready” would die a year-and-a-half later. Probably bad White House water suoply (perhaps like Harrison eight years earlier)  	1853: Franklin Pierce was sworn in. Lived a tragic life. All three sons died tragically.
On This Day. 	1841: William Henry Harrison was sworn in. Died a month later - shortest presidential tenure ever 	1845: James Polk was sworn in. Added more territory to the United States in his term than any other POTUS
On This Day. 	1829: Andrew Jackson was sworn in. He was nearly killed in the White House on inauguration day, when a wild party got out of control. The mansion itself was trashed. 	1837: Martin Van Buren was sworn in. First President who was born as an American citizen
On This Day. 	1817:  James Monroe was inaugurated. Only person ever to be Gov., Sen. SecState, Sec.of War - &amp; POTUS 	1825: John Quincy Adams was inaugurated. Only one of two Presidents whose fathers were also POTUS - and one of five to lose the popular vote
On This Day. 	1801: Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated as the third President; he would make substantial changes to the White House itself 	1809: James Madison was inaugurated as the 4th President. He was POTUS when the British burned the White House and Capitol down in 1814 (more)
Adams's swearing was also the first time a president had been sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (Oliver Ellsworth); the inaugural was the only time that outgoing Pres. Washington, VP Thomas Jefferson and Adams ever appeared together at such a high-profile event
The first presidential transition occurred on this day in 1797, when John Adams was sworn in, in this room in Philadelphia's 	Independence Hall. Outgoing President George Washington, who declined to run for a third term, was relieved to give up the burden of the presidency https://t.co/uCY7MIbd5B

Warmbier family blasts Trump for buying Kim’s denial: “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that. Thank you.” /2

U.S. sanctions will remain in place on North Korea, but there is evidence, analysts say, that Russia and China are helping Pyongyang to evade them - a reflection of the growing Russian-Chinese anti-American alliance
President now heading home - several hours early - after collapse of talks. He said a year ago that North Korea was denuclearizing - Kim made it clear today that this is not the case
Trump says Kim was willing to close some - but not all - nuclear sites in exchange for the lifting of all international sanctions. They cancelled lunch and the signing of a joint agreement - as there was nothing to sign
Kim’s comments came after the collapse of talks w/President Trump; their Hanoi talks ended abruptly after they failed to reach a deal on denuclearization. “Sometimes you have to walk,” Trump says
North Korea’s Kim is asked if he’s ‘ready to denuclearize.’ “If I’m not willing do that I won’t be here right now,” he says through translator (his definition of this differs from what U.S. definition)

Delighted that President Trump has decided to honor Independence Day with fireworks on July 4th. Truly innovative and brilliant. What we really need, though, is a day, perhaps in November, to be thankful for all our blessings. And why not something in Spring to honor Mothers?

Of all the movies that Presidents have watched over the years, there's ONE movie - above all - that has resonated more than any other. Can you guess it? (It's named in "Under This Roof," by the way - the 2015 book by WWR's Paul Brandus) https://t.co/gYXZC61UCf

/4	After Carter,  the biggest movie fan was President Eisenhower, who saw some 200 films - mostly Westerns.  #Oscars		Naturally, Ronald Reagan was a movie fan. Did you know that he and Nancy starred in one movie together? Hellcats of the Navy.  #Oscars https://t.co/TwdsBcBc3L
3/	Trivia question: Which president was the biggest movie fan? He watched about 2.5 movies per week during his White House years. #Oscars		Answer: Jimmy Carter - by far. In four years he watched 480 films in the White House #oscars
/2	The White House theater was built for FDR in 1942 from a cloakroom. First film he saw there? Casablanca (which means white house, by the way). Here's what it looks like now: Red velvet decor w/about 40 theater-style seats. #Oscars https://t.co/2W0xxhTEfw

/8	finally, how have the other popular vote losers fared in the history books? A Siena College survey released last week ranks: 	JQ Adams: 18th	Hayes: 32d	Harrison: 35th	Bush (W): 33d	All but Adams are in the bottom third. Trump's initial ranking: 42d	https://t.co/085fkjS3Fl	###
/7	Other than President Johnson, who dropped out in 1968, all other incumbents - Ford ('76), Carter ('80) and Bush ('92) held off their challengers and won the nomination. But all three, weakened, lost in the general election
/6	history also suggests that a weak POTUS can draw a nomination challenge. Examples from the past half-century include: 	1968: McCarthy and RFK challenged LBJ - who dropped out 	1976: Reagan nearly topped Ford 	1980: Kennedy took on Carter	1992: Buchanan took on Bush (HW)
/5	of the four prior popular vote losers, only one was re-elected: 	1) Adams was crushed by Jackson in 1828 	2) Hayes chose not to run in 1880	3) Harrison lost in 1892 to Cleveland (who reclaimed the office) 	4) only one was re-elected: Bush - and not by much (51.7%)
/4	Trump began with a far lower approval than Bush in 2001, and has never gone beyond Nov. 2016's 46% in two poll of polls - RCP and 538. Yet he is close today: 44.3% (RCP) and 42.4% (538)
/3	of the four prior popular vote losers, three—Adams, Hayes and Bush—entered office amid doubts of electoral legitimacy. Yet even Bush, after his 36-day standoff with Al Gore, began with a 57% approval (Gallup)  https://t.co/5LuOKnDqVY
/2	The other four popular vote losers who became President:	John Quincy Adams (1824)	Rutherford Hayes (1876)	Benjamin Harrison (1888) 	George W. Bush (2000) 	What can we learn from them - and what might it suggest about the fifth popular vote loser - President Trump?
Thread	A GOP challenge to Trump is unlikely at this point. He appears to have a firm grip on the party - though a look at the following two things may be instructive: 	1) the other four popular vote losers who became POTUS	2) weak incumbents heading into a re-election cycle

Trump seems to think that the economy and stock market are linked; actually they can go for very long periods of time with little-to-no correlation.	Example: 	Dow 1964: 874. 	Dow 1981: 875. 	Yet over that 17-yr. period, U.S. economy grew 373%. No correlation 	/2

Important to remember that China talks are about much more than trade deficits: cyber theft, intellectual property, forced technoloigy transfer are all huge - and interconnected - topics as well
New round of U.S.-China trade talks begin today here in Washington. Principal-level meetings beginning Thursday. Becauee of what he calls "big progress," Trump has hinted he could extend a looming March 1 tariff deadline by 60 days, though "I'm not inclined to do that"

Tariffs help the economy. At least that's what Herbert Hoover thought, when he urged Congress - this day in 1930 - to pass the Smoot-Hawley bill to raise tariffs on foreign exporters.

Robert K. Preston stole the chopper, a UH-1 Iroquois from nearby Fort Meade, flew to Washington and hovered for six minutes over the White House before landing—just 100 yards from the Oval Office. President Nixon was out of town; no attempt was made to shoot Preston down  /2

Jefferson’s win represented the first peaceful transfer of power between two political parties. The Federalists began to fade; the Democratic-Republican Party grew in stature. 1800 election was also one of the nastiest, setting precedents for smear campaigns and personal attacks

Media that Trump calls "the enemy of the people" is giving him a free, lengthy campaign commercial today - covering his remarks in full, repeating their 2016 practice
Flashback https://t.co/Hd8v8mALtt
Trump says "you don't have to be very smart" to know the truth about the border situation; says "Nancy knows it." Confirms he'll declare a national emergency. Points out that other presidents signed national emergencies and "nobody cared" https://t.co/VacqvU5bmo
President says "we'll confront one way or another" what he calls a "crisis" on Mexican border; he says the claim that drugs come in through legal ports of entry is "a lie" - which itself is a lie https://t.co/NjHFfYIYdN
President, now In Rose Garden, opens by claiming progress on trade talks with China - though claims falsely that China is paying billions in tariffs. No: tariffs are a tax paid by end users (consumers). Talks up Hanoi summit w/North Korea's Kim https://t.co/mzBoooRFEa
It is not biased - but in fact accurate - to note that President Trump has told numerous and repeated lies about border security, immigration, crime, drugs and all the rest. Here: peering into the Oval as we wait for him to come into Rose Garden https://t.co/Y34XJjCe7V
Nice late-winter morning in Rose Garden; President nearly half-hour behind schedule on his budget/border/emergency announcement
Ancillary to all this: the trial of drug kingpin El Chapo - now awaiting sentencing after this week’s NY conviction. Evidence in that trial made clear that the vast majority of drugs pass through legal ports of entry - rendering a “wall” worthless
For all practical purposes, the issue of a wall seems less about border security and more about 2020; Trump made it an issue in 2016 and does not want to be seen as caving - though he’s settling for a lot less money and what by and large will be fencing - not an imposing wall
Senate Majority Leader McConnell recently warned Trump that an emergency declaration would spark a rebellion within the Republican Party. Yet that appears quite  unlikely - and McConnell now says he’ll support Trump’s action
Last year Trump could have had $25 billion for border security; the deal now gives him about 5% of that - largely for fencing and more technology for border enforcement
On the Voice of America radio show (175+ countries) hosted by WWR’s Paul Brandus, panelists agreed that the wall- as Trump once envisioned it- will never get built. But getting a few bucks for a few more miles of fencing will help him tell his 2020 base he’s keeping a promise
After declaring a national emergency, President heads to his Florida resort for a long holiday weekend
President’s 10:00 remarks are expected to detail his plans to declare a national emergency along the Mexican border; he’ll claim, of course, that it’s a huge crisis

Your thoughts on tonight’s State  of the Union?
Some Presidents have a more “dumbed down” vocabulary than others; analysis of speech patterns going back 90 years to Hoover claims Trump addresses people at a fourth-grade level. Before you make judgments, WWR notes that Hoover, on other end of scale, was a poor POTUS https://t.co/Ja1HH7bYXu

The growing entitlements crisis deserves more media coverage, but it's not a visually-appealing story, isn't overly dramatic, lacks discernible heroes/villians and is playing out slowly. Thus not overly suitable for TV news (a profession WWR eagerly left many years ago).
Social Security paid about $1 trillion to 63M people last year. But in decade there will be 80M recipients -who are also living longer. But slowing population growth means fewer younger workers are paying into the system; efforts to cut LEGAL immigration also erodes tax base

/6	Since people cherry pick the data that suits their prefered, partisan narrative, here is what folks will say about today's jobs and unemployment reports: 	Republicans: +304,000 jobs	Democrats: the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% (from 3.9%) 	(Both sides are correct)
/5	So the HOUSEHOLD and PAYROLL surveys - which folks often confuse - can sometimes produce conflicting results, as they did in today's report (this will all be on the final exam)
/4 	When the HOUSEHOLD survey is conducted, folks are asked: Do you have a job? If yes, you're employed, of course. If you do NOT have a job, are you looking? If you're looking, you're counted as unemployed. If you don't have a job - but aren't looking - you're not counted
/3	But the government also has a sampling of households around the country and asks people if they have a job. This is called the HOUSEHOLD survey. And based on that – you get the actual unemployment rate, which last month rose to 4.0%
/2	For example: the government asks companies how many people they had on the payroll during the month. This is called the PAYROLL survey – and from that comes the number of jobs gained or lost. Last month that was +304,000
Why did the unemployment rate go up - after 304K jobs were added to the economy? Of course you're dying to know this, and that's where WWR's Paul Brandus comes in. The simple answer: the two data points - jobs created and the unemployment rate - come from two separate surveys  /1

All Americans should be pleased that the job market continues to grow: 	Last 24 months of Obama: +5,132,000  (Feb. 2015 to Jan. 2017) 	First 24 months of Trump: +4,801,000  (Feb. 2017 to Jan. 2019) 	https://t.co/TYlPDKFw72 …

/3	Unemployment now is 3.9% (we'll get an update Friday), near a 50-year low. And yet Trump's overall popularity is as bad as Reagan, who was dealing with 10.8% unemployment. Trump's worry: If he's this weak in a good economy, what happens when it softens—as data suggests it is?
/2	While it’s true that Reagan’s numbers were low at this stage, it’s essential to add some context. Reagan was low because the U.S. was in a nasty recession in his term's halfway point. Unemployment in Dec. 1982, for example, was 10.8%. The hucksters don't mention this to you

A 2017 @CSPAN survey of historians said that of all 44 (not 45) Presidents, FDR ranked #1 in two key categories: "Public Persuasion" and "International Relations." He ranks no worse than 8th in every other category https://t.co/EfC6OmUy4B

On This Day. 1835: An assassination attempt against Andrew Jackson. His attacker, an unemployed British man, had two guns. Both misfired. The assassination attempt came as Jackson was leaving a funeral at the Capitol. The 64-year old POTUS beat him up with his cane https://t.co/e3vzynTTJU

What is disingenuous/ignorant about commentators like @newtgingrich and @hughhewitt comparing Trump's low numbers with Reagan's at this halfway point: Reagan was dealing with a nasty recession and 10.8% unemployment. Unemployment now: 3.9% and Trump's still in bad shape

It would be an interesting exercise to consider what Trump might have done had he been president in, say 1812, 1861, 1929 or 2008 - pivotal moments in American history. Or Yalta in '45, Berlin '48, Korea '50, Cuban Missile Crisis '62, the KAL shootdown in '83,  9/11 and so forth
President's (false) claim last June that North Korea was denuclearizing and no longer represented a threat has also had the effect of taking economic pressure off Pyongyang: both China and Russia have increased trade and other economic activity - thus propping up the regime

Chatter on @realDonaldTrump's week: 	-another Mueller arrest	-bad TV images of shutdown	-warnings - from his own economic advisor - of "zero" growth in 1q 	-getting outmanuevered on State of the Union	-falling in Fox, Rasmussen polls
1) @RealDonaldTrump was warned by Freedom Caucus that giving in to Pelosi - which Trump did today - will hurt him in 2020. 	2) SC Sen. Graham said this: "He’s not going to sign a bill that doesn’t have money for the wall...that’s probably the end of his presidency."
White House economic advisor Hassett estimates the #shutdown cost an estimated $130 billion (annualized basis) - about .13 percentge points subtracted from growth each week - w/Trump giving in after five weeks
Mueller got Sammy "the Bull" Gravano (L) - involved in 19 mafia murders - to flip on Gambino crime family boss John "Teflon Don" Gotti. But Roger Stone, fan of soft tailoring and comfy Florida living, insists he's a really tough guy who'll never flip on Trump https://t.co/T9DZHrc66M
1) Trump said last month he would proudly shut down the govt. - and own it.	2) But he did not ackowledge any responsibility for it today 	3) He did not apologize for the pain the shutdown inflicted uoon so many American families 	4) He threatened another shutdown Feb. 15
After giving in to Pelosi and Schumer, President again talks tough, saying there could be another shutdown in three weeks - or an emergency declared - if he doesn't get his way. He ignored other Qs as he returned to Oval https://t.co/pR7pIqqlhh
That the President gave in to Pelosi's central demand today - keep the govt. running while we negotiate other matters - fits into a very Trumpian pattern of talking tough upfront, only to wilt later under pressure
It would seem that the last five weeks that have caused so much disruption, stress and economic anxiety for so many Americans - was all for nothing, given that this is only three-week deal. We could be right back in crisis mode come Feb. 15
Border security: Trump is talking in terms of things Democrats have called for: more spending technology, more efficient enforement at ports of entry. But he is also repeating things that seem meant to placate his base
The three week re-opening of the govt. does NOT include money for a wall - meaning Trump gave in - a day after insisting he would never cave. He said "NO CAVE!" the dat before he did just that. Continues to call for a wall, says existing barriers must be beefed up

Sanders says President has been briefed on "the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA.”
Institutional collapse of things (e.g. airline system) reminds WWR more and more of working in Soviet Union/Russia many years ago. Things happen that just boggle the mind; out of touch leaders don't seem to care (let 'em eat cake), citizens are cut off &amp; left to cope on their own
President: shutdown/wall is because your security and safety are important. Yet it has sparked pilot warnings, shortages of air traffic controllers, TSA agents, food safety inspectors, law enforcement warnings re: criminal investigations etc.-all of which threaten safety/security

Aside from giving Marie Antoinette a run for the money with recent "let them eat cake"-like comments (Wilbur Ross, Lara Trump, Larry Kudlow), the administration seems unfamiliar with Federal Reserve data showing that 40% of Americans couldn't even come up w/$400 in an emergency
It’s almost as if it never occurred to Trump or his economic team that cutting off 800,000 workers, plus many, many more contractors - all of whom are spread out across the country - might have an impact on the U.S. economy
Trump brags about the economy - but JP Morgan economists now estimate that because of the #shutdown, 1q economic growth will be sharply lower from a year ago: a 1.75% pace. Trump’s own chief economic advisor is even gloomier - saying growth could be close to “zero”
Critics of Trump could say that given pilot warnings, worker outages by air traffic control, TSA agents, food safety inspectors, warnings by law enforcement that criminal investigations have been thwarted - and much more - that a shutdown-driven national emergency already exists

Stone, of course, goes way back with Paul Manafort - who has pled guilty to felonies, including witness tampering and conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Sentencing set for March
Stone, 66, has described himself as a “dirty trickster,” and those dirty tricks date back to the 1970s, when he worked for Richard Nixon. Stone - up to his neck in legal trouble - probably lacks the money to defend himself (he was forced to hold a “Fund Me” campaign last year)

“We have to understand that the period of U.S. absolute dominance of the air is over.” -Elbridge Colby, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan think tank (in WSJ piece on Russia’s S-400)
Hard to talk with ⁦@KellyannePolls⁩ without thinking of her description in “Team of Vipers” (Photo/WWR) https://t.co/S9hlAFZVv6
It’s almost as if it never occurred to Trump and his economic team that cutting off 800,000 workers, plus many, many more contractors - all of whom are spread out across the country - might have an impact on the U.S. economy
Trump has also bragged about the economy - but JP Morgan economists estimated today that because of the shutdown, 1q economic growth will be a 1.75% pace - a sharp slowdown from a year ago. Trump’s own econ advisor is even gloomier - saying growth could be close to “zero”
Critics of Trump could say that given pilot warnings, worker outages by air traffic control, TSA agents, food safety inspectors, warnings by law enforcement that criminal investigations have been thwarted - and much more - that a shutdown-driven national emergency already exists
It’s possible that Trump would go along with some sort of temporary reopening of the govt.- which could then pressure Pelosi into allowing his State of the Union. The odds of the Speaker going (or falling) for that seem - at best - quite long
President inching closer towards possible “national emergency” over border wall, amid back and forth between him, Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell. Pelosi says partial payment in return for govt. temporarily reopening is a non-starter
Two Senate bills - one pushed by Repubs, one by Dems - have failed to advance in the Senate; but in both instances, crossover votes may reflect a growing impatience with the shutdown standoff, which is now in its second month
U.S. economy has slowed considerably because of govt shutdown, JP Morgan economists say. New forecast for 1q: 1.75% pace
Lara Trump and Wilbur Ross giving Marie Antoniette a run for the money with their let them eat cake comments
Lots of journos want to work at White House, for example. But there is little added economic value in being the 101st person to breathlessly mention the latest minute-by-minute bit of palace intrigue. The yield on one's time improves when you stop trying to be like everyone else
All the journalists being laid off -yesterday was bad- should understand that the biz of disseminating data/content to customers has never been more opportunistic and robust than now. But there is a labor oversupply in some areas - while opportunities elsewhere go unexploited

Full Trump quote on Cohen: 	"I would say he's been threatened by the truth. He's always been threatened by the truth &amp; he doesn't want to do that probably for me or other of his clients. He has other clients also, I assume, &amp; he doesn't want to tell the truth for me or (them)"
You may have heard that Trump's (ex) longtime lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen has put off his scheduled Feb. 7 testimony to Congress because, Cohen claims, he and his family have received threats from Trump and others. Trump now says: "He's only been threatened by the truth."

Congress didn't want voting to interfere with planting season, so Spring and early Summer were out. And voting couldn't interfere with the harvest, so early Autumn was also out. Thus the 1st Tuesday after the 1st Monday in Novenber. Sunday was church, Monday travel, Tuesday: vote
It was decided that voting would occur on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November because this was most convenient for farmers - in the largely agrarian U.S. economy of the mid-19th century. Folks often had to travel a whole day to vote, and Sunday was church /2
This Day, 1845: Congress said that future presidential elections would be held on "the Tuesday after the first Monday in November." It is a badly outdated law today (more)
1) Because of the shutdown, economic growth could be "very close to zero in the first quarter,” White House economic advisr Hassett tells CNN. 	2) Even before the shutdown, the Federal Reserve said growth would slow to 2.3% this year - and weaken further in 2020 - to 2.0%
President says the #shutdown is in the name of your security and safety. Meantime, furloughs include: 	-airport security workers	-meat inspectors	-prison guards	-National Transportation Safety Board inspectors	@realDonaldTrump: "I am proud to shut down the government" (Dec. 11)

Trump’s absolutist, all-or-nothing approach has always run counter to more skilled leaders, who would happily take 50% of what they wanted now - and then come back later for the rest. This partially explains why Trump has gotten nothing yet from N.Korea on nukes or China on trade
Worth reminding folks that Trump could have had $25 billion for border security a year ago. But Trump, using an all-or-nothing approach, also demanded steep cuts in LEGAL immigration as well. So he wound up with nothing

This Day, 1962: The Kennedy administration began “Operation Hades" (later changed to "Ranch Hand”)—a massive effort to defoliate forests of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos with a herbicide that game to be known as Agent Orange. 18-20 million gallons dropped between '62 and '71 https://t.co/cMXugkhcSl
John Tyler, who died this day in 1862, wasn't much of a President, except for this: after succeeding the late William Henry Harrison in 1841, he established the standard of the VP becoming POTUS. The Constitution did not explicitly say this was to be so and there was a dispute
Jefferson asked Congress for $2,500, but in an early demonstration of federal cost overruns, the eventual cost of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition would top $50,000

Important to note amid all of today's Nixon-Trump comparisons: 	1) Nixon would absolutely have been impeached in the Dem.-controlled House (as Trump almost certainly would be if it comes to that)	2) But when the 93d Congress began in 1973, there were only 42 Repub. Senators 	/1

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Syria bombing; the Pentagon has estimated that some 14,000 Islamic State fighters are still in Syria. President Trump claims ISIS has been crushed and has ordered an American withdrawal
Three of the four Americans killed in suicide bombing in Syria have been identified:	-Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, Boynton Beach, Fla.	-Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, upstate NY	-Defense Dept. civilian Scott A. Wirtz, St. Louis, MO
Context: 	Most presidents lie (a few did not). But it is hardly biased - in fact, it is quite factual - to say that what we are seeing with @RealDonaldTrump is beyond comparison. It is not just the sheer number of his lies, but their scope and brazenness. He is the gold standard

This Day, 1994. A sexual harassment suit against a sitting President: Bill Clinton. Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state clerk, claimed that Clinton—while governor of Arkansas—sexually harassed her and then tried to undermine her after she went public with her accusations /1
/4 	Notable that the two most important farewell addresses were given by presidents - Eisenhower and Washington - who spent their careers in the Army. Both warned of having a military that was too big and threatened American institutions and American liberty
/3	Eisenhower knew that America must always be prepared for war. But he was also a fiscal conservative who believed that the American people needed to guard against the “danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.”
/2	Eisenhower told Americans that the U.S. defense establishment was too big, too costly and, iroically, threatened the very liberty it was designed to protect. He added that the U.S. defense industry was profiting off Americans’ national security paranoia https://t.co/zBerN0yHB1

President Hayes, in fact, would have the White House’s first telephone installed; its number was “1.” Sometimes he answered himself (DC's only other phone at the time was next door at the Treasury Dept)
A true high-tech president, Hayes was friends with inventors like Edison and Bell, inviting them to the White House to display their wares. He did so knowing that the attention this would receive would speed the integration of their new products into the U.S. economy   /2

Trump then attacked Dems on border security; says they don’t want to fund it. Worth mentioning that most Senate Dems actually voted to spend $25 billion on border security; Trump turned down the deal because he also wanted cuts to family-based immigration
At Pentagon, President acknowledged the deaths of four Americans in Syria; he didn’t mention ISIS - which he has claimed has been destroyed - but which claimed credit for yesterday’s murders
.@realDonaldTrump has also not said a word about an American citizen - Paul Whelan - who was arrested in Russia three weeks ago. Perhaps the president has laryngitis; WWR recommends hot water with lemon and honey

.@realDonaldTrump has yet to comment on the death of four Americans in Syria, in a bombing that ISIS - which Trump has often said has been crushed - takes credit for
Trump always complained about polls being rigged - yet the one doing the rigging was him. That's according to his right-hand man for 12 years - Michael Cohen - who confirms (to CNN) a WSJ story that says Trump hired a tech guy to rig online polls on his behalf

The Pendleton Act also made it illegal to fire or demote govt. officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on federal property
A big deal that most people don't know about: On this day in 1883, Chester Arthur signed the Pendleton Act, creating the basis for the modern U.S. Civil Service system. It said that federal jobs would be given on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation   /1 https://t.co/ScTNGWfzJ7

Pelosi's gesture today re: SOTU can be seen as a blunt reminder to Trump that:	1) the legislature is co-equal to the executive branch	2) an invitation to speak before a joint session of Congress is a courtesy extended by the Speaker - the House isn't Trump's turf - it is hers
All Presidents live for the State of the Union - a national TV platform to talk for an hour or so, uninterrupted  (first TV broadcast of one was 1947).  Pelosi's suggestion that Trump can just mail his in - the minimal Constituional requirement - would deny him that platform
House Speaker Pelosi tells President that because of the shutdown, the State of the Union should be postponed because of security concerns. Or - and this will absolutely irk Trump - it can be mailed in and not delivered on TV https://t.co/00SWGpNxfd

You should, in fact, stop reading WWR’s tweets, stop watching TV and instead read things like “Common Sense.” This will be on the final exam
The writing of Thomas Paine - who was influenced by thinkers like Locke and Voltaire - would influence Jefferson and Lincoln, among others. Anyone today who may despair at the present situation may find “Common Sense” both refreshing and inspiring

Re: collusion. It would appear that Trump’s campaign manager sharing polling data with the Russians is, to use a phrase that has entered the vernacular, a smocking gun
Ever since Trump personally took credit for lower oil prices, WTI has climbed about 20% on NY Merc - kind of a reverse Midas touch https://t.co/SgpbIACkCC
Trump's claim that he never said that Mexico would pay for the wall is another example of gaslighting:  	1. say somethng dozens of times. 	2. two years later deny saying it.  	3. attack those who call out the lie. 	4. eager supporters amplify the lie on their own platforms.
As for Trump's claim that he never said that Mexico would pay for the wall - thank goodness videotape hasn't been invented, otherwise some young producer might put together a mashup of all the times that he did
As for collusion: 	Trump claims he had no idea that his hand-picked campaign manager - Paul Manafort - was giving polling data to the Russians
Then there is this: 	On saying that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump now claims: 	"Obviously, I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check. I said they're going to pay for it."	(he now says they will through trade deal)
Trump adds it's easier to deal with China than Democrats:  "I find China, frankly, in many ways, to be far more honorable than Cryin' Chuck and Nancy." Adds he won't go to Davos (Switzerland) for World Economic Forum if shutdown continues
President says Repubs are "extremely united" on border wall. Attacks press corps, tells us: “You can all play cute. And I think 80 percent of you are possibly in coordination with the opposition party.”
"Governing by crisis is no way to do the nation's business... dysfunction saps confidence, threatens growth, and consequently poses a threat to opportunity in this country." -U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Donohue, in a speech this AM
Trump thinks border situation is an emergency? In a new @USATODAY column - coming soon - WWR’s Paul Brandus will list some things that really ARE emergencies
/2	Three high profile appearances and attempts to persuade have not moved the needle his way; this, along with growing opposition among some GOP lawmakers, suggests Trump’s power and influence may be waning. If true, the broader implications would be troubling - for him
In the last few days, Trump has tried to persuade Americans on his proposed wall by:	1) making his first briefing room appearance  	2) holding a Rose Garden news conf.	3) making a prime time address 	Three increasingly big appearances - and yet the polls have moved against him
The partial govt. shutdown will become the longest on Saturday. Among things impacted: food safety inspections and mechanical checks on commercial airline jets - to name but two
President departs for border visit shortly - even after saying Tuesday it would be a waste of time. His three hour visit includes a roundtable on immigration and border security in McAllen, TX, then a Border Patrol briefing on the Rio Grande
Federal govt. data shows U.S. coal consumption in 2018 fell to its lowest level since 1979 - even while President Trump tells his base otherwise (Dept. of Energy data)

In talks (WWR's Paul Brandus has spoken at seven presidential libraries), he is often asked to compare Trump with Nixon. There are actually elements of Grant, Harding, Nixon, JFK, Clinton and Jackson. An explanation: https://t.co/IiX00UzGyO
https://t.co/7ZyvmELuDy
Nixon's rivalry with John F. Kennedy has been discussed often. What is less known is how they were actually good friends for years - unti the 1960 campaign. They had so much in common - yet were so different. Excerpt from "Under This Roof," the 2015 book by WWR's Paul Brandus https://t.co/vabMu3BWOd
A 2017 survey of historians by @CSPAN ranked Nixon the 28th best President. His best quality: "International Relations" (10th). Worst: "Moral Authority" (42d) https://t.co/jmIL4f2SSl
Nixon - a staunch Republican - probably imposed more regulations on the economy than any President since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Would be considered - as would Ronald Reagan - a RINO today
Nixon will always be known for Watergate, but his presidency had notable successes. Reached out to China; détente w/Soviets, ended Vietnam war. Domestically, he would have been shunned by today's GOP: he formed the EPA, cut taxes on the poor, raised them on the rich
Richard Nixon was born this day in 1913. The 37th President, served 1969-74. Only President to resign. Just one of two men to appear on a national ballot five times: 1952, '56, '60, '68 and '72; won four of those five times. Can you name the other? Here: Election night 1968 https://t.co/xJom8709gG
1) President describes today's meeting with House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer as "a total waste of time"	2) Schumer/Pelosi say Trump slammed the table and walked out of the meeting
Re: border wall	1) Trump says “We gotta get the politics out of this and go back to common sense”	2) but says he needs to please his base
The “threshold” for declaring a national emergency re: Mex border is if he can’t	make a deal, President says

President heads to Capitol Hill for lunch w.Senate Repubs today; later meets w/Congressional leaders (bipartisan) downstairs in Situation Room
You may have noticed that Trump called the border situation a “crisis” - more accurate than the word his base was hoping to hear: “emergency.” Why is it not an emergency? Perhaps because if it was, the WH could rely on facts and truth - which do not appear to be on its side

5) companies report big labor shortages 	6) if the economy is to grow more workers must enter the labor force (or productivity must improve)   	7) Trump also forgets that 40% of Fortune 500 firms were started by 1st or 2d generation immigrants. Perhaps you owe your job to one 	##
Mini-Thread 	1) 312,000 jobs were added in December; the jobless rate is 3.9%. 	2) seemingly everyone who wants a job has one	3) wages are rising	4) yet the Labor Dept. said just yesterday that there are still 6.9 million job openings https://t.co/VwkuICvYm5
Even commercial airline pilots don't feel safe. This letter to Trump warns that the shutdown - made in the name of safety and security - threatens safety and security https://t.co/2jTmyvF464	#shutdown
1) shutdown was made in the name of safety and security	2) federal safety inspectors - who make sure your airplane is mechanically safe to fly - are deemed non-essential employees, and have been furloughed	#Shutdown
The Drug Enforcement Administration - a federal agency - said in 2015 that the vast majority of drugs come in "through (legal) ports of entry" (and thus a wall wouldn't work). That 2015 report now seems to be missing from the DEA's website
President also said a wall will stop the flow of drugs. Yet the Drug Enforcement Admin. - a federal agency - says Mexican cartels “transport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest Border through (legal) ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers”
Worth noting that immigrants - documented or undocumented - commit far fewer crimes than native-born Americans (Cato Institute) https://t.co/sdsdWCHQnV
President blames Dems for govt. shutdown, even though he himself said he'd proudly own it and accept the blame. Invites Democratic leaders to White House to meet Wednesday
President calls border crisis a "humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, a crisis of the soul." Says women and children are the principal victims; he vows to stop it. Calls his wall "absolutely critical" and "common sense"
Busy day for fact checkers extending deep imto the evening. as President begins speaking
Witch Hunt Update: 	Trump's hand-picked campaign manager, Manafort, fed info to a Russian believed to have ties to Russian intelligence - the special counsel's office believes
It’s not true that half the 312,000 jobs added to the economy in December were fact checkers hired to alert you to everything that President Trump says that is either exaggerated or an outright lie. But there's no question that it is a growth industry - folks will be busy tonight
Reuters/Ipsos: 	1) 51% of Americans think Trump “deserves most of the blame” for the shutdown - up four points from late December 	2) 32% blame congressional Democrats	3) 7% blame congressional Republicans
President Clinton proclaimed 16 emergencies, for example. George W. Bush 14, most of which are still in effect now. Congress has given these powers to our presidents in recent decades - yet has traditionally exercised little oversight for itself
/2 	Emergencies can be declared by proclamation or executive order - giving Presidents extraordinary powers. The spread of a virus with no known cure could spark a hospital emergency, for example. To maintain security, a POTUS can activate the National Guard and seize property
Lots of Presidents have declared emergencies. Dozens of them. Many are still in effect. Carter declared one early in the Iranian hostage crisis (1979) and it's still in effect, for example. So is George W. Bush's post 9/11 state of emergency    /1
London’s Heathrow airport - one of the world’s biggest - closed because of drone concerns; anyone flying to London will face “major disruptions” - always a security fear in U.S. as well, and this as federal employees are hurt by shutdown
WWR doesn't mean to be flip (well not true) but was in Southern California over the holidays, where some folks are quite worried about the border crisis. It seems there's a shortage of avocados coming in from Mexico. There's talk of smuggling them in. It's an emergency https://t.co/uxLA7xCsPr
An American usually heads the World Bank, but no one in their right mind should take the job now, argues Boston University’s @KevinPGallagher, in the @FT https://t.co/Mm8qzBkSi0

President seems to have a knack for talking about commodities and markets at the wrong time - perhaps a reverse Midas touch. Saudis now want to cut production to jack prices back up again; $80+ the target. Presidents should learn that their influence in such matters is limited
/3	"..(and) tens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap assistance, can be afforded them."

“I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration," Lincoln wrote (SOTUs were mailed in back then). "There is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry..."  /2

1) Trump says he spoke with all the former presidents about the need for a wall and claims they agreed with him.	2) Of those four former presidents, the number who say none of that is true: all four
1) President bashes the news media constantly, calls journalists liars and fakes, enemies of the people, says media outlets should be shut down and credentials taken away	2) now asks those same outlets for free airtime - to discuss his wall
Even as Trump believes a security crisis exists on the southern border - polls show most Americans disagree - the group representing thousands of pilots sent him a letter saying the shutdown threatens aviation security
President’s prime time address Tuesday would up the stakes in what he believes is an emergency on the southern border; examples of such prime time drama have included (but are not limited to):	-Cuban Missile Crisis	-Challenger explosion	-Gulf wars	-9/11	-death of bin Laden

Since people cherry pick the data that suits their prefered, partisan narrative, here is what folks will say about today's jobs and unemployment reports: 	Republicans: +312,000 jobs	Democrats: the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% (from 3.7%) 	(Both sides are correct)
/5	So the HOUSEHOLD and PAYROLL surveys - which folks often confuse - can sometimes produce conflicting results, as they did in today's report (this will all be on the final exam, people)
/4 	When the HOUSEHOLD survey is conducted, folks are asked: Do you have a job? If yes, you're employed, of course. If you do NOT have a job, are you looking? If you're looking, you're counted as unemployed. If you don't have a job - but aren't looking - you're not counted.
/3	But it also has a sampling of households around the country and asks people if they have a job. This is called the HOUSEHOLD survey. And based on that – you get the actual unemployment rate, which last month rose to 3.9%
/2	For example: the government asks companies how many people they had on the payroll during the month. This is called the PAYROLL survey – and from that comes the number of jobs gained or lost. Last month that was +312,000
Why did the unemployment rate go up - after 312K jobs were added to the economy? Of course you're dying to know this, and that's where WWR's Paul Brandus comes in. The simple answer: the two data points - jobs created and the unemployment rate - come from two separate surveys  /1
Best years for job growth over the last 11 years: 	1) 2014	2) 2015	3) 2018	4) 2013	5) 2016	(in relative terms, 2014 and 2015 are even more impressive given that U.S. population was smaller than today) https://t.co/GawyfXQ7E1
Unemployment rates rose for men and for blacks in December. Overall: 	Men: 3.6%; Women: 3.5%; Teens: 12.5%; Whites 3.4%; Blacks: 6.6%; Asians:  3.3%; Hispanics: 4.4%   (Overall U.S. rate rose to 3.9%, the broader U-6 rate preferred by many economists held steady at 7.6%)
Job growth	Last 23 months of Obama: +4,837,000  (Mar. 2015 to Jan. 2017) 	First 23 months of Trump: +4,567,000  (Feb. 2017 to Dec. 2018) 	https://t.co/TYlPDKX6YA …
October and November jobs revised upward by a total of +58,000 jobs; last three months have averaged +254,000 jobs

Trump perhaps understands that he will now have to share the stage with Pelosi; former Speaker Ryan (already fading from memory) was quite servile - a bootlicker - towards Trump. Pelosi will be a fierce opponent who won't back down; this will aggravate and frustrate Trump
Behind Trump's briefing room pop up: a realization that in Pelosi, he has a rival - a powerful, poised woman - who has been dealing w/Presidents for decades, and unlike others in Washington, isn't intimidated in the least by his usual tactics: bullying, misogyny and crude insults
President came out after the person who will be a roadblock for much of his agenda over the next two years - Speaker Pelosi - did something that he prefers to do himself: dominate the airwaves. She reminded him today that the legislative branch is equal to the executive branch
The only news from the President's appearance in the briefing room was that he made an appearance = his first - in the briefing room. Spoke of the importance of having a border wall - then left without taking questions. This as the new Congress, with a Democratic House, convened

Latest WWR column https://t.co/cFPYC9C9D2
/20	We will be told more things in 2019. They will likely not be true, either. Most people, who have not been fooled, will see through it all. The question is whether the others—those who are so eager to believe that which is clearly not so—will continue to fool themselves	###
/19	Pew data says people around the world have more confidence in dictator/thugs like China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin than in Trump. So in this respect, Trump's claim is correct: We have never been respected like we are today.
/18	But one thing we were told has turned out to be true. We were told that the United States has never been respected like it is today. That’s true. Confidence in America has plunged, says a global survey by the Pew Research Center.
/17	We were told that all of the investigations are a nothing burger. Yet the indictments, guilty pleas, convictions and jail sentences keep piling up.
/16	We were told that he hires only the very best. Yet those hires—ranging from a once-trusted lawyer to the secretaries of state and defense—are the most critical. Those who know him best, see him up close each day, have the worst things to say. Think about that.
/15	We were told that Social Security was safe. In fact, the administration quietly warns that SS could be slashed 21% by 2034—closer than it sounds—unless something is done. Tax hikes, benefit cuts, and higher eligibility ages are the likely options
/14	We were told that the debt—not the deficit mind you, but the entire national debt—would be paid off in eight years. Instead it has jumped to nearly $22 trillion, and is projected to soar to $33 trillion by fiscal year 2028, now eight years and nine months away.
/13	We were told that farmers are doing great. They are not - bankruptcies are surging. We were told that U.S. Steel is building six new steel mills. The company says it is not
/12	We were told that the stock market was proof of Trump’s genius. The S&amp;P 500 entered a bear market last month. We were told that Mexico would pay for the wall. It isn’t. The president now wants you, the taxpayer, to - and said he’d proudly shut down the govt. if need be
/11	As a percentage of the U.S. economy, it was only the seventh-biggest tax cut. Tax cuts signed by Ronald Reagan (1981), Harry Truman (1945 and 1948), Barack Obama (2010 and 2013) and Lyndon Johnson (1964) were all bigger than Trump's
/10	No raises for most. Cup-of-coffee sized tax cuts for millions. A downward trend in spending on plant and equipment. How can this be? After all, we were told, the tax cut signed a year ago was the biggest ever. The problem: It wasn’t the biggest tax cut ever. Wasn’t even close
/9	This doesn’t mean that nothing was spent. Westwood Capital, the New York investment bank, notes that 28% of business investment has gone to “structures and industrial equipment” this year. Just twenty years ago, at the end of another U.S. expansion, nearly half—48.3%—did.
/8	In the second quarter of last year alone—right after the law was signed—$437 billion was spent on buybacks, says research firm TrimTabs.
/7	We were told that the tax cut would mean a huge boost for investment and growth in the U.S. economy—things like plants and equipment. And yet U.S. corporations spent far more buying back their own stock than anything else.
/6	When big stuff like housing and health care are soaring, an extra $60—$1.15 a week—is meaningless. Perhaps a small cup of coffee once a week at McDonald’s. Nothing more.
/5	We were told that the tax cuts signed into law a year ago would provide a huge boost. Yet the middle fifth of earners got about $950—nice but hardly huge—while the bottom fifth got about $60 - abut $1.15 a week
/4	We were told that most Americans saw their living standards improve last year. And yet 62% of Americans say they didn’t get a raise in 2018. That’s even worse than 2017, when only 52% said they didn’t get one. (Bankrate)
/3	We were told that Americans have never had it so good. And yet 40% of us don’t have even $400 to deal with an unexpected expense.
Last year, we were told by the president that the economy is great. In fact, he boasted, it has never been so great. And yet the 4.2% growth rate of the second quarter faded almost immediately. The Federal Reserve predicts 2.3% growth this year and slightly under 2.0% in 2020. /2
Thread 	As a new year begins, there is a gulf in this country between what some people want to believe and what the truth really is. At some point these two things—truth and untruth—will be reconciled. Perhaps this year, perhaps not. But in the end, truth always wins  /1

Truman left office deeply unpopular, but is today considered (per a 2017 @CSPAN survey of historians) the sixth greatest president. Best qualities: "Crisis Leadership," and "Pursued Equal Justice for All." Worst: "Public Persuasion" and "Relations with Congress" https://t.co/hP7fcQJdAA
The last president w/out a college degree, Truman was known for his honesty and accountability.

Presidential power wanes in many ways; Hoover (‘31-‘32), Johnson (‘68), Carter (‘79-‘80) are all different case studies;  Trump’s growing weaknesses and vulnerabilities are quite unusual to say the least, and may become more apparent to some on the edges of his base
Trump’s power will be further weakened in 2019 as NY investigators and the special counsel continue to probe him, and House Democrats launch a series of investigations; a slowing economy won’t help either: Fed predicts 2.5% growth in 2019 and 2.0% in 2020

Nixon unleashed "Operation Linebacker II," in which B-52s and other aircraft dropped 20K tons of bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong.

The Washington Post was responsible for an embarrassing error while covering President Wilson's romance with Edith. It was supposed to say "entertaining his fiance" https://t.co/NzYhONSqKC
When Wilson was nearly killed by a devastating stroke in 1919, Edith became probably the most powerful First Lady in American history - an acting president almost - and most Americans knew nothing about it. Excerpt from "Under This Roof," the 2015 book by WWR's Paul Brandus https://t.co/qAQ24XPmOk
Woodrow Wilson married wife number two - on this day in 1915. Wilson's first wife, Ellen, died the year before, devastating the president. Introduced by his doctor to Edith Bolling Galt, Wilson quickly fell in love. He was 59, she was 43   /1 https://t.co/IloITeX67b

.@presssec Sanders, who last month distributed a doctored video of the Acosta-Trump dustup, continues to pass judgment on the character and ethics of others
1) Both Cohen and Flynn cooperated w/special counsel 	2) Yet Trump calls the former a rat while wishing the latter good luck 	3) Sanders today claimed (in a 14-min. briefing) the difference is that Cohen is lying about Trump’s mistress payoffs (federal prosecutors disagree)
Two years from now, Trump may tell his (aging, rural white, male) base that the wall wasn’t built because of “Chuck and Nancy.” Yet Republicans controlled White House, Senate and House  for Trump’s first two years and he couldn’t make it happen
Given the approx $21 billion cost of a wall (as Trump envisions it), the refusal of even Republicans to pay and the timelines involved, it stands to reason that @realDonaldTrump’s signature 2016 promise - a “big beautiful wall” - will not happen      https://t.co/XQ4lg9MzbX

36 months in prison - that's the sentence for Michael Cohen, for 12 years Donald Trump's personal lawyer. "A veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct...a serious offense against the United States," Judge William Pauley says. Trump has also been implicated in some of his crimes
Cohen, moments before his sentencing: 	"Today is one of the most meaningful days of my life. I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired."
Cohen in court just now: "Recently the President tweeted a statement calling me weak and it was correct but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds."
Ahead of Cohen's sentencing, I asked Trump recently why, if his long-time attorney was such a bum, he was kept on the payroll for 12 years - and had him do his dirty work. Trump: "He did me a favor a long time ago" (apparently removed folks from board of a NY apartment building)

/9	Millions of Americans jobs depend on foreigners having confidence in America, and investing here - and when that confidence is wobbly, as it is now, that capital shifts elsewhere. People who say who cares what a bunch of foreigners think aren't thinking themselves.  ##
/8	Why the -40% plunge? The Organization for Intl Investment, a trade group that represents U.S. subsidiaries of overseas corps: “a response to import tariffs and other trade actions from (Trump) as intl. companies hit the pause button on potential investments” That means jobs
/7	Let’s follow the money once again. Here's how much foreigners have invested in the U.S. in recent years:  	2015: $482B 	2016: $486B 	But in 2017? That figure plunged to $292 billion, a drop of 40%. Preliminary data shows it falling further this year.	 https://t.co/7gX14m3JjN
/6	Also: some 6.8M Americans work for a foreign employer (2015 data), https://t.co/8ivo0QYPK5 so tracking foreign investment in the United States is more than a mere academic task. Foreign companies invest here when conditions are good, and and when uncertainty is minimized
/5  This isn’t the administration’s fault; manufacturing, as a percentage of U.S. jobs, peaked after WWII. But its claim that tax cuts would spark a robust manufacturing revival hasn't panned out. A modest boost, perhaps—but one set against a much larger opposing trend
/4	Instead, the bulk of U.S. business investment now—52%—has gone into things like technology and intellectual property, which create value—just look at the long-term stock market gains of tech giants like Apple, Apple and Microsoft—but not jobs.
/3 According to data compiled by New York investment bank Westwood Capital, just 28.6% of business investment has gone to “structures and industrial equipment” this year. Twenty years ago, at the end of another U.S. expansion, nearly half—48.3%—did
2/	and foreign investors think twice about investing in America. But don’t take my word for it, just follow the money. On the first point, capital spending, consider this: Trump boasted that corporate tax cuts would mean huge huge investment in the U.S. economy. It hasn’t worked

The four eulogies for President Bush... https://t.co/EzIkal3pSY
On This Day, 1992: George H.W. Bush sent 1,800 Marines to Somalia, part of a multinational force that was trying to restore order in that war-torn country. Ten months later, 18 Americans died when two Army Blackhawks were shot down. President Clinton soon ordered a withdrawal https://t.co/0SbbzYhGkT
The handgun used by Reagan's would-be assassin, John Hinckley, was easily bought at a Tennessee pawn shop. Reagan later backed the Brady Bill and an assault weapons ban
After former Beatle John Lennon was shot to death, President-elect Ronald Reagan said - on this day in 1980 - that he still opposed stronger handgun laws. Three months later Reagan—by then president—was shot and nearly assassinated (more)
A White House wedding: On this day in 1967, Lynda Bird Johnson, 23, married Marine Captain Chuck Robb, 28. Robb later went on to become a Senator and Governor of Virginia https://t.co/lzFXMm3Wy6
On This Day, 1950: With the Korean War underway, Harry Truman banned U.S. exports to Communist China. The Chinese had just entered the war, launching a surprise attack that took American forces by surprise. Things were so bad that Truman contemplated using nuclear weapons
The first full day for the United States in World War II - this day in 1941 - and 	President Roosevelt got this intelligence report. He also warned Americans to brace for a long conflict. The war—the second-deadliest in American history—would last for three years and eight months https://t.co/CrTyR8NSWw

Being asked to be the chief of staff to the president of the United States is typically a career-making move - the opening of a door to a life of power, influence and future wealth. That a 36-year old guy said no to Trump - he wants to spend more time w/his family - says much
Trump pushed chief of staff Kelly out, thinking he had Nick Ayers lined up to replace him. But news reports this afternoon indicate that Ayers, the 36-y/o chief of staff to VP Pence, said no thanks

The tradition of delivering a State of the Union in person only goes back to 1913, when Woodrow Wilson decided that he would read it to lawmakers himself. These days, no president would pass up an opportunity to have a national audience
The first State of the Union - on this day in 1801. Thomas Jefferson mailed it in, setting the standard for more than a century. It was read to Congress by a clerk in the House of Representatives. It reflected Jefferson’s love for simplicity and dislike of ceremony   /1 https://t.co/S0LMoVa20n

After Priebus and Kelly, Trump is now on his third chief of staff in less than two years. Which brings us to this tweet of his from 2012: https://t.co/5Veeg8svAO
Kelly's departure underscores one common thread among most Trump staffers: those who work for Mr. Trump do not leave with their reputation intact
/3	One by one, Trump is weeding out those w/institutional knowledge and experience - and replacing them with assorted bootlickers who are less likely to tell him what he does not wish to hear. The President places a premium on servility while discounting experience and wisdom ##
/2	Two years ago, Trump, then the president-elect, surrounded himself with generals: National Security Advisor McMaster, Homeland Security Sec. Kelly (who soon became CoS) and SecDef Mattis. Only Mattis remains - and he has had problems w/Trump as well
As expected, White House chief of staff John Kelly - the retired four-star Marine Corps general - will leave his job by ther end of the year; President didn't announce a replacement, though 36-year old Nick Ayres, the chief of staff for VP Pence, is said to be the front-runner

Trump cannot seem to process the fact that federal prosecutors (southern district of NY) bluntly state his (as "Individual 1") direct role in ordering the payoffs of his mistresses

Tonight's news may also be bad for Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law. Flynn, who we now know has been very cooperative with Mueller, attended a Dec. 2016 meeting w/Kushner - during which Kushner, reports say, proposed a secret comms backchannel to Russia's ambassador
The bad part for Trump - perhaps quite bad - is how Mueller notes, for the first time, how helpful Flynn has been with its “investigation concerning links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.”- i.e. collusion
/3	Flynn was fired as Trump's national security adviser in Feb. 2017 - three weeks into the job - after the White House said he lied about his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Kislyak. One of five Trump aides to plead guilty, he has, apparently, given Mueller everything

One thing cannot be doubted: Polk was easily the hardest-working President in American history. He took only a handful of days off, worked seven days a week, delegated almost nothing. The ultimate micro-manager

/3 	@RealDOnaldTrump's seeming aversion to innovation and risk-taking (i.e. $GM) perhaps helps explain his seeming preference for the America of yesteryear: coal - for example - and his scoffing at things like solar power. The horse and buggy industry must be saved
/2	It's politically not possible, but from a business perspective, Trump should encourage innovation and risk-taking; perhaps he should read up on GM's Alfred Sloan? And perhaps Ford (which is getting into the scooter business) should play it safe and stick with the Model T?
For a businessman, @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to get the theory of creative destruction - which $GM is exemplifying with its plant closures. Companies must always look to the future, anticipate where the market is headed and position itself accordingly   /1

@RadioFreeTom @noonanjo .@Radiofreetom @Noonanjo When I worked in Moscow many years ago (before/during/after the Soviet collapse), I had Russian friends who just couldn't believe that things like break-ins, buggings and tapings could cause the downfall of someone so powerful as an American president
@RadioFreeTom @noonanjo .@RadioFreeTom's observation is good and it may be worth adding that the Soviets considered Watergate a hardline plot to destroy Nixon because of his policy of detente; it was inconceivable that what they thought was merely low-level corruption could actually destroy a president

The assassination of President Kennedy sent shockwaves around the world and brought America to a halt for three unforgettable days. It is often said America lost its innocence that day, and ushered in a difficult era that included Vietnam and Watergate
Three of the most definitive books on the assassination—William Manchester's "The Death of a President," Vincent Bugliosi's "Reclaiming History" and Gerald Posner's "Case Closed"—make the case that Oswald, and Oswald alone, planned and carried out President Kennedy's murder
The killing of Oswald, by a shady nightclub owner named Jack Ruby, sparked talk of a JFK conspiracy that has never abated, though to this day no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced that one existed
As JFK's casket lay in the back of Air Force One, Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President. A 24-year old man, Lee Harvey Oswald, was quickly arrested and charged with the President's murder—and that of a Dallas policeman—but was himself gunned down two days later
One of the blackest days in American history: on this day in 1963, John F. Kennedy was murdered as he rode in an open car in Dallas.

In California, after surveying the devastation from the fire, President Trump was asked if it had changed his mind on climate change. “No, no,” he said
Of the California fires, President, in a commonly used phrase for him, said “Nobody would have ever thought this could happen,” yet data shows fires are growing in frequency and duration
President saw widespread devastation from fires; smoke “grew considerably thicker” as pool approached. Construction crews &amp; first responders wore masks; President, aides and other officials did not wear masks. Yard after yard of homes burnt to the ground. Trump: “Very sad to see”

Nixon's 1972 voting card. His re-election - on this day that year - had little drama; he was riding high in the polls, was winding down Vietnam, had made historic visits to China and the U.S.S.R., and had a weak opponent. A matter called Watergate had yet to become an issue https://t.co/sLtCtxwjUC

1) Trump won West Virginia by an incredible 42 points in 2016 	2) made eight campaign trips there (it's a pretty small state) 	3) repeatedly trashed Democratic Senator Manchin	4) Manchin won re-election by 4 points
Folks @realDonaldTrump personally campaigned for: 	1) Won in FL, MO, IN, OH, TX, TN, IA, KY, NC, GA	2) Lost in NV, WI, WV, MI, KS, MN, PA	(races undecided: AZ, MT)
1) three states that Trump flipped in 2016 - Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - all elected Dem. Govs. (Wolf in PA was an incumbent)	2) deep-red Kansas - which Trump won by 20 points in 2016 - elected a Dem. Gov., a defeat for Trump's vote-fraud conspiracist Kobach

Wednesday: For second day in a row, no public events on President’s schedule https://t.co/RHhyYPzfvR
Of places where Republicans lost, Trump pre-spun it over the weekend, saying he couldn’t be everywhere. But it’s also noteworthy that he campaigned to a narrow base - visiting only areas that are heavily white, more rural than urban, etc.; he didn’t (couldn’t) expand beyond this
Other takeaways: numerous districts that Trump won easily in 2016 are being flipped by Dems; even deep red Kansas elected a D Governor. But Trump can (and will say) that most of the places he personally campaigned in - FL, IN, etc. - paid off  /1
There is no question that life is about to get more difficult for Trump; one half of Congress will actively oppose him at every turn and investigate him every which way. Q is how the president (despite being a "stable genius") will adjust and deal with (presumably) Speaker Pelosi
The imcoming chairman of House Intelligence Comm. will likely be Rep. Adam Schiff, who has spoken of, among other things, investigating alleged money laundering by Trump (and or associates) for Russian mobsters; he will also move to protect the Mueller investigation
Democrats have quietly kept a list of all the investigations they would pursue if they took the House - and, projections say, they have. There are enormous implications for all sorts of things, not the least of which is the Russia probe  /1
Republican control of Senate until at least Jan. 2021 means the possibility of additional Supreme Court nominations for Trump/McConnell. Oldest justices now are two liberals: Ginsburg (who turns 86 in March) and Breyer (80)

The possible loss of the House for Republicans would continue a pattern for sitting presidents:  	- Repubs took House in 2010 (POTUS: Obama)  	- Dems took House in 2006 (POTUS: Bush) 	- Repubs took House in 1994 (POTUS: Clinton)
Democratic control of the House - which appears increasingly likely tonght - would mean all sorts of investigations into President Trump, and a check on his agenda for the next two years; it would also mean that Democrats will now share the blame for things
As expected, Republicans will almost certainly hang on to the Senate - and will likely add to their slim majority. The Democratic path was thin to begin with and has narrowed even further
1.4M restored votes in Florida - who will they vote for in 2020?

On This Day, 1900: William McKinley was re-elected. In a rematch with his 1896 rival William Jennings Bryan, McKinley—the 25th president—won 51.6% of the popular vote and 292 electoral votes. He had a new Vice President: 42-year old Theodore Roosevelt https://t.co/LwhFxxU1R1
On This Day, 1860: With the Civil War brewing, Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th president. The Illinois Republican won 39.8% of the vote and 180 electoral votes in a four-man race https://t.co/WmgEGyCSKu
Awfully early, but Eastern results thus far, notably in Florida’s two big races (Gov/Senate) and two key House contests in Virginia look encouraging for Dems; Trump Jr. has taken to Twitter asking folks in Florida to step it up

WWR often sees Republicans say things like "We're the party of Lincoln, We freed the slaves." Mr. Lincoln's party vanished long ago. Ronald Reagan's son Michael says his Dad - president just 30 years ago - wouldn't recognize today's "GOP" and couldn't win today

Americans have seen this "enemies of the people" trope before. "I have here in my hand a list of 205...members of the Communist Party," said Joe McCarthy, who "are still working and shaping policy in the State Dept." But McCarthy was merely a U.S. Senator (Feb. 9, 1950) https://t.co/u8ETF86fkT

The synagoge killer said "all Jews must die." They were what he was not: decent, loving God-fearing people. And they had names: 	(via @AviMayer) https://t.co/k76guBn3wJ
It does seem odd to:	1) spend years maligning others	2) encourage followers to “knock the crap” out of others	3) chant “lock ‘em up”	4) say the “2d Amendment people” can take care of Clinton	5) call others “enemies of the state”	...and then say what we need is civility and love
.@presssec and yet the synagogue killer was also motivated - per his own social media postings - by talk of the "caravan" in Latin America, a pot that has been eagerly and repeatedly stirred by the president https://t.co/B4XTkrwsxK
/7	And here was the president of the United States, that very afternoon, with the nation stunned by yet another senseless massacre—in a house of God no less—cracking a joke about his hair.  ##
/6	Later, an FBI agent, Robert Jones, called it the “most horrific crime scene” he had ever seen in his 22 years with the bureau. The victims, he said, were “brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith.”
/5	It was 9:53, and when the alleged assailant was done, in addition to the dead, six others—including four police officers (good guys with guns) and two others—had also been shot.
/4	In case that wasn’t enough to polish off the parents, grandparents and others who had come to celebrate a new life, he also had at least three handguns. Shouting anti-Semitic slurs, he began firing.
/3	It was a chilly morning, just 43 degrees, and a light rain was falling, when a man burst in, his finger on the trigger of an AR-15-style assault rifle.
/2	Back East, in a Pittsburgh synagogue—Tree of Life Congregation, it was called—eleven people lay dead, their crumpled bodies cool and stiff. Hours later they had been celebrating the most joyous of occasions, a bris—a ceremony to mark a child’s birth.

Fair Q: @RealDonaldTrump downplays what he calls the "bomb stuff." 	But how might he and his base have characterized it if the alleged bomber wasn't a big Trump supporter?
1) Trump's upset at coverage of what he dismisses as the "bomb stuff."	2) as if attempted bombings of ex-presidents isn't news 	3) he wants more coverage of the "caravan" - people he's convinced are out to hurt us 	4) but none of a pro-Trumper who IS here trying to bomb people
Two years in, half of the 700 top jobs that were supposed to be filled by Trump remain vacant. And the administration’s difficulty in filling lower-level jobs means that many are still being done by Obama-era holdovers. Recruiting people to work for Trump remains difficult

/18	Plus, the #1 provider of what oil we do need to import comes from our friends in Canada. And yet Trump bashes Canada, while praising the Saudis - who produce terrorism and murder journalists? Perhaps Trump could learn that it is in America's best interest to do the opposite #
/17	“Am I supposed to dislike them?” then-candidate Trump asked in 2015. Why shouldn't we? Conditions have changed; we don't need the Saudis like we used to. The fracking revolution and the boom in renewables over the past decade has brought us closer to energy independence
/16	After all, Khashoggi was a particularly harsh critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the now tarnished golden boy who dreamed of reforming the Saudi economy.
/15	I think this helps explain why Jamal Khashoggi was murdered three weeks ago. The royal family is worried about unrest. It needs to keep a lid on things. That means crushing dissent, and apparently that means chopping up a provocative journalist with a bone saw.
/14	That's a lot of young, disaffected, repressed, unemployed people sitting around. 	In other words, conditions similar to the Arab Spring revolts of a decade ago now exist in Saudi Arabia itself. What might happen?
/13	Political oppression has always existed in Saudi Arabia, but everyone was always paid off. But now, the government is cutting back. The CIA estimates that 44% of the population is under the age of 24, and the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 is a staggering 32.6%
/12	To soak up this red ink and curb iut deficit, the royal family has cut subsidies for water, electricity and gasoline and introduced a sales tax of 5%. Not surprisingly, this has angered many citizens, who fear the gravy train is ending.
/11	The problem is that the money is running out. The Saudi economy shrank -0.7% last year, after rising just 1.7% the year before. If you think America’s budget deficit is a problem (3.9% of GDP last year and projected to hit 4.7% in FY 2019), consider Saudi Arabia’s 8.3%.
/10	Free healthcare. Free schooling. No income tax. Public pensions 90% of Saudis work for the government). Subsidized water, electricity and gasoline. Why would Saudis revolt? Against all those freebies?
/9	Numerous governments fell. It contributed to Syria’s ongoing civil war. But Saudi Arabia emerged unscathed, because its citizens didn’t revolt. There was little reason to. The royal family has long used its petro dollars to buy them off
/8	But that was then. Now, and beyond the view of most Americans, the royal family's power is waning. They are in trouble at home—and have growing reason to fear their own citizens. Remember the Arab Spring—the uprisings that swept across the Middle East a decade ago?
/7	Prices quadruped, gas stations ran dry, and the U.S. economy fell into a steep recession. It was so bad that the Nixon administration considered invading Saudi Arabia to seize its oilfields. That’s how bad it was. For half a century, the Saudis have had us over a (oil) barrel
/6	Since the end of WWII, Saudi crude has helped lubricate Western economies. But not always. After Arab nations launched a surprise attack on Israel in 1973, we came to Israel’s aid—and the Saudis and other oil exporters immediately hammered us with a crippling oil embargo
/5	The Saudis also claim to be anti-ISIS, their quiet funding of Islamic extremism not withstanding. It's the mother of all contradictions. But the principal reason we have always looked the other way, of course, is oil
/4	Saudi Arabia serves as a regional counterweight to Iran, for instance. In this respect, the Saudis and Israel—normally the strangest of bedfellows—find common ground (Saudi and Israeli diplomats consult quietly and on a regular basis about the Iranian threat)
/3	But don't think that failing to stand up to one of the world’s worst, most repressive regimes makes Trump unusual. For decades, American presidents have chosen to ignore, or at least downplay, Riyadh's brutal behavior because of broader, strategic concerns
/2 	And never mind that the Saudis, for years, have used their vast oil wealth to spread Wahhabism—its toxic, ultraconservative brand of Islam in schools, mosques and all the rest—which in turn has inspired Al Qaeda, ISIS and other Sunni terrorists
Thread (part of upcoming column) 	Trump says protecting Americans is his top priority, yet left the Saudis off his mostly-Muslim travel ban—designed to keep, as he says, bad people from coming here to kill us. Never mind that 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudis	/1

Some historians think Gorbachev was anxious for Reagan to drop SDI because the U.S.S.R. could not keep up with U.S. military technology or military spending. The Soviet economy was buckling during the 1980s; it collapsed in '91 (right after WWR's Paul Brandus moved there to work)
At one point, Reagan offered to eliminate all ballistic missiles within a decade—while reserving the right to deploy strategic defenses. Gorbachev proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons within a decade—if Reagan dropped SDI. The president, briefly tantalized, said no  /3
Reagan and Gorbachev met to continue talks about cutting intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe. The summit collapsed when Gorbachev proposed limiting America’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); Reagan offered to share SDI's technology - but would not abandon the program

/3 	In percentage terms, Trump won 57% of the electoral college, ranking 46th out of 58 elections. In terms of popular vote margin, he ranks 47th out of the last 49 elections. Yet there are those who automatically believe - and never question - his claims of a "landslide"  ##
/2	.@RealDonaldTrump got 306 electoral votes, the biggest EV win in (drumroll) 4 years. Not since Obama way back in 2012 has a POTUS racked up so many EVs. Obama got 332. In 2008? 365. So if Trump calls his 306 a “landslide,” what does he call Obama’s bigger back-to-back margins?
Working on a new project concerning the electoral college. Worth remembering how delusional @realDonaldTrump is about his win. He claimed it was a “landslide,” in fact, he boasted in a Feb. 2017 news conference, it was “the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.”   /1

There are reasons, many reasons, that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt both rank among the top four greatest presidents (2017 #CSPAN survey of historians), trailing only Lincoln and Washington. Always worth watching Burns’s film; particularly today

The U.S. war in Afghanistan, in fact, has lasted longer than the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea, and most of Vietnam - combined
From 7 Oct. 2001 through today, Operation Enduring Freedom has claimed the lives of 2,414 Americans and 1,141 U.S. allies - an important data point for those who question America's increasingly go-it-alone view with regard to world affairs. The war now begins its 18th year
/3	In 2001 the U.S. considered seven nations terrorist states: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. In 2006, Libya was removed from the list. In 2008, the Bush administration also removed North Korea - even AFTER it tested its first nuclear weapon
2/	The goal of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Bush said, was to crush the Taliban and al-Qaida, the Islamic terror group behind the 9/11 attacks. Bush warned that America would take the war on terrorism to any country that sponsored or harbored terrorists
The U.S. war in Afghanistan is now in its 18th year. It began on this day in 2001, when George W. Bush - speaking 26 days after Islamic terrorists attacked New York and Washington - announced the launch of “Operation Enduring Freedom /1 https://t.co/zkUGgUhysT
/2	Underground nuclear tests would be allowed, as no radioactive debris fell beyond the boundaries of nations conducting the tests. The U.S., Britain and Soviet Union also pledged to work towards complete nuclear disarmament, a goal that has proven to be elusive
On This Day, 1963: John F. Kennedy signed a Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The pact with Britain and the Soviet Union—the only other nuclear powers at the time—capped eight years of negotiations, resulting in a ban of weapons testing in the atmosphere, space and underwater https://t.co/X6hGYNoD3M
/3	Critics said FDR could have bombed railroad tracks that led to death camps, but FDR thought the fastest way to stop the Holocaust was to win the war as quickly as possible—by bombing Germany itself  (Here: reconaissance photo of Auschwitz w/smoke from burning bodies) https://t.co/Fzn5HkJ3f3
Roosevelt died before World War II ended, of course, but the Nuremberg Trials—a series of military tribunals—prosecuted 22 top Nazi officials. Roosevelt was later criticized by some for not doing more to stop the direct extermination of Jews  /2
On This Day, 1942:  President Roosevelt vowed to try Nazis for war crimes. Learning of atrocities against Jews in Nazi-controlled Europe—the Holocaust—FDR said “the ringleaders responsible for organized murder” would be held accountable  /1
People often bristle when told that their party has moved far from the middle. Yet the fact is both Republicans and Democrats - both - have slowly but surely done just that (Pew Research data comparing 1994 w/2017) https://t.co/tq8RLLg75s
Often people bristle when told that their party is being dragged far to one side. Yet data continues to show a steady deterioration of the middle, as Republicans move further to the right and Democrats to the left https://t.co/UDeiSZ1kls
Evergreen Tweet (fill in the blanks) 	President's campaign rally in (Kansas) featured: 	1) numerous falsehoods, also known as lies, on (variety of subjects)	2) excessive displays of (hubris)	3) attacks on (media)	4) the (almost all-white, older) crowd loved it
China is flexing its muscles on Interpol, as are the Saudis w/what appears to be the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the past, a robust U.S. administration with a determination to lead and respect for global order would have spoken up. Nothing thus far from White House
/2	In turn, the Democratic party has its own identity issues; those who reserve criticism for Republicans for abandoining moderation should acknowledge that Democrats have been dragged far to the left. Moderates/independents in the middle are largely abandoned
The Republican party was the party of Lincoln, McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Those who gather under that name today should stop claiming to be what they are not - and call themselves something else. But what?

Also worth noting: 	In 17 years, two presidents who lost the popular vote (Bush did win it in '04), have put four of nine justices on the high court. Bush is long gone and Trump could be in two years - yet their influence, via their appointees, will endure through mid-century
Philosophically speaking, there are now five votes that could view things like Roe v. Wade, affirmative action and certain rights of criminal defendants as unconstitutional (among other things)
Some historians say this will be the most conservative Supreme Court since the 1930s - when justices drove Franklin D. Roosevelt crazy w/their steady opposition to his New Deal programs. FDR tried to "pack the court - expand it beynd nine members, which met with howls of protest
/2	The court made 63 decisions in its last term. Of those, 19 were 5-4 rulings. "Swing vote" Kennedy voted with conservatives (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) 14 times. He voted with the liberal justices (RBG. Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) zero times (SacBee analysis)   ##
You may think that #Kavanaugh replacing Kennedy (who was considered the "swing vote" on the Supreme Court) will result in a major shift to the right. Yet it's worth noting that Kennedy - in the courts last term that ended in June - voted consistently with conservatives    /1
Age of Supreme Court Justices:	Five conservatives: Avg. age 61, Median age 63	Four liberals: Avg. age 71, Median age 71
It is worth noting: 	The two oldest members on the Supreme Court are both liberal Clinton appointees: 85-year old Ruth Bader Ginsburg - who has fought cancer in the past - and 80-year old Stephen Breyer. President Trump could easily get another appointee - in this term
Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed for the Supreme Court, emerging victorious after a bruising, ugly fight. His elevation swings the court decisively right, and at 53 could serve for decades

Investors like it when companies buy their own stock - because it reduces the number of shares outstanding, thus boosting earnings per share. But using capital this way cuts into things like R&amp;D, plant expansion, etc. Buybacks can also mask problems, like slowing growth
