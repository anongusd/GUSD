@MrTommyCampbell @realDonaldTrump Lol .Precisely I cant see the Republicans supporting him much longer . I think he is only running in 2020 so he will not be indicted . After Believing Kim over the Otto Murder by North Korea . It boggles the mind
@AronEisenberg Exiled them to Talos  4 . Not a bad idea .
@TheRickWilson If I had my way my house would be just like this
@WilliamShatner I met Jimmy right after The Search For Spock .
@hitRECordJoe But what if your a scuba diver and live a lot of your life Under the Sea . Trust me down there is better and wetter . Take it from me

@GeorgeTakei @Starbucks Why ?? George I did not hear anything except that he knows he will not win the race . No political  experience . I thought he was not even in the running ?

@HuffPost This woman is crazy !!!
@dwnews No they made their choice !!
@Pontifex I Agree 100% . I wish God would stop the horrifying animal hunting in Africa . The mass killing of elephants and lions and rhinos is a crime against God !!
@MailOnline Stupid !! Kids are no animals at the zoo . All kids love cheese slices !! It‚Äôs all innocent but what kind of manners are you teaching your kids ?
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @BBCNews @bbcrussian @TheSun @dailytelegraph @Daily_Express @DailyMirror @guardian @standardnews British Intelligence is the Best in the world . Please!!  No matter what you print . NOBODY BELIEVES ONE WORD !!!! Start Admitting or at least Stopping these criminal acts on foreign soil !!!
@jamieoliver Love love love this . Great brunch dish simple too make and elegant too the palate üëçüëç
@tommydidario @EvaLongoria @GioBenitez Very cool
@NewJerseyOAG @GurbirGrewalNJ @OCPONJ It‚Äôs about time
@GovMurphy @NJDOT_info Good that‚Äôs important . Because no weatherman is giving an exact forecast . Also I found more info on the Felon MCPO and his Detective and their Felonies they committed against . Also I was lied too by OCPO . The felony was real . Is their an honest State Prosecutor?#Which County
@njdotcom What About Termination Process ?? Terminate  The Felon  MCPO Andrew Carey .
@ConanOBrien Why ??? Did you buy the wings on clearance ????
@ProudResister I like Kamala  very much too . Super intelligent with real common sense and someone who cares about people . Plus she laughs . When was the last time Trump laughed or giggled . It‚Äôs not normal . He is a very unhappy person . We need positivity in the White House
@mchooyah My fancy super dooper retro toaster is right next too my sink . I never got a shock ??? But with my high voltage electrifying personality a little shock would not register
@tommydidario @ananavarro I told her to just breathe . She knows me too . From  Ken Rosato  too Jimmy Kimmel everyone knows me  . ABC should hire me too be a political correspondent. I would not definitely bring in viewers and ratings  thru the  roof . Tell Gio I said Hola
@ananavarro Congratulations. Just Breathe and you will be fine .
@njdotcom This is so common it‚Äôs incredible it is in the news . Only because super rich people are involved . The King Spa on Rt #166 in Toms River is the exact same type of business . Everyone knows but the police keep quiet about it
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Darth Bezos is a cheap greedy POS !! He cares nothing for his employees and treats them like slaves on a plantation . These facts need to be known world wide. Amazon Headquarters would never survive in NYC . The world would know and will mark the end of Amazon
@WPBF25News She is adorable

@jamieoliver Blueberries or strawberries with maple syrup . I saw the majority is lemon and sugar . Never heard of before it must be a British thing . Love pancakes . I make once a week
@ThePerezHilton @THR After Avengers in April time too let the super hero movies rest for a couple of years . Time for s movie other than that . Hollywood has become only about money maker blockbusters not great well written movies just cookie cutter successes
@willchamberlain JR &amp; Bobby Ewing
@people Arrest and imprisoned the owners
@greggrunberg Well every Friday night back in 1979-1985 Bo &amp; Luke Duke out ran  Sheriff Roscoe P Coltrane and Jefferson Davis Hogg
@hitRECordJoe Donald Trump Was Indicted
@KellyO Long trip . Hope you had  descent inflight  movies too watch
@TheSun He deserves the death penalty
@FOX29philly He deserves the death penalty
@RealRonHoward @BrianGrazer Happy Birthday Ron
@elainaplott Donny Jr is a moron !!! Nobody wants too see or hear from him . He is not even good enough to be picked for the White House . If he was Daddy Trump would have gave him a job
@jimsciutto ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èlove this
@TheSun Pure murder
@tommydidario Enjoy the Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è and warm weather
@GovChristie @KenDilanianNBC Governor Christie is as  much as crook and liar  as Trump and I can prove it
@ThePerezHilton Perez you know what‚Äôs going on . I trust your reporting .
@TheSun He should get life in prison
@DebraMessing Totally Agree
@ProudResister @RepCummings @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz Totally Agree
@GovMurphy Who is paying for the tax breaks !!! Where is the money coming from?
@DanCrenshawTX I strive everyday for this . I love my dog beyond belief
@AronEisenberg As long as it‚Äôs ground breaking . Women can direct as well as men
@MailOnline The murderous monsters who committed this horrific crime should be rotting in prison for the rest of there lives
@GeorgeTakei Exactly about time
@MeghanMcCain @HuntsmanAbby @TheView What happened to Wednesday show ?? Did you tape the episode ?
@jamieoliver This looks perfect . Great healthy comfort food
@PrisonPlanet This is sickening beyond belief
@NewJerseyOAG Except mine which are being ignored again as usual by your office .  I‚Äôm still be harassed and threatened at work by MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective. 100% illegal . My manager at Hone Depot  Glen Martini  can verify.Also my home might have been burglarized today.I‚Äôll find out
@GovMurphy The strengthening part is more taxes so there is no middle class . I saw some of your hidden taxes online and at work today we were discussing how your hidden taxes . Also your employee MCPO Andrew Carey should be disbarred for his crimes  and Felonies . No denying the facts
@ABC Good
@MailOnline DISGUSTING
@ananavarro Very sad . God Bless your friend . Congratulations on your marriage üôèüèªüôèüèª
@tyhenrymedium I saw you will be in Atlantic City in July
@KellyO @SenJohnMcCain This is Awesome üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@tyhenrymedium I agree 100%. All Dogs Go Too Heaven. I have experience this as well .
@tommydidario I agree . I Day Dream too organize my thoughts to get clarity. It‚Äôs great too mentally focus and de clutter the mind . #GoodSuit
@ProudResister Trust me Ryan God is listening . Trump and his Corruption is coming to an end . GOP has to turn on him or will not survive
@WillAndGrace @DebraMessing Watching right now
@albinokid @startrekcbs I‚Äôm on a rollercoaster ride . I guessed and I was right . I knew Talos would be apart of The Spock arc . Cannot wait for next weeks episode. I wore my red tank top shirt with the Star Trek emblem while working out . I was called Captain Pike today . I take that as a compliment.
@marythechief Great news . I so loved last weeks episode . I watched like 5 times already
@PerezHilton King Crab Legs and Jumbo Shrimp cocktail !!!! Hell yes
@ProudResister @JoeBiden @mike_pence I was a little shocked by this one . Biden has stood up and defending the LGBT community very much . Pence and his wife are so ANTI-LGBT . Seems like a big contradiction I do not understand !!
@TheTodayShow Good . That food sounds disgusting!!
@AronEisenberg The latest is the trump kids are going too be questioned by Congress . Dumb Dony Jr is toast . Ivanka Lied On tv about her Secruity clearance !! Trump ordered General Kelly to give her and Jared clearance . Not good
@mchooyah Is that what the investigation was about ?? Really .
@nj1015 @BillSpadea The potholes in Governor Murphy ‚Äòs Head .
@ThePerezHilton No not at all .
@MeghanMcCain @HuntsmanAbby I just saw this a few minutes ago . If Ivanka lied about this what else did she lie about ?? My guess tons !!! For Ivanka too be her fathers favorite means she must be just him . Rotten to the core . My new nickname for Trump is General Bone Spurs . He was not happy about that
@NewJerseyOAG @aabany @GurbirGrewalNJ How about an award for disbarring The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey !! The Felon is a criminal thru and thru . But you know that already . Fire , Arrest and imprisonments Carey and his Detective. Time for true justice in NJ
@mchooyah @MailOnline What about  bin laden #2 Zwargari the Egyptian Doctor . Why hasn‚Äôt he been taken out ? Bin Laden add him too the list .
@GeorgeTakei ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüòéüòé
@News12NJ Corruption Everywhere!!!
@BetteMidler F for Felonies is my guess
@startrekcbs Salmon with crab meat . My Dinner
@GeorgeTakei Because he is no different that Kim . Two of a Kind
@ananavarro I agree with you 100000%
@ABC So love Sully .i have a yellow lab too
@GMA No
@RudyGiuliani Rudy ? Trump has so many like Cohen in his circle ? Why ? General Bone Spurs can not say there was one bad apple in his organization . No there are many . The reason is Trump !! He has many Immoral issues . Too many issues and too many associates that are corrupt . Defending Kim
@ananavarro Everytime I say this will sink him . Trump hits a new low . Otto should have went to North Korea . This is not a place too study . This is the most horrifying regime since Nazi Germany . But he did not serve too die .This was Murder . Trump defending Kim &amp; the Crown Prince #NoWay
@mfa_russia @DrodriguezVen Then Russia must commit to peaceful transition of power from the  Nazi  Like Regime Of Maduro. I understand with the money Russia has invested Venezuela. Russia needs too protect its investment . Russia must come  to the revelation that Maduro must leave and tyranny  must end
@jamieoliver Love love vegetables .
@WPBF25News I‚Äôm glad he was saved . You can tell he is wolf . But because he is a wolf he does not deserve to be saved . Wolves are smarter than dogs and I‚Äôm sure this wolf was as grateful as a dog would have been .
@GovMurphy Another hidden tax for NJ Residents too pay . I guess Phil you have too come up with money too pay for illegal immigrants driver licenses and their car insurance and illegal immigrants health care . All the taxes your raising too pay for your programs .#Like Get Real !!
@ProudResister Totally Agree . People from Wharton did talk about Trumps Grades . Trump was NOT a Good Student . His Father got him in Wharton with a bribe plus Daddy Trump bought his degree . This degree was never earned
@ABC Really ???? I guess when Kim murdered his own brother and executed other family members is not an indication of his socio path persona . TRUMP IS A MORON !!!!
@krassenstein The BLIND  Loyality too Trump is quite apparent . The  Cohen Tv  Show  showed so much that I can not see Trump recovering from this
@KellyO No Deal From ‚ÄúThe Greatest Deal Maker Of All Time ‚Äú #IMPOSSIBLE
@RudyGiuliani Cohen is s crook but Rudy come on . TRUMP IS THE RING LEADER Of Deceit &amp; Corruption.
@GMB Luke . After Luke &amp; Laura the Great Couple from tv soap opera  General Hospital
@RobertPicardo Yes I was TOTALLY SHOCKED last night I was watching Voyager and actually never saw the episode on last night . The episode was about Tuvok attacked by cloaking aliens and these aliens caused brain damage . The Doctor &amp; Neelix working together too rehabilitate Tuvok. Great Episode
@NewJerseyOAG I was apart of a class action law suit against Wells Fargo . I got my money finally . Should I write up a list of damages and losses too my house , my dog , my livelihood due too Threats and Destructive damages caused by The Felon Andrew Carey and his Detective?
@GeorgeTakei Oh My
@MailOnline This is very very wrong
@RandyRainbow Maybe more of a Weird Al Yankovic take ??
@albinokid @startrekcbs @StarTrek This is Season is PHENOMENAL I truly Loved  last weeks episode . Very much back too the roots of the original series .
@Marina_Sirtis 70 degrees in February is unthinkable in a London . Climate change is 100 % Real . Trump is the only one denying this
@washingtonpost Very very true
@RobinRoberts @AmericanIdol @GMA @katyperry @LukeBryanOnline @LionelRichie Still watching . But I want American Idol to focus on the singers not the judges .
@jamieoliver With strawberries üçì and real maple syrup with hot &amp; sweet chicken sausage with thick rye toast and Italian coffee with organic half half .  That‚Äôs a   breakfast  to me
@JrzyJoePiscopo I do love old architecture. Such history . I always think of the builders and workers who created churches and ancient buildings and structures.
@Pontifex I agree . But Pope Francis there is a lot of evil in the world .
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @RussiaUN @bbcrussian @Channel4 @SkyNews @FinancialTimes @Telegraph @EmbajadaRusaVen @guardian @MailOnline So  Maduro can take the money . Why don‚Äôt you tell the truth and tell the world all the crimes committed by  Maduro and his dictatorship. Russia only cares about Venezuela because of the fears it will lose the economic investments you have . It‚Äôs all about the Ruble .
@TheTodayShow Great beaches üëçüëç
@realDonaldTrump Your the President stop acting like an immature middle school kid . General Bone Spurs I bet they were laughing at you
@ProudResister Can‚Äôt wait too watch
@ThePerezHilton I hope everything works for him. I met Zac last summer . Very very nice guy
@njdotcom I believe Kate Brennan . The political ramifications would be disastrous for Murphy . I‚Äôm positive Murphy knew just like he knows about the crimes and felonies committed by MCPO Andrew Carey . I‚Äôm s victim of the Felonies committed by Andrew Carey.Murphy is also covering these up
@JaneRoe35 @NewJerseyOAG @GovMurphy I‚Äôm not a hater !! I speak the truth
@TheRekhaSharma @JessicaBiel @skipbronkie @MarleeMatlin @DEADLINE Congratulations Rekha
@njdotcom No it‚Äôs covering up felonies committed by the prosecutor he hired in Middlesex County. Andrew Carey has committed many Felonies and should be fired arrested and sent to prison
@PMSimferopol Because they were threatened too come back . 100% illegal and basically a war crime
@NewJerseyOAG @GovMurphy Work on corrupt Prosecutor like MCPO Andrew Carey . Stop covering up crimes committed by your employeess. Andrew Carey Detective is still threatening and sexually harassing me plus harassing me at work . 100% Illegal . I want him Fired , Arrested and sent to Prison!! INEXCUSABLE
@FOX29philly Lock him up !!!!
@timruss2 Very Logical
@SethMacFarlane Avengers Infinity War was the Best Movie for me

@sfpelosi Get Trump too publish his tax returns . Reunite the immigrant kids with parents .  Climate change reform. Gun reform !!! Smart laws .
@HalSparks @etnow Most of us do great deeds but get little recognition . God knows and some how some way are good deeds will be noted . I‚Äôm sure that grandpa and his family will remember and cherish you forever . When I do something I always ask the person I help just pay it forward and helpothers
@CNNPolitics Not at all
@HalSparks Lol . It‚Äôs an everyday event for me . But I‚Äôm a good guy I promise

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @DJohnsonPGA AGREE 1,000,000 % . It‚Äôs nice he is polite and courteous about Golf but not about children he had ripped out of their parents arms . Trumps priorities are so messed up it‚Äôs very scary .
@HalSparks I thought the second one was the best .
@TheView @sunny Good bye Irina
@DailyMirror Don‚Äôt give them too young children. This is my favorite Easter candy
@MailOnline Agree

@DavidCornDC You can tell he never thru a baseball in his life
@MrTommyCampbell I‚Äôm watching James Bond on Netflix. I refuse to watch
@katiecouric I‚Äôm watching Die Another Day on Netflix with Pierce Brosnan  and Halle Berry
@RandyRainbow I love all your  Trump Parodies  but The last one I truly needed Depends  I laughed so hard . I think the next one should be based on Trumps love affair with Kim &amp; Putin . Maybe a take on Evita . ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Cry For Me  Vladimir‚Äù
@NJSP Very cool and he is a true Superman from Krypton. üëçüëç
@sally_field Also so long as The Reverend Mothers Coronets wings are starched and Sister Sisto gets a Spanish to English  Dictionary  .
@NewJerseyOAG @UCPONJ @UCCweb Maybe I should attend . I would love a chance too catch up and discuss the Felon MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective who should be fired arrested and put in prison for his crimes !!! I love love too talk open in public how Gurbir covers up crimes of his employees
@RealDeanCain @SebGorka Yes

@MeghanMcCain @secupp Tequila does make the world go round and  around .
@AsburyParkPress Louie Depalma !!! Latka ?? Eebbbaa  Daa
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Very true . Trump even before he was president thinks because he is rich he is above the law . I seen the interviews . Plus Eric &amp; Don Jr watching them say that on camera is just a sign of Trump and his out of control ego . Trump thinks he is above the law
@CNN Kennedy is right . If there is something . It would be devastating for our countries history .
@AsburyParkPress Total Superhero
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Then they write a book and make millions .
@njdotcom No she made her choice . Because it did not work out . She committed Treason !!! Zero sympathy for her .

@ConanOBrien Nope
@pbpost Sometimes this is necessary unfortunately
@MonCoProsecutor What this monster did is beyond horrific.
@TheView Lock him up is my answer
@AsburyParkPress I pray they find these criminals .
@mfa_russia @RussianEmbassy We give evidence and Russia always LIES  &amp; comes up with a totally different fabricated story . Russia has zero credibility on this issue
@robreiner It does add up Trump told the court too give Epstein a flap on the wrist
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @RusMission_EU @RusEmbUSA @bbcrussian @SkyNews @Channel4 @guardian @FinancialTimes @Telegraph @MailOnline Well then tell Vlad too stop threatening the West with Nuclear Missiles . I heard his speech . Tell your fellow Russians too stop constantly threatening the Baltic States which are independent of Russia . Stop threatening Sweden with your provocative Naval Exercises
@AsburyParkPress I lived there for 12 years . Only a moron would walk there dogs on the lake
@ProudResister My 3rd was a black lab . I wish I did not live across country . I would adopt him
@tyhenrymedium Totally agree . I do this this

@NewJerseyOAG @CamdenCountyPD StArt with stop lying and creating a atmosphere of corruption and falsifying reports . The Felon Andrew Carey comes too mind . But you already know all about his Felonies and his Detective who burglarized my house , threatened me has drugged me and my dog . Crimes are ENDLESS
@MeghanMcCain Meghan you were doing your job . I watched Mc Cabe interviews on 60 Minutes and Colbert too . Each interview was unique
@WorldOfWonder Chris Not Liam
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @BBCWorld @bbcrussian @SkyNews @Channel4 @guardian @Telegraph @FT @TheSun @DailyMailUK When is Russia going too give proof that are telling the truth . Russia can not because the cyber attacks are real !! Even I can prove thAt . It‚Äôs very simple . Stop lying it‚Äôs actually laughable your tweets

@AnnaPaquin Helllloooo Sookie
@Newsweek Why ?
@RobinRoberts @JussieSmollett @danabrams @sunny I‚Äôm watching right now . I just can not understand why he did this ? Makes no sense . Only too put  light on his career ?
@PrisonPlanet Lol . There is a Starbucks / Dunkin Donuts or just a small deli not too mention street food vendors every 10 ft . He did not have too walk far at all.
@HuntsmanAbby Totally Agree . My fourth dog was a golden. She was so special and the most loving and gentle creature ever .
@AronEisenberg @Malissa_Longo Beautiful but a little scary . I‚Äôm amazed lions recognized her . Lions do not have or not supposed too have a long term memory . This proves the scientists wrong
@Ginger_Zee I applaud your work ethic . Done countless shifts like this . Weather related makes all of us do extra work schedules . Welcome Aboard . Question. Why are all of a sudden moons and weather events now even winter storms are being named ? Who decides these weather declarations?
@ConanOBrien What did you  tweet ?
@MrTommyCampbell Pizza üçï cause so many different kinds . And soo satisfying. Best is one of the best America comfort foods . I always make from scratch. I made a mushroom/ black olive / roasted garlic pizza . But first time with semolina flour . So much tastier https://t.co/a3V3ufzar3

@RusEmbUSA @Russia @KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia @mod_russia @RusCons_TX @rcgnewyork @StateDept @WHNSC @natomission_ru @SputnikInt @RT_America So interfering in US Elections and elections of other countries is not a provocative action . I guess poisoning or  murdering  anyone who opposes  Russian  Tyranny is only a defensive act . I guess persecuting anyone who not agree with the current political climate is defensive
@EricMcCormack These Trump Broadway stuff is priceless and never to make me LMAO
@TheKateMulgrew Just enough to bring chaos to order
@mchooyah Well technically fat people are at a higher level of metabolism . During the  Neanderthal times fat people lived longer . So Bobby Bobby Bobby
@nj1015 @GovMurphy @BillSpadea It‚Äôs because of me and my correspondence with Murphy . I commented about his failure of leadership in a crisis . He failed NJ many times . So he is going overboard d . So blame me .
@robreiner Comrade Trump is America‚Äôs Greatest Enemy
@JohnCena Can I lease out or rent ??
@albinokid Totally agree
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @OPCW @UN @RusEmbSyria @RussiaUN @rusembassynl @UKforSyria @UKSyriaRep @bbcrussian @SkyNews @guardian @Telegraph @DailyMailUK Lie lie lie .

Russian  economic ties are the only reason  Russia  is defending the Nazi Regime Of Assad
@JrzyJoePiscopo Ill vote for you
@MailOnline This is horrific
@dmartosko @RichardGrenell Agree
@PrisonPlanet These people are models ? Dam  such low standards . If an agency owned by white people did this there would be hell too pay . Let them have their anti white agency . I guarantee they will not be successful because they are not mainstream
@EdKrassen Keep on tweeting . I do the same thing too fight for what‚Äôs right. Never ever have I‚Äôve seen so many people political for  the reason  of having the most corrupt lying Treasonous Prrsident in US History . America will finally be able to sleep at night once he is Impeached
@DailyMirror Very very sad story .
@WPTV Yes I‚Äôm under total control of my Lab . He owns me . Trust me my dog is the boss . I love every second. I worship my dog

@NewJerseyOAG Wrong !!!! Do not say blacks were treated horrible in World War  2 , some  were but a lot were treated with great respect .
@pbpost Very cool

@GMA @LaraSpencer 2 or 3 . Everyone will wear black . But I like both but wear red for solidarity for the Boka Haram girls still in captivity .
@thehill Good
@ItsJeffHudson Congratulations
@njdotcom Let me save NJ TAX Payers money . Gov Murphy knows 100% about the crimes and abuses too my home life and my dog . MCPO The Felon has committed endless crimes and Murphy as well as Gurbir know  of the Crimes . A State Inspector for Gurbir Grewel confirmed Gurbir &amp; Murphy know All
@TrekMovie Really ? Why the same ?
@BetteMidler Its cloudy I can not see anything
@mchooyah üëçüëç
@MeghanMcCain Oh Meghan icy on the outside but sweet &amp; kind and  nice on  the inside .
@GovMurphy @FirstLadyNJ Who is paying ?   Another one of your hidden taxes ?? NJ knows that you are trying too pass taxes behind closed doors . Your not fooling anybody . Countless people can testify against MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective for endless crimes . His Detective should be FIRED&amp; ARRESTED
@NewJerseyOAG @AliVelshi Good it does violate the US Constitution . The 5 billion is needed for so many other reasons . Sit down with the Felon Carey and his Detective and tell him he committed Felonies. Still waiting for OCPO to call me about pressing charges . OCPO Bill Bilhimer is not responding back
@ConanOBrien West Hollywood look out Xonsn is on the prowl .
@NewJerseyOAG @NJSIAA Gurbir also I forgot too add a Famous former Federal Prosecutor and an Attorney whose brother is a Governor from a near by State . The list keeps growing  against the  countless  Felonies committed by MCPO Andrew Carey &amp; his MF POS Detective . Plus you and Governor Murphy
@ThePerezHilton Perez you are blessed . Your children are precious . üôèüèªüôèüèª
@pbpost How awful . But I‚Äôll bet they will adopted very soon
@nj1015 Who is paying for all these wonderful programs ??
@MeghanMcCain @VanderbiltU @jmeacham Tonight I‚Äôll watch the View after work . Can not wait too see you interview McCabe
@NewJerseyOAG @NJSIAA Gurbir also add a NJ State trooper too the list you can testify against MCPO The Felon Andrew Carey . So let‚Äôs add the list 5-10 local Police Officers . One Attorney from OCPO .  Two civilians . One NJ St Inspector who works for you . Plus countless police reports and witnesses.
@JohnCena Not necessarily? Cheeseburgers üçî &amp; Christmas cookies üç™??? Are my obsession

@PrisonPlanet Merkel  Destroyed Germany !!!  May Is Detroying Britain . I have lineage too both countries
@tommydidario @rja_tkydky Congratulations.

@PrisonPlanet Lynching  should  be a  Federal Hate Crime . . I‚Äôm sure it does happen to this day . Just not all cases are reported
@ABC Wow he sent the letter !!
@Newsweek Who in his right mind would enter such a contest ??? Murdering innocent animals  . This is not hunting !! This is murder !!! I hope the animals turn on them
@jamieoliver The shirt ?? My eyes üëÄ hurt !!! Ouch !!
@mchooyah Love that movie too . He was but The Code Red was  wrong . I‚Äôm not sure do they still have such unwritten policies anymore ?? I‚Äôm sure they do but not to that degree
@ConanOBrien It‚Äôs the accent?
@hitRECordJoe 7 minutes really ??? What drugs are they taking ??? For me it‚Äôs an hour or more
@ThePerezHilton Her father New there was a reason too give her a tremendous inheritance. Candy has the bucks . But why isn‚Äôt Candy you has probably 300 million bucks helping her out but with conditions . No blank check . But Candy is allowing her grandchildren too suffer. Sorry not cool
@WWESheamus Is the guy on the left a candy arse or what ??
@DavidMuir So sad but he lived such a long life . Their pic was Epic . David your Feel Good News stories have been so tremendous. I look very forward too then at the end of the 1/2 hour . Keep up the great work . Tell John Karl and Celicia too keep asking the tough questions about Trump
@NewJerseyOAG I could have written this about MCPO Andrew Carey .
@Andy @adamlambert Adam did such a great job with Cyndi Lauper on the Cher Trubute .
@HalSparks @devryuniv True or a President whose resume is a boring tv show
@ProudResister Agree 1000%
@NewJerseyOAG Exactly !!!!! The Constitution. Remember the Constitution is American Law . Laws your employee MCPO Carey  has broken countless times !! Ran into your State Inspector at work yesterday with her husband who goes to my gym . Guess what she admitted the truth . Carey is a Felon !!!
@EdKrassen I think the father has a say . Why does the father seem to be on the back burner . The father is expected too support for 18 years even if they are not married .  So why isn‚Äôt the father apart of the pregnancy ? Two way street !!
@PerezHilton He should be arrested for that . How horrible and how awful . Plus all the man hours and time the CPD put into finding the so called Lynchers .
@GovMurphy I ran into a State Inspector for NJ Attorney General at work today and she confirmed everything I was saying about The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey .  She was talking too husband I know from the gym .I‚Äôm so glad justice is proving me correct about the Horrific Abuse that I‚Äôm suffering
@guskenworthy Absolutely nothing wrong on showing love . The world needs a lot more loving caring people .
@jonathansfrakes Totally agree
@RobinRoberts @GMA @JussieSmollett @EvaPilgrim @danabrams I saw . I knew he lied.  Things  did not add up . I hope he gets in trouble for what he did . He did a tremendous disservice too so many people . Very very sad .

@FantomColeman @RusEmbUSA @mfa_russia I do not lie
@ProudResister @JussieSmollett A lot did not make sense too me . He should  be prosecuted for lying and making a false report . I knew from  the beginning  he was lying . He hurt a lot of people and did a tremendous harm too a lot of true cases . Shame on him
@MeghanMcCain @kenjeong I will . I want too hear Sunny talk about the legal implications for Jussie Smollett Lying and filing a false police report . I knew something was wrong with this story .

@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @UKSyriaRep @bbcrussian @BBCMiddleEast @FT @guardian @Telegraph @standardnews @SkyNews @Channel4 This would be a welcome change if actual real and honest motives are meant for the side too promote peace with all involved . Assad must leave and true free elections too promote government unity . A unified government and  a true constitutional policy needed . No More War Crimes
@RussianEmbassy @LOS_Fisher @DefenceHQ @foreignoffice @bbcrussian @mfa_russia Awesome !!! This is a great show of force and unity with The United States . China can not claim international waters .

@NewJerseyOAG Congrats too me The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey did not commit any criminal  against me last night . I still want his Detective FIRED  ARRESTED AND SENT TO PRISON FOR HIS CRIMES !!! You can‚Äôt deny the felonies committed !!! DRUGGING MY DOG IS A CRIME THAT CANNOT  OVERLOOKED OR DENIED

@njdotcom Total BS .

@TrekMovie As long as s good script . Last two movies SUCKED !!!!
@ricky_martin @RecordingAcad Have a great time Ricky
@robreiner Exactly . Trumps stupid ignorance and the lying . He blocked me but because guess changed his mind . Trump wants people who agree with him . It‚Äôs basically his way and his thoughts . If anyone disagrees or has a counter thought . Then thy are labeled the bad  guy .
@thehill A felony ???? Really I think not a  misdemeanor yes but not a felony .
@timruss2 @realDonaldTrump I agree . A bit of emotion behind your statement Mr Tuvok . However your statement is logical and I agree completely
@nypost Wow after all these years a divorce . She will get millions
@jonathansfrakes Awesome soundtracks . Frakes you need too work on developing the lesser main characters on Discovery . Also a more needed male presence . More testosterone . Nice too have strong women but the other half needs a voice . Who‚Äôs the Chief Engineer . I still do not know ?
@ananavarro @realDonaldTrump @amyklobuchar God he is so clueless on climate change . He has his own ideas and won‚Äôt change no matter what . This is a severe sign of mental impairment . A sign Trump is not capable mentally of leadership . I  so did  not agree with the guy in Thurs. I guess he forgot sickness &amp; health
@MeghanMcCain Happy Birthday Roberta üéÇüéâüéàüéäüéÅ

@GovChristie @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos Talk about how the media is talking about Don Jr knows he will be indicted . Talk about how Warren list before she even started . The SOTU did inspire . It‚Äôs too late for Trump . His lying constant scandals, the way he treats people plus his sucking up too Putin ruined his Office
@thehill I‚Äôm sure the doctor is lying . Just like last year. Are not the doctors not giving a true diagnosis actually breaking and violating their oath

@sunny I saw totally love this story . I saw Meghan tweeted it. Don‚Äôt forget about Bon Jovi who does this in Red Bank NJ . I saw a chef from Italy on 60 Minutes who does this too . A lot of kindness still exists in this world . Just saw Trumps nasty tweet on Sen Warren . It never ends
@MrTommyCampbell There  are soo many Congressional committees  so many State Attorney Generals plus NY State Federal Prosecutors . Mueller is just one of the many people going after Trump . Not too mention his own White House Staff . Chances are good he will not be around in a few months .
@WPBF25News Very sad

@prattprattpratt @rmhnewyork Good interview but we waited a half hour !!!!! I was in the audience https://t.co/ObEKgCXkRN
@piersmorgan Piers On was Kelly &amp; Ryan today . I heard Liam talk off camera . When I heard him talk too Kelly  &amp; Ryan privately,Liam feels guilty for this . He is not a racist but someone who 40 years ago made a mistake . But actually never committed a crime !! Piers be more forgiving https://t.co/aZdSDK4jj0
@latimes Liam is not !!!! I was on Kelly &amp; Ryan today and off camera Liam was very honest and feeling horrible about this !!! It‚Äôs true because off camera you find out the truth !!!! I overheard the private conversation.

Russia stop mocking up and be a part of the solution
@THR I was just on Kelly  &amp; Ryan and heard Liam talk off camera too Kelly &amp; Ryan . He is very emotional about this . #Honest
@nypost Why ?? This is his second marriage ???
@RusEmbUSA @mfa_russia @StateDept @WHNSC @EmbajadaRusaVen @UnderSecT @ArmsControlNow @StateAVC @RussiaUN Wrong !!!!!!! Russia needs too stop supporting a corrupt dictatorship that Madurobrigged the election . Russia is only supporting because of Russia an investment in Citgo and the Venezuelan mineral industry. Stop lying !!!! Nobody believes what you tweet !!!
@SethMacFarlane I go on tv and talk then I tweet
@PrisonPlanet Kinda scary
@GeorgeTakei No words can Trump can say will fix anything . He has done too much damage . After the world knows after yesterday Trump is the laziest president .

@WNYC @GovMurphy Wow I asked questions ??? Never got an answer on the criminal corruption of MCPO Andrew Carey . Why are my Civil Rights being Viokated ? Why is Andrew Carey SezysllyvGarassing and threatening me ? Why is my house being burglarized and my dog illegally Drugged . 100% Truth !!!
@pattonoswalt Oh God .  Maybe that‚Äôs why he is orange
@prattprattpratt @GMA I‚Äôll be in the audience on GMA ON Thursday . I‚Äôll watch the twitter feed . Maybe if the Guardians fought Thanis in Time Square today . Hmmmmm I think a good idea
@triviapotus @CarterLibrary Very cool. These men are  Presidents . Trump so pales in comparison
@latimes Too a point but you do not want too much help from celebrities because it turns voters off . Oprah worked very hard for Stacy Abrams in Georgia but it did not work
@MichaelAvenatti @smmarotta Totally agree  Michael  . I use Twitter too fight law enforcement corruption in New Jersey . The Governor &amp; NJ Attorney General can and are hypocrites on a lot of issues . I call them out on it . Boy do I get threatened a lot . But I stand up for what‚Äôs right .
@CalebJHull I worship my Maverick https://t.co/QnxAbsGgQw

@NewJerseyOAG @GurbirGrewalNJ @NJSP @nstva Stop being a hypocrite!!!! Your actions with Andrew Carey Prove  you LIE &amp; Commit Hypocrisy!!! Tell NJ what you allow too happen !!! Tell NJ THAT you say one thing for the camera but do the direct opposite when the camera is off !!!
@NewJerseyOAG I wonder what she would think how hypocritical you and Phil Murphy are . I would have loved too talk too her and let her know what Felonies you allowed to occur with MF POS MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective. Stop pretending you care about LGBT . You do not !!! Stop Hypocrisy
@WilliamShatner Worship Jeannie . You both look wonderful https://t.co/zorWt4ToyC
@michaelstrahan @GMA God I have too admit . Brady acted cool This Time . I did not see any of his pretty boy  shanagins .

@mchooyah It‚Äôs all about money, oil and arms dealers . Bin Laden is dead time too leave . We do need a presence . Still did not the Egyptian doctor . Bin Laden second . Zagawri I think is his name .
@ThePerezHilton @PerezHilton Boring !!!
@RobertPicardo @morgfair Me too . Great tweets she writes
@mchooyah Off üòé. Sunny &amp; warm almost summer like today . Last week -15 degrees . Today 62 F .
@GovMurphy In 5 years from now . Make history by Firing MCPO Andrew Carey ‚ÄúThe Felon‚Äù. Two TRPD cops and one Attorney from OCPO verified the illegal burglary into my house and drugging my dog . His Detective did this in his own . I want him FIRED ARRESTED AND SENT TO PRISON!!!! MF POS !!!!
@MrTommyCampbell This one I‚Äôm sure is true . Trump basically works part time . Trump also saw school records . He got into Wharton because his father gave $$$ . Trump was a dumbass student with low grades . This was on twitter today .
@AsburyParkPress @maroon5 Loved it
@hitRECordJoe Vacuum your dog hair and start dinner
@rickygervais Like what Turks &amp; Caicos does . Island full adoptable puppies running in the beach . God how could anyone resist not rescuing one or two . Maybe a wild life park where all natural wildlife is protected and free too roam without fear of any kind
@PatriciaHeaton Where is Debra ?
@JohnCena Spelling . iPhones spell what they want . It‚Äôs like gremlins  exist inside the phone . Artificial intelligence is taking over . John you might be under the control of a computer
@TheRickWilson Totally agree
@GMA I loved the halftime show
@cnnbrk Wow he is younger than me
@GeorgeTakei Also his day does not start till 11:30 am. Half the day gone for someone who does nothing but work . Another LIE!!!! Trump has been recorded as the LAZIEST PRESIDENT in terms of work hours .
@HuffPost She did a moral correct thing but not legal .
@njdotcom Law makers also should look into the Felinies committed by MCPO Sndrew Carey !!! Governor Murphy is Covering Up Felonies . I can prove everything. I‚Äôm NOT CRAZY !!! I‚Äôm telling you 100% TRUTH
@soledadobrien Trump is a Racist . His father Fred was a member of the KKK. He has an arrest record !!!! Why does that not get reported . Also I saw trump records at Wharton . He got in as a favor . $$ changing hands . Plus he was not the smartest and brightest look up his grades . Poor student
@TheView I think it‚Äôs very respectful and nice . You also marry the family whether you like it or not
@RobertPicardo Totally agree
@mchooyah @Patriots @jessical_oneill Hot
@JoePiscopoShow @JrzyJoePiscopo @GeraldoRivera I saw something about the Trump Administration. Trump Admin is saying it would be harmful to reunite the immigrant children with their families . This is absolutely shocking . I understand how children might have security with foster parents . The Orange skin is OVERTANNING !!!
@soledadobrien Totally 100 immoral and insane
@RussianEmbassy Calling for free fair elections just like the rest of the world who believes in freedom and democracy . Russia is only supporting Maduro because of Russian investment in the oil industry. With  Maduro  gone Russia fears it will lose billions . Tell the truth . Maduro is Guilty
@GovernorVA Resign . Resign resign
@NatGeo Speak to the bird !!!
@DailyMirror Wow !!!! This woman is a criminal !!!! So if a woman does this kind of crime she gets a pass !! Nope Don‚Äôt Think So !!!

@swedense Both were genius . World needs more men with great intelligent intellect
@HalSparks Not bad not bad kid . But you need tats or at least a few . Would make you look younger and more of a guy with mystery and a story too tell
@DanCrenshawTX I was hoping the Patriots would lose just too see Brady‚Äôs upside down frown
@RealJamesWoods A BIG YES!!
@hitRECordJoe Cylons ?? The Borg ??? Judgement Day Skynet ?? This is the Future
@JeffBezos @washingtonpost What are you doing for the family of Khassoggi??? Nothing !!!!
@nypost Trump is Resigning for the Good of America ????
@EdKrassen I know people with orange skin . It‚Äôs a result of over tanning from ultraviolet light from tanning beds . Great example of how too get skin cancer . Shinning example of what not to do or how to act . I remember the days when you looked up too the President with Respect No Longer
@WWECesaro Very athletic. Great moves . Very impressive
@GMB @RebeccaCNReid Stupid !!! Really what sane person would care what she thinks !!! Just because she married a Prince ?? Now she is a God appointed Holy Messiah !!! I‚Äôm American and so is Megan . She is no different or no more special than anybody .
@PerezHilton Perfect. Awesome job
@RobertPicardo I believe this is true . Just look at how he is traveling and visiting areas . Seems only areas that support him . Every president travels tremendously visiting American cities . He still has never been to Chicago . But with the tremendous death and gun violence Chicago needshelp
@PerezHilton Loved Maroon 5 üëçüëç
@7thRule One Great Klingon
@RandyRainbow Randy Randy Randy üåà. The Half  Time Show . The food and appetizers .  When I lived in Box Raton Florida the  Super Bowl  was as big as Thanksgiving. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Your latest Video was hysterical.
@RussianEmbassyC @mfa_russia @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassy @RussianEmbFinla @RusEmbSwe @RusEmbNo @NCC_CCN @OttawaCitizen Beautiful
@startrekcbs @CBSAllAccess When ?????
@DailyMirror Actually Amazon is working in a robot system to replace humans
@danacarvey Hi Dana I was just watching Chruch Chat in YouTube . I miss The Church Lady . I think it‚Äôs a great idea too bring back on SNL and parody Trump . Alec and your comic timing would be a total Win Win . Call Lorne . Resurrect The Church Lady
@MrKenMitchell @CBSAllAccess @Theirishtrekkie Totally loved the episode on Thursday . Klingons always make the show . Spock,  The Federation and the Klingon  Empire  all tie into the Red Angel is my guess
@AmandaTh50 @Nigella_Lawson Beautiful
@FOX29philly How awful
@RealBradGarrett Brad she is HOT HOT !!!
@robreiner Hi Rob with our leaders ADD and use of Adderal and psychiatric issues . His need too lie , his overwhelming narcissism . Plus his greed and need too put people down . Plus Trump is 100% a Racist . Also he has dementia . Plus his poor  physical health makes him unqualified to lead
@DailyMirror 84 lbs . He needs disability . Plus medical help .
@PopularPups ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

@JohnCena Enjoy the day John üèàüá∫üá∏üéâüí•
@HalSparks The resistance and western minded people in Iran have always existed. Iran is always on the verge of revolution . Threats and sharia law keep the people in fear of revolting . Economic leverage is the best way for change . This will force the leaders too change
@RealHughJackman Have a great time . Do not drink Aviation Gin . Drink Ryan‚Äôs competitors and take a photo.
@GMB For monetary gain yes . But vegetables should have been introduced in the beginning . Now maybe mums and dads need too learn too  bake and  roast vegetables better . Never boil
@njdotcom Wings or anything with dip or sour cream
@ABC I read days ago . ABC  a little behind the news . Glad too here . Women Do Lie !!! Men are not evil monsters !!!
@SebGorka This is not true . I so do not like this woman . I can not imagine anybody re electing her . Very anti American values
@guskenworthy @RuPaulsDragRace @RuPaul It‚Äôs a psychological thing . But I‚Äôm TERRIFIED of Drag Queens . Ever since I saw in NYC when I was a little boy . Same fear like with people &amp; clowns
@nj1015 This ONE TIME I agree with Murphy
@krassenstein I had many tweets from self described Russian Trolls who kinda threatened me on criticizing Russia over the missile issues . They did not like the idea I stated FACTS on Russian Treaty Violations
@RealBradGarrett Yes he does , if you go look back at Reagan video you can see similarities . Nobody knew back then what Alzheimer‚Äôs was . I remember at the end of Reagan‚Äôs Presidency how he acted very much like this . The forgetfulness .
@elonmusk IKEA . Cheap n Breakable IKEA is more like it
@tylerhoechlin God luck with the movie ‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è

@elonmusk Love wolves &amp; watermelon too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@thehill The orange gene . Just like Oompa loompas from Willy Wonka
@HuffPost Very sad
@NewJerseyOAG @NJSP So today‚Äôs count 1 Attorney from OCPO + 2 TRPD Cops verified the Detective from MCPO Illegally burglarized my Home and drugged my dog . I wrote and told OCPO Bill Billhimer I want this MF POS Detective Charged and Prosecuted . 100% Illegal . I told him too tell you and Carey
@marythechief Star Trek Cannon says no women can serve in the council . But your Chancellor ? Glad the Klingons look more like regular standard . Loved this weeks episode . Awesome Klingon episode
@michaelstrahan @TonyGonzalez88 @NFL @NFLonFOX @ProFootballHOF Looking forward too the Super Bowl . I want too see tears and upside down frown from Brady when he loses .  I hope no politics at half time . Just a nice family time without Trump and his shaningans . One day off PLEASE GOD üôèüèªüôèüèª
@MeghanMcCain @JaniceDean Ground hogs are vicious nasty Vermin . I have one every year under my shed. They taunt my lab by walking up too sliding glass door . Usually by the end of the Summer my Lab sends them too the Pearly Gates . Next Day another one shows up and replaces the deceased Groundhog .
@AsburyParkPress I‚Äôm glad a happy ending . I would be too scared too read the story
@ricky_martin I was in Caracas when Chavez came into power . I was a day excursion from Aruba. . When me and three Texans were wandering around the plaza by a church . Taking pic/ shopping . Then we were surrounded and almost killed by the Anti-American mob the Army saved us with machine guns
@skitsmv @PerezHilton üëçüëç
@VINNYGUADAGNINO @DJPaulyD He is such a nice guy with so much positive energy . I met all of you at Seaside . Mike total whacko . He hit on me . I never forget that time . Pauly was jealous because I have bigger biceps . Still makes me laugh
@realDonaldTrump @jacknicklaus @TigerWoods Golfing just like Barak Obama
@mchooyah I love cat fish . Send me some
@MeghanMcCain @VanderbiltU @jmeacham Meghan  I was tweeting about our withdrawing from missile treaty with the Russians and stated facts . I studied Russian history and politics for 30 years . Boy did I get a reaction the Russian embassy in Britain was not happy with me nor Moscow . Many Not Nice Tweets
@njdotcom What a shock !!! Nobody will ever support Menendez for higher office . He is so bought and sold by lobbyists . Totally 100% CORRUPT PAWN
@BrentSpiner Happy Birthday Brent
@HalSparks Oh wait yes he did !!!
@tommydidario Me going in a few minutes after walking my precious pup Maverick
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @BBCWorld @bbcrussian @guardian @standardnews @SkyNews @Channel4 @FT @DailyMailUK Total BS . You are copying what  wrote I just wrote . Russia is famous for not following treaties , breaking them and manipulation of the treaties negotiated in good faith . I understand very well the Russian culture . Russians do not trust . Always on the defensive
@The_UnSilent_ This makes me sick . Such a beautiful animal . I agree with you
@NJSenatePres I can not predict . I would like too predict that Gurbir Grewel does his job and terminate MCPO Andrew Carey for the Felonies he committed . I‚Äôm a victim of horrific Civil Rights Violations . Governor Murphy is very very aware of the Felonies . Both are afraid too admit the truth
@EmbassyofRussia @mfa_russia @mod_russia @russiabeyond @Vlad_Kononov @ValLisitsa @sovietvisuals @Dpol_un @MauriceSchleepe @georgegalloway @VanessaBeeley Do not forget the biggest weapon in The Russian arsenal is the Russian winter . This is the biggest and most powerful . So thank the weather for the victory
@TheView I . Can‚Äôt you just enjoy the Superbiwl . Stop for a second . Worry about politics the next day
@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @BBCWorld @bbcrussian @Channel4 @SkyNews @Telegraph @guardian @standardnews @FT @DailyMailUK Stop with the usual lies . It‚Äôs always the same story with Russia . Russia lies . NEVER FOLLOWS TREATIES . Breaks almost every single one . Tried too manipulate everyone . Then plays the innocent victim . This is Russian politics . I‚Äôm an expert in Russian politics . Stop Lying !
@nypost What about Chuck bring in Heidi Fleiss Red Book
@ProudResister The results will be outstanding . The  Doctor will  lie again . Same doctor
@DebraMessing OMG !!!! This is awful
@njdotcom He looks like Hitler
@jeffreycombs @RobertPicardo Because he needs a story and a distraction to deflect the news from the Mueller Probe . Mueller should gave all the T‚Äôs crossed  and   i i ‚Äòs dotted  very soon. ‚Äú Make Way For The Mueller ‚Äú .
@ABC I can not understand why this is so newsworthy. Daily Event. Cameras are stopping a lot of this fake accounts debts . I was a safety  manager for A&amp;P Supermaket . I solved many of these issues through investigation . Plus you showed The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey. Shouldbe In prison
@robreiner Totally Agree . I guarantee his views have not changed . This guy is a pure racist !!!! Trump will not say anything is my bet
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED So wrong !!!! Why can‚Äôt the Senate or Supreme Court do something ?
@HuffPost Resign David Duke !!!!
@DailyMirror Creepy !!! But in America this means something else in a sexual manner
@CBSPhilly WRONG !!!!!!!!
@guskenworthy Yes it does big guy . üòé
@TheRickWilson @HalSparks @washingtonpost Chris Christie is as corrupt and as lying scum as Donald Trump . A shorter fatter version . I call him Fatboy .   Christie  knows me very well . He told me I‚Äôm a pain in the ass . Christie covers up crimes .  Bridgegate  cost NJ $64,000 a month too coverup why ?
@realDonaldTrump You absolutely did not right this tweet . Who wrote it ???
@CNN Great !!! Tell this too NJ GOVERNOR MURPHY. MURPHY DOES NOT  CARE ABOUT  DOGS AND ALLOWS ANIMAL ABUSE AND   CRUELTY  . Just ask or DM me
@HalSparks Very powerful statement üëçüëç
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Stop !!!! Governor Murphy is a total hypocrite. Ask him about MCPO Andrew Carey and his Felonies he has committed . Carey has threatened, sexually harassed and denied my civil rights . Plus abused my dog . Gov Murphy is Covering Up Crimes . Do not celebrate a HYPOCRITE
@TrekMovie Great episode
@CNN Do not forget about Gov Murphy duplicity and hypocrisy . He says one thing for the photo op but behind closed doors he covers up crimes of sexual harassment and crimes of denying civil rights by MCPO Andrew Carey. I‚Äôm a victim . Pushing Murphy too terminate him . Total Corruption
@mchooyah Question ? What was the reason Bin Laden  was not stopped there ? Who messed up ? Was it us ? Or were we simply out  maneuvered ?
@HuntsmanAbby Soooo cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@people This makes me cry ?
@MeghanMcCain @secupp Jalape√±o margaritas???? Really ???? I worship martinis . Apple , sugar cookie, chocolate, snowflake , vanilla , Coffee had them all . Good show today . Did you know about Bookers real estate tax issues . He does not pay taxes . How come that was not apart of the questions ?
@TheRekhaSharma @startrekcbs This weeks episode has technical problems on the CBS App. Finally watched . I loved it Great Episode . Klingons finally look like Klingons from other Trek shows .
@tommydidario I also had a lot of positive things happen as well . I hit a political milestone on twitter . I wrote a tweet about how Great Denmark is  economically and politically . Denmark is also a part of my ethnic background .I got ‚ÄúTHOUSANDS ‚Äúof positive tweets . Plus fighting corruption
@Newsweek This one I agree with
@GovMurphy Don‚Äôt forget too mention you have allowed MCPO Andrew Carey to VIOLATE MY Civil Rights and allowed sexually Discriminating. So when your smiling for a photo tell Everyone you are following a poly y of duplicity and hypocrisy
@NewJerseyOAG Once Again your LYING too the people of NJ. After my civil rights have been horrifically violated and many years of sexually harassment you allowed Andrew Carey and his Detective too commit FELONIES. Stop saying one thing and behind closed doors you are allowing the opposite

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Sarah I‚Äôm a Republican . Trump tax cuts have only benefitted corporate America and not the working class . The trickle down theory did not happen . ISIS is not defeated .

@GovMurphy @News12NJ I‚Äôll be asking why are you afraid too admit the truth about the Felonies of MCPO Andrew Carey . He publicly confessed !!!! Years of criminal activity with his Detective . Threats , sexual harassment the list is endless .  CHRIS CHRISTIE ADMITTED EVERYTHING IS TRUE !!!! Just Ask
@JudgeJeanine @RashidaTlaib I think she is working for ISIS

@EdKrassen Very True
@RobertPicardo @realDonaldTrump I wrote  the same tweet.  Trump does not read . I seriously doubt he ever opened a bible .
@nypost So cute
@njdotcom He is done . I tweeted him last night on the dirt and covering up crimes committed by people he hired and he knew about the crimes as Governor  . He did nothing but LIE . I‚Äôm NOT CRAZY OR MAKING ANYTHING UP . THIS IS 100% TRUTH . Christie. Covered up Crimes Of MCPO Andrew Carey
@GovChristie Your buddy The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey was caught red handed Lying . You appointed a true corrupt lying MF POS . Thanks for playing games and denying the facts of criminal corruption .
@nypost Totally 100% evil . Iran is a society that is pure evil .
@ConanOBrien Why yes yes I do
@albinokid Wow how pleasant
@GeorgeTakei Trump is clueless !!! He tweets and brags/lies about his accomplishments . Only a brainless moron would believe anything he says
@latimes He is lucky to get job back because retailers do not want you to stop shop lifters the reasons are safety to law suits
@TheView @GovChristie Ask why does it cost  $64,000 a month for security on Bridgegate emails ? Ask why did he bully and cut State Police Pensions ? Ask why did he cover up Felonies of Andrew Carey ? Ask him never too wear a bathing suit in public ? I live 10 minutes away . I do not want to go blind
@SunSentinel Omg !!!! How awful
@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams Love Stacey . She is an inspiration and excellent politician

@GovMurphy Great news Phil Tell Gurbir that the Monmouth County  Prosecutor Office retweeting my comments about the Felon MCPO Andrew Carey &amp; His Detective for the illegal burglary and drugging of my dog .

@NewJerseyOAG Be on the alert for Illegal burglaries too my house and drugging my dog yesterday . TRPD confirmed it !!!!  Stop covering up felonies of MCPO Andrew Carey . Carey is GUILTY !!!!
@GovMurphy Wow another storm another chance for you too mess up . Guess what TRPD confirmed the Illegal burglary yesterday too my house . Plus drugging my dog . Stop covering up felonies of MCPO Andrew Carey &amp; his Detective. Both committed Felonies . You and Gurbir know the truth
@njdotcom Of course the prosecutor lied just like the Felon MCPO Andrew Carey Lied . It‚Äôs all about covering up crimes and protecting Gov Murphy &amp; NJ Attorney General Gurbir Grewel. Gurbir &amp; Phil are trying too cover up felonies committed by Andrew Carey . I can prove everything. #100Truth
@SamChampion @michaelstrahan I loved the segment but the cheese üßÄ one with Michael and Amy too messy

@GovMurphy @BayerUS How about getting me a job since  your employee  Andrew Carey works overtime on sexually harassment and violating me on my civil rights on my job #You and Gurbir know of the felonies being committed
@GovMurphy @SpeakerCoughlin @NJSenatePres Si is not having your civil rights violated by The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective at work . The personal attacks and sexual harassment by Andrew Carey can not be DENIED !!!!! Andrew Carey is a Felon . Phil &amp; Goober Grewel Stop hiding from Justice and the  law
@NewJerseyOAG There are also rules about being sexual harassed by law enforcement at your jobby MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective. I guess you forgot that law . The Felon and you can add that crime too the list . So my house was illegally burglarized yesterday and my dog was drugged you MCPO

@Newsweek OMG !!
@AsburyParkPress Oh god now what will he do because LYIN Joe Coranato is not the Prosecutor too bail him out . LYIN Joe Coranato was totally corrupt and almost a Mafia like mentality and form of justice .
@swedense Sweden has so many corruption issues . The immigration issues that are culturally destroying Sweden . The increase of violent crime and that lack of concern by its leaders . Massive new  legislation is needed too protect Swedish citizens
@GMB @piersmorgan @Ross_Greer That is not true . Why start a conversation about the past with  hypothetical thoughts and questions .  I would concentrate on issues today in Britain . Example immigration policies , domestic / foreign security issues &amp; of  course Brexit .
@BetteMidler Trump is furious . He lost his wall . Cliff Sims tell all book . Ex Gov Christie who is just as corrupt as Trump new book Wednesday . Plus Fox and his Republican base turned on him .  Roger Stone  arrest . Not a good week for Trump . Plus Melania left him for a few days #Why????
@guskenworthy Do you really want a Pepsi ???
@KremlinRussia_E I still prefer the name  St Petersburg . Lenin &amp; Stalin were both Evil sociopaths with murder and chaos on their minds . Peter The Great was one of Russia‚Äôs greatest rulers . Yeltsin and Gorbachev the only decent communist rulers . Brezhnev another sociopath
@MeghanMcCain Angie I met her and Jason  at the pool at MGM  in Las Vegas years ago . Both were very kind too me . I see they are divorced now a shame . Good show today I just watch . Cliff Sims seemed believable . But why does everyone write a book and turn on Trump ? They are cashing in
@NewJerseyOAG @NJCybersecurity @NJOHSP Why does this matter when you are covering up the fact that MCPO Andrew Carey has violated this law for years and makes it very public that he violates my privacy rights . So saying we have rights . Well guess what your hypocrisy is shiwing again . YOU KNOW OF CAREYS  FELONIES
@njdotcom Alvarez is GUILTY!!! So is  MCPO Andrew Carey the Felon . Gov Murphy and Gurbir know what‚Äôs going on and are covering up the truth . Murphy is Guilty  and so is MCPO Andrew Carey . They are covering up crimes and felonies .Murphy knows of Carey‚ÄôsFelonies he committed #Corruption
@MeghanMcCain I love this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@MeghanMcCain It‚Äôs a catus you don‚Äôt even need too water . It just sits in a pot ???  Now if the plant talked ?? Maybe you would have something ???

@realDonaldTrump Stop bragging your Destroying the Enviroment . You divided America more than ever with your intense hatred of people not like yourself . You surround yourself with criminals and  liars who get  indicted or imprisoned . You kiss Putin‚Äôs Ass !! You LOVE NK‚Äôs Kim a sociopath killer
@HalSparks Trump is Orange üçä is because no President ever has or ever will have skin as  good as him . Trump beams with light from the Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è so everyone can see him as a shinning example of youth and vitality . Ok Hal I just made that up . Yes I‚Äôm brilliant üòä

@MeghanMcCain I met many Holocaust Survivors when I lived in South Florida back in the 1980‚Äôs . I remember the number tattoos . Each survivor you could see the permanent emotional scars . I also met Blonde hair blue Germans who with their families were threatened withdeath if they fought back
@AronEisenberg Very impressive . The  Scandinavian countries are so more advanced on clean energy sources than the United States . It‚Äôs all shaking hands and lobbying that keeps us economically tied too OPEC and the oil industry. This will never change with The Gran Negus Trump
@FOX29philly Thank god he was found . It‚Äôs a miracle this little boy survived . God was watching over him
@thehill People us South Carolina treat dogs like dirt . Zero respect for them . Inhuman murderers
@njdotcom What Happened too Katie Brennan did happen and  Murphy Gurbir Grewel &amp; The Felin Andrew Carey are covering everything up . Gurbir is as corrupt as they come . Carey publicly confessed too his crimes and Gurbir was a witness and refused too press charges
@njdotcom I know all about the coverups because I am a victim of Horrific abuse and Harassment by MCPO Andrew Carey . Crimes and violations of my civil rights were violated . Murphy knows and is covering up for Andrew Carey . Because Carey if he tried the Brennan case would end Gov Murphy
@njdotcom Phil  Murphy  is POS !! Gurbir Grewel is a Lying Corrupt POS !! MCPO Andrew Carey is a Felon !! Murphy new about Katie Brennan . Alaverez is as Guilty as Hell . Gurbir is Covering Up Felonies committed by Andrew Carey . Andrew Carey has committed felonies and Ethics Violations.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump This was murder and both should face true jail time
@CarlHigbie @IngrahamAngle This is very true
@sunny Several weeks ago I read the FBI and NJ State Prosecutors were investigating the Golf Courses for illegal immigrants . I also read Mueller was apart of the Investigation. This was weekend after Christmas . The story dominated NJ News that weekend
@jaketapper Why are so many of your circle and people you supposedly trust are corrupt lying criminals . Why do deny al the time and get caught lying . Stop lying? Why should anybody  believe anything you say ?
@MrTommyCampbell @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs General Fake Bone Spurs . I read earlier today someone else is writing his tweets or at least the tweets he dictates and someone is actually writing them
@krassenstein Excellent point
@sunny @MauriceTyshon I agree with Sunny I‚Äôm British, Viking , German &amp; Irish  . I  celebrate  ethnic  cultures of all my heritage . So I understand your point . Celebrate and embraces and love your heritage . We are all Gods Creations

@starledger Another example of the Failed Leadership Of Governor Murphy. If the students smoked pot and were illegals then he might care
@KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia Maduro is  an Evil Corrupt Dictator who has starved his people and has basically stolen the wealth of the country . Stop supporting a Dictator. Syria and Assad is no better than Hitler . Why does Russia &amp; Putin support such evil . Reason Money / Rubles
@njdotcom Another example of Governor Murphy‚Äôs FAILED LEADERSHIP . Maybe if the kids smokdbpotcand were illegals then he would care
@AronEisenberg @realDonaldTrump I heard Trump is taking Adderal the reason for all the sniffing and ADD. Someone is writing his tweets . I‚Äôm sure we will find out who
@realDonaldTrump Stone is a crook ??? My question is why do you surround yourself with so many criminals liars and thieves  ??? I read  Kushner is  next too be indicted by Mueller . Can Don Jr or Ivanka be far behind ?
@sunny I think he opened the government too distract from the  Roger  Stone arrest . Trump is always deflecting and distracting and trying too change the story . His ego and need too have everyone focus on him . Trump has too be the center of attention . Either good or bad
@EdKrassen Agree
@NewJerseyOAG Need Pics of your Corrupt Lying Felon Criminal of an employee MCPO Andrew Carey . More &amp; More people  are finally admitting and also now know he is a Felon. Stop hiding under your turbin . Andrew Carey is a Criminal !! Gov Murphy is also Hiding from the Truth #FireCarey

@Newsweek Powerful video . I wish he was representing NJ . A dam fine politician . America needs politicians like this this . #Bravo
@njdotcom Good !!!!! Murphy is so clueless and lacks any type of leadership qualifications . Once Again NJ Politicians never fail to disappoint the State of New Jersey . Murphy also is corrupt as they come . He covers ups crimes . Especially crimes of MCPO Andrew Carey
@nj1015 @BillSpadea I just blasted Governor Murphy on that issue  on Twitter  . Christie was just as bad . Murphy MIGHT go down as second worst Governor .  Christie has the title of the worst NJ GOVERNOR
@AsburyParkPress So much corruption in The Mutphy Political Circle . Governor Murphy knows of the Felonies commmitted by MCPO Andrew Carey . Andrew Carey publicly confessed to a State Assembly Woman . Plus NJ ATTORNEY GENERAL GURBIR GREWEL was there and heard everything but still ignoring crimes
@StateDept @SecPompeo I‚Äôll hope for the best
@latimes Awful why can‚Äôt the Federal Government do something ??
@GovMurphy @POTUS Look what games your playing with the lives of the people of NJ. Your hidden your head over the criminal corruption of MCPO The Felon Andrew Carey . Property taxes going up . Insurance rates top in USA . Real jobs are needed . People can not afford   NJ. 2018A Year Of Lost Hope !

@TheKateMulgrew @SpeakerPelosi When ??  No signs yet of ending this  madness  ? When a jet crashes and American lives are lost then maybe? Fed Workers will not get back pay . Dems are equal too blame . Dems shot down a Bill too reopen and pay fed workers . Be fair Admiral Janeway
@sunny I still do not understand what work along means .
@sunny Long time coming . Maybe Mueller will finally tie everything up
@PerezHilton Yes
@HalSparks @askjillian @MaxBoot Very cool . This must have taken some time. Great job you put effort into this
@njdotcom Lie lie lie . Trust me I know from personal experience Gurbir Grewel is all talk and no action . I‚Äôve been threatened and harassed by a rogue Detective from Middlesex County and Gurbir knows all about it and does nothing . MCPO Andrew Carey is committing Felonies . Gurbir knows
@MrTommyCampbell I met Chris today on The View I was in the audience . He said Rudy was only a PR man for Trump and those crazy interviews were just for show too distract us .
@latimes I heard today from an very notable and respected TV actor that Bryan Singer  is Guilty .
@NewJerseyOAG Maybe I‚Äôll be there . Gosh what a day when a former Federal Attorney and another Attorney said Andrew Carey and his Detective are GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY

@njdotcom @SusanKLivio I totally believe Katie Brennan . MCPO The Scumbag Andrew Carey I guarantee knew he would have too open charges against Gov Murphy because he knew . Andrew Carey has committed Felonies Against me and Gov Murphy knows it as does NJ Attorney General Gurbir Grewel.
@TheSun Murderers
@MeghanMcCain @JoeBiden I want Biden for President. He has got my vote . Loved the show today . I think you and Joy agree like Felix &amp; Oscar . I think the two of should star in a sitcom . Isn‚Äôt hard too sit in those chairs if your feet do not touch the ground ?
@GMB Yes
@CoryBooker Do not forget  if a jet crashes you and the Congress &amp; Senate are too blame Trump included
@njdotcom F***ing knew this would happen because if prosecuted then it would be the end of Murphy as Go Ernie because he ignored the issues . MCPO ANDREW CAREY is a Felon and a Corrupt Lying POS . I can prove this 100% . Very very easy !!! Just DM me
@SET0331 @TheView @ChrisCuomo Free tickets
@amonster5412 I‚Äôve been to Caracas andvyge makority do kit support Madaro . That is incorrect . I‚Äôm extremely knowledgeable about Venezuela and it‚Äôs politics and economic potential .
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Agree end it today before a plane crashes !!!!! Why can‚Äôt this happen !!! Override Trump !!!!
@TheView @ChrisCuomo I saw it makes sense . I was in the audience at the show today . No free gifts today . I was expecting at least a book . Also in the Starbucks waiting room why is there never calorie free drinks . Everything is 100.% Sugar . What‚Äôs wrong with water ???
@DanCrenshawTX Agree 100000%
@irish_news Very sad story
@ConanOBrien Did you do the Bossa Nova with a rose in your mouth ?
@ChrisCuomo @TheView @CuomoPrimeTime Hello Chris excellent show . I was very interested in what you were discussing. Sneakers with a suit . Very New Yorker. I was in the audience and yes I was listening too everything . I wish your brother was my Governor . Fighting corruption in NJ  is a lot of work . MurphyCrooked
@NewJerseyOAG You should congratulate me on my accomplishments today of exposing MCPO Andrew Carey as the Felon he is . Stop Lying and do your job . End the Corruption &amp; Coverup . The news media is so wonderful . Put a sticky note on your turbin to remind you to Fire Carey the NJ TOP FELON.
@nj1015 He is guilty of using his position too get out of pAying taxes on real estate investments . This started when he was Mayor of Newark . He is scamming but then talks out of his mouth about he cares about people . Corey Booker  is 100% BS . Yes I have proof and witnesses
@sunny This man has no clue . Good show today with Chris . I love how I‚Äôm the talk when I‚Äôm at the show . It does make me chuckle . Last week I destroyed Gov Murphy on FB Live . Every time I posted he cringed turned his head started to pant. I caught him covering up and lying too NJ.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Agree
@MrTommyCampbell Lol . That‚Äôs good .
@KremlinRussia_E Putin Venezuela needs democracy to benefit the people . Maduro is a cruel and Evil Dictatorship. Stop supporting an Evil Empire . Support the United States . Look what Russia did too the Ukraine &amp; Crimea . Get your act together Vladimir .  Remain Neutral Stop Evil
@RepDanCrenshaw This fact needs to be shouted too the news media too broadcast
@nytimes Too bad Russia key ally is a evil dictatorship that must be removed for the good of the people of Venezuela
@TomKingTK I worship dogs ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@DonaldJTrumpJr What SUCKS Donny is your hunting pics of dead beautiful animals . Hunting for sport is MURDER !!!! Plain and Simple Pure Murder . Hunting for food is a totally different story !!! Also tell Little Eric his wife is becoming a National Disgrace and a Reflection of Evil .
@Reuters If Russia does not like it too bad.  Russia did not care about crimes or the Ukraine .
@ABC Anything we can do to help her . The horror this little girl has been thru . I would contribute mineyvtoo help her
@realDonaldTrump IF Cohen such a bad lawyer WHY WAS HE YOUR LAWYER FOR 10 YEARS !!!!!!

@PhillyInquirer Sorry crazy .They have no emotion or feelings . When this gator grows up he will have no problem using this guy as a snack for lunch . Get a dog Dude
@News12NJ Not today . But a beautiful Pic
@NewJerseyOAG Too bad all County Meetings did not go like this one . I remember the Middlesex County one where  The Felon  Andrew Carey confessed too the crimes he committed . Remember you and Jennifer Davenport heard everything. But your covering up  his felonies #Why???
@albinokid I‚Äôm not sure what too think ? Bryan is from Plainsboro  NJ . I lived there for 12 years no one person said anything negative about him . So I‚Äôm sure what too think ? I hope it is not true
@GeorgeTakei Balanced healthy diet with a good amount of exercise with lots of walking is the key
@GovMurphy Start by training your County Prosecutors . MCPO The Felon Andrew Carey and his Detective have accused me for years of being a drug addict.  100% LIES !!! By Andrew Carey for Illegal burglaries into my home . The FelonAndrew Carey  also LIED AND said I have weapons in my home
@TMZ I think he is much happier being in Prison  and being the boyfriend of some lucky fella . He tried and hit on me at the Jersey Shore . Mike has many issues and deserves jail time
@RandyRainbow Michael Cohen is some how related too bad good food ??? That one ??? But now Trump got to him so he would not testify to Congress .  It‚Äôs  like a bad mafia movie like Mickey Blue Eyes
@NewJerseyOAG @GCProsecutor I read write and speak Spanish . I never heard of any illegal activity of The Gloucester County Prosecutor. I guess some are law abiding . The Felon MCPO Andrew Carey is as GUILTY AS HELL !!! To this day he still committed crimes and is committing Ethics Violations #I can prove
@GovMurphy @NJDeptofHealth @NewJerseyOAG @NJ_DOC @NJDHS @NJDCF @NJLaborDept That‚Äôs wonderful . Do not forget your employee MCPO accused me countless times of being a drug addict . 100% a lie and slander . The illegal excuse for bugularizing my home and causing thousands of dollars in damage . Ex OCPO LYIN JOE CORANATO DID THE SAME FELONY BOTH GUILTY 100%
@MeghanMcCain @SirPatStew I met Patrick twice . A great guy and excellent starship captain
@NewJerseyOAG @GovMurphy I NEVER TOOK A DRUG IN MY LIFE BUT I WAS ACCUSED COUNTLESS TIMES BY MCPO ANDREW CAREY &amp; OCPO LYIN JOE CORANATO. JUST MORE LIES AND SLANDER USED AS EXCUSES TOO ILLEGALLY BURGULARIZE MY HOME . DID I EVER GET AN APOLOGY???? NO JUST $$$$$ THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE TO MY HOME .
@HuffPost Ben‚Äôs  right

@NBCNews Very sad
@nypost Cool

@PrisonPlanet That‚Äôs a Big Lie . I‚Äôm glad you reported it
@EdKrassen Your kidding . This is F UP . Exactly a war hero and a Vietnam bet and not invited is awful . It‚Äôs just getting worse
@NewJerseyOAG Total BS !!! Until you do your job and stop the Felonies committed by your employee Andrew Carey. Until then  EVERYTHING you say is TOTAL HYPOCRISY!!! You know exactly what  saying  is . 100%  THE TRUTH !!!  #FIRECAREY
@GovMurphy @realDonaldTrump PHIL START WITH THE FELON MCPO. ANDREW CAREY AND HIS DETECTIVE  WHO HAVE  BROKEN  EVERY LAW POSSIBLE . STOP PREACHING  AND ACTUAL  DO YOUR JOB BY STOPPING THE CONTINUING FELONIES OF ANDREW CAREY .
@NewJerseyOAG Please !!!!! The people of NJ need too know that you talk the talk . But in reality allow you harassment and discrimination . Do not forget you heard the confession of MCPO Andrew Carey and what his Detective has done . So DO NOT PRETEND YOU CARE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT GIVE A S**T!!!
@CarlHigbie How classy
@soledadobrien Rudy saved NYC . NYC is a shining example of how Rudy turned the city around from the crime ridden drug infested city it was .
@JrzyJoePiscopo Hey Joe happy Tuesday
@realDonaldTrump Stop quoting Fox News aka is Fake News . It‚Äôs totally one sided . Clinton‚Äôs are Guilty as are you . Resign for the good of The Nation .
@davidgoggins Agree
@GeorgeTakei But the gov still closed . So Nancy needs too be more than of a politician . Nobody is winning this shutdown . People are going hungry
@MrTommyCampbell Today I kept thinking about Canadians . NJ weather is so cold it‚Äôs not safe too walk outside . But your Winter is much tougher than ours is .  How do you get through these terrible freezing  temps ? Counting down the days till Spring‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è
@CNN Very  very bad  parents !!!! Then the kids are only partially too blame
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Wrong !!!!! These kids are racists monsters !!!!! Look at ALL  the video footage.
@nypost Trump got it wrong against !!!
@njdotcom Firefighters are Tiral Superheroes
@AC360 @CNN @andersoncooper Trump is Guilty Guilty Guilty !!!!  Hello Anderson  I hope you did not ride your bike today . A tad bit chilly
@NewJerseyOAG Well I heard you talk . But you just called yourself a HYPOCRITE. You &amp; Gov Murphy know of the Felonies committed by MCPO Andrew Carey . Years of criminal activity. But you have done nothing to promote justice . You let your employees break laws and commit crimes. #DOYOUR JOB !!!
@ProudResister Agree more and more video shows these kids are just bad news . Shame on them and Shane on their parents . They just did not started acting this way because they are far from home . I also saw Nathan Phillips was trying too protect them from the Black  Muslims . Not a goodday inDC
@HamillHimself Labs are brilliant my black lab Patrick open the refrigerator door , ate  then close it . We caught him the act . But he even got more hugs and kisses . I worship my dogs
@Sethrogen @Travon They look good
@MeghanMcCain Looking for Wile Coyote &amp; The Road Runner . Yes I agree I‚Äôll take Arizona weather over this cold
@TheRekhaSharma Never saw this happen?? Gremlins or perhaps Oompa Loompas ??
@realDonaldTrump When are you going to condemn the Covington Catholic Students ??? Still wAiting !!!! These kids DO NOT MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
@robreiner Rob this is not the Rudy I met a few times at the St Pats Parade in NYC . It‚Äôs like he has Dementia . This is not the Rudy I know . Trump is 100% Guilty . I read today that Don Jr &amp; Ivanka can be indicted  . This from a US Federal Attorney . Like Nixon the  players first then DT
@krassenstein I would like them too do The Laverne &amp; Shirley intro as they are being carted off too jail .
@ProudResister It‚Äôs being a disrespect jerk . Catholic school kids too . I‚Äôm Irish Catholic and I have never ever or would ever act like this
@BarackObama Why have not you spoke out against the government shut down
@HillReporter Why ??
@NBCNews Really !!!
@StarTrek Meeting George &amp; Nichelle for the first time at my first convention . Also being hit on by Grace Lee Whitney . Plus the 50th where I met all cast members from all Star Trek tv shows at one time
@NewJerseyOAG Really Gurbir ??? You have no problem with my Civil Rights being violated time and time again by the Felon MCPO Andrew Carey &amp; his Detective . Guess what I count or are you Discriminating against me ? So far that has been the case !!
@GMA @ABC Super cool moon
@realDonaldTrump Oh God your talking out your mouth again . Donald you enacted legislation against LGBT . You have almost zero representation of people with different ethnicity in your Administration.
@DailyMirror Bizarre
@Rosie Like Rosie &amp; Betty Rubble
@nypost Ute but sorry Pit bulls can not be trusted too many incidents
@SamChampion Love the pics of the moon very very cool
@TMZ Neither
@EdKrassen Me too but she now looks bad because she did not take the deal and work on improving the outcome . The 800,000 Americans out of work plus their families are not very happy with  Donald   Trump  or Nancy
@MrTommyCampbell Me too I want my own cooking show . I call myself ‚ÄúThe Magic Chef ‚Äú.  I put my heart into my cooking so everything I gotta admit is fantastic . I also met tons of celebrity chefs . Ina Garten &amp; Bobby Flay are my fav chefs right next w . Been on The Chew 10 times . Love Prime Ribs
@JrzyJoePiscopo Sad but it‚Äôs part of the job . We pray it will not happen but it will snd must except the fact . Like Firemen who put their lives on the line everyday too protect the public
@HalSparks Nope not the same . Close though
@TeamPelosi Nancy he tried too make s Deal . Now you look like the Bad Guy . Time too open the Government. Enough of the games .
@realDonaldTrump Yes you did give  a good speech with a good proposal . Democrats should have took the offer . Nancy I will tweet with on the offer
@PerezHilton Is he Kidding ??? The stuff that comes out of his mouth . Now he is pist off because his wife is teaching at a school that discriminates against LGBT and everyone is tweeting not nice tweets about her . Last time I check God Created LGBT People so Pence is going against God
@realDonaldTrump Melania is a beautiful kind and wonderful First Lady treat her with respect . Do not forget Donald the way you Treat Melania also effects Baron #BeKind
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump lol
@EdKrassen Agree
@KDKA Treasonous
@krassenstein Agree good points
@AronEisenberg Still waiting too hear  Trumps  response . Where was the adult supervision ? Most definitely these kids should be disciplined
@TVWinegar @GovMurphy Glad Murphy state of emergency covers warm sunny days too . Makes him look like an idiot more than usual
@THR Good the reboot totally sucked !!!! I even told Chris Hemsworth I want a refund and too write me a check
@TheRock @nbctitangames @8pm @nbc Love these kind of shows üëçüëç
@mchooyah I dived with sharks countless times . A Bull , Tiger are unpredictable. I know people in California say in the Kelp Fields that Great whites are more afraid of humans than we are of them . But I will be happy to observe them in a cage . No desire too be lunch
@Andy @BuzzFeed Wow not very nice . Andy now do 500 push-ups . I did today
@GMA Gym , Work &amp; Cooking
@UKParliament I got it right
@AronEisenberg Someone has too tell him what too say . Trump is Clueless
@chucktodd @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Trump just lied . He tweeted hispanics are all in love with him poll numbers are soaring . Except trump forgot too mention who put out the poll
@realDonaldTrump Your lying again
@realDonaldTrump Did you build this too . Trump Casino closed and people out of work in Atlantic City https://t.co/JwKirrtdsI
@nypost Very common . Cops in my town sell drugs too. Illegals students . It‚Äôs common knowledge and the police do not care
@JuddApatow Why has Trump not denounce this altercation yet ?
@greggrunberg I want this
@ProudResister I never ever heard a priest talk this way . He actually sounds racist too me
@krassenstein Really he did ? Well take that as s compliment.
@RHH01NJ @GovMurphy @NC_Governor @realDonaldTrump @USGC It‚Äôs 45 degrees and warm and only a mist of rain ??? State of emergency for this ??? He read my tweet about how he failed NJ on every major storm . I tweeted NJ has ZERO confidence in his ability too lead
@PerezHilton She can do better than that . Brad is an alcoholic . Plus Brad is sexually fluid I guess is the correct term . I know guys who slept with him .
@sunny Very immature obvious kids . I wonder  what their parents think . I think it‚Äôs a topic that you or Meghan should raise on The View . These kids are immature brats who I guarantee are D students . D is not for Dandy either
@EdKrassen I think your right I tweeted Rudy and said for God Sakes just Run away from Run as fast as you can . I met Rudy a few times at St Pats Parade in NYC . This is not the Giuliani I  know not even close . It‚Äôs like he has dementia . I do not  recognize him at all .
@normmacdonald Wild Bill‚Äôs Buffalo Wings or a TGIF‚Äôs
@MrTommyCampbell Must definitely bad examples of just immature jerks . Their parents need too kick their A** . I wonder what their parents think of their kids disrespecting elderly people . Lots of growing up too do
@krassenstein I just googled Aderall . I think you are correct . Trump most definitely is taking something . All that sniffling . Like he is sniffing lines of coccaine
@DailyMirror 25 I pray for this little Angel . God Bless him
@KellyO Sneakers
@CNBC Sign me up I work there
@ConservBlog @GovMurphy @USCG Makes Murphy look worse . Murphy lies and is so corrupt . He hides crimes of his administration even though knows what‚Äôs going on . Murphy should be brought up on Ethics Violations
@MrTommyCampbell @realDonaldTrump Lol . I‚Äôll be working so I‚Äôll not be watching
@TheOnlyEdAsner It‚Äôs obnoxious kids behaving badly . It‚Äôs wrong and these kids are kids immature and need time too grow up . 5 years from now they will look back and realize how badly they were behaving . Also reflection on their parents
@hwinkler4real ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@GeorgeTakei Yes has energy and youth and excitement too do the right thing for the people . She can not be bought . That scares them the most
@EdKrassen Love this too

@NewJerseyOAG What about illegal Burglaries committed by MCPO Andrew Carey and his Detective. #Adding up the Felonies !!!!
@guskenworthy @realDonaldTrump Agree
@BillyBaldwin The kid was being an obnoxious brat . He is immature 5 years from now he will see what a jerk he was .
@JohnCena Totally respect honest people . I  not a fan of people who lie
@DailyMirror No
@tommydidario @CrunchGym I have not done the rope eirkoutbin a while .
@robreiner You are correct. Too much evidence of Trump criminally indictable behavior
@RudyGiuliani True Hollywood does see only one side .
@hitRECordJoe My mushroom and black olive pizza I made from scratch https://t.co/PSzC7YZ8Ds
@DebraMessing This kid is just being a kid . Ignorant smart a** . Does not show any respect for adults . He thinks he is cool but in 5 years he will look back and know what a jerk he is
@tyhenrymedium Way up north . Tyler need too do an Atlantic City event or even an Asbury Park one
@EdKrassen Mueller was in charge of the Gotti case I did know that
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsay I‚Äôm very very disappointed in the way your leading !!! I can not believe how much you changed in the your direction since John McCains death .

YOU YOU shut down the gov and hurting Americans . You always LIE LIE LIE . You treat  Melania  like dirt !!! Your DESTROYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
@EricTrump Wrong !!!!
@MyCentralJersey Who will be taking MCPO position once Andrew Carey is Fired and Indicted  for committing Felonies and Ethics violations !!! NJ Attorney General Gurbir Grewel is fully aware of the Felonies of Andrew Carey . Governor Murphy is fully Aware of Carey‚Äôs Felonies #FireCarey
@VP @POTUS @WhiteHouse That‚Äôs a very nice story . Not crazy about your wife working for a school that is anti LGBT . What kind of message does that send out to America . Wrong message . Very Disappointing
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm counting down the days . Why did Cohen get a black eye and arm in a sling surely not for fighting for the last pair of shoes at   Macy‚Äôs
@startrekcbs Robert Shevlin
@NewJerseyOAG Good place too lock up Andrew Carey and his Detective  for the  Felonies they Committed
@NewJerseyOAG Do not forget about me and how my civil rights were abused by MCPO Andrew Carey. The Felonies were committed and as you know there is no denying the crimes . Maybe I should be a guest  lecturer . I can talk about you &amp;  Gov Murphy are ignoring Civil Rights Violations by MCPO
@NBCPhiladelphia @GovMurphy 2024 wow big deal !!!!
@JoePiscopoShow @JrzyJoePiscopo @TomiLahren @foxnation A compromise must be reached !!! I‚Äôm a Republican and I can not see how any true Republican would listen or trust Trump ever again . He has lied sooo much nothing he said or will say I believe
@NewJerseyOAG WTF GURBIR !!! You state  your Zero Tolerance Policy But ALLOW MCPO ANDREW CAREY TOO COMMIT FELONIES . ALL THE ENDLESS CRIMES HIS DETECTIVE HAS DONE PLUS HIMSELF !!!! WHERE IS YOUR ZERO  TOLERANCE POLICY !!!! STOP PICKING AND CHOOSING LAWS WHICH YOU WANT TOO FOLLOW !!!
@Newsweek Wrong wrong wrong

@NewJerseyOAG When are you going too Charge MCPO Andrew Carey for the Felonies he committed . Do not forget you were a witness to his public confession as well as Jennifer Davenport and an NJ STATE Assembly Woman
@JrzyJoePiscopo I loved watching Ali fight with my grandfather when I was a kid . Great memories .
@SethMacFarlane #WillPeter ever go on a Keto Diet ??? Will Meg ever take off that hat ? Will Lois finally come out as a Lesbian? Will Brian be nurtured ? Will Stewie finally have the world under his control ? Will Putin marry Trump and Honeymoon on The Black Sea ?
@GeorgeTakei Please Christie‚Äôs summer house is right over Barnegat Bay 10 minutes away . Seeing Christie in his daisy dukes shorts is enough too make me go blind . Never mind the tie . I pass his house when I bike ride

@BetteMidler There is big rumor circulating today by I can not remember who but a medical professional who states Trump is using some type of drug before he goes on sir . Might be an illegal one
@GovMurphy Awesome  my Question is You are fully aware of the Felonies committed by MCPO Andrew Carey and are covering up crimes . This is a violation of your Oath of Office  . This is also a Serious  Violation  Of Ethics by You &amp; NJ Attorney General GURBIR GREWEL. How Can NJ  TRUST YOU ??
@TheAdvocateMag @billyeichner @BachelorABC Billy should be it‚Äôs about time he lose his virginity
@iamcolinquinn I was in the audience for your talk show I met you . You were very kind and nice . Why isn‚Äôt Lorne  Michaels not doing more tv shows or sitcoms that are independent of SNL . A tremendous amount of talent is not being utilized in entertainment
@realDonaldTrump Comrade Donald Open The Federal Government!!! You are the problem ask Putin !!! Putin controls you . What does Putin have on You ???
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Are you Kidding or did your neighbor kick you butt again !!!! I guess the four dead soldiers in Syria do not count !!! Stop supporting a President who is Destroying America . I‚Äôm a Republican and I‚Äôm DISGUSTED WITH TRUMP . Say Hello too Moscow &amp;. Comrade Putin

@krassenstein @TwitterSupport Very very cool
@krassenstein It‚Äôs almost a sitcom now like a Laverne &amp; Shirley Episode reminds me of
@nypost Wrong wrong wrong . It was cheap cheap cheap !!! It should have been a bbq . It‚Äôs insulting too suggest college athletes only eat fast food . Stketed do not become athletes by eating McDonald‚Äôs
@RobertPicardo Rudy keeps changing his ind
@News12NJ I did sign
@njdotcom Over prepared are you kidding ?? He is totally clueless !!!! He has failed NJ ON EVERY STORM!!! Even Christie says he sucks  !!! Guess what he does !! Plus Murphy lies and covers up crimes committed by people who work for him . I can prove every word I‚Äôm saying
@people Awesome . I like Michael very much . I personal know him . He is a great guy plus he understands what real food it
@washingtonpost Da !! You think it is very obvious!!
@washingtonpost WTF!!!! Than whose fault is it ??? Chris Christie aka Fatboy is a Corrupt Lying dirtbag . I can prove it very easily. Feel free too DM me
@GovMurphy Big Deal?? I was told by a Toms River Cop you are fully aware of the Felonies committed by MCPO Andrew Carey . Phil You are hiding and covering up Felonies Committed . How can NJ Residents Trust You if you Violated YOUR Oath Of Office !!! Gurbir Grewel is just as GUILTY
You WILL be Arrested! Frank Moschella #369 Toms River Police https://t.co/0qilUNL4V6 via @YouTube I had too share this video of the Enormouscorruption of the Toms River NJ Police . TRPD Lies commits crimes violates tremendous amount of law . Detectives also falsify police reports
@krassenstein Totally agree
@RobertPicardo @TrekMovie Congratulations Bob
@Pontifex Totally Agree
@krassenstein It‚Äôs insulting the food he served . This should have been a wonderful memory!!! Awful fast food that probably gave stomach aches too Athletes who are used too eating healthy . PR would have been better is it was wonderful cater food . TRUMP cannot stand paying .
@realDonaldTrump Open the government then get the Democrats and negotiate a deal . You Are CAUSING SUFFERRING TOO AMERICANS!!! What Happened To Mexico too pay for the wall . YOU LIED YOO AMERICA TOO GET ELECTED
@SecPompeo Very surprising but finally a welcoming change . Venezuela needs too be more assertive and take control of their country . It‚Äôs about time
@washingtonpost It might nit be politically correct but it‚Äôs called FREEDOM OF SPEECH
@NBCNews I like that action
@soledadobrien Great story üëçüëç
@News_Letter Wrong !!!!!!! But learning foreign  languages are very important. Chinese needs too be taught for future economic reasons
@guskenworthy Maybe these guys wrote can not  how  by or buy is used correctly are the men Gillette is ising in their commercial??
