For every parent out there, vote so that you want have to worry about recieving a text saying that their child is currently having to be evacuated or hiding from an active shooter. Vote so that you can go to your place of worship and not have to worry about being killed.

Why Is it that we haven't done anything about Climate Change because by 2030 it could be to late. Why is it that Just like me so many young generations might not have something to look forward to, because there environment is being taken away from them.
These Are American Citizens and all Trump has to say is that if there were more guards maybe this wouldn't happen. Why is that we live in a world where there have been the most deaths by gunshots. Why is that we are on the brink of taking health care away from Millions.
Republican , Democrat , or Independent this is something that everyone should come to the table willingly and discuss. These are American lives, the one's that Trump so heavily promised to protect by putting American's first.
Hate Crimes are increasing by the day, and there has been barely action done to fix this. As a American Citizen, You should feel safe in your place of worship and not have to worry about being killed. You shouldn't have to go to school thinking about being killed.
