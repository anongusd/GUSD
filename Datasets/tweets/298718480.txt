@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Blocked for zionist extremism
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold So? They commit war crimes and have nukes. You keep spreading anti muslim tropes. Racist
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold No safe place?  There are plenty of safe places. And israel makes it harder for worldwide jewry, as many people falsely blame jews for israels war crimes and lobbying of foreign governments.
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold Im not sure thats true. I know its not.  Im guessing you were  educated in israel...lol
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Pontius pilate didnt want to kill him, the pharisees did. I dont blame modern jews, they didnt do it
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold So you didnt defend the israeli government?  You think its ok to steal land and persecute people just because your people were persecuted?
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold I dont make everything demonized. Israel kills children. Israel is illegally occupying another country. These are facts too
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold I dont deny that israel did that. But do you deny israel also kills africans, sends weapons to death squads, supported nazi like south african apartheid, etc?
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold What? You keep changing the subject. I dont even know wtf youre talking about
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold Do you think israel doesnt kill children?  Lol, what a hasbara troll you are! So phony
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold https://t.co/U0caZIdtDq
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold While you tell Palestinians to give up their ancestral homeland, you say, "where were my relatives supposed to go when they got driven out?"  Do you see the irony yet?
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Egyptians are not Palestinians are not syrians are not jordanians are not moroccans are not malaysians are not saudis.  Another anti muslim trope, "theyre sll the same"
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold You dont have thousands of years of family records, lol! Radical zionists say that all the time. Complete revisionist nonsense. Some Palestinians do have keys to the houses your people stole from them, though
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Of course those historical events are terrible. Jews did kill Jesus, but he was a jew too. Jews are just people like anyone else...some good, some bad. Why do you change the subject? Irish have been oppressed throughout history too, not so much now though
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold Netanyahu? Isnt pm of israel?  I criticize my government all the time. But you defend your governments atrocities. Thats how we are different.
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold Of course i care about those places and people. But am i not allowed to criticize israel just because someone else in the world also does violence? Could you imagine how weak of a defense that would be in court? "Yeah, I killed him...but other people murder too!"
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold But nowhere near a majority until European refugees came and committed terror and a violent ethnic cleansing.
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold No amount of arabs in whatever jobs can make me forget about the piles of dead bodies israel has created. Many of them, children.
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold I dont need your hasbara.

@CoopJay1 @Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold When the muslim empire conquered palestine, that doesnt mean all the natives were killed. Also, living somewhere for a thousand years means youre native. Possibly having some ancestors from somewhere far away thousands of years ago, means you are not native to that place.
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold You have only positive things to say about jews, and only negative stereotypes about muslims.  Do you realize that?
@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Whats your point? Thats all BEFORE the league of nations, UN, and geneva conventions. Do you get that? There were people living there before jewish refugees fled europe

@Ctruth4all @CoopJay1 @ArielElyseGold Oh yeh? I think youre lying. There has also been a non jewish presence for more than 3000 years! Its always been a very mixed area; egyptians, greeks, persians, romans, jews, philistines, assyrians, caananites, etc.  So again, why does that give the land to jews, but not others?
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold So? Whats your point. Your prime minister has blonde hair and blue eyes...not exactly a desert native! Lol
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold You keep showing just how extremist you are.  Calling an entire country of people "made up"...imagine if someone called jews "a made up people"!  Palestinians have been living there at least as long as jews. Even jews say they came from egypt, babylon, and the persian gulf
@Ctruth4all @ArielElyseGold Thats false.  Do you think the land was empty before 1948?  Are you trying to deny Palestinians ancestral ties to that land?

@shortyroc1979 @KamalaHarris Thats wrong.  Whoever told you that is lying or misinformed.  70% tax rate is not for #MedicareForAll , but it would only apply to every dollar earned AFTER your ten millionth dollar.

@shortyroc1979 @KamalaHarris Lol, thats a myth. Name me one time in history that has happened. We used to have a 70-90% top tax rate from the 1940s-1980s, until reagan destroyed our way of life. Where will the rich go? Europe? They will pay taxes here if they want to do business here.
@shortyroc1979 @KamalaHarris Not true at all.  #MedicareForAll saves money for 90+% of americans.  It lowers costs.  Other countries spend half of what we do per capita AND cover everyone AND get better results.
@GovEvers #LegalizeCannabis #LegalizeIt  why would we want the only legal drugs to be alcohol and tobacco, two of the most destructive.		Deaths per year:	Tobacco: 400,000+ (more than all Americans who died in ww2 EVERY year!)	Alcohol: 40,000	Cannabis: about zero

@_th1nk3r @girlziplocked Just like in real life. Lol. We ignore the fact that america created al qaeda and isis, allowing the same warmongers to seize power here. And big business supports fascism wherever it rears its ugly head
@Author_JLPerez @girlziplocked She couldnt deal with anakin turning to the dark side. I didnt like that one line that implies padme "gave up" to death.  Also, anakin definitely felt betrayed that she sided with obi wan, whether they hooked up or not. Jedi are supposed to be celibate...but anakin wasnt! lol
@occultproblems @joebos617 @girlziplocked Thats a good point.  I think they wanted han to be a good guy in a tough situation rather than being a murderer. Also, i think they wanted to soften his image because star wars toys became very popular for children
@AlexanderJB89 @girlziplocked No, it gave all its power to palpatine to deal with the war...that he started in secret. He controlled both sides of the war, declared himself emperor
@simonetheartist @girlziplocked Darth is dead, so every name is a dead name, lol. And darth is a title, not a name
@AlexanderJB89 @girlziplocked The jedi are a shadow of their former glory, even in the prequels. The republic is at war with the trade federation and seperatists, emperor takes control of both, ends the war, starts the empire
@msemmajameson @girlziplocked @AOC  gets my vote!
@joebos617 @girlziplocked They wanted han to be a rogue, but redeemable. Showing him murder someone right away didnt fit with that. I like the original "han shoots first" too
@jorm @girlziplocked But then, to hide princess leia on her mothers homeworld wouldn't make sense, especially to hide as princess of her mothers homeworld.

@BrianSKotkin @girlziplocked No one knows.  The jedi order, even in 1,2,3 isnt what it used to be
@bananders @girlziplocked If you assassinate a leader, the next bad guy just takes over
@simonetheartist @girlziplocked He respects anakins name change. He is no longer anakin
@SarahTaber_bww @girlziplocked Not true.  Emperor took over once. No other tyrant overthrew the galactic political order
@Author_JLPerez @girlziplocked I think anakin killed her, thought she was cheating with obi wan
@_th1nk3r @girlziplocked Why dont we?
@emy_aze @girlziplocked Rogue one
@pad_illa @girlziplocked Ghost jedi!  And he was taught by anakin how to live forever, and anakin was the reincarnation of a jedi/sith (no father, made by the force)
@girlziplocked Why didnt qui gon jin go back for anakins mom?  He left her to be a slave concubine for 15 years, get killed by sand people, anakin goes to the dark side. The jedi couldnt afford to buy her freedom?
