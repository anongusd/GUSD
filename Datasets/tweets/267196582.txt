@DeafInMedia @tvtropes A5: They can be bad, they can be good. But where Deaf characters are concerned, often, they're one-dimensional and comprised of different tropes. No complexity, no originality. Take characters who are Asian, one-dimensional and comprised of tropes -- cringeworthy. #DeafInMedia
@DeafInMedia A3: Non-Deaf characters who follow Deaf characters around and voice everything they say, while themselves having little to no value to the plot. #DeafInMedia
@DeafInMedia A2: The Deaf love interest who shows up for a few episodes or a few pages then disappears. #DeafInMedia

@OneOddGamerGirl I believe Titles II and III of ADA would apply if, for ex, u &amp; ur classmates are arequired to view each other’s videos. Title III for ex: as a student u must be provided w/ “full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges...” of the university

There is nothing "functionally equivalent" in possibly waiting more than 5x as long to connect to VRS than to 911 @FCC
Consequently, 911 callers who rely on video relay services (VRS) wait much longer to connect to VRS than to connect to 911
