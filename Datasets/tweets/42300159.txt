The NOW is the only moment you live.
"If you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail"
Be the person your dog thinks you are.
What's not repaired only gets repeated.
Never confuse people's resistance to change, with their resistance of being manipulated.
Cheating isn't just kissing, touching, or flirting. If you have to delete text messages so your partner won't see them your already there...
People with good intentions make promises. People with good character keep them.
Never love anyone who treats as ordinary.
The beautiful thing about dogs is that when you show them honor and respect, they return the same to you a thousand fold.
‚ÄúIt's hard to beat a person who never gives up‚Äù - Babe Ruth.
Trust and Love are Verbs.

If you don't pass your values on to your kids, someone else in your neighborhood will.
Relationships are built on understanding, if what you want is not respected, then you shouldn't be surprised with what you get. No Joy.

Be the person your dog thinks you are.
What's not repaired only gets repeated.
Never confuse people's resistance to change, with their resistance of being manipulated.
Cheating isn't just kissing, touching, or flirting. If you have to delete text messages so your partner won't see them your already there...
People with good intentions make promises. People with good character keep them.
Never love anyone who treats as ordinary.
The beautiful thing about dogs is that when you show them honor and respect, they return the same to you a thousand fold.

If you don't pass your values on to your kids, someone else in your neighborhood will.
Relationships are built on understanding, if what you want is not respected, then you shouldn't be surprised with what you get. No Joy.
Successful people make the most of the best and the best of the worst.
"It always seems impossible, until it's done." -Nelson Mandela
