RT @charliespiering: - @realDonaldTrump speech clocks in at 2 hours 4 minutes after he took the stage
Trump invites everyone to Washington, DC, on the Fourth of July: "We want to bring millions of people into the city." #CPAC2019
Trump: "After decades of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation." #CPAC2019
Trump on #NorthKorea: "We actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. ... North Korea has a brilliant economic future if they make a deal." #CPAC2019
Trump on #NorthKorea: "In one way, I have to negotiate, in the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto. He was a special young man, and to see what happened -- it was so bad. So bad."
Trump calls meetings with Kim Jong Un "productive." "I look forward to maybe doing something at some point... . But I had to walk because every once in awhile you have to walk." #CPAC2019
This CPAC has felt like the youngest and most diverse it‚Äôs been in my last several years of going. Lots of energy with the young folks like @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO @RaheemKassam @KyleKashuv and many others. #CPAC2019
Trump, talking about young Americans, announces (?) @RealCandaceO is getting married. ‚ÄúSeems like a nice guy to me.‚Äù #CPAC2019
Trump: ‚ÄúAmerica will never be a socialist country! Ever.‚Äù #CPAC2019
Trump, facetiously: ‚ÄúI do like the Green New Deal. I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election!‚Äù #CPAC2019

O'Shaughnessy when asked if deploying troops is just a political stunt: "I firmly believe that border security is national security."
O'Shaughnessy on top line figures of US troop deploying to the border: "I can tell you 5,239 is not the top line... . There will be additional force over and above the 5,239."
O'Shaughnessy: "This caravan is different fm what we've see in the past...we have seen...organization at a higher level than we've ever seen before... violence...as they've passed other intl borders we've seen them behave in a nature that is not what we have seen in the past."
O'Shaughnessy on whether there'll be a situation where troops are shooting migrants: "The US mil personnel that are going have very clear guidance that we've given them. It's the standard rules for the use of force. It's similar to if we were going to any location within the US."
O'Shaughnessy on #tentcities: "The request that we have right now from DHS &amp; CBP is to build tents to support CBP personnel &amp; our military personnel. ... There very well could be further requests of which we wld respond to if required to build additional or separate facilities."

O'Shaughnessy: As we looked at this &amp; the capabilities we needed to bring to bear, Sec Mattis just looked at where those capabilities reside, how do we best get it to support DHS &amp; b/c we already had a [complimentary] effort w/DHS it was natural to go to a Title X response here.
O'Shaughnessy on troops being armed: "Because there cld be incidental interaction between our mil members and migrants ... we are making sure that our soldiers, our Marines, are going to be fully trained on how to do that interaction. They're going to understand the rules."
O'Shaughnessy on whether US troops at the border will handle migrants: "CBP personnel are absolutely the primary and principle members that will be handling specifically the migrants."
O'Shaughnessy on border deployments: "The cost is unknown at this time."
O'Shaughnessy on total # of US troops to deploy to the border: "It's really undetermined at this point b/c as we look and continue to work w/DHS &amp; CBP, we've been given clear guidance of what they need initially, and then as we cont. to refine the requests...that # will change."
O'Shaughnessy says number of troops going to Texas from seven different installations is about 1,800. There are also 870 part of the HQs there that will be engaged in command and control. Those troops will be fully in place in Texas by Wednesday.
Gen. O'Shaughnessy on US troops at the border: "Right now we have a little over a thousand that are actually in place right now in Texas. That number is literally as we speak changing because you have additional forces that are moving in today to Texas."

.@thejointstaff Chairman Dunford says he did not recommend that US troops come home from #Afghanistan coming from a broader national security standpoint. #MRE2018 https://t.co/IESuZZZGPl
Good back and forth between military press (@JournoGeoffZ and @JimLaPorta) and our top military leader @thejointstaff Chairman Gen. Dunford on #Afghanistan at #MRE2018.
Dunford pushes back on @JournoGeoffZ's Q: In 2013, we had 140K troops...It's 2018, we have 15K on the grnd, security has not significantly deteriorated. I wldn't tell you for a sec, I wld not say success is right around the corner. It's abt making incremental progress over time.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, when asked about Trump pulling out of the #Iran deal: "Our job is to implement policy and not judge policy." Adds his job is provide the president with advice privately, and if that's eroded that, he has nothing to offer.
Chairman of the @thejointstaff: Gen. Dunford on #Afghanistan: I think it's a mistake to get myopically focused on the military dimension...I'm encouraged that the political [developments] today are much more clear than they have been at any other point in the last 15 years."
On #Afghanistan, Gen. Dunford says there has to be political pressure, social pressure, and military pressure on the #Taliban. Says commander Gen. Miller has "made some adjustments" after the insider attack in Kandahar. Key is the reconciliation process over the next several mos.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford on US troops to southern border: "No deployment orders have been signed." Says the support will be likely rotary wing support, logistical support, engineering support. Requirements will be developed "over the course of days."
Chairman of the @thejointstaff Gen. Dunford: I don't believe the defeat of terrorism is around the corner. Says the military is continuing to apply the pressure on #ISIS. #MRE2018
