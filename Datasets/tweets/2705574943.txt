@Sutalffa Exactly
@Sutalffa Not in depth but yes I have it all makes sense. I just think that the original thread was a condemnation of the lack of compassion and intelligence by some of these critics of immigration and I did not see it as un-nuanced as you did
@Sutalffa I mean I haven’t spent the majority of my time thinking about it but one must have compassion (or benevolence) and intelligence in order to effect meaningful and helpful policy, especially in this area. So what I meant was there needs to be both, in balance
@Sutalffa Agreed on evil geniuses, but there is also something to be said for expertise. Especially around a topic which has a lot of misinformation spread around it. I think there is a more nuanced view there then just only intelligence and only benevolence.
@Sutalffa That wasn’t my point at all. I was just saying I have a little knowledge on the subject to explain why I thought that thread was worth reading. It was an explanation of my thought process. I’m not entirely certain what you thought I was trying to do

@njh2005 I answered it twice.
@njh2005 I already told you the the standards and definitions I would use.
@njh2005 No by her presentation and emotions and decision. But your continued usage of male pronouns show that your mind is already made up and this conversation is pretty much useless and you will discount whatever I say
@njh2005 A woman. But you would say man. I think this discussion is finished for this reason.
@njh2005 This is what I meant by fundamental misunderstanding. This isn’t a useful conversation anymore. I doubt either of us will convince the other.
@njh2005 Pretend royalty and gender identity aren’t the same and saying they are is facetious and delusional and not helpful
@njh2005 *so
@njh2005 You are just being facetious and do this conversation is useless and finished
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion A small number doesn’t mean nonexistent and my point was simply that genitalia is not the be all end all for determining gender or sex
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion Correct. And Manning has decided she would like everyone to refer to her as a woman. By refusing to do so in her case and other cases you are being disrespectful and misunderstanding what it means to be trans since you refuse to acknowledge it is fundamental to them.
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion And it is a question of respect if someone has specifically asked you to use one set of pronouns and you insist on using the other. That is the definition of being disrespectful. To be honest it’s more than that, but it is disrespectful
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion That is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender and also how sex works. There are people who have neither genitalia (since I assume that’s how you define men and women) or have both or have them malformed. You are saying being trans doesn’t exist
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion Also your opinion on whether or not she would be executed doesn’t mean she is entitled to zero decency from anyone else I would just like to point out
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion But would you respect anyone else’s preferred pronouns? Because it doesn’t seem like you would. But my point about their tweet still stands.
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion Even though the tweet calls her a traitor no one is talking about that. We’re all just arguing about respect and pronouns. Which I assume was not the purpose
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion I very clearly read the tweet since that is what I responded to. Her rights don’t force you to be a respectful and decent person, but here’s to hoping you do anyway.
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion Also the slash of the two pronouns was clearly meant to be purposely provocative. Which is silly since no one is even thinking about the point of being a traitor.
@njh2005 @ReaganBattalion No but refusing to use her correct pronoun isn’t respecting that right which was my original point.
@ReaganBattalion Shouldn’t you respect that right then?
@MonicaLewinsky Three years since I came to terms with being sexually assaulted two years before and then in the same month someone broke into my house and tried to assault me. Every day I feel stronger and less alone than before.
@ReaganBattalion I won’t even start on “transgenderism,” I’ll just note you should say “being transgender”
@ReaganBattalion Can you please just use the correct pronouns? It completely undercuts your actual message which could actually resonate with people.

@Michael2014abc @MegKinnardAP If it's redundant it could be the opposite of common courtesy, it could be seen as condescending since it would be assumed by anyone.
@Michael2014abc @MegKinnardAP It would be a pointless exercise in stating the obvious
@Michael2014abc @MegKinnardAP But why would they even think to say it when the person they are talking to should know better than anyone it could be recorded?
@Michael2014abc @MegKinnardAP It's not about difficulty, it's just that no one would think to do it
@Michael2014abc @MegKinnardAP But they shouldn't have to. Everything is assumed to be on the record and public so that would be redundant
