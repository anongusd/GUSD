@JonathanTurley The majority of Americans don't know their next door neighbor.  We are "dumbed down"  given false information, and disconnected from actual politicians, legislators are making laws 'on a daily basis' without a thought as to how it will negatively affect their constituents.
@HillaryClinton No and I probably won't until you Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama return my stolen money and my stolen property.
