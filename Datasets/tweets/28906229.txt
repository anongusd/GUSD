Do you support electrocuting gay kids? Cuz we can throw your ass in the trash with Pence. https://t.co/mRIE3Uw9e2
Just so we’re clear...“Money,” was how she chose to clarify a policy that is clearly undefined atm. Maybe she thought she was being concise. Instead she was being obtuse. https://t.co/NHxm5XKq2g
Bernie has dealt with more police brutality than this Black guy. And I know anecdotes are not proof of anything. I’m just saying, his experiences and policies are definitely informed by standing with our predecessors. https://t.co/W1WPAZHAot
Except Bernie supports Rep. Clyburn’s legislation which would target federal resources to those most in need. Add a component to the language that says priority for all new federal programs goes to #ADOS. Boom. Done. Thank u, next. https://t.co/VuaePBX8cS
I love @GanacheSilky! Goodnight 😘 😴

This is about being poor and clever. I’m sure plenty of conservatives are living in their dead parents’ rent controlled apartments. Finding a place to live in NY is next to impossible unless you’re rich. Add grief from losing a loved one to the mix, and I’m happy AOC had a haven https://t.co/ah66TLsNnT
Motion to shelve the #reparations debate until the #Democrats are no allowed to hijack and weaponize it. Basically, til niggas are ACTUALLY ready to be specific and not just should things into the air 🤷🏾‍♂️
“Money” 🤦🏾‍♂️		How much? Who gets it? How long will it be paid out? Is reparations just money? You know, Black people still lack access to critical resources to start businesses? Our communities still lack adequate healthcare. We are still grossly underpaid for our labor. https://t.co/LINAhOze0e
That’s pandering. And a racist stereotype, to boot. https://t.co/9Xdsr077w1
Please. If you think NYers give a flying fuck about her doing whatever the hell is necessary to keep an apartment in this place, you’re out of your mind. https://t.co/f8LeKtR31M

“Let’s play small ball! How does a 50 year climate plan sound? Also, you just have to trust us...We’re working on “Affordable” (private) insurance and taking your yearly prescription bill down from the cost of building a new house to the cost of buying one off market
The fact that so many Black people look out at the political and economic landscape and conclude, “Oh yeah, we’ve achieved so much for Black people. We don’t need an aggressively redistributionist economic policy to address racial disparities within historic income inequality.
But sure, so much has been done for Black folks. Especially by the Amazing Democratic Party. The party that housed the KKK until the 30s. Not even 100 years ago 🤦🏾‍♂️
Black activists are STILL fighting unjust policing, disparate sentencing, fighting for social services, fighting to find public schools. Same battles over-and-over for at least 30 years.
Black Democrats are so self-righteous. Playing gatekeepers in the primary, and patting themselves on the back for Obama (barely effective, cuz he loved Republicans who hated him) and Hillary (ummmm...we all know her deal). Meanwhile, almost NO progress has been made for Blacks
He’s only losing stubborn old Black people, who are accustomed to getting two rusty nickels in exchange for their votes. Y’all have saddled us with gov debt, student loan debt, and a planet that’s gonna burn. And what progress has the black community seen in my 30 years? https://t.co/OdC6f7NtUM

Running up the popular vote in Cali and NY is completely meaningless in the electoral college.
Bernie went soft, but y’all wanna pretend he ran some scorched earth campaign. “But her emails” is y’all favorite refrain. He intentionally didn’t go after the emails. Yall r just apoplectic at her loss. Which was her responsibility. Knock on more doors (in Ohio and Wisconsin) https://t.co/55KIJoIfRE
Most of Trump’s voters dnt particularly believe his racist rhetoric, as much as they ignored or excused it to their econ. benefit. Or so they thought. Most Trump voters are just ignorant. But Dems dnt even speak to them. Just call them deplorable &amp; then lose elections to them. https://t.co/H1aFLRYhGA
Or you can campaign the Sherrod Brown way. He wins the same voters 🙄. I’m sick of y’all slandering every Trump voter as racist and sexist. It’s not only a disingenuous cop out. It’s gonna lead to 4 more years of Trump. https://t.co/H1aFLRYhGA

Come off it. I’m talking about his floor speeches while this issue was being debated. Has nothing to do with Hillary, but reality. He was speaking out against militarizing police, disparate senticing of crack, and racist policing. Period. Change my black ass mind 🤗 https://t.co/lfduLYAfce
United States of America: *Elects a racist Birther as president, who announced his campaign by calling Mexican rapists and murderers.”	 	2020 Democrats: 🗣 “Sounds like a perfect time to debate reparations!!!”		People who actually want reparations (and no more Trump): 🙄😩😭
And the way Black Democrats completely erase the POC and women who support Bernie is completely expected, but still disappointing. I guess blackness only matters if you use it as a shield for a political party. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/FNruuHdb20
If u watch any vid of him speaking on this debate, he was not only prescient, but speaking out more forcefully than Black activists at the time. It’s kinda how Democrats just forced Democrats to choose between immigrants and gun control legislation. They love a POC scapegoat https://t.co/s4SdIbmB5c
If it said Sanders, you would hate everything about it, from the socialist Blue, to the tax return font. 😭 https://t.co/lBhNQLliig

This was a stupid question &amp; u pink hat wannabes r highlighting the most flippant part of his answer. 1) he doesn’t want her advice 2) he doesn’t expect her to call. It was clearly in jest. 3) Nobody says a word when Hillary attacks Bernie. https://t.co/K9AIL1Kh95
Bernie Sanders can’t let go of 2016? I think it’s Democrats and Hillary die-hards who can’t get over it. Excuse me...🗣REFUSE to get over it. https://t.co/Tk2seDCM1R
Unless Hillary’s advice is, “please campaign harder than I did in the Midwest,” I think she should probably save it. https://t.co/4nOiYxXIRa

Whew chillay 😅🤣 https://t.co/ZaMnoYPa7F
There’s silence when u say Biden added the VAWA as a poison pill. Or that Bernie was 1 of the few ppl calling out the racist side effects— or intended consequences— we see today. Ppl hate Bernie 4 what he hasn’t done in Congress, but wanted him to scuttle more legislation 🙄🤔🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/DlextuVzmh
Cuz at a time when the American pol were demanding less drugs and more cops— even in Black communities— he was proud to to have listened. But he stood squarely against the unjust sentencing of rock and powder cocaine, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs targeting Blacks https://t.co/X0xFITDJJI
And if he had voted against the VAWA, you all would be apoplectic. He has stood against policy brutality and discriminatory criminal justice for longer than you’ve been alive. https://t.co/enyOElpZKi

👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/tcuEmXrkc6
As he pointed out, all three candidates are saying the same thing and he pointed to specific policy. This issue will get much better service in an actual debate, not when all the candidates are redefining the word in a void. https://t.co/tg4qk3WYTS
Hillary campaigned for the presidency for 30 years 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣 https://t.co/AGjdNZjfVB
What can be said about all of them is that they don’t respect the constitution or honor the office Trump holds, as he disgraces both everyday. https://t.co/n89YAdm0gX
And he also said that some of them are clearly racists and sexists. Calling every single Trump supporter a racist or sexist is extreme and unnecessary. https://t.co/n89YAdm0gX
Last night @BernieSanders made the mistake of pointing out that y’all #Democrat heroes don’t actually support any specific reparations legislation. In fact, Sen. Harris’ version of reparations is a tax credit for everyone who’s eligible?! 🤔🤭🤣 #Bernie2020 #ADOS
My argument is literally that it makes him less appealing. He’s either pandering or racist. 2016 already baked the cake for many of these people. Bernie is “anti-Black.” He’s “never” done “anything” for Black people. Putting icing on that cake won’t make Black people eat it. https://t.co/v7dp4Sm8HU
Not a big deal. My worry is that is just doesn’t matter. Most of the ppl searching for a better answer from Bernie think it will help him with Black voters. Black ppl will only support him once he gets the blessing of a gatekeeper (Obama or Clyburn) or when he wins the nomination https://t.co/robl3F4xMs
If #ADOS is serious, they know that only one candidate supports anything that looks like reparations. And it will be a much easier case to make once he’s actually debating his opponents. The town hall format is like shouting into a void. https://t.co/e7m53BLAqm
Anyone who listened to his full answer on reparations should come away with a clear understanding that he will address the racial disparities that exist within income inequality. He gave specific ills of Black mothers, Black kids, and Black business owners 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/TvfY9hqYyc
I’m against the semantics. Bernie supports legislation by Clyburn that targets federal resources to Black people. If others want to write actually bills, let them. But so far, Bernie is the only one making an actual policy case. https://t.co/TvfY9hqYyc
It wouldn’t be a slam dunk. The establishment would just move the goal posts, yet again. He will never give a satisfactory answer on race to some folks. So he needs to not play their game. https://t.co/1NMIWzH98j
Did Barack Obama have to shuck and jive like that?! No. It’s ridiculous to expect a 70-year old white man to sound that pitch perfect on race. He said what he said, and it means more than any other candidate atm because he backed it up with specific policy. Thank u, next. https://t.co/dndYO1nKZa
3/ You are actually an obstacle to advancement on the issue, when Bernie Sanders stood on that stage and unequivocally backed @WhipClyburn’s effort to send federal resources to communities who have been historically discriminated against, and you try to call that a paltry effort
2/ And then you hold up a Bernie support to your legion of followers looking for the word “reparations” as opposed to specific, targeted policies— unlike Sen. Harris’s tax credit for anybody and Warren/Castro with their rhetoric.
1/ But deserve to be insulted and dismissed 😬🤷🏾‍♂️ You clearly have no critical thinking skills if your takeaway was that Bernie doesn’t supported targeted reforms to address racial disparities in the economy. https://t.co/Aa76JocHeP
Except Bernie clearly pointed out how Warren’s rhetoric is no different than his. And he backed Clyburn’s proposal. Harris is talking what, exactly? A tax credit for everybody? You don’t even mention Marianne Williamson. You niggas are like cellophane. 🤦🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/YmAegoSXDt
And neither is the status quo. We are not the most educated or innovative. We certainly aren’t the healthiest. We just make a lot of money working our fingers to the bone to never see any return, unless we learn how to play the same game. https://t.co/sMP2paTYPp
That’s why the system Bernie is proposing empowers people to give back into America. If we remain poor and uneducated—and on a path to destroying our planet— we don’t have much to look forward to anyway. https://t.co/4fS08hXLuW
Most will never see 99% of the taxes Bernie is proposing. Are you a corporation? Do you earn $10,000,000 a year? Do you earn $500,000 a year? Do you own a wealthy estate? Do you stash money offshore? Earn income on capital gains? https://t.co/UYbYFckJ3P
He literally has an explanation for how to pay for every part of his platform. Closing tax loopholes that allow storing profits offshore, taxing corporations, taxing extremely high incomes, payrolls taxes. The money is there. It’s a matter of who has the political will to fight. https://t.co/5sy3p2mrJK
And yet more Hillary supporters voted for McCain. Cuz they are racists. 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/2RMFYPjZB7
No. He started by rejecting the lies. Then he backed Rep. Clyburn. Then he pointed out that what he said is exactly what Warren has said. But whatever. https://t.co/J6BW5oUyNK
Totally agree. Far more detailed and impassioned than I have seen from any candidate. https://t.co/lZY7BFQbih
It’s amazing to me that @BernieSanders is being criticized on reparations after backing specific policy written by @WhipClyburn 🙄 #SandersTownHall #Berie2020
He started his answer by backing specific policy 🙄🤦🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/2l4QvTR2Pr
There are Black people who balk at reparations, too, you know? I’m not one of them. I’m just saying...it’s not only Trumpers https://t.co/Gfd2yg4haQ
He asked for details because, as he pointed out, backing Rep. Clyburn’s specific legislation is far more than the lip service from @ewarren https://t.co/cUBJlH0cJT
@CNN The responses to this out of context quote are sad. This was a gotcha question that received an impressively nuanced answer. A question— I might add— that was never asked of our Black President.
If you took his answer in context, he was speaking to institutional racism. And don’t we want a government that at least takes on that challenge? https://t.co/WrUAB0SrSa
Also, private businesses and free markets. So capitalism? https://t.co/nrbpQcUrat
@BernieSanders was genius to back specific policy (written by a Black lawmaker), while also highlighting that that was just as much “reparations” as what @ewarren said. #SandersTownHall
I’m sorry. I missed which questions he didn’t have solid answers for. Please. Go on and tell me I wasn’t placated on racial issues 🙄 #SandersTownHall https://t.co/eP9ZogIiud

Perhaps he needed to run for President 20 years ago for his ideas to become popular enough for mainstream Democrats to take up the mantle. But while he was “doing nothing” as an Ind in Congress, the Democratic Party had a field day being moderate Republicans. 👀 The Clintons https://t.co/gQAjPA5LTs
Bernie Sanders has been voting WITH DEMOCRATS for longer than I’ve been alive. I’m 30 years old. His principles say much more than a party label. He has fundamental and UNDERSTANDABLE disagreements with the Democratic Party. But y’all love playing obtuse 🙄 https://t.co/gQAjPA5LTs
She will be attacked by “Democrats.” #Bernie2020 https://t.co/moK8yMbujP
I’m sick of the disingenuous Bernie attacks from the “only criticize republicans” camp, no less. That’s  why they have to do mental jiu jitsu to claim Bernie is Republican. Despite the fact that he’s been voting with Democrats for longer than most of these fools have been alive. https://t.co/GxSf35w67l
Because establishment Democrats decided to lump it with the VAWA. Imagine if Bernie voted down the crime bill with that gem in there. There would be a real reason to call him sexist. Lol. Also, find me proof Bernie supported the goals of the crime bill, outside of the VAWA. https://t.co/GxSf35w67l
He was virtually unknown running against Hillary Clinton. Oh, and he’s not Black. (👀 Obama). If y’all don’t get y’all act together (or drag Biden into the race) Bernie is gonna sweep the whole primary 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣 https://t.co/ehoegKe33X

But the tax cut was specifically sold as a benefit to the middle class. I already had a job. And people finding work that was already there before the tax cut is irrelevant. I want to see my benefits from the tax cut. https://t.co/qF7MEWbFdD
I mean, I wouldn’t mind @NICKIMINAJ and @iamcardib burying the hatchet for the culture, and attacking white nationalism through collaboration. Two female emcees taking hip-hop back to some of its political origins?! 🤔😎😎

Are you daft? There is a difference between someone publishing an article and someone conducting a study. The study was conducted by a reputable research university. You are picking a singular data point from the 2010 census. 😹😹 Bye, Stupid Preserves, I mean Conservative Jam 😅 https://t.co/jwQh6KwdTZ
Funny, this is very close to what Andrew Gillum said about DeSantis, and he was roundly praised for his response. https://t.co/VzZ43CB4fk
My evidence is also from the beginning of last year. You have 5 years estimates based on some data that is almost a decade old at this point. https://t.co/1N1hbAHwoj
I didn’t dismiss anything. I said your data was cherry-picked. I presented a far more comprehensive picture of what constitutes a poorly educated state, and then showed that California is not on the top 10 of that list. https://t.co/1N1hbAHwoj
Published this? Yes. The study was done by the georgetown center on education and the workforce. You know Georgetown? The private, highly esteemed research university? https://t.co/m8CGEJBdHy
https://t.co/syx0Xb4L4j this study uses averages from 25 different metrics. Not your cherry-picked data points. https://t.co/T05jxAcwOY

Trump has no idea what he’s doing. He’s a diversionary tactic. Mitch McConnell, a master institutionalist, is the bigger problem. He’s seated 2 assholes on the SC, blocked a Dem nom, &amp; reshaped the fed bench for a generation. All with that idiot in the WH. The GOP planned this https://t.co/I8L4f7I101
The GOP is fully in his pocket, because their electoral fortunes are tied to his popularity. They have no reason to stand up to him and defend America, because they still get to appoint judges and pass their laws. Trump doesn’t get an inch, and I’m glad Pelosi sees the long game https://t.co/RU3EvCN0Km
Democracy is not “bleeding out.” It is being systematically attacked by the GOP, and bending over while they carry out these attacks is the height of ridiculous. Nancy Pelosi is FINALLY putting a stop to this madness. Trump needs to be broken. Period. Full stop. 1/2 https://t.co/RU3EvCN0Km
Oh, you mean take a rational case to the general voter, in hopes that they’re engaged and knowledgeable on the system of checks and balances and how McConnell is MIA? 😅😅 Lemme say now, that won’t work. Hillary’s entire campaign was a rational case against this man 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/05NenSc9SN
On this one, I happen to think Pelosi is protecting and defending the Constitution, by breaking Trump’s will to subvert it. https://t.co/vj6twXJdid

Give Trump his wall with caveats. If #USMCA doesn’t eventually cover the costs of the wall, it triggers automatic tax increases to avoid the wall being a deficit expenditure. #TrumpsShutdown #FridayThoughts
Let’s see @realDonaldTrump put some money where his mouth is. #Pelosi can agree to $5.7B upfront, with provisions that it’s paid back through the trade deal OR automatic tax increases on top earners. #TrumpShutdown #USMCA
#trumpshutdown @SpeakerPelosi should push to ratify Trump’s trade deal. Add provisions that allocate any Treasury funds to the border wall, and in the absence of enough US Treasury funds to cover the wall, it triggers an automatic tax increase in top earners. #USMCA
Can @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer pass a bill that allocates any money from #USMCA to Trump’s border wall? Of course, the Treasury won’t see any money from that trade agreement, so he won’t take the deal. But it will expose this WH for the liars they are. #TrumpShutown
@SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer should move on to passing Trump’s trade deal and say, “when the billions start flowing in from the ‘trade deal formerly know as Prince,’ we will allocate that money for a wall.

And before you even start, this isn’t about party or politics. You literally aren’t using your brain.
A trade deal that hasn’t passed Congress, won’t take effect until 2020 when it does pass Congress, and IF it’s profitable— I’m sure you’ll be surprised to hear this one— the profits go to private businesses, not the government. Continue being a dumbass tho. https://t.co/Gc0YfsSv6S

They are hyper aware of their racial toxicity to the point that Republicans have to restrict access to registration and voting—expending massive political capital trying to block people from the country who they *fear* won’t vote for them.
Are Democrats screening immigrants at the border for their political leanings? Lol. The whole idea is so brazenly xenophobic. But it at least acknowledges the fact that Republicans know POC will never fuck with them on any significant level. https://t.co/KxV6zZF9o5
Why is everything political? When it comes to immigration, I’m a compassionate human being who believes America can and should be shared.  When it comes to the WALL, I’m a reasonable person who can look at the facts and see it’s a lot of money for little to no effect. https://t.co/Ry1EjZosFZ

More Berners voted for Hillary than Hillary voters for Obama in 08. Just so happens Obama didn’t NEED Hillary to win, because he already had the heart of the Dem party—black voters— on his side.

@NancyPelosi should go down as the greatest parliamentarian in the annals of the American Congress. I’m so excited to see how she beats @realDonaldTrump like a drum over the next two years. 😊🥰 https://t.co/DBKJYBy2OQ

@amandabynes is back, new and improved. Everyone is finally cancelling @lenadunham. #Democrats have control of the House. 🗣THE LION KING.... 2019 is bouta be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I believe the caucus is actually evenly split, but even the idea that the women outnumber the men is just 🥰🥰👌🏾 https://t.co/Insep7SkkF
Every time I look at or touch my phone, I hate @apple even more. I wish I didn’t have to communicate with the outside world for the next 3 days or I would just throw this shitty phone over the GWB and wait for my @google phone to come.
A $1,000 phone and the piece of crap needs insurance, armor, a full-time security guard, and don’t forget Apple care before you even dare to use it. Im bouta get this @Google pixel 2 and call it day 🙄🤷🏾‍♂️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
The bottom line is iPhones are for people who are already brainwashed to keep spending money. The fool at @AppleSupport literally told me I should have bought a case while I waited for my phone case I ordered. Like NIGGA...is @apple gonna pay me back?
And the very first person at @verizon or @AppleSupport to suggest I’m paying another dime for this piece of shit just might wish they’d never been born when I’m done with them.
And I swear if one more person tells me to “get a case!!” I ordered a custom case and my first iPhone broke before the order could even be fully processed. This shit is cheap and annoying. Idk why I ever came back to @apple. But I’m bouta smooth cancel this @verizon contract 🤷🏾‍♂️
@AppleSupport DMd me to set up call with an advisor. The advisor proceeds to tell me nothing can be done because I don’t have apple care. Lmao. Like wtf?! I know nothing can be done. That’s why I’m venting angrily on Twitter.
Man @AppleSupport just really pissed me off. As if the shitty iPhone MS Max breaking into a million pieces TWICE wasn’t enough, they reached out to me just to waste my time.
If I have one more drink, I’m going to lose it and throw this phone against a wall, and then stomp on the pieces. So I’m putting the beer down. And I’m also done looking at all of this cracked grass. I feel like I broke a mirror. 😩😭#badluck @AppleSupport
@AppleSupport now the replacement phone is broken. I’m sick to my stomach. I gotta continue to pay $1,000 for this shit. Or pay $200 for a new one. Or put a case on a phone that is physically destroyed to avoid injuring my hand. 😅😅🤦🏾‍♂️👊🏾👊🏾😭😭
@AppleSupport I spoke with my insurance after I dropped the first phone. Everybody said, “buy a case.” Ok. But what about the $1,000+ phone?! Why is it so fragile?! I didn’t even have time to get the custom case I wanted. It broke in less than a week! I’m so irritated. 😩🤦🏾‍♂️😩🤦🏾‍♂️
@AppleSupport I dropped my first phone in less than a week...ok fine. People drop phones. But the back glass was completely destroyed. To the point that it was cutting my hand.
@AppleSupport currently trapped in a nightmare with this new iPhone. Why it breaks so easily, I will never understand. But I’m on my second BROKEN one 🤦🏾‍♂️
@Miami_Babbyyy It gets funnier every time. Yo cousin should have never tried to plead her case 🤦🏾‍♂️😩😩. Aunty was almost through, then she got pissed all over again. 😆😆

@ZephyrTeachout should be clear. The first step to clean up corruption in Albany is to replace our corrupt governor. Write op-eds for every paper that has endorsed you, and let NYers know that Cuomo is not the way to go if we want to see progress in NY. #CynthiaforNY
@MrDane1982 SMH. The obsession with Bernie Sanders is ridiculous. You expect him to outshine Cory and Kamala? And then you'd attack him as racist for them being overshadowed.

@CynthiaNixon, a studied &amp; accomplished actress and activist of 20 years, would be a celebrity-turned-politician more in the vein of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan than Donald Trump. But nice try, folks.

The rationale is Cuomo has actively fundraised for dems who caucus with GOP to give them a majority, he ended an investigation into Harvey Weinstein for a $25k donation, and he's done nothing on criminal justice reform in 8 yrs. He just saw the light on marijuana a week ago. https://t.co/EoABtCt5hi
Go to an event and speak with her. She's far more convincing, based on her hiring a ton of black women to her campaign and her knowledge of the issues effecting black ppl, than Cuomo. He flat out said he was against reparations and has done nothing on crim justice in 8 yrs 🤔 https://t.co/zdq0HyfFAe

This comparison is mad lazy, given @CynthiaNixon has a nearly 20 year history of advocating specific policies on issues of public education and LGBTQ marriage. But if she is like Trump, let's argue how effective he's been at advancing some GOP policy positions. https://t.co/9EzDp9HPbG

And this fact will be overlooked and excused by the Hillary cult, who screamed full-fledged sexism simply because Barack and Bernie decided to run in a primary against her. But Cuomo gives a pass to Weinstein and we won't hear a peep from dem establishment (white) women. https://t.co/X84u2kGsLq

I was upset that Michigan failed to deliver for one of the most detail oriented and progressive candidates in history in Abdul El-Sayed. But Floridians handing Andrew Gillum the win is a nice consolation.

Dude, how have you not HACKED up a lung? NY is a political bulwark against Trump? Where was Cuomo during the damn election?!

Obama was a political disaster. How many Dem seats lost? And his policies were GOP-lite. From the wars, to the tax cuts, to the mandate to buy insurance and make those execs billionaires 3x over. He was, however, a missed symbol of gentility and intelligence. And a cool guy. https://t.co/nqE0Qwt9rz
She's actually been running more against Cuomo. As far as solutions: increase minimum wage (and all wages); universal healthcare, which saves NY billions; institute early voting; get rid of preferential rent; close Rikers; plenty more. She does have a website. Good place to start https://t.co/TloF1Yl4Yn
He embraced enough progressive ideas to keep from hemorrhaging democrat support. But his whole admin was spent flirting w/ republicans. It's sad how much he still gets defended by establishment Dems. He didn't even support gay marriage! He lost more dem seats than n e 1. https://t.co/7dkZsQSzbS
It's always easier to point the finger at a third party than it is to accept the failures of the Democrats to excite certain voters. Greens have a platform that many Dems actively fight against, including taxing the wealthy, Medicare 4 All, and a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/oJk3oFohmd

One of the main functions of ACA actually IS working as designed, and that's the mechanism that funnels working people into the money pit called exchanges. Expanding Medicaid? Marginal success.

Aca = more ppl paying their hard earned money to insurance companies so that those companies can make enormous profits while passing out expensive policies that cover mediocre medical care with bloated prices. ACA is a gimmick to turn poor people into dollar signs for insurers. https://t.co/Xp4zRAnfZK
You're not even sticking to the point. The point is dems believe in universal coverage. Or so they say.

Just like the establishment. Don't care about race until they can use it to attack progressives as racist. Don't care about corporate donations until their candidate is tainted by dark money.

Cuomo literally handed the state Senate to Republicans. So much for protecting new Yorkers from Trump. Lol https://t.co/0GB9YO2mvl
RT @ShaunKing: Moments ago @CynthiaNixon just released the most thorough, thoughtful, decisive plan on justice reform any candidate for gov…
STOP defending @andrewcuomo! He was OK with usurping the voice of black voters who elected DEMOCRATS, by allowing them to caucus with the GOP. Then the deal to end that racist setup effectively muzzled the black woman leading the state Senate. Blk ppl who support Cuomo are sick. https://t.co/iX8XgorRth
Black voters are loyal robots. Mostly uninformed or under informed about candidates, and they--particularly the people in my parents' generation and older-- don't demand anything but "experience" in exchange their vote. Which really just means, "have I heard your name before?" https://t.co/sMnUy1Fj6Z
Funny..her website is full of catchphrases and slogans. Extremely vague, at that. 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/RuL4qj0E42
LMAO. You sound pathetic. In a public campaign, what you say is the main indication as to how you would govern, particularly when you have no history in government. So, yes, I want to hear "I support universal coverage." And I'd love even more controlling how politicians VOTE! https://t.co/7MFDiddlhL
Which is why she could at least advocate a LIVING wage. And it's not about single payer. It's about universal coverage. Which she also fails to publicly support. https://t.co/1nFo2rMw1q
If socialists are making republicans self-destruct like this, democrats might wanna reconsider sidelining people them. @MeghanMcCain is screaming over facts, steaming mad, and lying through her teeth. Poor, sad girl 😂😂😂 https://t.co/Rbg4qZsJf3
I'm a registered democrat, voted for Hillary knowing she would lose, and I'm not a purist. But when there's a candidate who clearly and unequivocally advocates for what the party says it believes, that's my candidate. I'm not going to make excuses for dems afraid to be dems https://t.co/PEMSjwV6p0
Lol. Then vote for her! 😂 Cuomo shit on black voters. He not only endorsed democrats-elected by mostly black voters-running into the arms of the GOP, but the crappy deal to end that setup put a muzzle on the black woman who now leads the Senate. He doesn't respect black ppl. https://t.co/huE3idQH0h
Yeah...that was more like reading people for being intellectually disingenuous hypocrites than it was a lecture on identity politics. https://t.co/VSTJjiMKwc
I don't see any mention of universal coverage at all on her website, single payer aside. Why can't she openly support universal coverage? Or a living wage? What's stopping a democrat from supporting democratic principles? https://t.co/WMwBLQJXaW
@andrewcuomo OK'd giving a majority in the state Senate to the GOP. Across the state, black voters powered the election of Democrats to the Senate, and Cuomo completely ignored that, by allowing Dems to caucus with the GOP. Yet it's @CynthiaNixon having issues with black people. https://t.co/rFwaJvGE9c
Every time he smiles or cries. Feeding him a bottle or changing his diaper. When he's napping peacefully or waking me up from my sleep. On our weekly rides to church or his first trip to… https://t.co/dAsg9JHYi9
Who digs into Cuomo?! Nobody even donates to him but millionaires. The man was literally protecting democrats who voted republican and handed over the Senate majority. Right here in NY our DEMOCRAT Gov was selling us out...until @CynthiaNixon challenged him https://t.co/BMyaA5XwGt
She also believes in ending solitary confinement and keeping children under 18 out of criminal court. What would that do for Black men? And where is @andrewcuomo on this?! https://t.co/OXCtcQPxyu
@JamilahLemieux 		😨😓 https://t.co/mHshuRqfLJ
And minimum wage, and Super PAC money, and cap-and-trade. Her website is vague as hell. She can't make promises until she's done collecting massive checks. https://t.co/NSMxM4eDkI
Low info black voters blocking out what the democratic party claims to be their principles by protecting corporate candidates. https://t.co/A15XGned1y
Yeah...Screw what she wants to do--or NOT do-- for her would be constituents. Democrats love electing republicans. https://t.co/IxyoBHxNVE
It's like democratic voters refuse to reckon with the many inherent flaws of electing candidates who accept mysterious campaign money over highlighting the flaws of candidates who are new to the process. https://t.co/rw3GeNvJ1A
Blk women aren't stupid. But they do seem to be slowing popular progressive ideas from becoming law--by way of blocking novice far left candidates from winning primaries-- in favor of dems who win with corporate money &amp; then barely perform on already compromised promises. https://t.co/rw3GeNvJ1A
Also, there are many people in the democratic party who need to be reminded what the party stands for, and it's not centrism and corporatism in an effort to inoculate oneself from GOP attacks. Why don't ALL dems push a living wage?! It's sad. https://t.co/KBn1U8rmdJ
Bernie &amp; Alexandria are travelling to the Midwest to test their theory of progressive ideas winning elections, even in more conservative districts. If you haven't noticed, she's endorsed the most progressive candidates-- by her standards-- in NY, DE, MI, and MO. https://t.co/KBn1U8rmdJ
Really? As he campaigns with a Latinx who just beat an old, white man. He also endorsed a Muslim in Michigan and a black woman runs his organization. Stop the establishment games over identity politics. https://t.co/xxhFoS1yGo
Does Sharice support $15 minimum wage, investments in clean energy, universal healthcare, or getting rid of PAC money?! NO! She doesn't. At least not vocally. So she doesn't get the support of politicians who are pushing the democratic party to support these things. It's simple https://t.co/J5qnp9arpA

CEOs should be allowed to have preferred candidates and donate legal amounts of money to them. They shouldn't be allowed to funnel money into secretive campaign orgs or buy influence behind closed doors. *ahem ahem @gretchenwhitmer* https://t.co/JSnJKZ4mnw
And it was a transparent donation(s). Who's paying for Gretchen's TV ads? https://t.co/JSnJKZ4mnw
A corporate exec giving a legal, TRANSPARENT political donation is not a PAC financing a statewide ad buy for your campaign, a mysterious 527 raising money by the tens of thousands, or a lobbyist buying influence in closed door meetings. https://t.co/rOgvLUbfrK

Where are those receipts, actually? I wanna see just how much @gretchenwhitmer BCBS inheritance was beefed up after the ACA passed &amp; flooded health insurers with a new and consistent profit stream. Damn good reason to make sure 600,000+ have health insurance but no real health. https://t.co/0oLccruKqM
And not "universal healthcare?" 	Sad. https://t.co/eGi6as1LeW
What do you mean banned? I'm an Ohioan living in NYC, so maybe I missed something about MI campaign finance law. To my understanding, @AbdulElSayed ONLY collects small donations from real people; no PACs, no lobbyists https://t.co/j8l1Khac01
@ZephyrTeachout for NY Attorney General https://t.co/mVzVdxOYxi
...and health insurers made millions. How much of @gretchenwhitmer inheritance is tied up in BCBS making out like bandits off the health of Americans? https://t.co/0FgldWeW2B
She can't lead if she's bought and paid for by corporations just like any other republican; she can only follow what she's told. She doesn't support universal healthcare. That's not bravery. What are poor rape victims supposed to do for mental health services? https://t.co/GYRuBfpvpO
Ummmmm....she could accept small donations. From real people. Not Mitt Romney's version of "people" aka corporations. https://t.co/b02MnGPDQF
@FactProgressive @sjdemas @gretchenwhitmer @AbdulElSayed Precisely!!!! Why bring that up as if any other candidate has been assaulted, and is now cowering in a corner somewhere instead of defending other victims. It's a cheap, Dem establishment tactic
Physicians help patients. Blue cross execs help profits. But you know that already. https://t.co/SNVYsF8kNI
She could pick better policy. Instead she wants to protect what daddy helped build...a corporation profiting off American's health. https://t.co/uERnQb4b8i
What's sad is you using her testimony to juxtapose her against other candidates. She was the only one who was sexually assaulted. She's also the only one who doesn't universal healthcare. https://t.co/Ys7WWVffKd
@sjdemas @gretchenwhitmer Well...there's @AbdulElSayed, who believes in universal healthcare services for rape victims, including mental health services. And then, there's @gretchenwhitmer, whose daddy was a health insurer executive....so....values...
@JimOberstadt @gretchenwhitmer But as the daughter of a former Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO, @gretchenwhitmer doesn't believe in universal healthcare. So, thank God nobody was injured, because they'd be paying medical bills until Trump is outta office.

@realpaolathomas It sounds great in retrospect, but it certainly didn't win the election.

"We can achieve debatable, marginal success. Elect me!" Is hardly inspirational. https://t.co/eG3Hp415ZQ

I have been saying forever that #MTA needs to stop charging people until they fix the DAILY service issues.
If this was true I wouldn't haven been assaulted by one of your flight attendants. And I have yet to be contacted. https://t.co/CQK0Ot65qi
I'm sure the media will be interested in more @AmericanAir horror stories as they investigate allowing a woman to be sexually assaulted.
@AmericanAir is horrible. Masturbating men, violent/poorly trained flight attendants...and they have the nerve to be raising fares.
#saturdaymorning, a full week later, and I have to be contacted by @AmericanAir regarding being assaulted by 1 of their flight attendants.

Now I'm being threatened with security by YOUR flight attendants because I'm (naturally) upset. Not violent. Not menacing. Upset. https://t.co/iXs0nGzMFO
If a plane sits on a runway for 3 hours, did it not occur to any of the fine ppl at @AmericanAir that ppl would miss connections? https://t.co/tiPCxjUrIB
I see what you did there. It's NOT the weather. It's stupid ppl making decisions and awful customer service. But nice try. https://t.co/iXs0nGzMFO
Now I'm in another random airport being accosted by flight attendants b/c I got upset that yet ANOTHER @AmericanAir flight has been awful.
@AmericanAir doesn't give vouchers for weather, so after not rescheduling my flight &amp; making me miss my connection, I slept in an airport.
...and we sat on the runway for 3 hours. Just enough time for me to miss my connection. How did @AmericanAir respond?
Called @AmericanAir to get a flight that left sooner. Leave from JFK and get to Chicago. Board that flight..//
Let me replay the events. I had a flight canceled as I waited to board and @AmericanAir rebooked me for 2 entire days later.
This shit gets better and better. This woman called security on me. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir just had security called on me as I stood here tweeting because the flight attendant felt threatened by my anger.
Nobody knows a thing. Not the captain, not the flight attendant, not the ticketing agents. It's a goddamn farce @AmericanAir
They don't even have anyone you can speak to. Smh. @AmericanAir is a shitty excuse for a business. And an even worse airline.
I cannot wait to speak with someone from @AmericanAir customer service. CANNNOOOOOOT WAIT!!!
10 mins later: the whole plane has been unloaded and we're standing in the Allentown airport looking dumb. @AmericanAir
I'm still trying to get back to NYC. How do you fuck up a 2 hour direct flight?!?! Lying saying we're leaving in 10 minutes. @AmericanAir
The trip home? AWFUL! @AmericanAir
I am beyond sick of this damned @AmericanAir. They have singlehandedly ruined my vacation. RUINED IT!
There is no fucking reason I should be stuck in Allentown, PA @AmericanAir
Once again, I'm stuck in an airplane on a fucking runway as @AmericanAir's prisoner!!!!

Wanna help? Fire the AWFUL associate you have at Chicago O'Hare who called my mom a b*tch and threatened to fight me...a paying customer. https://t.co/6zT0X25qYr
Let me try to sleep (IN THIS AIRPORT) so when I call americanair in the morning, I don't start… https://t.co/JJsu4zPFFZ
I've called 1,000,000 times. Even spoke to one of your nice associates in Chicago who basically told me to fuck off. Who should I call? https://t.co/6zT0X25qYr
@AmericanAir doesn't accommodate their customers AT ALL. It's like "buy our $350 ticket and watch us screw you without grease."
The @AmericanAir employees were rude, uninterested, and literally laughed at me while they left to clock out for the night.
I tried to get help from the @AmericanAir employees at Chicago O'Hare. I might as well have just flown a plane myself.
I originally had 2.5 hours for my Chicago layover. Now, I'll be sitting in O'Hare overnight because I missed my connection. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir let a full plane of people sit on the runway for 3 hours. With a total of maybe 4 updates.
We sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit on this hot ass @AmericanAir plane. Total wait? 3 HOURS!!!
Get to JFK and wait for @AmericanAir to be better than before. I wait in vain. The plane boards on time. But this is where joy begins to die
I go back home to the Bronx. It's not too far from LGA. But Saturday's flight is out of JFK. AN👏🏾EXPENSIVE 👏🏾FUCKING👏🏾TREK!!!!
Putting your paying customers in a hotel room with a meal while they wait for you to show your ass again? Too much to ask, @AmericanAir?!
But that would be too much like right, now wouldn't it @AmericanAir? Billion dollar company, and making sure your customers aren't stranded?
So my flight was rescheduled for next day. Certainly @AmericanAir offered me complimentary boarding, maybe a food voucher. A discount?
After I had my mom call and knock around some heads, I had two different options for a Saturday flight. 🤔🙄 @AmericanAir
So @AmericanAir automatically rebooked me for the "soonest" flight. 2 days later, at 5 in the afternoon. Except that was a lie.
Like...how you do you carelessly fuck up somebody's travel plans and then assume you know how to reschedule them? @AmericanAir
But @AmericanAir, why make me waste my time calling your number when you've AUTOMATICALLY RESCHEDULED MY FLIGHT FOR TWO DAYS LATER?!?!??
Then @AmericanAir  sent out a parade of customer service ladies, eager to hand out  cards with a customer service NUMBER! #redundantornah
NOOOOOOT! @AmericanAir didn't make any announcement. They sent a shitty email and flashed it on the monitor at the gate.
Everyone is there, waiting to board, when a friendly @AmericanAir customer service rep delivers the news that the flight is off.
I think @AmericanAir sensed that I wouldn't make my connection flight, because a little while later,  and they canceled my first flight.
I sit and wait for the new boarding time. SURPRISE! @AmericanAir issues another delay. At this point, I'm in jeopardy of missing my layover.
@AmericanAir made no announcement about why the flight was delayed. I guess they assume everyone loves flight delays.
I checked into my @AmericanAir flight and sat down to wait for boarding. 5-10 mins before we are to board, the flight is delayed.
@AmericanAir can't control construction, but they're pretty solid at fucking up literally everything else.
I make the trek from my apt to LaGuardia yesterday. No biggie, except the airport is a construction madhouse. Not @AmericanAir's fault.
Gotta lil story about the greatness (see: utter disaster) that is @AmericanAir. Parents got me a flight home last week. Super cool, right?!
Just cancel the fucking flight and let people get on with their lives. @AmericanAir WILL be refunding this ticket.  #MarkMyWords
Who's idea was it to board a plane and then leave ppl sitting there for hours while @AmericanAir fucked around on https://t.co/BL5EOglx5W???
It might be better for @AmericanAir to just let me die on this shitty ads plane, because if we EVER make it off, I'm going ape shit
Somebody at @AmericanAir IS NOT SAFE!!! I've been trapped on this plane for THREE hours.

Black Journalism = Caping For Clinton
And here comes Hillary Clinton, waltzing into the election with proposals that are already bought and paid for by big campaign donors. Smh.
Bill Clinton is the big fairy tale, folks. The slightest glance at his policies proves that he's not what he's cracked up to be.
Almost every Bill Clinton policy was some vapid piece of triangulated nothingness. Unless it was extremely devastating.
We need to re-litigate Bill Clinton's presidency until we realize he was a huckster addicted to political horse trading. And fellatio.
All of these blk journalists trying to shoo Bill Clinton, as if Hillary isn't his protégé. They want to build another House of Cards.

The news is so depressing. To the point where I don't wanna know shit that's going on anymore.
What was that loud, gaudy parade of mediocrity?! #TheVoice
Celine is perfectly in tune and Ne-Yo is singing all around her in some nebulous key. Scratch his mic.
I'm still blocked by Rihanna. I just wanted to encourage her. Tessanne is coming for her.
Black ppl know how to do 3 things: play sports, fry chicken, and praise the Lord. Sometimes we do all 3 at the same time -_-
I'm still pissed about 10 black ppl walking onstage to "take em to church" tho. Like can we as a people progress past being gospel props?
That 808 better thump through her 8 second commercial. Hahaha.
"XO" is not going to click for you until you allow the Holy Spirit to use you while you listen to it.
@beyonce doesn't even believe in her "imperfection." I mean, she is aware she has a track titled "***flawless* on this very album. Right?
If this is @beyonce being "imperfect," I'll have a few more servings. Cuz....
"..I just wanna blow that shit up!"
A rising tide lifts all ships. @beyonce is CLEARLY the rising tide.
@beyonce is trolling with that black hair, too.
Grown Woman is yet MORE evidence of the amount of slayage Kelly can bring when she's in @beyonce's presence.

Get into the dude looking like, "@beyonce, what are you doing our of your castle?!" during Jealous.
"red wine drip drip, talk dat trash. Chauffeur eavesdroppin' try not to crash" Lol.
Real talk, I wanted @beyonce to let have over that blow dryer. Listen...when your Queen is in need... #BowDown
@beyonce made sure to give y'all a VERY tentative, cautious, unedited vocal in "Pretty Hurts" and it still slays entire discographies.
Who's sleeping on the lyrical, visual, and musical connections between 4 and BEYONCÉ?
RT @davidaxelrod: So vitamins are bad for you.  Disinfectant  soap is bad for you.  Could it turn out that ice cream is good???
The fact that @beyonce took her white fans for a ride and them dropped em off in the middle of Houston's 3rd ward without any protection &gt;&gt;&gt;
I wonder how many white girls clutched their purses just from watching the "No Angel" video. Lol. Oh @beyonce. Smh...

@beyonce should hire Skeleton Crew. A woman employing middle-aged male irrelevance: that's feminism.
@beyonce you killed that Aaron Neville impression on "seeeeeeee...xy" #Rocket
Can we elect @beyonce to Congress? She has the fucking answers.
I always knew the greatness of #Rocket, but I just had the ONE listen. Y'all know the one. I hate @beyonce.
All 828,773 of these people are patiently waiting for a hard copy of #BEYONCÉ. That's the real ki.
I feel like this is what @beyonce wanted for the last era. That's why she was pissed when it leaked.

@beyonce can u stop being so damn great so I can sleep? It's been 3 days now, Queen. #LetUp
I'm in the bed, lights muh fukkin off, eyes all the way closed and all I can think is "@beyonce got bars."
@AaronCann I didn't even notice. I'm sorry :-( hahaha
@beyonce released a "visual album" without a real visual on the cover. lol.
Then the bitch goes straight to church at the end. She slays me at the beginning of the song, then checks to see if I'm breathing at the end
@beyonce slays me when she exhales before answering the question abt her aspirations. She wanted to be like, "where do I start?"
@beyonce really inspires me. I'm bouta walk up on a white girl, drop a napkin, and just wait. #Beyonce
RT @MonicaBrown: Yessssss love Drunk in Love !!! ❤️ RT @THEmale_madonna: Fav have you heard that new Bey @MonicaBrown #AskMo
@Empress_HER BLUUUUUUE!!!! Bey's voice is like tiny cherubims salting the earth with blessings on that track.
@ItsMe___Breee *see last tweet* LMAO! Idk how I forgot to @ you.
I had 3 different ppl calling me. I was sleep. Tucked in safe and sound. Now I haven't slept in 3 days. Or eaten. Lol.
Somebody ask Monica if she boppin off that new #BEYONCE
@beyonce can make you feel like Jenna Jameson and Princess Diana during the same damn song. #ClassyFreak

RT @duhNasia: Dawg, I aint seen some of yall on my TL since like 2011. Where the fuck yall come from? Lol. Lawddd that Beyonce.
@beyonce stans need a legit support group. You can't just go to any ole body with your Bey related troubles.
I believe that harmonies are colors. Lol.
They're like a painting.
The vocals on "Blue" &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I hope y'all ready for the Destiny's Child album that's coming.
@beyonce's lil run in the 2nd verse of "XO" just made me throw my remote. And I've listened to it 1,000,000 times. It just slays like that.
RT @igorvolsky: Conservatives have dramatically lowered the bar for governing. #nerdland
The 2nd time @beyonce says "we should get married." Ugh....it's the smallest things. She's perfect.
@iKGSmooth It's perfect!!!! She's giving life, death, and resurrection. It's in non-stop rotation. Haha.
RT @iKGSmooth: @Your_Vokal_News I know you're getting all 23 years of your life of that BEYONCÉ release lol
Why Beyoncé shit on girls really named Peaches though? #Rude
"Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor." The fact that this phrase is repeated for nearly a full minute. I just can't.
"I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring" @beyonce preached.
RT @Politics_PR: Warning To 49 States: George Zimmerman Leaving Florida http://t.co/jGKPEHyDq3
"Slap me-- I'm pinned in the doorway." I love Jay and all, but he better keep his damn hands to himself.
@ItsMe___Breee hahaha. "whet?" I just died. Blow made me feel dirty. To think songs like Kitty Kat used to make me cringe a lil bit. Haha
Are you happy with yourself? Idk anymore, @beyonce. Damn....
I'm gonna pray for another installment of this greatness. You have some tracks that didn't make it this time, right? @beyonce
I've never eaten fried chicken w/ headphones in. Then #beyonce happened. I'm gonna play this @ every meal until I die. Thanks @beyonce.
