@SenCortezMasto @lisamurkowski Thank you both! I'm so thankful for your help and continued advocacy for Native women. #SavannasAct #NotInvisible
Proud &amp; encouraged that my friends @lisamurkowski &amp; @SenCortezMasto reintroduced my bill, #SavannasAct, to help address the crisis of missing &amp; murdered Native American women.

As I shared with @HallieJackson this morning, we need to let the steam out of this shutdown pressure cooker.

We need to stand up and fight injustice to make real change — that’s what I’ve been working to do to stop the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. And I know we can soon get #SavannasAct across the finish line &amp; help make sure these women are no longer #NotInvisible.
I’m so proud @lisamurkowski will reintroduce my bill, #SavannasAct, in the new year. We have worked closely together to support tribal communities. I know she and many others in the new Congress will continue to carry on this important mantle &amp; I’ll cont. to be a vocal advocate. https://t.co/8qEvb0nxag
@zeigler4presid1 Clearly, you made the nice list! 🎅🎅🎅
@Ethan_Haynes02 Thank you, Ethan!
House Republicans have a chance to do something important and needed by passing my bill #SavannasAct to help address the crisis of missing &amp;  murdered Native women.

While tonight’s result wasn’t the outcome we desired, I still have so much hope for our future. But I also know that for us to succeed, we can and must return to a politics that reflects the goodness of our country and the goodness of North Dakota.
I’d like to thank my family and the thousands of NDans whose prayers and encouragement has kept me going every single day. Serving ND in the Senate has been the highest honor of my life — because every day when I wake up, I’m thinking about how I can fight for rural America.
If you’re in line to vote tonight when the polls close, STAY IN LINE. You have the right to vote!
Over the course of this campaign, we’ve had more than 4,000 volunteers make 1.6m calls and knock doors almost 500,000 times — and our grassroots field operation is still working hard as we speak. But we need your vote to win. Find your polling place: text VOTEHEIDI to 738674
In the Senate, I’ve been a proud advocate for women &amp; families in Indian Country — the 1st bill I introed &amp; passed established the Comm. on Native Children and I haven’t let up since. There’s still so much more to do — that’s why I’m asking for your vote.		https://t.co/63n1615ngI

Last week, I voted — now it’s your turn! Because of your support, I know we can pull off this win tonight.

Love to be back in Belcourt rallying with our supporters today! In 2012, this race came down to less than 3,000 votes. Every single vote counts — don’t let anybody tell you otherwise! https://t.co/Bfzv4y0qDY
North Dakotans are strong, independent and fight for what’s right. That’s how we bring up our children, too. This election is about fighting for them — for civility, for an end to this crushing debt, for affordable health care. Our children are watching what happens on Tuesday. https://t.co/oi7BWBVNH2
Big families learn to divide and conquer — my wonderful family is knocking doors and shaking hands all over eastern ND. Growing up in Mantador, we learned that family matters more than anything — having them behind me on this #BringitHomeHeidi tour means the world. https://t.co/SVYTNEXN5v
I’m proud to have helped bring millions of dollars home to the Souris Valley to improve flood protection. I’ve always been proud to have Minot’s back — let's get out and vote! https://t.co/UTgM0nt5Cs
It’s the FINAL day to submit your vote-by-mail ballot. Make sure to have it postmarked before your local post office closes! Let’s make sure every vote counts!
We work hard in ND — our workers deserve a secure retirement. But @kevincramer has pledged to put retirement programs on the chopping block — I’ll never allow that. Thanks to all who came to the Bismarck Labor Temple for our breakfast rally this morning. https://t.co/PQXvvTsi6O
I’ve always been an independent voice — take it from my friend Sen. Kent Conrad (who recorded this on the #BringItHomeHeidi bus). When the Clinton administration imposed an EPA rule that would have unfairly hurt North Dakota, I took them to court — and won. https://t.co/i1JMOgrjEy
Tonight we held an amazing rally in Richland County — where I grew up! This has been such an amazing day traveling from Devils Lake down to Wahpeton, seeing friends and neighbors and getting fired up to win this thing. Thank you for coming out! https://t.co/UWFHiLtqDd
The #BringItHomeHeidi bus stopped in Mayville and Hillsboro this afternoon so I could go door to door asking for folks’ votes. But there’s not enough of me to knock every door in North Dakota — that’s where you come in! Sign up to knock doors: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/wi68shvATz
.@kevincramer voted 5x to overturn the health care law w/o a replacement. I’m proud to support:	✅Protections for NDans w/ pre-existing conditions	✅The ban on lifetime insurance caps	✅Children being able to stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26
Farm communities like Larimore are critical to the fabric of our state, and I’ve been proud to support them over the last six years by working on two strong Farm Bills. Thanks to all the folks who joined me for lunch at Larson’s Drive Inn! https://t.co/jEYII1XbWp
Growing up in Mantador made me who I am today. It’s where I learned the value of hard work, when to stick to my guns and when to find common ground. In every small town we’ve been in on the #BringItHomeHeidi tour, I see Mantador.		https://t.co/Sno3a4ayDO
Great to see everyone on Spirit Lake! I’ve fought on the side of Indian Country my entire life. In 2013, when we were working to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, I insisted on the inclusion of a provision to better protect Native women. @kevincramer opposed it. https://t.co/kIxImwZF9H
This morning in Devils Lake, I was honored to be presented with two commemorative coins by Jack Volk for my work fighting for veterans. Opening a vet center in Grand Forks and reforming the Veterans Choice Program is the least we could do to thank them. https://t.co/CadAqUKGvE
Good morning! Only two days until the election, do you know where your polling place is? I’m back in Devils Lake for a breakfast rally talking about the importance of voting. Look up your polling place &amp; make a plan to vote at https://t.co/pgtFMSPnO6 https://t.co/bHXhkiB8Pc
We’re more than halfway through our #BringItHomeHeidi tour! We’re going to win this race and I become more confident of that with every mile. Can you sign up to volunteer in these critical, final 72 hours: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/kT8q3WUWuU
Before I got to the Senate, Native women weren’t always protected when crimes were committed on tribal lands. I fought to keep Native women safe in the renewed VAWA. That’s one of the successes I discussed in Belcourt this evening. https://t.co/9J49cRfeIY
Today is the third day of our #BringItHomeHeidi statewide tour and I’ve had so much fun visiting with North Dakotans all over our great state. I’d love to see you when I come through your town!		https://t.co/0d7GAW9wx5
Rugby is at the center of North America, and I’m in the center of the Senate. By building relationships on both sides of the aisle, I’ve been able to get real results for ND — ending the oil export ban, helping shut down human trafficking sites, &amp; passing a strong Farm Bill. https://t.co/HgiRT12dDB
Just ran into my cousin Lorna in a parking lot in Rugby. The #BringItHomeHeidi tour has a tight schedule but… there’s always time to argue about who was the bigger troublemaker growing up — I’m convinced it was her. https://t.co/RWwmdBTdL7
This campaign is powered by folks like you. Getting to see so many friends and supporters from all over North Dakota on our #BringItHomeHeidi tour this week has been so incredible! https://t.co/fBdLsaaBcf
The bus got hungry for lunch, so we pulled over to pick up food, and I was nominated to grab it. What can I say? Everyone has to do their part on the #BringItHomeHeidi tour. Thanks to everyone at Cash Wise in Stanley for the stellar service and excellent food! https://t.co/fIgtfrBvPZ

No matter how @kevincramer tries to spin it, he won’t protect health care coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions. He voted 5 times to completely eliminate those protections without a replacement plan.		https://t.co/mnCY9yFqcX
Today is Kent Conrad’s last day on the bus. Kent taught me the importance of a balanced budget. He was always a deficit hawk in the Senate — and helped balance the budget when he was there. I, too, know we can’t keep borrowing from future generations.		https://t.co/Auw1yBWWro
This morning I launched a canvass in Williston — the heart and center of North Dakota’s incredible oil boom. One of my proudest achievements in the Senate was leading the charge to lift the 40-year old oil export ban to open markets for North Dakota oil. https://t.co/uSnfqws533
The second day of the #BringItHomeHeidi tour was great! We had packed crowds at our rallies in Mandan, Fort Yates and Dickinson. The momentum is on our side! https://t.co/KYGI9Y8w3j
We wrapped the 2nd day of our #BringItHomeHeidi tour up in Dickinson, where the airport creates jobs &amp; revenue. So when the president proposed cutting funding it relies on, I sprung into action and successfully advocated to stop it. https://t.co/L2zL2Tl0UF
Stopped in Killdeer for some yummy brownies! It's where Denise lives. She has heart disease &amp; is concerned about @kevincramer’s health care agenda. He voted 5x to completely repeal w/o a replacement the health care law &amp; eliminate coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/SIWVEjq5uh
Honored to have the endorsement of @hprfm! While my opponent has pledged to be a rubber stamp for his political party, I’ll always be an independent voice for ND. “Pre-existing conditions are a key focal point this election cycle. She’s right; he’s wrong."
We’re right near Dakota Gasification’s Great Plains Synfuels Plant. I spent more than a decade as a director at DGC, so trust me when I tell you that plant is truly a miracle on the prairie! So nice to see everyone in Hazen! https://t.co/zmBC3QfOiR
We’re making a couple stops in Coal Country, starting in Stanton where Joan was nice enough to host us in her home. I’m a proud supporter of our all-of-the-above energy economy &amp; passed a bill to support ND coal jobs. https://t.co/4zmTTYKub0
Growing up in Mantador, I never thought I’d become a Senator. But because of my upbringing, I take those small-town values to the Senate every single day. I’ll always fight for rural America. #FBF https://t.co/g1zfRt3tmL
My 1st bill established the Commission on Native Children. Still, there’s so much left to do to ensure Native American youth have a fighting chance to succeed. That’s part of what I spoke about this afternoon in Fort Yates with our @StandingRockST supporters. Thanks, everyone! https://t.co/gWaTXWrM2l
Had a great breakfast rally in Mandan this morning with some friends and neighbors. I’m excited to have Kent Conrad and (surprise!) @CoryBooker on the bus with us today as we head to rallies in Fort Yates and Dickinson. https://t.co/nnWVBS3sGe
I love having Kent Conrad on the bus with me to help kick off our Bring It Home, Heidi tour. In addition to being the previous holder of one of North Dakota’s Senate seats, Kent’s a good friend and has long been a mentor to me. https://t.co/mhoLS460lu
Anybody who represents North Dakota should understand agriculture. And if @kevincramer doesn’t have the backbone to stand up for North Dakota farmers and ranchers, then he doesn’t belong on the job.		https://t.co/G6CxKWOJDb
The first day of the Bring it Home, Heidi tour was quite the day! Thanks to @joebiden, Rep. Earl Pomeroy and Sen. Kent Conrad for joining me today. I want nothing more than to keep up the fight for North Dakota, but I need your help. Let’s #BringItHomeHeidi! https://t.co/gqVB1abAkf
Incredible crowd in Jamestown tonight! The excitement I’m seeing on the ground here is huge. I can feel the momentum leading us to another great victory. We’re going to win this — together! https://t.co/uZtSqGviWt
Every day on this campaign, I'm motivated by the North Dakotans I meet — farmers who've fallen on tough times, seniors who depend on Medicare &amp; children who deserve nothing less than a bright future. They need a champion in the Senate — let's win: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/BTBHTtYQJh
We’re bound for the home of the World’s Largest Buffalo — Jamestown! Come out and see us at the Jamestown Civic Center at 6pm. #BringItHomeHeidi
Stopped by our field office in Valley City this afternoon — all across the state, our volunteers and organizers are working around the clock, making calls and knocking doors to make sure we win on Nov. 6th. Sign up to join them: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/xXp7e1y1Me
Thank you Fargo! Just got on the bus to start our #BringItHomeHeidi tour — our next rally will be in Valley City at 3:45pm in our field office at 200 Central Ave N. Plus, I’ve got former Rep. Earl Pomeroy and Sen. Kent Conrad along for the ride today. Hope to see you there!
Today in Fargo, we’re launching our statewide #BringItHomeHeidi tour with Vice President @JoeBiden! I’m fighting to defend our health care, to end to this trade war and to ensure the dignity of a secure retirement. Follow along: https://t.co/peff8vWGzW https://t.co/ZC2rRemat2
Over the next 5 days I’ll be traveling across ND, making stops in towns large &amp; small. I’ll be meeting with NDans at coffee shops, gas stations and restaurants to discuss how I’m working to protect our health care, to end this trade war, &amp; to preserve Medicare &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/RCQLcnMStA
It’s been more than 130 days without a soybean order from the Pacific Northwest. And, with harvest in, our farmers have nobody to buy their beans. This trade war is devastating and NDans could lose their farms, but @kevincramer won’t stand with ND. https://t.co/mMPlHy4SXQ
Happy Halloween! I always have fun giving candy out to trick-or-treaters at my house. Especially loved meeting Hermione and Hedwig from Harry Potter and a unicorn! https://t.co/SI900JPwph
Thanks to all the @NDUnited members who came out to celebrate Halloween with me this evening! Personally, I’m spooked by the idea of North Dakota having a senator who doesn’t fight for our public employees, educators and students. https://t.co/YvEzMnkEjj
Sen. Byron Dorgan spent 30 years serving ND in Congress, so he knows a whopper when he sees one. Kevin Cramer voted 5 times to completely eliminate protections for North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. That’s a record he can’t rewrite.		https://t.co/ViO2Jg3H0e
In 2012, I won by less than 3,000 votes. We know this year will be just as close, &amp; I’m confident we’ll pull out a win. But I’m going to need your help to rally North Dakotans &amp; get out the vote. Step up right now to join my team for the final stretch! 		https://t.co/ADh9RIsAjA
I talk to NDans all the time who are worried about providing health care for their kids. @kevincramer repeatedly voted to repeal the health care law that protects folks from lifetime caps and being charged extra because they have a pre-existing condition. Those aren’t our values. https://t.co/8FaIwNmawh
I voted today! I can’t wait to head back to the Senate to continue defending North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions, standing up for farmers by pushing back against this trade war and protecting Medicare and Social Security. You can vote early too: https://t.co/7KqR4vDBgR https://t.co/jhsuZSecnA
Our #BringItHomeHeidi bus is getting the finishing touches put on it and we’re almost ready for our big tour. I’m so excited to welcome VP @JoeBiden to Fargo tomorrow for our kickoff rally! Hope you’ll join us and check out the rest of my trip at https://t.co/peff8vWGzW https://t.co/sNdk5e3XkX
It’s voting time! That’s why we just held an early vote rally in Grand Forks and stopped by the Joy of Voting. In 2012, we won this race by less than 3,000 votes. That means every single vote counts. I feel the momentum — we can win this race! Thanks for coming out! https://t.co/lCyegc3VA0
Jennifer, thank you so much for sharing your family's story. I'm so proud to fight for you in the Senate. https://t.co/eEwmvNjdZA
I love watching my daughter live her full and happy life. I can’t wait to watch her graduate from high school next year and pursue her dreams. That’s why I’m voting for Heidi — the health care protections that she defended make Allison’s dreams possible. https://t.co/2J47mXDOcv
Last year, I asked Kevin Cramer about his health care votes and he wouldn’t answer my question. He couldn’t answer because his record on health care is indefensible — it’s bad for my daughter and bad for North Dakota. https://t.co/bR3Flyd7DZ
Kevin Cramer called his health care votes “symbolic.” That’s just reckless — not to mention how offensive it is to children like Allison who struggle to get by and need access to health care to stay alive.
But Kevin Cramer’s 65 votes to repeal or undermine the health care law are downright scary for our family. To watch a politician play partisan games with my daughter’s health care has been gut-wrenching — we deserve better.
You know, Kevin Cramer likes to say that one vote matters. And it sure did. Heidi’s vote against the partisan health care repeal bill has saved my family.
I’m so grateful to Heidi for fighting for Allison’s access to health care. It’s because of Heidi’s leadership to preserve the best parts of the law that Allison isn’t facing another lifetime cap, and can’t be discriminated against due to her pre-existing condition. https://t.co/d32oCPWSin
The health care law’s patient protections give my family hope that Allison will get the health care she needs for as long as she lives. It helps me make sure my daughter lives her life to her full potential. That’s what every parent wants. https://t.co/4k2aXD6qJd
All of us are 10 seconds away from disability. No one plans to be diagnosed w/a disorder or disease. No one plans to need health care so badly, but so many NDans do. That’s why access to health care — w/o lifetime caps but w/protections for pre-existing conditions — is critical. https://t.co/rkFaketarq
The pain and the heartache of watching your child suffer is excruciating &amp; indescribable. But the security of making sure my child gets everything she needs to be as healthy as she can be for as long as she can, is priceless. https://t.co/rbGgKnNEas
Each week, Allison gets enzyme replacement therapy infusions. That’s what I attribute her health &amp; survival to — but they’re very expensive. Before the ACA, Allison had a $2 million cap on her insurance. She would’ve passed it by now &amp; she’d hit any lifetime cap w/in a few years. https://t.co/QM6Z8MDcVR
Allison was diagnosed with MPS right before her 2nd birthday. We were told that with the natural progression of this disease, and no treatment, she would be bedridden by the age of 8 and dead by the age of 10. Thankfully, this year, she turned 17. https://t.co/J8hEnMn4yN
Here’s Allison. She likes bowling, reading, fashion and doing fashion shows for charity — she modeled in one earlier this week. She also has a genetic disorder called Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1. https://t.co/3rEcEw39pr
Hi everyone — my name’s Jennifer and I live in West Fargo. I’m a wife and a mom to daughters Ashley and Allison. I’ll be taking over Heidi’s Twitter for the next few hours to tell our family’s story. #ndsen #ndpol https://t.co/phDDwK1NwV
1 MORE WEEK. That’s the time we have left to win this election and make sure that North Dakota continues to have an independent voice in the Senate. I need you to be a part of this. Sign up to help us win: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq
In 2007, the town of Northwood was nearly wiped out by a tornado. These days, you can barely even tell — that’s a testament to the community coming together &amp; the North Dakota values I grew up with in Mantador. Thanks to everyone for welcoming me! https://t.co/dsoa9gF1x0
It’s such an honor to have former Sen. Kent Conrad’s support. He was able to accomplish so much for North Dakota in the Senate, and I’m proud to continue his legacy of building across-the-aisle coalitions to get real results.		https://t.co/qcTOXkw4Q8 https://t.co/OEmQxnpDjn
Let's be clear about what’s at stake in this election. @kevincramer says that 1 vote matters — I couldn’t agree more. I’m proud of my vote to defend protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions. He’s voted against them time &amp; again. Our health care is on the ballot next week. https://t.co/ZeWR2XJTTu
It’s my birthday today! And though I really, really wanted cake on my first birthday, this year I’d love it if you voted early. Early voting is open in Burleigh, Cass, Grand Forks, Morton, Stark, Stutsman and Ward counties. Your early vote is the best gift you could give me! https://t.co/5Vk4GrQ8vb
Supporting North Dakota students is so important to me — that’s why I voted against Betsy DeVos &amp; I’ve been proud to help champion affordable education in the Senate. I visited @JimmieKnight this evening to speak to some of the future leaders of our state! https://t.co/9LxrVLLQIu
Tomorrow you’ll see my friend Jennifer from West Fargo posting from my Twitter account. Her daughter Allison has a rare genetic disorder. Because Allison’s treatment costs more than $300K a year, they rely on the health care law’s ban on lifetime caps to afford her insurance. https://t.co/LKTH2O7nWS
Visited the ethanol plant in Spiritwood today! Ethanol is a win-win for North Dakota. It supports both our all-of-the-above energy economy and our farmers. That’s why I’m a strong supporter of the Renewable Fuel Standard, while my opponent would rather eliminate it. https://t.co/pJblGZ7Rj3
Grabbed some quiche in Lisbon, then went to Enderlin and Wimbledon to discuss my record of success for ND. Thanks to all the folks I saw out there! I heard the same thing over and over again from those folks — this trade war could hurt ND agriculture for the long haul. https://t.co/O7CovScaLt
Stopped by Pizza Corner in Valley City for lunch — wonderful to see so many folks! Thanks for talking with me about protecting North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions, ending this trade war and preserving Medicare and Social Security. https://t.co/1wkBw4rNRo
My opponent is committed to voting with his political party 100% of the time. Here’s the difference between @kevincramer and me: I’ve spent my time in the Senate fighting for ND 100% of the time &amp; getting results. He’s done neither. I’m so grateful for the @bistrib’s endorsement! https://t.co/DWywhwjp5i
Iconic American companies like Caterpillar and Ford are getting hit by this trade war, and so are North Dakota farmers &amp; workers. While I’ve stood with North Dakota against this trade war from the start, @kevincramer has cheered it on.		https://t.co/mlzr5a0l3g
.@kevincramer has taken what he’s called 65 “symbolic votes” to repeal or undermine the health care law that bans lifetime insurance caps &amp; protects folks with pre-existing conditions. If you’re concerned about health care I’m asking for your vote on 11/6.	https://t.co/YRiRpq9qb8
Fargo is a city of tremendous diversity that I’ve been proud to support. Thank you to the New American community for welcoming me for a rally tonight! Let’s #BringitHomeHeidi. https://t.co/vv46x0XUTH
This trade war is hurting farmers, energy producers, manufacturers and everyone else in North Dakota. Both @kevincramer and I were elected to represent North Dakotans — but only one of us is standing up for our economy. https://t.co/imcSk9oOCY
My law school professor Steve came to help knock doors and make calls so we can finish strong! I’m so grateful for volunteers like him (and you!). https://t.co/ELosjVjpyM
Thousands of North Dakotans have already voted by mail — thank you! Feel free to make sure your vote has been counted here: https://t.co/wx5E4ccXJJ
Other partisan politicians might agree with him, but not a single North Dakota health care organization does. You can’t trust Kevin Cramer with your health care. Period. https://t.co/wFMk2Dwa9k
Now, he supports a lawsuit seeking to strike down the law in its entirety — including patient protections for North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/t6nIjEl17f
He voted 5 times to repeal the health care law without a replacement. https://t.co/RFTDys4LNC
.@kevincramer has spent this entire campaign trying to rewrite his record on health care, but I won’t let him use Washington DC doubletalk to pretend he hasn’t worked to undermine North Dakotans’ health care for six years.
I’m thrilled to receive the endorsement of the @BisTrib! I’ve spent the past 6 years working across the aisle to get results for ND; among them are lifting the oil export ban, bringing a vet center to GF and defending pre-existing condition protections.		https://t.co/4IbIYcwI6k
Tonight’s Fargo event might’ve been our last Hotdish with Heidi, but don’t worry — I’m fueled up and fired up for the long haul. Let’s bring it home! https://t.co/WGKWcmNkNp

This huge pile of unsold soybeans in Casselton is what the trade war looks like. Our farmers can’t sell their beans &amp; it’s hurting our economy. But @kevincramer doesn’t care — he’s committed to voting with his political party 100% of the time rather than standing up for ND. https://t.co/pEEee0ejgi
I’m so proud to have the support of the #NunsOnTheBus of @NETWORKLobby. From an early age, I’ve been inspired by my faith to pursue the common good, a value I’ve always sought to uphold in the Senate. https://t.co/ajAJEUqPMU
It’s simple — health care is on the ballot in this year’s election. If @kevincramer’s crusade against the health care law succeeds, Jennifer’s daughter Allison could hit her lifetime limit on coverage in just a few years. I’ll never vote to allow that. https://t.co/4RL7M7Xucs
Our last debate just finished, and I couldn’t be more fired up to push through the last 11 days of this race and win. This race is going to be close, just like it was in 2012. I need to have you on my team for the final sprint: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/wOB3MDEiiG
Kevin Cramer is all in on the president, I'm all in on North Dakota. #NDSen #NDSenDebate https://t.co/eIHeXraLNn
Kevin, when asked about the trade war, you said "that's why we have bins." I'd like to see you say that to farmers. The end of this trade war is long overdue. It's time you stand up for North Dakota farmers. #NDSen #NDSenDebate https://t.co/wP8hWOEMp7
Kevin Cramer calls them entitlements — but North Dakotans worked hard to earn their Social Security benefits. I'm proud to fight to protect those benefits. #NDSenDebate #NDSen https://t.co/QWSrjmwPrU

Tonight’s debate is an opportunity for all North Dakotans to see where my opponent and I differ — on issues like health care, trade &amp; protecting Medicare &amp; Social Security. I hope you’ll tune in to WDAY, KVLY, KXMB, or KFYR tonight at 7pm!
Just took a tour and spoke with employees at @msftfargo. Discussed how I’ve spent my first term in the Senate fighting for North Dakota and answered questions about how we can fix health care, the debt and Washington gridlock. https://t.co/ZNvSQDPwZX

Angel can’t vote, but that doesn’t make her any less important to me — I represent North Dakotan dogs too. I was given this adorable framed picture of Angel earlier this week. I’m so glad she’s enjoyed our commercials! #DogsforHeidi https://t.co/nUpm3LjGLb
I support comprehensive and affordable health care for folks with pre-existing conditions. My opponent doesn’t. Here’s how he’s worked to undermine coverage for cancer survivors and folks with asthma and diabetes: https://t.co/QRVOt6jCWW
North Dakota feeds the world, but we won’t be able to if we keep undermining our trade relationships. This trade war that @kevincramer supports is bad for North Dakota’s economy. I won’t stop fighting for North Dakotans, even if my opponent has already given up. https://t.co/SwDNdpvaH7
Tomorrow, I’ll be debating @KevinCramer in our second and, unfortunately, last debate. Just like last Thursday, I’ll highlight how I’ve defended folks with pre-existing conditions, fought against the trade war &amp; been an independent voice for North Dakota. Tune in to WDAY at 7pm!
You probably remember Denise — she’s a Killdeer native with heart disease &amp; she’s taking @kevincramer to task for trying to rewrite his record on health care: “Cramer openly supports a dangerous lawsuit that would seriously weaken our health care system.” 	https://t.co/d5MQrZ7WNY
Stopped by @ndscswildcats this morning to meet with students, faculty and administrators. Our colleges and universities are preparing the next generation of North Dakotans to step up and lead in our communities and I’m proud to support them. https://t.co/ASOKqo7n3Z

Today, fmr SecDef &amp; fmr Republican Sen Chuck Hagel and I stopped in Grand Forks, Mayville and Fargo.

It’s #NationalFoodDay today. North Dakota feeds the world, so protecting our farmers could not be more important. That’s why I’ve been pushing back against this trade war since Day One. And the effects of this trade war won’t stop w/farmers:		https://t.co/xQlQbHCro8
As North Dakota’s senator, my job is to get results — and that’s what I do. While my opponent brags about standing with his party 100 percent of the time, I’m proud to be a moderate. I wasn’t sent to the Senate to pick a team — I was sent there to fight for you. https://t.co/QhRaKqrkWx
Blaine Kummer is a farmer in Colfax. His son, Owen, has had a pre-existing condition since he was born. I’ll keep fighting, for Blaine and Owen, against @KevinCramer’s trade war and attempts to cut protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/U4r6v5MTeu
Chuck Hagel knows service — after earning 2 Purple Hearts in Vietnam, he went into business before becoming a Republican Senator for Nebraska and eventually the U.S. Secretary of Defense. It was an honor to have him with me to thank our vets in Bismarck, Minot and New Town today! https://t.co/KcSvpy6C2Q

I've always pledged to be an independent voice for ND. That’s why I took on my party to protect our gun rights &amp; reign in wasteful spending.

Cramer’s actions leave North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions by the wayside. 3/3 		https://t.co/vjtbJqsrJ9
Last year, @kevincramer voted for a health care bill the president called “mean.” Before that, he recklessly voted five times to repeal the health care law without a replacement. Now, he supports a lawsuit that would effectively do the same. 2/3
In 2000, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a really difficult time for me — I’m sure many of you remember that. Luckily for me, I survived. But that means that my history with cancer will be a pre-existing condition for the rest of my life. 1/3

Thanks to all of the tribal leaders who joined me for our roundtable and lunch today. We discussed important issues facing ND tribes — from missing and murdered indigenous women to health care and addiction. It’s critical we continue to support NDans struggling with these issues. https://t.co/wKaNBqqlu4
"The 1% has never had it so good," but "For most U.S. workers, real wages have barely budged." That's not good enough. North Dakotans deserve an economy where workers aren't left behind. I'll keep fighting to make sure they can thrive.
Last night I had my first debate. It’s easy to go to Congress &amp; commit to voting with 1 side 100% of the time — but that’s not what I’ve done. I’m committed not to doing the easy thing, but the right thing: to being a moderate voice for ND &amp; solving real problems that NDans face. https://t.co/DWooCrCzXh
In 2012, we won by less than 3k votes and we know this year will be just as close. Here are 3 things you can do right now to help us win:	1. Vote by mail: https://t.co/iFTAmuGcHg	2. Volunteer: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq 	3. Tell your friends to vote: https://t.co/enjfuwfoWd https://t.co/AOKuKMQ4AG
Just finished my 1st debate — I hope I made you proud! North Dakotans deserve a senator who will prioritize them 100% of the time. I’m asking for your vote because I want to continue fighting for better health care, an end to this trade war, and support for seniors and veterans.
North Dakota's seniors have earned their Social Security and Medicare through a lifetime of work. I'm proud to stand with them — even when @kevincramer won't. https://t.co/DlDykel7Rj
Fortunately for us all — especially cancer survivors like me — neither of those bills became law. But just imagine if there were more senators like @kevincramer. What would your health care look like?
AARP weren’t fans of the AHCA either. They said it “would weaken Medicare’s fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for Americans aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities,”
Thankfully, other lawmakers didn’t think Graham-Cassidy was “genius” &amp; it didn’t pass. But @kevincramer also voted for the AHCA, which would have done the same thing. Maybe that’s why the president called the AHCA “mean.”
Under Graham-Cassidy, “millions of people with pre-existing conditions would lose access to these protections, and, as a result, would lose access to needed coverage and care” according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
I want to remind you where @kevincramer really stands on health care. He called the Graham-Cassidy health care bill “genius,” even though it would’ve allowed states to waive protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. #NDSenDebate

I’m about to begin the 1st debate with my opponent, @KevinCramer. I’ve long said I’ll put my independent record of delivering results up against anyone’s, and I’m eager to do just that tonight. It would mean the world to me to know you’re watching. https://t.co/l48zKdHArb
As ND’s former attorney general, I’ve spent my career working hand-in-glove with the folks that protect us and keep our communities strong and safe. Don’t just take my word for it — I’m proud to be endorsed by the @BPUnion. https://t.co/TOIa9LEmrx
NDans who’ve spent their whole lives working hard shouldn’t have to worry about retiring with dignity, but too many are seeing their earned pensions and benefits like Medicare and Social Security being used as piggy banks for the government to raid. https://t.co/gBXF5f2nfL
My opponent’s record on health care is clear: He voted 5 times to recklessly repeal the health care law without a replacement and now supports a lawsuit to do the same. Supporting folks with pre-existing conditions is essential — I know that as a breast cancer survivor. https://t.co/pHsMZvSFCU
Ensuring children have access to health insurance is not controversial. But @KevinCramer still found a way to play politics with it — his committee allowed funding for the program to expire. 		https://t.co/uXwHrfYyBj
A strong Farm Bill is critical to keeping North Dakota’s economy healthy. We’re working to craft another good bill, but House Republicans are playing politics and trying to cut food assistance. Our grocers are right — that would be wrong for ND.		https://t.co/fq7nS6OFHS
North Dakota’s an agricultural state and I’ve always been proud to stand with our family farmers. I’m fighting for a strong Farm Bill, increased Renewable Fuel Standard volumes and an end to this trade war. That’s why I’ve been endorsed by @NFUDC. https://t.co/chrbuHlze4
My opponent has been searching for ways to cut Medicare and Social Security for his entire career. Today in Bowman, I promised our seniors that I’ll never support cutting those benefits that they’ve earned over decades of hard work. https://t.co/2eVYwdCOkO
Good ideas don’t only come from one side of the aisle — and frankly, bad ones don’t either. That’s why I’ve worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get wins for North Dakota. I’ll never be 100% with anyone but North Dakotans. https://t.co/Sm2GzYwtIG
There’s lots of great hotdish in ND — thanks to everyone in Williston who came out to share their family recipes! I love talking with people all over about how we can continue to fight for our farmers, seniors and folks with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/XkhpkBDQMA
I stopped by a couple of North Dakota’s coal-fired power plants today to meet with employees and talk about the future of coal. I’ve spent my 1st term supporting our all-of-the-above energy industry including ensuring that there’s a viable path forward for ND coal. https://t.co/rtCFMjMFXF
.@KevinCramer voted 5 times to completely repeal federal funding for Medicaid expansion, which has provided tens of thousands of NDans with health insurance and kept many rural hospitals afloat. Now he supports a lawsuit that would have the same effect.
We've got to get back to fiscal discipline in Washington. @KevinCramer voted to balloon the deficit and now is using the deficit to support his long-held goal of cutting Medicare and Social Security. That's just wrong.  		https://t.co/SSOiqaeV6R https://t.co/Va88fp2GAz

ND seniors worked hard and paid into the Medicare and Social Security for years, so I won’t stand for empty-suited Washington politicians like my opponent who want to sell the benefits they've earned to the highest bidder. Seniors helped build this state and they deserve respect. https://t.co/Pb2ldB0HCY
As a breast cancer survivor, I know how important it is to protect folks w/ pre-existing conditions — I’ve always voted those values. @KevinCramer voted 5 times to take their coverage away &amp; for a bill the president called “mean”: https://t.co/0QwDEQ3yhN

Unlike my opponent @kevincramer, I know it takes more than just talk to protect our borders. That's why @BPUnion endorsed me over him. Days ago, the Senate unanimously passed my bill to help fully staff our borders. I’ll keep delivering every day for ND. 		https://t.co/94YpVSoqXe
I'm proud to be a member of Bud’s Brigade. Bud Schmitz served as mayor of Wahpeton and cares deeply for the community. As a fellow cancer survivor I know he'll beat this latest health issue and I wish him well. #budsbrigade https://t.co/czoaCfRsuW
Happy Birthday to the Navy! North Dakota has a proud tradition of military service — my dad was a World War II vet — and I’m committed to continuing to fight for our military and the men and women serving in it. #NavyBirthday

Congressman Cramer supports the lawsuit to undo health care protections for North Dakotans — part of his long record of undermining patient protections for the 300K of us with pre-existing conditions like cancer, asthma or diabetes. I’ll never stand for that.
I’ve been so happy to support North Dakota’s great art scene with my Creative Energy events in Fargo and Bismarck. Thanks to all the talented artists who contributed their works and attended! https://t.co/TxNMFRdaFF
#NationalFarmersDay was yesterday — I’m so proud to represent an ag state like ND. But right now, our farmers are under siege from this trade war. There’s no doubt we should hold China accountable, but never on the backs of our family farmers.		https://t.co/MaglSJ7QAp
Manufacturers and workers are a critical part of ND’s economy and this trade war is putting them at risk. That’s what I talked about with plant employees in Gwinner. Then we headed to the local watering hole for a quick beer! https://t.co/KxuFtqAZlh

I’m a breast cancer survivor — these attacks on folks with pre-existing conditions are personal for me and for so many across our state. North Dakota deserves better.
First, he voted to completely repeal our health care law five times w/o a replacement. Then, he voted for a bill that would have gutted those protections — the president called it “mean.” Now, he supports a lawsuit in Texas seeking to strike down these protections in court.
One of the most consistent parts of Congressman Kevin Cramer’s record is his desire to eliminate patient protections for the 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions like cancer, asthma and diabetes.		https://t.co/WyjPoMO3cr
I’m never too busy to discuss the issues in front of North Dakotans. That’s why I’m calling on @KevinCramer to cut out the political games &amp; get on the debate stage. As @PrairiePublic said, “The ball's in the Cramer camp's court.”		https://t.co/VWFhVu6rZu

I’ve always been a fervent advocate for North Dakota’s all-of-the-above energy economy, but my opponent hasn’t — just yesterday he told WDAY that he thinks the Renewable Fuel Standard is picking winners and losers and was hostile to wind energy tax credits.
My #TBT this week goes to @KevinCramer. He said disagreeing with the president is like cheating on a spouse. Then he promised to vote with him 100 percent of the time. Maybe that’s why he’s refused to #StandwithND against this reckless trade war.		https://t.co/YWArYGj5tz

Our family farmers are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars because of this trade war, no thanks to @KevinCramer. You can spend 30 years building a market and 1 year losing it.

I’ve always said there’s room to improve the health care law. But I agree with the vast majority of folks that we can’t lose protections for the 300K NDans w/ pre-existing conditions. @KevinCramer has repeatedly supported measures to get rid of them.
I know neither political party represents North Dakota. Republicans too often side with the powerful and Democrats don’t understand our way of life. And both do nothing but fight. That’s why I put party aside and do what’s right for North Dakota. https://t.co/mWX56fbMOB

Voting on a Supreme Court Nominee is one of the most important decisions a senator makes. Every day, I wake up thinking about what's best for North Dakota — and since I was elected to the Senate, I’ve been an independent voice for North Dakota.
NDans sent me to the Senate to do the job. While I want nothing more than to be with you in ND, duty calls. Unfortunately, I’ll need to be in the Senate to vote on Friday, so our first debate will be rescheduled for the near future.
I stood up when @KevinCramer &amp; his D.C. allies tried to eliminate critical protections for folks w/pre-existing conditions. As a cancer survivor, I know “hypothetical” support for folks who’ve had cancer, asthma or diabetes is no more than D.C. swamp talk. https://t.co/HIyDVaczwU
I’ve always said that there are parts of the health care law we need to fix, but we can’t throw out the crucial patient protections in it, too. @KevinCramer recklessly voted to repeal the law without a replacement 5x, and now supports a lawsuit to do the same. https://t.co/FvNfEkJolf

What most folks don’t understand about our trade relationships is that we’ve worked hard to build them ourselves. The soybean checkoff that the elevator takes from each bushel goes to invest in R&amp;D and building new markets. https://t.co/s6vYFV4N9g
It’s times like these — with the trade war raging — that I worry for our kids about the future of farming. We’re spending a lot of time around here clearing out storage areas because nobody’ll buy our soybeans. It could cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars. https://t.co/f6dP3pL8vI
I’ve got two children: my son is 3 and a half, and my daughter is 18 months. Most days I want to pass this land and profession down to my children, but sometimes, I think it might be easier for them if I didn’t. https://t.co/gWPIQW0rpA
My wife’s a farm girl from nearby. She works as a physical therapist. We’re lucky she’s got a flexible job — she takes time out in the spring for planting and fall for harvest. But that makes getting health care tough and low crop prices makes it even harder to afford. https://t.co/zWf5erlBRb
Hi, this is Brad and I’m a farmer who’s #HereforHeidi. I grow soybeans and corn 17 miles north of Valley City, North Dakota. I’ll be taking over Heidi’s social media today — at least until I have to get back to work. It is harvest time, after all. https://t.co/PxG9vPGcBN
50 days out from Election Day → 50 volunteer shifts in our Fargo office today. If there was ever a time to volunteer with our campaign, it’s now! My race was the closest Senate race in the country in 2012. Sign up to volunteer: https://t.co/6kapAQ3Jaq https://t.co/X9zAAsjsdD

Our farmers have become collateral damage in a geopolitical battle they had nothing to do with. But I’ll keep fighting to end the trade war because I’ll always fight for North Dakota — 100% of the time.		https://t.co/TFYpyawwqt

My opponent is just wrong on health care. He supported completely repealing our health care five times, and now endorses a lawsuit to do the same. If it succeeds, it will “rewind some protections for the vast majority of Americans.”		https://t.co/QaWap5QXmi

We’re on the brink of a crisis here in farm country, and it’s completely the result of bad policies, like this trade war, supported by my opponent. Let’s hold China accountable, but not at the expense of our rural communities. 		https://t.co/8tM96dtvxr

Uff da. @KevinCramer skipped our ag forum at @BigIronFarmShow. What he didn't tell @WDAYnews was he chose a high-$ TX fundraiser over our farmers. He says “90% of success in this business is showing up,” so why has he run from debating me 6 times now—this time all the way to TX? https://t.co/0JkAcKlznN

Team Heidi will be marching in the Autumnfest Parade in Bismarck on Saturday, and I’d love to have you there in support! Parades are so much fun — and you get a free Heidi t-shirt. Our team will be lining up at 9am in the Capitol Grounds Loop. https://t.co/53EGwbs5Q6
North Dakota farmers like Charles are feeling the pain from this trade war. But rather than standing up for North Dakota, my opponent is toeing the party line. Kevin Cramer either doesn’t get it or doesn’t seem to care that this trade war is costing farmers and farm families. https://t.co/dlmU8IOBj7
This week at Big Iron, I heard from a farmer who thanked me for crossing party lines to bring relief to community banks &amp; credit unions here in North Dakota. It’s cutting through red tape to enable small banks to serve their communities better. Read more:		https://t.co/l5hWlfmT18

Every day as ND’s senator, I wake up and fight for our state and rural America. That’s why I made sure to show up at Big Iron earlier this week. I’m so proud to accept the support of the Farmers Union! https://t.co/eLaGPlYTH2
Had a fantastic time yesterday hearing directly from farmers at Big Iron yesterday. I got pancakes, heard from folks at the Ag Forum, and then toasted with a few of our farmers. Hearing from NDans in-person is the most important part of my job. https://t.co/2b8FgM3nUx

At the ag issues forum, we had a good discussion about trade, biofuels and the Farm Bill — but there was a notable absence. When it comes to fighting for North Dakota, I’ll always show up and I’ll always have your back. https://t.co/J3hq8zaYcR
Protections for folks with pre-existing conditions are so important — I know because I have 1 as a cancer survivor. There’s lots to fix in the law, but stripping protections from 300K NDans with cancer, asthma, diabetes etc. should be off the table. 		https://t.co/ZMEtcWyJH6
You can make calls, knock doors, put up a yard sign or walk in a parade, but the most important thing you can do to help us win is vote early. It’s easy, I promise! Just request your ballot here: https://t.co/oyNEtwiH9d
Farmers at @BigIronFarmShow yesterday told me they’re deeply concerned as this trade war rages on. They deserved to hear from @KevinCramer too, but instead he hid behind closed doors at a high-dollar fundraiser for the second time in one week.		https://t.co/5OVW5Phigg
Rural America should not be treated like collateral damage — that’s why ending this trade war is my greatest concern.
No one wants China to cheat on trade, but there’s a smarter way to enforce trade laws than a full-fledged trade war that’s causing China to slap taxes on North Dakota goods like crude oil and soybeans.
And while the administration continues to escalate this trade war with my opponent’s full support, North Dakotans are feeling the pinch.
Understandably, our agricultural producers are also worried about this trade war. The damage from the trade war extends to other sectors of our economy, like our manufacturers and energy suppliers, as well.
In 2014, I helped write, negotiate &amp; pass a Farm Bill with broad support from across the aisle and I’m committed to doing the same this year. I’m working to increase Renewable Fuel Standard requirements, promote ag exports to Cuba &amp; elsewhere, and help young &amp; beginning farmers.
Today at the #2018BigIronFarmShow I heard from North Dakota’s farmers about what they expect from their elected officials. They stressed the importance of a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill. Thankfully, this isn’t my first rodeo.
On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay yesterday, I convened a summit of leaders on suicide prevention in Fargo to tackle this epidemic afflicting North Dakota head on. There’s nothing more important to me than keeping our communities strong and safe. 		https://t.co/28IujZev5i
I’m about to get on the phone with @JoelKFGO to talk to him live about the Farm Bill, trade war and other issues affecting working North Dakotans. Tune in!
Just finished talking with farmers at the #2018BigIronFarmShow — just told them, "This trade war should not be fought on the back of American farmers, North Dakota farmers — and I'm going to keep saying it." #AgChat
At the @BigIronFarmShow, I just told the crowd about the trade war: “The time to speak up is now. It's not to wait til next year. The time to speak up is right now.” #AgTalk

Kevin Cramer supports this lawsuit that would take away protections for 300K NDans w/ pre-existing conditions like cancer, asthma &amp; diabetes. I’ve been working across the aisle to fix the health law, but this lawsuit is dangerous, partisan &amp; bad for ND. 		https://t.co/ekotltXNyT
Increasing Renewable Fuel Standard volumes could help many of our growers weather the storm and continue to expand our energy economy, even though my opponent thinks we should eliminate RFS entirely.
ND’s farmers are already facing tough times with low commodity prices and trade uncertainty, so they’re understandably looking for some stability.		https://t.co/EwXkWTWfor

My opponent supports a lawsuit that would take away protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. I’m with North Dakota 100% here — he’s with his political party.
300K NDans have pre-existing conditions, so it’s no wonder that the vast majority want to keep the protections for them. As a cancer survivor, I know how harmful it would be to throw protections for people out. 		https://t.co/djjLGgPxCL

Every day in the Senate, I fight for folks who’ve spent their whole lives working, like Al Thomas. That’s why I helped write the Butch Lewis Act — because NDans who’ve worked hard and earned their pension deserve nothing less than what they were promised. Hear Al’s story: https://t.co/os6GguXtpm

I’m committed to supporting ND 100% of the time &amp; that means fighting back against this trade war. Manufacturers like Amity are hurting. @kevincramer set September as his deadline to speak up for ND, but when it comes to standing up for us, he’s MIA.		https://t.co/SYGsIm8ict

It’s not just our farmers &amp; ranchers who are hurting in this trade war, it’s also manufacturers like Tri W-G in Valley City. My opponent said he’d start standing up for us in September, but when it comes to fighting for ND, we’ve heard nothing from him.		https://t.co/0nrJGsbf4n

All the while, my opponent has advocated against wind energy tax credits. North Dakotans know they can trust me to grow our energy economy — because I’ve got a proven track record of doing just that.
For years, I’ve fought for policies to make sure that ND’s wind energy sector can continue to grow as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. I’m honored to have received @AWEA’s Wind Champion Award &amp; to see our wind industry thrive at the same time!		https://t.co/BAGwOzkKxC

ND is in the crosshairs of this trade war. All over, I hear growing concern &amp; the same call to action. We deserve leadership that puts our state 1st — never 2nd to DC political bosses. I’ll be damned if this trade war is going to be fought on NDans’ backs.	https://t.co/DBR3wUgkrt

This is not what progress for North Dakota’s farmers and ranchers look like. Like my opponent, I represent North Dakotans. But unlike my opponent, I’ve stood up for them on this trade war since Day One.		https://t.co/QRpie16IcQ
We’re giving this signed hat out to whoever does the most volunteer shifts in August. This campaign is built on door knocks and phone calls from people like you — and we need your help! Sign up now: https://t.co/N8LLoDNMfc https://t.co/ZW8HsIUCpI
Sarah wanted a picture with me for her first day of school, but this was the best her dad could do on short notice! Happy first day of school to Sarah &amp; so many other North Dakota kids! Good luck this year &amp; keep those adorable first day pictures coming. ✏️ 🍎 https://t.co/zTpf6YRByG
In North Dakota, farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and energy suppliers are feeling the pain. My opponent’s trade war is hurting nearly every sector of our economy. Take it from the experts: 		https://t.co/gvoBA3kf2F
Today, we’re launching Teachers for Heidi. Our educators are critical in helping North Dakota grow and thrive — I’m honored that so many of them are #HereforHeidi. https://t.co/2ztDlUFNj4
I’ll put my record on health care up against anyone’s. Kevin Cramer supports a lawsuit that could risk protections for up to 300K NDans w/ pre-existing conditions. I’ve been working to find solutions we can all agree on — that’s what NDans expect.		https://t.co/6wFmZUhfUK https://t.co/r0uq9sbdGJ
It's not just our farmers and ranchers — it's also #smallbiz like Tri W-G in Valley City that are paying the price for this reckless trade war. Read more in the @inforum. 		https://t.co/A9Q2y9eSxv
I learned the value of public education from my mom who was a school cook &amp; janitor — but Betsy DeVos has made it her priority to dismantle it. As NDans head back to school, I’ll keep putting teachers, students and families first — 100% of the time.		https://t.co/QP68DsPPPX

The trade war is creating more uncertainty by the day, making it harder for ND farmers to sell their crop. Our responsibility is to help ag producers access more markets — not less. In his support for the trade war, my opponent has turned his back on ND.		https://t.co/x03hixIU2S

Happy National #SeniorCitizensDay! Every North Dakotan who’s worked hard for their paycheck deserves to retire with dignity. That’s why I’ve fought to save pensions for NDans and to strengthen Social Security &amp; Medicare in the Senate. https://t.co/6GvgzkPpid
This trade war is hurting real North Dakotans, especially our ag producers, but my opponent is cheering it on for political gain. Our soybean farmers were expecting a group of buyers to come to North Dakota — now they’ve cancelled their trip. 		https://t.co/uQpo7qThkQ

“If you’re a banker, are you going to like not getting your money?” — Jim Broten, ND family farmer. My opponent supports this trade war that's reverberating across ND’s economy. I’ll keep fighting for ND, not DC party bosses. 		https://t.co/EmpfnXCCFu
Greeting our heroes during their Honor Flight to DC is one of my favorite parts of serving in the Senate. Thanks to Don Roberts for supporting ND vets and this incredible program.		https://t.co/ph6oN5PZLR
I’ve worked w/ both parties to bring down costs and improve access to care for North Dakotans — especially folks with pre-existing conditions. My opponent has repeatedly stood against critical patient protections for so many in our state. 		https://t.co/LbavealaEo
I love spending time on a beautiful summer night with some great friends and supporters. It was a wonderful evening of burgers, brats and brews last night in Mandan. https://t.co/euPKa3ubKc
Farmers didn’t sign up to be collateral in this trade war. Our elected officials owe farmers &amp; ranchers better than to throw them under the bus — but Kevin Cramer refuses to stand up for North Dakota.		https://t.co/wNhKC8dM2V
As a breast cancer survivor, I know access to care can mean life or death &amp; I’ve always fought to protect NDans w/ pre-existing conditions. My opponent's policies could make any insurance guarantee for them "relatively worthless.”		https://t.co/22wq8wtrM8
North Dakota’s workers are the foundation of our strong economy. I’m proud to have been part of opening the new Ironworkers Local 512 Training Center in Bismarck today! https://t.co/hFM8C4puge
The difference is clear: My opponent continues to cheerlead this trade war, while I’m fighting for certainty &amp; strong markets. Take it from Nancy Johnson of the ND Soybean Growers Assn: "This is not about us—we are just the collateral damage." 		https://t.co/2WKB9apcRJ

As a breast cancer survivor, I’m also one of the more than 300,000 North Dakotans with a pre-existing condition that could lose coverage altogether if my opponent gets his way.
Happy #NationalNonprofitDay! I hope you’ll select a worthy charity and give them a few extra dollars today if you can spare it. There are so many wonderful organizations helping make North Dakota an even better place.
My little hometown of Mantador is the kind of place where the whole community pitches in to help each other. So when my parents needed to reshingle our house, 41 friends and neighbors came over to do it all in a day. North Dakotans make the best neighbors. #TBT https://t.co/26fC4ZLAoc
RT @nodakhicks5: @HeidiHeitkamp I traveled from Minot to Fargo and look who I saw! Because no matter where you are— Heidi is right for ND!…
As the picture of the true cost of this trade war sharpens, one thing has always been clear: For North Dakota farmers, livelihoods are on the line. I’m fighting back, because North Dakotans lose when our elected officials fail to lead.		https://t.co/pMBl3DydAe
We might be 82 days to Election Day, but voting in North Dakota starts just next month by mail. Request your mail ballot today and get voting! 🗳️🗳️🗳️		https://t.co/naIB2ls8Af
Like 300,000 NDans, my friend Denise has a pre-existing condition. For her it’s heart disease, for me it’s breast cancer. But @kevincramer has voted to gut protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions like cancer, heart disease or asthma. WATCH: https://t.co/v37HMJzUJq
Over 300k North Dakotans w/ pre-existing conditions could lose life-saving care due to a lawsuit my opponent supports. It’s another example of his 1 &amp; only campaign promise: To leave ND behind 100% of the time the administration asks him to. I’ll always fight for ND and only ND. https://t.co/IJgtZBYy8i
I’m starting to see Heidi yard signs popping up all over the place! Jeremy is going to be dropping them off all over state over the next few days. Want your own? Show your neighbors you’re #HereforHeidi: https://t.co/b6oUNzffTr https://t.co/Ujwkmo2jV6

It’s Social Security’s 83rd birthday! Making sure North Dakota seniors can retire with the dignity they earned &amp; deserve is a top priority for me. That’s why I have and will stand strong against efforts to cut back this remarkably successful program in the Senate. https://t.co/s7rjUrdA6I
Nearly half of all NDans have a pre-existing condition like asthma, diabetes or heart disease. My opponent just threw his support behind a lawsuit that would strike down protections. ND deserves better than those who would play politics with health care.		https://t.co/BgfLyEWBRX
“‘I’m terrified of this trade thing. I lose sleep over it,’ Andy Fedje, a farmer in Rugby, N.D., who devotes about a third of his land to growing soybeans, said.” No ND farmer ought to lose sleep or hard-earned money bc they’re being used as collateral in this trade war. https://t.co/ISuupALu0G
ND could lose its biggest customer for soybeans due to this trade war. We’re continuing to see the effects of this on our ag producers, manufacturers, energy producers, and every North Dakotan that ever shops at a grocery store.		https://t.co/Xl7cf3GTvl

If this trade war is allowed to continue, it will surely hit all sectors of North Dakota’s economy. First it was soybeans, and now it’s meat. We must end this trade war before it hurts North Dakotans’ pocketbooks even more.		https://t.co/9bshhV1RCY

We can and must get tough on China without allowing our farmers to get caught in the crosshairs — that’s why I’m working to expand trade opportunities and to end this harmful trade war that could spell devastation for our ag economy. 		https://t.co/BVZUBsv1Lg
I’m proud of the work that Grand Forks’ public servants’ have been doing to pursue justice for the tragic loss of Bailey Henke in 2015. Opioid addiction is an epidemic across North Dakota and I’ll keep fighting hand-in-hand with our leaders to end it.		https://t.co/QyfxCkFnGC
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau needs a leader who will be a compassionate advocate for North Dakota’s working families — the person at the helm must be empathetic and know the industries they’ll be tasked with regulating well.		https://t.co/KnhQ7LdGaP

Here’s my view: This trade war is hitting North Dakotans’ pocketbooks hard ― and threatens our economy over the long term. We can and should hold China accountable for cheating in the global economy, but we don’t need to use our ag producers and manufacturers as bargaining chips.
@bistrib: North Dakota, Minnesota companies feel effects of tariffs		@gfherald: Our view: Trade worries abound in north country
And it’s not just ag that’s hurting. ND’s other industries are also being hit hard: 		@willistonherald: Steel tariffs will cost North Dakota's oil and gas industry		@gfherald: North Dakota manufacturers left to weather uncertainty of trade war
@politico: The trade war comes to the prairie		@washingtonpost: China cancels US soybean purchases as trade war takes hold		@bpolitics: American Farm Groups Plead With Trump to Back Off China Trade Conflict
@gfherald: Our view: Risky times for region's ag producers		@WDAYnews: ‘We feel like we’re a bargaining chip’: N.D. soybean farmers fear trade war after Trump announces tariffs		@WHSVnews: North Dakota farmers looking for answers amid tariff uncertainty
@inforum: Trump tariffs prompt trade worries for N.D. soybean growers		@bistrib: North Dakota to lose a lot in trade war 		@willistonherald: Tariff talk already hurting farmers		@NBCNews: Soy farmers say they're getting hurt in Trump's trade war with China
North Dakota’s rural communities depend on a strong ag economy — that’s why I’m committed to fighting to end this trade war that’s hitting our farmers and ranchers. Here’s a thread of headlines on what’s happening on the ground:
If you’ve talked to a North Dakota ag producer recently, or even read the news, you’ve probably heard about how this trade war is really hurting their bottom lines.
From Turtle Mountain to Lincoln and Manvel, I’m so grateful for the incredible support from North Dakotans across the state who are #HereForHeidi ― both on and off the parade route. Together, we can keep our rural communities strong and thriving. https://t.co/WE06TVT5JL

We may have a sibling rivalry with South Dakota, but when it comes to the trade war, we're facing the same catastrophe. For our farmers, ‘wait and see’ is not a strategy. We need to stand up and fight for our ag economy now by ending this trade war.		https://t.co/LJnqFsyWBA

9️⃣ I’m focused on getting results for North Dakota &amp; I’ve built strong bonds across the aisle to do it. That’s why Republicans say I’m “stronger than battery acid.” 🔋
8️⃣ Every day when I wake up, I’m thinking about how I can fight for rural communities across North Dakota — that’s why I’ve been called “a force for rural America.”
7️⃣ When https://t.co/WXY4Rk26Mj was profiting from knowingly facilitating the trafficking of women and children, I fought tooth-and-nail to end it. I worked with both parties to shut down Backpage websites to keep our kids &amp; families safe. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
6️⃣ We face unique security challenges along the Northern Border — the world’s longest. My bipartisan Northern Border Security Review Act will help put a new strategy in place to keep our border secure and ND communities safe. 🇺🇸
5️⃣ North Dakota’s nuclear mission is critical to keeping our nation and our communities safe. That’s why I worked to reinforce our B-52 long-range bombers and it’s why I’ll always fight to keep North Dakota’s defense communities strong. ✈️
4️⃣ I worked with both sides to cut one-size-fits-all regulation, so that community banks and credit unions can keep providing the relationship lending our rural businesses &amp; families depend on. 🏦
3️⃣ When harmful EPA rules put our farmers in a tailspin, I helped lead the effort to rollback them back, giving our farmers much-needed certainty. 🚜
2️⃣ No one thought my Republican colleague Sen. Murkowski and I could lift the 40-year ban on oil exports in a year — but we did. That’s helped create good-paying jobs, while North Dakota became the second highest exporter of crude oil. 🛢️
1️⃣ When North Dakota farmers and ranchers were hit hard by one of the worst droughts since the 80s, I helped pass much-needed relief. 🌾🌾🚜

Proud to say we're launching Dogs for Heidi today! Just kidding. But they all look real cute in Heidi gear anyway: https://t.co/57yCpN9knI
RT @sofiargross: Senate candidates x Specs is too cool. Experiencing the campaign trail through @HeidiHeitkamp’s eyes 🇺🇸😎💫 https://t.co/1Oc…
How we treat children says so much about who we are as a country. That's why I signed onto the Keeping Families Together Act. I agree with former FLOTUS @laurawbush that the administration must stop this cruel practice. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/OlzN6ZWOoZ
Honored to take part in the Paha Yamini Wacipi at Porcupine yesterday — &amp; feeling lucky to see my friends Mary Louise Defender Wilson &amp; Danielle Ta’Sheena Finn. Danielle was Miss Indian World 2016, a superstar intern in my office &amp; hopefully someday will have my job as a senator. https://t.co/72sWrlxk1y
Happy #FathersDay especially to my friend @BrandonDelvo who became a dad early this Father's Day morning! Congratulations to you and Jessica on a happy, healthy son.
Growing up, I'd go on car rides w/my dad on Sundays while mom made a roast. We'd go to our cousins' grocery store &amp; get ice cream sandwiches to eat after dinner while watching Bonanza. Still smiling remembering that. Happy #FathersDay to every North Dakota dad. https://t.co/vZip2DjlQ2
We could not have had a better time in Valley City, Aneta, Page &amp; Lisbon today talking to our neighbors! Thank you to everyone who came out to say hello. https://t.co/OH3NHU9G3f
Thanks to everyone who came to eat pizza with me at @GfRhombus yesterday! Packed rooftop &amp; great company. https://t.co/ssGyXLS5G6
I’m with @ByronDorgan. We have an obligation to our kids — we can’t burden them w/ our spending while gutting the vital programs that they’ll depend on one day. The partisan tax plan is a broken promise that leaves working folks and future generations out to dry. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/xyY8UGJBWi
North Dakota's very own Mary Wakefield knows health care better than anybody. So proud to have her support in this campaign. Listen to why she's #HereforHeidi: https://t.co/hBiEZZyBg4
We're lucky to have such natural beauty here in North Dakota. Here's one of my favorite pictures of the ND landscape. Photo credit to my daughter — sorry, Ali! #NationalGreatOutdoorsMonth https://t.co/EvuJ7wpGIB
Madeline Miller has lived on her family farm in Wahpeton her whole life. The Millers have deep roots in North Dakota &amp; they know better than anybody how important it is to have an independent voice in Washington representing ND’s farmers. Check out why Madeline is #HereforHeidi: https://t.co/urn1hqzQzZ
A strong ag economy is a strong North Dakota — that's why I was proud to help pass a strong Farm Bill out of the Ag with both sides of the aisle. I’m committed to getting this bill across the finish line for North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers.		https://t.co/eeVUHUBnxb
So wonderful to read this story of generosity and selflessness from @PhillipsNicoleJ. That's the North Dakota spirit! https://t.co/wdrOT543IF

I'm not a rubber stamp for any political party — I only answer to North Dakotans. I'm proud to be an independent voice for my state. Watch now: https://t.co/FfxnGny1Pk
Nobody knows North Dakota better than former First Lady Grace Link. Grace’s activism, energy and love for ND never cease to inspire me – especially at 99 years young! That’s why I’m so honored and grateful to have her support this year. https://t.co/KrnnGHuwP3
More outdoor fun from this weekend! So glad to have supporters representing in Center, ND and at Coal Country Ribfest. https://t.co/CfuVbyj5M5
55 years ago, Congress passed the #EqualPayAct, an important step in our fight to make equal pay for equal work a reality. Fair pay is a family issue – that’s why I’m fighting to level the playing field so every child &amp; family can live the American Dream. https://t.co/2ZYcT4lgaa
Such a treat to visit Cappuccino on Collins in Mandan last week. Thanks for the coffee, Linda, Dot &amp; Joyce — I'll have to stop by again soon. ☕ https://t.co/Jhy8YSA2J7

I've worked with both Republicans &amp; Democrats to strengthen security on our northern and southern borders. Thanks to Sheriff Dannels of Arizona for the kind words in the @inforum. Will stay focused on commonsense solutions for this critical nat sec issue: https://t.co/MC4r9GJ3GC
No sunsets like the ones in North Dakota. (Picture by my talented daughter, Ali, who will be embarrassed to read this.) What's the most stunning sunset you've ever seen? 🌅 https://t.co/gJzVSK0F7M
Proud to launch Farmers &amp; Ranchers for Heidi this week! They deserve a champion in the Senate who will fight for a strong Farm Bill, a robust farm safety net &amp; commonsense trade policies that give our producers more markets – not less.
So fun to bump into former Senator Smith tonight! Only thing that beats that is @UofNorthDakota alum @TJOshie77 scoring the first goal. Extra ND proud tonight (in my @shane_gersich9 jersey!) https://t.co/ODcskYkd8g
99 years ago today, Congress passed the 19th Amendment to give women the right to vote. Cheers to those pioneers who fought for female suffrage — &amp; to anyone else brave enough to fight for what's right. Interested in electing women? Volunteer: https://t.co/rsxzm8asE1 #WomenLead

It's unconscionable to play politics with North Dakota producers' livelihoods — these tariffs on our trading partners should be unacceptable to anyone representing our state. ND cannot afford a trade war. I won't stop speaking out against one.	https://t.co/nrYhm6VtuV
Meet my friend, Bill Hejl. Over the years, he &amp; I have gotten to know each other pretty well. Bill comes from a long line of farmers &amp; he's #HereforHeidi because he knows I’m doing whatever it takes in the Senate to support North Dakota's farmers &amp; ranchers. https://t.co/bn20DvfnI6
#TBT to my days as AG, fighting for what is right against the country's biggest tobacco corporations. I'll never lose that fighting spirit. #WorldNoTobaccoDay https://t.co/fkwxd3svHt
During this #OlderAmericansMonth, it’s important to remember that vital programs like Social Security and Medicare are under threat in Washington. I’m fighting every day to protect the lifesaving benefits that thousands of ND seniors depend on #OAM2018 https://t.co/HL3pDgzIg8
Jeff Kuhn is a rancher from Dickinson and he’s seen firsthand how I’ve reached out to help support ranchers as they fight to overcome severe drought, unstable commodity prices, and unpredictability in trade markets. That’s why he (and his horse, Woody) are #HereforHeidi 🐎 https://t.co/RIlJ2Z9NdX
Thanks, I agree 😉 https://t.co/jsX0TrqK2y
From every corner of North Dakota, farmers &amp; ranchers have warned Washington how damaging a trade war could be. They deserve a U.S. Senator who'll listen. That's why Justin is #HereforHeidi: https://t.co/uaNVhaRWUS

Nothing's more important than making sure our veterans have the care and resources they've earned. That's why I'm proud to have support from folks like Pat. #HereforHeidi https://t.co/Jk56Xj089R
#TBT to launching Students for Heidi with a Saturday canvass — honored to have their support. See why Austin, an @NDSU student, is #HereforHeidi: https://t.co/EKHjyzudWP

Today, Senators from both parties came together and voted to restore #NetNeutrality. It's now up to the House to do the right thing — act to support a free &amp; open internet for North Dakota.
In these divided times, let's come together and agree that both sides are right... just kidding, it's definitely #laurel.
Are you running in the Fargo marathon? 🏃🏃‍♀️We've got a free Heidi shirt with your name on it! Reserve yours right now: https://t.co/uRcyXjfePx	— Team #HH4ND https://t.co/p4XX9RxigZ

This year, Mother's Day is tough. My incredible mom, Doreen, passed a few weeks ago. Today, I want to share this memory with you all: her watching me get sworn in nearly 6 years ago. Nothing feels better than making your mom proud. Happy Mother's Day, mom. Love and miss you. https://t.co/V0PGc1eoWi
Thanks to everyone who came out and marched with my team last night at the Bismarck Band Night Parade! You all looked fantastic in your #HH4ND swag 😉 https://t.co/vwcaPzVnKC

It's true, North Dakota is a real U.S. state here on Earth... it just *seems* like heaven 😉 https://t.co/L7Gyf0ajp8

Today we’re raising awareness about the epidemic of murdered and missing Native women. You are #NotInvisible. I’ll keep fighting for Savanna’s Act and to shed a light on this injustice. Thanks to all who are helping raise awareness today. #MMIW #MMIWG
Students for Heidi launched today with neighborhood canvasses in Fargo, Grand Forks &amp; Bismarck — thank you to all the young folks who spent their Saturday morning knocking on doors. Now get back to studying for finals! #HH4ND https://t.co/voVLrFvWZR
You deserve a Senator who will roll up her sleeves, reach across the aisle, &amp; work on common-sense solutions. I’m focused on strengthening Medicare, protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions and bringing down the cost of care — not just scoring political points. #AHCA https://t.co/jPWzSr5lqR
I won’t be a rubber stamp for either party — that’s why I couldn’t support the reckless health care plan that would have raised premiums, left thousands of North Dakotans without health insurance &amp; weakened Medicare for seniors. #AHCA https://t.co/L1WnnWC1VT
Looking great, Tracie! For anyone jealous of your #HH4ND campaign gear... https://t.co/clDDr1rQLr 😉 #NDPol #NDSen https://t.co/NTwpLBumsT

As a mom, a cancer survivor and a senator, I understand how critical health care is. I'll never turn my back on folks like Mary and her family, or stop fighting for folks with preexisting conditions. https://t.co/khll5AtePz
April is #NationalCancerControlMonth, and, as a cancer survivor, it's personal for me. While we search for a cure, every cancer patient deserves to have access to the affordable, quality health care they need.
I'm fighting for #NetNeutrality because every North Dakotan deserves access to a free &amp; open internet. Join me if you agree → https://t.co/J2FFiMFTiN https://t.co/64JV5KqZr1

I've heard from a heck of a lot of North Dakotans who are concerned about the president's tariffs. Farmers &amp; factory workers deserve a U.S. Senator who'll stand up for them when it matters, because this isn't a partisan issue — this is about their economic survival.

First Lady Barbara Bush was tough as nails and an exceptional American — she inspired so many women across our country and here in North Dakota. Praying for the Bush family tonight. #RIP https://t.co/zjNhnHRYte
On #TaxDay, North Dakotans are stuck w/ a partisan bill that will add nearly $2 trillion to the national debt, raise health care premiums for families &amp; open the door to devastating Medicare &amp; Social Security cuts. RT if you agree — North Dakota deserves better! https://t.co/buw5HdHxTI
I believe in permanent, middle-class tax cuts for hardworking North Dakota families. But instead, Mitch McConnell rammed through a partisan bill that doesn't give folks the permanent tax relief they deserve. #TaxDay
I've worked long &amp; hard to level the playing-field for mom &amp; pop shops on Main Street. Today, #SCOTUS hears arguments in #SDvWayfair — a case I pushed for as ND's tax commissioner &amp; AG. No longer have the perm, but I'm still fighting for ND's #smallbiz. https://t.co/1MQtRXQRSM https://t.co/UYGw5cLN4C
More than 1/3 of #smallbiz owners say tariffs would hurt their business. I'll never stop advocating for small businesses — which make up more than 95% of ND's economy — when their bottom line is threatened by the administration’s reckless tariff policies. https://t.co/eq87Fzxvr7
Agriculture is the heart &amp; soul of ND’s economy. An unnecessary, reckless trade war threatens the livelihood of our farmers &amp; ranchers. I’ll continue fighting for a smart, sensible trade policy that supports our economy &amp; holds China accountable. Read more in the @gfherald: https://t.co/BnddYg9PN6
Using poisoned, dead Syrian children in a political attack ad is disgusting, shameful and downright wrong. North Dakotans expect better. Congressman Cramer should condemn this ad and ask that it be taken down. https://t.co/sERWTZUPfh
Thanks, POTUS, for signing my bill to crack down on websites like Backpage. This is a win for strong, safe North Dakota communities. I'll keep working across the aisle to put an end to the trafficking of women &amp; children. https://t.co/jmBfWs9Kfu

I'm not *actually* a unicorn but there aren't a whole lot of folks left in Congress who are willing to reach across the aisle and put partisanship aside. So it does stand out, along with the red hair! Hope it was an informative class. https://t.co/rfPFH5xYxJ
Every year, the average North Dakota woman loses $15,000 to the wage gap. That's just not right. RT if you support the Paycheck Fairness Act! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/mD11e8luNX
The legitimate concerns farmers &amp; ranchers have about the tariffs isn't "hysteria." North Dakota deserves a senator who'll listen to their concerns &amp; go to bat for them when their livelihood is on the line. https://t.co/EOuMA3u4P0
Proud of our work across the aisle to crack down on Backpage &amp; those who facilitate human trafficking online. This is a big step, but there's more work to do to make sure North Dakota communities are strong &amp; safe for the future. https://t.co/I98d0IJNW9
#FBF: Small businesses are the backbone of ND communities, but finding investors &amp; loans is hard for entrepreneurs in rural areas. That's why I drafted the SEED Act — a federal grant program for start-ups in small cities &amp; towns to kick-start their success https://t.co/zXtzOA7RIB
Had a great time at our Power of the Purse event in Bismarck last night! I'm lucky to have the support of these pretty incredible women — hearing their ideas for the future of our state gets me fired up. #WomenLead #GirlPower https://t.co/AiicXvnkbv
So proud of all we've accomplished with the FUTURE Act, which expands carbon capture tax credits, proving that we don't have to choose between a secure energy economy and a clean environment for our kids. https://t.co/TaNrDkjrnq
In the Senate, I'll keep fighting for the values Dr. King so eloquently shared with us — that any North Dakotan who works hard deserves the dignity of good pay, a safe workplace &amp; a secure retirement. #MLK50 https://t.co/nINv1mFmTB
50 years ago today, we lost a champion for equality &amp; also a champion for working men and women. I've always been inspired by Dr. King's passionate fight on behalf of sanitation workers in Memphis because he knew they deserved fair pay &amp; safe working conditions. #MLK50
We had a great crowd for politics and pasta in Fargo last night. Thanks to everyone who came to show their support — especially the adorable kiddos!  #NDPol #HH4ND https://t.co/dowpTpw6Aq
Folks like Donna &amp; her husband, Mike, inspire me every single day to protect the pensions North Dakotans earned. We made a promise to those who worked hard &amp; played by the rules — I'll fight to keep that promise to North Dakota workers &amp; retirees. #CentralStates https://t.co/RxGvx2DPOO
Dana shared with me the photo I took with his dad in 2015. Dana, thank you for sharing your father with us, talking about his service and his memory. I have no doubt Arlyn was a very proud father.

We need an all-of-the-above energy strategy &amp; biofuels are a critical part of that. But the administration's actions could undermine North Dakota farmers &amp; our renewable energy industry. Read more from @Wahpeton→ https://t.co/gf8o1rmyDq https://t.co/rY6BkNM9MV

Veterans like Tom are the folks who truly make America the greatest nation on Earth. For National #VietnamWarVeteransDay, I hope you'll join me &amp; take a moment to remember our veterans &amp; the 198 North Dakotans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/1BjUf15pn7
North Dakota deserves a senator who'll work to find common ground on health care—but will also fight back against bills that throw families off their insurance, weaken Medicare &amp; undermine protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions like cancer. https://t.co/3Z959dddoO
Since day one, I've put North Dakota first. Every day. And I'll never lose sight of that mission as your U.S. Senator. #NDSen #NDPol
But I didn't go to Washington to be a rubber-stamp for either party — I won't support a health care plan that rips away insurance &amp; allows discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions like cancer or asthma.
Just recently, the Senate passed my common-sense reforms to #DoddFrank that will bring relief to credit unions &amp; community lenders in ND &amp; rural America. "Too big to fail" shouldn't mean "too small to succeed." #Relief4MainStreet
I worked with my Republican colleague from Alaska to lift the decades-old ban on crude oil exports &amp; now, our energy economy is thriving. President Trump also signed into law my bill to help pave a viable path forward for coal &amp; to protect the environment for future generations.
Like VP Pence championed in his speech, I voted against WOTUS, supported Keystone, for Justice Gorsuch and to adequately fund our troops in harm's way.
VP Mike Pence might think he knows North Dakotans, but I was born in a small North Dakota town with fewer than 100 people. I've listened to folks from every corner of our state. Here's how I've put North Dakota first every single day:
Their bill is full of loopholes for real estate moguls, private jet companies &amp; job outsourcers because it was hastily crafted and recklessly pushed through Congress. https://t.co/r7mt9LoYyY
I voted against the Washington Republican tax bill because it's charging nearly $1.5 trillion on a credit card account to our children &amp; grandchildren without a plan to pay for it.
American families deserve a tax cut. And I pushed for a bipartisan, responsible bill that as a whole was good for North Dakotans. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen with the Republican tax bill.
I was honored to be called one of the most effective Senators by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, but the highest honor is earning the praise of fellow North Dakotans. I'll never stop fighting for real results for our state. https://t.co/O9GbudXCVC https://t.co/JgTeYtB6u0
Public service is about reaching across the aisle and getting things done for North Dakotans — that's always what I've done when it comes to health care. Mary, &amp; folks like her across our state, will always be my priority. https://t.co/uwJjwJUBIG

We’ve accomplished so much by putting aside our differences &amp; working together	✔lifted the oil export ban	✔cracked down on human trafficking	✔protected seniors &amp; NDans w/pre-existing conditions	✔passed a Farm Bill w/strong protections for our producers
Not many members of Congress come from where I do — a small town w/fewer than 100 people — &amp; it shapes every decision I make. My goal has always been to stand up &amp; fight for folks in small towns across ND — because our communities should be strong &amp; safe for the next generation.
Thank you to the delegates &amp; to every North Dakotan who believes in our shared vision for a North Dakota where all can prosper — the rancher in Towner, the pensioner in Bismarck, the college student in Grand Forks &amp; the single mom in Fargo.
Every day, I feel honored to be your senator. Today, I’m humbled to once again receive your nomination to represent North Dakota the U.S. Senate.
In 2012, you gave me the nomination here in the Alerus Center — &amp; we won. We won because you stood by me, working hard along side me, pulling me forward. Today, I’m again asking for your support so we can win. So we can fight for #NorthDakota’s future together. https://t.co/t2p8ZLhP2q

Yesterday, I stood w/ North Dakotans to speak out about the need for bipartisan, REAL #TaxReform—not just tax breaks for millionaires and campaign contributors. Watch more on @WDAYnews: https://t.co/2Ri3GFJNmd
As a former Tax Commissioner, I know what a good #TaxReform bill should look like. It should be bipartisan, fiscally responsible &amp; give relief to workers &amp; middle-class families—not just millionaires &amp; corporations. https://t.co/B8Ckg84e5p
79 days ago, Paul Ryan &amp; Mitch McConnell let #CHIP expire—instead, they're ramming through tax cuts for millionaires and gambling with the health care of 9 million American children. This isn't the right way to govern! https://t.co/2d8BREpeRw
Farmers and ranchers deserve REAL #TaxReform—but the GOP bill opens the door to devastating cuts to #Medicare and our farm safety net in exchange for massive tax breaks for millionaires. Read Derek's letter to the @inforum here: https://t.co/ftVdrPxAlL https://t.co/gthfvZv1Y0
North Dakotans want bipartisan solutions to bring down the cost of health care. Read more in the @Wahpeton Daily News to see why I'm fighting against the Health Insurance Tax, which would hurt seniors, families &amp;  small business owners. #StopTheHIT https://t.co/BgE7jl1QBr

Thanks for speaking up, Leah. It's folks like you who will make a difference on #NetNeutrality. Be heard! https://t.co/EjBXlilAEL
You're absolutely right. #NetNeutrality is an important issue for kids and schools, too. Especially in rural America. https://t.co/rsaYb66zOo
In North Dakota, small businesses account for about 95% of employers. We need tax reform that gives them the certainty they need to expand, create jobs &amp; raise wages for hardworking North Dakotans trying to make ends meet.
It's simple—the Senate Republican tax bill gives permanent tax cuts to large corporations, but only temporary relief for #smallbiz. https://t.co/BxsSzMlWyK
BREAKING: The FCC just decided to sell the internet to the highest bidder. This is a bad deal for #smallbiz, entrepreneurs, consumers, schools &amp; rural America as a whole. RT if you support a free and open internet! #NetNeutrality https://t.co/RoBYG1FMt2
Between the drought &amp; low commodity prices, ND farmers &amp; ranchers are facing tough times right now. They deserve REAL #TaxReform that helps them compete—not tax cuts for millionaires paid for by cuts to #Medicare and the farm safety net. https://t.co/UJ2TkvQ5x4
Grand Forks native Mary Wakefield, who served as Deputy Secretary for Health and Human Services, knows health care better than anybody, and she has a message for North Dakotans—time is running out to #GetCovered! #OpenEnrollment https://t.co/Kz7WbQIxG3
A lot of folks are concerned with the proposed #NetNeutrality rollback and I am, too. This will hurt #smallbiz, entrepreneurs and rural America as a whole. I've voiced my strong concerns with the FCC &amp; will keep fighting to level the online playing field for all NDans.
The GOP bill raises taxes on middle-class families, adds more than $1 trillion to the national debt &amp; cuts Medicare for seniors—all while giving big tax breaks to millionaires. There's no doubt we need #TaxReform—but I'm certain this isn't the right bill for North Dakota. https://t.co/m5efUU0gae
Like Senator Dorgan said, tax reform should be bipartisan, fiscally responsible &amp; help middle-class families get ahead. Read more of his column in the @inforum: https://t.co/nUdrbJOYgv
Their bill borrows more than $1 trillion from the next generation to give big tax breaks to millionaires &amp; corporations, while many middle-class North Dakotans will see a tax hike.
Having seen the tax code up close, we both also know how desperately we need to reform it to level the playing field for middle-class North Dakotans. But that's not what the Republican bill does.
My friend, former Senator Byron Dorgan, and I have quite a few things in common—one being that we both previously served as North Dakota's Tax Commissioner.
We need to reform the outdated tax code. But there's a reason @AARPadvocates doesn't support the GOP tax plan—because Washington Republicans cut billions from #Medicare to pay for their tax cuts for millionaires and corporations. https://t.co/5AApJVT903
In North Dakota, 96% of firefighters are volunteers—but fire chiefs in rural areas are struggling to recruit new firefighters. Watch this @KFYRTV story on my efforts to give rural firefighters access to affordable housing &amp; student loan forgiveness. https://t.co/RECmY5YlIA

Former Senator &amp; ND Tax Commissioner Byron Dorgan has a good point—we need #TaxReform, but shouldn't borrow more than $1 trillion from the next generation to give tax breaks to millionaires while ND's middle-class farmers, workers &amp; families lose. https://t.co/fPdmghpU3c
While there's no doubt we need to reform the tax code, we should do it in a way that helps our farmers and ranchers succeed. https://t.co/mKP8SFHYWI
I support reforming our tax code. But by giving tax breaks to millionaires &amp; putting more than $1 trillion on our nation's credit card, the GOP tax bill could result in billions of automatic cuts from Medicare, the Farm Bill &amp; Meals on Wheels. https://t.co/RLzys4215S
#TBT: After serving as ND's Tax Commissioner, I know a bad deal when I see one. The GOP tax plan is a bad deal for ND taxpayers—middle-class families will see their tax bill go up while millionaires and corporations get permanent tax breaks. https://t.co/zFkvKWy1F3

North Dakotans deserve REAL #TaxReform. But the GOP bill adds &gt; $1 trillion to the national debt, cuts #Medicare &amp; raises health care costs—all while giving hardworking, middle-class folks a tax hike.

It's simple—#ExIm helped our economy grow. We cannot let Scott Garrett continue hurting ND workers &amp; #smallbiz as head of the #ExIm Bank.
Killdeer Mountain's VP joined me at the hearing &amp; explained how #ExIm has helped rural, family-owned ND companies compete across the globe.
#ExIm helped Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing—a 3rd generation, family-owned shop—expand, boost sales &amp; employ 350 folks in western ND. https://t.co/ZO56krHLXq
It operates at no cost to ND taxpayers—and in recent years, the #ExIm Bank has supported more than 600 good-paying jobs across our state.
The #ExIm Bank has helped ND businesses create jobs &amp; hire more American workers, incl. $42 million in exports from ND in the last 6 years.
As a Congressman, Garrett crippled #ExIm from helping ND manufacturers, workers &amp; #smallbiz. I asked him to apologize to them &amp; he refused.
