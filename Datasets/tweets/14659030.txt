How to make foreign policy a priority ‚Äî and accessible ‚Äî for US voters? Make foreign policy less foreign by discussing the ways foreign policies apply to their daily lives @madeleine
Every US presidential candidate bashes China on the campaign trail and once they become president they all strive for closer ties with China. @madeleine
Zbigniew Brzezinski knew too much to expect perfection from democracy, but he cared too much to accept the world as it was. @madeleine
Power must be guided by principle. When the US acts on our commitment to freedom we differentiate ourselves from our competitors and adversaries. @madeleine
An honor to welcome @madeleine Albright for a special event honoring the legacy of Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former Professor of American Foreign Policy and @FPI_SAIS Senior Fellow at Johns Hopkins SAIS. https://t.co/3vY6GjrBMH
Amb. Mark Brzezinksi: Zbig brought to his statecraft the perspective and experience as an immigrant to the US fleeing autocracy, perspective he shared with @madeleine Albright
Zbig never put himself in one camp or the other between realist or idealist foreign policy. He thought good policy should belong to both. @madeleine
Zbig was an outstanding professor but an even more remarkable boss, because we were not his staff, we were colleagues. We all contributed and didn‚Äôt have to stay in our lane. @madeleine
Amb. Mark Brzezinski: My father loved that @madeleine Albright was an outspoken Secretary of State during a time it  was important for the US to have such a person in leadership
Zbigniew Brzezinksi did more than anyone apart from my father to prepare me for my foreign policy career. @madeleine

Be like the first responders who run toward the disaster rather than away from it. Find a way to make a difference today, in 2018, in 2020 and beyond. #SAISGrad18
Flournoy concludes with a call to action: In these challenging times, your service and commitment are more important than ever. I urge you to step up; don‚Äôt opt out. #SAISGrad18
(10) ‚ÄúYou can have it all, but not at the same time.‚Äù These were the wise words of a professional woman of my mother‚Äôs generation when I was trying to figure out how to juggle my career in the Pentagon and start a family. -Flournoy #SAISGrad18
(9) Be willing to take risk to pursue your dreams; if you can‚Äôt find the right opportunity, create it. Some of the most rewarding professional experiences I‚Äôve had started with people I respected telling me I was crazy to make a change. -Flournoy #SAISGrad18
(8) Never stop learning and growing in your life of service. If a job is no longer challenging you, if you no longer feel you are learning or growing, it may be time for a change. -Flournoy SAISGrad18
(7) Be a mentor. One of the most sure-fire ways to make a difference and have an enduring impact in your field is to mentor others. -Flournoy #SAISGrad18
‚Äì one that is diverse in gender, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, and in experience and perspective. -Flournoy #SAISGrad18
(6) Be an inclusive, empowering leader. When it comes to safeguarding national security in our democracy, I believe we need a national security cadre that looks like America...
(5) Be yourself as a leader ‚Äì authenticity is the coin of the realm. The most important aspect of being an effective leader is being yourself. People smell inauthenticity a mile away, and it is deadly. -Flournoy #SAISgrad18
(4) Go to the pain, and be willing to speak truth to power. Some of the most rewarding professional experiences I‚Äôve had have come from the times when I have been willing to take the harder, riskier road. - Flournoy #SAISGrad18
(3) Choose the boss, not the job. Choose a boss who will invest in your professional development, who will give you increasing levels of responsibility, who will be a true mentor and champion. - Flournoy #SAISGrad18
(2) Go after your weaknesses; don‚Äôt just play to your strengths. Now is a good time to undertake an honest self-assessment of your strengths and weaknesses, and to address any areas that could prevent you from reaching your full potential. - Flournoy #SAISGrad18
Flournoy shares 10 lessons she has learned throughout her career: (1) Find a ‚Äúmission that matters‚Äù and pursue it with passion. #SAISGrad18
Flournoy's advice to graduates: When service in the current administration or in your home countries may or may not be possible for many of you, I would encourage you to think about service differently ‚Äì not as a particular job or opportunity, but as a life-long purpose.
We are excited to welcome former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Mich√®le Flournoy, as this year's commencement speaker! #SAISGrad18 https://t.co/f33KzPgdA9
