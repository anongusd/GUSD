@dcforkner And not quite. I am more saying that you win more with honey than vinegar. Especially when dealing with allies. However, bullying can work in some cases.
@dcforkner Yes, but for other reasons. We need Russia on our side to confront a rising China down the road. If we don't try to bring them back into the fold, that will never be possible. We need to stop antagonizing a declining power instead of working together with them on common goals.
#NorthKoreaSummit #TrumpKimSummit #KimJongUn #Korea #InternationalRelations #NorthKorea #Singapore #analysis
Likewise, he must come in willing to leave without anything. Negotiations can take many years on complex issues. Trump shouldn't expect anything major from this first meeting. In closing, his unorthodox approach could be useful to make a breakthrough that wasn't previously doable
Inspired by @Robert_E_Kelly's excellent analysis, here is my own take on the NK summit. @realDonaldTrump's disregard for preparation is stunning. Even reading a survey of the Korean history like Bruce Cumings's excellent Korea's Place in the Sun would be greatly helpful.
