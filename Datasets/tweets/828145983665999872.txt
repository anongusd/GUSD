@menjicm @Saintsfan5348 @docrocktex26 @DNC You really want him to run as an independent? If he runs as an independent he's virtually guaranteed to be on the general ticket... Smarter to have him run as a Dem and may the best candidate win in the Primary.
@Saintsfan5348 @docrocktex26 @DNC Also, the Dem party is in control of the House and refuses to pass impeachment proceedings to the Senate to remove a demonstrable criminal from the white house...  Talk to me about "all I need to know"?
@Saintsfan5348 @docrocktex26 @DNC If he's unpopular, then the Democratic party has nothing to fear from him running, correct?  I'm not a diehard supporter of anyone, and I don't blindly support party over country. I ask the Dem party: show me a truly progressive candidate I can feel good about voting for.
@LRB1114 @HoarseWisperer Agreed. If the Dem cheerleaders spent half as much energy developing/promoting/supporting truly progressive candidates as they do denigrating @SenSanders the world would be a better place.

If the Dems would get their act together and field actual progressive candidates who represent the will of the people, they wouldn't be reduced to demonizing people like Sanders for "stealing" their votes.
@ClydeHaberman @matthewjdowd Democrats need to recognize that Sen. Sanders is hugely popular for a reason. They need to stop sniveling about him not being a Dem, stop thinking they have any right to tell him to sit down and shut up, and start actually listening to what people want from their government.
@mmpadellan Maybe he'll OD this time.
@RepSwalwell @staceyabrams I'll listen respectfully to BOTH of them. We need MORE progressive voices speaking up against the destructive Republican agenda, not fewer. ALL our representatives should be responding to the #criminal POTUS. If the Dems want to win the election, they better start acting like it.
@ProudResister @BernieSanders @staceyabrams The "divisiveness" does not originate with Senator Sanders, it originates with those who refuse to accept what Senator Sanders brings to the conversation and include it in the Democratic platform.

@altNOAA @captinc @RepPaulTonko @RepBonamici @NWS This exchange just demonstrates how utterly ignorant most Americans are regarding even the very most basics aspects of what, how, or why our government does what it does, and how its services positively affect virtually every single aspect of our lives, all day, every single day.
@RepCummings Congressman, when can we expect to see #Impeachment to remove the #criminal @POTUS from our White House??
@ChrisMurphyCT Here's another fact: the @POTUS is a #criminal.   So the question is: Why is Congress not undertaking aggressive #impeachment action?  Senator, WHY NOT??
@HamillHimself #Hamill2020
@tedlieu Yeah, Ted, we know.  So, when can we expect to see #Impeachment proceedings??
@K_JeanPierre ...And after the veterinarians put him down, because he attacked a few hundred million people and was subsequently found to be rabid, she'll still need to spend years cleaning up his mess.

@MajBenTallmadge @realDonaldTrump @GenBenArnold I'd rather spend energy trying, convicting, and executing the #treasonous #traitor at hand than make frivolous comparisons to traitors of the past.

@BetteMidler Having a family history of racketeering, Russian money laundering, and/or miscellaneous scams / grift would seem to be a prerequisite as well.
@TheDweck That's disgusting.
@senatemajldr Oh no. No plea deals for you assholes. We want to see you stand trial.
@StephenAtHome @iamcardib The Democrats response to the @POTUS SOTU should read: "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you...." #ImpeachTrumpNow

@4edges @QuanahChaney @DavidLaufmanLaw Treason is not limited to rendering aid to an enemy during times of war. Example: a traitorous act such as disclosing secrets critical to U.S. security to a foreign nation may be defined as the high crime of #treason against the United States, and "waging war against them".

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He's NOT (successfully) hiding anything. He's an open book to anyone willing  to pay attention. He's a pathological narcissist, pathological liar, self serving con artist. Worse, he's a symptom of the #treasonous  corruption of the @GOP.  When will people wake up, and rise up?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump C'mon, Ted. You propose that his staff are just now figuring out maybe he's been compromised by the Russians, but that they've still not figured out that he doesn't read a damn thing they put in front of him, whether it's in ALL CAPS, or not? That doesn't square.
@AutoMATTic299 @RadioFreeTom I think calling him an "operative" is giving him waaaay too much credit. He's a pathological narcissist, a pathological liar, and a life long self serving con artist. He's likely also now a #treasonous Russian tool, but I don't think he's smart enough to be called an "operative".
@RadioFreeTom @POTUS 45 is a #treasonous #traitor. If you define WH staff members opting not to be fully #complicit as a "breach of trust", well....  All I can say is congratulations on being able to predict that your opinion is not going to be popular. Give yourself a pat on the back.
#stinkyzinke https://t.co/B4ktNtBW01
@ProudResister You smell #treason? Ha! It's hard not to smell anything but treason, given that we've been up to our necks in it for over a year. The American people need to decide if they're going to rise up and do something about it, or drown in it. In the end, we get the government we deserve
