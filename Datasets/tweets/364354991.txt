@realDonaldTrump You should take take notes from the 1st Lady.
@rudepundit Melania isn't Trump. But she's got to go to Michelle Obama, apologize to Obama's/birther, ask for mentoring &amp; guidance now. To get an effective message out, that is 1 of her own, w/guidance, support &amp; partnership of M. Obama. Ask MO to be an advisor? Imagine the possibilities?
@Smartiecats @rudepundit Originality &amp; plagerism are 2 things I take srsly. That said, we've known that Melania's a fan of Michelle's. Since MO's  speech used by MT from what feels like 8 yrs ago. She obviously admires Michelle a lot, Role model-esque; Thinks highly &amp; is inspired by her. How can you not?

@sailingranger IDK.  I just swiped &amp; reopened Twitter.  Maybe it was locked up b/c it was opened for so long?
@sailingranger And everyone is taxed when they die. All Americans payback death tax.  Or their kids do.
@sailingranger I know the death tax. There's a policy for that.  And it'll come back. Death &amp; taxes.  And if you live TOO long, per Fed Govt criteria, you're fiscally dead at 93. Tax &amp; popped w/ a penalty fee if your savings has sustained you &amp; you haven't pulled your SS.
@sailingranger ... but you have to save yourself.  Not the patients, the stress of pulling down $, constant job instability, I became a workaholic &amp; I didn't realize I had to get out before I let it ruin friendships, self esteem, relationships. 	Anyways, the medical community's full on brink.
@sailingranger I'm a bit cynical, but I also am I realist. Sucked 5 yes of happiness from my life just b/c the human brain &amp; behaviour are 2 of my fav things &amp; it was 1 of few things I can say, yeah, I'm really good @ that. Diagnosing &amp; handling difficult/ most consider disturbing things. But
@sailingranger If you think it's bad now?  Brace yourself.  Not sure your provider or out of pocket.  Plan ahead.  Why I saved myself &amp; went into insurance.
@sailingranger And yeah.  Never have been on any federal government funding.  	.	Blown STAT.  Used for whoever's agenda.  CHIP?  Yeah.  Same funding and same standard federal government "service"	Not my problem anymore. It's going to get worse.
@sailingranger I realized I have no control whatsoever over the Federal Govt.  I don't.  And I suffered over the last decade. Believe you me. Paid taxes.  	So I went into insurance.
@sailingranger Warden's don't like being mental health asylums or clinicians. B/c they aren't. They can't do their job &amp; consistently run out of spending your sufferance tax $
@sailingranger Yeah.They don't break it down for you like I can. I worked, paid taxes &amp; lowered yours. Also made police available to do their job instead of being mental health clinics, ER stays of 1 yr, you paid, can't get a bed if sick? You're being charged to wait. You pay 4 incarceration.
@sailingranger &amp; I was on a psychiatric med treatment team, led by Psych MD. I loved the most severe mentally ill. But no one see's them. Except tkg your ER bed b/c the fed govt has cut funding for teams like mine who stabilize/manage the sev ill &amp; psychotic thus prevent tax $ on police &amp; ER.
@sailingranger The Federal govt is why I trashed my degree.The Fed's cut my funding starting in 2011/Obama &amp; has plummeted thru present. burnout that caused me to have an episode of depression/ boyfriend broke up w/me/ very low point b/c slowly i couldn't get hours approved.
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP And sadly ISIS/Daesh is actually regrouping in Iraq.  Low profile areas. Mosul ... IDK. 	But I've heard.  Family. 1 news outlet touched on it abt a month ago.  Can't remember which.
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP Me too. I truly believe he didn't realize the depth, breadth &amp; just how difficult, different, character rquired in spcific situations, mral responsibility, respect for other's &amp; how sris the job of President is. I can't believe I'm even saying that. It's the last fkn job I'd want
@sailingranger Awwwwwe.  Thanks.  I really don't realize I what I know until it comes up in conversation. It's my life. I  should've gotten my masters in Mid- East Relations. Never too late.  Threw my Masters in Social Work away (psychiatric/not baby snatchers saving the world)
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP .. &amp; Trump isn't equipped. Def not putting his 39 yr old, American- Jewish son-in-law in charge of peace? In Arab countries? Not well received or received @ all.  	We can't solve their probs. He really needs to stay away, &amp; let Tillerson do his job. Tillerson's good.
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP ..Mid-East relations &amp; cultures &amp; governing/regime, need for what most see as evil, but tyrants that ruled by an iron fist &amp; horrible human beings are needed as that's the only way many countries function best. Not US best, but peace is not https://t.co/VUByQcR4kB's managed...
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP I'm an Independent, but I will be quite transparent per his Mid-East foreign relations. He &amp; admin have increased tensions, divided in turn causing bloodshed I see but will never be covered by our media. He failed miserably, no success as claimed. Netenyahu is despised. Mid-East.
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP Go you! Beautiful country! Exactly.  Democracy's don't square in Arab nations.Not all.Kuwait's super legit.  Most like America IMO. Def the safest country. Safer than most of US. Economy is thriving, family business &amp; my cousin became the 2nd female, comm pilot in Kuwait history.
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP My cousin Tamara is to my left, your right in black hoodie. Beirut's nightlife is fun as hell.  Those are her friends. Not what media or the US govt want you to see. Fkn Daesh, Mosul, 2 gas attacks over &amp; over. Netenyahu &amp; Trump. I get sick. Arabs? We're "beneath"them. Fine by me https://t.co/cdzHBKL0dN
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP My cousin's. Beirut. I have a different concept of the Middle East &amp; unrest is always somewhere. Always will but media shows Mosul &amp; Syria. I find what often needs coverage, isn't reported &amp; what is  isolated, the worst, ie Syria &amp; DC/press' political agenda hyped &amp; very skewed. https://t.co/hXNF3ABy5Q
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP That's my mom &amp; dad at dinner in Beirut one night. Majority of of people here don't realize Arabs come in different shades &amp; have have blue eyes. Lebanon is a commonwealth of France. My family spk French too. I don't. It's pretty European on the Mediterranean. https://t.co/MLyBQm6Ebf
@sailingranger @Tweet4409 @AP Sure. But Beirut's pretty amzng. 	I spent last Spring w/my family in Beirut &amp; K-City. 	My dad mved back  when oil was discovered. Grandfthr joined family co. My dad's 1st memory here was his freshman year @ the University of South Carolina, mid-60s. Met my mom, Southern proper.
