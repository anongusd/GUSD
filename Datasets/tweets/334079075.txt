Overlooked, but significant at yesterday's hearing, Cummings opened the door to questions to Cohen about Russia after saying "we understand these are topics that do not raise concerns of DOJ"-- i.e. Mueller.
@EJDionne Except it’s Schiff who is holding a behind closed door hearing tomorrow!
Cohen gave damning evidence about Trump Tower Moscow, hush $ payoffs to women, WikiLeaks and fraud by the Trump Foundation. But there were gaps in his testimony that might provide just enough wiggle room for Trump's lawyers. https://t.co/U1ZavNbVS3
Finally, we get the answer: "I've never been to Prague. I've never been to the Czech Republic." Final word on one of the more sensational allegations in the Steele dossier.
Significant: Cohen says he briefed Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka about Moscow project. And, "after  each communication" about project, "I would report back" to Trump.
"Shame on you, Mr. Jordan."
worth noting that Mueller did not accuse Stone of talking to Assange. https://t.co/Z24gashelg
Cummings building legal case against Trump over omissions of debt to Cohen on his financial disclosure.
And all his tax refunds! https://t.co/4iPTSdcvFT
"The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity."
the optics of Lanny Davis sitting behind Cohen are not great.
Significant: Contrary to multiple reports, Cummings makes clear that Mueller does NOT object to Cohen testifying about Russia and questions about Russia are on the table. (Makes it harder for @RepAdamSchiff to justify holding tomorrow's hearing behind closed doors.)
Rahr, the fake bidder for the portrait, per Cohen, was memorably profiled here. 	https://t.co/dE6yOPOCyf
The "fake bidder" referred to in Cohen's testimony-- who bought the Trump portrait &amp; was reimbursed with Trump Foundation funds-- was Trump buddy and playboy Stewart Rahr.  https://t.co/5v4SnKy7iZ (1)
Mueller never charged Stone with talking directly to Assange. He accused him of going thru cut-outs (Corsi and Credico) to find out what Assange had. (2)
Most potentially explosive part of Cohen prepared testimony is account of Trump putting on speaker in 7/16 while Stone tells him he had just spoken to Assange and Wiki is about to dump emails. Damning if true, but...(1)
Per Cohen, Trump on "at least a half dozen times" during campaign asked him "How's it going in Russia?"-a reference to Moscow project. But contrary to @BuzzFeed, says Trump "did not directly tell me to lie to Congress."
Cohen says Trump got a $10 million IRS tax refund in 2008 &amp; told him he could not believe how stupid the USG  was for giving "someone like him" so much cash back. This appears to be first evidence Trump was refusing to release his returns to cover up refunds.

Amid the flap over witness intimidation, worth remembering that Cohen's testimony is already locked in during 70 hours of interviews with Mueller &amp; SDNY. The USG knows what he's got to say; the only ones who don't are the Congress and the public.
Left unsaid in statement by @RepCummings staffer about Cohen testimony is whether Mueller objects to Cohen answering questions about Russia &amp; other matters "under investigation" or is this all @LannyDavis?
For those wondering if @RepCummings will accept @LannyDavis conditions (no Russia ?s) on Cohen's testimony,  HOC aide emails panel is in "process of consulting w/ OSC about scope of the hearing" but panel "will not inappropriately interfere w/ ongoing criminal investigation.”
This is 1 amazing story: Journalist Peter Shinkle tells @dklaidman and me how he discovered that Eisenhower's first national security advisor who oversaw the drafting of EO 10450 --which led to a purge of gays throughout the govt-- was a closeted gay man himself. @SkullduggeryPod https://t.co/G2KlIDw23y

@MarkSZaidEsq From latest Mueller filing: "defendant Gates continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time."
Important clue here: Given DOJ's reference today to "false and misleading" statements submitted to avoid FARA registration, the Skadden/Craig/Podesta/Mercury matters appear to be among the "several ongoing investigations" that Rich Gates is still cooperating with
The next Manafort shoe drops: Skadden law firm pays $4.6 million fine for  failure to register with DOJ as foreign agent of Yanukovich regime after relying on "false and misleading" statements by lead partner on the account-- a reference to Obama's ex-WH counsel Greg Craig.
Has he been asked? https://t.co/8iohINcL3v
Very soon, the presidential candidates will get a chance to start asking questions!
"That will not happen," Barr says when asked if he would allow Trump's lawyers to "correct" the Mueller report before it's released.
Barr expands: Says David Friedman, U.S. ambassador to Israel, called him about representing Trump and brought him to see POTUS in 6/17. Trump asked him about Mueller and "are you envisioning some role here?" Barr said "right now" he couldn't do it. Trump asked for his phone #.
But DiFi declines to follow up "at this time."
Feinstein raises Yahoo report that Barr talked 2 Trump about representing him in Mueller probe. "I had one conversation with him related to his private representation," said Barr, placing it in 6/17. Did he discus probe with others in WH, he says not "in any particular substance"
Barr: "If a president attempts to intervene in a matter that he has a personal stake in, that should be looked at as a breach of his constitutional duty."
Already differences between Barr and the president. Barr: "I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt." And Sessions "did the right thing recusing himself."

Interesting nugget on p. 52 of House intel report points to pre-campaign contact between Flynn and Amb. Kislyak. Prior to flying to Moscow for RT event in 12/15, Flynn &amp; son met with Kislyak at his residence. Flynn Jr. later emailed thanking him for "very productive" meeting.
And has important details that are not in today's House intel report! https://t.co/m5NxnOy2sG
Stating the obvious: House GOP intel report says charges against Manafort "illustrates the necessity for U.S. presidential campaigns to better investigate individuals who serve in senior positions within the campaign."
House GOP intel report says Trump campaign’s “periodic praise for and communications with Wikileaks- a hostile foreign organization- was highly objectionable and inconsistent with US national security interests.”

Final line from Fitzgerald: "That statement rings true to this day. The President has the right to pardon Mr. Libby and Mr. Libby has been pardoned. But the facts have not changed."
"as well as upon a principle fundamental to preserving our judicial system's independence from politics: that any witness, whatever his political affiliation, ...whether he works in the White House or drives a truck...must tell the truth when he...takes an oath" (4)
More Fitzgerald on Libby (quoting from sentencing memo): "He has shown no regret for his actions, which significantly impeded the investigation. Mr. Libby's prosecution was based not upon politics but upon his own conduct..."
More Fitzgerald (quoting from his sentencing memo): Mr. Libby, a high-ranking public official and experienced lawyer, lied repeatedly and blatantly about matters at the heart of a criminal investigation concerning the disclosure of a covert intelligence officer's identity." (3)
More Fitzgerald: "Mr. Libby, represented by able counsel, received a fair trial before an exacting trial judge and a jury who found the facts clearly established that Libby committed the crimes he was charged with. That was true yesterday. It remains true today." (2)
Pat Fitzgerald, Comey's good friend and special counsel who convicted Libby, issues statement: "Mr. Libby’s conviction was based upon the testimony of multiple witnesses, including the grand jury testimony of Mr. Libby himself, as well as numerous documents" (1)

Reed says Clinton emails were a "cover story" for Trump to fire Comey
Reed quotes Sessions saying Comey "did the right thing" last year-- for the same conduct that Sessions agreed to fire him this year.
Sessions confirms multiple leak probes. "This has alreay resulted in investigations. Some people may find they wish they hadn’t leaked."
Manchin asks if Russian meddling in election ever come up in his talks with Trump during the campaign? “I don’t recall,” says Sessions.
Sessions says he's never received any briefing about Russian cyber attack on U.S. -- seems huge gap in performing his duty as AG.
Sessions acknowledges Pres has not asserted executive privilege, says he's protecting the right of President to do so in future
Sessions changes answer slightly: "I may have had an encounter during the reception" with Russian ambassador at reception but doesn't recall
Sessions: "I'm protecting the president's constitutional right by not giving it away before he has a chance to review it."
"You're impeding this investigation,"Heinrich tells Sessions after he refuses again to answer questions about his talks with @potus
"I'm not sure what was in his mind, explicitly," says Sessions about what Trump was thinking when he fired Comey.
Sessions refuses to answer whether he discussed Russia investigation with Trump.
"Its likely that laws were violated, if that actually occurred," says Sessions, referring to Russian hack of DNC.
Warner says Sessions failure 2 talk 2 Comey about issues @ FBI seems a "little peculiar" in midst of Russia probe &amp; "suddenly" Comey fired
Sessions admits he never talked to Comey about concerns about his performance before he was fired.
"It is longstanding policy for AG not to comment on conversations he's had with the president," says Sessions.
Sessions: "I have confidence in Mr. Mueller."
Sessions punches back: "I recused myself from" Russia probe."I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous allegations"
Sessions defends role in firing of Comey. "the scope of my recusal does not, cannot intefere with my ability to oversee DOJ, including FBI."
Sessions won't talk about his "confidential" talks with @potus, has no "recollection" of talking with Russian amb. at Mayflower Hotel.

Next day, all U.S. attorneys- including @PreetBharara - were asked to resign.
New ?s for Sessions. @PreetBharara says after 3rd call from Trump  "I refused to return" &amp; reported it "to chief of staff of AG."
"it appeared he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship...i’s a very werid and peculiatr thing." @PreetBharara
.@PreetBharara recounts 3 phone calls from Trump, he refused 3rd and reported to DOJ, next day fired.
On @thisweek, @PreetBharara notes Ryan is "in line" to be @POTUS noting there is "absolute" grounds to begin obstruction probe of Trump
As for the tapes, Trump says in round 2-- "you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer."
Trump says "I didn't say that" when asked about Comey's testimony that he asked him to make Flynn case go away. So...what did he say?
Trump wants again teases about tapes. "ill tell you about that sometime in the very near future," he says when asked if they exist.

@RealDonnieBBall I'm just seeing this now . My lawyer will be responding in due course. When are we going to lunch or better yet ballgame?
Senators look very puzzled by McCain's questioning
"Theres no doubt I was fired bec of the Russia investigation...in some way to change the way Russia investigation was being conducted."
Comey: "I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation"
Manchin: "Do you believe this will rise to obstruction of justice?"	Comey: "I dont know. That's Bob Mueller's job."
"I hope there are" tapes, says Comey. "Release all the tapes. Im good with it."
Comey says Lynch directive gave him "queasy feeling" because it tracked the spin being used by Clinton campaign
Comey gives damning account of Lynch directive on HRC probe: "Don’t call it an investigation. She said just call it a matter."
Comey says he has turned all his memos over to Mueller
"It rings in my ear as 'would somebody rid me of this meddlesome priest," says Comey about Trump "hope" that he makes Flynn probe go away
Blunt pushes Comey on why he leaked memo?"As a private citizen, I thought it very important to get that out.I asked my friend" to get it out
Fascinating response on memo: Trump's tweet about tapes prompted Comey to get friend to leak. Another case of how POTUS tweets backfired
Comey acknowledges he asked friend (Columbia law prof) to leak contents of his memo in order to prompt appointment of special counsel
When he showed Trump dossier, Comey was worried about "being in a J. Edgar Hoover situation"  that he was showing it "to hang it over him"
More problems for Sessions?"We were aware of facts I cant discuss in open setting that wd make" his involvement in probe "problematic.'
Comey says Trump was worried about deputy McCabe bec wife got campaign money from Clinton friend McAuliffe."How was he going to be on me?"
Comey's statement that he took Trump comment on Flynn as "direction" is now the lede.
"He was asking for something and I refused to give it."
"I took it as a direction.I took it as, this is what he wants me to do" says Comey about Trump's comment he "hoped" he would let Flynn go
Comey: "The reason Congress created a 10 year term so there would be no 'political loyalty' test"
Right after inauguration, Comey says Trump whispered in his ear "Im looking forward to working with you"
Comey says 1 top FBI official disagreed with assuring Trump he was not under investigation Bec the probe involved Trump campaign
"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting," says Comey, asked why he wrote memo after meeting with Trump
Comey says ex-AG Lynch's conduct led him to go public on HRC probe. She directed him not to call it "investigation" but a "matter."
Comey declines to answer questions re: Steele dossier &amp; whether it had evidence of criminality, says that goes to "details of investigation"
"General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy. There was an open FBI  investigation" when Trump made request to let him go
"Those were lies, plain and simple," Comey says about administration claims he was fired because the FBI was in disarray.

Question for the day: How different Is a "cloud" over the presidency from a "cancer on the presidency"?
Kicker: Comey is fired one month later. 12)
Comey tells Trump not a good idea, he should have WH counsel call DOJ leadership. 11)
Comey replies he passed request to Boente, but had not heard back. Trump says he'll have "his people" call Boente. 10)
Trump calls again 4/11 &amp; asks "what I had done about his request that I 'get out' that he is not personally under investigation." 9)
Comey then calls acting DAG Boente to report POTUS request and says "I would await his guidance." Boente doesn't call back. 8)
Trump repeats that he hopes Comey can "find a way to get out" that he's not being investigated. "I told him I would see what we could do" 7)
Trump then returns to "cloud" of Russia probe "that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country." 6)
Trump then brings up "the McCabe thing," referring to $ for McCabe's wife in Va. race from Gov. McAuliffe , friend of Clinton's (5)
Trump then says 2 Comey: "We need to get that fact out." Adds: "If 'satellite' associates did something wrong wd be good to find out." 4)
Comey said he had already told Congress that "we were not personally investigating President Trump." 3)
But Russia probe was a "cloud" impairing his ability to act on behalf of country. Trump asked "what we could do to 'lift the cloud" 2)
Whats new in Comey: In 3/30 phone call, Trump called and told him he "had not been involved with hookers in Russia." 1)

Citing examples of Russian "active measures," Brennan mentions use of "blackmail, kompromot" to "leverage for their own purposes."
Brennan says Russians may have held back info on HRC and "probably husband it for a later day."
Asked whether countries other than Russia tried to influence us, Brennan says he'd like to think about that and discuss in closed session.
Brennan"I have unfortunately grudging respect for Russian intel acivities...They are aggressively trying to evaludate individuals in govt."
More Brennan: "I was concerned because of known Russan efforts to suborn such individuals."
Brennan: "I was aware of intel that revealed contacts &amp; interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in Trump campaign."
Brennan decries leaks about Trump-Lavrov meeting. "These are very damaging leaks. I find it appalling and they  need to be tracked down."
Asked about collusion, Brennan says "I was worrried by a number of contacts that Russians had with US persons" &amp; had "unresolved questions"
Brennan says he warned FSB chief Bortnikov in 8/4 phone call Russian meddling in election was "intolerable" &amp; "needed to stop."

McCabe disputes WH claim Comey had lost confidence of FBI agents. "I can tell you Dir Comey enjoyed broad support within fbi &amp; still does."
In response to Wyden, McCabe pledges to refrain from updating POTUS about Russia investigation. But won't comment on what Comey told Trump.
Trump just said he fired Comey bec "he wasn't doing a good job." Not the reasons spelled out in the Rosenstein memo.
Asked if POTUS requested Rosenstein review of Comey, Pence says: DAG "came to work and made the recommendation" and brought to Trump.
"There's an effort to have (Comey) testify," says Senate intel source.
AG and DAG "are interviewing candidates for interim director today. We expect to name someone within a few days," says DOJ official.

With AG recused, acting DAG Boente, Obama holdover, gave approval to Comey to reveal FBI probe of Trump-Russia ties https://t.co/UQKj48YN79
FBI probe into Trump-Russia ties began late July, weeks after ex-British spy Steele first briefed agents (on July 5) https://t.co/UQKj48YN79
Will be on @chrislhayes at 8 with new details on Comey testimony/fbi probe
Why the delay? "Because of the sensitivity," Comey replies.
Although FBI investigation of Trump-Russia coordination began in late July, Congress leaders weren't briefed "until recently," Comey says.
Comey clarifies: He hates @Patriots because they "represent sustained excellence" and as Giants fan "that drives me crazy."
Comey acknowledges evidence of coordination between Trump campaign and Russia wasnt included in IC assessment bec it was under investigation
Comey just revealed he hated the New England Patriots  @Patriots
"Is he under  investigation now?" Comey: "I'm not going to answer that." " But don't draw any inference from that, he adds.
Rep. Swalwell: “Was Donald Trump under investigation during the campaign?” Comey: “I’m not going to answer that.”
"Mr. Director, are you aware of Felix Sater?"
Comey: The Russians “were unusually loud in their intervention. It was almost as if they didn’t care if we knew.”
"Yes," says Comey when asked if Russia is "our adversary"
Comey has learned his lesson: "I can't commit to updates," he says about Russia probe
Acting deputy AG Dana Boente approved Comey statement about FBI probe of Trump-Russia link, informed source tells Yahoo News
Sewell asks Comey about Yahoo News interview with Flynn
Big point worth pondering: Comey has given grounds for Stone, Page, Flynn, Manafort to take 5th when called to testify to Congress
Revised big headline: FBI investigation of Trump-Russia coordination  began more than 3 months before Election Day
Comey just said FBI has been investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign and Russia since late July.
NSA chief Rogers contradicts Spicer claim that US Intel used Brits to snoop on Trump campaign
Comey: "I have no information that supports those tweets"

Comey: "we need to make sure we don't give other people clues to where we are going."

Here's what Clinton couldn't remember when she was questioned by the FBI https://t.co/AUWDFRMu9w
Expert witness: In her FBI interview, HRC said she "could not recall," "did not recall" and "did not remember" 38 times.
Blumenthal told FBI he thought "Confidential" meant info was "personal in nature" and "did not refer to classified USG information."
Blumenthal sent HRC 179 emails, including 24 containing "confidential" info and one that had "secret" info
p.20: HRC told FBI she didnt know what "C" markings on emails meant, thought it might mean grafs "marked in alphabetical order."
p. 17: Book deal! Huma told FBI archive of HRC emails was created "as a reference for the future production of a book."
p.16 footnote: FBI was unable to get complete list of keywords or names used in email search due to "assertion of privilege" by HRC lawyers.
Clinton told FBI she "did not recall" notice to State employees sent on her behalf urging they not use personal emails for official business
Powell warned HRC in 09 email if it became "public" she was using BB for bus, her emails wd be "official records &amp; subject to the law."
