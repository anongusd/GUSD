If the country won't take to Mr. Trump's oil venture, then we should go electric and hydrogen engines so we're not dependant on another country and making them rich. Put a generator/alternator on each wheel it never runs out of electricity. Patent that for me.

a positive within, 	staying positive is a 	     thought, looking bright	is a thought, exhaling a 	     rush of relief is a thought...Stay positive and	     vote Republican-
there are places,	there are thoughts, there	     are feelings, there are	emotions...What there isn't	     is sadness, there is no	sadness, it's only a	     thought in your mind	maybe a fragile thought,	     yes, although the worst	occurrance can be found
Why, would you be sad	     do you not, live	Are there not friends	     in your life	Isn't your family, a couple	     button pushes away	Sing your favorite song	     to yourself, deliver	a gift you've been wanting	     to give...There are moments, there are times,
https://t.co/WkDAYsnaPH
When you put your, gear	    back on...dream of freedom, dream of liberty,	    dream of Independence,	invigorating dream rushing	    you; and vote Republican
Smell the August flowers, experience, your 	    toes bare in the grass	toes bare in the beach 	    sand, toes bare in the carpet...if you, go to	    somewhere apply the, pedals, with your bare toes 	    when you can-
You are, important	    life is, a dream,	Getting dressed in the	    morning, is even a gratification...	    Cleansed after bathe-ing	one feels so, refreshed
Look, in the mirror	say nothing and see	    your worth, anything	positive you can find	    put on, your best outfit	pick up your keys to	    your car, drive to your	best friend's house without	    calling...Pass it on and	vote Republican
