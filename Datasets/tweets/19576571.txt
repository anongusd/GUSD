Anyway, it's not just about the WH briefing. But it is about the battles we choose to ignore. And this WH gets to ignore a lot. I see no one benefitting from that arrangement other than the president. Why comfort the powerful? 		/End
Maybe an antivaxxer like Trump and his WH weighing in wouldn't move the needle on measles in Oregon or Washington. But maybe it would, and maybe more kids would live due to that public pressure. But right now it's not a battle being fought, for reasons that make no sense to me.
How does it serve the news interests and the public interests to let the WH off the hook for these stories? Why does a president with bad records on all three of the examples I just gave *not* have to defend his positions, daily and publicly? Who does this benefit?
By allowing the Trump administration to ignore everything except a few issues at a time, we miss out on a federal policy hook for stories like: white nationalist terrorism, everify hypocrisy, and antivaxx outbreaks.
An example of why the WH briefing, in its mutually-accepted absence, hurts all of us: measles in the PNW. How? Because a local story with national implications would almost always churn grist in the Brady Briefing room, and that would sometimes lead to action.
