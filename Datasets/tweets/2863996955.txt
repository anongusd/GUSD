Right wing nuts and a few left wing nuts think it is ok for people subject to arrest on outstanding warrants or for illegal presence in the US to buy guns. Law enforcement officers responsible for apprehending those people see it differently. So do the rest of us.
@GreenMtgsGuru @WashTimes It has nothing to do with race. If you are subject to arrest because of outstanding warrants or immigration status you should not buy a gun and law enforcement should be told that you tried to buy one. I don’t care if you are from England, Norway, Mexico or the USA.
@MarkSWoodland @cindycrum And someone really needs to buy a gun when there is an outstanding warrant? No. Turn yourself in, contest the charges, then buy the gun.
@Dennis41270691 Fine. You find out about it when you try to buy the gun.
Nobody who is currently subject to apprehension by law enforcement whether because of outstanding warrants, or illegal presence in the US should be allowed to buy a gun. That is very dangerous for law enforcement.	Extremists gut gun laws when they try to make exceptions.
@PinotandPizza @WashTimes One congresswoman from New York —  most people aren’t listening to her.
This is a good amendment. A person who is currently in violation of the law and could be apprehended as a result should NOT buy a gun. Anyone with an outstanding warrant for anything also should NOT buy a gun. Dangerous for law enforcement.	https://t.co/C5sgLD3IH6 - @washtimes

For over two years this Country has been run by a bankrupt casino mogul. The deficit is sky high. Every time any candidate suggests any tax cut or spending program we need to demand specifics on how we’re going to pay for it. And, no the answer is not “Mexico will pay.”
@col_ludlow @MSNBC That’s part of the stupidity that got us into this mess.
@MSNBC For example you could say “everyone’s tax bracket goes up by 10% but everyone gets health insurance as part of the deal”	Another 5-10% for tuition free college. Whatever.	Just give us the specifics and let us debate them.
@MSNBC Another option: cut the defense budget. But say by how much and where the cuts will be made. Voters want specifics not a bunch of ideology.

Did the Senate Judiciary Committee ask Judge Kavanaugh as many questions about the  president’s powers under the National Emergency Act as they did questions about beer? I hope so. Even if they did he unfortunately would not have given informative answers.
I supported Garland’s nomination, was neutral on Gorsuch and opposed Kavanaugh. An overriding important concern was and is their approach to executive power.  Kavanaugh is the most worrisome. But today’s fake “emergency” should be too much for any judge or justice to tolerate.
My principal concern about Justice Kavanaugh was and still is his very expansive view of executive power. But this “national emergency” is likely too much even for him to stomach. The other justices also better think about what a left or right leaning president could do with it.
Trump loses in court for two reasons.	First this is not an emergency under the National Emergency Act.	Second, the Act, if it included circumstances such as these in its definition of “emergency” would be unconstitutional.

Is there any precedent for impeaching an official for actions before taking office or running for office, particularly absent a criminal conviction? If not why are politicians suggesting it? Let’s first remove a president who for 2 years committed serious crimes in office.

@lestatdelc Why not hold that union money until the general election when it is needed? Every dollar spent now is not there for the general election. And the cost of your spending it now is that the candidate you support has taken all sorts of other PAC money and some of that is corrupt.
@lestatdelc In many parts of the country so called “union” money is going to primary candidates who support sulfide mining and other ways of destroying the environment. That money is really corporate money.	Unions and corporations are not people. People should decide elections.
@CNNLies3 @realDonaldTrump Mueller will answer all of that.
@lestatdelc I don’t know about your “philosophy” of politics but mine is that bribery is wrong.	And in a Democratic primary at least the “but the GOP does it” argument does not apply.	Why not at least have an honest primary? That would make you MORE likely to win the general election.
@CNNLies3 Trying to be funny? A man who had several bankruptcies self funded?	@realDonaldTrump most likely is funded by the Russians.
@lestatdelc In a primary they can all agree to do it -- individual donors only. And they would agree if some of them weren't dependent on the PAC money.  Your argument may hold water in the general election but is NONSENSE in a primary unless the party is corrupt.
@AKMorlan For most of our history candidates have spent far less money than today. All I am asking is that candidates in primaries agree to use individual donations only and wait for the general election to play by the same rules as the other party. Why is that so difficult?
@MissySeeks That is exactly the rationale used by the Court in Citizens United. 	And it's wrong.
@lestatdelc Why don't they save that money for the general election and let the teachers, fire fighters etc. -- live human beings -- decide for themselves individually who to back in the primary?
@denmhan PAC Money from the people? Right.	Why not at least save it for the general election to use against the other party?	And rational reason to use it now?

@KaJo503 Democratic refers to the type of government. But democratic “socialism” is a lot more than just government regulation and providing basic services such as education and health insurance. Bringing that word up now just plays into the hands of @FoxNews
None of the single payer proposals being considered by Congress involves a government takeover of for-profit hospitals, medical practices or drug companies. Most proposals retain private insurance for those who want it. Talk of it being any type of “socialism” is just stupid.
It’s amazing that the right gets away with describing basic regulation and services as “socialism” and even more amazing that the left facilitates this by talking of “socialism” when we don’t yet have the basic regulations and services (including health insurance) that we need.
@GinaGenochio agreed.
@Alpha_Cunt @soso08 No — only the insurance component. And most people want private insurance to exist as well.
@BeRusTerr Nonsense. We can regulate capitalism and provide basic services including universal health insurance.
@heldcvt The term socialism is not politically acceptable in the vast majority of United States and it is aldo a terrible mischaractrization of government simply regulating capitalism and providing basic services. Socialist counties go a lot further than that.

@lillikusa Then impose a tax surcharge on higher incomes.  But when we do it let's skip the socialist rhetoric and personal attacks from the left on rich people.  Just raise the taxes to raise the revenue we need to fund the public option.
@RealGlenSColen Your local GOP is eager for you to start your volunteer work .... for the local Democrats.
@RealGlenSColen Facts? President Obama went to a very good one. So did Robert Mueller.
Funding high quality public schools and universities does not require abolishing private schools and universities.  Same for health insurance.  Let people choose.  But the single payer public option should be available to every American citizen and at an affordable cost.
@wisherseries As they should.  People should be able to choose, but everybody should have access to affordable health insurance.
@v_darkbloom Show of hands - who prefers their health insurance company to the government? Some people do; some don't.  Let them choose. 	Otherwise say bye-bye on Election Day.
If the single payer plan is cheaper, people will choose it.  "Cutting out the middle man" is smart, but politicians will LOSE if they talk about abolishing private health insurance plans that some voters like.

Trump appoints Ivanka and Jared to top White House posts.	Campaign donors always get top ambassadorial posts.	Pipeline companies want cronies on state utilities commissions.	But we worry about Willie Brown appointing a qualified person to two CA commissions 20 years ago? 	Funny.
@patrickdgatti @realDonaldTrump @LAmag Sorry. That’s not what happened. There is no way he would have appointed her if she were not qualified. Facts matter.
@joeclark_343 @realDonaldTrump @LAmag Those were stupid Democrats.	It was HRC’s own business to decide between getting a divorce and forgiving her husband for his adultery.
@curt_willis @realDonaldTrump @LAmag Harris is a lot smarter than the usual hacks that get put on state commissions by state party bosses. If you want proof of that just come to Minnesota where the pipeline industry is trying to pack the Public Utility Commission (PUC).

This criticism of Harris is a left wing looney version of what @realDonaldTrump is saying from the right. He thinks playing politics and promoting ideology is what the DOJ should do.  Wrong. Prosecutors should be enforcing the law.
@genuinejoehenry True indeed.

@MesabiDailyNews Dems could’ve prevented this House seat from going blue to red by running a clean water candidate like @Phifer4Change or @noozelady. But the boys from the DFL sulfide mining club sank those two in the primary. If they can’t win they’ll find a woman candidate who’s on their side.
@MesabiDailyNews Could someone ask @joeradinovich and @carlymelin why, after losing a race for the U.S. House, they still want to support the winning Congressman’s first bill that will pollute Lake Superior?	In politics supporting clean water (and paying your traffic tickets) can go a long way!
@MesabiDailyNews The bill is a swap of federal land for the sulfide mining company’s adjacent land. Reason for the swap: so the company (PolyMet) can mine on federal land without having to worry about federal environmental law. Consequence: pollution of the  Lake Superior watershed.
The sulfide mining companies are jamming this bill through even as the government is shut. Their trolls are busy today too, including the fiancé of Stauber’s losing DFL opponent who also supported this crooked deal. Our answer is NO.		https://t.co/SBB1VNMvXK via @MesabiDailyNews
@carlymelin I know who is where on sulfide mining. I’m not naive. 	I criticized his daddy setting him up to run for his own seat. I support young people who make their own way in public life, not state senate seats belonging to families. This is not a rotten borough in 18th century Britain!
@_cromer043 “He talks about his mother and her work mostly.”	Great campaign strategy — the GOP will love it.	@noozelady talks about her own ideas and her own work (she’s worked for a while so there is something to talk about)
@carlymelin Your friends at PolyMet-Glencore spend millions shilling for sulfide mining in Minnesota. Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is an investor and metals trading counter party. Call me a bully all you want but I will defend clean water on my own Twitter page.
@ianluhm @carlymelin Those are facts. And facts will never persuade the mining company shills. Defeat at the polls by educated voters is the only thing they will understand.
@carlymelin My comments are on my own Twitter page where I will defend clean water against you and other sulfide mining shills. I meant what I said about the US House seat in 2020. You may want it for yourself or @joeradinovich but if you don’t respect clean water you aren’t getting it.

The bill —a revival of the notoriously corrupt “Smith Amendment” that failed in 2018 — would “swap” a sulfide mining company’s land for adjacent federal land so the mining company can mine on the federal land without complying with environmental laws that apply to federal land.

@Crone369 Trump and Putin also are both consenting adults. But for some reason their clandestine relationship is a bit more worrisome.
@lisajyarde Both did wrong. But it was not an impeachable wrong. Unlike @realDonaldTrump
@covfefe_party Another way of lying under oath.
@Pattyfalino No. You are reading the Constitution. They are not.
@Pattyfalino Unfortunately the entire cabinet, the majority of the Senate and a substantial minority in the House.
Lest we go into the gutter with this discussion, a clandestine relationship need not be sexual. Plenty of clandestine relationships are financial and political.
It has been suggested that in the future we prohibit presidents from having clandestine relationships with persons who are their subordinates. I agree. But let us first deal with a president who has a clandestine relationship with a man in Moscow who is so obviously his boss.
@TravelGardenEat Monica would have lost on summary judgment if she had brought a harassment claim. Lawyers would have risked sanctions. The facts just aren’t there.
@c_staheli Further evidence that our president should have had better judgment than to get involved with such a person as Monica. @HillaryClinton was a good wife, mother and world leader. He did wrong by her and the Country but it was not an impeachable wrong.
@musicmommy23 Exactly right. And anyone linking those facts to #metoo is making a fool of themselves.
@TravelGardenEat Show me a single case anywhere that would support a harassment claim against Bill based on Monica’s facts (not other facts involving an unwilling participant)
@covfefe_party I said he was impeached for the lie.
@CelticLady1953 Of course. That’s why nobody ever made that argument. He was only impeached for the lie.
@teri_63 Of course she was not a victim. She was a perpetrator along with him. The victims were Hillary and Chelsea. But if we removed presidents for that, we would have removed a lot of them...
@AstralLobo @maddow @morningmika @MSNBC I asked for a single case to support a legal argument that he committed harassment based on those facts. You have none.	I have said over and over again that the sexual act was immoral. We do not live in a theocracy; yours or mine.
@AstralLobo Adultery is always immoral. But we don’t impeach for immorality. Losing argument.
@concerned14all @spetersonwrite “Humanistically” —that’s a new one.	This just takes us back to the sin of adultery. Two perpetrators; two victims (Hillary and Chelsea). Sinful and hurtful but not impeachable under civil law. We are not a theocracy.
As for anyone claiming that Clinton was guilty of sexual harassment of Lewinsky, please cite a single case anywhere in the United States or the world that would give her a cause of action under the facts. We are sick of made up law and made up facts.	He was impeached for the lie.
@spetersonwrite You should learn something about law. Monica would lose a suit for harassment in every single state; indeed probably in every single country in the world. You are making up law to go with made up facts.
Lying is wrong and liars should be held accountable. But conduct is also important. Will we go down in human history as the superpower that obsessed about a president’s adultery with an intern but did nothing about a president caught in bed with Vladimir Putin?
@Rielle48138098 More like the comparison between a president drinking a can of American beer to an entire bottle of Russian vodka.
@karlsblaha I said “removed from office” for it.	Nope.
@vintage_vendor @katekahn1 I agree with that. The idea that she is a victim is a big joke.
@Barmy Agreed. That is why in both cases I left the lying out if it.
@katekahn1 Both were instigators. Both were guilty of adultery. But that is not a threat to our national security or even a violation of civil law.
Is there a single rational person who thinks Clinton should have been removed from office for a secret affair with an intern?	Is there a single rational person who thinks Trump should not be removed for having secret deals with the Russians?	Which is more dangerous for America?
“So what” if a person under investigation for secret deals with the Russians talks with a witness before the witness testifies?	That’s just ordinary witness tampering.	Unlike Bill Clinton he didn’t lie about something important such as his sex life.	Right?	https://t.co/5Dn9ZSQPIK

@TenMonthBaby Here we go. Right into the trap ....	Just in time for 2020....
The legitimate reasons for opposing the wall are massive cost, ineffectiveness and environmental impact. Trump is dragging this out hoping that one or more Democrats will fumble by publicly stating a stupid reason for opposing the wall so he can run with this all the way to 2020.
@quidpro53581632 @realDonaldTrump It’s a waste. But people making over $1 million a year waste a lot of money. If you say you are opposed  to the wall for any reason other than waste of money, ineffectiveness and environmental impact he’s got you checkmated.
If @realdonaldtrump were smart he would propose a sufficient tax surcharge on incomes over $1 million to raise triple the cost of the wall and then a middle class tax rebate from what’s left over. Democrats would have a hard time with that one. But he’s not smart.
Nobody wants people coming into our Country illegally except the employers (including @realdonaldtrump) who with impunity hire undocumented workers. Start prosecuting and fining them and a lot of the problem goes away. Don’t waste OUR money on HIS useless wall.

The minute Democrats agree to any linkage between temporary or permanent DACA and Trump’s wall it’s over— he wins. The wall works to stop illegal immigration or it doesn’t (it doesn’t). It’s a waste of money or it’s not (it is a waste). DACA is irrelevant.	https://t.co/rvWE6RgFYZ

@MuhFreezePeach @graham_copp The right wing has tried that tactic since the 1930s. But Democrats from FDR on were careful to avoid the term “socialism”	There was a separate socialist party for people who wanted to go that route.
@Bevin802 Anyone with any understanding of American history knows that the label “socialist” goes nowhere in American politics. It’s a deal killer everywhere except in a few pockets of the Country. Brooklyn may be one and Vermont another. Bernie has lived in both but we have a big Country.
@KemalBegich Communism is where everything is owned by the government. Socialism is where major industries are owned by government. Americans want neither. We want regulated capitalism, progressive taxation and basic services: universal health care, public education including universities ...
@cosmicfirepeace Does the government own most of the banks, the energy companies, the transportation companies and large producers of raw materials? If not it’s not socialism but capitalism with some basic public services such as education, health care, subsidized transportation etc.
@Bevin802 That was the strongest argument against him. Not his policy ideas but his use of a ridiculous label for those ideas.

@ohmy115 All I hear is Democratic Party hacks attacking  him not on the merits but using the “he is not a real Democrat” bs that was hurled at Bernie. DNC needs to make it clear that line is not acceptable. Either they are an open party or they are not.
@PoliticalBrianL What is a contest on the “merits”?	Is it a bunch of asinine state party bosses asking if the candidate is a “real Democrat” or some other party loyalty test or is it real debates about real issues?
@hambuild Then open up your primaries. There are things to criticize about Bernie but the “he is not a real Democrat” line is pathetic and alienates those of us who are independents.
@ohmy115 You can’t have it both ways — insist on long-standing Democratic Party loyalty from all candidates in primaries and then expect people not to run as independents. A great many voters are independents and we are not gong to just wait and see what you serve to us on Election Day.

@BlaBlubb6 @politifactny The point is that the money has to come from somewhere -employers or the government- and like every other expenditure it has a cost. The money should go at least in equal shares to people who need it to stay out of  poverty.  Poor people in the USA are worse off than in Germany.
@BlaBlubb6 @politifactny There is no free public child care in most parts of the US.  We have much more income inequality. We need to take care of our poor first rather than enact government mandates that increase costs to employers without directing the benefits to the people who need them the most.
@T_shirtSlogans @politifactny Government programs and mandates are not there to benefit the rich or to create "incentives" for rich people to make certain decisions about work vs. family. The private sector rewards rich people enough already. Government should stay out or help the people who need help.
@Pat_Donovan People who can afford to live in midtown Manhattan aren't the top priority right now. How about the people who clean the office buildings in Manhattan and commute out to wherever they can afford to live (and where that child or sick family member is waiting for them)?
@gweezus1 @politifactny Are we trying to do more social engineering by creating yet more "incentives" for rich people, or are we tying to make sure that the birth of a child or a sick family member does not plunge an entire family into poverty?
@TypicalDad71 @politifactny Nice photo of Manhattan on your Twitter page. Someone who lives in the Bronx and clean the floors in Manhattan office towers might see it differently.
@Nurseryman75 @politifactny Read the constitution.  States have the right to make their own laws provided they are not preempted by federal laws.
@BlaBlubb6 @politifactny Germany has a lot less wage inequality than we do., A German type system here would reward high income professionals and leave low income workers high and dry.

@ahwatukeerunner @jaymansker @politifactny Perhaps yes. But if it is a tax there is a concept called progressive taxation. A flat tax is not the only alternative.
@ahwatukeerunner @jaymansker @politifactny Not to say that —unfortunately—we have a ridiculous number of wasteful government programs and tax breaks already that are all about creating incentives (handouts) for rich people.
@T_shirtSlogans @politifactny True, nobody should be thrown into poverty because of caring for a child or sick family member. But don’t argue that the person making less should get even less. That’s not only a living argument but a selfish one.
@ahwatukeerunner @jaymansker @politifactny Same lump sum, whatever the payroll tax raises divided by the number of people claiming the benefit. Treating people equally does not “penalize” lawyers unless you think they are better caregivers than janitors. Government programs aren’t about creating incentives for rich people
@T_shirtSlogans @politifactny Rich people are used to more money and have higher expenses.	Rich people need more incentives to do the right thing.	Trickle, trickle, trickle down ....	We’ve heard it all before.
@jaymansker @politifactny Nonsense. Try being the single mother or single father janitor or married janitor and you will see how silly this is. If the law firm wants to give the lawyer more money fine, but the government should at least treat them equally.
@politifactny When state governments enact family leave plans it will be obvious if they are really trying to help working people or mostly help “progressive professionals.” When we take time off work to care for a child or a sick family member, the work we do is of equal value.
Paid family leave is a great idea but absolute dollar benefits should be the same for everyone. Lawyers who take several weeks off work to care for a family member shouldn’t get more than janitors.		https://t.co/hW7GLw0thK via @PolitiFactNY

@PeggyfromIRB @NRutman Low wages are a huge problem.  Employers use illegal immigrants to create the problem and make it worse. Bust them and the problem is solved. The wall is useless.
@Bethpikegirl @stockguy61 That’s not our problem right now.	Our work force is very large — just way underpaid.
@AKAGeorgeBarry The cheap labor problem contributes to a lot of those other problems. We need to crack down in employers of undocumented workers and raise minimum wages for Americans.
@br0k3nhalos Abolishing slavery made cotton more expensive; although employers then came up with Jim Crow to satisfy their thirst for cheap labor.	There need to be some rules in the labor market — minimum wage, no illegal hires — or many Americans will end up working for close to nothing.
@GinaGenochio It’s the employers who break the law to get cheap labor who cause the problem. Make both cheap labor (under $15) and hiring illegals unlawful in the U.S. and employers won’t do it.
The entire problem comes from employers who break our laws to avoid paying a living wage. Once we make all employers pay at least $15 per hour and hire only documented workers the problem stops. The wage law and the immigration law together bear down in anyone who cheats.
Congress needs to counter his foolish immigration policy with a bill providing for:	$15 minimum wage for all Americans.	Strict enforcement and heavy fines for employers hiring undocumented workers.	Temporary work permits to address labor shortages.	https://t.co/bPTejQPaWO
@ThisEastonLife $15 an hour will help a lot.	If you still need more people use temporary work permits for immigrants who come in for a few months and then leave the Country. But pay everybody the $15.

@RebeccazWriting @rjFortunato We can blame problems on someone else or solve them. $15 minimum wage for Americans, stronger unions to help raise wages above $15 in many sectors, and big fines for people who hire illegals would help a lot. A wall is useless. Ignoring the problem is dumb.
@vjacqueline66 He’s a fool. But so are people who won’t recognize the problem and crack down on employers who use illegal employees as a way to avoid paying a living wage to Americans.
@covfefe_party @rjFortunato What’s the point of being employed if you can’t survive on what you are being paid? How many people are there out there who can’t do something worth at least $15 per hour?
@PamHutson6 Food will cost triple because farmers have to pay $15 per hour to Americans?  That’s crazy. If that doesn’t bring in enough workers use temporary work permits for people to immigrate, work on farms for a few months then go home.
@vjacqueline66 You probably don’t have to compete with illegal hires willing to make far less than $15 per hour which should be the minimum wage. We need to fine the employers who hire illegals to avoid paying a living wage to Americans. We don’t need a stupid wall.
@rjFortunato Illegal immigration contributes to wage stagnation which is a big problem. We need $15 minimum wage for all Americans plus strict enforcement and stiff penalties for anyone who hires illegally. E.g. the Trump Organization.
@parallax2020 High on the list. 	But fine the employers that hire illegals and you solve most of it. $15 minimum wage and you bring enough Americans into the work force that nobody will be talking about labor shortages and relying on illegal hires.
@1liners Unemployment will rise when @realDonaldTrump puts the economy into a recession. The last thing we need is excess labor supply. We need $15 minimum for the people who are already here and strict enforcement against employers who hire illegally.
@TheWrongQuest When Trump throws the economy into a recession we will find out that unemployment of Americans and anyone else here is a huge problem.
@UrsineLeonard Absolutely right.
Two types of fools:	Anyone who thinks there isn’t an illegal immigration problem. 	Anyone who thinks a wall will solve it.
The answer to labor shortages isn’t more illegal immigration; it’s a $15 / hour minimum wage to bring more Americans into the work force.	The answer to illegal immigration isn’t a wall.	It’s imposing a big fine on employers like the Trump Organization that hire illegally.
There is no border emergency. 	We have an illegal immigration problem because employers like the Trump Organization hire undocumented workers to avoid paying Americans a living wage.	Enforce our laws; impose heavy fines on employers. Problem solved.	https://t.co/UcPkEX4v2d

@ad_the_bad52 @ewarren Mike Bloomberg does as well.  If you could get the two of them to agree on an economic policy it would be a guaranteed winner.
@ewarren When Republicans took the White House, the economy was usually quite strong and Democrats were divided on social issues: 1952, 1968, 1980 (economy still stagnant but probably better than in 1976), 2000, 2016. Consistent theme since 1976: the middle class is falling behind.
@jheartney @ewarren Watergate was a factor but the economy was awful in 1975-76. Stagflation. That was the beginning of the decline of the American middle class as wages fell behind inflation and more families had to depend upon two incomes to bring in what they had before with one.
Every time Democrats took the White House away from Republicans the economy was what did it (1932, 1960, 1976, 1992, 2008). You can agree or disagree with @ewarren but she is focusing on the exact right issues. It’s worse for the middle class than it was in 1960. Listen ... https://t.co/dq9VZxr3wy

If saving money is a conservative idea then single payer is conservative. What we have now is a rip off.

@SeeMeBe It should be illegal for kids up to the drinking age -21.	17 is too young to be messing around with pot or booze.	But in the current environment pot dealers sell to everyone and kids get pot more easily than they can get booze.
@SeeMeBe @AnnMar43405922 Tax, regulate advertising, ban sales to kids. Fine.	It’s the criminal prohibition that makes no sense.
@shadman2k Alcohol is a drug too. Used in moderation by some people it is fine. Others not.	Adults should decide for themselves.	Kids should wait.
@SeeMeBe I tell my kids the same thing. Stay off the weed, tobacco and booze and whatever else is out there. But government regulating sales to adults makes it worse not better. Stick to regulating sales to minors as we do with booze and tobacco. Keep it simple.
@AnnMar43405922 We did that with booze. It’s better than the hypocrisy of prohibition and got the mob out of the booze business.

@burpiedoodle It was very hurtful to Hillary and their daughter Chelsea. There is a reason it is wrong then and now.

@reluctantzealot OK but that law is probably unconstitutional. The many many other laws Trump has violated are not.
@annamarieyl Clinton was never impeached for harassment. That wax a civil harassment suit and the problem was when he lied instead of refusing to answer an overbroad discovery question.
And Clinton did not pay hush money during a political campaign without reporting it to the FEC, a campaign finance violation.

Most important is to reserve judgment about anything until facts are in.  Senator Harris clearly says that she did not know and I at least believe her. Now we get to the "should have known" issue.  Also, why didn't the AG's office tell her?
The Nolan matter was widely publicized.	The other matter involved harassment of @ChrisHoroshak for being gay and is reported in the Ely Timberjay newspaper as well as on his Twitter page.

@cwark1 The Founders didn’t have cameras, much less the Internet where mug shots can be posted, driving a company’s stock into the tank.
@RobertauxBruce It is an abuse. That’s my point. And when it involves a prominent foreign national it is very bad for our international reputation.
@GinaGenochio If the practice is different and strong suspicion of a crime is enough to release mug shots, then Bob Mueller owed us some mug shots a long time ago.
If mug shots are supposed to be taken and publicly released on suspicion of a crime before charges are filed, we are way overdue for some. Let me think, whose might they be? Hmm...
@GinaGenochio And charged! All I said is that the mug shot should be released when prosecutors decide to charge. Until there is enough evidence what is the point of releasing a mug shot to the public?

@ray_osa @gtconway3d The judge entered the discovery order in Clinton v Jones. It was wrong. Clinton should have appealed the discovery order, refused to answer the irrelevant question and take a default judgment, or tell the truth. He made a bad decision. But not an impeachable offense.

@WildSoCali @gtconway3d That has to do with the merits of the Jones suit which I am not defending.	But it has nothing to do with the constitutional principle that a President — including Trump — is not immune from suit.

Reminder: the entire point of this land swap is to allow PolyMet to conduct sulfide mining on federal land without complying with federal law. 	Crooked!

@gtconway3d The work of @gtconway3d in Jones v. Clinton was mostly focused on the constitutional question of whether a sitting president can be sued. But for that holding (regardless of the merits of Jones’s claim) the NY AG’s suit against Trump would likely be tied up in the federal courts.

@TroyOfJ @trex9123 @AlMonitor The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. Foreign governments need not bring lawsuits in US Courts. Foreign businesses can if a US law protecting them from illegal boycotts is violated.

@trex9123 @YancyFaith @225VOLT @AlMonitor Most likely yes under the constitution depending upon the wording of the law. Whether the law is good policy is another question. Israel cannot be compared to either of those countries on a factual basis. But that likely is not relevant to the constitutional question.
@trex9123 @AShakow @AlMonitor That is the difference between a boycott by a consumer who is a natural person and a boycott by a business operating in interstate and foreign commerce. If you won’t eat at a restaurant owned by a black person you have that right. But they must serve you.
@celldude @AlMonitor It’s all about ideology—not the Constitution.

@LoveUSOfAmerica @AlMonitor As American as a law requiring a  wedding cake baker to serve gays. The free speech argument is BS when it comes to commercial transactions.
@celldude @AlMonitor Citizens United and the wedding cake baker agree. Many of us do not.  But it is very odd to see those who disapprove of Citizens United and the baker say that Congress cannot also Constitutionally prohibit a large scale commercial boycott of a foreign country
@YancyFaith @225VOLT @trex9123 @AlMonitor It’s been a while. And we don’t want to go back there. Or to the boycotts of Germany in the 1930s.
@trex9123 @AlMonitor No - businesses have to do business with people if Congress tells them they have to. 	For example the civil rights laws or an anti-boycott law. Those laws are constitutional under the Commerce Clause.
@AShakow @trex9123 @AlMonitor It’s called the Commerce Clause. It was the basis for the civil rights laws in the 1960s. It gives Congress the right to regulate interstate and FOREIGN commerce.
@legaleagle48 @trex9123 @AlMonitor And I say that’s BS when you operate a business in commerce.
@nerdythor @trex9123 @AlMonitor That provision I would strike. The mere communication of such information alone without any economic transaction or refusal to transact by the same person (actual boycott) would likely be protected speech. It’s the boycotting by businesses that can and should be regulated.
@SublimeBlues @trex9123 @AlMonitor “My store won’t serve blacks, or immigrants from (name your country) or will not deal with companies controlled by Palestinians .....” 	Congress can prohibit all of that if it wants and in many situations should. It’s called the Commerce Clause.
@trex9123 @AlMonitor What law are you citing about South Africa? Congress never passed such a law so that hypo tells us nothing about whether such a law is constitutional.
@nerdythor @trex9123 @AlMonitor Congress did not pass such a law. A foreign commerce boycott is not illegal without the law. My point is that the law is constitutional if passed.
@legaleagle48 @trex9123 @AlMonitor The courts need to tell them that. The federal and state governments can regulate commerce.
@225VOLT @trex9123 @AlMonitor Which you can do, but not on the basis of race because that was prohibited by Congress in 1965. That’s been the law for over 50 years.

Yes that includes the occasional idiot who makes derogatory comments about straight white Christian men as well as the far too many idiots who make derogatory comments about everyone else (that's you 45).   	In dealing with idiots, there is no need to discriminate.
@BlaxkMillie @realDonaldTrump How much BS can you pack into a single Tweet? A lot. Almost as much as @realDonaldTrump
@jesseflamme @realDonaldTrump Only stupid people make such comments and I blocked them too.
@RizutoPhil @realDonaldTrump It is fine to have a secular humanist philosophy. You can do that without insulting other people’s religion, just as I can be a Christian without insulting Jews, Muslims and humanists. Unless you think you are smarter than all of us in which case you worship yourself.
@Kennyright2 @realDonaldTrump You mean people like Roger Stone who do set up jobs on political enemies.	His turn in the barrel with Mueller.	Enjoy!
I am blocking commentators who make derogatory and discriminatory statements about the race, religion, sex or sexual orientation of candidates and other public figures. In 2020 voters will block any political party that condones your conduct. That includes you @realDonaldTrump
@kz1300a4_lee If you are an average working American you won’t be spending much on presents. That tax cut went to the 1% and your health care costs are through the roof.
@TuckerCarlson This behavior is disgusting. His name should be made public so restaurants and other public establishments can show him the door.

@Ysastep @realDonaldTrump @CNN We don’t have a billionaire in the White House right now. Whatever there is in the Trump organization likely isn’t his.
@Angeoo @alwaysaliberal @Steve_Ma2 @realDonaldTrump @CNN Maybe not. But people should be nice about it. There are other good candidates too.
@tux_nyc @realDonaldTrump @CNN And for sensible gun laws.
@jokesnottomake @realDonaldTrump @CNN Let’s hope.	And Pence too.
@alwaysaliberal @Steve_Ma2 @realDonaldTrump @CNN So are mine. Same with millions of other Americans. Get good candidates who focus on issues or we support someone else.
@HershelsKid @jokesnottomake @realDonaldTrump @CNN You don’t need to choose Bloomberg. Choose Bernie if you want, but if the rationale is that the candidate must be a “loyal Democrat” you lose. Americans are sick if that. Trump won by being anything but a “loyal Republican.” He’s a fraud but at least he got that figured out.
@TrumpCarnage @realDonaldTrump @CNN Bloomberg has done a lot for other people and also got rich. Trump has done nothing for others and also is no billionaire.
@Brightly11 @realDonaldTrump @CNN Who cares about the party labels? What are his positions on issues? 40% of voters don’t consider themselves members of either party. I am one of them.
@HershelsKid @realDonaldTrump @CNN I am an independent. I have said that hundreds of times. This is a stupid conversation. Focus on issues.
@jokesnottomake @realDonaldTrump @CNN As an independent? Do you really want that? Your Democrat identity obsession is getting ahead of common sense. A good third party candidate runs and Trump gets four more years.
@halehawk @realDonaldTrump @CNN Agreed.
@Raine2587041 @realDonaldTrump @CNN 2020 will be a much better year if Americans stay focused on issues. Lots of good candidates too.
@Steve_Ma2 @realDonaldTrump @CNN And Bloomberg does not have to put up with that. He doesn’t have to win the primary, but Democrats should play nice if they do not want him going independent.
@Raine2587041 @realDonaldTrump @CNN Think of something intelligent to say rather than talking about candidates’ race, sex and age. Or at least don’t expect people you disparage to vote for your party’s candidate. 2016 was not enough fun for you?
@Steve_Ma2 @realDonaldTrump @CNN True indeed. And that’s why these people asking whether he is a “real Democrat” are very stupid. I put up with that BS in a DFL senate primary here because I didn’t want to throw the race to the GOP as an independent. And the party bosses’ attitude from the start was still F-you.
@ExGOPer @suser_rolfe @realDonaldTrump @CNN Different currency too.
@suser_rolfe @realDonaldTrump @CNN No more?	We don’t have one now. It’s probably Putin’s money.
Bloomberg: A real candidate who focuses on a real issue, climate change, perhaps the most important issue facing us today.	And unlike @realdonaldtrump a real businessman.	Dollars no rubles.		Bloomberg heads to Iowa -- to premiere climate movie @CNN https://t.co/ITXwYaXjAE
@BernalJatleen Obama did his job.
@VoteEarlyNow @donna0222 He made sense. Common sense. We miss that.
@jmfshr I do.
@thepowerofmeow Good choice.
@carvealittlez Clinton was actually a better candidate than at least half the field this time. She has more appeal to the middle class and working class than many of them with a few exceptions (Biden, Brown and perhaps O’Rourke).
@bmac1949 She needs to sell her stock. Millions in conflicts of interest. That won’t fly.
@Debforsure Exactly right. Those are all issues for everyone.  The economy and the environment and how they work —or don’t — for everyone.
@lrhoke That gives you 10% margin of error if you get ALL the other voters. Too close. Skip the divisive rhetoric without changing positions on actual issues and you get more than the other 10%. It’s not that hard.
@jmfshr Conservatives should support saving money (single payer health coverage) and conserving the environment. It’s the left wing rhetoric (always divisive) that hurts, not the positions on concrete issues.
@Lookingforclue1 Makes sense.
@Michele40820756 Plenty you can do: Biden, O’Rourke, Warren, Clinton or anyone else willing and able to focus on the economy and environment and not get sucked into the issues that divide working Americans.
@MaggienelMark The Dems had better or it’s four more years. And what’s pathetic is that @realDonaldTrump gets so many people to vote against their own economic interests and instead of focusing on that (and their own strong suit) the Dems get sucked into divisive social issues.
@JayneCudzil That’s for sure. Trump has the NLRB packed with management lawyers and they don’t like me telling them that.
@BossLedZepLuvr @springsteen Springsteen is a lot smarter than @realDonaldTrump
@BirkieGal @TomPerez Trump and his buddies sure got a good deal on that bill. The 99% (regardless of “identity”) got ripped off.
@MuJml2621 @realDonaldTrump Those are the issues to focus on. His economic plan is a mess. Just like his businesses.

@JayneCudzil Speaking of which — McDonalds lawyers went after me last month for saying that in the dispute over union organizing to Fight for $15 McDonalds should not get to rely on former lawyers from their own labor law firms to vote on their side as Trump appointees to the NLRB. Corrupt!
@CBinVAN Even the Russians?
@jot_au There are always wing nuts on any side who will carp about something. But Obama did a good job enforcing immigration laws. Trump made much a do about nothing much.

@xgdfalcon Cheapest price for best quality. And the alternative plan is ....?
@williampietri This is exactly why we have anti-discrimination laws.  What we need is an Administration that enforces them. CFPB and other agencies aren't doing their job. Rather than Trump style identity politics we need to uphold the rule of law. This should not be a partisan issue.
Higher taxes? Lower premiums? 	It's cash out of pocket and quality health care -- not labels or political ideology -- that matter to the average American. 	If single payer health insurance saves money it's worth it.	So what's the cheaper and better plan?	https://t.co/rQUNL7OksL
@MuJml2621 True indeed. 	And one thing they have in common -- whether New York tradesmen in former years of working Americans today, they are getting screwed by @realDonaldTrump
@dejaff You have that right.. He loves that game.
@bigbadseanw It is obvious. Identity politics is his favorite game because he wins.
@taylor_newbold Obama had an even more difficult illegal immigration problem to deal with than Bush, but he dealt with it by complying with the law as well as enforcing the law. Overall a very good job.
@Cleo_LaPeter And he did it legally. Don't need to Google that.

@goldenerin Those are all key issues -- and all boil down to either economics or the environment. Those are the two areas people are most concerned about.
@Zenber1 Very smart strategy. These are the issues at the top of everyone's list.
@nickbatz Then it's Pence.  And that could be even worse, particularly as an opponent if the economy is still strong.
The NYSE is booming and the rich get richer, but for most Americans the economy isn't working. It's still "the economy stupid." Clinton won on that, and so did Obama (both in the middle of recessions). Health care is key. Play a different game if you wish but take your chances.
@williampietri But Republicans play that game and win. Democrats lose.	Focus on "the economy stupid:" as Bill Clinton's advisers used to say.
@davisda23694604 Good choice. Almost won Texas without taking bribes (PAC money).
@WhiskeyMD247365 Good choice.
@PatrickMiles31 Absolutely right it is.  Much of what Trump says is identity politics. He just finds out what the left is saying and flips the coin. At the identify politics game, he wins and he knows it.
@LessThanLiz Health care is the number one issue, along with income inequality and the environment.
Springsteen is exactly right. Democrats can nominate who they will, but they indulge in identity politics and political correctness at their peril. Americans are focused on an economy that works for EVERYONE. Trump doesn't deliver, but he talks the talk.	https://t.co/YmKSw8lpph
@Will_B_Back @ConstructConnx A lot of older people as well as younger people support conservation.  Protecting our planet should not be used to create a generational divide.  We all want to protect the planet for future generations and we must work together to do it.

@Will_B_Back @ConstructConnx True indeed. He’s producing lots of it ... at both ends.
@NorthrjVerizon @MinnPost Absolutely. The pipelines and sulfide mines are a much bigger threat to traditional pastimes in Minnesota (hunting, fishing, camping and canoeing) than having sensible gun laws that would actually make it easier and safer to own guns.
@TMFBackspin @MinnPost Plunder is gender neutral. They’ve got plenty of matriarchs in there too. E.g. Betsy Devos, Kellyanne Conway ...

@FinancialTimes Mining companies have enough money to buy an entire state legislature several times over, plus dozens of union bosses and “trade council”’shills, and some left over to bus “activists” into political a convention to call sulfide mining opponents racists or whatever it takes...

@TammyClore @YouTube Twice dumb this is. DFL lost two blue seats - two out of three in the entire USA!
@TammyClore @YouTube The PolyMet federal land swap had to get through Congress. You know that and so does everyone else. We are aware of the role of corrupt federal officials and we aren’t stupid.
@TammyClore @YouTube Here we go with the identity politics. A pathetic excuse for losing a congressional seat because you like big sulfide mining companies owned by foreign billionaires. Dumb.
@TammyClore @YouTube Have fun with PolyMet 	You lose.
@TammyClore @YouTube The DFL obviously doesn’t understand the 8th. That’s why Pete Stauber is the next Congressman.	Furthermore they wasted time and money up there on a loser candidate instead of focusing on supporting a much better candidate who lost by a hair down in CD1.  Dumb.

@loramgn He is a great Pope in many ways, and he certainly has been a leader in getting the Church to focus on something other than abortion. But this problem must be fixed and starting with some common sense would help. The difference between sexual orientation and pedophilia is obvious.
@mygardenkicks Good sound ideas, all of them.
@KHShan That would help a lot.
The Episcopal Church has openly gay and straight clergy. We have had occasional problems with both but there has been no noticeable correlation with sexual orientation.

@efoster13 @YouTube We know what happened.  It’s about PolyMet and you know it. It will be something else next time.	I was thrilled to do everything possible to support pro-clean water candidate Skip Sandman. And I will do so again. DFL get your act together or lose!
@efoster13 @YouTube And guess who bankrolled the slanderous attacks on Phifer because of her service under Obama for the FBI and ICE. The same people who want sulfide mining in Minnesota.	Disgusting.
@efoster13 @YouTube BS. She defended the men and women in the field. We defend our men and women in uniform. Get rid of Trump. Reorganize or abolish ICE. Whatever. But don’t attack the men and women who defend our Country. Get your facts straight. No wonder the DFL lost  that race.
@univofmn @MinnPost Another bad pick. But it was clear that once Pfifer went down Radinovich was going to get it. He was Rick Nolan’s man. And Rick Nolan was the mining companies’ man.
@efoster13 @YouTube She was a translator for ICE and the FBI and quit because of Trump.	Blaming her for what Trump is doing is like blaming John Kerry for the Vietnam War because he was a soldier. Or blaming Tammy Duckworth for the Iraq War. 	Stupid.
@Raj28046585 @YouTube There are a lot of very intelligent good people up in CD8.	An honest candidate from either party can win but —on the DFL side at least — not without the support of people who care about clean water.
