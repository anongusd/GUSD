Everyday Trump shows us who he is...trying to manipulate people to do what he wants done, not in the countrys interest only in his own...is it that hard to believe Cohen and others who state he acted in his own interest...and still is?
So now trump is thinking of firing yet another, wtf is this a game show to him, people we need to dump trumps! Lets find a country of his pals and send him and his family packing never allow them to return or do business here or in any American territories again

Sorry about my tweets yall but Im sick of these brainless automatons of the current republican congress, they have no souls
And yet they wont impeach they wont make a move, because the republicans are also complacent with the benefactors
1) isolate america	2) stir racial discord	3) alienate ali's	4) disrupt nations access to global economy 	5) Do not interfere with systematic distruction of freedom of press	6) withdraw US troops thus allowing the benefactors troops to expand their territories	7) bankrup America
What I think, In order to win the election it looks like Trump took funding and synergy with specific instructions from his benefactor(s) that he has to do certain global moves to fulfill their cooperation, granted this is only my opinion
