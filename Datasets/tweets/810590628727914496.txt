2‚É£ This is where McConnell comes into play (which can make this complicated). He could throw a procedural roadblock. Like requiring senators to vote on a ‚Äúmotion to table‚Äù (aka take the resolution off the floor) before moving forward on the resolution itself.
1‚É£ It goes to the Appropriations Committee and they have 15 days (max!) to debate and work on the resolution. After those 15 days, the senate has 3 days to vote on it.

There will be another funding fight in September, oversight hearings, and opportunities to engage 2020 contenders on immigration &amp; press them on this issue. We remain focused on our long term goal to move Democrats to a more just vision where families &amp; communities come first.
The phone calls, the organizing, the conversations in our communities - all of them make an enormous difference. Without your work, the outcome would have been much worse. And, we hope, this will help set us up for the work that comes next.
It‚Äôs important to remember: things would have been much, much worse if not for the work you have done. If we hadn‚Äôt built a #BlueWave &amp; called our MoCs, Trump would have gotten his wall, an even greater expansion to his deportation force, &amp; cut off asylum to children &amp; families.
Democrats still have a lot of work to do on immigration issues. Dems have seen this issue as a political liability, and have focused on enforcement-first for 20 years. When they lead with security ‚Äî instead of leading with justice ‚Äî we get deals like this.
It‚Äôs a false choice to say that it‚Äôs a bad deal or a shutdown. This is and has always been a Trump-created crisis. If we get a shutdown, it will be because of Trump‚Äôs insistence on funding for his hateful wall and deportation machine. It‚Äôs what got us here in the first place.
We have a moral responsibility to stand with immigrants who would suffer harm from this deal. We join with @UNITEDWEDREAM, @NILC, @DetentionWatch, &amp; the #DefundHate coalition to call on Congress to vote NO on this deal - and pass a clean funding bill instead. https://t.co/kZkvcVPCyG
The bill includes an overall increase to DHS‚Äôs enforcement budget, $1.375 billion for Trump‚Äôs wall (although not his full demand for $5 billion), a massive increase in jail space for immigrants and asylum seekers, and funding for more ICE/CBP agents. https://t.co/6ucSHrRKNf

Republicans and Democrats are still finalizing details on the deal -- which is why we need to KEEP CALLING OUR MoCs! If they don‚Äôt reach a deal, they can always pass a clean CR, which funds the government at the current level - and which would be better than a bad deal. ‚òéÔ∏è‚òéÔ∏è‚òéÔ∏è https://t.co/dXQiHrMEfJ
ICE is out of control. They continue to terrorize immigrant families and blatantly ignore congressional oversight - and this deal gives Nativist Republicans more money to jail and deport immigrants.
Bottom line: Trump‚Äôs not getting what he wants in this deal and he won't be able to say he's fulfilled his campaign promise of building his hateful wall. He caused a lot of harm by shutting down the government trying to get it. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good deal.
*AND* this deal does NOTHING to prevent ICE from continuing to steal from other accounts to hold more people. It‚Äôs estimated that Trump could use this as a blank check to transfer money to hold as many as 58,000 people.
Congress set the limit on the # of people ICE could hold. ICE had a limit of 40,500 a day - &amp; is currently holding 49,000 immigrants. This deal wld increase ICE‚Äôs limit of people they can hold per day - basically rewarding them for disregarding the limit Congress previously set.
This deal gives ground on immigration agents, border construction, and detention beds. And importantly, does *nothing* to rein in ICE abuses. Why is funding for detention beds such a big deal? More detention beds = more capacity for ICE to jail immigrants. Let‚Äôs break it down:
While the deal on the table doesn‚Äôt give Trump the original $5 billion he demanded and shut the government down over, still includes some bad provisions that will give Trump more resources to target immigrant families. Based on what's being reported...
The conference committee is finalizing details on a DHS funding deal - and while we‚Äôre still waiting for firm details, what we‚Äôre hearing makes us pretty nervous. https://t.co/wCCt83NgFx

#SB1090 would place unnecessary burdens on the use of emergency voting - including photo ID and a signed affidavit declaring (by penalty of perjury) that the voter had an emergency that would prevent them from voting otherwise.
#SB1072 would require photo ID for in-person early voting in addition to the currently required signature.
#SB1046 would require permanent early voters to turn in ballots by mail instead of dropping them off in person on Election Day. Over 300,000 early voters did this in 2018. Those people would instead be forced to wait in line on Election Day - increasing wait times for everyone.
.@MichelleUgenti (LD 23) has introduced three bills to make it harder to vote early: #SB1046, #SB1072, and #SB1090. https://t.co/wVg7f5sZJU
In the 2018 election, Arizona‚Äôs early voting totals surpassed 2014 total voter turnout! With huge surges in Democratic early voting, Republicans in #AZLeg are now retaliating by trying to impose barriers on early voting.
URGENT THREAD: Across the country, Republicans have used their power to retaliate for Democratic electoral gains. We saw it in WI &amp; MI with the #GOPPowerGrab, and now the GOP is coming after voting rights in Arizona TODAY. #VotingMattersAZ #AZVotingRights https://t.co/d23BK5fLYK

For Republicans: No new funding for the wall or ‚Äúborder security‚Äù. Keep the government open. Demand they support a conference agreement with no new funding for the wall, or we will be right back where we started - with another government shutdown on February 16.
For Democrats: THANK YOU! And keep it up. The government reopened with no new funding for the wall, and we should thank them for holding strong to make sure that happened. Democrats should support a conference agreement that has no new funding for the wall or "border security".
If Congress can‚Äôt reach an agreement by 2/15, government funding will run out, and we face the possibility of another #TrumpShutdown. We need to KEEP CALLING, keep up the pressure on our MoCs and make two things clear:

Scenario #3: No deal emerges either from the conference committee or separately - and Trump declares a national emergency to build his border wall. If that happens, there are three things Congress can and should do immediately: https://t.co/smrrDhznTz
Scenario #2: No deal emerges through the conference committee, but a separate effort emerges where Republicans try to use Dreamers as bargaining chips to pay for Trump‚Äôs demands for more cages, agents, and the border wall‚Äîsomething that immigration groups broadly oppose.
There are 3 likely scenarios that will play out over the next week and a half: 		#1: A deal w/ additional ‚Äúborder security‚Äù funding for Trump‚Äôs inhumane policies &amp; agenda, like caging families. It may not have the votes to pass Congress, and we wouldn‚Äôt want a bad deal to pass.
UPDATE: The conference committee negotiating a final funding package for the Dept of Homeland Security (DHS) has its first meeting today. Not much will come out of today's meeting, but they must come to an agreement by Fri, 2/8. (More on conference cmtes: https://t.co/6vPMdVQp13)

Taking this offer would empower Trump to go after more immigrant families, devastate border communities and the environment, and would have no impact on border security. For this reason, we continue to oppose any money for Trump‚Äôs wall or immigration enforcement.
Let's be clear: Trump has NEVER negotiated in good faith. This latest offer is no different. What he proposes wouldn't provide permanent relief for Dreamers, but instead give him Trump the power to continue using them and TPS holders as hostages.
@AngelRafPadilla This afternoon, Trump made another sham "offer" to end the chaos he created. Trump and Mitch McConnell must immediately work to reopen the government and stop the harm being done to families across the country, if they're serious about ending the shutdown.

Right now, the most important thing you can do is keep pressuring your Senators to end the #TrumpShutdown, with $0 for Trump‚Äôs border wall. Republicans should pressure Mitch McConnell to bring a vote to reopen the government, and Dems should keep playing hardball and hold strong.
UPDATE: Due to the #TrumpShutdown, it appears as though January recess is cancelled in both the House and the Senate next week. Holding our MoCs accountable, however, is never cancelled. Here are the actions you should take in the coming week:

Trump is throwing a temper tantrum, demanding $5 billion in funding from Congress for his unnecessary, xenophobic border wall - and shutting down the government over it. https://t.co/IkK4tqaReU #TrumpShutdown
A clean CR has already passed the Senate once ‚Äî unanimously. It will pass again if McConnell puts it on the floor. If he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôd be acting to extend the #TrumpShutdown. We need Democrats to stay strong and say NO to any more funding for Trump‚Äôs racist, xenophobic agenda.
The short-term CR would not provide any new money for construction of Trump‚Äôs useless and racist border wall, and would lift the immediate harm being caused by the shutdown on families across the country. After the bill passes in the House, it‚Äôll go to the Senate.
The funding bill would fund most of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends in September. However, it would only fund DHS until early February - giving Congress more time to deal with Trump‚Äôs wall demands.
Tomorrow is the first day of the 116th Congress‚Äìwhich means that Democrats will be back in control. Once they get some important administrative things out of the way, Democrats plan to immediately pass a funding bill that would re-open the government.

It's unlikely Senate Republicans will use this option, but anything is possible. However, it won‚Äôt matter if they don‚Äôt have the votes to pass the bill. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to keep calling your Senators! Tell them to vote NO on this CR &amp; to #DefundHate: ‚òéÔ∏è 1-844-236-2373
You may remember the "nuclear option" from April 2017, when Mitch McConnell used it to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: https://t.co/etUd0LDtl0		Using the nuclear option is a clear signal that Senate Republicans will do whatever it takes to push through their agenda.
The "nuclear" option essentially means getting rid of the filibuster for legislation. Right now, the Senate needs 60 votes to pass legislation. This would change it to a simple majority - meaning Republicans could pass the wall bill w/ as few as 50 votes &amp; a Pence tie break vote.
Last night, House Republicans voted to pass a CR with $5+ BILLION for Trump's racist border wall and agenda - the same agenda that voters rejected in November. Now, Trump - and some Senate Republicans - are suggesting using the "nuclear option." Here's what that means:

The #TrumpTantrum over funding for his xenophobic agenda is currently spiraling out of control - and if the House passes a clean CR but Trump vetoes it, we also face a government shutdown starting this weekend.
There are a number of different scenarios that could happen (laid out in our resource‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/YzyqNfUaIb). Bottom line: if the House does anything other than pass the same bill the Senate passed last night, we're likely facing a #TrumpShutdown starting at 12:01 AM Saturday.

The new organizers will be located in key states where Indivisibles are building power for the long haul -- and where we can help them do it.
These folks are critical -- from leading trainings for local Indivisible groups, to tough coalition-building work connecting volunteers across the country, to supporting massive days and weekends of action, and beyond.
We‚Äôre talking 14 new organizers that work directly with Indivisibles to help build power locally, 3 training organizers, and 3 digital organizers to ramp up digital capacity for Indivisible groups everywhere.
It was all possible because of the amazing support we received in order to double our organizing team this year. And in 2019 we‚Äôve got to level up again. But to do that we need to grow our team by a lot.
It‚Äôs no secret that Indivisibles are doing amazing work that‚Äôs changing our democracy. To help you do it, we are building the best organizing team in the country.

And our endorsed candidates on average did 8.5 percentage points better than the Democratic candidates for those races did in 2016. Indivisibles did the work to build the #BlueWave - and it shows.

In #CA48, Indivisibles endorsed @HarleyRouda early in an effort to oust 15-term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher (aka ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs favorite congressman‚Äù) - and thanks to their relentless efforts to #VoteThemOut, Rouda will be the next congressman from CA-48.
In #WA08, @davereichert announced his retirement from Congress after @Indivisible_WA8 wouldn‚Äôt stop calling and emailing his office - they even staged a die-in to protest his vote on #Trumpcare. Last week, they elected @DrKimSchrier to represent them in Congress!
In #CA49, @DarrellIssa retired earlier this year after @SDIndivisible visited his office 59 weeks in a row (he even retired the day after Indivisible groups held a retirement party for him). They worked hard to elect @MikeLevinCA, who will listen to their voices in Congress!
.@nj11forchange held weekly protests at @USRepRodney‚Äôs office, leaving comments with his staff and demanding he answer their questions. He couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure - and he retired. With #NJ11 wide open, Indivisibles worked to elect @MikieSherrill - and she won!

This is a pretty clear attempt from Trump to seize some control over the investigation. WHITAKER CAN NOT RUN THIS INVESTIGATION. We need to demand that he commit to let Mueller run things independently, or recuse from the investigation like Sessions did.

In a few days, we‚Äôll release a new Indivisible guide: Indivisible on Offense. Indivisibles all over the country made last night's win possible and showed how we can win again. Let us know you‚Äôre in for 2019: https://t.co/Po6LBUcYEu
Last night‚Äôs enormous victory changes the game.We all know Trump won‚Äôt take this loss sitting down. The fight for our democracy is far from over. But we also know that Indivisibles all over the country made last night's win possible and showed how we can win again.
The new Democratic House majority has agenda-setting power. They can pass legislation. They can use investigatory and subpoena power. They can act as a check on this Administration. And they can lead the path forward.
We saw incredible gains and wins on the state level, which could play a huge role in redistricting in 2020. (check out @jiggy_ca‚Äôs thread on our victories here: https://t.co/eHVZs9WMyH)
But we‚Äôve achieved something fundamental. We laid the groundwork for the campaigns that took shape this year - and for Democrats to have a competitive House map. Whether our candidates won or lost, we have changed the course of American democracy.
We didn‚Äôt win everywhere. In some states, Republicans have rigged the rules, or we‚Äôre still building the power we need to win. We‚Äôre mourning losses in critical places like Florida, Georgia, and Texas. We have work to do to end voter suppression.
We took the House. 		We keep repeating it over and over to ourselves: ùëæùíÜ ùíïùíêùíêùíå ùíïùíâùíÜ ùëØùíêùíñùíîùíÜ!		This is a big milestone -- but it isn't the finish line.

To those who left it all out on the field for a candidate who didn't win tonight: we grieve with you. Know that you're part of the nationwide movement that built this historic wave. We took the U.S. House back tonight, and we did it together. Keep fighting.
They weren‚Äôt elected to cut deals with the GOP - they will stand for no wall. No tax cuts. And NO compromises on healthcare or immigrant justice.
Our newly-elected members of Congress will go to DC with a mandate to chart a new, progressive path forward, protect democracy, and stop the harm of the Trump administration.
And on the federal level, we‚Äôve elected progressive champions to serve in Congress. These candidates have rejected corporate PAC dollars; winning with small-dollar, online donations. They know first-hand what Congress does impacts everyday people.
So far tonight on the state level, we've seen 6 flips in state legislatures, 5 new democratic trifectas in state legislatures, 3 republican trifectas we've ended, and 2 republican supermajorities we've broken.
Indivisibles consistently pressured their MoCs and ensured they couldn‚Äôt escape their votes when they came home. We fought for EVERY seat - even the ones people said weren‚Äôt winnable. And Indivisible groups endorsed ùôùùô™ùô£ùôôùôßùôöùôôùô® of candidates up and down the ballot.
And Indivisibles organized like never before for weeks to get to this victory. To name just a few highlights, our groups have: 	- Held 2,220 electoral events in 45 states for 25 weeks in a row 	- Used our voter contact tools in 376 races 	- Made 11 MILLION+ voter contact attempts
Tonight is proof the Indivisible model works. We‚Äôve proven it. Trust and invest in local leadership. Don‚Äôt tell people what to do - empower them to lead themselves. Organize, organize, organize.
Elections aren‚Äôt just won on election day. The #BlueWave was built drop by drop, after weeks, months, and years of organizing. This win is a product of fearless, determined organizing by Indivisibles and grassroots activists in every community, every city, every state.
[THREAD] It‚Äôs official. WE JUST TOOK BACK THE HOUSE. This victory wasn‚Äôt made possible by anyone in DC. - in fact, in January 2017, almost nobody in DC thought this was possible at all. This victory was made possible by YOU - the extraordinary, nationwide grassroots resistance.

Indivisibles were ready to #DoTheWork and build the #BlueWave: Our groups held over 2,220 electoral events in 45 states for 25 weeks in a row and made over 11 MILLION voter contact attempts so far, and they have used our voter contact tools in 376 races in 31 states.
Indivisibles made it unacceptable to ignore your constituents &amp; worked to change our democracy. Last year, Indivisible groups worked to create stunning electoral upsets. And this yr, they‚Äôve worked to #VoteThemOut &amp; elect new, diverse leaders who will change the Democratic party.
Last night, @maddow profiled how Indivisibles killed #Trumpcare through public pressure, ensured that the GOP had few wins to run on, and how constituent pressure fueled Republican retirements - and put Republican seats in danger. (watch the clip: https://t.co/Ex1rpvyJCo)
