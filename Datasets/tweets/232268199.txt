My heart goes out to the victims and their loved ones. In the wake of this tragedy, I am calling for a full investigation into the collision including with the complete cooperation of the MTA, State Police, local law enforcement and the NTSB. https://t.co/KsgdI7ZvI2
Read the full plan here: https://t.co/ElazcpkKsk
Cap Fare Increases: MTA fares for public mass transportation must be controlled in future years through cost containment actions and improved management. The MTA should be able to operate with mass transit fare increases limited to inflationary increases of 2% per year.
Supplement: Congestion pricing tolls would be supplemented with State and City revenue from a fixed amount of the new internet sales tax derived from sales in New York City, with a growth factor, and a percentage of the State and City revenue from the cannabis excise tax.
Congestion Pricing: Revenue from electronic tolling of Manhattan south of 61st Street will be placed in a lockbox for MTA capital needs, which include new signaling, new subway cars, track and car repair, accessibility, buses and bus system improvements.
Reorganize: MTA will develop a reorganization plan to make the agency more efficient and effective. The 1968-designed structure makes coordination between MTA's entities difficult and expensive.
This morning, jointly with @NYCMayor, I announced a 10 point plan to transform and fix the MTA.

We owe it to Dr. Ford and to all survivors of abuse to fully investigate these serious and credible allegations prior to a vote for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.
As Senators on both sides of the aisle have now called for, there must be an FBI investigation before any floor vote. And as part of that investigation, Judge Kavanaugh must take a polygraph test as Dr. Ford has done.
By voting to advance Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, the Republicans on the committee have cowardly abdicated their constitutional duty and effectively said to every woman in this country that their voice matters less than a man's. Shame on them.
A woman's testimony is worth as much as a man's. That shouldn't be a controversial proposition. https://t.co/B5MrqaRxI3
