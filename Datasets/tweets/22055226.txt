Gohmert doubles down after FBI dismisses claim of Clinton server hack https://t.co/09ZLmJiw09
It was the Obama-appointed Intelligence Community Inspector General that discovered the breach. It was not the #FBI that found it, so their statement was technically correct, but very deceptive in its omission: https://t.co/IIB2Z1TboF
One thing has been made acutely clear – partisan politics, sadly, are very much at play within some of the leadership at the #FBI ... LINK: https://t.co/AixgDoQ1rs
