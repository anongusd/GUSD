@tomhanks that's a weak thumb
@rickygervais what about cod? Technically it's a fish but where do you draw the line?
@EBischoff watching @IMPACTWRESTLING on Challenge in the UK and the ad break includes adverts for WWE12. Conflict of interest much?
@kategarraway @danlobb is there something wrong with my telly or is Chelsee actually that orange?
@johnreport or smarketing?
@clbleakley you and Adrian were perfectly good on @Daybreak. Definitely not your fault the ratings weren't as astronomical as itv wanted
@CewshReviews I've been visiting the site everyday for 6 years and all this time I thought rajah was a woman. Tis surely a revelation

@johnreport who would most benefit from repackaging and what gimmick would you give them?
@CewshReviews obvious answer- Mark Henry. But not vs Big Show
@Lord_Sugar can you only afford one telly in these times of austerity?
@Lord_Sugar is it 400 pages of you ranting about @piersmorgan?
@CewshReviews are you going to inflate your prices for unnecessary post writing 3D conversions that add nothing to the reviews?
@simonpegg google that shit
@DavidGArnold you can afford to buy all your followers a new car, surely?

@Herring1967 don't you think Jord Wallace looks like a gay adoptee?
@bradlandau you smell
@SethMacFarlane buy it back with euros! It'll only cost you about a dollar
@johnreport @CewshReviews just saw TNA are doing a team elimination match for thanksgiving. That's an original idea.
@Glinner I once described a friend as more armpit than brad Pitt to a girl we were trying to set him up with

@AlecBaldwin have you checked out the Vader Sessions on YouTube?
@charltonbrooker the first 5 minutes of Up summarising his childless marriage is absolutely heartbreaking
@MintzPlasse on Xbox or ps3?
@serafinowicz #PSQA what villain most deserves to get away with it?
@CMPunk forgive the ignorance Phil, but what movie is that?

@AlecBaldwin can I fling the espresso in his face at the same time as stomping him?
@gailkimITSME would a million of you be so bad?
@CewshReviews great retrospective by the way, I missed WCW around this time and it's compelling to see the implosion
@CewshReviews Cewsh: "The shows have been...humous, credible, compelling, filled with potential..." really? WCW Chick Pea Dip?
@CewshReviews who do you think Masters was talking about in regards to PS Heyes?
@RealKingRegal totally agree the worlds beat thrown forearm. A masterclass!
@CewshReviews I'm sure that haunt wouldn't live up to its potential
@Herring1967 has no one ignorantly shouted mong at you yet?

@CMPunk you want to check out Spike Milligan's tombstone it says "I told you I was ill"
@Herring1967 perhaps they need to check on google dictionary first to see the definition of an apology.
@Herring1967 RG apologised a lesser man than yourself might feel a bit smug and vindicated
@JRsBBQ do you think WWEStudios is a tax write off? The movies suck balls and make no money and it looks like its on purpose!

@TheNightCougar wow that's real nice. Not blackberry nice, but...nice. To be honest I'd be mad if I found that.
@AlecBaldwin is there any superhero you wished you'd played?
