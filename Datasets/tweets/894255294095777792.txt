@charliekirk11 No, Planned Parenthood Votes (a separate business entity) is part of a coalition of political organizations that raised roughly $30M via individual donors. It’s just a super PAC.		The Planned Parenthood parent company has donated less than $10M in total since its inception.

I’ve orchestrated a massive clusterfuck at our southern border. The government shutdown that I’m responsible for will continue indefinitely until so many people are mad at me that I finally cave. I’m waiting in the White House, eating a filet-o-fish from @McDonalds https://t.co/Rxs9jrbOps

@MarkBennett1103 @p_perry2672 @apocrytwofish @cticasso @FJforAll @brithume I’ll let you know when I value your opinion
@p_perry2672 @MarkBennett1103 @apocrytwofish @cticasso @FJforAll @brithume Nah, you just need to learn to care about different things.
@p_perry2672 @MarkBennett1103 @apocrytwofish @cticasso @FJforAll @brithume I can’t control your level of comprehension
@p_perry2672 @MarkBennett1103 @apocrytwofish @cticasso @FJforAll @brithume It was an argument I didn’t care about being accurate because it didn’t matter. Once again, you’ve missed the point entirely.

@dbongino It’s because Dick Cheney is an evil, conniving piece of shit. This was a dig on him, not an actual salute to an imaginary figure. 		You really go for the low hanging fruit, don’t you?
@charliekirk11 Why? You expect every POTUS to collude with foreign governments for personal gain or are you just being petty a spiteful because your boy is a piece of shit?
@realDonaldTrump I really wish you’d just stfu already
@TheCalebStanley @HoodJesusYo It’s funny how God always seems to be something different depending on whoever is speaking for him.
@johnkartch @GroverNorquist Because a 100% tax rate would literally leave zero incentive to earn any further income.		A lot of business owners obviously can’t be trusted to share the wealth with their employees so someone needs to step in &amp; make damn sure it happens.
@GroverNorquist How exactly are you measuring prosperity?
I’m terrified of brown people. https://t.co/F8PNpuymNJ

@RoKhanna I highly doubt he’s too concerned, which is by no means any indication that he rightfully shouldn’t be.		It’s not hurting him any &amp; his Trumpanzee acolytes seem willing to defend him no matter how much he slaps them in the face.

The American people have grown accustomed to being threatened with government shutdowns every December. 		Not exactly a good look for democracy.

@TheRickWilson The phrase “suck it, looser” would actually be great advice if not for the comma.
@MattGertz @jamespmanley “The fact that he makes a decision that might be different than his advisors doesn’t mean he’s getting bad information. It means he’s relying on other information.”		If his decisions don’t stem from the very best info then the “other” info he’s acting on clearly isn’t the best.

@GroverNorquist That’s only because most Americans buy into all the propaganda shoved down their throats about how a progressive tax negatively affects them. 		This isn’t a radical idea at all. FDR’s top tax bracket was taxed at over 90% &amp; it helped the economy immensely.
@realDonaldTrump It’s a good thing you won’t stop because you’re doing nothing except creating more by the day.

@instagramjones @KYGOP @KyDems We’re actually still waiting for them to demonstrate that they know what having values entails.
@Wigg2152 @KYGOP @KyDems Nah...doesn’t count. I didn’t hear anything about caressing a vagina.
@KYGOP @KyDems I support her openness, even if it is considered crass by some. 		I pay far less attention to the specific words people use than I do to the central message they’re trying to convey. 		Be an adult &amp; quit clutching your pearls.
@NyadolNyuon They’ve either actually been paying attention to polling data or they’re trying a different approach due to faltering viewership numbers.		Either way, it’s about damn time.
@FollowThePaulo @PaulyPeligroso @HouseGOP Nah, that wall would being saying, “chupar una polla entera.”.
@JoeMuto @HouseGOP Only when vaginas are being caressed.
@RomanLike @ILCitizen @HouseGOP @GOP The torches don’t bother me. It’s the people who are holding them that you have to worry about.
@HouseGOP Yeahhhh...pretty sure you guys asked for this type of response. Sounds a lot like you’re just butthurt that the opposition has decided to be equally as ruthless. 		We don’t care about words; we care about results.
@Pappiness Well...Trump clearly knows more about polling than anyone, but he still isn’t concerned due to the daily folders he’s given that are filled with positive news about him.
@realDonaldTrump The only good thing you’ve actually done thus far is withdraw American troops from Syria; every other claimed “accomplishment” is indicative of a garbage ass used car salesman whose glory days were over 2 decades ago.		We’re laughing at you, not with you.
I missed the entire point of the wall metaphor in @GameOfThrones, which is that walls don’t work. I’m also oblivious to the fact that “Winter” symbolizes the very climate change problem that I deny on a regular basis. https://t.co/iuVS04hWdn
