6) Recounts involve procedures. Don't let someone else tell you the procedures. Read them for yourself. Even if it *seems* the procedures are clear, every recount will involve nuances and new wrinkles.
5) Recounts involve math. Don't let someone else do the math for you. Get out your own calculators, reporters.
4) Voters are, um, more creative than you will expect. https://t.co/zVZFeuV7JK
3) People will shout FRAUD and CRIMINAL. They will rarely be right. But whether the shouters are correct or not will not matter to partisans who will believe the FRAUD and CRIMINAL forever.
2) The candidate/campaign that is behind on election night tends to try to get more votes in to the count. The candidate/campaign that is ahead will try to freeze the count that shows them ahead.
As a veteran of the Minnesota recount wars, here are some things I've learned:	1) Recounts are campaigns-extended into different realms. They are less about what is good and true and more about trying to win. Remember that as you cover.

@aaron_hoffman Last (for I'm out of time again) there is the thrill of democracy. You get to participate in deciding the future. Your small voice, plus another small voice, plus another can change the world. It is a thrill. And it's free for the taking.
@aaron_hoffman And every vote really does count. I've covered two statewide recounts that were decided by a fraction of the overall vote. Every single one of those votes made a difference.
@aaron_hoffman But even if you don't believe in the candidates themselves, you can believe in you. You wouldn't let someone else decide your coffee order or the color of your shirt, why would you let someone else decide who represents you?
@aaron_hoffman Beyond policy, the candidates represent themselves -- they have a wide variety of backgrounds, which influences their decisions when they come to power.
@aaron_hoffman Let's get back to this question and start with this: Having studied candidates for all sorts of offices, I see a clear difference among them. Whether you care about education, tax policy, health care, infrastructure or abortion, the candidates offer clearly different answers.

If you were playing a drinking game on the number of times Reynolds said "number one state in the nation" and the number of times Hubbell said "Medicaid", you'd be quite in your cups right now.
And after a lightening round, we're on to final statements. Thanks for following!
Hubbell, who had 60 more seconds to come up with an answer, says he wants to be a governor for all Iowans. "I want to work with anybody who wants to work for Iowans"
Asked who in her party she disagrees with, Reynolds pauses for quite a while. Then says that she does sometimes agree with Trump, mentions NAFTA.
Hubbell and Reynolds asked about guns. Breaking: strong #2A and #guncontrol people likely already know what they think about the candidates.
43 minutes in, the crowd decided the instruction to "shhhh" no longer applies. Cheers for both Hubbell and Reynolds from their partisans as the candidates got their dig in.
Asked if the budget is in good shape or bad shape, Hubbell said "I don't know" because it's "out of control". Reynolds says the budget is in the best shape it has been.
BTW, Our Iowa Poll found that her weakest point was privatized Medicaid and his was not releasing his tax returns (as Reynolds just cited)	Here are the numbers: https://t.co/E4q3N6rdhb
Hubbell asks Reynolds about the contributions she's taken from MCOs, she slips in a dig at Hubbell for not releasing more on his taxes. (The @KimReynoldsIA war room hoots in pleasure)
Now the candidates get to ask questions of the other. 	Hubbell asks Reynolds about Medicaid.
And now a break! We're working to get some fresh content for you on https://t.co/G70VQhWhlw very soon. good stuff.
Reynolds tries speaking while off-mic to dispute something Hubbell said about E15. Moderator cut her off.
Now getting feisty over renewable fuels. Getting hot in here.
Getting a little feisty between Hubbell and Reynolds over privatized Medicaid.
Hubbell says in response that the breaks were for a public company not him (also corrects my tweet)
I'm pretty sure I just heard cheers from the @KimReynoldsIA war room when Reynolds managed to work in a mention of tax breaks Hubbell took as a private citizen.

Context on the Iowa economy: 	https://t.co/xbo1MA5hqC
Seven minutes in, both Reynolds and Hubbell have stuck to the lines they've said many times. Will that change in the next 43 minutes?
Reynolds says that the biggest problem is lack of workforce. 		Hubbell says that biggest problem is that the state is not creating more opportunities for Iowans.
Hubbell starts with the story of ‚ÄúTucker‚Äù who he says was harmed by privatization of Medicaid. 		Reynolds says her signature line ‚Äúmy story is the Iowa story‚Äù

The president seems to enjoy hearing the cheers when he says "Nebraska" so he is saying it...a lot.
President seems to believes he control the media's TV cameras and is angry they don't listen to him when he demands they show the crowd.

"Kayne West who gets it," Trump says, in reference to African-American unemployment.
Young is running against Cindy Axne, whom Trump calls "Cindy Tax-me."
Trump invites Rep. David Young to the stage. Trump: "A vote for David is a vote for me"
Trump invites Kim Reynolds to the stage. "Mr. President, thank you for year-round E15"
Trump on Steve King: "He may be the world's most conservative human being."
Now he's testing how big the crowd was from Iowa and Nebraska. He said "Iowa" and then "Nebraska." Got a far bigger cheer from saying Nebraska.
Crowd chants "GO BIG RED." Trump responds with "I won Iowa, I won Nebraska."
Trump gets a big cheer, I think, for saying "Nebraska."
Trump says he want people to come to the country legally, through merit. The crowd chants "BUILD THE WALL."

Trump says Democrats have gone "wacko" and calls Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas" again and has now moved on to Corey Booker and now Blumenthal and now @SenFeinstein.

Trump tells people to "go vote" and adds if people already have voted they can leave "you don't have to listen to me" and people can give their spots to people waiting outside.
Trump mentions Grassley: "An Iowa legend" and "very tough cookie"
U.S.A. chant. "Hello, Iowa, it is great to be back in Council Bluffs...this is truly a historic week for America," Trump says to cheers. Mentions Kavanaugh, crowd cheers more.
Trump has been introduced in Council Bluffs. Waving and blowing kisses to the crowd.

Speaking of Iowa thoughts: Want to come work with me? https://t.co/MdiSgklRJC
Last, you can take me out of Minnesota but as the last 12 hours have shown, I still care about you northern voters. You are fun!		Now back to Iowa thoughts.
If Walz wins the governor race, he will be the first outstate governor since...Perpich? But GOP's Johnson (who now lives in the suburbs) grew up outstate so rural voters will have a chance to see one of their own in either case.
Dems will offer up demographic diversity in November with Muslim-Americans on the statewide ticket and in #mn05, a Native American LG, a gay woman and two female Senate candidates. In one of the Senate races, both parties will have female candidates.
A snapshot of previous years also shows Dems turning out for primaries: In 2014 when Ds didn't have huge statewide primaries and Rs did turnout was about even. In 2010, when Ds had a contested gov primary about 450K turned out to Rs' (without contested gov primary) 130K voted.
As I've previously tweeted, more Democrats voted in the primary than Republicans. Dems may have had more reason to turnout (seriously contested and rather crowded primaries in #mn05, #mn08, gov and AG vs. whereas GOP had #mn01 and gov, mostly)
Walz won the Dem governor's primary. I'm guessing some of the folks who voted for Walz also liked Murphy but thought Walz would be a better candidate against Pawlenty. (But see previous tweet:  Pawlenty lost)
Gender is not destiny.
Female Democratic candidates had a mixed night: Two female candidates for governor (Murphy and Swanson) and one for AG (Hilstrom) lost. But Omar and Craig won U.S. House primaries and Smith and Klobuchar easily won Senate primaries. (Plus Housley won the GOP Senate race easily)
Late comers to the primary had a mixed night: Pawlenty. Painter, Swanson all jumped in late. All lost. Ellison jumped in late and won.
1) Johnson was more all in for Trump.	2) Rock hard conservatives weren't huge Pawlenty fans when he was gov. Those are the folks that vote in primaries.	3) Pawlenty skipped party endorsement (see #2)	4) Pawlenty came back to MN from DC, where he was, basically, a banking lobbyist
Former Gov. Pawlenty's loss to party-endorsed Jeff Johnson is still surprising. Pawlenty got 44% to Johnson's 53%. Possible factors:
Okay. Before I get back to Iowa politics (VP Pence is in town today) and the Des Moines Register State Fair Soapbox (two candidates today), a few takeaways from Minnesota's primary:
