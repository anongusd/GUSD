@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren I can see that. Woodstock and the hippie movement was not good for our workforce.  They were the parents of the "gimme" generation.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren Smart businesses will pay good workers what they are worth. Dumb businesses will no longer be in business. This is how it has worked for a couple of hundred of years. 		And the employer is not the enemy. Can't say that enough
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren #1 - it's not the governments money to steal. 	#2 - my kids will have a work ethic even if it kills me in the process and they will respect the effort that went into earning it.		The mantra in my house is "do not be a drain on society. Work for what you want and don't owe anyone"
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren Never worked for a union and would not care to either.  A body of workers telling the employer what they have to pay is also insanity to me.  A profitable business stays in business. A business being forced to provide unwarranted and equal pay across the board is doomed.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren The cause of their poverty? or the reason they even having a job!  The employer is NOT the enemy!  I really don't even understand this concept of the employer starting a business, hiring people, and then being the enemy for giving people jobs. Insane.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren Everyone has the same opportunity. This is America. Not everyone has the same drive.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren There is no swaying either one of us. We are cut from 2 different molds and I'm ok with that. But I will not work so that someone else doesn't have to. Now if they cannot work due to physical or mental impairments, that is different, but this new "gimme" generation is pathetic.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren No. But I have before and I worked my way up. Some people are happy being miserable. I was not, so I worked my butt off to get where I am. Not my job to pay for my happiness AND someone else that doesn't have a work ethic.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren No they are not.  I have met and unfortunately worked with many that are not goal oriented. Mostly millenials, the "gimme" generation. If someone wants those things, it takes more work and dedication. I'm tired of paying for everyone else's "entertainment funds" with my taxes.
@uasalmouse @jenospeno @MrsRoman23 @ewarren Ahh... Oregan.  Say no more.  Sweetie, you don't know me or know what I would do.

@eastbaycalifa @captgmreed @BernieSanders It did. For those that stayed out of debt, they were perfectly fine and it worked very well.
@eastbaycalifa @captgmreed @BernieSanders Predatory lenders were not in full attack mode during those times. People lived within their means. debt was frowned upon.  Now, if a family of four doesn't have a house, 3 car payments and 3+ credit cards, they are considered like mennonites in a horse and buggy.
@eastbaycalifa @captgmreed @BernieSanders Trickle down economics was beautiful. Reagan was a master.
@captgmreed @eastbaycalifa @BernieSanders And back then people had work ethic. Millenials, whom I have had the displeasure of working with (not working for) have little to no work ethic.
