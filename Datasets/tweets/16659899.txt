@SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @typewriteralley @Reuvencarlyle Agreed, it was more a passive-aggressive gaslighting. If you support a particular bill, then you support global warming and want to undermine transit.
@typewriteralley @SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Maybe it‚Äôs because those same advocates focus all their efforts on attacking the handful who support transit instead of the vast majority who aren‚Äôt helping? But feel free to continue attacking your friends and hoping for a better outcome! üëçüëç
@SeattleSubway @typewriteralley @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Diverting a tax that doesn‚Äôt exist? Please continue the circular firing squad, shooting at the few transit advocates we have. The oil industry loves it when we destroy each other in an ideological battle for who is most pure... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@typewriteralley @SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle That argument is not credible. I support using carbon revenues for emissions reduction and I support more transit funding. But we shouldn‚Äôt rely on silly arguments with no basis in reality.
Rather than duplicate service, anyone who needs to get from the Mukilteo Ferry to Boeing should take Everett Transit route 70! The schedule looks perfectly designed to get commuters to work and back. https://t.co/Nk7o9bO5Ew

@SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Fair criticism. But how does that translate to undermining transit? We are adding thousands of hours of service in Snohomish Co, don‚Äôt see why fixing the US-2 trestle undermines that?

A majority of Republican voters support the President‚Äôs policy of #FamilySeparation while the American people oppose it. This is a replay of the 2016 Trump playbook: stoke racial divisions and hope you win by plurality. It‚Äôs also how Hitler became chancellor in 1933.
Our democracy depends on each of us confronting wrong and evil actions by our government. The Trump administration policy of separating families and holding children in inhumane conditions must stop‚Äîimmediately. #KeepFamiliesTogether #NotInMyName

@cgpapworth @SenMarkoLiias And your 2nd question about apartments, they do pay property taxes based on the assessed value of the property, just like homeowners do. In fact, all private property in the state pays property taxes, not just homes. County assessors determine the value for tax purposes 3/3
@cgpapworth @SenMarkoLiias The funding problem you‚Äôve been hearing about is related to a decision by our state Supreme Court that said the state needs to provide more funding as promised in a law passed in 2008. It took us a decade but this spring the state finally budgeted enough to meet that promise. 2/3
@cgpapworth @SenMarkoLiias Good questions! The lottery does generate millions for education ($126.8 million in 2017), which is a big deal! But our total state budget for education is $12.4 billion, so the lottery makes up ~1% of that. The other 99% comes from other sources like sales and property tax 1/3
