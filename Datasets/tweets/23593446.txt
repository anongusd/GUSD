The promise of America is that we‚Äôre all in this together. @realdonaldtrump doesn‚Äôt understand that. It‚Äôs time for them to put workers first with a permanent middle class tax cut, new investments in education, and cutting off tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.
What we saw at GM this week is going to keep happening in cities and towns across America. This administration is going to bat for the wealthy and well-connected, and telling everyone else they‚Äôre on their own. That‚Äôs wrong.
Working people put their faith in @realDonaldTrump to get things done for them. Instead, he‚Äôs running the government like a slush fund for his friends on Wall Street.
The President hasn‚Äôt done a single thing to help keep jobs in the United States. Instead, his tax cut actually raised incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas.
The President‚Äôs cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations on the backs of working people. He promised the benefits would trickle down. That was a lie.
(This will be a thread) Some thoughts on this week‚Äôs GM news and what it says about our country...
Thinking of Harvey Milk and George Moscone. 40 years later, there is still much more work to be done in the fight for full LGBT equality. 		‚ÄúAll men are created equal. Now matter how hard they try, they can never erase those words. That is what America is about.‚Äù
Obviously they colluded with Russia. They‚Äôre also trying to take away health care from working people, cut taxes for the wealthy, and use their public offices to make a lot of money for themselves.
GM got a huge tax cut thanks to @realDonaldTrump. Today we learned they‚Äôre laying off thousands of American workers and closing three major plants.		Working people deserve better - a permanent tax cut for the middle class, lower costs, and good-paying jobs. #ForThePeople

.@realdonaldtrump and the Republicans have done nothing for working people. So they‚Äôre going to try and blame immigrants for all our problems. Voters are smarter than that.

Next January, Congress should get to work enacting new laws to hold concentrated economic power to account, address the corrupting influence of corporate money in our democracy, and restore the rights of Americans.
I am confident that, despite @Facebook‚Äôs best efforts to buy Congress‚Äôs silence, the will of the American people will prevail.
It is long past time for us to take action.
Now we know that once they knew the truth, top @Facebook executives did everything they could to hide it from the public by using a playbook of suppressing opposition and propagating conspiracy theories.
We‚Äôve known for some time that @Facebook chose to turn a blind eye to the spread of hate speech and Russian propaganda on its platform.

Regardless of whether or not the President will do this, it is the responsibility of every leader in this country to condemn these acts and do everything possible to promote civil and respectful discourse.
This is the time for the President to do all he can to bring our country together and to strongly condemn political violence of any kind.
Political violence has no place in the United States of America. The President should be doing everything he can to discourage violence and encourage respect and civility in our beautiful country.
Each of the people targeted in these attempted bombings is someone who the President has attacked in vicious terms at his rallies or on Twitter. That‚Äôs a fact that cannot be ignored.
Just days ago, he applauded a Republican Congressman for physically attacking a reporter who was doing his job.
The President has spent years stoking the flames of political violence. He has encouraged police brutality, refused to condemn the violent actions of Nazis, and offered to pay legal fees for any of his supporters who assaulted a protester.
I want to express my gratitude to the men and women of law enforcement who have already responded to these terrifying acts and are working right now to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators responsible.
These horrific acts of domestic terrorism have no place in America and must be condemned by every decent, civilized person in our country.
(Thread) During the past few days, explosive devices were delivered to two former Presidents of the United States, two sitting members of the U.S Congress, two former high-level cabinet officials, a news organization, and a progressive activist and philanthropist.

May God grant Senator McCain eternal rest and provide comfort to his family and loved ones.
In an era defined by partisanship, he broke ranks with his own party to oppose the use of torture by the Bush administration, expose the corrupt activities of Jack Abramoff, and to cast the deciding vote that preserved the Affordable Care Act last year.
He never hesitated to stand up to bullies and demagogues on either side of the aisle.
In Congress, Senator McCain continued his mission to serve and remained true to his convictions. He led the fight for campaign finance reform. He brought Republicans and Democrats together to try and fix our broken immigration system.
He is an American hero and a man of incredible, unbreakable courage.
He was beaten and tortured for days on end. He was left with scars and permanent physical injuries. But he maintained his faith and refused an offer of early release so he wouldn‚Äôt give his captors a propaganda victory.
America first learned his name during the five and a half years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
As the son and grandson of four-star admirals, he learned early in his life, the responsibility that all Americans have to put our country before ourselves.
John McCain‚Äôs life was a testament to his belief in public service and his enduring commitment to the founding values of our country. He made service to his country the cause of his life and like all Rhode Islanders, I am very sad to learn of his passing.

National security officials are warning about Russia attacking our democracy today. The President is Tweeting about his (artificially-inflated) poll numbers from Rasmussen. 		Obvious question - why is @realDonaldTrump afraid to confront Vladimir Putin?
Disgusted by today‚Äôs White House press briefing. Why won‚Äôt @PressSec say the media is not ‚Äúthe enemy of the people?‚Äù
This is a TERRIBLE comparison. Obama put fancy mustard on his burger, Trump is trying to disenfranchise poor people, young adults, and minorities with Voter ID laws. NOT THE SAME THING!!! https://t.co/qEQgUOm6yo

My full statement on #TrumpKimSummit #SingaporeSummit‚Å†‚Å†. 		It‚Äôs critical that the President reach an agreement that ends with Kim Jong Un giving up his nuclear weapons. https://t.co/J1UtoACzrE
@JonLifeRI Of course.
@JonLifeRI Please read my full statement.  Hopefully you will no longer think I‚Äôve lost my senses.
However, a deal that leaves North Korea with nuclear weapons capabilities is no deal at all, and the President must be willing to walk away if necessary.
I hope that the President will be able to achieve an agreement that will lead to a safer, more peaceful world for all Americans.
The President decided to hold this summit without meaningful concessions from the North Korean regime, giving Kim Jong Un a huge propaganda victory, so far with nothing in return.
Our commitment to our allies ‚Äì South Korea, Japan, and others in the region ‚Äì must be clear and unwavering.
Finally, any agreement must be achieved within the context of the United States‚Äô continued support for our regional allies, who face the most immediate threat from North Korean aggression.
These attacks are a growing threat to the world. If North Korea wants to come in from the cold, they cannot continue these aggressive activities.
Last year, they used ransomware to attack more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, causing as much as $4 billion in lost economic activity.
Third, North Korea continues to pose an urgent threat to our country in the field of cyberspace. Nearly four years ago, they hacked and released private messages between employees at Sony Pictures.
The United States cannot normalize relations with a government that systemically starves, tortures, and brutalizes its own people.
Pregnant women are violently forced to have abortions by having motor oil injected into their wombs.
People are tortured for their religious faith.
There are as many as 130,000 people languishing in North Korea‚Äôs gulags today.
Second, any agreement should include a framework for punishing North Korea for its widespread human rights abuses and ultimately bringing them to an end.
We cannot continue to live under the shadow of a nuclear threat from North Korea.
Any agreement must include strong provisions for weapons inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to have full access to ensure North Korea‚Äôs compliance. North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons are a grave threat to the United States.
First, the President needs to negotiate an agreement that results in North Korea giving up their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs.
It‚Äôs critical that the President succeed in advancing our national security goals and not hand the North Koreans huge, one-sided concessions just so he can say he got a deal.
The North Korean regime is one of the most brutal on the face of the earth. They have repeatedly promised to destroy the United States and our allies with nuclear weapons.
(Thread) Like all Americans, I hope that the President‚Äôs meeting with Kim Jong Un tonight proves successful.

Countries like North Korea now have even more reason to question whether President Trump won‚Äôt just change the terms of any current or future agreements when he feels like it. That will make us less respected across the world, and it does nothing to make us safer at home.
In addition, the President‚Äôs decision undermines the United States‚Äô reputation. We have always kept our word, but that changed today.
For two years, the Iran deal has imposed the most intrusive nuclear inspections regime in the history of the world. It has prevented Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. It is not perfect, but the President‚Äôs decision will make it harder than ever to improve it.
This is a reckless decision. It‚Äôs a decision that endangers our security and makes it harder for other countries to take us at our word.
It is outrageous that President Trump wants to cut $7 billion in health care funding for kids in the name of ‚Äúfiscal responsibility.‚Äù Working families shouldn‚Äôt pay for the huge tax cuts the President just gave to corporate special interests and the wealthiest Americans.
The Trump administration‚Äôs new policy of separating children from their parents at the border is cruel, inhumane, and just plain wrong. It should be - and will be - vigorously opposed.

Father Pat has provided me thoughtful counsel and guidance over the years. He‚Äôs respected by members of both parties and all religious traditions. He embodies the Jesuit values of intellectual rigor and, especially, caring for the vulnerable and poor.

This is not just reckless, it‚Äôs also illegal. I‚Äôve been pushing for a thorough debate on the proper use of military force since I came to Congress, and I will continue to do so.
The President is required under the Constitution to come to Congress to seek authorization for the use of military force. Tonight, the President ordered sustained military strikes against the Assad regime without the required approval.
The Assad regime‚Äôs use of chemical weapons is horrific and demands a strong and effective response from the United States and the civilized world.

The President must consult with Congress, as required by the Constitution, and then work with our international allies to develop an appropriate response to Assad's atrocities.
.@realDonaldTrump does not have legal standing to unilaterally attack the Assad regime, something I reminded him of last year when I led a letter with almost 70 congressional colleagues warning him to seek proper authorization.
This President's foreign policy has been reckless, uncoordinated, and combative, without any articulated guiding principles or strategy. This is not the way to respond to Assad's war crimes.
We are already seeing this. President @realDonaldTrump is now threatening to attack the Syrian government, just days after he announced that the U.S. was pulling out of the country completely.
What can't happen is a knee-jerk reaction that entangles the U.S. military further in the Syrian civil war, without a clearly defined strategy for victory or an end-goal.
The chemical weapons attack carried out by the Assad government was heinous and deserves a comprehensive, and coordinated response by the international community.

Democrats just want infants to get health care, people who got hit by a hurricane to get relief, and children not to be deported. This isn‚Äôt complicated. It‚Äôs really simple.
Republicans don‚Äôt see it that way. They see these really basic tasks as bargaining chips. So they‚Äôve decided to shut down the government AGAIN.
All Democrats want to do is to make sure the government keeps doing the same basic things it did before Republicans took power. Things like providing disaster relief, health insurance for kids, and a real budget.
Here‚Äôs where we are: Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but they are incapable of governing.

Rather than trying to make it more difficult to participate in our democracy, we should all be working together in a bipartisan way to protect our democratic institutions, prevent foreign interference in our elections, and expand voter participation.
President Trump tried to build on these efforts, but tonight he was forced to end his efforts to make it more difficult for Americans to vote by dissolving his bogus voter fraud commission.

Republicans spent yesterday celebrating a tax bill that robs money from the middle class and gives it to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Today, they failed to address any of the urgent needs facing working people.

It's critical that the Special Counsel's investigation be allowed to continue without interference or delay.
That cannot happen. Honoring the rule of law is more important than our political differences.
In recent days, the President and Republicans have tried to pressure on the Special Counsel to separate himself from this investigation.
...including conspiracy against the United States.
A federal grand jury has found probable cause that President Trump's former campaign manager committed crimes...
These are very serious charges. https://t.co/srxjgLFR3P

This Republican budget does just the opposite.
We should be enacting a budget that promotes real economic growth and helps create good-paying jobs.

... lowering prescription drug costs; breaking up corporate monopolies; and expanding job training opportunities.
That means investing in good-paying jobs; raising wages; rebuilding our bridges, roads, and schools....
Democrats are fighting to give working people A Better Deal.
The wealthy have done extremely well in recent years. This budget is a great deal for them, but it‚Äôs a raw deal for working men and women.
Republicans are doing all this just so they can give millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations a huge tax cut.
And it raises taxes on the middle class.
It cuts funding for affordable college by $100 billion.
It cuts mandatory transportation funding by $200 billion.
The budget Republicans passed today cuts Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $1.5 trillion.
If a budget is a statement of your values, this shows Washington Republicans don‚Äôt give a damn about working people. https://t.co/MdszL7Bp4z
