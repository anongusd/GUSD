Thank you all, and may God continue to shower his blessings on the Commonwealth of Virginia!
Together, I know we will.
...will always have the opportunity to raise themselves in the world by their God given talents and their labor.
...where any man and any woman, of any race and any creed, from any beginning and any place...
Our job over the next 60 days is to enact policies that will help ensure that this remains a Commonwealth...
We are a nation that rightly guarantees opportunities, not outcomes.
Facebook and Twitter (!! -staff) replace texts, which replaced emails, which replaced phone calls.
You arrive here today at a particularly pivotal moment in the life of our Commonwealth and our country.
We must transition more individuals from institutions to community based care. It’s the right thing to do.
Now, in this new budget, I am asking you to put another $30 million into mental health.
We will continue our recent work to dramatically improve mental health funding.
Over the past decade, state spending has grown 23 percent faster than the rate of growth in population and inflation.
We must also continue to reform state government to make it more efficient and effective, or as Mr. Jefferson said, more “wise and frugal.”
Making Virginia “The Energy Capital of the East Coast” will create more jobs and revenues for our citizens.
We must continue to demand that the fed govt stop the overreach & overregulation of our important job-creating coal & natural gas industries
I urge the Obama Administration to end the delays and act now to include Virginia in the 2012-17 Outer Continental Shelf Plan.
America needs the energy and Virginians need the jobs.
We passed legislation in 2010, with strong bipartisan support, approving offshore drilling.
Fifty miles off our shores are oil and gas deposits that can be accessed in a responsible manner.
An important part of our nation’s energy solution is here in Virginia.
More domestic energy production equals more American job creation and greater energy security.
That starts with pursuing an “all of the above; red, white and blue” approach to energy production by utilizing all of our resources.
We will step up our efforts to make Virginia “The Energy Capital of the East Coast.”
Over 90 percent of offenders get out of prison, and we don’t want them going back. We want more good citizens and fewer victims.
We are a remarkable nation of second chances.
..., we will provide them with positive opportunities for change through effective prisoner re-entry policies.
For those released from prison, who have learned from their mistakes...
This year, I am proposing tough new laws to put away repeat drug dealers for longer periods of time.
If people aren’t safe and secure in their neighborhoods, businesses will not locate there, and our communities will not prosper.
Providing for public safety is one of the top duties of government at every level.
I am also proposing we enhance our cash reserves by doubling the Rainy Day Fund to over $600 million by the end of FY 2014.
Rather, it forces state govt to set priorities, live within its means and plan for the future, something I wish our federal govt would do
The budget does not raise taxes.  http://t.co/XdlwZO63
That is what I have tried to do in the introduced budget.
While we cannot control what Congress or Europe do, we must prepare as well as possible for the future changes that are certain to come.
Uncertainty is the new certainty.
Last summer, we all collectively held our breaths as we watched the debt limit fight in Washington.
...and I look forward to working with you to enact them this session.
In the days ahead, I will announce a number of specific VRS reform proposals to ensure long term solvency...
I will not pass this problem on to another governor. You cannot pass this problem on to another General Assembly.
It is also time that we address, head on, the hard realities of our woefully underfunded state pension system.
...then we just aren’t serious about maintaining our infrastructure.
If we can’t find the resolve to use just one-eighth of one percent of our budget for additional transportation maintenance funding...
Transportation is a core function of government. We must treat it like one.
Last year’s major new transportation construction funding bill was significant. But more must be done.
Our economy cannot grow if people and products cannot move.
I am asking you to invest over $200 million in new funding for our colleges and universities.
The goal of all of proposals is simple: at high school graduation, every student who receives a diploma must be college- or career-ready.
A child's educational opportunities should be determined by her intellect and work ethic, not by her neighborhood or zip code.
I’m asking you to provide a tax credit for companies that contribute to an educational scholarship fund to help more of our young people
We should also create effective choices for low-income students.
We all know strong teachers who deserve to be better recognized for invaluable roles they play in the development learning of our students
It is time to repeal the state mandate that school divisions begin their school term after Labor Day unless they receive a waiver.
This budget will provide new funding, but we will also seek more accountability, choice, rigor and innovation. http://t.co/hH2tzs8l
Our work starts with finding work for the 260,000 Virginians who are currently unemployed.
And we must pass a fiscally responsible, structurally balanced budget on time.
We must improve our transportation maintenance system now, so that our citizens can get to their jobs and families without delay.
We must complete higher education reform and reinvestment now, so that more Virginia students can access and afford college.
We must make our K-12 education system more accountable and innovative now, so all our students get a world-class education.
We must reform our pension system now, so that it will be there for the hundreds of thousands of Virginians depending on it.
We must do more now to spur private-sector job creation.
But this is not a status quo period in the life of Virginians and Americans, therefore this cannot be a status quo session.
These are collective, bipartisan accomplishments. Virginia is charting a fiscally responsible course to a brighter future.
We turned two massive budget shortfalls into nearly $1 billion in surpluses.
Working together we eliminated $6 billion in budget shortfalls not by raising taxes, but by reforming government and reducing spending.
Our trade missions are getting results. Last month alone 1 ship left Chesapeake and delivered $25mm worth of Virginia soybeans to China.
Over 56,000 more jobs have been created in Virginia since our first full month in office.
Together we’ve created nearly $100 million in new economic development incentives to promote job creation.
We created together a path to award 100,000 more degrees in the next 15 years in job creating disciplines.
As a result, over $4 billion in new funding was provided in our six-year plan to support highway and rail projects.
Working across party lines last year we put the most new funding into transportation in a generation.
We will continue to make this the most veteran-friendly state in America. You serve Virginia, we serve you.
I propose that we provide in-state tuition for all members of the Virginia National Guard, regardless of how long they’ve lived here.
Thank you for your deep commitment to freedom.
Over 230 Virginians have given their lives in the Global War on Terror.
Since September 11th, 2001, nearly 14,000 members of the Virginia National Guard have left their families and jobs to defend our freedom.
That same spirit of service has also been displayed by Virginians on the field of battle.
...so that all qualified first responders and their families receive key benefits in their time of need, not later.
The heroism of Officer Crouse and Trooper Hamer is why I am supporting a review of, and necessary amendments to, the Line of Duty Act.
Now, it is our duty to lead this Republic into a prosperous future.
The early leaders who guided the young American Republic through its infancy and into the mature, global power we are today were from here.
We are blessed to live in a Commonwealth with an unemployment rate that is the lowest in the Southeast.
This session we must remember that while seating charts and committee assignments may have changed, the Virginia Way cannot.
Congratulations to the newly elected members of the GA and the new caucus leaders. Thank you for your service to Virginia and her people.
This is always a very special night, when the leaders of all 3 branches of govt are gathered in a building designed by Thomas Jefferson

Highest winds Matthews Co. 80mph+, Richmond 70mph+. 2/3 of state affected by storm.
Higher rain/winds away from coast than at coast. 16"+ 50-60mi inland. 460 corridor very hard hit.
Local govt officials have done an outstanding job. First responders, EMS, etc. have been tremendous.
