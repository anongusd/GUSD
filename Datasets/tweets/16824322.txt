@TwitterSupport I‚Äôve been waiting for months for a resolution to a double billing issue. Please advise why no one is getting back to me even after my ticket has been escalated! @drewhouston please help.
@DropboxSupport Thanks. I‚Äôll be waiting!
@DropboxSupport I can‚Äôt believe I have to tweet at you again for a double billing issue. I was told my issue was escalated over a week ago and I have heard nothing. Please advise!
The story of #munchery‚Äôs downfall is so infuriating, and so similar to #fyrefestival‚Äôs utter disregard for the local makers who really are responsible for turning VC-funded vision into reality. Hugs to @ThreeBabesBake  https://t.co/Jcn23J66gj
Congrats to @lmclaug and the @workithealth team!! https://t.co/Lw4gghSqHF
@DropboxSupport Awesome thank you!
@DropboxSupport I will reply to reopen the ticket and hopefully this is resolved. I was told my your phone reps that no supervisor can help me. This has been very frustrating and clearly 3 months of frustration, just trying not to get double billed
@DropboxSupport I‚Äôve tried this a number of times and was told that reseller support needs to be contacted but I am not the reseller so I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone. I need this resolved somehow. It‚Äôs the same company, @dropbox charging me twice for the same account.
@DropboxSupport Yes we took over the account in November and yes before the renewal date
@DropboxSupport Ticket number 8722936 - I was told when I asked to transition he account that the reseller would not be billed for the remaining contract because I have taken it over, and the reseller is telling me you will not honor that. Thanks for your help!!
@DropboxSupport need help! My account was transitioned from a reseller account to direct and now I‚Äôm getting double-billed. I‚Äôve exhausted all customer service options via email with zero help. Not acceptable to double bill me.
