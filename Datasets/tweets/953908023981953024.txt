TRUMP did not come up with that I assure you. His mind was on the TV &amp; COHEN. His Senior Advisors told him that! He was not paying attention to the summit!

3/ went too far this time! Americans are not willing to put up with GOP CRAP after the  past 2 years of  NOTHING!  With this action? They might as well realize it will be a BLUE SENATE in 2020!  Americans are pissed at the REPUBLICANS actions and non-actions! 🧐🚔⏲️🕵️‍♂️
2/ What we saw demonstrated at the hearing is an extension of the Kavanaugh Hearing. Performance for the President by the NUNES GROUP a/k/a GOP Freedom Caucus @freedomcaucus Jordan, Meadows, Gaetz, etc. This group is strong against DEMS! As they demonstrated. But I think they
KOCH BROS state they are pulling out from TRUMP for 2020. BUT that means nothing knowing their money is in many organizations still. It's getting too hot 4 them!

6/ White House later apologized 4 this STUNT! SOME STUNT! Trump said he  would U. S. Steel Companies. Well, guess who owns a U. S. Steel Company? Trump Family Friend &amp; Russian Oligarch Abramovich. Good friends w/PUTIN! That's all I need to know! How about you? #NoWall @NewYorkFBI https://t.co/vWVVxYFOf1
5/ RUSSIAN STEEL for his supporter's snake oil wall. Family Russian Oligarch, friend, Roman Abramovich owns Evraz North America and  Evraz PLC with offices in U.S. &amp; Canada. He imported Russian Steel in Keystone Pipeline when it was supposed to be Made-in-America Keystone! 🧐 https://t.co/4uIJD3lKhx
4/ Another figment of his imagination as there is not confirmation of MEX paying for a WALL in documentation or verbally. More Fraud by TRUMP in attempt to get Americans 2 pay 4 his SUPPORTERS SNAKE OIL WALL they fell for!   Trump intends to use ....  #StopTrumpShutdown 🧐 https://t.co/d6t8rlHxlR
3/ Fraudulent Lies that Mex would pay for a "Snake Oil" wall promised by Trump (Prophet Gift) to get VOTES. He continued to fraud into the Presidency with LIES that MEX would pay for his supporters snake oil wall.  He contends MEX would pay 4 wall through Canada/Mex Trade Deal.🧐 https://t.co/AUO6n8zRCi
2/🚨Americans don't attack Americans.🚨Dictators attack their People (Assad). This is a shutdown by a criminal who caused Campaign FRAUD against his supporters as "Prophet Gift" with "Snake Oil." He did not own or have control of a wall to be paid by Mexico.....🧐 https://t.co/Jf3cASaRn3
🧐Republicans have gotten all they are going to get out of Trump Presidency. In order to save their party (what's left) they need to IMPEACH TRUMP THEMSELVES!  OTHERWISE this shutdown is already putting DEMS ahead in the 2020 Election! Trump is attacking Americans!....🧐 https://t.co/rcEJeboicI

Fred, I agree with you. It isn't the answer. I believe more eyes on Campus and TV Monitors which are manned could possibly deter another horrific crime. Maybe surveillance drones?

4/ But 2 keep the Press Corp legitimate? They need 2 stick together &amp; hold 2 the TRUTH &amp; not the slosh pond scum coming out of her mouth. I'd hate to see them get into trouble but? Maybe if the Press Sec calls 4 a briefing? They can all agree NOT 2 SHOW UP? Or maybe send one 🧐🗞️
3/ to the People as part of the 1st Amendment. Not to be an extension cord of Fox News, Brietbart, Sinclair, etc. If they do not walk out I expect them to say "YOU ARE LYING Ms. Press Sec." "That is simply NOT THE TRUTH and YOU KNOW IT!" They will probably be banned doing it.🧐🗞️
2/for the Office of Presidency or Press Sec Much Less NO RESPECT for Press Corp &amp; the 1st Amendment! . I believe in the Golden Rule. They are way past overdue! The Press Corp should agree to walk out every time she LIES to the PUBLIC. It's the Press Corp job to report the truth
Brian, I've been hoping they would do something in response to those LIES, Conspiracy Theorist Answers, Alternative Truth, etc. They placate this President &amp; Press Sec which they shouldn't.

Roy Cohen, Trump's Gay Friend, Mentor &amp; Attorney (deceased of HIV/Aids 1986) would have told Trump to NEVER run 4 office 4 one main reason! Income Tax Returns! Trump is a failure at everything he does &amp; expects the people around him to bail him out! https://t.co/W9LdSQTvQK

@cartereducation @TheEconomist This is a swamp compared to TRUMPS FULL POND SCUM?🧐 I don't think so!

U do realize quoting scripture is not going 2 save U from the depths of Hell? U are taking blood money from the NRA. The NRA is a International Terrorist Organization as far as the People are concerned. Who else do you get donations from? Koch Bros? Mercer? Heritage? SCF? ACU?🧐 https://t.co/bNyldc6U1m
@senatemajldr American People expect U 2 put the BILL 2 protect the People's Russian Investigation by Mueller 2 the Senate Floor! That's what we expect out of U! U are undermining the Rule of Law by protecting TRUMP by blocking this bill! DO YOUR JOB! Put it thru! Protect the People/Country!😠
6/  CAMPS. NO. The People DO NOT WANT A  USELESS WALL! He better be happy with the wire the troops put up. Period! Let him shut the govt down! Call his bluff. NO WALL. He lost that deal when Mexico wouldn't pay for it!  LIAR. CON. How much more suffering do we have to take?🧐
5/ the reason later but they still went under false allegation of invasion. This isn't play games. This man should be charged for these things! NO WALL EITHER! He blew it with the troops, Tariffs and TAX SCAM BILL. He took hurricane recovery money 2 pay 4 ICE DETENTION
4/ as well for causing fraud w/national mayhem and disturbance to American People. Telling people there is an invasion and there isn't one is against the Law. Will Mueller tack that on? Along with the Fraud spending of sending TROOPS under false allegations? Gen Mattis changed
3/ We just want this over with. We all are growing old faster than we want! AND his "Our Country is being Invaded" was horrible. Little old ladies believed him. They thought Lepers &amp; Smallpox were coming! Isn't that inciting mayhem which is against the law? Fox should be charged
2/ knew about the Russian Meeting  I said oops......he's gonna get caught on that one. I thought I read someone has already testified Trump knew about the Tower meeting. I'm sure the Family meeting at Camp David was to get their stories straight. BET CIA has that down somewhere.
Mark, are they saying Manafort was a mole while he was supposed to be cooperating with Mueller? That's outrageous! There has to be more charges coming. I mean Manafort just doesn't quit being a criminal. He keeps on ticking! When I read about Trump answering and denying he https://t.co/M8qipfWjMq
9/ Hope they are successful with this case in Florida. Thx for sharing article #MeToo #StopSexualAssault #StopRape All of Epstein's victims and Trump has a good list of victims himself with 19 women. I see why he and Trump are friends &amp; both Sexual Predators. @SenSchumer @jahimes
8/ @FBIMiamiFL @CIA State Senator Lauren Book @Book4Senate @Senator_Book @FBIJacksonville How is Epstein out of Prison? He should have gotten life. My Lord. He must have had stuff on BIG names! This is so sad. AND it makes me MAD justice wasn't served again! @RepJoeKennedy
7/ Acosta must know about Trump &amp; NY lawsuit? Surely, he knows about New York. This is horrible. I certainly hope he doesn't plan on Attorney General position!  @SenFeinstein already knows about him from previous vetting. #TicTocTicToc @TheJusticeDept @FBI @FBIWFO @RepAdamSchiff
6/ I've always worried Trump &amp; Epstein had something to do with the 3,000 missing children from the border. Horrible thought. But considering what we know.....why wouldn't I think that!  I hope Katie is okay. Makes me sick to know about Acosta! @SecretaryAcosta #Acosta #Assault
5/ Donnie deep in this as well.  I don't know how they kept this quiet or why the Press kept the Katie Johnson case quiet since it happened 2016. She had to get paid off to disappear like she did. Lisa Bloom represented her in NY. I have pic of Katie &amp; Lisa Bloom too. https://t.co/g93OJ9D375
4/  Prosecutor got out of the deal for Epstein in Florida for what he allowed him and his attorney to get away with! I hope they go after them all!. Unbelievable! The article mentioned one girl worked at Maralago. There's a tie 2 Trump &amp; Epstein in Florida as well as New York! https://t.co/dJndlVHUsL
3/ his trafficking girls in New York too. I read what he did to Katie and it was hard reading. I think it's still online under Jane Doe v. Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein (2016 New York). She was 13 and described Epstein's  condo. See picture attached. I wonder what the https://t.co/Aw6En12ef9
2/ We still don't know what happened to Katie after she filed her lawsuit in NY 2016 &amp; dismissed it in around Oct 2016 Election time. I assumed Trump or Cohen paid her off or Epstein paid her off too 2 drop the suit since Trump was running 4 President. Surely, Florida knows about https://t.co/v7eQJT0xZG
Gosh Patty, this sounds just like he did to Katie Johnson in New York.  Katie filed lawsuit against Trump &amp; Epstein. Trump was the one who took her virginity and Epstein was mad bc he wanted her first. They told her they were modeling executives. And a girl recruited her too. https://t.co/j6eJoPVWaJ
Well, we do too Jim......but does he do anything that is politically correct? Or non-politically correct? I don't think he should make his decisions on his personal future business w/Saudi's by putting himself before Country &amp; People either!

4/ The better off this country will be . But since there is no empathy in his bloodline? He exhibits ccwardess to the American People. WE expect something to be done against this PRINCE or we are nothing but weak cowards like our LEADER. #SaudiArabiaSanctions
3/  they would have an attachment to the real crime. This way they don't have to take responsibility or accountability of how Trump is responding to this MURDEROUS CRIME of the PRINCE of Saudi Arabia. NO AMOUNT of money is worth a person's life! The sooner TRUMP realizes that?

5/ 🚔him any loans. him any loans. He had no choice but to get in bed with Russian Mob bc local MOB wanted nothing to do with him either because he was a liability w/out Roy Cohn. Trump needed to maintain the TRUMP visage hence the Russians found a puppet for money laundering.
4/ 🚔Nothing good in his "HOPE CHEST". His Roy Cohn School of MOB CONS died with Roy (his lifetime Gay Mob Mentor who died of HIV/AIDS)  Once Roy died Trump did not know how to survive in the MOB world. Hence the multiple bankruptcies and banks dropping &amp; refusing to give
