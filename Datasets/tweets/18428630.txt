Lynch: "they're afraid you're going to tell the truth"
Nice start, Mr. Lynch.
So every Republican is just going to point out that Cohen, who has admitted to lying, has lied in the past.		Again, none of them have had a problem with the multiple Republican/administration people who have had to later "amend" their testimonies for not telling the truth.

Another GOPer: "I shall ask a question, but not let the witness answer the question!"		Are they capable of doing anything other than posture?
The GOPers seem to be creating a situation in which they're effectively saying someone who takes responsibility and admits wrongdoing and pleads guilty... shouldn't be trusted or believed?
Republican Congressmen seem to have a lot of issues with liars and untrustworthy people. And yet, whenever someone on their side has to re-submit or amend testimony multiple times, they're indifferent.

Which really just makes the GOP look terrible, and even complicit. They KNOW he‚Äôs guilty of something illegal. They just want to kick the ball far enough down the road to reap all possible benefits of having someone in office who they think they can manipulate/handle.
Dems are salivating for the day the investigation‚Äôs findings are announced. GOP is terrified and trying to keep it schtum for as long as possible. Nobody (credible) is saying there‚Äôs nothing to find, so let‚Äôs just let Mueller finish and then move on.
Has anyone else pointed out that basically everyone thinks Trump is guilty of *something* illegal? Even Republicans. An investigation can turn up nothing - but nobody is acting as if it‚Äôs going to uncover *nothing*. Everyone acts as if there is a lot of criminality to find.

It has been pointed out that Trump didn‚Äôt win 50% of the country. True. But neither did Bill Clinton (43% &amp; 49%) and he appointed Ginsburg &amp; Breyer. More parties = higher chance that Pres won‚Äôt get 50%. Would their appointees be illegitimate?
This has become a larger conversation, with people bringing in the electoral margins and how there only being 2 parties is a problem. This highlights how making simple bumper-sticker arguments is a problem.

@jessicajlee Jeff Flake is the new McCain for the US media. They are SO desperate to believe there is a reasonable, intelligent member of the GOP who will put country over party. They love Flake, even though (like Corker, Murkowski, Collins) they have DONE nothing to justify.
He's declared his intention to vote for Kavanagh. He either doesn't care about the investigation's result, or he knows there's no chance an investigation will take place quickly enough to have any impact on the vote. This is more posturing to make him seem like a good guy. https://t.co/4GChnwstxi
If he thinks the FBI should investigate, it's because he thinks there might be something there. Wouldn't a rational person say, "Let's investigate, THEN I'll let you know how I think I'll vote"?
Ok. But you're still committed to vote for him...? I'm very confused about your thought processes: I'm declaring my intention to vote for the sexual predator, who I think may well be a sexual predator, so let's get the FBI to investigate him, m'okay?		This is just bizarre. https://t.co/gsoqcAwHFK
