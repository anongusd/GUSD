@UntapDraw @kanyewest I respectfully disagree. As many treaties, such as Alfred and Guthrum, demanded at least conversion of the king, if not the whole kingdom. This was to put the land under control of the church. 	And revolts happened against universal Christain control, like Redbad.
@UntapDraw @kanyewest In other words, to control the masses under the Kings selected by ‘Divine Right.’ 	He’s the king because god wanted it, don’t question god or you don’t go to heaven.
@UntapDraw @kanyewest I should have said bloomed not took root. As I used the fall of Lithuania to Christianity, and the king already converted. To be honest, I didn’t think I would spend this mich time on it, or else I would have thought my wording out better.
@kevmangrum @kanyewest Because my post has two time periods. Pre-Written history and the Middle-ages. The first part was saying all original human tribes are African. Period. Biblical or not. 	Two the last Pagan white nations fell in the middle ages. (Officially, because the king converted earlier)

@belchovskiSSPX I said the middle ages because that is when Lithuania offically converted. Although 966 is when Mieszko (the king) converted.
@mommydoing @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Respectfully, I disagree. And once I start studying Indian history, I am sure I will discover far more than impact from there then I am ready for.
@belchovskiSSPX Lets go. 1100 to 1453 was the middle ages. Alfred the great great was 886 to 899. He untied England under Christendom.

@FactMachine411 @kanyewest Damn, everyone is white but black people. What is that called again? 🤔🤔
@parzifal69 @AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Quaker were the white people who spoke out about slavery. The church and all of white Christendom misstreated and opressed the first white people who tried speaking out. (This related to my orginal post about white people using the bible.) Now truly Laa Korn.
@AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest So... I am really have to explain this to you? Naw. ;) Its cool, Laa korn.
@parzifal69 @AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Where did I say that? I said more Quakers are in Africa, as in now. (Keyna) And well slavery was abolished first in Pennsylvania, Mexico actually outlawed slavery before the USA. 	Now that of course brings Spain and the slaughter of Native Americans and Latino history.
@CaliggyJack @kanyewest Christianity is what joined the warring tribes in France and Britian. (This is what Alfred did, thus why I mentioned him)
@parzifal69 @AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Again, your posts shows you know nothing about Quakers.	You’re arguement is pointless because of the Quaker’s own believes.
@AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Bahahaha ^ You don’t know many Friends. 		Friends were opressed and murdered by a different standard that arised after the ‘fall’ of feudalism. Or are you ignoring the economic overhaul?
@RedEye_Ink @kanyewest I mentioned Constantine in another post. :) I was shorthanding a very complex situation.
@AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest No actually Quakers were. And currently there are more Quakers in Africa than the rest of the world. 	The isolated Pics and the northmen had slaves way before they ever encounted the silk road.
@CaliggyJack @kanyewest Rome wasn’t Christian then, they were still pagan. It was way after they pulled from Brit that they converted. 		Durning the time of Alfred the Great much of Britian was still pagan.
@AugustusOctav10 @Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Gun powder. Without it European steel is inferior to what was coming from China. (Nods to India in this context 🔥)
@Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Or as my PorPor said, ‘White man invent gun like I invent dumpling.’
@Math_Schmidt00 @kingpeter88 @kanyewest Prob because White people enslaved half the world using China’s inventions. Think of how differently history would be if the silk road was banned like the church demanded. No gun powder, no empires.
@SpicyFiles You called? 😂😂😂 		(What good is having the last name if you can’t be punny with it.)
@OneNigerianGirl @kanyewest Exactly. 		Even the parts the bible that take place in the mediterranean the people were more deep olive than many people think. 	Constantine even moved the capital of Rome closer to Europe right as Christianity became Rome’s offical religion.
@kanyewest I should say this is from a Historical stand point. I am talking migration patterns and anthropology, not biblical content.
@17wwg1wga @kanyewest Before or after the Council of Nicea and Constantine, who was the obsessed with Europe rewrote the bible?
@kingpeter88 @kanyewest Of course. However, I am not Christians myself, so I believe Africa to be the cradle of civilization (where we are all from) but the middleeast, Egypt, and China created society.  	Look at the middle aged Europe vs China. Who looks more blessed, following divine right?
@GlobalExpulsion @kanyewest Never said they were black. Middleeastern is not white. (Or should I say they are only white when they are in the bible, if they are Muslim they are brown.)
@kanyewest Two? Baby, no one in the bible was white. That just what white people told everyone so they could claim divine right. Why do you think Christianity took root in middle aged Europe, where the feudalism was based on if god loved you enough for you to be born in the right family?

@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 No you removed the democratic part and started calling her socialist. That is a GOP move and part of gaslighting the left.
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 Out of the three Justice dems that won only AOC was a DSA member. What about Ilhan? 	Justice Democrats was founded with a practical mission to rebuild the Democratic party and run corruption-free Democratic congressional campaigns that lead to a progressive and un-bought congress

@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 That's your first problem. Not all progressives as Democrat socialists. Ojeda isn’t close. And in Maine we had a full blown communist run for under Dems, that doesn’t mean we all are. 😂😂😂
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 And progressive policies also do better with the large voter block in the country. The disabled. 		Look at the neurodiversity in the youth movement and embracing the sensory issues of their fellow protesters. Have you even thought about what 1:64 children being neurodiverse means
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 These pockets like Cooleemee NC have are picking ground. Look at what Stacy Abrams is talking about, about progressives in the south. Why her, Gullum, and Ojeda close the gap far more than establishment candidates in deep red districts.
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 Much of the the poor and POC in the south don’t vote. This is hugely due to voter suppression. Progressive policy do better in high poverty, high diversity areas. And while this is largely urban, you forget the large packets of minorities in the south that settled AFTER the CW.
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 I disagree and how much Ojeda closed the gap in WV shows. 	I am in the rural south, if you think OC is deep red, you’re loco homie. And I grew up in LA. Born in Duarte. Now,  I live in the part of NC that is known for the mass lynchings in the 50’s.
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 How is it counter productive to go after dems that vote with Republicans more than dems? Or men like the #FiveWhiteMen who create discord and actually challenge leadership. (where else, AOC and the other Jutice Dems like Ilhan, have come out to in support if Pelosi)
@J_P_BoomerDog @matthewjdowd @Ocasio2018 What are you talking about? Primaries are primaries. They are part of our election process, what you are saying is that we should cut out primaries and the party should choose the representative? Or it's just because she wants poor people to run and that is... Bad?

@toddwgreen @volodoscope @alizasongbird @TopRopeTravis @gis3330 @brycetache And I am not even talking about the sexism and racism in the people who view Bernie but not Lee as a huge threat.

@dwellman21 @alizasongbird @TopRopeTravis @gis3330 @brycetache No, saying that progressives call liberals evil and blame them for money in politics. Its not the Democrat’s system. Not since the 70’s and the party changes and you know, Stone and Manafort and lobbying. Which Teddy and Eleanor fixed once but, yeah, no one remembers 100 yrs ago.
@toddwgreen @volodoscope @alizasongbird @TopRopeTravis @gis3330 @brycetache Bernie brought progressives to the forefront.	People don’t attack Lee, who is more progessive. They attack Bernie and AOC. 	Why? Because people listen to them. Its the GOP laying these seeds and both progessives and liberal are watering them. 		https://t.co/l8LbjeJned

@JoeEDeyoung @BabiesFree @GoldenGirlsRu @CatskillJulie @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA Most of us who support Lee say, Hey a black woman speaker would be... Progressive. But if you guys say it's Nancy, okay, let's stay united for 2020.		Which almost sounds a little racist because I feel like should fight harder for black women. Damned if I do, damned if I don’t.
@JoeEDeyoung @BabiesFree @GoldenGirlsRu @CatskillJulie @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA I agree. I think she see’s Ryan’s game. She is smart and I do love her. 		Many of us want *but not demanding it, or threatening to burn down the party if we don’t* is Lee as speaker bc POC won the house. POC, especially black women, deserve the representation in leadership.
Never bet against a special needs mom, no matter how bad the odds, because we have probably faced worse. If I say we will flip the South blue before my daughter turns 18, then we will. #southernstrategy #ThursdayMotivation #southernprogressives
@EoinHiggins_ @ryangrim @Ocasio2018 @MikeElk U got a follower for that! ❤️
@GoldenGirlsRu @CatskillJulie @BabiesFree @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @JoeEDeyoung @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA There are live streams of the protest. (Come one you knew there were, dozens of teen and no phone filming? Yeah right.) 		She talks about unity, Pelosi being speaker and doing everything to help Pelosi to pass a new green deal she could. No down talking and no division.
@BabiesFree @GoldenGirlsRu @CatskillJulie @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @JoeEDeyoung @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA Pelosi thanked her for going, didn’t she?
@GoldenGirlsRu @CatskillJulie @BabiesFree @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @JoeEDeyoung @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA She showed up because people like David Hogg were tweeting no one is showing and we could have lost millions of youth voters on that slight. 		Almost 4 million teens turn 18 by 2020.		And then when there she promoted Pelosi as speaker to these youth.
@CatskillJulie @BabiesFree @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @GoldenGirlsRu @JoeEDeyoung @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA The same people that leaked ’Rally’ story keep sending her to spouse events. 		But being gaslighted but the GOP IS FUN!!
@CatskillJulie @BabiesFree @TalesofJonathan @ricardovg @GoldenGirlsRu @JoeEDeyoung @johnastoehr @ConorLambPA So people are throwing the woman under the bus for the same thing freshmen men are doing? That not sexist. AOC is being attacked hard by Paul Ryan, and you guys are following along. Good job doing the GOP’s dirty work for them. Look at how’s flunky leaked the ‘rally’ story. 👍
@Goss30Goss The entire Dem base attacking a freshmen congresswoman on her second day of orientation because of GOP lies IS creating division.
@Goss30Goss In fact, youth activist, like David Hogg, would have killed the dems and lost us many youth voters if no one showed. 		Instead of thanking her for thinking of the 4 million teens that turn 18 by 2020, you attacked her. 		Talking about giving POC a power position is not divison.
@Goss30Goss If Peloski is speaker, okay, Ocasio-Cortez came out for Pelosi to the protesters in Pelosi’s office. 		But people listened to Paul Ryan flunky’s twisted leaked and threw her under the bus like the Ryan wanted. She is NOT campaigning against Pelosi.
@Goss30Goss And I feel like not entertaining a POC as speaker is not fair to the millions of POC thst put dems back in power.		It’s great tk be proud of our diversity, so follow through.		I am not a troll or a bot, I am in the rural south and am not in a white liberal bubble.
@Goss30Goss My town has 700 people, there are two white vocal democrats. Cory, a gay 20 something man and me. 		I don’t want being yelled at by 698 people about Pelosi everyday for the next two years. 		And I don’t want my car keyed again.		And I want a BLACK woman as speaker.

@janet493 @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi BTW this ’Story’ was leaked by one of Paul Ryan’s lankies. 		So good job doing to Cortez what the GOP has been doing to Pelosi. That's some unity there.
@janet493 @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi Then again I am FOR getting the youth to vote and getting them active. So is Cortez. 		Unless the those 3.9 million kids turning 18 by 2020 mean nothing to you.
@janet493 @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi The ’Stunt’ wasn’t a ’Stunt’ but in response to young activists who were being ignored.

@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 Great keep going. That link again is https://t.co/Vv4hrzy4CO.
@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 Also Grammarly is great for editing on MSword or open office, but makes you look like an idiot on a phone.
@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 How about you do your own homework. Are you that lazy? I already the https://t.co/Vv4hrzy4CO link, you just need the drive and dedication to just do the work. What is wrong? I cram a course every 3-4 days plus the one's concurrently with the class. Plus work 60 hours a week.
@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 If you wanted to you could cram a course a day in rather than spread misinformation around. Philosophy with Superheroes is fun and a good break from monotonous classes like Microeconomics.
@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 Lying? Most of the world doesn’t divide the america’s into three parts. Like I said. https://t.co/Vv4hrzy4CO has free courses you NEED. It free, from both conservative and liberal colleges. Please, just educate yourself.
@mintyfreshh2 @TheRickyDavila @Katheri67707560 https://t.co/Vv4hrzy4CO has free courses you can take online from places like Yale and Princeton.

@somecomforting Many times former foster kids relate to this well. 	Take a kid from the poor inner city, sometimes from the streets, and put them in a million dollar home and tada quite victim.
I was so grateful to be taken from poverty I didn’t tell. 	I didn’t tell because I wanted the American Dream.
To this day, my stepmom doesn’t believe me because I waited soo long. 	Other times I was told I should have waited until I had ’proof’. 	I was placed in foster care and back in poverty, which I barely keep myself out of now.
By the time it was worse than the poverty it had already been years, five to be exact.	When I ran my wrists were raw and bleeding from trying to get out of the handcuffs he used.	Because of the wrists, he pleads to ONE charge of child abuse and had to be registered as an offender
I told a friend first, wrote it in a role-playing notebook, which was taken and read by a teacher. That was at 13, eighth grade. It would still be two years before I got away. 	I spent the early morning of 9/11/2001 naked tied to a bed. Talk about 9/11 being a trigger.
(3) while going and getting ice cream. 	But I had dinner every night, normally going out to a restaurant. I had clean, expensive, clothes. No lice, no begging my friends for their leftover lunches to take home, no praying I was invited to stay for dinner.
(2)I was ten when he started grooming me. It was confusing because it would include something I saw as good along with the abuse. Grinding against me with an erection during a tickle fight. 	Putting his hand high up on my thigh while driving so every bump made his pinky touch me,
(1) I was groomed and sexually abused by my father. 	I #BelieveSurviors because for almost three years I never told because my father married a woman that inherited a large amount of money. I didn’t know if the abuse from my father or the poverty my mom lived in was worse.

@its_a_trapppppp @IndivisibleTeam @RepJayapal See, most restaurants are owned by large corporations, like Darden, which are often shells for much larger corps. So they won't allow their managers to hire without citizenship or a green card.

@virtualgeof @cspan @SenateGOP @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain Is that 5% growth worth institutionalizing 1 in 64 children because they have #Autism. You really want to go pre-SSI for children?
RT @abowersock: Here you go. Wanna trash these guys too @SenWarren ? Medicare - who needs it! #TaxScamBill https://t.co/scZXjZq7KT
In 2022 SSI disability will run out of money. How much is going to be cut in 2022 to cover a trillion dollar deficit? #TaxScamBill

@trumpencexual And yet all of non of that is a war crime. The genocide of the disabled of America by cutting the programs that keep them alive is.

@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorHeitkamp https://t.co/J6ikrgEnfH remember how in 2011 Obama's deficit was the worst thing in the world. You are giving this money to the rich.
@SenJohnMcCain You state has been working on inclusion. Why are you doing this to the disabled in your state?
@SenJohnMcCain You state has done great thing to help the differently able people in the last few years. Don't change that now. #notaxplan
@SenJohnMcCain my daughter is non verbal, she has #Autism. 1 in 64 children do now. Please don't vote for a bill that will hurt her future.

Misspelled Trump. Phone autocorrected it to Tyrion. I think Apple should make any misspelling of Trump autocorrect to Joffrey.
Jon was chosen to lead with no birthright, and he follows the old gods. Bernie is the son of immigrant parents and is a Jew.
Politicians as GOT- Bernie Sanders- Jon Snow. Bernie was told many times he was a single issue candidate and Jon is a single issue King.

@scottlock4usc VA would be better if the bill Bernie introduced wasn't block by republicans. Seems us veterans aren't that important.
