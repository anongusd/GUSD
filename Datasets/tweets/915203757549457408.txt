@BerrinAndro So expecting the leader of the country to live up to the values he claims to have makes me indecent
@BerrinAndro I don‚Äôt need to prove to someone on Twitter that I‚Äôm a decent person.
@BerrinAndro When the President doesn‚Äôt acknowledge a death of someone that was historically important, especially a vet, he‚Äôs busy tweeting that the Democrats aren‚Äôt supporting the military &amp; veterans, I can point out the hypocrisy
@BerrinAndro Except when he‚Äôs constantly touting his support and respects veterans, then misses the death of a person important to veterans &amp; to women.

@paradigmeyes @OneAmerican7 @mitchellvii 3) Unless someone is able to get help right away, Abuse can destroy you.
@paradigmeyes @OneAmerican7 @mitchellvii 2) A friend was abused by his neighbor from the 3-7, then a cousin from 9-10. He became an addict, including a sex addiction that destroyed his marriage.
@paradigmeyes @OneAmerican7 @mitchellvii 1) Being abused screws with your head and touches every aspect of your life . My mother was abused as a child, her idea of love was mirrored after those experiences, married 4 abusive men-she left her 5th husband,  she didn‚Äôt think he loved her because he didn‚Äôt abuse her.
@jrudolphwright @mitchellvii @paulaLaffin It‚Äôs not easy to come forward right away, it took me over a year to finally tell 1 person I was raped, and over 20 years to discuss it openly. In my case;  I believed all those things we hear people say: she deserved it, she was asking for it, she led him on, etc etc
