@GordsUK @HoarseWisperer @VABVOX Gord we can all agree to disagree on specific issues and opinions, but we still need to stick together. There is nothing more important than what's coming up and we need everyone on the same page for that.
@realDonaldTrump "seems like a long time ago." And that means what exactly? That it doesn't matter or that you're also a rapist and just want this to go away. I'll go with all of the above.  I have no doubt that you're a rapist and I already know you hate women. https://t.co/qLd3VESDbU

@Martina His attempts to deflect from reality will work with his 30% base, but I would like to think most moderate Republicans have seen through this charade by now.
@AkilNeteru Agreed. Didn't we already experience this back in the 80s. Player coming out who weren't even close to being ready. They got chewed up and spit out. Every kids will have agents in the ear telling them they're ready.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Will we ever see the list? A lot of big names live or hand out in that area. could be trump, could be tiger woods, could be a lot of people. There will be heavy pressure to keep the names quiet.

Great thread. https://t.co/1EX9viJTjd
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Liars and crooks believe everyone else is a liar and crook. It's how they reconcile who they are. It's only natural they would actively seek out others who are actually like them. That's why I have no doubt Robert Kraft wasn't the only one frequenting that spa.
@h8Wankmaggot45 The fact that he keeps referring to "dick size" is pretty telling.
@BeautyBind At no time did I tell you what you can or cannot post. I merely pointed out that you are giving him exactly what he wants. Please don't try and portray me a man telling women what to do. I don't deserve that.
@ProudResister @Martina I agree. The alleged history is there. Just another disgusting abuse of power and wealth.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing says Presidential like contradicting your hand-picked experts in front of foreign dignitaries and the press. You are so desperate to portray yourself as intelligent and every time it blows up in your face. How embarrassing. https://t.co/jaXcNCy2sr
@MainsdeDieu @fred_guttenberg It's always existed. It just didn't have 24/7 instant coverage like it does now. It's the ugly underbelly to what used to be the most influential and powerful country in the world.
@BeautyBind I get the anger and disgust with this loser, but every time someone posts or re-posts you are giving him exactly what he wants and that is attention and notoriety. To him that's a major win, especially if it comes from women.
I think the accurate question is does trump hang out with anyone who isn't guilty of being a sex offender? https://t.co/QBRgwqTySc
There are two takeaways for me on this. 1-Everyone needs to vet everything thoroughly before they post it. 2-Stop the infighting! I am already seeing it heavily infused in posts now. If you engage in this we all lose. End of sermon.		https://t.co/oi2b8dS4Ad

@ellyay @_WeStandUnited @LisaTalmadge @SpeakerPelosi Agreed. We need to stop with this.  If there is proof of wrongdoing fine. Then post the proof and we will vet these people properly. If not, mudslinging and innuendo makes us no better than the republican party. We need to be better.

@ninaland @BrianBiscieglia @VanessadelRio @WoodhullSFA @FSCArmy I actually just watched part 2 and 3 and wasn't overly impressed. I agree with you about Luke Ford. Some of the personal stories were interesting in part 1. Part 2 and 3 didn't reach as far in terms of fleshing out the human side of the people they were highlighting.
@ninaland That would be challenging.
@realDonaldTrump this is all you have left now is to lash out at anyone who disagrees with you or says things that you don't like. Like a stubborn, immature teenager lashing out at everyone. No one is buying this except for your rapidly illegitimate base. https://t.co/7cpuei72oL

@Jersey_Craig @ColoLiberal2 Like I said. The only voice you're hearing is your own. You're not even trying to communicate. You're just telling me I'm wrong over and over again.
@Bravewriting Italians also eat lots of hot sauce. So do Egyptians, Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Vietnamese, South Asians and many more. It is very common in other cultures around the world.
@Jersey_Craig @ColoLiberal2 You're not even trying to listen. You're only listening to what you want to say. That shows a lot of disrespect to the person you're speaking to.
@Jersey_Craig @ColoLiberal2 Stop what? having an opinion? Expressing an idea? You can't police people's speech Craig and then co-opt what they say to try and make your point. It isn't fair to other people.
@Jersey_Craig @ColoLiberal2 lardass is a slang word that has been around forever and is not about being fat. It is meant as a figurative term that means someone is lazy. Nobody is bullying anyone.
It's always the same thing. The racists always scream the same things over and over again to try and make their point. This gentlemen is being calm and gracious and she just keeps going. It's pathetic. https://t.co/BJ3Y0QdF4p
@Jersey_Craig @ColoLiberal2 I agree with you that fat shaming is uncalled for, but we're in uncharted territory here. I'm personally going to give people some leeway because I understand how exasperated everyone is.  Again just for the record "lardass" refers to someone being lazy. It isn't fat shaming.
@LindaMarkss @SethAbramson @afaye66 That's the roy cohn game though. Keep doubling down and keep doubling down on the lies until they start to believe. And then make even more incredible claims or make even crazier moves to normalize the previous stuff they did.
@ColoLiberal2 @Bravewriting You should sue.

@skibbers2 Any loving adults, who can provide a good home and be good parents should be able to have children.
@ColoLiberal2 @Jersey_Craig And just of the record if this is about the MaraLadass thing, the term lardass has nothing to do with being overweight. It refers to lazy people (e.g.-people with lard in their ass) It's not about fat shaming trump. It's about shaming how lazy he is.
@ColoLiberal2 @Jersey_Craig Agreed. It sucks though because we have never needed to be more united than right now. We need all hands on deck if we're going to clean up this mess so I hope he realizes that and changes his mind.
@ProudResister @AGBecerra @CAgovernor Yes, thank you.

I always knew lettuce was more dangerous than migrants desperately fleeing a war zone to find a better life. #screwyoulettuce Oh and you too @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/JQSOwGZc2m
First it's a man running for President mocking people with a disability and now it's another man who was running mocking someone with a disability. Goes to show the deep insecurity these men have that they make fun of others to make them feel better about themselves. #pathetic https://t.co/JSejSGLHRf

Trump has a history of saying he doesn't know people when he actually does to try and avoid looking stupid. If it's true he didn't know him then yes that is frightening and shows how little active involvement Trump has in this administration. https://t.co/PQBe7vxjuc

@BobIrvingCJOB Who was it who said Manziel would be the best ever in the CFL by the time everything was said and done? Oh and Doug Flutie put on quite a show in his first full season (1991) playing behind an average O-line with slow receivers. Manziel is not Doug Flutie.

@domabassi You're right although even splitting time he's top 3 in rushing and top 7 in receptions plus his punt and kick returns have been amazing. The big question for me is top QB. Julian has more yards than Jake, but more picks too
@TeonAA @KTMaxwell_CFC @CFC_RyanMcCabe @KatieBurtCFC @BCHSFB That's good. Best game I've seen you guys play as a team so far this year.
@domabassi Saw your segment about the awards for BCFC this season. I would agree about Reist and Conor Richard for coach and defense. Why Max Joseph isn't getting overwhelming love for offensive MVP is beyond me. This kid does everything for the Rams. Should be MVP.
Congratulations to all the inductees.		https://t.co/f1wwntDh3p

@EllenBarkin @EllenBarkin I totally get it. I'm sorry you went through that. I know far too many women who have had to survive that (as well as a couple of men).  It's horrible.
@fr_aquilini Keep doing what you're doing, Francesco. It's hard to be an owner of something and have it match everyone's expectations. You're laying the groundwork for what will eventually be very good hokey teams. Those of us who grew up in East Van believe in what you're doing.
@EllenBarkin I have seen Ellen Barkin angry in movies and one thing it never made her was unattractive. If anything it made her even more attractive because of the inner strength and courage it showed.

@Cantguardmike has 38 catches out of 40 targets in 3 games for the New Orleans Saints. That's unbelievable. https://t.co/rrctoiZsbK
I'm confused. How is a player who hits a QB supposed to change the direction his body is going when he is falling and the QB he hit is falling? Is he supposed to twist his body in mid-air so that the QB lands on him thereby acting as a buffer?  		https://t.co/b3FKY5yrIX
