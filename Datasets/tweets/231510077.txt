Look forward to continuing our work with @DHSgov to ensure the safety and well being of border agents and those seeking asylum, which is legal under international and immigration law. 		Follow us along for live updates tomorrow from #Alamogordo here. 6/7
As the Administration limits its processing of asylum claims at ports of entry, asylum seeking families are forced to wait weeks in unsafe and unsanitary conditions with little to no food or resources. 5/7

I have great respect for our county leaders, but voting in Bexar County has been a terrible mess for several years. Badly outdated voting machines with no paper record. Lawsuit in 2016 to remove signs with bad voter info. Nothing seems to change.
At Las Palmas, there was a long line but only one poll worker to check ppl in. There are usually 3. Also, there was a problem w/ the system that prevented voter labels from being printed, meaning it had to be done by hand. Running late for work, many ppl left without voting. 2/2

The United States should punish Assad and his supporters in Moscow and Tehran for their sanctioned use of chemical weapons and deter them from doing it again through the use of sanctions and diplomacy. I urge President Trump to reverse this decision immediately.
This is even out of step with his own Administration, which begs the question of why President Trump goes so easy on #Russia in the first place.
This sends a message to the world that those who support regimes that use chemical weapons against their own people will not be punished and even invites other rogue leaders to similarly test the resolve of the President of the United States.

I was glad to speak on the need for a stronger transatlantic relationship at the @FESOnline breakfast this morning with @RepGregoryMeeks and former Rep @RussCarnahan. https://t.co/hA2JGY88Gq
Mr. President, I want to remind you that you in fact do not have legal authorization to fire Special Counsel Robert #Mueller. That would fall under Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein. But the real question is, what are you so afraid of #Mueller finding and telling the American public? https://t.co/gJE0Y0Zukc
The @TheJusticeDept moving to halt a program that offers legal assistance to those facing deportation is just another attempt by this Administration to hurt vulnerable immigrants. https://t.co/7JsW2b3nKq

There is a clear pattern of heads of agencies, like @EPA @EPAScottPruitt &amp; many more, that have been nominated and appointed by #POTUS which is deeply troublesome. @EPAScottPruitt should step down immediately. https://t.co/dVZcJM2o9F

We must be relentless in combating extremism &amp; hate wherever it occurs, in #Syria and #Iraq as #ISIS targets #Yazidis and other minorities, in #Burma where the military &amp; security forces are carrying out ethnic cleansing of the #Rohingya, and even in our own backyard.
As we mark #HolocaustMemorialDay, it‚Äôs important to remember the horrors committed by the Nazi regime &amp; their collaborators which took over 6 million Jews and millions others. But we have a duty to do more than just look back.
.@realDonaldTrump saying the @FBI @MichaelCohen212 raid was a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù and part of ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù Now, more than ever, we must protect Special Counsel Mueller and his investigation at all costs so we can get the American people the truth they need to know. #TrumpRussiaCollusion https://t.co/v4hNomVIYx
This is a positive development and I hope more of those responsible for the horrific crimes against the #Rohingya will be held accountable, and call on #Myanmar to release the brave reporters who exposed the massacre. https://t.co/hSolGwvyCt
RT @JulianCastro: Happy #NationalSiblingsDay ! https://t.co/1TCuEuH1AT
We need an Administration that is strategic, sees value in diplomacy and development, &amp; adheres to the bedrock of our democracy that includes Congressional authorization with military force.
We cannot solve long-term issues solely through missile strikes or sending our men &amp; women into harm‚Äôs way.
From the #Syria chemical weapons attack, the upcoming #Trump-Kim summit on #NorthKorea denuclearization, crimes against humanity in #Burma, the #Venezuela crisis, I hope @realDonaldTrump listens to all expertise within the USG to solve these critical national security challenges.
