@george_gkamau Correct
@george_gkamau Absolutely
@george_gkamau Precisely
@Paul_Makonda I have seen a number of comments against Paul. One thing we should bear in our minds is that, saying a word to the deceased person is not the sin. Like any other person Paul expressed his feelings after late Ruge went stay with Lord. We should stop attack Paul
@karanja_thuku Devilish!!!!!
@HKigwangalla I know how does the whole family feeling now BUT know that, God who is the life giver is with you at this time.
@KKagasheki @AllyAbd41893724 Correct
@theSICARIO_255 This is a lesson to the crimes committed by the name of" mob Justice"
@WilliamsRuto Excellent Bwana Vice President
@UKenyatta Excellent Mr President
@KKagasheki Very interesting
@HEBobiwine Amen
@UKenyatta You are a visionary Kenyan head of State. We have confidence with you and hope soon things will be OK and what you pledged will be done. All the best Mr President.
@WilliamsRuto Congratulations for being admitted Learned Brother.
@KKagasheki Correct
@DrAlfredMutua These guys whom you have mentioned are role model in both African and American leadership. I fail to understand what is wrong with Yoweri Museveni and Nkurunziza? Why don't they learn a lesson from others? I don't see a good end of their leadership if they  not change.
@dkmaraga Wow!!!!!!!! When I see the learned counsels  being admitted in the bar to this demonstrates big progressive step in legal fraternity. I congratulate each of them for the hard work at Kenya school of law to make this admission possible. I wish all the best in serving Kenya.
@fatma_karume Slow down TL!!!!!
@SuphianJuma Each leader has his or her own style of leading However the more significant thing to consider is to make sure that true drastic development changes is happening. Former President Benjamin William Mkapa has spoken well and we have to learn that in doing things we can't do perfect
@seanhannity Why do you say by 2020 he may not be the Head of State? Explain well
@fatma_karume What is wrong with this picture Aunt Fatma?

@KKagasheki Maneno mazuri Sana ya Hekima. Ubarikiwe Brother
@ItsMutai I was so shocked finding a large number of Somalians in Kenya than in any other country in East Africa. Coming and living for them in Kenya will never let Kenya be a peaceful state. The question is. where were the Presidents when these people entering there is a basic question.
@ntvkenya He made a right decision
@WilliamsRuto Absolutely
@KKagasheki I like this
@fatma_karume It is time now to make an amendment to this law because a big number of the District Commissioners do abuse the powers conferred to them.
@HEBobiwine @VOAShaka @nbstv Excellent
@UKenyatta This is very good relationship between two the states.
@fatma_karume @judiciarytz As a lawyer I reserve my comments.

@realDonaldTrump It is an appropriate time to withdraw your troops from Afghanistan and Syria. By the way what do gain out of these endless war? It has already been costed too much. Keep your words by ending the war and concentrate on boosting an economy of US.
@FredMatiangi Good strategy

RT @james_sillas: With Jesus Christ nothing is impossible. XXX. Listen the song !!!!! https://t.co/O1XAxWVDTa
@JamesOngwae Congratulations for this an exceptional facility
@KKagasheki A lesson I do learn in this clip of a kid who is demonstrating an exceptional talent is that, each of us is born for a reason and purpose. Therefore we should learn to indentify our purposes to live on Earth
With Jesus Christ nothing is impossible. XXX. Listen the song !!!!! https://t.co/O1XAxWVDTa
@BKhaniri An immediately legal action should be taken against such charlatans.
@OGKendrickDawGG @justoomwash Zipo nyingi huko sana
@teddyeugene Nyeri is one of an area  where such events taking place often. I see on a clip one of the suspect hitting a wall by his head. Terrible!!!! Such culprities ought to be  arrested before causing great damage.
@RepChipRoy He spoke well
@bunge_tz I knew Tindu Lissu is a liar and he is trying to make everyone to believe that, the Parliament has never ever contributed a single coin his medical costs. He ought to be stop making noise now.
@dkmaraga It is right time to congratulate you Hon Justice Maraga for opening the court complex at this busiest station. This essential judicial service will enable residents to access the Justice in time.
@JuliusMmasi @ItsMutai Absolutely
@SPKwete @swahilitimes @JMakamba @MagufuliJP @MariaSTsehai @fatma_karume @zittokabwe @Nnauye_Nape @NancySumari Kuna tabia imekomaa katika nchi yetu ya watu kuchukua sheria mkononi wanapomkamata muhalifu na kujifanya wao. Ni Police kwa kuwapiga vibaya, kufanya wao Waendesha Mashitaka, kunifanya Mahakama kwakutoa Hukumu. It is not right we are in a country that respects Rule of law
@zittokabwe It is true that you can't be the Head of State Brother. That is my view

@muftimenk Absolutely
@HKigwangalla Kweli kabisa
@zittokabwe Kaka usipende sana kulalamika jifunze kuwa mvumilivu kwani sii kesi yako tuu iliyohairishwa. We are human beings who have alot of things to do. We plan to do things and when time comes we fail to do it for some reasons beyond our control. We should learn to be patient.
@sayafrica Ha ha ha I like the music
@Hellylfcx08 Real?
@realDonaldTrump He lacked patriotism
@masanja___ @HKigwangalla Alot of foreign and domestic tourists ought to visit our tourism sites to see our blessings.
@HAROUBTV @HKigwangalla Hon Kigwangala I'm pleased with your good work in the Ministry but know that  there is still many more to do. I do still urge you to recruit a good team of people to make a good marketing of our Nation parks, game reserves, and many other good things that we have in Tanzania.
@TheODMparty @RailaOdinga @MagufuliJP It Is always good thing and blessings be visited by the good neighbor. I like this visitation.
@JMakamba Absolutely
@HKigwangalla Take an action now Hon to make things happen. Advertisement has to be to made by TANAPA by involving full the tour operators in the Marketing team. It appears little has been done to let the World to know what do have here. Recruit a good team of serious expert to do it.
@JMakamba @SuluhuSamia Happy birthday Mama

@SenAlexander You have shown a way by voting Sen Alexander. Keep live that spirit of patriotism. Cheers
@ewarren Your progressive idea seems to be absolutely  good and thinkers should buy it now for the benefits of majority of Americans.
@SenatorDurbin You have done a good thing that had made him more stronger in his career. I'm pretty sure that your moral support is what he mostly needs to move the country in the next level of development. Cheers  Senator.

Our history is more important for it tells us where are we coming from as a nation and where are we now and where are we heading. This story teaches us that, our forefathers were stronger people who stood on what they believed is right. We have to be like them. https://t.co/I7PU099caZ
Holding the Head of State in Prayers  is as equal as to uplift the whole Nation before the God's throne. We need God's presence in our country. https://t.co/NgurB5m2wd
When Jesus Christ's favor comes to you know that, your life won't be the same. The testimony of this man makes me feel that, with God nothing truly is impossible and no  one has powers to bring you down. Be strong and move to your destiny. https://t.co/dxc1ni5bsG
Each word said by this man is a lesson to anyone holdinga position in an office. https://t.co/OlKJwFwVlx
@DarrylMorrisJr Precisely
@realDonaldTrump Keep it up
@DarrylMorrisJr Absolutely that is correct because we aren't Children of lesser God. God has more good things for us.
@swahilitimes Going to people who colonized you and tell them your problems is as equal as to tell them that, you need them to return here and colonise us again something that, is absolutely impossible. If it is true that Lissu has done that, he has to know that he made a huge mistake.
@UKenyatta This man is going to change the Democratic Republic of Congo. The puppet is gone for good and a patriot is on power for good to transform the state from the hands of scavengers and parasites.
https://t.co/55S5R4jIbU Corruption is a bad thing
@KazimotoBaraka3 We agreed that God chose him BUT now he should know nothing is permanent on Earth. He has to leave for other to lead too. Moses led Israelites to a one point and he left and Joshua finished the journey.
@Asmali77 So funny
@IdrisSultan We in a continent where a small group of stupid people finance recruitment of young men to be terrorists. I was truly shocked to learn through media that, Tanzania is an incubator of such killers. It is high time to hold our country in prayers and take serious precautions.
@fatma_karume Ha ha ha Shangazi Fatuma it is true that your Kiswahili is not good one. You search words alot when you speak Kiswahili. I know that your English is excellent and you are fluent in it because of your background. Advise: Take a good amount of time to read local news papers.
@fouzi_abdi @AbuubakarJunior @citizentvkenya @KTNKenya Good news
@cobbo3 I don't surprise to hear this
@ItsMutai A business is all about advertisement
@ItsMutai I like this style of polishing the shoes in Kenya. That no one takes off the shoes.

@TheStarKenya You played a game smart Babu
@DrMabula @gesosy @zittokabwe Yes you are a noise maker ha ha ha ha and very stubborn
@daniel_marari @zittokabwe Precisely
@ElinasPeter @OleMtetezi I truly hate these murderers
@OleMtetezi If I had both power and authority these devils wouldn't breath even for a single minute. The reason to me is a terrorist is a devil and I don't give damn shit to the devil. The devils and idiots should be condermed to death.
@eeiihh_ray @K_ebabs Funny
@zittokabwe Mr Zitto Kabwe you have said too much on this  and I do hope you heard the statement made by the CAG yesterday that on 21January 2019 is going to show up before the callers. Let him do it and don't be his spokesman. You should now retire to talk about it.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President do what you think and believe is good for your country and don't be discouraged by anything or anyone. Your visions aren't other people's visions. Take America where do you see is good for it to be at this material time. Don't allow noise to disturb you.
@theSICARIO_255 @bunge_tz @MagufuliJP Was there a triable issue in that case?
@millardayo Horrible
@MagufuliJP In few words we say poleni sana and Kenyans know that, we hold you in our prayers and we love you so much. Exodus 23:33 " Do not let those people live in your country; if you do, they will make you sin against me. If you worship their God's, it will be fatal trap for you"
