@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @POTUS ok so who is going to keep a scorecard for comparison to prev admin? @FoxNews will for sure, this should be good!
Where did you get you intel? and how many Texans are unemployed, would you have that too? https://t.co/W23e0u601B
Amnesty is temporary in DACA correct? 800K is noteworthy, does DACA provide time for citizenship? https://t.co/p8w2HjVs25
@DarinMoore7 Ok, so how many are citizens now? A "Green Card" only gives the right to work here, is that correct Darin?
@ClintSmithIII When do #DACA recip go home or become citizens?
@ClintSmithIII Children aren't kept here, they go with their parents, am I correct on this point?
@Handleys @jdanner46 @SenFeinstein Please provide verifiable cost to become a citizen.....
@Mar13980 @SenFeinstein My point, #DACA provides time to be legal
Senator, how hard is it for #DACA recipients to gain citizenship? Is it possible to gain naturalization/citizenship during the DACA period? https://t.co/ejcnP7Ru6N
Your contribution to the US is appreciated.
For illegal immigrants, please see how to become a citizen. https://t.co/aDTJWksIDT
@GinoKusa No, I think it's about illegal immigrants and eventually citizenship, hopefully
@TbPerchX @WilDonnelly Does or Doesn't?
@WilDonnelly @Muckety Who's decision was it to not speak w eachother till now?
@WilDonnelly Please provide proof of your comment, prefer Turner's own video pls.
@WilDonnelly If your numbers are not fake, how many DACA participants have applied, attempt to apply or have gained citizenship?
No comments on JB Williams and/or CDJ News from anyone?
@FoxNews Such a mess! No one acted!
@HCSOTexas Great work by all our sheriff's
Is JB Williams and cdj news the real deal?   Anyone.   https://t.co/FuTBef8tdJ
@RepKihuen You say you were one of them, tell us what changed, why it changed and what do you recommend to "dreamers" to not have to leave the US.
@OANN Trump will get blamed for that ruling...
@the_ryanbrennan @FoxNews @mikeyoh21 He favors Usain Bolt..
@ABC Nice Robbie! way to go man!

@Liz_Wheeler Once again your the hammer that hit the nail right on the head!, nice, thanks

#DACA confident Mr. Trump will only req current 800K to apply for legal status.
@JeffOverstreet8 @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Eyefortruth.......The photo you post of you looks like a swastika, just saying...........
@btb926 @jcoppenhaver @marswalker3000 @realDonaldTrump I like that.
#DACA I'm ok with this but eventually Dreamers will be legal citizens, hopefully. DACA will not be needed when everyone enters the US legal
