@brightsided1029 @tmcpherson123 @NBCNews Eliminating insurance companies is what reduces cost most of all. They spend so much denying care that they may as well just pay for it. If we pool together, we have more bargaining power with pharmaceutical manufacturers than any insurance company could dream of having.
@brightsided1029 Good point. I personally have no preference. I have frustrating scenarios in both mediums. Though I think in the grand scheme, e-scribing may be safer.
@brightsided1029 Depends on the prescription. If there are potential interactions with other medications in the profile or if the patient has multiple doctors writing for controlled substances, a confirmation with the doctor may be necessary.
@tmcpherson123 @brightsided1029 @NBCNews We're paying for more than the uninsured. Do you know how much we could save in administrative costs if we stopped denying preventative care and simply funded a universal program? 10% of our overall healthcare expenditure. $320 million annually.

@PhlawlessPharm The cards are primarily for use at Walgreens. They can work at other pharmacies, but I think most other pharmacies offer free prescription savings programs. Walgreens requires a $20 annual fee for their program, so most cash prices are higher than other pharmacies.
@PhlawlessPharm Ah. That's why
@PhlawlessPharm What's your pharmacy? These always work at Walgreens.
@PhlawlessPharm That hasn't happened once with these. I use them regularly for my uninsured patients.
@PhlawlessPharm Not a waste of pharmacy time. Some of these discounts are better than GoodRx. The Helath Alliance card discounts OTCs and flu shots too.
If you don't have insurance or have bad insurance, try one of these discount cards next time you go to the pharmacy. Gets used in place of insurance. Cannot be combined with other coupons. Retweet to save a life. #MedTwitter https://t.co/BW0UVoA1B1
