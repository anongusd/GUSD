@stphnfwlr @Newsweek There are ways to tell people they need ID without showing a black girl without one and white boy with one. And even if voter ID is the law, we can still point out issues with that policy. Looking forward to your reporting on the ongoing voting issues in GA!
@stphnfwlr Provisional ballots don‚Äôt count if you don‚Äôt provide ID within 3 days. For people without ID or who forget/don‚Äôt have time/don‚Äôt have resources to go rectify, their votes are suppressed. I appreciate your concern but this is still an issue worth calling out, and @Newsweek agreed
@stphnfwlr Ok, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs hiring diverse kids but not sure that makes this one any less problematic.
@stphnfwlr But good reminder that nobody should leave the polls without at least casting a provisional ballot!
@stphnfwlr A provisional ballot is not an actual ballot, and we know what happens to many provisional ballots. The point that the black girl is the one without ID stands.

4. Over and over, Gov. Scott and his board denied petitioners for voting rights because the crimes were too recent, too severe, or they had too many outstanding fines. The board decided these people should not be granted the constitutional right to vote https://t.co/Y7mbNFoARD

The trial is moving far slower than expected and will likely continue into next week, if not longer. The ACLU still hasn‚Äôt presented Kobach‚Äôs 45 min video deposition which they will do tomorrow (should be exciting).
Final updates from day two: Kobach tried to question the Sedgwick County Election Commissioner about a list of noncitizen voters, but the @ACLU objected. The court will revisit the list and whether to admit it tomorrow.
Kobach‚Äôs team had the federal rules of evidence printed out in a stack of papers when court returned from lunch. But they still made countless basic mistakes. At one point, the judge explained to them how to phrase questions.
Two more voters also presented testimony. One, Parker Bednasek, is a senior at Kansas University who did not provide proof of citizenship because he disagrees with the law. The other, Steven Wayne Fish, didn‚Äôt have any documents to show and was disenfranchised.
Court just took a break so one of Kobach‚Äôs attorneys could locate a document. The last 90 min with Garrett Roe, attorney for Kobach, doing cross-exam has also been a mess
@Allie_Kite @JessicaHuseman Actually it‚Äôs Slap‚Äôs but have been advised I also have to try Joe‚Äôs
Meanwhile, overheard at a Kansas City BBQ joint: ‚ÄúDo you have a kale salad?‚Äù Entire restaurant laughs. 		@JessicaHuseman and I are working on this spread: https://t.co/kI70H6hWO5
Kobach‚Äôs team also tried to establish that it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for volunteers with @LWV to push a copy machine around neighborhoods when they‚Äôre doing door-to-door registration drives in order to make copies of proof of citizenship documents.
Sue Becker, an attorney with Kobach‚Äôs office, does not seem to know the basic rules of evidence or how to conduct a cross-exam. Judge repeated explained to her how it‚Äôs done. Someone who watches Law &amp; Order could probably conduct themselves better.
The remainder of the morning was Kobach‚Äôs team‚Äôs cross-examination of the @LWV witness. It was, to put it lightly, a mess.
When Kobach gained the power to prosecute voters in 2015, it made the @LWV‚Äôs registration efforts even more difficult and some chapters stopped trying altogether. ‚ÄúThey thought they‚Äôd be on the stand like I am,‚Äù Margaret Ahrens said.
She said that when the law took effect in 2013, registrations by local chapters of the group declined 75-90%. ‚ÄúIt was an absolute blow. The league was really knocked off its feet.‚Äù
The ACLU also presented witness Margaret Ahrens, a former Kansas @LWV president who testified that the documentary proof of citizenship law has made the group‚Äôs voter registration and education efforts far more difficult if not impossible.
Kobach‚Äôs team also argued that @dale_e_ho of the @ACLU violated court rules by posting a tweet last night about the upcoming video deposition, saying it‚Äôll show a ‚Äúgrand conspiracy‚Äù to make it harder to vote. Judge basically ignored that objection.
Some updates: The morning began with Kobach‚Äôs team trying to block the ACLU from playing a video deposition of Kobach. The judge denied the request and said the video could play. More here: https://t.co/fhT466p0GZ

My report from day one: Kris Kobach and the ACLU begin their weeklong face-off over voter registration	https://t.co/5gAjqwacWs https://t.co/kphqfSocXx
Finally, the judge ruled that evidence concerning Kobach‚Äôs attempts to amend the National Voter Registration Act (including the document he was photographed holding after a meeting with Trump in 2016) is admissible
The @ACLU called a third voter, TJ Boynton, a 37 year old English professor. He said he was ‚Äúirritated and disappointed‚Äù when he was barred from voting in 2014 because the DMV clerk never asked for his birth certificate when he registered to vote.
.@ElectProject testified that roughly 30,000 Kansans had their registrations suspended while the law was in effect. He also testified that they were disproportionately young voters and voters without a party affiliation.
Kobach showed expert @ElectProject a series of tweets the expert wrote about Kobach, trying to prove that the expert has a personal bias against Kobach. In one, @ElectProject called Kobach a ‚Äúshit sandwich.‚Äù 		‚ÄúThey‚Äôre tough, but they‚Äôre tweets,‚Äù he replied.

The ACLU started presenting their first witness, @ElectProject. Michael McDonald prepared a report on Kansas voter registration and voter turnout.
Both sides previewed their witnesses. Kobach criticized the ACLU‚Äôs plan of parading a set of witnesses the group often presents in voting-related cases. The ACLU said Kobach‚Äôs witnesses have been discredited or aren‚Äôt knowledgeable about Kansas voting.
At one point, Kobach‚Äôs team accidentally gave the ACLU a copy of an exhibit that had their notes on it. The ACLU pointed out that they may want to take it back.
The judge also barred Kobach from presenting an exhibit with the latest number of non-citizens on the voter rolls because he violated the 24 hour rule and sent it to the ACLU at 10:45 pm last night.
Some observations: Kobach and his team are very unprepared/unorganized. They don‚Äôt have enough copies of exhibits and at one point, the judge had to explain ‚ÄúEvidence 101‚Äù to them.
The trial just adjourned for lunch. This morning, both sides gave opening statements and the @ACLU presented two voters who were disenfranchised by the proof of citizenship law.

@ericwilson @EdWGillespie Happy to add a response/statement from Ed about his current position, if he's available
