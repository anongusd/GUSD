@realDonaldTrump Apparently, the president of the United States of America is unaware of the annual party already held on fourth of July. 		He should consider making the fourth a government Holiday. Hahahahahaha
@_WeStandUnited Your assertion that I'm a "misogynistic white woman" throws words around which you obviously don't understand. 		Instead of supporting other women, such as @AOC , your egotistical, misguided reaction is to tear her down. 		@AOC  plan has flaws, but has merit.		#dontbemean
@_WeStandUnited Who is the sexist white man you speak of? Again, ego.		I'm a white woman, and you are incapable of focusing on the goal. 		Put ego in check. Quit fighting for the sake of fighting.
@AmyMcGrathKY TRUMP is deconstructing America.
