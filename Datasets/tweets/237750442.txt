For girls displaced by conflict, to study or not to study should not be the question. Read more here: #HR2408 #teacheverygirl
#HR2408 will move us in the right direction by making access to primary &amp; secondary edu a priority for the @StateDept &amp; @USAID – it aims to directly benefit displaced children, specifically girls, &amp; will help to address one of the world’s biggest challenges facing refugees.

The opioid problem is too serious, too significant, and too widespread for us NOT to work together to find a solution to this epidemic.
Opioids do not discriminate based on age, race or socioeconomic class. Opioids can kill anyone in any neighborhood, and devastate lives.

This common-sense, bipartisan bill will provide non-profit groups the same liability protections afforded volunteers under current law.
To help address this problem, today I introduced H.R. 2290, the Local Volunteer Organization Protection Act. http://t.co/zU5aVvEI2b
The threat of litigation can cause these organizations to file bankruptcy, and can impede their ability to mobilize volunteers.
Too often, however, these groups are threatened by litigation that has little to do with the actions of their volunteers or employees.
Local non-profit service organizations provide important services that might otherwise not be available in our communities.

This week, I reintroduced the Girls Count Act which will encourage birth registration for all children and help put an end to these horrors.
Lack of a birth certificate denies children full participation in society and can subject them to human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
In any given year, worldwide, there are approx. 51 million children under age five - mostly girls – who were not registered at birth.

@RepMikeTurner, @RepMarciaFudge,  Rep. Joyce Beatty and I will offer an amdt to make schools like @CentralState87 eligible for USDA funds.
SNAP exists to help those in need; if a recipient doesn't use funds after 60 days (a reasonable period), the recipient must not "need" them.
Another amdt would recoup unused SNAP funds (food stamps) from recipients after 60 days rather than 1 year under current law.
My amendment to eliminate the Market Access Program (offered with @RepMcClintock) is supported by @NTU and @club4growth #CutSpending #Waste
There are MANY more examples of MAP #Waste; it is time to stop wasting our tax dollars and finally end this program #CutSpending

Another amendment would prohibit using taxpayer dollars to give food assistance to China. #CutSpending #Waste
