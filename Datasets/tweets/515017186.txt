Mayor @Paulsoglin said the city could fill in for the lack of federal funding "well into the summer," though the reserves were not designed for this purpose
"We‚Äôre doing better than most and we will do better than most because of the conservative budgeting we have done over the years and our reserves," @Paulsoglin said. "But they weren‚Äôt intended for this purpose."
"The biggest and most serious areas of concerns ‚Ä¶ involve public health and people who are depending on Medicaid reimbursement, areas of health and the funding of our housing programs," @Paulsoglin
"Most areas we will be alright going through February. After that there are certain areas of concern," @Paulsoglin said on the shutdown. Areas of concern: the 	city government itself and services to the people of Madison

Because of the number of meetings I go to for my job, I tend to measure things by computer batter charge. My computer died before the end of tonight's mayoral forum.
"When it comes to use of force, bias is very real," @tori4mayor said. #MadisonMayor
Calls for increased transparency, increased accountability, increased training and maintained commitment to hiring officers of color and women
.@rajshukla questions the use of Chief Koval's blog posts as the best way to communicate #madisonmayor
On law enforcement: "We lack trust between our police department and frankly our city and communities of color. And that‚Äôs unacceptable," @SatyaForMadison said. #madisonmayor
"Imagine if I'm mayor. Get involved, it could happen," @NickHartInc said. #madisonmayor
The last questions for #MadisonMayor candidates is on building more housing. I missed tweeting all the answers, but you can check them out on City Channel https://t.co/jdG82Unup3
"The cost of living is going up for the average person. We need to increase personal income," @NickHartInc said. #MadisonMayor
.@NickHartInc, who technically lives in the town of Madison, raises concerns about annexation. "I can‚Äôt imaging property values going down. I‚Äôm two years from running for mayor of Sun Prairie." #MadisonMayor
.@rajshukla says Madison should look at modernizing zoning system to be able to build more housing options #madisonmayor
.@Paulsoglin: "Collaboration on case management is the key." #MadisonMayor
.@SatyaForMadison: "We need to make sure we‚Äôre collaborating with other units of government, particularly the county, and the nonprofit community to coordinate care." #MadisonMayor
.@MoCheeks: "Everyone deserves the opportunity to live in housing that is affordable." Says he will prioritize a mental health and crisis restoration center #MadisonMayor
"Housing first is wonderful if met with total wraparound service," @tori4mayor said #MadisonMayor
Candidates are addressing supportive affordable housing such as the Tree Lane and Rethke Terrace apartments #madisonmayor
.@Paulsoglin created a food policy coordinator in the mayor's office (currently held by George Reistad). Says community gardens should be expanded and the public market needs to get off the ground #MadisonMayor
.@SatyaForMadison is on the Local Food Committee. Suggestions: expand access to healthy food in schools and community centers, healthy retail access, continue food recovery efforts, expand SNAP access, improve access to gardening, expanding wholesale food access #madisonmayor
.@MoCheeks says the issue is about lack of access. "Closing the food desert in Allied was one of the top priorities that I‚Äôve had." #madisonmayor
.@tori4mayor: Build better partnerships. "We have grocery stores and we have food industries that are readily throwing out food." #madisonmayor
What are your top three proposals to addressing chronic hunger in Madison? @NickHartInc says to admit it's a problem #madisonmayor
Next topic: hunger and affordable housing #madisonmayor
"The quantity of rain cannot be contained," @Paulsoglin said #madisonmayor
.@SatyaForMadison says she is much more concerned about how low-income communities are affected than lakefront property. Says lake levels are up to Dane County and the DNR. "We also need to control the rain where it falls." #madisonmayor
"My solution to dealing with homeowners in the community is building awareness," @tori4mayor said. #madisonmayor
.@rajshukla: Talk "dirctly and honestly" to them. "Many of our surfaces are paved over. Surfaces are acting as a big funnel into our lakes. I would like to explore how we can prioritize green development in our city, using our permitting process to do it." #madisonmayor
Next up: What will you do to protect Madison from the dangers of flooding and how will you engage with lakefront property owners that may not want the lake levels reduced? #madisonmayor
.@SatyaForMadison: "They say women have to be asked 7 or 8 times to run. Took me a few more than that, but I finally started listening. What motivated me was being fed up by our lack of progress in Madison and feeling like we really can do better." #madisonmayor
.@mocheeks: November 2016. "My mom texted me that night and said, 'How are you feeling?' I didn‚Äôt answer her, but she responded, 'Don‚Äôt lose hope.'‚Äù #madisonmayor
@NickHartInc: "In 2007, I was working at a call center and looking at the primary returns. And I was like, that‚Äôs it?" #madisonmayor
.@tori4mayor: "As equity coordinator, people confide in me .. and not feeling like the city was providing them fair and equitable opportunities. I knew I had to be the one to do something." #madisonmayor
Where were you when you decided to run for mayor and what was going through your mind?	@Paulsoglin: Which time?	@rajshukla: A series of moments. ‚ÄúDeciding there was more that all of us needed to do.‚Äù #madisonmayor
.@SatyaForMadison details investing in energy efficiency, passing mandatory building scorecards, making it possible for individual homeowners to retrofit their homes for energy efficiency #madisonmayor
.@MoCheeks says he would implement a position in the mayor's office focused on sustainability if elected #madisonmayor
.@MoCheeks says communities of color and poor communities are disproportionately affected by slowly moving to 100% renewable energy use. "An impediment to moving at the pace we need to is the piecemeal approach to progress." #madisonmayor
"As far as emissions is concerned, anything that we can do to reduce the number of cars on the road and increase the number of ridership on our buses that also brings in revenue to bring down our debt service," @tori4mayor said #madisonmayor
"I think we as a city need to start leading," @NickHartInc said, specifically mentioning incentives for businesses #madisonmayor
.@rajshukla emphasizes the importance of electrifying city fleet to give MG&amp;E evidence of community demand for electric #madisonmayor
.@Paulsoglin discusses electric buses, working specifically on solar options and water conservation #madisonmayor
Third question: What are the most important, specific actions that you propose Madison to take to move the entire community to 100 percent renewable energy and what measures will be needed to ensure equity will be a part of the process? #madisonmayor
.@MoCheeks wants to "bring this back to a conversation about people." "I‚Äôm going to be advocating for a comprehensive transportation plan." #madisonmayor
.@tori4mayor encourages real partnerships with the surrounding community to address transit issues. "Let's get innovative, y'all." #madisonmayor
.@NickHartInc reminds audience that the most marginalized communities are the ones most affected by the city's transportation system #madisonmayor
.@rajshukla says he fights for "hard compromises that protect water quality" in his day job and can do the same for a regional transit system #madisonmayor
"One of our key objectives is to work with the Evers' administration to get the authority to set up an RTA," @Paulsoglin said. "We have already ordered four electric buses. We are envisioning the system will become all electric." #madisonmayor
.@Paulsoglin agrees:  "Bus rapid transit is our most immediate goal." #madisonmayor
On to the city's transportation system: "My top transportation priority is to bring rapid transit to Madison," @SatyaForMadison said. #madisonmayor
"We have to build the network with the bike paths and with other transit solutions that we don‚Äôt have existing right now," @tori4mayor said. #madisonmayoor
"In our city, we need to think about those residents who need to commute in the city and don‚Äôt have the transportation accessibility on the bus,"@tori4mayor said, noting "last mile" concept #madisonmayor
"We just build safer bike lanes," @NickHartInc said. "Stay in your lane," he adds. #madisonmayor
"As mayor, I would like to make the goal for this city to expand protected bike lanes by about five miles," @rajshukla said.
.@rajshukla lists four reasons to focus on different modes of transportation: environment, health and safety, economic, equity
"The challenge is how can we provide protection for the bicycle from the automobile traffic. We‚Äôre working on that right now," @Paulsoglin said. Another challenge is removing snow from bike lanes, dividers #madisonmayor
.@SatyaForMadison adds: "If we are going to address climate change, which we have to do in the next decade, then part of our solution has to be reducing emissions from our transportation sector." #madisonmayor
First question to @MoCheeks on biking and how to make it easier, more accessible in Madison: "In order for us to get better at that, we need to be completing bike and ped paths." #madisonmayor
#madisonmayor candidate @tori4mayor says diversity is a "paper exercise" in Madison. "I want to get a way from paper exercises. I want to get away in our policies and actual procedures form paper exercises," she said.
"I take joking very seriously as a comedian, so it‚Äôs municipal politics in Madison that are the joke," @NickHartInc said. "Only 10 to 20 percent of Madison votes in municipal politics." #madisonmayor
"I joined this race as a political newcomer because I feel like right now we‚Äôre at a moment in history," @rajshukla said, "a moment in history that asks us to do all we can to bring this community together and to think bigger." #madisonmayor
"We have to look at the citizen appointments to committees and make sure that they‚Äôre diverse," @Paulsoglin said. "We have to look at things like moving the discussion out of City Hall. Having the discussion in the neighborhood and community buildings." #madisonmayor
"We need a mayor who has a sense of urgency to take on these challenges," @SatyaForMadison said, mentioning rapid transit, racial equity, housing and climate change #madisonmayor
"We need a mayor who has a sense of urgency to take on these challenges," @MoCheeks said, describing a"tale of two cities" in Madison. And to work collaboratively, he said.

One of Mayor @Paulsoglin's recommendation for the structure of @CityofMadison #localgov: Cutting the council in half and moving to a full time council
"The recent years of budget vetoes and arguments are not representative of the preceding 30 years," former mayor Joe Sensenbrenner said
Fun fact: the @CityofMadison had a city manager from 1947 to 1950
Former mayor Joel Skornicka believes the mayor should serve on the Finance Committee. It's "crucial to the whole movement of government," he said
Ald. Paul Skidmore just alluded to a tradition where the outgoing #Madison mayor would give the incoming a mayor a haircut -- Is this true? Who can tell me?
Right now, Cieslewicz said that "districts are small enough that you can knock on every door a couple of times."
With a smaller council would likely come a full time council with members representing larger districts - "This invites money into politics," Cieslewicz said.
Former mayor Dave Cieslewicz said he hopes the task force does not decide to reduce the size of the City Council, which currently has 20 members
I'm at an early morning meeting of the @CityofMadison's Task Force on Structure of City Government. Mayor @Paulsoglin and three previous mayors - Dave Cieslewicz, Joel Skornicka and Joe Sensenbrenner - are here to share their thoughts
"We are in no way free of flooding concerns. Although we have sunshine in the near-term forecast, additional rain will again tax the levels of Lake Monona, the Yahara River and our storm sewer system," according to a statement from the city

"If the Tenney dam were to fail, we would have a catastrophic event far worse than what we‚Äôre experiencing now or even what we expect to experience," City Engineer Rob Phillips said

If Lake Mendota water levels aren't brought down, the dam at Tenney would "almost certainly be compromised." Failure of the dam would cause devastating flooding along the Yahara River, in the isthmus and area surrounding Lake Monona
From Madison mayor's office: At this point, Dane County staff estimates that the Yahara River through the isthmus will go up another 3 to 6 inches over the next 24 hours. (It was up by 5 inches yesterday). A 3 inch rise is expected for Lake Monona over the next 24 hours.

Just reflecting on the fact that I'm not sure I've ever been in a Taco Bell
"I‚Äôm thinking about the general situation in our community and how we as a council have responsibility for it," Ald. Rebecca Kemble, District 18, said. Adding one more venue that serves alcohol is not helping. It‚Äôs hurting that even if they have to close by 10."
"We did not see any security concerns with this applicant, and they appear to present a cogent, well thought out and flexible plan," Capt. Jason Freedman said
"Certainly, as the mayor said, we can turn this license down for any reason or no reason, but I do think we should have some criteria and standards that we would then apply to license requests," Ald. Ledell Zellers, District 2, said re: Taco Bell

Gennaco: If pending state legislation on body cameras passes, OIR would not recommend @madisonpolice use body cameras
"We‚Äôre generally impressed with the way the training division operates," OIR consultant Julie Ruhlin said
"We feel like there‚Äôs considerable room for the department to standardize and make more comprehensive its regular internal administrative review of (critical incidents)," OIR consultant Stephen Connolly said
"There seems to be a reluctance to provide constructive or helpful answers or to take a deep dive and report back to community," consultant Michael Gennaco said when critical incidents occur in Madison
One finding on @madisonpolice and community engagement: MPD is strong in taking constructive initiative but less effective in responding to conflicting view and critiques
"We offer our recommendations in a spirit of respect for the many effective features of the department and the changes we propose are both attainable and consistent with MPD's own articulated goals and values," from OIR Group's presentation

"There is risk involved in this project," Mayor @Paulsoglin said on the public market. "There is no question about it."
