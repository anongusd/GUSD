We will continue working with neighboring countries to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people.
The U.S. and international community recognize the legitimacy of Juan Guaid√≥ as Venezuela‚Äôs Interim President, and support the people of Venezuela in their effort to free themselves from Maduro‚Äôs dictatorship.
Time and time again, Maduro forces the Venezuelan people to pay the price, now depriving them of desperately needed food and medicine.
Violently blocking aid to ease the humanitarian crisis he created, Maduro‚Äôs latest moves to preserve his illegitimate dictatorship represent a new, detestable low. https://t.co/DWzfUeIKT3

I look forward to discussing enhanced border security proposals in the coming weeks and will continue pressing for passage of legislation to fully fund our  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, preventing another shutdown.
I strongly support border security, but holding the federal government hostage to push a specific policy proposal was inappropriate and not how our democracy should work.
The shutdown was irresponsible, causing harm to millions of Americans in the public and private sectors, damaging our economy, and weakening our safety and security.
