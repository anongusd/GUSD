@COBurrisM good luck, sir! Don't get sunburned
@COBurrisM and what a condescending way to put that, sir. If I cannot understand?
@COBurrisM not saying the system has failed. But are you saying you're certain there's no room for improvement?
@COBurrisM I think the success of our system is up for debate and that the purity of the vote is naive
@COBurrisM but then those with less $ have inherently less voice in their government. And that's how it is...but does it have to be as bad?
@COBurrisM and campaign finance reform might curb that. Won't stop it, nor should it. But maybe moderation is a good thing
@COBurrisM of course, but I think there are ways to make government more than certain people protecting their own interests
@COBurrisM please explain how it is those things, and it also didn't make mention of party because i think the problem is on both sides
@COBurrisM also, retweeting 1 tweet doesn't imply agreement on everything. But if there's no reform, only those with $ will control politics
@COBurrisM but not everyone has equal money I support politicians, and so power is so far from equal when it comes to political support
@COBurrisM If those are the inferences you draw from desiring campaign finance reform, then you are the one who is out of touch with reality
