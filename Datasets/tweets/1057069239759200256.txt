@SEAFORME1 @NAACP For both.
@Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr Wait so you fired them for investigating the President??
@SEAFORME1 @NAACP You might not like it but it's ultimately one of the smarter decisions. I'll be damned if I bring a kid into this world and I can't support them.
@BestLucious @brianschatz Have fun with that.
@SEAFORME1 @NAACP But that's essentially what you're saying. If they can't get abortions they'll have to continue to have kids without being able to provide proper financial support for those kids.
@tin_jay_ @ogjessee @m821j @EdKrassen Because I refuse to force somebody to birth a human being against their will.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN That is THEIR problem. We have no obligation to go running around trying to save everybody's assets. This is the risk that comes with international trade and that is what they will have to deal with. 		That is their country so it's hardly an act of war.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN It's because of something my mom taught me when I was a kid: mind your own damn business. We can't go waging economic war for every corporation that gets stolen from. They knew the risk so they should deal with it.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN This is the risk that these companies take. It's THEIR assets. So it is THEIR responsibility to get those assets back. We don't have to do anything to help them. The best solution is to mind our own business.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN They've ruled against Venezuela regarding their Human Rights Violations. The individual companies like Exxon, Conoco, and Cemex have to go through the ICC and other institutions to try and get assets back. This does not require us to intervene in any way.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN Great. Now understand this: that is their business. Not ours. I don't care if they nationalize the grass they step on. It's not our business. This is for Venezuela and Venezuela alone to deal with.
@ThomasH15744537 @BobNEastSac @GavinNewsom She looks like a melted Barbie doll
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN That's a risky every company takes when branching into foreign countries. We have no obligation to bail out these corporations.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN You can't tell a sovereign nation what they can and can't do with their economy. If they want to go full Soviet Union then that's none of our business.
@GOP @VP Shut the fuck up. It's embarrassing how you conflate Israel and AIPAC with all Jews.
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN Then we should lift the sanctions and stop trying to influence other countries.
RT @venanalysis: .@IlhanMN to Elliott Abrams, "Would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes again…
@AnonymousOneP @venanalysis @IlhanMN And you think military interventionism is going to help them? If anything we'll get our asses handed to us like we did in Vietnam or it'll come back to bite us in our ass like 9/11 did.
@forzaquattro77 @venanalysis @IlhanMN You must be upset.
@MarekZee @Supermario289 @business So all you have are anecdotals and hearsay? Because our actual history of interventionism is documented and it rarely works out for the country being "liberated."
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Sure.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Now I know you don't know what a straw man is.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Exactly. So point out where I stated that you said racism and homophobia didn't exist?
One of the greatest. https://t.co/V0DnKtxetr
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Where did I state that you denied either of the two didn't exist?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek What's with the links? And it's nice that you're in denial now.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Sure it was.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Where did I say we were a land of homophobia? I said we're home to homophobia, which is true. Just like we're home to racism. There is an advantage and it's to appeal to the degenerates of society. But you have fun with this lala land you're living in.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Yes, you just admitted it.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek What on Earth does that have to do with anything? The point is there is homophobia in America and there's no shortage of people willing to roll back your rights if given the opportunity. You'd rather turn a blind eye to this.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Nobody said you were, but to pretend the religious right is your friend is just ridiculous.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek False. Hillary lost because she didn’t campaign effectively.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Because you want to force people to birth children.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek So you’re going to pretend America isn’t home to homophobia?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek So you admit the religious right isn’t hell bent on helping gays?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek “Logical fallacies” *uses Twitter to prove point*
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Their heartbeat bill. It’s clear you don’t pay attention.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Now it’s abortion restrictions. Next it’ll be abortion bans.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek If you remembered history you’d remember how familiar this is. The religious right still wants gays to be in the closet. But of course you’re oblivious to this.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Unless you’ve been in a cave there’s clear evidence that ACA helped more Americans than it hurt.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Of course you don’t because you don’t pay attention. Just look at Ohio. “Not a big deal.” Right. You don’t even know what Communism is and that’s what they’ll use to justify more Red Scare era tactics against you.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It’s cause for concern. You forget history so easily.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek More like “A few people were hurt but overall millions were helped and given healthcare.” I understand you want people to not have healthcare but you’ll get over it.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Me and my family have healthcare so you're barking up the wrong tree with that nonsense.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Yeah, no. There was literally pages full of restrictions. Is that why Trump still has the ACA around? Obama helped millions and whether you like it or not single payer is the future.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Let's hope you never get pregnant and decide you don't want a kid. I wonder how they felt with the travel ban. Communists = a reason to step on your rights. Honestly, Americans didn't learn anything from the Red Scare.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Whatever you say.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek The restrictions do matter, kid. ACA was a step forward and the next step will be single Payer.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek You're delusional if you think the Republicans want smaller government. They're the ones who want to tell you what you can and can't do with your body, who you can and can't marry, and don't even think about mentioning Communism or Muslims. You'll get a repeat of Op CHAOS.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek I was comparing the way you spun it. Try and keep up.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek You think Republicans are any different?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek That's an interesting way to spin it. Now let's talk about Nixon.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It wasn't perfect but it worked for millions. Without it there would be millions more without healthcare and that's a fact. All of the restrictions placed on it didn't help either.

@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Glad you know how to use Twitter.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek The first sentence is actually something you refuse to accept. They definitely fixed the problem for my family. This is why the US is falling behind other countries.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek "ignorant new bashing bigot" despite never mentioning Jews?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Because criticizing Israel and AIPAC isn't anti-Semitic. All religions are intolerant, save for a select few. The sooner you understand that the easier life will be. I honestly didn't care either way. We need a single payer system.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Whatever you say.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It's literally all in the thread. Everytime somebody mentions Israel or AIPAC you replace it with Jews and call them anti-Semitic. Noam Chomsky really had it right.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Now I'm convinced you have no idea what you're talking about.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Maybe read a bit slower.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Did I ever claim to be?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek At this point it's clear you're set on conflating Israel with all Jews. I don't know what else to tell you.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Sure they have. Ignore that he ditched a base because Russia didn't like it.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek That wasn't me attacking a position. That was me saying "you're obviously too stubborn to ever change your mind so peace out."
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek More of the same Israel=all Jews. Is it too much to ask that Israel be held to the same standards as other countries without being called anti-Semitic?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek I don't think you actually know what a straw man argument is.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek And what does this say about Trump's close relationship with Putin?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek You're obviously set in your mind. Just watch out for the day you won't even be able to put "Israel" and "bad" in the same sentence without being called Hitler.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Hate against lobbying? Sure.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek They've repeatedly mocked each other.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Pelosi called her out because the Dems have no spine. Not to mention they benefit the most from the Pro-Israel lobby.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek You must be new to Churches. They all preach some degree of hate and intolerance.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek I'm calling the state that America's in dangerous.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek In order for him to be a terrorist he would've had to commit an act of terrorism. "We fell in love after beautiful letters." Nah, that goes a bit beyond diplomatic relations.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek I doubt Trump has ever set foot in a Church. I don't see your point here. When I went to Church, thankfully that's in the past, my pastor constantly attacked Muslims and gays. You pretend that the hatred of other religions isn't actively practiced in America's churches.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek The fundraiser is to aid Yemen. Is she supposed to turn it down because of comments somebody else made? What could be said of Trump with his "close" relationships with dictators and his appointment of John Bolton?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Once again, did she say Jews or Israel? It's truly dangerous when one can't criticize a country without being called anti-Semitic.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Farrakhan wasn't a politician and it's foolish to pretend that the Democrats hold a monopoly on "anti-Semitism."
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Did she say Jews or Israel? Once again you're conflating the Israeli government with all Jews.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It's common knowledge AIPAC donates to Pro-Israel PACS. There's nothing wrong with seeing Israel as an ally but these donations aren't for that. They're for turning a blind eye to the fact that Israel isn't held to the same standards.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Did she directly mention Jews? Or did she say AIPAC and Israel?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek I'm actually not a Democrat but I'm still glad she highlighted the issue of lobbying in the US. It makes sense she had to apologize though. Politics will always be politics.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It seems all of these have the same general message that Ilhan's AIPAC and Israel lobby comments were anti-Semitic. It actually highlights what I've been saying. The American people have a problem when it comes to conflating the Israeli government with all Jews.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek It actually shows that the religious right is no friend to anybody but themselves. The fact that they despised it counts for something.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek The second sentence is actually a problem that's happening now. You can criticize Israel and AIPAC without hating Jews.
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek The same religious right that had a meltdown when gay marriage was legalized?
@0ryuge @HellaciousFemme @TweetTillBanned @Newsweek Anti-Semitic or just critical of Israel? Conflating Israel with all Jews isn't healthy.
@0ryuge @TweetTillBanned @HellaciousFemme @Newsweek The same Trump that said "Technology — nobody knows more about technology than me?" You didn't finish your second question but I'll assume you're asking if I support it?

@chanaro103 So I hate America because I enjoy exercising my freedom of speech?

@MarekZee @Supermario289 @business We've funded opposition groups before. They've always been corrupt and many are famous for their human rights violations. Ever heard of the Contra rebels? Or any Columbian paramilitary group? The Soviet Union collapsed due to economic reasons.
@MarekZee @Supermario289 @business The US will definitely "liberate" you. Then they'll steal your resources and place corrupt puppet leaders to lead your country. Maybe Venezuela will turn out like Iran. They turned into a theocracy after the US overthrew their elected Prime Minister.

@joeycham72 @GenevaChristie @trytofollowthe1 @mgcanmore @RepMarkMeadows You can be afraid of Communism all you want but you can't use that to justify overthrowing elected governments and sponsoring radical terrorists.
@joeycham72 @GenevaChristie @trytofollowthe1 @mgcanmore @RepMarkMeadows We didn’t HAVE to do any of that. We wanted to because the government and media brainwashed everybody to be afraid of communism. We literally had no reason to try and overthrow multiple foreign governments.
@joeycham72 @GenevaChristie @trytofollowthe1 @mgcanmore @RepMarkMeadows Yeah, no. These groups were trying to overthrow governments and committed multiple human rights violations. The Contra rebels are a famous example of this.
@SmerkNews @business Technological advancement comes with a price. That doesn’t mean we should hide under the bed every time we take a step forward.

@SmerkNews @business I’m sorry you’re afraid of technological advancement.
@joeycham72 @GenevaChristie @trytofollowthe1 @mgcanmore @RepMarkMeadows The US literally sponsors terrorists all the time. We’ve sponsored multiple Cuban terrorists, Contra rebels, Columbian paramilitary groups, and many others.

@DanCrenshawTX Same thing with El Paso. Construction on the wall started in late 2008, not 2006,and ended in early 2009. 2006 is when they made the decision to build the barriers. So apprehensions were already decreasing before the barrier was constructed. https://t.co/HvV3ATAcP0

@taco_adorable @thehill I can tell you worked hard to become stupid.
@JenMax57 The Pro-Israel lobby has both parties by the balls. It's embarrassing how adamant Americans are on conflating the Israel government with all Jews.
@realDonaldTrump @StateDept So is this gonna be a repeat of the Iranian Coup? Because the last time we installed a puppet leader the Iranian people revolted and turned the country into a theocracy.
@TedCornwell @Anthony96845950 @brandon_r_horan @IlhanMN Where do you get off conflating the State of Israel with all Jews?
@latimes Well shit, I could’ve told you that.

@JenMax57 It’s incredible how everyone turns a blind eye to this.

@Biased_ca @latimes @BarackObama I'm suggesting we celebrate a revolution against a corrupt US backed puppet leader.
@Biased_ca @latimes @BarackObama Well, coups do tend to move countries backwards.
@Biased_ca @latimes @BarackObama Who wouldn't be celebrating the date that the Iranian people revolted against the puppet leader installed by the US and UK?
@helloall6480 @thehill Since when is divorce and adultery? Maybe Congress should look at Trump too.
@CNNPolitics Of course he does.
@ConImpeach @katelyn41886 @CNN It's not healthy to conflate the State of Israel with all Jews.
@thehill Why should they? She's right. So now everybody is just going to pretend that lobbying doesn't exist in the US?
@CNN I wish she would use this opportunity to denounce all forms of lobbying in the US but this is a start.
@whitesmokegreen @RepDougCollins You're not wrong. Both parties love using black people in rallies and pictures because they think it makes them seem less racist and more accepting.
@RepDougCollins @HouseGOP Can we stop pretending that lobbying doesn't exist? Everybody knows AIPAC buys out politicians using Pro-Israel PACs.
@trenk_harry @thehill Aipac uses Pro-Israel PACs to buy politicians.
@MarsMerc4 @AIPAC It's so we can "maintain a presence" in the ME.
@elonmusk https://t.co/Yw2L1dPcdG
@thehill But they actually are. Are we going to act like lobbying doesn't exist in the US?
@CNNPolitics So when did criticizing Israel become antisemitism? America has really been brainwashed.

@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Yes, there should be more information given to women who are considering abortion. I'm all for educating anybody who's considering having an abortion.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Agreed.
And to think I was actually looking forward to Hell. https://t.co/U04NjjSgF9
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller The norm to have abortions or the norm for doctors to perform them?
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Then give women pamphlets about abortion and the psychological effects it may cause. Don't use the possible psychological effects as justification for barring them from having late term abortions. I would like to think most women have already looked into abortion a great deal.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Doctors wouldn't perform abortions because the mindset held by Americans back then is entirely different than what it is now. More doctors are willing to perform abortions now than ever. Even now doctors can still refuse to perform abortions.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You could say the same for Trump.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Do you know what stagflation is?
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Mental health is serious. But it is NOT an excuse to make somebody do anything they don't want. Late term abortions should be up to the mother and the mother only.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You know that's factually incorrect.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller So we should force people to birth children because there may be psychological repercussions? It's their choice. If their choice results in psychological effects then that will be for them to deal with. The government should have no say in a woman's personal affairs.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Ohhhh, I see. The figure 0?

@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You said Obama was a cipher.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro If you watched the full video you can see he was answering a question about Carrier Corp jobs. More specifically the plant they closed in Indiana.
@bobbrandt362 @TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @DailyCaller "Not her choice." You realize once you bar others from certain rights you make it easier for your own rights to be taken away?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Obama was.. a disguised way of writing?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Are you even LOOKING at the graphs? The numbers have been soaring. What do you mean it "doesn't matter?" It doesn't matter that whoever you got that graph from purposely tried to undermine Obama's job growth??
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You see how they conveniently cut off all of Obama's growth by starting their graph in 2015? https://t.co/ccbm8NAgKD
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Who said that?		Trump may be ignorant but he isn't stupid. All he had to do was take credit for the economy which was easy after Obama was vilified during his terms. Just like how he bragged about "his" low unemployment rate just months after his inauguration.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro I've already addressed full time employment in earlier screenshots. Obama also increased manufacturing employment so. https://t.co/T223wd2ay5
@realDonaldTrump Just- why would you tweet this? What on Earth could've compelled you to make such a statement?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro I honestly don't even know where to begin on your last two sentences. Those are some amazing gymnastics.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Trump obviously isn't creating more if the growth rate is still the same as it was 3 years ago. This is the same BLS from 3 years ago so if Obama's numbers were inflated then Trump's "numbers" must be inflated as well.
@benjaminzcapon @SenSanders You really can't. It started when we overthrew their elected prime minister for nationalizing their oil refineries. America will get what it deserves one day.
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Why should there be repercussions for somebody making a personal decision? The bottom line is that you can't force anybody to birth a human being.
@tin_jay_ @ogjessee @m821j @EdKrassen How you got to that point is beyond me but no. I believe that no child is worth forcing somebody to birth them.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro That's actually not necessarily a bad thing. Alternative work dominated the labor market in the past and even with Trump in office the alternative work force is still growing. Independent Contractors are also just self employed. BTW Obama did create full time jobs. Lots of them. https://t.co/RzH8kMdpH6
@benjaminzcapon @SenSanders Honestly, I can't blame Iran for chanting Death to America. America can't mind its own business for shit.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Opposition to all abortions is forcing a woman to give birth.
@RJNewsflash So you're going to promote "pro-american truths?"
@marykmaui @CNN What about Justice for the thousands killed due to gun violence?
@GOPChairwoman MS-13 is an American born gang though.
@JenMax57 @Gregoryholder7 @ajamubaraka We haven't been free since before the 1930s. After the Red Scare our freedoms were thrown out of the window along with any hope of a transparent government.

@realDonaldTrump Isn't the Senate run by a Republican majority?
@Alexand16635371 @kittypgrl @SteveScalise America isn't a theocracy. You can't justify forcing somebody to birth a child because of your Sky Daddy.
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Great. However, that doesn't mean you can force somebody to have a child just because you think they're suffering.
@hb348 @scotusreporter It could also be a future Hitler or Stalin.
@JR22457950 @CNN Because stuff like this is why the NSA is out of control now.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You're going to use the Hill as a source? You know we have an actual BLS site, right? The number of people who wanted a job but weren't in the labor force was actively declining at arguably the same rate it is now in 2015. https://t.co/gj3QblVpP7
@tin_jay_ @ogjessee @m821j @EdKrassen Nobody's saying they aren't less alive. But they're not worth forcing somebody to birth them.
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Suffering is a bit dramatic. Depending on what stage it's in the child more than likely won't even know what's going on and most abortions are generally very quick.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Yes, they actually do. Especially in clinics in the Bible Belt.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller There are other factors that go into why a woman might not use or have access to contraceptives such as social pressure, beliefs, parents, etc. The people hanging around with signs at clinics certainly don't make things easier.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Clearly it's not just part time growth. LFP rising could also mean less people are retiring and older citizens are being forced to go find work. Too many factors go into LFP to use it as the sole measure of our economy. https://t.co/XWh2FjcdLx
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Are you seriously saying people who can't afford children should just give up on sex? Do you have any idea how unrealistic that is?
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Was that a joke?
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Again with the false equivalencies. An extracurricular activity is not the same as a biological function. Whether you like it or not humans have sex and will continue to have sex. That's how we've survived. Abstinence has been proven to be ineffective.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller And according to a Guttmacher report 3/4 of patients have abortions due to financial circumstances and schooling or work.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Where did I state that people aren't using contraceptives? Over 60% of reproductive age women use contraceptives. Nobody chooses abortion because its fun. What's considered a "misuse" of a woman's body is subjective to each woman.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller The man isn't the one who has to push out a human. Yes, it may be the man's child but the man does not bear the same burden that the woman does. When giving men a voice means giving them to option to force a human to birth a child then that voice is not needed.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Imo the State has no business interfering in a woman's pregnancy and neither does the father. If somebody doesn't want to birth a child then that is their business and their business only.
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Yes, we are talking about a human being. Now why should a person be forced to birth another human being against their will? I, for one, don't believe in making anybody grow human inside of them if they don't want to. Especially when it's just a bundle of cells.
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Are you just talking to talk at this point?
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller So you know that the majority of reproductive age people don't use contraceptives? The child is leeching off of the mother's body. Why should you not be able to choose whether or not you want to grow a human inside of you?
@charliekirk11 @TrueAmerican448 So we're just pulling numbers out of our asses now?
@TrueAmerican448 @UGotThatWrite @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller I understand false equivalencies are all the rage this decade but try to control yourself. You can still get pregnant while using contraceptives. Did you know that? Well if you're going to force somebody to have a child then you should also give that child free healthcare.
@UGotThatWrite @TrueAmerican448 @bobbrandt362 @DailyCaller Because the father isn't the one pushing the baby out.

@Gregoryholder7 @ajamubaraka @JenMax57 Actually it's because we said "fuck their freedom, we need oil" and operated a coup that overthrew their elected Prime Minister.
@ajamubaraka Because they didn't want to let foreign countries run their oil supplies anymore.

@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Where did I claim to be a representative of every black person? I said "we" because I am black.

@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro I'm honestly so lost on why you are so obsessed with black people and how we vote. It fits because most of it fits. Literally just go and compare and contrast.

@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Now that we've got the timeline settled, we can actually focus on platforms.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Why are you so focused on Jackson? We're talking about Jeffersonian Democracy.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro We're arguing against two different things then.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You know Jackson wasn't the only leader of the Jacksonian Democracy philosophy, right? He's just in the name. "central government as the enemy of individual liberty" So this doesn't fit with most conservatives today?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro So THAT is the Democratic Party today? The party that believes state's rights must not be violated?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Why do you keep thinking the party switch is dependent on the party’s civil rights stance at the time? The fact is that the Democrats and Republicans gradually switched platforms. Who ever said that equal rights was the cause of that switch?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Does THIS really sound like the Dems today?
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro “Jeffersonian values are best expressed through an organized political party. The Jeffersonian party was officially the "Republican Party" (political scientists later called it the Democratic-Republican Party to differentiate it from the later Republican Party of Lincoln)” https://t.co/nmuguZ8xeR
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro The Dems used to be the party of conservatism, that is a fact. The party switch is a documented historical fact. Nobody is trying to absolve the Dems of their history but the fact is that the Dems today do not stand on the same platform as the Dems of the 1800s.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro None, to my knowledge.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro If I was referring to the Manifest Destiny I would've mentioned the Manifest Destiny. So far, you're the only one trying to fault a single ideology for slavery.
@scholt7 @thehill I love how people try and deny the political switch. It really shows that an education reform is needed in America.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro You're trying to tie slavery to a single political ideology and it's not going to go well for you.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro The Whig party was internally divided over the issue of slavery as Henry Clay demonstrated. The Republicans were also left of the Democrats in that era as they advocated for income tax, federally subsidized railroads, and an extensive pension program.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Let's observe a policy then. Jacksonian Democrats tended to oppose programs such as educational reform and the establishment of a public educational system. Does this sound like the Democratic party today? Literally nobody in the thread has stated that as evidence of a switch.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Yes, conservatives have been for the Constitution. Now get this: if somebody isn't considered a person then how can enslaving them be against the Constitution? However you spin it those were real conservatives who really supported slavery.
@vincelauro @CactusCaviar @RadicalWarlock @seanhannity Watch out. You might get a repeat of the Family Jewels with all this anti-communism you're trying to spread.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro I've seen this before. You try and focus on the name rather than the platform to keep the narrative that Democrats have and always will be for slavery and racism.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro I'm trying to explain that the conservatives of the 1800s supported slavery. Nobody is saying that slavery belongs to either side of the political spectrum, but the fact is that these actual conservatives supported slavery because blacks we're not considered human back then.
@ngdale @nytimes @jbouie He definitely wasn't a youth.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Forget the Democratic Party today. We know right now they are for big government. The issue is what they were. 		Why do you think conservatives opposed slavery? The conservative Dems of the 1800s both supported slavery and individual rights. Jacksonian Democracy?
@selftestok @NBCNews America is actually the biggest sponsor of terrorism. Not to mention we're the only ones to have ever used nuclear bombs. Israel shouldn't even exist and what "end of times" are you referring to?
@selftestok @NBCNews Okay, you seem to be under the impression that Iran has always been a theocracy. Prior to the coup Iran was a constitutional monarchy with an elected Prime Minister. Iran didn't become a theocracy until 1979 when the people rebelled against the US backed puppet leader.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro They've shown to have been for individual rights throughout history numerous times. It's why so many factory workers and farmers voted for them in the 1800s. Of course, back then slavery was considered an individual right to some as blacks weren't really considered human.
@d_town_west @WashTimes Does it hurt lying throug your teeth like that?
@CactusCaviar @RadicalWarlock @seanhannity When the mother who's forced to have a baby is all of a sudden a "freeloader."
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro As long as you understand that a State and "The State" isn't the same, idc. So you agree that the Dems switched from individual state's rights to big government?Conservatives have historically been opposed to abolition. Just look at the southern Dems of the civil war.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro "a word or phrase that is not formal or literary, typically one used in ordinary or familiar conversation." Yes, it does not make you correct.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro In any other country that would be correct. Here the word "state" is commonly used to refer to the 50 states in the Union. A big state government here does not equal a large federal government.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Massive state control or massive federal government? There is a difference and they are not the same.
@missmalevolent @eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro State's rights doesn't equal big federal government.
@selftestok @NBCNews It's really not the same. Maybe he thinks he understands how the 13th century worked but he has no idea how the world works today. Iran chants death to America because the US has an obsession with toppling foreign democratic governments in the name of "freedom."
@eliquious @McMullen71 @Billybeeswife @Chascabass @DavidAFrench @benshapiro If the parties never switched platforms then the Democrats should be the ones fighting for state's rights and lower taxes.
@selftestok @NBCNews Literally every nation back then was expanding and conquering neighboring countries. The only reason the Byzantines even existed was because the Roman Empire couldn't acquire enough slaves due to lack of conquest which eventually led to the Empire splitting.
@selftestok @NBCNews I'm sure it's not because of the 1953 Iranian coup that installed a corrupt regime.
@selftestok @NBCNews And continue to wonder why they want us all dead.
@TURK_l82 @NBCNews Yes, this low quality Facebook video is just brimming with evidence.
@TinasmkTina @ireneand4js @GOP It actually wasn't considered a crisis but nice try. I don't think a steadily decreasing illegal Immigration rate is a crisis and we actually can help both of those problems without a ridiculous wall. You literally have no way of knowing how many illegals aren't apprehended.
@Momx4x6 @goBlu3221 @GeraldLangenho1 @seanhannity @POTUS Or we could stop funding Israel and cut our defense spending.
@FightFrOurFutu1 @thehill That's educational.
@PolHistMaven @RepLeeZeldin @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Being Anti-Israel isn't the same as being anti-Semitic.
@RepHagan Is it that hard to mind your own business?
@pingzibuman @thehill Why do you people confuse tolerance with kindness?
@TinasmkTina @ireneand4js @GOP We've had millions before. If it wasn't a crisis in the 90s then it isn't a crisis now. If you were really worried about American lives you would do something about our healthcare or our gun violence which kills more Americans than illegal immigrants do every year. https://t.co/PZePFY8rJE
@seanhannity You people know this literally changes nothing because of MAD, right?
@TinasmkTina @ireneand4js @GOP Yea, this isn't a crisis. They're not coming in huge numbers. Illegal Immigration has dropped 80% over the past 2 decades. If it wasn't a crisis back then it's definitely not a crisis now.

@UalreadyK @CraftFan33 @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC The "American way of life" is subjective to each person who resides in the US. Without socialism you wouldn't even have major highways.
@RobbsLisaGirl @bwott @rjp674 @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ I never said I thought it was baby. I said it can be CONSIDERED a baby. Meaning one could call it a baby if they thought about it long enough.
@kwareroha @MSNBC It's all good
@kwareroha @MSNBC It was his personal page. It doesn't matter if he was actually in the picture or not because he chose that picture for his page.
@daynutrition @MSNBC You're just going to sit here and act like the Republicans and Democrats didn't switch platforms? There's a reason why the KKK still pushes for conservative values.
@UalreadyK @CraftFan33 @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC That's incredibly false. Even independent reports such as CRFB and Prospect don't even estimate the costs will be that high. Single Payer Healthcare is literally working right now in multiple countries.
@lilspec03 @ChrisCoons I really hope you're not trying to say that the discrimination that the Irish faced is somehow equal to the discrimination that blacks faced.
@searcher1964 @washingtonpost Is it 17,500 cases or 17,500 people? The Human Trafficking arrest statistics don't agree with the claim that most traffickers come from our southern border. https://t.co/jvxirXn5XF

@RichtonStokoe @ganglywhitegirl @kaitlancollins @Geneva_Sands Using that logic we should place soldiers in space since we've never caught an alien in space before.

@RiverFred11 @realDonaldTrump Israel shouldn't even exist. Whatever "intelligence" they have is probably just a repeat of what our own intelligence agencies have been saying.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So how exactly is it possible that we're seeing your tweet on a platform that's censoring you?

@jelindafaye @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Anecdotal evidence has little value.
@zacbrown13 @ananavarro They voted for fencing. Not a concrete wall.
@RobbsLisaGirl @bwott @rjp674 @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ It's definitely anecdotal. You're using a personal experience to justify a policy. If you want to call it killing babies then call it killing babies. It still won't justify invading a woman's body because you want every baby to born.
@RobbsLisaGirl @bwott @rjp674 @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ More than likely just before the third trimester. Either way, anecdotal evidence doesn't trump a woman's right to control her body and anything that's in her body.
@ksweark @TexasHauteness @alexdallocchio @KellyannePolls Illegal immigration dropped 80% over the past two decades and this was without a concrete wall. It's really not a big concern.
@seanhannity Remember when conservatives had the government interfering in everybody's life? *Cough* family jewels *cough*
@UalreadyK @CraftFan33 @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Taxes will pay for it, obviously. If Universal Healthcare makes America socialist then we're already socialist. Our military is paid for by taxes, our roads, our first responders, etc. We might as well be communist if Universal Healthcare makes us socialist.
@RobbsLisaGirl @bwott @rjp674 @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ It can only be considered a "baby" after the third trimester. Before that its just a bundle of cells.
@RobbsLisaGirl @bwott @rjp674 @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls @mboyle1 @mschlapp @MattRooneyNJ As long as the "baby" is inside of the mother it has no rights.
@cvpayne A cheer because the President is incompetent?

@ShanePi30413661 @nychicksinger @JayAustinJA @AliHyderBhutto9 @VP @POTUS Pretty callous for a "Christian."
@DennisInAmerica @Mikyathemad @GladstoneMI @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @IlhanMN We only added "In God We Trust" in the 1950s. America is a secular nation, or at least it was before conservatives became obsessed with Communism.
@UalreadyK @CraftFan33 @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC You say you care about babies but then you don't want to give them healthcare or welfare.
@natsukurosaki48 @MSNBC @PeteWilliamsNBC Sorry, but anecdotal evidence doesn't mean shit.
@KellyannePolls @DesJarlaisTN04 How on Earth did they do that without a wall?
@TexasHauteness @ksweark @alexdallocchio @KellyannePolls You must not be paying attention if you think our Southern Border is our biggest concern.
@RepLoudermilk Illegal immigration dropped  without a concrete wall. That's what happened.
@seanhannity Good. This isn't a theocracy.
@clmuseum @adornedtroy @Dpe877Dan @seanhannity Because the US became obsessed with Communism and wasted time, effort, money, and lives trying to be the opposite of the USSR.
@Ernesto19905809 @spiritflower4 @Johnny_Who_ @RepMaxineWaters @ProfBlackmon I live in St. Louis. Does that mean I should never leave my house?

@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy Are you trying to claim that deforestation in rural areas is the cause of these wildfires in these forests? You seem very confused. https://t.co/tLgzzbdrOa
@moekamerow @washingtonpost You know net worth isn’t just somebody’s salary added up, right?
@JQuinn7077 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Cali only owns 2-3% of forests in the state. The federal government owns the largest portion of the forests with private industrial owners following behind. Cali is only responsible for the state owned and, to some extent, private non industrial forests.
@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy “At the same time, California’s forests are feeling the impacts of population growth. Urbanization, development and parcelization in rural areas are changing land use away from forests.” Nowhere does it state urbanization is the primary cause of forest fires.
@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy Butte, Ventura, Trinity, and Shasta County. Shasta-Trinity fire was human related with the rest still being under investigation. You know most of that link is just repeating what I’ve been saying?
@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy The most devastating 2018 Cali fires all started in areas where the federal government and/or private industries own large portions of the land.		👉🏿 https://t.co/QqrC1YnKKD
@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy That’s actually not true. A lot of these fires are on privately and federally owned land.	👉🏿 https://t.co/adL7XYxLtR	👉🏿 https://t.co/QmAK4GPfMH
@thehill Does he know that Cali state only owns 2-3% of its forests? The federal government owns around 50-60%.
@JQuinn7077 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Part of it is humidity. Florida is a lot more humid than California and that dry heat sparks fires more easily.
@jdmorgan11 @SenatorLeahy The state only owns 2 percent of the forests that cover Cali, the rest is owned by the federal government.
@LillyAmerica1 @lisamurkowski @POTUS They voted for the Secure Fence Act. Not for the Ridiculous Concrete Wall Act.
@ThePlumbLine50 So how have our illegal Border crossings gone down 80% of the past 2 decades and all without a border wall? Most illegal immigrants now simply overstay visas.
@mona_cajun @lori_kuss @WhiteHouse If a wall actually stopped anything then maybe it could be considered border security.

@jthebombdotcom @jrpaws @kimsuejim @joelpollak @DonaldJTrumpJr The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank so that says something. $5.7 going to a wall that won’t work is a waste. Your point isn’t factually accurate.

@ethnicasting @USATODAY Did I say it was acceptable? If anything it proves that we can decrease the amount of illegal Border crossings without a crackpot concrete wall.
@ethnicasting @USATODAY Not because of him lmao. Illegal Border crossings have gone down 80 percent over the past two decades.
@SebGorka They called for the construction of FENCING. Not a concrete wall.
@Ethan_Wild12 @cougarjoe2 @andrew_amarone @DanCrenshawTX Comparing the walls of a housing structure to a wall along our entire Southern Border, nice.
@mumcock @ChrisMurphyCT The government has actually been in a legal battle with these property owners for years for trying to seize their land.
@artknapp88 @hardball @MSNBC @RepJeffries I doubt the number of those who slipped through exceeds the number of people who’ve been caught. Fixing our immigration system and going after the employers who hire these illegal immigrants should be first before a concrete wall is considered.
@ThePlumbLine50 @CNN Border security doesn’t equal a concrete wall. They even tried to give him $2.5B for his ridiculous wall and he turned it down.
@ravencottage1 @Daverha1 @seanhannity The photo is, quite obviously, putting legal and illegal immigrants into these two categories. Saying that illegal immigrants are the same as the cop killer and that legal immigrants are the same as the officer.
@ravencottage1 @Daverha1 @seanhannity I just want you to know that’s a pretty far leap. I wasn’t defending the cop killer I was pointing out how crazy the generalization was.
@ravencottage1 @Daverha1 @seanhannity Is every criminal an alleged murderer?
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Illegal Border crossings have actually gone down. Addressing the root cause will fix a lot of our illegal immigrant problems, not building a wall.
@ravencottage1 @Daverha1 @seanhannity The picture clearly says “murderer.” Being a criminal is not the same as being a murderer.
@breenbrooke @Earwormz4U @RevDrBarber @Resist___45 Dems are turning on her because she’s calling out their corporate masters.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Except the facts disagree with that claim. It’s been proven that the majority of illegal immigrants aren’t trying to cross the desert into our country, that’s why. Trump just doesn’t want to address the employers that hire these illegal immigrants.
@ravencottage1 @Daverha1 @seanhannity Yes, really. Unless he personally knows every legal and illegal immigrant in the US.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics That’s quite clearly a fence. It’s not about looks, it’s about effectiveness. A border wall along our entire Southern Border won’t stop illegal immigrants. It’s already been proven that most illegal immigrants come in through our airports and other legal points of entry.
@Daverha1 @seanhannity That’s a very extreme generalization.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Because it was 800 miles of FENCING. Not 800 miles of a ridiculous concrete wall.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics He said “we’ll make the wall out of steel.” That’s not compromise, it’s dumb. Do you know how much money it would cost to keep something like that maintained? Obama called it a humanitarian crisis because people are dying at the border, not because of “suspected ME terrorists.”
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics You sent two links about Fentanyl and I’ve debunked all of your “facts.” Nobody wanted a wall. Hillary, Obama, and Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act which added fencing. Not a concrete wall. https://t.co/s1X9ULWr62
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics I doubt it, seeing as how Sarah Sanders has to lie about them.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics The Vatican and Israel aren’t in the US. I don’t think you know the difference between a wall and a fence. San Diego lawmakers have also condemned Trump’s wall as they literally just built a bridge between the two countries. It’s bias because Trump has made the wall political.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics There’s very little evidence that illegal immigrants are crossing our southern border, which is why Sarah Sanders tried to lie to Wallace about it. A wall didn’t help China or Berlin. It’s still bias btw.
@RepRWilliams @POTUS Nothing changed, they just knew a crackpot wall wasn’t going to solve anything. Why did POTUS reject the addition 2.5B for border security?
@heyitsmatthewb @CNN https://t.co/BTqlnK0Ufu Compared to other cities of similar population size LA has a pretty low vehicle per household rate. Maybe it would help if you tried to read a bit slower.

@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Advocacy for the wall shows political bias as it is not the only way to limit illegal immigration and it means that this author and guest are more than likely using these “facts” as an excuse to make the wall seem like a more viable option.
@Margare49176752 @moniqueray71 @realDonaldTrump Is that what Fox News told you?
@TalkMMA @CanesLawMarty @realDonaldTrump If there are stragglers then they aren’t defeated. He’s just trying to make himself look good.
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics You realize that the advocacy of this Border Wall displays bias?
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Nowhere does it state that most of Fentanyl in the US comes through the Southern Border, only that “Much of the illicit fentanyl consumed in the U.S. originates in China, but is often smuggled through Mexico.”

@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN I guarantee that there are more than a couple families in Houston suffering because of this but I’m sure your magic Catholic Church and Charity button will save them better than their paychecks could.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN You can have a border without a damn wall. Nobody yet has proposed open borders. It’s even crazier that most immigrants come by plane and not the southern border. He’s just scared to go after the corporations that hire these undocumented immigrants because he loves Big Business.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Please tell me EXACTLY what you think the mayor can do for 800+ families.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Kid, I honestly don’t know how else to explain something so simple to you. Catholic Charities can’t support 800+ people and their families when they live paycheck to paycheck. SSI checks won’t support these people and their families. There’s no magic “village help” spell for them
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics You’re getting so close to the answer. China is the primary exporter of Fentanyl to the US. That means most Fentanyl comes through our ports, not our Southern Border.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN If he was doing so well with his border wall before the shutdown then why shut down the government and stop that progress? He should use his own millions for that useless wall.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN You think Churches and Charities can support 800+ people and their families? The SSA is literally one of the few government services still open and I promise that whatever type of “help” you’re thinking of won’t support these people.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN No I live in St. Louis, MO and this city definitely can’t help the 800+ government workers here who aren’t getting paid. I actually feel bad for the government workers who live in rural areas.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Last I checked Trump was the one who promised Mexico would pay for the wall. And then when they offered to give him 2.5B for his wall he declined and shut down the government. Trump already owned the shutdown and he should stop with the bs.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Friendly Warning: Watch out when another one of Trump’s crackpot ideas eventually affects your life.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN My brother and my mother are both government workers and Trump has no safety net for them. Your callous disregard for the lives of government workers is honestly disgusting. If you think ALL of America are going to help these people then you’re delusional.
@O_MARQZ @MorningGloryxo @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Doesn’t matter how smart you are, if you live paycheck to paycheck like most people then you CAN’T last without your paycheck for a few months. They NEED the President to stop being a brat and give them their paychecks.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Your whole tweet is literally unrealistic bs.
@PaulHarrop9 @Sooslover9 @GOP @marc_lotter @VP “Paid vacation” show me what you’re smoking.
@LaRuse7 @firebellys @Skippphipps @IlhanMN Does the Border Patrol Council make up all of the 800,000 workers that don’t get paid?
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics Do you know what exporter means?
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN Show me the community that can help 800,000 people with no paychecks. I don’t know what imaginary land you live in but where I’m from, America, that doesn’t happen like some natural instinct.
@MorningGloryxo @O_MARQZ @hongkongsyl @ardecl @Flalom_flalom @IlhanMN You people sound delusional as hell. That “village of help” bs doesn’t form like magic. The people living paycheck to paycheck are going to suffer pretty damn quickly.
@LaRuse7 @firebellys @Skippphipps @IlhanMN He’s lucky they offered him anything for his crackpot wall. If Border Security was that important to him then it would make sense for him to pay the people at the border.
@Jennanne73 @PressSec @chriswallace I can guarantee you that very few government workers view this as a “free vacation.”
@carlbizz @NBCPolitics China is actually the most dominant exporter of Fentanyl.
@PaulHarrop9 @Sooslover9 @GOP @marc_lotter @VP I’m sure those government workers want to work but what’s the point if they’re not getting PAID because the President is a little brat?
@andros2017 @realDonaldTrump Say it louder for the ones in the back.

@spartananger @JesseHapke @Mario_HMendez @SenatorSinema That crackpot wall definitely won’t be part of any deal.

@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal It should be evident that I am clearly referring to only the US in this situation.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal It did, in fact. I think you’re having trouble understanding the few words I typed.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal If only I could teach you how to read on Twitter.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal If that’s how it goes in your imagination.
@Captain54672005 @APCentralRegion @AP There’s actually no evidence that any religious figure was born on Christmas.
@APCentralRegion @AP I love it.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal I’m no artist but I’ll try to do my best if this doesn’t help you understand. https://t.co/I9GDxZmTJd
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal Clearly you’re confused. Would pictures help?
@EyeCatcherEagle @realDonaldTrump @GOP This is easily the funniest thing I’ve read all morning. Thank You.
@realDonaldTrump I could’ve sworn Mexico was going to pay for it. 🤔
@Polite_Jerk @nytimes You people are crazy but your conversations are so damn entertaining.

@marclamonthill I can’t wait for the day America finally stop sending Israel money for nothing.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal I see you have difficulty comprehending simple sentences. Let me break this down again. Southern Command. Sent Agents. To Honduras. To instigate. A Coup. That Coup. Plunged The Country. Into Poverty.
@Workhorse95 @Pablito210 @TheRoot @CBSEveningNews No, that was definitely murder.
@RealSaavedra Well it is his private company.
@DPinklage @DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal In this democracy, yes.
@shane_ramage @RepJayapal Nothing rings freedom like compulsory military service.
@alecphen @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump It’s not like he’s already rich.
@JacobsDad09 @daviddoel If you could read you would know that number only includes the people who have DIED from a lack of healthcare. Not how many people in the US don’t have healthcare.
@jamesdiscourse @thehill It might not represent the entire precinct but it shows that there is reason for concern.
@jamesdiscourse @thehill Maybe you could quote me? Not once did I mention gunning anybody down. We did, however,  give these people an important job and if they think this is appropriate then it definitely raises some concerns.
@jamesdiscourse @thehill Please point out the leap.
@jamesdiscourse @thehill It’s not like these people swore to uphold the law and were then given firearms. Totally nothing to worry about.
RT @rolandscahill: @realDonaldTrump You’re as nervous as a Trump in church
@rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump Can I use this?
@JacobAWohl I don’t think you know what net worth is or how it’s measured.
@MyTongue3 @BillOReilly Because he eased up on the trade war that he started? All this proves is that his tariffs are retarded.
@tonycraigcraig @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders Lmao wat. The planet is going to be okay after a few hundred years but WE are going to be fucked.
@USVeteran2 @RepJayapal @DHSgov @SpoxDHS @WhiteHouse @TuckerCarlson @SenTomCotton @TheJusticeDept 😂Why did you tag Tucker like he’s part of the Federal Gov?
@RepJayapal These comments are pretty hateful. I wonder if they feel this way about all mentally challenged or disabled people.
@DlrWpatriot @RepJayapal Nice story. They’re actually from Honduras and came here because we plunged their country into poverty. Remember the Honduras coup that Southern Command supported?
@realDonaldTrump But you just increased military spending.
@realDonaldTrump Just like how you represented us in France?
@LItalianoVero @realDonaldTrump Have fun with your NAFTA Lite
@LItalianoVero @realDonaldTrump But it’s really NAFTA in disguise.
@MommaMasi You can be a Republican without being a Trump guy. Trump has brought the GOP to new levels of low.
@realDonaldTrump @VP I must be mistaken. Did you just change the title?
@BreitbartNews I love all the pissed off comments here lol
@safesky19 @BreitbartNews He’s a Republican lol
@evilchrisj @thehill “Tim, I thought you were my African American” 😂
@RosenIsRight @marclamonthill We don’t need to be pouring any money into wars for corporate greed or into our bloated military.
@marclamonthill It’s ridiculous how much we pour into Israel
@marclamonthill We really need to stop funding Israel.
@BevH111 @RepMattGaetz Twitter is a private company.
@meridithmcgraw He hired Cohen because of a favor? Is this really the White House right now??
@thehill I thought you weren’t supposed to hire people based purely upon things like this?
@visionnola @USATODAY @usatodayopinion God doesn’t exist.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski Please go do more research.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski There is a difference between personality disorders and mental illnesses. Psychopathy is clearly a mental illness.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski That is extremely contradictory. If you are born with psychopathy then that means it is a mental illness as nobody can be born with personality disorders. Personality disorders result from a person’s environment.
@ElRealColonel @funder So why lie about it?
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski psy·chop·a·thy	/ˌsīˈkäpəTHē/Submit	noun	mental illness or disorder. It’s not that they don’t care, it’s that they have impairments in the temporal and frontal lobes. Striatum gray matter levels also play a part in this.
@FriendRoseanna @CNNPolitics Nice story.
@funder Can’t be true. Remember, Trump has “no dealing with Russia.”
@senrobportman @GM Stop believing that giving these corporations more money will somehow benefit the rest of us.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski Psychopathy, like any other mental illness, is something you are born with. This does not mean it is impossible for psychopaths to become contributing members of society nor does it mean they don’t deserve to be treated humanely. Regarding Anders he fits the sociopath type.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski Nobody is born a serial killer or a terrorist. Rehabilitation is never too late and like in Norway it is actually more beneficial to the country. Maybe you should take a psychology course.
@realDonaldTrump Cohen just admitted to lying to Congress about your “real estate” project in Russia.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski Absolutely. Anybody can be rehabilitated.
@billvikk62794 @AP Try and read a bit more carefully this time.
@Newsweek Are these your “good guys with guns?”
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski If deciding to rehabilitate rather than punish is coddling then I’m all for it.
@TThorsgard @KyleKulinski That low corporate tax rate is fairly recent and oil makes up less than 30-40% of their GDP.
@suzukinathie @KyleKulinski How dare they treat their prisoners humanely.
@angrycdn @Kritterbite @lovroflaughs @NBCNews Regardless, the Obama administration should’ve punished Southern Command.
@angrycdn @Kritterbite @lovroflaughs @NBCNews Obama administration however this was after Obama declared it illegal and I’m assuming the full truth came out in 2016 with this statement. The statement implies Obama knew nothing of their involvement prior to this statement being released. 👉🏿 https://t.co/hmzYGzeHXA
@TerryHoar @SenWarren The ME has been destabilized to an extent where US intervention is a waste and will only make things worse. If the US really wanted to help then they’d stop trying to shove their bloated military into it. We already proved our intentions with the 1949 Syrian Coup.
@TerryHoar @SenWarren No attacks would be better. That belief can only be curbed by leaving them alone. We’ve been interfering in the ME since the 1900s with Russia. More interference under the guise of “help” will only embolden extremist groups.
@TerryHoar @SenWarren If that was true 9/11 wouldn’t have happened considering the proxy wars going on at the time. Keeping troops over there only serves to reinforce their belief that the US is evil.
@realDonaldTrump Almost like propaganda?
@Kritterbite @lovroflaughs @NBCNews Most of them are from Honduras. The country we basically threw into poverty after Southern Command supported the coup.
@BethesdaSupport Sooooo are you going to fix it? At least make it so we don’t have to find that sweet spot for our CAMPs again? Because a lot of the time “floating” isn’t really floating.
@Goebiwonkinobie In such jurisdictions, assault (also called attempted battery) is a threat or physical act that creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, whereas battery is a physical act that results in that harmful or offensive contact.”
@seanhannity We should just let Israel fend for itself.
@Pjrodri33117625 @dianasaurus08 @ARKovnat @realDonaldTrump A dessert lmao.
@Halo9x @FFZilla @JensenThaWriter @NBCLA If the criminals get them from states with relaxed gun laws, where are they going to get them from if ALL states have strict gun laws? We're a major firearm, both legal and illegal, exporter to our Southern neighbors so there goes that. Criminals don't just grow guns.

@FFZilla @Halo9x @JensenThaWriter @NBCLA We need strict national gun laws that states can't modify or override. 👉🏿 https://t.co/7ZxHcORd7r 14,000 guns caught in Illinois and 10,000 of them are from other states. The top 3 source states are all states with very relaxed gun laws.
@ReagansRaptor @NPR This is exactly why we need regulatory agencies like the FDA.

@noneedtoknow216 @isolovethelord @Blklivesmatter Maybe because during those 4 years Republicans blamed him nonstop for the unemployment rate being so high. He actually did fix it, he's the reason we're out of a recession. Trump has literally blamed Obama countless times to make himself look good.
@noneedtoknow216 @isolovethelord @Blklivesmatter It's actually a proven fact that Obama inherited a failing economy. https://t.co/9NDjCE7VHH
@NoLimitNiga @rihanna Assuming she's talking about race? Nice.
@noneedtoknow216 @isolovethelord @Blklivesmatter 🙄 They are highest today because of the work of previous administrations. Trump and his cabinet are not responsible. Our success is obviously more important but so is the truth.
@noneedtoknow216 @isolovethelord @Blklivesmatter Black* Support* 🤦🏿‍♂️ Twitter needs an edit button.
