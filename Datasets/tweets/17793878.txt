President Trump's @EPA seems to think its new #DirtyWaterRule would have positive effects on our environment. We corrected their charts for them. #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/qCtZBLLY6s https://t.co/4d2Q5wZin2
Apparently Trump’s vision is to first put 800,000 people out of work, allow our nation’s National Parks and other public lands get trashed, only to call gov’t employees back to work to help out oil &amp; gas and other destructive industries. That won’t make America great again.
And @boem_doi employees are being tasked with approving seismic blasting permits on the Atlantic, a precursor to offshore drilling.
They are also working on preparing the National Outer Continental Shelf Program which could open up virtually all of America's coastlines to offshore drilling.
Nor are there any signs that Trump’s top priority of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will be slowed due to the #TrumpShutdown. The Feb. 11 deadline to comment remains unchanged https://t.co/p26v9UJX05
Interior is also pressing ahead with preparing America’s Arctic for more oil and gas drilling in areas such as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. https://t.co/f6oUl8jN3H
The administration is also calling back furloughed @BOEM_DOI personnel to prepare documents for auctioning new areas of Gulf of Mexico for oil &amp; gas leasing. https://t.co/iI9I36epb4

.@DOIDepSec Bernhardt and his team kept national parks open with almost no staff, despite damage to iconic parks like Joshua Tree.
And at the same time, the Senate is considering the nomination of a former coal lobbyist to head @EPA, even as tens of thousands of EPA employees remain furloughed.
And as our courts feel the impact of the #TrumpShutdown, it will be harder for everyday Americans to fight the administration’s misdeeds using the power of the law.
Time and time again, Trump’s administration has demanded employees report without pay to keep the favors coming for big oil and gas companies.
The @forestservice is even exploring more auctions to sell off our public lands &amp; resources if the government remains closed.
Even while officially shuttered, @forestservice is giving loggers free reign to cut trees and exacerbate the worst effects of climate change, implementing @realDonaldTrump’s executive order that would result in a 31% increase in logging since 2017.
.@APIenergy’s CEO says they “have not seen any major effects of the #TrumpShutdown on our industry.” If only families &amp; communities on the front lines of climate change could say the same.
.@BLMNational is still accepting permits to drill on #PublicLands in total disregard of health and safety.

Every year, #Montana spends more than $2 mil to fend off the acid mine drainage from the old Zortman-Landusky mine. It will have to do that every year from here on out. The state has already paid $32 mil.
What kind of pollution leaks from these old mines? In three words: acid mine drainage. Toxic metals leaking from mines can turn mountain streams so acidic the waters no longer support life. https://t.co/RP9KIA7Uqx
When Pegasus went belly up and its execs left with the gold, taxpayers were left footing the bill. Cleaning up the Zortman-Landusky mine in big sky country has already cost a jaw-dropping $74 million. #HeckNoHecla
The #BadActorLaw ensures mining execs whose companies walk out on their cleanup obligations don’t get to profit from new mines until they clean up after themselves. Montana has said Hecla can’t open their mines because of its CEO’s history. #HeckNoHecla
Hecla’s CEO has a history of running companies whose mines pollute the mountains and streams of the American West. His former company, Pegasus Gold Inc, is a poster child for why Montana has the Bad Actor Law.
Hecla Mining Co. wants to mine Montana’s Cabinet Mountains Wilderness, home to one of the last grizzly populations and some of the cleanest waters of the lower 48. Risky doesn’t begin to describe the threats mining would bring to this special place. #HeckNoHecla https://t.co/iIVp4Fujzs

@EarthjusticeDC @RepJimMcGovern Thank you for calling out the anti-environmental provisions in the House #farmbill that “reduce access to clean water and undermine critical conservation” We agree it is frustrating and shameful.
@EarthjusticeDC @RepTimWalz Thank you for acknowledging that “conservation benefits all of us”. That’s why the #farmbill must be stripped of anti-environment riders, and increase funding for conservation.
@EarthjusticeDC @SenStabenow thank you for calling for the #FarmBill to avoid poison pill riders so we do not go backwards on protections for our lands, our forests, or our wildlife.
