@AlanBalutis It was really fun except when I thought the dog was going to run away into the snow that was not cold or wet. But then he didn’t. And we went into the our house that wasn’t ours and there wasn’t enough storage for the meat slicer and other weird appliance we don’t own.
Last night I dreamt we were vacationing in China &amp; our school-bus/tourbus drove over the sand at a sunny beach turning to a dark shore full of snow that wasn’t cold or wet.

@amsdkc Agreed that “branding” as a technique over-simplifies the issues. But it shines a lens to view tribalism. Like, if we both want safe water, why argue about teams?
@JerseyTigerFan @matthewjdowd Yeah. That’s a charged phrase that goes down a slippery slope fast. ☹️Yet the numbers of people who agree on limits re firearms, protecting the environment, even allowing former felons to vote(!!) says there are things we can work on. And red &amp; blue jerseys are not helping.
@arbit50 @matthewjdowd I think we agree. 😀
@weprotect_truth @matthewjdowd Yes. And baby killlers and rapist lovers. I get the propaganda machine. But I talk to my kids who see this false bifurcation. If we agree on environment but not on reproductive rights, can we work on environment together and I’ll find others to work on access to healthcare?
@rebeccarauber @matthewjdowd I agree with you re Rs. The point I’m taking is that this party thing isn’t solving problems that we agree need to be solved. Party brands are a barrier.
