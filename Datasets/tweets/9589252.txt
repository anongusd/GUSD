This ruling could limit civil forfeiture, which basically allows police to seize someone’s property without proof that they are guilty of a crime; this means, cars, cash, and more. Local and state departments can then absorb the value of this property.	📸: @ACLU https://t.co/5lMh1ffqiH
Because the Land Rover was valued at 4x more than the $10,000 maximum fine that Timbs would have had to pay, he argued that it was an excessive fine and violated the 8th Amendment. The legal question became, “does the 8th Amendment apply to States?”	SCOTUS said yes, it does! https://t.co/vHd8OwwKUO

In short - The federal government is stockpiling innocent children who could be released to family, and traumatizing at the tax payer’s expense. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FreeTheChildren
“The huge increases, which have placed the federal shelter system near capacity, are due not to an influx of children entering the country, but a reduction in the number being released to live with families and other sponsors.”

I join millions of people across the United States and the world in mourning the passing of Senator John McCain. https://t.co/HU3SOeKGXR
My prayers go out to his family tonight and may they know that a nation and a world remain grateful for his eternal leadership. May our leaders take note of his courage and follow his example of country above party. - @MariaTeresa1  President &amp; CEO of Voto Latino
Senator McCain helped move the immigration issue forward in a bipartisan way and I will never forget his vocal and outspoken courage and leadership. I had the opportunity to meet the Senator, and he was always a straight shooter.
A war hero and patriot, he fought for our country’s ideals. As a leader, Senator McCain was an early supporter of comprehensive immigration reform because he knew  a modernized immigration system was not only a requirement, but that immigrants deserved decent, humane treatment.
