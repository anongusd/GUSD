@VOC_ORG I watched the video that you were comparing a true death to a living death. You‚Äôre not factoring in abuse and false allegations. This is a man who lost his mother in a tragic event not a child that has been a victim to horrible abuse and sent to live with the abuser. Not equal

So I have strongly worded a responding email stating all the violations in the subpoena. Why you say? Because incompetence from an attorney like this can cost someone their life. DO NOT ALLOW HALF ASS REPRESENTATION!   #victims #justice #domesticviolenceawareness https://t.co/uthYSluwEf
Again I ask you to always remember no one cares as much about your safety or child‚Äôs as much as you. So do DV victims really get representation they deserve?  The answer is a solid NO!!! Victim &amp; 4month old child unaware that this is the pathway leading to 18yrs of Hell!
This is the Victim‚Äôs attorney sending an email attachment Subpoena that is not legal and in addition fails to comply with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure!    Last week I got a text from ‚Äúvictim‚Äù upset because attorney was not aware of correct up coming court date.
Victim states my email was given to attorney to be a witness at a restraining order hearing 3hours away from my home in now less than 3 days. Victim states ‚Äúto tired to talk about it now‚Äù but then sends a text saying I will be held in contempt if I don‚Äôt show up. WRONG!!!!!
I open my email for other reasons than what I found. I found an attached subpoena lost among the piles of junk mail sent late Friday from an email address I did not recognize. I quickly call the person who offered up my name to find out what was going on.
Let‚Äôs discuss why I made the statement before this one about no one cares about your case more than you. You may have hired an attorney or have one from legal aid. What you don‚Äôt know or trust they are doing will be your downfall. Accountability in your own legal team is a must!
Who cares about your safety truly?  Repeat these words....... No one cares about my safety or my child‚Äôs more than me. https://t.co/6bBHuBJ3jC

@entelyse Buy computers and pay teachers to be combat ready!  Confused?
@bookgirl8 Pay the teachers 1st. Educate them on all the gun safety regulations, insure them because you know there will be a lawsuit then we can talk about the use of guns in schools. Hell the school policeman didn‚Äôt even want to go in last time! You think Mrs Jones is ready to pack heat?
@MissionaryBLMM So you think teachers will have the guns in purses? They have guns in Texas school locked up and even the students/parents don‚Äôt have knowledge of the gun in the first place. School outside of Dallas.

@Political_Jimbo How about computers instead of books and more pay for teachers. Must not have rhymed enough for them.

@MomsRising It‚Äôs ridiculous!  At this point we should just turn all schools into military schools. I can‚Äôt think of one teacher growing up I trusted with a gun!  The liability alone is huge.
@RepRaulGrijalva @HouseDemocrats Well your smart point is ridicules it‚Äôs always open season on children. It‚Äôs the American way!

Reunify with abuser in 3 weeks or go to mental home. Teen that had a protective order for 3 years.
The next step to get the social outcry needed in Family Courts for protection of children is to put a wall, fence and show the police escorting children to their abusers severing ties to the parent that is trying to protect them.
