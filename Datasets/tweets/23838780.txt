@cindycreem Completely agree with you on this. Thank you for taking a stand for our state
It is just so frustrating. All this money BP is spending on PR could be used to settle claims and manage volunteers #in
Not only is that an OSHA violation not all hires are local workers. Sources told us AL state beaches managed by Canadian contracted crew #in
The BP commercial that says the #OilSpill cleanup crews are out 24/7 is misleading. We did not see crews consistently at impacted sites #in
@miracleNprogres You must be so excited! Congrats

The #OilSpill is not a partisan attack point. We need relief not rhetoric.
Pensacola had oil but now is close to clean they were at yellow flag. This is a photo from today http://twitpic.com/20lv3t

Progressive is about proving it. You have to be willing to mean what you say and fulfill what you commit to.
Words of wisdom: Maintain your originality, integrity, and dignity. Don't co-op someone else's ideals and claim them as your own.
You can't call something radical and defend the status quo in one breath, and in the next portray yourself as a reformer. We see through it.

Watching Taboo on National Geographic.
Saw the International Space Station tonight. It's up by the Big Dipper if anyone is interested.
So much to prepare for, so little time.  Great progress before the announcement but looks like it will be a working Saturday.
Cannot believe someone stole the Obama magnet off the car. That's not the change I believe in.

@cascadingwaters Shout out to Tracy Novick for the balloons at the fireworks. Great way to show with her Worcester can go higher
Had an amazing time at the fireworks. Now some last minute e-mails. Work in the morning. Anyone up for Purgatory this Saturday?
We got here late and it is crazy packed. We are located up by the yellow truck at the fireworks.
Headed over to the fireworks. Everyone stop by and get a baloon from Tracy Novick
Fireworks tonight! FYI there will be free balloons so grab one.
Went with Plan B last night. In RI and the fireworks tonight.
Plan A: Burnouts. Plan B: Transformers.
I just realized that in 16 days I am going to be outside of the US for the first time & on another continent. Reality is finally setting in.

Always Tweet Responsibly
Happy Independence day! Celebrate freedom and the ideals of the Revolution.
Glad to have my weekly dose of BOBOisms, even during the summer time
@GraceCRoss Unfortunately elections these days focus too much on comparisons rather than on issues.
I love how everyone is up on Sotomayor for having an opinion. Isn't the reason why we have a Supreme Court so justices' can issue OPINIONS?
Worcester Fireworks have been postponed until Sunday July 5th. See you all then
@cascadingwaters Thanks for the update
@DSteele424 Even my friends are asking me when the fireworks are
FYI The Worcester Fireworks were postponed until July 3rd.
Is at a crossroads. Is it ironic or symbolic that I crossed paths with the same train 3 times in the last hour?
@usedgov IBR is a great start but that should be expanded to make education free for everyone. Hope this is the direction Obama is moving
everyone who has been complaining about the weather; can you say global warming?
@lfaulk0328 That should be easy in that town. Hope you are enjoying the West Coast!
20 days until China
Transformers 2 was an amazing movie. It was extremely long but the fact that Meaghan Fox was in the film made the three hours worth it.
Celebrating my 1 year by looking for a new job. Going to miss that place.

My flight just got cancelled- Now I have to re-arrange everything with the airline. Fun night
