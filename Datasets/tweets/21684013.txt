The Coast Guard prevents more illicit drugs from entering our country than all other agencies at our land borders. 		Pres. Trump--not paying the Coast Guard for their work while manufacturing a crisis at the border is wrong. They're doing their job and you need to do yours.

One month into the #TrumpShutdown:	 	-Members of the Coast Guard aren't being paid.	-Thousands of Federal workers are furloughed.	-Dozens of critical @NTSB investigations are halted.	 	This is the reality of the #TrumpShutdown one month in.
We, too, find it unacceptable that members of our Coast Guard have to rely on food pantries and donations because the #TrumpShutdown is stopping them from getting paid. 	 	The real life implications of the President’s actions are affecting many, including members of our military. https://t.co/VtWSER5jyB

Amount of pay received during the #TrumpShutdown:	 	Members of the Coast Guard: $0	Air Traffic Controllers: $0	Air Safety Inspectors: $0	The list goes on,  but the number stays the same.	 	Thousands of Federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay. #EndTheShutdown
While the President is fixated on building a border wall to “make Americans safer,” the #TrumpShutdown is stopping the people who protect our coastal borders from getting paid. The President needs to open the Government and put the well-being of Americans first.
As the President spoke about taking money designated for disaster recovery from the Army Corps of Engineers, Chairman @RepPeterDeFazio, @NitaLowey, @GraceNapolitano, and @RepMarcyKaptur sent him a letter challenging his authority to use Corps funding to build the border wall. https://t.co/GURckpNNB6
92,620.	 	That's the number of members of the U.S. Coast Guard, employees of FEMA and the Department of Transportation including air traffic controllers, air safety inspectors, and more that are either furloughed or working without pay because of the #TrumpShutdown.
Earlier this week, we learned that the EPA’s criminal action against polluters hit a 30-year low.	 	Now, because of the #TrumpShutdown, the already low number of investigations has reduced to 0.	 	It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to end the shutdown and protect our environment.
The @NTSB is responsible for investigating accidents in the air, on land, and in water, but because of the #TrumpShutdown all investigations have stopped. As of Thursday, there were 14 accidents that caused 25 deaths and none have been investigated. #EndTheShutdownNow
Members of the Coast Guard are missing pay &amp; if the #TrumpShutdown continues, 50,000 Coast Guard retirees who honorably served our country &amp; rely on their pension checks, won't receive them.	 	Members of our military should not be used as pawns in the President's political games. https://t.co/TZn7Q6ZT7E

Today, @RepPeterDeFazio, @NitaLowey, @GraceNapolitano, &amp; @RepMarcyKaptur sent a letter to the President. They made it clear that they don’t believe he has the authority to take money from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fund his border wall: https://t.co/osG1leMoZV https://t.co/OpFaVG7QEi
Less than 3 months ago, the DOJ told then Ranking Member DeFazio that their department “continues to vigorously enforce the nation’s environmental laws.”		Now, we know that couldn’t be further from the truth. 		The EPA’s criminal action against polluters just hit a 30-year low. https://t.co/NvJR6UpNYa
It is now day 26 of the #TrumpShutdown. How long will the President let this go on for? https://t.co/bx2VFQH8Kj
Today @RepPeterDeFazio met with the CEO of @nscorp to discuss ways to make highway-rail grade crossings safer and address infrastructure needs along the Northeast Corridor. https://t.co/zvXPcCShQg
Now on day 25, the #TrumpShutdown is preventing members of our Coast Guard from receiving their paychecks. In addition to working 24/7 to keep us safe, they are now being forced to consider getting second jobs or selling their possessions because they received $0 today. https://t.co/wA2UBCWj25
Today, Coast Guard members would have been paid if it weren’t for the #TrumpShutdown. 		What happened instead? They received $0. https://t.co/dWDWxjE1Ps
The #TrumpShutdown has gone on way too long. #Day25 https://t.co/mPLlbUEHsU
RT @SCourtneyDC: ICYMI last week we posted my convo with @RepPeterDeFazio about his plans for @TransportDems https://t.co/SIDDXYepv0
Pres. Trump’s shutdown has now reached day 24. Across the country, Federal employees are feeling the effects of the longest Government shutdown in history… including air traffic controllers and members of our Coast Guard who are working without pay. #EndTheShutdownNow
Between all of these agencies that work to keep our country safe every day, 92,620 people are either furloughed or working without pay. 		The number is big, but the real life impact is even greater. It’s time for Pres. Trump to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/y9y3Izp3QN
7️⃣Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration: 285 positions furloughed.		8️⃣Surface Transportation Board: 111 out of 113 positions furloughed.
4️⃣Federal Transit Administration: 493 positions furloughed + no pay for contractors.		5️⃣Federal Railroad Administration: 408 positions furloughed.		6️⃣National Transportation Safety Board: 376 out of 401 position furloughed.
1️⃣U.S. Coast Guard: 56,060 members of the Coast Guard working w/o pay.		2️⃣Federal Aviation Administration: 17,791 positions furloughed + 14,000 controllers working w/o pay.		3️⃣FEMA: 3,096 positions furloughed + no FEMA public assistance and no FEMA grants.
It is now day 21 of the #TrumpShutdown. All across the country, Federal employees and agencies are feeling the effects of Pres. Trump’s manufactured crisis. Because the facts matter, we put together this thread that outlines the real life impacts of Trump’s political games: ⬇️

The @NTSB’s mission is to promote safety in transportation, but because of the #TrumpShutdown they haven’t been able to investigate crashes in which over 20 people have died. @realDonaldTrump’s shutdown is making us less safe, not the other way around. https://t.co/wCxFzvKDHd
Today, air traffic controllers received pay stubs with a net pay of zero dollars. The crisis isn’t at the border, it’s the one @realDonaldTrump has created here at home.
Here is an example of the paycheck air traffic controllers received today because of the #TrumpShutdown. 		Yes, you’re reading that correctly… they were paid ZERO dollars. https://t.co/7BSote0iam
Nearly 40 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) employees are furloughed, preventing the agency from fulfilling its critical mandate to provide a safe and efficient aviation system.
.@realDonaldTrump must concede that the border wall is the not the crisis; he has merely manufactured one by shutting down the Government. #StopTheShutdown
It has been 20 days since the #TrumpShutdown began. That’s 20 days too long. We must reopen the Government to stop these unnecessary aviation vulnerabilities and disruptions as soon as possible. #StopTheShutdown https://t.co/CjmpsrRY5Y
66% of Coast Guard members have three months or less worth of savings. We introduced the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act to make sure that members of the Coast Guard get paid despite @realDonaldTrump’s threat to keep the government shut down.
It is unacceptable that members of our military were told to hold a garage sale or work as a baby sitter in order to get through the #TrumpShutdown. Our dedicated service members should not have to resort to this in order to survive @realDonaldTrump’s manufactured crisis. https://t.co/axzKzbVmFR
31% of our active duty Coast Guard members don’t have enough savings to cover one month’s worth of bills, but they’ve been working for 19 days without pay. We just introduced the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act because if @realDonaldTrump won’t make sure they're paid, we will. https://t.co/yyB1yv1QRC
Last night, @realDonaldTrump claimed that his wall is needed to keep drugs out of our country. Can someone tell him that the Coast Guard intercepts more illicit drugs than all other agencies at the land borders of the U.S. AND that they were doing it yesterday without pay?

.@RealDonaldTrump says that he could continue the #TrumpShutdown for months or even years if he doesn’t get what he wants. Meanwhile, over 41,000 members of our Coast Guard don’t know when they’ll receive their next paycheck. https://t.co/qyvx0lyhFv

June 1st was the first day of the 2018 hurricane season. FEMA remains unprepared, and recovery efforts from 2017 continue. #FEMA must implement reforms to improve disaster recovery and readiness, and it is imperative that Congress provides the necessary support and oversight.
Almost a year later, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still facing the uphill road to recovery. Approximately 60,000 homes in PR still have temporary roofs which are designed to last no more than two months.
#FEMA’s recently released “2017 Hurricane Season After-Action Report” shows that the agency was completely unprepared for the 2017 disaster season, which included devastating hurricanes and historic wildfires.
