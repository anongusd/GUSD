@dirtylil_sexret I sincerely hope it all works out for you. If I were in your shoes, I would ask to have a private meeting with HR &amp; ask if something else will open up between now &amp; your end date in February. Express the interest in staying now rather than later.
@dirtylil_sexret Supervisors &amp; managers will lie through their teeth to get ahead at a company. They don't want anyone to think they do, but they do. They blurt shit out like that so you think they're not interested.
@dirtylil_sexret So you can get your supervisor was "in the loop" on this reorganization &amp; threatened to leave, then they found her a spot.
@dirtylil_sexret Sadly, this all is legal. They can use the excuse "it's all based on performance and attitude, attendance" etc. They don't have to explain their reasons. We all know it's all about the almighty dollar.
@dirtylil_sexret If they extended your dates, you're doing something right. Maybe this will give them time, since the new year just started, to find you other positions within.
@dirtylil_sexret So they close the dept, 30 ppl try to get the few jobs they offer in other departments &amp; rather than give it to a perm employee at a higher rate of pay, they hire the temps permanently at a lower rate of pay.
@dirtylil_sexret Temp workers will always try their best to outshine permanent employees in the hopes they will be hired permanently.
@dirtylil_sexret Wow hun,  that's really really awful.
