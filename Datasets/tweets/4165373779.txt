@rmcameron89 @TheFFBallers Yea true, week 1 sucks.. Looks like Baldwin has an MCL tear though, don't think he'll be back anytime soon.
@rmcameron89 @TheFFBallers Pick up Brandon Marshall and hope they use him more
@TheFFBallers Not quite a shocking performance but Brandon Marshall played really well on a limited number of targets. Still one of the best in the league IMO, and always had potential to be so much more with the right opportunity. I could see him doing really well with DangeRuss.. #underrated

When will Americans realize they've been locked in a continuous cycle of manipulation and distraction? Everyone wants to "lock" everyone else "up". In reality the RNC, DNC, and the media are destroying our country. Enjoy it while it lasts people. #idiocracy #RNC #DNC #media
@MattVerderame I get what you're saying but, FACTS should be left in no matter what ppl perceive of them. If that's what happened, then it should be stated. Leaving facts out, bc you think ppl may perceive them a certain way is called spinning a story. If it makes him look guilty, then so be it
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest On that note; I've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation, X. Take care.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Youre no match for me 'chess-master', because I am simply reflecting the reality of nature, while you're trying to bend it to your will. You lost the moment you started seething. I contain all forces within me, and thus examine them objectively.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest You can't fight nature my simple friend. Your energy will always be opposed and matched equally. You will never win your battle, but go ahead and keep running on that wheel.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest And what logic did you use to come to these conclusions? Your words just float on the surface with nothing tying them to reality. And what would happen if all conservatives decided to be liberals?
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Ever wondered why you aren't taken seriously? Its because your words no matter how big, are not used correctly and have no actual logic behind them. Hyperbole is not reality, but rather a last resort defense when you know you've lost.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Yes you've used increasingly big words in proportion with your insecurity, and I have used simple words to explain concepts to a simple person.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest The first step to your free will is to humble yourself my friend. I hope you take something away from this.
The 2party system puts all the power in the hands of billionaires and the politicians they corrupt through the conduit of the DNC and RNC. What if your rep had no affiliation, that is to say, no corruption? Would your voice then be heard?
The 2party system allows billionaires to unite under a common organization that can influence laws. Does it make sense in our exponentially diverse world for a relative few to make all the decisions? I would say it‚Äôs downright irresponsible. #Independence
What if solvable issues in gov weren't stalled because two parties have impossible stipulations to adhere to. What if each rep served his local constituents and not half the country?
@kanyewest is challenging us to break out of the viscous cycle of the 2-party system which has corrupted our gov. These parties are not part of our gov, yet they've wrested control of it. Where have they gotten us except eternally divided. #Independence
What if special interests were just the people in your community?
What if there was a world in which you could vote for a candidate with no affiliation other than that of the constituency he/she serves. Instead we live in a world where he/she serves an organization funded by billionaires who think they're smarter than you. #Independence
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Comprehend this - you are a worker ant, acting on impulse and boasting in place of a logical argument when you sense that you cannot win. This is not free will, you are not a thinker. Thinkers have free will. It's ok though, we need worker ants.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Are you still thinking about how refute my original premise? Take as much time as you need.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest And yet you respond like a child would, acting on impulse, boasting and making claims you have no way of proving. Your fear, immaturity and ignorance are on full display, you've learned nothing.
@AmericanNewsX @SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest That‚Äôs a stretch but I suppose its true to you. Although your fear is on display for all to see. Instead of thinking you just react with insult to something that you cannot comprehend or refute.
@SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest You don‚Äôt realize it but you‚Äôre proving my point. Truth is paradoxical
@SayBiblePodcast @molauren29 @kanyewest Youre missing the point. His view at a high level is that truth is subjective and the only way to be heard is to listen first. And that neither party can be trusted, we have to do it without them and move on from the prison of the party system. This is my interperetation..
@kanyewest You should really read Nietzsche 'beyond good &amp; evil', Kanye (if you havent).
@kanyewest You guys dont get it. Kanye's about 100 steps ahead of the game. hes figured out that niether party can be trusted, and that one has to listen first if you want to be heard. Hes setting an example and already has the ear of the right. Or just keep wasting your energy #independent
