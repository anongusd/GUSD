@BreeVandy @realDonaldTrump Hey Bree. I thought I heard that President Trump has not officially signed the National Emergency Order. He had the big press conference &amp; made the announcement. But he did not actually sign the order (yet). Cannot remember where I heard that.
@BreeVandy Is it true that @realDonaldTrump announced he would sign an EO but never did? Seems like he has the objectors spinning. Meanwhile, sections of the wall are being built with older $.
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, Good afternoon. Can you please instruct the EPA to get rid of wasteful/ineffective regulations? Shutting down coal-fired power plants is an Obama admin policy. Should never be a Trump admin policy. Thank you. #MAGA2020 https://t.co/SroYUqqsor

@ewarren Minimum wage jobs were always meant to provide a starting point. They were never meant to be someone's final destination. Dare to dream a little higher Senator.
@LarrySchweikart Good morning Larry. If Congress appropriates $ for DHS &amp; "directs" them to do this &amp; that, does DHS have to listen? Does the National Emergency supersede their directives? Like reverse Sanctuary City policies, but DHS would just enforce existing laws. True?
@WyKodie @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has done a tremendous amount of good in the past 2 years. Did you hear @marcorubio publicly disagreeing w/ national emergency? Same R's that did nothing for years. Who would have not voted yes if the President signaled he would veto it? 60 of them? Not a chance!
@WyKodie @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Over the past 2 years, @realDonaldTrump has been fighting Dems, Never-Trumpers, MSM &amp; the establishment. They tried to take him out via Fusion GPS &amp; Russia. The establishment still does like him &amp; wants him gone. They are not going to give him a win, or any wins approaching 2020.
@WyKodie @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Cannot agree. He was given a lousy bill &amp; pressured to avoid another shutdown. I blame the lead negotiators more. There are more open border, immigration free-for-all people in both parties. Dems control the House. Paul Ryan's house was equally unwilling. &amp; Senate needs 60.
@WyKodie @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump was handed a veto proof bill. Even if he vetoed it, both Senate &amp; House had enough votes to override it. Problem is the #DoNothingCongress &amp; #DoNothingSenate. They are great at kicking the can down the road. They are not great at solving problems.
@ChrisCPandolfo @realDonaldTrump was handed a veto proof bill. Too many Senators &amp; House of Representatives voted in favor.
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, Thank you. My family &amp; friends stand with you. We know it is the #DoNothingCongress &amp; #DoNothingSenate.

@GlennKesslerWP The law literally moves the death of an unborn baby from the criminal code to the health code. And if the baby survives, the law takes away the ability to give life-saving care. Even after the botched abortion, the baby is left to die anyway. Abortion up until birth = Shameful.

@SharylAttkisson Unlike an abortion, that ends a baby's life in the womb, infanticide speaks to the baby being born then killed. I guess it should be called homocide. A person's life is terminated by someone else. Post-term abortion is not specific enough. Need to ditch their terminology.

@GOP @SenatorLankford said he wants to change the Senate rules. Will YOU let him, @SenateMajLdr?!!?!? YOU control the Senate, act like it.
@RexTilllerson Yeah but do you realize that Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein would fill the slot? @POTUS has to select &amp; Senate needs to confirm. Too many months.
@POTUS compromised McCabe from leading the HRC investigations. Rod Rosenstein IS horrible. Rod Rosenstein would NOT be a good interim AG. Please!!!
@POTUS I am honestly praying that u &amp; AG Sessions reconcile quickly. &amp; that he makes amends by putting boundaries around Mueller +  removing...
@POTUS &amp; my skin crawls thinking about Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein being next in line, until u nominate &amp; the feckless Senate confirms his replacement
@POTUS Dear President Trump, Please do not fire AG Sessions. I am one your biggest supporters &amp; defenders. He is a lot of great work...
@JaySekulow @JordanSekulow @POTUS Who can step in to enforce? Mueller's involvement with Secretary of State Clinton &amp; Russian Uranium Deal?? https://t.co/rZclBLD0w1
@joshdcaplan @POTUS Good morning Josh. Can you find full video link? I would like to send it to friends. Thank you. @POTUS #MAGA
@NoahCRothman During Obama admin, Senators, President Obama &amp; cabinet met w/ same ppl. Guess it's all good when u are a Democrat. https://t.co/QNQlOJ32uE
@SenatorBurr @SenatorWarner @SenatorRubio @SenatorCollins @RoyBlunt @SenatorLankford @SenatorCotton @TeamCornyn Where was your outrage then? https://t.co/ln1Cf98Au9
@JudicialWatch @nytimes Scandal #2: @POTUS fired @PreetBharara (US Attorney in NY) after he refused 2 resign. Mueller hired him 2 investigate Trump campaign/ admin.
@RealJamesWoods Praying for his replacement every day... #MAGA @GOP
@stranahan @pbump @washingtonpost Why isn't there a Congressional investigation? Where is AG Sessions, after all he did not recuse himself from Ukraine matters??? @POTUS
@marklevinshow Isn't it AG Sessions job to find and fire/prosecute leakers in the intelligence agencies? Why is he being so hands off?
@JordanSekulow @FoxBusiness Please, please tell us @POTUS's legal team has something great under their legal sleeves.
@TheMarkRomano ten steps ahead communications team. If Scaramucci can bring that, it would be a YUGE improvement. #MAGA @POTUS
@TheMarkRomano As a Trump supporter, it has been frustrating to watch the MSM/deep state reign and rule. Trump needs the strongest, most proactive,
@BernardKerik @Scaramucci @POTUS also needs to hire u, Ray Kelly &amp; Rudy Giuliani ASAP to bring all of the media created/deep state chaos under control. Law &amp; Order!!!
@accidntlmystic @Brenda_424 @voymasa @SenMikeLee YES, b/c it is ALL GOOD when u have a D next to your name!!! What awesome democrat state do YOU live in? #MAGAnomics https://t.co/Wbm2dQJwTr
@SteveDeaceShow Yet another voice of why Mueller must be fired. Ben Stein ain't no dummy...neither are @marklevinshow @JaySekulow, et al. https://t.co/Smg08uasbA
@SteveDeaceShow @toddhathorne @JudicialWatch, @marklevinshow, @JaySekulow say b/c Comey illegally leaked 2 trigger hiring Mueller who is now outside Russian '16 election.
@Thomas1774Paine Since Mueller expanded investigation beyond Russian 2016 election meddling, AG Sessions should un-recuse himself and take action. @POTUS
@FoxBusiness Those 22M include people that the government cannot FORCE to buy lousy, unaffordable insurance. #freemarket #MAGA #ConsumerChoiceAct
@JaySekulow Can you discuss this new twist in the Mueller fiasco?https://t.co/9QL5rccVgq
@RMConservative For years in NYC, high quality doctors have refused to take insurance. They run a cash based business. Their schedules r booked for months.
@BrentBozell Jobs. In NJ they tried to get rid of mandatory full-service gas stations. It was voted down by the politicians. B/c people would lose jobs.
@accidntlmystic @voymasa @Brenda_424 @SenMikeLee And NY, CA and Illinois are fiscally solvent? I lived in NYC most of my life. Liberal utopia, not! Where do u live? https://t.co/FkYe9PXv3b
@mrs_pinky85 But depending on the state, on-line curriculum is most likely state sanctioned content. No flexibility + No choices = No state objections.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Senator Rand Paul for the new Senate Majority Leader!!! Vote now on both. @GOP @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Dear @SenateMajLdr, can't U do anything? What is the point of being Majority Leader if the Minority party runs the show? Time 4 rules change
@FreeBeacon https://t.co/pQO700raid
@Acosta You mean the Obama DOJ was caught red handed? https://t.co/lqHOYI3kTJ
@BEAYAHUS @foxandfriends Or because of his tweets.
@RandPaul We all got duped into thinking paying high monthly premium 2 an insurance company = h/care? Buys you permission 2 go to a Doc on their list?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS No choice. Change the Senate rules. Democrat manipulations are no excuse. Will you derail @POTUS &amp; the #MAGA agenda? Need to go on offense.
@KristinnFR Imagine if the left was this passionate about saving baby humans from being aborted? #ProLife
@planoldtired @SecPriceMD Rather pay a Doctor than middle men = "health insurance" companies. Doctors go to school &amp; can help. Insurance only gets U in their door.
@SenateMajLdr YOU are the leader of the Senate. Time to put @POTUS ahead of your own Senate partnerships and agenda. Time to change rules. https://t.co/lV6d715v8z
@TreyYingst Can he shut down or put a time limit &amp; constraints on Robert Mueller's team?
@FoxBusiness Agreed but still voting for @MooreSenate in the August 15th primary.
@TeamMoore Good afternoon. Does Judge Moore plan on visiting/holding a campaign rally in Lee County, AL?
@IngrahamAngle Meanwhile, @FLOTUS sat next to Putin during dinner. Charm offensive perhaps?
@mrs_pinky85 de Blasio craves the limelight of the world stage. He is a legend in his own mind.
@mitchellreports @RepAdamSchiff @MSNBC Like when President Obama let Russia take Crimea from a NATO ally? https://t.co/QZV92oUQZr
@TIME @Mediaite @thedailybeast @HuffPostCanada @IBTimes @CillizzaCNN OHMYGODOHMYGOD you fail yet again. Wishful reporting. #FakeNews  #MAGA https://t.co/dWtrrRfLeB
@Acosta Consensus amongst 17, I mean 4, intelligence agencies? So, the US Coast Guard did not agree w/ the other agencies? They must be in on it 2.
@CNN As a NYer, sadly reminds of me of how survivors of September 11th actually looked like. Tasteless &amp; clueless bunch. Socialism does not work!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, Can you please review &amp; pardon the remaining Leavenworth 10? Thank U. https://t.co/CZ9pOs2mB8
@chucktodd How about this gem? https://t.co/xlcp9ns9nW
@chucktodd Can u justify journalists, pundits &amp; actors/actresses behavior/speech over the past 8 months? They disrespect the office of the President.
@RealJamesWoods Loved True Believer. Owned video &amp; played it lots. U are one of my all time favorite actors. &amp; yes, it helps that u are a conservative. :)
@JoeNBC @morningmika Any comments? Amazing you are both paid to spew hate and nonsense day-in-day out. Dribble. https://t.co/ibDMf59MYI
@josephcurl And the House passed Kate's Law &amp; No Sanctuary For Criminals Act.
@ChrisCuomo @clarissaward @NewDay No bias &amp; reprehensible talk in MSM? Guess in private it is all good. @JamesOKeefeIII take the mic... https://t.co/9uKYoh2Te1
@IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @POTUS Yes, please let @JamesOKeefeIII &amp; new media take on MSM. Focus on ur #MAGA agenda = make them re-focus based on low viewership/poor ratings.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump U can only go low when u have a D next to you name. Smashing windows, hitting ppl w/ bike locks (antifa), death threats = Dem free speech.
@RadicalGoats @JRubinBlogger @RandPaul @JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump do not even accept insurance. They run a cash based business. Even lasik surgery was not accepted by insurance and the price came way down.
@RadicalGoats @JRubinBlogger @RandPaul @JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Government is NOT the best solution to all problems. Look at the VA. Medicaid always needs more $$$. Waste &amp; fraud. In NYC, best Doctors...
@JRubinBlogger @RandPaul @JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Jennifer, have you ever negotiated anything? Clearly not. Thank you @RandPaul for pushing to make h/c better with free markets solutions.
@DavidCornDC @KellyannePolls @JamesOKeefeIII Did you defend President Bill Clinton? Did you denigrate Paula Jones, Juanita Broderrick, Kathleen Wiley, etc.? You all did.
@GOPChairwoman Sadly, yes. 4 Ocare Bronze family plan, monthly premiums would have cost more than our rent. &amp; Very high deductible. Better off paying cash.
@RandPaul I nominate you to be the Senate Majority Leader. Your approach to this Ocare #RepealAndReplace is right on. Thank you for leading. https://t.co/Z3GOOkNy34
@CatDiety Years ago evolutionists claimed humans evolved from monkeys. Now we are cousins. They never claimed we evolved from dirt.
@SenateMajLdr ??? The American people, aside from Medicaid &amp; Medicare pools, need free market solutions. Need lower deductibles &amp; premiums. https://t.co/JT0WcikX0f
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Praying for u 2 have favor with @POTUS. We need smart industry business acumen, not lobbyist's self-preservation tactics. #RepealAndReplace
@MarkRuffalo Nope. They have 2 refer a woman to an outside facility. Just call a PP facility and find out for yourself. #ProtectOurKids #Fight4TheirLives
@ChelseaClinton My family cannot afford Ocare. Middle class that does not qualify for Medicaid. How about my family &amp; the 20 million like us? #Hypocrites.
@RandPaul Please yank leadership right. Husband changed jobs, lost ins &amp; could not afford Ocare. Will now b punished by latest amendment?
@SenateMajLdr Husband changed jobs, lost ins &amp; could not afford Ocare. Will now b punished by ur latest amendment? https://t.co/n0SPbuU4PD
@JulianAssange Think his point is, @POTUS's enemies have a one word vocabulary: collusion. Although I would add obstruction.
@realDonaldTrump Dear @POTUS, Did you know that Robert Mueller recused himself in 2006? Dems asked. He agreed then. @JaySekulow  https://t.co/IKF7sVf2s2
@Desertfox74 @FoxBusiness @Judgenap @POTUS Unlike Obama &amp; Hillary.
@benjaminwittes Pride comes before the fall. Comey's pride and yours...
@POTUS supporters awaiting tonight's rally in Iowa. (Sensitive material because they all speak well of President Trump.) #MAGA https://t.co/nQb9wAIr8K
@marklevinshow Dear Mark, I keep asking who can do anything about this endless, boundary-less investigation? Can anyone, legally, put a halt to this?
@AndrewCMcCarthy @theamgreatness What can be done? Can anyone put an end to this fishing expedition? If this is illegal, it has to come to a quick end. @POTUS, @JaySekulow
@ossoff By lying to your voters that you are a moderate &amp; fiscal conservative? Next time be your self &amp; try running on a Hollywood liberal platform.
@dbongino Claiming moral victories when their candidate LIES about how close he lives to district, that he is a moderate &amp; fiscal conservative. Bogus.
@supertrumpie @mitchellvii Will anyone acknowledge that Ossoff lied claiming he was a moderate &amp; fiscal conservative? Maybe it was closer because he lied to get votes.
@cmclymer So, Ossoff lies about being a moderate, fiscal conservative. He lied to get their votes. Meanwhile he is supported by Uber liberal Cali.
@FreeBeacon @ossoff Worse. His campaign said he lived 3 blocks away. @FreeBeacon reporter took 2 hours to go from his parents home to the edge of district. #GA6
@Cernovich Fantastic. He was always an unreliable (non-conservative) vote, unlike Scalia, Alito &amp; Thomas.
@TuckerCarlson Welcome Back!
@JudicialWatch 8 years of "above the law" attitude. Just like Sandy "stuff Clinton papers in my pants" Berger. All good when u have a D next to your name.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is better off hiring successful, accomplished Trump supporters from the private sector. Ppl with a fire in their belly to #MAGA.
@SenateMajLdr With all due respect, it is time to stop playing D games. Need to change Senate rules for @POTUS's agenda. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/zxYg5J7ait
@costareports If they vote for Ossoff, they are guaranteed zero action &amp; all Russia. #GA6 please vote for @karenhandel . Thank you from the rest of US.
@umpire43 How is this enforced, if he refuses to resign/recuse himself?
@JaySekulow So if Rod Rosenstein recuses himself, Robert Mueller becomes King of the AG office? He is going rogue. Rod Rosenstein needs to fire Mueller.
@brhodes As a parting gift, didn't Obama close doors 2 Cuban refugees? Dems do not care about Cuban ppl, only their Dictator. https://t.co/Qj5zSnMs0H
@DRUDGE Against all odds. Thank you @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Please ask your private legal counsel how to...@ACLJ, etc. https://t.co/AYLaqdeMWd
@DineshDSouza They all act as if Democrats are still in charge, even AG Sessions. @POTUS please go back on offense &amp; control the narrative. Need War Room.
@brookefoxnews @joelpollak Can DAG Rod Rosenstein confirm/deny he made a HUGE mistake appointing Mueller Special Counsel b/c of his close friend/key witness Comey?
@IngrahamAngle @POTUS Republican controlled WH, Senate &amp; House &amp; a 6 month @POTUS is being investigated? What about the unmasking, Lynch's &amp; Holder's obstruction?
@IngrahamAngle @POTUS has been in office 6 months and there are 6 simultaneous investigations? Obama was in office 8 years. Where are their investigations?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JaySekulow @JordanSekulow Please advise President on how to handle and ASAP. https://t.co/S9LBYSJzz1

@realDonaldTrump Can AG Sessions order the DOJ to investigate? And if Reality Winner was charged for leaking, what about James Comey?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump The Special Counsel Statute is on your side. @ACLJ help!!! https://t.co/EjQSePF9am
@SenateMajLdr Russia? What about making America the most competitive nation in the world? Lowest corporate tax rate? Lower taxes for all &amp; Ocare repeal?
@Cernovich Does @POTUS know the truth about H.R. McMaster, his picks and his actions? Or does he give them 100% autonomy? #DrainTheDeepState
@ThePatriot143 Is it a crime to leak this information from the Special Counsel's office to the Washington Post?
@Thomas1774Paine What ever happened to old fashioned libel laws? At one point in time wasn't it illegal for a news source to falsely slander someone?
@JackPosobiec Never meant to diminish heroic efforts of the 2 Capitol Hill Police Officers. Just meant to say we need more good guys with guns to help.
@TheMarkRomano Seems like there will only be "peace" when the Democrats are in charge. Violent plays, violent photo shoots, violent rhetoric, 24/7 rage.
@JackPosobiec "When seconds count, the police are just minutes away"...sadly ten minutes in this case. #2A

@lookner Didn't many Democrat Senators meet with the same Russian Ambassador?
@JaySekulow @JordanSekulow @FoxBusiness Thank you for all that you &amp; your team does. Why is Jeh Johnson giving testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, re: Russia?
@IngrahamAngle @dcexaminer More questions: Did Jeff Sessions choose Rod Rosenstein and Y? Y did Rod Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller, a friend of James Comey? @POTUS
@Franklin_Graham Child abuse = injecting artificial female hormones into a child who has male hormones. These kids are walking science experiments. Dangerous
@MarkWarner So, when foreign governments pay $ to HRC, while Secretary of @StateDept, then foreign influence is OK? Where was your committee then?

@dcexaminer Republican Senators should ask about HIS past collusion. Y did FBI, DOJ &amp; IRS collude when targeting conservatives. https://t.co/m0loc4t3iG
@dbongino @AndrewCMcCarthy Wish @POTUS had selected @AndrewCMcCarthy for FBI Director.
@127slaps @Tuggers56 @JaySekulow @JordanSekulow @JeffreyToobin @AC360 Unlike Fast &amp; Furious Eric Holder, right?
@IngrahamAngle @POTUS Amen!!!!! How else can we #MAGA &amp; become energy independent? I rather have Steve Bannon &amp; Stephen Miller than Gary Cohn.

@steph93065 It was not a typo. @POTUS is more savvy than that. He hinted in his follow-up tweet, to figure it out. It is an acronym.

@jasoninthehouse If Mr. Joe Smith (citizen) was called 2 testify at Senate Intelligence Committee, could he first meet w/ Robert Mueller?

@VP @POTUS But why did NEA get an increase in funding? EPA's funding was only cut by 1%? Refugee funding? AND sanctuary cities were funded + PP? Why?
@SenateMajLdr U increased funding for the NEA??? And more funding for refugees? You went along with all of Pres O's budget/priorities. What about @POTUS?
@SenateMajLdr What about defunding sanctuary cities and PP? Newt Gingrich was able to move Dems to the centre/right. You &amp; @SpeakerRyan cave. Enough!!!
@TEN_GOP Made my day!!! Love it.

@mitchellvii NYT also colors 97% of #GA6 blue. Makes it look like Ossoff won 97% of the district.
@McConnellPress Dear Senator McConnell, When are you going to push for @POTUS's Deputy Secretaries to be confirmed? How about Mr. Acosta?

@hrh_orchid @FreeThinkMind @CNN I lived in NYC for 33 years, w/ a Democrat Governor. Ain't no utopia. Instead #distopia. High income &amp; property taxes. Nothing to show 4 it.
@FreeThinkMind @hrh_orchid @CNN Paperwork + regulations + mandates = Doctors opting out 2. &amp; Most Docs won't accept new Medicaid patients.
@FreeThinkMind @hrh_orchid @CNN insurance. They operate on a cash only business. Their calendars are booked for months. Medicaid + Medicare = Enough government "h/c".
@FreeThinkMind @hrh_orchid @CNN There is only 1 ACA insurance company left in my state - BCBS. &amp; they can charge whatever they want. In my home town, good docs dropped all
@hrh_orchid @FreeThinkMind @CNN Never OK. Please. Obama was Pres for yrs. He had veto pen. Nothing they could do then. Your party passed a bill they did not care 2 read.
@LIBREinitiative Thank you! That is what the @freedomcaucus tried to change. The AHCA bill did nothing about ACA's regulations. @SpeakerRyan @POTUS
@CNN Since the Dems lurched so far left, we need to convince them to switch to the Republican party. Then: 56 (R) vs. 42 (D), 4 more to 60. :)
@hrh_orchid @FreeThinkMind @CNN And your own party created this disaster. Bravo!
@SpeakerRyan This one is for you..... https://t.co/01BbUzmcRo
@steph93065 @freedomcaucus Sorry. @freedomcaucus made AHCA better. Ryan's original bill gave uninsured tax relief in 1/2018. HFC negotiated retro tax relief 1/17.
@KLomiglio @steph93065 Sadly, @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr are open border, big government  politicians. Opposite @POTUS's campaign platform.
@steph93065 @KLomiglio Rep leadership (@SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr ) not including border wall funding in budget 2 appease Dems? Comments?
@realDonaldTrump But @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr are planning on appeasing Dems by not funding the border wall. They are on your side?
@repmarkpocan @TuckerCarlson Where were you &amp; your fellow Democrats when Obama Admin dropped Iran sanctions? And gave THEM billions of $?
@themediawitch @MissLizzyNJ She worked there. Did you? How about these former PP employees? Protect PP at what cost? https://t.co/8rgvlWUyj0
@themediawitch @MissLizzyNJ From a former PP employee, Abby Johnson: https://t.co/924O4NHSVd
@themediawitch @MissLizzyNJ PP refers patients for cancer screenings. Not performed. And it ends the lives of approx. 330,000 babies a year.
@katiehunton @VP Healthcare? You mean the right to kill an unborn baby.....I mean fetus/blob/tumor with a face?
@kirilov_debbie @greta Agree 2 disagree. International $ ties to Clinton are everywhere. It is all good when you have a D next to your name.
@kirilov_debbie @greta If @POTUS's sneezes, it becomes a conspiracy. U never answered about the Clinton Foundation and their ties to Russia.
@TGowdySC !!! https://t.co/OJuiByntms
@kirilov_debbie @greta Democrats have tried hard to find a smoking gun. There is none. It is time 2 fix our problems. Too many to list.
@DLoesch Same people would run story after story alleging an affair.
@espiers Disagree. 1st = Perception that can turn into baseless rumors. 2nd = temptation. As evangelical, do u believe enemy tempts?

@kirilov_debbie @greta Cuban refugees. OK. How about the Clinton Foundation &amp; WJC accepting gobs of $ while she was Secretary of State?
@GOPPollAnalyst @YoungDems4Trump Do you know if these are "real" ppl or bots? In the above shot, looks like Rep Tim Huelskamp real twitter.
@kirilov_debbie @greta Well, Deb. Did you approve when Obama shared ice cream with Castro? Then cancelled the Cuban refugee program?
@greta Can u recognize the hate-filled obsession against @POTUS &amp; anyone he meets. Needs permission 2 be briefed? Anger filled micromangmt.
@greta Where was the outrage w/ Pres Obama's meetings, AG Lynch's meetings? Sorry Greta. Nothing Obama did was ever questioned. #hypocrisy
@DevinNunes Thank u Representative Nunes for your service. Please do not lose heart &amp; please do not take advice from angry ppl: Dems, MSM.
@DaveCullenCF That's all she has. Worked well for her/them in 2016. Not enough ppl in key counties want to hear an angry, snide, smug woman.
@NolteNC Dems collective anger (April, HRC, Hollywood, MSM, @SenSchumer) only stirs up their base. Will keep mod dems &amp; independents away.
@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Any comments about Obama Admin's secret Iran deal, where 30 Senators met with Russian Ambassador to sell them on it?
@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC https://t.co/EfRlMLes0e
@FoxNews @SecretService With all due respect, retired NYPD should take over your ops. They are fantastic. Where is @RudyGiuliani /Ray Kelly?
@SenSanders Your utopian universal healthcare will speed up the current trend. People on universal coverage will have little choice/bad h/c.
@SenSanders Many doctors, good ones, in NYC do not take health insurance. They operate on a cash based business. Their calendars are booked.
@TuckerCarlson @RBronk @FoxNews An actor that truly helps the military? @GarySinise. Typically, Hollywood is anti-military.
@TheJuanWilliams Dear Juan, Actually, Wilders' party gained 7 seats &amp; Rutte's party lost 10 seats. Wilders' party is now second in power.
@ejolly42 @TheHRH @POTUS has an overall pro-growth economic plan. Lower taxes, eliminating billions $ in gov waste &amp; business killing regs.
@ejolly42 @TheHRH @POTUS is actually re-negotiating trade deals 2 substantially lower our trade deficit. Obama wanted to level playing field
@ejolly42 @TheHRH Obama threw $ at every Democrat special interest group, including Iran. https://t.co/TMtlK16Jgd
@markknoller More personal. @POTUS not interested in "staged" phony press pictures. He does not perform on MSM's cue. He does it his way/NYC

@Cernovich Outnumbered in MSM. Did not amount to a hill of beans Nov 2016. What's changed in those 30 states? Still silent majority.
@RealJamesWoods UN = Unethical
@NancyPelosi @POTUS Bronze ACA plan = $1.300 monthly premium. $14,000 deductible. Unethical. Unaffordable. #FuilRepeal
@NancyPelosi @POTUS CBO estimated ACA = 24,000,000 insured. ACA only had 9,200,000 enrolled. How can 26,000,000 lose health insurance?
@cvpayne HI = Insurance co. charging monthly premiums, just in case u need to see a doctor. Pooled $ that you cannot access when u need it.
@cvpayne Dear Charles, It would be more honest if we call it health insurance, instead of "healthcare". Doctors/hospitals provide care.
@Jim_Jordan Dear Representative Jordan, Thank you for your leadership on ACA's #FullRepeal. Thank you for your leadership in the HFC. @POTUS
@USRepGaryPalmer Dear Representative Palmer, Thank you for leading the fight to #FullRepeal ACA. Thank you for your leadership in the HFC.

@oreillyfactor Family of 5, for bronze ACA plan, $1,300 premium &amp; $14,000 deductible. 10% reduction, by 2026, will do nothing for us.
@oreillyfactor Just learned from @Heritage, CBO projects premiums will be lowered by 10% in 2026! &amp; Ryan's plan does not touch regulations.
@RepGutierrez An "undocumented" immigrant was deported 5 times and committed multiple felonies. What do you do? https://t.co/YNVPbkSi4a

@PRyan Our family cannot afford ACA. If we get private insurance this year, we will pay 30% to insurance company for the lapse? No thanks.
@PRyan We want government out of the healthcare business. Otherwise, be honest &amp; rename it: American Aid &amp; Bailout Insurance Industry Act.
@WilkowMajority @washingtonpost Besides in zoos, how many tigers do we have in the US? If we develop land, we would destroy tigers &amp; woods?
@JackyClarke0910 @MichaelzNewz @DailyCaller Treason for what? @POTUS has been in office &lt; 2 months. Specifics please.
@GabeChudo Dems had 0 evidence of Russian/Trump campaign collusion. @POTUS was going back on offense. He also brilliantly used MSM's claims.
@PressGop @realDonaldTrump Good friend of mine has been praying for years to have Maxine Waters removed from her life-long seat. Go get 'em!
@WilkowMajority @washingtonpost These "activists" are racists. They etched a statement against Tiger Woods. If not, why choose those words?
@CarmineZozzora Yes, I guess we will only have "peace" in this country if they control it.
@POTUS Dear President Trump, Please do not let this new h/c bill be an insurance industry bailout. &amp; Medicaid should be separate from bill.
@ValACampbellCPA @DineshDSouza And you were able to convert former Democrats into Republicans! I still tell people about that.

@andjustice4all3 "If you've got his number, he'll talk to you. Damnedest thing I ever seen in my life," Manchin said." @POTUS

@RandPaul Aren't there any smart businessmen in the House of Reps? This is the best they could do? Will contact our reps #FullRepeal. @POTUS
@RandPaul Uninsured will pay insurance co. 30% fine for not having h/c for 63 days? My fam cannot afford $1,300/m. &amp; we do not have iPhones.

@oaklandzoo22 @jsurg77 @washingtonpost As member of Armed Services Comm., 25 ambassador mtgs had nothing to do w/ that line of questioning.
@oaklandzoo22 @jsurg77 @washingtonpost "of info during the campaign between Trump surrogates &amp; intermediaries for Russian government."
@oaklandzoo22 @jsurg77 @washingtonpost did not include full transcript. Listened to Franken clip. Sen Franken clearly asked about exchange
@oaklandzoo22 @jsurg77 It was all about Russians, black mail like dossier and Trump campaign surrogates. Both Sen. Franken &amp; Sen. Leahy.
@drou_bre They have thrown $ around like it is monopoly $.  But it is our taxpayer $. And US debt is $ 20 trillion. #draintheswamp @POTUS
@oaklandzoo22 @jsurg77 Sessions met with 25 foreign ambassadors during same time period. Are u a member of the Armed Services Committee?

@dcexaminer If I were a member of the Armed Services Committee, I would also answer no to that question.
@dcexaminer Senator Warren: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"
@oaklandzoo22 @BretBaier "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"
@SenWarren Yes! We need an AG like Fast &amp; Furious Eric Holder. Can you comment on Holder/Lynch's DOJ slush fund? https://t.co/hoi26Hz4FH
@oaklandzoo22 @BretBaier Even Elizabeth Warren tweeted that Sessions was specifically asked about Russian mtgs and the 2016 Pres campaign.
@BretBaier Sessions met w/ 25 ambassadors during same period, as mbr of Armed Services Committee. Democrats would remove all @POTUS cabinet.

@BretBaier @SecPriceMD @SpecialReport Insurers were created 2 negotiate &amp; cap doctor pay. Who is watching middle man? Rather pay doctors.
@BretBaier @SecPriceMD @SpecialReport Is premium $ divided btw insurance co &amp; gov't? We cannot afford this model. Can premium be eliminated?
@BretBaier @SecPriceMD @SpecialReport premiums go? All that $ just to walk into Doctor's office. Does not include treatment/tests, etc. Why?
@BretBaier @SecPriceMD @SpecialReport and Silver plan $1,750 or $1,900. Sister-in-law's premium on employer hc is $700 per month. Where do
@BretBaier @SecPriceMD @SpecialReport Monthly premiums have sky rocketed, in ACA and private insurance. ACA in my state: Bronze plan $1,300

@drou_bre Agree. Sad = Bronze plan = $ 1,300/month. All to get you in the Doctor's door. Does not cover the visit, tests, procedures. Scam.

@McDreaBean "optical scanners at 248 of the city’s 662 precincts, or 37 %, tabulated &gt; ballots than # of voters tallied by poll workers."
@McDreaBean "If a tree falls in a forest &amp; no one is around to hear it...." Is Detroit News too conservative for you too? I know only CNN.

@realDonaldTrump Thank u President Trump. Cannot believe states practiced catch &amp; release for 8 yrs. If a US citizen committed felonies....
@DonaldJTrumpJr Did you know Twitter is deleting positive replies from his @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump accounts? https://t.co/sF5POw3OUE
@DaveCullenCF Do you know if @POTUS can read our tweets, if we tweet directly to him? Or will they delete any positive tweet sent to him?
@DaveCullenCF All my tweets or replies to tweets from @POTUS get deleted. I watched it happen late Saturday night. Will like his tweets.
@TheJuanWilliams @thehill @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS has been in office &lt; 1 month &amp; Dems stalled voting 4 his cabinet. Enough Juan.
@TheJuanWilliams @thehill @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP This article was written for you, Juan. https://t.co/e2ElHvArYC
@dustylady62 @rabbijilljacobs @POTUS or abstain from a UN veto that condemned Israel &amp; demanded it go back to indefensible 1967 borders.
@dustylady62 @rabbijilljacobs @netanyahu Nor will @POTUS make him use the WH service entrance, give billions of $ to Israel's enemy (Iran),

@realDonaldTrump @CNN Hey @Jack, can't find my tweet to @POTUS. Twitter &amp; MSM will not silence millions of DJT's supporters. #MSM will fail.
@realDonaldTrump @asamjulian @CNN @POTUS @peplamb deleted too. Can you look to see if yours disappears too?
@realDonaldTrump @asamjulian @CNN @POTUS Tested it last night. Saw mine deleted and bible references from One NationUnderGOD @peplamb.
@realDonaldTrump @asamjulian @CNN Asa, Twitter is trying to silence us. Positive replies to @POTUS's tweets are being deleted.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @POTUS, your supporters are being silenced. Positive replies from your tweets are being deleted. Tested it last night.
@Melancholalia @Rockprincess818 MSM keeps propping-up anti-Trump protesters. 64+ mil. voters will not be silenced. Letter writing campaign.
@Melancholalia @Rockprincess818 Outside Twitter, I am going to write emails. They are trying to silence @POTUS supporters. #Censorship.
@Rockprincess818 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Sorry, I meant positive replies are being deleted from his tweets.
@Rockprincess818 Dear Rock Princess, Appears Twitter is deleting positive tweets from appearing on @realDonaldTrump &amp; @POTUS's replies.
@seanspicer Dear Mr. Spicer, We noticed tonight that Twitter is deleting positive tweets to @realDonaldTrump &amp; @POTUS. Only - tweets appear.
@oreillyfactor Mr. O'Reilly, noticed tonight Twitter is deleting positive tweets to @realDonaldTrump &amp; @POTUS. Only negative tweets appear.
@bakedalaska Dear Baked Alaska, You are right! My tweet was deleted from @realDonaldTrump page and so was @peplamb's prayers. Alarm pulled!
@RealJamesWoods @jack @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Given your followers, can you test for yourself and spread the word? Thank you Mr. Woods!
@RealJamesWoods Dear Mr. Woods, I am a huge fan of your work. Appears @Jack is deleting positive tweets for @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS.
@bakedalaska @jack @POTUS Please send positive tweets to both accounts: @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. Let's see if we can test this further.
@bakedalaska @seanhannity @GrrrGraphics @ScottAdamsSays @PrisonPlanet @POTUS Yup. You are right!!! My positive tweet is gone. What do we do?
@bakedalaska @seanhannity @GrrrGraphics @ScottAdamsSays @PrisonPlanet Just sent @POTUS pos. tweet. Let's see how long it stays on top.

@realAngeloGomez Good guys need to stand up and fight for smaller government, state rights, free market values. We need more people like u.
@DineshDSouza @nytimes Ironically, the left keeps mocking @POTUS for claiming mass voter fraud. Here is one example. More to come I am sure.

@realDonaldTrump @ACLJ access, add any exemptions and include all of 9th circuit's standards specified in their order. Supreme Court 8 - 0.
@realDonaldTrump Per @ACLJ, checkmate = cancel existing EO. That stops refugee flow now. Issue a new EO, grant existing visas/green cards
@StacyOnTheRight @HillaryClinton  elder and activist from South Dakota. And the 5th came from Maine. He voted for Bernie.
@StacyOnTheRight @HillaryClinton Ready to laugh? 4 Electors from WA. 3 voted for C.Powell &amp; 1 voted for Faith Spotted Eagle/Native American
@KassyDillon @POTUS B/c President Trump and his Admin needs all of the help they can get. Need to unite to defeat left, short &amp; long term.
@StacyOnTheRight @HillaryClinton Actually, failed Electoral College coup stripped away more of her electoral college votes. She now has 227.
@KassyDillon You can mock Senator Cruz but he will prove to be an asset to @POTUS. Much more reliable than Sen. McConnell.
@KassyDillon Sen Mike Lee, Sen Rand Paul, Sen Ben Sasse &amp; Sen Ted Cruz all have A rating's from https://t.co/wBIKlj2pdp. Senate leadership.

@seanhannity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Learned from Jay Sekulow the UN has been vetting the refugees?! Explains why Obama Admin could not vet.
@Cynthiastruth @azalben @HillaryClinton And it puts Yazidis and Christians first in line to gain refugee status. Obama Admin ignored them.
@azalben ACLJ is on the case. Taking it to the Supreme Court. Lower courts played politics. Simple statute ignored. https://t.co/OMXEtXQIP1

@ChrisVanHollen Why did Dr. Jill Stein raise millions of $ to investigate voter fraud? Why did she and HRC conduct recounts in 3 states?
@BreitbartNews AND, Bernie admitted last night (CNN debate vs. Cruz) that individual tax penalties pay for low income ACA subsidies. Awful.

@SpeakerRyan We need @POTUS economic plan. His policy proposals earned the votes of 30 states. Will you actually obstruct his team too?
@SpeakerRyan No tax cuts until after O'care is replaced? Appears as if you can't chew gum &amp; walk at same time. We need jobs &amp; lower taxes.

@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Just because you and MSM say Bannon = white supremacist does not make him one. You r all non-white supremacists.
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Quoting Nancy Pelosi? How about Val? You had no problems with anything Obama did, right? Do you know his inner circle?
@LOLGOP 48% vs. 46 %, 19 states  + DC vs. 30 states. 232 ECV vs. 306 ECV. After failed coup, HRC = 227 and DJT = 304 . #JustNotThatIntoHer
@LOLGOP Try 48%.
@realDonaldTrump "Vast majority of Muslims in Muslim countries are not covered by the decision". Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan/UAE FM
@realDonaldTrump "There are attempts to give the impression that this decision is directed against a particular religion. This is not true."
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Actual news. Loosely defined. Atenna should be up whenever you hear only negative stories about anyone. Unbalanced.
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod also attended NSC meetings as advisors. Obama's trusted inner circle.
@realDonaldTrump "Without doubt, countries have the sovereign right to make decisions to ensure their sovereignty." Sheikh Abdullah/UAE
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP #FakeNews. Do you normally frequent neo-Nazi websites? Bannon is not a white supremacist. Old, boring, unproven tripe.
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP took in Muslim refugees and ignored life &amp; death struggle of ME Christians. Didn't Obama have a religious preference?
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Obama Admin's Arab Spring created havoc in ME. There has been a Christian genocide, recognised by UN. Yet, Obama Admin
@gurby1 There are so many war torn countries, no one talks about cause/solutions. Only politically expedient solution is take more refugees.
@GovInslee @TuckerCarlson 73 sitting Democrats voted to ban visas from some Muslim countries. That law still exists. https://t.co/loMslKfJPW
@GovInslee @TuckerCarlson Where was ur outrage when ME Christians were being slaughtered and Obama's Admin did not accept them as refugees?
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Why are Republicans radical? Because we oppose killing babies, I mean fetuses? Because we do not want to be Europe? HA
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP Classic. Radicalism = setting buildings on fire, smashing windows, violently beating people. Antifa = Democratic Party
@lizsalandar @TEN_GOP https://t.co/5ksto5KT4w

@Lrihendry Prisoners. That piece of information was suspiciously omitted in news accounts. Hopefully, @POTUS says thanks but no thanks.
@cpicciolini Pres O met with Cuban Dictator Castro. And days before leaving office, he cancels Cuban refugee program. Where was ur outrage?
@BlackSwanSwag @GaryTheMan3 8 yrs of failed policies, incl.Arab Spring inspired by Obama's Admin = refugee crisis. Now this is DJT's fault?
@RealJamesWoods It was Obama's EPA. Not @POTUS's EPA. It was O's failed Arab Spring &amp; foreign policy, hc affordable b/c tax payer subsidies.
@noblebarnes87 Flint Michigan? Obama's EPA. Not @POTUS's EPA. "Isn't it ironic?"

@andjustice4all3 @EdDarrell @JustinRaimondo than making them homeless in Europe or keeping them penned up + dependent in a refugee shelter.
@EdDarrell @JustinRaimondo Not denying them anything. Safe zones in countries where they can speak the language is smarter and more humane..
@Michael_Haz Was there = outrage when Christians in ME countries were slaughtered. Yet Obama only took muslim refugees. Silent Hollywood.
@miscjamielynn @kingrcdd So does President Trump. Part of bigger plan. ME countries that have stable economies should assist. Not the West.
@wikileaks @YouTube Remember the failed Arab Spring? Obama Admin inspired? Let's make @POTUS44, @AmbassadorRice, @HillaryClinton house them.
@EdDarrell @JustinRaimondo Is this humane? Progressive solutions. Welcome! Here is a mattress. Maybe a tent. https://t.co/qD8INSI2a8
@JustinRaimondo Obama Admin's failed Arab Spring. Destabilized ME. Complete travesty. Still solution cannot be = relocate all to the West.
@msusuallyright @CarmineZozzora @aduanebrown @USAneedsTRUMP Aren't "rights" given to US citizens, based on the US Constitution?
@LToddWood @WashTimes Arab Spring. No one can live in these ME countries? @AmbassadorRice, ME countries need to take care of own citizens.
@mi2guys @steph93065 @AdrianAmherst All seems extremely one-sided. It becomes the West's responsibility? Safe zones in near-by countries.
@HillaryClinton Is this humane? Progressive solutions. Welcome! Here is a mattress and maybe a tent. https://t.co/qD8INSI2a8
@mi2guys @steph93065 @AdrianAmherst Elephant in the room that no one talks about. Can't ME countries have stable economies, provide jobs?

@katylied67 BTW, here is a detailed cost analysis of the US Refugee Program. https://t.co/SFdqIW53UG
@katylied67 OK. Why can't muslim countries provide for their citizens? Cannot take everyone in. Host countries need to be stabilized. Agree?
@_MyIsabelle @Pan_HolyTrinity @Lrihendry Yes, that was my point. Y can't each middle eastern country take responsibility for it's citizens?
@RealJamesWoods Critics of this ban are racists. Seem to claim middle eastern countries are incompetent. Can't take care of their citizens.
@_MyIsabelle @Pan_HolyTrinity @Lrihendry How about middle eastern countries take responsibility for their own citizens' sustenance?
@Lrihendry Do you remember the african-american woman who asked if she could claim refugee status for her to move out of inner-city project?
@nikkihaley @antonioguterres Dear HRC voters. Susan Rice + Samantha Power were embarrassments. Cannot wait to see your improvements at UN.

@BillHemmer Is it really fair to compare 2008 inauguration crowd size? The Media fawned all over Pres Obama and his family. Now in 2017,

@HawkenLuc @123Gilland DJT was using burning figuratively. We have a massive problem in our inner cities. No one else talks about it.
@HawkenLuc @123Gilland Agree. However, years and years of neglect by elected officials representing people. Forgotten people. Failed policy.
@123Gilland @HawkenLuc around downtown ATL, you also see a lot of desolation. NYC also has expensive areas and poor areas. Homelessness 2.
@123Gilland @HawkenLuc houses. Realtor recommended we stay away. Fixed up houses one block. Next block you hear gun shots. And if drive

@123Gilland @HawkenLuc Saw it for years in ATL + NYC. Wondered if their Reps were blind to see reality,did not care or clueless how to fix.
@bessbell Ever visit Lewis' counties? DJT speaks truth. I lived there. Blocks of boarded up houses. Yr after yr. Nothing changes under Dems.
@123Gilland @HawkenLuc @josephamodeo Lived in GA. Lewis' counties = many boarded up houses.Gentrification,1 block nice homes,next block not.
@josephamodeo Ever visit Lewis' counties? Downtown Atlanta has many boarded up houses year after year. What change did any Democrat bring?
@realDonaldTrump Lived in GA. Looked at buying house in DeKalb County. One block gentrified. Next block boarded up houses. Same in ATL. Sad.
@marcorubio R. Tillerson would be USA's top diplomat. Ironic you want him to declare Putin a war criminal on national tv? Please vote 4 him.
@StageYaneu Do you know anything about the Muslim Brotherhood?
@StageYaneu Americans are not furious with PE Trump or the GOP. Do you live in California? Time to turn off CNN.
@StageYaneu Isn't it funny how HRC lost more EC votes than Trump? Instead of 234, she earned 227. And DJT lost 1/2. He earned 304.
@tedcruz Thank you Senator Cruz. Thank U for taking the lead in the Senate. And I have no doubt you will be one of Pres.Trump's best allies.
@DineshDSouza Good morning. I tweeted E. Cummings reminding him segregationists were all Democrats. Democrats fought Republicans to keep it.
@dsigningwmn Media colluding with HRC during campaign ok with you? Campaign editing stories before being published? Anything a Dem does...
@RepCummings Do you realize segregation in the South was mandated by Democrats? Dems fought Republicans to keep segregation. #FakeHistory
@dsigningwmn Glenn Greenwald said everything Wikileaks showed was real. Media colluding and giving debate questions? https://t.co/6GLwFJPLSz
@dsigningwmn @WikiLeaks is an organization. Leak was a ticked DNC insider/Bernie supporter. Bigger than Assange. Solid 10 yr track record.
@dsigningwmn Wikileaks exposed MSM. Shameless collusion with HRC's campaign. MSM even allowed her campaign to edit stories. #FakeNews
@LeesyPeesy @mrDaveKrumholtz Who is upset? I am just thrilled that the media keeps getting exposed for its bias. January 20, 2017. Great day

@SenFranken Did you speak with Jill Stein about her claims of voter fraud in: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania?
@Rockprincess818 Lived in NYC for 33 yrs and NJ for 5 yrs. Every election I showed my DL. Poll workers told me "you do not need that here."
@SenFeinstein Did AG Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch investigate the sanctuary city death of Kate Steinle? How about AG Lynch meeting with WJC?
@SenFeinstein An Attorney General that obeys the law? Like AG Eric Holder? Did the DOJ ever comply? https://t.co/kY6HPipwYr

@mamalocksy Sorry to disappoint. President Trump will not be impeached. Republicans control both the Senate and House. Love Trumps hate.
@mamalocksy You are the one incessantly saying Trump supporters are obsessed with HRC and Obama. I disagree. We are looking ahead.
@mamalocksy And name calling is so Junior High. As a Bernie supporter, here is a great read - "Defending The Free Market" by Robert Sirico.
@mamalocksy Feel confident that most Trump supporters want her to go away. MSM wants to keep her in the spotlight. #JustNotThatIntoHer
@CNN President Obama's foreign policy legacy. Will you cover this? Will you investigate a Democrat Admin?  https://t.co/IVSCFLqxvE
@EbonGoode @TweetiePieKC54 Nominate someone who can appeal to more than 18 states + DC.
@RealJamesWoods Voted in NYC for years. Always showed my driver's license and poll workers told me, "You don't need that here." Same in NJ.

@mamalocksy @mousepudding @tommeder Dems are fixated with HRC. Recounts, ECV failed coup. Hollywood vids. Obama is obsessed with himself.

@JamesRosenFNC Thank you for always asking challenging questions and holding all accountable. Sad to know your reporting was hampered.
@ParkerMolloy @realDonaldTrump Always trolling DJT. Did you criticize Pres O when he skipped his intel briefings? https://t.co/4AMoL2xRzA
@SenSchumer Foreign Policy via twitter? How did this tweet work out for the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram?https://t.co/ikPLroUph2
@mikekidd10141 Bravo. When your side refuses to debate issues on all sides, your side sinks to name calling. Your pic describes you well.
@dcexaminer Meanwhile, no one has ever denied the veracity of the leaked e-mails. These documents speak volumes for themselves.
@TuckerCarlson Congratulations on your new time slot!
@mikekidd10141 Did you ever ask yourself what HRC promised for Clinton Foundation foreign donations? And how about? https://t.co/T7jFRnasO0
@dcexaminer An answer to prayer!  Wish they all could have left November 8th.

@PCK1013 ACA subsidies.Dems want to brag.ACA is so exp that the poor need subsidies."Non-poor" pay higher prem + deduct. Payin' fair share.
@TSewBiz @steph93065 Hopefully before the IRS takes the $ from our tax return.

@pulte Did you ever hear of https://t.co/CgvFR0KEu7 in Colorado? They are working to abolish poverty starting in Denver.They do a great wrk.
@realDonaldTrump Fam of 5. Job w/o hc. Cannot afford AFA. Forced to pay tax, I mean fine. Not comfortable taking subsidies. Others pay 4 it.
@vj44 With all due respect, Pres O had many scandals including Fast and Furious, Benghazi, polluting Colorado River https://t.co/pqLZx8nVCE
@RealBenCarson Dr. Carson, Good aftn. In relation to your new position as HUD Sec, can you look a great program https://t.co/CgvFR0KEu7?
@Cernovich Is it illegal to threaten a President? There needs to be repercussions. This goes well beyond free speech.
@RedNationRising @dcexaminer Elections have consequences. With all due respect, let the "folks" collectively tell Pres O, Stand Down!
@somethingothers @ParkerMolloy Ego? Can you justify death threats made to Electors and to him? Why can't Dems accept election results?
@realDonaldTrump Haapy New Year to you, your fam and your entire Admin. Blessings to you from a former NYer now lvng in Sweet Home Alabama.
@ParkerMolloy Enemies of PE - DJT = Anyone who won't accept election results, slander him/his family,make death threats,vow to not wrk w/him
@ParkerMolloy Part 1: Did not vote for Pres O. Never agreed with anything Pres O did. He was still my President. Enemies of PE DJT =
@JudgeJeanine To delegitimize the PE - DJT. Failed recounts,failed EC coup, promised protests/riots on inauguration day.Bone to HRC/WJC/DNC.
@continetti @realDonaldTrump Fantastic article. Thank U for your research and explanation of street corner conservatism. It defines me too.
@continetti understands Trump. Can critics put the election behind them and look past old sound bites? https://t.co/zIS56uTz5I
@realDonaldTrump Here is a great article about your win. Outside Cali and NY, you beat Hillary by 3M. https://t.co/VIpQX5a6tx

@davidfrum Can you imagine HRC + WJC receiving millions of $ from Foreign Governments for years, including 2016? https://t.co/nIm1DvcYy0
@realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson When the left rail against you, point to this: https://t.co/Vj83GQ1Mll
@jahimes Oh but a community organizer and an unaccomplished junior senator had your approval? Pres O was a terrible Commander-in-Chief.

@jeffgreco @tedcruz Lived in NYC for 33 years. Never once was I asked for a voter id.The poll worker actually refused to look at my license.
@AjitPaiFCC Thank you for your courage to alert the public, back when the FCC wanted to put monitors in each newsroom and on net neutrality.
