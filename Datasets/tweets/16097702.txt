May it ever be thus. Lord, hear our prayer.
We are blessed in many ways, but one is that the horrors of two world war birthed in our allies and ourselves a commitment to avoid such senseless industrial-scale slaughter for now four generations.
But what our allies and enemies lost in that war goes beyond anything in the American experience. Even the Civil War, which claimed about 2 percent of the American population, can‚Äôt equal the staggering death toll.
American forces showed great valor and made enormous sacrifices. Belleau Wood, Cantigny, the Somme and, finally, the 110,000 U.S. casualties in the Meuse-Argonne who broke the back of the German defense
In the battle at Verdun, the Germans and the French combined for more than 300,000 dead ‚Äî that‚Äôs about the size of the city of St. Louis.
To compare, that would be like 49 million American men killed or wounded in a war today.
The French saw 1.7 million killed and 4.3 wounded. That was 15 percent of France‚Äôs pre-war total population. German losses were similar as a percentage of their population.
I think it hard for modern Americans to understand the staggering losses Europeans suffered in WWI.

At least the Cubs lost.
Now seems like the perfect time to share one‚Äôs embittered views about gender politics. Exactly at this moment. Right now.
Kay. Bye.
Mobs, as it turns out, are ugly.
Measuring political power by how many people you can get to gather together and scream at people, whether it‚Äôs senators or the press at a campaign rally, will bear ill fruit.
This, of course, is terrible and both un-republican and anti-democratic
I imagine that going forward these performative episodes will be more common and deemed more significant as they go.
Social media allows people to organize in ways previously unknown, but the most prized measurement is still about getting people to show up in meat space.
But as with Obama and Trump campaign rally sizes, the ultimate demonstration of devotion in our era is basically the flash mob.
People have tried to influence Senate votes with letters, telegraphs, phone calls, faxes and social media posts. Picture Jimmy Stewart and the bulging mailbags.
A thought about crowds and crowd sizes in light of the protests today at the Senate.

@zwash300 @Bencjacobs @rubycramer Why would this story, if true, mean anything like that?
We will be sorry for the death of these two parties, I‚Äôm afraid.
To say that the convention is to step aside after a loss relates basically only to the Rayburn-Martin duel. Otherwise, no one even was shameless enough to try. And no party was weak enough to allow it.
Well, Martin and Rayburn
No joke: Democrats could crap out this year for their House minority leader alone. Talk about a dubious distinction. That would be five consecutive House defeats. Noting comes close. Only one ‚Äî Joe Martin ‚Äî even stood after a defeat. Such selfishness.

@BONeal1987 My point is that trying to ruin my favorite (but what is inarguably one of the finest places to learn things about our world today) paper over what we are told is an honest disagreement...
@BONeal1987 Well, it‚Äôs not techically the law for me to be honest, but okayyyyyy... The difference between the claims is significant. I find the audio unambiguous but, who cares?
@BONeal1987 Who is defending Romney and what on God‚Äôs green earth so those other issues have to do with the underlying claim?
‚ÄúTo excuse what can really produce good excuses is not Christian character; it is only fairness. To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable, because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.‚Äù ‚Äî C.S.L.

@kurtimus @GlennKesslerWP Right. My point is that ‚Äúfact-checking‚Äù is not a transcendent discipline. Like all forms of journalism ‚Äî and all human endeavor ‚Äî it is inherently limited. There is no algorithm to determine falsity in much of what we discuss in the business of government and public life.
@OConnell75thRR  https://t.co/YKzDP6OhrX
@kurtimus @GlennKesslerWP Apples are apples and oranges are oranges. But, which apple is best? Best for pies? Best to eat at air temperature with fried chicken at a tailgate. Not trying to be pedantic, saying that fact checking is not scientific.
@OConnell75thRR This is how we got the Bichon Frise
@OConnell75thRR That‚Äôs when you change the climate into a talking animal
@kurtimus Then I guess we just disagree. I think much of fact checking is highly subjective and, more importantly, subject to the same vagaries as the reporting it often pretends to transcend. I like @GlennKesslerWP version. Comes at it as a reporter.
@siis Just found them tonight! Super impressed.

I suspect church leaders who have sought these changes will live to regret their choice.
But practically, these restrictions have provided boundaries in an era when denominational authority and order has been collapsing.
It may be unconstitutional for the government to restrict free expression, especially vis-a-vis matters of faith.
Bringing explicit electioneering into congregations will be irresistible to some. And that will be yet another reason to stay away.
The rule is ostensibly designed to keep churches out of politics. But a main benefit to churches is to keep politics out of them.
This is bad news... for churches.   https://t.co/gITGxBJe63
