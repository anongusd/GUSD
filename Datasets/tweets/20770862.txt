6) Speeding up the preparation of a comprehensive NATO strategy to counter Russian anti-access/area-denial capabilities.
5) Enhancing NATO‚Äôs speed of recognition of threats, assembly of forces, and decision to act. In practical terms, this means that NATO must further streamline its decisionmaking structures and procedures and invest in capabilities able to boost situational awareness.
4) Ensuring the proper size, readiness, deployability, and sustainability of large military formations (also called ‚Äúfollow on forces‚Äù). NATO‚Äôs reinforcement strategy should envisage plans for such formations to break through and operate in the anti-access/area-denial bubbles.
3) Strengthening the NATO Command Structure, which is still the skeletal framework upon which NATO‚Äôs military capability hangs.
2) Enhancing military mobility, in close cooperation with the EU. The goal is to ensure a robust ability to deploy personnel, and equipment within and beyond the European theater in times of peace, crisis, and conflict.
1) Boosting the readiness of forces with the NATO Readiness Initiative (also called the ‚ÄúFour Thirties‚Äù) at its core. In practice, it would mean that by 2020 allies would have 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 combat vessels ready within 30 days or less.
