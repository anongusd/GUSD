Politics is the art of looking for trouble,	finding it whether it exists or not,	diagnosing it incorrectly,	and applying the wrong remedy.
A promising young man	should go into politics so that he can	go on promising for the rest of his life.
Government is like a baby.	An alimentary canal with	a big appetite at one end	and no sense of responsibility at the other.
Some men change their party for the sake of their	principles; others their principles for the sake of	their party.
Politics gives guys so much power that they tend to	behave badly around women. And I hope I never get	into that.
The word ‘politics’ is derived from the word	‘poly’,	meaning ‘many’,	and the word ‘tics’, meaning ‘blood sucking	parasites’.
A good leader is a person	who takes a little more than	his share of the blame	and	a little less than his share of the credit.
Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build a bridge even where there's no river.
Democracy does not guarantee equality of conditions - it only guarantees equality of opportunity.
