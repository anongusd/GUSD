Watch American Hangman... not too bad of a movie
Watching Fez on NCIS just isn't right...
Watch Dead In a Week - Good newer movie...  But, skip watching Glass Jaw (bad acting and you can pretty much guess the whole movie plot in the first few minutes.)
Watch The Widows, another good movie
Watch the Clovehitch Killer, good movie.
Anyone I know get a speeding ticket on 75 going through the Toledo area lately? They have a speed camera...
