@LewisUnderscore @Thejakeoltmann @lilsarg @Xpublius @jaketapper I understand that. But it is so obvious that they are. A law should be passed designating them as such. In the meantime, people are having their rights taken away
@TheTruthHu @emerald_aly @lilsarg @jaketapper Exactly. So why are conservatives being discriminiated against?why is that rule not applied uniformly across the platform?
@LewisUnderscore @Thejakeoltmann @lilsarg @Xpublius @jaketapper Not when its a public utility in the free market.
@LewisUnderscore @VintKahn @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper But they have become almost necessary therefore public utilities. Some sort of regulation should be applied
@VintKahn @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper Exactly.
@LewisUnderscore @Thejakeoltmann @lilsarg @Xpublius @jaketapper Its not fair. Simple. Voices are being silenced at the whim of a guy sitting in his office.
@_pochemuchka_ @lilsarg @jaketapper Please dont state the obvious. That rule is not applied fairly to everyone on the platform. You have conservatives throsn off but guys like farrakhan and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad still tweeting merrily
@Thejakeoltmann @lilsarg @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @jaketapper Social media has become a necesary public utility. Therefore they should be subjected to some regulation.
@BKlein059 @BradMossEsq No one has been implocates but the psycho himself. Secondly,if you dont ban farrakhan, then spread the rule fairly across your platform. Apply the same to everyone. It is so one sided

@endofbellcurve @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper No wrong. They are being deplatformed because they are a conservative company. The guy who sent bombs had a fb account. Farrakhan is on twitter. Be real
@urulokid @LewisUnderscore @Tweetqualizer_ @lilsarg @Xpublius @jaketapper As a Jewish conservative, your insinuations are disgraceful
@petris32 @lilsarg @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @jaketapper Exactly. Their rules are so warped and against conservatives

@_pochemuchka_ @lilsarg @jaketapper Well when people are discriminated against because of their political ideology,that is wrong
@LewisUnderscore @Tweetqualizer_ @lilsarg @Xpublius @jaketapper Conservatives being discriminiated against just because of their political ideology is wrong. Sad that nothing can be done

@endofbellcurve @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper As a jew,you disgust me. Using the nazis as a way to score points. You are not making a sound arguement
@lilsarg @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @jaketapper And whose political ideology were you referring to?
@FMGhost09 @lilsarg @jaketapper Do not blame conservatives for the actions of a psycho anti semite
@yomi_olympic @lilsarg @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @jaketapper Exuce me? As a jew he terrifies me and my people. How dare you say im wrong
@LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper Give me a break. Fb and twitter has had plenty of violent peole on their network but only gab is discriminated against. Im not the biggest fan of gab but this discrimination is wrong
@Freezerburn242 @FisherStudio @LydiaSnider @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper Really?what a joke. Why is farrakhan still on Twitter? Because he is vital to the left huh? As a jew, liberals are bigger anti semites than anyone ive ever encountered.
@lilsarg @LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @jaketapper So why wasnt farrakhan banned and countless 'innocent ' conservatives were? Simple. They discriminate based on political ideology. Why isnt mahmoud ahmadinejad banned from twitter when his whole platform is based on violence?
@LewisUnderscore @Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper This is discrimination. Peple are treated differently based on thsir political ideology
@chgotolv @ClancysDaddy @LydiaSnider @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper Its not only money. Its also narrative and control
@FisherStudio @LydiaSnider @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper There r no fair rules here. Conservatives and liberals are treated differently. That is discrimination
@lilsarg @asalsman @Lottacrime @LydiaSnider @jaketapper We are talking about shutting down a whole company. For heavens sake. Lets shut down fb and twitter since plenty crazy ppl has accounts there too
@FMGhost09 @lilsarg @jaketapper Exuce me? There are assholes on both sides. Lets see farrakhan banned and wl go from there
@emerald_aly @lilsarg @jaketapper Violent anti semitism?let start with farrakhan
@ClancysDaddy @LydiaSnider @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper Very easily said but not done. And secondly, the dearth of competition is that liberals run the vast majority of social media companies. They use their power to silence people without any pushback.
@Lottacrime @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper The media is a threat
@emerald_aly @lilsarg @jaketapper But they dont. Thats the point. Conservatives on all platforms are being discriminated against because those platforms are run by liberals. Thats why the freedom scares conservatives. They are the one losing their voice
@FMGhost09 @lilsarg @jaketapper Conservatives being discriminated against and different rules being applied to them makes me nervous about free speech and its application.
@Xpublius @lilsarg @jaketapper Exuce me? When different rules are applied to conservatives and liberals, that is a problem of freedom for conservatives
@emerald_aly @lilsarg @jaketapper Obviously. But that is not the case here. Why was gab suspended and not fb when the guy has accounts in both places?since leftists are in charge of most social media,they apply a different set of rules to conservatives. This is wrong
@LydiaSnider @asalsman @lilsarg @jaketapper Anti trust Laws should apply to social media. They do not operate fairly nor honestly. Capitalism has plenty restraints and laws applied to businesses especially when theres a dearth of competition
@BKlein059 @BradMossEsq 1st of all,their terms r biased &amp; unclear. Farrakhan is still on but countless conservative have been banned-as an example. Second, there shud be some anti trust Laws applied to social media. They do not operate fairly. You wouldnt be saying this if the shoe is on the other foot
