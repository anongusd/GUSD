Nothing's more awkward than noting the 16-year old was too young to vote for her. And yet, DiFi later likes the young woman's idea of being her intern. Gray areas -- i.e., real life -- hard to see in a world of social media snippets. Differing opinions of how DiFi handled things.
I'm grateful to those who have posted the entire video (6 parts, I think). Context! From my journalist's vantage point, it offers a glimpse at a senator who certainly listens to the points made but also is frustrated at times, making for some awkward interactions.
@Chico_Bob Sure, a fair point. But the senator's irritation is what's making this video go viral. Certainly she's been in more frustrating situations than this one, right?
@altamirajuan Yeah, I think that's why the video has gotten traction with some news outlets. It does not seem to be her best moment.
@tigerbeat And I certainly appreciate that. It's one of the most talked about videos on my Twitter feed tonight, but there are varying takes on it out there from people who have always struck me as pretty level-headed.
@altamirajuan Sure, certainly a reasonable read of the video. But like with so many viral moments, I want to know what happened *before* the clip. How did the dialogue begin, did she have a clash with adults before kids began speaking, etc. I always want unfiltered version of things like this.
Video of DiFi talking (debating?) kids &amp; young adults over Green New Deal is sparking very different reactions. Hard to deny they wanted to pin her down and she was unhappy with their approach. But opinions diverge on who was being "disrespectful." In short: politics circa 2019.

We'll be reading tea leaves of @GavinNewsom's #CASOTS on high-speed rail for a long time. For now, seems he wanted to lower the bar while not altogether stop it. Key Q is whether a slowdown gives more time to seek $ to build the whole thing...or signals investors to take a pass.
@GavinNewsom And @GavinNewsom's first #CASOTS is over. A lot of news, a lot to chew on. Total speaking time, by my count was 43 minutes and 15 seconds. Bullet train and water tunnels changes, new appointees, talk of healthcare and aging and more. A lot to consider.
@GavinNewsom And one more news nugget from #CASOTS. On data privacy, @GavinNewsom says he's "asked my team to develop a proposal for a new Data Dividend for Californians, because we recognize that your data has value and it belongs to you." (Don't know what that means just yet, folks.)
@GavinNewsom "It‚Äôs time to develop a new modern compact for California‚Äôs changing workforce," Newsom says in #CASOTS. "This is... much bigger than Dynamex." (The ellipsis is b/c he keeps adding "respectfully" to his prepared remarks.)
@GavinNewsom This is already twice as long as the typical Jerry Brown #CASOTS -- which, of course, was a third as long as those of Schwarzenegger and Davis. Just sayin'.
@GavinNewsom Trump shade thrown in #CASOTS by Newsom: "The White House is laser-focused... on destroying the Affordable Care Act." Calls efforts on killing the individual mandate "vandalism."
@GavinNewsom More #CASOTS news: @GavinNewsom seems to embrace expansion of rent control in CA. "Get me a good package on rent stability this year and I will sign it" he tells legislators.
@GavinNewsom gets #CASOTS applause for his approach on housing crisis, less clapping for his approach pushing some cities. Again calls for enviro review to be streamlined for housing efforts.
@GavinNewsom @melmason @GavinNewsom says in his #CASOTS says he's launching an Alzheimer's task force and taps @mariashriver to lead it. he father, Sargent Shriver, died from the disease... Newsom has long cited him as a hero.
@GavinNewsom @GavinNewsom calls for a "Master Plan" for aging in CA. Note: You can read all about the issue in @melmason's fantastic 2018 campaign look at the topic https://t.co/0SPF9AWW5Q
@GavinNewsom If you're keeping track, we haven't had a #CASOTS speech with significant policy pronouncements in a long time. Gov. Brown really didn't see the speech as that kind of event. Newsom is, at least in comparison to Brown, swinging for the fences.
@GavinNewsom And another #CASOTS nugget: Newsom taps Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg to lead a new statewide Commission on Homelessness &amp; Supportive Housing.
More #CASOTS news: @GavinNewsom taps Linda Darling Hammond, a longtime education advocate and researcher, as president of the California State Bd. of Education.
On energy and PG&amp;E, Newsom's #CASOTS sets 60-days for his strike force to come back with some recommendations. (Me: 60 days as of when?)
@GavinNewsom And there's this: a new chair of the CA State Water Resources Control Board. Felicia Marcus to be replaced by Joaquin Esquivel. A #CASOTS with news, unlike most of Brown's.
And another #CASOTS newsmaking moment: @GavinNewsom says he does not support "the twin tunnels" for CA water project but a smaller project. Lots of Dems didn't applaud. He insists it's an effort to get past "the old binaries."
"Let‚Äôs get something done, once and for all," Newsom says on bullet train. But he insists in #CASOTS that he's not walking away from the project, even as he seems to endorse a radical downsizing.
@GavinNewsom This is some big #CASOTS news: @GavinNewsom is recasting bullet train as a more limited project for forseeable future. "The project, as planned, would cost too much and respectfully take too long."
@GavinNewsom In his #CASOTS discussion of immigration and decision to cancel the National Guard help to the Trump admin, Newsom makes it clear. "The answer to the White House, with all due respect is no more division, no more xenophobia. No more nativism."
@GavinNewsom Newsom notes it's 15 years to the day he helped Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin become groundbreaking same-sex couple to marry in SF -- an effort that ultimately sparked a national change. #CASOTS
@GavinNewsom "By every traditional measure, you just heard that, the state of our state is strong." (Yes, like the national speech, a predictable #CASOTS moment.)
@GavinNewsom A shout-out to the star of his January inauguration in the #CASOTS speech: "Let me reassure everyone: our son Dutch is not here.  We learned our lesson at the inauguration."
And here we go: @GavinNewsom's first #CASOTS speech... some tweets to follow in this thread.

@GavinNewsom In short, these are another clear sign of an expansive, more activist governor's office than the small top-level team under Brown. Schwarzenegger also had a big staff, so expanding is not without precedent. The policy tasks, though, are clearly part of the Newsom agenda.
Along with selecting seasoned Brown admin veteran-Wade Crowfoot-as CA's natural resources secretary, @GavinNewsom's appointments this afternoon are for jobs that never existed before. Senior advisors in the inner sanctum on "cradle to career," early childhood, immigration &amp; more.
@Head_sherpa Even if the press is excluded from an event -- and we often are -- the broader public, through the news media, has a right to know when the governor is traveling and who he's meeting with. Transparency in scheduling seems to me to be a no-brainer.
Sounds as though more than one event today for the governor.		As noted earlier, no notification to the news media nor access to the event for an issue of such importance. https://t.co/AhAbLTMF6T

Note: Gov. Brown frequently failed to notify the press when he traveled the state to conduct meetings and other official business. We called out those instances, and so it seems fair in this admin, too. Today's event was kept off the news media radar. https://t.co/xP3mklsto5

Tonight's updated/expanded story at @GavinNewsom's first #cabudget... lots of unexpected cash, a variety of proposals on how to spend it. https://t.co/sNnPh0cIN9
@seanrobertgill I don't know. Color me baffled. One hunch is that it helps keep everyone focused on the myriad of new proposals, not a big dollar figure they can hope to use/demand for something else.
@GavinNewsom @kronayne There's a lot more to chew on. Not that I'm going to give it all away on Twitter. Updated LAT story coming soon. All in all, a very memorable #cabudget day. -30-
@GavinNewsom @kronayne Also note the governor said at one point that he'd be surprised if #CALeg didn't like his budget b/c "90% of what I laid out is their idea." He also suggested new negotiating tactic: agree to spending now, don't wait for May-June deliberations. That's a marked change from past /7
@GavinNewsom @kronayne Also worth noting other economic factors also have made this #cabudget flush with cash. Example: the Prop98 school funding guarantee will be met by ~$1.5B more in property taxes than state revenues. (Remember, P98 blends local/state money.) That frees up $ for other things. /6
@GavinNewsom @kronayne What confused a lot of folks is that Team Newsom is counting $10B of the $21.5 unrestricted windfall as part of a newly branded budget "resiliency" effort -- things like debt payments, boosting safety net reserve for social services pgms, etc. /5
@GavinNewsom @kronayne In short form, the $21.5 billion spend-as-you-want windfall (read: on top of the "rainy day" fund reserves) is astounding. $18.5B would go to one-time things, $3B for ongoing programs (IHSS, CalWORKS, higher education). That money isn't all one fiscal year, but it's huge. /4
@GavinNewsom Hard to overstate this next fact: The actual size of the unrestricted tax windfall his #cabudget projects was oddly missing from any of the documentation. It took Q from @kronayne and then follow-up post-Newsom with his budget director to really get to the meat of things... /3
@GavinNewsom First, just an observation on style and presentation: Newsom's almost 2-hr event was without precedent (at least in past two decades). Equal parts methodical &amp; stream of consciousness, it's clear the new governor is eager to take all comers... even if not Qs were answered. /2

RT @rpyers: @madrid_mike GOP House candidates carried 7 of California's congressional districts, Cox won 11, and the gas tax repeal won 17.‚Ä¶
@krakowianin91 Yes, without having more data, we don't really know who voted for which candidate. But total votes cast, I think, offers a snapshot of the candidate's viability (and the party brand's strength). And both were not great in some of these districts.
The more data we get, and more is coming, the better we'll see what really happened. At this point, it's simply a snapshot of how the voters these Republican congressional incumbents/hopefuls needed weren't there. -30-
The larger point was that raw Republican votes in some of these districts were down dramatically from prior elections. Yes, Dems likely can brag that they kept their numbers from presidential years. But these are also districts where Reeps did better 2 years ago *and* HRC won. /4
Certainly 2016, a presidential year, had higher turnout than this year -- abt 1.9 million more votes cast statewide. But 2018 enthusiasm was so far above other midterms that it's hard to lump it in with all those that came before. (Remember, it was highest midterm since 1982.) /3
Several folks have asked about why I didn't use 2014 election as a comparison, given it was the most recent midterm. Certainly could do that, but keep in mind that 2014 was a historic low for turnout -- which makes it hard to know what to do with that year's apathy. /2

@JeromePandell @CAGOP Aside from the fact that the column‚Äôs impetus was my own poking around turnout data (not a pitch or suggestion), I don‚Äôt think 2014‚Äôs historically low turnout is a good comp. And districts were redrawn in 2011, which makes 2010 data of limited/no use.
@aewright It‚Äôs a fair point, but data isn‚Äôt there to answer the question. I don‚Äôt think 2014 is a good marker, given turnout was historically low. And 2010 isn‚Äôt usable because that‚Äôs the old district maps. I don‚Äôt think 2016 is unfair, given this year‚Äôs pretty strong statewide turnout.

In other words, it‚Äôs hard not to see these results ‚Äî a Democrat with almost 62% of the vote for governor in highest turnout midterm since ‚Äò86 ‚Äî as anything other than a huge crisis for the CA Republican Party. Cox, their most visible state candidate, didn‚Äôt move the needle. -30-
There are a lot of comparisons right now to gubernatorial elections of the past (present company included). The challenge is that prior to 2014, those included third-party candidates. So Lungren ‚Äò98 et al. might have been higher had R-minded voters had nowhere else to go.
The results suggest the true base of state Republicans in this election was just under 4.5 millon voters. Though still about 1 million ballots to check, that‚Äôs slightly under the party‚Äôs actual registration. Did some Republicans just sit this election out completely?
With elex results showing John Cox winning just 38% of the vote for governor, CA polling of Trump‚Äôs job approval seems to be the kind of political shorthand I thought it might be in this pre-election analysis. And well below the #KashkariLine of 40%. https://t.co/PytaaoIQ3I

@mugwump2 Always the underdog, yes, though it was only a +7.5 D seat when she won in ‚Äò14. Politics is a strange business, and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this race, even in the current environment.
@Head_sherpa I think that‚Äôs a bit of political Kool-Aid, respectfully. You think Poizner wouldn‚Äôt have seen himself in another job as a newly christened independent officeholder?
@zagirl2k On our podcast, we noted that Thurmond was the Dem in the race with the party endorsement... and that if the late voters were party-line folks, it‚Äôs hard to see Tuck coming back in this contest.
Also worth mentioning tonight victory of Lara as CA insurance commissioner over Rep-turned-indy Poizner. (We talked this,too, on the podcast.) Vote trend in recent days showed strength of Dem brand... with a dose of ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that Poizner guy a Republican?‚Äù from the savviest voters.

It‚Äôs going to take some time, as I note in this week‚Äôs episode, to see whether the flood waters of Dem victories this month are actually a new, higher (blue) sea level. But for now, hard to find a brand of GOP politics that plays outside the safest enclaves.
Assembywoman Baker was almost alone in trying to navigate the middle of Sacramento politics. The party‚Äôs base has long believed that compromise with Dems is heresy. While their ranks were decimated, too, they may argue Baker‚Äôs defeat shows there‚Äôs no safe harbor in moderation...
As we discuss on this week‚Äôs episode, the outcome in #AD16 (and we didn‚Äôt know the final tally, but anticipated it) may strike a mighty blow against CA Republicans who will ask their party to take a more pragmatic stance. After all, if Baker loses...  https://t.co/LLuzhClwPG

More than most elections I've covered, the early returns tonight seem very much in rural, GOP parts of California. Plumas, Lassen, Kings counties all in early. Translation: Not where most CA voters live.
Governor's race: Outside of Republican voters, AP VoteCast found the only close contest between Newsom and Cox in subsets of CA voters was older, white independent voters. In virtually every other subset, it's Newsom outside the survey's MOE.
A race worth watching tonight as returns come in. Still early, but this one has been among the most bitter in CA this cycle. https://t.co/eQLoNohWI2
@madrid_mike The data doesn't quite get to my magic question from that recent story...
In U.S. Senate race, AP VoteCast survey found Feinstein winning +25 with male voters over De Leon, +30 with women. She also looks to have bested her fellow Democrat among young voters and Latinos.
Interesting stat from AP VoteCast's election day survey: In governor's race, Newsom and Cox were almost tied among voters who said Trump was not a factor i their decision. Among those who said Trump was part of the equation, it was 69-27 Newsom.
AP VoteCast data: 68% of California's urban voters picked Newsom, 60% of suburban voters did the same. Small town and rural voters also favored the Dem, though survey's sample size is smaller there.
In early AP VoteCast data -- replacing exit polling -- there's almost no category for which John Cox came even close to Gavin Newsom in voters.		Newsom was the preferred choice of about two-thirds of women, voters under 65, college graduates. And 60% of self-described moderates.
Reminder: first vote tallies we'll get in CA on this #ElectionNight are from absentee ballots counted prior to today. Never certain whether early votes trend differently in key races than last minute deciders, so grains of salt until we get closer to 9pm PST.

An FYI for those in California -- lots of LA folks -- reporting broken ballot readers at polling places. This does NOT slow down the counting of votes, which only happens back at elex HQ tonight.		The machine at polling places is to help catch blank or incorrectly voted ballots.
Here's a pretty mind-blowing stat, based on last CA voter registration report and @Political_Data info: Some 78% of registered California voters were sent a ballot in the mail for this #ElectionDay.
So when you see reports tomorrow that millions of CA ballots remain uncounted, it would be wrong to call that a failure of the system as it exists. Could it be done better? Probably, and that's a good discussion for #CALeg. But long count is, for now, the CA system we have. -30-
No state has as many voters as California. Most states don't have as many voters as LA County or Orange County. Add in our pro-voting laws and a lot of paper ballots (the state moved decidedly away from wide use of touchscreens in 2006) and you get... a long count. /5
It's hard to overstate the impact of how 2 things have collided in California elections: the push for greater access/registration along with the push for more absentee balloting. Paper ballots have been around since the Civil War, and counting -- and verifying -- takes time. /4
I attempted to lay out the many mandates in June: https://t.co/p3nBfyUYI2		Today, we have a new one: same-day registration, called "conditional voter reg" for folks who go to county elex HQ. Those voters will cast provisional ballots, counted once eligibility is confirmed... /3
From there, and notwithstanding any serious anomalies that might arise, it's NOT an error or a surprise that we're in store for a long count. Like it or not, this is exactly how the system must work as local elections officials implement #CALeg mandates. And there are a bunch. /2
An #ElectionDay thread for my journo/pundit friends on the other coast when it comes to counting California votes in the days to come.		First, if nothing else... don't call these "recounts." A recount only happens only narrow circumstances, and not in these early hours. C'mon. /1

As PPIC event with U.S. Senate candidates ends, hard to see any moment/topic changing the race -- definitely what Feinstein wanted. KDL will need to flame the "why won't she do more of these?" fire... plus work to showcase some of her answers as being too tempered for the times.
@scottlay Perhaps, but did you see Feinstein debate Mountjoy or Emken? Nope.
Feinstein's reply: Republicans have "a lock on power" in DC... "extraordinary difficult" for Dems, she replies. "You don't really have an opportunity... sure, you can protest." (Of course, CA's junior senator has plotted a course more similar to one espoused by KDL.) https://t.co/5S8Mtw5szs
And here's De Le√≥n's strongest line of the event: "That lack of courage, always backpedaling.." calling out Dems in Congress largely, DiFi without saying her name...
This PPIC event with Feinstein and De Le√≥n is now at the 2 minute warning in the 4th quarter. KDL is rapidly approaching a moment where the Hail Mary may look tantalizing...
This is the the KDL topic he's tried to hint at earlier in PPIC event... Feinstein's support for Iraq war. https://t.co/enDMJXVvM4
Feinstein's explicit comment in this PPIC event opposing the Delta tunnels project as it exists (maybe one tunnel, she says) is notable should she prevail next month. Her close relationship with Newsom, if he wins, could influence future of this Brown legacy project...
"Washington always seems to find the money for its priorities," says De Le√≥n in what ended up being a succinct critique of the congressional process. But because the format doesn't seem to require a response from Feinstein, the senator doesn't have to explain the DC environment.
An atmospheric observation from this Senate conversation: perhaps it's the setting of a small room and the comfortable chairs, but even the candidates' voices seem subdued. That's to Feinstein's advantage, I think.
This tweet from KDL staff is a pretty good jab back... and yet, the candidate didn't say this during the PPIC event. If he had said it, it could've helped his assertion that DiFi is out of touch with what's happening in CA. In short: a missed opportunity. https://t.co/vnJqmR0nYL
@RelentlessYapp I think you'd have to add to that list:	Senate 2006: Feinstein-Mountjoy	Senate 2012: Feinstein-Emken
Once again in PPIC event, De Le√≥n offers a subtle poke at Feinstein's immigration record. Clearly he wants some contrast, but there's nothing here that will be a sound bite on TV or social media...

Feinstein's answer on a broad #MeToo question, which included Kavanaugh, offers a glimpse into the senatorial style that either keeps her above the fray or comes off to liberal activists as too mild.

In the end, the odds of the event making a significant impact on this Senate race seem long. But as we've seen so many times, a key moment -- a surprise, a gaffe, etc. -- can fuel a viral media shift in politics.		Either way, we'll have our answers soon.	-30-
One sleeper issue: water. The two Dems seemed on opposite sides of the Mojave water project pushed by Cadiz, Inc. Feinstein wanted state officials to push back against the Cadiz effort, but the idea fizzled in the Legislature while KDL was Senate leader.
It will be especially interesting to see how many of the comments/quips are about Trump. And there's potential for flashpoints about immigration... KDL could always point out Feinstein's hardliner past on the issue.
Feinstein seems to need largely not to stumble, to do nothing that generates a headline that could shift the dynamics of the campaign. In other words, keeping De Le√≥n from having any opening.
For De Le√≥n, this event seems to present super tricky dynamics. He has to make a splash, but coming out too aggressive could come across as too aggressive. It's especially dicey given they're both Dems with similarities on several issues.
It's also striking that it was a SF "conversation" earlier this year with Feinstein which De Le√≥n has said was final straw in deciding to challenge his fellow Dem, the event in which DiFi said Trump "can be a good president." It was senatorial &amp; pragmatic, but sparked Dem anger.
This is Feinstein's first debate-ish event against a challenger since 2000. Over the past two reelections, she's declined to debate GOP challengers. In this case, she declined primary debate.		She has deep experience in congressional performances, but this could be different...
@DianneFeinstein @kdeleon For starters, a noontime event on a Wednesday means most voters will glimpse this moment through news reports and social media. Not that dissimilar (except for social media) from Gray Davis demanding a midday/midweek debate in 2002 against Bill Simon. Power of the incumbent.
Just about 90 minutes from start of the conversation/forum/sort-of-debate between @DianneFeinstein and @kdeleon in San Francisco. Expected to be the only face/face meeting between the two candidates for U.S. Senate. So, what's at stake and what to expect? A few thoughts...

This day.
Certainly looks like we're in store for a Q&amp;A session unlike any we've ever seen in a congressional hearing.
"Your words have meaning," Kavanaugh says to Senate Democrats. Worth noting the same kind of comments are made about words often said by the judge's presidential champion.
"A national disgrace"... "search and destroy." Kavanaugh makes it clear he's not coming in to this event with some white-hot anger.
Yet another Northern California connection to today's historic hearing emerged today: Safeway, headquartered in Pleasanton, might have some records of part-time employees at its store in Potomac, MD, no?
Certainly some will say moving Kavanaugh to Friday morning would've made it a two-day story. Well, it's a two-day story and then some already. I suspect more folks will end up seeing Ford in her own words and Kavanaugh in TV sound bites. That might not be insignificant. -30-
With all the social media observation of just how many Americans have stopped their mornings to watch Senate hearing, I'm wondering whether the decision to do it all in one day means fewer will see Kavanaugh. Can't be many folks who sneak this into an entire workday...
With this historic moment playing in Washington, don't think for a moment that there aren't at least a dozen California candidates for the U.S. House watching closely. Last night's @PPICNotes poll: 74% of likely CA voters say Supreme Court choice is "very important" to them.

The big debate over wildfire prevention ends with a variety of bills headed to ‚Å¶@JerryBrownGov‚Å© with the marquee effort controversial to the end. My wrap for #CALeg #EndofSession  https://t.co/Jo35bgFVV5
"We are adjourned," says @SenHannahBeth as she gavels down the Senate for #EndOfSession. 11:49pm.
A quick, impromptu appearance by @JerryBrownGov on the Assembly floor as #EndOfSession winds down. Speaker Rendon says he told Brown, "16 years is a long time" as governor.		Brown's reply, per Rendon: "Yeah, it proves that term limits are bullshit."
#CALeg now: Assembly approves #SB901 wildfire prevention conference report, providing $1B in funding for fire prevention while also giving relief to utilities facing  major fire costs. Final vote 45-10. Goes to @JerryBrownGov.
"One major fire offsets almost everything this state does when we go to reduce carbon emissions on a yearly basis," says Assemblyman @JimWoodAD2 in support of #SB901 wildfire conference plan.
"You‚Äôre going to burn if we don‚Äôt do something fast," says Assembly GOP Leader @BrianDahleCA as he holds up fire projection map showing danger across CA, part of an intense debate over #SB901 wildfire conference cmte plan.
#SB901, the big fire prevention bill, now is in the Assembly for #EndofSession floor debate. Few bills are as full of complex, separate ideas as this conference report.
#SB901, wide-ranging wildfire prevention/utility fire relief proposal, passes CA Senate on bipartisan vote of 29-4. Now to the Assembly. #EndOfSession
As Senate hears marquee wildfire response bill, #SB901, it's quite possible the image of not passing the bill -- perceived by some as doing nothing -- will eclipse some of the controversial details. Of course, many other fire bills have gained traction this week. #EndofSession
The big #SB901 debate in the Senate gets to exactly the thing that's been at center of the wildfire prevention debate: PG&amp;E.		"Why are we rushing to bail out PG&amp;E with its history of cutting safety as a business decision?" asks Senator Jerry Hill.

Debate on #SB1437, abolishing "felony murder" rule, offers good glimpse at spectrum of Assembly Dems. @LorenaSGonzalez calls it "unjust" and says unfair to those "less culpable"; @AsmJimCooper calls accomplice actions "high risk behavior" and says needs to be "accountability"
Assembly now taking up in #EndOfSession evening floor debate, #SB1437 to abolish CA's "felony murder" rule. Existing law can result in life sentence for those who are accomplice -- but not killer -- in crime that results in murder.

Dahle suggests 2017 costs paid out of a utility-contributed fund, all new costs to be guided by PUC deciding what portion of costs for which utility should be liable..
Much discussed split between Senate and Assembly on details of #CALeg wildfire prevention plan comes to light in early hearing comments. After @AnthonyCannella says "Senate has come to an agreement," @ChrisHoldenNews replies, "We look forward to you meeting us on our side."
So... here's the proposed bill language, just released by #CALeg wildfire conference committee... https://t.co/SthaKbSiMU https://t.co/hziJkPnKy2
@SenBillDodd sums up a huge issue -- how much utilities' bottom line will be helped by #CALeg conference cmte. He says it's not avoidable. "I think this is an important premise that we‚Äôre all going to have to grapple with," Dodd said.
As #CALeg wildfire conference committee begins, co-chair @ChrisHoldenNews says "Many of us are still making our way through" the bill language... and thus it's still "a work in progress."
Worth noting that the #CALeg wildfire conference committee met on Friday to reveal a "term sheet" of general concepts -- utility costs, vegetation management -- but even after marathon weekend work/talks, still no bill language made public.

1,306 vote lead for Democrat Vanessa Delgado over Republican Rita Topalian in #SD32 special elex runoff returns.  A close shave in a +27 D state Senate district...
Looks like 1,942 vote lead, to be precise. Worth reminding everyone that #SD32 was home to bizarre June election result -- same candidates running for final months of current term and a new 4yr term, but ballot order was different... and different Dems advanced in both races. https://t.co/sxmdFBOsuy

@vosdscott  https://t.co/bHtNld7bC8
@vosdscott They also have a pretty sizable reliance on touchscreen machines. (My point isn't to quibble with the 3 weeks, just that suggestion that OH is better at elections than CA would be a comparison based on, well, apples and oranges.)
Apples/Oranges. Ohio historically has less absentee balloting than California. California allows ballots to arrive after election day. CA law offers robust access to provisional ballot if confusion at polls. And OH12 ballots cast so far less than total in 10 CA counties in June. https://t.co/eZVtR8oRqx
@GwilymMcGrew Schiff‚Äôs tweet pivots to a defense of environmental laws, which is broader than water policy ‚Äî which was the main point of the president‚Äôs tweet. Still no nexus with water decisions. Broader enviro rules? Sure, that‚Äôs a fair debate.

One other thought (and I really will go back into vacation mode): Draper chose to write his measure as statute and not a constitutional amendment. That may still not have been enough, but a carving up of CA by simple law was itself a gamble. -30-
This part of Draper‚Äôs response to the delay of his ‚Äú3 Californias‚Äù (and let‚Äôs be clear, the CA SupCt didn‚Äôt weigh in on the merits, just said time needed to consider) is pretty acerbic. Corruption? So the state‚Äôs high court is corrupt? https://t.co/VPsKnY0Riz
Also interesting: Draper complained that enviros waited until late to challenge. But his state-split didn‚Äôt qualify for ballot until June 12, legal action filed on July 9. Given his earlier six-state effort had too many invalid sigs, one could be forgiven if unsure he‚Äôd qualify.

@FaithCSacto Let the debate begin on more disclosure! ü§î
@FaithCSacto I think there‚Äôs also a problem with the lack of transparency. Any agreement on behalf of the public, whether local or state, should be subject to more consistent disclosure before the deal is done. Makes things harder, but stakes are higher when it comes to public good.
@FaithCSacto That‚Äôs a good piece of insight. But the public lamenting of electeds suggested this was all someone else‚Äôs fault. It felt very much like the old days of budget deals.
@mimizhusband Well, it hasn‚Äôt been on the ballot ‚Äî the issue of farm animal confinement ‚Äî since 2008.
One final note. There was rampant rumor around Capitol in final days that legislators could pass statute to remove a proposition from the ballot even after it was certified. That seems a misread of CA Constitution, but possibly gave false sense that 6/28 was flexible. -30-
So as legislators decried the take-it-or-leave it nature of the final week, the better question may be: why wait so late to talk to privacy activists, soda and paint companies? Sure, might not have helped. But the lack of action seems important fact checking of #CALeg angst. /3

@alonh18 There are organizations suggesting more election reforms, but I don't know of anyone calling for the elimination of the initiative system.
@alonh18 It's a good question, but I don't think there's any easy answer. Again, polling suggests there are a lot of Californians who don't trust legislators as much as they trust themselves through ballot initiatives.
@blondealex @Head_sherpa They haven't been numbered yet (likely they'll begin with Prop 73). First three are legislatively referred, the other nine earned a spot from backers gathering voter signatures.
@alonh18 Depends on your stance, but the direct democracy system has been in place for 107 years and remains popular in public polling. Voters say they like being the ultimate arbiter. (And it's not a "referendum" in CA to write laws; that term refers to specific measure to repeal a law.)

Also from Alito's #Janus opinion: "Individual nonmembers could be required to pay for that service or could be denied union representation altogether. Thus, agency	fees cannot be sustained on the ground that unions would	otherwise be unwilling to represent nonmembers."
Justice Alito writes for the majority in #Janus, offers this analogy in his objection to agency fees, paid by non-union members. https://t.co/wRutj0Vrlc
And as expected, SCOTUS reverse the lower court in #Janus and strikes down agency fees. Big news for public sector unions, some of California's most powerful political players.

Thanks. And no, I've become an ink-stained wretch. If that still holds in online-first journalism circa 2018.		Update of this story coming soon, with much more on #SB54 debate in the courtroom. https://t.co/goSvJpjjpB
Federal court hearing on constitutionality of California‚Äôs three sanctuary immigration laws has ended. Judge seemed to have many more Qs and pokes at feds on #SB54 than the state. By contrast, he took state to task on #AB450. No ruling today, so stay tuned...
My first take on federal court action in Sacramento. https://t.co/9S5eTTdc6M
At the break, focus was on #AB450, law limiting immigration visits to workplaces.		Trump admin attorney (Readler) said intent of law was to give ‚Äúnotice‚Äù to workers who might not have legal status.  Judge called that view ‚Äúcynical.‚Äù		#SB54, the key sanctuary law, still to come...
He‚Äôs sounded skeptical of any ‚Äúburden‚Äù on feds in allowing state to access these immigration detention centers. But he also suggested portions of the law ‚Äî governing access to records ‚Äî could easily be nixed while still allowing physical access by state officials.
So we‚Äôre at lunch break of what could be all-day federal court hearing on CA‚Äôs three sanctuary immigration laws.		In short, judge has mostly focused on AB103, law allowing inspections at detention.
Today marks the first big court showdown between Trump administration and California over a trio of sanctuary inspired immigration laws: limits on local law enforcement help,	limits on access to workplaces, state inspections of detention centers. Court hearing begins at 10am. https://t.co/6WESljAYqG

@scottlay Other U.S. states wouldn't have to consent, at least not in interpretations I've read of Article IV, Section 3. It's only Congress and our own legislature -- which may/may not be met by voters acting as legislators thru the initiative process.		But yeah, other hurdles are huge.
@ericpbates @jimothy63 @Trover2 It's a good question, and one over which legal experts will likely quarrel. California is unique in its delegation of legislative powers to voters; but a strict reading of the U.S. Constitution may see that as not enough when it comes to carving up existing state borders.
@GK_Austin Perhaps not, and yet another reason the plan would be hard to sell in Congress. Congressional approval is required.

Biggest news of the #CaBudget deal, $500 million for homeless services, gets less than 3 minutes of discussion. Almost 11pm on a Friday night.
@lancelands There were plenty of deals cut by the GOP leaders themselves in the old days. I was there, camped outside of the horseshoe. Both parties failed the transparency test routinely back then.
So yes, transparency for the final deal is thin. And yes, Capitol community and press scrambling tonight to figure out what‚Äôs in budget. But it‚Äôs been going on a long time, and not a new challenge to #CALeg most important job. -30-
On Republican side, lamenting lack of public transparency for final deal fails to recognize all the years in which GOP also huddled in private, back when their votes were needed for budget. GOP leaders routinely used to not comment on the deal back then.. /3
On Democratic side, there was insistence that private negotiations that took place were just ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù of public subcommittee meetings. But key element of deal ‚Äî $500M for homeless programs ‚Äî could‚Äôve benefited from debate on how that number was picked, cost/benefit, etc /2
Having listened to #CaBudget conference committee while driving back from the coast, have to say there was some spin from members on both sides as they attempted to explain this year‚Äôs process... /1

A notable dedication: @JerryBrownGov includes an homage to his late chief of staff, Nancy McFadden, on the inside cover of his revised #CABudget. https://t.co/ND84vee0MX
So when we talk about #CABudget windfall, it's important to get some context. Unexpected cash, per @JerryBrownGov's revised plan, is about $9B. Once you account for some spending mandates that triggers, the net windfall is closer to $8B. Still, that's a huge pile of cash.
Pull open Gov. Brown's $312 million boost for mental health services and it doesn't look quite as robust: $254 million is a repayment to counties for obligations from 2004-11 on youth and mental illness.
Our first take: @JerryBrownGov offers part of a historic #CAbudget bonanza to help ease California's homelessness crisis https://t.co/9XgB6sDIqe

Still, no one expects Brown to give up the ghost on viewing the big tax collections as a short-term and not ongoing phenomenon.		This is his final budget blueprint -- his 16th "May Revise." He may be the first governor in a long time to not leave his predecessor w/a deficit. -30-
@JerryBrownGov Then there's the insistence by #CALeg Democrats that the budget do better in funding social services, most notably a boost to CalWORKS grants that remain at pre-recession levels and thus have lost a lot of purchasing power due to inflation.
@JerryBrownGov A key item to watch is whether he adds a noticeable boost to the state's efforts on homelessness. Brown has been lobbied by legislators and city mayors alike to do more.
Coming up in about an hour: @JerryBrownGov unveils his revised #CAbudget, the last spending proposal of his time in office. No question looms larger than what he proposes to do with some $3B in unexpected tax revenue.

Fascinating that John Cox keeps talking all about "all these politicians" on the stage. Reality: He's run for office several times in the past when he lived in Illinois.
Democrat John Chiang threw out a white-hot accusation about one immigration case when Gavin Newsom was mayor of San Francisco.  He did so twice, and Newsom wouldn't bite.  It's quite clear he doesn't want to give Chiang any oxygen -- on this or any other issue.
Travis Allen just promised to call a special election if he's elected to repeal California's sanctuary law. Reality: That would take Democrats in the Legislature to go along.

@michaelnorth @LizMair How on earth was 2010 a bad year for Democrats in California? They won every single statewide office, they held all of their congressional seats and continued their dominance in the CA Legislature.
As I said on this week's podcast, a CAGOP gubernatorial candidate needs to be as good as NASA in the Apollo 13 "slingshot" effect... using gravity of the base as some kind of momentum. I can't figure out how that would work, as top-2 hasn't changed the political physics. -30-
And if biggest share of #CAGOP votes in a top-two is still clustered around the conservative base, then winning the nomination (pre-top2) or making second spot (now) still leaves the candidate in a November pickle -- the stance of party's base remains a general elex liability /7
One could argue that either would've been positioned to seek out centrist CA electorate if top-two had existed. But it's also unclear that conservative base would have come along for the ride. And ultimately, wouldn't one of them have done the math and still run to the right? /6
Poizner had tried to be a moderate R in a Bay Area race in the Assembly in '04 and in '10 found himself trying to explain former $$ for Al Gore.		So the 2 leading Republicans had, it seemed, a conservative base problem, and knew how the party base felt about Schwarzenegger. /5
It was obvious to most who watched that race that neither Whitman nor Poizner came into the contest with super-strong conservative cred. Whitman seemed ideologically similar to her friend Chris Christie (back when he was more purple in his NJ politics than die-hard R red) /4
Brown received just over 2 million votes. Whitman received almost 1.53 million, Poizner had almost 633K.		It's hard to see Brown not coming in first even under a top-two, so then the Q would have been... Whitman or Poizner? /3
In June 8, 2010 primary, there were 4,857,463 votes cast in the race for governor. (Note: That's compared to more than 16.9 million registered voters. So... awfully anemic interest in the state's top race). Three candidates received lion's share of those voters... /2
Some recent #CAGOP lamenting that top-two primary has further weakened the party leads me to wonder: what would 2010 gubernatorial have been like under top-2?		There's no sure answer, but it's interesting to look at the candidates, the votes, and the tenor of that primary. /1

No. No candidate cleared the hurdles to be considered. https://t.co/RuwEuqnFzC
Allen and Villaraigosa may be the most interesting candidates to watch on Tuesday night‚Äôs debate stage. Chiang and Eastin either must throw a Hail Mary or acknowledge the race is slipping away. Newsom and Cox likely wanna stay above fray.
The Republican with the most challenging job in Tuesday‚Äôs debate is prob Allen. He‚Äôd like to just jab the Dems all night, but he‚Äôs going to have to go after Cox to appeal to Reeps ‚Äî the kind of infighting that could help Dems.
There‚Äôs some truth in spin from both Allen and Cox in #CAGOP not making endorsement. Allen needed a boost in a campaign where he‚Äôs hugely outspent. But Cox clearly now must contend with ‚Äúdivided party‚Äù narrative in final weeks. In short: the underdogs aren‚Äôt going to be unified.

@Pete4CA @CASOSvote @PewStates It‚Äôs a good Q, and one that definitely merits some attention. But just so we‚Äôre all clear, the original tweet said Democrats are dominant because of faulty or fraudulent voter rolls ‚Äî an assertion without any factual basis.		Cheers.

Thanks. Important to remember there are indeed mistakes made in elections. Poorly trained poll workers. Incorrect ballot materials and instructions to voters. Registration confusion that forces voters to cast a provisional ballot. But those are not systemic fraud. Context is key. https://t.co/ABFQC1iM4w

Commissioners who are revamping the operations and control of the state's political watchdog agency had wanted to give final approval to their plan at a meeting either on election day, or the day before -- busy times for the campaign watchdog staff. Looks like that won't happen.
And as they discuss when to reconvene to formalize the new operations structure, 2 members of the state's political watchdog agency huddle with quiet conversation -- out of earshot of the public.
And while the meeting of California's campaign watchdog panel is still going, a commissioner looks up and says, "Well, I need to run." And she leaves.
And so California's political watchdog agency votes to begin a change in operations of the agency under a document 2 commissioners crafted at lunchtime... but to be revised in a way that will "carry out the intent" of their draft document. 3-2 vote.
Commissioners seeking to change the structure of FPPC operations are saying the proposed 2-person committees aren't required to be run with an eye toward CA's Bagley-Keene open meeting law.
@firstklassriot Unclear. Stay tuned.
They'll vote on the draft idea to reorganize the agency's operations "subject to word-smithing," says one commissioner. (If you're not sure what that practically means, you're not alone.)

@FightingChase @IanCalderon @jazmineulloa I appreciate your position, and urge you to contact me or others in my bureau with details when appropriate. My interest in engaging in this convo was simply to make sure we're all coming to the table with accurate information abt the law. Impacts of laws are impt stories. Thx.
@FightingChase @IanCalderon @jazmineulloa I don't doubt the severity of the crimes. My point is CA has never designated those crimes as "violent," and Prop57 didn't change that. If you want to expand the list of 23 violent crimes in the penal code (which was focus of my column), that's a reasonable debate I'd cover.
@FightingChase @IanCalderon @jazmineulloa That's misleading. Prop 57 did not "change" these crimes to anything, it simply gave new discretion to the CA Board of Parole Hearings on crimes not defined as "violent." Those aren't the same things in CA law.. https://t.co/753YiFJLsP
@AlexPLemieux @jazmineulloa I've read it, and the bill that created it. And yes, it's a good topic for us to think about for future coverage. But a law to possible erase a conviction seems a bit tangential to whether a different law -- SB 54 -- is endangering Californians.

So...the new Trump accusation of massive CA voter fraud.		"Millions and millions of people," he said. "And it's very hard, because the state guards their records, they don't wanna see it."		He's talking about records easily available to campaigns, press, others...not hidden. /1
CA Dept. of Water Resources officials say the level at Lake Oroville is now ~37 feet away from releasing water down the repaired spillway which failed last year. No doubt a lot of folks will be closely watching this new batch of NorCal storms.

@mlow29 @rpyers You should take a close look at SUSA's methodology. Not everyone thinks they started with the right sample.
@rpyers @CAGOP I don‚Äôt think they have a month. VBM begins the very next week; if the convention was earlier, I‚Äôd be more willing to see a potential bounce. As it is, I‚Äôm a bit skeptical.
In closing, the path ahead is challenging for these Republican Senate hopefuls. Not impossible, but California is a tough state to mount an insurgent campaign. Voters aren‚Äôt required to fill in an oval in this race. They‚Äôll need to be persuaded.		It‚Äôll be fun to watch. üó≥	-30-
On the Democratic side, De Le√≥n will need big anti-Trump turnout and then a reasonable slice of the Dem electorate, hoping the many Rs end up splitting their % of the electorate... or that R voters simply skip that race.  Alison Hartson, another insurgent Dem, could thwart that.
Some of the GOP candidates for Senate have sought office before. But getting into double-digital support probably means some kind of institutional support. CAGOP has a process this year to endorse at its May convention, but VBM ballots start going out the next day.
In most recent statewide primaries, there have been generally about 5M voters that have showed up.		All reasonable analyses suggest Feinstein comes in first. Absent resources for advertising and GOTV, how do one of the Republicans break through?		A key issue...turnout.
In the last non-presidential year Senate election, the top Republican (Carly Fiorina) got 1.3M votes. That was pre-top2, but still second most votes cast.		In 2012 (top2), Emken won 613K votes to come in second.  In both cases, there was money spent ‚Äî a lot, in Fiorina‚Äôs effort.
The field:	&gt; Arum Buhumitra	&gt; James Bradley	&gt; John ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Crew	&gt; Erin Cruz	&gt; Roque ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù De La Fuente	&gt; Jerry Joseph Laws	&gt; Patrick Little	&gt; Kevin Mottus	&gt; Mario Nabliba	&gt; Tom Palzer	&gt; Paul Taylor		The key Q: Can any of these hopefuls attract enough R votes in June?
Now that @CASOSvote has certified list of candidates for all CA races in June 5 primary, let‚Äôs look at U.S. Senate race‚Äôs Republican field.		So, 11 GOP candidates. Can any of them make the top 2 and advance to November?

@DEANintheYAY @PPICnotes Yep. It only struck me this week that the CAGOP convention is May 4-6 and that ballots start to get mailed the following day. The party's move to endorsing in statewide races might be muted if they pick someone in the Senate race...
@WTPDavid @CAPoliticsPCast I think the poll is a reflection of how voters react to someone they've heard of. Yes, there's value in polling entire ballot (and that prob works better in an online list and not by phone call), and the question is whether any of the 12 R's could draw 15%. That's a tough task.
@Myrnastwit @CAPoliticsPCast Links/URLs? If you're going to make grand accusations, I think the social media world should see your evidence of  "corporate media pushing"...
Haven't talked about U.S. Senate from tonight's @PPICnotes poll, but nothing more interesting to me than 71% of Republicans don't know what to do. No GOP candidate with name ID decided to run. CAGOP can endorse unknown wannabe at party confab, but event is close to VBM kickoff..
As @CAPoliticsPCast listeners might guess, this poll on the governor's race is one I'd like to mull for Friday's episode. Ping the podcast Twitter handle with your own thoughts on it!
@JustCameron__ @PPICnotes Hard to say, and I think it's going to really vary by CD/AD/SD. I think in battleground CDs, the more die-hard conservatives show up, the better for Republicans. But I also think those races could end up as much about Trump as the top of the tik in California.
@DieGo2SHAE @JustCameron__ @PPICnotes https://t.co/GSqHfRNv0C
@JustCameron__ @PPICnotes Given 31% of self-described conservatives say they're undecided, I don't think it's easy to read that tea leaf. And, of course, conservative on what kinds of issues? I view those results more as an atmospheric for the poll than something you can really hold on to.
@hall_cb 4.5% for likely voters, which of course should be taken into account like all polls.
Another @PPICnotes crosstab that I find interesting: governor's race candidates by education and income. Villaraigosa strong with HS-only, more than 4-1 underdog to Newsom among most wealthy. Cox bests Allen with mid-income voters. https://t.co/PKHOesVU0k
The new statewide poll looks to be troubling for the gubernatorial hopes of state Treasurer John Chiang. In January, PPIC had him at 9% of likely voters. Tonight: 6%. Steeper drop among Democrats, LA voters.
Undecideds in tonight's @PPICnotes governor's race poll:		Conservatives: 31%	Republicans: 30%	Orange Co./San Diego: 31%	Unaffiliated voters: 26%	Democrats: 17%	Liberals: 15%	Latinos: 15%
@mlow29 @PPICnotes You would have to then assume a Republican in the top-two vastly outpaced the party's share of the registered electorate and convinced a sizable number of NPPs to come along. That also seems to assume a not-so-high liberal turnout, which I think is tough to imagine.
Check out the crosstab glimpse of voter subsets in tonight's @PPICnotes governor's race poll. Striking from my view is that Newsom is +17 with moderates over Villaraigosa. For a candidate who's embraced a panopoly of liberal policy ideas to be doing that well is fascinating. https://t.co/q5CiaWBoTI
@cruickshank I don't know there's any way to say for sure until we see what Villaraigosa camp has in store for the next 6-8 wks. It's definitely an uphill battle, but (to your point about the fall) it's perhaps the largest X factor in this race. GOP candidate would have huge hurdles for Nov.
@PPICnotes Villaraigosa supporters will prob say January PPIC poll (he was no.2), which told respondents of his past job, is more realistic. Newsom supporters will say this one, ballot titles only, is more legit. Bottom line: The former LA mayor must make sure non-LA folks know his story...
Tonight's @PPICnotes poll in the race for governor differs from the organization's January poll mostly in framing of "here are the candidates." With no mention of Villaraigosa's mayoral past, he gets edged out by Cox. But if AV can remind voters of his LA cred, would he move up? https://t.co/TBrejpGm9q
