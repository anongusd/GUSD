RT @TSA_Pekoske: Thanks to everyone who attended today’s #StateofTSA address. It was a pleasure to speak with so many industry partners, st…
"A commitment to our people, to me, means making the investment so that they have the tools and the training to do the job we are asking them to do." #StateofTSA
"We have tremendous men and women, who are on the front lines and doing the mission every day." #StateofTSA
TSA Administrator David Pekoske is discussing travel security, innovations and the TSA workforce with Frank Cilluffo, Director for Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, as part of today's #StateofTSA address. https://t.co/LqQEB4VSui
"By acknowledging everyone’s role in our shared security mission.  Together we will adopt and embrace a new creed: Not on Our Watch." #StateofTSA https://t.co/Bkf3YSl5sQ
"Securing our nation’s transportation system is a complex task and government cannot do it alone. Transportation security is a collective effort and all of us have a role to play." #StateofTSA
"Third, we will invest so that we can attract, hire, train, develop, retain our workforce to make TSA an employer of choice. Everyone who is a part of TSA will reflect our values… integrity, respect, and commitment… each and every day in their service to America. " #StateofTSA
"Second, we recommit ourselves to that entrepreneurial spirit. We are looking at everything we do with an eye towards innovation." #StateofTSA https://t.co/Y0fhZllRaM
"The first is to support and strengthen frontline operations and improve performance in our core security operations." #StateofTSA
"Our Strategy, which will guide TSA through our 25th anniversary in 2026, identifies three key priorities that are most critical to our continued success." #StateofTSA
"We must engage, inform and empower the public to see themselves as part of the security solution and as recipients of a secure system. It takes all of us to secure the homeland." #StateofTSA
"For TSA to continue to succeed in our mission, we must not only focus on addressing the threat where it is today, but also on our capabilities for the future." #StateofTSA
"We face ambitious adversaries who are continuously looking for a point of attack and waiting for their opportunity. Our job is to make sure they never have that opportunity." #StateofTSA
"Aviation and surface transportation hubs remain highly prized targets for terrorists. Their modes and methods of attack have evolved and become much more decentralized and opportunistic than ever before." #StateofTSA
In the years since 9/11, we have been successful in our fundamental and vital mission, but we must remain ever-vigilant. #StateofTSA https://t.co/1AQ8lr90Sx
"Since coming to TSA I have been inspired by the dedication of TSA’s workforce to the mission … and to each other." #StateofTSA
"Airports are critical to both the response and recovery of a community following a disaster. TSA, CBP, airports, airlines and local authorities worked side-by-side to ensure flight operations could resume as soon as possible." #StateofTSA
"2017 was an extremely busy year at TSA. We rolled out innovative security technologies, continued to expand our Precheck partnerships, and we took measures to raise the baseline of global aviation security." #StateofTSA
