Ocasio-Cortez's office disavowed and replaced the initial summary and removed it from their website.
Rather, the mention of airplanes came in an initial FAQ of the resolution, which said they ‚Äúset a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.‚Äù
The airplane issue is not mentioned in the final text of the Green New Deal resolution, which has a big focus on overhauling the transportation system to reduce air pollution, including a push for more high speech rail.
@SteveScalise tweaks @AOC for an initial Green New Deal reference to eliminating airplanes. "She thinks it's immoral to have fossil fuels or fly around on airplanes, yet she flies around on airplanes. I don't think it's immoral, but if I thought it was immoral, I wouldn't do it."

As for movement‚Äôs potential impact on midterms, Rubio noted millions of voters hold different views and they‚Äôll be voting as well. But added: ‚ÄúBetween now and November, there could be another shooting, so we shouldn‚Äôt wait ‚Äòtil November to act‚Äù and urged red flag laws
Rubio argued the best way to stop a shooter is to take preventative action against potentially dangerous ppl, even if that means ‚Äúremoving guns from them before they can do anything, all of their guns, not just their rifles, everything. That‚Äôs what works best.‚Äù (red flag laws)
Rubio repeatedly pointed to his red flag bill, saying since the measure was adopted in Florida, ‚Äúthree dangerous people have had their guns taken from them after due process. And who knows what it‚Äôs prevented as a result of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúI support the Second Amendment and they‚Äôre one of the groups that support the Second Amendment, so I would expect that they would be supportive of people that support the Second Amendment,‚Äù he said.
Rubio he hadn‚Äôt seen the price tags from the rally but described the protest symbols as ‚Äúpolitical speech‚Äù that citizens have a right to make. Asked if the recent shooting and the ensuing student-led movement had caused him to re-analyze the NRA, Rubio said ‚Äúno.‚Äù
Rubio: ‚ÄúAttacks are just part of politics...I‚Äôm not worried about me. I do worry there are people out there who have views and decided not to get engaged in politics or speak out because we want to shout them down. And both sides do that. That‚Äôs not good.‚Äù https://t.co/scvCrWEqUo
