Today, before we set off fireworks and raise glass after glass to the freedom our ancestors earned with their blood, think about whether our current government has committed itself to the securement of the liberties the Founders sought to codify.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men...That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government‚Äù
Thomas Jefferson explains it best: 		‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
242 years ago, our Founders signed the Declaration of Independence, severing the colonies‚Äô ties to the English Empire and setting us on the path to freedom. We rejected King George III‚Äôs‚Äúdivine‚Äù rule in favor of a republic in which all citizens would be equals.
