#TARP is a program that has now spanned three administrations. While the actions taken were deeply unpopular at the time, the effects of those actions were critical to providing the stability needed to avoid a depression and save millions of jobs.
Following #TARP, #NewDems helped lead the efforts to modernize and reform our financial regulatory system in the months and years that followed #DoddFrank. #DoddFrank made critical reforms that helps prevent the need for another bailout.
While $700 billion was authorized through #TARP, only $450 billion has been obligated to date https://t.co/P6DF4rs7xW. Of the $422 billion provided to support financial institutions and the auto industry, Treasury recovered $442 billion‚Ä¶basically a $20 billion profit.
Faced with a growing financial panic, a Democratic-led Congress and a Republican president worked together to take decisive action in an attempt to prevent another great depression.

The latter priorities require a multilateral approach that the Trump administration has continued to undermine. Trade should be about setting strong standards, not about bargaining like you are at a flea market.

Specifically, #NewDems called on the Ways and Means, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs Committees to immediately hold a series of hearings on the potential impacts of @POTUS' proposed steel and aluminum tariffs.
#NewDem Trade Task Force Co-Chairs @RepRickLarsen and @RepGregoryMeeks and #NewDem Chair Emeritus @RepRonKind called for Congressional action on @POTUS' intention to impose 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports into the United States. https://t.co/U0dxXRxMDr
Trade wars are bad for consumers, workers, farmers, businesses, practically everyone. People will pay more for basic goods and workers will lose their jobs. Instead of making bad, unilateral trade policy on a whim, the U.S. should be working with our allies to improve the system.
Broad tariffs @realdonaldtrump is threatening would adversely impact our allies and many domestic manufacturers who would pay more for materials. They may also lead to retaliation from other countries against U.S. made goods and services. This will lead to a trade war.
In many sectors, including steel and aluminum, China has pursued trade-distorting policies that should be addressed. However, Section 232 is NOT the right tool.
Secretary Mattis also notes in his memo that the military currently uses only 3% of domestic production, so @DeptofDefense does not believe there is a risk of not having domestic capacity.

Congrats to #NewDem @StaceyPlaskett on being appointed to serve on the @TransportDems! As a Co-Chair of the #NewDem 21st Century Infrastructure Task Force, Rep. Plaskett has long been fighting to make sure Congress addresses critical infrastructure issues.
Moving forward, I, and many of my colleagues in the New Democrat Coalition, stand ready, as we have been all year, to work across the aisle to address these pressing issues and to craft a long-term funding bill.‚Äù - #NewDem Chair @jahimes
I am disappointed to see Republicans unwilling to make compromise to move our country forward. Despite the passage of today‚Äôs bill, we still have challenges ahead of us to ensure the government is working to give every American the opportunity to succeed.
What our country needs is a fiscally responsible budget that keeps the government open and maintains a strong national defense. We also need to move urgently to give DREAMers certainty and fund critical health programs that millions of Americans rely on.
This package fails to address many legislative priorities, including protecting DREAMers, providing disaster for fellow Americans recovering from natural disasters, stabilizing the ACA, funding Community Health Centers, &amp; fully reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program.
Instead of working with Democrats on a bipartisan, long-term budget that fully funds both our nation‚Äôs domestic and security priorities and adheres to the principle of fiscal responsibility, Republicans have taken an irresponsible path to governing.
"House Republicans have kicked the can down the road for a fourth time this fiscal year, leaving a huge list of urgent, overdue priorities for the American people that still have not been accomplished.
