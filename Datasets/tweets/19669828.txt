@tayfan2 Ok, let's just believe everything that is posted on the internet and disregard reality.
@MSglenNBC Ideally many other unnecessary plastic products should be banned. So yeah I agree.
@MSglenNBC You do wash your underwear after each use right? That's because you know you have to clean before you reuse...
@MSglenNBC Sure. It's in it's own packaging.
@MSglenNBC But that would be stupid...
@MSglenNBC Aaaah if you did just a little research you would know #plastic bags are TOXIC http://t.co/hbwh5HxY
@MSglenNBC But you're not drinking the milk from the bag right? (At least I hope you're not) LOL
@MSglenNBC Plus, if the milk is leaking, you should take it back it's obviously not safe to drink.
@MSglenNBC I NEVER had that happen. Not saying it can't I just haven't been that clumsy.
@ProjectGreenBag *mouth
@MSglenNBC Not angry just hate it when people don't think and just run their moths scaring pile away from the right thing to do.
@timeclockman Green JOBS kill jobs?? Do you get how that makes NO sense? LOL
@MSglenNBC If it does, just wash it DUH!
@MSglenNBC But they don't sell chicken out of a package. Plastic bags would be bad too. DUH. You have no point.

@ErinBird lol why would you want to do that?
@Clayspice Thanks for the info. Right, plastic bags will never degrade in a landfill. Not using them in the first place is best choice.

@wallacejnichols The plastic bag solution: affordable, organic material & made by Americans (= green jobs) Would love to discuss, plz DM
@wallacejnichols We r excited about TEDx Replacing plastic bags is more than cheap poly imports A Project GreenBag is the sustainable answer
@Clayspice Oh great, thanks. Please send a link when available :)
@Clayspice How can we listen to the radio show here in the US?
@hilexpoly and the other 95% end up in landfills and the ocean... But yay for your 5% :/
@jennilionheart Hilex is not 'taking a stand'. They are benefiting from an environmental hazard, plastic bags.
