On Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, let’s not forget that he was a simple man who preached for tolerance during an ignorant time.

@debraruh #AXSChat Thank you Debra.  One of your biggest supporters!!!
@debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat The current disability leadership in Wash., DC is too busy in survivor mode rather than being inclusive.
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat Q6: The world looks to the US for leadership.  We need a President that values all people!!!
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat Q5: The ADA promotes an entitlement bias rather than tax incentives for corporations to hire PWDs.
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat Q4: Instead of continuing to being self-serving, we need to lift the community up as a whole.
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat Q3: We need to get away from the "me" speak and make the business case to corporations for hiring.
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken #AXSChat Q2: We need to create an international group of leaders coordinated towards a set of common goals.
@akwyz @debraruh @NeilMilliken  #AXSChat Q1: We need to start respecting individual differences in order to effect true change for all.
