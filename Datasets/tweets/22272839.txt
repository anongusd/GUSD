God bless all in these times of disasters and good luck we r preying for yr safety
#teaparty and #GOP must just stay in houses no shelters no Federal help in this disaster call yr tea bagger brothers for help
So all #teaparty must not ask for any fed help in this hurricane remember it would b socialism
@bobsaget really Nice dude

No #teaparty  and @GroverNorquist  it is yr fault and #GOP for letting u guys trash the GOP party and our country
So the Grover norquist tea party should now stand and take responsibility for what they have done
That is great we can go on a cruise with the #teaparty if we bring in more people to tea bag wow this is a great deal for trashing the USA
@LukeRussert has it rt this congress is going to do nothing
In know it is not all the tea partys fault but fo the most part #GOP u own this screw up acting like babies with this country
So just need to say thank u tea baggers for screwing up this country F@CK U
So I agree the #Dems need to start acting like dems and the #GOP need to start acting like GOP and loose the #teaparty  now and get 2 work
So the tea party just wonts to default the country it is time for the #GOP to stand up say no to the tea baggers and get there dignity back
http://t.co/74p0wWa tea party dead beater those in glass houses sir
So shouldn't Joe Walsh be fired #GOP #teaparty I'll bet there is more of u dead beats in the tea bagger group
So at least we know y the tea baggers r not afraid to default with r money cause they don't pay there own bills if there is one hhhmmm
Lest just raise the debt with out have a economic argument rt now @SpeakerBoehner , Obama
@LukeRussert wait what r they trying
What a joke no vote really the #GOP need to get yr crap together man say no to @TeamBachmann and the tea baggers
http://t.co/hLHJsuD Al Franken on the debt @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader #GOP get it now
I like @dailyshow approach to this John is the man y does he get it and congress can't really just leave tea baggers
@GOPLeader getting rid of bush tax cuts is not raising taxes it putting things rt stop protecting the rich and killing the poor,old
The #GOP shouldn't have started 2 wars @SpeakerBoehner teach yr kids in the tea bag party about reading history bush started this crap
Tell them clean bill or go home @SpeakerBoehner tired of this tea bag BS time to get back to work now people need help not this
Obama needs to say no to the #GOP @SpeakerBoehner, canter tell them piss off this a tea bag fight not an adult discussion
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader we r fighting 2 wars that yr party started and didn't fund when u started them start jobs not wars and we r good
Again #GOP @GOPLeader @SpeakerBoehner putting back the bush tax cuts is not raising taxes far is far no more jets we need homes jobs
I think we should make it law that u get 6 months before and election to plead yr case that's it so we can get things done
So I believe we got away from a king and his one way point of view to live free as Americans so we don't need the #teaparty let U.S. Live
@TheFlaCracker doesn't matter if black blue yellow u need to b able to negotiate and use free will god us not contracts form the uneducated

@JimDeMint this is y u appoint heads so that 100 people r not in the room
I'm thinking @SpeakerBoehner has no clue what his job is he does not have the same job as president Obama c that's it #GOP has no clue
About time obama got his grove on lay that smack down tea baggers need to learn and the #GOP needs to get some leader ship
Hope someone comes to rescue the #GOP from there kids and the tea baggers is there an adult going to speak up someone anyone
Its funny to watch the text from the #GOP leader he even tweets like he's a kid taking he's ball home god this is what the GOPs future is
Think it is time to fire up a new party one really for the people by the people one free from people like this Grover guy one that listens
#GOP @SpeakerBoehner what yr tea bagger side of the party per posed is not what we won't or need give the people a real bill please sir
So progressive ins owes me 28,000 cancels me and refuses to pay now they send me a bill 4 early cancelation 4 $185 luv this sh$t
#GOP and the guy in Florida needs to apologies to the woman from Florida we need to remain civil now tell him to take his ball and  go home
So the #GOP does know that there r 2 wars going on and the bush tax cuts need to go right I don't need to b paying 4 yr plains tea baggers
#GOP didn't U take a job to help the people for the people what happened get yr kids under control and get to work
#GOP quick question who put this grover guy the head of the party, what happened to the republican party, tea baggers pledges wow
Just like if the #Dems touch Medicare in this #debtdebate it is over that is a career ending move
#GOP this is totally yr fault for letting the children run the show and the tea baggers now yr doing to the air lines really wtf #debtdebate
So now this Grover norquist is giving the minions that signed this contract permission to get out of his contract tea bag joke
#Dems maybe a lot of things but sorry #GOP at least there not letting tea baggers ruin there party by uncompromising ways and contracts
#GOP please explain how Obama is choking recovery when yr the ones stalling our government and letting tea baggers run us into the ground
Oh and get rid of the bush tax cuts the worst pres in my history is still running this country into the ground wtf, tea baggers,bush aarrggh
If u say u can't pay for something then y r u doing it blame medicare answer y r we fighting 2 wars if we r broke that doesn't make sense
Do not touch Medicare if Dems do this they r done we pay for that stop taking from it stop the wars bring the troops home now
I'm sorry u don't cut Medicare and u stop the 2 wars and the bush tax cuts hello real easy
Y doesn't the tea baggers have to get there own party together y trash the republican party I won't them out
What r the tea baggers doing in there states nothing just like nothing at there jobs they need to b fired racist bastards let the #GOP go
This is crazy the tea bagger party is killing this country and pres Obama medicare he is a one term pres for me bush tax cuts go period
I just don't get it y cut Medicare and not get rid of the bush tax cuts y it just doesn't make sense
I still don't get y this is such a big  Issue now and ever the #GOP poster boy Reagan said it need to b done this is proof they dot read
I think of the tea baggers like the KKK in a lot of ways even some of it's heads r in the KKK acting members also hhhmm I'm talking policy
Is that it the tea baggers won't there own party but don't won't to go threw the proses to get one up and running these people r a joke
I'm so tired of the tea baggers party get out of the republican party go threw the proses and get yr own party oh wait
If the dems touch Medicare and not the bush tax cuts the dems r done F--K u
Bipartisan is word #GOP used for this bill really this was a waste of time and money glad the republicans don't care about us the people
#CutCapBalance is a tea bagger joke republicans need to stand up and say it for the country please #GOP do something for us
No #CutCapBalance is not a solid plan congressmen it is a joke and u know it waste our time and money but y should u care yr getting paid
R u kidding me this is what I mean #Bachmann has a child army helping her of home schoolers really
So this #CutCapBalance bill that takes from education medicare yea my kids and grand mom thank u wile the rich get richer. Bush tax cuts
So the republicans can rais the debt under a republican white pres but not a black democrat pres they also do not care about the poor wow
#CutCapBalance bill is a waste Of time we the people won't the bush tax cuts gone not medicare gone #GOP do not care about the poor or gmom
This #CutCapBalance vote today is a joke the #GOP needs to actually do something not this tea bag BS repeal bush tax cuts they don't work
Yes no secret prisons any where I agree but no one care rt now cause this debt augment is going on Obama better do something
The #GOP needs a leader someone to take the rains get the party back and kick out the tea baggers and show them what there JOB IS
The facts r if we default on r debt it is the republicans fault cause they let the tea baggers run the show and they don't have a clue
I'm starting to think it is a race thing the tea baggers have no answer for anything they do, heard 10 dif answers or complaints no fixes
Secret talks this debt thing has bin here not going anywhere y haven't the tea baggers said anything before now where were u with Pres Bush
This tea bagger party has to go negotiate is part of yr job blame everyone else not me they did it we didn't take yr ball and go home wwwhaa
This guy on msnbc is the prob his way or no way no give or take no negotiations blame everyone but them
With all that is going on in this country y is the GOP wasting time let's get productive listen to yr people negotiating is what u need 2do
Pelages, tea baggers the #GOP need to get out of this they stepped into it now now scrape it off quick please
Reagan is turning in his grave the strength of this country the mighty #GOP is now the minions for Judson Phillips and the tea baggers
So thats is this Judson Phillips wonts to b king of the USA and the republicans r his minions the party of strength is now minions
Judson Phillips this guy needs to go what an ass r u kidding me no negotiations except what he wont's that's dictator ship buddy
C the tea bag party head just said it no negotiations it is what they won't or nothing f u that is not for the people
If we ban the tea baggers from washington and get the # GOP moving also ban the scam that people signed to not raise taxes it is a scam
So #GOP delays another day wasting the gov time and the peoples money for there own political gain do yr job #GOP now stop wasting r money
Give us r country back tea baggers stop this BS do yr job #GOP we the people need u back we didn't ask 4 the tea baggers help us now please
C that's the prob the tea baggers just don't care about us the people just them the group that's what I've said make there own party
So I'm sorry not one of these #GOP guys will get my vote EVER holding this country hostage is wrong gas is back up all will b up soon again
Man this just seems like a no brainer signing something that takes away bargaining when yr elected to bargain for us WTF is wrong hhmm $$$?
So we need the list so all that signed this list will not b elected again cause u where hired for the people not pledging a scam
Y r representatives so gullible y would u sign something that is a scam people that sign this should not b reelected they fell for a scam
I'm not saying im for raising taxes but u can't have a discussion about economy when it is all off the table doesn't make sense
Someone needs to ban this pledge shit this is a scam that can hurt this country it takes away bargaining that is what adults do
U can't have a decision if it is all off the table and George bush where was this when bush was here this is a scam more tea bag BS
This is crazy signing a pelage to no raise taxes that sounds like a scam the rich pay more the the middle we need to make it balanced
The problem with saying Pres Obama is spending all r money and screaming fowl how about pres Bush who put us here and outed a CIA agent
U can't stand for taking apart Medicare and not do anything to the rich when we r paying for there screw ups and jets #GOP
If the tea baggers won't there own party than get it stop trashing the #GOP get a book and read the history of this great USA
Trust me I like the #GOP party and it really stands for  not this cry baby tea bag crap that is the party now bring back the GOP please
So if Canter wonts to run the tea bagging party let him  I'm not paying him to do it though let him not pay his own bills I like paying mine
It has to b nice not to worry about paying yr bills I mean the #GOP is saying the USA doesn't have to so can we make them pay
Making the rich pay the same as the middle is not raising taxes #GOP and canter raised taxes 4 times with bush in office Hmmm
Yea that's great to know that the republicans don't have to pay there bills most don't anyway this is proof but don't drag us into this
I like this idea I think we should find all the shovel ready jobs in all the GOP areas and post them
Y don't the #GOP care about the little people or read a history book I mean all kidding aside drop the tea baggers they r killing the USA
Do not touch Medicare close tax loopholes and get rid of the bush tax cuts do the right thing people do what u where elected to do
So everything obama does is bad everything bush did is fine the Tea Bag people r racist so r republicans u can't b that dumb GOP
Fact #GOP rookies and tea baggers r trying to destroy this country for there own  stupidity this is where the leaders need to Lead now
So because #GOP is playing games with r money we the people pay more @ the pump this crap has to stop really
#GOP rich people paying almost as much tax as a middle class person is not raising taxes I'm tired of paying 4 yr jets get to work
#GOP needed to stop crying get yr leaders to work the childish games r not helping the people we don't won't temper tantrums
#800days I'm sorry it has bin 185 days no job bill from republicans we the people r waiting
#800days it has bin over 100 days since the republicans have put a job bill on the floor stop crying do something
@RepPaulRyan so what r u going to do about it yesterday's numbers suck what is yr plan we c u doing nothing at all we the people can read
@johnboehner @reppaulryan so u guys haven't brought a jobs bill to the floor do u guys know we can read really do something stop crying
#jobs there is not one jobs bill from GOP or tea baggers still waiting hearing a lot of bitching no one doing
Wait Orrin hatch from Utah says the rich pay enough the poor need to step up really r u F$&@ing kidding me this is what I mean disconnect
So where r the jobs from republicans and tea baggers still waiting can't seem to find one jobs bill it's bin like 185 days or so hhhmmm
If I'm still paying for jets and they cut Medicare they r out cause they don't have a clue take the welfare from oil companies now
We have come along way in this great country of ours lets get going and make something great again rt here for us for all
If I don't do my knob I'm fired let's pass a law where elected officials can get fired also vote in vote out little harsh I know
I get it democrats r not innocent but please try and be adults here work together cause this word play isn't flying anymore
Stop hiding behind words like raising taxes ooooo no how about making it equal for all that's it simple
It is not raising taxes on reg people just the rich paying there fair share in this world oil companies paying something cause they don't
So do the republicans know we have the Internet I pay more taxes the trump than any billionaire or millionaire I'm tired of paying 4 jets
The republicans where elected to do a job and getting paid for that job if there not going to do it me as the people won't them FIRED
No we can't do anything the republicans dont do anything if it doesn't benefit them selves or the derelict tea baggers
The republicans need to stop cock blocking everything that needs to be done this is the united states not the me states
If obama touches medicare it is over I'm done no reason for this crap democrats don't touch Medicare
Thanks tea baggers way to fuc another thing up know the law before u open yr mouths please real news people need ignore these idiots please
So teabag  aholes complained about Obamas birth recored so much that now states r making it mandatory that we all use birth certificates
I'm really lost on people who say they r for the people yet help rich people and trash the middle to poor we r all the people
No seriously if the tax payers r paying for air planes for people than y can't they fly me for free I am the one paying for it that's a wtf
I just don't understand people that say take from Medicare when oil companies don't pay taxes and we pay for air planes for rich people
Companies hiding off shore that don't pay taxes should b made to pay a big fine if they don't won't to pay taxes
I know closing tax loopholes is not perfect but it is better than killing Medicare and those who dont c that r blind
So if we close the tax lopes for the ones hiding off shore instead of messing with Medicare we would b ok wake up republicans
Lazy parenting is not reason enough for the government to step in know yr kids pay attention to yr kids I'm not paying 4 yr bad parenting
We need to pay attention to these groups trying to ban games just because they r the lazy parents we should not have to pay for them
These people trying to ban video games r crazy it is up to the parent be a parent
#E3onG4 wow do I need to say more

@Morning_Joe ok Rep wiener is bad but what about republican rookies spending on them selves wile trying to cut from Medicare and others
So republicans talking trillions in cuts yet spend them selves Wow welcome to America WTF. Sorry as they say F#‚Ç¨k gmom and gdad
But the spending doesn‚Äôt stop at constituent communication ‚Äî GOP freshmen have also spent big money on car leases and consultants thanks
Texas Rep Francisco Canseco spent $75,000 on a one-year contract with CampaignGrid LLC a company that describes itself as online advertising
The biggest newly elected spender in this realm is Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who authorized spending $78,518 in taxpayer money
At least 15 GOP freshmen have shelled out tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on mass communication or franking designed
For Christ sake Sara palin could have bin VP that is scary she needs to learn history pay attention to her kids make b a parent don't quit
I have to say I think Sara palin is the dumbest fraken woman I mean come on u F up about Paul revere twice really what an ass
Seriously with the way things r going rt now republicans need to drop this crap and try and work for the people what happened to them really
Cantor is the the who said help but cut something else I got it how about bush tax cut we cut them ass really I'm ashamed really
So I watched this vid where the republicans don't won't to help areas that have disasters in them cause it is not cost effective wow FU
Listen the republicans voted to kill Medicare anything else they say is moot point call them on it please everyone
So palin and trump got together that would have bin the quitter conference rt save us all
I don't get when u do something like kill medicare that the republicans can look at them selves the same also thy won't get rid of bush cuts
So the republicans vote to kill Medicare and now they say if dems don't they won't vote for the debt sealing WTF
Romney for pres haha oood to the underwear god I got it Romney and Palin yea wtf is wrong with us
Leave lance alone it is a sport hang the wall streeters in time square what a waste of our courts
Please stop the welfare for oil companies people call yr congressman whatever it takes stop the subsidies "help we the people not u the oil"
Yea I won't newt in my white house what a joke what happened to the republicans they used to be great now a joke
Someone really has to explain to we the people y wall street gets to rape us and no one cares people r making choices food and others
@washingtonpost what is wrong with people they should b made to pay and all fired I'm done with incompetence
how about we go after wall street now cause gas should not b this high wall street is fucking us really pay attention people
The  racism in this country has to stop this pres is not doing a bad job may not b perfect but r u kidding shut up tea baggers please
If this where a red neck in office we would be have a party for a month from bin Ladin why r we not just cause he's black I'm getting sick
Talk about the republican plot to take from the middle and poor and give to the rich in this country pay attention
Stop talking about terrorist and they will go away yr empowering them talk about this country we have enough problems here
Cut the banks off no more help no more subsidies for gas companies and end the bush tax cuts, there's my budget stop beating up on the poor
Gas gas gas wtf someone do something about these wall street assholes they will never get my help again wall street is done
So y doesn't the tea bag party worry about oil companies taking advantage of us instead of a birth record oil companies r not US company
So y would we b scared of Al Qeada coming after us we will get them also it is that simple Bring It cause we will make them r bitch
So as soon as republicans talk about real help for the US than I'll start to listen cause oil companies getting money to make money is Wrong
So republicans now need to beat up on middle class and old people. Just a thought oil subsidies I know it will hurt the rich getting richer
WOW nice job to the people involved, NICE FuCKING JOB
coming into the summer with people unable to buy food the Gaul the gas companies have to raise the price this much where is our gov now HELP
how can they say gas prices will not effect the economy do they know that it takes gas to get all the stuff to us in one way or another
@GovWalker y to figure another way to bring down democracy or to actually do something for the people not just the rich that pay for u
Now let's c what the racist tea bag party will talk about I bet they say it is fake
Now trump will have to actually have to talk politics and I think we will find out that he and Palin r about the same IQ level in politics
Trump won't run cause he would have to show his papers and we would know that he has lied about all his finances
Trump would fix the economy he would file bankruptcy
I thought palin was bad trump is gone man
How about trump sit down and shut up the jester of the republicans
Where is trumps records y hammer the pres when yr a looser he is a bully
I'm sorry this Donald trump speech is a joke he is a joke and he is a looser god help us
A racist joke trump is
Trump is a joke a fucking joke
I think trump is one of the biggest racist I have heard from in a wile
lower gas prices and America will spend spend spend we r biting our own foot off people will not travel this summer that will b BAD
GAS PRICES, GAS PRICES, GAS PRICES this is not a joke,people r not going to take vacations food will cost to much, U CAN FIX THIS
people in power need to listen deal with wall street and stop them from bringing down the economy again, cause we cant afford to travel
Saudi cutting back production cause there is so much in the world Hmmmm so again y r we paying so much for oil, no will travel soon
so we have to much oil in this country that we r looking into another place to store it,so y is gas $4. a gallon
Where were the republicans doting George bush y do they care now
no republicans its not the taxes that will slow development it is beating up the mid to lower class and giving it all to the rich
what about gas we cant afford this $4. a gallon will bring us to a stop the mid to lower class will not b able to move
someone needs to speak for the mid to lower class republicans won't
suck it up tea baggers the pres called u out yes a black man called u out wwwhhhaaaaa!!!!!
somebody has to start listening cause no one is GAS is to high people r canceling vacations this WILL bring down the economy move now
if the republicans can become republicans again and get away from the tea baggers they will b fine if they become the tea bag party sorry
how come the tea baggers bitch about gov to big yet where they r that state has the most welfare they need to do what they say give up ssi
@GovWalker u forgot trashing USA and the right to negotiate u need to learn to read a history book and not just yr bank book
how come the tea bagers bitch now that a black man is fixing it and not when a red neck was trashing it where were they then hhhmmm
so now tea beggars say Obama isn't qualified to do the budget yet George bush isn't he the one that  spent us here where were they then
how about cutting gas prices so the middle class and lower can drive there is no reason for this stop this now
we need to slam r gov with letters tweets phone calls anything we can about gas this is wrong NO REASON FOR IT AT ALL WTF GOV
