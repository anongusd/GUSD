RT @TheWeirdWorld: Being sick at someone else’s house is 100 times worse than being sick at your own house.
@realDonaldTrump We don’t need your prayers, we need your resignation.
@realDonaldTrump You have had two years, face it you blew it. NEXT. PLEASE.
@realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina Don’t you have real work to do?  Oh wait you are probably busy lining your pockets from the royalties of the sale of this book.
@SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @SenMarkey @FAANews Although I am thankful for the federal safety regulations regarding airlines, mandating the seat size seems like a government overreach.  Stay out of it please, let thebfree market be free. Oh and there are other real issues facing our nation you should be concerned about.

@realDonaldTrump Dear Donny,  maybe this could all be cleared up if you kindly supplied your definition of epic.  I’ll wait...
@realDonaldTrump Please stop talking.
RT @TheWeirdWorld: You and your old friends hung out for the last time and didn’t even know it.
@MichaelAvenatti If you are out of jail by then.  #slimeball
@SenSchumer Just what we need the government dictating to a business the demensions of the chairs they rent for profit.  What’s next movie theaters?  Why are you the airline complaint hotline?
@realDonaldTrump How are you not embarrassed by the mess you have created?  Alienating and pissing off our allies is not good for the country DJ.
@realDonaldTrump Excuse me but as the president of the United States of America, or rather as an adult you should be above the name calling.  This behavior is an embarrassment and a disgusting example to set for America.
@realDonaldTrump Count the votes. Every single one.
@marcorubio Stop using your political platform to assert religion. This is not what you were elected for.
@TheSarcasmShow Sounds like a productive discussion.
@marcorubio Stop, you were not elected to pontificate bible verses.
RT @TheWeirdWorld: No matter how stupid you think your ideas are, remember, there’s a millionaire out there because of pool noodles.
@marcorubio We don’t need you to quote bible verses, we need you to fobwhat you were elected to do.  Work for the American people.
@marcorubio The Catholic establishment is run by sick men who covered up countless acts of child abuse, many against America’s children.  Get your priorities straight.
@marcorubio Knock it off.  You were not elected to quote the Bible.  You were elected to make a positive difference for the American people.
@marcorubio Really?
@marcorubio Keep👏religion 👏out👏of👏politics👏
@SenFeinstein Yes!
@marcorubio You are a senator.  Not a preacher.  The American people do not need nor want to be quoted biblical threats by you.
@amyklobuchar If you want to solve the rx drug epidemic you need a way to stop pharmacies from filling enough rxs to create an addict and to hold responsible those who are writing the erroneous scripts.  There is a straightforward solution that would help identify both, if you are interested.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Get 👏 religion👏out👏of👏politics👏
@TruePandaGames @CNN “The Holocaust example was meant to show that a person's circumstance don't define them and their worth”. - the author of the text explains (although not very clearly).  Also this is not req reading for any student as the course is one of many electives students can choose from.
@RepJayapal That’s awesome.  What is your proposal to accomplish Medicare for all?
@ChelseaHouska #mombrain I feel ya
@NBCNews Prevention would be simple.  Get the three national rx switching companies to-route any Rx claim for one of these drugs to a central “clearinghouse”to check to see how much of these drugs this person has had and if too much deny the medication (as a first step).
@SenatorCantwell I agree denying preexisting conditions is not ok.  However, the cost of healthcare is already astronomical and rising and emergency rooms are already flooded, what is being done about that now? #stopthebleeding
@LimerickSage @tjmac_teri @USATODAY Then change the program.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump get a grip on this ntl epidemic big pharma, crooked doctors &amp; PBMs need to close their feeder program.  First step Take these three out of the loop pick off the narcotic claims at the nat switches before they process and reject the claim if member is over limit.
@RepJayapal You realize this is a story from four years ago coming out of a detention  facility that has been shut down for just as long. Right? Although a horrific story, that should have never taken place.  Stay. Current. Please.
@tjmac_teri @USATODAY The instructions for this 3D gun have already been downloaded 100,000s of times, and circulated around the world. Working with the 3D printer manufacturers to develop a way to not allow the printing of guns is a more attainable solution.
@cnnbrk “To be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account.”
@cnnbrk Is anyone actually reading this article? “Cohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen's House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge.”...
@RepJayapal I’m not sure WHY our government has ANY involvement in this matter whatsoever.  As a mother of two I can tell you that the government is the very last entity I want involved in persuading  MY choice (no matter what that choice was) #stayoutofit
@NancyPelosi My guess is your true motivation is votes.  That voice belongs to those who are here LEGALLY.
@SenFeinstein They already have easy access to real weapons.  Lets focus our efforts on figuring that out.  The instructions for this 3D gun have already been downloaded 100,000s of times. It’s the WORLD WIDE Web, making it illegal here doesn’t stop someone outside the USA anyway.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Perhaps figure out why public institutions have sharply increased the price of tuition over the past decade - forcing attendees into more debt than ever before.  The solution is not to throw more money at the problem, but rather fix the cause.  #robbingtheyouth
