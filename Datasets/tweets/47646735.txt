I've included several important excerpts in this thread but go read the whole thing at the link at the top. It shouldn't take an international commission to tell us that shooting unarmed protesters is criminal but, in case you needed that, there you go. End.
"The commission therefore found reasonable grounds to believe that demonstrators were shot in violation of their right to life or of the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law"
"The Israeli security forces killed and maimed Palestinian demonstrators who did not pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury to others when they were shot, nor were they directly participating in hostilities."
"Journalists and medical personnel who were clearly marked as such were	shot, as were children, women and persons with disabilities"
"Victims who were hundreds of metres away from the Israeli forces and visibly	engaged in civilian activities were shot, as shown by eyewitness accounts, video footage and medical records."
"The commission investigated all 189 fatalities and tracked more than 300 injuries caused by the Israeli security forces at the demonstration sites and during the demonstrations. "
"No Israeli civilian deaths or injuries were reported during or resulting from the demonstrations."
"The use of live ammunition by Israeli forces inflicted life-changing injuries on demonstrators. Some 21 people became paralysed by injuries to the spinal cord and nine people suffered permanent loss of vision"
"Persons with disabilities are entitled to special protection under international law. The commission investigated several emblematic cases of persons with disabilities who were killed by Israeli forces."
"The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers shot journalists intentionally, despite seeing that they were clearly marked as such."
"Between 30 March and 31 December, Israeli forces killed two journalists and wounded 39 others with live ammunition as they covered the demonstrations."
"The Occupied Palestinian Territory is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a health worker. During the demonstrations, Israeli forces killed three clearly marked paramedics"
"Children enjoy special protection under international law. Israeli security forces killed 35 children during the demonstrations in 2018."
"In total, Israeli security forces killed 60 demonstrators on 14 May, the highest one day death toll in Gaza since their military operation there in 2014. The snipers shot at least 1,162 people with live ammunition; some 141 were wounded by bullet fragmentation or	shrapnel."
"On 14 May, Israeli security forces shot and killed seven children: a girl, Wisal Khalil (14), and six boys: Izzedine al-Samak (13); Said al-Kheir (15); Ahmad al-Sha’ar (15); Talal Matar (15); Saadi Abu Salah (16); and Ibrahim al-Zarqa (17)."
"Israeli forces continued to employ live ammunition against demonstrators, killing and wounding civilians, including children, journalists and health workers, and leaving many with permanent disabilities."
"Over the weeks that followed, demonstrations were held every Friday at the five main sites."
"The youngest casualty was a two-year-old, wounded in the head; the oldest, a 71-year-old woman shot in the legs."
"Overall, at the demonstrations held on 30 March, Israeli forces killed 18 people and wounded 703 people with live ammunition; another 62 people were wounded by bullet fragmentation or shrapnel...."
"The commission found that 189 Palestinians were killed at demonstrations sites, 183 of whom were killed by live ammunition used by Israeli security forces"
"For a threat to life to be regarded as imminent, an attacker should have no remaining preparatory steps and be in sufficient geographic proximity for the attack to succeed."
"Founded in the right to life, law enforcement rules based on international human rights law permit potentially lethal force by law enforcement agencies or security forces only in self-defence or for the defence of others when there is an imminent threat to life."
"In the commission’s view, the demonstrations were civilian in nature, had clearly stated political aims and, despite some acts of significant violence, did not constitute combat or a military campaign."
"Prior to the first demonstration, Israeli forces reinforced their positions at the fence with additional troops, including more than 100 sharpshooters."
"the commission assessed whether these duty bearers respected, protected and fulfilled the right to life, the freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom of expression, among other rights."
"affidavits, medical reports, open source reports, social media content, written submissions and expert legal opinions, video and drone footage, and	photographs"
"The commission conducted 325 interviews and meetings with victims, witnesses, government officials and members of civil society, from all sides, and gathered more than 8,000 documents, including..."

@abuaardvark "our statistical analysis rules out other explanations."		That's bold, especially given the big elephant in the room is Netanyahu. It would have been good to see how attitudes toward Netanyahu, separate from his policies, impact likelihood of voting for "centrist" parties.
65 million Americans voted for a Democrat for President in 2016, 40 million of them were white. 		Gonna go out on a limb here and suggest many of them may not be totally woke racial justice warriors.

This structural discrimination is already aimed at erasing the voices of Palestinians, coverage of Israeli elections should not be aiding and abetting this crime but rather challenging it head on.
Third, it isn't just Palestinian citizens of Israel that are impact by the outcomes of Israel elections, it is also Palestinian who are subject to Israeli policies, like the millions living under Israel military rule who can't vote in the elections.
Second, the election outcomes will impact Palestinian citizens of Israel and often, Palestinian citizens of Israel are the targets of racist attacks during political campaigns.
First of all, not all Israeli citizens are Jewish. In fact, Palestinian citizens of Israel make up some 20+% of the Israeli population and their voices are almost always neglected in these conversations.

We left the conversation equally as committed to our perspectives as before it, at least I know I did, and I was very glad when he ultimately was not in congress anymore.
Not only did he meet with me personally, which isn't common (usually you get passed off to a staff member) but he spent over 70 minutes of his time speaking to me one on one about the issue.
He was an ardent Zionist, highly rated and supported by AIPAC and strongly disagreed with what I had to say. But he was my Congressman and I was his constituent so we were kinda stuck with each other.
No doubt he had much more experience in politics and in life than me. I was there to talk to him about US policy toward Israel and why I thought it should change because of what Palestinians were going through.

Obviously, right leaning Democrats hate this because it underscores their failure, but it was not Sanders who oversaw historic gaps in income and wealth inequality, it was them. That more than anything else is why the party has leaned in his direction.
A great irony, and perhaps poetic justice, around Sanders' candidacy is that despite the attacks on him being an "outsider" to the Democratic party, what has happened is that he didn't really come to the party but the party has increasingly come to him.
If you are a voter that supports big and urgent social welfare expansion, who are you going to trust to do this, the candidate that's been calling for it their whole career, including when it wasn't expedient or those who got behind it 5 minutes ago when it was?
I don't buy this argument that voters are less likely to vote for Sanders because there are more candidates that back his policies today. It seems to me that the opposite is true.

4) lastly, the question wording was explicit. They didn't just ask about the acronym. People were undecided not because they did not understand the question but rather because they are not sure if they supported or opposed, i.e willing to consider it.
2) 20% is not insignificant and 3) that most people are either supportive or not opposed shows an openness toward this most don't recognize exists in public sentiment and which you wouldn't grasp from mainstream media.
A couple interesting things about this 1) It is radically different then the professed sentiment in Congress, which is supposed to represent the people, and where there is near total opposition to BDS.
Wow, pretty remarkable new Rasmussen poll on BDS. 		When asked do you "favor or oppose the effort calling for boycott, disinvestment and sanctions against Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians?" 		~60% of likely voters do not oppose it (20% support/ 39% undecided)

militarism and securitization*
So long as Israeli society is content with denying basic human rights to Palestinians indefinitely, Israel will continue to alienate itself from much of the world.
So the growing divide between Israel and Democrats, and increasingly between Israel and the US overtime, is a divide not between personalities at the top of the relationship, but values that characterize the peoples at the bottom.
If you look at the world through the prism of freedom, equality, justice, human rights, sympathy toward refugees, anti-racism &amp; secularism (which are far more prominent among the Dem base) then you are likely to look at what Israel is doing to the Palestinians very unfavorably
If you look at the world through the prism of ethnic nationalism, xenophobia, militarism and secularization, racism, anti-refugee sentiment and messianism, which increasingly define the GOP base, you are likely to look at what Israel is doing to the Palestinians favorably.
Rather, this is about a profound divide in values, one that happens to increasingly overlap with partisan divisions in the United States in this moment. Which values prism you choose to look at the world through determines your affinity with Israel.
What is alienating people, Democrats in particular, is not merely Netanyahu the person but the ethos he represents and Israel's policies toward the Palestinians. Yes, the personal conflict/embrace with Obama/Trump amplified it but it isn't really what it is about.
But the bigger problem with this piece is the emphasis on Netanyahu himself. Yes, Netanyahu has become the internationally recognized and abrasive personally associated with Israeli intransigence and belligerence. But...
He still sort of does that in this piece though when he suggests that Netanyahu retaliated against Obama in 2012 for something Obama allegedly did in 2013 and 2015. I doubt Netanyahu has figured out time travel because he'd just got back and erase Palestinians if he could.
@JacksonDiehl First, this is remarkable if only because of who wrote it. Diehl has been one of the more reliable sympathetic voices to Netanyahu over the years, often repeating his preferred talking points.

@skjask @bruce_weingart The question misses and simultaneous demonstrates the point. AIPAC is able to leverage campaign contributions that are not listed as such in FEC fillings because they are given by individual members or groups that don't declare their affiliation.
I will continue to update this thread with useful articles that shed light on the role and impact of AIPAC and other pro-Israel interest groups on US policy.
By pointing this out, Rep. Omar got people to ask important questions which, as you can see, AIPAC does not want people asking. 		That is exactly why they must keep being asked, especially as we approach AIPAC's policy conference in March.
What is clear is that the public deserves to know about the role of money and interest groups in shaping policy and there is lots of sunlight that needs to be shed on this night flower.
MJ tells us he "sat in AIPAC staff meetings at which the political director discussed whom “we” would be supporting in this campaign and whom “we” were going to “destroy” in that one. "
Here, this important article by @rosenberg_mj provides a lot of insight. MJ Rosenberg worked for AIPAC for years and was also a hill staffer. 		https://t.co/ht1QWUGazk
So while there are some things we can measure about AIPAC's budget, lobbying expenditure, etc, what we don't know is how much money it can leverage through the campaign contributions of its members and others
Through its “Congressional Club,” some of Aipac’s 100,000 members commit to giving at least $2,500 a year to House or Senate candidates while ensuring the donations are made “in a clearly pro-Israel context,”. An AIPAC spokes refuse to say how big this "club" is
There @bykowicz tells us "Aipac raises more than $100 million a year from donors" and "Much of the Aipac-related money is channeled through a related nonprofit group that pays for congressional trips to Israel." but also, crucially...

Important thread on this https://t.co/cSMJiG7p5e
Sexism, anti-Black racism and Islamophobia all make throwing a black Muslim woman under the bus easier, even if you are her colleagues and fellow party members in congress. It is shameful that some disregard these dynamics in their behavior.
Perhaps the best indicator of the extent of impact pro-Israel interest groups have is the fact that a tweet about their impact by one member of Congress has inspired more outrage and action by Dem leaders than decades of human rights abuses by the Israeli state.
We need to be able to talk about the latter in a critical and honest way without triggering the former. The answer can not be that we can not discuss it because then we are allowing concern over one form of oppression to enable another. We can and must fight both.
It is true that there are long standing pernicious antisemitic tropes about rich Jews nefariously controling government.		It is also true that pro-Israel interest groups exist, have influence, help shape US policy toward Israel and thus contribute to oppressing Palestinians
If pro-Israel interest groups do not have meaningful influence and impact on the direction of US policy toward Israel, why do they exist and why are millions and millions of dollars raised and spent through them? Seems like a total waste.
https://t.co/TpUmtTHoHJ
Tom Cotton received nearly $1 million in contributions toward his campaign in 2014 from a pro-Israel interest group headed by Bill Kristol. Surely, this wasn't about Israel, and had not impact, rather it was probably because the group just loved Cotton's goofy haircut https://t.co/Z0vXX9Ldkk
RT @YousefMunayyer: Uh, AIPAC is pretty explicit about how it acts as a vehicle for funding for members of Congress. It is right on its web…
Yup https://t.co/UXd7tZkIIH
Or worse yet, as some have chosen to do; weaponize one form of oppression to advance another. /End.
So addressing oppression comprehensively, not just one form of it, in this context requires an understanding of these dynamics so that in attempting to address one form of oppression we are not intentionally or unintentionally reinforcing another.
And that dramatic imbalance has an impact on many things including who gets to talk about what, especially when they come from one or multiple marginalized communities who don't receive the same veil of protection against microaggressions in the discourse.
Yet there also seems to be a real dearth of understanding around microaggressions targeting most other communities in this same space.
That high degree of understand is a good thing and a testament to the important work that has been done over years to address anti-Jewish bigotry in this country.
At the same time, the lack of understanding of nuances on this issue in the general public is uniquely juxtaposed against a very high degree of understanding of what one can and can not say by people and groups that are highly influential in elite discourse.
So it is understandable and true that lack of nuance can contribute to microaggressions and that has to be understood and addressed.
But just like I understand the nuances of this issue because I have spent a lot of my life working on it, there is a hell of a lot I do not know about other issues.
I have been working on these issues for years and thus I have learned a lot about how this works and the nuances. The nuances are extremely important. But the truth is, a tiny number of people are really versed in them.
You are right that I think language around this is very important because it is important to be accurate but this got me thinking about a few things https://t.co/d5Y2cRbqwR
Just as polls show Americans favor some gun control (background checks etc) &amp; people point to interest groups like NRA for preventing change so to do polls show most Americans don't want US taking a side between Israel/Palestine yet interest groups create "pro-Israel" expectation
There's an effort underway to police &amp; limit growing criticism of Israel on the left and in the Dem party by conflating it with antisemitism and doing so by targeting Muslim women of color in Congress in the hopes of piggybacking on prevailing racism, sexism and Islamophobia
If you think saying AIPAC spending money to influence the US Govt, something that is undeniably true, is the same thing like saying rich Jews like George Soros are part of a global conspiracy to control and destroy national culture then your perspective is warped beyond reason.
This means, most people don't care enough to change their voting behavior and of those who do, the pro-Israel groups have much more capacity and more influence.
Of that small fraction of people who care intensely about Israel/Palestine there is huge disparity in institutional capacity and resources with the Pro-Israel interest groups having way, way, WAY more capacity and resources than Palestinian rights groups.
Rather, as this usually works, most Americans don't give a damn about the specifics of what is happening 6K miles away. But, a small fraction of Americans care about this deeply.
The idea that Congress passes pro-Israel bills because Americans broadly support Israel is nonsense. The number of F-16s we send Israel is not a matter of wide knowledge, let alone wide consensus.
There is nothing illegal about lobbying.		There is nothing illegal about donating to candidates or doing so explicitly for advancing a particular political agenda.		There is also nothing really rational about pretending this does not happen and does not have an impact.

Supporters of Israel's apartheid policies dont even really try to defend them anymore because its obvious to many that they are indefensible. Instead they double down equating &amp; conflating Israel with Jews to portray criticism of Israeli policy as antisemitism. #WontWorkEither
Jared Goff is 24. I wonder if he even knows what a videotape is.
We shoulda had Mahomes vs. Goff. We got robbed.
It is utter BS that a game like this, a back and forth duel between two QBs down to the wire, ends without Mahomes even getting a chance to touch the ball.
Tony Romo is SOOOO excited. I guess you can't blame him, he's never been to a championship game before.
Sure, buying AFC championships must be expensive but Kraft probably got a deal with the economy pack.

Wow. Rams to the SB! This game will be controversial for ever for the non-call but hard to see how the Saints could expect to beat this team scoring less than 30.
@richeisen @TroyAikman I dont know what the rationale is but the CB was between the reciever and the ball well before the contact and the ball wasnt auper close, could they interpret that as an unmakeable catch and thus no PI?
The best a cornerback can hope for on a deep pass play is that he puts himself the best possible position to make a play the ball. When you get that opportunity and fail to capitalize it is a killer.

In sum, let's stop doing this please.
This creates a certain discursive loyalty test for people of color, requiring a willingness to sign up to go destroy what has primarily been other people of color to belong. Obviously white people in this country carry no such burden.
Like when Hillary Clinton responded to a question about Islamophobia by saying "We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines."
We often here the narrative that we should treat Muslim-Americans as equals because Muslims have served in the military. As if the only way to overcome your non-WASPness in American is to sign up for the military.
The problem with this of course is that it reinforces the idea that certain people in the US have to perform a higher degree of loyalty to institutions of a state than others to be considered worth of equal protection. We see this all the time in the convo around Muslim-Americans

@mattseaton @Freedland The Israelis were attempting to act in their own interest, the saddest thing is that there were Palestinians who were willing to cooperate in the charade making it possible.
@mattseaton @Freedland Good faith toward what? No govt, left or right, supported the Palestinian minimum. It was all "state minus". Oslo was a temporary release valve and an attempt to manage the status quo.
@mattseaton @Freedland @nybooks I have. The problem is as the author wrote his vision of founding "collided with reality" in the 1980s. It also collided with reality in from 48 until then. Liberal Zionists like Oz want to recognize one reality to keep suppressing recognition of another.

The bottom line is denying millions of people basic rights because they are of a different religion is not very attractive. People don't want to invest in that or support it - including Americans. The longer it continues the more people will step away. And yes, in Congress too.
The Apartheid South African regime tried the same thing by the way, they had a vast campaign aimed at stymieing the global Anti-apartheid movement. It probably bought their Apartheid policies a few more years but they ultimately failed. Israeli apartheid policies will fail too.
Israel seeks to exceptionalize BDS &amp; turn it into something foriegn when in reality it is American as the Boston Tea Party and the Montgomery Bus Boycott but that's because they dont want Americans asking questions about how their tax dollars support Israel's human rights abuses.
You see Palestinians did not invent Boycotts, Divestment or Sanctions. They've been used in many struggles and continue to be every day. But it is the use of these tactics for Palestinian rights that is *uniquely* denied.

Trump is but the most recent and likely the most shameless President to do this.
Fearmongering against immigrants and raising the spectre of "terrorism" for political purposes is a time honored American tradition going back decades and transcending the partisan divide.
Despite that, not one national security-related charge was levied, ZERO, even though the investigation targeted hundreds of immigrants who "fit a terrorist profile."
Immigrants from Muslim countries were 1,280 times more likely to be targeted for investigations than immigrants from other countries.
In 2004 the Bush admin launched Operation Frontline to "detect, deter and disrupt terror operations" among immigrants during the months leading up to the presidential election.
And this is not the first time the US Govt used false claims of "terrorism"  to defend heavy handed immigration policies.... https://t.co/IvHoa2r3AS

Hasbara response 1: Palestinians vote for their own leaders in the West Bank &amp; Gaza		Truth: Palestinians have no sovereign govt, they live under Israeli military occupation. Apartheid S.

If Beto comes out against establishment positions, he will have a better chance of convincing people of his independence. But if he goes along with an effort to retrofit him into the party positions the base is aching to run away from, he might get big donors. but also resentment
If you throw enough money and establishment support behind any candidate you can garner a ton of votes but people rally around candidates they see as authentic. I think this is going to be Beto's biggest challenge.
Bernie centered economic inequality in 2016 when the country was more ready to hear about state subsidized health and education. But he has made economic inequality the focus of his career when his positions were far from the mainstream.
Obama was not just anti-Iraq war in 08 when it became very unpopular. He was opposed to it when Bush decided to go to war and when it was very popular.
Trump was not just promoting racist ideas in 2016, he had a history of taking racist actions and making racist statements. People who were excited by racism believed him because he was an authentic racist.
The reason that Trump and Sanders in 16, and Obama in 2008, generated so much energy around them from voters was not just because of what their ideas were, but also because voters felt they authentically believes their ideas.

So yeah, please tell us the story when it has a conclusion. We deserve to know and will appreciate the reporting, but in the meantime I have to wonder; if so much time and effort is spent covering this in the interim, what is being missed? Isn't there more we deserve to know?
I get it. It involves the president, and not just any president, one that literally came to the White House from reality TV  while spending time with strippers and tweeting constantly. It is sensational, sometimes salacious, with a dimension of international intrigue.
I look forward to reading the final reports from the investigation and reporting on how it comes to an end. But I really don't need all the details about all the memos and all the leaks until then.
There are lots of other news stories that deserve attention about government policies and how they are failing Americans and failing people around the world.
Obviously, the investigation is crucial, the facts need to be aired and the details matter. But this has been going on for two years, and it may take much more. It just seems to take up so much bandwidth.
Gotta say, just attempting to read news becomes exhausting and frustrating with the constant over-analysis of every drip and every drop from the Mueller investigation.

More Israeli diplomats using old image to sell "civilian bus"  lie. was this an MFA directive? https://t.co/XIrmgtFZ4I
More deception here as Israel tries to sell lie that this was a "civilian bus" even though video shows it was part of soldier convoy, by using image of a bus fire from near Jerusalem several years ago. https://t.co/6Jb5vn2Biz
Here is an article from 2014 using this image describing a bus fire on road number 1 near Jerusalem 		https://t.co/h7l5TEJ65j
More deception from official Israeli channels regarding this supposed "civilian" bus. The image used by this Israeli diplomatic account is not of the same bus, not from this year and not even near Gaza. But it does have civilians standing beside the bus so they used it. https://t.co/Sk7PVNCsxR
The story of the commuter bus didn't make a whole lot of sense from the outset. When things escalate Israel routinely declares areas around Gaza closed military zones. Why would they let a civilian bus into ATM range?
Here was the message official Israeli channels were putting out regarding this just a few hours ago which is belied by this video https://t.co/Hcs6hjsfUk
It appears from this video that Palestinian militants monitored an Israeli military convoy of soldiers in civilian vehicles then targeted the bus.

@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan If you disagree that the mechanisms for holding Israel to account are broken, perhaps you can show me the ones that are working
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan I agree that is silly. Please let me know which tactics are James Morris approved for Palestinians to use to hold their oppressors to account and I will pass along the feedback.
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan Do you want a movement started by Palestinians, for Palestinian rights, to be not focused on the state denying them their rights?
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan In which "context" is using non-violent economic action in response to human rights abuses and violations of international law not "legit"?
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan Do you oppose civil society efforts to hold russia and china to account?
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan It is because this double standard exists in Israel's favor, and to the detriment of the Palestinians it denies rights to, as a result of state and interstate unwillingness to hold it to account, that a non-state transnational civil society movement has arisen to do so.
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan But these mechanisms are broken when it comes to holding Israel to account. The US is the key reason why, stymieing accountability at the UN with its veto and giving Israel a blank check in military aid.
@JamesDMorris @mehdirhasan You are right that Israel is being treated differently but not in the way that you think and not by BDS practitioners. Human rights violators around the world have been subject to accountability, either imposed by other states or the interstate system. The list is long.

This has to remain central in the discussion because white supremacist ideology spares no one that doesn't fit into their conception of whiteness.

Anyway, Trump is hoping to stir up white rage ahead of the election by trying to connect "terrorism" &amp; immigration. BTW, GW Bush did this too, see Operation Frontline I &amp; II. The right response is not to fact check within his framework but reject his framework all together. Salam
The people of the Mid East are incredibly diverse. We are light and dark skinned. We have brown, blue green and hazel eyes. We have red hair &amp; freckles. Some curly hair, some straight. We are not going to fit into the boxes of your preconceived notions so dont try to put us there
More on that here https://t.co/6G6Wf2WMlT		This is not proof that anyone in the caravan might have middle eastern heritage but rather that it is unknowable and really irrelevant to the fact that they are people seeking refuge and that is all that matters.
And as a factual matter, being from Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador, as many of these people are, does not mean you might not also have middle eastern origins. In fact, there are sizable Palestinian populations in each of these countries, most that immigrated 100 years ago.
Too often we think the right response to such scaremongering is to say "No, this is not true" but the correct response so what if it was true. Even if these human beings happen to be from the Middle East, so what?
But of course Arabs can be decent family men, just like Middle Easterners can be woman, children and babies.

@GigabitesX @RVacchianoSNY We have to stop finding excuses and start finding answers. I'll always be an Eli fan but he just isn't playing like a $20m a year player. At some point we have to deal with that fact.
@GigabitesX @RVacchianoSNY It is an average. In that time his average throw is 4.6 yards. Several QBs with same or *less* time average 6, 8 or even 10.
@GigabitesX @RVacchianoSNY Injuries are part of the game. But even with the players we do have we should be able to create mismatches. LAC has a poor OL too but has 27ppg now. So does Houston 23ppg, Cinci 30ppg, We are at 19.5. We can't keep making excuses.
@GigabitesX @RVacchianoSNY His time to throw through week five is 2.61 which puts him even or ahead of 13 other QBs in the league. Avg last year was 2.5.

@RVacchianoSNY I don't think you need to be Lamar Jackson, but presenting a credible threat to picking up a short 1st down with your legs or changing the launch point fast has become the norm not the exception in today's NFL
@RVacchianoSNY Giants O-line needs work sure, but Eli is getting more time than he had last year, or so it seems to my eye. But few QBs have Elis weapons or his pedigree and put up such poor numbers. The league has changed over his career, very few QBs as immobile as him today.

When people say they want to reevaluate the US-Saudi relationship over this what they are really saying is its has become harder to turn a blind eye to routine and horrific human rights abuses because they knew Khashoggi.
It bears repeating, while it is good that many are horrified at what appears to by the killing of kidnapping of a critical Saudi journalist that is because Khashoggi had the privilege of western connections. Most jailed or killed for dissent don't have that luxury. This isn't new

@lrozen @mls1776 They kidnapped a PM. Arrested and shook down billionaires. They kill dissidents all the time. We dont know yet exactly what happened to Khashoggi but with their history and the backing they believe they have from Trump I am not surprised.
Ugly and disgraceful act. I hope the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice. No community should have to face this. https://t.co/q5GCdhztvQ
The Saudi government killing dissidents is not new, it is actually all too common. What would make Khashoggi's case different, if he was indeed killed, is he was a member of the elite and close to government in the past and he was killed outside KSA borders.

Hi @karendeyoung1 and @reglash , this is a really indefensible sentence:		"Any such reduction would effectively eliminate, for most Palestinians, the “right of return” to land contested with Israel."		https://t.co/UmzgpXIJ2J
Players connected and influential in Right Wing Zionist and Evangelical circles and close to the WH may think they are delegitimizing Palestinian rights, but they only delegitimize themselves and the US in the process. 		End.
Obviously, nothing Trump says or doesn’t say changes the rights Palestinians have. But this thread should give you an idea of how the US position has actually morphed into the Israeli position over time, why and who the key players were.
The Trump Admin is reported to be preparing an announcement to “take the right of return off the table” by stating some new policy toward Palestinian refugees.
Yesterday, at an FDD event, Nikki Haley says any future US support for UNRWA would be contingent on “if they actually change the number of refugees to an accurate account” https://t.co/KggsTG5EF4
Fast forward to July 2018 and ACLJ gets its FOIA back with the report which they claim exposes the U.N. agency’s fraudulent over-reporting on the number of Palestinian “refugees.”
One month later, Tillerson was fired sitting on the toilet and replaced by Pompeo
Tillerson made comments in a Amman press conference about the need to sustainably support UNRWA, sounding a different tone than Trump, Haley et al https://t.co/ffwpejxJAK
Meanwhile, then Secretary of State Tillerson, who was reportedly left out of the decision making here, seemed to be on a different page, arguing to keep up UNRWA support.
Sekulow’s group, the ACLJ https://t.co/MdQWf1exbX
OK, here is where it gets more interesting. Remember that 2012 law for a State Department report on the numbers of refugees? Well, on Feb 5th 2018 a group decided to file a FOIA to get that report. Which group?
Then, also from FP, an email from Greenblatt’s aide on the 18th says the White House was mulling dissolving UNRWA into UNHCR, i.e. Netanyahu’s proposal. https://t.co/jnqk4FrzkZ
Jan 16th, the State Dept announced its first stage major cuts to UNRWA funding
@ForeignPolicy reported leaked emails recently showing that Jared Kushner wrote this to the WH Mideast team that includes Jason Greenblatt on Jan 11, four days after Netanyahu’s comments. https://t.co/B9kTX0pM8G
Then a few days later, on Jan 7th, Netanyahu said this, note the language https://t.co/yy7xpY0SMN
Then, also on Jan 2, Haley said this https://t.co/KfasThyWvK
Trump tweeted this on Jan 2nd.		https://t.co/l5GKPGtJCZ?
Angry at the global rejection, the Trump Admin began speaking more intensely in January 2018 about cutting aid that helps Palestinians, including money to UNRWA.
A few months down the line, it became clear Trump would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In December 2017 he did so and the world reacted with disgust and rejection both in the UN Security Council and General Assembly.
It was right around this time that Israel began to bang the UNRWA drum more aggressively. The Israeli PM tweeted this: https://t.co/x4bNyHap7K
Now fast forward to last summer when self-described “messianic Jew” Jay Sekulow, who runs a legal outfit called ACLJ founded by Pat Roberston to do lawfare for Evangelicals, became a key face of Trump’s legal defense team. We’ll return to him later.
But this common sense idea has not prevented some right-wing Zionist groups from trying to sell it as a revealing expose of massive corruption at UNRWA.
Obviously, anyone with a basic sense of math and biology concepts understands that the number of living survivors of ethnic cleansing 70 years ago has dwindled over time.
It was also an attempt to take the single most important issue “off the table” by pretending it doesn’t really exist.
This was aimed at advancing the Israeli “argument” that most Palestinian refugees are “fake” in the hopes of continuing to evade responsibility for a stateless population that exists today because of their longstanding refusal to repatriate.
Fast forward 65 years to 2012 when an Israeli Likud MK, in coordination with the Israeli Govt, worked w/ AIPAC &amp; then US Senator Mark Kirk to pass legislation demanding the State Dept report to Congress how many UNRWA refugees were alive in 1948 vs how many were their descendants
The US, which continued to support Israel despite its early dismay at its refusal to repatriate, became the single largest donor to UNRWA and continued to be.
From 1949 through Arab-Palestinian-Israel negotiations over time, refugees became a final status issue to be resolved in a final agreement. In the meantime, the holding pattern held.
Over time, the stateless population of Palestinian refugees grew and the condition of statelessness was passed down to the next generation as Israel continued to refuse repatriation.
From that point forward, things remained in a holding pattern. Israel refused repatriation responsibilities. The US and International Community failed to impose it on them and UNRWA continued to meet the refugees basic needs.
In other words, UNRWA was created to address the immediate needs of a crisis that both the US and the international community recognized Israel had a major responsibility to solve but was refusing to.
UNGA 302 made clear that the humanitarian assistance was a necessity due to need but not intended to prejudice the rights of refugees to repatriation.
By December of that year the UNGA, with US support, passed resolution 302 recognizing the urgency of preventing “conditions of starvation and distress among” Palestinian refugees and setting up an agency to address this. That agency was UNRWA.
While all this was going on, more Palestinian refugees were being created and others were languishing in camps where a humanitarian crisis was exploding. Something had to be done to meet those very real needs until repatriation was possible
but Israel continued to refuse even though the US threatened it would “regretfully be forced to the conclusion that a revision of its attitude toward Israel has become unavoidable”.
In late May 1949, the US told Israel it expected it to accept the principle of “substantial repatriation and the immediate beginnings of repatriation” ...
Israel’s attitude toward the Palestinian refugees was that they were someone else’s problem and they refused to permit repatriation. This caused the first crisis in US-Israel relations. This was President Truman’s attitude toward Israel’s attitude: https://t.co/PPz6pfZrqD
The refugee crisis was massive and before the end of the war the UNGA passed Resolution 194 which established a Conciliation Committee to settle issues between Israel and the Arab states, including refugee repatriation. The US supported this resolution.
That population of ~800K was some 2/3rds of Palestine’s Arab population. They sought refuge in neighboring states/territories and lived in very difficult conditions awaiting repatriation.
From 1947-1949, the majority of the native inhabitants of Palestine were depopulated, forcibly expelled or fled during war and then forcibly denied return by the Israeli military.
This represents a significant shift in US policy toward the Palestinian refugee issue. While it has always been more pro-Israel than pro-International Law or Human rights, the US position is now becoming the Israeli position.
THREAD: The Trump Administration is reportedly going to slash funding to UNRWA and force it to either disband or change the way it defines Palestinian refugees. This is will be a long thread that helps explain how we got here.

It is far more convenient for Liberal Zionists to pretended the WB settler state is corrupting Israel than to acknowledge the corruption has been present at the foundation of the state.
And it is ass backwards. The "West Bank model" was very literally imported into the West Bank from pre-67 Israel where "emergency regulations" ruled from 1948-66, adopted from British colonialism, and brought to the WB after belligerent acquisition. https://t.co/z9tsyLWj9W

Who is allowed to do the remembering and what is allowed to be remembered sets the terms for what legacy remains years into the future. Then years later, maybe decades or centuries, people are shocked to learn they've been walking past the statue of a genociare or slaveowner.
Frequently people are shocked to learn of the deeply problematic histories of people that buildings are named after or statues are built. That is a result of an erasure or rewriting of that person's history that happens, in good part, upon their death and in "remembrances".

For example, the US Declaration of independence said "all men are created equal... with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" but our laws permitted slavery and overt discrimination.
And this by Fuchs is deliberate obfuscation that goes unchallenged. There is no right to "equality" before the law in Israel. The state considers equality a threat to its existence. The declaration of independence is not law. https://t.co/1vIfAZhoRQ
How do your write a piece on this and not include and interview or analysis by Palestinian citizens of Israel who are directly targeted by this bill?

@ArabCenterWDC If Arab dictators cozy up to Israel, it is not because their people support it but rather because they, like the Israeli state, have a shared interest in silencing dissent and denying human rights.
@ArabCenterWDC The bottom line from this poll is that Arab publics oppose relations with Israel while it continues to stand on the necks of Palestinians. This of course runs contrary to all of the baloney we hear about Trump's Ultimate Deal and the New Middle East.
@ArabCenterWDC The reasons for opposing recognition of Israel are overwhelmingly Israeli policies toward Palestinians and other Arabs. https://t.co/f45oYGoxbB
@ArabCenterWDC There is also overwhelming opposition by respondents to the idea of their country recognizing Israel https://t.co/PFbNmsUoWF
@ArabCenterWDC Respondents also overwhelmingly view the Palestinian cause as a cause that concerns all Arabs and not just Palestinians https://t.co/t379tZ6Trx

@DanielBShapiro Yet another mischaracterization. It takes no position on a number states just rights.
Hey @Twitter seems like someone is trying to hack into my account.
@DanielBShapiro BDS is a set of tactics for accountability for human rights denial. The attempt to mischaracterize it is motivated by desire to assure impunity for Israel's human rights violations.
@DanielBShapiro Not true. Human rights are not mutually exclusive, never have been, never need to be.
