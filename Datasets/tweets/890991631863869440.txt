@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews My pleasure, thanks for engaging with civility, a rarity in the twitter verse.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews You might be right, no one asked for Fred trumps taxes though.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews I don‚Äôt care how much they make, but I sure as shit want to know where they made it. It‚Äôs not about amounts it‚Äôs about sources and potential conflicts of interest. Do you not get that?
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Actually it was years before that taking out a full page ad in the NYT, calling for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, who were innocent BTW.		What did any of that have to do with his ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù?
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews 5 minutes ago it was a 50 year old tradition, now it‚Äôs pandering? 		He became a politician the second he started chasing Obama‚Äôs birth certificate.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews No need to dig around, there‚Äôs a former (Republican) FBI director on the case.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Ok, doesn‚Äôt change my statement that we were closer to ww3 in the 80s than in 2018.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Hillary did it, and apparently she‚Äôs the devil incarnate.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Fully aware, but why break with that tradition if you have nothing to hide?
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews No one was expecting him to start ww3. What we were expecting was. I know you fucked with our elections. That shit won‚Äôt stand. We‚Äôre going to slap you with more economics sanctions. Reagan got tough with the Russians and that‚Äôs when ww3 was an actual possibility.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews That one year was 3 pages, leaked by his own camp in an attempt to make that question go away. No one knows if they are even real.
@FDRLST I look forward to your next story about all of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs erroneous tweets.

@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews That is just a conspiracy theory?
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Ok fair enough. Do you believe in the coincidence that trump just duplicated himself to Putin on a world stage. That‚Äôs he‚Äôs balls deep in Dept to Russian state banks, that he refuses to release his taxes. That verifiable intelligence has him compromised.

@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Ahh so they‚Äôre all brainwashed in college? How did the majority of Congress all escape this indoctrination? Dude, your entering into tinfoil hat territory.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews OK, how did they settle on that agenda? How did the tens of thousands of writers, reporters, editors, producers and fact checkers who all work for different companies, in different locations determine this agenda? Was there some secret meeting where they all got their orders?
@people_are_nuts @ABC he conveniently forgot to mention it to Hannity the night before. Hannity forgot to ask.
@Grizzly_Stevens @McAllisterDen @FoxNews Granted clicks, ratings and retweets are far more important than they should be, but you speak of MSM like its one entity. They are separate publications, websites, channels. All with different personnel, different editors. The idea they are all in cahoots is ludicrous.

@ReAlign604 @RealJamesWoods in a plea deal where prosecutors said they "uncovered no evidence" that Awan "violated federal law with respect to the House computer systems."		Read the article, not just the headline.
@1StepTowardZero @IngrahamAngle It's beyond unforced errors. It's a model of incompetence. Partly fueled by the fact that no one competent wants to work for him. So you're left with the D team.
@1StepTowardZero @IngrahamAngle I agree the fringe left voice is getting louder, but thats only a reaction to fringe right getting louder. As far as delivery, we have to wait for Nov for that. 		It's not like the GOP is unified. You have both houses and managed to barely squeek out the tax bill.
@1StepTowardZero @IngrahamAngle I know all about the page 6 headlines. I grew up in New York. We've known he was a con artist for decades. It's why he lost his hometown by a staggering margin. Even Walter Mondale managed to win his home state.		I appreciate your view though.

@bob1333 @GOP No, this policy has been going on for a few weeks. THIS POLICY.
@bob1333 @GOP ‚ÄúReunite them with there families‚Äù and ‚Äúdeal with the violence in the region‚Äù sounds like petty sound policy to me. Your boy Trump should take a lesson.
@bob1333 @GOP Why are you arguing trumps policy by invoking people that are not the current president? They didn‚Äôt separate family‚Äôs, that‚Äôs all Trump.
@bob1333 @GOP There is no video
@bob1333 @GOP Are you trying to argue with me in code?
@bob1333 @GOP Tough to argue with that, Bob. üôÑ
@bob1333 @GOP Yeah it does, some crimes are probably indicative that they are shitty parents. Trying to sneak into the USA so their kids can have a better life would not be one of those crimes.
@bob1333 @GOP That is horrible, it really is and yet still completely immaterial to what is happening at the border.
@bob1333 @GOP No Bob, I haven‚Äôt. Happy? It‚Äôs immaterial to the fact that our shit head in chief made an atrocious policy decision, that is completely unnecessary. All the American parents in jail have absolutely zero to do with that.
@bob1333 @GOP Tons? For misdemeanors? Highly unlikely.
@bob1333 @GOP This is ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù at its finest. You ignore the atrocious because of other hypothetical atrocities.
@bob1333 @GOP Well it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a misdemeanor, and they are being thrown in cages. So again I ask you how many American parents do you know that were separated from their children because the committed a misdemeanor ?
@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Well that makes one of you that thinks that, because even she knows it was fucking disaster.
