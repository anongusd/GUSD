@jordanbpeterson https://t.co/pGPN5c8DU6 Excellent article. Would love to either watch a video or live cast with your commentary. Well worth the read.
@Trumpytheclown @StefanMolyneux Also "Hispanics" are not really a race. It's a group of people all speak Spanish but have different races mixed in.
@Trumpytheclown @StefanMolyneux No, what I said was that if you look at at IQ statistics in any race, you will find a bell curve distribution. And yes I agree with him and you, fuck PC. What I was trying to say is that he should not generalize and say: all Hispanics have low IQ. Instead say, more likely low IQ.
@StefanMolyneux I agree with almost everything you say, especially on IQ, but try not to generalize. I happen to be a Hispanic man with high IQ and a doctorate degree. Remember all racial populations will have bell curves of their own.

@StefanMolyneux It's not the government. It is the owners of private central banks.

@jordanbpeterson The answer to that question is so complex... you're on the right track as far as I'm concerned. Look into the current central banking system and how FIAT money is made and works and you will find some answers as to why.

@Cernovich Increasing bureaucracy and government meddling in healthcare is what increases cost. Not the front line workers.
@JackPosobiec It will not stop there. It is very hard not to be doom and gloom about it all.
@Cernovich Dude, honestly stay with political commentary and current events. Loved your book Hoaxed. But nurses assuming the role of doctors? No.
@Kevin_Shipp Seemed to me he did not really look into what the architects and engineers have published regarding 9/11. As far as MB, maybe politics ? He may have friends there.
@RubinReport @Ocasio2018 Ask the Russians how it turned out for them.
@AriFleischer The problem is you are arguing logically and with facts. In a rational, sensible world that would be the best approach. But unfortunately we do not live in that world anymore. We live in a world of partisan propaganda where both sides think they are always right.
@KurtSchlichter Yes definitely!
@KurtSchlichter @ArthurSchwartz I was having a discussion with a democrat friend of mine today, the philosophical divide itself is so vast it's hard to reconcile, that is, without considering all the political animosity from both sides. I suggested a possible split into 2 countries, he actually agreed with me!
