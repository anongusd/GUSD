@BucSpur31 @SarahPalinUSA @usminority @DineshDSouza Seems like Robert Byrd got a pass for being a former Grand Kleagle in the KKK and Hillary Clinton looked up to him as a mentor. Two years ago DNC emails were hacked and they revealed that they referred to Hispanics as taco boats and needy.
@BucSpur31 @SarahPalinUSA @usminority @DineshDSouza l've heard that many voted for Obama because of white guilt, meaning they felt bad for the injustices towards blacks in the past, so they voted for him to prove that they weren't racist. Bush and other Republicans screwed up so badly it didn't matter who won the nomination.
