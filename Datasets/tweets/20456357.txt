"All we want is the chance to compete fairly," said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper.		#RFANEC
In 2016, China was our third-leading export market, but the tariffs in 2017 stopped exports for much of the year.		#RFANEC
The U.S. #ethanol industry has also dealt with “a wave of protectionism,” hampering exports to the EU, Peru, Brazil and China. 		#RFANEC
“Anyone arguing that small refiner waivers didn’t cause demand destruction needs to have their head examined!” 		#RFANEC
As result of SREs, 2018 domestic ethanol consumption is estimated at 14.3 billion gal—400 gal less than EIA projected. “That’s the first annual decrease in domestic ethanol consumption since the drought-ravaged year of 2012.”		#RFANEC

“The effect of these refinery bailouts was devastating to the domestic ethanol market,” causing a flood of surplus #RINs, a collapse of RIN prices and demand destruction in physical markets.		#RFANEC
These hardship SRE waivers were also issued to large oil co’s like Chevron and ExxonMobil. “If that’s ‘economic hardship,’ sign me up!” 		#RFANEC
“In the end, more than 21 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel sold in 2016 and 2017 escaped a renewable fuel blending obligation.”		#RFANEC
By contrast, Pruitt approved 19 SREs for 2016 #RFS and 29 SREs for 2017 #RFS. “And not a single petition reviewed by EPA during Pruitt’s tenure was denied.”		#RFANEC
Under previous administration, just 7 SREs granted in 2015, while 7 were denied or declared ineligible. 		#RFANEC
--Former EPA Administrator Pruitt’s “abuse of the small refiner waiver provision was unprecedented.” The waivers were created IF companies could provide ‘disproportionate economic hardship.’		#RFANEC
--#Ethanol saves consumers $$ at the pump. According to American Journal of Agricultural Economics, #ethanol consumption under RFS saves U.S. almost $18 billion/yr in gasoline expenses.		#RFANEC
--#Ethanol displaced the need for an amount of gasoline refined from 594 million barrels of crude oil and helped reduce our net dependence on imported petroleum to just 14%--the lowest rate in nearly 60 years.		#RFANEC

“We certainly see no rationale for going below 15 billion gallons” for conventional biofuels like corn ethanol post-2022, RFA President Geoff Cooper said in response to a question.
“RFA strongly believes the RFS can work in concert with—not in conflict with—a high-octane fuel requirement,” Cooper testified to @HouseCommerce.
By eliminating the RFS for conventional biofuels, “…the draft bill would destabilize the considerable progress our nation has made toward greater energy security, economic vitality, and environmental health,” Cooper testified to @HouseCommerce.
“We simply cannot support eliminating the RFS program, as the draft envisions, without a much stronger signal to the market that ethanol’s role in our fuel supply will continue to grow,” said Cooper.
“As currently drafted, however, RFA cannot support the proposal because it falls short of providing the future market certainty and clear growth trajectory our industry needs,” said Cooper.
“The draft legislation we are here to discuss today represents an important first step in the debate about future fuels policy,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper in testimony before @HouseCommerce.

What does RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper think of the final 2019 #RFS rule? Listen to his interview with @EnergyAgNews: https://t.co/4yOA5zOyLa
Check out this interview with @USDA radio and RFA CEO Geoff Cooper on expanded feedstocks to help meet #RFS requirements: https://t.co/WCtqC10Exv
The EPA must prove it will enforce the RFS, said RFA CEO Geoff Cooper. “The reason we’re concerned about that is we’ve seen here in the past few years, the numbers published by EPA end up not being real because they are undermined by small refinery exemptions," he said. https://t.co/fjnI6JqIXW
RFA CEO Geoff Cooper said he's hopeful that the agency's lack of accounting for waivers is good for biofuels. "Hopefully, that means EPA is not intending to issue any small refiner waivers at all in 2019 because it knows there is no rationale or basis for doing so," he said. https://t.co/c06WgUAqB5
. Full release here: https://t.co/nme3hnN0WL
“We urge @EPAAWheeler to faithfully and strictly enforce the 15-billion-gallon conventional renewable fuel requirement in 2019, rather than allowing the standard to be eroded through the use of clandestine small refiner waivers as former Administrator Pruitt did," RFA CEO Cooper.

It's #WorldFoodDay. Fun fact about corn-based #ethanol: Ethanol production uses only the starch in the grain; the remaining protein, fat and fiber returns to animal feed. Plus, on net basis, U.S. #ethanol industry used less than 3% of global grain supplies in 2017.

(1/9) There has been a lot of talk about E15 and smog and most of it is misinformed and just plain wrong.  		Today, we are going to set the record straight.  		Check out this blog from our CEO, Geoff Cooper: https://t.co/HYlCkwoBk6 https://t.co/uL9jdQVdFt
(2/9) Earlier this week, President Trump announced the EPA will begin the process to allow year-round sales of E15. https://t.co/coep734eWl
(3/9) Some media coverage keeps getting it WRONG by suggesting the current restriction on summertime E15 sales stems from concerns about smog. https://t.co/NOJFyPJdf0
(4/9) Here are the facts:	1. E15 is less volatile than today’s standard E10 gasoline.
(5/9) Facts (cont)	2. A study in the journal Energy a few years ago shows that E15 reduces smog-forming emissions. https://t.co/j4CkMRhsxY
(6/9) Facts (cont)	3. Allowing E15 to be sold in the summertime would improve air quality by lessening emissions of key pollutants that can lead to ground-level ozone formation.
(7/9) The real reason retailers have been unable to sell E15 in the summertime? 		BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE AND OUTDATED REGULATIONS. 		The EPA developed regulations for E10 nearly 30 years ago and they never contemplated blends containing more than 10% ethanol.
(8/9) President Trump’s directive simply ensures the same regulations that apply to E10 also apply to E15. https://t.co/9saZR2awV4

Important to know ahead of today's #E15 announcement: There is no mandate to use E15. We simply want consumers to have more choices at the pump. The lack of the E15 RVP waiver is the single largest impediment to rapid expansion of E15 and higher ethanol blends. #TheMoreYouKnow

Oh, the irony. @AFPMonline &amp; Ms. Koch sent August letter asking CRS to remove @ScottIrwinUI from #RFS study group, saying he cannot be considered “impartial,” “objective,” or “dispassionate.” Now they are showering praise on him for analysis that supposedly suits their purposes.
That difference amounts to about 700 million gallons of ethanol demand annualized—how can anyone argue that isn’t demand destruction?
In January, EIA projected the annual blend rate would be 10.26% for 2018 and FAPRI projected it would be 10.29%. But since February, when news of the SREs started spreading, the blend rate has averaged just 9.85%.
Because the purpose of the RFS was to drive growth in renewable fuel use yr after yr, the proper comparison is the current blend rate versus what the blend rate would have been in the absence of the SREs. https://t.co/H4Vs8TcpsV

Many parts of the country cannot access 15% ethanol during the summer months, this needs to change. Listen to @ethanolbob interview with @agritalk on the subject here: https://t.co/NeEBlBhAM3
"We're still working hard to make sure those waivers are addressed and year-round E15" is done.
"They're in effect requiring EPA to follow a statute that has already passed."
If there are more small refiner waivers, they need to reallocated before final annual RFS volume. Bill intro'd last week by Reps. Young and Peterson would require reallocation.
"It's a shame we have to go to the courts to get to this information," but this EPA hasn't been very forthcoming.
"Last week, we also filed again with a number of other groups, a lawsuit under the FOIA because our efforts to get information on these waivers have been met with silence. We have to go to the courts just to get basic information on the waivers."
On status of numerous small refiner waiver lawsuits, "these are companies that are highly profitable that don't need waivers."
"Oil companies today are printing money....Meanwhile farmers, bc of trade policies...are having to sell commodities below the cost of production."
Do refiners still want RIN exports to count towards domestic obligation? "Depends on who you ask," said @ethanolbob. "The refiners can't even agree on what they want...We're held up in this limbo bc refiners can't decide what else they want."
RIN prices were 80 cts and they're now 20 cts and below. "They got it bc Scott Pruitt's demand destruction campaign had the intended effect."
Refiners wanted cheaper RINs, said @ChipFlory. They got that.
"When you add it up, you're looking at more than 3 billion gallons of biofuels demand that Scott Pruitt just gave to refiners. "The heck with a deal."
"Nobody came to us and said we're going to grant all these waivers and we're going to do something to help you." There has been more than 2.25 billion gallons of demand destruction so far.
"What is being lost in that equation, however, is that former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt already gave refiners their end of the deal" in the form of small refiner waivers.
"Indeed, when Trump says get it done, they're still looking for this elusive win, win. The guy who wrote the Art of the Deal is thinking there's got to be a deal here" for both refiners and ethanol producers and farmers.
"I think we're going to get it done," said @ethanolbob on year-round E15.
"EPA though is not moving on addressing those regulations. They continue to drag their feet. They continue to look for ways to help refiners....as if refiners need more help from this administration."
"Apparently President Trump's EPA isn't listening to him" re: why E15 is not available year-round yet.

In 2017, ethanol displaced an amount of gasoline refined from 560 million bbls of crude oil—more than the volume imported annually from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. #themoreyouknow
As this chart shows, petroleum import dependence would have been 27% without 15.8 billion gallons of #ethanol in 2017. #themoreyouknow https://t.co/VksBgWoBzA
Among numerous benefits, #ethanol is helping to make the U.S. more energy secure. The U.S. relied on imports to meet 60% of its petroleum needs in 2005. Growth in ethanol helped reduce our reliance on imports to just 20% in 2017. #themoreyouknow

Be sure to listen in on Bob Dinneen's interview with @MikeAdamsAg “Adams on Agriculture” this AM where @ethanolbob talked about our FOIA-related lawsuit filed last week on the small refiner #RFS waivers: https://t.co/2VZuljZoC1
"We're going to make sure ultimately that the law is upheld and that farmers have this important value-added market," said @ethanolbob.
"It's time for the administration to step up and do something for farmers, do something for consumers....Stop approving these waivers so easily and put this program back on track."
If the administration doesn't change its plans to approve small refiner waivers, the final #RFS numbers will be "meaningless," @ethanolbob says. "There can't possibly be a hardship for a lower priced, higher octane fuel....What in the world is the administration afraid of?"
"The administration needs to send a signal that it's going to help the ethanol industry grow....the impact isn't going to be immediate. It's not going to make up for the 2.25 billion gallons of lost demand, but it will send a signal....that's all we're asking."
Impact on year-round #E15 sales "would be small for a while, but it would send an important signal that this administration is committed to growing this market."
"That is utter nonsense" on the need for a deal on year-round #E15.
On year-round #E15 sales, "I hope it's true" on a decision this week. But it shouldn't be part of a deal. Refiners have already gotten what they want, @ethanolbob said. "My view is they've gotten theirs. It's time for farmers to get something to make up for demand destruction..."
"You take out 2.25 billion gallons of biofuels demand...and there is going to be an impact," said @ethanolbob.
"You have analysis showing the damage being done by these waivers," says @MikeAdamsAg.
In the 10th circuit, we did challenge a couple of the waivers that have been granted. The schedule for oral arguments and briefings not yet complete. "We hope to have a decision by next spring" under the 10th circuit.
No info on what criteria for those who have received waivers or reallocation plan, said @ethanolbob. It is "destructing demand...and we think makes a mockery of an important renewable energy program this country has had for more than a dozen years."
"Andy Wheeler has indeed acknowledged the number of waivers that has been granted," but no info to whom they were given or the criteria. "This is still a process cloaked in secrecy."
We went through #FOIA process "and got nothing but the Heisman" from EPA. "We were forced to go to court. It was a really sad statement" to have to go to court, said @ethanolbob.
EPA "was doing all of this secretly....it was distorting the market."
"For months, as we heard about waivers being issued by the EPA to various companies, we along with several others were just seeking information from the agency about who they were...," said @ethanolbob.

".@EPA has been looking for creative ways to have this program work better and more efficiently for refiners but walked away from making sure it works for farmers and consumers" said @ethanolbob
"We want the opportunity to sell E15 year round. It's not a requirement or subsidy but give consumers the option. A deal was made with refineries, its time to hit the reset button and reset the allocation year to make sure the farmers are getting something out of it" -@ethanolbob
"In the middle of September we will see a dramatic increase in E15 sales. Marketers are able to resume blending that higher octane product. Exports continue to grow. We will break export record over 60 countries across the globe."
"E15 continues to increase, very slowly. Marketers that do make changes necessary to allow that to happen are seeing increase sales &amp; they are frustrated, they give the consumers the opportunity and the summer months come and they have to take it away from them" says @ethanolbob
"These numbers have to mean something, if EPA issues waiver after waiver they are destructing demand. @EPA is more concerned about getting something done on schedule versus getting it done right. Consumers and farmers pay the price for that."

Also talking about @ethanolbob being a senior strategic adviser. "Let's give some new enthusiasm and younger energy to take over at the helm." Come October, Geoff Cooper will take over as president and CEO.
Impression of @EPAAWheeler? "I've known him for 25 years. He's a solid professional," said @ethanolbob
"It was just a gift to refiners that have refused to embrace this program" on small refiner waivers. "At some point, Donald Trump's EPA needs to realize that consumers need a break. Farmers need break....Refiners do not need another break from this administration."
On small refiner waivers, EPA has now 49 granted for 2016 and 2017, which totals 2.25 billion gallons. "That's ridiculous."
"The president wants it, it benefits consumers, farmers who are taking it on the chin are needing it, so what is holding up EPA?" said @ethanolbob.
"Consumers are given the option of the higher octane, lower priced fuel, which E15 or any higher blend would be, they are going to opt for that."
Scott Pruitt destructed 2.2 billion gallons of biofuel demand in giving small refiner waivers. Year-round E15 approval should not be part of a deal, said @ethanolbob. "What in the world is taking EPA so long to do it?" on year-round E15.
I have heard @EPAAWheeler said EPA didn't have legal authority to do. "Our analysis says they absolutely have the legal authority," said @ethanolbob.
Wheeler "seems to be backtracking a little bit," says @ethanolbob on @agritalk.

“If Administrator Wheeler is truly interested in reaching out to farmers harmed by Scott Pruitt’s small refiner waiver fire sale, he’s got to do more than come to the Midwest and talk. He’s got to take action,” said @ethanolbob.
In Iowa recently, Trump said his administration was “very close” to approving year-round E15. “The EPA is dragging its feet. Tell Administrator Wheeler: It’s time to deliver on E15,” the 2nd ad says. #IWantMyE15

Robust export markets are more important now than ever before, as actions by EPA are undermining domestic ethanol demand. More here: https://t.co/EcMFNfP9Ao https://t.co/X4JSaTe6H4
#Ethanol exports surged to 151.5 mg in June, up 65% from May! Brazil and Canada were top markets. Halfway thru 2018, exports stood at 928 mg! Get the full report later today on RFA’s blog.
And follow @fuelinggood, who is heading to Sturgis for lots of #ethanol-related events. Among them, @EthanolRFA will be sponsoring free fuel happy hours, where riders can receive a free tank of 10% ethanol. More details here:  https://t.co/RqjCu6mel2 https://t.co/JVEyydrgQ3

"Very excited about opportunity" to be the next RFA President and CEO, Cooper says.
"We don't have any confidence as an industry that 15 billion gallons means 15 billion gallons" as a result of small refiner waiver exemptions and demand destruction.
Mr. Wheeler did say he wants the RVO volumes to be solid and firm, but on other hand, he said he's not considering changes to way we're administering small refiner exemptions.
"Our assumption was this deal had been abandoned, but it sounds like this is coming out of the freezer" and that's troubling to us.
If you remember, a lot of talk about cutting a deal started with Sen. Cruz and Toomey and arguing that RFS needed reform. Part of that discussion was a cap on RIN prices. "That deal had been put on ice and effectively killed in June," after discussion between Trump and Perdue.
"Our position has been there's no need for a deal. The refiners have gotten exactly what they wanted," since they wanted low RIN prices. Today RINs are at 19 cts, a five-year low. Refiners wanted this. "They got their part of the deal. When do we get ours?"
"We were very encouraged" by Trump's comments, said Cooper.
"We continue to press very hard on fixing that barrier" that prevents year-round sales of E15.
"We are trying to reconcile those two statements" from President and Acting EPA Administrator Wheeler, said Geoff Cooper.

The summer RVP barrier banning E15 would be better described as a “fuel monopoly tax.” That unnecessary “tax” will cost American families $6 billion this year—or $80 per household! #IWantMyE15
Good morning! Unfortunately, beginning today through mid-September, retailers in much of the country won't be able to sell #E15, denying consumers a lower-cost, higher octane fuel. We don't think that's fair. Join us NOW and let @EPA  know you want year-round #E15! #IWantMyE15

RT @racheldgantz: In q&amp;a, @ethanolbob asks for a full lifecycle analysis for all fuels.
RT @racheldgantz: "We believe high octane fuels...represent a tremendous opportunity"--@ethanolbob
We believe a combination of technologies with #ethanol could be the answer, so long as there is a level playing field. Together we can work to increase efficiencies and reduce costs for consumers.  It is not one or the other.  -@ethanolbob
(2/2) Compliance values for all technologies should be based on full direct well-to-wheels lifecycle emissions would allow for “apples-to-apples” treatment of the GHG emissions. - @ethanolbob
(1/2) Today, for example, EVs are effectively treated as “zero emission” vehicles because the upstream source of the electricity is not considered.  That’s not only inaccurate, it provides EVs with an incentive relative to other de-carbonization technologies. - @ethanolbob
The #ethanol industry recognizes a broad array of EV technologies are on the horizon; &amp; we want them to succeed. We DO NOT see EVs as a threat.  Rather, we see EVs as fellow travelers on our road toward energy independence and de-carbonization. -@ethanolbob
This Committee has always led when it comes to transformative energy policy.  The #RFS, for example, remains a beacon of success that is being emulated as other countries seek to expand their production &amp; use of renewable fuels. -@ethanolbob
"#Ethanol is the lowest cost &amp; cleanest source of octane on the planet, and research has shown that a mid-level ethanol blend could deliver tremendous efficiency benefits if used in an optimized engine." -@ethanolbob
"Liquid fuels and internal combustion engines will continue to drive America for decades to come; and, despite what you may hear, these are not fully mature technologies.  Plenty of room remains for the improved performance of both." -@ethanolbob
