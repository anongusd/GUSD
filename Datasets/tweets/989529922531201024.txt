@Icouldbeanybody There's been two corporate parties in America for decades. Pelosi is part of the one who happens to be more socially progressive. Yeah, I hope there is a red wave in America - of social democratic candidates who destroy their opponents in elections.

@RepublicanWave @WhiteHouse Trump represents imperialistic ideals of a nation that is broken by its past. Democrats don't care, but neither do Republicans. They're both more concerned about their financial ties and power.

@Amy18748078 @mitchellvii I, FYI, said socialistIC. They're a social democracy. Socialism by definition includes many things Norway has. Norway has many socialist characteristics, while not being socialist.
@Amy18748078 @mitchellvii Those places aren't libertarian leftist societies. Those were/are real authoritarian shitholes. If places like Norway can at the very least be socialistic, we can have a socialist society that favors the people. The people were exploited by evil in your stated cases.
@Amy18748078 @mitchellvii The over 30,000 people who "disappeared" under his leadership.
@Amy18748078 @mitchellvii So you think lives are worth less than economic growth that eventually will flounder due to less regulation?
@Amy18748078 @mitchellvii You're disregarding the fact that we're the ones who screwed the region up. We purport to be the protectors of democracy, but, for example, we toppled the government in Chile and installed a dictator; Augusto Pinochet. I recommend giving this a read - https://t.co/StZ9dPtFss
@mitchellvii Because Mexico and most of Central America is a shithole, due in part to our past aggression towards their democratically elected left-wing governments (where applicable), and this is what we get. What goes around comes around.

@SenThomTillis @CIA Because of her experience in torture?
@EricStacy @ctrnr66 @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump And for my last rebuttal to your comment, paid vacation time actually increases people's happiness and work ethic. That's why places like Denmark are thriving and people here don't want to get jobs. They're unsatisfied.
@EricStacy @ctrnr66 @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump Free college should be something all Americans have an opportunity to use. Our educational system is in shambles, yet when we don't educate our people, the system is permanently broken unless we provide the means to fix it, which we haven't.
@EricStacy @ctrnr66 @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump Oh, wait, there's more. I don't see why a mother shouldn't get paid maternity leave. Work isn't a person's only responsibility. Republicans claim they stand for family values, yet they don't pass measures that guarantee pay for women who have to take care of kids.
@EricStacy @ctrnr66 @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump 2/2 They're only paying for a small tax increase. So Venezuela isn't really relevant when it comes to seeing and how it works, because they relied on the capital of their oil. They had socialist ideals, but relied on a capitalist market.
@EricStacy @ctrnr66 @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump They relied on oil where most countries that favor socialism don't. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland. Places like that don't rely on their oil for cash. And actually having universal healthcare would let people keep more money since they're not paying premiums and 1/2
@EricStacy @keanothedog @Roland_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump More jobs are available because Trump embraced the left-wing idea of tariffs. Now, the tariff's he's imposed are WAY too much. But they'd be effective if they were a bit less. So for once, I'll agree with most of what a Republican says. Though, Obama did create more jobs.
@WLBDallas @SenCortezMasto @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump She obviously isn't.
@realDonaldTrump The US violated the deal first by putting sanctions on Iran. So we were the ones misbehaving. Your ignorance and blindness is unsettling.
@UCLAdonF @WranglerDanger @realDonaldTrump But they're not enforcing any of it, so it is of little relevance.
@SenCortezMasto @SenSchumer Senator, it doesn't trample states' rights. It tramples the right of safety the American people have. It is not a waste of taxpayer dollars. It's the best thing we could do with our nuclear waste.

@realDonaldTrump @WranglerDanger You don't know what it has to do with then.
@WranglerDanger @Marko51651681 @misterLe27 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Well, for one you don't want single-payer healthcare. Which would actually make costs cheaper. You don't want free college. You don't support an expansion of welfare. And no, I'm not going to call you names. Nobody who can debate does that.
@TimRunsHisMouth They didn't say he was missing. Go look at the title of the article.
@LMWatsonNV @DeanHeller I'm not paid by anyone. You just don't have a point to counter with. Have a nice day.
@Marko51651681 @misterLe27 @WranglerDanger @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because Republicans share a lot of their Corporatist ideology.
@LMWatsonNV @DeanHeller Yes. The point of my reply was that I see how disappointed his constituents are and I don't see why they'd support him.
@Marko51651681 @misterLe27 @WranglerDanger @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Maybe they won't. But they haven't learned their lesson quite yet. Let them lose a few key races amd they'll learn.
@misterLe27 @WranglerDanger @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Plus she said wants us in NAFTA ans the TPP, which are both disastrous. That's what got Trump his win.
@misterLe27 @WranglerDanger @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump She was a corporate shill, just like most of the Democratic Party.
@JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Except they didn't say that, Jack. Go read their story.
@WranglerDanger @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump I doubt that. While Republicans may narrowly keep hold of the Senate, I give Trump a 40/60 chance of winning, if the Democrats even put a good candidate up for election.
@iluminatii @ChloeThePunker @MsuPipkin @realDonaldTrump Marxism≠Fascism. I am of an ideology related to Marxism. You are of one related to Fascism. Get your facts straight. And yes, I am a PROUD atheist, who has an open mind unlike yourself.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, they didn't, Donnie. Get off the drug that Fox News is.
@Citadel69 2/2 If things don't work out here. There are really great Socialist countries over there.
@Citadel69 Those are actual authoritarian shitholes. I want a more libertarian version of the ideology. Close to what Sanders wants, but more left-wing. Imagine the agenda of Jeremy Corbyn. But more focused on liberties. That's me. And also, sure. I'll move to Europe of - 1/2
@Citadel69 It's hard to live like a Socialist in a dog-eat-dog capitalist society. I'm in the lower middle class and do what I can afford to. Now tell me. What have you sacrificed?
@Citadel69 Now you tell me. Answer your own questions.
@Citadel69 To serve my country, I've contacted my Congressional Representatives and been active in doing so. And I give to charity whenever I can; if I have an extra few dollars, I give it to anyone I see in need. I'm charitable. Not the most charitable person in the world, but I am.
@Citadel69 You didn't really strike a nerve. You more or less made me feel inclined to inform you. To help people in the past, I've donated to every food drive I heard about in my area to help people that the government neglects, like homeless veterans.
@Citadel69 And let me also mention that all the countries you said to go to are led by authoritarian strongmen, one not even being left-wing (Russia). There is also a libertarian left, which I am part of. Maybe you should learn what you're talking about before throwing insults.
@EdKrassen @BrendaS90635947 We were never high up in the first place. We've always been an imperialist power trying to grasp hold of power in places we don't belong.
@Citadel69 And about 45,000 people die every year because they can't afford healthcare. That number is set to increase under Trump. We need single-payer. If you don't support it, like close to 80% of Democrats and 40% of Republicans, you are one cruel human being.
@DoelerDaniel @MrBadMoFo @WhiteHouse @POTUS I haven't defended a terrorist. I've defended the sanctity of the Geneva Convention and the 8th amendment. No cruel or unusual punishment. So actually, torture has been against the rule of law for about 200 years. Nice name-calling by the way. Beautiful non-argument.
@LMWatsonNV @DeanHeller I'm not mistaken that he's done nothing for his constituents, so in that regard I'm correct, madam.
@Citadel69 That's a non-argument. You're avoiding the point.
@MrBadMoFo @WhiteHouse @POTUS You really want to go there? You're the people who won't pass legislation providing single-payer healthcare. You're the ones who hate America and Americans and only see us as profit. Haspel truly hates the rule of law, which is what her role in torturing suspects shows.
@DeanHeller No. Nobody will, Dean. You know why? You betrayed your constitutuents. You are not fit to serve in this Congress of the people, by the people, and FOR the people.
@WhiteHouse Then you should've kept America's word and stayed in the pact, you Goddamned buffoon!
@DeplorableNonna @WhiteHouse Don't question whether someone has values. Question what their values are. Yes, I, like you, have values.
@DeplorableNonna @WhiteHouse I didn't support Clinton for your information. Everyone knows she's crooked. And that's the same reason Haspel shouldn't be permitted to be Director.
@WhiteHouse How do you just ignore the allegations against her?
@SzlanicNic @Geoffyboy75 @ElwoodBrew2 @datamanUSA @realDonaldTrump The platforms switched in the 1960s. You must not have taken 4th grade history.

@PressSec @WhiteHouse I don't care how long she's been an employee of the CIA; she's unfit even for the post she currently serves.
@PressSec @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS Our child in the White House faces a social media addiction.
@KyleKulinski Funny how they ignore the fact that even after the platform shift in the 1960s, the Corporate Democrats ran racist candidates.
@ServeThe901 @krassenstein So you'll be just as corrupt as the Republicans? Nice agenda, bud.
@krassenstein Actually, the corporatist agenda of the Democratic Party is losing you millennial voters. I doubt you'll take the back the house in November. When you stand for nothing, even comic book villains beat you in elections.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What about the years Obama added 2.1-3.1 million jobs? Trump only added 2.05 million last year. So really, he's had the worst job performance since 2012. I'll give him credit for the job creation in general, but he needs to stop the boasting.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse No. That shouldn't even be a day.
@WhiteHouse Wonder how you did that, regulation cutters.
@RepKihuen @goldbutte @GoldButteNV @friendsofnvwild @BasinRangers @tulespringsnps @NuwuArt You won't be representing the Great State of Nevada soon, you sellout corporatist.
@Hope4Hopeless1 @LylaRTurner @EricGreitens @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS_Schedule @GovGreitensMO @SykesforSenate Triggered much?
@RobertG35947779 @WhiteHouse Correct, but overlooking the fact that the countries he didn't ban are important to his imperialist strategy in Syria, which by the way he promised not to use, is irresponsible and definitely not irrelevant. Get all the facts.
@WhiteHouse I made a typo in that, and it's really bugging me, but I don't want to delete the Tweet.
@AnOilithrigh So because I supported Brexit (I'm American, but still) I'm a racist? No. Your generalization of anyone you don't agree with as a racist is truly shameful.
@WhiteHouse Then why did he target the Middle East with a travel ban and recongnize National Day of Prayer? He isn't a champion of religious freedom; he's a champion of lies and unconstitutionality.
@EricGreitens If I wasn't an atheist and believed in a deity, I'd be praying for you to resign. You are a stain on the face of this beautiful nation.
@WhiteHouse Then abolish National Day of Prayer.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Then abolish National Day of Prayer if you protect religious liberties.
RT @funder: Trump’s inauguration was smaller than both of Obama’s. Everyone who retweets this agrees. I talk about that and more with Lilly…
@BIueWaveSurfer @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Prayer has always been legal.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Sorry to burst your bubble.		https://t.co/TveLm5SIoh
@4aPeoplesParty @jimmy_dore It means we're tired of voting for the lesser evil. We're tired of Democrats and their right-wing values. We're tired of Republicans and their blatant warmongering. We're tired of the establishment and want a party that will represent us.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse They are receiving preference. Praying is a religious activity that a sitting president in endorsing in compliance with a federal law that says he has to. It should not be a law to have to sponsor religion or religious activities.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse Your interpretation may be different.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse Tell that to the courts that declared it unconstitutional.
@SenDougJones @SenShelby On May 9th, I ask both of you, as your constitutuent, to vote to reinstate #NetNeutrality
@KyleKulinski How the fuck does that qualify as news?
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse It's called a National Day of Prayer because its use is to urge everyone to pray to a deity that many people in the United States don't believe. People can pray on their own accord. And you are ignoring the fact it is federal law for a president to declare it a holiday.
@seanhannity Jail Clinton for electoral fraud in the primaries and jail Trump for obstruction.
@realDonaldTrump If you see the Middle East as such a concern PULL OUT! Those are people, yes. But any military action against Syria should be conducted through the UN. Put tariffs on China like you said you would. And North Korea is going swimmingly, as long as you don't interrupt Moon's work.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse It's actually been declared unconstitutional in the past, but a federal appeals court (presumably run by conservatives or religious people) voted against it.
@LoneTreeGirl @WhiteHouse Even if it is Constitutional, on what grounds should it be required by law that a sitting president declare a day or prayer? It's been signed into LAW. Even if he doesn't specify what to pray for, it is a law favoring religious people over nonreligious people.
@beckfeld_denise @WhiteHouse By the way, I'm no Democrat. They're too right-wing for me.
@beckfeld_denise @WhiteHouse Then tell your neocon warmonger president to stop getting us involved in the Middle East and making these people hate us. By the way, Haspel tortured people who turned out to be innocent. Anything to say about that?
#NationalDayOfPrayer is an unconstitutional distraction from Trump's multiple scandals. The First Amendment states that the government shall not favor any religion over another. All atheists should participate in a #NationalDayOfThought
@AggieColt45 @DrainTheTrumps @WhiteHouse You seem like an educated human being.
@WhiteHouse Hmm. Blantant violation of the Constitution. He'll probably get out of this too. People are focusing too much on his personal life and not enough on his actions. It's things like this we never see reported.		https://t.co/qKNZb11CMl
