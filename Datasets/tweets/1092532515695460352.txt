@zedbro68 @jemelehill Jemele is Gaslighting Trump is absolutely right.
@jemelehill That is absolutely true
@jemelehill Jajajajjajajajjajajajaja
@Khary_Illah Thomas Sowell is one of the most respected brilliant intellectuals of the last 60 years. The critique on him is that he relies too much on facts and not enough on feelings
@Khary_Illah He said North Africa. Point being white slavery was bigger than black slavery in America
@Khary_Illah Jajajjajajajajja buddy just stop. You are making a fool of yourself
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet But in a free country you are free to be as crazy and delusional as you want to be.
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet It is demonstrably false  in 2019 he doesn’t need to
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Absolutely not you can comment on whatever you want. You are FREE to do that. The problem is that you imply that these things are currently happening now and that is demonstrably false
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet The first legal salve owner was black. Many free slaves owned black slaves. So did native Americans. Your delusional version of American History is Ahistorical
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I agree with Shelby Steele and Thomas Sowell
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet It seem that you are an Oppression appropriator. You appropriate the oppression of your ancestors. My ancestors were raped and murdered by the Spanish but I don’t make excuses and complain about it. I’ve moved on
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Things that you never did
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet That’s your opinion and you have the right to it
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Just trying to open your mind sweetheart
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet I’m just trying to get you to think outside the sick idea of racial Collectivism
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet There are no meetings of the white or black race to conspire and scheme. Race is actually one of the tools used by the elites to keep the masses divided so we are easier to control. Divide and Conquer
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Individuals
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Based on the fact that people are not Collectives based on race but are individuals with their own beliefs experiences and agency.
@PlumberJ1971 @MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet Nite
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet By the way Black is not a race neither is White
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet No race has enslaved another as a whole....ever
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Relax my friend
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Jejejejejejjeje
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet White Supremacy in America no longer exists
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet So it is a question of degrees then huh. Well our slavery was worse.
@PlumberJ1971 @MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet Are you racist against the Irish? You’re not Irish you don’t know what it’s like to be an Irish Body
@MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 Are you upset about Chinese Supremacy in China. Where is the diversity?
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet That’s not very nice
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Ya gonna fuck with Thomas Sowell?
@MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 I’ve done all the research.
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet It’s relevant to the fact that blacks don’t have a monopoly on slavery. Whites can complain just as much
@MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 And White Supremacy is not a thing in 2019 USA. The fact that there are POC throughout all levels of institutional power proves this. That can’t happen in a White Supremacist State
@MsMJJ4ever @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 There was more white slavery to North Africa than black slavery to America. Whites should be complaining just as much as blacks

@Khary_Illah Would you like to explain Marxism to me? And what changed to create Cultural Marxism? Please educate me
@kjbr0403 @Khary_Illah @TinoAsprilla5 I see the world differently than you do. We have completely different opinions. I hate and categorically reject Intersectionality and the NeoMarxist Left.

@kjbr0403 @Khary_Illah @TinoAsprilla5 I am impressed with myself so I liked your comment.
@Khary_Illah Skin color and Culture are two completely different things
@Khary_Illah I might as well be talking to a Goldfish
@martinroger26 You use the single variable of race to explain bad outcomes. There are many variables other than race that can explain outcomes.
@Khary_Illah Explain how that is moving the goalposts. Your argument implies that skin color equals Culture and I’m proving to you that it doesn’t
@Khary_Illah Intersectionality rejects logic reason Rationality objectivity and facts even scientific. It see the world through a Postmodern lens where everything is subjective. It’s where you get shit like the gender spectrum and the redefinition of the word racism
@Khary_Illah I am intellectually superior to you in every way.
@_AYR_7 @krassenstein Lobbying and accepting donations is the function of Washington. If this is the standard half the city is in trouble.
@Khary_Illah Is the Culture of African Americans the same as Black Africans. They are all black correct? Skin color doesn’t equal Culture
@Khary_Illah Racism already has a mutually accepted definition. It is the NeoMarxist Left trying to redefine it to fit their Intersectional narrative

@mtracey Ya think.......they are ideologically possessed
@martinroger26 Depends the circumstances.
@Khary_Illah People’s opinion about White Supremacy in America is irrelevant. South Africa during apartheid was a White Supremacist State. The fact that there are POC throughout positions of institutional power at every level@in the US proves it isn’t White Supremacist.
@Khary_Illah Yes it is. Race would be one gender would be another personal decisions could be another and there are 1000 more from there.
@Khary_Illah Do all black people have the same experience. Do all people of any race have the same experience. Or are we not individuals regardless of race?
@goodlimediner @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel You are arguing for equality of outcome based on race.
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Skin color@doesn’t sound a certain way
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Skin color doesn’t think
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 People that think that anyone Right of Chairman Mao are Nazis
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Are you that lacking  in Self awareness to not realize what a racist thing that is to say
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 You need me to be white. The thing that the Intersectional Left hate the most are POC that don’t think like them. You actually hate us more than you hate whites. You will even let the lower on the ladder Intersectional whites go after us.
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 Because of the way I think? How do white people think?
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Are you a twitter gangster? I am a Latino Immigrant from Colombia dummy. I just happen to reject the Alt Left
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 @road25thdan Because the Alt Left has taken over the education system.
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet How are POC supposed to think?
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Wow@you are a racist
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 I reject this ideology. Only NeoMarxist believe this shit
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet And you prove you are a bigot and a racist
@SukiSmith8 @road25thdan @NW_StayDet I know everything about those subjects and the most important thing where they derive from
@NW_StayDet @SukiSmith8 Ideological bullshit that they are infecting our youth with in the school system. I categorically reject it
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet That is an argument from authority. I reject it because I understand it
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet What you just said is the definition of racism.
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet And that right there is a racist thing to say
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet I’m not white
@NW_StayDet That does prove you wrong
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan No I did prove you wrong
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Ideological garbage
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet You imply it with every comment you make
@SukiSmith8 @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Critical Race Theory Gender Studies etc is as legitimate as Phrenology
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet I reject your ideology so do most rational people
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet That is all you and the rest have been doing. One GINORMOUS Strawman
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet When they have zero to do with the argument yes
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet No you are trying to redefine the word racism. Racism has ZERO to do with power
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet I don’t see black people as a monolith like you do. I see people as individuals not Homogeneous racial Collectives
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet You can laugh all you want but you do t get to redefine words on a whim to suit your Intersectional narrative
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet You haven’t disproven anything. You don’t even make sense in your I coherent ramblings
@road25thdan @SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet I reject Critical Race Theory Horseshit. Again it derives directly from the NeoMarxiat Frankfurt School and Critical Theory
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet In many cases people do attribute racism to outcomes that have a different explanation. People like yourself only use the single variable of race to explain outcomes which is of course ridiculous
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Because you are accusing me of things I never said
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Because we are talking about present day America. That is the context
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet Being black does not make you an expert on racism. Anyone of any color can be a racist and experience racism.
@Khary_Illah It is because it judges people based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics.
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I never argued that racism doesn’t exist
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet See the fact that you believe I can’t be Latino because of the way I think is pure racism
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I am unfamiliar with the specific case you were talking about. I said as much I never ducked it
@SukiSmith8 @NW_StayDet And what makes you an expert?
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet You are just saying words with little to no coherence
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet You are to dumb for me to be debating.
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet You are assigning arguments to me that I never made
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever I like to read Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever Single parent households
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet Your whole argument has been one GIANT Strawman
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I don’t think you even need me for this argument. You can just Strawman me
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet People of a specific race are not monolithic
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I’m not the guy you are thinking I am
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever I don’t take anything from Vix seriously. I mean a broken clock is right twice a day but generally Vox is Leftist trash
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I have never been asked the question and have not read anything on that specific subject
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Calling that lady who stood behind Meadows a token was objectively racist. That was my point.....that’s all. The people that called her a token are judging her based on her skin color. They think she should think and behave a certain way because of her skin color
@urbansimian @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel And that right there is racist.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet No cause you are ignorant and pathetic
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Intersectionality is based in NeoMarxism and Postmodernism. That is where it derives from
@urbansimian @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 When you start with ad-hominem attacks it shows that you don’t k ow what you are talking about or are losing the debate
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet I just did
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Ok I will explain it to you. Your problem is that you only apply a single variable when judging outcomes. That being race. Of course there are many variables that explain outcomes. But if the only one you apply is race and ignore all other more often than not you will be wrong
@urbansimian @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 What is it? Let’s debate it
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet How hard it must be to be you
@urbansimian @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel I’m not white. Secondly you all are objectively wrong
@PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet You’re welcome
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I roll right over you like it’s nothing
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @NW_StayDet I am your intellectual superior on every level.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet You haven’t proven a single thing you have said. You have spewed nothing more than verbal diarrhea
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Are you aware of what we are talking about?
@urbansimian @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 You don’t know what it is but it is the lens that Intersectionals use to view the world. Most dont even realize it
@urbansimian @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 Jejejejjejejejej
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 If she was white would you call her a token? So her race has everything to do with you calling her a token correct?
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet All white people did that?
@urbansimian @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel In this context it was and thatnisnt up for debate
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel Hilarious
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Many people not just blacks are creating racism out of thin air or crying racism where none exists
@jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet No you gave me a general out of context definition. I have you a specific contextual explanation.
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel Anyone of any color can be a racist
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet No they were not.....listen you have no clue what you are talking about stay in your lane. Keep screaming racism at random people on the block
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Jajajajjajajajajaj
@road25thdan @MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Jajajaja you people are completely illogical and barely coherent. Don’t throw rocks in glass houses
@NW_StayDet The Europeans were as well
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever West Africans we’re allies of the Europeans.
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 But she’s black and you are white. You aren’t allowed to talk about an oppressed black woman like that. Check your privilege jejejjejeje
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Absolutely but not just black people. Intersectionality promotes Oppression Olympics. The more oppressed you are the more status and virtue you have. I categorically reject Intersectionality
@PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet And you are a racist
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel Nobody except Cohen and the Congressional Committees could speak that had ZERO to do with race
@jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet That is pure projection. Postmodernism is one of the ideological pillars of Intersectionality. Postmodernism rejects Modernism. It rejects logic reason objectivity Individuality etc etc.
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel Nonsense
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Actually yes black Africans that allied with Europeans and sold them conquered tribes are responsible for slavery
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 Or she is an individual with her own beliefs experiences and agency an not just a skin color. Could be that as well
@PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet She is not a token she is an individual with her own beliefs experiences and agency. Again you see her only as a skin color. You also are completely ideologically possessed
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet I never said racism doesn’t exist
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet There are no “Black People”. You are so ideological possessed that you can’t see anything without a racial Collectivist lens
@jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet You have to be Gaslighting at this point
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 But race was involved here. And she was only called a token because of her race.
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel GTFOH with that
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel And still I am objectively right and you are objectively wrong
@jenn_ebel @PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet But this is as a specific situation. People called her a token black because of the way she thinks and behaves. Thinking anyone of any race has to think and be a certain way is racist
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel Calling me white because of the way I think is racist. It’s the same reason calling that lady a token because of what she believes and thinks is racist. There is no getting around this fact
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel @TalibKweli You are a racist and I’m not siding with you
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel This isn’t up for debate.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Anyone of any color can be a racist.
@NW_StayDet Again it isn’t true by definition. The fact that POC are in institutional position of power throughout the public and private sectors proves it isn’t true. That can’t happen in a White Supremacist State
@NW_StayDet That is profound wisdom. People that play oppression Olympics are weak and pathetic. People that hate whites because they are white are weak and racist. I am equal to any white man they don’t scare or threaten me at all.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet The white race is not the ruling social class. You are a racial Collectivist and completely delusional
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel I do t believe systemic white supremacy exists in America. People like you conflate America being a white majority with white supremacy. Sadly for you they aren’t the same thing
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel Pure projection on your part
@NW_StayDet @MsMJJ4ever It’s 2019 not 1819 grow the fuck up and quit pretending to be a victim cause you aren’t
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel I’m not white
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Races are not monoliths. I am not a racial Collectivist and you are.
@NW_StayDet @PlumberJ1971 @jenn_ebel It’s not about pull. I am objectively right and you are objectively wrong
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel And by calling her a token you are being a racist
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet There are no “black people” there are no “white people” we are all individuals with our own beliefs experiences and agency. We are not Homogeneous Collectives based on race or gender
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel No Intersectionality is based on two ideological pillars...NeoMarxism and Postmodernism. That is where the ideology derives from. And when you start spewing Intersectional bullshit you are pushing NeoMarxism by definition
@NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel Irrelevant
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet There is no white supremacy in 2019 America that is illegal. There are individual white Supremacists sure. There are also black Supremacists
@NW_StayDet @jenn_ebel You and your friends are spewing NeoMarxist Critical Theory Horseshit.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Objective Facts and truth
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet This is Critical Theory NeoMarxist bullshit
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet Jajajajjajajajajaj this isn’t up for debate as much as water is wet and fire is hot.
@PlumberJ1971 @NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich Calling a black person a token is by definition racist. You are judging them by their skin color. You expect a POC color to think and act a certain way. Sorry that is textbook racism
@NW_StayDet See you can only argue that through a racial Collectivist lens. There are POC in institutional positions of power throughout the private and public sectors. Local State and Federal.
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet If you call me a spic and I ignore you that had zero impact on me. Cause I do t care what you think
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet Facts don’t give a shit about how you feel
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet You are objectively and categorically wrong
@NW_StayDet Getting denied medical care because of your race is illegal in the US
@NW_StayDet Judging her by the color of her skin is racist by definition. This isn’t a debate it is an objective fact
@NW_StayDet Racism definition is - a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race
@MsMJJ4ever @NW_StayDet Racism definition is - a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race
@jenn_ebel @NW_StayDet It is by definition
@NW_StayDet @Vj248J You don’t get to redefine the word racism to fit your narrative.
@NW_StayDet @Vj248J Anyone of any color can be a racist.
@NW_StayDet A racist as subjectively defined by you?
@NW_StayDet And the impact of racism can be subjective to each person. You look at weak minded millennials and they are offended by people making eye contact with them.
@NW_StayDet Racism has ZERO to do with impact.
@NW_StayDet You want to switch the argument to impact of racism we can do that
@NW_StayDet That isn’t the argument dummy.
@NW_StayDet I might as well be arguing with an Otter
@NW_StayDet Who are you other than a black racist?
@NW_StayDet What is wrong with you? We are defining racism. Impact of racism is a completely different argument
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich The impact is irrelevant to this argument
@NW_StayDet Completely irrelevant
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich What are you talking about? It has nothing to do with me personally
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich Intersectionality is Racist by definition
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich You calling her a token is racist
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich Judging people based on their skin color is racist
@NW_StayDet @KatiePavlich Yes it is by the definition of the word
@_AYR_7 @krassenstein Apply the same argument to planned parenthood
@_AYR_7 @krassenstein Why is that a problem?
@TalibKweli @_AYR_7 And that is exactly what your sycophants do with you.

@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Jajajajjajajajajjajajajjajajajajjaja
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Got nothing to say?
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Is she a crazy conspiracy theorist?
@senatorshoshana @SouthPark https://t.co/GXLrkNtSpW. Here ya go Shoshana.....is she crazy?
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes https://t.co/GXLrkNtSpW
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Well that is the thing that is confusing me here. There is tons of literature on wifi and electromagnetic fields and it’s adverse effects on health. There have been Congressional hearings on it. And yet you people are here acting like people are crazy
@notwokieleaks @senatorshoshana Well shilling is one way consent is manufactured. How do you think the few rule the many? Do you understand Social Power Structures and how they function. Fuck you people are naive
@Crypto_Horse28 @senatorshoshana It’s reality sweetheart
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes I could care less. Usually weak minded people that have ZERO arguments resort to blocking
@senatorshoshana You are the crazy one and you are categorically wrong. You are either a shill or have done ZERO research
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Define destroyed. Destroying your health and well being generally then yes that is exactly what it will do. Some people are more susceptible that others. Wifi hurts people right now. 5 G will just take it to another level
@senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes Nice Strawman
@pspiewak @senatorshoshana And they are right and you are wrong
@senatorshoshana Don’t be a shill Shoshana
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes And as always the people with the biggest mouths block me when they know they are about to be destroyed
@DavidDRitter @DebGoldenDC @senatorshoshana Vaccines are poison as well. Our medical system is set up so that our sickness is a commodity. The sicker we are the more money made. You think the government cares about your well being and health. That has never ever been true
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes They pretty much are. Governments don’t have a good record through history of caring for the well being and health of the masses
@thesnarkygent @plor @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes https://t.co/HFULTQkqJH Temeber stuff like this?
@thesnarkygent @plor @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes A conspiracy is simply two or more people planning something illegal or malevolent in secret. The world is nothing but conspiracies
@thesnarkygent @plor @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes The guy in the video specialized in microwave watergate. There have been doctors and scientists that gave testimony in front of Congressional committees about the dangers and health risks of wifi. And you want to mock people for being concerned?
@plor @thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes https://t.co/GuTTso65rJ. Not a conspiracy theory
@thesnarkygent @senatorshoshana @AJA_Cortes https://t.co/GuTTso65rJ

@FakeNewsHuntres @southerndwaal @SethAbramson Already preparing excuses I see. The conspiracy against Trump will be revealed and the perpetrators held to account.

@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson I’m looking at who you follow and retweet. You are in for a world of hurt. You are retweeting many of the conspirators.

@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson No
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson You don’t believe in the Occult?
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson So you don’t believe would you like to be educated?
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Many of the elite of the elite are Luciferians and Satanists. They worship the god of the old mystery religions. Gods like Baal and Molech. They practice human sacrifice and pedophilia
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Pizzagate is very real. The Occult pedophile problem is worldwide. You wanna go down that rabbit hole? Once you go down you can’t come out
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson The thing is that Fox News has it factually correct. Doesn’t matter if you hate them they are factually right. They actually don’t go deep enough

@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson So the foundation of the Russia Collusion theory is a fraud. Everything from there is fruit from the poisonous tree.

@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Unless he made a deal Mueller is going down as well.
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson The people that I want to see go down are Clapper Brennan Comey and McCabe and they are all fucked.
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson I can debate Seth without referring to Q. The Russians didn’t even hack the DNC or Podesta. The FBI was never given access to the DNC servers. Instead DNC hired Crowdstrike and it was CS that claimed Russia hacked. Here is Comey admitting under oath https://t.co/7wKhecRVhG
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson They are taking down pedophile rings as we speak....pay attention
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson I’ll debate Seth any time and absolutely destroy him. He is k owingly lying
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Who was Joseph Mifsud working for? FBI says it was the Russians? Was it? Not so fast he was actually being handled by Western Intel. And that means that Trump was being set up
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson No name didn’t have Brain Cancer
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson He predicted the date and time up to the very minute
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson He doesn’t mention Q but he is factually correct. You are going to be pissed at people like Seth and the rest of Globalist MSM for lying to you and covering up for the Traitors.
@tjwagbeck @SethAbramson That will go to the all the Deep State Presidents from Clinton on
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson The anons knew that Trump was going to use the army core of engineers a year ago. Red Vastle Hreen Castle. Q predicted to the minute the time of death of No Name McCain
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Go read some John Solomon or Sara Carter.
@tjwagbeck @SethAbramson You’ve been watching too much MSNBC and CNN. You have been listening to liars like Seth. Seth is going to be exposed. The MSM is not reporting on what is actually happening with people like  the Ohrs Baker Priestap Strzok and Paige etc. Trump has it all
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson That’s all on you......nobody said when the arrests were coming. People theorized but half of what Q says is for the Deep State it’s not for the anons. There have been to many Q proofs for it to be fake.
@44seminole @SethAbramson Jajajjajajajjajajajja
@TheLastCLEFan @SethAbramson Qanon is very real.......the Traitors are about to be exsposed. Mueller has nothing once his investigation and Trump is cleared it’s on. The MSM has been lying to you and actively covering up. Traitors are going down
@FakeNewsHuntres @SethAbramson No it’s very true Seth has been an active part of the coverup and is about to be exposed for the fraud that he is.

@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola He did
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola What antisemitism?
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola Indictments for what? Process crimes that happened as a result of the investigation. There was no predicate crime. And now Trump@is going to expose the set up and conspiracy committed against him by the Obama FBI/DOJ Clinton Camp and DNC and then pushed and covered up by the MSM
@daveethedog @HarrisonRFox @johniadarola Half the people in his cabinet are enemies that he keeps close. What you don’t understand that Trump is just the tip of the sword. He was asked to run by white hats in the military.
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola He actually played the system like most billionaires do
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola And the MSM are Globalist establishment mouth pieces controlled by the CIA. Some of them will be going to Gitmo as well
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola Does an idiot become a billionaire and then against all odds and the Deep State establishment become President of the United States? He is on the verge of the biggest counter Intel takedown in American History and you are claiming he is dumb
@keiranhalycon18 @realshovlaxnet @DemocraticInq @johniadarola I am speaking in the context of Hate Crimes. There is no such thing as a hate crime
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola Then how are you so ignorant and uninformed?
@daveethedog @HarrisonRFox @johniadarola No he isn’t. He was only labelled a racist after he ran and then became President.
@realshovlaxnet @DemocraticInq @johniadarola It shouldn’t when it comes to crimes. Intent actually doesn’t matter
@HarrisonRFox @daveethedog @johniadarola Jejejejejejjeje you are going to see how dumb he is. Watch what happens when Mueller has nothing on Trump the investigation is no longer a blockade. You dummies who have been watching MSM are not going to know what hit you. And I will be here to gather your liberal tears
@daveethedog @HarrisonRFox @johniadarola Who is?
@HarrisonRFox @johniadarola That is the stupidest thing I’ve read today on twitter. Trump is not a racist as much as you want him to be
@DemocraticInq @johniadarola There are no hate crimes there are just crimes
@HarrisonRFox @johniadarola The media would make excuses for him if he wasn’t white.

@rolandsmartin @newyscruggs @ChrisPaulComedy Your ideology which pushes victimhood results in cases like Jussie Smollett
@rolandsmartin @newyscruggs @ChrisPaulComedy Intersectionality is based on two ideological pillars. NeoMarxism and Postmodernism. Postmodernism rejects logic objectivity rationality truth and facts. It claims everything is subjective. You can’t win a logical argument when your ideology rejects logic itself

Once the Mueller blockade is gone Trump will lower the hammer. People like the Ohrs McCabe Paige Strzok Preistap Baker etc have already testified and been throwing each other under
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin The whole narrative that cops are out shooting blacks because they are black is ridiculous. The idea that White Supremacy is a thing in 2019 is ridiculous. There are POC throughout positions of systemic power in the private and public sectors. Local State and Federal
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin Because the MSM is@doing the exact opposite. They only cover white on “add minority here” crime. The MSM are Intersectional Globalist Leftists. Roland Martins question is absurd and borderline Gaslighting. I am a Latino Immigrant and I see clearly that the hate goes one way
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin It’s 2019 not 1819 grow up
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin You are the definition of the word racist
@geoffneale8 @franifio @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett And it will continue to happen over the next weeks and months.
@geoffneale8 @franifio @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett It’s already happening
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin We are all individuals with different beliefs experiences and agency. We are not Homogeneous Collectives based on race or gender. America is not a White Supremacist society. People like yourself conflate America@being a white majority with WS. They are not the same thing
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin If anything through Intersectionality the media is going after white people. Intersectionality is based in NeoMarxism and Postmodernism. Oppressor Oppressed paradigm. The Oppressors are white straight men. The media hate them
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin There is no “White People”
@rolandsmartin White isn’t an ideology white is not a race. Neither is black for that matter
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin Is any race a monolith. Racial Collectivism is so illogical
@somhrd50 @rolandsmartin Not is not even seems. Terrorism has to do with ideology not race
@ogburich43 @rolandsmartin Who is they. The only way you can make an argument this dumb is if you are a racial Collectivist
@rolandsmartin You have to attach a race to terrorism?

@wordlass1 @flyingpumpkin13 @meredithheron @RVAwonk @ClaraJeffery @BylineTimes @jack @Twitter @TwitterGov Prove to me that vaccines are effective. They dont go through thorough trials.

@beamerofjoy @meredithheron @RVAwonk @ClaraJeffery @BylineTimes @jack @Twitter @TwitterGov It is the vaccines that actually give you exposure to pathogens and compromise all the systems in the body.
@beamerofjoy @meredithheron @RVAwonk @ClaraJeffery @BylineTimes @jack @Twitter @TwitterGov Science can and is manipulated all the time to further agendas.

@Head_Sanford @jemelehill Do white people=White Supremacy in your mind? Are white people the enemy?
@Head_Sanford @jemelehill Is China a White Supremacist State? China is basically an ethno-State with almost zero diversity. Is China a Chinses Supremacist State?

You get the Oppressor oppressed paradigm of Marxism they just switched Economic Class with ID class. And then the ability to redefine everything subjectively to fit narratives of Postmodernism eg Gender Spectrum
@QTMA9 @GeorgePapa19 Oh yes there is and it’s been playing out leak free

@MollyOShah @GeorgePapa19 Nope
@BlazeDryslwynn @OracleExec @GeorgePapa19 It isn’t nonsense it is very real and you should be worried
@jenkalant @JamesForbes17 @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh What is the difference?
@jenkalant @JamesForbes17 @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh When you start talking about recognizing barriers and discrimination you start to get into equality of outcome territory. NeoMarxism which is an ideological pillar of Intersectionality is based in equality of outcome
@jenkalant @JamesForbes17 @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh What are the systemic obstacles?

@rolandsmartin It isn’t
@JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh By the way Culture doesn’t = Race
@JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh Low key homophobia for being against throwing homosexuals from buildings?
@JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh It’s isn’t a racist analogy. Depending on your morals and values some cultures are much worse than others.
@JamesForbes17 @BillyArmagh @jenkalant @jdasovic2 The point didn’t make any sense
@jenkalant @JamesForbes17 @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh Listen you seem@to be a Utopian SJW that believes in Equity or equality of outcome. I believe Equity is the definition of injustice. I am pro equality of opportunity not equality of outcome. We are not all the same we are individuals and have different strengths and weaknesses
@jenkalant @JamesForbes17 @jdasovic2 @BillyArmagh Are Cultures that throw gays off buildings and punish women for getting raped better or worse than ours?
@BillyArmagh @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @jdasovic2 That was completely incoherent

@ivanjtsdad @horowitz39 When the Blue Bloods Rules Spain sure. But since then the Moore’s Ruled Spain. And then from there the Spanish conquered South America and inter grated with the Natives and the Black Slaves. I am Colombian we are a mutt mix. What Horowitz said is just wrong
@RealDanB95 @existentialfish You are soon going to see who the virtuous are and who the Satanic Traitors are. Trump is no Saint but he is doing what is right. He is exposing the true threat to America. You are going to be very angry with the MSM for lying to you and covering up the true conspiracy

@SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh That was the point she was making. People like you don’t actually care what she said the whole point is to smear her. As soon as she mentioned Hitler it didn’t matter what she said. That was going to be used to smear her.

@jdasovic2 @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You are misunderstanding what Nationalism is.
@jdasovic2 @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Gandhi was trying to free India from the British. Mandela was trying to fight apartheid and free South Africa

@jdasovic2 @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh That is common knowledge it’s not up for debate
@jdasovic2 @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Were Gandhi and Mandela evil? Both Nationalists

@_James_Elmore @ManInTheHoody @existentialfish And when Nationalism is predicated on race it is called Ethno-Nationalism which is separate and different from Nationalism. That was the point Candace was trying to make

@jdasovic2 @JamesForbes17 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh No she didn’t she. She is not stupid she does not support Hitler use some common sense. Her whole point was that Nationalism does not equal Hitler. She even said when people think of Nationalism they think Hitler

@RobLowe @OccidentalAwake Hiiiiyyyyo
@Now4NI @ronindotca @maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh And you know even the bullahit and propaganda that we are taught about  WWI and WWII would change the fact that Candace was correct in what she said. Nationalism does not equal Hitler
@HendricksDanny7 @RealCandaceO @businessinsider I don’t trust you. Like most of the people smearing her you don’t have a clue what you are talking about. Her point was that Nationalism does not equal Hitler. Nationalism is not in and of itself a bad thing
@Ivriniel @BillyArmagh I disagree with what she said there. Hitler was a Nationalist. The biggest difference between the Nazis and the Soviets was Nationalism vs Internationalism
@jordanrooks @jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Depends your intent and what you are talking about. If are not talking in the context of the morality of the person whether they are good and evil you absolutely can

@ronindotca @Now4NI @maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Actually by definition yes
@allheavens She never said the atrocities were fine she said being a Nationalist is fine. The only reason she brought up Hitler is because most people are brainwashed into conflating Nationalism with Hitler. She actually said that
@allheavens Every leader of a country is by definition a Nationalist to one degree or another. Unless they are trying to undermine their country and push the Globalist agenda
@allheavens That isn’t what Candace said. You can completely separate Hitlers Nationalism with his atrocities they are t the same thing. There are many Nationalist that commit zero atrocities. I’m a Nationalist and a Latino Immigrant
@allheavens Devotion to the interests or culture of one's nation.	n.The belief that nations will benefit from acting independently rather than collectively, emphasizing national rather than international goals.	n.Aspirations for national independence in a country under foreign domination.

@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh You are a Lawyer and Majored in History? I’d ask for my money back

@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh The British actually made Hitler think that they were going to take him up on his offer. He sent Hess to Britain to negotiate and he crashed his plane.
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh So while you majored in History they taught you that Hitler actually admired Britain and actually tried to ally with them to fight the Soviets. It was one of the reasons he didn’t obliterate the British expeditionary forces at Dunkirk
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh I’m not sure what you studied so I can’t make a judgement. The fact that you were a history major and cannot grant the concept about what Candace was talking about is troubling in my opinion
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh Your problem is that you cant separate and talk about Hitler the person without talking about his crimes. You should be able to separate any Historical figure in that context
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh The argument is not whether Hitler was good or bad. Candace was not making that argument she wasn’t judging the morality of what Hitler did. That is a completely different discussion.
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh And it wasn’t Hitler that wanted the agreement it was the Zionists that did. They are the ones that pushed it. Hitler wanted them@out but he didn’t care where they went they chose Palestine
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh That isn’t my point
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh None of you that are criticizing Candace have any idea of what happened in WWI or WWII. You believe the bullshit propaganda version that we are manipulated into believing but what actually happened was much more nuanced.
@DrJaneRuby Those that scream the loudest have the most to lose

@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh https://t.co/Ij5y1C2Lur
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh She wasn’t speaking or advocating his genocide because she was not talking about his crimes. It is all of you that are doing that not her. She was making a perfectly logical point
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh Are you familiar with the Hasvarra agreement? The Zionists actually allied with Hitler in 1933. They even minted a gold coin with the Swastika on one side and the Star of David on the other. Did you k ow this?
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh Youre a Lawyer and you can’t understand the concept of speaking about Hitler as a Nationalist but not advocating for his crimes?
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh Every leader of every country is a Nationalist by definition to one degree or another
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh You know who was a Nationalist? Nelson Mandela
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh Let me ask you this are there other kinds of Nationalism other than Hitlerian Nationalism?
@jenkalant @switzere @BillyArmagh You keep conflating Hitlers Ethno-Nationalism with Nationalism. Hitler was a Nationalist and then he took many different steps forward which made him evil.
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Ideological ideals are very different from when they are actually put into practice. I have gone from an idealist to a pragmatist. And the bigger threat I see is the Globalist agenda. It is 100% malevolence
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh I am from Colombia.

@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh I think you are underestimating the ideological possession of the Left
@ayiman_ @slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh But not on the morality of what Hitler did
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Nowadays I don’t think they are being hyperbolic. The educational system is filled with NeoMarxists. They want the destruction of the West. Intersectionality and Postmodern progressivism is infecting our youth. It’s a Cancer
@ayiman_ @slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh But that isn’t a commentary or advocating about what he did morally? Jesus how do you not understand this.
@ayiman_ @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh I hate Mao and his atrocities. He was a very effective leader and was very smart and efficient. Doesn’t mean I like how he used those skills. I do t condone anything he did actuayI detest them. I feel the same about Hitler and Stalin
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Yes you absolutely can.....Leftist are making the same argument against the American Flag
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien Some of the most evil people that ever lived were very smart and very good leaders. Saying so is not advocating the atrocities they committed.
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien I’ll give you a History Lesson my friend
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien Who is worse Hitler or Stalin? Stalin definitely killed 10s of millions more people. We allied with Stalin during WWII. Are you outraged?
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien It’s cause you are wrong and can’t engage in a logical argument.
@ayiman_ @slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh See nobody is defending the atrocities of the Nazis. You people are lunatics
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You can make the exact same argument with the Soviet Flag
@ayiman_ @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Again you all are conflating two separate subjects. It’s like when you hear Gitler all Logic and rationality goes our the window
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien Try to think logically and not with your feelings. She wasn’t commenting on whether Hitler was moral or not.
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien Was Germany a great power. Was Hitler a Smart and effective leader?
@ayiman_ @slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Yes you are just rambling incoherently. Stay in your lane
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh This is where we will agree to disagree
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Kulaks?
@ayiman_ @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Germany was a great power and Hitler was a very smart and effective leader. That is not advocating the atrocities he committed. You are conflating the two
@ayiman_ @slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Starting with Ad-Hominem attack shows you are already losing the debate. Calm down and get out of your feelings. Try to use logic
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish And that is the whole point. You got it right there. You can say it was very efficient and not be advocating the morality of it.
@ayiman_ @SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh @adamcbest She objectively is being misrepresented
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish No she didn’t and you know she didn’t. It was Nationalism not Hitlers Nationalism. Let’s be logical she is a black woman and definitely not a Nazi. Do you honestly believe she supports Hitler? Comon
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh So does the Soviet Flag and they have a far higher body count
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Did Kruschev have a choice not to denounce Stalin? There are people that argue that Kruschev was behind assassination of Stalin. Did they stop their Totalitarianism after Stalin?
@dutchwyoming @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh No way I would argue the Soviet Flag is worse
@MalbecWino1 It’s not the same ideology sorry it isn’t. Hitler practiced Ethno-Nationalism very different
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish We might disagree but you aren’t a dumb guy. You can see what her argument was and how these people are ignorantly or intentionally mischaracterizing what she said. It’s like their brains turn to mush as soon as Hitler is mentioned
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish The Nazis were very effective and efficient.
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish Hitler actually achieved that goal.........spectacularly.

@MalbecWino1 That is the definition of Nationalism

@MalbecWino1 They objectively by definition are. It isn’t a debate. Your feelings play zero role.
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Can we not debate in good faith? Let’s have a discussion point counter point
@MalbecWino1 Nationalism and Hitlers Nationalism are two completely different things
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant Not all human contact just yours. I have come to care for you quite deeply over these last couple hours
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant I would make the argument that it was Britain that orchestrated WWI to destroy Germany because Germany was a threat to their hegemony. And there are a lot of facts to back this up.
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant You have t stopped blabbering
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant You’re here
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish I would argue that all of them were quite similar on the Macro level. History is written by the victors.
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Let’s debate cause I’ve been studying for over 20 years. I know my shit
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Do you believe that Germany caused WWI?
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant Jejejejjejejejejjeje
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant He is but one. I don’t believe the bullshit version we are taught about WWI or WWII
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant I am smart
@GreedForHer @adamcbest Yes really
@slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh The destruction of the West is the logical conclusion of Critical Theory and Postmodern Deconstruction
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish And Hitler essentiallly did the same thing if you look on the Macro level. You could argue the US did the same
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant Calling him a genius does not critique his morality. Do you see the point. Many of the smartest men ever were completely evil. The two things are completely separate
@slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh We want positive change. The NeoMarxist Postmodern Left wants to destroy America and Western Civilization as a whole. We aren’t going to tolerate that
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Dinesh Dsouza makes a compelling argument
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Why not? It is the intent that you have. Intent matters
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish No I’m not I’ve done my ready and there are many that support my POV
@slayermode83 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You got the first part right. And it depends what kind of change you are advocating. If it is NeoMarxist bullshit in the guise of tolerance and virtue then yes we will reject it.
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Doesn’t mean he supports them. He is a historian. Again you seem to conflate debate about the era and the people with advocating for them. They aren’t the same thing
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish The main difference between The Soviets and the Nazis was Internationalism and Nationalism. They essentially were the same thing
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish I believe it is nuanced. America at the top is not a Capitalist nation at least not free market
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh What is more offensive the Nazi Flag or the Soviet Flag?
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Are you just as triggered when talking about Stalin or Mao? They killed 10s of millions more than Hitler ever did
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Hitler
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Was Hitler a good leader?
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh If I said that Bitler was a good leader and arguably a genius is that support for what Hitler did?
@dutchwyoming @BillyArmagh @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish Planned economy
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant Was Hitler a good leader? Was he a smart man even a genius@in many ways?
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant Projection
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh I’ll give you an example. Was Hitler a good leader. What Hitler a smart man?
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You can talk about Hitler and not be advocating his atrocities
@repulsive_cut @BillyArmagh @switzere @jenkalant See I am objectively NOT defending genocide. I’m not defending Hitler and neither was Candace
@BillyArmagh @repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant Ad-Hominem and the old I won’t debate you cause it’s not worth my time backpedal....well played
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Making Germany Great where did that come from?
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Hitler seems to be a buzzword that makes you go into feelings. He is merely a historical figure like any other to me
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You are conflating the two things
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish It was not independent of the government. It was controlled by the Nazi party. Most of the industrialist were Nazis
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh It usually shows you are losing an arowhen you resort to ad-hominem attacks.
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish Take a look at what happened to America during WWII. Was industry independent of Government on our side? Jajajjajaja
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish This isn’t something to lie about. It took all of Germany’s industrial might to fight WWII. Was Hitler a dictator or not?
@BillyArmagh @dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @existentialfish No they didn’t at all. Look at Oscar Schindler.
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Not at all. Nationalism has zero to do with race or color. It has zero to do with imperialism or expansion. It simply means pride in ones country. And that is the point that Candace was making
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Are you a Marxist?
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Communism will never ever be viable.....EVER
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish You pretty much are my ideological enemy..... so further discussion is pointless
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish You are a Communist and I am a Nationalist. I am a Latino Immigrant to the US and I am a Nationalist. I am completely anti-Globalist
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Nationalism in and of itself is great. There is nothing wrong with Nationalism.
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish So do you advocate for “Real” Communism?
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Try arguing with what she said and not Strawmen and misrepresentations if what she said
@repulsive_cut @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh She never said that
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Ok I see where you are coming from Jajajjajajajajja.
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Industry was essentially run and planned by the Nazi government.
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish And nobody here is defending Hitler and that is the whole point. Candace was not advocating Hitler
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish I think we are talking past one another here so let’s define terms. I believe you are conflating Socilaism with Communism
@steveinashland @adamcbest @pookietooth @RealCandaceO She never said that. Complete misrepresentation of her argument but you all know that
@Wickedlydeeper @adamcbest That isn’t what she said but of course you know that don’t you
@GreedForHer @adamcbest Also that isn’t remotely close to what she said...so there’s that
@adamcbest Nice misrepresentation nice smear. You people are evil
@SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh @adamcbest He is completely misrepresenting what she said. That guy did not do a good job. She wasn’t advocating his policies. It’s a smear plain and simple.
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Was Hitler worse than Stalin? Stalin has a way bigger body count
@dutchwyoming @maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Jajajjaja Jajajjajaja sure
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Also we allied with Stalin
@dutchwyoming @Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish He did privatize industry but it was all owned by and controlled by the Nazis. It was private in name only it was in practice socialized
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Are we able to talk about Genghis Khan and not critique the millions he killed? The Roman Empire? Egypttian Empire all the way up to the modern day Anglo American Empire. How do you think Empires are built? By handing candy out door to door? None of you even understand WWII
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish You don’t think so? Alaexander the Great? How many millions did he kill? Do we hold him in high esteem?
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish She brought up Hitler because most people think Hitler when Nationalism is brought up she even says that. She is not saying that Hitler is a good example of Nationalism. I actually think she was trying to tie him to Internationalism which I said I don’t totally agree with
@switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Are you arguing that Hitler didn’t give a shit about Germany? I actually believe he wanted the best for Germany. Most of the worst atrocities committed in history are by people that believe they are doing what is right
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Fuck the Hauge I’m talking about back to antiquity to now. Hitler was no different than any other leader. They all commit atrocities and mass murder
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Stalin killed 3-4 times the people Hitler killed. The allies allied with him against Hitler. You can easily make the argument that Stalin was way worse than Hitler
@switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh You all are conflating two separate things
@switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh He did she isn’t wrong about that. I’ve studied the history.
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Most historical figures were war criminals
@katiepeheakoe @SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh She want talking about what he did that is the whole point
@katiepeheakoe @SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh She wasn’t doing that no matter how much you want to believe it because it fits your narrative. Objectivity has not been completely destroyed at least not yet
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Subjectivity in the right form isn’t itself bad. I don’t like when people project their own subjective feelings into objective facts. So answer the question
@Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Hitler is the person that comes to mind for most people when you mention Nationalism she even said that. And her argument wasn’t about Hitlers brand of Nationalism it was the fact that Nationalism on its own is not a bad thing and it isn’t. I am a Nationalist. I am also a Latino
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Who was more evil Hitler or Stalin?
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish Who killed more people Hitler or Stalin?
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish So you can’t talk about historical figures without critiquing the morality of what they did? Is that your argument?
@katiepeheakoe @SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh She was not critiquing the morality of what Hitler did
@katiepeheakoe @SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh That has nothing to do with the point she was making ZERO
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh This is straight out of the Leftist playbook Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. You all use the same tactics I see it all the time
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Are you a professional troll do you get paid by the tweet?
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh I’m here for an intelligent debate with unintelligent people
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Gaslighting
@SwizzleGizzle @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Her point was that when people bring up Nationalism people think Hitler she actually said that. Nationalism does not equal Hitler. Nationalism in and of itself can be good. Every country is by definition Nationalistic to one degree or another
@switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh No defending Nationalism not Hitlers Nationalism
@maxtrail1 @switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh When and how did I defend Hitler? Back up your claim
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh Nobody is defending Hitler......I think you people are just Gaslighting at this point
@maxtrail1 @jenkalant @BillyArmagh How? Are you that dumb
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish She wasn’t referring to the morality of Hitler it is all of you that are doing that
@switzere @jenkalant @BillyArmagh See this is the stupidity of the people criticizing Candace. She nor I are defending the actions of Hitler. How dumb are you people? Is this a joke I’m actually shocked at the stupidity
@BillyArmagh So what is your point? Being a Nationalist is not in and of itself a bad thing. It can be a great thing. I would also argue that Hitler was taking back parts of Germany that were given away after the treaty of Versailles. He did want to expand into Russia though
@jenkalant @BillyArmagh And? So you believe she was advocating for Hitlers ethno Nationalism?
@Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish You absolutely can. I believe that Hitler was an Ethno-Nationalist and a Socialist and the difference between him and Stalin was Nationalism vs Internationalism
@Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish I would argue that Hitler was not a Globalist. I don’t think that Candace is correct in her description of him.
@Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish What she said had zero to do with what Hitler did or his morality. You are putting your feelings of rational and historical debate
@Mimiges @katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish Apply that standard to any historical figure and you can’t talk about them. Who killed more people Stalin or Hitler? We allied with Stalin? How many people did Gengis Kahn kill? He actually wiped an entire ethnicity off the face of the earth. Can’t speak about him?
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn We will see who the fool is
@jaymzdavid @BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish And that is the Postmodern Left that reject truth face and objective reality and believe everything is subjective.
@jenkalant @BillyArmagh Her argument is that Nationalism in and of itself is not a bad thing. It depends what else you add to it that can make bad. For example Ethno-Nationalism.
@jenkalant @BillyArmagh That isn’t close to what she said. Again she was speaking in the context of Nationalism vs Internationalism, not about the atrocities he committed.

@TheBlakkSamurai @janealla50 @existentialfish Weak......use your words
@Valentinesday1 Honestly these people are terrifying. They are either extremely dumb or extremely evil
@LoneStarDem @HalynBomb @existentialfish Because you can talk about Historical figures without advocating what they did. Otherwise how are you going to discuss history?
@BillyArmagh You are objectively wrong I am right and you are talking shit? Jajajajajjajajajajaj Hilarious
@BillyArmagh So what you all are implying is that it is up to all of you to subjectively tell her what she meant. Context and her intent don’t mean anything? This is feelings over facts
@BillyArmagh So then explain to me what she meant when she said outside of Germany?
@LoneStarDem @HalynBomb @existentialfish She was talking about whether Hitler was a Nationalist or Internationalist. That was the context
@BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish I did I have shown you to be wrong
@BillyArmagh Her comments had nothing to do with the morality of the things Hitler did within the Nationalist or Internationalist framework. The context was Nationalism vs Internationalism
@BillyArmagh You did because her point was that he went from Nationalism to Internationalism. I would debate that point with her but that was her point
@BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish You don’t even know what Context is do you. You can quote anybody and have it mean whatever you want without context. It’s a classic and dishonest way to smear people which is exactly what is being done to Candace. Ya see POC like Candace and myself are a threat to the Left
@ethanfrancois_ @existentialfish @RealCandaceO You are either being intellectually dishonest or are too dumb to understand what she was arguing which is it?
@BillyArmagh @katonemodia @existentialfish So what was wrong with what she said what was she speaking about? Was she speaking about the morality of the things Hitler did? Answer honestly.....what was the context. We are gonna see who the brick is
@ethanfrancois_ @existentialfish @RealCandaceO I did and they are perfectly logical and legitimate. She was speaking in the context of Hitlers Nationalism not the morality of the things he did. It’s actually a very good point she makes.
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn I’ve followed you follow me and we will see who is right and wrong at the end of the day.
@ebiznus1 @existentialfish @jaredlholt So you have no argument so you go to the weak ass Bot comment
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Are you familiar with the testimony of The Ohrs Paige Preistap Baker etc. And if not why not?
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn So you have nothing? Make an argument
@katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish What she said had nothing to do with the morality of Hitler. She was speaking strictly in the context of Nationalism. She made the argument that he was at first a Nationalist but then became more of an internationalist. I actually don’t agree with that completely
@katonemodia @BillyArmagh @existentialfish But she objectively is being taken out of context. That’s not up for debate
@RealDanB95 @existentialfish And I think it is very racist of you to imply that I need to think in a certain way because of my race. I agree with Trump 100% on illegal immigration and know that he is not a racist
@RealDanB95 @existentialfish She never said Bitler had a right idea.	She was speaking strictly in the context of him being a Nationalist. What she said was perfectly logical and coherent
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Comey Brennan Baker Paige Clapper the Ohrs Strzok McCabe etc etc all the way up to Clinton and Obama. Mieller is going down as well unless he has made some sort of deal@to save himself
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Laugh Now Cry Later
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn No we do because they wanted get rid of Trump yesterday. If they had anything Trump would be done. The Cohen and Stone indictments show what a weak position Muller is in. Stones indictment actually proves Trump didn’t Collude
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Have you read To Kill a Mockingbird? You have heard of the Cat it’s Seat? Trump is sitting in it right now and just waiting to drop the hammer and you are not gonna see it coming. You are going to be so angry with MSM for lying and covering up the truth
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn And Mueller has zero indictments relating to Trump......Zero
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Joseph Mifsud was the professor that approached Papadopolous and told him that the Russians had dirt on Hillary. It was claimed that he was working for Russia. Turns out NOPE....he was working for Western Intel. Do you understand what that means?
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn I understand what is happening you don’t. It’s just a matter of timing now. Mueller has nothing ZERO this whole witch hunt was to cover up the conspiracy against Trump before and after the election. And it didn’t work
@DarthSokath @existentialfish @RepLeeZeldin Why would they?
@ethanfrancois_ @existentialfish @RealCandaceO She wasn’t speaking in context of Hitlers morality dummy.
@TheBlakkSamurai @janealla50 @existentialfish She is
@BlueChipXD @reebblu @RubyGirl28 How what did she say that was wrong. It was a perfectly logical argument
@ebiznus1 @existentialfish @jaredlholt No you dont
@LouiseMensch @existentialfish @BrandonLewis @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @halfon4harlowMP @StandWithUs @COLRICHARDKEMP @Dannythefink In the context of Nationalism
@GM7077 @RealDanB95 @existentialfish Not even close and you it. What she said was completely logical and didn’t advocate for Hitler in the least
@RealDanB95 @existentialfish You’re a moron
@HalynBomb @existentialfish She wasn’t speaking in that context. You can talk about Hitler without talking about the atrocities he committed
@docrocktex26 @existentialfish What she said was completely logical within the context
@BillyArmagh @existentialfish You are completely taking her out of context and knowingly so
@MollyJongFast @existentialfish She didnt
@ManInTheHoody @TheLoveBel0w @existentialfish And your understanding is objectively wrong
@ManInTheHoody @existentialfish She wasn’t speaking about the atrocities Hitler committed
@ShireenQudosi @existentialfish She wasn’t talking about that
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Joseph Mifsud?
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn Huber has been hard at work and has had a GJ empaneled for quit some time. You don’t have a clue what is actually happening

@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn You realize that the Russians didn’t even hack the DNC or Podesta? The FBI wasn’t given access to the DNC servers. Instead the DNC hired Crowdstrike and it was CS that claimed Russia hacked. Here is Comey admitting that under oath https://t.co/7wKhecRVhG

@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn It was over for the Clintons the moment Trump was elected. You have zero clue what is coming because the MSM is actively part of the cover-up. Some of them will be going down too. Get ya popcorn ready
@KillerEadie @wsscherk @josh_emerson There are at least 4 investigations into the Clintons happening right now including into the Clinton Foundation
@WhartonGradMBA @pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn It’s happening right now. Go look up what they did in Haiti. Go ask the Hatians what they think of the Clintons. Look up Laura Silsby Jejejejejejjeje.
@wsscherk @josh_emerson The truth is gonna come out
@pikachuevie @josh_emerson @RVAwonk @ClintonFdn The Clinton Foundation is being investigated right now. All the evil they were involved in will be coming out. Human trafficking Drugs Child Prostitution and much much worse. Just what they did in Haiti would put you in the hospital

@IsraelJAcevedo @soledadobrien Did you listen to what she said and the context?
@PeterTedeschi @marclamonthill @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO She was speaking in the context of Nationalism not the crimes Hitler committed.
@bungletheory @JT_MDMPH @justinjm1 @drcarlhart @soledadobrien They would say the same things even if they comprehended. The goal is to destroy Candace by any means necessary.
@PeterTedeschi @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO This was a purposeful smear. They lied about what she said and then got people to pile on. If you watch the video you can see that the original poster is full of shit
@PeterTedeschi @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO She never said that. Go watch the tape. She was commenting on whether Hitler was an actual Nationalist and in the beginning he was but later in became more of an internationalist which is debateable
@bungletheory @JT_MDMPH @justinjm1 @drcarlhart @soledadobrien I guarantee most of the people commenting didn’t even listen to what she said. She is a threat to the Left and must be taken down by any means necessary. The ends justify the means
@Come_On_Ground @marclamonthill @soledadobrien Exactly these people are pure evil.
@PoliticalAnt @marclamonthill @soledadobrien @CNN @TPUSA She wasn’t commenting on the morality of what Hitler and the Nazis did. My god
@KingJohnNelson @marclamonthill @soledadobrien How did she fuck up. Did you listen to what she actually said?
@naimareig @marclamonthill @soledadobrien Yes listen to what she said
@PeterTedeschi @marclamonthill @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO She never ever said that you moron
@justinjm1 You are an evil evil person
@StevenBiko @soledadobrien You didn’t even listen to what she said did you. This is just a straight up misrepresentation and smear
@CalvinW92709090 @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO Her point had nothing to do with the morality of what Hitler or the Nazis did. She was saying that Nationalism is not I her bad and that Hitler might have been Nationalist in the begging but became more of an Internationalist. That point can be debated
@BrandonAbdulHa3 @soledadobrien @rolandsmartin Why?
@IsraelJAcevedo @soledadobrien He point was perfectly logical and had nothing to do with the morality of Hitler or the Nazis
@TheTripCJAM @soledadobrien This wasn’t dumb
@PeterTedeschi @soledadobrien @RealCandaceO She never said it was good
@DanJohnsoninc @soledadobrien She made a perfectly cogent argument.
@bwestleyj @soledadobrien She never said it was ok.....every single person on this thread is a dummy every single one. Or are being intellectually dishonest in order to smear Candace
@blk_shrink @soledadobrien What she said was not remotely racist
@its_lindz @soledadobrien Her take was completely logical and not at all advocating for the Nazis
@Toooshie @soledadobrien She was merely making a point about Nationalism
@Bossnaj @soledadobrien You are too dumb to understand what her point was or you are purposely misunderstanding
@heartsnark @soledadobrien She never sugarcoated the Nazis.
@BrandonJDDC @soledadobrien That isn’t what she was saying at all and you know it
@ManhattanBank @DBun213 @soledadobrien Why?
@adriannebyrd @soledadobrien What did she say that was wrong?
@marclamonthill @soledadobrien What she said was perfectly logical and not apologizing for the Nazis in the least
@Dre_Archat @marclamonthill @soledadobrien What did she say that was wrong?
@soledadobrien @drcarlhart She was not apologizing for Hitler or the Nazis and you know it. You are trying to smear her because she is a threat to the Left
@Joeey0808 @SpillzBoogz_ @TalibKweli @NicksKnows I am racist? The 5%ers are Black Supremacists. Talib said he is not a black supremacist but by being a 5%er he is by definition. So how does me pointing that out make me a racist?
@bungletheory @JT_MDMPH @justinjm1 @drcarlhart @soledadobrien They don’t care what we think or if they lose credibility with us. They have lost the argument it is about pure power games now.

@bungletheory @JT_MDMPH @justinjm1 It’s not about truth it’s about narrative for the Left. They are basically Gaslighting it didn’t really matter what she said once she mentioned Hitler
@SpillzBoogz_ @TalibKweli @Joeey0808 @NicksKnows Nobody is a victim strictly based on skin color or gender

@ShilohRoslin @justinjm1 She wasn’t advocating Hitler. Just because you bring Hitlers name up doesn’t mean you advocate him
@FabioCleanEnrgy @justinjm1 That isn’t what she was saying.
@JT_MDMPH @justinjm1 What she said was perfectly logical
@Telefanmusic @justinjm1 @Sherribells1771 How? How did she do that?
@campagfan @justinjm1 Globalists are the enemy
@Spmony @justinjm1 She was simply explaining that Nationalism is not inherently bad and that Hitler was not completely a Nationalist
@exavierpope @justinjm1 What exactly did she say wrong?
