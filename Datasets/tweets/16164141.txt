@ArlvaJay @kylegriffin1 I'm in FL and in my county, not sure of statewide, I can go online and put in my DL# and change my party. Easy as that.  there are some states that are now open primary states, and some of their policies I like, I personally would like to see 1 primary, top 2 with ranking.
@ArlvaJay @kylegriffin1 when I worked on Obama's campaign in 2008, I was in the Dem headquarters, and the guy that was in charge was a Dem, (local) who was actually bragging about changing to a pub and voting for their least likely to win, so that the Dems could win, seems theirs already a problem...
@ArlvaJay @kylegriffin1 yes, that is correct, also the "Primaries" are paid for by taxpayer dollars. Aside from that, most "party" members don't realize that by having "just" party members participate, the "Country" becomes more tribalized. What are the "parties" afraid of??
