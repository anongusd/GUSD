@writinpixels @CdnPress Both are accepted and familiar terms that suggest no ambiguity, so one word, no hyphen
@writinpixels Treat the name of the tour as a composition, same as a song, book or album. So italics, or quotation marks if italics pose a problem for your system. The word ‚Äòtour‚Äô would not be included as part of the name, in most cases.
@HPHarvey Sorry for the holdup. Yes or No, capped and without question marks.
@kellidotca @CdnPress One word, no hyphen
@SWhyno @CdnPress I shot a man in Reno just to make him use it right
@CdnPress Perhaps the oft-misused ‚Äòfulsome,‚Äô the original definition of which is ‚Äòexcessively complimentary or effusive.‚Äô Now it also means ‚Äòabundant.‚Äô COD advises making clear, ‚Äúwhen using this word, which connotations are intended.‚Äù  A remarkable caveat from Oxford: use another word
@leeanne25 @CdnPress Current policy is capped when referring specifically to Bitcoin as a concept (the world has been changed by Bitcoin), and down when using it in the generic sense (it cost 25 bitcoins). That one will continue to evolve, I expect

@_sadafahsan @dustinparkes we‚Äôre as big a fan of Justin, Lance, Joey, Chris and J.C. as much as the next national news service, but rules are rules: special characters like the asterisk wreak havoc on older production systems; gratuitous use of all-caps impairs readability. #nsyncforever

@marrkbennett @jesstucker As a wire service, we have to keep our typography as simple as possible to avoid running afoul of the many computer systems that our clients have used over the decades. I‚Äôm sure the Chicago Manual of Style or similar can provide more detailed advice.

@dustinrgodfrey No, Indigenous Peoples is an umbrella term for all First Nations, Metis and Inuit people. It‚Äôs a unique, specialized term, similar to Governor General, that is meant to reflect the special status of those groups in Canada and should not be considered a grammatical root.
@dustinrgodfrey It‚Äôs Indigenous Peoples but Indigenous people (ergo Syilx people), and hereditary not capped.

@karenpinchin @Buote Hmm. Am always enthusiastic about alliterative allusions. Swallow hard and stick with fishers, though, whilst I ruminate.
@ebessner It may be on its way to falling out of favour but it is not currently expressly outlawed by CP.
@grayhamilton No, it‚Äôs because we try to keep acronyms to a minimum and because there was no suitable alternative in the case of PQ, NDP and UCP. ‚ÄòCoalition party‚Äô is a suitable alternative. Of course, if CAQ proves unavoidable, we can always revise.
@grayhamilton @perreaux @Alex_Panetta Always
@colbycosh The operative term is ‚Äúsometimes.‚Äù Giving licence to use acronyms is a tube that can‚Äôt be unsqueezed, and Coalition party/Coalition hardly seems unreasonable. That said, if CAQ ends up mopping the floor with it, we can always revisit.
@colbycosh We try to avoid copy studded with acronyms whenever possible, and not everyone outside Quebec will readily know what it stands for. It‚Äôs also meant to draw a distinction between CP style and that of our French service, which makes its own style decisions.

Correct. A day could come when the terms switch roles, as it has happened before. But today is not that day https://t.co/nPfQ5xNUO1
