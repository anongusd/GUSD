The @FCC's 1st open meeting of 2019 is scheduled for January 30. Typically, we release the tentative agenda 3 weeks before, but given the lapse in funding, we're moving ahead today.

1) Art. 4, Sec. 3: “no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State.” This raises the question posed in one of my favorite law review articles of all time: “Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?” (I hope not, @SenCapito!) https://t.co/yKBpaHRQmQ https://t.co/u0SHK4Rcne
2) Art 1, Sec 5: Sen/House leaders "may...compel the Attendance of Absent members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties, as each House may provide." In 1988, per this provision, then-Sen. Bob Packwood was arrested &amp; carried feet-first into the Senate! https://t.co/2H9h17qoMx
3) Art. 1, Sec. 8: Congress has the power to “grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal.” This allowed Congress to allow private parties—“privateers”—to seize property from foreign parties, e.g., ships or property. (This hasn’t been done in &gt;200 years, though.) https://t.co/zC573W3O5e https://t.co/faDQYnj8tu
4) Art. 1, Sec. 10: No state is allowed to “make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” Figured in debate over constitutionality of greenback’s creation during Civil War.
