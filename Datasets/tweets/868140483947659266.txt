@thehill This isn’t news.
@vir_geaux @Despoinou @sahluwal @matthewjdowd Protest government, not individuals. Protesting individuals only makes it worse because those individuals then group up and become organized Neo-Natzis and then stuff like Charlottesville happens.

@WarlockEyed @sahluwal @matthewjdowd No.
@maquisdubois @sahluwal @matthewjdowd Don’t call me an optimist. Doing what Natzis do to Natzis only makes more Natzis, albeit with a different intent but with methods just the same.
@maquisdubois @sahluwal @matthewjdowd I don’t think he’s a victim, I just think that if we really believe in fighting oppression we should keep the morale high ground.
@trixxxen @sahluwal @matthewjdowd We never should. But if we retaliate with the same thing he did or any other racist does, then we are just doing the same thing as him or them.
@DisgustedOkie @sahluwal @matthewjdowd There should be consequences, but they need to be different. Fighting one man doesn’t do anything for anybody it just causes more problems.
@Homecoming_1987 @sahluwal @matthewjdowd If public shaming levels the playing field, then I can’t wait to see what the Natzi do next to tip the balance in their favor again. Doing something that is EXACTLY something a Neo-Natzi would do doesn’t make you any better than them.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd ...especially when most of the people there are only there for ONE MAN. If a crowd showed up in front of your house and told you to change your thinking or else, I don’t think I would be wrong in assuming you’d be a little unnerved would I?
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd You can’t feel protests online, and a protest is only a protest when it’s peaceful. A MOB showing up outside somebody’s house doesn’t convey a “racism is wrong” message, and something tells me the people who dox people won’t be very “peaceful” in a protest...
@FeloniousBunk @sahluwal @matthewjdowd That’s not the only method of learning, if MLK was (for the most part) able to do it without violence, then we should lead by his example.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd But that requires physical confrontation. The disconnect between human beings over the internet is never helpful. And if the internet bleeds into the real world, well who do you think they will blame? The people they hate.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd You fight oppression with protests, and rallies, and going out there and SHOWING everybody that YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING TOO. In time, they will be forced to accept you, because if they didn’t they would be truly ignorant. And even the most ignorant can still become informed.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd But now this guy is going to FEEL like the victim, however much he deserves it. The method of fighting oppression isn’t oppressing oppressors. Then they will just fight harder, albeit with some new Neo-Natzi friends who are his ONLY friends now because everybody else showed hate.
@sahluwal @matthewjdowd If the WHOLE WORLD turns against him then he will just find people (I.e Neo-Natzis, KKK, etc.) and THOSE people will be his only friends. He’ll entrench himself in an echo-chamber of hate and he’ll be even worse than before.
@Homecoming_1987 @sahluwal @matthewjdowd There SHOULD be consequences, but they should be local. We don’t need internet public shaming. That makes EVERYTHING worse because then he’ll just search for people who agree with him (I.e Neo-Natzis) and then he’ll be even worse than before because EVERYBODY went against him.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd Well that can’t be how laws or democracy works. We can’t exclude people their natural rights (in this case privacy) just because they may want to exclude others from those same rights. It HAS to be all or nothing or else we just become THEM.
@vir_geaux @Despoinou @sahluwal @matthewjdowd Don’t deny the fact that there are organizations fueled by hatred in this country that will do anything to get new members like this guy and oppress minorities. That is absolutely asinine. We can’t keep pushing people into these groups or they will just become bigger problems.
@Feebeekiwi @sahluwal @matthewjdowd No. I’m saying don’t dox people. Don’t let people bully you, but don’t ruin somebody’s livelihood in retaliation. That will make them hate you more, and find people (Neo-Natzis, KKK, etc.) to support their opinions and entrench themself further into hatred.
@Despoinou @sahluwal @matthewjdowd You have to try to convince them, and make them realize on their OWN that their hatred toward other races is wrong. If your hostile to them, they’ll just fight back.
@Despoinou @sahluwal @matthewjdowd Then where would he go? Because he WOULD find support. It would just be with similarly minded people. Public shaming is why we have Neo-Natzi and KKK problems today. When you publicly shame people, they form groups to fight back. There is a better way to show them their errors.
@sahluwal @matthewjdowd Stop encouraging doxing. This guy is incorrect but if people harass him for harassing people he’ll just harass more people in defense. The “me against the world” mentality is very powerful, and should never be underestimated.

@AtlasStrained @larryelder @Gunalizer @realDonaldTrump If there wasn’t “infringement” on the 2nd Amendment then people would be legally allowed to have RPGs and mortars. If we allowed ALL arms to be had by any individual, then this country would be in complete chaos.
@Datestamp @Gunalizer @_elizaaaaaa What are you going to do that isn’t either illegal or something the cops can’t do better? Let police handle it you don’t need an armed mob doing vigilante service.
@larryelder @Gunalizer @realDonaldTrump So restricting the 2nd Amendment would not stop a dictatorship as it is currently interpreted, because not everybody who owns a gun can stand up to a trained army (yes, a state militia would also probably not fair well, but it would fair better and 50 states means 50 militias).
@larryelder @Gunalizer @realDonaldTrump The purpose of the 2nd Amendment was in case the British came back, and it only said to have state militias. The Supreme Court would change the meaning to mean just the right to bear arms. A state militia would do much better at stopping a dictatorship than people.
@krassenstein I don’t understand why people criticize the media for talking about negative things. The negative things are the most important things people usually need to know. I get how she might be feeling though when everybody talks about her husband’s affair, it must be humiliating.
@JoeWiz20 @prageru Yeah, but you can’t really compare gender to something like that. I’m not saying gender is a “spectrum” or anything, but if someone identifies as something and you don’t agree, it’s just rude to say “no you are a woman”. Even though they went through the transformation process.
@sean_spoonts @ElectionLawCtr This is about tech companies and him saying that the government should not get involved in how they handle hate-speech, conspiracies, etc.

@ElectionLawCtr ...stays out of it because it’s a slippery slope. First it’s hate speech, then it’s criticism, then it’s just free-speech entirely. That’s what he was saying.
@ElectionLawCtr Still not enough context. He was responding to a question about tech companies being unable to properly handle/filter all the hate speech and conspiracy theories on their sites. He wa saying that it would be great if they could be gotten rid of, but it’s better our government...
@ElectionLawCtr My god this got launched into space it’s so out in context! Watch the video in that article.
@mitchellvii Again, the Mueller investigation is not about any other president than Trump. Bringing up other presidents is pointless.
@JoeWiz20 @prageru That is the stereotype, and that doesn’t mean they all think there are more than 2 genders. And comparing murder with transgenderism is also wrong.
@JoeWiz20 @prageru Yes Canada does have a law like that, but it’s only one example and it’s one that many people, including transgender people, agree is wrong. And transgender people are people who switched from the two genders. Transgender people aren’t the viral video people who say there is more
@JoeWiz20 @prageru Well nothing is actually forcing you. If you identify as a man and somebody kept calling you “girl” you would be pretty put off.
@JoeWiz20 @prageru Okay well you just changed your statement from “changing genders isn’t possible” to “people are forced to change genders”. Also I doubt anybody is forcing people to change genders.
@prageru Though I wouldn’t entirely say I prefer socialism to capitalism, both have their problems.
@prageru I really don’t get why people compare the United States to Venezuela. Venezuela was a banana republic for oil, and when oil prices went down their economy crashed. The US is not dependent on one resource.
@JoeWiz20 @prageru Well if a man undergoes surgery to become a woman I don’t see why it’s so wrong to call her a woman.
@DailySignal The two terms only thing is probably my favorite part about him though, since he pretty much willingly gave away power. That is one if his bigger impacts on the US DURING his presidency though.

@dbongino No it isn’t. He said exactly that. It also says he clarified his statement later in the article. The Hill is a very trustworthy news site. If you get stuck on the title and don’t actually read the article then that’s just ignorant. #FakeNewsMedia
@theblaze Well it’s both. A human achievement for getting there and an American achievement for getting there first.
@thehill is also very credible
Not all media is fake news, but all fake news is media. If your news outlet is sharing their opinion or the opinion of somebody that agrees with them (therefore, choosing how you think) then they are not credible. Go to news like @AP instead. They only voice truth. #FakeNews
You don’t need to create useless propaganda to prove your point. You can back it up with sources instead. #SaveOurDemocracy #Vote

Whatever side of politics you are on, you should always be the most skeptical of your own side. If you aren’t, then your openly creating an echo chamber, which isn’t healthy for anyone. #Politics #guncontrol #Trump #MuellerInvestigation #Liberal

@thehill I don’t believe in using force to disperse a protest, but I do believe in keeping two opposing protests away from each other so they don’t kill each other, and making sure protests don’t turn violent.
Astroturfing shouldn’t be legal. It removes the authenticity of protests and makes people cynical of protesters. That is incredibly dangerous to our democracy and our public discourse. We cannot let fake protesters ruin our society. Companies like Crowds on Demand need to stop.

@nytopinion @nytimes @BretStephensNYT Yes, but tweets can reveal political stances and opinions. Some people didn’t like what Sarah had to tweet about white people, and so they tweeted about her, revealing their opinions. We may not be our tweets but they ARE part of us, along with the rest of the internet.
@ndrew_lawrence Change happens, now yes illegal immigration is a different (and more difficult) topic. But legal immigration is just that, legal. To say that they are causing a problem or disrupting anything by being irrefutably US citizens is asinine. Change won’t go away, we just have to adapt
@nytimesbusiness @nytimes However, there are people over the internet who type terrible things, make death threats and threatening to harm others. I believe that is where law enforcement should get involved. Anything else and it’s freedom of speech, albeit at its ugliest.
@nytimesbusiness @nytimes If we ban comments for being rude, then when do we start banning comments for being incorrect? For when they disagree with what you believe in?
@nytimesbusiness @nytimes I agree with finding better methods to remove bots and not taking things at face value, but I do not agree with censorship of comments. The internet allows you to say whatever you want without repercussions, that’s the appeal. Not to mention that censorship is a slippery slope.

Prosecutors are allowed to withhold information and evidence if they “think” its irrelevant to their cases. I wonder how many of those prosecutors actually thought the information was irrelevant.
The internet is the future. Your voice can be heard to everybody all over the world because of it. And it’s infinitely easier to state your opinion on anything.		So do it.		#Debate #Freedom #1stAmendment
@nytopinion @nytimes America isn’t Australia.		Nearly a third of the country has guns, why would they want their guns taken away?		Comparing America to any other country is an invalid argument, certain issues mean more in certain places and to certain people.
@JBurtonXP Hating white people still makes you racist. I really don’t get why people don’t understand that.
@MaggieJordanACN Well so far no wars have started during the Trump administration. He’s probably guilty, but people should state facts instead of opinions when it comes to politics.

@hiranger223 @NRA These 3D guns are made from 3D printers, so you wouldn’t need to go to a gun store to get them. The problem is that your basically MAKING illegal guns in your backyard. With the easiness of it it is a legitimate threat to the NRA’s business, these plastic guns DO work. #3Dprinted
@realDonaldTrump Not for politicians at least.
Not to say we SHOULDN’T talk about it, but we might need a faster solution to all these school shootings and other gun related problems.
@Popehat @cjane87 And then get criticized for their stupid comments.
@hiranger223 @NRA So? They should state their opinion on this.
@KathleenRoss24 @kylegriffin1 “Innocent until proven guilty” and all that
@KathleenRoss24 @kylegriffin1 Well I believe he’s most likely guilty, but the investigation is still going on, so I choose to stay patient and wait until after the investigation is complete
@KathleenRoss24 @kylegriffin1 (?) meaning if there would even be any reward to lying to the public in something as sensitive as this...
@KathleenRoss24 @kylegriffin1 Oh, well if Trump was caught lying then the backlash would be terrible. I don’t think the risk is worth the possible (?) reward
Or at least have the influential people @ other influential people to spark civil discourse between opposing sides.
It shouldn’t hurt to be nice to your political opponents. If you rage at them they’ll rage back and nothing is gained. I’m not saying you can’t swear in a debate, but you shouldn’t tell a conservative to fuck off if your a liberal when talking about gun control. #debate #politics
People need to @ people more. Confrontation is how debate works, so why not start it online, where it’s much easier to say what you want?
@NRA What’s your opinion on 3D guns @NRA ? Logically you should be against it since it would be bad for business...
@Bradybuzz The @NRA doesn’t talk about this. Really they should be against this since 3D guns would mean nobody would buy theirs.
@hannahgais @TheRoot Because it doesn’t really matter.

@fiona_mccool @InezFeltscher @VixenRogue @ishapiro It’s bad for parents to want a job? Parents need to provide to their families. That being said, sometimes parents miss out on important parts of their child’s life. This policy (the 4 hour training) helps parents have well paying jobs while still seeing their children.
@InezFeltscher @ishapiro Thirty hours is insane. I see no need to change the current policy, four hours should be enough.
@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Fear mongering should not be needed to make @realDonaldTrump guilty. There is an investigation going on to prove that for us. Or prove he’s innocent.
@l_flynn_22 @BlueBoxDave @InezFeltscher Yes but it is polite.
@BlueBoxDave @InezFeltscher Bowing is appropriate. Doesn’t matter if you’re not British.
@JBurtonXP But stuff like “WELL YOUR JUST A STUPID BIGOT SJSJSMDUBWKWHSKSO” is dumb and gets people nowhere.
@JBurtonXP I agree arguing with someone over their own bigotry is stupid. But I believe it’s important to know where somebody stands towards other races. Debate is key to democracy, and if somebody thinks Jews are ruining the country by being foreigners, then they should be debated against.
@Bradybuzz @nytimes Wow. 3-D printers just got a WHOLE lot more controversial.
@InezFeltscher I think it’s more on the parents decision on who does what chore than there actually being a gender gap for kids. For example if the girls did the chores the boys did and vice versa, then the gender gap for children would be reversed. I doubt this actually has a societal impact.
@kylegriffin1 This investigation is important, if it bears any fruit it could mean our president committed treason. So good on him for planning for the worst.
@kylegriffin1 Yes because the government needs to pay them to house the kids. Regardless of the current immigrant situation those kids need some place to go, and the longer this controversy drags on the more it’s gonna cost.
@Bradybuzz It says in that article that there are methods to help prevent things like this from happening that doesn’t remove guns from homes. You should address those arguments. #GunControlNow #2ndAmendment
That only ends in their victory. #BlackLivesMatter #WhiteSupremacy #peace
Don’t give them a reason to fear you. Everybody should at least try to be less hostile. I am aware that they are the ones that usually start these things, but we shouldn’t let them rile everybody up
White supremacy is stupid, but the people who are supremacists aren’t. They are just scared. Scared that they will lose their jobs, family, livelihoods to somebody else. The difference in color is just an afterthought. Poverty causes racism. More importantly fear causes it
By sparking debate, solutions are solved. Albeit not fast, but that is a sacrifice that should be made to keep democracy and equality in place. Everyone’s opinion should matter to everyone, not just with people you agree with. #politics #democracy #opinions #debates #Tolerance
Tolerance is something nobody has had lately in the political sphere. Many liberals practically excommunicate fellow liberals for having a different viewpoint than them, while conservatives have many problems with tolerance as well (I.e. @infowars). #Conservatives #Liberals
Teenagers should not own guns. Think of it this way, if the minimum age requirement for drinking alcohol in America is 21 years old, and it’s more socially acceptable to drink than carry a gun, then why should teenagers be allowed to carry guns?
@Rwhite506 @LazzariMirko @NRA How do you know every single legal gun owner would shoot dead every criminal that comes into their life?
@Rwhite506 @LazzariMirko @NRA I don’t trust you though, that’s why I asked
@Rwhite506 @LazzariMirko @NRA How would you know that?
@Rwhite506 @LazzariMirko @NRA And then the criminal shoots back
@LazzariMirko @NRA So if criminals have illegal guns, crime won’t stop.
@NRA No it’s not, just because everybody has guns doesn’t mean crime will stop.
@SThompson55367 @NRA I’m sorry I misread one of your tweets. What do you think the proper age requirement for carrying a firearm is?
@SThompson55367 @NRA In terms of physical harm, I mean.
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump Nothing in that article directly points Trump as the cause of the unemployment rate dropping. At least when they said that during Obama’s run the main cause of the increase to unemployment was the 2008 recession.
@SThompson55367 @NRA Yeah, I agree. I just think that the requirement should be higher than what it is. (Not insanely, but at least higher than what it is to drink alcohol, 21 years old, since people generally consider guns are worse over alcohol)
@RichardDonewell @jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow Oh right sorry, yes I do believe Dean is against Muslim Sharia.
@RichardDonewell @jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow I again ask that you read the article in the tweet.
@RichardDonewell @jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow Dean is the guy Jim hates, and just because something is a biblical principle doesn’t mean it should be done because of that religion. Being nice COULD be stated as a religious principle, but that’s not why everybody does it, some people be nice because being rude is rude.
@RichardDonewell @jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow Read the article then what I said might make more sense, I was agreeing with @DeanObeidallah
@SThompson55367 @NRA As in you should be older before being allowed a firearm.
@SThompson55367 @NRA Yeah, meaning it’s currently not at that age requirement. So, the tweet still stands.
@RichardDonewell @jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow Yeah...
@authorclaire1 Well about that military thing, the military give service weapons to those who enlisted. The thing about assaults on campuses is a fair point though.
@sapinker @QuilletteM Free Speech is a tool of peace and a weapon of war, how people use it determines which.
@InezFeltscher And then people, assuming it’s the will of God, support it.
@InezFeltscher You know what, you’re right. I apologize, I assumed that religion was the problem, it isn’t. But there are some people who interpret there religion in a way that works only to the detriment of others. So the problem is that some people use the Bible to justify certain actions.
@SThompson55367 @NRA I tweeted that because the tweet from the NRA quoted from the article that being deemed too young to carry a gun was a threat to the pro guns community. I assumed they were saying that people younger than the current requirement should be allowed guns.
@jimstinson @DeanObeidallah @SteveDeaceShow The church should be separated from the state so as to avoid biased and potentially segregation based laws and regulations.
@NRA This article seems very biased and leans more toward speculation than actual facts. The facts it does give also don’t really reveal anything new.
I feel like one of the problems with stopping school shootings is that while stricter gun laws WOULD help, that’s the only way people are willing to fix the problem. If nobody is gonna budge on gun laws then you need try to find another solution/solutions before debating on guns.
@NRA Or we could make it harder to obtain guns illegally...
@NRA Teenagers should not own guns. Think of t this way, if the minimum age requirement for drinking alcohol in America is 21 years old, and it’s more socially acceptable to drink than carry a gun, then why are teenagers (by that I mean 13-19 years by the way) allowed to carry guns?
@realDonaldTrump They are great media empires, even if they do go out of business, it won’t be in 7 years. Also, not all their sources are anonymous.
People need to break their echo chambers and start listening to what the other side of the political spectrum is saying (whatever that other side is). Not doing so is doing the equivalent of arguing with someone who actually agrees with you.
@InezFeltscher That pic still shows a considerable number of people stating economic reasons on that chart. And why is wanting leisure time a bad thing?
@realDonaldTrump Or, we could just not orphan children and attempt to resolve the issue much more efficiently...
@realDonaldTrump No, we can’t do that because if we did it would be displacement, which is where people are forced to leave the country without a fair trial. That’s what racist dictatorships that don’t want to start a genocide do.
@RyanAFournier @NRA And because we won our freedom over the British Empire, who attempted to raise taxes upon the 13 colonies and when we said no they tried to force it on us.
@CalebJHull I agree the media is biased, but these are bad examples. Front pages need hooks for readers to care.
@msmacb They shouldn’t have revealed his license. That’s potentially dangerous.
