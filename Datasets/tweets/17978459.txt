Have a civil conversation today with someone whom you disagree.  Listen.  Try to understand their perspective.  Be the positive change.
@TheSeaFarmer @TimetoOpine @mattklewis That's horrible, please show me where this is happening.
@TheSeaFarmer @TimetoOpine @mattklewis We all do.  That should go without saying.
@TheSeaFarmer @TimetoOpine @mattklewis What makes you hate so much?  I never said I agree with his politics, btw.  I hope you find some peace, brother.
@jks417 @mattklewis Are you using the "They started it!" Defense?
@mattklewis Surprising how much resistance there is to someone promoting civility.  People really want to latch on to their hate.  So sad.
@TheSeaFarmer @TimetoOpine @mattklewis I think he was referring to their tactics than specific policy.  Congrats on getting enraged and missing the point.  I'll pray for you.
@djmedici @The_Tyler_Grant Maybe we should focus on the vast majority of things we agree.  Doing the opposite isn't working very well.
This is where we start. https://t.co/dFClpiSdqL
The RNC has put up 7 mil in Iowas 4th district to replace long incumbent steve king.  Retaliation for backing cruz?
Look!    cnbc10home . com
Researching HSA's.  I'm quickly discovering this could be a big part of the health care solution. #tcot
@Palinspired Obama doesn't want you to bring that up.  That recession was cured by tax and spending cuts.
Is it bad that I'm a little happy that most the negative political headlines today have to to do with democrats?
Alan Greenspan should be put in a jail cell with Ben Bernake.  Maybe than they could live in a tiny government-run utopia.
@mortimas
@mortimas Damn.  Do you Rahm will keep his job?
@mortimas good deal, stupid N-days.  Did teeps do everything alright or did you have to talk him off of the ledge after the fire?
@mortimas and yes, he is a d bag.
@mortimas you guys actually went?
@mortimas it's f'n hilarious.
@mortimas did you read the reply to that ad sherwood smith wrote?
@IndyEnigma I'm sick of "stupidity & malicious political posturing" too.  Let them file chapter 11.
@IndyEnigma I agree. It shows how little she knows about basic economics.  I'm so tired of the scare tactics.
Pelosi should take an econ course.  Failure is part of a free market.  That's how tell what products work and which ones don't.
I think even then they won't know.  The gov. of MI said today the GOP is sending us into a depression b/c they didn't vote 4 the bailout.
I'm betting that most "American people" have now idea what the chief-of-staff does.
@tomllewis That's the scary part.  I'm sure they know who's going to win survivor though.
The question is whether the American people will finally wake up and see this for what it is.
Hilarious? Yes!  Believable?  No.
Maybe Obama should have talked to Bill Clinton before he appointed Emanuel.  Bill could have told him what a weasel he is.
@Alandana The Messiah said he should and we all know that we must do what the Messiah says....
@LeaHendryValle Yeah, I would imagine so, I'm lucky enough that mine didn't.
Hold your congressmen's feet to the fire.  Let them know your disgust if they voted yea.
The chief-of-staff in waiting can't go vote on such an important bill? #tcot
@daltonsbriefs Because the UAW doesn't build houses.
#tcot MI senator Debbie Stabenow on foxnews, "Bankruptcy doesn't work for the auto industry."  Someone give her Lee Iacocca's phone # please
#tcot That 5 million figure is how much it takes for a candidate to have a shot at winning.  I'm not sure how it costs the state to run it.
@tsufish I know a senate race in neighboring Iowa costs about 5 million...
#tcot  It looks like Rep. Mark Kirk could have a chance.  http://www.politico.com/blogs/scorecard/
#tcot This whole scandal probably will hurt Blagojeveich's 15% approval rating.  Yes, it was 15% before today.
@ChrisGrewe It worked for Osborne in NE.  It would be funny to see him yell at Harry Reid!
#tcot  does anybody know anyone that can challenge that seat in Illinios?
I'm going to trade my dollars for pesos.  They might be worth more a year from now.
Warm up the printers!  Obama wants a trillion dollar stimulus package.  What's the total up to now?  5.3 trillion?
@mortimas there's no way it's worth 83 dollars!!
@mortimas Yeah, they arrested the Governor and his chief of staff today.  Evidently they tried to sell Obama's vacated seat.
@mortimas Someone should tell old Al that 2008 was the coldest year in a decade.  I'm freezing my @ss off over here.
@mortimas I read today that the energy sect. job will probably go to Ahhhnold the govinator.  Can we pull his republican card now, please?
Wondering if I should be concerned that my black lab keeps putting my wife's new westie puppie's head in his mouth?
