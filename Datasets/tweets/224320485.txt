.@senatemajldr on the Senate floor now so should be some action shortly
Once government actually reopens @speakerpelosi said a date would be determined and she would welcome the president to the Capitol. https://t.co/Z7QpluLz4J

Democratic leader @SenSchumer says while his party opposes the Trump wall they are willing to fund other security measures.
McConnell says there is an agreement and ‚Äúwe can make that happen‚Äù TODAY
By announcing a short term deal today, the president can also give the news cycle another major story to compete for oxygen with Roger Stone indictment.
Sources on the Hill say the mechanics of how this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù is enacted quickly will come after the president concludes his remarks.
.@SpeakerPelosi landed two major victories: by withholding SOTU address she deprived @potus of a major platform AND she gets government reopened first and then lawmakers negotiate border security spending over next weeks.  Win and win strategically.
The president needs to frame this as a deal he announced and not as a surrender. https://t.co/19w0KWTBBi

The president embraces the Kavanaugh effect ...
"Like Oprah Winfrey who I like...she worked very hard in Georgia, very hard. I don't know if she likes me any more?" @realDonaldTrump compliments the "talented" and well funded Democrats who ran for governor races.

I did not say ‚Äúcarried live.‚Äù I have zero control over that.  Network producers make those calls. That exchange was about ‚Äúcovering‚Äù and documenting every event.  That we do all the time for presidents and major candidates. https://t.co/7KfewXnpmO
Funny thing is...my tweet is accurate.  I lived it.  I see the anger boiling from the left and right while on the road.  I get it.  We cover it.  Sadly, such contempt is tossed about so casually. https://t.co/wY0GvTcz9f
@lholtt Your comment seems to ignore simple facts about the long standing existence of rallies and assumes an unkind intention that just isn‚Äôt there.

Arrived in New Jersey after midnight for coverage of @realDonaldTrump vacation time here.  Goodnight.  Peace all.
@PaulaEquine I responded to her assertion that presidents do not campaign while in office.  They do.  There is an election in 3 months.  I also said Trump does more than predecessors.  He savors rallies.  That‚Äôs true.
Really?  Presidents campaign during midterm years for their party and run for re-election. Rallies are standard.  Trump likes the rally as an outlet and does more than predecessors but campaigning while in office is not unusual. https://t.co/VXpeswJyOo
Well, I covered both Presidents Obama and Bush, even some Clinton, and yes every rally, speech and event in public was covered by WH traveling press. Your perception is at odds with the facts. https://t.co/cMdeQG2t9P

After a long day and Trump evening rally, on the road trip to NJ, I‚Äôm watching @rhony_bravo taking a vacation.  Good. Right?
@QuakerRabbi It means after he took office.
Tonight‚Äôs takeaway: Hours after his top intelligence chiefs united in their alarm about ongoing Russian election interference, @realDonaldTrump said the ‚ÄúRussian hoax‚Äù is ‚Äúhindering ‚Äú the US relationship with Russia at his PA rally.

"I am not another politician‚Ä¶I keep my promises‚Ä¶.I didn‚Äôt need it. I had a very nice life. I used to actually get good press.	I didn‚Äôt need this but I love it." @realDonaldTrump		"
"Fake news" chants from the right &amp; constant demands to stop covering Trump rallies from the left are both examples of angry venting on a free press that undercuts our Constitutionally protected role.  Far from perfect, but we are doing our jobs the best we can everyday. https://t.co/8I9wUHlA2C

Unfortunate.  Two guys leading chants against media 2 and half hours before rally.  Campaign requires media be ‚Äúescorted‚Äù to work area.  Most of us have been through more security background screening than attendees. https://t.co/r4ie8xdb3e
This is a frequent question/comment.  When an event like this is organized by the campaign, it‚Äôs a privately funded event not at taxpayer expense.  Some security and support costs of president‚Äôs travel can  also be at government expense. https://t.co/rCM7H1RNZV
And now..."YMCA" is blaring.
It is our job to cover campaign rallies and any other public events where -this president and -any- president appears. We are here to document what happens. Its that simple.

Trump also claimed here that cameras/media did not follow Bush and Obama the same way they follow him.  But of course, there were many who went everywhere with those presidents as well.  Presidents get plenty of media interest.
"They're dying to see us make a little bit of a mistake" @realDonaldTrump referring to the media again and claims media focused on "Does he like Russia?"

So lots of tough immigration talk but no explicit mention of the issues that dominated this week....no "zero tolerance"..no executive order...no family separations. @realDonaldTrump at GOP convention in Las Vegas
Local matterS.  After saying he knows how to pronounce the state's name and certain Dems do not...he wrapped up saying Nev--AHH-da then caught himself and said Ne-VAD-a which is the preferred in state.
"These are sick, evil people..." @realDonaldTrump defying critics of his use of "animals description" on MS13 in the context of immigration."I will be back a lot" to Nevada crowd
"Their word is "resist." They think that will get them into office" @realDonaldTrump claiming Democrats would oppose any kind of policy for immigration in this election year.
"I think I got elected largely  because we are strong on the border" @realDonaldTrump then he moved on to Obamacare.  Will he skip the family separation issue and his executive order while in Nevada??
"If they see any weakness, they will come by the millions." @realDonaldTrump speaks on his hard line regarding immigration policy.
.@realDonaldTrump inaccurately claims the proper name is "Democrat Party"....it is not.

Michael Flynn at @RealOmarNavarro endorsement also said, "So what human is perfect? What human has no faults? The greatness of each of us as Americans is our innate ability to get knocked down, get right back up, shake it off and get right back into the fight."
@brannonmc @The_Hansenator @realDonaldTrump People use it without understanding its roots...that was the whole point. I am not suggesting there was intention...you are reading far too much into it.
Michael Flynn, former Natl Security Adv, who pleaded guilty for lying in Russia probe told CA audience "I'm not here to complain about who has done me wrong...or how unfair I've been treated" as he endorsed candidate @RealOmarNavarro
