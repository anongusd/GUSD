@donetiredofit @nowthisnews @BernieSanders No one right now. These are just my thoughts.
@donetiredofit @nowthisnews @BernieSanders I think we should really make it a lot easier to start and run companies. Perhaps no taxes on a startup for two years to encourage disruption. Make it more free. For example minimum wage is ridiculous. If I want to work why make it illegal? Also legalize prostitution.
@donetiredofit @nowthisnews @BernieSanders Instead of a carbon tax what about a phased in carbon tax, give the market time to adapt. Trade tariffs to make domestic manufacturing more attractive and raise wages. Ranked choice voting that would make voting for who you want not who you don’t want easier.
We should have dialogue. If a side doesn’t support dialogue they have no place in America. https://t.co/3nmNwjr87L
@nowthisnews @BernieSanders I’m also working class and think his ideas are stupid. I have way better ideas. Just cause you come from somewhere doesn’t mean you know anything.,

@EdgeofSports @IlhanMN If you want to question our relationship with Israel and not be seen as someone with ulterior motives maybe don’t say anything anti-semetic
@tomjconley @platozkv Generally yes.
@NuanceBro @RealSaavedra @AOC Really? I know she praised Ilhan Omar’s apology but didn’t know she specifically condemned this tweet? And I still think the all about the benjamins quote was intentioned as anti Semitic. You don’t get benefit of the doubt when you were antisemetic in the past
@NuanceBro @RealSaavedra @AOC And are you sure are you just making an assumption? Not like there is any context here.
@NuanceBro @RealSaavedra @AOC Not like AOC condemned her old tweets.

@PardesSeleh Immortality
@SebGorka @RandPaul It’s actually easy to see where he’s coming from. While I disagree with him on this specific issues it’s not a bad idea to try and actively limit the power of government from time to time, and has nothing to do with ego.
@AOC Damn guys she compared two things that don’t equate to make us look stupid and her five second attention span base will eat it right up.
@OfficialSPGB @MQSullivan They nationalized their oil industry and a majority of the farms. You can’t blame the private market for this, as thugs we’re going well under the private system, but when the government grew then things failed. Obvious socialist failure.
I do not think this is wrong, but it demonstarages even if we had great efficient public transportation like AOC advocates for people will still choose the alternative. And it’s very hypocritical. https://t.co/HAl3Iheckb
@RoKhanna I guarantee you under the green New deal the country will still face climate change, just not have the strong economy to deal with it.
@RealSaavedra The thing the government ruined is going to be replaced by the government?
@NuanceBro @DrRandPaul Well the President should have some amount of power, and even libertarians believe defending the country is a legitimate role of the government. With that in mind some of Trump’s executive overreach is justified. A well elected congress will provide an appropriate check.

@IlhanMN @RoKhanna @SenSanders If you want lower prices open it up to the free market
@4YrsToday The hell with the 33% yes
@platozkv I think generally speaking private individuals make better choices of what to do with their money. If you want a beer but the government doesn’t provide beer you don’t get it. That’s why the free market is great, because it gives people what they want.
@platozkv I’m lightly regulated free market anti globalist.
@platozkv Regulated capitalism is regulated capitalism. Socialism is collective ownership. Why don’t you start saying regulated capitalism if that’s what you think, which really isn’t an unreasonable idea if done in moderation
@platozkv What do you think socialism is? How bout a democracy where everyone owns the means of production collectively and vote on how companies are run. Is that what you advocate for because it sure sounds like it and that is Socialist.
@RandPaul I kinda agree but this is an actual invasion worthy of action, and I understand Democrats would abuse this power if they ever got into office
@platozkv Wow you owe only need 20% of your citizens to work for the government for your economy to collapse? Goddam. And these high tax countries are all free markets. Socialists economies don’t survive.
@PeterBeinart @realDonaldTrump @CNN @RepAdamSchiff @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Well Ilan Omar would’ve thrown in an anti Semitic insult in there
@ComplicKate @MotherJones He could probably win with about $40 million in expenditures. He doesn’t spend a lot on campaigns because good products sell by word of mouth. He could probably get $100 million for his jet alone.
@tinitini808 If he wins we’ll have food lines all around America like that
@platozkv And even though they have some Socialist features they owe their success to the free market
@platozkv Yeah they got problems but they’re around and their citizens generally enjoy good quality lives. All the Socialist countries collapsed in the last century when the people got fed up with being hungry. For example I’d rather have an obesity problem than a starvation one.
@MotherJones He could always just liquidate assets which Trump has plenty of.
@platozkv Why don’t you name a single successful socialist country and I’ll start listing free market countries.		USA	England	Norway	France	Germany	Austria	Argentina	Australia	Canada	Japan	South Korea	Taiwan	Sweden	Denmark	Spain		I can go on
@platozkv Wow China opened up it’s market and adopted free market reforms and is succeeding? Oh but the authoritarian aspects of China socialism requires did bad and screwed up the countries demographics and forces organ harvested a million people. What a surprise.
@platozkv https://t.co/J0OxPHZWXJ
@platozkv You’re doing a lot of deflecting. The free market works. Look at cars for example. No one was making a good enough car,  so some smart people made a really great car at Tesla and now it’s taking off. That’s an example of the free market.
@People4Bernie @BernieSanders Anyone have an example of these voter suppression laws. All the evidence I’ve seen of them are things like preventing felons on parole from voting.
@People4Bernie @BernieSanders Compared to a Trump rally I see how you could call that a small gathering
@torinemard @DeptofDefense School shooting happening		Teachers drive to the airport, board the plane, and fire a 125mm explosive round at the school leveling the building
@platozkv American poverty is like Venezuela 1%.
@platozkv Not really. You grow food inside your country generally, and the reason they had sanctions is because they do bad things like imprison journalists and rig elections. Venezuela doesn’t have food because the nationalized Socialist food industry failed.
@platozkv Inequality is not bad if it’s consensual 		The rust belt has been unable to adapt. People have to get good useful skills if they want to compete with a changing economy, and they’re doing better now that we have tariffs.		Most people work.
RT @DeptofDefense: Her-cu-les, Her-cu-les!	You don’t want to be on the receiving end of this gunship, aka the Angel of Death. https://t.co/…
@platozkv Airplanes, cars, electronics, refrigerators, big houses, media, large portions of food. All of these were luxuries 150 years ago now every American has them. All of these struggling Americans make an easily avoidable mistake, like teenage pregnancy or bad college major.
@platozkv Trains across the world built by free market people like Vanderbilt bring amazing goods across the country. I got a Pineapple in Colorado yesterday for cheap, all because of the free market.
@platozkv Saying the free market doesn’t work is a sine. You’re using a product invented by the free market to type this. Whatever phone, tablet, or laptop you invented the government had almost no business developing.
@platozkv Right cause food is so expensive in America. In most of America you can find a factory job in America at $12/hr with healthcare. In one day you could buy 20 McDonalds burgers. These “starving” people have no one to blame but themselves.
@Tmtisclutch @joannas0630 I mean it’s kinda an impoverished country. Only way to go from murdering half your country is up.
@platozkv I have a feeling they’d have more food if it was privatized. Guess it’s just a coincidence that the free market succeeds and “it’s not real socialism” always fails.
Chavez put price controls on food		As people farmed less food Chavez then nationalized many farms and supermarkets 		Venezuela now has no food.		Candidates like Bernie and Kamala are trying to move to step 2 with State healthcare. Make no mistake it will fail.
@platozkv @LeeCamp Oh I forgot the weapons manufacturing thing. Yeah I’m the USA that’s a problem but I’m optimistic we’ll start cutting military funding. I think Trump wants to go that route, so we’ll just have to convince our senators.
@LeeCamp @platozkv We mostly have that world now. Just need Africa, Middle East, parts of Asia and Venezuela to shape up. Western civilization is doing pretty good in peace and quality of life and environmentalism.
@4YrsToday Honestly every presidency deserves a good and bad movie
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Everyone wants their kid to have the best possible future and I know it can be hard to talk about affirmative action when you’re so close to it. I’m sure your kid worked hard but you must acknowledge it’s likely the race of some kids gave them an advantage in admissions.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino What Federal money your state is in debt? They routinely ask for money for failing infrastructure projects like your most expensive and slowest train ever. You know a problem is bad when Elon Musk proposes a solution.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino If this wasn’t a problem I guess no the students would lose this court case against Harvard:	https://t.co/HNfhTRSoIW
@JensJenson1 It’s not nonsense there is obvious discrimination against those white and Asian kids in admissions.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Yeah nice deflection. When I said black I misread your username and should’ve said brown. If your not same shade of brown then I find it offensive you’d masquerade as such. You still didn’t address the points that your state sucks.
@JensJenson1 This isn’t racism. Racism is discriminating against Asian students for brown students.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Your username. Maybe black was an assumption, guess you could be any shade of brown, but it doesn’t negate that the shades of brown minus Indian get disproportionate advantages getting into many colleges.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino And do you really coexist when crime is on the rise? Do you coexist while Skid row resembles a third world country. Good thing you got Silicon Valley otherwise your tax base would’ve fallen long ago. By most metrics your state sucks.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Woah you got kids who are at least part black into universities that lower their admission criteria for them? Good job? It’s not hard to beat out public school students when entire schools can’t even speak English. Must be nice to own considering rent is highest in the nation.
@JensJenson1 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Yeah you’re doing alright? Didn’t know your public schools miraculously got better, your debt got paid off, your train projects completed, your inequality wasn’t the worst in the nation and your illegal population wasn’t a burden on an overgrown government.
@NuanceBro Pretty fair counterpoint but it’s also a Jewish stereotype. The Benjamin quote is ambiguous in my opinion but she has plenty of other antisemetic quotes. https://t.co/OYlQAjpmV7
@NuanceBro Except in her criticism of AIPAC she brought up a Jewish stereotype! If you criticize the NRA and call bunch of dumb rednecks I’ll critize that person too.
@NuanceBro Honestly I feel like conservatives attack her way too much over this and we definitely should be allowed to critique Israel and Jewish lobbyist but Ilhan has a clear bias against people just because they’re Jewish.
@NuanceBro It’s all about the Benjamins. That’s what she said. I think we can both agree it’s a common stereotype that Jews like money. Therefore that tweet was made antisematically.
@NuanceBro No but it’s pretty obvious she doesn’t have much respect for Jews. One can disagree with policy without playing to Jewish stereotypes.
@nataliesurely I too want to fix the entire planet but won’t even do my part or acknowledge I contribute to the problem

I don’t understand why anyone, except maybe China, thinks they have a chance against the USA. We destroyed Iraq within like two months when they were the 4th most powerful army in the world and on the other side of it.
I think when we win a particularly nasty war we should execute a majority of generals, military engineers, leaders, and traitors, anyone who made it possible for an evil empire to exist, to send the message to other evil empires key personnel to stop.

@platozkv Honestly not big on Palestine because they’re unethical. Yeah it’s wrong but it’s like Socialists invading Nazi’s.
@platozkv Wow Israel is fighting a war against a side that routinely attacks them.
@HistMaterialist You can quit you control yourself. You can demand a higher wage, you can start your own business. They don’t owe you anything and you owe them nothing.
Well I’m officially made up on Israel vs Palestine. I’m for Israeli’s side as I have come to the conclusion the Palestinians operate under an incredibly unethical methodology.
@platozkv No side deserves a home if they intentionally kill kids for propaganda.
@OfficialSPGB @larryelder In Venezuela the state owned the oil company, their largest company. At the time Venezuela was a democracry.

@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Money is just exchanging work, something you need to do to trade efficiently
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino IP laws are designed to reward innovation. They give a temporary monopoly over a product to benefit the creator of the product.
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino What? When the government owns the means of production it makes mistakes. In a capitalist system you are the means of production and you control yourself.
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino The owners put in the initial investment, they get a return. It’s a 100% cooperative and consensual so no problem.
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino You should favor policies of the individual for freedom. People left alone make the best choices for themselves, and they’re not alone they can organize their own groups.
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Yeah and the working class can go build and sell them like they do in a free market. And there’s not exactly a class system you can move through it pretty easy in us
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Yes they do but so does the socialist command economy. Difference is in free market countries you see high rates of success, in mixed or socialist countries you see the opposite
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino What’s wrong with capitalism
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino The individual &gt; community
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Those things are all products genius you don’t get to take them
@AnPrimSocialist You’re pretty stupid for an expert
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino How people produce stuff, work, that’s the means of production.
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Dude your a total idiot. Youdont yjderstahd the legitamante rule of a government and why people formed them in the first place. You also don’t understand socialism, cause no one with good morales would ever advocate for it.

@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino That’s mine don’t argue about semantics
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Socialism is the redistribution of wealth
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Who the people voted for
@AnPrimSocialist @rlmiller10 @OfficialSPGB @dbongino They redistribute wealth
@rlmiller10 @AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino I’m a conservative, believe in free markets, not a socialist
@rlmiller10 @AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Chavez gave out many forms of welfare to poor Venezuelans and subsidized oil.
@AnPrimSocialist @crafty1chris What else are they going to do?

@AnPrimSocialist @crafty1chris What do you mean by election threshold?
@AnPrimSocialist @crafty1chris Technically possible
@BlueNightBird @Weinsteinlaw @rcritelli1 Why would I have my gun over?
@AnPrimSocialist Yes. Hell they going to do about it?
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino That’s one of many types of socialist philosophies. Point is you already own the means of production as an individual and that is pretty fair.
@AnPrimSocialist Yes the right to petition is guaranteed in the constitution.
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino What do you think socialism is?
@lucybell1918 Wow look at these people hurt by capitalism in states that are incredibly anti capitalist. Hmm don’t see this in economically freer states like Texas.
@AnPrimSocialist Who else owns it?
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino You want socialism. I don’t. How exactly are you going to get my money to redistribute without a government?
It’s almost like the second amendment was designed to let us defend ourselves from people like her. https://t.co/CsHfyjA9Ox
@BlueNightBird @Weinsteinlaw @rcritelli1 What if I don’t turn in my gun? What if no one does?
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino In a democracy the voters own the government, everyone was eligible to vote, therefore they owned it.		And how much more free do you get when you get a check to spend on stuff every month?
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Venezuela was a democracy. The Venezuelans voted for these social programs and the state take over of many industries, meaning they owned the means of production. They got these goods through social programs. It’s very close to a socialist utopia.
@pitbulldawg1 @RealJamesWoods Nice. Capitalism at work. Do you remember when the Soviet Union opened a McDonalds
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino If you want a good economy the obvious choice is a free market. I condone authoritarians but some of them run efficient economies. Socialists tend not to.
@crafty1chris @RealJamesWoods True
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Why are you socialist? If you don’t like state you should be more libertarian where people own the means of production.
@platozkv Cause I root for the Israeli’s. They’re way more ethical than the Palestinians, which is saying a lot.
@AnPrimSocialist @OfficialSPGB @dbongino Private companies are better at anticipating and preparing for these things. Notice how places like Saudi Arabia who are still Authoritarian and OPEC didn’t suffer nearly as much.
@platozkv I’ll criticize people who kill people
@nowthisnews They’re naive and she’s bought for by the Chinese.
@OfficialSPGB @dbongino In Venezuela the state owned the oil company that collapsed.

@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Just like food but we don’t socialize that
@Jon012019 @EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders I’ve traveled quite a lot. Places like Italy with incompetent governments overrun by migrants and disastrous social programs made those places look like second world countries. Free places like Switzerland look great.
@DanKxStar @RobertWeinber16 @nowthisnews True but might as well try, or else they’ll spread and ruin life
@EternitysGate26 @Jon012019 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Universal healthcare is a gift someone else was forced to buy.
@EternitysGate26 @Jon012019 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Cause the government has anti competitive practices that keep insurance stagnant
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders No they paid for basic services to protect the economy like police. They mostly left it alone, and it did well
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders No but you have private planes
@Jon012019 @EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Then they can do that. I want freedom. It’s not much to ask for one country to be free.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Some laws are good, like no murder and only American citizens can reap the benefits of the American economy cause they paid for it. Others are bad ideas, like socialism.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders That is definitely false. They were created privately and a lot bought by the military but many people buy or build their own aircraft like Cessna’s.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders I want our own free market, for us. It’s not very free if Mexicans don’t have to obey our laws
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Some regulation is necessary but if you remember government funded airplanes all crashed. They literally couldn’t do it so that invalidated your point
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders And how effective is that government regulation? In authoritarian China you still see people using sewer grease. Your regulations aren’t very effective against smart corporations
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Pretty sure I did. This is America’s economy Mexico can get out. If Mexicans want to take advantage of our economy they should go make their own economy great.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders It really isn’t
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders What is your country? Do they use airplanes, invented by the free market? How bout a phone, invented by the free market? Vaccines? Free market. Cars? You can attribute that to the free market. A fridge use to be a luxury but I guess the free market lowered that cost for you.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders A lot of times you see companies, like a beef provider, self regulating cause they know they’ll go out of business if something happens. Rarely regulation is required and when it is typically its ineffective.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Me either
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders People shouldn’t become single mothers. Marry a guy with life insurance who you trust to raise a kid. Free market will lower costs of everything as it has done.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders So you got people making 7.50/hr working at low skill jobs and hedge fund managers at 1million a salary
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders If they don’t act responsibly no one buys from them and they go bankrupt. That’s why the free market keeps good companies around.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders It’s a service. Someone has to pay for it. I’ll pay for mine you pay for yours. That is fair.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders People get similar jobs at similar pay and similar education.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders There are roles for government, like defending your neighborhood. Your choices aren’t complete authoritarian or complete anarchy.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Not if anyone can make a corporation, but guess what, there’s like a thousand laws making it hard to do that. It’s estimated to cost a billion dollars and 15 years to make a new drug. It’s difficult to disrupt industries the government keeps safe.
@SethAMandel He had 24 detectives working on his case, a gross misuse of government resources. He can cry for help in prison.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Not everyone in Iraq or America has a job, wants to work, has money, makes good decisions, votes, liked their country.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Homogenous in jobs
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Legal immigrants are a net benefit. My town is like 20% illegal immigrant and they don’t get deported I think there is a problem
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders The government is involved in American healthcare with patents and we have three insulin companies. Get rid of government, force them to compete, and you’ll see the price drop.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders I’m not calling America Iraq genius, I’m saying components of it can be similar.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders No I’m just saying there are places it can work, like homogeneous societies full of high wage earning productive people, versus places like America which are flooded with illegal immigrants
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Because Americans deserve freedom. They have the right to defend themselves with guns or choose not to have insurance or who they want to buy insurance from.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders If the free market doesn’t work how come laser eye surgery is so cheap, or rockets, or airplane flights, restaurants, basically anything the government isn’t involved in.
Good that thing was a disaster https://t.co/IwZX08WbVj
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Except those things don’t. They’ve been proven to be destructive. Try asking Iraq to institute a gun ban or universal healthcare. It won’t work there for a lot of the reasons it won’t work here.
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Why would I hate America in trying to protect by building a wall
@EternitysGate26 @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Free market works, 50% tax rate, and a typo doesn’t invalidate my point

@FUNpocolypse @AOC @realDonaldTrump Not really sure how that relates. Trumps policies are for Federal Government. Lowering taxes encourage economic growth. NYC offered local and state tax incentives to lure Amazon to their city. This was to make them competitive against other states.

@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC You can do it on the same plot of land you just build higher. It’s called high density residential, something Seattle has outlawed. The people pay for it by buying the house.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC If they can’t find a job in this city they shouldn’t be living there.  People who want jobs are doing the development work. It’s returned to the community cause now you’ve built a house and paid a guy to do it. Like seriously we need to go to step one for you.
@MicahWright @AOC Well they would’ve built a multi billion dollar facility in NYC they probably wouldn’t want to abandon.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC The landlord sells a house for one. The one family moves out. The landlord builds 5 more houses in its spot. Five families move in. That’s not displacement. It may be temporary but if you do this enough there is always enough places to go.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC If you have a thousand developers in Seattle all building at different times and creating jobs the money is passed down to workers at a fairly steady rate.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Well the bank would sell the house, maybe even at a loss. It’s likely the developer would be able to sell the house though, they typically do and often at a lower price than existing average rent.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Simple economies work the best. Don’t try to plan it, just let people voluntarily interact with each other and allow them to do stuff. They’ll find good solutions.

@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC I wanted the low paying jobs cause there was no high paying jobs. I got the money, moved around, and got better paying jobs. I did this voluntarily. What is wrong with this?
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC People don’t get displaced. They sell their property, or the landlord does. Landlords can do this there is nothing wrong with this. No one owes you a place to rent. They had the blessing of having someplace to rent and now they don’t. Good economies stage this.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Building things requires workers. These workers get paid. They can then spend this money. This is an example of job creation and wealth creation in the form of a new asset, the building. This isn’t disruptive of economies.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Ok so plans are pretty simple. You can get them from a bank if you have something called collateral. If your loan doesn’t get paid back the bank will take your assets you gave as collateral. They can then sell these assets to make up the loss.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC What? Can we just start from like really simple building blocks and work up from there. I feel like you don’t have the prerequisite knowledge to have this information.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC The city of Seattle shouldn’t be paying for housing, just things like roads and police departments. Developers would likely buy existing property, demolish it, and rebuild it taller and more dense. Why would taxpayer money being going to anyone except government workers?
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC I have no problem with people getting awful jobs if that’s what they want. No one is forcing them to live here, or to work here.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC What do you mean taxpayer pay for everything? Like public services? Well remember each taxpayer works for a corporation so the corporations are also paying.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC No one is building homes because no one is letting them. Developers would take loans from banks, build homes, and then sell those homes. The government is not letting them build homes. If you don’t have enough homes rent goes up. It’s basic economics.
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC If they’re voluntary how are they exploitive?

@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Seattle could have cheaper housing if the government didn’t limit the supply by preventing people from building new homes. Anti gentrification people literally protest developers for building more houses to sell under market rate. It’s insane.
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Amazon sells products		People make products		Amazon pays people wages		People spend wages on taxes and other places in Seattle		That’s Amazons investment. They creates jobs and did business. It’s a win win for everybody.
@Just_A__Ghost @jakedgoode @EternitysGate25 @AOC Amazon has many different level income jobs
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Yeah but they need people to build the headquarters, design the robots, clean the building. Point is it would bring in tax revenue and create some jobs locally. Why oppose it?
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Amazon did invest in Seattle. Seattle stopped developers from building homes. That’s why rent is expensive. Anti gentrification people are typically responsible for their problems.
@ImMudabbirAhmed @GingerMahnn @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Or I guess keep taxes high, watch everyone leave, and have no money for these programs at all.
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Coming slowly
@432hzFreq @collisindc @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Well Seattle is full of anti gentrification people who opposed the construction of high density housing. When more people move in you need to build more homes and Seattle stopped that. It wasn’t Amazons fault.
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Do you honestly think Amazon coming to New York City wouldn’t have hired a single worker from New York City?

@GingerMahnn @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC It’s a tax break they aren’t giving anyone money. But yeah NYC could lower taxes across the board if they were smart but they got so much crap to fund they’ll never be able to.
@YaGirlJuniper @Bukon @jakedgoode @EternitysGate25 @AOC He will if he sells his shares. It’s called a capital gains tax. Right now he hasn’t cashed out much, so he doesn’t actually have that much money. If he does then he will pay the taxes.
@tweetissima @jakedgoode @EternitysGate25 @AOC To increase wage growth and job creation.
@LouiseOriole58 @jakedgoode @EternitysGate25 @AOC I’m not really sure how that’s relevant. I think tax code should be simplified but I get tax incentives, I just wish they were more fairly distributed to small business
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC Well if there’s an increase in demand and not an increase in supply the price goes up. Therefore you would’ve seen Amazon offer high wages for construction workers.
@LouiseOriole58 @jakedgoode @EternitysGate25 @AOC That was just an example. Point is NYC is trying to attract Amazon with tax breaks. NYC has many programs in the works, like Medicare for all that depended on this tax revenue they now have lost.
@derek_why @WickedMike10 @EternitysGate25 @jakedgoode @AOC They would’ve had to hire some locals for the many jobs Amazon would offer including things like construction and operations

I kinda like the ideas that companies don’t pay taxes for the first few years of early growth. This encourages disruption.
@tyrisstark They have paid taxes in the past. I think they should continue paying taxes but it’s reasonable to lower taxes across the board for all corporations and people to spur economic growth. NYC just did it to attract companies.
@EternitysGate25 @AOC For the last two years. I don’t think states should subsidize corporations that much but it’s like lowering taxes to attract workers. I would do it across the board though, not just for Amazon.

@IdleOats @peterbayley @jhamby @AOC Get rid of public assistance programs and you’ll see them adapt. Cut low skill immigration they’ll raise prices. Literally just went to a Walmart asking for employees at 12.50. Thid is wage growth.
@IdleOats @peterbayley @jhamby @AOC Why is this a problem? A lot of people like working for Walmart, and Walmart has saved the average household 2k in savings on goods. If you want higher wages from Walmart support policies that decrease low skill supply.
@IdleOats @peterbayley @jhamby @AOC No: that’s a slippery slope. Next thing you know Walmart will be using that law to penalize competitors
@moggledump @silveraa @realDonaldTrump @CNN I’m saying it is one of many solutions and it worked pretty great for the soviets against the nazis. No one liked the Soviet’s but it worked.

@peterbayley @jhamby @AOC True. Like in the health industry they push for things like Obamacare requiring people to buy insurance. I blame politicians for those problems. If they’d stay out of it then we wouldn’t have this problem.
@peterbayley @jhamby @AOC Some big players do collude, for example Lockheed Martin and Boeing colluded to monopolize space launch market with a company called ULA. Know what happened, disrupted by SpaceX. When they do collude they’re no more than a decade from disruption.

@4YrsToday We needed it 3 decades ago
@peterbayley @jhamby @AOC Not really. Free markets don’t require maintenance. If a corporation steps out of line by being greedy the market quickly corrects it. That forces them to pay better wages and lower prices.
@jhamby @AOC The free market is working on it genius. There’s incentive to sell solar, batteries, and evs, and also incentive to improve it
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC It’s a hypothetical situation. The risk pooo can be whatever it wants, but the cost to fix one person multiplied by the percentage of people at risk is your cost for insurance.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC I really think we need to invest less in food. Thing is free markets lower prices so let them
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC How do you think insurance works? 1 in 10 people will break their leg, it costs too much for one individual person, everyone pays in a small fee and the one guy gets covered. If everyone breaks their leg there’s no getting around the high cost everyone must face.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC If it happens to everyone you can’t insure it, you just add overhead cost. Would you insure food? Everyone needs it. Of course we not it just makes everything more expensive.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC Insurance is only feasible when the individual risk is low. Otherwise you have to pay more.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC That is priced correctly. Think of it like this. Food is expensive. You need food to live. You don’t get food insurance, you let the free market lower prices.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC So instead of forcing these companies to lower prices so I’ll actually want to buy insurance you want to force me to buy insurance so they won’t have to lower prices. That’s insane.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC You pay schooo taxes cause you benefit from an educated society. You just buy car insurance cause you can damage other people’s car. That said I think it’s still wrong. The government helped inflate these prices by keeping competition out. I don’t want insurance!
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC Yes. A lot of places don’t allow politicians to promise increases in social programs to buy votes. We aren’t structured to do this. Especially with a two party systems and an uneducated dependency class.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC What’s the worse that’ll happen with free market health insurance? Monopolies will get disrupted, prices will become competitive, we all win.
@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC It doesn’t need work to improve. The only way to improve it is to shrink it. Forcing you to get health insurance, how is that freedom? Leave us alone, we pay for your roads and your wars can’t that be enough.
@SenSanders Why? They chose to work there. I don’t get jobs working at places run by jerks. If you reward this type of behavior you’ll get more of it.
@mattyglesias That’s a ridiculous claim. There has been massive demographic changes and population shifts on a statewide level and the economics of many gas changed.
@AOC Just let the free market do it. Im more confident Elon Musk could solve this problem with the small government loan he paid back issues by Bush then the entire Federal Government. If your “draft” is any indication of your thought process we are screwed.

@lombarteo @SSWorks @AOC Think about this just for a second. Healthcare companies love working with government and price fixing. Single payer advocates will get rid of private insurance and force everyone to pay for it. You’ll have literally no alternative if this doesn’t work.

@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Right we just vote for the people who take bribes. That makes us not responsible at all. Who is your congresswoman and did you vote for her?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Why do you tell me I have no idea? Why can’t I understand these things! I’ve worked jobs, supported people, read. I understand a lot of these systems.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion If the government would get out of the way, I would make insulin, actually. I know how to do it, you need like a fridge, oven, centrifuge, and some other chemicals, but it takes like a week. It can be cheap if you let the market work on it like it has for everything else!
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion You just have a wrong world view. It’s people like you who helped create this system by making it hard to do stuff and taking away the incentive.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion At 45 hours you should be able to produce a weekly cost of house and food though right? When we had more factories we were a lot more productive. A person working at McDonalds isn’t nearly as productive as the factory worker. This is why we need tariffs.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Hey guess what. Insulin is expensive cause the government stops other corporations from making it. People like Elon would love to sell you insulin at low prices but legally can’t. Furthermore it’s your responsibility to take care of yourself just as you do for food.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion What do you mean by a fair job?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion But our system creates incentive to improve efficiency so we can afford everything. For example with AGI, an Elon Investment, we could end the burden of work and illness.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Also during the fifties you had people like Howard Hughes innovating in air travel pushing the market towards better, faster, and safer planes.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion You want the fifties back go get a generation of people who learned the value of hard work by fighting a war. Dependants don’t make good investments.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion No one is stopping you from doing both. Elon is helping fixing our planet and preparing to move to another one. Nothing wrong with that.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Yes but it’s his resources. I’d rather have a system that rewards net good and promotes freedom instead of one where the masses allocate resources, which they tend to never do optimally. Just look at why socialist country.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Sov loop? Are you talking loop, or hyper loop?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Yeah so restrict the government life gets easier
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion It is likely we can not live on this planet forever. Something with happen eventually. Going to other planets gives us a backup planet. It increases the odds of survival of the human race. With nuclear arms proliferation this isn’t a bad idea.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion SpaceX has been a net good. We need satellites to do stuff like internet abd weather. Doing science about our world helps us learn about it. The moon landing for example inspired generations of engineers who solved many problems on earth.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Give me one example of spending resources immaturely
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Except it isn’t. Any time a corporation wants to do something by force they have to get the government to do it.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Admit he’s been a force for good
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion No they’re not. A government can force you to do stuff. A corporation can not.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Elon won’t retire cause of his ego? Maybe it’s cause he has a passion for engineering and problem solving? That seems a lot more consistent with his life from showering at the Y to landing rockets on boats.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion The government of Flint failed to fix the pipes. Not a corporation.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Elon could’ve retired with an island twenty years ago but here he is working harder than us. You’ve made the mistake of thinking cause he’s rich he has what he wants.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Not legally. EPA stops them from doing that, not saving you is not the same as killing you.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Why is being rich a problem?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Money is not directly power. No amount of wealth can make it legal to kill a man. He’s just the guy in charge of the organization making the world better, and if people make the world better shouldn’t we reward that behavior.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion What’s your proposed solution exactly? Confiscate all his wealth, crush his and millions of others dreams, throw it away on an entitlement program that’ll create a dependency class.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion What if everyone in the world voluntarily gave your son money?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Oh no Elon is creating jobs and those people are doing their own things with their money helping others. I wanted to make sure everyone spend their hard earned money on my goals. Damn people having freedom.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion He got this power consentually, people voted for him with their business. Would you also have a problem with a President Bernie Sanders having too much power?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Then do thing B with your own money. It’s our money, we invested in this companies, we can do whatever we want. You don’t get to decide how we spend our money.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion You just have a problem with powerful people. Elon works with in the law. Everything he does people let him. He’s not some raging power hungry king trying to turn the rules in his favor.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion He’s not a king he can’t force you to do whatever. People paid him and now he is buying stuff.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Just out of curiosity can you name one bad thing Elon has ever done?
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion If it really was an economic drag you wouldn’t see Tesla and SpaceX succeeding. Elon knows how to allocate resources and create jobs in a very beneficial way. It’s also his money so he can do whatever he wants with it.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion Ok it’s not like Elon is spending billions. He created companies with initial investments of 180 million. The share price of these companies then rose, and being the biggest investor his net worth with it. In theory he could sell everything for 20 billion.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion It really depends on the specifics. I don’t think this hypothetical is relevant to Elon’s wealth.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion I’ve debunked every point you came up with.  Start from scratch. Tell me why you don’t think he should be so wealthy.
@Amir_Payrovan @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders Reality
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion We have to defend people who do good things from people who want to rob them
@ranavain @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion And it’s his money so he can lay off people. You’re not entitled to his wealth. If these layoffs save the company then they actually save jobs, not cut them.
@ranavain @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion One man created 30k jobs directly and tons more from suppliers. That’s 1 guy. Great ratio. No one has to work for him, but they all do. Jobs at his companies are some of the most sought after in the country. Clearly enough people want to work for him.

@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion No, I was asking if Elon spends his resources best how is that a net negative. Read the tweet above that for some context.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion First off there is an if in that tweet implying it’s a hypothetical, Musk generally breaks even on subsidies. What metric are you even using to calculate how Musk’s spends what little of his free time he has? You don’t get to decide how other people spend their money.
@CascadiaForever @loganmhurley @fmanjoo @nytopinion It’s his resources, he can spend them however he wants, and judging by the amount of people he’s made happy he spends his wealth well.

@awjedwards @ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion First you shouldn’t start a family till you can take care of yourself. Those 80% of Americans have no one to blame but themselves in the vast majority of cases. Medical bills are unfortunate but a free market can fix it so embrace it.

@awjedwards @ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion Dude I’m paying Elon, buying his stuff cause it’s super awesome. I buy merchandise that goes to take us to Mars. Best part I want to do it!

@awjedwards @ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion While a lot of people live off those wages it’s not like he’s forcing people to work for him. It’s his company he gets to run it. Don’t like the wages or leadership go work somewhere else. This is 100% voluntary. Everyone wants to be there!
@awjedwards @ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion So? UAW has destroyed jobs in America, that’s why GM moves its plants to Mexico. 		No one is being forced to work there. If they don’t want to work there cause it’s expensive and they could get laid off they don’t have to. It’s 100% voluntary.

@ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion Society advances faster with Elon. Are you honestly telling me we’d be better without him?
@ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion If Elon didn’t have the ability to influence the world and we relied on the government to fix these problems we’d have idiots voted in not by merit and ability to solve problems but promises to do so. There’s a reason our billionaires are well read competent people.
@ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion Am I though? Would Tesla exist without Elon? Would the taxpayer still be overcharged for rockets made by ULA? Would a generation of engineers be inspired, or would car companies be shifting more to EV’s without him? How about Australia’s electruc grud stabilized by his battery!
@ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion Yes there is. Since Elon has money he can invest in companies like Tesla that build cars, batteries, and solar panels, employ thousands of people, pay taxes, push technology forward, cut carbon emission and stop reliance on foreign fuel. That’s a benefit.
@right4what @nowthisnews Like how the experts predicted Hillary Clinton would win. It’s pretty obvious the affordable care act only benefits low income individuals and is not sustainable.

@ChrisAplin @fmanjoo @nytopinion We can support both groups. Elon has earned most of his assets and money by making things people want, making things that help people. How can anyone not get behind that?

One hard truth is that there is too many Americans in agriculture and it’s over subsidized with illegal labor and government subsidies. We need to let the market correct this before our farmers become a dependency class.

@ACorollaries @SenSanders Well the idea I outlined that is solely for the medical industry is that we would pay the company that developed the drug all the RnD costs for the drug. It’s a system capable of abuse still but I think we can make it better than the existing system.

@ACorollaries @SenSanders A perfectly free market doesn’t have a patent. I feel like for our medical industry what we need is a taxpayer funded patent industry, where no one gets a monopoly on a drug, but they get money. This encourages RnD in new drugs but stops monopolies.
@Truly_NikaRenee @shaunking @ARSimmons You have an example of a felon voting and not getting punished?

@LucyAppa @brianschatz Cool. I’m sure they would’ve completely been destroyed without you.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I live in reality so I think I know it pretty well
@LucyAppa @brianschatz How exactly are you supporting border security
@LucyAppa @brianschatz My bio is a joke that anyone can lie. I wouldn’t expect a leftist to understand humor.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz You don’t have to have a career in something to be an expert. For example you duck at your job, and I do not. I also know about the border cause I research it on my own.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I told you already
@LucyAppa @brianschatz What’s your job even?
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Yes
@LucyAppa @brianschatz That’s kind of the point
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Work at General Electruc Assembling light fixtures in Boulder
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Your work? Making misleading claims kn Twitter, and they’re not baseless I’m giving you sources.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz So the BP insists a wall will make their job more effective, but you claim to conclusion it won’t how?
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Wage growth was 4% last year
@LucyAppa @brianschatz What exactly are you claiming? There’s no manufacturing jobs period, or there was no manufacturing job growth? Cause there’s evidence to contradict both.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Not an insult just an observation. You hear one thing and then repeat it. Something a parrot can do.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz You actually going to read this or continue to make baseless claims?		https://t.co/fZfGDvAeLc		And while their estimate is at 400k I estimate closer to 500k
@LucyAppa @brianschatz *our president and he’s done pretty good with wage growth and manufacturing jobs
@LucyAppa @brianschatz To be honest I don’t think you have any ability to critically think and just repeat talking points you see from your feed.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz It’s based off of evidence and inferences
@LucyAppa @brianschatz https://t.co/KXK2DykUax		I have my own estimate I care to looking at other estimates
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Letting them
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I know but it’s better than gaging then walk across, this way you get time to respond and can hear them.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I estimate you get about 500k illegal border crossing annually. It’s difficult to know since they do it illegally.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Spain has a small part of land across the strait of Gibraltar genius. Don’t think I’m uncultured or bad at geography when you obviously don’t know half what you claim to
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Except ton of people do cross through nature where there is no fence. And it’s a steel slat which is difficult to climb, takes time, and gives time god border patrol to respond.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz First Trumps 5 billion proposal doesn’t even call for desert borders, but even if we did it’d still be fairly effective
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Yes it is. If it takes 5 minutes going slow on a 4 wheeler to patrol a mile, that’s 166 man hours to partol a 2k border wall. Every day that’s 21 people on a shift covering each mile in an 8 hour shift. Want to increase frequency, multiply men by frequency.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Literally no one is saying don’t patrol the wall. Get off this point. Get it through your head I understand this and am not advocating this.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Patrols around walls. Spain has a wall on its border with Morocco. Tunnels take time to build and you need connections to get in. Walls will cut down illegal immigration.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz We can send people to patrol the wall genius. Just cause it’s s desert doesn’t mean people can’t go there. By that logic no one would cross through the desert but they do.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Because Donald Trump in NYC and Florida employee illegals it’s pretty obvious he understands how they undermine American wages and take jobs. Trump would’ve been forced to pay more but because of our leniency he didn’t. Cut work visas and illegao immigration.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I’m not saying only a border wall, I’m saying it’s a necessary component. How else do we stop people?
@LucyAppa @brianschatz No, a 4 wheeler can not move through a steel slat wall. A beefy truck couldn’t even do it. A BP agent patrols the wall on a 4 wheeler.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Look at Israel or Spanish border walks. They’re pretty effective and way more modern.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Then hire workers at fair wages. Raise wages. If people really want that much food it’ll be profitable. If not then we have too much food production, which is definitely true.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Why is it worthless and idiotic? Even at 0% deterance it’s still a jobs program.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I live in a very Latino part of Colorado and yes
@LucyAppa @brianschatz No it doesn’t! Business farmers are overly dependent and need to raise wages and costs. Food prices are artificially low.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz We literally invaded a massive desert across the world fairly easy. It’s not that hard.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Why not? All you have to do is drive a 4 wheeler around it.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz What tests? Give me examples of failed border walls.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz It’s a component to a solution, and a pretty important one. No one is advocating for solely a wall, Trumps request even included specifics for more judges and humanitarian aid in addition to increasing BP budget
@LucyAppa @brianschatz What tests are you referring to. I have seen way more positive results from countries that take border security seriously.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz We have a labor shortage in skilled labor. Low skill is plentiful you just have a large amount of people not working because pay is so low it’s not even worth it if you look at social benefits gained from things like welfare.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz No one is saying no patrols. The wall means you need less patrols because it takes time to breach a wall. It’s a tool that increases efficiency!
@LucyAppa @brianschatz And these tests came back overwhelmingly positive! What is he suppose to do if the other side won’t even listen to him!
@LucyAppa @brianschatz This isn’t punishing workers this is shrinking the labor pool to decrease supply on labor market to increase wages. Look at how well agriculture workers do in a place like Switzerland with no illegal competition.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Why? What else you going to do, send soldiers to patrol the border.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz It’s a component of a solution and he tried but our congress for some  crazy reason will not look into a physical barrier at all. They don’t even say maybe let’s try a small scale test.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Except we don’t. We need farmers to pay higher wages. Food prices are artificially low.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz He did that to try and get investment for border defense! That’s like getting mad at some guy for shutting down the factory for a day to install more machinery.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Illegals are the reason wages for low skill workers stayed stagnant and why California’s have to pay higher taxes. Illegals are a net negative on America.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Maybe we should give Trump the resources for defending the border
@LucyAppa @brianschatz Ok. I still support using them to secure the southern border. Getting real sick of paying taxes for illegals.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz I’m willing to bet our military even unarmed is far more competent than these guys

@BodenElgen @I_am_Niteangel @TheRightMelissa @PrisonPlanet It’s a difficult thing to understand but the basic consensus is the same, the climate is warming and will continue to warm for some time
@BodenElgen @I_am_Niteangel @TheRightMelissa @PrisonPlanet We have a pretty good understanding. We can understand it’s composition and thermal properties. It’s not unreasonable to assume we can’t model it, and some models have worked pretty well.
@BodenElgen @I_am_Niteangel @TheRightMelissa @PrisonPlanet Yes but now we are increasing the rate of heating. I’m not saying rapid heating is bad. Personally I’m fit a warmer globe.
@I_am_Niteangel @BodenElgen @TheRightMelissa @PrisonPlanet I think it’s fair to notice we are artificially increasing the rate of heating. The heating is occurring faster than even that cycle graph shows.
@CentralFLTed @realDonaldTrump That isn’t an overreaction
@BodenElgen @TheRightMelissa @PrisonPlanet Ok. I think the earth has natural processes that will offset climate change. My point is that it’s happening, and hopefully Africa will be able to industrialize sustainably with market rate solar, electric vehicles, and batteries.

@RedEspressoIced @NightsWatchIt @DanRiffle I don’t think it’s unreasonable for a person to have 2k saved up at all times for things like emergencies or starting a new job and you can’t afford first months stuff. That’s what, 1 month of work at 40hrs/week at 12.50.
@NightsWatchIt @RedEspressoIced @DanRiffle It’s not luck. Best job I’ve ever had full time entry level was at $13. However if you stay with a company for long enough and work hard you can usually get a promotion in a year at most to something like $15 to $20.

@_Floodlight @DanRiffle What do you think a share is. It gives you ownership of a company, to vote on how it works. That’s fair. I start a company, I decide how it’s runs, other people can come work for me consentually if they want knowing I’m in charge.
@_Floodlight @DanRiffle The worker class shrinks as technology advances and production gets more efficient
@_Floodlight @DanRiffle Not really. Think of it like this.		You build a tool and give it to a guy.	(This is initial funding”		The person builds ten cars and gives you one for building the tool.	(Dividend)		You build enough tools you retire, having created jobs.
@goldlarche @DanRiffle Who do you think these owners are? They’re mutual trust funds represented by half of America! Half of America has some skin in the stock market, it’s not just “capitalists”
@_Floodlight @DanRiffle Yes you do. We live in an age of abundance and you can always start your own company
@goldlarche @DanRiffle Do you know what a security is? A dividend?
@_Floodlight @DanRiffle How is it stealing if the people agree to work there?
@goldlarche @DanRiffle I don’t think you understand how they get wealthy. Billionaires create companies which are valued by others. They don’t have a billion dollars, they created a company they can sell part of for a billion dollars.
Woot 14kills
@_woIfgang @DanRiffle Well some people don’t even work so billinaoaires work infinitely harder than them. It’s not about work ethic it’s about creating value.

@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle There’s the government dying our lives again. Open it up for competition!
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Well if you live in the Northeast or Southern California I would expect to find a good paying entry level job. Move to Texas.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Cause you’re threatening to break in genius
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle I suddenly realize why you suck
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Real world? Bet I’ve lived and worked more than you? What are you a 20 something guy who is getting a useless degree and works a dead end job living with his parents still?
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle AT&amp;T does both, and regardless even if they didn’t they could come in any do either or.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Yeah the issue with your mom was pretty hot
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle If that was true no one would pay anything above minimum wage but they all do!
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle I don’t work for you. I owe you nothing. Come into my house get shot. Difference is Fords employees got pay bonuses for being in line with company policy, basically pay for being good.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle You’re just mad cause you said something stupid. Thinking I’m illiterate when I literally read everything you said.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle They can. There are many cellular networks in my city.
@horriblemarket @josephripken @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle What type of argument is that. Everyone can read, it’s more important what you read.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle That’s a condition for working there. You can work other places.
@horriblemarket @josephripken @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Yeah and in a lot of industries it raises wages. It’s basic economics, low supply high demand means price is high. So low supply of workers means they get high wages. Therefore cut down illegal immigration get better paying jobs.
It’s things like this that keep jones expensive https://t.co/33hiiOsBKC
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle You’re right my illiterate self has no ideas what you guys are saying I’m just blindly replying
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle No it’s not because you’re seeing competition from places like SpaceX, creating new technology to bring broadband internet at a cheaper price to areas with monopolies. We had a new company install in my hometown and it forced Comcast to lower prices!
@horriblemarket @josephripken @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle What, did Ford, not create well paying jobs with days off in order to attract workers? Free market can make goods cheap and wages high given good circumstances.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Quality of life began to dramatically improve, especially in the 1920s when the infrastructure was all built with all the new oil and cars and railroads. Might’ve been hell during the time but life got better, because of these guys.

@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle You talking bout when Ford creates the five day work week and raised wages after Roosevelt’s antitrust laws backfired? Or how the robber barons built the most prosperous country on earth?

@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Well maybe President Trump, you know, who actually got elected and does the job.
@josephripken @horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Laws only held up by the government. We know corporations can be amoral but when we give them a free market it forces them to compete and be nice
@RedEspressoIced @DanRiffle Below minimum wage as a waiter, you get tips but yeah I’ve worked right on the line throughout most of highschool. Worked about 40 hours a week through most of highschooo and sixty in the summers. I know the people who work min wage, they only have themselves to blame.

@horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle I specifically said moral to their customers, and generally in a healthy free market companies also compete for workers, treating them well.
@horriblemarket @cuddlesandkafka @DanRiffle Comcast has regional monopolies and even still low orbit broadband networks are in development in an attempt to circumvent this. A monopoly upheld by the government is not the free market.

@joebarnard I mean we basically need to put two to three good sounding rockets on top of each other and give them some basic guidance.
@joebarnard It’s have to be volunteer. You might have to work a second job and do this as a hobby
@joebarnard You’d have to build this yourself with volunteers. Maybe recruit some Boy Scouts, model rocket enthusiasts, retired engineers etc. no cost on personnel.
@joebarnard If we’re going as cheap as possible we’re building it in a field some place in south Texas. The closer to the equator the less DeltaV we need. Still want to be in US for shipping prices. There wouldn’t be much of a launchpad, just a beam we’d tow up into place.

@People4Bernie There is a lot of unions. Some help employees, other ruin companies and organizations. The president should support the rights of workers to form unions, but they shouldn’t be pro every union
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Someone’s unhappy with their paycheck. It’s really simple. Work for a bad company get bad life. Good company good life. So increase the options of places to work and go find a nice place to work.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists So the obvious solution is to increase demand for workers. In high skill jobs there’s not a lot of workers so they have to pay very well. They’re treated well. Cut down in illegal immigration and increase domestic production wages wiii rise.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Yeah I think people should be paid fairly. If they don’t think they’re getting paid fairly they leave right
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists If no one wants to do the job then the employee will have to pay more to attract workers

@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Except I did build the screwdriver. I worked and saved money and night shares in a company. Most shareholders are ordinary people, mostly middle and upper class. I’ve seen excons working fast food and being homeless get up to middle class so it’s possible.

@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Let me explain it simply:		I build a screwdriver		I give a guy the screwdriver		He makes 100 cars and gives me 4 for the screwdriver 		The cars are my profit, the screwdriver is investment. That’s a simple way of explaining it.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists What do you do at these places
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Then move. A 1.5 million dollar house in LA is 400k in Texas, which also no income tax, and they do pretty alright for low skill labor. America is big, it’s not too expensive to move, you can get roommates or a wife or something. There are plenty of options.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Then you don’t understand my point. Go reread it.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Most of them produce initial capital and then continuously reinvest it creating more jobs. A lot of these rich capitalists are just old dudes in retirement getting money for making investments with their own money
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Where do you work?
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Yeah cause I work in the factory building industrial light fixtures
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Then don’t work at that company, go somewhere you can move up, live frugally, get a degree in something useful, and then live well
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Where’d you get that form? I’m saying take responsibility for your actions.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Compensation should reward product. If you produce more you should be able to get more, and that’s generally true.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists If I build a farm bot that can harvest a thousand burgers in the time it takes a McDonald’s employee to cook one who’s more productive? Fundamentally no one will hire an employee who costs more than they produce.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Some of these people are working at companies at low wages for twenty years and not even making it up to manager. It’s so irresponsible.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Getting pregnant at 17, yeah their fault, don’t have sex if you can’t raise a kid. Living somewhere expensive their fault. You’re never more than a 100 mile drive or bus ticket from a low rent area. Choosing a useless degree, their fault.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Cause you have to produce things, you don’t get then for free. If you’re only working 35 hours at McDonalds you’re nowhere near as productive as factory worker at union rate. If you’re not producing a lot you don’t get a lot.

These people scraping by suck. I easily lived off of low skill labor. Like get a roommate, live somewhere, eat a lot of rice.
@ruzihm @MCSerf @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Yeah I’m against more corporate subsidies and welfare, people are right to be mad about that
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Wages are going up though. Everyone got a break everyone will have to pay for. And you know who isn’t paying their fair share? Welfare recipients who make so little they pay hardly any taxes at all.

@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Except wages are going up, and he cut taxes for everyone. The problem is spending. If our government was smaller we could afford this. If wet cut spending and illegal immigration and have fair trade wages will continue going up.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Thanks to Donald Trump we’re having wage growth for the first time in a while. His domestic manufacturing policies is creating jobs, causing competition between companies for workers, raising wages.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists I made like a 100 in tips plus another 130 for manager pat. I made like a thousand a week. I was paid pretty fairly. See if someone underpays their workers and there’s not enough workers, they’ll leave for where pay is highest. That’s why we should stop illegal immigration
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists They got the money working jobs. For example I worked at IHOP. I would then buy shares of companies in the expectation other people would value those shares more at a later date. I got the money from customers, they got from doing their own jobs.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists No. 50% of America is in the stock market. They go and work at a job and buy some shares as a retirement plan. The idea is after they’ve built machines and kept the economy running new people use the machines and pay them in dividends.
Hawt https://t.co/18NoLFnTqJ
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists No they provide initial capital, something they typically earn. People need money to start a company so they typically sell shares of the company in return for money. Then later they pay back the money in the form of a dividend, with interest.
@4YrsToday For all of you who said no go sneak into the Whitehouse I’ll pay you 1g
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists They’re not parasitic they’re providing capital investment. A lot of these greedy capitalists are ordinary people who want payoff from autonomous machines
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists That’s the natural state of life. If you want food go farm it, or make something else and exchange those services with a farmer.
@Vittoria75H2O @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Globally GM does ok for now but they’re getting outcompeted in the US. That’s why they’re going to trucks and SUV’s. Point is the people who own the company get to decide what they want to do and if the workers are unhappy they can find a better job, like at Tesla.
@MCSerf @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists Didn’t realize you were a slave. No one is forcing you to do anything but follow laws and pay taxes. If you don’t want a job you don’t have to get one. No is forcing you to do anything.
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib This is 100% voluntary. If the employees want to own part of the company they can buy shares or go join a company that pays them in shares. It’s incredibly fair. The only thing that isn’t is where you start, but I’ve seen many Excons work through it.
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib It’s really simple. GM says hey you work for 15 an hour and produce 30. We use the remainder to build more factories or pay those who were willing to invest their money cause if no one did we’d never have money loaned to us. Don’t like it get another job.
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib They don’t get that capital, they never bought a share. You don’t get paid twice. Y’all would like employee owned companies. They can use the capital they gain in a consensual work agreement to buy shares.
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib GM is a massive company of course it’s going to take a while for an individual to save up money to buy controlling interest. Why would you even want to buy GM?
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib If they can’t get a loan it’s probably not an investment the bank thinks will workout. Regardless you can usually take out loans to start a business. People do it all the time. And if you can’t get a loan from one bank there’s many other ways to get money, like working.
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Where do you think these guys get their capital from?
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Why would they do that they want to make money: if you got the money you can can buy anything that gets built
@don_quixbrote @ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib No, but you can buy that stuff. You can try to make it yourself. Our hyper efficient economy makes that unnecessary. People build machines like any other product. Don’t steal tools, you can earn them easily.,
@detroitdsa @ruzihm @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib What do you mean
@detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Which was wrong, I agree, no one should be using eminent domain for anything isn’t directly related to national security. Just as they shouldn’t get to take your land you shouldn’t be able to take there’s.
@ruzihm @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib You are the means of production already. You consentually agree to work in exchange for money. Too low money, not enough benefits, bad job, you go find a different one.
@day_twa_tone @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib You take away financial incentive to innovate you lose things like job creation, you make it harder for Tesla’s to form, and often new companies are better. Also this is entirely consensual. The shareholders agree to pay the workers, they agree to take the job.
@day_twa_tone @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib The shareholders of GM want profits which they’re entitled to, even if it dooms the company. It no longer is competitive, and will likely die. However the now rich shareholders can go invest in new companies like Tesla, who create jobs, repeating the business cycle.
@day_twa_tone @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib GM raises money for things like the Volt and Bolt, creating jobs building them. If shareholders don’t get paid they have no reason to invest, and a lot of these stock portfolios are retirement plans.
@day_twa_tone @detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Let me explain how companies work. People like you work hard and buy shares in a company like Vanguard. Vanguard invests your money in a startup, like GM once was. This creates jobs. Then the employees are paid and shareholders get profit.
@detroitdsa @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib Ok first off they’re property of the company, that’s how our legal system works. If you want to own part of a company buy a share in it. Second GM is in the late stages of its life. It’s paying out profits to the people who risked their money to create the jobs.

@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Not necessarily. We'll probably actually use less space with agricultural bots that cut wasted crop down to less than 1%. With GMO's it gets even better. The world population is also expected to peak at 10 billion, so we're looking pretty good.

@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Depends on the material. Aluminum for example is mined from ore, super heated, forked into a massive ingot, and then steamrolled. You can do all of this 100% sustainably with very minimum CO2 production. Refining uranium is even easier, just takes longer.

@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Further down the supply chain with towing around a bunch of materials you can use oil based vehicles and equipment, but that’s not a requirement, and you have to build this technology somehow. It’s ok to make co2, just at a reasonable pace.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC No they don’t. Solar panels use materials like Silicon. Nuclear reactors use uranium and plutonium.
@4YrsToday Idk but either they all are or none of them are
@nowthisnews Who would use Elon Musk's money better? Him to build a sustainable electric grid, or a government to waste half of it on bureaucrats
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Solar panels and nuclear reactors are definitely net productive.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC What do you think will happen in 12 years? Runaway venusification. I wouldn't worry about oil as EV's and sustainable energy takes over the market. The major countries that need water, India and China, have major coastlines and desalination technology.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Energy for labor is easy to get, agriculture is safe, it's probably just going to move North. It's also getting very cheap to desalinate water. It's not an imminent disaster, just something to adapt to.
@Tommy_Fierova @CBSNews The government just takes out loans to finance it, or inflates our currency. The 2008 financial crisis happened because the housing market collapsed because of subprime lending. This meant banks had no money to lend out, meaning there customers would be broke.
@Tommy_Fierova @CBSNews Explain to me how tax cuts caused the 2008 financial crisis.
@Tommy_Fierova @CBSNews The stock market crashed because the housing market crashed. Basically real estate and banks failed, and banks are central, so the tough economic climate meant the success of profit was lower across the board, leading to stocks losing value.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC We've got nuclear energy, fission and fusion, and the production price of solar panels is the same as drywall per square foot. Battery prices have dropped 80% in a decade. The energy crisis is in the process of being solved. The environmental impact is manageable.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC The environment crisis is overblown. Our population expansion is slowing, material resources for earth are essentially infinite, just not easily available. You don't need magic you need engineering. A CO2 scrubber isn't actually that hard.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC I understand it well I've done a lot of research in this. Climate change really just affects other areas more. Rapid change is dangerous but this may ultimately be beneficial for the US.
@RealJamesWoods Just saw you in Contact

Why do 40 million Americans need food stamps. That's liked 13% of the population. How do 1 in 10 people fail to get able to buy food.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Climate change threat is overblown. First it's over a long period of time, which people almost always adapt to. Second, Earth has natural processes to offset this. Third, the private market is making great strides in solving energy sustainability.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Look at the details of those claims. For example the claim public employees make 120k/year is actually true, factored in with benefits. It should be labeled misleading, not false. A lot of his claims are like that.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC I get it, and I do. Honestly I'll be more lenient with politicians who have good ideas 90% of the time, not always giving them a pass but letting it go.
@CristobalJAlex @AOC @politico You can’t stop whites, whites stops you. Sounds kinda racist.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Being overly skeptical of climate change when your chief executor is different than not understanding the absolute basics of your own legislative body. AOC’s comment is dumber.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC What has Rand Paul said. Definitely not anything as dumb as AOC.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC It’s not relevant because we’re talking about AOC. I do agree that is a stupid comment, but at least he understands how many branches of government there are. AOC didn’t understand that, nor does she understand economics or climate change.
@SenSanders Maybe those 30 million uninsured would rather take their chances then pay for anything. I know I do. Guns violence is existent mostly in heavily gun controlled areas. Climate change isn’t really that big of a threat.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC I care more about basic competency. Justin Amash is pretty good. Rand Paul pretty accurate.
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC That’s super relevant to this post
@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC Completely agree, but this wasn’t just a mistake, she failed to correctly identify the branches of government twice. Not even Trump has said something this stupid.

@Auchstvell @Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC That was her correction after she talked about the 3 branches of government. If she messes up her correction on a basic piece of trivia half of the 3rd grade population knows I doubt her ability to govern.
@Kuurion @CJR @cenkuygur @AOC In a livestream she mentioned the three branches of government, the house the senate, and the presidency. Those are not the three branches of government. She once said the military got a 700 billion dollar increase. It was more like 60 billion. Plenty more.

@Tommy_Fierova @CBSNews Are you talking about the 2008 housing market crash. That happened because people realized they had a whole bunch of housing loans no one could pay back.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol I don't why I have to keep clarifying this. I'm against crony capitalism. I'm for free market capitalism.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol That's where President Trumps Tariffs come in. Tariffs make it unattractive for companies to move out of US. Corporations that have to do mass firings typically aren't operating well and tend to go out of business, making room for better corporations.
Just watch a American citizen of Mexican nationality who couldn't even speak English testify against illegal immigration. Things are getting pretty in Los Ángeles. 		https://t.co/UTHRHoXobS
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol A lot of corporations have reason to keep environment clean and sustainable. For example logging companies planet trees so they can harvest them in the future. Not all do, and there needs to be reasonable regulation, but we're in a pretty good spot in USA.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol The average engineer has a starting salary at $60k/year. Why do you think it is so high? That pretty expensive. According to you a corporation would cut his salary to make things cheaper. Why don't they do that?
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Laser eye surgery. Market is free, price has been going down. Plastic surgery. Free market no insurance. Price has been going down. Fast food. Free market, prices going down. Almost everything in the free market gets better.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Gaining from crony capitalism? Politicians, corporations, their shareholders and employees.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol I know it isn't free that's kinda my point. Once you make it free stuff gets better.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol I know what crony capitalism is. I'm against it. I just want free market.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol I'm all against money in politics, but the free market still works.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Money is spread out in a lot of places. Billionaires don't actually have cash, they own assets that got created that they can sell for cash. Even if they did have cash it would still be invested. A lot of debt money was spent on military and social programs
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Yes that is an example of crony capitalism. Government alone is ineffective. Government and corporations are abuse of power. Corporations alone are forced to compete for customers.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol So if you keep the government out of things there's no chance for corruption.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol No. First FedEx isn't really a government contractor. You can always not buy a service from FedEx. If billionaires get too greedy and raise prices everyone will go to UPS. That's why business keep prices low. It's very fair.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Privatization almost always saves money. Yes some corporations are bad but you can always fire them. Look at the case if SpaceX for example, a private government contractor that replaced a crony contractor.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol That's not free market that's crony capitalism
@TECleveland @nytimes There's a lot of overlap but I'm pretty confident that maybe except for some ecological science, any science we need to have done will be done by the private market and the government shouldn't be picking research projects.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol With the Government you get the post office, which isn't even profitable. Private you get FedEx, which by comparison does an amazing job. Private sector always beats out government.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Who are these people? Do you mean people eating unhealthy food, like fast food? You can get great quality food for cheap anywhere in the US. Lower income people tend to buy more unhealthy food but there's definitely cheap healthy options like rice and fish.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Yes let's get congress out of healthcare and let the free market go to work
RT @elonmusk: It needed to be made real https://t.co/9Y490tukao
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Then if the rich chicken company wants to make more money they'll invest in a mass produced quality chicken machine in lower the price. It's like how computers and cars use to be luxury items but now everyone can afford them.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol You need basic regulation but not nearly what we got in the healthcare industry. Laser eye surgery, not covered by insurance, low regulations, gets cheaper and better every year.  Everywhere the government isn't things get better.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol If the chicken makes you sick don't buy a chicken from that farm. This is a really simple concept.
@AJEnglish Why couldn't Thailand take her?
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol I don't think you understand. Cut down on the governments ability to influence corporation success. If congress is ineffective, then you can get true competition. Something like singlepayer would just encourage getting even closer to congress.
@AtheistRepublic Anyone know the context
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Well if they do the wrong thing I'd fire them. It's really simple. I'm not saying get rid of all regulations, just make it easier for competition to get started.
@AOC If we're going to bring race into this fine. Your world was built white men. It's been through history almost exclusively white men who gave you everything you want, whether it be democracy or social media. Stop with indenture politics it's unethical and kinda racist.
@TECleveland @nytimes No we can totally cut research. There is incentive for mega corporations to have serious RnD departments. Monsanto spends a lot, GM spent like 30 billion, Tesla and SpaceX and Apple do a ton.
@dearsusanbranch @SenSanders @BizHealthPol Yes. We need to cut down massively on regulations so competition can come in
@Tommy_Fierova @CBSNews Well i, a low income person, all paying less in taxes and seeing wage growth in the manufacturing sector so it's working for me.

@keithellison What are the current barriers to making an insulin company.
Maybe currency should only be produced when a new baby is born or an existing unit has been destroyed.
If you get a job in the private sector there is always the chance of the company going under and unemployment. I don't think it's absurd that government employees knowing how they're paid may have delayed pay. If I love with risk of unemployment you can with delayed pay.

@DKinMN @ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Can you even tell me or did you just hear economist say it’s a good idea. I’ll give you a min to google an article supporting your side.
@DKinMN @ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Oh damn my brain lapses and I made a minor grammar mistake. Now my entire point is ruined. Foiled again.
@DKinMN @ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Then their idiots. The minority of people predicted 2008 financial crisis and history is loaded with the "experts" making mistakes. Tell me why I'm wrong and I'll try to refute it. That's how you solve problems.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC Depends on some factors, mostly how much they cost society. They need to pay for their workers public education, the police for protecting them, roads for servicing them. Depends on the company but I say a base fee of 100mil to start.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC They can't expand their companies or create jobs. Look at Elon Musk. Dude lives a nice life but he's also created like 30k jobs directly and is still going. Tax him too much you slow down all this great progress.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC Yes, and let’s not get carried away with it. Generally monopolies are bad, and the government essentially is a monopoly. The more it buys the less the individual can.
@DineshDSouza Any smart CEO that sells in America would manufacture in America
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC How bout we just make people pay for schools, police, a modest military, and some courts. Then we let people solve their own problems. Simple enough.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC I understand how they’re taxed, I’m advocating let’s tax them less so people can have more money and do more things like start companies and retire early.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC It’s double tax. The company pays a tax, the workers pay a tax, the consumer pays a tax, and now the shareholder has to pay a tax. When does it end?
@CNNTonight @donlemon Chill
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan The business pays the taxes, and then if they have money in the budget they can do things like pay out dividends, or invest in RnD or expansion.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan Taxes are already paid for by companies why would shareholders then have to pay more taxes? It's double tax.
@Concordantly @IlhanMN There is a limit though, and we shouldn’t get carried away.

@StephenKing It takes two people to disagree
@ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Dude it's pretty simple. There's not enough money to finance these programs. If we don't control spending we'll either rapidly lose services or inflate to the point where money is worthless. Either way it's going to be brutal.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan Startups don't usually pay dividends cause that's an end goal. First all money goes to development and Rnd to beat out big competitors and create jobs. Then you pay out dividends. If you don't then no one will invest in any startup, and monopolies stay in power.
@ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Well you'd have to cut spending across the board. Military shouldn't definitely go. Social security, Medicaid and Medicare together make up the majority of the US budget. They too will need to be cut.
@miasmo_ @Malevolent_USB @IlhanMN Yes defense contractors would be a part of this class in addition to low income people. Wall Street is just a scapegoat. Investors are mostly upper middle class Americans saving for retirement.

@sabrina68 Woah politicians betrayed you color me surprised. I think it’s pretty obvious what will happen. Progressive will be upset at Dems when they’re ideas aren’t implemented and will lose interest in voting. Trump will keep promises. He’ll get re-elected.
@d_carteret @BartB75231815 @IlhanMN @RepJayapal Any rational person with interest in the future of the US would want to prevent debt from getting out of control. If we don’t know it’s an economic collapse later.
@ThomasICarrier @IlhanMN Paygo is probably in all Americans eventual interest. You either lose some welfare now, or economic collapse later.
@AltLoading @IlhanMN @RepJayapal Yep. Need to cut spending or borrow entirely from foreign markets and never pay them back.
@sabrina68 If liberals lose house in 2020, they’ll most likely lose senate, and they’ll almost certainly definitely lose the presidency, then it’s just going to be another republican majority term, which means no social programs at all.
@Malevolent_USB @IlhanMN If we don’t control this spending we’re just building a dependency class that’s larger and larger until an eventual economic crash takes away all of their income, or dilutes it so much it’s worthless.
@TheMad_Cracker1 @royarellano @sabrina68 @IlhanMN Well the republican lead senate and White House and some other things made that unrealistic. This is just the icing on the cake. Personally the progressive agenda sounds too bold and ignorant.
@sabrina68 @royarellano @IlhanMN I told all of them progressive. Either the progressive candidates would compromise or get nothing done. Y’all are fools for voting for their policies, but even bigger fools for thinking they’d do anything except be loud and hurt Dems re-election chances.
@vb_joker @AltLoading @IlhanMN @RepJayapal What makes you think we’re heading into a recession
@AltLoading @IlhanMN @RepJayapal Paygo means the government needs to have funds available not borrowed. It’ll probably mean more taxes but less debt, cause the government can’t control spending for its life.
@monkeypawwishes @IlhanMN Maybe some os us want more money so we can save it and start our business and think the government is squandering it.
@commentoniowa @IlhanMN @SpeakerRyan Dividends and capital gains are the incentive to invest in startups to disrupt monopolies.

@CallingShoRai @dvppyConqveror Yeah islands have unfortunate economic conditions, with their only real hope being big tourism industries as they're unattractive to factories. What Puerto Rico does need is to be able to import goods from foreign ships.
@AOC Anyone want to tell me how he's dividing us. You not agreeing with his policy is not division, it's disagreement.
@CallingShoRai @dvppyConqveror @Ocasio2018 Most Puerto Ricans aren't required and definitely do not voluntarily pay federal income tax.
@KirkHaggerty @Ocasio2018 I'm not Republican or Christian. I just hate people wasting my tax money, that I see very little return on. While democrats do spend more republicans can also ruin their states and cities easily with debt.

I don't really consider illegal immigrant that big of a deal out of California, nothing to demonized a group of people.		That said this illegal immigrant was twice arrested and not deported. Regardless of your stance on illegals we can agree we should deport criminals. https://t.co/FNuEvzooSE

@StacyLRivera @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Never said they were, just using it as an example.
@CallingShoRai @dvppyConqveror @Ocasio2018 They start paying Federal personal income tax they could start getting more federal services. Point still stands.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump There's a lot of people in US not just government  employees. A lot of us feel like we're paying for services we don't need. It's hard to feel bad for people like postal workers when FedEx does it better. Shrink the government.
@CallingShoRai @dvppyConqveror @Ocasio2018 Its not. Saying someone should vote in the Federal Government is not the same as getting a check from the Federal Government cause they wasted their own money.
@IlhanMN 131,000,000,000 is how much illegal immigrants cost state and local governments annually. That's net. See I can throw around numbers too without attacking the actual problems with your argument.

@creativelytired And for your math you just threw out entire lines cause you didn’t bother to look for the methodology. At least take a low estimate.
@creativelytired Oh but they pay taxes. Not nearly enough. To start most of them are in low income brackets. They make so little they hardly pay anything in income taxes. They only pay sales tax, some payroll, and indirect property tax.
@creativelytired You definitely messed up in your math. Low estimate of 10 million kids at average cost to educate of 11k a year is 110 billion alone.
@creativelytired How many illegals are in the US? Maybe 10 million, I personally estimate it’s higher. How many kids do they have? Maybe 1 each. Not unreasonable, got to drop the anchor. That’s 10 million kids, although it’s probably higher, getting educations we paid for.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris No!!! That’s not how it works at all. It’s not exploitation. Get the government out. People need healthcare. Companies want to be able to provide it. They’ll undersell each other. It’s a great system. You just had a dramatic experience caused partly by the government.
@creativelytired For title I C they specifically estimate 55% percent are children of illegals, and factor into costs. They didn’t take the whole migrant children population.
@creativelytired Are you reading the Full Report at the top of page, because it explains the methodology in the Introduction
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris And we kind of do have a immigration problem.		https://t.co/nmdFU3qdLH		People can compete with large corporations. Look at Tesla, Whole Foods, Amazon, Apple. All these companies were founded by individuals who started from nothing.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris Ford is a great example of the free market at work. Cars use to a luxury item. Now everyone has one. You can get a use car for under 2k. Do the same thing with healthcare.
@creativelytired Personally I want relocation of overseas military personnel. It could actually save money for the US military with having a local supply chain, stimulate some local border economies.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris Tell me why it’s inherently wrong to privatize. Think about it. Two companies. They want your business, they’ll fight each other for it, get cheaper. If you protect the free market from monopolies it works great. Look at how cheap everything else is.
@creativelytired I was talking about state and federal. 		https://t.co/nmdFU3qdLH
@creativelytired Dude it could be forty billion and still save 10 billion if it was 50% effective
@creativelytired We could militarize ours. The costs aren’t really that big. Five billion for construction. Knowing the government that’s ten billion. Versus like a 100 billion in costs annually. Even if we had to build it every year if it cut illegal immigration in half that’d save us a ton.
@creativelytired We also don’t know dinosaurs look like but we got fossils and some pretty good ideas. You can use deduction to figure out stuff, and some illegals even take part in the census.
@creativelytired A lot of people just suck at living, and unfortunately they bring that down to their kids. You’re finding single moms with three kids who work as maids. They made dumb choices. Maybe we should do something about the kids, but screw the mom.
@creativelytired The Mongols were an organized army that far outpaced the Chinese. If you want to look at history there’s some pretty effective walls in Israel.
@creativelytired We can measure the benefit of the wall by the rate of illegal immigration. While that can be difficult to measure we’ve been doing good so far, and since we know the costs of an average illegal immigrant we can extrapolate from there savings.
@creativelytired Or the welfare money could’ve been spent by someone like me, also putting it back in the economy. The difference is I earned that dollar. I know how low income people live, where they work, they do not need our money to survive.
@creativelytired That’s not a bad idea. Even though a wall would help everyone and should be taxpayer funded. We should do the same thing with welfare. If you want to help people, use your own money, cause welfare doesn’t help everybody.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris No. You’re thinking of insurance. For most types of healthcare it really shouldn’t be insurance based. Insurance is meant for unlikely things. Our current system is using insurance to pay for everything. That’s insane. You don’t have insurance for food.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris If you want to go to a country where they actually do where people do put massive amounts of resources into their government there is Europe, but the good countries are pretty selective about who comes in. They understand mass immigration doesn’t work well with welfare states.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris See that’s what I’m talking about. It’s just a question of when a government becomes corrupt. This is why we need to be decentralized and restrict their power. The government is heavily involved in healthcare, but when it’s not prices are cheap, service is better.

@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris I will concede there may be a role for the government for people with serious disabilities, no families to support them, etc. a lot of these cases should be loan based though. For people with preexisting conditions that do not prevent them from work must work though.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris The elderly should’ve solved this problem a while ago. It’s like not preparing for winter. They also have social security to help them out in addition to any retirement plan.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris If we’re talking about drug companies or hospitals the customers are sick people, the incentive is profit. The idea is to make a drug that treats a symptom and then lower the cost of that drug as much as possible to be competitive. Price controls prevent this.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris The incentive is money, your customers would be people who need medical insurance. That company could lower prices to very low overhead costs and the price of drugs if they were operating competitively
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris 3) In a free market no price is established. Whenever a company is complacent they'll be outcompeted, and this happens faster when the barriers to entry are low.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris 2) People with more health issues would fall into high risk insurance and would have to pay more. Not necessarily unfair, just something you have to do to survive.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris 1) There can always be competition between large companies as price fixing is illegal, unless the government does it deterring anyone from entering a market
@IlhanMN They’re rich based on my choices. Why can’t a smart guy who invents something really useful live a nice life? If no one is forced to give him money what’s the problem? However the government does take my money and give it to poor people.

@cwcooper @KamalaHarris It’s like buying different foods. You need food to live, and some food has a higher saturation level and rightly costs more. Everyone buys their own food. Everyone can. We can do the same with prescription drugs.
@cwcooper @KamalaHarris There’s different types of insulin like long lasting versus not. It’s an insulin shot every couple hours versus every day.
@cwcooper @kurltownsen @KamalaHarris Or I could use money I saved while working to pay for it like. And anyone with a low enough income can get Medicaid but they also get most of their income tax back. How is that fair?
I wonder why rent is so expensive in San Francisco. Couldn’t possibly be because the government is too big. https://t.co/JDidLAmbb8
@cwcooper @kurltownsen @KamalaHarris I may never use Medicare. We also have Medicaid, which I also pay for, and don’t use. I’m paying for two different healthcare providers and not using them. This is insane. It doesn’t matter that we all pay for it I just want everyone to pay for their own stuff. That’s fair!
@brightsided1029 @cwcooper @KamalaHarris This guy gets it
@cwcooper @KamalaHarris Buying food is also akin to survival. I’ve conceded there might be a role for government in the ER, but not for prescription drugs that shouldn’t be purchased by insurance anyways.
@cwcooper @kurltownsen @KamalaHarris Yes I do. Doesn’t mean the group of people is all of America. Give me the freedom to choose which group I join.
A lot of groundwork needs to be laid before health insurance startups can even begin selling plans. They must have sufficient resources to meet statutory reserves in the markets where they operate. They also need to establish provider networks that meet adequacy standards.
@kurltownsen @cwcooper @KamalaHarris I pay for Medicare through my taxes. I still have not used it, nor ever will. I don’t want it, a lot of hospitals don’t accept it, it’s not useful to me but I’m forced to pay for it. How is that a choice.
@cwcooper @KamalaHarris Some of these countries also have freer markets, and the Scandinavian ones are oil rich and very good communities. There’s no gangs  in Norway. There’s no one to abuse a welfare system.
@cwcooper @brightsided1029 @KamalaHarris At Walmart you can get Novolin N for $25. Openup the market more and it’ll get cheaper.
@cwcooper @kurltownsen @KamalaHarris I know I can’t opt out of taxes that’s the point, I want to keep expenditures of the government as low as possible so I can make more decisions with my money, not less. Maybe I can buy my own cheaper healthcare instead of government healthcare, but you won’t let me choose.
@Cernovich No one is stopping you from talking about vaccines. Maybe vaccines should be mandatory because the children are too young to make a choice but not vaccinating them could be child neglect. We can talk about the science all you want but it’s pretty clear.
@kurltownsen @cwcooper @KamalaHarris I don’t care what our average health is I just want to be able to choose whether or not I buy healthcare. The government shouldn’t be signing me up for it.
@BernieSanders I don’t want to be forced to pay for healthcare. If you want healthcare cool go start your own or buy from someone who is in that industry,  but don’t force me to buy it.
@jenevieve_smith @KamalaHarris Maybe we should look into some anti trust laws but I am confident a free market could bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
@cwcooper @KamalaHarris Let me start an insulin company then. It has a start up price of like 20k. The problem is that you need like $10 mil in lawyers to have a chance because of how involved our government is in our healthcare system.

@kromesburg14 @KamalaHarris There's half a million in USA, not outrageously high. I was meaning more like to give kids to grandparents or aunts
It looks like the unions in auto companies have brought the company down. Unions can work in regions with surplus in labor but you got to be careful to make sure they don't get too big.
@kromesburg14 @KamalaHarris I don't think children should starve. I'm not going to reward parents for being irresponsible. Let the state take em, your parents are obviously bad.
I love that @GM did the Volt. It was such an ambitious thing for them. Bob Lutz cracks me up. The car comes with a CD of gas engine noises. @boblutz
@kromesburg14 @KamalaHarris It's your parents fault you starved, they should've been better.
@kromesburg14 @KamalaHarris They don't deserve it. I assume they're making low wages, and paying low taxes, meaning they haven't put enough into the system, so why should they get anything out?
Does @elonmusk just throw himself into ridiculous situations with high payoffs, burn his bridges, forcing him to get stuff done?
@kromesburg14 @KamalaHarris Lesson learned, don't have sex until you can afford a family. Sounds fair? I shouldn't have to pay for your family's welfare because I didn't make that mistake.

@siobhanphoenix @SamCoppinger @unalienablerght @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @PeterPaynePPKS @maegansmiles04 @msmoyaknow @LPNational @LarrySharpe @DaleKernsJr A cow takes two years to mature lives for about twenty. The Chinese government is putting a significant tariff on them. I understand how it could take the market a while to adapt. That’s the price of a trade war. It’s designed for a net benefit.
@siobhanphoenix @SamCoppinger @unalienablerght @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @PeterPaynePPKS @maegansmiles04 @msmoyaknow @LPNational @LarrySharpe @DaleKernsJr Then we should cut regulations. I still think tariffs make sense against China though, to encourage domestic manufacturing.
@siobhanphoenix @SamCoppinger @unalienablerght @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @PeterPaynePPKS @maegansmiles04 @msmoyaknow @LPNational @LarrySharpe @DaleKernsJr We have too much food production. It’s subsidized and a bad idea to be reliant on foreign countries for essential commodities.
Why does everyone think we need a tech breakthrough? Solar, EV’s, and batteries are already cheap enough to replace traditional energy sources through the free market. No need for a government now as Tesla Steamrolls the automotive and energy markets. https://t.co/dwfoPuh7Ez

The US agriculture market has grown too big with countless subsidies. The market is not meant to support this many farms.
@MatthewAryCEO @january212017 @KamalaHarris I understand that. Tax credits are when we let someone pay less taxes because they do something good, or in a bad situation, like EV credits are child credits.
Ben Shapiro in his interview with John Stossel mentioned the singularity, which I think is the first time I've ever these type of people talk about artificial intelligence
@MatthewAryCEO @january212017 @KamalaHarris I think everyone should have to pay taxes, just that it shouldn't be cost of living specific.
@siobhanphoenix @SamCoppinger @unalienablerght @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @PeterPaynePPKS @maegansmiles04 @msmoyaknow @LPNational @LarrySharpe @DaleKernsJr You should never use anecdotes to come up with policy. Tariffs don't usually make sense but in a country as but as the US we should have tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. You may get more expensive goods but in exchange for jobs.
@siobhanphoenix @SamCoppinger @unalienablerght @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @PeterPaynePPKS @maegansmiles04 @msmoyaknow @LPNational @LarrySharpe @DaleKernsJr I'm neutral on him too. I'm pretty libertarian but I do like things like tariffs, which I think ultimately is a job creator or at least wage raiser.
@MatthewAryCEO @january212017 @KamalaHarris No it concerns the government because now someone is paying less taxes. I agree we should have less taxes but not specifically for people living in expensive markets. That's unfair.
@elizabethforma Just create a system where jobs are abundant and then market forces will drive wages up. Do things like making it easy to start a company, restrict outsourcing with tariffs, and keep immigration low in low skill labor markets

Stocks are valued on how likely they’re to make money. There’s two ways to make money, either the share price increases and you sell it or it pays a dividend. Successful companies are likely to pay big dividends to investors, and are valued accordingly.
I want to make sure everyone understands what the stock market is. A company sells a share on the market to raise money. Then later the share pays off a profit, or a dividend. That is the basic idea it’s all built on.
People need to relax when talking about the stock market. Stock price is just the valuation of a share of a company. You don’t immediately assume a store is doing well because it has expensive goods.
@The_UnSilent_ That just shows volatility in valuations. Doesn’t really reflect the economy.
@BenSasse Sure, but if done right they bring jobs back. Americans buy too much and should innovate their own economy if they want cheaper goods.
@benshapiro They're not an economic cost just a trade. It's jobs for more expensive goods when trading with a low wage workforce that doesn't buy your goods.

@SenSanders @t1international Let people start more insulin companies and sell from other states and then the price will really drop.

@Pappiness GM is a pretty bad company. They made the mistake of being too reliant on foreign supply chains. Tesla, the most American Car by supply chain and production, is creating jobs. Tesla is unfairly hit by tariffs from other countries. This is where it’s at.

@jorgeramosnews It’s not insane to want to control the rate of immigration. There’s just too many people right now coming in from one area. I think most Americans would be happy to accept Central A,Eric and who are skilled, like those who had worked in car factories.
@nytimes Judging from the comments you should realize people want truth, not the obvious narrative you’re selling. Look at reporting from people like Bloomberg or even some smaller outlets. VICE for example would be an example of a decent media outlet.
No wonder GM is cutting their expansion. In the truck market, the one with the highest gross margin, they’re losing to ford. Their sedans are really that competitive amongst Toyota. They spent way too much on RnD. I think the volt was their best car to date.
Tesla is dominating its markets and as automation and vertical integration increase and they hit lower price points and get into new markets. They’re going to have very big market share in all new vehicle sales. @Tesla https://t.co/8duqBQiipN

@Ocasio2018 Yes we do all the time. A lot of them are cronies who support too much military and fossil fuel industries. Securing our border however is a good idea if you want wages to go and union participation to increase.
@RBReich The cause of the financial crisis was banks giving out sub prime loans. The correct course of action would've been to let the banks fail and bail out the public. Banks who don't manage risk accordingly should go out of business.
The incentive is on illegal immigration because we reward those who come illegally with quicker asylum process which will most likely be rejected in long run rather than 6 month wait on border for asylum hearing.

@giizhigokwe @Ocasio2018 The only healthcare industry in a fairly unregulated free market that could be considered healthcare is the laser eye surgery market, which saw prices go down. Things like Obamacare, made prices go up.
@giizhigokwe @Ocasio2018 Also if you can't support yourself don't have kids. Within one year of an entry level manufacturing job you can get to $15 an hour. With two parents you could raise raise a kid even in a relatively expensive county at 50 hours a week.

One engineer using no welfare will be taxed at 24%. If each one of the Mexicans gets as much welfare as they pay in taxes they’d produce 0$, while the engineer could pay 24k. Not saying it’s like this but it could be.

Generally the kids of Mexican immigrants leans pretty far left. Letting them in gives an unfair advantage to a party creating a positive feedback loop that’ll create a monopoly that is very unhealthy.

An engineer from Germany is going to produce the same tax money as a dozen Mexicans working low skill labor who get most of their money back and pay little in taxes while using welfare. It’s a skewed statistic.

First legal immigrants are an obvious cream of the crop. They’re willing to be patient and work with us and pass certain requirements so of course they’re good. You lower the bar and let more in you can worse and worse immigrants.

Just get back to the point which is immigration, and that we have an abundance of low skill labor, and importing at a faster rate will damage the economy and voting demographics.

You should be able to control entry into your country. Assimilation rate = immigration rate. If not you get too concentrated of culture not centered around your countries values.
