@2020Delegates Makes sense if we were determining the primaries by national popular vote.  But seems smarter to tailor the weighting for the prizes of the Senate, electoral college and CDs which are decidedly not won by national popular vote.  Current system seems to be halfway between the two.
@2020Delegates I was having trouble finding the rules of how they’re distributed on a congressional district level, but on the state level it’s clear the setup gives extra weight to the states which already vote heavily blue (we could say establishment Dem states).
@2020Delegates The practice of giving blue regions and states more delegates than swing states may please the base but it sure won’t help expand the map.   If we want to win every district we should weight them appropriately instead of tipping the scales.
