@Haloxrash @online_nobody @eclecticbrotha @tomwatson No. They didn’t. Individual, decentralized primaries &amp; caucuses which Clinton won by nearly 4 million votes. That’d be some rigging right there. Didn’t happen. 	And I’m just me; haven’t asked ‘Flash’ what he thinks about it.
@online_nobody @eclecticbrotha @tomwatson Because he’s an alleged independent running as a Democrat who did a lot of damage disrupting the Democratic Party in 2016 and being used - unwittingly, or perhaps wittingly given Tad Devine? - to spread Russian disinformation which his fans aggressively embraced&amp;weaponized?

Q&amp;A TONIGHT at 6:30 at the #PensacolaLittleTheater ❗️⚡️☄️💫 #Pensacon https://t.co/ZNrK4NchMf
@HorusArisen Then why have we had exclusively male presidents, or even major party nominees - w the historic exception of @HillaryClinton - in the past 230 years when gender, as you suggest, “doesn’t bring special enlightenment”?
@lorelilee18346 🌹😉
@HorusArisen If we waited for an entirely pure motive we’d either be paralyzed or susceptible to tilting at windmills.
@HorusArisen It’s true there’s not 1 institution known to man that man hasn’t been able to corrupt including church. Reform&amp;regulate. There r certainly good choices and some far less toxic than others. And the lesser of two evils is by definition the greater good, so ... Participation is key.

@PhotosRoberto No it isn’t. Going down under Obama, Bill Clinton left a BUDGET SURPLUS before both Republican presidents wiped it out with their tax cuts for the super rich. Come on really inform yourself-you can do better.
@ItIsSpeltJON Nope. It was decreasing under Obama, and Bill Clinton wiped it out completely and left George W. Bush a surplus before he wiped it out and plunged us back into debt with HIS tax cuts for the super rich. See the pattern? Democracy depends upon an educated and informed electorate.

When you start w a bully on the 50 yd line, give ground to your own 25, then the #media reports bothsideism because you won’t retreat inside your 20, that’s messed up.
Happened in media w ACA. Obama wanted single-payer, compromised to Republican idea of public option, then compromised that away. Then Dems branded as being uncooperative because they stood firm after 2 compromises.
Ok @TODAYshow about T-wall, stop saying compromise on both sides is unlikely. Dems have already compromised&amp;then went to White House w 2 more proposals that Individ 1 turned into press circus. Now he’s insisting they compromise the compromise. Why do you go #bothsidesism w/ that?
