@JBSteins I didn't even notice. No explanation necessary!
@peterlattman When the Skins beat the Giants 23-10, I never envisioned this. Congrats.
Pretty amazing run by the Giants.
Devin Thomas recovers it again!
49ers Justin Smith is a beast
Overrrrrtiiiime
Devon Thomas with the recovery...assuming replay does it's job.
Lee Evans are you kidding?!?
@jjs362 the answer appears to be: no
Pivotal moment for Flacco here.
@jjs362 understand going for the kill shot but seemed like a bad call. Milk some clock, get in fg range to go up 6.
@SI_PeterKing Good chance Philbin goes after Flynn? If he doesn't, is that a red flag for Flynn given he says QB is Fins biggest need?
Heartbreaker for Caps against hated Pens. Ugh.

Well, Tebow-Brady didn't quite live up to the hype
@SI_PeterKing tough questions coming on that Brady punt? Why would you do that? Except to entertain yourself? Way too risky.
Don't understand the Brady punt. As @jjswick says: what if he pulls his hammy punting? Stupid
Rex Grossman did better than this. Bad night for Tebow.

Alex Smith doesn't look like a bust now. Sorry I ever doubted you. Who remembers sideline fights w/ Singeltary now?
Vernon Davis. You can't stop him. You can only hope to contain him

That first Saints play seems to suggest Payton thinks: Give Sproles the --- ball.
