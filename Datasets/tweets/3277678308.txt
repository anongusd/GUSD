@DanielMaximoff @capkronos @DErmold To quote your own words "Those who are offended easily and focus all their energy on nonexistent issues are the ones who die from heart attacks/brain damage at an early age." You are making up facts and working yourself up. Take a breath. It'll all be okay.

@DanielMaximoff @PissOffCult45 @capkronos @DErmold Again, twisting words to fit your own narrative. Welcoming religions does not mean allowing others to impose theirs on others.

@Twi8td @Lara_Miller @DisneyKid1955 @farhip @seanhannity So he is going to have to say he sought out to possibly retain Cohen's legal services then? He also says he has done this on more than one occasion, ie not a consult. I am not an attorney, but I think this would be a huge stretch. Maybe an actual attorney could weigh in on that.
@Lara_Miller @DisneyKid1955 @farhip @seanhannity And I would definitely say there is a difference between asking a generic question about the law and asking for personal advice. A how the system works question is much different than "I was in an accident and..." Cohen and Hannity are idiots here.
@DisneyKid1955 @farhip @seanhannity https://t.co/u96EVWigVE
@DisneyKid1955 @farhip @seanhannity I'm married to an attorney. I know he would agree with me that it doesn't make the act of doing it any less stupid even if some do it all the time. It is a stupid thing to do.
@DisneyKid1955 @farhip @seanhannity True. But if we say Cohen did just answer a bunch of questions, none of that is privileged information and is fair game (and also is very stupid on Cohen's part as an attorney). He can't cry confidentiality and then claim there was no attorney client relationship.
