@alaxic you should have it.
@alaxic i tried, but when i go to your page, there is no option for me to message you *anywhere*. i'll email.
@alaxic not going to post my email publicly. i'll have to have some other way of giving it to you.
@alaxic also, no rush, but if those invites have gone out, i didn't get one for some reason -- and i'm still blocked on the fb page.
@alaxic such as? i've been making a point of trying not to be rude, so idk what ur talking about.
@alaxic i'm not quite sure how you're thinking i will message you... i mean, i can't on here or on fb.
@alaxic Fair enough. I'll try to remember that.
@alaxic @TheSandboxNow wow, i thought i was being helpful by alerting you to problems. thanks for deleting my comments and blocking me. :P

@alaxic Unfortunately, I'm sure you're right.
@alaxic I guarantee you, any grammar sticklers that see it would think "incorrect punctuation" before they would think "poetic license" ;)
@alaxic It's not huge. It's just that the comma in "The Internet, Is Now Rewarding." shouldn't be there.
@alaxic actually i pointed it out to her after she gave me the address to your test site. ;)
@alaxic i got nothing against you personally, i'm just a pawn in this fight lol
@alaxic me, of course. that was the implication. :)
@alaxic but guess who *can* code.

@TxsConservative u missed the point. nullification is unconstitutional only if the fed. govt is WITHIN their constitutional limits!
@TxsConservative that's what they were saying about Scott Brown a month ago.
@TxsConservative uhh she owns a business with her husband. plus your Fortune 500 comment is your opinion and nothing more.
@TxsConservative really? You're comparing Medina to Obama? There is almost no similarity there.
@TxsConservative what you mean to say is that after the last debate, Medina JUMPED 8% in the polls and she's only going up.
@TxsConservative I want someone with a fresh vision who's not steeped in politics. All that bickering between Rick and Kay = not for me.
@TxsConservative Did you watch the debate on TV? Medina ran mental circles around Rick and Kay. She knew what she was talking about.
@TxsConservative Do you really want 4 more years of the same inaction and lipservice? Not to mention he's been in office too long already.
@TxsConservative I have no doubt she supports Scott Brown.
@TxsConservative how is medina weakening the GOP? she's not competing against Democrats in the primaries.

decided the firefox extension "Brief" is not for me. having lots of large feeds spikes RAM usage, & it can be sluggish at times.

FINALLY they're mentioning the UAW as part of the problem, which they are!! http://cli.gs/VNqv5G
oooh, it has support for gears. i might have to install that now.
ooooh, i just upgraded to wordpress 2.7 :}
@jeffisageek i'm about to make the jump too :)
tweetburner should really upgrade in some way.
@TwitterFox idea of how to fix size of scrollbar: make the whole window taller.
@pierrefar this i have briefly contemplated once or twice. but first i'd want to know how many of my programs would work under wine.
@cligs no, but all the others combined probably would be.
@cligs if only i had made a detailed listing of the analytics that other uri-shrinkers offer.
@twitter thank you for bringing back my DM delete button :)
@pierrefar as far as i can tell, it's pointless because it doesn't work! i type in a username, hit enter, wait, and then get a blank screen.

@pierrefar lol
@mangek009 no need to feel down... it certainly doesn't help anything.
trying to make the perfect 3-column layout for a site i'm working on. it should be easier than this.
@bloom1 then i was thinking the tall floor stand would be the better deal. that one comes with an extra USB extension cord.
@bloom1 well what are you using it for?
@cligs good post!
@twitter you've removed the ability to delete DMs??? why?
@cligs ah, good work. btw, one of the things i like about cligs is that the service is very personal.
I have discovered Brief, an RSS reader for Firefox, and I really like it. Used to use Sage/SageToo but Brief has won me over.
now found 26 MORE URI shrinkers, plus a page on Mashable listing over 90 of them that i'll have to go through... wow.
is it bad if i try to keep up (somewhat) with everyone i follow, and prune out the ones i find to be less than necessary?
and i now have 28 more uri shrinkers to add to the list. that will bring me to a total of uhh...(start&gt;run&gt;calc&gt;47+28)... 75! w ...
just returned from the bleeding edge having 45 tabs open at once across 2 firefox windows. good grief. RAM usage not *too bad* i guess:230mb
@cligs Just came across a LOT more URL shrinkers! Will be adding them to the report ASAP.
so i'll retweet myself: It's done! New blog post: "Comparison of URL Shrinking Services" - http://snipr.com/72ef9 - retweet please!

@cligs ah, of course. my research is nearly complete.
@pierrefar what's an easy way to test a url-shrinker to see if it does 301 permanent redirects (like yours)?

@digsby after 6+ hours of running, plus one lengthy FB chat conversation, digsby's taking up 255MB of RAM on my laptop. that is CRAZY.
@woot i wonder if some other scripting language would be more efficient for BOCs than ASP.net. oh and apache beats IIS any day.
duuuuuuude.... check out Gmail's new themes. utter sweetness. if you don't have a gmail account... then why aren't you getting one?
@sitepointdotcom would have been wiser to use a url-shrinking service with tried-and-true capacity for something like this - NOT icanhaz.com
but should i overwrite my gentoo install?
hmm... maybe i should install ubuntu on my desktop pc. yeah, i can keep xp on one hd and put ubuntu on the other. that should be good.
i'm compiling a list of as many URL-shrinking services as i can find, and will be blogging about it soon - with comparison charts too.
