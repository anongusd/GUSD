@ADT There was no confusion on my part. Your rep misrepresented it as a direct line to tech support. Perhaps more training is called for.
@ADT Your employee said she would give me a direct number for tech support. Then she gave me the same 800 number I had called. Pitiful!
Letting you know, @ADT, I was on hold for over an hour before getting my issue resolved. Truly inexcusable, even with the bad weather in FL!
Hey, @ADT, if you're "always there," why have I been on hold for 45 minutes? Is my call really important to you?
