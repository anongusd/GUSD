@realDonaldTrump Emoluments.
@RealJamesWoods So competitive Dem primaries is the same as authoritarian repression?  Idiot ..
@thehill If he believes in predestination, Hitler was also chosen.
@ENBrown Not a fan of the skunk stripes. Maybe dye the middle chin the same color?
@samstein @TheDuhalde You realize “the list” is just for open competitive primaries, right?   Idiots ..
@DonaldJTrumpJr Actually I think you self-owned on that one.
@RealJamesWoods This tweet doesn't make any sense.
@realDonaldTrump So the book manuscript is gospel?  Ok ..
@thehill I don't find DPRK trustworthy, but dishonesty IS such a part of DJT's negotiating and governing style ...
@thehill Sounds like he’s also defending Jussie Smollett (another check writer)?
@nowthisnews But ... he’s a birther who said Obama should go back to Kenya ..
@RaymondArroyo @IngrahamAngle Pickin all the meat off that bone, ain’t ya!
@TheRickWilson “at”??
@EricTrump These are the crumbs.
@alexburnsNYT The paper chase ... all the president’s men ... the usual suspects ...
@jordanbpeterson Whatever that means ...
@jpodhoretz Are there people who LIKE going to those?
@thehill Sycophant
@DonaldJTrumpJr TBH I listened to a lot of it and suspect he's generally telling the truth this time around.
@brianschatz One could argue "bananas" and "extremely bananas" mean the same thing. OTOH, it's hard to argue photosynthesis disproves climate change.
@JVLast Maybe he’s just not into politics?
@jonathanchait @brianbeutler You can’t handle the truth!!
@JoeTalkShow Weak commentary
@newtgingrich Ur such a hack.
@MEPFuller The indignant birther.
@CarlosLozadaWP #winning
@thehill I don't disagree ... But Cohen expressing an opinion about your judgment isn't exactly a death sentence.
@pourmecoffee @realDonaldTrump The troll-in-chief is feeling trolled?
@thehill Whatever the heck that is ...
@AOC For the record, I'd be intd in inheriting and marrying into money as well.  Earning it is for the birds.
@TheRickWilson It’s a tight knit community.
@thehill The mocking laugh will get under his skin.
@TCPalm dude must be insatiable.
@TheStalwart Wait Queen is a real band?  I thought it was just fictional in the Bohemian Rhapsody movie.
@geekgirldiva @yashar Clearly the real musician btw the two.
@IngrahamAngle These themes are funny to conservatives.
@IngrahamAngle @RaymondArroyo It got me to watch Roma, which I enjoyed.

@redsteeze So say we all.
@RealJamesWoods Meh you’ve never eaten salad with a comb?
@HolmesJosh But the Times Square bill board ... You were involved, no?

@HolmesJosh @jdawsey1 The botmaster of Times Square
@ComfortablySmug Excuses excuses ... shamelessly defending “inflate-gate” ...
@swin24 Holy mackerel, are you weaponizing the shrimp?
@MollyJongFast Maybe they're just not ticketing it as aggressively?
@JuddLegum I have become intd in this "CEO" arrangement you speak of.  It sounds appealing.
@turbocheetoh @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump What is a perjury trap? Is that where an investigator asks you questions, and you are trapped because you are lying to him?  The law must be full of traps ... fraud traps, robbery traps, murder traps ... hell i've been caught in speed traps.
@turbocheetoh @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump That's why the Trump legal team resisted an in-person interview with Mueller. In retrospect, the Clinton legal team probably should have done the same. After all, the questions that led to Clinton's perjury charge was unrelated to the original purpose of the Starr investigation.
@turbocheetoh @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump So it will follow the Whitewater / Ken Starr / Clinton path, where the final sin is unrelated to the original cause of investigation?  I guess we'll see.  You should play the lottery if you can see the future so clearly.
@garybullockreal @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump o wait ... i see what you did there .  ;-) .  .... I try to collude every day in some form ... it's good for the soul.
@garybullockreal @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump Sure ... in addition to whatever official processes are triggered by the report ... which really depends on what it contains.
@wdunlap @realDonaldTrump Disingenuous b/c Mueller has a specific process where evidence will be presented at the end and they are not leaking in the interim. You'll see the evidence soon enough, and then we can all come to our own conclusions.
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews And frankly the longer I've been in the workforce, the more I'm convinced you do most of your learning on the job, so a well-rounded liberal arts degree that teaches you "how to think" is a great thing.
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews These are all liberal arts colleges referred to in the OP ... where the Democrat professors teach.
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Degrees fr liberal arts colleges lead to plenty of great jobs.  1 friend fr Middlebury is an M&amp;A investment advisor. Others fr Bowdoin &amp; Swarthmore r congressional staff.
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews You can also get an economics or psych degree at a liberal arts college.
@RealJamesWoods Conservative media also working to make him so famous. Both feeding off the same bones.
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Do you believe that liberal arts universities do not award degrees in economics, psychology, etc?
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews https://t.co/tssXQTdqG9
@RustyRigger @charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews That's your rebuttal?

@portaguee71 @DonaldJTrumpJr Read the email exchange that Don Jr himself released ... esp the first one ...and ask yourself if it is "evidence" of collusion.  Perhaps he will have an alternate explanation ... but it's most definitely evidence  https://t.co/HtZSTGGhef
@portaguee71 @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you serve on the OJ jury too?
@redsteeze u so jelly
@portaguee71 @DonaldJTrumpJr Don Jr's Trump Tower meeting with the Russians is "evidence" ... and not a feeling or a hunch.  I leave to others whether it will be combined with other evidence to amount to proof.
@DonaldJTrumpJr For the record, he did say "direct proof" ... there is plenty of "evidence," and minds will differ on whether the evidence amounts to proof.

@thehill I think a rite of passage in this Pres election is getting through the oppo dump when your rivals try to set you on fire out of the gate. Kamala got through. Elizabeth not so much. This won’t blow up Amy. Biden’s is still coming.
@RaisesMoney @aterkel @mtredden @democrats @HuffPost The source is probably the other Dems in the 2020 Pres race. If you can set your rivals on fire out of the gate, you can be the one left standing.

@mare6367 @thehill Yep agree ... I think she's accepting the attention ... but she's also allowed to dish it back at folks, which she's good at.

@CSmithengton @sayit_PrezTrump @RealJamesWoods Is that a Senate rule or a floor speech?
@CSmithengton @sayit_PrezTrump @RealJamesWoods Obstruction is not really a conservative argument after Merrick Garland. You turned that card in already.
@CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods Alright I have to get back to work ... I understand your hardball argument.  You're just forfeiting any moral right to lecture liberals about the constitution in the future.  Good times.
@CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods I take each one on its merits.  I think Obama tried that with an NLRB nom and the courts overturned it.
@CSmithengton @sayit_PrezTrump @RealJamesWoods The Senate just approved 15 more judicial noms when it recessed. It's sad that we've devolved from "Advice and Consent" to "Fight fire with fire."
@CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods Because the Senate was scheduled to be in session, presumably.
@CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods A month ago, McConnell was planning to keep the Senate in session through October.  Seriously, holding confirmation hearings when the Senate is in recess makes a mockery of the advice and consent function.
@sayit_PrezTrump @CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods That makes no sense.  Angry Republicans getting angry at Democrats is not a good argument.
@Rhye_The_Word @RealJamesWoods Meh ... the Senate is in recess.  McConnell's original plan was to stay in session through October. That is your explanation.
@CSmithengton @RealJamesWoods I don't feel bound by what Hillary said ... I think regular order and respecting the constitutional role of the Senate makes sense.
@RealJamesWoods To be clear ... This version of "revenge" is one more step in debasing the Senate's Constitutional advice and consent role. I know both sides of trended toward more hardball in recent years, but each step is a little worse for democracy.

@smallgovlizard @GwailoMD @AG_Conservative @EWErickson It’s the simplest thing. Just conduct an investigation, talk to witnesses, look for corroborating evidence and then call her as a witness.  It’s the usual way, except that folks are very defensive of Kavanaugh and don’t want to hear it.

@thehill Low expectations
@DLoesch FBI investigated Anita Hill’s accusations
@smallgovlizard @AG_Conservative @EWErickson It fits right in. If there’s new info, the FBI is the entity to investigate and supplement. The 6 previous checks kind of proves my point.
@AG_Conservative @EWErickson FBI role is to conduct background checks for SCOTUS noms. Check it.
@thehill If true, that’s not right either
@EWErickson Are you one of those "surrogates" who channels all the nasty stuff elected Republicans can't say?
@murphymike In a real court, investigation happens before testimony. That's why the FBI background check should be reopened, evidence gathered, etc.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @MattForMontana I take it you support the Maryland guy?

@BillOReilly But the FBI should at least conduct an impartial investigation, right?
@tribelaw “Not even checking it out” doesn’t seem to be a viable position here.
@applehopacado @SenFeinstein It all turns on what actually happened. Investigations are simply the process of gathering evidence to find out. If what happened matters, why wouldn’t you investigate?
