@bdcowboyup @DRUDGE_REPORT Agreed, I guess the next step to take would be to brush up on basic survival skills. Life as we know it would be set back about 100 years if the entire grid went down. People would lose their minds.

@Skycat147 @n4hpg and last but not least....‚ÄùKiel also said the state Department of Justice was well aware and supportive of the Masonic Fraternal Police Department, according to Hernandez's testimony.‚Äù 		I wonder HOW supportive the DOJ was/is of the Masonic Fraternal Police Dept. ü§î
@Skycat147 @n4hpg This should also be concerning: ‚ÄúDet. Amalia Hernandez testified that during the meeting, Kiel did much of the talking and said the group would not handle 911 emergency calls, only matters internal to the Masonic groups.‚Äù ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Does this mean they are below or above the law?!
@Skycat147 @n4hpg ..‚ÄôCasselman said. "I think [police] are jealous of anyone who might be perceived as an interloper or, pardon the expression, a competitor."‚Äô		Jealous?! A competitor?! As though impersonating a police officer isn‚Äôt a crime.
@Skycat147 @n4hpg Here‚Äôs a follow-up by the LA Times a year later. Heart Attack? Seems convenient. It really seems like this ‚Äúfake police force‚Äù could be an actual thing.		Also, David‚Äôs attorney uses some pretty dangerous language with regards to the charges.		https://t.co/iDooEXEn34
@Skycat147 @n4hpg Without searching any further, I‚Äôm going to deduce that the patches are ‚Äúreal‚Äù, but not ones used by law enforcement as we, the general public, know it.

@n4hpg Most definitely! I was actually pro net neutrality until I started looking into it. I recognized that I can't make a stand until I've educated myself. It's a time issue for me. Working full time, being a Mom, Wife. Its tough to dig deep through the layers of misinformation.
@n4hpg It's actually a pretty exciting time to be alive. (Awake and alive). I feel like I was born for this.
@n4hpg People are generally reasonable. But they require that ah-ha moment that needs to really come from within. I hope to inspire people to find it.
@n4hpg I'm trying to reach both. I've been able to get some pretty hard hearts to soften with a gentle touch. Hoping that I can awaken many people with that sort of attitude.
@n4hpg I'm ready.  üí™üí™üôÜ
@n4hpg I'm fearful for what I find, but hopeful that I can help be a voice in it all! My generation is pretty much asleep at the wheel, but I agree, they are coming around! I've gone through ebbs and flows where I see truths, but it's alllllll flowing now.

@n4hpg Can I handle anymore truth at this point?! üòÇ Is this a book that will give me hope for the future or make me terrified of the past?
@AngPiazza Me either! I have been digging into things like crazy and learning just enough to know that there really is no denying it anymore. I can never unsee the things I've seen. Seeing is believing. But if you don't know what you're looking at, how can you what to believe?
I'm glad that I'm waking up. It's hard, I'm not going to lie. It requires some work, some un-fun investigative work. But if you care about anyone, even if it's just yourself. You will pay attention to what's happening around you.		#qanon #followthewhiterabbit #theGreatAwakening https://t.co/w9WLqcjiJZ
