@iingwen Is Taiwan a country ? When did Taiwan become independent !
新年恭喜！在2019诚挚祝福「猪」事行大运、身体健朗阖家平安、赚大钱！Congratulations to all of you! In 2019, I sincerely wish that the "Pig" will do great things, be healthy and healthy, and make big money ! https://t.co/vuBcsfhUsf
@gutmomo @iingwen Vast majority of Taiwanese want to live in peace and prosperity, not wars destruction and endless misery like those poor Syrians ! That's why majority of Taiwanese will choose peaceful reunification with mainland China and not wars and deaths !
@TWduli @iingwen You are probably out of touch with geopolitical and economic realities ! Nobody will want to hit their no.1 or no.2 customers on their heads and don't expect to get hurt in the process ! Donald Dump is trying very hard to extract US from the trade war. Go and read CNN, BBC &amp; CNBC
@EffyZhangmy Don't think it's mistakes. It's their true strategic intentions !
@TWduli @iingwen Sure ! That’s historical facts ! But China has grown out of these troubles ! China is not the largest economy by PPP ! Get your facts right and be realistic about the world affairs , please !
@TWduli @iingwen Obviously you have no idea of geopolitical reality &amp; economic realities ! No country will want to sanction their no. 1 or 2 trading partner ? That will hurt them economically too ! Taiwan problem is the internal matters of China; they are technically still at war; civil war  !
@TWduli @iingwen Sure, give me your bank account, I will TT US$1 as donation to you !
@gutmomo @iingwen No Taiwanese parents will want their children to end up refugees floating around Taiwan Straits or South China Sea !
@gutmomo @iingwen Who ever you are, please don’t push Taiwanese into fire of hell by being involved in conflicts between China &amp; USA. At the end of the day, vast majority of Taiwanese want to live in peace and prosperity, not wars and destruction !
@audreyt In all fairness, no one should be accused in such an open manner by Taiwanese press ! 	You must maintain your right of reply to safeguard your good reputation.
@audreyt You mean your partner complaining you of abusing her is not true ? If this the case, then you must let the Taiwan press know because we got such news through your press !
@audreyt But Audrey Tang abused his partner ! Does the Pride of Taiwan and Taiwan value include family violence and abuses ?
@GwenythWR That’s true ! We always enjoy rides in the MRT which is safe and reliable. 😀
@gutmomo @iingwen Tsai is pushing Taiwan into a Syrian style street warfares on the land of Taiwan, millions of Taiwanese will perished and millions more will suffered greatly with many more floating around Taiwan Straits and the rough South China Sea ! Is this the future Taiwanese want ? 😱
@TinT98494980 @iingwen Tsai is pushing Taiwan into a Syrian style street warfares on the land of Taiwan, millions of Taiwanese will perished and millions more will suffered greatly with many more floating around Taiwan Straits and the rough South China Sea ! Is this the future Taiwanese want ? 😱
@TWduli @iingwen What is Wumao ? If you need, I can donate US$1 to you 😀
@TWduli @iingwen If Taiwan engage in a Syrian style street to street warfares on the land of Taiwan, millions of Taiwanese will perished and millions more will suffered greatly with many more floating around Taiwan Straits and the rough South China Sea ! Is this the future Taiwanese want ? 😱
@BonnieGlaser Why ? Because Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America ! Better to talk to the real boss.
@iingwen Instead of keeping Taiwan &amp; Taiwanese safe, you are pushing Taiwan &amp; Taiwanese into the hell fire of armed conflicts with China .... You are the worse nightmare that are coming true for Taiwan &amp; Taiwanese !
@iingwen Because of your selfish ideologies, you are going to drag Taiwan into conflicts between China &amp; USA, and along with it the lives of these young fresh face soldiers and the terrible fates of Taiwanese at large ! You are the worse leader in the democratic free world ! Shame on you!
@oliviaabland Yes ! You have made the right decision to decline a job that you are not comfortable especially giving the fact the CEO are abusive and insulting ! No corporate leader who worth his salt would put his employees down to the level of hurting their self esteems and sense of honours!
@Tangiokhai @Everybo76757606 @BonnieGlaser Since when has Taiwan become an independent country ? Which year ? Can't answer ? That's because there is no such thing as Taiwan independence happening and there no such thing as Taiwan is an independent country ! 玻璃心 😡😰😀
@Tangiokhai @Everybo76757606 @BonnieGlaser Your response is so childish unbecoming of serious discussion here 😂
@BonnieGlaser The Joint Communique acknowledge that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China, switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The United States also recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China !
@Tangiokhai @Everybo76757606 @BonnieGlaser Since when has Taiwan become an independent country ? Which year ?
@BonnieGlaser Under One China Principle, and even according to the Taiwan Relations Act, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. 	The future of Taiwan needs to be decided by 23 million people on the island of Taiwan and by 1,411 million people on mainland China ! 	Please get your facts right !
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR Have you been to China ? Do you know China is so huge and so vast ! Rather than criticise criticise and criticise China, go and visit China yourself and you will realised what I am trying to advocate.
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR Do you naively think that knock on the door in the middle of the night only happened in China ? Do you naively believe that it doesn't happened in Taiwan, USA, UK, France .... and many other places ? If the answer is yes, then you are really naïve !
@MikeFaganTaiwan @GwenythWR Frankly, to majority of Taiwan family, their choices are no choice ! Either peace or war ! Either life or death ! Either have a choice to make good living or live a stagnate economic lives !
@MikeFaganTaiwan @GwenythWR Yes ! If it's a choice between having your family and country totally destroyed and have an opportunity to live a better life with an enormous country as our hinterland ! Would you choose the total destruction of your whole family and country in the face of such a huge opponent?
@BonnieGlaser When US aircraft carrier sail through The Taiwan Strait, it will be great moment to give the PLA a great opportunity to practice the dry run of missiles defence systems generating sufficient data to be ready for the real thing one day in future ! What is the US military thinking?
@GwenythWR If One Country Two system through peaceful negotiation is not viable for Taiwan people, then will family men and women of Taiwan choose One Country One System through non peaceful means for the future of their children ??? The choice is obvious !
@EMArbTrader There is no such thing as a "Taiwan Constitutions" to begin with. Secondly, Republic of China's (ROC) constitution 中華民國憲法 is a Unification of One China Constitution which begin with "Before the full and completion unification of China" ! Don't be fooled by MAC !
USA certainly demonstrated to the world at large why liberal democratic systems of government cannot work to pursue happiness, prosperity and progress for her people ! Especially when compare against an authoritarian system such as China ‘s CCP ! Good results is what matters !
@seungminkim USA certainly demonstrated to the world at large why liberal democratic systems of government cannot work to pursue happiness, prosperity and progress for her people ! Especially when compare against an authoritarian system such as China ‘s CCP ! Good results is what matters !
@BonnieGlaser Bonnie, many of us respect and trust you and CSIS for doing a lot of important research ! Soldier on !
@BonnieGlaser Don't expect China to do nothing but be at the receiving end of these US attacks ! There is a Chinese saying that US needs to learn about Chinese ; "You don't touch me, I won't touch you. But if you persisted on offending me, I will return one deadly blow to make you stop !" FYI.
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR https://t.co/X4I3G2Wx3O
@BonnieGlaser Why not appoint Vincent Chao as Taiwan Representative to US since he is such a Taiwan's brightest and best diplomat, well-connected among foreign diplomats ? Again, why attacked Taiwan'e media ? Thought Americans are great believer of Freedom of speech ? Double standards again !
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR From 5000 years history of China; the rise and fall of dynasty happened with a certain time cycle ! This will apply to China after they unify with Taiwan and it will also apply to USA &amp; others ! It’s a matter of time depending how the world evolves, just like death is a certainty
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR We are heading into a no win situation for all.Either you are my friend or else you will be my enemy; This is the way USA is pushing every country to pick sides ! On a daily basis, we are being subjected to endless vituperation from Trump Administration!  This is the new normal !
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR The world is increasingly polarised into another Cold War and all nations will be forced to take sides ! Yes, might is right. That’s reality! It’s call the thucydides trap ! It’s happening and all of us will be dragged into it wether we like it or not !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Hey dumb dumb ! You seriously believe that there is freedom of anything in this high surveillant world ; be it in USA, UK, Europe, Asia ? The world is increasingly polarised into another Cold War and all nations will be forced to take sides ! Yes, might is right. That’s reality!
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR Don't be hypocrite ! Countries like USA, UK, France etc have been using "might is right" strategies and methods for decades to bully others ! So are these powers also hopelessly out of their depth politically and socially too ? You are hopelessly out of depth hypocrite ! Period !
@fear_eile @EMArbTrader @GwenythWR Might is right ! Wake up ! Just look at US, UK, France, Russia and many more eg .... In any case, Taiwan is internal problems of China, any interference by outsiders will be construed as declaration of war against China. Go and revise your international relations study ! 😱
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR If US military intervene in Cross Straits conflicts, then China will have the rights of military response against US military ! Period !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Jan 2, Xi’s message to Taiwan is very clear: Either one country two system through peaceful negotiations or one country one system through non-peaceful meaning wars and bloodshed ! Taiwan’s family man and women are very clear the choices they have to make between peace or war !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Do you know what is the most troubling reality US military planners need to deal with ? China can launch endless and repeated invasion just to recover Taiwan, but USA cannot afford to come to the aid of Taiwan every single time ! That’s geo-political reality that Taiwan face !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Do you know what is the most troubling reality US military planners need to deal with ? China can launch endless and repeated invasion just to recover Taiwan, but USA cannot afford to come to the aid of Taiwan every single time ! That’s geo-political reality that Taiwan face !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR In case you are not aware; the PLA is ready to execute any order to invade Taiwan and PLA military generals are ready to prove their worth in the battlefield; if they are so order ! If USA intervene, PLA is ready to sink 2 aircraft carriers with 10,000 deaths ! This is serious !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR We really don’t Taiwan to end up like Syria and Taiwanese to end up refugees floating around South China Sea
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Jan 2, Xi’s message to Taiwan is very clear: Either one country two system through peaceful negotiations or one country one system through non-peaceful meaning wars and bloodshed ! Taiwan’s family man and women are very clear the choices they have to make between peace or war !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Don’t you know Taiwan military is preparing for guerilla warfares in the streets of Taiwan ? In other words, Taiwanese are aware that when you can’t beat the powerful Chinese military, you will try to fight them street by street: outcome ? A totally destroyed Taiwan like Syria !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR The reality is so obvious. If Taiwan is so confident of US protection, can always declare independent now ! But why are they not doing it ? Do you seriously think US as a declining power is so invincible ? Look at the reality  !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR All family man in Taiwan will not let their children end up as Taiwan refugees floating around South China Sea ! That we are very sure !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Nobody can help Taiwan if Taiwanese make the wrong decision unifying with China. That’s a reality while it may be hard to swallow; but the alternative will be far worse. fathers &amp; mothers of Taiwanese children will not choose war over peace !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR You are really twisted ! The geo-political reality towards bloodshed in Taiwan if majority of Taiwanese choose to break away ! The fact is international community do not recognise Taiwan as a country  ! The Taiwan problem is an internal matters within China !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR I pity the majority of Taiwanese if they think like you ! By all means, try different possibilities; but all ways will lead to this one outcome: either accept one country two system through peaceful negotiation or one country one system through bloodshed ! Reality is so clear !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR The majority of Taiwanese have failed to realize this reality; China under Xi no longer want to win hearts and minds in Taiwan. Their message is simple: Taiwan either accept One country two system through peaceful negotiation or one country one system through bloodshed  !!!
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Hey dumb dumb ! I am not fit enough to be a PLA soldier ! But the fact remain that if the majority of Taiwanese are dumb enough to fight China; and even if China may not be successful the first time round, do you seriously believe that China will not invade the 2nd time or more ?
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR You are really ignorant of the geo-political reality ! Anyone who care for Taiwan can see the reality so clearly ! Yet dumb and dumbest will also throw terms like “United Front” to hide your ignorance of the reality !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR This is one prospects Taiwanese need to be fully aware come 2020 elections !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR There will be proxy war at best on the land of Taiwan like Syria ! Will Taiwanese refugees / guerilla wars in the streets of Taiwan be common news terms in the future ? Is that what fathers, mothers of Taiwanese want as future for their children ?
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR If Taiwanese are ignorant of the geo-political reality in East Asia, then there will have no peace in Taiwan and Experience great sufferings in the coming years ! This what many of us hope that will not happen ! But are Taiwanese wise enough not to dig their only graves !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Exactly ! CCP is violent ! That’s how they acquire their powers ! But they also builder up and still building China into a global economic and military powers ! That is irreversible geo-political reality !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR Until and unless Taiwanese are able to become united on all major issues confronting the Island, Taiwan will be spinning around like a headless fly bumping and knocking all over the place within an increasingly hostile and difficult Geo-political international environment !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR You are wrong ! Taiwanese instability is primarily as a result of their own political infighting thereby splitting the entire Taiwan and making Taiwan unable to present an united front against any major issues confronting Taiwan !
@EMArbTrader @fear_eile @GwenythWR You are right. The fact is Taiwan without will be far worse off as we are witnessing now, both economically, politically and even militarily ! The choice is very obvious ! Either peaceful reunification or non-peaceful reunification ! Taiwanese will need to decide in 2020 !
@fear_eile @GwenythWR Hopefully, there will be a peaceful reunification of Taiwan with China, not for China's sake, but for Taiwan's sake as Taiwan's future is bright with a greater China ! The only problem is Taiwan has proven to be an unstable democracy which cannot deliver good life to Taiwanese !
@fear_eile @GwenythWR Cut your bias hypocrisies ! You mentioned all authoritarian states as if USA, UK, France ... don't use foreign scapegoat ! China do not claim India, Japan, Korea, Vietnam as being part of China. So it's messy logic to equate reunification with Taiwan as being regional threats !
@GwenythWR US military planners can always ignore Chinese threats. 	There is a Chinese saying:"If Lions don't strike back, you may think they are sick kitties !" 	There is never a doubt that Chinese will go to war(s) to reclaim Taiwan, but will US soldiers die for Taiwan's independence ?
@hijack_chien @BonnieGlaser @michaelturton No ! Bonnie is right about the use of the term "reunification" ! In the eyes of the Chinese people, Bonnie Glaser is both authoritative and credible China Political Observer !
@BonnieGlaser @michaelturton In the eyes of Chinese (Zhong Hwa) people, Bonnie Glaser is both authoritative and credible China Political Observer !
@BonnieGlaser @michaelturton Yes ! Reunification of Taiwan back to China is necessary and urgent ! Xi's sense of urgency will ensure that reunification will happen within his terms of Government. According to knowledgeable people both in Taiwan and China; China will speed up the reunification by 2024 !
@BonnieGlaser US military planners can always ignore Chinese threats. 	There is a Chinese saying:"If Lions don't strike back, you may think they are sick kitties !" 	There is never a doubt that Chinese will go to war(s) to reclaim Taiwan, but will US soldiers die for Taiwan's independence ?
@BonnieGlaser Hey Bonnie ! I thought freedom of speech is an important value that US emphasize time and again whenever you guys lecture China ! 	What a hypocrite !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin Tsai  has brought about the threats of war, destruction and suffering to the people of Taiwan ! We pray Taiwan will not end up like Syria, and There will not be Taiwanese refugees floating around South China Sea like Syrian refugees floating around  the Mediterranean Sea !
@iingwen Tsai, you have brought about the threats of war, destruction and suffering to the people of Taiwan ! We pray Taiwan will not end up like Syria, and There will not be Taiwanese refugees floating around South China Sea like Syrian refugees floating around  the Mediterranean Sea !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin Taiwan will reunify with China, either through peaceful or non-peaceful means. While Taiwan still got some bargaining powers, should try and negotiate a best deal for Taiwanese. Do not wait until China become World No. 1 economic &amp; military power. By then, it will be too late !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin That’s the problem with some Taiwanese ! To love Taiwan means do not push all Taiwanese to war and destruction ! This is really love Taiwan !
@TrentFerrington @SenTedCruz US continuing commitment to Taiwan’s security is to USA prepare to let hundreds and hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to fight and die for Taiwan Independence ? Did you ask your voters if they are prepare to let their sons and daughters die for Taiwan ?
@MPWangTingyu @SenTedCruz US continuing commitment to Taiwan’s security is to USA prepare to let hundreds and hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to fight and die for Taiwan Independence ? Did you ask your voters if they are prepare to let their sons and daughters die for Taiwan ?
@SenTedCruz US continuing commitment to Taiwan’s security is to USA prepare to let hundreds and hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to fight and die for Taiwan Independence ? Did you ask your voters if they are prepare to let their sons and daughters die for Taiwan ?
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin China is now the second largest economy in the world. Taiwanese will benefit from China's economic power !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin Susan99, you completely missed the important point - millions of Taiwanese will die if Taiwan forced China to use military option to reunite Taiwan. We love Taiwan. We do not want to see that !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin Just look at Syria. Hopefully Taiwanese will not end up like Syrian refugees ! They are really pitiful especially the young children !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin This is not about money or freedom, it’s about life or deaths of millions of Taiwanese ! Hope you guys wake up to this scary reality !
@npfoundation What happened after rejection of peaceful reunification ? War on the land of Taiwan ? This is the million dollar question !
@iingwen What happened after rejection of peaceful reunification ? War on the land of Taiwan ? This is the million dollar question !
@TaiwanPresSPOX @iingwen hWhat happened after rejection of peaceful reunification ? War on the land of Taiwan ? This is the million dollar question !
@BonnieGlaser What happened after rejection of peaceful reunification ? War on the land of Taiwan ? This is the million dollar question !
@susan9926299927 @IBMcCaslin Then what happened after rejection of peaceful reunification ? War on the land of Taiwan ? This is the million dollar question !
@BonnieGlaser If the people of Taiwan reject Beijing's one China 2 system unification attempt which is the peaceful reunification option ? Is USA prepared to send US armed forces and assets to defend Taiwan in the event of non-peaceful reunification attempts not once, but repeatedly ?

@JeffFlake This is a pivotal moment in US history; the beginning of the end for American greatness; a global power in decline, showing through the lack of fairness and indecency at the very TOP in all branches of power centres !
@leehsienloong Bravo !

@Ng_Eng_Hen A sad conclusion. In military training, men's lives are dependent on capabilities and sense of  responsibilities of their Sirs and NCOs. Those in the field must make timely life saving decision ... In this sad case, the officers and NCOs have let their men down tragically !

@realDonaldTrump This is indeed the words of a big bully ! American gangsterism at its best !
@realDonaldTrump The whole world really enjoy the open thoughts and comments of a future President of the United States of America. Spooky !
@realDonaldTrump You are definitely a BIG MOUTH US President  ! Very Unpresidential, indeed !
@realDonaldTrump Talking nonsense !
@realDonaldTrump Will the World be gloomer after 4 years of Trump Presidency ? If you start wars with China and Middle East, more sufferings
@realDonaldTrump #Unpresident Donald Trump = Make America Great Again = Dumb + Dumber !
@realDonaldTrump This is a dumb remark from a USA President ! No wonder so many around the world are looking down on USA !   #Unpresidented"
@realDonaldTrump Yes, to let American citizens die for Taiwan in a war with China is indeed an unpresident act !
@realDonaldTrump @EazyMF_E You want war with China! You are getting one now ! Many Americans are so keen to die for Taiwan ! Bring it upon !
@realDonaldTrump You want war with China ! You are getting one now ! Many Americans are so keen to die for Taiwan ! Bring it upon !
@realDonaldTrump You want to go to war with China because of Taiwan ! Looks like you have taken the first step today! Big mistakes ! Period!
