Honoring the contributions of women isn't enough. It's up to those of us in leadership to make sure every girl is given the same opportunity to seek out and pursue their dreams, and every woman is compensated fairly and afforded equal rights. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2019
This #InternationalWomensDay we remember the victories of discovery, innovations of science and humanitarian advancements that have been brought to us by great #WomenInHistory, but we also consider the many contributions from women that were never recorded or realized. #IWD2019
I'm grateful to all of the legislators working diligently to save our Southern Resident #orcas. The Senate hit a home run passing all three of our orca bills last night. Together we can give these magnificent creatures a fighting chance. #SRKW #zerospillsWA #waleg https://t.co/b4vnL5VaAS
What an honor to join @SPSAthletics206 for their Athletic Hall of Fame dinner. They’ve created the Frank Inslee Service Award to honor my dad. He loved teaching &amp; coaching students. It is fitting the first award goes another great educator, Dick Lee for his dedicated service. https://t.co/xAvvhHPQoD
And HB 1580 protects Southern Resident #orcas from noise and disturbance caused by vessels. We know vessels can impede the orcas' ability to navigate, communicate and hunt for prey. Thanks to Rep. Blake for your sponsorship. #waleg
HB 1579 will implement the recommendations of my #SRKW task force to increase the abundance of Chinook salmon so #orcas have more food. I am grateful to Rep. @joefitzgibbon for your leadership on this bill. #waleg
HB 1578 will protect WA’s natural resources from devastating #oilspills. Preserving the health of our waters, orcas and salmon is crucial to our cultural identity, fishing economy and tourism industry. I thank Rep. Lekanoff for sponsoring this important bill. #waleg #zerospillswa
We must restore our ecosystem to one that sustains orcas, salmon and the quality of life for all. Today the House made a big move toward saving Southern Resident orcas by passing all three of our #orca bills with bipartisan support. #waleg #SRKW #zerospillswa https://t.co/TMhUG7QfLw
Vaccinations are key to protecting our children and preventing the spread of disease. Thank you @WaHealthSec and @WADeptHealth for bringing the measles epidemic affecting Washingtonians to the national conversation. #vaccines #VaccinesWork #getvaccinated https://t.co/bYyiRrQI58
It's a good day when we see a bill that will prevent and treat #opioid use disorder pass unanimously in the Senate. Thanks to our Senate health leaders for this great bipartisan effort. This offers solutions across WA from our biggest cities to our most rural towns. #waleg
Despite what a small group of sheriffs would have people believe, no one can pick and choose which laws to follow. It’s very simple: WA voters overwhelmingly approved stronger background checks and gun safety measures, and dealers will be required to comply with those laws. https://t.co/Tod8pTztWb
Good work here by Sen. @Reuvencarlyle, an outstanding partner in the fight for online privacy. #waleg https://t.co/4bG3zflo8f

We had another significant #climatechange victory today as the House passed HB1112, our bill to phase down super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons. Pound for pound, #HFCs are thousands of times worse for our environment than CO2. Thanks to @JoeFitzgibbon and so many others. #waleg
SB 5116 phases out coal power and creates the strongest #cleanenergy standard in the nation. Thank you to @ReuvenCarlyle, @SenatorPalumbo and @AndyBillig for championing this bill through the Senate today and helping to put WA on a pathway to #100percentclean electricity. #waleg
I was so inspired tonight at the @SEIU1199NW Multi-Employer Training Fund’s 10th anniversary. When employers work with unions to lift the bar for training, wages, safety and professional development, they improve the lives of all working families in WA state. https://t.co/s0fW9BgmS1
Our state is leading the way on clean energy and computer science.

From the leadership level all the way down the line we're working to maximize opportunities. Two things I know: Washingtonians are always making progress, and we're never satisfied with the progress we've made. We're dedicated to improving on #DiversityandInclusion. https://t.co/pbyLY6MbIF

Members of Congress take an oath to the Constitution — not to President #Trump. Glad the U.S. House has voted to block his fake emergency and I hope senators from both sides of the aisle come together to block this outrageous abuse of power.
Reacting to preventable diseases takes time, resources and money away from the public health services needed to prevent these outbreaks. WA has already spent over $1 M responding to the current #measlesoutbreak. @WaHealthSec helps us see the big picture.	https://t.co/rYXcJZ76q8

It was a privilege to share WA’s successes with my fellow governors and our federal partners at the @NatlGovsAssoc winter meeting. #WeTheStates must continue collaborating to maintain the progress we've made and hold the Trump administration accountable.	https://t.co/Gl9UhfPYcC
I strongly support @AGOWA Ferguson challenging the Trump administration’s radical changes to #TitleX. WA will continue to stand with women and protect their right to safe and legal abortion and reproductive care. We will fight this assault on women’s health together. #NoGagRule https://t.co/ZTyK8kiH2D
We need great #teachers in our classrooms. To do that, it‘s imperative that we prioritize pay and benefits for educators. I’m proud of the investments WA has already made, resulting in double-digit increases in pay, and I’ll keep working to build on that progress. #WeTheStates https://t.co/DRML0TNnGe
Honored to share WA state’s success expanding opportunity and supporting public education with @NatlGovsAssoc. We’ve increased K-12 funding by over $9 billion, grown early learning enrollment by nearly 8,000 kids and launched @CareerConnectWA. And we’re not done yet. #WeTheStates https://t.co/9f2bgQRkXi
Denying #climate change will only lead to more devastating wildfires, worse health conditions and increased deaths — as I told @EPA Acting Administrator Wheeler and @Interior Acting Sec Bernhardt today.		Unfortunately, our partners in D.C. are asleep at the wheel. https://t.co/Q6UKfBjxXJ
We have a good working relationship with Canada and the B.C. province, where we recently reiterated our support for shifting our region to a #cleanenergy economy. Now is the time to protect our #orcas and combat #climatechange, not invest in long-term fossil fuel infrastructure.
.@EcologyWA has submitted concerns about the pipeline’s impact to our shared international waters. I continue to stand with them and urge the Canadian government to reconsider. 	https://t.co/u6Ul5OFx2j
Today the Canadian National Energy Board recommended that the #TransMountain pipeline expansion should go forward, even after they found it would be harmful to Southern Resident #orcas, increase greenhouse gas emissions and worsen global #climatechange.	https://t.co/TAx4WhcJ58
We will never allow President Trump or anyone else in D.C. to take those rights away. #TitleX #NoGagRule #StandWithPP
We stand united with @AGOWA Ferguson and our state and legislative leaders against this blatant assault on women’s health. Washington has been, and will continue to be, a state that stands with women and their right to safe and legal abortion and reproductive care. #TitleX
We are reviewing the final rule and evaluating our options. It is clear the Trump administration has given our state no choice but to explore all possible avenues, including legal options, to ensure all women have access to family planning and healthcare services. #TitleX
Trump is forcing doctors, nurses and community health centers to deny treatment referrals and fully legal medical services to their patients, whom they took an oath to serve. This is unacceptable and wrong. #NoGagRule #TitleX #StandWithPP
By denying access to Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics, more than 80,000 people in Washington could lose access to their current doctor. The president is directly interfering in the doctor-patient relationship. #StandWithPP #TitleX #NoGagRule
The president’s decision endangers tens of thousands of Washingtonians and millions of Americans. This is a radical change to #TitleX, a program with four decades of success providing affordable birth control and reproductive healthcare to patients.	https://t.co/EcauwS9UCL https://t.co/dHxccVyZ7e

Today we face another dangerous rise of nationalism and discrimination in our nation. Making immigrants and refugees “the other” is a tool of xenophobia, fear and hatred. We must fight that wherever and whenever we can. Never again can we repeat these dark mistakes of our past.
We will never forget the unjustified internment of thousands of innocent Japanese Americans on Bainbridge Island and throughout WA. They had less than a week to leave their entire lives and report to detention centers. We must ensure this never happens again, to anyone.
77 years ago the US made the wrong decision to imprison our friends and neighbors. Japanese-Americans, who, let’s be clear – were American citizens – were turned into “the other” through fear and mistrust. #DayofRemembrance 	https://t.co/BsCxtakYKk

Yep. @AmySnover at @CIG_UW tells it like it is on #climatechange. And as a longtime leader in the scientific community she knows what she's talking about. Bottom line: we must reduce net greenhouse gases to ZERO. But there’s enormous opportunity in doing so. https://t.co/wKbtu3zvbi
This declaration doesn’t do a single thing to make our nation safer. All it does is further divide Americans, erode our system of checks and balances and advance the president’s agenda of fear and misinformation. We should all be outraged by this president’s abuse of power.
There was a time when Republicans and Democrats sat at the table to discuss comprehensive #immigrationreform. Those discussions have given way to unilateral and reprehensible actions that separate families, imprison children and launch tear-gas at exhausted mothers and families.
President #Trump’s declaration is an alarming and legally dubious attempt to sidestep the constitutional authority granted to Congress, the co-equal branch of government where debates on immigration reform and #bordersecurity are held in the light of day.	https://t.co/pCq1ltOWpc https://t.co/Jlc7UPn6YU
We stand united today out of love for our families and children, and in dedication to pursuing commonsense #gunsafety measures that we know save lives. I’m proud to join our state's youth, @AGOWA, @WaGunResponsib and the people of WA to say #NotOneMore and #EnoughIsEnough.
WA has acted boldly before — expanding background checks, banning bump stocks, boosting suicide prevention strategies, implementing protective orders to keep firearms out of the hands of people in crisis and more. But our work is far from done.
More than 1,200 people have lost their lives to gun violence in the 12 months since the #Parkland shooting. Our nation’s youth have risen loudly to demand action, and we remain resolute in doing our part to keep our communities and children safe from the scourge of #gunviolence. https://t.co/ouGviJrN7a

Now it’s up to the U.S. House to finish the job. I look forward to working with my friend and colleague @SenatorCantwell, and our entire delegation, in getting this done for the beautiful #publiclands across our state. #SaveLWCF
I'm grateful for the bipartisan work of @RepNewhouse and @RepKimSchrier to secure funding for the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan in the #PublicLands package. As an issue I've worked on since serving Yakima Valley in Congress in '94, I know this is huge for the people of Central WA.
All Washingtonians will benefit from the permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This program has invested nearly $700 M in over 600 projects in WA state over its 50 year history, protecting our natural resources and promoting our quality of life. #LWCF

The actions of the president, his administration and his family speak louder than mere words. The #StateoftheUnion is strong because of the millions who do the right thing every day and put the interests of their families and communities above personal gain and empty rhetoric.
He will work across the aisle to pass comprehensive #immigrationreform. He will protect people’s #healthcare, not undermine it. He will stop using federal workers as political pawns and not compound their economic insecurity by threatening another #governmentshutdown. #SOTU
Our country deserves better from its leaders. The president’s words tonight ring hollow. If the president really wants to promote a strong union, he will stop vilifying our free press and individuals who dare to disagree with him. He will take bold action to fight #climatechange.

Today #waleg took the first step to achieving #100percentclean electricity in Washington state. Thank you to Sen. @reuvencarlyle and the Senate Environment, Energy &amp; Technology committee for moving this bill forward and passing the Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act.
Helping more juvenile salmon survive the journey to the ocean is one of many steps we want to take to protect and restore salmon. Our hope is this will also support the recovery and sustained health of our orcas. This is an important short-term action we can take now. #SRKW #orca
To help salmon migrate, @EcologyWA proposes spilling more water over the federal lower Columbia and Snake river dams. We can do this in a way that preserves power generation but helps improve fish migration so that Southern Resident orcas have more food.	https://t.co/AEjeLFptvT

Clark County is now reporting 30 cases of measles. Because measles is contagious before people realize they are sick, those who are not vaccinated may spread the disease without knowing. @WADeptHealth urges everyone to check their records to verify that they are immunized.
Federal workers need long-term security to do their jobs and keep the public safe. Shutdowns are not a negotiating tactic — period. Federal workers and their families should never be held hostage to the president’s whims. #Trumpshutdown
There is simply no excuse for shutting down the government, inflicting pain on 800,000 public servants and threatening basic services for millions of Americans. Reopening the government temporarily is an important step, but we cannot allow this to happen again in three weeks.
This reckless #Trumpshutdown should have never happened. It was irresponsible, damaging to our economy and needlessly harmful to working families in every corner of our country. We all know the shutdown was never about border security.	https://t.co/ssMYfeaeFO https://t.co/GGiiVEqf9t
Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be fatal in small children. Almost everyone who is not immune will get measles if they are exposed to the virus. 26 confirmed cases in our state creates an extreme public health risk that may quickly spread.	https://t.co/c0T0W1huqa
We will take care of Washingtonians, even if the president won’t. All federal workers who are affected by the #TrumpShutdown can now apply for unemployment benefits through @ESDwaWorks.	https://t.co/1EH1ZHlR70
Thousands of federal workers in WA are missing their second paycheck today due to the #TrumpShutdown. Our state has their back. 2,280 furloughed workers have filed for unemployment benefits, and in under 24 hrs, we’ve helped over 130 who remain on the job file for benefits.
WA state will not stand by while our public servants work day after day while struggling to make ends meet. It is unconscionable that the president is turning public servants into his political pawns. @ESDwaWorks has benefits available now. #TrumpShutdown	https://t.co/8ltIJBWnDy

Dr. King’s dream for America isn’t fully a reality, but that’s why we’re here today. We will continue to combat racism, prejudice and discrimination at every level. And we will carry his humanity forward. #MLKDay #MartinLutherKingJrDay
We are not in a post-racial America. The wage gap still persists for blacks, incarceration still disproportionately impacts African Americans, and buying a house, a car, paying for tuition or starting a business is still difficult due to unjust credit availability practices.
As we spend #MLKDay honoring those who paved the way for us on a road that was not easy, a road that included police dogs, batons, church bombings and assassinations, we must realize that we are not yet in a post-racial America. We still have much more work to do. #getinvolved
I was so inspired on Friday listening to @MichaelEDyson speak about the vision created by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the determination we need to muster as a nation to protect it.

It will take collective efforts of businesses like @Microsoft, combined with non-profits and government, to tackle homelessness in our region. That is why my budget includes $262 M to get people housed now and build more affordable housing for the future.

A citizenship question would risk billions of dollars in federal funding and adequate representation in Congress. Our courts agree and the states challenging this effort, including WA, will keep standing up to ensure a fair and complete #2020Census count.	https://t.co/KMZSdsaJGD

So let this be our profound story. Let it be bold. And most of all, let it make history. #waleg
We’re the people who always make history. I really believe in the state of Washington. And I believe our next Washington chapter must show that we pushed the limit and moved beyond our plateau, that we always looked for the next beginning. #waleg
We affirm that diversity is a strength, not a weakness. #waleg
All this builds toward our promise for greatness. We’re constantly refreshed with new ideas, new cultures, new communities and new technologies. We seek out new talent from the world’s many pockets because that makes Washington stronger.  #waleg
While too many in D.C. remain in the grips of the NRA, we're the state that stands up for common-sense gun-safety reforms. We've closed background check loopholes, banned bump stocks, and approved protective orders that keep guns away from people in crisis. #waleg
We’re the state that invests in our people. That’s why we’re the only state that ranks as the best place to work and the best place to do business. What an incredible achievement. #waleg
We did this because a student’s financial challenges should not stand in the way of the pursuit of their dreams. #waleg
We’re also supporting future students who want more education but can’t afford it. The Washington College Promise is our new statewide free college program that guarantees state financial aid to eligible students. #waleg
My budget will provide 100,000 students over the next 10 years an option to dive into their interests through apprenticeships and paid internships, and fall in love with a career before they graduate. #waleg
For high-school students or individuals who seek an experience outside a four-year program, our #CareerConnectWA initiative gives them that option. It links students to real-world experience in careers that interest them. #waleg
And once those children reach the other end of their education and prepare to graduate from high school, we want to open up as many pathways as possible, including apprenticeships, certificates and degrees. #waleg
My budget would also offer universal home visits. This gives every new parent the opportunity to get a visit from a nurse during the first few weeks back home with their newborn to share important information and build confidence. #waleg
But we have always said we couldn’t stop at basic education. For anyone who cares about equity in education, early learning is the best way to secure a strong start for every child, regardless of their family’s economic circumstances. #waleg
This was an enormously heavy lift that I’m proud we accomplished together last year. This was a remarkable bipartisan effort; both parties shared in that success. #waleg
The fourth issue, one still at the forefront, is education. I thank everyone in this chamber who has been part of the years-long effort to fully fund basic education. #waleg
The demise of any species is a warning in our natural systems. We have to restore the balance of our ecosystem to sustain orcas, salmon and the quality of life for all Washingtonians. For as the orca go, so go we. #waleg
We must make unprecedented investments to save our orcas. We have just one last chance to save these orcas. In this perilous moment, we must answer back with action. #waleg
The third thing we need to focus on is saving the Southern Resident orcas. Many of us watched as Tahlequah, a mother orca, carried her dead calf for at least 17 days. We saw a mother’s grief. We felt it. Our hearts broke as we shared in her loss. This cannot be their fate. #waleg
I’m pleased that we’re at the beginning of a bipartisan effort to do just that. We will create a story this year about a holistic model for behavioral health that encompasses the family, the community, and the promise of timely care. #waleg
We need to transform behavioral health from a system that responds to crisis to one that helps people before they reach crisis. #waleg
We’ll phase down super-pollutants and phase in cleaner fuels. Combined, these policies will steeply cut emissions — the equivalent of taking about 3 million cars off our roads. #waleg
I am more optimistic than ever about the clean energy future we’ll build together. We'll pass legislation to transition to 100% clean electricity, transform our buildings with cost-saving efficiencies, &amp; modernize &amp; electrify our transportation system. #waleg
As Washington’s leaders, we carry an obligation to never be satisfied with how far we’ve come. In 2019, we are again poised to be more and do more. Yes, we’ve accomplished much already. But all of it — everything we’ve done — brings us to a tipping point. #waleg
And today, as we reflect on our 2018 successes, we look ahead to 2019 and offer a rallying cry to build this new and enduring chapter that is the profound story of Washington state. #waleg
We gather in a place that tells much of our Washington story. Today, we come together from across the state — from the rolling hills of the Palouse to the coastal rocks of La Push — to find inspiration for the work we do. #waleg

Here is a list that details some of the most significant impacts to Washington state programs and services that may be disrupted or delayed by the shutdown. https://t.co/0TWuxWreOg
The president’s destructive rhetoric is making negotiations harder, not easier. And his insistence on this shutdown shows he puts his own political interests above the interests of the nation. This record-long shutdown has to end.
Students applying for financial aid await the approval they need so they can register for classes. Emergency food supplies for food pantries &amp; meal systems will be disrupted. The likelihood of ferry disruptions is growing with the prospect of missed U.S. Coast Guard inspections.
These workers, many of them veterans, will once again try to sleep tonight with the insecurity of not knowing when their next paycheck is coming or how they will be able to pay their mortgages or rent. Meanwhile, the impacts of this shutdown are starting to feel real.
Today, hundreds of thousands of federal workers – including nearly 13,000 Washingtonians – are not receiving their paychecks because President Trump continues to hold them and the families they serve hostage while he pushes for a useless border wall.

.@IAGovernor Reynolds and I have a fun wager on the game. If the Cougs win, Iowa's Vande Rose Farms and Lynch Family Foundation will donate pork to the Thurston County Food Bank. If the Cyclones win, we'll send a feast of @IvarsClam clam chowder to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank.
Trudi and I will be cheering for @WSUCougFB in the #AlamoBowl tonight. A triumph over the Iowa State University Cyclones would make this the most victorious season in Washington State University football history. #GoCougs

Donald Trump may not have to deal with the consequences of his capricious and selfish government shutdown, but we the people do. Washingtonians and all Americans deserve better.
This is not about border security. This is about a man who puts the opinions of a few ultra-far-right cable news commentators above the good of the nation he was elected to serve.
But our state should not be left responsible for continuing important services that are a federal responsibility — including programs such as food inspection, sexual assault and domestic violence prevention, crime victim support and basic food assistance for families across WA.
Because of Donald Trump, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed or forced to work without pay over the holidays. Fortunately, in Washington state, we will be able to minimize impacts to state programs and services in the short-term.
He has divided families and traumatized children, sowed xenophobia and division throughout the nation, and for the third time this year will force a shutdown of the federal government that will have real consequences for millions of families this holiday season.
The president has doubled down on a temper tantrum of epic proportions. The level of disruption and destruction he has wrought with his fixation on building a useless wall is staggering. 	https://t.co/YS1cGmwxmi https://t.co/VsV9uQ9Qe9

@climatesolution WA already has some of the cleanest electricity in the nation, but we are at a critical juncture to replace retiring coal plants with clean energy. We can absolutely make the transition to 100% clean electricity by 2045 or sooner. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution We are fighting the Trump administration’s roll-back of clean energy and environmental protections at every turn. We are proposing common-sense policies at the state level to make significant progress on these issues in the absence of federal leadership. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution We're electrifying freeways. We have the electric bus capital of America – Wenatchee. We are building solar farms in Lind and Kittitas Co. We are spinning carbon fiber for electric cars in Moses Lake. We’re building batteries in Mukilteo. We’re producing biofuels in Grays Harbor.
@climatesolution I issued an executive order to create the first economy-wide cap on carbon in the nation. We have the greatest percentage of electric vehicles in our state fleet. We adopted a renewable portfolio standard that created a $ billion industry. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown No scientific illiteracy can slow us down. We are the most innovative, entrepreneurial state in the country, and this is in our wheelhouse – to lead in the development of a clean energy economy. We can act at home in Olympia. I invite people to help us. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown The good news is that Trump cannot stop Washington state from seizing our own destiny and controlling our own carbon pollution. We are a free state, free to enact the carbon reduction plan that I have proposed this year. No tweets can stop us. #ActonclimatePNW
@climatesolution Unfortunately, these are things I was aware of ten years ago. And for over a decade people have dithered when it was time for action. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution Several pieces stand out to me. It shows that streams will be too warm to support salmon, low snow pack and spring run-off will harm our agricultural heritage and the continuing acidification of our marine waters will make it harder to recover Puget Sound. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution People are now experiencing climate change in their personal lives. It means ash on the hood of their cars, more floods and more dead forests. They’re tired of pollution and want to make sure that their grandchildren can enjoy the natural beauty of our state. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution What we heard is that voters want WA to take action against #climatechange, as is evident by the fact that they sent ten new democratic legislators to the state capitol, all of whom are dedicated to fighting climate change. Washingtonians want action. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown My climate package consists of multiple tools that represent multi-pronged, robust, comprehensive and effective measures. This action agenda touches all parts of the problem. It will result in thousands of new jobs in the state of Washington. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown The number one thing is to pass my climate bills. This package was designed to put states on a pathway to cleaner electricity, a more energy efficient economy and an electrified transportation sector, which is our largest source of emissions. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown When these measure are in place, WA will have the cleanest transportation sector in America by providing totally clean electricity to power clean cars, buses and ferries. #actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown This package includes:	1. 100% clean electrical grid	2. Clean transportation fuel standard	3. Elimination of super-pollutants (a.k.a HFCs)	4. Clean buildings	5. Robust support for electrification of our transportation system		#actonclimatePNW
@climatesolution @OregonGovBrown For 2019, I’m introducing a comprehensive package of legislation that together will reduce emissions from electricity, buildings and transportation to shrink WA emissions to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035. #actonclimatePNW	https://t.co/kd7Zegoxa7

It is now up to states to fortify workers through strong overtime protections. We consistently rank as one of the top economies in the country as well as the best state for workers. We know a strong economy goes hand-in-hand with a strong and well-supported workforce.
It's time to modernize overtime rules for workers. After decades of stagnant wages, we can grow paychecks for thousands of Washingtonians and create new jobs. If employers don’t want to pay overtime wages, they can either raise salaries or hire more people to handle the workload.
Washington state is stepping up to protect workers where the federal government has not. Updating our decades-old overtime rule is one sensible step towards helping more workers share in our economic prosperity. https://t.co/p0yV35bgbV

The planet is on pace to warm 7° F, according to the Trump admin's own proposal. Rolling back fuel efficiency standards now, and preventing states from going farther, is an abdication of leadership and a surrender to special interests. @EPA @NHTSAgov https://t.co/t7ZAekn1A6 https://t.co/CedcPsxsss
The foothold of hate and fear of ‘the other’ will not take root here. We will use the full force of our voices, our votes and our state rights to defend the people and values that have made Washington, and the United States, a beacon for people around the world.
In this darkness we must remember that America is resilient. In Washington state we can be confident we live in a place that will continue to welcome, value and stand up for the rights of people of all faiths, all orientations and all nationalities.
But we are all linked in a human destiny whose survival depends on a rejection of the politics that feed on fear of ‘the other.’ The politics that revel in the loss and suffering of others must be rejected. The more we love, the less we will lose.
We are not all members of the Jewish community, a community subjected to centuries of persecution. We are not all transgender. We are not all Muslim. We are not all African-American. We are not all Hispanic. We are not all survivors of sexual assault.
It is the clear and compelling duty of all in public life to call forth the better angels of our nature that Lincoln summoned, to seek our commonalities rather than our divisions, and to speak out against those who do otherwise.
It is not enough now for any one of us, particularly our national leaders, to disavow these forces. Neutrality is complicity. It is dangerous to deny the link between hateful rhetoric and the hateful violence now afflicting our country.
We have had many dark chapters in our nation’s history where forces of xenophobia, bigotry, racism, misogyny and nationalism were able to gain a foothold. Once again we find ourselves in the midst of another dark chapter.
We need leaders who speak against fear, not use it.
The president’s answer – to arm our teachers, to arm our synagogues – is wildly contrary to the task of building the community we seek. We don’t need our leaders calling on us to be armed, we need our leaders to ask us to open our arms to one another.
The attack in Pittsburgh yesterday was an attack on all Americans, as were the pipe bomb attacks on those who have stood up against the endless venom and division coming from our nation’s capitol.
This is a difficult and anxious time for anyone in our nation who doesn’t look, love or worship like the majority.
Our hearts are with the victims, their families and the brave first responders. We should all be shaken by this act and resolved to stand together in denouncing all forms of hate and violence.
I’m sickened by the tragedy in Pittsburgh. Centuries of hatred toward the Jewish community is a toxic stain on our culture. These assaults are all too common and we must not accept this as normal.

Today @secstatewa Wyman and I talked about elections security ahead of the midterm elections. Washington is widely considered to have one of the more secure elections systems in the nation, in part because our mail-in balloting means the state has a paper record for every vote.

There’s little in the universe that didn’t interest him. Trudi and I join people all over the world in sending our thoughts to Paul Allen’s family and friends. https://t.co/Mzs8qBC2TA
Paul was a person who pushed so many intellectual envelopes and expanded human knowledge, and his legacy will live beyond bricks and mortar. In so many ways Paul Allen personified Washington state - innovative, caring and always willing to fight for equal rights for all.
Paul Allen stands as a giant in Washington history for the genius vision that was so important to creating Microsoft with Bill Gates. That he went on to do so much more for our state, nation and the world puts him in rarefied company.
The president says exporting coal from naval bases is a matter of national security. Our own military says climate change is the real threat to national security. Our naval bases are not shipping ports for private coal, and Trump cannot ignore our health, safety and enviro laws. https://t.co/efO7Ba0qXA
The men and women who serve at our military bases are there to keep our country safe, not to service an export facility for private fossil fuel companies.
The Trump Administration has put out a reckless, hair-brained proposal that undermines national security instead of increasing it, and it undermines states’ rights to enforce necessary health, safety and environmental protections in our communities. 	https://t.co/qTitVy1GDP

Congratulations to everyone who worked to get Washington's newest 529 college savings program #DreamAhead off the ground. We're fortunate to have one of the best higher ed systems in the nation, but paying for children to go to college can be the biggest burden a family can face. https://t.co/ZCAHdwyvJh

Climate change causes extreme conditions – which lead to extreme wildfires.	https://t.co/PMmuL8htSm
These are facts:	• Climate change is altering Washington's annual weather.	• These changes bring less snow and both hotter and drier summers.	• This stresses our forests, making them more likely to burn.	• Which will cause more devastating wildfires.	https://t.co/Yo4puO8Kbd

Trudi and I were delighted to donate 150 pounds of apples and pears from the Inslee trees at our home on Bainbridge to Helpline House. This non-profit has been helping those in need of food, support and services since the 60’s. We’re happy to share our harvest. https://t.co/CSCZLHH9J0

Unions have been at the forefront of major economic and social justice reforms including the 40-hour work week, life-saving safety standards and minimum wage. Happy Labor Day to you and your family.
Washington state is proof that a strong economy goes hand-in-hand with a union-strong workforce. On this Labor Day, thank you to the men and women who have fought — and continue to fight — for safe and fair work conditions that benefit us all.
Our wildland firefighters will be working hard this holiday weekend to protect our state. Please be careful over #LaborDayWeekend and learn what you can do to prevent wildfires: https://t.co/ceFrI5CGnI https://t.co/pBnd44eTHw

Today I've directed Washington state agencies to lower flags in memory of Senator John McCain. Flags should remain at half-staff until sunset on Sept. 2 to align with his memorial services.
Trudi and I send our deepest condolences to Senator McCain’s family. His legacy will be among the most enduring of our time.
The nation today said good-bye to one of its greatest heroes. Senator John McCain was a man who rightfully commanded the respect and admiration of every American, regardless of party or politics. He was a leader who served with unquestionable and unwavering love for his country.

Our teachers should be focused on teaching, our students should be focused on learning, and our elected leaders should be focused on fixing gun violence — not escalating it. https://t.co/r7tnpasBAK
Education funding should be used for education. Most of our schools are already under-resourced, and pitting the need for new textbooks, classroom supplies and improved STEM programs against the purchase of new pistols is a debate that doesn’t deserve a minute of our time.
I cannot believe we’ve reached a point in time where our national leaders’ response to the deadly scourge of gun violence in America is to put more guns in schools and ask our hard-working educators to take on the additional roles of security guard and SWAT officer.
Trump’s Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is considering using federal education funds to purchase guns and provide firearm training for educators who work in the classroom. I call on Secretary DeVos to abandon this wildly dangerous proposal immediately.	https://t.co/K8nFxj6CIr https://t.co/ZfNHIiptF0

State Rep. Matt Shea’s comment should disqualify him from serving the #waleg public records task force. There is no excuse for condoning such ill-informed and radical rhetoric from the House GOP caucus chair. We must protect #freepress and freedom of speech.

With wildfire smoke back in many communities across our state, here are some helpful tips to help you stay healthy and minimize the impact. https://t.co/ulUFJSfFk6
The Trump administration’s plan is out of touch with the realities of the people grappling with persistent poverty in this country. It’s imperative for the White House to allow states like Washington to continue our many efforts to move people toward upward economic mobility.
The president has put forth an executive order proposing rigid work restrictions that would make it difficult for struggling Washington families to get back on their feet. His approach will actually make it harder for people to gain economic stability. https://t.co/E88nyKQhv1
There have been times in my career when I disagreed with a news organization.	But, at no time have I considered media an enemy – not an enemy of mine and certainly not an enemy of the people. An attack on #freepress is an attack on our democracy. https://t.co/DFXFUHUSSd
Reporters and news staff are members of our communities. As @thecolumbian points out, these are people "who shop at the same stores as their readers, who attend the same churches and who send their children to the same schools." https://t.co/OPKlPePhtK
President Trump should look to one of his predecessors, a Republican, who was tough enough to take criticism without resorting to anti-democratic attacks. Theodore Roosevelt said disallowing criticism of the president was "morally treasonable to the American public." https://t.co/dd5gwKDOfY

All of us in Washington state consider our hometown airlines @AlaskaAir and Horizon Air like family. I encourage anyone having a tough time to reach out to mental health services for support.
I would also like to acknowledge the air traffic controllers who helped prevent further tragedy in the incident of the stolen Horizon Air plane. They kept calm under intense stress and pressure.
I want to thank the Air National Guard from Washington and Oregon for scrambling jets to keep Washingtonians safe. Those pilots are trained for moments like tonight and showed they are ready and capable.
There are still a lot of unknowns surrounding tonight's tragic incident of a stolen Horizon Airline plane. The responding fighter pilots flew alongside the aircraft and were ready to do whatever was needed to protect us, but in the end the man flying the stolen plane crashed.

Firefighters are often exposed to toxic chemicals while responding to fires. Washington is the first state to ban toxic flame retardants in household products, and this year I signed a bill to ban firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals, which have been linked to cancer.

The recent, tragic death of the orca calf is heartbreaking and we all feel the pain of the mother and her pod. Protecting and restoring the complex ecosystem these beautiful animals rely on will take a lot of work. There are no do-overs with the orcas. We must get this right. https://t.co/t9tLDZhGdV
This action goes beyond negligence and failure to protect our environment. It is an outright assault on our state’s ability to protect the people of WA from the devastating effects of climate change and pollution. We are prepared to go to court to stop this illegal action.
Emission standards have a proven benefit for everyone, and gutting them will create significant health risks and place an unfair burden on those who breathe air pollution and cannot afford to move away from it.
Tailpipe emissions are a significant contributor to greenhouse gases. The reckless actions of this administration threaten the health and safety of our residents, jeopardize progress in the fight against climate change, and will result in higher costs and dirtier skies.
.@AGOWA Ferguson and I will not stand idly by while this administration attempts to dismantle these critical protections in our fight against climate change. The State of Washington will take all necessary action to preserve our rights to regulate emissions.
The Trump administration wants to roll back clean car emission standards that have contributed to healthier people, cleaner air and lower gas costs. https://t.co/r0PMjETZbx

The Trump Administration has given our state no choice but to explore all possible avenues, including legal options, to block this gag rule policy from harming the women of Washington. #NoGagRule #StandWithPP https://t.co/WjplokmGHB
If the Trump gag rule is finalized as written, and cannot be blocked in court, we would be left with no choice but to refuse to participate in an unethical Title X program.
It is nothing more than a domestic gag rule that has no place in Washington’s medical facilities.
There is no doubt the Trump Administration’s damaging proposal would weaponize the Title X program, undermine women’s health, and deny patients comprehensive, medically accurate information about their medical care. https://t.co/ahW9xXUghN https://t.co/P4BHq3nPNM

We cannot trust that these families will actually be reunified. Today I led a group of six governors in demanding @HHSGov &amp; @DHSgov take responsibility for the dire effects of the "zero-tolerance policy" and trauma inflicted on nearly 3,000 children. https://t.co/OaFfqOCdz2
If true, this interpretation blatantly ignores the terms of the court order. The federal government has also recently admitted that reunification is being used as a bargaining chip to induce parents to agree to voluntary deportation.
My office recently learned the shocking revelation from @HHSGov that reunification could mean placing a separated child with ANY long-term sponsor — regardless of whether it’s their parents, other family in the US, family back in their home country or in long-term foster care.
When another governor asked me why I told Scott Pruitt that his actions were morally reprehensible, I replied, "because they are morally reprehensible." Unfortunately, we cannot count on any substantive improvement at EPA. It's a Trump show.
And thanks to the immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers who met with me later in the day to share their harrowing stories of survival. On the day we celebrate our nation’s birth, let’s remain resolute in providing a safe haven for families fleeing danger from around the world. https://t.co/Tx0kW3GvDQ

While in today's ruling the Court expressly overruled Korematsu, this decision violates the spirit of that reversal and replaces one profoundly bad decision with another. https://t.co/atcGq9Hqab #NoMuslimBan
The Court has used 'national security' to affirm policies like the internment of Japanese Americans, as in the Korematsu case, a shameful error in judgment that catered to the popular bigotry of the day and hurt so many people under a facade of national security.
Today’s decision will hurt families and individuals and goes against our nation’s history and constitutional protections against discrimination. It also reinforces anti-Muslim animus.
It is abhorrent that, in a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the president’s Muslim ban, apparently turning a blind eye to the president’s own words and our country’s constitutional protections against discrimination.
Cruel, unconscionable and unconstitutional – those are just some of the words that come to mind when I watch the White House scramble to justify its horrific new policies at our southern border.
I appreciate the partnership of leaders like @AGOWA, @NWIRP and @ACLU_WA who are all working hard to ensure these cruel policies are stopped and families are reunited. https://t.co/gNcL5XoHmT

As I said last year, we must ensure that all Washingtonians are counted. It's how we ensure that our state has the resources and representation we need to serve our residents for not only the next decade, but for many years to come. https://t.co/iF0pKz3LBM
Between underfunding the 2020 Census and making changes that will suppress participation by already-underrepresented populations, it’s clear this administration is trying to sabotage a critical tool for making informed policy decisions and ensuring fair representation.
Trudi and I will be holding Nancy and George’s families and friends in our hearts in the days to come.
Our friend Nancy Biery gave a voice and inspiration to so many who sought to make their community and state a better place. She served the public working with Gov. Locke and Sen. Cantwell, and was a force in her community on the Olympic Peninsula.
From our days at Ingraham High School, our friend George Sparling was one of the brightest lights in the Ingraham community, and went on to serving young people and helping them shape the inspiring future they deserved.
Trudi and I have lost two important teammates in the last few days.

Thank you for your work on this Doug https://t.co/vXZh4ozCOw
Thank you again to Reps. Goodman, Hayes, Sens. Frockt, Pedersen and all those involved in tonight’s passage.
My belief is, and I heard from many tonight, that this should be the beginning of ongoing meaningful dialogue to keep this conversation moving forward toward a safer Washington for all.
I met with many from these groups earlier tonight and thanked them for coming together and working hard to finding true compromise. Tonight’s passage avoids politicization of an emotional issue, and I hope will bring meaningful change, progress and healing.
During this legislative session, De-Escalate Washington, many in the law enforcement community, and a bipartisan group of legislators came together to make tremendous progress on an issue that has divided so many communities across our country.
De-Escalate Washington overcame the odds and brought this initiative to the legislature, and I want to thank them for bringing a voice that many felt had gone unheard for too long.
Tonight’s actions regarding I-940 are incredibly meaningful examples of what happens when people choose to open their mind, to listen and to compromise. #waleg

You can read my veto message and letters from legislators here: https://t.co/nUfD1c2FFa
I appreciate that both sides have been open to discussions during the past few days and will work together to find the right approach to this important issue.
However, that was before I saw the process which failed to meet public expectations for openness and delivered a bill that fell short.
Though I expressed concerns about the outline of the bill, I did tell legislators I would let the bill become law if they delivered it with enough votes to override a veto.
I believe the Legislature’s overwhelming vote on the bill was a good faith attempt to increase disclosure and transparency.
Those messages were heard loudly and clearly. I now hope lawmakers, the media, and other stakeholders will work together to resolve differences through a process the public can have faith in.
I want to thank the legislators who have reconsidered this bill and asked me for this veto tonight. Since this bill passed, my office and lawmakers have heard an unprecedented level of response from the public.
I believe legislators will find they can fulfill their duties while being fully transparent, just like state and local governments all across Washington.
The public’s right to government information is one we hold dearly in Washington. Transparency is a cornerstone of a democratic government, and I’m very proud of my administration’s record on public disclosure.

"That’s why Washington state recently joined an amicus brief arguing that our states benefit when we have strong unions and our workers are not striking.

We still have work to do in reaching agreement on a final budget. The state Supreme Court has made it clear we must take the last step in meeting our obligation to fully fund basic education this year.
The House budget also makes some smart investments in K-12 and higher education, and calls for reducing property taxes across the state.

If we are serious about honoring the 17 lives lost in Parkland, we will take action to keep our children, our homes and our communities safer.
Elected leaders need to do more than grieve. They need to take action. We are not doing nearly enough to regulate access to weapons designed to cause mass casualties. We can do better if we chose to do better.
Our nation’s families and communities are grieving from the loss and fear of yet another school shooting, the 18th shooting in only seven weeks. Washington state extends our deepest sympathies to the victims’ families and friends in Parkland.
I hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty.

There has been growing, bipartisan support for ending Washington’s death penalty, and the Senate today voted to do just that. I would like to thank Sens. Maureen Walsh and @Reuvencarlyle, and @AGOWA, who have been great allies in the fight to end the death penalty in our state.

His $1.5 trillion plan expects state, local and private partners to pick up more than 85 percent of the tab. States cannot and should not bear the burden of building a 21st century infrastructure system on our own. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/4zWfx93irx
The president’s plan, unfortunately, abandons the federal government’s responsibility. His plan would essentially throw states a few Legos when what we really need is concrete and steel.
On a bipartisan basis, our state enacted the largest and greenest transportation package in state history in 2015 to make sure our roads, bridges, railways, ferries and transit systems can support our growing communities and economy.
Meaningfully investing in safe and reliable infrastructure is a national imperative, and our state is more than doing its fair share.
From wildfires to smaller fruit, climate change is a clear and present threat. We're already seeing a lot of great leadership on everything from electric buses to solar powered EV charging, and I'm excited about what the future holds.

While this process has demonstrated that this particular project is wrong for this particular proposed location, I am confident that our ports will continue to play an important role in regional trade and in providing opportunities for jobs in clean energy.
Several issues compelled this decision, including seismic risks, the inability to sufficiently mitigate oil spill risks, and the potential safety risks of a fire or explosion. EFSEC has determined it is not possible to adequately mitigate the risks to an acceptable level.

Their delay in passing the capital budget comes with many costs, monetary and otherwise.
It’s extremely unfortunate and, frankly, irresponsible, that for nearly a year Republicans stalled those projects and refused to vote on the $4.2 billion capital budget.
The Legislature also approved a Hirst fix. I appreciate that the complexity of this issue required several months of negotiations by many legislators.
This allows us to restart hundreds of stalled projects at schools and mental health facilities and build more affordable housing - as well as put thousands of Washingtonians to work.

I expect every employee in every one of my state agencies to understand this as well. In this time of fear and uncertainty, our families are counting on us.
I understand what’s at stake in getting this right, and the ramifications of what it means when we get it wrong.
I will support legislative efforts to further support immigrant and refugee families, including HB 2308, proposed legislation that will help provide resources for at-risk Dreamers.
My commitment to helping all Washington families thrive and be safe from discrimination is stronger than ever. Washington’s state agencies will not be used to help tear loving families apart or intimidate targeted populations.
It is clear that under the Trump Administration, ICE and other federal immigration authorities are operating with very different – and destructive – intentions than in recent years. Our policies and practices must be adapted to reflect that terrible reality.
DOL will not turn over personal information for immigration-related investigations to federal immigration authorities without a court order signed by a federal judge or magistrate or under the requirement of state or federal law.
Working with my office, DOL today announced important immediate actions that will ensure a stronger, clearer policy moving forward. https://t.co/0ddzCpoADN
DOL fell short in meeting those expectations, and for that I apologize.
It has angered me. I issued an executive order nearly one year ago saying we would do all we could to protect Washington’s immigrants and refugees from blatantly discriminatory enforcement and deportation efforts.
The recent revelations about our state Department of Licensing’s failure to safeguard certain information from federal immigration officials has shaken and angered many communities.
Losing state heroes like broadcasting icon Keith Jackson, director Frank Buxton, and philanthropist Floyd Jones this week is tough. Our state honors their unique contributions to their fields.
This offshore drilling proposal is a serious threat to one of our state's greatest assets, and we will continue to fight it as long as it takes.
We stand ready to provide any additional information about our coastline's pristine natural beauty and the economic backbone it provides for our communities.
Secretary Zinke did not provide that commitment, unfortunately. But this fight is far from over. We will continue advocating for Washington to be removed from the plan.
I spoke by phone today with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and reiterated my opposition to his offshore oil drilling proposal. I told him the concerns of Washingtonians and West Coast residents deserve be treated with the same consideration and deliberation as those in Florida.
The executive order I issued last year was a commitment to ensure we’re protecting Washingtonians from discriminatory immigration enforcement efforts. We must and will do better. Washington has been and will always be a welcoming place, for all people.
I want to be clear that we will redouble our efforts to ensure that state agencies are not assisting discriminatory enforcement efforts by federal immigration officials.

We are here in Olympia to serve the current and future interests of all Washingtonians, and I thank each of you for your willingness to find solutions to the challenges we face.
This is the year for us to do our part, for all who will walk in the path we will make, together.
This is the year to believe in ourselves. This is the year to act with confidence.
We have succeeded in aerospace, in software, in online commerce, in coffee, in biotechnology, and there is every reason to believe we will succeed in fighting climate change and growing our economy in the process.
Repeatedly, over the decades, we have lived up to Governor Ferry's charge "to mark the way."
We know we are smart enough to recognize the perils of climate change, and we know we are innovative enough to do something about it.
We have been given an incredible bounty of natural beauty and sustenance, and we now must ask ourselves how we can protect that bounty for future generations.
But the things we treasure individually can only be saved collectively. #ActOnClimate #WAStateOfTheState
Every single one of is deeply tied to Washington in our own way. We each have a part of this state that we love: a favorite fishing spot, a quiet place on the farm, that campground in the forest.
It is true: Our Creator practiced on the rest of the planet, and then created Washington state.
Washington is home to the most beautiful collection of fertile wheat fields, towering forests and salty waters on Earth.
And is it right that we do this.
The Alliance represents 40 percent of the United States economy, and if we were our own nation, we would have the third-largest economy in the world.
Already, Washington has joined with 14 other states and territories to form the U.S. Climate Alliance, and we are committed to meeting our share of the emission reduction targets outlined in the Paris Climate Accord. #ActOnClimate #WAStateOfTheState https://t.co/9QBftttDx5
Even if the White House walks away from the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will walk forward and join this battle for the world's healthy future.
Our state is home to the inventors of biofuels that have powered the Boeing 787 across the oceans. It is our state's destiny – because of who we are – to defeat climate change.
Mukilteo is home to the inventors and manufacturers of the world's largest vanadium flow battery. Moses Lake is home to one of the world's largest carbon fiber manufacturing plants for electric cars.
In the Pacific Coast region, clean-energy jobs have grown more than twice as fast as jobs in the overall economy.
Washington employs some of the most influential climate scientists in the world. Our universities and businesses are on the cutting edge of clean-energy technologies.
These clean-energy jobs belong here. Not just in China. Not just in Germany. Not just in B.C.
This is who we are. We create, we invent, we build. And the people of Washington are ready to create, invent, and build the carbon-free future our children and grandchildren deserve.
I believe that Washington is exactly the right state to lead the clean-energy economy and seize the jobs that China and other nations are clamoring for.
By passing a carbon tax, we would simply join our West Coast neighbors, and the rest of the world, as the global economy moves away from fossil fuels and toward a decarbonized, clean-energy future.
From Quebec to Japan, from Europe to Mexico, many states and nations have enacted a price on carbon. Even China is getting on board, having recently launched the largest carbon market on the planet.
Carbon pricing is hardly a new or bold idea. British Columbia, our neighbor to the north, is doing it. To the south, California is doing it, and Oregon is considering it.
I am optimistic about this year, and that optimism is well justified by Washington's can-do spirit of confidence and innovation. And why shouldn't we get this done?
And by doing these things, we can save our forests. We can help our rural economies. We can protect our waterways.
We can make much-needed upgrades to our irrigation and water-management systems. We can prepare our workforce for new careers in clean-energy.
We can reduce the wildfire risk in rural communities and on tribal lands. We can improve utility services and modernize the electrical grid.
We can help more Washingtonians purchase energy-saving insulation for their homes and businesses.
Doing so will allow us to reinvest in all the things that drive down emissions. We can build more solar panels. We can put more electric cars on the road.
We are joined across geography, across age, and across political interests. Now is the time to join in action and put a price on carbon pollution. #ActOnClimate #WAStateOfTheState
House and Senate members also have been working closely with my office all summer and fall to design a Washington-focused approach, and their contributions have been key.
They all agree that putting a price on carbon this year is the right thing to do, and have committed to working with me to get that accomplished.
Labor leaders see the job potential in growing our clean energy economy. Our environmental leaders and tribes see the urgency of acting now to curb carbon pollution.
Support for enacting a price on carbon is growing. Members of the business, tribal, environmental, and labor communities from across our state are coming to the table to talk about carbon pricing.
And there is no partisan divide. Nationally respected Democrats and Republicans are among those calling for a tax on carbon pollution.
There is no age divide. The young child suffering from asthma is just as vulnerable as a grandparent suffering from COPD, a lung disease aggravated by heat and air pollution.
Because on this issue, there is no geographic divide. The Eastern Washington farmer whose irrigation supply is threatened by low snowpack faces the same crisis as the Western Washington shellfish grower whose baby oysters are threatened by ocean acidification.
We must be victorious over climate change, because, as Winston Churchill said, "...without victory, there is no survival." https://t.co/m3ZSJgiwqV
We have allowed the unfettered release of carbon pollution into our air. That burden will be carried by our children, our economy, our security, and our quality of life.
We have just 59 days to do our part to save our children from an endless cycle of crop-killing droughts one year, and rivers spilling their banks the next. To save salmon from dying in ever warming rivers, and our forests from being reduced to plumes of ash.
While this session is short, our legacy on climate change must be long and lasting.
It is time to step up and give our citizens what they demand and deserve – and what is the law – which is a fight against climate change and the damaging health effects of carbon pollution.
#waleg recognized this threat a decade ago when it pledged to the people of Washington that we would make our air cleaner and reduce carbon pollution. But unless we act this year, that promise will be broken.
That existential threat is climate change. #ActonClimate #WAStateOfTheState
And now we must recognize an existential threat to the health of our state, a threat to the health of our children, and a threat to the health of our businesses that demands action this year.
When I came into office, there was doubt we could invest seven billion dollars in education. But we did.
When I came into office, there was doubt we could pass a transportation package. But we did, and it is the largest and greenest transportation package in state history.
And we should be proud of the great progress we have made together in state government.
Washington state has so much to be proud of. Our biotech companies are creating new treatments for cancer. Scientists at Hanford have helped confirm the existence of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein. We even make world-famous beer and wine.
We will not be intimidated. #WAStateOfTheState
We will fight to protect Washingtonians' health care, women's right to choose, the right for people to be safe from discrimination, and the right to clean air and water.
The world should know that we are going to keep standing up for civility, tolerance, and liberty. https://t.co/3JdkPT5JCO
Despite the onslaught of divisiveness, disorder and disrespect coming from the White House this past year, the people of our state have stood proudly together.
As we gather to do the people's work this session, Washington's values and this Legislature's actions will be more important than ever.
If you want to help rural Washington — if you want more affordable housing, better mental health care and school construction — then do something about it and send this capital budget to my desk now.
It would help us build more affordable housing and expand capacity in our mental health care system. This funding is languishing at exactly the same time the need for these projects is exploding. https://t.co/x9jMnf2GB7
This budget supports more than 19,000 construction jobs in every corner of the state.
And let's make sure we don't leave a legacy of irresponsible brinksmanship. It is absolutely crucial that we pass a capital budget as one of the first orders of business this session.
Let's leave, at long last, a legacy that upholds the equal application of justice by passing a bill to end the death penalty in the state of Washington.
We can continue our commitment to public safety and health by banning bump stocks, closing the background check loophole on semi-automatic rifles, and requiring the safe storage of firearms.
Let's leave a legacy of common-sense measures that help end the scourge of gun violence.
Let's pass legislation now to ensure the availability of College Bound scholarships for Dreamers, even if the federal government fails to renew their deferred-action status.
Let's continue our bipartisan legacy of helping Dreamers fulfill their potential. This is a time of great uncertainty and fear for our Dreamers and their families.
This is a persistent challenge that intersects our efforts to end homelessness, to improve our criminal justice system, and to combat an opioid epidemic that kills an average of two Washingtonians each day.
This session, let's leave a legacy of compassion by continuing our work on behavioral health care.
Let's expand that opportunity, as well as apprenticeship programs for our veterans and other Washingtonians, in the coming years.
It was a joy last year to celebrate our state's first 15 registered youth apprentices as they prepared to launch rewarding careers in aerospace. https://t.co/l33qEJ5eKg
There is no reason our own students cannot have better access to those same opportunities here in Washington.
During a study mission to Switzerland last year, our Washington delegation saw a truly remarkable apprenticeship system stemming from a robust partnership with business, labor, and academia. https://t.co/aO9hDcRU8t
Let's leave a legacy of opportunity for all our students by expanding career-connected learning. #CareerConnectWA
We have got to stop telling our children that a four-year degree is the only path to success. That simply is not true.
It is crucial that we implement the McCleary plan now, because a child is only a third grader once and they don't get that year back.
The Supreme Court has made it clear that the plan needs to start one year earlier, and fortunately, we have the reserves to be able to do that.
I want to commend Senators John Braun and Christine Rolfes, Representatives Pat Sullivan, Timm Ormsby, and David Taylor, and so many others who have helped achieve this bipartisan success. https://t.co/NCcTlpV4T6
This session, let's also continue our outstanding legacy on education. Legislators can take pride that they passed a plan that will fully comply with the McCleary decision.
Let's all — elected leaders and employers alike — commit to inclusive workplaces where everyone is safe from sexual harassment and assault. This is one of the most persistent wrongs that our society must make right.
This work includes access to long-acting reversible contraception and reproductive parity.
At a time when women's health care rights are under attack throughout our nation, let's leave a legacy that ensures full access to contraception and allows women to chart their own course.
When Washington, D.C., takes away that protection, we must protect #NetNeutrality for our people, for our businesses, and for the virtues of free speech. https://t.co/NY6sWGCB25
And speaking of a stronger democracy, let's leave a legacy that supports our modern democracy — and our modern economy — by ensuring equal access to the internet.
It is time to pass the Washington Voting Rights Act, automatic voter registration, and Election Day registration.
Access to democracy is a cornerstone to the enduring health of our nation and our state, so let's leave a legacy of a stronger democracy by increasing voter participation and equitable representation.
This year we cannot focus just on the length of this session, which is short. We have a duty to focus on our legacy, which can be long. Several opportunities are in front of us to forge a prosperous path for the next generation.
We have been walking in that path that Governor Ferry and the first Legislature set for this state 128 years ago. Today, it is up to us to continue that work for future generations.
“It is your province,” he said, “to make precedents, not to follow them; to mark the way, that others may walk in the path which you have made.”
When our state's first governor, Elisha Ferry, delivered his message to our inaugural Legislature, he challenged legislators to think big. https://t.co/9iPQ2QDPfh
Our economy is strong. Our future is bright. But there are always new heights to reach, new challenges to overcome, and persistent wrongs to right.
We have invested in our people. That's why our state has one of the country's fastest-growing economies, why it was named the Top State for Business, and why statewide unemployment is at a historic low.
The minimum wage was raised for Washington's workers, and last year, we passed the best paid family leave program in the nation. https://t.co/PpIgcOrHsD
Because of the work we have done together in the past five years, our state has made crucial investments in our schools and colleges, our highways and transit systems, and our health care system.
I am honored to stand before you once again to report on the state of Washington state.
I welcome the new legislators in your ranks, Senator Manka Dhingra, Senator Keith Wagoner, and Representative Carolyn Eslick. #WAStateOfTheState https://t.co/nUi9vmNrv9

I ask all Washingtonians to join me and Trudi in holding in our hearts Deputy McCartney’s family, the men and women at the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department who serve alongside Deputy McCartney, and all those who serve in law enforcement across our state.
His bravery is is echoed across Washington every day, as our law enforcement officers run towards the danger in service of making Washington a safer place.
Deputy Daniel A. McCartney was serving and protecting his community, responding to a burglary call when the suspects reportedly opened fire and murdered him.
Early this morning Pierce County lost one of their finest in the line of duty. Trudi and I are saddened and praying for the deputy’s young family as they grieve the loss of their husband and father.

Crews have made commendable progress on restoring I-5 and I ask that travelers continue to be patient as they complete opening of the lanes.
I want to be clear there are still many unanswered questions about how and why this incident occurred. I have confidence the NTSB’s investigation will provide those answers.
There are several entities responsible for fully implementing PTC in Washington state and Mr. Anderson committed that Amtrak would seek to make PTC operational statewide on its trains as soon as possible and before the December 31, 2018 federal deadline.
I also asked how Amtrak can work with its railroad partners to expedite the implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC).
This is a significant commitment and I appreciate that he has offered this support early and unequivocally.
Those costs include all the medical and incidental expenses incurred by those injured and their families, the clean-up and repair of the roadway, and the restoration of passenger rail service.
This response, however, does not come without financial costs. Mr. Anderson committed to me during our call that Amtrak will pay for the costs of the derailment.
The swift response to this tragedy has been the result of cooperation from all the involved jurisdictions. The priority has been on taking care of those on board the train and restoring access to I-5 as soon as safely possible.
Earlier today, Transportation Secretary Roger Millar and I spoke with Richard Anderson, President and Co-CEO of Amtrak, regarding the tragic train derailment in DuPont.
Thank you to everyone who is working so hard to get these lanes of Interstate 5 reopened. I strongly urge motorists traveling on the reopened lanes tonight to observe the lower speed limit and to use caution. #Amtrak501 https://t.co/JaGDwX7PO0

This bill also would result in hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians losing health coverage. I urge Congress not to pass this ill-conceived legislation.
The tax plan before Congress is a terrible deal for Washington state. At a time of economic inequality in our nation, we must not increase taxes on many working families or blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the federal budget just to help the wealthiest Americans and corporations. https://t.co/plPfLdGz8d

The Trump Administration and Congress instead must work with states to build on our progress expanding health care access and affordability.
Today's order follows the directive earlier this week to take away birth control coverage from millions of Americans.
He is undermining protections for the middle-class and those with preexisting conditions, making coverage more expensive with fewer benefits
With today's executive order, the president continues to sabotage our health care system.

It's painfully clear that the hatred and bigotry in #Charlottesville came from the side with white supremacists marching with Nazi flags.
And we will not tolerate hate in any form, anywhere, in the United States of America.
We can not let anyone stoke racism for political gain. We can’t ignore an attack on our people.
But speaking out against this hate is not enough. Our actions as a nation in response to racist, nationalist bigotry will speak louder.
It is on all of us, from me, to you, and all the way to the President, to denounce and decry the horror we’ve seen today in Virginia.
We know that all Washingtonians who believe in freedom, peace, and justice for all will do the same.

This is the moment. Now is the time. Let's fully fund education this year. https://t.co/rHXTZUmJVu #waleg #wagov
So let’s go get this job done.
The best thing we can do in service to our children and our state this year is to fully fund the education system they deserve.
But when it comes to our kids, let’s start this session with a shared commitment to all and excuses to none.
We may vigorously debate about the way forward on funding education.
We will keep fighting to protect the 750,000 Washingtonians who finally have health insurance, thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion.
https://t.co/B1XF9cvqC0

We will not turn our back on the progress we have made. Our commitment to equal rights and human dignity will not be diminished.
No matter what happens in that Washington, here in this Washington, we will not forget who we are.
We’re here because we believe that when we live up to our expectations, when we adhere to our values - there is no better place than WA.
I can tell you from my personal experience that people are ready for us to solve this.
Just as we set high expectations for our students, we should set high expectations for ourselves.
If it were easy, someone else would have already done this. But you know what? It won’t be any easier next year, or the year after that.
I recognize the Legislature has some hard lifting to do. Nobody should minimize what we’re doing here.
Kids are only 5 years old once in their lives. If we don’t do this for them now, they don’t get a redo.
We can’t make progress for just some of our children. We must make progress for all our children. It is long past time to do what’s right.
Imagine students learning skills that employers tell us they need right now, getting a path to a good job straight from high school.
Imagine mentoring programs that help teachers starting out in their careers. Half of teachers leave within 5 years. We can fix that.
Imagine more students graduating because we have social workers, nurses and counselors who can help our kids cross the finish line.
Imagine closing the opportunity gap in our state by making sure at-risk kids have the extra teaching and mentoring time.
Imagine what fully funding education will mean. Imagine schools that can recruit and keep great teachers with competitive salaries.
We’ll have the resources needed to fully fund K-12 education, and working families will pay less in property taxes.
In exchange we’ll ask a small percentage of the wealthiest Washingtonians to pay a little more on gains from their investments.
My budget starts by lowering property taxes for three out of four Washington households and businesses. https://t.co/14cT1XsSaE
So here’s what I propose: We aren’t raising anyone’s property taxes.
We simply need more resources in our K-12 system if we want all our children to graduate with a meaningful education.
That’s why I propose funding for these career-connected opportunities from elementary school through high school graduation. It works.
We are going to stop telling our kids that a four-year degree is the only path to success.
At Yakima Valley Skills Center, students told me how a career-connected training gave a future they never saw in a traditional classroom. https://t.co/wXdNoLhlF6
In Kent, I visited Phoenix Academy and heard about the services needed for student success whether it’s food for lunch or a tutor for math. https://t.co/lgIP6KynWD

I’m proposing a route to the summit based on what I’ve seen work as I’ve visited schools around the state.
We will not arrive on the summit by chance. This is something we must make happen.
And we have a Washingtonian here today who can inspire us - the first American to summit Mount Everest in 1963 - Jim Whittaker. https://t.co/0NdbLDCARK
We’ve climbed high enough to see the summit. We’re almost there.
We’re almost there. We’ve added more than $4.6 billion to our schools, and tackled all-day kindergarten and student transportation. https://t.co/LozLsYOv5R
The journey to fully fund education in our state has been like climbing a mountain. And we’ve been climbing together for a long, long time. https://t.co/BRdX6OCGfR
We should choose to build on the enduring foundation of Washington - the intellectual light of our children.
Every one of these things is important. But none of these issues is more important than fully funding the K-12 education our kids deserve.
We need to continue conversations on issues like the use of deadly force, paid family leave, serving veterans, and capital punishment.
We need to invest in more affordable housing and support services for the chronically homeless, looking at root causes such as opioids. https://t.co/3MO9KU9COo
We need to transform our mental health system to one that is patient-centered, community-based and prevention-focused.
I know there are many issues in front of us this session, not just funding for kindergarten through 12th grade education.
And now it’s time to go even further to secure the prosperous future we want for our kids and for our state.
We all demonstrated a strong commitment to our principles and a recognition that compromise is necessary for our mutual success.
We worked together to give hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians health care - a healthier Washington is a more prosperous Washington. https://t.co/QY3z7A8HIG
We worked together to make historic investments in early learning. https://t.co/HlFi06OXtS
We worked together to pass a historic transportation package that builds, repairs and improves infrastructure in every corner of our state. https://t.co/7oldMLT94b
We worked together to give all aspiring Washingtonians access to college, regardless of where they may have been born. https://t.co/UNsTYslIGF
We’re no stranger to working through hard challenges. We’ve done hard things together in the past four years.
There’s nothing more essential to that future than acting to fulfill our top priority - fully funding education, this year.
As leaders of our state, we’re entrusted with the unique opportunity to work together for a strong and secure future of Washington.
