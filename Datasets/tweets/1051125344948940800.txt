@chelseahandler Learn dingbat...		DEFINITION: 	An indictment is a criminal accusation that a person has committed a crime.
@Comey How can a FBI director be arrogant and not able to answer 250 questions asked by congress because of memory lapses ? You're a POS Comey.
@Cernovich Stopped following you. Later
@Tim_McManus It will be historic on how many points the Birds will lose by tonight
@howardeskin @SportsRadioWIP We'll lose by 28.
@SenatorCollins @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC Resign Senator.
@nypost 4.6% obscene? Try paying 19.7% on a car while home mortgage at 12.4% during my early years of the 1980s.  Dude, you have ZERO clue.
@RealGlenMacnow Add a shot or two of whiskey to your coffee.  It'll help with dealing with the Flyers.
@JonahNRO Cops protect cops; priests protect priests and media protects media. Kristol is a pompous jerk.
@NRO Feel bad for all the folks over there except for Kristol. He's an arrogant know it all clown.
@guypbenson Seems you're describing @billkristol
@Mediaite Don't believe her. Can't be the 1st time in her life she said something like this.
@greta @dougducey @cindymccain You are wrong.
@BillKristol I feel badly for your staff. As for you .... IMHO U R A Pompous AZZ.

@imrahd @TheViewFromLL2 Clinton Settles Jones Suit / He'll pay $850,000 -- but admits no guilt		https://t.co/GRMEJ4P2n8
@TheViewFromLL2 Bill Clinton had Paula Jones "Sign a NDA" agreement for $800,000 "while" he was in office as POTUS. No problem with the Democrats in Congress, Media or his supporters.
@HowardKurtz Media is at WAR with Trump and most if not all MSM hate his guts.  Good for POTUS.
@SenatorCollins Retire Senator
@johnrobertsFox @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Folks he'll meet in prison do not like rats. Just saying. His lawyer should know better than to put his client at risk. FYI, even in Club Feds they have folks with the kind of mentality.
@94wippen @SportsRadioWIP Ranks #15 starting after week 4. 		https://t.co/bcy6UoZDiX
@CNN CNN at its greatest ... the #fakenews Giants.
@94wippen @SportsRadioWIP This year .... at best in the middle of the pack. He's 1/2 of what he was last year. Maybe it's the coaching, line, his injury or his preparation.... he is NOT the same QB he was last year. Let's hope he's back next year.
@jaketapper amazes me you and CNN had Stormy and her mouth piece on for over a year yet CRICKETS ON THIS ...		https://t.co/GFd2ejmQ1f
@DailyCaller No
@thehill The broad is an idiot.
@PHLEaglesNation @rd32_era Played like a champion? Are you guys on drugs? The team is 6-7 and has played dreadful from the 1st preseason game through and including yesterday.
@MSNBC @MichaelAvenatti and this woman. Only the best on MSNBC. 😆
@jaketapper And this guy along with the media really want Americans to believe this man is not biased and is fair. Really?
@MBarkannNBCS Eagles team has been terrible starting in pre-season thru and including today.

@RealGlenMacnow Wentz is terrible
@cj_wentz you're not taking care of business. In other words, your game is terrible.
Wentz is terrible
#FlyEaglesFly	The birds suck. They're terrible. Put a fork in em, they're dead.
@MarcFarzetta Wentz sucks
@TomSteyer They're protesting the tax jackazz. Nothing to do with unions.
@JamesAGagliano @GreggJarrett You and the MSM have something in common. If you don't agree with Fox, attack attack attack. 95% of media is liberal so go attack the 5%.
@juliamacfarlane @KDKWife @dbongino @POTUS Dumb as a stump.
@gehrig38 @mchooyah Dirty Dizen is a MUST on any top ten .....
@Ocasio2018 Piss you off and you'll get the FBI, DOJ, CIA up your ass.  Not cool to threaten a taxpayer with your new power dipshit.
@yashar Tillerson takes shot at Trump. MSM loves it and bitches at Trump (like you do) when Trump responds.
@thehill She's cute, good looking and great legs.  Those diplomats from the Middle East and Pacific Rim will fall in love. 😂
@jaketapper 14 days in Prison. What a waste of freckin money. BTW Jake, it would be incorrect to refer to him as a felon. He's not. (For future reference)
@freedom_moates @RealMattCouch Men are men, women are women.
@brandondarby Great article, they nailed it.
@JoeConchaTV Fred's Tavern in Stone Harbor?
@Eagles Last year we won the Super Bowl. This year we suck eggs.
@yashar @GOPChairwoman Yashar, do you ever make wise cracks towards the Dems as you do with the GOP?
@HillaryClinton Didn't you get your azz kicked in those same states? https://t.co/d2LZKbVHix
@DanRather I refer to you as "Mr D-Bag".  Just thought you'd like to know.
@jenny_adkins @washingtonpost Who says?
@washingtonpost How do you know he didn't pray it in his mind? I do every Sunday.
@Judgenap can you make us a promise? If Mueller DOES NOT INDICT Trump Jr, will you please retire?
@WayneDupreeShow Judge Nap should retire from Fox.
@secupp Hey Cupp your hatred 4 DJT blinds accomplishments: 	ISIS almost gone; taxes cut; economy is doing great; GDP up; oil reserves making USA #1 exporter;  NAFTA, EU, South Korea new trade deals; selling arms to Ukraine; New laws to protect healthcare for our veterans etc....
@benshapiro Apology accepted,  yet to think you tweeted this on the day of POTUS Bush being honored by Americans says a lot about your lack of character. Big reason folks have little faith and respect for the media.

@hughhewitt @JeffFlake Resign today Senator. You are a disgrace. Go home and sulk.
@yashar Really? Like Trump's picks won't be approved in January with a more friendly Republican senate? Give us a break Yashar, the nominees ar only delayed.
@MeetThePress @ktumulty Yet you are making this funeral about Trump by talking about it. You'd be out of a job if it wasn't for Trump. What else would you complain about?
@newrepublic @HeerJeet You are wrong. I'm a big Trump guy. I have no problems with criticism of POTUS. I do have a problem of 24/7/365 bashing by the media including Kristol/WS.
@thehill Really? Such BS from TheHill.
@yashar Media and Elected officials block more and more folks while being front runners for free speech. Kinda weird isn't it?
@d_manwest @MSNBC @davidaxelrod @davidaxelrod had his comment yet your comment makes sense too.
@HallieJackson @NBCNews @davidaxelrod tweeted: 		Seems like the inscrutable Mueller faked out a breathless media by defying hype and revealing as little of substance as possible in Flynn sentencing memo.
@MSNBC @davidaxelrod tweeted: 		Seems like the inscrutable Mueller faked out a breathless media by defying hype and revealing as little of substance as possible in Flynn sentencing memo.

@robreiner You are definitely a meathead.
@Mediaite Really? Who gives a damn?
@d_manwest @ericswalwell My kids are grown, now I have grandkids. They're great!
@d_manwest @ericswalwell Again, my complaint was towards Swalwell. His intention was to tweet a story that called Trump Jr a liar. NPR corrected while the congressman DID NOT. Why didn't the congressman correct his tweet?
@d_manwest @ericswalwell My tweet was towards Swalwell who tweets a story which was INCORRECT yet failed to admit his mistake.
@d_manwest @ericswalwell French is a Never Trumper. He's right. Read how the MSM gets it wrong yet again. BTW, hope you have a great weekend. 		https://t.co/qkUCrzm40h
@KrisParonto God Bless you Chris!
@ericswalwell NPR story was #fakenews. They retracted it,  yet you have not. Why?
@Jeff_McLane @LesBowen He'll play 20 minutes and get injured. My sad prediction.
@CBSNews Kaepernick would have burned it. Proud of our military and God Bless.

@thehill @GloriaBorger Last year also reported (told by SEVERAL sources) Comey would testify to congress he NEVER told Trump on 3 occasions he wasn't under investigation. How did that turn out?
@washingtonpost WTF? The WH is in America and NOT Europe.
@mschlapp @JeffFlake one of the saddest Senators in the history of our great country. One month left with his crybaby antics.
@d_manwest @yashar One man, not even a US Citizen. A WaPo reporter which journalists believe we should go to war with the Saudi crown over. Life as we know it should change forever with the Middle East due to the arrogance of media pundits. The End.
@d_manwest @yashar Own it. He is not god.
@d_manwest @yashar Yesterday's news and I'm right. No one cares. It's the holidays, friends, family joy and the only folks who care are the media who raised this guy into Mt Olympus as a god.
@ABCPolitics Send her and the kids back. Illegal is illegal.
@TomArnold @douglaskarr @katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand GFU Tommy boy.
@yashar No one except MSM and pundits out of the 320+ million Americans give a hoot regarding this guy. It's not a big story to us. 7+billion on our planet and you in MSM put this guy on the same level as Jesus.
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons GFY Senator and resign today.
@washingtonpost Over 310,000,000 Americans probably don't give a hoot about Germany. We care about our jobs, families and safety. It's that simple. 		Only journalists and political pundits give a rats azz.
@nypost https://t.co/018KOICZmS
@PreetBharara @yashar DNC/Hillary pays over $10 million to law firm, FusionGPS, Steele for Russian dirt on Trump is perfectly ok with MSM ..... can you please explain this with a straight face?
@Comey You leaked via your buddy/friend to the NYT. https://t.co/G1Q0v1hAhv

@Ocasio2018 What would the cost be associated with these 5,000 caseworkers? Travel expenses, hotel, food, computers, office, staff, wages, rent etc...
@d_manwest @GlennThrush Fox News = 1 outlet. 		PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, CBS, ABC, NBC, WaPo, NYT, and the thousands of other left wing organizations way way way outnumber Fox yet why are you guys so afraid of Fox?
@GlennThrush Surprised you and your MSM buddies haven't ripped Trump for starting this conflict yet.  I'll give you guys 10 days until you blame Trump for this.
@dcexaminer Who cares??
@VanityFair Wonder what Joes kids think about this?
@JonahNRO The media will blame this on Trump. Watch and see.  MSM has their idea, you guys in the Never Trump group have your idea... and the two of you in unison will rip Trump.
@JawsCEOQB This team is worst than the 1976 Eagles team at 4-10 and you guys didn't come off a Super Bowl from 1975.
@RealDGunnNBCS Birds put up 34 on the Giants 1st meeting.  We have 31 points to go to match the Giants surpass their Game 1 stats.
@thehill Tell Adam Schitt to go screw himself.
@RealDGunnNBCS I miss 2017 so so so so very much. 😭
@Ike58Reese Offense sucks. We suck. We really suck. We suck really bad. If you're not able to read between the lines .... WE ARE NOT GOOD.
@JClarkNBCS Birds ran 10 plays after 20 minutes of football. We suck.
@RealGlenMacnow Will it really matter? We suck. We really suck. We suck really bad. If you're not able to read between the lines .... WE ARE NOT GOOD.
@davidfrum @daveweigel Amazing the left hasn't discussed this fact ... why not David? 		https://t.co/OblGALeWZF
@FrankLuntz Hey Frank! You're included and the trust in your polls and opinions also are questionable by us too.
@mreeseeagles What was the Birds excuse the first 8 games before the injuries in the secondary?
@d_manwest @kenvogel Oops... I was, thanks!	 	Hope u had a great t-day
@d_manwest @kenvogel Have nothing to do with Trump. Everything to do with illegal immigration. When did it become vogue to break the law with immigration? My folks came here after WWII "legally".
@CNN 1 of 13,000,000 .... would expected better odds.
@kenvogel Yep, here we go again. Hillary 98% victory prediction. When will you guys stop waking up each and every morning writing anti-trump articles/tweets?
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Same shit another day with Joe.
@JClarkNBCS @JawsCEOQB @Eagles @Ike58Reese @NBCSPhilly @NBCPhiladelphia @AO1Foundation @NFLMatchup @72TraThomas @MarcFarzetta You're making great assumptions here. This eagle team actually sucks. I love the birds since I was 7. This team is not good. And let's not forget they have the Rams and Houston left, Two "L's".
@Comey Really? You leaked info via a friend to NYT on Trump and NOW you have a problem with leaks? 😂
@RealDGunnNBCS I'm thankful for the 2017 Eagles and NOT the 2018 team. 😂
@FrankLuntz 2017 Philadelphia Eagles and NOT the 2018 team. 😉
@TMZ Really? This is breaking news? You guys are sad. Really sad.
@senatemajldr Back at ya Senator
@mmckinnon Forget the belt today 😉
@DanRather There is a God and he made sure you were and never will be POTUS.
@Comey Dude it's Turkey day. You can't keep your trap shut and not be political at least one freckin day a year?
@HillaryClinton Did you test this tweet with a focus group?
@yashar Yashar, can you please explain how this guy is still on Twitter and other social media platforms? https://t.co/EMpefFBkuq
@axios Banned the suspects? Really?  These folks will be hung within 30 days. WTF???
@MeetThePress @neal_katyal Trump isn't the 1st POTUS and not the last to have a beef with the Judicial Branch.  Take a chill pill dude.
@yashar I keep forgetting that our US MSM keeps telling us that Turkey's President is a loving and kindest dude towards his media and political opponents. A real great guy. 😂
@ABCPolitics Orders? My-O-My don't they understand the US Constitution and the separation of powers? 		I would think the great MSM understands this principle which has governed our great country for over 2 centuries and not challenged the congress on their "orders".
@RealDGunnNBCS What are the Eagles excuses for their terrible play/record the first 8 games with a mostly healthy D backfield?
@RealDGunnNBCS Bree's made more than a few throws whiched destroyed the Birds D.

@markknoller @IvankaTrump @HillaryClinton The Ivanka Trump email situation is EXACTLY like Hillary Clinton’s, except for the unsecured server, classified information, destruction of 30,000 subpoenaed records, bleaching the hard drives, then smashing them all with hammers.
@Mediaite The Ivanka Trump email situation is EXACTLY like Hillary Clinton’s, except for the unsecured server, classified information, destruction of 30,000 subpoenaed records, bleaching the hard drives, then smashing them all with hammers.

@maggieNYT @JenniferJJacobs Did Ivanka destroy 33,000 emails? Destroy a server? Destroy cell phones? Not turn over her professional emails until two years leaving office? Be honest Maggie and please answer.
@jaketapper @farhip @whca For years CNN showcased this wing ding as the second coming of the academy awards. Red carpet, paparazzi pictures, wives in $5k dresses with diamond earrings/necklaces.
@thehill The only folks who care about this non-US journalist are the MSM and their propaganda pundits.
@thehill If it weren't for daddy, no one would know who she is and wouldn't have a TV gig.
@yashar McRaven was on Hillary's short VP list. He is not political neutral.  Trump is a counter puncher and the MSM cannot stand it. MSM backs each and every person who takes a shot at Trump.
@ABCPolitics Messy? Some would say "rigged".
@NateSilver538 @_Drew_McCoy_ Nate had Hillary winning over 300 electoral votes. Which prediction was horrible to say the least.
@michelleisawolf @whca Michelle who???? 😂
@Jeff_McLane If Falcons scored on last play of game #1, the Birds would be 3-7.
Johnny Cash --		"I cherish all of the freedoms we have including burning the flag, but I also have the right to bear arms so if you burn my flag I'll shoot you!"🇺🇸🇺🇸

@RepAdamSchiff Adam Schitt and Crying Martha ..... what a duo 😂
@ZBerm Back up center blew his block big time on that play.
@CNN Roast the press corps? Really? How many jokes did last years bimbo comedian say roasting the press corps other than Fox?
@JClarkNBCS @JawsCEOQB @Ike58Reese @NBCSPhilly @ZBerm @TonyBrunoShow @NFLMatchup @EliotShorrParks John, this team is terrible. If Atlanta connected on the last play of the game, Birds would be 3-7. We're this freckin bad. This team reminds me of the 1972 Birds 2-11-1 season. We're that bad.
@CNN The name is Schitt, with 2 T's.
@RepAdamSchiff That's Schitt with 2 T's.
@1776Stonewall That's Schitt with 2 T's
@yashar Schitt with a double "T".
@d_manwest @secupp @Mediaite A civil exchange with a republican eagles fan from  deep blue South Jersey  ..... there is a God!
@nytpolitics Two concessions from same candidate for the same election. PRICELESS !
@d_manwest @secupp @Mediaite I don't watch Fox 24/7.  I may watch an hour a day here and there. And if they do report 24/7, shame on them.
@perlmutations Who are you?
@d_manwest @secupp @Mediaite True, they did talk about emails and other stories a lot. But not like 24/7/365 Trump on MSNBC, CNN and other media outlets.  It's nonstop with Trump.
@MediaBuzzFNC @MoElleithee Finally a sane statement.
@KirstenPowers These folks hate white people yet it doesn't make their fellow ethnic human beings racists. Yet all Trump supporters and white people are racist? https://t.co/seqhpIKXTU
@MediaBuzzFNC I stopped watching Wallace over a year ago. I for one don't really care for his opinions.
@KirstenPowers Kirsten stated as fact/opinion the 62,984,828 hard working tax paying US Americans who voted for Trump are racists.
@Jeff_McLane Birds lose by 13 and call it a gift. I love em yet this year they're terrible.
@MaxBoot @RepSwalwell Yet another conservative principle down the drain for the Never Trump pundits.
@dcexaminer So far with her liberal rulings, she gets a C-grade from me.
@bethreinhard @daveweigel Felons should vote. They paid their dues. They work. They pay taxes. They have families. My 2 cents.
@RealGlenMacnow Birds put up 28 on the Giants in last 7 minutes with DJax punt return to win with no time left;		Pats Hail Mary failure to seal SB win;		Mo Cheeks dunk v Lakers game 4 1983 NBA finals with a smile		Bobby Clark OT goal game 2 Final v Bruins
@36westbrook Birds will lose by 13
@secupp @Mediaite If Trump wasn't POTUS, what in the world would YOU and/or CNN would talk about 24/7?
@bopinion - 71 dead	- Over 1,000 missing	- 12,263 structures destroyed		This is happening right now in America.		But if you follow BO Opinion you haven't even heard of this.		They don't care about Americans, just petty bullshit like Acosta.
@davidfrum Whenever a MSM pundit needs an article, bash Trump.  It's good for a few days until the next one.
@GeraldoRivera Why is entering the USA illegally ok with Geraldo and most MSM pundits? When did it become vogue?
@howardeskin @cj_wentz @SportsRadioWIP No matter what you say to make this game interesting, the Birds will get tarred and feathered in this game.
@marklevinshow More folks care about this lion than the 500 murders in Chicago. Put your capital and save human life in Chicago.
@jaketapper Did you ever fink on the official who lied to you, re: Comey testimony in front on congress that he never told Trump 3 times he wasn't under investigation? If not, why not?
@CBSNews CBS buys this BS. Sad
@MichaelAvenatti Innocent until proven guilty is what I believe you, Kavanaugh or anyone in our system is. 	#capisce
@HowardKurtz Police Blue Wall ..... Catholic Church hiding bad priests and now Fox defending @Acosta .  Sad.
@NYMag Where the hell is @RonanFarrow on this? All women are to be believed, unless of course you accuse @MichaelAvenatti then you're a lying turd.
@d_manwest @secupp @realDonaldTrump Kinda yet big difference. Trump was a TV star with tens of millions of viewers. @MichaelAvenatti was a nobody which CNN/MSNBC/MSM turned him into a star.
@secupp CNN/MSNBC/View and rest of MSM turned this bozo into a star! He appeared over 100 times on CNN/MSNBC .... he's your guy, live with him.

@SRuhle you once said @MichaelAvenatti could teach the Dems a thing or two. How about Felonious battery of a wife? Can he teach the MSM/Dems a think or two on this subject? BTW, crickets by you &amp; MSNBC on this story. Why?
@Isikoff The MSM/Dems will spin this in his favor. His ex-wife isn't part of the #metoo movement and shouldn't be believed. Watch and see how you guys will spin this.
@NBCSPhilly @StevenJung Take the Saints. The birds SUCK. It makes me sad to say, yet my beloved Eagles are very bad this year. They're underperforming over paid terrible team. Period. Maybe next year.
@JeffFlake resign today dickhead.
@Eagles Birds are done. Put a fork in them.
#FlyEaglesFly	Take the Saints and give the points. This Sunday will be ugly.
@whca Jim can always get a job as a swimsuit model. The pays good and he'll get a nice suntan. https://t.co/i05FEvV3TE
@CNN You can file this tweet under "no one gives a flying freckin crap."
@Eagles @lawlornfl The 2018 version on the Philadelphia Eagles are not very good. Maybe over confidence or arrogance or something else is making this team resemble a mediocre NFL football team. Sad but true. Facts speak for themselves.
@CNN @DanaBashCNN Propaganda CNN.
@JonahNRO What part of your return was audited?
@jpodhoretz Your Disdain for Trump is well documented. You constantly rip POTUS. True, sad and sick. Get a life and report and tweet other than Trump.
@36westbrook 2018 version of the Eagles is terrible. Out coached, out played..... just a sad season. BTW, good morning.
@dcexaminer Her life must be real shitty if she needs Trump to peddle her book.
@kasie Yet Obama adding $10 trillion to the debt wasn't a big deal. It's the tax cuts, right? At least be honest Kasie.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Joe needs to get his head out from between Mika's legs. It's funky stale air down there, he needs to come up for oxygen and clear out his mind.
@AJDelgado13 I do not care for your daily soap opera of complaints.  Welcome to the real world.
@thehill And I couldn't stop smiling watching Trump take office and watching the Obama's crying. 😆
@peter_king for those of us who were born in Philly and grew up with the Birds ....We don't need your arrogant intellectual better/smarter than the hard working tax paying  eagle fan approval to boo our beloved birds. When they suck, they suck. They suck this year	#FlyEaglesFly
@thehill Seems Michelle needs Trump to sell her book?
@thehill Can't wait for his second concession speech. 😂
@Jeff_McLane When will a reporter address Carson Wentz inability for "come from behind" of victories? Take this Cowboys game and throw in the Panthers game, he's terrible at this most critical moment of a game.
@thehill And the media believes this sincerity from Cohen, really? It's an orchestrated move by Lanny Davis ....
@Eagles this team sure doesn't look anything like last years team. From the coaching to the waterboy. This years team is terrible.
@LeftStandingUp @BrianKempGA Earth to TYT knuckleheads: Kemp resigned as SOS last week. Don't blame him. Yet you call yourself a journalist. Sad.
@Jeff_McLane This team is one and done. Won't make the playoffs.  Put a fork in em, they're terrible.
@RealGlenMacnow Whatever game plan the coaches put in for the O sure does look like and smell like 💩
@nytpolitics Figured NYT would get a giant boner on this story.
@Susan_Hennessey How can you trust democracy when public officials are incompetent and count illegal votes? Your complaint should be with the county board of elections and not Rubio.
@robreiner https://t.co/JUwBYYm5sI
@Shem @yashar CNN morning, afternoons and evening shows need a giant kick in the azz or program replacement to even try to match at least MSNBC ratings.

@NFL Largest 🇺🇸 ever sewn! 505 ft by 225 ft and weighs 3000 lbs. Takes 500 people to unfurl. Each ⭐️ is 17 ft high. 👏 — at The Hoover Dam.		Yet NFL players and cheerleaders will take a knee. Sad. https://t.co/axpsbPs4aK

@NateSilver538 MSM has yet reported to  America the screw ups of Brenda Snipes which in fact, does in fact cause concern for the integrity of the votes in her county.  Why is this?
@Cernovich I turned 25 in 1983. I wish I knew NAFTA and other trade deals would cripple America. Both Repubs &amp; Dems thought these deals would be great for America.

@peterbakernyt @grynbaum If WH reporters are to be considered journalists, they shouldn't give their opinions except for rare occasions. Facts and facts only. Yet some give their opinions on a daily basis. My suggestion would be to stay on the opinion side of journalism &amp; leave their position at the WH.
@Acosta If you consider yourself a journalist in the WH, you shouldn't give your opinions except for rare occasions. Facts and facts only. Yet you give your opinions on a daily basis. My suggestion would be stay on the opinion side of journalism and leave your position at the WH.

@thehill Some of these so-called journalists are opinion folks and shouldn't be allowed in the WH pool. Write and speak your opinions as you wish, but not at press conferences.
@GeraldoRivera Agree.
@peterbakernyt Same could be said with the media. The WH press conference the other day was a disgrace for the MSM.

@chrislhayes Yet the media recounted every vote afterwards and found Bush indeed won Florida.  At least be honest Chris.
@maggieNYT @MarkMazzettiNYT @charlie_savage Mini-me? Journalist? Don't think so.

@KungFunny @thehill You have "funny" in your address and thought I'd get a chuckle out of it.
@JeffFlake Resign today, do us a favor.
@washingtonpost Dear @donlemon,	When you're done demonizing white men, care to address the fact that, per DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks (13% of the population), commit nearly 50% of the nation's homicides--and are nearly 50% of homicide victims?	- Larry Elder
@KungFunny @thehill Are you ok with this attire at the Supreme Court? https://t.co/tOu6BJPp85

@iowahawkblog While CNN/MSNBC has no problem attacking Trump voters as racists, Nazis, sexists, homophobic etc ... and let's not forget the latest by Don Lemon. 		Why attack voters? I'm a Fox viewer, I've never seen them attack Dem voters. Not once.
@NBCNightlyNews Who cares?
@dcexaminer White men are the biggest problem in the US. He said it. I'm a 60 yr old white man. He's a racist.

@SportsRadioWIP Yes
@thehill Great news, love it!
@b_giggz @maggieNYT Do you loathe 60+ million Americans? I've got a problem with the media and a very very small portion of the Dems who destroy property. Besides that, I've got no problem with any Dem, Repub, Indy or anyone. Everyone has a right to speak &amp; vote.
@EricHolder @JoyAnnReid @repjohnlewis Yet when he doesn't agree with the person who wins the election, he complains nonstop.
@yashar Yashar, if Mueller comes up with nothing on Trump. (1) do you think the media will ever accept it? (2) apologize for all the BS punditry of smokin guns, meetings etc... ? Be honest please.
@sumarumi @Gritty_NHL_ @maggieNYT Trump has done the following which Obana didn't:		-sold arms to Ukraine		-got Germany not to buy billions of Russian energy 		- US now #1 oil producer in the world pitting a dent into Russian energy economy		Keep living out your fantasies while I'll stick to the facts.
@ABCPolitics ABC along with all their reporters are now full fledged groupies for this guy.
@sumarumi @Gritty_NHL_ @maggieNYT If we're not allies, why do we still have troops with NATO, why did the EU agree to a new trade agreement with Trump, why is Merkel/Germany now buying their energy needs from Trump? 		https://t.co/8qpx8PbTI2

@ben_rosen Dude, read your history and it will explain everything.
@josefoshea @maggieNYT You have a good point and totally understand. I've told my kids when it comes to presidents, choose the 3 or 4 main issues your concerned with and vote accordingly.  If a person agrees 100% with a candidate... there is something wrong big time.
@josefoshea @maggieNYT I enjoy talking with folks of all political, racial, religious etc backgrounds.  Learn a lot even at my tender age of 60.
@josefoshea @maggieNYT I will later today. Thanks and have a good week!
@josefoshea @maggieNYT Can you please provide facts on your question. Tx
@maggieNYT I used to pride myself reading the lefts commentary and watching CNN/MSNBC with their input.  The older I get and the more the left rips Trump &amp; Repubs the more I detest the MSM.  Just being real.
@MaxBoot After seeing you on TV ....	Why would hard working Americans spend their after tax dollars to buy your book? 👎
@Grant_Case @JakeSherman Valid comment. As for me, both R's &amp; D's cannot be trusted. I'm 60 and seen both sides throw BS at the American public for years.
@Grant_Case @JakeSherman Made up issue by MSM for years now. Except for tax accountants and tax attorneys, no one in America can comprehend what a several thousand page tax return looks like or can make sense of.  Honestly, 100 professionals could review with each person having a different opinion
@CNN Majority of US citizens do not care about Khashoggi yet since he's a WaPo journalist, it will be hammered home by MSM.
@JakeSherman If personal tax returns are to be required, pass a law within the FEC.  I understand all FEC financial disclosures were met by Trump. Media can complain all they want, it's not a requirement.
@RealGlenMacnow Buddy Ryan and the Swamp Fox too ...
@jaketapper @michaelbeatty3 Really Jake? You're really asking for a poll? You got to be kidding.  CNN is democrat progressive propaganda as Fox is the same to the right. 		If the poll makes you fell good, whatever.
@howardeskin @SportsRadioWIP This is an average team at best Howard. They're an 8-8 team. The quicker the fans understand this truth, the saner they will be.

@thehill Does the old guy remember Iowa went Trump by 9%+ over Hillary on 11/8/16? You may want to remind him.
@MichaelAvenatti heard you cancelled your Texas rally tomorrow night v Trump. Maybe he has 100,000 folks and many camping out already?
@Cernovich BTW, heard @MichaelAvenatti cancelled his gig tomorrow night which was to counter Trump/Cruz. Is it true and why? (I'm giving you a lead in here, run with it 😉)
@JensJenson1 @thehill Greatest night of my 60 year life. Watching Hillary getting her azz kicked on 11/8/16. A date which will live in infamy! https://t.co/1pTemnJcj9

@NBCSPhilly Tell the 7 yr veteran that this 60 yr old man and 54 yr eagle fan has seen this way too many times over the years.  This team is an 8-8 team, put a fork in em. They're average at best.
@MBarkannNBCS His last two plays reminded me of Pete Liske.
@MBarkannNBCS As a 60 yr old and a 54 yr eagle fan, I've see this before so here I go:	We're an 8-8 team. Put a fork in em.

@dcexaminer Copying the Dems from 2016.
@thehill So what ????
@RoobNBCS St Nick gave our town a long awaited Christmas present last year!
@thehill Seems it's not working. NBC/WSJ gives Trump a 47% approval ratings. 😉
@jaketapper @McKinsey I know this will shock you and your media buddies ..... most Americans do not care about this subject. As sad as it is he was killed.  Most Americans have a life outside the media bubble; outside of D.C.; outside of NYC.
@maggieNYT Media always believes they're right 200% of the time on every subject. Question for you Maggie. When you guys are hired, does it automatically places you guys as Gods with a direct entry into Mr Olympus?
@thehill They also endorsed Hillary as did 98% of the media. And we all know how those endorsements paid off. 😂
@serpicoRGB @MidwesternMama2 @elwasson @KattyKayBBC Funny, most republican voters feel the same about the democrat leadership.
@serpicoRGB @MidwesternMama2 @elwasson @KattyKayBBC If you say so it must be true. But what about NBC?
@MidwesternMama2 @elwasson @KattyKayBBC 3 polls have Trump at 47%.  😉 		https://t.co/jcabMHkNLM
@MSNBC Our Intelligence Community needs to weigh in  for POTUS to make decisions. Yet Durbin/MSNBC says screw it, kick em out of the country and let's start an Oil shortage where $200 a barrel could be the new norm.
@peterjhasson As long as these folks come legally. God Bless em, welcome and enjoy the greatest country in the world.
@secupp @Mediaite Cupp, your ratings are in the toilet, that should speak volumes to you.

@elwasson @KattyKayBBC Just think Katty, Trumps at 47% with nonstop bashing by NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, NPR, NYT, WaPo and other left wing MSM outlets. 		From the 47% .... Please give Joe &amp; Mika our best !
@chucktodd @Scaramucci Come on Anthony, you're more better than this.

@MichaelSteele face it Michael, you received your 30 pieces of silver from MSNBC and now you're a progressive democrat. Honestly, I think you always were one.

@lilsuntinmang @CNN “He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'” Luke 24:6-7

@GMAGRIZ @FoxNews @GeraldoRivera Agree
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams This dude makes me ill.
@GameMasterPOW @W56Annie @FoxNews @GeraldoRivera Agree both the D &amp; R are responsible for this mess which goes back 50 years. A comprehensive immigration policy and law must be reached.
@MSNBC Why didn't these folks file the required paper work a few years back to enter the US legally? Or did they just wake up a few days ago and said: "F it, I going to enter US illegally"
@GameMasterPOW @W56Annie @FoxNews @GeraldoRivera I have zero problems with legal immigration. We're a country built on it. I do have a problem with illegal immigrants. My folks did it the right/legal way as ten of millions have.
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Yet Carter Page is a free man today. Seems the DOJ/FBI paid for what? They paid to snoop on Trump. Total BS.

@davidaxelrod Would you prefer the truth or a slanted story? This question is directed to both you and Trump.

@JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump The facts? You put a man in prison without "true facts". Correct?
@JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump The facts or the story? I think Trump is waiting for the facts. AP reported the WH asked Turkey for the audio. Talking about facts, you &amp; MSM hung these guys out to dry prior to the facts. Correct? https://t.co/shv42onHqd
@michellemalkin Or Fido? He'll follow Schumer around like a lost puppy and raise his leg to do #1 on the State of Texas.

@LarrySabato How's your crystal ball after you had to smash it on 11/8/16? 😂

@cs_frenzy @thehill Your losing this debate Colleen. God Bless you and go back to work.

@thehill Report? Why not read the cookl book she stole from and compare the two?  They're word god word for goodness sake.

@Brent858 @FrankLuntz We've heard from the Turks only. Even they are NATO, they're not our favorite ally and they do have a beef against Saudi Arabia. I do believe he was killed. I'm saying simply, let's get all the facts first.  Call me crazy, let's see all the facts prior to making a firm decision.
@littleyoyo4 @FrankLuntz I'd say he's guilty based on the civil trial which proved he was guilty and ordered to pay the victims families.
@FrankLuntz Everyone wanted Trump to can Lewandowski within minute of his alleged mugging of the female reporter. Remember? Trump said let's see the facts first while even Kasich said he would have canned. Let's see the facts first before taking action. A belief our country used to cherish.

@MSNBC More $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Stormy will have to pay to Trumps lawyers to defend. The creepy porn lawyer is a gift that keeps on giving.
@NBCNews More legal fees to be paid to Trumps layers 😆 		$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@NBCNews Creepy porn lawyer batting average is in a slump. 😂
@jaketapper @DLoesch Thanks for posting Jake. You try to be fair. Unlike the others in CNN &amp; MSNBC.
@MSNBC Cherokee Nation responds to Warren. Says she is a disgrace and NOT INDIAN .... https://t.co/JNiBCJhTVW
@BostonGlobe @MikeEmanuelFox Read the press release from REAL AMERICAN INDIANS ..... report this! https://t.co/NynymF2kSG
@ABC @LindaSuhler She's not an Indian according to actual Indians .... https://t.co/SlPO80Y3gy
@CBSNews She's not an Indian according to Real Indians ... https://t.co/DRWbb9dTPF
@JonahNRO At times, you do come across as an obnoxious right wing never trump zealot. Just saying.
@Jim_Jordan With all due respect. Either get the info you're requesting or shut up. I'm sick and tired of hearing your bitching.
@NateSilver538 I take all bets against the Dems 20% chance of winning both the house and senate. ALL BETS!
@dcexaminer If I had Warren’s heritage and called myself a Native American on a job application, I’d commit resume fraud. It’s that simple.		So why is anyone treating these results as vindicating her?		-David French-
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump And you didn't write an Indian cook book too? Correct?
@RonanFarrow Yet you spend most of your time telling the world a drunk woman 36 years ago couldn't remember who flashed a penis.  And now you blame yourself &amp; media for under reporting this story. You lost credibility big time dude.
@washingtonpost She's no Indian:	Most tribes require a specific % of Native “blood,” called blood quantum, also to being able to document which tribal member u descend from. Some tribes require as much as 25% Native heritage, &amp; most require at least 1/16th, which is one great-great grandparent.
@thehill She's no Indian:	Most tribes require a specific % of Native “blood,” called blood quantum, also to being able to document which tribal member u descend from. Some tribes require as much as 25% Native heritage, &amp; most require at least 1/16th, which is one great-great grandparent.
@tribelaw Where was your complaint a few years back when the Dems had 60 Senators?
@PhilipRucker @aviselk I'm a republican, I love it. And I'm sure if there was one for Dem POTUS's you would love it too.
@dmartosko Most tribes require a specific % of Native “blood,” called blood quantum, also to being able to document which tribal member u descend from. Some tribes require as much as 25% Native heritage, &amp; most require at least 1/16th Native heritage, which is one great-great grandparent.

@AnaCabrera You had several false stories over the weekend. Which story does this refer to?
@CNNPolitics Warren claimed her parents had to secretly marry because her father's racist parents disapproved of him dating an obvious Indian woman, who we now know was maybe 0.195% Cherokee.
@thehill Warren claimed her parents had to secretly marry because her father's racist parents disapproved of him dating an obvious Indian woman, who we now know was maybe 0.195% Cherokee.
@maggieNYT Warren claimed her parents had to secretly marry because her father's racist parents disapproved of him dating an obvious Indian woman, who we now know was maybe 0.195% Cherokee.
@CillizzaCNN Warren claimed her parents had to secretly marry because her father's racist parents disapproved of him dating an obvious Indian woman, who we now know was maybe 0.195% Cherokee.
@mkraju @KattyKayBBC Warren claimed her parents had to secretly marry because her father's racist parents disapproved of him dating an obvious Indian woman, who we now know was maybe 0.195% Cherokee.
@washingtonpost We all owe Elizabeth Warren 1/512th of an apology.
@thedailybeast We owe Elizabeth Warren 1/512th of an apology.
@robreiner I will vote. I will vote Republican Party Line and Trump in 2020.
@dcexaminer Define the words "some blood" as it pertains to % and location of these Indian tribes in her heritage.
@elizabethforma @daveweigel @realDonaldTrump The funniest statistic out of that test is that Warren is 99.9% white. 		IM NOT THAT WHITE!
@JoeNBC 	I used to watch your show a few times per week. Over a year ago I stopped due to your daily bashing of Trump. Once or twice a month I'll tune in your show. Yet after 3 minutes I turn you off due to your continuing bashing. Sad, your show used to be good.
@MSNBC She's supposedly less than 1% .... really?
@MSNBC "Think" v "knows" two different words with totally different definitions yet MSNBC continues their non factual reporting with a smile. You guys continue to be the lefts propaganda machine.
@dcexaminer Stick to your play-a-cop tv show and let Trump to make America great again.
@KattyKayBBC I watched BBC Election night on UTUBE the other day. My goodness were you sad. Brought a smile on my face. Thank you. 😉
@KennedyNation We get over 900,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia... what would life in the US be like without it? You're a business journalist, think about it.
@ananavarro You are no longer considered in the "we" column.  You sold out for 30 pieces of silver to CNN and we put you into the "they" column.
@RealGlenMacnow 👎 until he wins a SB
@HeyTammyBruce Aye

@TheConnersABC No freckin way. This show will bomb. Bigly!
@chuckwoolery https://t.co/hNgumzJpdG
@MSNBC A 3rd grade teacher ripping a man when he was 9 yrs old.  Has to be a democrat.
@NBCNews https://t.co/gOSLWJBUuY
@nikkihaley Good luck to you !
@WonderBitchToo @MSNBC Not me. I wouldn't use those words but I do know a few folks who would.
@MSNBC Give the general credit.  He didn't use the C or B words to describe her. Many would have.
@MaxBoot Das Boot and his new found buddies having a spat.  Hilarious
@Djesno @FaceTheNation @JonahNRO A doctor is killed working a "doctors without borders" gig; the media would report 1/1000th as I said. The media protects their own, just being real. I wish no one would be killed. Yet media believes their more special than the rest of us.
@dcexaminer Enough of this person. Normal hard working Americans do not care what she thinks or says.  Only the MSM cares by pushing her left wing propaganda smears. ENOUGH!
@ValerieJarrett @BarackObama @donlemon Are you saying this black man should not be in the WH and banned?
@brianstelter Your network is having a tough time averaging 1 million prime time viewers. What is this due to Brian? Be honest for once. Please respond.
@foxandfriends Thought he was into drunken gang rapes? 		God Bless Justice Kavanaugh and his family.
@FaceTheNation @JonahNRO If the guy who was killed WASN'T a journalist, the media would give the story 1/1000th of the airtime. Just being honest.
@KFILE While MSNBC pushed this both on social media and on TV nonstop. And what are the ramifications? Not a damn thing. Media brethren gives them a pass and a pat on the back saying thank you, you tried.
RT @NBCNews: CORRECTION: An earlier tweet misidentified the general President Trump described as "incredible" at a rally in Ohio. It was Ge…
@thehill Own it Romney! You went on a Never Trump tour  both on network and cable the weeks following your despicable speech.
@nytpolitics Why should they? You'll lie and rip them with your leftist progressive propaganda slant. You always do.
@brianstelter And CNN defines mob as the "M" word, elevating it to the N word. 😉
@JackPosobiec https://t.co/qtBNrvTCH3
@brianstelter Be prepared to watch the Beehive Soccer played by these young ones. The smile on their faces is priceless. Enjoy!
@hughhewitt It was a challenge given to ALL Americans not just NASA by the late great JFK. We paid for it, we cheered it, it was what America was all about. I'm 60 today. I was 10 when America landed on the moon. I'm still proud of the mission and America.
@RoobNBCS Well said
@thehill He's right. MSNBC bastardized his statement to fit their ideaolica progressive propaganda slant. https://t.co/VwqsfVS7zI
https://t.co/3PTpBNOdW5
@brianstelter @DLoesch What's interesting is Brian, CNN &amp; MSM cannot handle Trumps fighting sprit. Every punch thrown at him by these folks he uses a canon to return fire. They're unable to cope with this.
@KFILE See what Elizabeth Warren started..... everyone has Indian blood now.
@RoobNBCS Another reason: hairdo
@dcexaminer What is a "Beto"?
@thehill "The Hill" should ask the owners of the building they work in if they use the same tax code? If not, they should. 😉
@paulkrugman Both Repubs &amp; Dems wrote the tax laws. It's the way America built our buildings, malls, strip centers etc.. throughout the entire country. If you don't like the tax laws, change it along with the way you want to change the Constitution to eliminate the electoral college.
@gabrielsherman https://t.co/frOtHMwTBT
@brianstelter Maybe Bozo fits? You're 99.999999% negative as is CNN reporting and commenting on Trump.
@Cernovich Love rain on a Saturday morning. No work, no church. Priceless!
@dcexaminer Resign today Senator. Resign today!
@robreiner Needless to say our country is a Republic. I enjoy your professional works over the years yet totally disagree with your political views.
