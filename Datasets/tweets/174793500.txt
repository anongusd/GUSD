The legislation received bi-partisan support from lawmakers and directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect data on cancer incidences among fire fighters.
This is a huge victory for #IAFF members as we have encouraged members of Congress to support legislative efforts to establish better preventative measures and treatment of cancer among fire fighters. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death of fire fighters.
VICTORY! The #Firefighter Cancer Registry Act has passed the House with unanimous consent Friday morning and is now awaiting the signature of President Donald Trump.

The Cancer Registry will provide scientists the data they need to better determine the effectiveness of personal protective equipment and decontamination procedures.
The cancer registry will provide key data regarding #firefighter employment experience. In addition, the registry will track the number and type of incidents responded to throughout one’s career

Thank you, Senator @lisamurkowski for introducing legislation to help establish the #Firefighter Cancer Registry Act
The cancer registry has received bi-partisan support in Congress
The #Firefighter Cancer Registry Act will create a national registry for fire fighters who have been diagnosed with cancer #IAFF
#Firefighters have an increased risk for several types of cancer including: testicular, stomach, leukemia, lung and brain cancer
NIOSH research finds #firefighters have a 14 percent increased risk of dying from cancer than the general population
Cancer is the leading cause of line of duty deaths among #firefighters #IAFF
Throughout their careers #firefighters are exposed to a wide range of harmful toxins and scientific studies have consistently demonstrated a strong link between firefighting and cancer. #IAFF
