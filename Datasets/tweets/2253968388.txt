Ensuring the integrity of our elections and upholding the rule of law are both critically important and noble causes, but after a year the time has come for Mr. #Mueller to either put forward a case or move on.
#Mueller has a team of lawyers and has spent millions over the past year, yet there still is no indication of illegal collusion. While this drama of leaks and far-flung investigations may be good for the national news media and liberal fundraising, it is not good for our country.
It has been one year since Robert #Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian collusion related to the 2016 presidential election and very little has been accomplished. It is time for Mr. Mueller to wrap up his investigation. https://t.co/Caxi53to88

Despite a majority in the House and the Senate expressing opposition to the #Iran deal, President Obama chose to act alone without Congressional approval, and that is one of many reasons why this deal was never going to work.
President Obama’s decision to enter into the nuclear ‘deal’ with #Iran was the biggest U.S. foreign policy mistake since the end of World War I, and it has not made America or the world a safer place.

@poppaskid The bill does NOT fund Planned Parenthood. Not a single penny goes to that abhorrent organization.

The funding bill includes strong funding levels for vital coastal ecosystem programs and makes critical investments for Alabama’s farmers and foresters.
The funding bill paves the way for new road projects, like the I-10 Bridge, while also ensuring resources for improvements to the Port of Mobile, other road projects, and expansion of rural broadband initiatives.
The funding bill includes many provisions important to Alabama, including money for the construction of three Littoral Combat Ships and one Expeditionary Fast Transport, which are built by @Austal_USA in Mobile.

@Ms_Liz2 The bill would call for the pay to be held in an escrow account until a budget is passed. This is Constitutional.
(6) Implements zero based budgeting in an effort to ensure all programs and expenditures are justified by agencies from the ground up at the beginning of each budget cycle. #BudgetReform
(5) Shifts most mandatory spending to discretionary with the exceptions being Social Security Old Age and Survivors benefits, Medicare, TRICARE, and veterans programs, taking almost all spending off autopilot. #BudgetReform
(4) Repeals the Budget Control Act caps that have hurt military readiness and been used by Democrats as leverage for wasteful spending. #BudgetReform
(3) Withholds pay for Members of Congress if Congress fails to pass a conferenced budget resolution on time. No Budget, No Pay! #BudgetReform
(2) Subjects all appropriations bills to the reconciliation process, resulting in a 51 vote majority needed for passage in the Senate if bills comply with the budget. #BudgetReform
(1) The bill moves to biennial budgeting in an effort to create a more realistic time frame for the budgeting and appropriations process. #BudgetReform

(5) The resolution prohibits Members of Congress from engaging in a sexual relationship with any staff member under their supervision and makes clear that sexual harassment is a violation of the Code of Official Conduct and will not be tolerated.
(4) The resolution paves the way for every Congressional office to have a clearly defined anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy. This reform alone will result in greater awareness.
(3) The bill will ensure that Members of Congress, not taxpayers, are responsible for paying out sexual harassment settlements.
(2) The bill increases transparency by requiring that basic information about any sexual harassment or other claims be made public so the American people are fully aware of what is happening in the Congress.
(1) The bill makes the process of handling employment law claims smoother, faster, and fairer. The bill also creates an office of employee advocacy to ensure staff has access to legal counsel, just as Member offices are provided.
Our bipartisan bill includes a range of reforms to the way sexual harassment and other employment law claims are handled on Capitol Hill. Here are five that I am especially proud of:
This is a commonsense policy in almost all workplaces, and now Congress will play by the same rules. https://t.co/yb0WTyMxKJ
@Nanacruze @RepSpeier @GreggHarper @RepBrady @SusanWBrooks @RepTedDeutch @HouseAdmnGOP @HouseAdm_Dems Here you go. There are both a bill and a separate resolution.	Resolution: https://t.co/keG5TxYo0y	Bill: https://t.co/g9AdYqRszU
@loureynolds1940 Originally, Congress wasn't covered at all. This bill would do away with the slush fund and make Members personally financially responsible for harassment claims, not taxpayers. Taxpayer money should not and will not be used to settle claims against members going forward.
Our reform bill has been a truly bipartisan effort and an example of how Congress should work. Thanks to @RepSpeier, @GreggHarper, @RepBrady, @SusanWBrooks, @RepTedDeutch, @HouseAdmnGOP, &amp; @HouseAdm_Dems for working with me on this substantive and transformative legislation.
Our bipartisan reform bill will bring the Congressional workplace into the 21st Century and ensure that Congress plays by the same rules as the private sector.
The House is now considering transformative legislation to reform the way sexual harassment and other employment law claims are handled on Capitol Hill. This is a strong bipartisan bill that will increase transparency and accountability.

I explained that I strongly support protecting those programs for current seniors &amp; those nearing retirement age, but we must look at more long-term reforms to make sure the program is there for the next generation. https://t.co/EM17iAPMbv
@magnumpi032003 Yes.
A number of questions at my town halls today about the FISA memo. As I have said, I strongly support making the memo public for the American people to read and evaluate for themselves. #ReleaseTheMemo
Our final town hall meeting of the day has kicked off in #Creola. The first question was about the new VA clinic in Mobile County. #100thTownHall https://t.co/PAfrM6eucY
Great view of the Tombigbee Rivera’s we cross back over from Clarke into Washington County. Headed to #Creola now! #100thTownHall https://t.co/9m2NVt3IFs
Another question in #Jackson about infrastructure. I expect and hope that @POTUS will make rural projects a key portion of his infrastructure plan when it is unveiled in the coming weeks. #100thTownHall https://t.co/rNoAH6WiMa
Question in #Jackson about the recent government shutdown and if it will happen again next month. My response: Shutting down the government to advance your agenda doesn’t work, so I hope not. Plus, I’ll be really upset if I have to miss #MardiGras! https://t.co/2IHFLTBXKw
We are underway in #Jackson with town hall number 101! First question is about how much bipartisanship actually occurs in Washington. My answer: more than the national news media tells you about! #100thTownHall https://t.co/rpS4nVAgPe
RT @Bob_Grip: In Jackson with @RepByrne https://t.co/mD4AELL3er
Town hall number 💯 is in the books! Thanks to the people of #GroveHill for their fantastic questions and the fun cake! #100thTownHall https://t.co/PeCmlVJuub
Concern raised about Alabama’s rural hospitals. I outlined my efforts to work with @SeemaCMS to fix the broken wage index that is really hurting our rural hospitals. #100thTownHall https://t.co/fGHjtbBGYQ
Question about the #TaxCutsandJobsAct and how it will impact communities in Southwest Alabama. The short answer: families will get more money in their pockets and the economy will boom! #100thTownHall https://t.co/7cDnitus3Q
We’ve kicked off my #100thTownHall in #GroveHill. First question is about possible issues at the FBI. https://t.co/dQHBSR8hbP
Chatom is home to some of the finest people in Alabama. Always love catching up and spending time in Washington County! https://t.co/tF5n10pv9i
We are underway with our first town hall meeting of the day in #Chatom! First question is about taking care of our veterans. #100thTownHall https://t.co/wQfRbn11Yd
Great to be back in #Chatom! Looking forward to our 99th town hall meeting. https://t.co/Tk4BxBp4AB
On the way to #Chatom for my 99th town hall meeting! Hope to see you at 9:30. #100thTownHall Tour https://t.co/TJ7AxTmjpQ
My confidence is with the #TaxCutsandJobsAct the American economy is going to boom, but our local economy right here in Mobile will boom as well. https://t.co/dWLlrF050F
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct will help businesses - small and large - grow and expand. From lowering rates to allowing the full cost of new/used equipment to be written off, this bill is pro-jobs and pro-growth. https://t.co/SnWyvJYwbm
Kicking the morning off in downtown Mobile with the @MobileChamber’s Federal Tax Policy Forum. The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is a big win for Southwest Alabama! https://t.co/HVeclp12GD
Hope you will join me for my #100thTownHall Tour today in #Chatom, #GroveHill, #Jackson, and #Creola! I look forward to answering your questions and celebrating my 100th in-person town hall meeting. https://t.co/sY20gVhC4f
It was an honor to present Lt. Col. Stephen Howard with a plaque commemorating his 50 years of service in the @CivilAirPatrol. Very impressive! https://t.co/MhbARoPEct
Yet another positive development thanks to passage of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct! https://t.co/XzMU4GdMH1
RT @HouseGOP: .@WaltDisneyCo employees wished upon a star and got $1,000 bonuses thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. 	https://t.co/ArAfKYM5uQ
RT @yhn: .@RepByrne town hall meetings rescheduled after gov’t shutdown #alpolitics https://t.co/nIMxuaef4K
I’m excited to hit the road on Wednesday and Thursday for my #100thTownHall Tour. I hope you can join us! Details: https://t.co/JPBKMH0YF6 https://t.co/y31gMkJW9q
RT @GovernorKayIvey: Thankful Congress has finally funded the federal government &amp; reauthorized the CHIP program. Caring for our children &amp;…
RT @SpeakerRyan: After a three-day shutdown, this government funding bill is heading to the @WhiteHouse. https://t.co/GGrhVaqvKq
I was proud to preside over the House as we passed the longest reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (#CHIP) in our nation's history. Great news for the over 150,000 children in Alabama who benefit from #CHIP and #ALLKids! https://t.co/fqI1Ss5lbF
Additionally, my actual #100thTownHall will now take place in #GroveHill on Wednesday! Looking forward to celebrating this special occasion in Clarke County. https://t.co/HsM6yGYoQx
Unfortunately, the town hall meeting scheduled for #Chickasaw tomorrow (Tuesday) has been canceled due to my travel schedule back from Washington. We will be sure to make up the Chickasaw and Bay Minette town halls in the coming weeks.
Given the end of the #SchumerShutdown, I have updated my town hall meeting schedule for the remainder of this week. I look forward to being in #Chatom, #GroveHill, #Jackson, #Creola, #EastBrewton, and #FriscoCity. Hope to see you! https://t.co/ClcaR5l1eS
Proud to be on this list. If our troops weren't getting paid, Members of Congress shouldn't either. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/rhpkSRKdHd
Thankfully, the #SchumerShutdown is drawing to a close. I can't say this enough: this political stunt by @SenateDems was foolish and reckless, and all for nothing. https://t.co/rRxl8F7WTZ
RT @City_of_Mobile: In Mobile, Mardi Gras is more than a party. It’s a legacy. https://t.co/T4AeB2NVRy
Very glad to have my friend @SteveScalise back at the Capitol! https://t.co/CQyUIKy1Im
