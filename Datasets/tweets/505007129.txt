@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump Sorry I didnt mean "the tape" I meant taped evidence of the ridiculous things he says on a daily basis during interviews or rallies or his awful tweets.  There is nothing mild about his bullying.  Yes people from both sides say horrendous things but... 	He. Is. The. President.
Eye of Fig Newtons #SpookyCuisine
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump I agree the media sometimes doesn't help the situation but when we have actual tape of this man making racist comments, bragging about sexually assaulting women, bullying people, surrounding himself with the worst of the worst the list goes on.  I for one am fed up.
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump 👍
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump P.s. thanks for having a reasonable discussion I really appreciate that!!
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump I agree that you will never find a president that everyone agrees with 100% but in my opinion things are only getting worse.  Another day another scandal and I'm very concerned about the world my daughters are going to grow up in.
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump When he 1st ran I thought hmmm good someone different to run this country like a business.  But that idea was short lived, I honestly don't think he possesses any morals or ethics.  💰 in his pocket is his main focus.  I'm glad you are seeing positive results, I wish more we're.
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo That's why I don't have a problem with pro athletes using their influence no matter their views because honestly more people probably listen to what they have to say rather than some random politician.
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo Fortunately no
@theAGGRESSI0N @kaitlin_lange @indystar @VicOladipo @realDonaldTrump Yes, he has made thousands of people wake up and take notice of what is going on in our country/world, including myself.  And for that I am grateful to him.  I do not like what I see, I think we can do better and we deserve better.

@CNN @DavidAndelman @CNNOpinion Don't worry he's quite comfortable there.

Paul George gone... #TellASadStoryInThreeWords
I've never been so happy to see 2 crazy kids get together on a TV show!  #TheGoldbergs
Growing up my mom bought &amp; read every single @StephenKing book she could get her hands on. Now @aniaahlborn is my #StephenKing #HorrorLegacy
@edngarden so excited about this product!! #SharkTank
@rieledowns I am loving all these animal shirts!!  Charlotte has the best wardrobe!!  #HenryDanger #TeenNickBestDressed
Why why why do people sit there for hours and not ask for a lawyer.  If  #Dateline has taught me anything, it's say nothing w/o a lawyer!
Nothing makes me angrier than a well done #Documentary and after watching #TwistOfFaith and #3801Lancaster my blood is boiling
