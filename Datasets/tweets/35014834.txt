The CBO also specifies an alternative scenario based on extending the tax cuts and continuing current spending policies that would lead to an additional $3.8 trillion in deficits over the 10-year window.
According to the CBO, the cash deficits for Social Security and Medicare Part A will total nearly $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
The alarming #deficit picture during a period of economic growth reflects a failure of officials in Washington to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course. We should be seeing annual federal deficits shrink, but they are projected to be over $1 trillion a year over 10 years.

Many problems come from such a costly #healthcare system. #Healthcare costs are eroding companies’ bottom lines. Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance are paying more of their premiums or are seeing their employers pay higher premiums.		https://t.co/Na1g6YUQcd

There are only two types of solutions to #fixourfuture in #SocialSecurity. You can either raise revenue to make up for the insufficiency of the current wage tax or you can reduce spending to make up for increasing benefit payments.		https://t.co/lSNvOSjM1K

The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is necessary that public opinion should co-operate. -- George Washington
We must avoid the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but also by vigorous exertion in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned. -- George Washington
As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible. -- George Washington

“We need to make sure that tax reform improves long-term economic growth, raises enough revenue to prevent the debt from ballooning, and does not hide costs with gimmicks. Lawmakers should conference to look for a more responsible approach to tax changes." - Bob Bixby,
“This is the wrong bill at the wrong time. Like its counterpart in the House, the Senate’s tax bill is based on the flawed premise that another trillion dollars or more of new debt is needed to spur higher economic growth." - Bob Bixby, Concord's executive director.
The bill is based on flawed economics, reckless fiscal policy and blatant budget gimmickry. It worsens the fiscal outlook and introduces new complexities in the tax code. Policymakers should be aiming to lower deficits and make the tax code more efficient. https://t.co/a5ExqiQoQJ

When one talks like a deficit hawk only to turn around and support expensive legislation that adds to our growing national debt, the only logical conclusion is that their past budgetary concerns weren’t what they appeared to be. https://t.co/jI2eVdtr08
Most legislation has some fiscal impact, either in cutting taxes or increasing spending. Often, budgetary concerns expressed by a bill’s opponents are sincere. But sometimes critics of the policy will use its effect on the deficit as a cudgel against it. https://t.co/jI2eVdtr08

The tax code, reformed or not, should bring in sufficient revenue to fix our unsustainable fiscal path #taxreform https://t.co/Xwc68SqS42 https://t.co/c1UAgdbaVZ
Fixing that problem, however, cannot be considered in isolation from the fact that current fiscal policy is already on an unsustainable path

Lesson #3 from the #BalanceBudgetAgreement: a Constitutional amendment isn't necessary for responsible fiscal policy https://t.co/zIUI7TkKBV
Lesson #2 from #BalancedBudgetAgreement: it's easier to correct overshooting on deficit reduction than undershooting https://t.co/3fxxTznOoy
Takeaway #1 from 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement: bipartisan policy changes can put the debt on a downward trajectory https://t.co/fovcmHgc7F
This week we took a look back 20 years at the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement and its key takeaways https://t.co/6OzXqvDCbN
To mark The Concord Coalition's 25th anniversary, we're sharing 25 lessons learned. Take a look at the first 12: https://t.co/iZfv4d3TP6 https://t.co/icyb2OY4rl
A constitutional amendment can't substitute for political will &amp; the absence of an amendment isn't an excuse for irresponsible fiscal policy
Now the nation faces large projected increases in deficits, and debt is projected to grow faster than the economy. https://t.co/zIUI7TkKBV https://t.co/5c3nTSomDS
Policymakers were able to balance the budget four times from 1998 to 2001 -- all without a constitutional amendment. https://t.co/zIUI7T39Kn https://t.co/eCXHLOtFE9
There's nothing magical about reaching an exact target each year. It IS important the debt grows more slowly than the economy as a whole.
While the sentiment behind a balanced budget amendment is understandable, it would be very difficult in practice. https://t.co/zIUI7TkKBV
A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is not necessary for responsible fiscal policy. Learn more:  https://t.co/zIUI7TkKBV https://t.co/bNtLES7rAq

RT @RepSchneider: @ConcordC Our federal budget workshop was one of our most popular events this spring. Looking forward to this next sessio…
We're proud to work w/  @RepSchneider to discuss impact of an unsustainable federal budget &amp; how we can work together to make hard decisions https://t.co/IHsnE4Hyo2
As past 25 years show, there's no harm in doing the job too well—the danger is if policymakers fail to act until the debt is out of control
All this serves as a reminder that budget projections are inherently uncertain. Deficits in the future won't be exactly what is projected.
Between 2001 &amp; 2010, the national debt--rather than being paid off--nearly doubled in size relative to the economy. https://t.co/3fxxTz6dx0
And by 2001, the government was projected to be within a decade of fully paying off the national debt. https://t.co/3fxxTz6dx0
By the end of the 1990s the nation saw an economic boon and the first federal budget surpluses in decades. https://t.co/3fxxTz6dx0
When @ConcordC was founded in the early '90s, CBO projected deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars. https://t.co/3fxxTz6dx0
Congress should approach fiscal reform in a bipartisan manner so both parties have stake in success &amp;are less likely to demagogue each other
The key lesson: policymakers-working across party lines-should gradually phase in policies to put projected deficits on downward trajectory.
Another takeaway from the BBA of 1997: it's easier to correct overshooting on deficit reduction than undershooting https://t.co/3fxxTznOoy
13 years after the Balanced Budget Agreement, 2 bipartisan commissions produced plans to put debt on a downward path https://t.co/fovcmHgc7F
This week is the 20th anniversary of 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, so we're sharing 3 lessons from the agreement. https://t.co/6OzXqvDCbN
One lesson from 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement: bipartisan policy changes can put the debt in a downward trajectory https://t.co/fovcmHgc7F
Hard policy choices are needed to make fiscal headway. This was illustrated by signing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. https://t.co/6OzXqvDCbN
It actually only took one year to achieve balance and the country had balanced budgets every year before 2002 -- but never afterwards.
One takeaway from the agreement itself is to not despair that partisan politics will forever impede progress on responsible fiscal policy

The Senate should pause to think carefully about fixing the insurance market &amp; focus on long-term cost control. https://t.co/N13KqxeX0C
Moving too quickly risks massive insurance loss, public frustration, uncertainty for providers &amp; gyrating insurance premiums.

On health care, Trump admin now faces choice on whether to further cost control or take the easy road &amp; back down. https://t.co/bmolnESF6Y
Spending on health care &amp; Social Security grows from 10.4% to 15.5% of GDP by 2047. Of that growth, 60% is from aging, 40% hc inflation.
As policymakers debate funding the government &amp; tax reform, they need to heed warning on long-term unsustainability: https://t.co/bmolnESF6Y
As CBO shows, even simply paying for new proposals still leaves the debt on an unsustainable path. https://t.co/bmolnFafYw
Elected officials can’t afford to become complacent-the last thing they should be doing is new tax cuts &amp; spending without paying for them.
Current budget discussions focused only on annual appropriations are far too limited. https://t.co/bmolnFafYw

Bixby: I commend the committee and the Senators for conducting this hearing in a thoughtful bipartisan manner.
Bixby: #Congress needs to re-establish its credibility with the budget by coming up with a new process.
Bixby: Biennial budgeting would allow lawmakers to make better use of @USGAO research and reports on federal programs.
Bixby: The benefit of biennial budgeting is more time in the second year for oversight. https://t.co/R3tVDgQe9a
Bixby: The last 2 budget agreements has led to biennial budgeting by default.
Bixby: the frustration people have is a reflection of a broken process. An orderly budget process could help restore public trust.
Bixby: Biennial budgeting is not a panacea, but it is an improvement over the current process. https://t.co/R3tVDgQe9a
Bixby: The budget process needs to encompass the whole budget; include regular review of tax expenditures &amp; mandatory spending.
Bixby: It's important to restore trust to the budget process; it's a necessary step towards addressing our long-term fiscal challenges.
Bixby: CBO estimates $300B was spent in 2014 &amp; 2015 on programs whose authorizations expired
Bob Bixby: a 2-year budget cycle allows for a more strategic approach to budgeting and improves evaluation of federal programs

Thanks everyone who watched Josh on @cspanwj this morning and joined the conversation on twitter! https://t.co/KUAnhSsNrf
Gordon: interest costs are projected to rapidly grow, is a consequence of growing deficits. https://t.co/vmuxnZvDet
Gordon: tax expenditures drain revenue from the govt. Getting rid of them can improve the tax code. https://t.co/DS989bGqHG
Gordon: The challenges facing the budget cannot be solved by 1 party. There need to be changes made to spending and revenue.
Learn more about #FirstBudget and our efforts in Iowa and New Hampshire to get #2016ers to discuss the debt! https://t.co/WTKoS6Qk7e
Gordon: the long-term budget challenge is controlling the spending growth of retirement and health care programs by enacting key reforms.
Gordon: Appropriations spending is shrinking as a percentage of the economy, while mandatory spending is increasing.
Gordon: The default prevention act will still allow the govt. to not pay some bills. https://t.co/kMALyWG9xr
Gordon says we need to replace the #debtlimit. Read our policy brief for some options to do that: https://t.co/B3iuXrxOpt @cspanwj
Gordon: We need to replace the #debtlimit with a mechanism that is better connected to tax and spending decisions: https://t.co/B3iuXrxOpt
Gordon: The natural course of the budget is leading towards larger deficits unless we reform taxes and spending.
RT @cspanwj: Joshua Gordon, Policy Director @ConcordC, talks #debtlimit &amp; the pending deadline to fund gov't for fiscal year 2016 https://t…
Gordon: If the the govt. cannot meet its obligations it would create global uncertainty and panic in the financial markets.
Gordon: It would be difficult to predict what payments would be prioritized if the #debtlimit is not raised.
Gordon: Defaulting on government obligations send a signal to markets that govt. debt is no longer a very safe investment.
Gordon: Even if we miss payments for a day or 2, that will be considered a default.
Gordon: We can't say to our creditors we are not paying the bills this month. We need to meet our obligations. https://t.co/B3iuXrxOpt
Gordon: The need to raise the #debtlimit is based on spending and tax decisions lawmakers have already made, sometimes decades ago.
Gordon: No one knows when @USTreasury will be unable to pay its bills. That's why it's so important to address this issue ASAP.
Gordon: Raising the #debtlimit is just authorizing the government to pay its bills.
Gordon: The #debtlimit has no connection to the federal government's tax and spending policies. Read our explainer: https://t.co/B3iuXrxOpt

.@LindseyGrahamSC: Not acting now on the debt is a choice in itself, one that does not look out for future generations. #FiscalFriday
.@LindseyGrahamSC: The best approach to fix the budget is a grand bargain. Both parties have to give a little bit. #FiscalFriday
@LindseyGrahamSC: On tax reform, I would use a Simpson-Bowles approach, eliminate deductions and loopholes.
@LindseyGrahamSC: We may have to ask younger generations to delay retirement to help retirement and health care programs. #FiscalFriday
.@LindseyGrahamSC: To help Medicare and Social Security remain solvent, we should mean test benefits for wealthier Americans.
