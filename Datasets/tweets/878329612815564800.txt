@Tmporterjr @KamalaHarris @RealNoraC But also - many folks r feeling the pinch of many years of wages not rising as fast as inflation, loss of jobs, etc.		&amp; the flip side of this is that if folks wake up &amp; live below their means&amp; if loans are approved properly, it'll mean A LOT less money being spent in the economy.
@Tmporterjr @KamalaHarris @RealNoraC Tom - I agree that some loans were given to folks who *maybe* shouldn't have gotten them, and that some (or many people) *maybe* are living beyond their means.		However, we do 3/4 of the country living paycheck-to-paycheck (not all poor)  So....1?

@huangmiller So what does that take?  Is it a leg change, or a change to state constitution?		Also - is it even possible to have house members lobby for a bill for CA to get back the same amount it puts into the Fed Gov?
@huangmiller Dude - I've watched a few hours of him on 60 Minutes, Morning Joe, etc.  He's all over the place.  Any inspection of his ideas (vague as they are), you realize he contradicts himself left and right.		System is broken &amp; it'll magically disappear if he just gets people in a room?

@R_Love317 @huangmiller You're lecturing me, when you won't even consider the findings of the CBO about the TaxScam debt?  		Okay - we're done here.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller And REAL WAGES aren't.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller TaxScam written by 6k+ lobbyists, no Dem amendments even considered, given to lawmakers at last possible minute(no reviews), passed in dead of night.		&amp; GOP lawmakers FLOODED w/ millions in donations before &amp; after.		Our Congress hard at work		https://t.co/cljF3kjjIb
@R_Love317 @huangmiller So you reject what the CBO and nearly every credible source has said about this tax bill adding 1.5-2.0+ TRILLION to the deficit?
@R_Love317 @huangmiller There was never any intention of including Dems in the process, and every Dem amendment that could have tied the tax breaks to substantive things (higher wages, more jobs, etc.), was shot down.		The bill was written in secret by lobbyists, then passed in the dead of night.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller Big banks/companies did surveys before TaxScam, and companies told us where the majority of the money would be spent - and that's where they are spending.  No significant increase in CapEx or wages, which aren't even matching inflation.		And we get more debt now.  Woo-hoo!
@R_Love317 @huangmiller Obama inherited the worst recession since the GD, and he brought us out of it, and the auto bailout ended up paying for itself and saving American jobs.  We'll see if the Fed easy money comes back to haunt us, but let's not act like he inherited something great.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller Obama had several stimulus packages, including one that dropped the corp tax rate and taxes on working Americans, a 1T infrastructure project, etc. - every single one shot down by a GOP House hijacked by the far right.		Yellen practically shouting that Congress needed to do more.
@huangmiller @R_Love317 Do we really know the final figure on this yet?  U of Penn/others think it will be 2+T, not to mention we don't really know the effects of the new loopholes, do we?		&amp; I thought that 1.5T was without middle class cuts being permanent - how much more does that add if they r perm.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller There was definitely an uptick in growth after Trump was elected.  I'm not saying that was the only reason, just that it contributed.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller Lol - the GOP didn't make the middle class cuts permanent, because they had to get it through Congress with only 50 votes.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller And let's not forget - Obama had several quarters of 4% or more GDP growth, along with a bunch of 3+% GDP growth quarters.		GOP used this same logic in KS, and it failed the state miserably.  Why you are seeing GOP defections there and a Dem Gov.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller GDP growth increased partially due 2 the stimulus, but also because worldwide GDP growth increased - much more important.		And nearly every economist - including those at major banks - said that tax bill would add a GDP boost that would quickly fade, and that's what we're seeing.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller So process this - GOP added a crapload to the deficit, and cuts for most middle class Americans are TEMPORARY.  The cuts for corps who were sitting on 2.3 trillion IN cash, along with the ultra rich=PERMANENT		If there was ever a document that described current GOP, this is it.
@R_Love317 @huangmiller 1.5 TRILLION=conservative est of debt.  U of Penn/others put the debt at 2+ TRILLION.  		That's WITHOUT considering the new loopholes added, &amp; NONE of the old loopholes closed, which was an initial promise.		&amp; middle class cuts=TEMPORARY.  So if they are extended=MORE DEBT

@Antamania1 @Reuters She can win - this shit is a nothing burger compared to the heaping pile of crap elsewhere.  it's one issue they are compounding into dozens of stories.		Dem primaries will vet the candidates based on ideas, as it should be.  And if that one lie matters,  it'll matter then.
@Antamania1 @Reuters More than 20 #MeToo women credibly accused Trump of sexual assault. One of rape as a minor.  Some teen USA.  They demanded an investigation, and MSM blew it off, because every day is a new horror show.		What a joke
@Antamania1 @Reuters But they forget about the horrid stuff he does constantly. So much stuff buried already.		THOUSANDS of kids deliberately separated from parents, 4 life possibly the admin just admitted &amp; MSM yawns.		People knowing =1 thing. Beating a relatively minor issue into the ground=another

@huangmiller This whole immigration nuttiness is what drives me nuts about our political environment.  		Too many issues should wind up in bipartisan solutions, but a small faction can't act like adults, and we get this clown show.
@huangmiller And take my word on it - you are much mentally healthier person as a result.		Folks have talked about how many reality shows run their course, and people just become disinterested - I think many are reaching that point with Trump.
@huangmiller I'd be up for 5 B in border security as long as it goes toward the things HS/Border Patrol say we need.  That would be great, and I think Dems are already there.		I think Dems should push for things in return.  Not sure  if that will happen.
@huangmiller I'm all for any bipartisan deals.  They have a few sitting around, and could resurrect those.		I think he's just going to lie his way out of it and say either the wall is already built or they'll call whatever new funding he gets the beginning.
@huangmiller I think MSM does a disservice to just air a speech without live fact checking.  Not just for Trump, but for any president.   I would prefer that.
@huangmiller If I remember correctly, I think there were chuckles in the crowds.  Some smiles from Dems, too.		And yeah - one of the few times I bothered to text friends/family during the speech.		It was hard to focus on it.
@huangmiller Trump's major decisions these past few months have been influenced by Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity (&amp; Tucker), Putin, and Rudy Giuliani (and friends).		That's where we're at.
@huangmiller B - Trump/far right don't really want a solution.  They want endless culture war that demonizes immigrants/POC.  		As Patrick pointed out, they had much more $$,  &amp; Trump wouldn't do a straight DACA trade.  They went for unrealistic, nutso demands.  No way they'd go 4 this deal.
@huangmiller A - we shouldn't be wasting 5 billion on part of something nobody (even most R's) believe is efficient/not a waste of $$.  They are already over nearly double what they should be spending (their 30 B budget probably gonna run way more - shocker).
@huangmiller It seemed like every other sentence was a lie, half-truth, or deliberate spin of the facts/basis of facts.		But that's where we are.   A man who lies constantly and is fully compromised is "running" our country, and the GOP applauds whatever he says, like lackies.

@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets Even in SF or NYC, folks making 10 million/year are pretty well off.  And again, their first 10 million is unaffected.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets But raising the wages on the rich (10 million/yr), IMO, is the elephant in the room.  Most Americans could use tax cuts, help w/ child care, etc, but we have a ballooning debt. Part of solution is higher taxes on folks who have reaped the most gains over the past 40 yrs...IMO
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets Yes, I agree.  Middle class is hard to define in terms of a dollar amount.  You're spot on about regions - 250k doesn't get you very far in NYC.  		I'm generally not in favor of raising taxes on most Americans and am in favor or getting breaks for the 90% of American families.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets In the chart above, the "middle 40%" got a substantially less percentage of the wealth gains since the 1980's - that's what I'm talking about.  You could say the bottom 90% of the country, and that would be fine - the point is the same.  They've gotten little of the gains.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets More than 10 million/yr = rich		Do you agree?  And again - if you're fine with not taxing these folks, it's ur right.		But I'm siding with the majority of Americans on this.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets for the purposes of our debate - I did.		10 million (or more)/yr = rich
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets When I say "thriving middle class" - I mean the cost of a car, education, rent/mortgage, etc.=much higher % of income, cuz the GDP gains have been top heavy.  Folks can't afford to not have 2-income households, 3/4 of America living paycheck-to-paycheck, etc.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets And again - if you don't make more than 10 million/yr, you won't be affected.  		If you define the middle class as making more than 10 million/yr or u don't think making more than 10 mill/yr is rich - that's fine.  We can agree to disagree.
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets The chart defines where most of the money has gone. 0.1% of the world's richest people own a huge percentage of the wealth - US is no different.		U can disagree - it's ur right.  But ur in the minority of Americans.		FOX poll - 70% favor what AOC proposes		https://t.co/uNMSBdhJ44
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets Our country had a HIGHER marginal tax rate 4 decades, and we thrived and had a thriving middle class.		For the past 40 years of trickle down BS, the richest of the rich have reaped all the gains in GDP.		What AOC is proposing is mild compare to how the rich have fleeced America. https://t.co/ZtSz0Gw9yU
@Tmporterjr @joncoopertweets It's a marginal tax rate.  The money AFTER 10 million dollars gets taxed 70%, not before.  So like I asked u - are u making more than 10 million?  If not, it doesn't affect you.		If u wish to fight for the ultra-rich, have at it.  But that's not what ur original statement was.

@huangmiller Stephen - I deleted a number of tweets, 'cuz I tweeted too much - sorry about that.  But I waned you to have enough of a sense as to why many are not digging Howard.
@huangmiller Finally found it - on his wiki page, June 2018 interview - he wants to go after entitlements to pay for the deficit.		And of course, that's nowhere to be found in this rollout.
@huangmiller Not to mention America has had a marginal tax rate HIGHER THAN 70%, and we were a pretty damn successful country during that time.		What joke of a statement that is.  It's not even an attempt at an intellectual conversation.
RT @scottRothman: @HowardSchultz @WSJ Dude, you haven't even put forth a single piece of policy.  It's just generic talking points over and‚Ä¶
@huangmiller Schultz called the 70% marginal tax rate "un-American" &amp; that America 'doesn't want that' when TWO recent polls show that it's popular, including a FOX News poll w/ 70% for the hike.		He's done this w/ a few issues, seeming either wrong, out of touch, or intellectually dishonest.
@SenrabG @DerrickGaffney @huangmiller Let's hope so.
@huangmiller Funny how Dems elected an historic # of candidates who won't accept corp  PAC money, vow to repeal Trump's tax cuts in favor of middle class  benefits/cuts, discuss higher rates 4 uber rich, etc.  &amp; all of the sudden - "the party has left him" - lol
@huangmiller Bloomberg has the guts to debate/campaign &amp; test his merit, instead of running a vanity campaign 2 re-elect Trump.		Howard claiming false equivalency between Dems who have been fighting like mad 4 working class families/electing great new blood &amp; R's is intellectually dishonest.
@huangmiller &amp; Schultz says Dems are being dishonest, yet he promises vague, great things while also talking about the deficit but then not committing to taxing the rich.  So where does the $$$ come from for all this new, good stuff or reducing the deficit?  Are things going to be cut now?
@huangmiller I watched the 60 Minutes interview again, and I've watched roughly 2 hours between Schultz, Schmidt, &amp; Burton, and it's maddeningly lame &amp; often intellectually dishonest.  NOT ONE new idea.  It's all nice-sounding vague statements, w/ no vision of how to implement them.
