@FrankJPaladino Good point
@BMLewis2 So I would argue that YOU are perhaps better at sensing downturns than economists or economic journalists are. People in business see trends before the statistics beat them out
@BMLewis2 I appreciate the engagement :-)
Trump tries to clarify comments about Warmbier's death after firestorm https://t.co/rgf1yPuXeR
@BMLewis2 I think this is your opinion, and his differs from yours. I‚Äôm not sure the economic stats you cite point to a recession. They might. I speak to people with varied opinions but he‚Äôs right, you can every see the start of a recession and an expansion better in the rear view mirror
@RibelleGS Ok but you understand that was the entire point of my question: gun advocates thing that if you give a finger then they will take your own arm, and he was stating an example of why.
@BMLewis2 Why were you disappointed in the segment? And would you be disappointed in any segment in which I am not tearing him apart?
@RibelleGS That actually not what he said. He was answering a very specific question about why gun advocates resist legislation. I find it instructive to listen to those who‚Äôs opinions I don‚Äôt share
@51PercentofUS I think with gun control we need to triage the issue, and transfers between family members aren‚Äôt at the top of the list of problematic gun transfers. It useful to consider what is possible rather than the whole wish list

@craigblanton It‚Äôs irrelevant. Health care is measured as a per capita cost. Per capita, America spends more for similar or worse outcomes. What ELSE we spend on has no bearing on bad healthcare spending decisions
@craigblanton ALL other OECD countries pay less per capita than the U.S. so this argument holds no water. Universal health coverage is, in total sum, substantially CHEAPER than what we do in the U.S.

@CarmineSabia I would suggest before you engage with me further, you do read up a little. Your name calling and misunderstanding of economics is revealing
@CarmineSabia Finally, as for moving the goalposts, I‚Äôm curious as to why the conversation of 13,000 manufacturing workers, which became 1,300 manufacturing workers plus a bunch of ‚Äúknowledge workers‚Äù (engineers), is now about a ‚Äúplant‚Äù
@CarmineSabia And getting 13,000 x $315,000 in incentives is not profit
@CarmineSabia It if not the responsibility of Wisconsin workers to enhance the profitability of a Taiwanese company that thinks Chinese workers earn too much money
@CarmineSabia You clearly don‚Äôt understand this issue, or my history as a pro-business journalist. The subsidies for this plant were to total $315k PER WORKER, with a 25+ yr payoff. That‚Äôs IF they brought 13k MANUFACTURING workers. Now they‚Äôre talking about a ‚Äúplant‚Äù; no mention of workers.
@CarmineSabia This may be the worst incentive deal ever made. Do you understand Foxconn? They think CHINESE labor is too expensive, and they promised to build a factory in Harrisburg in 2013. It‚Äôs a waste of taxpayer money even if it DID get built. Please read up before responding
@CarmineSabia It may age better than you think. No mention from either WH or Foxconn about jobs. Just a plant

@louagb @BellaAugust4 @lyn_cade Yeah I understand who the ‚Äúyou‚Äù was  in your tweet. But thanks for clarifying :-)
@louagb @BellaAugust4 @lyn_cade In fact, those reasons are exactly the ones he stated. No one said anything about women, angry or black, and no one said anything about Kamala Harris. I‚Äôve never known her to be angry so I made no assumption he might be talking about her
@Kristina_Why @CharlesStark3 @lyn_cade Maybe you don‚Äôt, but I talk to people - with different perspectives - for a living, and I don‚Äôt assume that if someone has a different perspective that they aren‚Äôt worth listening to.
@CharlesStark3 @lyn_cade Yes you are correct

@illbedamed @Lawrence @SRuhle @CNNPolitics @maddow @jaketapper @donlemon @wolfblitzer @chrislhayes @ChrisCuomo @nytpolitics @washingtonpost @business These numbers come from the Bureau of Labor Statistic. They are accurate
@15mo0904 The unemployment rate has a shifting denominator.

@CMichaelBenavi1 There were lots of full-time jobs created. It‚Äôs a good report

@NatHale1776 @SRuhle @MSNBC The jobs are seasonally adjusted.
@onmalecon @Mellemental Correct

@msnavlin This is seasonally adjusted. These numbers tend to be accurate

@bogeymon Perfect example was last year with Maria. We as information onnth ground from our reporters that DIRECTLY contradicted what Brock Long and Trump were saying. Being in situ as an anchor gives you a certain subject authority you can‚Äôt get remotely
@bogeymon Ah you actually hit on something I just tweeted to you. The holding power to account before, during and after a disaster is a role national media can play. Also in Katrina and Maria, being able to bear witness on a national stage is crucial
@bogeymon We have many people who watch us who then call relatives who actually HAVEN‚ÄôT been watching local news. Particularly people of fewer means. We also hold authorities to account (like FEMA) in a way local news can‚Äôt

@lyn_cade @monsoon2112 @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Ok I‚Äôm going to stop you all before you get carried away. You may have valid criticisms, but they aren‚Äôt of ME. I didn‚Äôt do ANY of this during the campaign - or since. In fact....I wasn‚Äôt on MSNBC during the campaign. I started a couple of weeks before the election.
@blucaller I‚Äôm engaging folks in real discussion. If you just want to criticize without engaging then I‚Äôm not all that interested. If you think what I do is lazy journalism, watch someone else. You have lots of choices
@CynthiaCozzo I reported entirely truthfully. If you have some actual criticism I‚Äôd be happy to discuss it, but there was nothing untruthful, innacurate or misleading about what I reported. That you don‚Äôt like Bernie doesn‚Äôt nullify the association between the candidate and Bernie.
@CynthiaCozzo @DebraMessing No, actually, I‚Äôm not missing the point. Sorry you don‚Äôt like the facts, but I‚Äôm actually all about reporting facts. My signature segment is actually called ‚ÄúFor Facts Sake.‚Äù I said nothing remotely incorrect tonight, and I have closely examined Gillum‚Äôs policies
@blucaller @MinnesotaKix And WEEKS before Bernie endorsed him, I had Gillum on my show because he was so compelling
@NovusNegrimLLG @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Well now that we‚Äôve been through this little storm, we‚Äôre friend, so keep it coming
@DeeTx1953 @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Discussion is never futile :-)
@MinnesotaKix @blucaller @MarvinKey74 Right I totally see or point but I didn‚Äôt choose a random binary. Bernie ACTUALLY backed one candidate, and Trump backed the other.
@msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @lyn_cade @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I appreciate you watching my show! And all of your feedback
@NorquistNemesis @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm saying Americans as a whole know Bernie more than the others
@upanatm @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC When, exactly, did I claim ‚Äúit was all due to Bernie‚Äù? I called him a ‚ÄúBernie Sanders backed‚Äù candidate. So tell me when I said what you said I did, because I didn‚Äôt
@NovusNegrimLLG @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Ok I tell you what...for the effort you have brought to this discussion, I‚Äôm going to bring it EXTRA tomorrow. I appreciate you bringing the thunder to this debate
@blucaller @MinnesotaKix No and I said as much on TV tonight - that it could have been youth or the gun campaign or his policies. That people read so much into ‚ÄúBernie Sanders backed‚Äù kind of amazes me.
@CynthiaCozzo I did interview he candidate about his policy platform...weeks ago
@DebraMessing Actually I think his platform aligns more closely with Bernie. He‚Äôs far more progressive than Hilary on matters like healthcare, which is a big one. The descriptor is accurate. I interviewed Gillum about his progressive policies some weeks ago
@NovusNegrimLLG @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I‚Äôm not the media at large so I‚Äôm happy for your criticisms of what I do, but I‚Äôm not going to answer for what everyone else does
@NovusNegrimLLG @lyn_cade @msleen1970 @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Have you ever listened to my stuff? I don‚Äôt do any of what you seem to annoyed by
@Grandmomsshadow @11thHour Right and many weeks ago, before Bernie endorsed him, I interviewed him because I found him quite compelling. So I know that there are several reasons for his win. The contrast of a progressive, Bernie-backed candidate with a conservative, Trump-backed candidate is interesting
@NorquistNemesis @msleen1970 @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I agree it‚Äôs constructive criticism and short descriptors never really do as much as longer, more nuanced discussions, which we actually had on TV about this tonight
@blucaller @MarvinKey74 @MinnesotaKix It really isn‚Äôt a sexy narrative. I really was just using a short and accurate descriptor to contrast Gillum with a Trump-backed candidate
@NorquistNemesis @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC You really think more people know Steyer, Soros and Castro more than they know Bernie Sanders? I think we are just going to have to agree to disagree on that one
@MinnesotaKix @blucaller Feedback is essential to sign able to understand and serve my viewership. Thanks for the criticism
@MinnesotaKix @blucaller Mistakes! I make more mistakes than you do!
@Violetskyye @MrDane1982 @HoarseWisperer @McBlondeLand @NovusNegrimLLG @MSNBC Actually, for candidates that otherwise aren‚Äôt nationally known, I think it‚Äôs always the case. For instance we described DeSantis as A Trump-backed candidate.
@vzlui Pushback is necessary to the proper functioning of democracy, and to my ability to do my job. Hearing thee strong opinions helps, so thank you. And good night
@lyn_cade @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I think the question of who is the standard-bearer for progressivism is a great discussion. I haven‚Äôt decided anything, and this is all about one single tweet that neither ‚Äúthe media‚Äù nor MSNBC wrote - I did, based on a fact that some people don‚Äôt like
@MinnesotaKix @blucaller I probably make more than you do! But this wasn‚Äôt a mistake. It was an accurate descriptor that inadvertently touched a nerve with many people. That doesn‚Äôt make it inaccurate, and I‚Äôm in the business of accurate. I appreciate your engaging.
@SparkleTea If you watch my interview with Bernie from a few weeks ago you‚Äôll note that I challenged him on why he isn‚Äôt a demcrat and on the success of candidates he backs. And I interviewed Andrew Gillum as a progressive candidate weeks ago
@BRT_Austin @HoarseWisperer @McBlondeLand @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I think that‚Äôs entirely possible and it‚Äôs something Kornacke and I discussed on TV tonight. Again, I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúBernie-backed and that‚Äôs why he won‚Äù
@MinnesotaKix @blucaller Wow you went from liking me before 10pm calling me a divider to saying I‚Äôm promoting a discrete agenda. What‚Äôs next?
@msleen1970 @NorquistNemesis @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 He WAS a Bernie-backed candidate! He thanked Bernie for the support tonight. It doesn‚Äôt mean he won because of Bernie and I didn‚Äôt remotely suggest otherwise. I interviewed him weeks ago to discuss his policies. You are reading WAY too much into ‚ÄúBernie-backed‚Äù
@MinnesotaKix Backing. Autocorrect
@MinnesotaKix Why don‚Äôt you watch the interview before you continue down this road. You are upset with someone or something but it ought not be directed at me. I didn‚Äôt say anything incorrect or misleading. If you have an issue with Bernie endorsing Gillum, take it up with them
@MinnesotaKix Bernie Sanders exists. Bernie Sanders (and others) endorsed Andrew Gillum. Gillum won, and thanked Sanders. I said NOTHING even remotely resembling what you suggest. Please don‚Äôt read your concerns with the media writ large into my entirely accurate comment
@blucaller @MinnesotaKix I didn‚Äôt suggest all progressives are BernieBros. I said Andrew Gillum was Bernie-backed. Which he was.
@msleen1970 @NorquistNemesis @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC So...if I don‚Äôt agree with you, I lose? That‚Äôs an interesting way to approach dialogue. What does agreeing with you look like? Saying he wasn‚Äôt a Bernie-backed Democrat?
@HoarseWisperer @McBlondeLand @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I‚Äôm not in rhetorical corner. You have a view of what I meant that isn‚Äôt what I meant and you have more energy for this argument than I do after anchoring 3 shows today, because I have 3 shows tomorrow, too. And I need to go to sleep now.
@MinnesotaKix Sigh. I simply meant he was a progressive democrat running against a Trump-backed Republican. I think Bernie‚Äôs hacking was influential. I have no idea whether it was central. I had a great interview with Gillum several weeks before Bernie‚Äôs endorsement
@lyn_cade @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Gillum May have backed Clinton but his political views are very progressive. Being backed by Bernie does imply that they share political views, and that was the point I was making: that a progressive was running against a Trump-backed candidate. I was deliberate with my words
@MinnesotaKix What part was biased?
@HoarseWisperer @jccmakai @msemmajameson @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I think we can respectfully conclude this discussion. You‚Äôve made your points and I‚Äôve made mine. I‚Äôve heard yours and I hope you‚Äôve heard mine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve deserved your criticism but you are entitled to it. Thank you for engaging
@msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC You may be right
@KarenCisMe @kate_hess @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC That‚Äôs possible, too.
@NorquistNemesis @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Because people know Bernie more than they know Steyer and Soros.
@HoarseWisperer @McBlondeLand @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But I get your point and I hope you get mine.
@tzeggers @msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I have a perfectly good answer which I‚Äôve now stated several times. Being Bernie-backed implies progressive attitudes, versus being Trump-backed, which doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what I meant by it. It‚Äôs not more complicated than that.
@lyn_cade @msleen1970 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC You‚Äôre right. I did challenge Bernie. I didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs ‚Äúso influential‚Äù. I said Gillum was Bernie-backed, to illustrate that he was, politically, the opposite of DeSantis. Gillum thanked Bernie for his support.
@HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúGillum won because of Bernie‚Äù. I was drawing a distinction about his politics, which are progressive, and DeSantis‚Äô, which are conservative. I used the term ‚ÄúBernie-backed‚Äù. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs ALL I said about it on Twitter.
@angelsfabulous1 @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Not only do I not want to die on it, I don‚Äôt even know how I got into a fight on it. Saying Bernie supported Gillum - which he did - is a fact, and doesn‚Äôt negate any other facts that caused him to win. I interviewed him WEEKS ago because he was a compelling candidate
@sephius1999 @Deoliver47 @marcushjohnson @MrDane1982 What do you make of the fact that he tweeted thanks to Bernie tonight, not Hilary?
@angelsfabulous1 @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC A point that Kornacke and I both made on TV
@HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I‚Äôm not going to continue this argument. Google ‚ÄúAndrew Gillum‚Äù and ‚ÄúAli Velshi‚Äù and you‚Äôll see I interviewed him weeks before Bernie‚Äôs endorsement because I thought he was a compelling underdog candidate. We discussed his chances and his funding and his progressive stances.
@NovusNegrimLLG @HoarseWisperer @MrDane1982 @MSNBC But I didn‚Äôt make the insurgent vs establishment argument. I used ‚ÄúBernie-backed‚Äù to mean progressive, as opposed to ‚ÄúTrump-backed‚Äù DeSantis. This whole argument about insurgent vs. establishment was NEVER brought up by me
@HoarseWisperer @McBlondeLand @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC No but it would mean those who say his mother wasn‚Äôt influential would be wrong. And those who say Bernie wasn‚Äôt influential would be wrong. So were a lot of other people, I imagine. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre treating it as zero-sum
@msemmajameson @HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I‚Äôm missing no point. He was Bernie-backed. I didn‚Äôt say he wouldn‚Äôt have won the election without Bernie. I didn‚Äôt say he was insurgent vs establishment. I didn‚Äôt say ANY of that. That he was Bernie-backed is a fact. He was also Soros-backed and Steyer-backed
@HoarseWisperer @NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC So, when a candidate gets an influential endorsement, it helps them, unless the candidate is black, in which case the endorsement isn‚Äôt worth anything? I think your argument is absurd. See Gillum‚Äôs tweets - he thanked Bernie Sanders
@MrDane1982 And who called him far left? I called him progressive
@MrDane1982 I‚Äôm not sure why you think being supported by Bernie Sanders somehow diminishes the fact that he is black, or the importance of that. You seem to be having this argument with yourself because I‚Äôm not arguing with you.
@NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC I hear you
@NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC He IS a Bernie-backed candidate. That‚Äôs a fact. Bernie came in late to support him, and Gillum surged late. That‚Äôs also a fact. You can deny Bernie‚Äôs influence all you want, but he‚Äôs influential
@lizfones @MSNBC We weren‚Äôt debating it. We were reporting it. Did you hear anyone on the panel arguing it was good?
@bj95432geemale @MrDane1982 Sorry my phone autocorrect the name
@NovusNegrimLLG @MrDane1982 @MSNBC Who said anything about establishment vs insurgency? My tweet was about a progressive vs a Trump backed candidate. You‚Äôre inventing a distinction I didn‚Äôt make
@MrDane1982 This is a weird criticism. I interviewed Gilliam weeks ago. There was ZERO implication in my tweet about race. And if you know my history, there would never be any
@blucaller @SteveKornacki What fact did we get wrong?
@RealSaavedra I led the segment with the fact that he got his gun in Maryland. Generally one leads with the most salient fact. Did that conveniently escape your notice?
@StephenGutowski Steve you do know that I led the segment with that fact, right? As in IT WAS THE FIRST THING I SAID. So who‚Äôs misleading whom?

@DocThompsonShow I totally get the point, which I made AT THE BEGINNING of the segment. Dana‚Äôs ‚Äúexcept‚Äù ignores that.

The ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù of not indicting a sitting president stems from a 1973 Justice Dept memo, re-affirmed in 2000. But some legal experts say there are at least a couple of ways Trump COULD be indicted. I‚Äôm sitting in for Rachel on @maddow 9pET tonight. Join me for the discussion
@SyedOusman @SRuhle Yes, and she said so. Repeatedly. What would be gleaned from pressing this juror? She wasn‚Äôt holding back any information. The purpose of the interview was to have her tell my viewers what she experienced. She did that
@SyedOusman @SRuhle I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true if every interview I do, but I was quite satisfied with the questions I asked, and I appreciated her responses. She‚Äôs not a public official and my goal was to understand her thinking, not to criticize it

@CurtisHouck Reasonable people can disagree but to me mistakes and errors are one thing; fake news is deliberately misleading

@CurtisHouck Curtis I appreciate you pointing out the continued error. But where does an error become #fakenews to you? Do you think it was deliberate? Do you think I‚Äôm working toward some greater purpose? Sometimes a mistake is just...a mistake

@GCasale Read the tweet you sent. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how many times I yelled at the screen!‚Äù. Sounds agitated to me
@GCasale it's not hubris. If i'm causing you displeasure, which is what your prior tweet indicates, on a regular basis, don't watch.
@fred_guttenberg @RajeshKhullar8 @DVYancey For the record, @fred_guttenberg &amp; I have spoken before. HE knows I have the utmost respect for him. My viewers always benefit from his perspective, passion, compassion and analysis of the topic. Both of us enjoy our conversations and will continue to have them.
@DVYancey @RajeshKhullar8 @fred_guttenberg David my entire life is based on minute by minute audience response. My audience wants a lot of topics in short discussions. Hence I need to achieve a lot in short interviews. When we depart from that, we lose viewers
@Slam_poet @DVYancey I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Stephanie and I have covered shootings in general and Parkland in particular as much as or, arguably more, than anyone. One or both of us were on the scene of every major mass shooting and have spoken at length with victims, parents and teacher
@GCasale All of which is in the service of getting a lot covered in the allotted time. But since watching me causes you so much displeasure, perhaps you shouldn‚Äôt :-)
@GCasale I look at how I conduct interviews at least 3 times a day, in detail, after every show I do. We evaluate how each segment went. Our format - which is proven - determines how long we allocate for segments.
@ed_alca @Slam_poet @DVYancey I don‚Äôt have more time. I have one hour. Our very close study of our audience and our ratings indicate that viewers want more stories than we typically deliver in that hour. That means limited time per story, unless is it breaking news, which is standard for cable news.
@marklevinshow Mark is was corrected moments after it went to air. The process was correct - the numbers in each chamber were wrong.
@DVYancey @cissyotis You obviously don‚Äôt come from cable news :-)
@DVYancey I‚Äôm quite comfortable with how we manage our show. Perhaps if you were in the position of managing 7-8 topics that must be covered in an hour you would understand. The consequence of not doing so is to cancel other guests and not cover some stories
@GCasale I get a LOT of different stories in. If I can‚Äôt put time constraints on some discussions, the only choice is not to have them. I think the viewer benefits from having them but my time on air is limited. It‚Äôs not the guests‚Äô responsibility to manage time, but it is mine
@Slam_poet @DVYancey We have a limited amount of time and a LOT of news stories to cover. The guest is not bound by time, but I am. Sometimes I have to move the topic along
@ChrisWalock I believe that what the graphic said and I said - but if I didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre right

@hugs Yup that‚Äôs what I said
Stand by - we had two errors in the impeachment math that we just showed you. The House needs a SIMPLE majority to impeach and the Senate needs 2/3, as opposed to 60 votes. Apologies for the error and thanks to those who pointed it out
The argument that the Cohen payments were technical violations which don‚Äôt rise to the level of ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù required for impeachment misses the point that Cohen did it ‚Äúfor the principal purpose of influencing the election,‚Äù without which Trump may not have won
@AdedapoLinda @co_rapunzel4 @AndreaWNYC The judge was making a different point - that he COULD impose anything within the sentencing range of thwre wasn‚Äôt a deal. There was never any likelihood of consecutive sentences because it was a plea deal. The range is 46-63 months.

@ninanelly @SRuhle @kathygriffin @PressSec @michelleisawolf I was being ironic
@harmonyis1 @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle I‚Äôm not trying anything! Have you seen me express ANY opinion on @michelleisawolf? No. Because I haven‚Äôt.
@bee_langbein Yes we are covering this
@NYorkieGirl @pyfho @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle No, actually I didn‚Äôt. Read the tweet. I said a discussion about how we should think. You read into my tweet what you wanted to read. ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù was the thing
@bee_langbein @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle Well because it‚Äôs broader than her performance. I think it‚Äôs about the entire role of the event and the media‚Äôs relationship with the administrator. But I see the value in your phrasing
@JohnsonFree1 @GingerG93 @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle So there aren‚Äôt different sides to what the #WHCD is meant to accomplish? There‚Äôs no diversity on thought about anything anymore? We aren‚Äôt discussion Charlottesville. We are discussing a comedian at a dinner. You can‚Äôt even handle a difference of opinion on that?
@harmonyis1 @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle No one is telling you what to think. We are discussing different ways people think we should think about matters.
@sun_conure @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle Strange - the issue you state is the exact conversation we are going to have. Surprised you wouldn‚Äôt want to hear it and engage
@pyfho @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle How incredibly open-minded of you
@JohnsonFree1 @sivkate @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle Sooo...you wot tune in because we have lots of different views on issues on our shows. Anything but your OWN view is not acceptable on TV?
@bee_langbein @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle I engage in conversations with people who have different views on how we should think about things all the time. I‚Äôm quite comfortable with the opinions of others.
@ShawndelPuckett @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle The point you make will be part of our discussion
@GingerG93 @sarahkendzior @SRuhle @michelleisawolf @PressSec @VelshiRuhle Well then you seem to have ignored the fact that all the participants in this discussion are on different sides of it. So basically you are tuning out a robust debate
So @sarahkendzior will join @SRuhle &amp; me to discuss the value (or lack thereof) of the #WHCD, the 1st Amendment, how journalists &amp; the public should think about @michelleisawolf &amp; @PressSec. @VelshiRuhle 11aET
@MaryAliceBisho2 @tpabob46 @sarahkendzior Yes I entirely see that many look at the WHCD NOT as an event to promote journalism &amp; the 1st Amendment, but as a dress-up party to cozy up with the administration, whom we are supposed to be holding to account. But that issue should be relevant no matter who the President is
@tpabob46 @sarahkendzior Not even remotely touchy. It‚Äôs becoming sport today for journalists to broadly attack other journalists in the wake of the WHCD. I‚Äôm speaking up for those of us who DO speak truth to power every single day.
@JenniferHertzl2 @sarahkendzior Again, I ask you to point to anything derogatory I‚Äôve said about @michelleisawolf. Others have. I haven‚Äôt.

@ninanelly @michelleisawolf @PressSec @SRuhle When did a photograph become about being ‚Äúbesties‚Äù. Sometimes a photo is, well, just a photo.

@annmariespetaup @JohnRJohnson @MSNBC It‚Äôs THREE HOURS! Relax.
@RobertVorlon1 @CharlieD1951 It is my opinion that we can use this as an opportunity to discuss the plight &amp; future of the Syrian people. There is ZERO shortage of domestic political discussion on this or other channels. For 3 hours, I will talk about Syrians. That‚Äôs my choice so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do.
@RobertVorlon1 @CharlieD1951 Don‚Äôt like it? Change the channel
@BrendaWestcott2 @virgoLauraRN I‚Äôm not sure what you are talking about. No one is making me talk about anyone. I have chosen my guests and the topic and have specifically avoided talking about domestic politics today
@BrendaWestcott2 @virgoLauraRN Did you listen to my interview with General Scales? With Janine DiGiovanni?
@CharlieD1951 Talking Syria is not beating a dead horse; it‚Äôs about half a million innocent dead PEOPLE. If that‚Äôs not important to you, I‚Äôm sure some other cable channel is covering Trump.
@BrendaWestcott2 @virgoLauraRN Have you listened to any of my interviews? I‚Äôm talking about the Syrian people in almost ALL of them
@GiGicmka I have been doing that for years. I have visited those refugees in the streets of Istanbul, on the Syrian border, in Zaatari camp. I have advocated for those refugees and those inside Syria for years
@The_Big_Nothin @cenkuygur These are excellent questions
@JohnRJohnson @miles_mcmullin @MSNBC I think on that we are agreed
@pierremwest Context matters and I appreciate your message was not what you intended
@virgoLauraRN Can you find it in yourself NOT to make everything about Trump and allow a little coverage of the desperate Syrian people?
@jimpiasecki93 @JohnRJohnson @MSNBC You know I was IN Puerto Rico after the Hurricane and we have certainly covered it more than ANY of our competitors. And I have covered Syria for many years and in great detail
@JohnRJohnson @MSNBC Tomorrow we will talk about COHEN going to Prague. Today we are talking about Syria
@pierremwest @CNN She categorically did NOT agree
@pierremwest @CNN This is kind of a gross sentiment. For once in 7 years we are actually focused on the plight of the Syrian people.
@MaryEmilyOHara There are actually very few responses like this, thankfully.
@JohnRJohnson @MSNBC Perhaps the families of the close to half a million dead Syrians, and the millions of refugees &amp; internally displaced don‚Äôt share your view that it‚Äôs inconsequential
I‚Äôll lead @MSNBC coverage of the #Syria attacks from noon-3pET. Let me know what questions you want answered
BREAKING: UK PM THERESA May says she has authorised British forces to conduct co-ordinated &amp; targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime‚Äôs chemical weapons capability
BREAKING: Trump says precision strikes have been launched against strategic targets related to Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons capability in a joint operation with France and UK

@MrDaveHudson @cenkuygur A point I have made on TV several times
@cenkuygur You are right. U.S. mid-easy policy has been universally misguided. When I argue for intervention in Syria with the specific aim of protecting Syrians from Assad, that is consistent with what I‚Äôve always argued. And as you know I have worked outside of corporate media

@SK68TN @davidgura @chucktodd @KatyTurNBC @chrislhayes @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @JoeNBC If you think Al Jazeera is like RT or the KKK, you‚Äôre a kook
@rkadis I‚Äôll ask the same question: Have you ever tweeted someone when an Israeli has been on TV to ask that they put a Palestinian on? Can a Palestinian not be on without an Israeli?
@SK68TN Having worked for Al Jazeera, I don‚Äôt actually see a problem with it. If you watched Al Jazeera, perhaps you‚Äôd get a good view of the Middle East
@complainster Have you ever tweeted a complaint about hearing ONLY an Israeli voice on the news, and asked that Palestinian voices be heard? Have you tallied up Israeli vs. Palestinian voices on the news? Just curious is this is a comment about balance or about something else?
@doodlehedz @MSNBC It was neither random nor awkward. Hers was an important voice to hear on behalf of Palestinians. Did you have some specific complaint?
@RabbiJill @truahrabbis I believe we both want justice for Palestinians &amp; security for Israelis. But the Israelis just killed a Palestinian journalist wearing a ‚Äúpress‚Äù vest &amp; carrying a camera, &amp; 9 more people. Let‚Äôs not whitewash this by silencing angry Palesitinian voices.

Earlier I was struggling to find the stupid tweet of the day. Thanks for ending my hunt. https://t.co/tOo9iet8My
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx @CNN I have NEVER tweeted a conspiracy theory in my life. Those BS tweets about ‚Äúcrisis actors‚Äù got HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of retweets, and who knows how many views. Even Donald Trump Jr. retweeted it. THAT‚Äôs why OANN can‚Äôt be trusted &amp; shouldn‚Äôt be in the WH press corps
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx Do you believe Brian Ross believed that he had an incorrect story on his hands, the reporting of which might ruin his career? Do you, conversely, believe OANN believed the massacre survivors were actors?
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx @CNN It‚Äôs not a crap tweet; it was part of a vast and deliberate conspiracy to dishonestly undermine the legitimacy of massacre survivors. Dan, please tell me you understand the distinction.
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx An organization making a mistake is very different from an organization tweeting that the student survivors of a massacre are actors. One is a mistake, one is a conspiracy theory
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx I am a big believer in free speech. I did not call for the silencing of anyone. I am pointing out liars, conspiracy theorists and fake news purveyors. I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be with me on that
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx @CNN OANN, THIS WEEK, tweeted a story about the ‚Äúcrisis actors‚Äù. Dan, I usually enjoy conversations with you, but your defending OANN and comparing it to CNN and MSNBC is beneath you and a waste of my time to debate
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx Errors in reporting are not the same as deliberately peddling fake news and conspiracies. It would be best that you not conflate the two
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx On what basis could you ever call for NBC or MSNBC to be shut down or silenced? On the basis of opinion you don‚Äôt share? And please tell me what conspiracy theory-peddling news organization Obama called upon?
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx I have never objected to political views - including yours. But if you lied or peddled in conspiracy theories, I would. You should be objecting to lies and conspiracy theories, too, from the left or the right
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx With all due respect, OANN is not our competition; it is an organization that peddles in fake news and conspiracy theories. Americans should know that, and know that they have a place in the WH press room.
@dangainor @BruinMD @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx Encouraging economic activity is absolutely not shutting down free speech - it‚Äôs encouraging it. It‚Äôs letting people know how they can use their money to influence outcomes.
@dangainor @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx And I think, Dan, given our long and fruitful relationship, we should refrain from accusing each other of stuff.
@dangainor @BruinMD @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx My comment is not more complicated than that, and whatever you think of MSNBC, it does not engage in conspiracy theories
@dangainor @BruinMD @amiejennifer @Beth_iBelieve @amazon @NRATV @Visa @FedEx Dan, I‚Äôve never heard the world deplatform and I don‚Äôt know what it means. I think the public should know that organizations that spread fake news and conspiracy theories have a seat in the space limited White House &amp; that the president chose friendly outlets to ask questions
@dangainor @amazon @NRATV Im absolutely not. But I don‚Äôt understand why OANN has a space in the WH briefing room given that it lies, spreads conspiracy theories and fake news. And why take two of two questions from friendly networks?
@dangainor @amazon @NRATV Dan, old friend, I don‚Äôt work for a network that spreads conspiracy theories. And on a day when a SENIOR fmr Trump associate/campaign official/transition official/RNC staffer pleads guilty, it was cowardly of the President to dodge accountability by seeking out friendlies
