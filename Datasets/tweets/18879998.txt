(2) As an abuse survivor, I do not take such claims mildly. However, only foolish or evil people accept serious claims at face value without substantiation. If Dr Ford proves her case, I will gladly apologize for not believing her accusation. #MeToo

#Newt gets in on the action. Slows pace down by going back to Pakistan. #tcot #teaparty #gop #cnndebate
#Huntsman sounds a little too much like BHO on this one, in terms of Commander in Chief over listening to military. #tcot #teaparty #gop
#Romney and #Huntsman duking it out on Afghanistan. #tcot #teaparty #gop #cnndebate
#Romney and #Huntsman disagree on Afghan troop levels . #Huntsman calls out lack of end game. Isn't that BHO's fault? #tcot #gop #teaparty
Wonder if we can get a #toonucleartofail thread started? Tee hee :) #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
@DickMorrisTweet: I agree with Eileen on Bachmann ... and laughed out loud at Perry's trade zone idea. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Bachmann corrects #Perry again on Pakistan. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Bachmann says presence in Pakistan is critical for American security. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
Nice use of the word 'naive', #Bachmann. In reference to #Perry's statement on Pakistan funding. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Perry says Pakistan can't be trusted and shouldn't be funded at all. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
"Too nuclear to fail." Maybe this will be #NancyPelosi's new line. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Bachmann wants to continue aid to Pakistan, but derides #Obama for his approach. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Bachmann calls Pakistan "epicenter of terrorism". Talks of jihadist threat to nuclear sites & China's influence. #tcot #gop #teaparty
Finally an answer. Thanks #Huntsman. No nation-building. Drones instead. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
Expanded drone campaign in Pakistan? #Huntsman totally avoids question and talks about term limits. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Rand getting plenty of camera time, simply because of his obvious agitation. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
@Seth_wrestles: Cain very unclear. Avoids the question. Very weak on foreign policy.
#Cain says TSA should be "targeted identification." Tried to explain, but completely unclear. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Rand makes smart statement about profiling and danger to ordinary citizens. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
@Seth_wrestles Yes, Santorum supports profiling. He just didn't say so clearly.
@Santorum says profiling okay to protect people. #Rand going crazy. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
Are these guys talking about airport security? I don't think so. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Santorum says "find bomber, not bomb" in relation to TSA. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
Perry references Denver in relation to positive move toward privatizing TSA and gets crowd support. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Romney differentiates btwn crime and war in response to TSA pat-down question. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Huntsman not impressive, AS USUAL. Please drop out. #tcot #gop #teaparty #cnndebate
#Bachmann waffles. Talks about different technology and terrorism today. What does that mean? Pls clarify. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
#Paul compares #PatriotAct to police state. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
EXCELLENT return by #Newt. Huge applause. Says McVey was successful. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
#Paul predictably disagrees. Calls #PatriotAct unpatriotic and refers to founding fathers. Big applause. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
#Gingrich supports strengthening #PatriotAct to protect Americans. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
Ed Meese calls #PatriotAct a tool and asks whether extension is relevant. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
Bachmann pulling out all the stops in opener. Gets great applause. Heart strings & patriotism usually works. #tcot #cnndebate #teaparty #gop
