I fear that the breach of trust this represents for those who entrusted him with their votes and confidence cannot easily be recovered and the profound hurt those pictures evoke cannot easily be healed.
Governor Northam must search his heart to determine whether he can or should continue in office.
The question now is whether redemption and forgiveness are achievable under these circumstances and in the explosive racial environment of the Trump alt right era.
Governor Northam has acknowledged that he posed for that offensive picture, apologized and asserted that he no longer holds those racist views. I take him at his word.

Democrats should yield time to Rachel Mitchell. The GOP men brought her here for her expertise and to see if Kavanaugh is a sexual predator. Yet she sits quiet now. The fact they are silent during Dr. Ford's testimony but willing to protect the entitled judge says it all.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs sense of entitlement is stupefying.
Judicial temperament: Kavanaugh has shown who he is today. He is an angry, defensive, paranoid 53 year old who desperately needs therapy not a lifetime appointment on the highest court of the land.
What happened to Kavanaugh the neutral umpire and nice choir boy?
Lindsey Graham is embarrassing himself. He has played too much golf with POTUS.

The President‚Äôs damaging decision paves the way to an Iranian nuclear weapon and shatters U.S. credibility around the world.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford reiterated that ‚ÄúIran is not in material breach of the agreement, and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran.‚Äù
The leaders of all parties to the Iran deal, including many members of Trump‚Äôs own administration, maintain that Iran is in compliance.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has released ELEVEN verification and monitoring reports indicating that Iran has not violated the agreement, and the President has certified to Congress SIX times that Iran is in compliance.
It has reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium to no more than 300 kilograms enriched no higher than 3.67 percent, and submitted to continuous monitoring and inspections at its key nuclear facilities.
By every measure Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA. Iran has poured concrete into its plutonium reactor, reduced its centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104.
With today‚Äôs unilateral retreat, the President is now responsible for the fallout of the Iran deal. All of our allies, including President Macron &amp; Chancellor Merkel, pointed out that the agreement is working and warned that it would be deeply destructive for the US to withdraw.

Except for baguettes and wine I've never envied the French. Until today. Pres Macron gave the speech most Americans wish our own President could give. Inspirational, bold, a robust defense of democracy and a call to arms in its defense. Viva la France
On the Iran nuclear agreement Macron says build on it based on four pillars to get a more comprehensive accord. But build on it don't abandon it. Listening Donald?
Macron says we have to deal with climate change because "there is no planet B." The earth is all we have. Listening Donald?
Macron calls on US to meet the threats to democracy and freedom. The world counts on us. Fight for our values and against those who would destroy them. Avoid commercial wars and extreme nationalism and embrace science. Donald Trump are you listening?
Pres. Macron offers eloquent defense of freedom and liberty in French-accented English at joint session of Congress. Quel dommage our own president cannot/will not do the same.
Forget the kerfuffle about Dr Jackson's reported drinking habits and abusive management style. The issue is that he has no credentials to manage the VA and the millions of veterans it serves. Our veterans are not guinea pigs.

This is a page right out of President Trump‚Äôs playbook. Reinstating the Holman Rule is no empty threat by the Majority. Last year, they used it to attack the CBO. If they can justify political attacks on CBO - the nonpartisan Congressional scorekeeper ‚Äì no one is safe.
This archaic tool, also known as the Armageddon Rule, is nothing more than a backdoor way for Republicans to dismantle the federal workforce and carry out political vendettas at the expense of career civil servants.
Last night, without any public debate, House Republicans snuck into legislation the Holman Rule ‚Äì a cynical and dangerous attack on federal workers that allows Members of Congress to reduce the salaries of federal employees.		My full statement: 	https://t.co/ESA52LWkMT https://t.co/qXJHJwZOSt

McCabe's firing two days before his retirement is a cruel and sadistic act against a dedicated FBI official whose only fault is that he wouldn't compromise an investigation of Russian interference and influence. This is part of a conspiracy to undermine special counsel Mueller

The legislation also authorizes two new tranches of federal capital funding for WMATA.
$150 million per year would be available for capital expenses contingent upon a 50 percent match from the local jurisdictions. $50 million per year would be for operating expenses, $10 million of which would be dedicated to the WMATA IG.
Under our proposal, WMATA funding under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) would be reauthorized at $2 billion over 10 years beginning in FY2020.
This is a carrot-and-stick approach. As Metro adopts accountability, safety, and reliability standards, additional federal funds will be released.

Still waiting on the Speaker and Republicans in Congress to show some moral clarity and condemn the President‚Äôs remarks. But we know how this usually goes. The enabling continues.
Yet, despite this increasingly challenging environment, our federal employees continue to serve with dedication and distinction every day. They deserve better.
And to make matters even worse, the President has treated federal employees like his own rhetorical punching bag - hurling insults and falsehoods.
For too long Republicans in Congress have treated the federal workforce like a national piggy bank. They've endured three years of pay freezes, a government shutdown, sequestration cuts, furloughs, and a mindless across-the-board hiring freeze.

In the my district more than 24,000 tax filers claimed medical and dental expenses totaling nearly $259 million. 		https://t.co/dklWHlXZrQ
Fact: Trump tax plan would eliminate the deduction for medical and dental expenses, which would be catastrophic for the sickest and most vulnerable among us.
Fact: The GOP tax plan would eliminate the student loan interest deduction which more than 11.4 million students and parents claimed in 2014. #taxtownhall
Fact: Loudoun County, Fairfax County and Falls Church are all in the Top 10 in the country for claiming the mortgage interest deduction according to the Tax Foundation		https://t.co/lYd20GZ51J https://t.co/KnVXyGWxqI
Fact: #VA10 residents would be disproportionately hit by the Trump/Ryan plan that caps mortgage interest deduction. Loudoun County has the largest average deduction in the county at $6,365.	https://t.co/Uysx3ZUgkE
Fact: #VA10, where Speaker Ryan is holding his #TaxTownHall, ranks as the 6th highest congressional district claiming the SALT deduction. 51.7% of VA10 constituents would no longer be able to claim this deduction. https://t.co/4OqEUXun1y

POTUS should follow the most urgent rec of his Commission on Combating Drug Addiction &amp; the Opioid Crisis and declare a national emergency.
Every day, we are losing more than 91 of our friends and loved ones to an opioid overdose. This is unacceptable and we must do better.
POTUS should watch our opioid roundtable and see how it affects our local communities. 		https://t.co/rs2FOmBLGt
After months of waiting, Trump stops short of declaring opioid crisis a national emergency, opting instead for a public health emergency
IT should be seen as more than a commodity, it's a process that can realize efficiencies and savings.

Thanks everyone for coming out tonight and for all your great questions.
We should make the first 2 yrs of community college free.
We need to make college more affordable and more accessible. Let's expand Pell grants and allow people to refinance.
Q: what can we do about crushing student loan debt?
As co-chair of @SEEC we will oppose the Trump Administration's attacks on environment.
Govt has a positive role to play in incubating new technologies. Federal investment in wind/solar are paying off.
The fed govt must be a leader. Under the Obama Administration we made tremendous progress. Clean Power Plan, Paris Climate Agreement.
Q: does the federal government have a role in environmental protection?
And we need to resist the draconian cuts to EPA.
I will continue to work with all state and local stakeholders to make sure we have these same standards at Possum Point.
I fought hard for strong federal coal ash regulations and 30 yr groundwater monitoring.
Q: what can we do about the coal ash ponds at Possum Point?
I've introduce the SECURE Democracy Act with @RepEliotEngel that would hold those who interfered with our election accountable.
Q: will the House pass Russian sanctions?
I've introduced bipartisan legislation to provide that oversight. https://t.co/jnbn4EoHu9
The Iran deal is working. Every metric we set is being met. We need robust oversight of the deal to make sure they don't cheat.
Q: is the Iran deal working?
We need to make it easier to vote. My FAIR Act will streamline the process, make it easier to register, &amp; give states $ to update machines.
I want more people to do it. I've never missed an election. We need people to be more engaged in our democracy.
Q: what do you think about young people voting?
Background checks are supported by a majority of NRA members.
We had an assault weapons ban and it worked. I would not ban your right to have guns, but I would insist on a background check.
Q: how would an assault weapons ban impact Virginians?
So many of these young people are committed, successful, intelligent people. We need to keep this talented workforce.
If you were 2 years old &amp; your parents decided to come here, you didn't get a vote. You see yourself every bit as American as everyone else
Q: what can we do for DREAMers?
Can ACA be fixed? Yes. Let's encourage more companies to join exchanges. Find ways to bring more young people into the healthcare system
What's troubling is they have a group of 13 meeting behind closed doors, no hearings, no debate. This affects 20% of economy &amp;every American
Next Q: what are they doing on health care in the Senate?
Bloom where you're planted. Get involved. It's what we need if we are going to forge consensus and get past the vitriol.
Next Q: what can people do to help out in their community?
@RepRaskin With respect to @StateDept cuts, we know diplomacy solves problems. Trump's proposed cuts demonstrate a unilateral retreat.
Proud to lead a letter with @RepRaskin calling on Trump to protect federal employee retirement benefits.
It's going to be hard enough recruiting next gen of fed employees. We need to make federal service more attractive, not more attacks.
First Q: About protecting federal employees and foreign service.

Answer: WH had to derail FBI investigation now.
If Comey's firing isn't about Russia probe ask this: why today? Why not seek his resignation effective upon his successor's confirmation?
Time to revive Watergate vocabulary: obstruction, cover-up, suborn, conspiracy, inoperative, criminal conspiracy, independent prosecutor.
Republicans must finally join our call for special prosecutor. Only way to restore credibility.
Shades of Sat night massacre and Archibald Cox
If it were about previous misjudgements this would have happened in January. Rosenstein is an enabler and this is obstruction
Comey's removal is all about Russia and ongoing criminal investigations into Trump campaign aides.

We need science-based public policy, not a retreat to political-based beliefs when it comes to climate change &amp; clean energy investments.
We should embrace the economic growth and job creation that has resulted from American innovation and clean energy deployment.
Just as we did 47 years ago, America finds itself at a tipping point. Clean energy is no longer just an alternative, it is our future.
He's promised to roll back the Clean Power Plan and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. None of this will Make America Great Again.
He's filling his administration with climate-deniers. His budget would slash funding for the EPA by 31%.
DJT vowed to Make America Great Again, but his recent attacks on science and unilateral retreat on climate action will do just the opposite.
We have come a long way since the first celebration nearly a half century ago. As @SEEC co-chair I am committed to building on our progress.
