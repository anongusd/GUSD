The House voted to go to Conference on the NDAA, HR 5515. While different versions of this bill passed both Chambers, we still have to settle key differences. I hope the Conference Committee works swiftly on an agreed-to bill since it provides our Troops with critical resources.
Yesterday, the House considered HR 5094, the Enhancing Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative Act, which requires DHS to develop methods to better handle tips from the public about possible terrorist activities on American soil.  I‚Äôm proud to support these important reforms.
