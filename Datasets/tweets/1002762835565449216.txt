@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse .. Coordinating to switch parties and platforms.
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse Now that we can agree that it was mainly southern democrats and republicans against civil rights/minorities, we can begin our conversation on the Southern Strategy. Many southern democrat politicians groomed their successors to take over their positions whilst simultaneously ...
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse What? You must not have scrolled past the ‚ÄúStatistically Notable Votes‚Äù section.
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. All voted majority NAY and most of them are currently strongholds for the modern Republican Party. Understand now?
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse You‚Äôre missing a key component of why I added these vote counts. If you look at which states were overwhelmingly voting NAY they‚Äôre pretty much all southern states there are currently deep republican strongholds.
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse Look at the states that those votes came from! Almost all of them are from southern, modern-day deep Republican states..
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse You‚Äôre wrong, plain and simple.		https://t.co/7QKpn4kkZg		https://t.co/lUfMRt4qFz		You‚Äôre overgeneralizing a lot. Take a look at these vote counts and then look at which states the YEA and NAY votes actually come from. You‚Äôll notice that almost all NAY are from modern republicans
@VonSchmittou @KevinMKruse Lincoln was not for limited government or free-trade.. like I said, you need to check up on your history my friend. You‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs much more complicated than saying modern day republicans are Lincoln.
@VonSchmittou @todd_moye @lara9209 @KevinMKruse 1. No one said that they weren‚Äôt at one point the party of slavery and oppression of minorities.	2. You need to read up some more on the Civil Rights and the Civil Rights Act of 1964/ Southern Strategy.

@john3connor @HoodForGovernor There‚Äôs nothing that is as portable and efficient as guns/AR-15s. It‚Äôs the reason our military uses guns to fight and not knives.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Not true. When was the last time a fully automatic weapon was used in a mass shooting? Pretty much all of them are with semi-automatic AR-15s or something similar.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor That‚Äôs not true. There are regulations already in the law like automatic weapons are very hard to obtain. When was the last time we heard about a mass shooting with a fully automatic weapon? There are things that can be done to limit it.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor I get that, but it‚Äôs not about people being able to hurt people. It‚Äôs about how easy and efficient it is for bad people to hurt good people. We have to regulate it, not ban them.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Look into @espyforsenate bro. He has a good rating from the NRA. Doesn‚Äôt want to take all guns, just limit them and he‚Äôs a democrat.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor By that logic, should everyone be able to own a tank? If they start blowing up buildings with it should we blame just them or the tank too? We gotta stop it somewhere.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Most Dems agree too on that one.. most republican politicians don‚Äôt unfortunately. They‚Äôre way too deadly for normal citizens. Don‚Äôt want to take away people‚Äôs guns. Just want to make sure the right people get them and that they aren‚Äôt capable of outgunning the police..
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor We can‚Äôt elect the same party who‚Äôs been failing over and over in this state expecting things to get better. At least if we elect someone else there could be a chance. Don‚Äôt know till we try it.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Thought we were talking about Dem/Rep politicians not guns? Anyway, most gun violence is stopped by police. Also, look at this latest shooting in the Jewish synagogue. Guy brings in an AR and kills 11 people then when cops WITH guns show up he shoots 4 of them before they get him
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Um not sure how we got on this debate? Thought we were talking about Democrat and Republican politicians and how they serve their cities/states? Also, mass shootings don‚Äôt happen in Mississippi, but there is a significant amount of gun violence. Most just doesn‚Äôt result in death.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor You‚Äôll never have change if you don‚Äôt try something new my friend. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor As someone who has lived in Chicago, trust me when I say it‚Äôs not local politicians who fail the city. Also, other than Gun Violence Chicago is a great city. Most of the guns actually come from other states like Wisconsin or Indiana who have relaxed gun laws.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Umm I don‚Äôt know about that one. Cities? Maybe. States? Definitely not. The deepest Republican states (most of the south) are usually the worst in every main category. Worst in poverty, worst in infrastructure quality, worst in education, healthcare, highest lack of food rate.
@john3connor @HoodForGovernor Can it get any worse? I mean like you said ‚Äúit‚Äôll never happen‚Äù we‚Äôve had republicans in office for years and yet we‚Äôre still one of the worst off states in the country. Time to try something new? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@KassyDillon Stop trying to narrow the scope of her statement. There are so many more factors that go into safety for journalists than the government and you know that.
@mf_khulse @benshapiro No one would dispute that countries like Russia and China are worse off for journalists in regards to the government. However, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worse off from individual citizenry attacking and harassing them which is the key concern in today‚Äôs partisan climate.
@mf_khulse @benshapiro I see your point, but disagree with it. I‚Äôd be willing to bet they have tight security in their building. Journalists who venture out are much less safer because it‚Äôs much more unpredictable.
