Um, this "compromise" bill coming before the Senate this week is, shall we say, problematic. It extends DACA protections just extended by the Supreme Court while severely curtailing the ability to seek asylum. Won't get 60 votes, no how. https://t.co/QAbd1HLT1D
Court’s inaction almost certainly means it will not hear challenge in current term, which ends in June. The next conference to consider petitions seeking review is Feb. 15. Even were they to agree to hear the case, it would not be argued until after next term starts in October.
The Supreme Court once again devalued Trump's offer on his DACA-for-wall deal by not taking up the DACA review. That means the lower court's decision to keep DACA in place extends without Trump's deal.

With Medicaid expansion passing on referendums in Idaho, Nebraska &amp; Utah &amp; now with a chance in Wis. &amp; Kan. hard to say voters don’t want it. But in the biggest holdouts, TX, FL and Ga., expansion doesn’t look strong enough a lure to swing GOP, independent votes.

Point is, for all the people laughing at the notion that gender and sex can be scientifically complicated, well it can — even if you wish to dismiss gender identification as some sort of mental illness.
How about hermaphroditism? For all the world, you were born a girl only to develop ambiguous genitalia at puberty? Read Middlesex if you think this is fanciful.
How about if you have the not-that-unusual condition of an XXY chromosome? Or an XYY? Should the government decide your sex?
It feels pointless to discuss “science” with those shouting “binary” but let’s try. Forget feelings. What if you’ve had gender reassignment surgery and in almost every way but that Y chromosome, you’re female by cultural standards. Should you be in an all-male dorm or prison?

Relatively high marginal rates took a share of wealth growth for the richest of the rich and higher estate tax rates nabbed the wealth transfers of the very rich. Since then, Congress has lowered all of the rates that generated the last budget surpluses.

There was real worry that Christine Blasey Ford, inexperienced and under tremendous pressure, would become overly emotional, cry, grow angry and flustered. Then Brett Kavanaugh did it and it may have saved his confirmation. What a world.
.@SenTomCotton: “Judge Kavanaugh gave compelling testimony, with specific and detailed recollection. His testimony is corroborated by multiple other statements and evidence. The Democrats’ disgraceful smear campaign of character assassination must come to an end.”
@LamarAlexander “I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh because of his 26 years of distinguished public service and his reputation as a superior jurist, lawyer and teacher. Judge Kavanaugh denies under oath Dr. Ford’s account of an alleged incident 36 years ago."
@SteveDaines: "There is no corroborating evidence to support this serious allegation. Rather, this seems to be an orchestrated smear campaign intended to destroy Judge Kavanaugh at the eleventh hour. The Democrats turned this process into an embarrassing, political circus.”
For all the assessments of performance, the fact remains: Either Christine Blasey Ford or Brett Kavanaugh lied, repeatedly, under oath, about a terrible crime. Senators should tell their constituents which one they believe lied.
.@senrobportman makes his decision: I have known Judge Kavanaugh for more than 15 yrs, I know his wife Ashley, and I know his family.  The Brett Kavanaugh I know is a man of integrity and humility.  He also has the right qualifications and experience to serve on the Supreme Court

Where we stand, pool report, Helsinki, 2018: "We were lead into the Hall of Mirrors, a room adjoining the Gothic Hall where the one-on-one took place, at 4:28 p.m., and then ushered out one minute later.	The Russian and American delegations were seated across the table."

The responses to this tweet prove my point. Jeff Flake has been for low taxes, free markets and much less spending for decades. He wants a conservative judiciary and opposes abortion. He is pro-international trade. Why would he vote against those policies?

"...whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate. So I take great offense and I take great disagreement to your assertion of what that was or wasn't."
"and my presumption based on that horrible, disgusting behavior that the American population would not elect somebody demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States. It was in no way unequivocally any suggestion that me, the F.B.I., would take any action..."
His most surprising statement: "You need to understand that was written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then-candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero..."
I would not have guessed that Peter Strzok would have come in to this hearing ready to fight the Republicans this hard. Not sure if it confirms their charges of bias or wins the public to the side of the FBI. (Or just hardens partisan lines)
I think we can call this hearing to a close.
Going back to Oliver North, Republicans and Democrats in Congress should have learned long, long ago: The witness always wins.

@MarkSleboda1 Every president makes calculations on US strategic interests. Every president has made accommodations for the Saudis. No president has entertained the dictator of Kazakhstan — until now.
When he signed the Affordable Care Act, Obama said it wouldn’t add a penny to the deficit. Republicans failed to repeal it, but by suspending Obamacare tax hikes in the coming spending bill, they will ensure that it does raise the deficit.
Republican leaders promised that unified government under GOP control would bring order to the budget and appropriations process. The fiscal year began Oct. 1. Not a single spending bill has passed.
If this new stopgap spending bill passes (and I expect it will), Congress will still be struggling to find a way forward 5 months into the fiscal year. Promised defense spending increases would have to be crammed into last half of year.

@mpshapiro @SethHanlon Every tax rate cut but the top two was extended as was the doubled child credit, refundability and the marriage penalty change. That was like 90% of the cost.
@jamisonfoser Actually having covered passage of the 2001 tax cuts, the 2003 tax cuts, the 2010 extension and the 2012 fiscal cliff, I pretty much nailed it.
@turntxblue18 They had middle class tax cuts expire in 2025 to keep the 10-year cost below $1.5 t, banking that Dems will extend those.
@turntxblue18 Reconciliation rules under the 1974 Budget Act. The tax cut can't raise the deficit beyond the 10-year window &amp; must fit in the $1.5 t tax hole in the budget. Republicans decided to "pay for" only the tax cuts that Dems might end in 2027.
@mattyglesias We can use history to make logical predictions.
@BBKogan Yep, it is a choice borne of experience. Dems let tax cuts on the rich lapse, extended all the others. So this time Republicans chose carefully which to make permanent -- the ones that a Democratic president wouldn't keep.
@SethHanlon Where were you, Seth?
@SethHanlon Journalists who worked day and night from Christmas through New Years in 2012-13 speak from experience. We saw Obama &amp; the Dems let the top 2 brackets lapse, reinstated the estate tax (albeit a smaller one) but steadfastly refused to let taxes rise on incomes below $200k.
@soncharm It's unprecedented to cut taxes this deeply in the face of an aging population, increasing entitlement claims and rising deficits. It's a Thelma and Louise tax cut: the cliff is coming so slam on the accelerator.
People who use 2027 distribution tables to say tax plans hurt the middle class are being disingenuous. Tax writers had middle class tax cuts expire precisely because they know Congress will extend them. The damage is to the debt.
The fiscal cliff was just 4 yrs ago &amp; virtually every Bush tax cut was made permanent. No serious lawmaker can believe the middle class tax cuts in the Senate tax plan would be allowed to expire in 2025. Not one. @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake  https://t.co/SV7CC1pNl6

Health Care Debate: Obamacare Repeal Fails as McCain Votes No https://t.co/Tsf5dKjuIc
It's hard to tell a man with brain cancer what to do.
OMG, people, it's a quarter to 1 and you are all watching C-Span 2. Think about that.
Cornyn said hundreds of thousands of Texans remain w/o insurance despite ACA assurances of universal coverage. Texas did not expand Medicaid
Enzi, like Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, is one of those soft-spoken men who make you wonder how they got into politics in the 1st place.
Sad thing isn't that @SenatorEnzi won't answer Dem questions. They had their half hour. It's that poor Enzi is the only Republican speaking.
Reminder: @SenatorEnzi spent months negotiating with Finance Committee Dems and Repubs drafting Obamacare. He opposed it, but they did try.
The bill is a fraud &amp; a disaster &amp; will destroy the insurance market...but, heck, I'll vote for it because Trump can't strong-arm the House. https://t.co/5Q72lDPKAJ
Prediction: Skinny passes. House &amp; Senate agree to compromise. Following Ryan's wishes, it goes to Senate 1st. It fails. House passes skinny
So what @SpeakerRyan is saying is, if the conference report fails in the Senate, we reserve the right to pass the "skinny" in the House? https://t.co/1gyvWlAY56
@SpeakerRyan The conference then fails. But @realDonaldTrump demands that he get his signing ceremony. Senate bill is still live. So House passes it.
Play this out. @SpeakerRyan swears he will go to conference. Senate passes skinny repeal, despite understanding that it would be a disaster.
Just when thought ACA repeal push couldnt get weirder, senators say they'll vote for skinny repeal only if House GOP promises not to pass it
Patients groups, medical providers, AARP united in opposition to ACA repeal bills. The "skinny" has succeeded in bring in insurers as well.
The Skinny Repeal of the Affordable Care Act is taking shape in the Senate. https://t.co/Tsf5dKjuIc
Much-ballyhooed joint statement on tax reform basically just says Republicans in Congress and the White House want tax reform. We knew that.
