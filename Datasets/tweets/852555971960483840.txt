To conceal the victim‚Äôs immigration status from authorities, the defendants prohibited her from leaving their house, except to walk the children to school, and instructed her not to talk to anyone outside of the house and defendants‚Äô family.
The defendants required the victim to perform domestic work and childcare at their home seven days a week, paying her a mere $200 a month.

That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession.
The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year.
Federal revenues as a whole ran $200 billion behind the Congressional Budget Office‚Äôs forecast for the 2018 fiscal year ‚Äî even though economic growth was faster than the C.B.O. expected.
