@MZHemingway Perhaps if Acosta wasn’t so aggressive towards women doing there jobs, the President wouldn’t have to babysit Mr. Acosta.
@greggutfeld Happy days are here again Greg, long live President Trump!
@chuckwoolery @DBHnBuckhead2 Democrats continue to speak their magic, voters are stupid little people, lie to us long enough and Dems believe voters will believe the trash they are communicating to we the people.
@JudicialWatch Well ya, just think of what they left along the way, I sure didn’t see any restrooms, what do they do use the hand that feeds them, their own. Coming to a community near you.
@DiamondandSilk Liar,liar pants on fire

@dbongino 2nd Chronicles 7:14 hopefully the followers of Jesus Christ heed this passage. I certainly am looking for an America at peace with one another.

@IsraelUSAforevr (Justice), Vengeance is a meal serve cold. There is a book that is being kept for all our deeds, good or evil we all will be held accountable.
@IsraelUSAforevr Looks like a trail of decease to me.
@realDonaldTrump Don’t forget Mr. President to start with Mexico, I’m pretty sure they get America’s tax money also.
@RepMarkMeadows Why do you say this? American’s have watched FBI,DOJ and Political hacks lie to the tax payer for all to long and nothing ever happens to them. Well, I do realize that the Dems got Richard M.Nixon.

@MZHemingway @DBHnBuckhead2 How many millions are being wasted?
@Jim_Jordan @BarackObama Pathetic
@KatiePavlich Nice thing about Obama on TV is that I can turn the TV off.
@DiamondandSilk What Dems can’t seem to understand is President Trump is here for 6 more years and by then most of Dems will be out of office.
@DanRather @GiGicmka I thought you was dead Dan!
@guypbenson She’s not privileged! Now Clinton’s they’re privileged. Enough of the good olé boy or girl thinking. Voters deserve better.

@RepLeeZeldin @jeffsessions @Jim_Jordan @RepRooney @RepTedBudd @RepMattGaetz @RepMarkMeadows @replouiegohmert AG needs to be fired and replaced with someone that is capable of the job. This job is to big for Sessions
@BreitbartNews You have it wrong, just think how many lives were lost because of the Bushes!
@LouDobbs Not until President Trump fires him and appoints a righteous AG with zero interest in swampers
@Jim_Jordan @RepGoodlatte @TGowdySC America deserves the truth, AG is not doing the job the President expected him to do!
