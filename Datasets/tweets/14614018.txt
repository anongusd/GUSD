@m13812606 @bingboy @WRENetwork @PDXdrew Definitely. Some of the resources I'm reviewing define "affordable" childcare as less than 10% of income. Would you agree with that definition? Looking for some real-people reaction/feedback. Thanks!
@m13812606 @bingboy @WRENetwork @PDXdrew Correct. I paid ~$9k for my youngest when he was 4 years old (he's in 2nd grade now). Source for my statewide number: https://t.co/Cf6B8E06z2
@JoeCunninghamSC Absolutely! Happy to have a Congressman who gets it. With our workforce shortage, figuring out how to make it easier to access affordable, quality childcare could help us get the talent we need in the jobs we have available.
@JasperSmith8675 @WRENetwork That‚Äôs the state average. Many people - certainly in our neck of the woods - pay much more.
South Carolina average cost of childcare was $6840/year in 2017. I am looking forward to moderating a panel on the importance of childcare to women‚Äôs economic empowerment at @WRENetwork Annual Summit on April 1. https://t.co/q9WjIRgezS

@ALMLegalIntel reports #AmLaw100 revenue per lawyer is down 4% while profit per equity partner is up 16% between 2007-2017.
Prior to 2007, #AmLaw100 revenue growth was an exaggeration of GDP year-to-year variations. But post-2009 the exaggeration has disappeared. For 2017, revenues are 20% below where the economy suggests, projecting from the economic model that fit from 1994 to 2007. https://t.co/ikAvHgWDdt

@NancyFurmanPaul @LMAintl @BloombergLaw Ah. Ok. The original tweet said 17% "report to be part of." Glad it's over half participate. Still too low and certainly need to be actively engaged and not just attending the meetings. #LMAchat
@NancyFurmanPaul @PatrickRwrites The attorneys like the results of CRM but don't want to be power users themselves. They just want the output.
@NancyFurmanPaul @LMAintl @BloombergLaw So focus on client retention/engagement and increasing revenue are strategic priorities but only 17% of legal marketers are a part of strategic planning? Interesting. Who's figuring out the goals and activities to support those priorities if not the legal marketer? #LMAchat
@CarlSussmanNYC Good news! #LMAchat
@LMAintl @BloombergLaw Also speaks also to a larger point of firm's focus on billable hours and origination credits rather than client experience. #LMAchat

Salespeople in law firms have traditionally had to push their way in to client interaction, but panelists from Orrick, Womble, and Goodwin say they are being pulled in now much more often. The lawyers are understanding the value of the salespeople! #LMA18

Gaps in perception of working relationships - while both lawyers and marketers say respectful, collaborative, and supportive, marketers more often say challenging and unresponsive. #LMA18
The only segment of clients that marketers interact with more than attorneys is procurement professionals. Oh joy! #LMA18
Only 60% of Marketing respondents say they engage in direct business development (client facing) activities, including initiating client outreach, participating in pitch meetings, client feedback interviews. #LMA18
82% of firms with &gt;200 attorneys have a Chief Marketing title. Only 22% of smaller firms (6-199 lawyers) have Chiefs. #LMA18
Interesting to contemplate the gap between marketers and lawyers of effectiveness of coaching. Marketers see it as highly effective; attorneys rank it much lower. Maybe they aren‚Äôt including the coaching they get all the time from their internal marketing staff. #LMA18
On why the attorneys may have responded like they did to the survey, @erinmeszaros says it may be the result of marketers emphasis on relationship building. Firm-hosted events are more strategic now - e.g. who we invite, what topics we cover. #LMA18
In @BloombergLaw and @LMAintl research, lawyers said new activities they deemed effective were increasing social media efforts and hiring or increasing marketing staff. #LMA18
Areas deemed most effective in developing new business - client meetings and firm-hosted events. Followed by networking and cross selling. Then RFPs. #LMA18
Catalysts for increasing emphasis on business development - internal pressure to generate revenue, corporate counsel consolidating number of outside firms, competitive pressure. @LMAintl @BloombergLaw  research #LMA18

Perform random acts of kindness (volunteer, donate to charity, give a gift), spend money on the right things (yes to experiences and no on belongings), avoid comparisons, and build and maintain lose relationships (the most important). #LMA18
Smile, even when are you aren't happy. Fake it until you make it. Sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy. #LMA18
Strategies for increasing happiness, continued: Make a gratitude visit (someone who influenced your life in a profound way). Write them a letter, travel to that person, and read the letter aloud. #LMA18
Some strategies for increasing happiness: get enough sleep, exercise, spend time outside, meditate, find your match professionally and personally, read a book you love, keep a gratitude journal. #LMA18
The three components of happiness: pleasure (but least important because they are fleeting), engagement and anticipation (having something to look forward to is my definition of happiness), and meaning (doing things you find meaningful.) #LMA18
The quality of our relationships is the single best predictor of our happiness. Label of relationship doesn't matter - spouse, family members, friend. Just that it is meaningful in quality. #LMA18
As we grow up, we realize it is less important to have lots of friends and more important to have real ones. (AMEN! So grateful to have found real ones @LMAintl!) #LMA18
18-21 year olds are very happy. Then happiness drops sharply until about age 50. Then increases again all the way up to 85. At 70, you're about as happy as you were at 18-21, and it only stays in an upward trend after that. #LMA18
The ability to maintain an optimistic outlook is extremely important to maintaining happiness. #LMA18

"I am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself. For I have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition." - Martha Washington #LMA18
And nature makes us happy. People's brains respond in dramatically different ways to rural nature - it's physiologically relaxing. #LMA18
So what then does make us happy? Certain behaviors like eating, exercising, shopping, and giving. (And finding perfect gift creates more happiness than shopping for yourself.)  #LMA18
What do we think makes us happy but really doesn't? Money. "Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants." - Ben Franklin #LMA18

Only law firms who have been on list of best at client service all 17 years of BTI's research are Jones Day, Sidley, and Morgan Lewis. #LMAMKT
Top industry growth prospects across legal practices are health care, pharmaceuticals, banking, financial services, and manufacturing. #LMAMKT
IP Litigation is also a priority practice as over 30% of companies expect to be added to IP Litigation that weren't part of it in the 2016-17 time frame. New client opportunity. #LMAMKT

Best-in-Class @BTIConsulting Client Service 30 includes my own @KLGates!
Interestingly, only 31.4% of corporate counsel recommend their primary #lawfirm first. Primarily because of client service. #LMAMKT
Overall, clients are working with 47 law firms in total. But 11 of them account for 80% of outside counsel spending. #LMAMKT
AmLaw 200 increase marketing and business development budgets from 2.14% of revenue to 2.57%. Added 3-4 FTEs in mktg department. #LMAMKT
Corporate counsel plan to settle 40% of litigation matters that came in 2013 and are coming in 2014. @BTIConsulting #LMAMKT
How will in-house counsel keep spending flat while handling surge in # of matters? Triage. Aggressive use of early case assessment. #LMAMKT
Corporate counsel committed to keeping litigation spending flat but projected surge in total number of matters. @BTIConsulting #LMAMKT
Many of the dollars that used to go to Corporate (note: M&amp;A is separate category) are shifted to Regulatory and Compliance now. #LMAMKT

Premium practices for 2014 (receiving higher rates): Regulatory, M&amp;A, Class Actions, IP Litigation. #LMAMKT #lawfirm
Many global companies not based in US but with significant US operations are giving  decision-making power to US outside counsel. #LMAMKT
On corporate legal market for outside counsel, US-centric Fortune 1000 is down from 56 to 50% while Global 500 is up from 31 to 39%. #LMAMKT
Corporate counsel shift spending in-house: In 2011, they were spending $33.5 billion; in 2013 it is $39.8 billion. #LMAMKT
