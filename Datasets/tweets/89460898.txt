All five Georgia Dems opted to vote in favor of the compromise. 19 House Dems voted against it, including liberal freshmen Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib, and several Texas Dems.
A little more about Perdue: he visited the border earlier this week and mentioned it in his release explaining his vote. Drug and human trafficking there "is alarming," he said. "Our border patrol agents need additional resources, barriers so they can do their jobs..."
Worth noting the agreement was far less partisan in the Senate than it was the House. (Passed Senate 83-16.) But Perdue generally votes with the chamber's ultra conservatives on immigration. Cotton, Cruz voted no. Perdue called the bill a "step in the right direction" #gapol
