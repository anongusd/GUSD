I truly believe that the future can be better than the present and we have the power to make it so. Kenya remains an attractive business and tourist destination so let us ensure that we show this on our media and continue spreading positivity and hope.
You are right, waache fitina https://t.co/gcKxESQ3QJ

Except a few basic things, you don't "have" to do anything. Almost everything you do is because you choose to do. Because you can. Nothing wrong with that. Just take responsibility for being where you are, for your choices. You've power to choose your future. Start. Now.
The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.	To work together so that tomorrow is better than today. https://t.co/zB8L4FJMtx
