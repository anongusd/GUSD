@realDonaldTrump And not Club Fed Prison for ACTUAL wealthy people, but RAPE PRISON, where some big “Son of a Bitch” is going to whisper sweet nothings in Don Jr’s ear while he makes fuck on your first born! Pardon him, and you’ll end up in the cell next to him in less than a year!
@realDonaldTrump You didn’t deny your son lied to Congress, so he is still going to prison. Even if Blumenthal stated he won the entire Vietnam war, your son is still going to prison, for lying to Congress.

@karoljeanne1 I think it’s terrible your son is serving honorably, but being denied his rightful pay. Trump shutting down the government should not have any effect on a fellow shipmates pay. Shouldn’t he care about the military? Isn’t that why you voted for him?
@realDonaldTrump That’s a fence.
@realDonaldTrump I hope HBO is okay with you stealing their show’s font. I hope “Game of Thrones” sue’s you for the couple hundred million you have on hand/or worth. Your TAXES is COMING, to prove it.

Trump saying he can’t be indicted on campaign violations, because he is President, is like saying, “You can’t arrest me for stealing this car, because I am already in it.”  #IndividualOne

These billion dollar companies have no incentive to pay more, when they are getting all of these tax breaks. Tax rate is the lowest it has been in decades. More money in consumers pockets also means more spending, meaning more demand. #JobsReport
Unemploymentis low, but so are wages. If you raise taxes on companies, it forces them to pay workers more to stay competitive, to increase production, to make up the difference. Make it harder to force competition.  #JobsReport
