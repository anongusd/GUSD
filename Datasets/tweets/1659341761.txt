@KimmeIsaiah :We have entered the reality of a gov utterly void of #ethics &amp; in complete denial of their true motives: profit @ allcost. Some day even you &amp;I may have price tags on our heads. What @BLM is doing to horses is why so many cry at night in kill pens.Yes; they do
Per @KimmeIsaiah Feedlot;another word 4 Purgatory where #wildhorses wait 2 be shipped 2 their deaths. No wonder one can hear them weeping at night in their holding pens. How do these people sleep at night hearing the terrified sounds of horses crying? I guess $ is their earplugs.
Per @big_catsf No administration should be able to sentence innocent animals to death for their own greed,no cattle ranchers should have priority to Public Land over the horses that have roamed there for centuries. #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #StopTheRoundups #BanHorseSlaughter

From @EkbMary The filthy, abusive kill pens on our borders must be shut down...but @USDA_APHIS looks the other way. They give kill buyers ‚ÄúUSDA‚Äù fit to ship stickers sight unseen. It is a massive racket that is knowingly sending toxic (US) horse meat into the global food supply.
Per @urbanhorsedoc The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity.	George Bernard Shaw.                     #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #StopTheRoundups #StopHorseCrueltyByBLM #BanHorseSlaughter
Six states have already lost their #wildhorse populations: Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. BLM never mentions that in when they allege overpopulation.

We demand a Congressional investigation into @BLMNational @BLMWHB #animalabuse #fraud. The $80 million roundup &amp; warehouse scheme is all part of the $500 mil to $1 billion in annual subsidies to #welfareranchers. Public lands, #wild horses and the wildlife therein belongs to us.
Per @CountryJazz4 Cattle &amp; sheep are not native animals &amp; they destroy grazing land.On the contrary,the rent for public land is very low. They are not over populated..horse's land has been taken from them. Mares only reproduce once as year. Roundups are not needed. Leave them be.

@KimmeIsaiah :We have entered the reality of a gov utterly void of #ethics &amp; in complete denial of their true motives: profit @ allcost. Some day even you &amp;I may have price tags on our heads. What @BLM is doing to horses is why so many cry at night in kill pens.Yes; they do
Is this life?Our national icon #WildHorses in holding pens.	No shelter/running/family.	Bands are separated by gender&amp; age. No stimulation.	There R more horses in holding than on the range.BLM rents our #PublicLand/$1.41 for cattle.	#StopTheRoundups #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic
Freedom4Horses:I don't know how many times I've cried after seeing gaunt little skeletons,weary hanging heads,look of defeat in animals that were once so majestic. Knowing it's a direct result of @BLMWHB lazy &amp;cruel management,who gaslights about it. It's wrong.

@RepRaulGrijalva @HoofHugs The horses you R riding &amp; their ancestors have evolved here in NA beginning sometime between 55 &amp; 60 mil. years ago continuing thru modern times.  This is documented within the natural history of the United States &amp; global scientific journals. E. caballus 1.8 mil. ago.

@RepRaulGrijalva Remember when you see the helicopters chasing pregnant mares, #wildhorses in kill pens, horses riddled with bullets, or any other atrocities because horses are ‚Äúoverpopulated‚Äù, that there are over 8 million AUMs 4 livestock.

@RepRaulGrijalva It's a huge slap in the face to any intelligent person who can see that @BLMWHB is purposely putting these animals at risk for abuse,neglect &amp; slaughter, when they are supposed 2be wild &amp;free.They don't just hurt horses,they hurt people too. #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #ReinInBLM

@RepRaulGrijalva Per @priyasanger That is tragic.

@RepRaulGrijalva Per @NeillVicki That is a BIGGIE ! its a topic that HAS to be brought out in the open &amp; has been silent to the public . 	The BLM has become like China &amp; the Yulin dog meat trade. Worse cuz these horses R supposed to b protected &amp; they're using our tax dollars for these atrocities
@RepRaulGrijalva @NancyPelosi So shameful!  They are eating our horses as Sushi in Japan.  It is not humane, it is not pretty. #SAFEAct is at a bipartison majority! Put it on floor for vote.  #Yes2Safe #wildhorses #KeepThemWild #ReinInBLM #AmericaKillsWildhorsesAndICare #HorsesAreNotAnIngredient
@RepRaulGrijalva Per @CountryJazz4 Cattle &amp; sheep are not native animals &amp; they destroy grazing land.On the contrary,the rent for public land is very low. They are not over populated..horse's land has been taken from them. Mares only reproduce once as year. Roundups are not needed. Leave them be.
@RepRaulGrijalva We demand a Congressional investigation into @BLMNational @BLMWHB #animalabuse #fraud. The $80 million roundup &amp; warehouse scheme is all part of the $500 mil to $1 billion in annual subsidies to #welfareranchers. Public lands, #wild horses and the wildlife therein belongs to us.
@RepRaulGrijalva That is exactly what BLM has become! The #horseslaughter pipeline has been incorporated into their policy and procedures. Anyone surprised? Who trusts them still? Anyone? #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #AmericaKillsHorsesAndICare #HorsesAreNotAnIngredient
@RepRaulGrijalva The most heartbreaking thing is there R dozens of horse intakes daily @ kill pens all over the country. They are lovely,dear souls that don‚Äôt deserve 2 be there.This is similar in magnitude of Dogs, Cats in shelters except the horses go to slaughter. I am overwhelmed @ this issue
@RepRaulGrijalva Freedom4Horses:I don't know how many times I've cried after seeing gaunt little skeletons,weary hanging heads,look of defeat in animals that were once so majestic. Knowing it's a direct result of @BLMWHB lazy &amp;cruel management,who gaslights about it. It's wrong.
@RepRaulGrijalva Is this life?Our national icon #WildHorses in holding pens.	No shelter/running/family.	Bands are separated by gender&amp; age. No stimulation.	There R more horses in holding than on the range.BLM rents our #PublicLand/$1.41 for cattle.	#StopTheRoundups #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic
@RepRaulGrijalva Per @KimmeIsaiah Feedlot;another word 4 Purgatory where #wildhorses wait 2 be shipped 2 their deaths. No wonder one can hear them weeping at night in their holding pens. How do these people sleep at night hearing the terrified sounds of horses crying? I guess $ is their earplugs.
@RepRaulGrijalva @KimmeIsaiah :We have entered the reality of a gov utterly void of #ethics &amp; in complete denial of their true motives: profit @ allcost. Some day even you &amp;I may have price tags on our heads. What @RyanZinke is doing to horses is why so many cry at night in kill pens.Yes; they do
@RepRaulGrijalva Imagine you were a #wildhorse one day &amp; the next you‚Äôre living in filth with no clean land to lay or walk on.Thanks @BLMWHB   #StopTheRoundups #StopHorseCrueltyByBLM #ReinInBLM #AmericaKillsWildHorsesAndICare #KeepItWild #KeepItPublic #BanHorseSlaughter #HorsesAreNotAnIngredient
@RepRaulGrijalva Each 1 of our fed protected #wildhorses has a unique story. Some remain free 4ever, others languish yrs in #BLMWHB pens. Some r successfully adopted, others meet a horrific fate at a Mexican slaughterhouse. #VotingHumane2018 2 keep them free! #ReinInBLM #HorsesAreNotAnIngredient
@RepRaulGrijalva Six states have already lost their #wildhorse populations: Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. BLM never mentions that in when they allege overpopulation. They spin the truth so hard. But we know better. #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #AmericaKillsHorsesAndICare
@RepRaulGrijalva Dept of Interior wants 2 eliminate #wildhorses, #burro, elk horn sheep,wolves,bears, etc  &amp; now mountain goats.Wake up 2 the new American landscape:despoiled public lands w/mining, fracking, gas&amp; mineral exploitation interests &amp; few living creatures. What kind of future is this?
@RepRaulGrijalva Wild horses have lost 41% of their land since 1971 and share nearly every HMA (Herd Management Area) with livestock. In spite of this, horses are blamed for all range degradation. #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #AmericaKillsHorsesAndICare #HorsesAreNotAnIngredient
@RepRaulGrijalva Per @urbanhorsedoc The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity.	George Bernard Shaw.                     #KeepThemWild #KeepItPublic #StopTheRoundups #StopHorseCrueltyByBLM #BanHorseSlaughter
