@opineno @Joel58271 @jamacia813 @AnnOlivarius @lisellebaker @johniadarola I have lived in a trailer park, and the comment coming from both Graham and Carville didn't offend me one bit.
I guess what we have learned over the past decades is that if you are a sexual assault victim, it is better that your allegations be against a conservative. Evidence is not necessary in those situations to be accepted as truth.
It's pretty easy to bring up Clinton when sexual assault is the topic.  Somehow it was never a problem with Democrats back then. Maybe you just have to have something that hurts a republican administration. https://t.co/MAzxXYXzmK
