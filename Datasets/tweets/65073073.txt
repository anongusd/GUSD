@DinahVP @SJRWMD @GovRonDeSantis Miklos has a side the public hasnt seen. a side that trys to help people. Such as 250 homeowners with 9 foot of muck in a 9 foot deep canal. irma caused. I never knew the man before this. several trips over here to see the problem.  said when he goes of the board he going to help
RT @DinahVP: Wow! https://t.co/ODPU77BXnp
@RonDeSantisFL Leave John Miklos alone leave him on your team. He does more good in one week than most do in a year! He helps people ----	@LJMoss1
@DinahVP THATS because he is good! Leave him alone jealous nobodys 		@LJMoss1
@DinahVP John Miklos has told me he stepped down because of all the critics. regardless he is educated in this field---who else has that kind of knowledge? Some wanna bees maybe	@LJMoss1 moss
@DinahVP @RonDeSantisFL @SJRWMD i would like to speak with you regarding John Miklos and tell you what he had started to do for a tiny village just outside of Tavares fl. The good in him is undeniable regardless of other thought. We could now use your help: pollution, since hurricane Irma.Linda @LJMoss1
@DinahVP John Miklos is a very caring man and i believe that his own business looked like a conflict and possibly became one but not on purpose. He is too kind of a man and willing to help anyone.

What about the flow if toxins muck and sediment again out of lake apopka. Please help https://t.co/AARP5Plckr
@FloridaGOP @GovRonDeSantis @SenRickScott @marcorubio @POTUS #brianmast need help with lake apopka flooding pollution in harris chain again
And yet they cant afford to dredge canals fill of muck from lake apopka or stop the flooding of lake apopka during big storms that continues to pollute the harris chain of lakes. Hide it in the closet.   Mike Perry can cover up all he wants but the public knows the truth https://t.co/zCFqZqERgb
@DinahVP @ABShortelle @SJRWMD The ship has not turned and the people and Harris chain of lakes are suffering. Flooding downstream during storms is bringing more muck and sediment than ever. Until a solution is implemented the Harris chain of lakes will  continue to get polluted more and more every year
Where and who? https://t.co/T9urtXF36I
@dennisbaxley Please remember us in venetian village and the Harris chain of lakes
@RepBrianMast Please help below the lock and damm of Lake Apopka. We are  full of muck and sediment that  flows downstrem from lake apopka polluting our  canals and the HARRIS CHAIN OF LAKES being ignored by LCWA. John Miklos Hs been here he is aware of the huge problem lurking

@WESH CONGRATULATIONS. I HAVE A 65 YEAR OLD CASE IM STILL TRYING TO SOLVE. DNA WAS NOT A KNOWN SOURCE UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO SO FINALLY MY DNA WENT IN.
@SJRWMD BEAUTIFUL. WHERE CAN WE GET THEM?"
@AnthonySabatini the ongoing crisis from Lake Apopka downstream after hurricanes it wont be beautiful for long. John Miklos has been here and is aware of the problem. The LCWA has covered it up for years to the point they cant any long. Please phone me and let me show u. 352-551-8953
Please see John Miklos about the ongoing downstream from Lake Apopka and the changes that need to be made asap.
@SJRWMD Please speak to John Miklos who has been here and stated that other avenues of water release from lake apopka has got to be established to prevent the flooding downstream during high impact storms otherwise the residential canals and the harris chain continues to be polluted .
@SJRWMD Please spend this MONEY 1st in stopping the flooding of muck and sediment which continues to pollute the residential canals and  the harris chain. The Tammi dr canal venetian village tavares has 9 foot of  apopka muck will not be navigable when the water levels return to normal .
@RepBrianMast this is 1 of 100 s for 8 months
@RepBrianMast corps of engineers are needed desperatly at Lake Apopka. Any releases from there need to be tested as well meeting requested please. https://t.co/uNRxFmCSyV

@RepBrianMast AND Lake Apopka---------------------
Muck from Lake Apopka repolluting the Harris Chain of Lakes is ongoing! Large storms have proved this . A new plan needs to be put in place to stop the flooding downstream into the HARRIS CHAIN. The 7 million dollar nurf plant is useless in big storms. ljmoss@aol.com emaildetails
@dennisbaxley Please do not forget us  in Venetian Village Tavares, fl. The muck condition gets worse daily in our canals and the harris chain from Lake Apopka. Mike Perry, the director of the LCWA is trying to cover up  instead of helping us. John Miklos is trying to help. .
