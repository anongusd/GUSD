Do Dems want to impeach Kavanaugh if he’s confirmed to SC or stays on DC circuit? @RepRaskin (sits on Judiciary &amp; Oversight) said: 		“Impeachment may be indicated if there is evidence there was perjury or obstruction of justice used in this process.”		https://t.co/BBAxJiS2zx
Nadler (who’d chair Judiciary) and Cummings (who’d chair Oversight) are key in this and they both indicated they want to further investigate Kavanaugh. 		But before Congress left for recess I spoke to a # of Dems on both committees &amp; they’re itching to hold hearings.

I asked Flake if these women changed his mind and he said "no." https://t.co/rsEtqmryXV
This comment by @JeffFlake is interesting on why he called for delay. He wanted Dems to “endorse” his idea “publicly.”		FLAKE: “The country needs to see some kind of bipartisan agreement even if the final vote isn’t any different that the process is different.”
“There has to be some follow up by the FBI in order for me to feel comfortable with voting on the floor,” @JeffFlake said to reporters. 		But Flake won’t say definitively that he’d vote NO on Kavanaugh just that he won’t feel comfortable.
Flake to reporters just now said he will be talking to McConnell about his request for a delay. Said he started conversation with Coons. 		Asked if being confronted by the two women this morning changed his mind at all he shook his head no.
Grassley calls the understanding a "gentleman and woman's agreement." 		Feinstein thought there would be a motion.
FLAKE: "Democrats who have been justifiably uncomfortable moving ahead."

FLAKE: "I WON'T be comfortable moving on the floor until the FBI has done more investigation than they have already. I think we owe them due diligence."

@nickpwing @CaritoJuliette @DohaMadani Don't lie, Nick. Every time you send a gif in Slack or a conversation starts about how basic @igorbobic is, Slack gives you an avenue to be unproductive unlike any other medium. It is the ultimate time-waster.
@CaritoJuliette @DohaMadani @nickpwing You guys are a cult. I hated Slack when I worked at HP. Nothing's changed. You need to reach a reporter running around the Capitol, email me. Don't @ me in a Slack convo with an entire newsroom. 		-- fin --
