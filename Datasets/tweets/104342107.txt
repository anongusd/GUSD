These experiences and stories need not be cheapened. I hope their stories can be communicated more for our peers to see and hear... /6

and just other harrowing things you would expect under such a dictatorship. This is stuff people in this country take for granted. Imagine having no basic resources because of government? Scary stuff. 		They said Venezuela isn‚Äôt a laughing matter or a possibility to dismiss. /4
...of being forced out of their homelands because Maduro wants people like them out, of people starving and having to eat dogs and cats to barely survive, of having to dodge bullets, of having limited basic necessities like a hot shower or bath because they are scarce. /3

Relying on basic laws in place, let private people and businesses voluntarily do their part to promote a healthy environment. This reliance on so much government won‚Äôt end well for us or the environment.		*End rant* 		#GreenNewDeal /6
or coercing people into vegan / vegetarian diets. 		Conservation, not preservation, is the gold standard for environmentalism. 		Government shouldn‚Äôt have such a big stake in the environment. It can easily pollute and ruin the environment too‚Äîsee Gold King Mine spill of 2015. /5
Nobody is going to willingly give up their oil and gas powered cars or anything for 100% renewable in 10 years. That‚Äôs a pipe dream. That would kill 88% of our economy and depress our GDP. 		Humans and the environment should coexist without pushing population control... /4
Business and the environment should coexist without sacrificing one or the other.		Energy is NOT the enemy; cronies are. People rely on traditional energy sources because it‚Äôs cheap, easily obtainable, and far cleaner to produce today. /3
Nothing about the environment much at all.		If this preservationist, government-coerced, mandatory vegan proposal is what serves for modern-day environmentalism, it‚Äôs an absolute disgrace and a sham. /2 #GreenNewDeal
The #GreenNewDeal is so repulsive, even its would-be ardent supporters have said it would be bad for the economy and this country.		Parsing through the FAQ sheet on the proposed deal, it‚Äôs absolutely laughable and sounds like the musings of Karl Marx. /1
Free market environmentalism is the perfect antidote to @AOC ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù nuttiness. 		Anything calling for you to sacrifice your lifestyle by government force is not good for the environment. That‚Äôs a preservationist nightmare.		Glad to even see Dems not get on board...

@bethanyshondark Talk to @nathanleamerfcc ;)
I have never relied on my appearance or whatever to get ahead. Never. Do you know how ridiculous you sound? 		I‚Äôve also ignored advice sent my way urging me to compromise my values to get ahead. In fact, I‚Äôve said NO to opportunities  because I didn‚Äôt play dirty or fall in line. https://t.co/nfvq2viDWO
@POMA_HQ @SportingClassic @FieldandStream I cannot wait for what lies ahead üòä
What‚Äôs the takeaway from this?		Anyone can write columns, news stories, and get media mentions if they work hard, ignore detractors, and find their unique bent. 		Any opportunity I find to help aspiring writers, I do. I was advised to pay it forward like mentors did to me /17
With my business flourishing now, I‚Äôve gotten to do more writing recently‚Äîespecially the outdoor storytelling + interview variety. 		Joining a group like @POMA_HQ has opened a lot of doors and led me to be published in @SportingClassic and now @FieldandStream /16
Many assume I write for a living. I don‚Äôt‚ÄîI‚Äôm a media consultant. You cannot survive as a writer unless you‚Äôre a journalist. Writing is just one of many skills I‚Äôve developed over the years. So I wanted to help others hone writing and communications skills... /15
Doing @wideopenspaces with @RTDOpinions and other appearances from 2015‚Äìon led me to write about guns, conservation, hunting as my focus at @resurgent ‚Äî a focus I still maintain today with some political stuff. 		In 2016, I got burnt by politics and political writing... /14
In ‚Äò15-16, I started picking up writing on fishing, hunting, and shooting sports. I‚Äôve fished most of my life and saw how unfair media paints all of these. I was crossover potential. Soon wrote dozens of pieces‚Äîincluding exclusive interviews‚Äî at @wideopenspaces /13
If media hits followed, added bonus. If not, I didn‚Äôt care. The purpose was to call into question unsettling things ‚Äî like my AG Mark Herring illegally getting rid of concealed handgun reciprocity agreements with 25 other states. 		My bent was/isn‚Äôt to parrot news stories /12
More Virginia-centered columns came in RTD, @heraldcourier with @NRATV and other media appearances(digital/online TV) to supplement writing. 		Went into writing pieces with desire to explain situations/news/ get info out there, not get media hits. That would defeat purpose /11
Then I started writing for a few more big pubs from 2013-2016. Few columns in Washington Times, Times of Israel, Richmond Times-Dispatch. Concurrently subjected myself to intense editorial scrutiny. Wasn‚Äôt easy. 		Found my permanent writing home at @resurgent in March 2016. /10
My first big break in political writing came when I had my first column printed in @townhallcom in March 2013‚Äìwhen I wrote about the resurgence of Neo-Sovietism in Russia. The late M. Stanton Evans, who was an expert on this and a hero of mine, told me he loved the article. /9
Undeterred again, I still kept chugging away at writing. I was tapped to help launch @TCC_US in 2011 and later, my sister and I launched the now defunct Counter Cultured blog, in 2012. 		I was told my talents were nonexistent. I guess blog founders saw through this BS /8
One of those editors ‚Äî and past president  College Republicans ‚Äî oddly enough someone who now works and also lives in similar DC circles‚Äî told me to my face in spring 2010 that my writing sucked and that I have no future in it. Mind you, this was a fellow Republican woman. /7
In college, writing for @CalReview was my refuge. I got my first taste of political commentary writing and started to excel. Wrote some exposes on student government, BDS, and columns. One piece got a lot of traction, though, and editors put disclaimer throwing me under bus /6
Undeterred, I kept writing my ‚ÄúTeen Beat‚Äù column. I never thought a HS in conservative Orange County would be so hostile to such views. 		When time came for college in fall 2009, I sought out a place with alternative or conservative newspapers. @UCSanDiego had one /5
I also applied to write for my HS newspaper ‚Äî the Tesoro Tribune‚Äî using existing clips. I was interviewed by editors‚Äîincluding the daughter of a ‚ÄúReal Housewives of Orange County‚Äù star‚Äîwho told me my conservative views were too extreme. Rejection notice came shortly afterward. /4
By spring of 10th grade ‚Äî 2007‚Äî I had my first ever newspaper appearance in the letter-to-the-editor section of @ocregister . My teacher challenged us to write LTTE using vocab words of the week. Challenge accepted. That led me to getting 3-4 letters printed that year alone. /3
The only writing I had done beforehand was school papers &amp; such. I came across this contact, she asked me to pitch her ideas, and lo and behold, my first column was born.		In the three years of writing this column, I got some traction from the community‚Äîpositive and negative. /2
If any aspiring writers out there, I want to tell you success is possible‚Äîusing my story. THREAD. 		Nearly 13 years ago, when I was entering 10th grade, I started column writing for a local Orange County CA neighborhood paper. It was my first-ever column called ‚ÄúTeen Beat.‚Äù /1

If you are a parent who takes their kid hunting here in Virginia , @GovernorVA ‚Äòs gun control package includes a bill ‚Äî#6‚Äî that would make it illegal for kids under 18 to possess or handle firearms.

To fund the #GreenNewDeal, @AOC believes taxing our nation's top income earners up to 70% will achieve that, since they must pony up "their fair share."	Emulating FDR, who taxed Americans up to 94%, is bad economics. I analyze it up at @resurgent ==&gt; https://t.co/4xQWMofckV

FDR's high taxation led to the "greatest reduction in inequality in American history"? 		1) There was great economic disparity under his obtuse economic policies. Govt picked winners and losers. 	2) His policies gave us Japanese internment camps and more anti-Semitism https://t.co/XExcxndMuE
@riverotter1968 I'm not confusing anything. The more highly taxed a business, the fewer jobs result. Wealthy people supply most jobs in this country. A lot of people give "trickle-down economics" flak, but high income earners supply jobs for those in lower brackets.
This is just short of the 90% income tax found under 12 years of FDR's administration here in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union last century... Let's not go there.

I support and endorse predator hunting as I do managed big game hunts. However, I don‚Äôt feel obligated nor do I feel compelled to partake in it in urban NoVA. If animals are visiting, you don‚Äôt get trigger hungry at its sight‚Äîespecially sans l No Kill License. /3
I live in urban Fairfax County, VA‚Äîwhich is densely populated. I love photographing wildlife‚Äîincluding foxes‚Äî that descend on my backyard. If a fox interacts with humans negatively, Va law defers us to VDGIF to handle them. This fox is harming NO ONE, so no hunting. /2

@CyrusBaird @resurgent Right. I understand the concern. I don't think Uptain's death is main factor in favor of delisting, mosre so the science/NAMWC. Think I communicated that mostly in the piece. Discussions definitely will be had and I appreciate your close monitoring of this /nuances emphasized!
@CyrusBaird @resurgent I understand the concern with that, given grizzlies are unpredictable and it was odd. But you will agree that no managed hunts will lead to greater human-bear interactions, but for the worse. Maybe it wasn't prudent on my end to use that, but more deaths like this can happen...
Anti-hunters &amp; radical environmentalists are playing with fire by interrupting science-based wildlife management efforts in the GYE region. In fact, halt of WY hunt led to elk hunting guide being mauled to death by a grizzly sow&amp;her yearly cub. https://t.co/vUhpwP61T2 @resurgent

@kembageorge @SafariClubIntl @NRA @SportsmensAll Sure! The grizzly population has exploded in recent years, largely due to successes of Endangered Species Act. As a result of this growth and more stable populations, USFWS delisted them last year since they are no longer endangered. /1

I personally wouldn't use memes of dictators, but using quotes and words uttered by them - including language favoring gun confiscation - to highlight why we have the Second Amendment is NOT criminal. It's exposing THEIR words for people to know how evil they were /2
Just reading up on @JDMartinez14 controversy of him using an alleged anti-gun Hitler quote on IG to show how dictators were anti-gun. Quote is debatable, but dictators like Hitler, Stalin, Castro, etc., had a track record of confiscating guns. 	 /1

It‚Äôs sad it‚Äôs socially unacceptable to reject both National Socialism AND global communism / socialism, which are similar statist worldviews that killed millions of people last century‚Äîwith socialism still killing people today. Why I‚Äôm a firm believer in combatting revisionism
Democratic socialism calls for the abolition of profit. Finland and Norway are heavily taxed countries who still turn a profit. In fact, Finland just announced they are undoing universal basic income (UBI) because its citizens now lack ambition https://t.co/y1vZhaDp8I https://t.co/h4AnQLLFEP
Do you not see that I‚Äôm half-Jewish? The Nazi comparisons are incorrect too. National Socialism (Nazism) IS a cousin of the socialism that was found in the USSR. https://t.co/4Z2wmP55KW
Moreover, many of these media outlets ‚Äî like New York Times ‚Äîwrote Pro-Stalin, Pro-Fidel, Pro-Chavez, Pro-Mao scribes last century &amp; still do. Hypocrites and historical revisionists, the lot of you /2
I‚Äôm frankly getting sick of the ‚ÄúTrump is Stalin‚Äù rhetoric by members of the media‚Äîwho ironically  want government to fund them. Stop the illusory comparison, because those of us with family who ACTUALLY endured, survived, or died at hands of Stalin policies will counteract you.
Have you actually lived in a society run by dictators? If yes, then you would know  dictators handpick journalists to push their statist agendas. (See Pravda.) Dictators also jail / kill those critical. 		Trump ISN‚ÄôT Stalin; you insult my family members who survived Stalin https://t.co/JSVMSEXZND
Real freedom lies in economic freedom, aka free enterprise‚Äînot statism nor nationalizing industries.

People lump law-abiding gun owners with criminals. People don't want you to legally possess a firearm if you live in a city, because it's only for those in rural areas they tell us. People say more laws are needed to repel crime, but evidence shows contrary /5
The current debate on firearms is very heated and a lot of outrage is unfairly placed on #2A supporters &amp; @NRA. People unintentionally or deliberately mischaracterize firearms, gunsplain to us with some level of proficiency what we should use and not use for home defense /4
...when law-abiding gun owners stop bad guys, it should be plastered across the news‚Äînot just contained to local stations. Alas, the media selectively highlights those who abuse firearms and not those who use it for good‚Äîwhich are the majority in this country. /3
The majority of gun owners‚Äîme included‚Äîare law-abiding &amp; want nothing more than society to be rid of crime. If law-abiding, well-trained gun owners can aid police with repelling crime, why not? It takes police minutes to arrive ‚Äî critical minutes between life and death. /2
10 years ago today, #SCOTUS affirmed by 5-4 vote Americans have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms w/ respect to personal defense at home. That will sadly not deter firearms prohibitionists, but when law-abiding can exercise #2A, everyone wins. @NRA 	#DefendThe2nd /1

I pay close attention to policy related to fishing and hunting, and have done so for the last few years. It's refreshing to see @interior select leaders of the hunting industry to dictate and reform policies which actually bolster conservation, not advance preservation.
Hunters are the original conservationists, whose efforts and contributions directly benefit restoration of wildlife/species, refuges, habitats, and continuing the cycle. Read up the Pittman Robertson Act. This vilification must be combated, and I will happily dispel myths. https://t.co/nXWuEOvgRr

@KE6ZGP Legal trophy hunting is controversial, yes. However, I recommend watching "Trophy" and looking into initiatives like Let Africa Live. More than meets the eyes. The groups listed promote conservation here and abroad, even beyond "trophy" species.
